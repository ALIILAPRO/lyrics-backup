		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Second thoughts before I laugh out loud 
Don’t you see I be a threat right now 
You’re trippin on a cigarette 
By the time you tuck away your lighter
I’m getting right into your head
I’ll be right behind you now 
Getting right into your head 
I’m getting right 
I’m getting right into your head 
Getting right 
Getting right into your head 
I’m getting right 
Getting right into your head 
Getting right into your head 
I’m getting right 
I’m getting right into your head 
Getting right into your head 
I’m getting right 
Getting right into your head
I swear I was a saint before 
Before you came along 
But all I ever want is more 
And you can be the one 
You can be the one 
We decide what’s left unseen 
I feed you pretty lies, you see 
Behind these eyes 
I lean on my desire 
Getting right into your head 
I’m getting right 
I’m getting right into your head 
I’m getting right into your head 
I’m getting right
Getting right into your head
I’m getting right into your head 
Im getting right 
Getting right into your head
