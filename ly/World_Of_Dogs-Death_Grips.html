		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's all suicide
World of dogs

Ruthless and free
It's all suicide to me
World of dogs

It's all suicide

You live in hiding
You're climbing the walls, no privacy
I'm trying to survive but I'm dying, die with me
Blow out the lights, take your life
Ride the falling sky with me
Falling inside of me
It's all suicide to me
World of dogs

It's all suicide
World of dogs gone mad
Above the law, in your ass
Fire trash, meltdown I'm not here
I'm world of dogs infrared
Tear me apart left for dead
But I'm not dead yet
Sick 'em, sick 'em yes

World of dogs

Ruthless and free
It's all suicide to me
Cut it
Don't tell no one, no one can know, come closer
I'm almost over, lower sinkholer
I'm nothing, feed me to this world of dogs
Barely breathing in this world of dogs
Foam of feral reality forming on mountains of teeth
Devour the hand, spit out the leash
Crown the beast, my throne's the street
Too cold to sleep, I kill myself I feel no pain
I'm obsolete
World of dogs
