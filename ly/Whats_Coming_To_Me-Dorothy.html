		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I could feel it from the start
Thick, like fog
It was the warning of a
Broken heart
Blinded by the lightning 
And the white-hot power of love
Rain and thunder
Washing me under
And I'm cursin' the skies above

A storm is brewin' babe
I ain't got time to sit and pray
Because this life don't come free
I got what's mine comin' to me
I said a storm is brewin' babe
I ain't got time to sit and pray
Because this life don't come free
I got what's mine comin' to me

Sugar, understand what's in store
So, you'll be ready
'Cause the breakin' levy
Bringin' water to your door

A storm is brewin' babe
I ain't got time to sit and pray
Because this life don't come free
I got what's mine comin' to me
I said a storm is brewin' babe
I ain't got time to sit and pray
Because this life don't come free
I got what's mine comin' to me

Love ain't patient
It's not kind
And true love waits
To rob you blind
I've braved this hurricane
And I got mine
Blowin' right back to me

A storm is brewin' babe
I ain't got time to sit and pray
Because this life don't come free
I got what's mine comin' to me
I said a storm is brewin' babe
I ain't got time to sit and pray
Because this life don't come free
I got what's mine comin' to me

I said this life don't come free
I got what's mine comin' to me
