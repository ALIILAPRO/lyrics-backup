		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My mama tell me go back to school
My daddy tell me don't act like a fool
But I act like a fool, act like a fool

My mama tell me turn down the noise
My daddy tell me be careful with boys
I'm never careful, I'm never careful

I fell in love with the wrong guy
With the devil himself
And I just don't know why
I don't want no one else
You're my apple of eden I swear just one bite
I know that it's wrong but it still feels so right 
I fell in love with the wrong guy
With the devil himself

You tear me apart but let me give you some tips
First kiss my heart only then kiss my lips
Go, go, go kiss my lips 

My mama tell me go back to school
My daddy tell me don't act like a fool
But I act like a fool, act like a fool

My mama tell me turn down the noise
My daddy tell me be careful with boys
I'm never careful, I'm never careful

I remember your smell
I am under your spell
I am ready for you
You're my heaven and hell
Cause you never ever answer the phone
And baby I can't take it no more

You tear me apart but let me give you some tips
First kiss my heart only then kiss my lips

I should have listened
I should have listened ooh
I coulda skipped all this drama 
If I had listened to mama

My mama told me go back to school
Daddy said don't be a fool
But I'm still a fool, I'm still a fool

My mama told me turn down the noise
My daddy tell me be careful with boys
I'm still not careful, I'm still not careful
