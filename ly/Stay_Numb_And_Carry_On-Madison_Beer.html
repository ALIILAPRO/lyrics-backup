		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stay numb and carry on
Too young to hate someone
Truth is it was never love
Your fault if you thought it was
Stay numb and carry on
Too young to hate someone
Truth is it was never love
Your fault if you thought it was

Tongue taste like liquid poison
Medicine for my inner voices
Can't drown these static noises
I tried (I tried)

Panic mode
It's Helter-Skelter
Red alert, cherry Alka-Seltzer
Shake it up and find some shelter to hide (to hide)

I've become emotionless
My heart can't help but wonder where the feeling is

So I just stay numb and carry on
Too young to hate someone
Truth is it was never love
Your fault if you thought it was
Stay numb and carry on
Too young to hate someone
Truth is it was never love
Your fault if you thought it was

I was gin and you were toxic
We had nothing good in common
Wish we just stayed platonic
We tried (we tried)

But my mind gets dark and ominous
Can't change it, that's just how it is
At least I'm being honest, no lie (no lie)
I don't feel like anyone
The world is mad and they say I'm the crazy one

So I just stay numb and carry on
Too young to hate someone
Truth is it was never love
Your fault if you thought it was
Stay numb and carry on
Too young to hate someone
Truth is it was never love
Your fault if you thought it was

I've become emotionless
I've become emotionless
I've become emotionless

So I just stay numb and carry on
Too young to hate someone
Truth is it was never love
Your fault if you thought it was
