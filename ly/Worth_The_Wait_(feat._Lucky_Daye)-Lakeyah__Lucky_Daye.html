		  Oh, oh-oh

(Hey)
Soon as it was over, girl, I told you I'd be knockin' at your door
(Knock, knock, knock)
I tried to work that shit out with my ex
But couldn't take it no more
You was always there for me, shared with me 
Cared for me like I was your own
So baby, I'ma make it worth the wait

Ayy
Can't no other nigga have this shit
Might take a Kelly or a Birkin just to bag this bitch, yeah (oh, oh, oh)
They usually never get a chance this quick (hey)
Real fly bitch, I make 'em first class this trip, yeah
I guess you know just what to do with it (yeah)
Keep my old thing pissed 'cause I'm stuntin' with my new, uh
You make a bitch wanna move different (move different)
Lil' toxic ass bitch, changed how she used to do niggas
Uh, you can tell I'm feelin' you
Sex good, make you take a pause in it, uh, interlude
Ride you better than the Bentley coupe (skrrt)
Iced out my wrist, he really spoilin' his bitch, silver spoon (oh, oh, oh)

(Hey)
Soon as it was over, girl, I told you I'd be knockin' at your door
(Knock, knock, knock)
I tried to work that shit out with my ex 
But couldn't take it no more
You was always there for me, shared with me 
Cared for me like I was your own
So baby (baby, yeah), I'ma make it worth the wait

Sad, I know she did me bad (bad)
Only person who gave me everything they had (had)
Over her, now I'm under you, no lie, that's facts
You even made her look better when you picked up her sla-a-a-ack
We shared secrets that neither one could tell
And you the only reason I got out on bail
You stayed down like a wishin' well
You safe now, baby, since you had me, you know I'ma keep you happy

(Hey)
Soon as it was over, girl, I told you I'd be knockin' at your door
(Knock, knock, knock) oh-oh
I tried to work that shit out with my ex 
But couldn't take it no more
You was always there for me, shared with me 
Cared for me like I was your own
So baby, I'ma make it worth the wait

Yeah
A real hold on me, fallin' but you holdin' me
Promise you gon' keep that you gon' keep that shit a hunnid, never fold on me
Tryna grow old with you, touch them O's with you
I could never front on what I feel, my heart done told on me (uh)
Baby, what you doin'? Come and get me, fuck textin'
Land in LAX, that twin seater, straight flexin' (oh, oh, oh)
Top floor vibes in The Hills, Dorchester
'Bout to make a movie with my nigga, no extras
It's all yours, you don't need permission
That role play make you take a pause in it, uh, intermission
Ride you better than the instrumentals
Told you if that shit with your bitch isn't love, this that new edition

(Hey)
Soon as it was over, girl, I told you I'd be knockin' at your door
(Knock, knock, knock)
I tried to work that shit out with my ex 
But couldn't take it no more (I couldn't take it no more)
You was always there for me, shared with me 
Cared for me like I was your own (care for me like I was your own)
So baby (baby), I'ma make it worth the wait

(Deserve diamonds, you never judge me, I know you love me)
(Deserve diamonds, you never judge me, I know you love me)
Hear everything I say
(Deserve diamonds, you never judge me, I know you love me)
You're everything I say
(Deserve diamonds, you never judge me, I know you love me)
Put that on everything, I
(Deserve diamonds, you never judge me, I know you love me)
I'll make it worth the wait
