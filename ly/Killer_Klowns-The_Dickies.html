		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  P.T. Barnum said it so long ago
There's one born every minute, don't you know
Some make us laugh, some make us cry
These clowns only gonna make you die

Everybody's running when the circus comes into their towns
Everybody's running from the likes of the killer klowns
From outer space
Killer klowns from outer space

Ringmaster shouts, "Let the show begin"
Send in the clowns, let them do you in (killer klowns)
See a rubber nose on a painted face
Bringing genocide to the human race

It's time to take a ride on a nightmare merry-go-round
You'll be dead on arrival from the likes of the killer klowns
From outer space
Killer klowns from outer space

There's cotton candy in their hands
Says a polka-dotted man with a stalk of jacaranda
They're all diabolical bozos

Oh, look around, what do you see
Tell me what's become of humanity (killer klowns)
From California shores to New York Times Square
Barnum and Bailey everywhere

If you've ever wondered why the population's going down
Blame it on the plunder of the likes of the killer klowns
From outer space
Killer klowns from outer space
