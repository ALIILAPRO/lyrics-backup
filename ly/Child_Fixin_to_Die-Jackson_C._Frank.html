		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's cold and it's lonesome
But it ain't no big ride
The horses are helpless
Young child fixin' to die
It's cold and it's lonesome
Ain't no second-in-command
Go where you will now fate's on the land

You who rule people are princes and kings
See my body is open see my father lay waste
Fly swift as an eagle take comfort from that
And child fixin' to die now
My little boy's time has come
You who rule people eternally free
Of robbing your prisoners
Take a lesson from me
It's cold and it's lonesome
But it ain't no big ride
The horses are helpless
Young child fixin' to die

The horses are helpless
Young child fixin' to die
