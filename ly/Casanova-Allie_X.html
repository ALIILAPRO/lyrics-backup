		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm here dancing on the edge of the night
I'm sleepwalking with a hand full of blue dice
One Hail Mary for the hole in my heart
I'm outside waiting for your love on the boulevard

You're a heavenly creature
With a real dark agenda
You can turn a believer
To a damn dirty sinner
Am I having a seizure?
'Cause I'm shaking up with fear
But I know, yeah, I know that

You're no Casanova
Got to let you go
Hit me on my blind side
Left me on the floor
Now I can see the bright light
Body getting cold
There's something 'bout your touch that
I can't leave alone

Casanova fucked me over
Left me dying for your love
Casanova, Casanova
Now you're all I'm thinking of

Casanova fucked me over
Left me dying for your love
Casanova, Casanova
Now you're all I'm thinking of

I'm here lying on the bed of your tongue
My heart listens to the sound of your war drum
Steady tiptoeing to your neck of the woods
I feel danger on your lips but it tastes good

You're a heavenly creature
With a real dark agenda
You can turn a believer
To a damn dirty sinner
Am I having a seizure?
'Cause I'm shaking up with fear
But I know, yeah, I know that

You're no Casanova
Got to let you go
Hit me on my blind side
Left me on the floor
Now I can see the bright light
Body getting cold
There's something 'bout your touch that
I can't leave alone

Casanova fucked me over
Left me dying for your love
Casanova, Casanova
Now you're all I'm thinking of

Casanova fucked me over
Left me dying for your love
Casanova, Casanova
Now you're all I'm thinking of

No one's walking the line like you
Blowing smoke in my eyes like you
I got nothing to hide, let me kiss you to die
No one's giving me life like you

You're no Casanova
Got to let you go
Hit me on my blind side
Left me on the floor
Now I can see the bright light
Body getting cold
There's something 'bout your touch that
I can't leave alone

Casanova fucked me over (you're no Casanova)
Left me dying for your love
Casanova, Casanova
Now you're all I'm thinking of

Casanova fucked me over (you're no Casanova)
Left me dying for your love
Casanova, Casanova
Now you're all I'm thinking of

Casanova fucked me over (you're no Casanova)
Left me dying for your love
Casanova, Casanova
Now you're all I'm thinking of

Casanova fucked me over (you're no Casanova)
Left me dying for your love
Casanova, Casanova
Now you're all I'm thinking of

Casanova fucked me over
Now you're all I'm thinking of
