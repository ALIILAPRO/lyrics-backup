		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every time you try to break me (down)
I feel my heart decaying
Every time you try to break me down

Taste you and I breathe so deep
Heart beats hard, my knees go weak
Mouth glued shut and I can't speak
Why does fear make me complete?
Little more lust and some addiction
I fell in love for a quick minute
Trying to cope with self-infliction
Drinking 'til I'm incoherent

Every time you try to break me
I feel my heart decaying
Every time you try to break me down

Down
Down
Down
Break me down

You make my head spin crazy
You make my world go black
Even when my life gets hazy
I don't wanna die
A little more wind from a little more speed
Tryna hold on, but it's pullin' me
Side effects, they're killin' me
Side effects, they're killin' me

Every time you try to break me
I feel my heart decaying
Every time you try to break me down

Down
Down
Down
Break me down

Little more lust and some addiction
I fell in love for a quick minute
Trying to cope with self-infliction
Drinking 'til I'm incoherent

Down
