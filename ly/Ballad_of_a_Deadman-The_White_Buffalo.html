		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The moon lights up over the battlefield now
With a blistering heat somehow
Lifeless limp and broken hearts are dead
They should have just stayed home instead
Stayed alive

Well the letter arrives and glistens a mother's eyes
She wonders where when and why
She could have tucked him in his bed
With a kiss on the cheek and his head
He'd still lie

Well the moon and the stars can't cast shadows on what is wrong
Well our boys are dead
They've been misled
Nothing more

The sun wakes up
Brings sparkles in the morning light
Rubs her belly bows her head to cry
She lost him before they were wed
But he's there in her heart and her head
He'll stay alive

Oh the moon and the stars can't cast shadows on what is wrong
Well our boys are dead
They've been misled
Nothing more

Well the moon and the stars can't cast shadows on what is wrong
Well our boys are dead
They've been misled
Nothing more

The moon lights up, over the battlefield now
