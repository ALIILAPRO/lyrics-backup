		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  R-T-motherfuckin'-J
R-T-J
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, hey)
Ayy (hey, oh)
Ayy (oh, hey, oh)
Ayy

I swallow all my drugs 'til the pain is unplugged
When the laws of entropy touch, you better dread the judge
Wiser men than us been crushed to fine dust
When the fortune cookie tell me I'm fucked, I just shrug
A note like a broken electrical pulse hum
For the done, for the scum of the circuitry on the run
Haven't seen the sun with the naked eye much
So the neon is my God and it shine on the numb
Hop off of the bike, gun cocked, okay, ready
Work ain't been too steady, I'm headed for something heavy
If you got the credits, I'll pull the crime of the century
Morality's only a memory when belly's empty
Swine get they hive mind focused on taking mine
Get in line, swine, you won't deny me my piece of pie
Any fucker in this broke future that they designed
Don't comply? I'll supply you deletion, the end is nigh

(Hey, oh)
(Oh, hey, oh)
(Run the Jewels, Run the Jewels, Run the Jewels)

I-I-I used to pray to God, but I think he took a vacation
'Cause now the state of Cali is ran by these corporations
The skyscrapers shadow the homeless, the population
The degradation they face, which should be an abomination
They body parts is stolen and sold to the richest patient
And we the mercenaries at war with the active agents
The legislators that work for the sadists that kill the babies
That die in the back of a bullet-riddled Mercedes ('Cedes)
Just to serve (serve), murdered them and the chauffeur ('feur)
Hit pump of herb (herb), then my brain exit the Earth (earth)
That's righteous, huh? (Huh) Slapping palm, holding a pump (pump)
Keanu Reeves, cyber arm under my sleeve (sleeve)
I blast 'em all, watch 'em fall like autumn leaves
Damn it, I can't leave, Night City keep calling me
Goddamn it, I'm a G, and this fuck shit is all it need
Life a fucking bitch, but this bitch ain't divorcing me (nuh-uh)
