		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm an ordinary man
Who desires nothing more than just an ordinary chance
To live exactly as he likes and do precisely what he wants
An average man am I, of no eccentric whim
Who likes to live his life free of strife
Doing whatever he thinks is best for him
Well, just an ordinary man

But, let a woman in your life 
And your serenity is through
She'll redecorate your home, from the cellar to the dome
And then go on to the enthralling fun of overhauling you

Let a woman in your life
And you're up against a wall
Make a plan and you will find she has something else in mind
And so rather than do either, you do something else that neither likes at all 

You want to talk of Keats or Milton
She only wants to talk of love
You go to see a play or ballet
And spend it searching for her glove

Let a woman in your life 
And you invite eternal strife
Let them buy their wedding bands 
For those anxious little hands
I'd be equally as willing 
For a dentist to be drilling 
Than to ever let a woman in my life

I'm a very gentle man
Even-tempered and good-natured who you never hear complain 
Who has the milk of human kindness by the quart in every vein
A patient man am I, down to my fingertips
The sort who never would, never could
Let an insulting remark escape his lips 
A very gentle man

But, let a woman in your life
And patience hasn't got a chance
She will beg you for advice, your reply will be concise
And she'll listen very nicely, and then go out and do precisely what she wants

You are a man of grace and polish
Who never spoke above a hush
Now all at once you're using language 
That would make a sailor blush

Let a woman in your life
And you're plunging in a knife
Let the others of my sex tie the knot around their necks
I prefer a new edition of the Spanish Inquisition 
Than to ever let a woman in my life 

I'm a quiet living man
Who prefers to spend the evening in the silence of his room
Who likes an atmosphere as restful as an undiscovered tomb
A pensive man am I of philosophical joys
Who likes to meditate, contemplate
Free from humanity's mad inhuman noise
Just a quiet living man

But, let a woman in your life
And your sabbatical is through
In a line that never ends comes an army of her friends
Come to jabber and to chatter 
And to tell her what the matter is with you!

She'll have a booming boisterous family
Who will descend on you en mass
She'll have a large wagnarian mother
With a voice that shatters glass
Let a woman in your life
Let a woman in your life

I shall never let a woman in my life
