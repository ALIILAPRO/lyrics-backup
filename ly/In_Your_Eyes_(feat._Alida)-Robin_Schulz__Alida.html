		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hearing whispers in the night
Voices filling up your mind
You're like a ghost of you
You've been drowning in the rain
Slowly saving up the pain
So deep inside of you

See the colors of the sky
Slowly turn from black and white
A rising hope, bright as gold
And now there's nothing left to lose
So we're breaking all the rules
And they don't know what we know

'Cause I can hear the thunder from afar
A lightning in the dark
I can feel a fire come alive
So calm before the storm
So dark before the dawn

Oh, I can see the fire in your eyes (oh)
In your eyes (oh)
Oh, I can see the fire in your eyes (oh)
In your eyes (oh)
Oh, I can see the fire in your eyes
Oh, I can see the fire in your eyes

Now you'll never be the same
Once you felt that burning flame
You're chasing stars alive
What was broken's left behind
Watch it crumble in the light
Nothing can stop you now

See the colors of the sky
Slowly turn from black and white
A rising hope, bright as gold
And now there's nothing left to lose
So we're breaking all the rules
And they don't know what we know, whoa

'Cause I can hear the thunder from afar
A lightning in the dark
I can feel a fire come alive
So calm before the storm
So dark before the dawn

Oh, I can see the fire in your eyes (oh)
In your eyes (oh)
Oh, I can see the fire in your eyes (oh)
In your eyes 
Oh, I can see the fire in your eyes 
Oh, I can see the fire in your eyes (oh)
Eh-yeah (oh)

Oh, I can see the fire in your eyes (oh)
(In your eyes) (oh)
Oh, I can see the fire in your eyes (oh)
(In your eyes) 
Oh, I can see the fire in your eyes
