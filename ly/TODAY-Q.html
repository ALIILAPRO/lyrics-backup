		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh-ooh-ooh

Some days, the pain still stays
Makes you feel, helplessness
Time again, away from friends
Isolation settles in
Someday we'll be good I
Pray, but how far away's someday?

Some days, I make mistakes
Countless talkin' about myself
Time again, I stay away
Much confusion, settles in, oh
Some days, I fall
But I will press towards the future one day

It gets hard for me to breathe sometimes
It gets hard for me to breathe
In a world where (oh) I cannot see (ah)
What is wrong with me
Lord, help me

Some days, I make the same mistakes
It gets complicated quickly 
When it starts to feel in vain
Then I just go to my vices
That makes me aware
Of everything that makes me numb
And I just hold it in my chest
But will I ever get a time
When I'll be alright to be all by myself?
My, ohh, my
Some days I let it be
But I'm underneath my sheets cryin' out
Out, yeah, I

Constant pressure
But I press on for the future some day
Ha
Constant anger
But I press on for the future one day
Ooh-ooh
Oh, constant anxious
But I press on for the future one day
And I pray that day will come today
