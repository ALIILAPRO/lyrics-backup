		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it true that
When it's over
Nothing will change
Is it true that
Thinking over
Will lead to pain

So be it in my dreams
I'll find you all over
So be it in my dreams
I'll find you all over

As it happens
Not much happens
When you're not around
Signs delivered
Peace had withered
Mind my hopes the same

So I'll take solace in your trust
Find a reason to not think of it

So be it in my dreams
(Not much matters anymore)
I'll find you all over
(Not much matters anymore)
So be it in my dreams
(Not much matters anymore)
I'll find you all over
(Not much matters anymore)
So be it in my dreams
(Not much matters anymore)
I'll find you all over
(Not much matters anymore)
So be it in my dreams
(Not much matters anymore)
I'll find you all over
