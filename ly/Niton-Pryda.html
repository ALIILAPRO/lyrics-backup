		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are the reason why 
Years fly by, and I don't find 
The strength I need to grow 
I know, I know 

Enemies, they stand in line 
I'm on my knees, and I can't find 
The words I to let you know 
I know, I know, I know 

You are the reason why 
Years fly by, and I don't find 
The strength I need to grow 
I know, I know 

Enemies, they stand in line 
I'm on my knees, and I can't find 
The words I to let you know 
I know, I know, I know 

You are the reason why
You are the reason why
You are the reason why
You are the reason why
You are the reason why
You are the reason why
You are the reason why
You are the reason why
