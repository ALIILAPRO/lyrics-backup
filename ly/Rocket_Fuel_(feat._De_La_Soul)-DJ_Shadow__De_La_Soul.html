		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ladies and gentlemen
Ladies and gentlemen

Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Get ready, y'all
Get ready

Ready, set
Steady, bet
Get ready
Ready, set
Steady, bet
Get ready

This be the green light, go, tires burn the pavement
People wanna know where Mase, Pos' and Dave went
Still here, still in ya ear 
With a style so hot, you'll see where all the sun rays went
Legs, arms, and head all being moved in a frenzy
The blends we all the right cred'
Meaning credentials
Best of both worlds
When we rocking over pearls in the instrumental

Are you ready? (Ready) set? (Set)
Jump to the rhythm as hard as you can go
Keep it steady (steady), to the let it rock (bet)
Turn it up, we giving a show
But can you rock it like rocket fuel?
What you talking 'bout? Space or out your mind?
But can you rock it like rocket fuel?
That's a close encounter, of what kind?

I'm a disc jockey
What's a disc jockey?

When it was time to get it lit we got it hot like fever
Sick with the talk, pass to your receiver
All a'bout running the spot
And you know we got breath control so no need to take a breather
Cardio kingpins
Subjugate the dubplate
And you know we can't wait to bring spins
Aced all quizzes, A-plussed the final
Vocals we align' we move it all simultaneously 
Over joints, we rock
We earned, thirty years
And you can say we got, three terms
Live off the board, armed like you and your chest men
When you stormed out and you and your yes men
And if the game have veins we'll insert the yeah
Upheaval the ground
'Cause the adrenaline we blend with the sound
Is our thing, we leaving the kings of all crown

So are you ready? (Ready) are you set? (Set)
Then jump to the rhythm as hard as you can go
Keep it steady (steady), to the let it rock (bet)
Turn it up, yo and peep the flow
But can you rock it like rocket fuel?
What you talking 'bout? Space or out your mind?
But can you rock it like rocket fuel?
That's a close encounter, of what kind?

Ready, set
Steady, bet
Then jump to the rhythm as hard as you can go
Turn it up, yo and peep the flow

Are you ready? (Ready) set? (Set)
Jump to the rhythm as hard as you can go
Keep it steady (steady), to the let it rock (bet)
Turn it up, we giving a show
But can you rock it like rocket fuel?
What you talking 'bout? Space or out your mind?
But can you rock it like rocket fuel?
That's a close encounter, of what kind?

Ready, set
Steady, bet
But can you rock it like rocket fuel?
