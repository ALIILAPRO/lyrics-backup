		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All my life they making me crazy
All my life they calling me baby
All my life they wanna come save me
All my life
Men 
Men
Men
Fuck men

Verse 1
We coming for the throats like ooo
Now you wanna gloat like ooo
Thought you was a goat boy shoo
We don't need a man like You
Insecure insecure insecure
Ego trip on the bitch ego drip like a clit
Selfish, secretive, possessive, condescending 
Even when I cum I'm pretending 
I'm not crazy you was cheating
You not famous you a fetus
Projecting on me like you Jesus
Money make you wanna keep us

Chorus
All my life they making me crazy
All my life they calling me baby
All my life they wanna come save me
All my life
Men 
Men
Men
Fuck men

Oh you wanna leave him but you can't get past it
Oh you wanna tell him why he should just
shove it
But you keep believing that he's gonna change from it
Almost had your freedom but he just won't have it
Nothing's gonna change boo
He's not gonna change for you 
Nothing's gonna change boo
He's not gonna change for you 

If you want to leave him
There's something you should know
Men, they're all the same
So just let go

Chorus
All my life they making me crazy
All my life they calling me baby
All my life they wanna come save me
All my life
Men 
Men
Men
Fuck men
