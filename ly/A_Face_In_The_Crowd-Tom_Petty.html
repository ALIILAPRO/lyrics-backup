		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Before all of this ever went down
In another place, another town
You were just a face in the crowd
You were just a face in the crowd
Out in the street walking around
A face in the crowd

Out of a dream, out of the sky
Into my heart, into my life

And you were just a face in the crowd
You were just a face in the crowd
Out in the street, thinking out loud
A face in the crowd

Out of a dream, out of the sky
Into my heart, into my life

And you were just a face in the crowd
You were just a face in the crowd
Out in the street, walking around
A face in the crowd
Face in the crowd
A face in the crowd
A face in the crowd
