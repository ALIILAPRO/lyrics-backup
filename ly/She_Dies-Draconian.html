		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The cold winds blew into life, my adored. 
A bleeding heart we share, now on Azrael?s wings. 

I fall like autumn rain? 
You are my everything. 

This lovelorn kiss of death in lugubrious silence? 
Dawn breaks open like a wound? and the dreadful sun 

Two souls entwined together, 
Still so alone. 
Both you and I are shattered 
And frozen in stone. 

You begged for air from within this cold tomb 
With pain sharp as a knife. 
I now lie resting like a child on thy womb, 
Gave back a part of my life. 

For a while it had disappeared, but nothing was changed. 
A haze fell forever with her fading life. 
I leaned my head back? then drank of opaline. 
The emerald goddess came to me? she craved my soul. 
And just for a while? I had forgotten. 

Yes, it was all forgotten, but nothing was changed. 
Suddenly a cold breeze blew across our room? 
It felt like I wanted to leave? this world with her. 

Come; drink with me the divine nectar of Olympus! 
Sit beside me and help defy our adversity and loss? 
This adversity and loss. It all ends with you! 

I kiss you in your dying breath; sleeping quietly now. 
Swept away by heavy eyelids; forever in my dreams? 
And you will be safe in my dearest dreams? 
My love? forever in my dearest dreams.
