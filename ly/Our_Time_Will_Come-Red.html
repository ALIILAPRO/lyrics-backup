		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When all our days turn to night
Echoes only left of where we hide
And you save so many lives
But never got around to save yourself
And you see the way you wanted it to go
Always waiting 'cause you never know
Never know

Someday our time is gonna come
Don't waste your life til it's over
Someday our time is gonna come
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust

Hear the cold voice of your life
Haunting like an enemy inside
Dragging under falling further
Crossing hearts with a hope to die

Someday our time is gonna come
Don't waste your life til it's over
Someday our time is gonna come
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust

Our time will come

Someday our time is gonna come
Don't waste your life til it's over
Someday our time is gonna come
Ashes to ashes

Someday our time is gonna come
Don't waste your life til it's over
Someday our time is gonna come
Ashes to ashes
