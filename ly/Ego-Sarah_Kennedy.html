		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby stroke my ego
Will you tell me please?
And watch my heart take ahold of me
Baby stroke my ego
Will you kiss my pride?
And watch the lights change inside my eyes
If you hold on to me tight
I'll take you down with me tonight
Show you things you wouldn't like to see but you would like to be
If I could walk into your mind
Take your hand and show you mine
Show you things you wouldn't like to see but you would like to be
Baby stroke my ego
Say it from your knees
Some say it's evil
I say it's me
Baby lose your patience
Take what you need
See it's fine to be like me
If you hold on to me tight
I'll take you down with me tonight
Show you things you wouldn't like to see
But you would like to be
If I could walk into your mind
Take your hand and show you mine
Show you things you wouldn't like to see
But you would like to be
Baby stroke my
