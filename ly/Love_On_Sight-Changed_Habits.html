		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  been playing in the same spot where i saw you once
hoping to see you
pass by another 4me
i waited there forever
to see your face again maybe it's for the best yeah I should forget you anyways
well I
don't know why I fall so easy in love easy in love with you girl
oh oh oh oh oh
the other day at your recep4on
you smiled at me - melted my heart i showed you some of my songs offered you cigare=es outside
the in4macy we had for the moment could have lasted for the night
then you told me that your boyfriend carries the same name as I
well I
don't know
why I fall so
easy in love
easy in love
with the wrong girls
oh i can't help it i can't find it
true love seems to be hiding from me oh i can't help it i can't find it
true love seems to be hiding from me yeah yeah
true love
