		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Digitize burn my eyes
Keep me from falling oâ€™ Keep me alive
The sensitive mind is not of this time
Not of this time not of this time

Mass media mental hysteria
I'm lost on the web close to extinction
Lost in this matrix of death and destruction
Lost in this matrix of death and destruction
Give me a cure give me a potion
Help me recover from this deadly devotion
I don't want to die in this digital ocean
Don't want to die in this digital ocean

Superficial ego collapse
Trapped in a make up store
Waiting for my new mac

I choke in my suit of latex
I choke in my suit of latex
