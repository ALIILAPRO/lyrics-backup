Rich Gang

Baby, let me know if I'm outta time
Baby, let me know if I'm outta line
Tryna do my best to prove you on my mind
Might be too late
I might've crossed the line, yeah (yeah, yeah, oh-oh)

Without you, baby, no I can't get right (uh-oh)
I realize why you ain't in my life (uh-oh)
I messed it up, I know I crossed the line, mmh (yeah)

I was out spendin' my money 
And fuckin' these bitches, not worrying 'bout you
I was out lyin' and you was home cryin' 
'Cause I wasn't tellin' the truth
I was out winnin' with too many women 
And I didn't know how to choose
I gave my baby the blues
Can't buy her heart with no coupe
How did I end up in this situation?
Did my best to give you love and dedication (love)
Now you on the phone talking 'bout replacement
I just can't believe what the hell I'm facin', no

Messin' with the handles, dropped the ball
Now she never answer when I call
And everybody knows it's my fault

Baby, let me know if I'm outta time (if I'm outta time)
Baby, let me know if I'm outta line (if I'm outta line)
Tryna do my best to prove you on my mind (you're on my mind)
Might be too late, I might've crossed the line (Rich Gang)

Without you, baby, no I can't get right (uh-oh, Rich Gang)
I realize why you ain't in my life (uh-oh)
I messed it up, I know I cross the line, mmh
