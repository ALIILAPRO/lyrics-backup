		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Them niggas gotta hear what the fuck I'm talkin' 'bout (woo, woo)
(I be in New York)
Feel me, Lil' Z? 
On your set with some real shit, nigga (I be in New York with the gangsters)
(Swirv)
I don't want none of that extra loud shit
This ain't none of that rainbow hair shit
Know what I'm sayin'? (I be in New York with the gangsters)
This the real streets shit, yeah, nigga (I be in New York with the gangsters)
Fuckin' voice of the streets, man
It's like Jesus walkin' (oozin' automatics)
More like Christopher Walking, man (I be with the straights and the apes)
Y'all know what's up (talkin' stone to stone)
(Runnin' backs, we don't wanna hear nothin' 'bout it)
Free all my niggas, free all the streets

I be in New York with the gangsters
Know a nigga that'll shoot you for a 'Tander (grrt)
If my opps is chillin' in the foreign (bah)
Then my niggas shootin' up the Phantom (bah, bah, bah)
I be in New York with the gangsters (woo)
Know a nigga that'll shoot you for a 'Tander (bah)
If my opps is chillin' in the foreign (you lackin' ass niggas)
Then my niggas shootin' up the Phantom (grrt)

.44 got a kickback (bah)
Click-clack, get back (bah)
Shots at your rib pack (grrt)
Or you can get chin checked (woo)
Them twirlin' niggas actin' up (actin' up)
So niggas packed him up (pack him up)
Brazy was actin' tough (three)
'Til niggas slapped him up (pussy)
Pop Smoke on top (haha)
Niggas mad as fuck (mad)
Six by six, big Benz on my wrist (grrt)
If you don't got your nails done, you are not it (woo)
Automatically on the blocked list (blocked, bitch)
Niggas talkin' 'bout they guns (guns), but never shot shit (cap)
Might as well put a cap on it, all over with a chopstick (pussy)
Run up and I'm brandin' them, take a nigga shoppin' (bitch)
Reach and I'm branchin' it 'cause I don't know who watchin' (I'm on point)
It's a ginger ale and Henny day, eased up on the crème brûlée (hahaha)
.38's on the block (block), a nigga won't hesitate (bah)
Had to move these bitches up (move up) 'cause they was in the way
I wouldn't want them to get shot by an enemy

I be in New York with the gangsters (and what's up?)
Know a nigga that'll shoot you for a 'Tander (grrt)
If my opps is chillin' in the foreign (bah)
Then my niggas shootin' up the Phantom (bah, bah, bah)
I be in New York with the gangsters (woo)
Know a nigga that'll shoot you for a 'Tander (bah)
If my opps is is chillin' in the foreign (you lackin' ass niggas)
Then my niggas shootin' up the Phantom (grrt)
