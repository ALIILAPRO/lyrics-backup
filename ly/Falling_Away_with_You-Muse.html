		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't remember when it was good
Moments of happiness in bloom
Maybe I just misunderstood
All of the love we left behind
Watching our flash backs intertwine
Memories I will never find
In spite of whatever you become
Forget that reckless thing turned on
I think our lives have just begun
I think our lives have just begun

And I'll feel my world crumbling down
Feel my life crumbling now
Feel my soul crumbling away
Falling away
Falling away with you

Staying awake to chase a dream
Tasting the air you're breathing in
I hope I won't forgot a thing
I wish to hold you close and pray
Watching our fantasies decay
Nothing will ever stay the same
And all of the love we threw away
And all of the hopes we've cherished fade
Making the same mistakes again
Making the same mistakes again

And I'll feel my world crumbling down
Feel my life crumbling now
Feel my soul crumbling away
And falling away
Falling away with you

All of the love we left behind
Watching our flash backs intertwine
Memories I will never find
Memories I will never find
