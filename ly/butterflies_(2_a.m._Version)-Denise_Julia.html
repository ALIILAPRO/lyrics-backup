		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  we been on some dumb shit lately
finding love in the worst place to be
different dudes in the party
Finding no truth 
'Cause they lyin

hitttin up girls but you want me
so i entertain em boys say im lonely
but i figured i need real i hate empty
want a real thing 
not some dumb fling

is it simply the buzz from the liquor?
butterflies on your neck make me quiver
is it true cause i hear all the rumors

but i gotta ask
how u make me act like this oh no?
how u make me act like this oh no?
how u make me trip like this oh no?
tho this aint new to me
i aint used to this

Lookin at u boy i see that you're one of a kind
Tatted up, a pretty smile
Your body buff, your sleezy lines
Player playin all his games
But i see thru u and your fade
Yeah you fuckboy and your chains
They aint gon make me run away

But have u had a girl like me
Give a taste of loyalty?
Have u had a girl like me no, no, no

but i gotta ask
how u make me act like this oh no?
how u make me act like this oh no?
how u make me trip like this oh no?
tho this aint new to me
i aint used to this

Used to this fantasy, no
Used to this fallacy
I aint used to
I aint used to this
