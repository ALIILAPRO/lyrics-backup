		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If my girl only knew that you was tryin'
What would she, what would she do?
If my girl only knew that you was tryin'
What would she, what would she?

Reach out to me
Sometimes, boy, I wish you would
I'm wonderin' if I should
I'll pull up, bring it to yo' hood
'Cause I've been missin' you
And he been comin' through
Just something keep my interest up
Boy, I hate when shits like this
Make me all insecure, wasted
'Cause you know you ain't never gave what I give

You ain't innocent
You ain't innocent, boy
You ain't innocent, innocent, boy (boy, yeah)
Innocent
You ain't innocent, boy (innocent)
You ain't innocent, innocent, boy

If my girl only knew that you was tryin'
What would she, what would she?

Reach out to me
You know I wish you would
I will pull up with nothing nice to try
(You know that them other boys can't do it like I do)
She been comin' through
Fillin' in for you
So we both got a playlist
You know what the saying is
That's just what the game is, yeah
Ooh, I hate when shit gets like this
You get all insecure and venomous
Talkin' 'bout I ain't never gave what you give
But hold up

You ain't innocent
You ain't innocent, girl
You ain't innocent, innocent, girl (boy)
Innocent
You ain't innocent, girl (innocent)
You ain't innocent, innocent, girl

If my girl only knew that you was tryin'
What would she, what would she do?

Oh, no, boy
Ooh, yeah
Oh, no, oh-oh
You ain't innocent, no
You ain't innocent, no
