		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can feel a pleasure, that's the pain
When I die, I died in vain
I can hear sweet temptations come
Come with me and we will fall

Ecstasy, misunderstood
Will you dance with me
As if I should?
And in the morning
The sun will shine
Still I can't shake her
Get out of my mind

I can feel it rushing through my veins
After they withdraw the pain
This must be the essence of it all
Stay with me and we will fall

Ecstasy misunderstood
Will you dance with me
As if I should?
And in the morning
The sun will shine
Still I can't shake her
Get out of my mind

Look you made me do this to myself

Ecstasy, misunderstood
Will you dance with me
As if I should
And in the morning
The sun will shine
Still I can't shake her
Get out of my mind
