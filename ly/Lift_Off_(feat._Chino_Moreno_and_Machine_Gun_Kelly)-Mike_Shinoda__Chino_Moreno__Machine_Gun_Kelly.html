		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lift off like Virgin Galactic
My Richard's too Branson, to fuck with you bastard
Very legendary, that's a matter of fact
Shit, you're the opposite of star
Like rats spelled backwards
I flow poems out to Saturn and passed it
Easy as a standard anti-gravity back flip
Satellite tracking can't map up my tactics
I spit the same shit they split an atom in half with
No, it's not what I want but it had to be
I spent 6 months just recharging my battery
Imagine me quitting, what a travesty that'd be
Your space shuttle challenges are nothing but tragedies
So take care on the path that you're headed
I'm the father to your style, don't you ever forget it
I don't drop mics, only let it smoke or I said it
And I don't play even when they press it, get it?

I'm off of the earth, I'll ride alone
I'm drifting away, out of time, I flow
Away from the truth, 
away from the night
Away from the day
I'm off of the earth, I'll ride alone

Please brace for impact
I must have went to space and got sent back
But I'm still intact, in fact, take a picture of me
You can see that I'm a star with your lens cracked
Supernova, it's Caesar's palace stuntin' on my apartments
'Cause history'll show, we done been to war like Romans
Did that dance with the devil, hail high as a kettle
So it's no wonder why I put this ice on all of my metal
We'll wear that shit like a medal, used to think I was a joker
No Jared Leto when I said I'd get us out the ghetto
Slam my foot on the pedal, put the studio
And I couldn't afford instrumentals
Fuck it, record a cappella
Flying coach streaming Coachella until they ban me
Now they like Bambi's mother's, dead, I'm onto these Grammy's
I'm rolling these grams gladly, purple and green like dabbie
Shades on like Velma, hair long like Shaggy
Crushin' addies in my water, got my voice raspy
Haven't slept since California and that shit was last week
Paranoid when I sleep but when I'm high I'm happy
That's what I need to kiss the sky when I get stuck in the valley
Lift off

I'm off of the earth, I'll ride alone
I'm drifting away, out of time, I flow
Away from the truth
away from the night
Away from the day
I'm off of the earth, I'll ride alone
