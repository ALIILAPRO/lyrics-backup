		  (Let's go, Nobel)
I'll be the help, I don't mind
(It's 3AM somewhere)

I stepped in
I ain't want you to be betrayed by my friends
It's on me, all lies on me in the end
Gotta be real, it's so hard to be pretend
To be sorry as a man
Make apologies, but you happen to just vent
Tell me your stories, I always got a helpin' hand
Guts and glory gon' take you always to the end

The friendship'll never last when you peep a circle
I got you every single time like a reservice
My mind based on gettin' mines, that's the least worries
My shooters got 'em on the hook, they like the street Irwin
They don't wanna see you eat, they wanna see you buried
Really come up from the streets, remember bein' dirty
Gotta show all I can be, I represented early
When they sit and do you wrong, you can't believe it's versions
It's two of them in sight, I'm goin' like a knight
I tell you somethin' about my life, you probably wan' cry
I really tell you how I hurt, Lil Boo don't die
I'll never be the only one keepin' you in mind

I stepped in
I ain't want you to be betrayed by my friends
It's on me, all lies on me in the end
Gotta be real, it's so hard to be pretend
To be sorry as a man
Make apologizes, but you happen to just vent
Tell me your stories, I always got a helpin' hand
Guts and glory gon' take you always to the end

You came to me at the wrong time, I was chasin' money
Who'd have thought they'd be a fake, shit, I did 'em nothin'
I'll never fuck up my relations, I'd be a dummy
I re-did my rotations all of a sudden
I already know what they gon' say if I need money
It ain't the same somedays, I proceed from it
I told her I need space and she ain't even comin'
I'm busy goin' through some things, but I keep runnin'
It's pain on pain
Every little thing, I'll name it
You can be wild, there's a chance at survival
Still won't betray my main friend

I stepped in
I ain't want you to be betrayed by my friends
It's on me, all lies on me in the end
Gotta be real, it's so hard to be pretend
To be sorry as a man
Make apologizes, but you happen to just vent
Tell me your stories, I always got a helpin' hand
Guts and glory gon' take you always to the end
