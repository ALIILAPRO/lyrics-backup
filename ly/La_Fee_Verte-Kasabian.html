		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh green fairy what you done to me!
I see Lucy in the sky!
Telling me I'm high
I went out for some milk three days ago
I met Dali in the street
He knocked me off my feet

Now I start to see that all's not well
There's police men in my bed
Telling me I'm dead
If only I could show them what I'd seen
I'll have to take you down below
Where insects run the show

Sound and vision
Turning inside out
The lines make you look older 
Then you're gone

And every day 
I've got someone bringing me down
I've got the eyes of a mad man 
I'm chasing round

How does it feel 
To live your life where nothing is real
So just send me
Down the river

The neighbours say that I need locking up
Well they wouldn't be the first
To want me in a hearse

No one sleeps for I am still awake
Pass me over la f√©e vert
I'll give you all a scare

Dogs in heaven 
Every one's a star
You look behind your eyelids
Then your gone

And every day 
I've got someone bringing me down
I've got the eyes of a mad man
I'm chasing round

How does it feel 
To live your life where nothing is real
So just send me
Down the river

I'm not gonna wait for tomorrow 
I'll just look back and wait for a sign
I'm not gonna celebrate my freedom
So just send me
Down the river

Every day
I've got some one bringing me down
I've got the eyes of a mad man
I can't look round

How does it feel 
To live your life where nothing is real
So just send me
Down the river
