		  Smurkio, I went 2.0, I can't stop nothin'
(The Melody)
Smurkio, I went 2.0, I can't stop nothin' (DJ on the beat so it's a banger)

I'ma give it to 'em on another level
We on some other shit
Man, what?

Swappin' murder weapons, this bitch too clean, must be the block gun (go, go)
I can count yo' shots with a clear clip, this a black drum (brrah)
Knew you niggas was different, your mans booked and he ain't got nothin' (he ain't got nothin')
LA killer asked can I pay for his lawyer, I should've stabbed him (should've stabbed)
Them my baby threats, but they lil' brothers, they some rascals (go, they some rascals)
I know you my brother, I ask for money, you made it a hassle (yeah, yeah)
High like Adderalls, them overshaped, somethin' like the capsules (go, somethin' like the capsules)
Fuck her from the back, I grab her throat, she tryna wrestle (go, go, come here)
Died in front of yo' bitch, she could've saved you, she had a tampon (go, mhm-mhm)
I'm the only reason you still alive, you better believe it (go, mhm-mhm)
I be smokin' dope gas, bro roll up the Chevron (dope)
I done gave 'em money, they bought some cars and weed and Hemron (go, yeah)
Keep it P, we ain't run our mouth to no block, this shit Lamron (this shit Lamron, nigga)
Say you ain't the jakes, but talk to rats all on your platform (this shit Lamron, nigga)
I go hit for hit with your biggest rapper, he only got one (uh, yeah)
I can go money for money with your biggest rapper, but he ain't got none (go, go)

I'm the only thing in the way, they tryna slide on me (tryna slide on me)
Lil' bro thirsty to pop out with the Drac', he ain't find one (he ain't find one)
Told lil' bro I want niggas with names (go), he ain't find one (he ain't find one)
Ask yo' block who they catch with a name, they ain't find one (let's get it, go)

Fuck you thought? (Go)
You can't blame me, I done put in too much work (yeah, yeah)
Fuck you thought? (Yeah)
Only reason they know your name because of Durk (oh, yeah, yeah)
Fuck you thought? (Yeah)
You tryna slide just to slide, that shit don't work (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fuck you thought? (Yeah, man, what?)

You say dead niggas they say what's back, that shit a boomerang (go, go, go, pussy)
Don't go live around me, I'm in war, just make a boomerang (fan-ass niggas)
Hunnid K on veneers, I want a grill, I go to Johnny Dang (yeah)
I ain't drop no tears, I'm so serious, ask my mama, gang (ask my mama, nigga)
Credit was fucked up, I put my Rolls truck in my mama name (skrrt)
Tried to take a pipe case for my dawg and I was seventeen (want some more)
Lil' DOC, ain't even make it, I put my brother name (I'm on coke)
Hunnid bands, it's fallin' out every pocket, I need a rubber band (go, go)
Told Lil' Pooda, he better go get up with Mooda (go), but he ain't understand (yeah, yeah)
Ask Lil' Boona, that money ain't hit my account, I did the money dance (yeah, yeah)
Half the niggas I was fuckin' with 'cause they J Money friends
Goin' West, we damn near caught a flat, we stuck on Hermitage (go)
How you jump on Clubhouse, tell them niggas what your brother did? (Snitch-ass nigga)
Lawyer great, you should've seen they face, I gave her another ten (gettin' money, nigga)
I'm nothin' nice she ask, "Can I cum twice?" I think of another bitch (yeah)
Eleven kids, I claim my sister kids and all my brother kids (yeah, yeah, what?)

I'm the only thing in the way, they tryna slide on me (tryna slide on me)
Lil' bro thirsty to pop out with the Drac', he ain't find one (he ain't find one)
Told lil' bro I want niggas with names, he ain't find one (he ain't find one)
Ask yo' block who they catch with a name, they ain't find one (let's get it, go)

Fuck you thought? (Go)
You can't blame me, I done put in too much work (yeah, yeah)
Fuck you thought? (Yeah)
Only reason they know your name because of Durk (oh, yeah, yeah)
Fuck you thought? (Yeah)
You tryna slide just to slide, that shit don't work (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fuck you thought? (Man, what? Go, go)
