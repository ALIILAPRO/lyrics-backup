		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hair so smooth, black as coal
Aw baby the way you sway
You wear the dress so very blue 
That you take my blues away
She comes and goes that I know
She cums at least once a day
I can't resist I kiss you lips [sic]
You're my sexy Mexican maid

My angel girl she sings to me
Baby tell me this is not a dream
She's pushing me onto my knees
I'm prayin' to my baby she screams
Squeezing me so tight I cry
I'll low you 'till the day I die
Let me please get on my knees, I come alone

When I wake up in the morn
She greets me where I lay
I look outside to find that I's a bright and sunny day
So serene she gives to me my toast and marmalade
What more can I say she's my sexy Mexican maid

My angel girl she sings to me
Baby tell me this is not a dream
She's pushing me onto my knees
I'm prayin' to my baby she screams
Squeezing me so tight I cry
I'll low you 'till the day I die
Let me please get on my knees, I come alone

She puts me in a bubble bath 
She tickles me and I laugh
She washes me until I'm clean 
Then she does a little sexy dance
Happy to feel my hand go slap 
Upon her sexy ass
We make fun so very slow
Then we make it fast

My angel girl she sings to me
Baby tell me this is not a dream
She's pushing me onto my knees
I'm prayin' to my baby she screams
Squeezing me so tight I cry
I'll low you 'till the day I die
Let me please get on my knees, I come alone
