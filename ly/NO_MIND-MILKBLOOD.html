		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I don't pay no mind)
(I'ma chase that light)
(Don't know where this road is taking me, but)
(I don't pay no mind)
(I don't pay no mind)
(I'ma chase that light)
(Keep on moving, that's the remedy, so) (oh)

Dive in the uncharted
I'm just getting started
Got no fear to hide
When it's do or die
Day ones to my right
Give it to me black and white
Say I'm on the way they slide
(Ooh-ooh)

Ooh
I be schemin' in my sleep, my body's lucid
Quality control, nothin' diluted
I don't think about it, I just do it

I don't pay no mind
I don't pay no mind
I'ma chase that light
Don't know where this road is taking me, but
I don't pay no mind
I don't pay no mind
I'ma chase that light
Keep on moving, that's the remedy, so
I don't pay no mind

(I don't pay no mind)

(I don't pay no mind)

I'ma hit a 180
No road gonna take me
I don't let that phase me, yeah
Hit the gas, no waiting

Dirty when I ride
They won't find out
If they switchin' sides
Then it's lights out

Ooh
I be schemin' in my sleep, my body's lucid
Quality control, nothin' diluted
I don't think about it, I just do it

I don't pay no mind
I don't pay no mind
I'ma chase that light
Don't know where this road is taking me, but
I don't pay no mind
I don't pay no mind
I'ma chase that light
Keep on moving, that's the remedy, so
I don't pay no mind

(I don't pay no mind)
(I don't pay no mind)
(I don't pay no mind)

(I don't pay no mind)

(I don't pay no mind)
