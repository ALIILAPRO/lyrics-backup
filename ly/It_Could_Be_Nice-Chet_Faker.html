		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me the truth, do you love it?
When I take control, you can choose
I can help you, but you want to go, you got a groove
Let me love you, let me make you want to just move
What you like?

It could be nice
What you say?
It could be nice
What you say?
It could be nice
What you say?
It could be nice
What you say?

So put me to use, if you love it, let me work it
Tell me the truth, what's your burden?
Let me hold it
You're in the mood, let me love it
Let me make you whole again, blue
Closer, mm, closer

It could be nice (she's so)
What you say?
It could be nice (hey, yeah, hey, ooh)
What you say?
It could be nice (whoa)
What you say?
It could be nice
What you say?
