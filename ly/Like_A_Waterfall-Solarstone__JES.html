		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I surface from the haze
I see the real reasons why
It's over my head
It seems
When clearness takes its hold
Our whole world is gonna break
It's crumbling so easily

You are the only one, I want you to know
Who really got under my skin
So if I dare to try
I'll prove to you it's not a waste
And this is not our last goodbye

Those other thrills
'Cause I've got better places to go
Than out of my head, you see
I wanna take a taste
In this old violent light's chambers
They're burning me like gasoline

But you are the only one, I need you to know
You know I'm always there
So if I dare to try, I dare to try
I'll prove to you it's not a waste
And this is not our last goodbye

When I see a rainbow bleeding out of the sun
I feel my adrenaline before it's already begun
I tried to tell you but you never listen
But it all, it all pours out of me

like a waterfall
like a waterfall
It all pours out of me
