		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, three, four, get cha, get cha on the floor
Five, six, seven, eight, booty goin' bounce, let it levitate
Eyes on me, eyes on me, eyes
Eyes on me, eyes on me, eyes
Eyes on me, eyes on me, eyes
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Shining, shining, glitter blinding
Turning heads, yeah, I'm the type
Shimmer on my skin hypnotic, I'm on everybody's mind

I make them hearts beat, beat, beat
Turning heads all eyes on me
Look in to my soul, let the moment take control, yeah

Sparkle, color
Diamonds, eyes
Glow up, I'm a natural (glow up, I'm a natural), please say no, mas

One, two, three, four, get cha, get cha on the floor (ah)
Five, six, seven, eight, booty goin' bounce, let it levitate
Eyes on me, eyes on me, eyes
Eyes on me, eyes on me, eyes
Eyes on me, eyes on me, eyes
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Paris, Marrakech, let's go
I just wanna see those eyes sparkle (hoo)
Hold up, gotta let them all know
I'm done living in my shadow

Ooh, it's radiant, glow awaken it, ain't no stopping my shine
No debating it, it's my favorite, written all on my eyes, yeah

Sparkle, color
Diamonds, eyes
Glow up, I'm a natural (glow up, I'm a natural), please say no, mas

One, two, three, four, get cha, get cha on the floor (ah-huh)
Five, six, seven, eight, booty goin' bounce, let it levitate (hey)
Eyes on me, eyes on me, eyes
Eyes on me, eyes on me, eyes
Eyes on me, eyes on me, eyes
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Clutch
Stora
Gueliz
Kasbah
Babylone
Medina
Spotini

One, two, three, four, get cha, get cha on the floor
Five, six, seven, eight, booty goin' bounce, let it levitate
(Let's go) eyes on me, eyes on me, eyes (eyes on me)
Eyes on me, eyes on me, eyes (eyes on me)
Eyes on me, eyes on me, eyes (eyes on me)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
