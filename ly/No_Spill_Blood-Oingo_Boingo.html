		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (What is the law?) 
(What is the law?) 

Animals came from miles around 
So tired of walking so close toe the ground 
They needed a chance, that's what they said 
Life is better walking on two legs 
But they were in for a big surprise 
'Cause they didn't know the law! 

CHORUS 
(What is the law) 
No spill blood 
What is the law 
(No spill blood) 

(Who makes the rules) 
Someone else 
Who makes the rules 
(Someone else) 

The rules are written in the stone 
Break the rules and you get no bones 
All you get is ridicule, laughter 
And a trip to the house of pain! 

CHORUS (in reverse order) 

We walk on two legs not on four 
To walk on four legs breaks the law 
What happens when we break the law? 
What happens when the rules aren't fair? 
We all know here we go from there 
To the house of pain! 
To the house of pain! 

(What is the law) 
What is the law 

(Who makes the rules) 
Who makes the rules 

We walk on two legs not on four 
To the house of pain 
To the house of pain 
To the house of pain 
To the house of pain 
To the house of pain 
(No spill blood)
