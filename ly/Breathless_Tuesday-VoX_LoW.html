		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You run on Monday
Breathless Tuesday
You creep on Wednesday
The end of the way
You dig on Thursday
You hide on Friday
Until Sunday
There is no next day
You love on Monday
You kill on Tuesday
You cry everyday
Now you have to pay
Everyday you've got to hide
You don't know who's on your side
You swallow swallow your pride
It is pitch black
Yes it's pitch black
You run on Monday
Breathless Tuesday
You creep on Wednesday
The end of the way
Everyday you've got to hide
You don't know who's on you side
You swallow swallow your pride
It is pitch black
Yes it's pitch black
