		  Na na na na na nah
Na na na na na na na nah 
Na na na na na na na nah 
Na na na na na na na nah 
Na na na na na na na nah 

Here we go again with the beats
We got you heads bumping, now you're jumping from your seats
If this is what you're wanting over there
Throw your hands up in the air
'Cause you know we bring the sounds so unique
Now everybody's moving, everybody's grooving
Getting down with Five when we come your way
Move it to the left now you shake it to the right
'Cause you know we gotta keep this party
Pumping through the night
Check me out now

Yo! 7,6,5,4,3,2,1
I'm on the microphone, got you hot like the sun
So a 1,2,3 now I'm waiting on the 4
Kick down the door and turn it up a little more

If you got the feelin', jump to the ceiling
Ah we're getting down tonight
1 if you want to, 2 if you're gonna, 3 'cause everything's alright
If you got the feelin', less of the dreaming
Ah, we're getting down tonight
It's just round the corner, tell me if you want to
Five will make you feel alright

Ah, move it at the back to the track
We got it going on we're the leaders of the pack
Now if you feel right, hold it tight
see, we want to carry on 'cause we gonna take it through until the dawn
Now everybody's moving, everybody's grooving
getting down with 5 when we come your way
So raise up your arms if we drop it on the 1
You see we're gonna carry on because the fun has just begun
Check us out now!

Yo! 7,6,5,4,3,2,1
I'm on the microphone, got you hot like the sun
So a 1,2,3 now I'm waiting on the 4
Kick down the door and turn it up a little more

If you got the feelin', jump to the ceiling
Ah we're getting down tonight
1 if you want to, 2 if you're gonna, 3 'cause everything's alright
If you got the feelin', less of the dreaming
Ah, we're getting down tonight
It's just round the corner, tell me if you want to
Five will make you feel alright

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Na na na na na nah
Na na na na na na na nah 
Na na na na na na na nah 
Na na na na na na na nah 
Na na na na na na na nah 

If you got the feelin', jump to the ceiling
Ah we're getting down tonight
1 if you want to, 2 if you're gonna, 3 'cause everything's alright
If you got the feelin', less of the dreaming
Ah, we're getting down tonight
It's just round the corner, tell me if you want to
Five will make you feel alright
