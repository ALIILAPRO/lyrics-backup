		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
I've been the voice of the Christian people
Against the world against the forces of evil
But I have fallen far below the seat I sit
'Cause I'm a Christian who's a hypocrite
I tell a story of man once addicted
He came to God and said, "I have been afflicted"
And You're the only hope that I have left
Because tomorrow I just might be dead
I'm a hypocrite woah, woah
Hypocrite
I have tried to be a righteous man
But I just quit
Woah, woah, woah, woah
I haven't always been a perfect example
But God won't ever give me more than I can handle
There was a time when I screamed in car
'Cause sin it left this condemnation on my heart
eight years of watching porn then saying amen
So save your tears because no wasn't a good man
And I would promise that tomorrow I would change
But my thoughts were still deranged
I'm a hypocrite woah, woah
Hypocrite
I have tried to be a righteous man
But I just quit
I'm a hypocrite woah, woah
Hypocrite
I have said that I'm not sinning when I know I did
Two years have almost passed but who is counting
My old man was nailed upon a cross at Calvary
With the Christ who bore the sin of all I'd done
And through his death I died along side of His Son
For a moment all world became still
'Cause once the old man was alive now had been killed
Then the new man he rose up from the grave
And he's with Christ in that Heavenly Place
I'm a hypocrite woah, woah
Hypocrite
I'm done trying to be righteous I'm the righteousness of Him
I'm a hypocrite woah, woah
Hypocrite
'Cause Christ has set me free and I don't have to sin again
I'm a hypocrite woah, woah
Hypocrite
I'm done trying to be righteous I'm the righteousness of Him
I'm a hypocrite woah, woah
Hypocrite
'Cause Christ has set me free and I don't have to sin again
