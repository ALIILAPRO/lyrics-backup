		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was the best man in a size too small.
You were my best friend, going at it all.
What if I put off my inheritance?
Where is the best man?

All arise us all in peace.
I still know you.
And I still like you, the best man.
I still owe you.

Everything rises, going at it all.
All the surprises in a size too small.
And what if I told you
I was still in love with this?

Would you surprise us
In a size for all of me?
I still know you.
And I still like you, the best man.

I still know you, the best man.
I still owe you.
