		<p>
		  Face away
Deal with the pain
Your own way
How could they
Deal with the pain?

I know
It was mine too
And you?
Is it really you?

Let's search the skies 
For a while
You and I 
Collide like two stars 
For a while
You and I

Crushed by silent snow
Not the first I know
Caught in ebb and flow
I'm bleeding out, now you know

Let's search the skies 
For a while
You and I 
Collide like two stars 
For a while
You and I
