		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So much to think about
I’m down beside myself
And I don’t know why
So when it doubt
I let it out
Cause it’s ok to cry

See when I have a dream  I wonder what it means
And what it says about my life
But it’s never what it seems
On the cinematic screen
So I don’t even want to try

It’s just one of those days
It’s just one of those days
It’s just one of those days when grace seems far away
Maybe I will never change
Tell me I’m going through a phase
Cause It’s just one of those days when grace seems far away


I go to get the train
I’m feeling so ashamed
Cause I can’t face the day
I remember what was cool
From when I was in school
I think about the things that changed
Like how I’d laugh along
Not thinking about the songs
Cause I know they’d always come my way
But it didn’t last for long
It loved me now its gone
And I can’t find the words to say

That it’s just one of those days
It’s just one of those days
It’s just one of those days when grace seems far away
Maybe I will never change
Tell me I’m going through a phase
Cause It’s just one of those days when grace seems far away


I think I know
Why I can’t let go
I’m still caught up in the afterglow
And time moves slow
You lose control
When your mind runs off to places you can’t go


I think I know
Why I can’t let go
I’m still caught up in the afterglow

It’s just one of those days
It’s just one of those days
It’s just one of those days when grace seems far away
Maybe I will never change
Tell me I’m going through a phase
Cause It’s just one of those days when grace seems far away
