		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Any last words?)
(Berge always flexin')
(I stay turnt)
(Made way to Utah)
(I'm from the South but I came from the Nawf)
Let's do it, it's Top, nigga, it's a brand new day
Pussy-ass nigga wan' play, I got my Drac'
Pussy-ass nigga wan' play, better have some cake

Can't stay off Boot, while in that booth
Straight out that boot, like I'm Weezy
Knock out your tooth, bitch, speak the truth
I been livin' life like a demon
I got good money, 'round the globe, I did my shit like Fefe
I tote that chopper when I roll in the N-O like BG
Oh, I was tryna catch a body
Peter lost his momma, he split one for me
I ain't 'posed to tell nobody
Fuck up my deal, get put in a pickle, nigga
Think it's a game, die when we scrimmage
Ain't lose my brain, come with my change
Fuck all this fame, my name been blemished

Niggas gettin' rowdy, I ain't quit, that's for cowards
I got my gun for who runnin' up on me
Runnin', I been makin' my routes
They plan on takin' me out
I took the world and fucked the brains out
Now, who's the motherfucker? (Come and see)
Now, who's the motherfucker? (Now, who's the motherfucker?)
Now, who's the motherfucker?
Livin' life like a motherfucker

Huh, five jets on the runway
No bonjour, go one way
I catch two bodies then I parlay
I'm a God, tell me what my God say
I'm a thug, shoot the Glock sideways
From the mud, get it out nine ways
I could buy 'em boys, I just lock down and get time paid
Dead lie, that city crime don't pay
All time rage 'cause my mind caged
Got more money than my net worth
Ask major labels, I'm they worst fuckin' slave
Tired of carryin' them and now my neck hurt
Got my chest lookin' like Starburst
Pussy nigga, you'll get your head burst, I had to starve first
Ridin' on a surfboard, try ridin' on my wave
Fuck 'em, I gots to get paid, gots get paid
Multimillions, I got high to heal my pain
I fucked on my last ho, hit her up, then she came
Nigga play wit' my name, I'm havin' one of these slimes comin' through swangin'
Nigga tryin' show us too much heart, get hit in his brain, makin' a change
I don't drive in no push-start, young nigga done made it out of the rain
Hopin' moms forgive my heart, I ain't never changed the way I came

Niggas gettin' rowdy, I ain't quit, that's for cowards
I got my gun for who runnin' up on me
Runnin', I been makin' my routes
They plan on takin' me out
I took the world and fucked the brains out
Now, who's the motherfucker? (Come and see)
Now, who's the motherfucker? (Now, who's the motherfucker?)
Now, who's the motherfucker?
Livin' life like a motherfucker
