		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Verse 1]
It doesn't hurt me
Do you want to feel how it feels?
Do you want to know that it doesn't hurt me?
Do you want to hear about the deal that I'm making?
You, it's you and me

[Chorus]
And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
If I only could, oh...
[Verse 2]
You don't want to hurt me
But see how deep the bullet lies
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder
Ooh, there is thunder in our hearts
Is there so much hate for the ones we love?
Tell me, we both matter, don't we?
You, it's you and me
It's you and me won't be unhappy

[Chorus]
And if I only could
I'd make a dеal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Bе running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say, if I only could

[Bridge]
You
It's you and me
It's you and me won't be unhappy

[Verse 3]
C'mon, baby, c'mon darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
C'mon, angel, c'mon, c'mon, darling
Let's exchange the experience, oh...
[Chorus]
And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building

[Outro]
Say, if I only could
Say, if I only could
Say, if I only could
