		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why you hatin'
Boy you hatin'
Boy you fakin'
Boy you fakin'
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Yeah, uh
That be Maaly Raw

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Chop it, up, off the plate, how long do it take?
Bake a cake, smoke a face, half-baked, want the face
Do no date, diamond water, like an ocean, like a lake
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Chop it, up, off the plate, how long do it take?
Bake a cake, smoke a face, half-baked, want the face
Do no date, diamond water, like an ocean, like a lake

Nowadays I get like 80k a show
Now at fifty shows straight for my tour
Run it up, run it up
Fuck your bitch, made her play double-dutch
Hit from the back, fuck her stomach up
Cheerios, lick on my honey nuts
Nowadays I get like 80k a show
Now at fifty shows straight from October
Run it up, run it up
Fuck your bitch, made her play double-dutch
Hit from the back, fuck her stomach up
Cheerios, lick on my honey nuts

Fuck yo girl on cam, GoPro, that's 'cause she a hoe
Lil Uzi, I hope you prepared for the ride
Fuck yo girl on cam, GoPro, that's 'cause she a hoe
Diamonds all on my fingers, diamonds all on her toes
Fucking R&B singers, I got R&B hoes

Weight, weight, weight, weight, weight, weight, weight
Chop it, up, off the plate, how long do it take?
Bake a cake, smoke a face, half-baked, want the face
Do no date, diamond water, like an ocean, like a lake
Weight, weight, weight, weight, weight, weight, weight
Chop it up, off the plate, how long do it take?
Bake a cake, smoke a face, half-baked, want the face
Do no date, diamond water, like an ocean, like a lake

Feel like Triple-Six Mafia, all I see is demons
That bitch ain't on a boat, all she see is seamen
Four-hundred dollars for a brand-new Gucci beanie
Whip it up like pasta, eat it up like a linguini
Oops, I flexed I'm sorry
I ain't even mean it
Oops, I flexed I'm sorry
I ain't even mean it
See it then I get it
If I want it, already have it
Diamonds on my Rollie, AP flooded like a Patek

I knew that I
I wouldn't make up
Time is racin'
I have patience
I wear the, Cartier, these ain't Ray-Bans
Why you fakin'
Why you hatin'

Weight, weight, weight, weight, weight, weight, weight
Chop it, up, off the plate, how long do it take?
Bake a cake, smoke a face, half-baked, want the face
Do no date, diamond water, like an ocean, like a lake
Weight, weight, weight, weight, weight, weight, weight
Chop it up, off the plate, how long do it take?
Bake a cake, smoke a face, half-baked, want the face
Do no date, diamond water, like an ocean, like a lake

Tell me
Why you hatin'
Fuck yo girl on cam, GoPro that's 'cause she a hoe
Diamonds all on my fingers, diamonds all on her toes
Fucking R&B singers, I got R&B singers
I got R&B singers, I got R&B singers
I got R&B singers, I got R&B singers
I got R&B singers, I got R&B singers
I got R&B singers, I got R&B singers
I got R&B singers
I got R&B hoes
