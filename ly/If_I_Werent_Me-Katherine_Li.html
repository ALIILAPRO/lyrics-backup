		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walk through the door
Now I’m sad on the floor
Just replaying the scenes from that party

Hate what I said 
Is it all in my head 
God I’m hoping it might be 

Do I come off too strong and mess it up?
Do I laugh too hard or not enough?
Do I fall too quick into love?
But what if I was

What if I was happier, funnier
Anything in between
‘Cause all that I can wonder is
What if I weren’t me

Do you think you’d like me a bit better
If I was cooler, put together 
If I could redo that first encounter 
Who would I be
Maybe I wouldn’t be me

Thinking that I might come off way too nice 
Maybe I should be a bit more mean 
Wish I could say how I feel 
And how I love you still
Tell me who you would want me to be

Do I come off too strong and mess it up?
Do I laugh too hard or not enough?

What if I was happier, funnier
Anything in between
‘Cause all that I can wonder is
What if I weren’t me

Do you think you’d like me a bit better
If I was cooler, put together 
If I could redo that first encounter 
Who would I be

What if I was
Prettier, luckier
Just like her 
Would that make you love me
Crazier, busier
Just like her 
Would that make you love me
Lovelier, earlier
Just like her 
Would that make you love me
Happier, funnier 
Just like her 
Would that make you love me

What if I was 
Happier, funnier
Just like her 
Would that make you love me
