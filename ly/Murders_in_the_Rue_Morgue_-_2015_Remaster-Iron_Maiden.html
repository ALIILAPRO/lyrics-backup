		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember it as plain as day
Although it happened in the dark of the night
I was strollin' through the streets of Paris
And it was cold it was starting to rain
And then I heard a piercing scream
And I rushed to the scene of the crime
But all I found was the butchered remains
Of two girls lay side by side
 
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Someone call the gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Vite before the killers go free
 
There's some people coming down the street
At last, there's someone heard my call
Can't understand why they're pointing at me
I never done nothin' at all
But I got some blood on my hands
Because everyone's shouting at me
I can't speak French so I couldn't explain
And like a fool I started runnin' away
 
Murder in the Rue Morgue
Someone call the gendarmes
Murder in the Rue Morgue
Am I ever gonna be free?
 
And now I've gotta get away from the arms of the law
All France is lookin' for me
I've gotta find my way across the border for sure
Down the south to Italy
 
Murders in the Rue Morgue
runnin' from the gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
I'm never going home
 
Well, I made it to the border at last
But I can't erase the scene from my mind
Anytime somebody stares at me, well
I just start runnin' blind
Well, I'm moving through the shadows at night
Away from the staring eyes
Any day they'll be lookin' for me
'Cause I know I show the signs of
 
Murders in the Rue Morgue
I'm runnin' from the gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
runnin' from the arms of the law
 
Murders in the Rue Morgue
runnin' from the gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Am I ever gonna be free?
 
It took so long and I'm getting so tired
I'm runnin' out of places to hide
Should I return to the scene of the crime?
Where the two young victims died
If I could go to somebody for help
To get me out of trouble for sure
But I know that it's on my mind
That my doctor said I've done it before

Murders in the Rue Morgue
They're never gonna find me
Murders in the Rue Morgue
I'm never going home
