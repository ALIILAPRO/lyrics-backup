		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let the record keep playing on
Spinning our favorite song
In the living room
Only me and you all night long
Rest your head on mine
We'll be locked in time
Old fashioned kind of love
Swarms of cartoon doves
Surround her eyes
Well we live in black and white
Just a man and his wife
On the hills
In the woods
Off the grid
The grid
Our lives may not be in color
But it's the lives we chose to live
Amongst the trees
You and me
In Tennessee
I dreamt of a girl
To take over my world
With her big brown eyes
And write songs about our lives
Until the night
We'll grow old and gray
Watching those leaves change
Outside our forest home
Out in the great unknown
Across the lake
Well we live in black and white
Just a man and his wife
On the hills
In the woods
Off the grid
The grid
Our lives may not be in color
But it's the lives we chose to live
Amongst the trees
You and me
In Tennessee
Well we live in black and white
Just a man and his wife
On the hills
In the woods
Off the grid
The grid
Our lives may not be in color
But it's the lives we chose to live
Amongst the trees
You and me
In Tennessee
