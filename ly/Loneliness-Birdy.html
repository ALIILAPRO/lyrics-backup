		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

It's getting hard to hide this tainted lullaby
I'm talking in my sleep
The sky is falling down, it's getting closer now
It's getting hard to breathe
Your hold has kept my heart in chains
For so long I've waited for it to break

Something in the air's got me feeling you're here again
And I was missing the dark without you near again
Watching the clock hand fall asleep on us
Oh, I've been losing my mind in these sweet dreams of loneliness

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
And I've been losing my mind in these sweet dreams

My mind has been so dark with no way to break out
And nowhere to be still
It's time to cut these ties and watch our shadows fly
Let the dark flood in
Your hold has kept my heart in chains
For so long I've waited for it to break

Something in the air's got me feeling you're here again
And I was missing the dark but now you're near again
Watching the clock hand fall asleep on us
Oh, I've been losing my mind in these sweet dreams of loneliness

I'm not afraid to be alone
To feel space, to know you're gone
To lose control if nothing more
To feel the burn

Something in the air's got me feeling you're near again
And I was missing the dark but now you're near again
Watching the clock hand fall asleep on us
Oh, I've been losing my mind in these sweet dreams of loneliness

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
And I've been losing my mind in these sweet dreams
