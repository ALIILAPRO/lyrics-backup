		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna grow up
I don't wanna see sex and the city
Lust for a minute
I don't wanna do that
I don't wanna let go on the floor tonight

And I can't hear nothing but beats and sounds
That don't feel good inside
I got jeans too tight It's all too loud
My feet can't hear the orders from my mind

I don't dance cause tonight you love somebody
Somebody new
I don't dance cause the moves don't want my body
I'll learn to hate them too
Now you dance to our songs
I need them too
I don't dance cause tonight you love somebody new

I don't need the feedback
I know that I'm stuck with the past
That this might last
I don't need a restart
I don't wanna re-oil myself tonight

I know it's a little bit sad and strange
I stay alone in the shade
I don't wanna dance I feel betrayed
Somebody else is playing with my babe

I don't dance cause tonight you love somebody
Somebody new
I don't dance cause the moves don't want my body
I'll learn to hate them too
Now you dance to our songs
I need them too
I don't dance cause tonight you love somebody new

Now the crowd grows wild I'm such a mess
And I can't escape this emptiness

I don't dance cause tonight you love somebody
Somebody new
I don't dance cause the moves don't want my body
I'll learn to hate them too

I don't dance cause tonight you love somebody
Somebody new
I don't dance cause the moves don't want my body
I'll learn to hate them too
Now you dance to our songs
I need them too
I don't dance cause tonight you love somebody new

Somebody new
