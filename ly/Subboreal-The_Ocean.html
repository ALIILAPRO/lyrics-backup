		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  there's a faint longing for 
something that's long lost and gone
that you remember from another life
another life, another time
something quaint, something neat
must have been quite a treat
a shared conspiracy
something not around, no more
nothing lives, nothing breathes
in this mire of disease
the deniers fled into the night
don't know what is wrong or right
something to be relived in psychedelic fever dreams
and cherished memories
riddled by nostalgia, did you see
did you see
did you see this closing in?
did you prepare yourself for the
unfathomable, for the day
for the day when this train
went completely off the rails
and everything went up in flames
and nothing here would ever be the same

we've gotten used to the cues
we're waiting for the next batch of bad news
another bolt out of the blue
we're waiting for the next batch of bad news

we've gotten used to the simple fact:
all we hold dear is hanging by a thread.
and every haven that we fabricate
can only be an intermittent space

it's clear that you do have a strong tendency
to fall for conspiracy theories
have you ever noticed the myths you believe
they grow on the soil of your own inner fears

brace yourself for the worst

now you're done
you've built your castle
all alone to live in it
now you're done
you've built your castle
all alone to rot in it
