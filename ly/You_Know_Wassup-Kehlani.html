		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This used to be my favorite time of the morning
Text you like, "Good Morning"
It's been a day, we ain't spoken
All of me feels frozen
How could you let it go like that?
How come it always goes like that?
Wondering where I mess up at
To always go through it, always go through this
Why do I gotta beg to be chosen
Over your vices, over your liquor?
Why I gotta ask for flowers?
I deserve roses, I deserve bigger
I know you're tryna change
But is it all worth the wait?
It hurts to stay 
Just as much as it hurts to walk away

You got demons, I got trauma
We both got triggers, I hate drama
I'm embarrassed, I'm in shock
He wide open, and that don't stop
And I watch your demons cause me trauma
Now I'm triggered, all this drama
You're embarrassed and in shock
We still in love and this shit don't stop
Man, this shit don't stop

Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
No, no, no
It don't stop

And I'll still 
Tell the world I'm in love with you
'Cause I ain't ashamed of shit
Got your name tatted on my wrist
Any bitch got a bone to pick
You know whose phone to hit
'Cause I'm still with all the actions 
And all that shit
You're still my love, you're still my heart
That's still my dick
Still wanna be Mrs. Jackson
Still wanna be your co-captain
So don't lose a girl of your dreams
Waited five years to be on my team
Looked damn good fucking with me
Love how I'm always on twenty
How I keep it tight and cleanly
Fuck you in the truck when it's empty
And I throw it back when you miss me
And I pull up when you hit me
I'ma say it loud so you hear me (oh)

You got demons, I got trauma
We both got triggers, I hate drama
I'm embarrassed, I'm in shock
He wide open, and that don't stop
And I watch your demons cause me trauma
Now I'm triggered, all this drama
You're embarrassed and in shock
We still in love and this shit don't stop
Man, this shit don't stop

Don't stop, no, no, no
Don't stop, no, no, no
Oh
No, no, no, it don't stop
Don't stop, no

Don't stop, no, no
Mm, no
Don't stop, no, uh
Don't stop, no

It's honest
