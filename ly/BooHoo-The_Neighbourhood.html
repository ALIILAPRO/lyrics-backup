		  Boo-hoo
I heard what's happenin' lately
Why I'm so down
But we're still happenin', baby
Right here, right now
I heard what's happenin'
Why I'm so down
We're still happenin', baby
Right here, right now

You hate it when I overreact
I wish I didn't act like that
I always feel under attack
You keep tellin' me to relax
Doctor got me keepin' my cool (my cool)
I still don't wanna follow the rules
I already feel like a tool (a tool)
So tell me what you want me to do

Boo-hoo
I heard what's happenin' lately
Why I'm so down
But we're still happenin', baby
Right here, right now
I heard what's happenin'
Why I'm so down
We're still happenin', baby
Right here, right now

Call her Alexander 'cause I treat her like my queen
Sleepin' in a palace livin' every girl's dream
She knows that she's magic, doesn't worry 'bout her status
Just as good as you imagine but it's still hard to believe
Shotgun riding with me, whip don't need no gasoline
YSL, gave her those shoes and I bought my Celines, yeah
Anywhere I take her, everybody wants a piece
I won't even blame 'em, that's my baby, she'll make anyone smile

Boo-hoo
I heard what's happenin' lately
Why I'm so down
But we're still happenin', baby
Right here, right now
I heard what's happenin'
Why I'm so down
We're still happenin', baby
Right here, right now
