		  Verse
When you leave I never wanna let you go 
So forgive me, if I’m holding on too tight 
Every time I’ve tried to use this line before 
I’ve meant it but the words just don’t come out right

Pre-chorus 
Maybe I’ve been falling as I learn to fly

Chorus
I’ve got one hand wrapped around the ripcord 
The other is all yours 
Don’t be afraid to fall, I promise I won’t let go 
And if we need to land, I’ve got one hand on the ripcord

Verse 
On the days I’ve lost my way, you’ve found me Like we’re made as two halves of one design. I know that I am prone to overthinking 
Oh but darling you never leave my mind

Pre-chorus
Maybe I’ve been falling as I learn to fly

Chorus 
I’ve got one hand wrapped around the ripcord 
The other is all yours 
Don’t be afraid to fall, I promise I won’t let go 
And if we need to land, I’ve got one hand on the ripcord

Bridge 
If you hold on to me 
I’ll be there all the way down. There may be no guarantee 
But trust me now I’ve got a plan

Chorus 
So if we need to land 
Oh if we need to land 
I’ve got one hand on the ripcord 
If we need to land, I’ve got one hand on the ripcord
