		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you out your mind?
Lately, I've been sobered up with pride
Explaining isn't needed at this time again
Aren't you tired of thinking what's the hype?
'Cause I won't roll the dice

It's better I let it die
Train of thoughts is denial
Going blind in your disguise
Should've known, but never mind

Like who would've ever kept you?
If I couldn't get through, next cue
Uh, yeah

Early in the morning
You'll be up and calling
I am not that type
So try another time
Early in the morning
You messed up, you're lonely
I am not that type
So try another time, time

You outta luck
Won't go the way you like (you outta luck)
You couldn't change my mind (you outta luck)
Good thing I said goodbye (you outta luck)
You played yourself this time
Early in the morning
You're trying to call me
But you know me, know me

Held on by a thread (out of luck)
Won't do that again (too bad for you)
Plus de larmes et plus d'regrets
Tu m'as montré juste qui tu es
Don't try to defend (out of luck)
I said what I said (too bad for you)
And I'm all out of feelings
And I think it's better I

It's better I let it die
Train of thoughts is denial
Going blind in your disguise
Should've known, but never mind

Like who would've ever kept you?
If I couldn't get through, next cue
Uh, yeah

Early in the morning 
You'll be up and calling (calling)
I am not that type
So try another time
Early in the morning (morning)
You messed up, you're lonely
I am not that type
So try another time, time

You outta luck
Won't go the way you like (you outta luck)
You couldn't change my mind (you outta luck)
Good thing I said goodbye (you outta luck)
You played yourself this time
Early in the morning
You're trying to call me
But you know me, know me

Out of luck

Our flirtation
Your hesitation
Back-and-forth too many steps
I'm done waiting
Lack of commitment (it's too much)
Had my heart trippin' (got me so stuck)
Getting you out of my head
Was what was missing
So I'm gonna turn me up, I wanna go crazy
Had enough of all of your shady
Shit and stuff, I'm done with your lazy ass
I ain't into that

Early in the morning 
You'll be up and calling
I am not that type
So try another time
Early in the morning
You messed up, you're lonely
I am not that type
So try another time, time

Won't go the way you like (you outta luck)
You couldn't change my mind (you outta luck)
Good thing I said goodbye (you outta luck)
You played yourself this time
Early in the morning
You're trying to call me
But you know me, know me
