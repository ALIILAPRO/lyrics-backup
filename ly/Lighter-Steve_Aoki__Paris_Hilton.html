		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel lighter without you
I feel lighter without you
Take a sip and then you fade
Up, up and away
I'm not coming down soon
I feel lighter without you
I feel lighter without you

Didn't know that my
My unconscious mind
Mind could be so brave
But the other night
Didn't even let
Let you in my head
You weren't even there
When I closed my eyes

Yeah, it sounded sincere every single time
Out of nowhere, you appear and apologize
But I see it so clear in a new light
I'm never coming back to you-u-u

I feel lighter without you
I feel lighter without you
Take a sip and then you fade
Up, up and away
I'm not coming down soon
I feel lighter without you
I feel lighter without you
I feel lighter without you
I feel lighter without you
Take a sip and then you fade
Up, up and away
I'm not coming down soon
I feel lighter without you
I feel lighter without you

Finally feel alive
Yeah, I will survive
It's hard to believe
That I used to care
You're not what I need
Landed on my feet
You can call my name
But I won't be there

Yeah, it sounded sincere every single time
Out of nowhere, you appear and apologize
But I see it so clear in a new light
I'm never coming back to you-u-u

I feel lighter without you
I feel lighter without you
Take a sip and then you fade
Up, up and away
I'm not coming down soon
I feel lighter without you
I feel lighter without you
I feel lighter without you
I feel lighter without you
Take a sip and then you fade
Up, up and away
I'm not coming down soon
I feel lighter without you
I feel lighter without you

Without you
Without you
Take a sip and then you fade
Up, up and away
I'm not coming down soon
I feel lighter without you
I feel lighter without you
