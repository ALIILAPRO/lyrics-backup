		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wonder how you feel inside
'Cause you got me all like "ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh"
You're gettin' down there plenty times
But you know I need your body, your body

Where did my baby go? Damn, I really can't go no more
Locked to the side, I'm feelin' cold, movie, like an endin' roll (movie, like a)
Gettin' loose in a foreign car, I'm sleep off a xanny bar
I swang on the boulevard, the hood, like a pop star
Pull up, swing, poppin' trunk, wah gwan? I'm a rasta
Pour a whole four in it, shots down
Type to hold you back and leave you down, I am not one
Girl, pick up that phone, I need you now

You got me like "ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh"
Something like a friend in me, don't I need your company?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Don't need your location, pull up my house, I'm waitin'

I wonder how you feel inside
'Cause you got me all like "ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh"
You're gettin' down there plenty times
But you know I need your body, your body

(I say) if you don't want better, throw it back
(I say) I'm tryna hit you from the back
(I say) if you throw it, better throw it back
Not like that, you see, I need your company (need your company)

This one gettin' old to ball (yeah)
He got a question, she's a superstar (she's a superstar)
Girl, are we goin'? We don't wanna get too far (get too far)
Do you know when you need me?
I'll be here tomorrow (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'll be here tomorrow (what do I gotta say to you?)
I'll be here today, tomorrow (today, tomorrow)
You'll be here today, tomorrow (today, tomorrow)

I wonder how you feel inside
'Cause you got me all like "ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh"
You're gettin' down there plenty times
But you know I need your body, your body

If you don't want better, throw it back
If you don't want better, throw it back (throw it back)
