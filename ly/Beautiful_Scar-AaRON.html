		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Into the streets of your mind
I get lost once in a while
Crystal clear antagony
Your soul is not the right one for me

Baby doll you're a porn soul
Baby doll you're a porn soul
Sexy beast upon my chest
Dark angel sucked all the best

This is a brainwashing process
Deep in my consciousness
And homeless soul
I'm your prom doll

You made a few plans on your own
Meanwhile I danced alone
Even though we went too far
You're my most beautiful scar

And baby doll you're a porn soul
Homeless wall I'm your prom doll
Is it still worth fighting,
Is it still worth begging

Know how heaven looks like
Let's try hell it might be right
Baby doll you're a porn soul
Homeless wall I'm your prom doll.
