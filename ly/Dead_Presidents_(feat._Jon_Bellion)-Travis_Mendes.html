		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We still chase dead presidents

I tried to get some sleep on the flight
But then this thought, it crawled in my mind
It's ironic that Obama's alive
But we still chase dead presidents
A businessman that can't find the time
Forgets to call his daughter at night
Ironic we can all run from life
But we still chase dead presidents

Oh, no matter what we do, we do
Oh, no matter what we do, we do
We still chase dead
We still chase dead presidents

These magazines, they blind and they lie
While politicians plan in the night
Ironic that they say "Vote or Die"
But we still chase dead presidents
A father thinks that money is love
This man, he sees himself in his son
Ironic that we die to stay young
But we still chase dead presidents

Oh, no matter what we do, we do
Oh, no matter what we do, we do
We still chase dead
We still chase dead presidents

Don't want these presidents to represent me
Don't want these presidents to represent me
Don't want these presidents to represent me
Don't want these dead fucking
Presidents to represent me
Don't want these presidents to rep
