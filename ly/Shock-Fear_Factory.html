		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Welcome to my world
Headfirst to the Earth
With my sights on the goddamned kill switch
I've become a fuse
Charged with attitude
Fixed and dilated by my anger

I have become a direct
I have become a current
I have become a direct
I have become insurgent

I will be the power surge
Shock to the system
Electrified  amplified
Shock to the system

Alternate my wires
Heat my core desire
I will not stand for condemnation
I've become the volts
To lead the revolt
Fuck with me ensues certain danger

I have become a direct
I have become a current
I have become a direct
I have become insurgent

I will be the power surge
Shock to the system
Electrified, amplified
Shock to the system

I am the power surge
I am the insurgent
Electrified, amplified
Electrified, amplified

Shock!
