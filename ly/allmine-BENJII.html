		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you were all mine
And we had all night
Yeah
Her silhouette is starting to fade
She's playing the part
In all my movie scenes
And no one else plays it
Like you babe
Ohhh
I can't help but feel it
When I think of you
Will I kiss your face, someday?
Lying in your bed at night
When you're wide awake
Gonna kiss your face someday
If you were all mine
And we had all night
If you were all mine, all mine
And we had all night
Her Zara sweater is starting to fade
She's taking a drag
Out on the mezzanine
And no one else sees you
The way I do
Ohhh
The way I do
I can't help but feel it
When I think of you
Will I kiss your face, someday?
Lying in your bed at night
When you're wide awake
Gonna kiss your face someday
If you were all mine
And we had all night
If you were all mine, all mine
And we had all night
Your smile for a minute
I won't find another feeling again
If we try for a minute
I won't find another feeling again
