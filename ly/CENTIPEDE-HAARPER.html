		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let it down good yeah I've seen enough
Knocking yo door off the hinge with my knuck
Background lyrics proceed with caution
Do not cause a problem

No friend of me
So I kick around like I'm a centipede
It's entropy
Ichi knock yo face off from the canopy
They beg and plead
Begging me will only bring the death I seek
The melody that you hear gon bring 'em near
The banshee shrieks

Double me up with the uzi and the pump
Yeah I never gave a fuck about a punk
Get slumped you a chump
Feel the bass up when it bump
When I'm deep in her cunt
Like a double doing stunts
Going triple when I feast

Right time, My time it's mine, You a mime
When you stepping on the ied get blown

High time, Fly time they dying, They crying
All they wanna do is hide and flee unknown

Open up the pit i see the fire and the grit
I need to pop another soul
To get me higher get my fix
I plead the fifth, foresee the witch
I see my spire in the mist
Decree by list, my hit won't miss
Red is yo new rinse

Down with the weight of a 210 titan
Make em run the other way
Nobody gonna keep on fightin
I'ma run up to the gunna
In my gundam where ya hidin
Break a sucka mothafucka like
Poseidon with the trident

Applying all the pressure
Director of the new echelon
Coming to yo sector
Look at my wrist, look at my ring
Gunshots pop when the angels sing

Tech nine, Red night red eye, Wed night
End night they start bowing to me
End the bed light can I send thy kunai
Through the fuckin window
Ima make ya go sleep

Bankai put em up my guns and funds
Make em run yo lung cannot pay up the lease

You have been warned ima take out the swarm
Pull the rug out, The storm
Is beginning to form and I'm ready for war
Headin straight to yo door
And I'm knocking that bitch to the floor
Cause I don't give a fuck
