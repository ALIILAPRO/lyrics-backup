		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't even know what day it is 
I don't even know the time
But these seconds are irrelevant 
When you're by my side
There's something 'bout your body, babe 
I could sip it on ice
But I can never get enough of you 
I'll be wasted for life

Ooh yeah, everyone, been going through it
Wondering what are we doing, doing

Baby, when you're falling
You can lean on me
When you don't feel strong
When you don't believe
Baby, let me love you
I won't ever leave
Promise when you're falling
You can lean on me
You can lean on me

Stay, stay, stay forever
You can lean on me
If you stay, stay, stay forever
You can lean on me

I don't even got a lot to give you
So will it be enough?
Will you love me through the hell of it 
When the battle's rough?
Been waiting on the moment, yeah 
Like, "When's it gonna come?"
'Cause in the middle of the everything 
you're the only one
Yeah

Ooh yeah, everyone, been going through it
Wondering what are we doing, doing

Baby, when you're falling
You can lean on me
When you don't feel strong
When you don't believe
Baby, let me love you
I won't ever leave
Promise when you're falling
You can lean on me (you can lean on me)
Baby, when you're falling
You can lean on me (you can lean on me)
When you don't feel strong (when you don't feel strong)
When you don't believe (when you don't believe)
Baby, let me love you (baby, let me love you)
I won't ever leave (I won't ever leave)
Promise when you're falling (yeah)
You can lean on me
You can lean on me

Stay, stay, stay forever (you can lean on me)
You can lean on me
If you stay, stay, stay forever (you can lean on me)
You can lean on me (oh, oh)
If stay, stay, stay forever (I won't ever leave)
You can lean on me
If you stay, stay, stay forever
You can lean on me
