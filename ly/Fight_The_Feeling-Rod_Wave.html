		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look, oh-whoa
Uh, okay

Women, how'd you get so good at hiding your feelings?
Pretending, pretending you're fine when really you're bending
Uh, you can't keep patching up your pain taking shots at the bar
Know exactly how you feel, I know what's in your heart
Young nigga came a long way with so many scars
Finally found a brighter day from being lost in the dark
But she don't wanna hear that tonight (oh no)
Play something that's feeling right (oh no)
She's tryna get lit tonight (oh no)
Get lost in the city lights (oh no)
Her heart still broken but she's in denial
She need her grandmama to watch her child
Her make-up covers up her broken smile
You're livin' on lies, hurtin' inside but she's outside

So get your hair did, put your clothes on
Tell the DJ to play your song (play your song)
Tryna fight the feeling
But she never finished healing
Now you in the middle of the club
Tryin' not to cry to a love song
In the middle of the club
Tryin' not to cry to a love song, whoa
To a love song, whoa, to a love song
Now you in the middle of the club
Tryin' not to cry
To a love song (to a love song), uh
To a love song (to a love song)
To a love song
Now you in the middle of the club
Tryin' not to cry to a love song
To a love song (to a love song, oh)
To a love song (to a love song)
Ayy, yeah
Ayy, yeah
Oh
