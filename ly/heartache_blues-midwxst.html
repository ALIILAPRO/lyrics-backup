		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heartache blues
Living in a broken world with you
Nothing to lose
Don't say that you will, just make your move

She could dip if she wants, but she lives in the back of my head
Through your lips, you can talk like your heart left me for dead, huh
What is the hold-up, girl, right now?
You need to roll up and pipe down
I'm not the same when you're around
Good thing I'm 'bout to leave town ('bout to leave town)
I'm just tryna take a stand
But you always put me on trial
Judgin' like you got a verdict, huh
But your ass still live in denial
Can't stand when she sayin' that it's all my fault
Take away my thoughts, lockin' up my vault
Wanna get in your head, girl, I know you can't stand it
Damn, lil' shawty in demand, and
Girl, I'm like, "Nah-uh-uh" (yeah)

Heartache blues
Living in a broken world with you
Nothing to lose
Don't say that you will, just make your move

Don't cut me out, better read my lips (better read my lips)
Talk that talk, never walk that shit (never walk that)
You never give me the closure (give me the closure)
What should we do? (What should we do?)
How can we get any closer?
All on my body, my mind ain't with you (yeah)
You always wearin' a smile (uh)
Gave you one inch of my love, but you seem to be takin' a mile
Can't stand when she's actin' all nonchalant
Said she don't care but it's all she wants
When you get in my head, girl, you know I can't take it
Want you so bad, I can't fake it
Girl, don't lead me on

Heartache blues
Living in a broken world with you
Nothing to lose
Don't say that you will, just make your move

Tell me what you want from me
I can't read your mind
I've been waitin' patiently
We can take our time
Tell me what you want from me
I can't read your mind (no, I cannot, no, I cannot)
I've been waitin' patiently
We can take our time
Tell me what you want from me (no, I cannot, no, I cannot)
I can't read your mind
I've been waitin' patiently (no, I cannot, no, I cannot)
We can take our time
