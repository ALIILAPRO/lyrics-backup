		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My lady always put a smile upon my face
She put my mind in a good place
One of a kind no fit replace you

She be my melanin dark chocolate
And when I'm lost she's my navigator
When I'm down she dey motivate me

She is my wonder woman
I feel safer when I'm in her arms
And I'm not bothered if tomorrow comes
Cause I love how I feel today

So come a little closer
Let me whisper something in your ears
Girl you make me wanna face my fears
And I no fit to use you play

She is my kind of woman
Beauty is so natural
She is the type that makes me want to love

She is my kind of woman
Her beauty is so natural
She is the type that makes me want to love
Want to love

My lady always put a smile upon my face
And her location is my happy place
Her energy lights up my space it's a no brainer

And at the end of a long day she's my J
She takes me high she my elevator
When I'm feeling low she's a motivator

She my Wakanda woman
No place ill rather be than in her arms
This love is deeper than the ocean
And I'm drowning in your wave

So come a little closer
Baby let me wipe away your tears
I can't believe that after all these years
They said we'd never make it baby
Ooh yeah

She is my kind of woman
Beauty is so natural
Type that makes me want to love

I wanna love you baby
You're my kind of woman
Beauty is so natural
Type that makes me want to love
Cause I wanna love you wanna love

She is my kind of woman
Beauty is so natural
She is the type that makes me want to love
I wanna love yeah yeah

You are my kind of woman
Her beauty is so natural
She is the type that makes me want to love
