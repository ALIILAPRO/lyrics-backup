		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought you were the sweetest kill
Did I even know?
And all the time we thought we did
Was it just for show?

If they try to pull you out
Would you even go?
I thought you were the sweetest kill
Did you even know?

I held your hand until the light
The scars were on the back
And all the time we were the right
Was it just retract?

And they can try to put you down, wear you out
Get you through the idea of the luck

Well, I thought you were the sweetest kill
Did we even know?

All the time, we get by, trying to figure out our lives
Like a fadeout
All the time, we get by, trying to figure out our lives
Like a fadeout

When we took the level ten
Was it just a twelve?
And when we went to where we've been
Was it just for self?

And they can try to wear you down, put you out
Get you through your will, that won't work

I thought you were the sweetest kill
Could I even know?

All the time, we get by, trying to figure out our lives
Like a fadeout
All the time, we get by, trying to figure out our lives
Like a fadeout
All the time, we get by, trying to figure out our lives
Like a fadeout
All the time, we get by, trying to figure our lives
Like a fadeout

Well, I break you through this world
Well, I break you through this world
Let me break you through this world
Can I break you through this world?
