		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If ever a boy stood on the moon
All the heavens would call them angels around
Stop the tears from troubled sky's, from 
Falling (falling, falling)

If ever the river could whisper your name
Would the choices you make still be the same?
Like a flower that dies from angry rain
Why do we hurt ourselves?

Where is the love that lets the sunlight in to start again (start again)
The love that sees no color lines?
Life begins with love
So spread your wings and fly (where is)
Guide your spirit safe and sheltered
A thousand dreams that we can still believe (where is)

If ever a boy stood on the moon
Carrying all of his treasures from the stars
To a rainbow which leads to where we are
Together we'd chase the sun

Where is the love that lifts my brother's voice to the skies (to the skies)
The love that answers a mother's cry? (where is the love, where is)
Life begins with love
So spread your wings and fly (where is)
Guide your spirit safe and sheltered
A thousand dreams that we can still believe (where is)

A boy stood on the moon (where is)
The ancient souls can still discover
A thousand dreams that we can still believe (where is)
(Where is the love, where is the love?) Ooh
That we can still believe
We can still believe (where is the love, where is the love?)
We can still believe
