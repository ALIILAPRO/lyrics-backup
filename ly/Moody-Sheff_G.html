		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look
Old shit sound like they new shit
I bet you already knew this (I bet you already knew this)
Look (look), look (look)
Look (look), look (look, Great John on the beat, by the way)

My old shit sound like they new shit
I bet you already knew this, look
Bitches around 'cause the crew lit
I play with numbers like I was a pool stick, look
Don't fuck around, we get moody (don't fuck around, we get moody)
Don't fuck around, we get moody, look
Don't fuck around, we get moody
Shots in direction like we making movies, look

Is you retarded?
This a function, not a party
I'm bustin' my moves, uh (moves)
Don't get me started
We be finishing our problems
They know how we move, look (move)
We get it lit, huh
Chopper bustin', they gon dip, huh
They get snatched and watch 'em six, huh
They get hit and watch 'em tell, huh, look
Run and tellin' twelve
2012, name been ringing like bells
'90s baby, I was probably like twelve, look
Do a hit by myself
Ain't no college, I read books in the cell, look
Had to learn on my own
Couldn't teach me, felt like I already know
Felt like I already know, look, look

My old shit sound like they new shit
I bet you already knew this, look
Bitches around 'cause the crew lit
I play with numbers like I was a pool stick, look
Don't fuck around, we get moody
Don't fuck around, we get moody, look
Don't fuck around, we get moody
Shots in direction like we making movies, look

My old shit sound like they new shit
I bet you already knew this, look
Bitches around 'cause the crew lit
I play with numbers like I was a pool stick, look
Don't fuck around, we get moody
Don't fuck around, we get moody, look
Don't fuck around, we get moody
Shots in direction like we making movies, look
