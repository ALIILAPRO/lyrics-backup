		  Let's go, lose control

Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go, let's go, lose control
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go, lose control

Let's go, lose control

It's a bounce, it's a bop, it's a slap, it's a knock
It's a bounce, it's a bop, it's a slap, it's a knock
It's a bounce, it's a bop, it's a slap, it's a knock
It's a bounce, it's a bop, it's a slap

Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go, let's go, lose control
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go, lose control

Let's go, lose control
