		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Trust me with your heart, yeah yeah
Trust me?

Flipping through my old diary
Bursting with dreams that I once had in my heart 
All of my dreams and my heart for you are coming back out of blue
Tonight I just can't fall asleep

Remember how we used to be
So much to share but it's never easy
All my stories hidden deep inside me 
Today I just wanna tell you whatever I've been holding back

MIDZY neon nal MIDZY (trust me)
What a gift you give
The trust that you show me 

It's you and I
Now is the moment for you and I (moment just for you and I)
More than anyone else tight as the two can be (no-one else)
MIDZY I know
Oh we trust one another
Always be by my side

Staying next to me, it's you
Believing in me, it's you
Don't worry about a thing
MIDZY I know
Oh we trust one another
Thank you for trusting in me, yeah

I don't know how you get me every time (yeah)
Whenever I see you smiling at me, it just makes me smile like you 
Oh I feel love 
Wishing you are feeling what I feel for you 

Even when I'm acting like a child and be free (child and be free)
You take me just as who I truly am 
Mistakes and all
Melting my heart with your warming embrace
I can't ask for anything more, nothing more

MIDZY neon nal MIDZY (trust me)
What a gift you give
The trust that you show me 

It's you and I
Now is the moment for you and I (moment just for you and I)
More than anyone else tight as the two can be (no-one else)
MIDZY I know
Oh we trust one another
Thank you for trusting in me

Thank you's not enough
No, it's never enough
For someone who gave me their everything, yeah
So hear now our song that I'm singing
Every word is meant to be only for you (words are meant to be only for you)

Oh baby it's you and I
Now is the moment for you and I (moment just for you and I)
More than anyone else tight as the two can be (no-one else)
MIDZY I know
Oh we trust one another
Always be by my side

Staying next to me, it's you
Believing in me, it's you
Don't worry about a thing
MIDZY I know
Oh we trust one another
Thank you for trusting in me
