		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Breathe

Stay calm for a little (breathe)
'Til you find me
Let's meet in the middle (breathe)
Run your hands up and down me

And I've been on your mind (breathe)
Haven't I lately?
And you've been trying to fight (breathe)
Whatever you're feeling, feeling

Let me show you what it means to be human
To be wanted, to be vulnerable
Let me show you what it means to be human
To be helpless, and emotional
Let me show you what it means to be human
Whatever you want to do with me
What it means to be human

Let me show you what it means to be human
Let me show you what it means to be human
Whatever you want to do with me
What it means to be human

(Breathe)

Stay calm for a little (breathe)
Heart beating like crazy
Let's dance for a little (breathe)
Move yourself up against me

And I've been on your mind (breathe)
Haven't I lately?
And you've been trying to fight (breathe)
Whatever you're feeling, feeling

Let me show you what it means to be human
To be wanted, to be vulnerable
Let me show you what it means to be human
To be helpless, and emotional
Let me show you what it means to be human
Whatever you want to do with me
What it means to be human

Let me show you what it means to be human
