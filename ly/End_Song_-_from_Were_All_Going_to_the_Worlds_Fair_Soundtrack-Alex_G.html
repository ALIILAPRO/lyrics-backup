		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I choose to stay
There is no other way
I read the sign
I do not ask it why

You know what they do too
Little dogs like you
You know what they do too
Little dogs like you
You know what they do too
Little dogs like you

I eat, I pray
I tumble through my day
A fish in mud
A scarecrow full of blood

You know what they do too
Little dogs like you
You know what they do too
Little dogs like you
You know what they do too
Little dogs like you
