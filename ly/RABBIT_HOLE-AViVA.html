		  (Rabbit hole, rabbit hole)
(Rabbit hole again)
(Rabbit hole, rabbit hole)
(Rabbit hole again)

I could say I'll take you, I could say I'll make you
But underneath, all I plan to do, to do is break you
You could be my breakthrough, watching demons wait till
I leave you, and they can initi-niti-nitiate you

No one understands me, too scared to command me
Walking through an empty underworld of demons dancing
No one understands me, too scared to command me
Walking through an empty underworld of demons dancing

I'll drag you into my home
Lose you deep in my thoughts
Fall inside the rabbit hole again
I'll drag you into my home
Lose you deep in my thoughts
Fall inside the rabbit hole again

Rabbit hole, rabbit hole (fall inside)
Rabbit hole again
Rabbit hole, rabbit hole (inside the)
Rabbit hole a (fall inside)
Rabbit hole, rabbit hole (inside the)
Rabbit hole again
Rabbit hole, rabbit hole (inside the)
Rabbit hole again

I won't wait to play you, I will not forsake you
I'll wait as long, as long as it takes you
You will say you need me, say you don't believe me
You can try but you will never, never, never leave me

No one understands me, too scared to command me
Walking through an empty underworld of demons dancing
No one understands me, too scared to command me
Walking through an empty underworld of demons dancing

I'm too late to walk it alone
Too late to say I don't know
Too late to turn back time a (fall inside the)

I'll drag you into my home
Lose you deep in my thoughts
Fall inside the rabbit hole again (fall inside the)
I'll drag you into my home
Lose you deep in my thoughts
Fall inside the rabbit hole again (fall inside the)

Rabbit hole, rabbit hole (fall inside)
Rabbit hole again
Rabbit hole, rabbit hole (inside the)
Rabbit hole a (fall inside)
Rabbit hole, rabbit hole (inside the)
Rabbit hole again
Rabbit hole, rabbit hole (inside the)
Rabbit hole again

I will always wait for you, I'll always be waiting
I will always follow you 'cause you cannot escape me
I will always wait for you, I'll always be waiting
I will always follow you 'cause you cannot escape me

I'll drag you into my home
Lose you deep in my thoughts
Fall inside the rabbit hole again (fall inside the)
I'll drag you into my home
Lose you deep in my thoughts
Fall inside the rabbit hole again

Rabbit hole, rabbit hole (fall inside)
Rabbit hole again
Rabbit hole, rabbit hole (inside the)
Rabbit hole again (fall inside)
Rabbit hole, rabbit hole (inside the)
Rabbit hole again
Rabbit hole, rabbit hole (inside the)
Rabbit hole again
