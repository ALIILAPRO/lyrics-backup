		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't go to war for me
I'm not the one that you want me to be
Don't call me up at 2 A.M. tonight
It feels so damn good and I wish you would

Are we just gonna stay like this forever
Floating, I'm serious
My heart is furious
'Cause I'm so confused when we're together
Feels like I'm choking, these emotions
I know I'm gonna let you down
So don't hold your breath now, yeah
Bittersweet in your mouth
Can you stomach the doubt?
I wish I could say what I'm feeling
I'm scared to let these words out

Don't go to war for me
I'm not the one that you want me to be
Don't call me up at 2 A.M. tonight
It feels so damn good and I wish you would
And don't cry no more for me
Don't waste your time convincing me
That maybe someday we'll get it right
'Cause we never could, I wish that we would but we won't

So just don't
We won't, so just don't
But we won't, so just don't
Don't

I can't trust you
Baby, 'cause I don't want to
This isn't fun anymore
Never hurt like this before
Broken dishes on the floor
Hearts exploding
Tell me why I'm still holding
Onto the love that we've been breaking
Damn, I thought we'd make it
No other way to say it (don't, don't, don't)

Don't go to war for me
I'm not the one that you want me to be
Don't call me up at 2 A.M. tonight
It feels so damn good and I wish you would
And don't cry no more for me
Don't waste your time convincing me
That maybe someday we'll get it right
'Cause we never could, I wish that we would

We burn faster than a cigarette in my mouth
I know it hurts, but baby, we can't stop now
Baby, we can't stop now

Don't go to war for me (don't go to war for me)
I'm not the one that you want me to be (that you want me to be)
Don't call me up at 2 A.M. tonight (call me up at 2 A.M tonight)
It feels so damn good and I wish you would
And don't cry no more for me
Don't waste your time convincing me
That maybe someday we'll get it right
'Cause we never could, I wish that we would but we won't

So just don't
We won't, so just don't
But we won't, so just don't (we won't so just don't)
Don't
Don't
Don't
