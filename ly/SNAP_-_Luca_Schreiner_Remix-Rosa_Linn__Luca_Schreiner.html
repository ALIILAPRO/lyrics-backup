		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's 4 AM
I can't turn my head off
Wishing these memories would fade
They never do
Turns out, people lied
They said, "Just snap your fingers"
As if it was really that easy for me to get over you

I just need time

Snapping, one, two
Where are you?
You're still in my heart
Snapping, three, four
Don't need you here anymore
Get out of my heart

'Cause I might snap
Might snap

I'm writin' a song
Said, "This is the last one"
How many last songs are left?
I'm losing count
Since June 22nd
My heart's been on fire
I've been spendin' my nights in the rain
Tryna put it out

Snapping, one, two
Where are you?
You're still in my heart
Snapping, three, four
Don't need you here anymore
Get out of my heart

'Cause I might snap
'Cause I might snap
Might snap
You're still in my heart

You're still in my heart
'Cause I might snap
