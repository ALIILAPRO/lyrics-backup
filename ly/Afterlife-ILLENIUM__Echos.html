		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  After we're gone
Who will breathe the earth we lost?
We leave nothing but our thoughts
And memories beneath the dust
So when this body fails to mend
And all my demons they come crashing in
Will I start to begin
Or will I fade away with them?

And in the afterlife, tell me we'll be fine
In the afterlife, tell me we'll be fine
And in the afterlife, tell me we'll be fine
In the afterlife

And in the afterlife, tell me we'll be fine
In the afterlife, tell me we'll be fine
And in the afterlife, tell me we'll be fine
In the afterlife

In the afterlife

So when this body fails to mend
And all the demons, they come crashing in
Will we start to begin or will
We fade away with them?

And in the afterlife, tell me we'll be fine
In the afterlife, tell me we'll be fine
And in the afterlife, tell me we'll be fine
In the afterlife

And in the afterlife, tell me we'll be fine
In the afterlife, tell me we'll be fine
And in the afterlife, tell me we'll be fine
In the afterlife

In the afterlife

And in the afterlife, tell me we'll be fine
In the afterlife, tell me we'll be fine
And in the afterlife, tell me we'll be fine
In the afterlife

And in the afterlife, tell me we'll be fine
In the afterlife, tell me we'll be fine
And in the afterlife, tell me we'll be fine
In the afterlife

And in the afterlife, tell me we'll be fine
In the afterlife, tell me we'll be fine
And in the afterlife, tell me we'll be fine
In the afterlife

In the afterlife

And in the afterlife, tell me we'll be fine
In the afterlife, tell me we'll be fine
And in the afterlife, tell me we'll be fine
In the afterlife
