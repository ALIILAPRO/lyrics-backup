		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you need someone who can love you while he's gone
Baby, you got my number, got my number, whoa
When you realize it ain't him that's on your mind
Baby, you got my number, got my number, whoa

Three dots tryna tell me (yeah, yeah)
Trying hard not to text me (yeah, yeah)
Is it because your bed is empty? (Yeah, yeah)
Is it right there and you can't see?
Everybody wants what they want, love who they love
I wouldn't judge, and I can keep a secret so

If you need someone who can love you while he's gone
Baby, you got my number, got my number, whoa
When you realize it ain't him that's on your mind
Baby, you got my number, got my number, whoa
So who you gonna call when you want to do them things he won't do
Baby, you got my number, got my number, whoa
So who you gonna call when you want to do them things he won't do
Baby, you got my number, got my number, whoa

Nobody needs to be lonely (yeah, yeah)
Just say that word and you won't be (yeah, yeah)
'Cause I don't want to turn up your heartbeat (yeah, yeah)
And if you got dials baby no need (yeah, yeah)
Everybody wants what they want, love who they love
I wouldn't judge, and I can keep a secret so

If you need someone who can love you while he's gone
Baby, you got my number, got my number, whoa
When you realize it ain't him that's on your mind
Baby, you got my number, got my number, whoa
So who you gonna call when you want to, do them things he won't do
Baby, you got my number, got my number, whoa
So who you gonna call when you want to, do them things he won't do
Baby, you got my number, got my number, whoa
