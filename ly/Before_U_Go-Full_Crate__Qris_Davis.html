		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Before you go
I just need to know 
If we're more than friends
Cause I can see the fairytale 
And do you see?
The possibilities of a you and me
Or is it all just in my head 
Before you go
I just need to know
I really need to know before you go

I been tryna tell you but I can show you better
I just want to understand my place within your heart
Cause we been running slowly 
And that to me is new
All I do is overthink and I feel like it shows

Before you go
I just need to know 
If we're more than friends
Cause I can see the fairytale 
And do you see?
The possibilities of a you and me
Or is it all just in my head 
Before you go
I just need to know
I really need to know before you go

I Spent some time alone
And understand my own 
Thoughts that rushing through my mind while we're taking it slow
Im in need of confirmation but that is nothing new 
All I do is overthink and I feel like it shows 

Before you go
I just need to know 
If we're more than friends
Cause I can see the fairytale 
And do you see?
The possibilities of a you and me
Or is it all just in my head 
Before you go
I just need to know
I really need to know before you go

Before you go
