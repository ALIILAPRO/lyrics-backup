		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Listen now to the wind babe
Listen now to the rain
Feel that water lickin' at my feet again
I don't want to see this town no more

Wastin' my days on a factory floor
First thing you know I'll be back in Bow River again

Anytime you want babe, you can come around
But only six days separates me and the great top end
I been working hard, tweleve hours a day
And the money I saved won't buy my youth again

Goin' for the heat babe, and a tropical rain
In a place where no man's puttin' on the dog for me
Waitin' on the weekend, set o' brand new tyres
And back in Bow River's just where I want to be

Listen now to the wind babe
Listen now to the rain
Feel that water lickin' at my feet again
I don't want to see this town no more

Too many years made up my mind to go or stay
Right to my dying day
I don't want to see another engine line
Too many years and I owe my mind

First set o' wheels headin' back Bow River again
First thing you know I'll be back in Bow River again

Got the motor runnin', got the rest of my days
Sold everything I owned for a song
So anytime you want babe, you can come around
But don't leave it too late you just might find me gone

Listen now to the wind babe . . .

I don't need the score
I'm goin' through the door
Gonna tell the man I don't want no more
Pick up a fast car and burn my name in the road

One week two week maybe even more
Piss all my money up against the damn wall
First thing you know I'll be back in Bow River again
