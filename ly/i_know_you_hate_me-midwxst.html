		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been fighting with thoughts and temptations
I'm not good at holding conversations
Bae, baer with me, baby, please just be patient
Want you here, I don't want my bed vacant
Every night, we been fightin' and fuckin' and lovin'
I don't know if I hate this shit or love it
Don't wanna keep goin' but don't wanna cut it
In a predicament but won't discuss it, no

You say you love me, but I know you hate me
Don't ever wan' face me, don't know what I'm facin'
I'm not one for chasin', you're never explainin'
I'm gone on the weekends, I'm off the deep end
Nothing ever makes sense
Watch you walk out my life and it ain't been the same since
Put it in the past tense
I was playing the offense, but now I'm on defense

Never said you were the one that was crazy
I should've had better judgment, I was lazy
Now I sit and recollect while I'm on vacay
I should've known that you were trouble when you made me say
That I love you so much, I don't want you to leave
And that you were the one that was pulling my strings
And then you went and ripped my heart up into pieces
I never thought it would reach this

You say you love me, but I know you hate me
Don't ever wan' face me, you know what I'm facin'
I'm not one for chasin', you're never explainin'
I'm gone on the weekends, I'm off the deep end
Nothing ever makes sense
Watch you walk out my life and it ain't been the same since
Put it in the past tense
I was playing the offense, but now I'm on defense

And once you leave, there's no comin' back
I don't wanna see your face, and on top of that
I don't want you in my phone, no, I'm not textin' back
I know that no matter what you do, that you'll come running back
And don't try to backtrack on shit that you said
'Cause to me, in my head, you're already dead
So I'm gonna let you rest in peace (uh)
Hopefully this will end the misery
