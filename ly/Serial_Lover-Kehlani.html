		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I'm addicted to romance
Showing my whole hands
Laying my cards out flat
I say, wear my heart on my sleeve
If you fuckin' with me
Anything I'll ever take back
I think I should be single
For a while
It's getting a little wild
Know when to slow down
Probably best I'm single (uh)
To get in my zone now
To stay in my zone, oh

Lord knows
My intentions are pure and my heart full of gold, oh
Lord knows
My intentions are pure, but my habits are cold

Love hard, fuck harder
Serial lover, serial lover
Love hard, fuck harder
Serial lover, need to recover

I got bodies I'ma take to the grave
I got girls I wanna give my last name
No regrets, don't got no shame 
Playin' no games, playin' my way

Only wake me up if you can take that shit
Understand you're entering at your own risk
I want those nights I won't forget
Nights I can't run back with people I won't miss

Oh, why? Lord knows (Lord knows)
My intentions are pure and my heart full of gold
Oh, Lord knows
My intentions are pure, but my habits are cold

Love hard, fuck harder
Serial lover, serial lover
Love hard, fuck harder
Serial lover, need to recover

I got bodies I'ma take to the grave
I got girls I wanna give my last name
No regrets, don't got no shame 
Playin' no games, playin' my way
