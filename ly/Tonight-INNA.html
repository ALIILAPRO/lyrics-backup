		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They think is wrong
I don't care about the world
You're here this night
All the night you're by my side

They think is wrong
I don't care about the world
You're here this night
All the night you're by my side

I can't get off cause
I feel inside

I have been sad every night
I can smile tonight, tonight
I’ve been sad every night
I can smile tonight, tonïght

They think is wrong
I don't care about the world
You're here this night
All the night you're by my side

They think is wrong
I don't care about the world
You're here this night
All the night you're by my side

I can't get off cause
I feel inside

I have been sad every night
I can smile tonight, tonight
I’ve been sad every night
I can smile tonight, tonïght

I have been sad every night
I can smile tonight, tonight
I’ve been sad every night
I can smile tonight, tonïght

I have been sad every night
I can smile tonight,tonight
I’ve been sad every night
I can smile tonïght, tonïght
