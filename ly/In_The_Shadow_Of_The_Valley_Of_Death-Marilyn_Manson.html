		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We have no future
Heaven wasn't made for me
We burn ourselves to hell
As fast as it can be
And I wish that I 
Could be the king

Then I'd know that I am not alone

Maggots put on shirts
Sell each other shit
Sometimes I feel so worthless
Sometimes I feel discarded
I wish that I was good enough

Then I'd know that I am not alone

Death, is policeman
Death, is the priest
Death, is the stereo
Death, is TV
Death, is the Tarot
Death, is an angel and
Death, is our God
Killing us all

She put the seeds in me
Plant this dying tree
She's a burning string
And I'm just the ashes
She put the seeds in me
Plant this dying tree
She's a burning string
And I'm just the ashes
She put the seeds in me
Plant this dying tree
