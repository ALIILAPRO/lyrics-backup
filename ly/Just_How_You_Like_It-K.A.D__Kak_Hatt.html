		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wanna chat about flow? Tell a fella, "Come see me"
Boy, you know I'm magic on the mic, Houdini
Can't work out how I flow so freely
Puffin' that whirly, oh so cheesy
Lovin' up the marijuana
I ain't worried about him, boy, the cha is a 'nana
Give a fuck about a deal, tell him, "Grab me a lager"
I be on the back wheel like I'm Travis Pastrana (ring ding)
I don't use my brain, girl, I use me knob
So drop down, get low, gotta loosen off
I'm startin' to really get the pox with this lockdown shit about 3.0
(I'm gonna lose me job)
Like (oh) chavvy, I'm lit
I go and write a full song while I'm having a shit
Stayin' in me own lane, I don't follow the drip
I treat the fanny like a speedball, pummel the clit
I great the fanny like a punchbag, roughin' it up
She let me stick in her ringer, yeah, I doubled it up (get it?)
Don't you know the government are locking us up?
So why the fuck you tryna act like you're up in the club? (Go to bed)
Make 'em bounce to the rhythm of the beat real quick
Girl, show me how you do it, on your feet real slick
Cuttin' down on the couva, better know I still sniff
Done a bad, now they tell me, I Am Legend, Will Smith
Done a bag, now I'm ruinnin' through the woods like Mowgli
If you ain't ringin' up for the Kush, don't phone me
Fatty here puffin' on a blunt, when I'm touchin' up her cunt
Boy, I'm 'bout to slam dunk like Kobe
Lay up off the couva, boy, smashin' up me brain
Took an L, bounced back and now I'm back up in the game
I just give them all a blast, I don't even know her name
Transferred a twenty bar, told the cut to get the train

I tell her touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I'll give it to ya just how you like it, darl'
Puff this cheesy, make it look easy
Whip out the pen, start writing (whip it)
Whip out the pen, start writing (whip it)
Whip out the pen, start writing
And if a man talk shit, boy, I'll jab him up the lip
Yeah, I'll make a man quit like Tyson

Yeah, magic on mic, boy, you better believe it
Got the abracadabra, the telekinesis
Ain't gettin' on the couva then I tell her to leave it
No pics on the sesh, right, tell her, "Delete it"
Tell her, "Don't fuck about it, get straight to the point"
Cup of tea, two sugars, bit of steak and a joint
Watch her pull up in the vest, looking like a Big Lex
While I get the stinging, Roger and I get the (Popcoin)
Tell her get the stinging Roger while I'm puffin' on the Benson
Keep your mooey shut, I aint't the one that you can mention
Best in the game, better stay in your lane
Every time they say my name, boy, you know they feel tension
Got her legs spread wide and she letting me lick it
She wanna suck my left bollock, yeah, she very specific
Ain't nobody given it to ya, gotta get up and get it
And no couva 'til 12, 'cause I've done all me limit

I tell her touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I'll give it to ya just how you like it, darl'
Puff this cheesy, make it look easy
Whip out the pen, start writing (whip it)
Whip out the pen, start writing (whip it)
Whip out the pen, start writing
And if a man talk shit, boy, I'll jab him up the lip
Yeah, I'll make a man quit like Tyson

I tell her touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I'll give it to ya just how you like it, darl'
Puff this cheesy, make it look easy
Whip out the pen, start writing (whip it)
Whip out the pen, start writing (whip it)
Whip out the pen, start writing
And if a man talk shit, boy, I'll jab him up the lip
Yeah, I'll make a man quit like Tyson
