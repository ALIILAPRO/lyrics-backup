		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're out with that guy the one I never liked
Told me he's just a friend and not even your type
But friends don't kiss friends
Friends don't kiss friends

But I guess that you lied, looked me right in the eyes
Told me I shouldn't worry, you swore on your life
But that don't make sense
'Cause friends don't kiss friends

Don't you ever call this "love", you liar
You set our house on fire
I should've known you liked him
I just didn't think I'd find him

Kissing your lips and pulling you closer
Putting his arms around your shoulders
Taught me to never trust again, oh
'Cause friends don't kiss friends

And I hate that I knew, shoulda trusted my gut
But you made me feel dumb when you said that it was
All in my head
But I can't forget

Don't you ever call this "love", you liar
You set our house on fire
I should've known you liked him
I just didn't think I'd find him
Kissing your lips and pulling you closer
Putting his arms around your shoulders
Taught me to never trust again
'Cause friends don't kiss friends
