		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, oh

Mix up my days, got me in a daze
Stuck in a phase, so talk to me nice
Come get me laid, sing me lullabies, yeah
Come drive me craze 'fore I catch a flight
Mix up my days, got me in a daze (Spades on ice)
Stuck in a phase, so talk to me nice (talk to me nice)
Come get me laid, sing me lullabies, yeah (you know what I like)
Come drive me craze 'fore I catch a flight

Talk to me nice, I don't wanna fight
Don't pick me up, I'll drive
Dinner res' at The Nice Guy
Let's make it right, put pride to the side
I don't wanna wait all life for the right time, I know
You got options, I got options
Want you, but don't need you
Tease you, but I please you
Hoes talk gossip, we got options
Treat you like I need you
But you know you what I want

Mix up my days, got me in a daze
Stuck in a phase, so talk to me nice
Come get me laid, sing me lullabies, yeah
Come drive me craze 'fore I catch a flight
Mix up my days, got me in a daze (Spades on ice)
Stuck in a phase, so talk to me nice (talk to me nice)
Come get me laid, sing me lullabies, yeah (you know what I like)
Come drive me craze 'fore I catch a flight

This a feeling that money can't buy
Couldn't be fake if I tried
Loyalty, what the money can't buy
You only get one chance, only one try
I give you feelings money can't buy
Couldn't be fake if I tried
Loyalty, what the money can't buy
You only get one chance, only one try

Try to find better, ain't none if you noticed
Better when we keep our secrets in the open
Ride for ya, I done kept the whole thing in motion
Ride on ya, when we gettin' high we the closest
High end, private charter to an island
Real good sex to break the silence
Same team shooting, take the score
Do me a solid, keep it solid
Don't lie unless you lie beside me
Keep our plans in private
Their opinions don't mean a thing

This a feeling money can't buy
Couldn't be fake if I tried
Loyalty what the money can't buy
You only get one chance, only one try
I give you feelings money can't buy
Couldn't be fake if I tried
Loyalty what the money can't buy
You only get one chance, only one try

(Spades on ice)
(Talk to me nice)
(You know what I like)

You got options, I got options
Want you, but don't need you
Tease you, but I please you
Hoes talk gossip, we got options
Treat you like I need you
But you know you what I want
