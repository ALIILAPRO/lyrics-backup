		  Chatty, chatty (Aziz)

Chatty, chatty
Chatty boy, TikTok, don't wanna cross me (don't wanna cross me)
They gon' wanna test your body, boy
If they ever see you movin' wacky
Back seat, back seat
Swervin' them toys, never thought I'd be so flashy
Taxi, taxi (mh, ah)
Taxi boy, take 'em to the nearest church (ah, look)

Runnin' in me Don and my red blood kicks
Red bottom got me bleeding, I'm more than drip (baow)
People be drowning, never allow them sink
Let them in and they be tryna drown my ship
Move our business with no apology
Walk how I run, they could get the all of it
Turn into phantom, all anonymous
Sorry, no sorry, I did it by purpose
Damn, they so late, tryna think Judas
Woadie got crashed by the beam, the machine
Schemes on my life still remain unseen
Still rack money like I'm gonna lose it

Still want smoke like I won't defuse it
I was calm one time, then people abused it (uh)
Tints on my ride to remain unseen
But the chop on my side 'case I wanna use it (grrah)
Heard people trying like I ain't the blueprint
When I hear bitches rappin', I'm keepin' it muted (muted)
Free my niggas that's in institutions
When they set the pipe down, made me wanna shoot shit (grrah)

Chatty, chatty
Chatty boy, TikTok, don't wanna cross me (don't wanna cross me)
They gon' wanna test your body, boy
If they ever see you movin' wacky
Back seat, back seat
Swervin' them toys (Shh-kah), never thought I'd be so flashy (ODUMODUBLVCK)
Taxi, taxi (yeah)
Taxi boy (prrah), take 'em to the nearest church (ayy)

E dey be like Ogboni member
The way I dey blow up, even my mummy's friends are (happy)
Praying for my Grammy's to enter
So that they can bill a nigga, I can't surrender
Navigate the kala make I squeeze am per bastard
Call man, skillfully bang it
When I be pikin, I been dey store bullet for Pampers
Hands down, who the man now?
Opposition dey my door, all of them dey gather hail man
Odumodu, Odumodu, it's pity when you wanna drive-by
'Cause your handbag dey carry, wetin dey abide by
If you wan come criticize, you go chow cry
Plata o plomo, they cannot cultivate lies
When I evolve oh, dem a prize high
I go cut-cut their body
Naija boy don fagbo
Ogogoro yakpa for my body (whoa)
Raraga na normal, on a steady (whoa)
Ako nu che surplus, it is many (ah)
I no need to pray before I meet up all my enemies
They wait upon my coming

Chatty, chatty (grrah)
Chatty boy, TikTok, don't wanna cross me (don't wanna cross me)
They gon' wanna test your body, boy
If they ever see you movin' wacky
Back seat, back seat
Swervin' them toys, never thought I'd be so flashy
Taxi, taxi
Taxi boy, take 'em to the nearest church
