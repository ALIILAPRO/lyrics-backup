		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sunday is gloomy
My hours are slumberless
Dearest the shadows
I live with are numberless

Little white flowers
Will never awaken you
Not where the black coach
Of sorrow has taken you

Angels have no thoughts
Of ever returning you
Would they be angry
If I thought of joining you

Gloomy Sunday

Gloomy is Sunday
With shadows I spend it all
My heart and I
Have decided to end it all

Soon there'll be candles
And prayers that are said I know
Let them not weep
Let them know that I'm glad to go

Death is no dream
For in death I'm caressin' you
With the last breath of my soul
I'll be blessin' you

Gloomy Sunday

Dreaming, I was only dreaming
I wake and I find you asleep
In the deep of my heart here

Darling, I hope
That my dream never haunted you
My heart is tellin' you
How much I wanted you
Gloomy Sunday
