		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't mind playing your games
I know what you want
Don't you know I feel the same
Girl I want your love
You want me, baby I can tell
Why deny
Don't you know it's gonna feel good baby if my feeling's right
And I know my feeling's right

I know what's on your mind
Girl you can try but you can't hide it from me
I know what's on your mind
You think it's secret but it's easy to see
I know what's on your mind
Second I saw you I knew where this would go
I know what's on your mind
You don't have to tell me 'cause I already know

I know it's happening fast baby girl that doesn't mean
That this sudden love won't last
Love at first sight is more than just a dream
Dreams come true
Girl I'm looking at you looking at me
This could be true love at last
Just do what you're thinking baby and set your body free

I know what's on your mind
Girl you can try but you can't hide it from me
I know what's on your mind
You think it's secret but it's easy to see
I know what's on your mind
Second I saw you I knew where this would go
I know what's on your mind
You don't have to tell me cause I already know

Why don't we stop playing games
Show me how you feel
How much longer do you think
We can delay the pleasure of what's real
Kiss me now
I know you've wanted to the whole night
Girl it's time to lose this crowd
Take me back home and love me with all of your might

I know what's on your mind
Girl you can try but you can't hide it from me
I know what's on your mind
You think it's secret but it's easy to see
I know what's on your mind
Second I saw you I knew where this would go
I know what's on your mind
You don't have to tell me cause I already know

I know what's on your mind
I know what's on your mind
I know what's on your mind
I know what's on your mind
On your mind
I know what's on your mind
