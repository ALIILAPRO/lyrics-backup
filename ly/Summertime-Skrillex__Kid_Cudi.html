		  Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm

Ooh, it was summer time
Spending every second with you by my side (yeah)
We've been in each other's lives
You're my one and only, count the days they go by (yeah)
See, I was such a damn fool
Almost lost you, gettin' caught up in my thoughts, why? (Yeah)
I just know I'm right where I should be
Ain't no fuckin' way babe I couldn't leave

Ooh, it's me (and on and on and on and on)
Ooh, and we (and on and on and on and on)
Yo, and she didn't really, really, really like me, no
Yo, she didn't really, really, really, really like me, no
Yo (and on and on and on and on)
Yo (and on and on and on and on)

Ooh, it was summer time
'Member receiving blessings from you by my side (yeah)
Remember when we were so damn shy
Now so obsessive, count the days, they go by (yeah)
See, I can't hide the damn truth
All about you, no one else has got my heart now (yeah)
I just know you're right where you should be (uh)
Ever since the day, no, I won't leave

Ooh, it was summer time
Ooh, it was summer time
Ooh, it was summer time
Ooh, it was summer time
