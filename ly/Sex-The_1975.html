		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And this is how it starts
Take your shoes off in the back of my van
You share my shirt, looks so good
When it's just hangin' off your back
And she said, "Use your hands and my spare time
We've got one thing in common, it's this tongue of mine"
She said, oh
She's got a boyfriend anyway

And there's only minutes before I drop you off
All we seem to do it talk about sex
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway
I love your friend when I saw his film
He's got a funny face, but I like that 'cause he still looks cool
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway

Now we're on the bed in my room
And I'm about to fill his shoes
But you say, "No"
You say, "No"
Does he take care of you
Or could I easily fill his shoes?
But you say, "No"
You say, "No"

Now we're just outside of town
As you're making your way down
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway
And I'm not trying to stop you, love
If we're gonna do anything, we might as well just fuck
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway

Got your tongue pierced anyway
You in your high tops any day
You in your skinny jeans anyway
You and your fit friends anyway
I'd take them all out any day
They all got backcombs anyway
They all got boyfriends anyway
