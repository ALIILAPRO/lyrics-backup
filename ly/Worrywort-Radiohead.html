		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't wanna talk to me,
You don't wanna say the words,
You try to get off the hook,
You try to get off the hook.
Sprawling on a pin,
Hanging off the hook,
Trying to get yourself away,
Trying to get yourself away.

There's no use dwelling on,
On what might have been,
Just think of all the fun,
You could be having.

We know the way you talk,
We know what you want,
We know what you want,
What you really wanted.

Take a look around,
There's candles on the cake,
On what might have been,
The road you should have took,
Mistakes mistaken

There's no use dwelling on,
No use dwelling on.

It's such a beautiful day,
It's such a beautiful day,
Find yourself a ????,
Go and get some rest.

It's such a beautiful day.
It's such a beautiful day.
Go up to the mic,
Go up to the mic,
Go and get some rest.
