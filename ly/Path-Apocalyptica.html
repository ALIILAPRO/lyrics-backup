		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want to live in fire
With all the taste I desire
It's all good if you let me dive
With sharks on the ground

You lose your routine
You lose your routine
You lose your routine
'Cause I found my path

What the hell are you trying?
Now I know there is something more
What happened to you?
Still staying on my path

Are you still denying?
Now I know there is something more
That this is the truth
It's all in you

What do you came for?
What did you expect to find?
What do you came for?
What did you expect to find?

What do you came for?
What did you expect to find?
What do you came for?
What did you expect to find?

So boundless I feel
And boundless all my fears
Stop running back to old times

You lose your routine
'Cause I found my path

What the hell are you trying?
Now I know there is something more
What happened to you?
Still staying on my path

Are you still denying?
Now I know there is something more
That this is the truth
It's all in you

What the hell are you trying?
Now I know there is something more
What happened to you?
Still staying on my path

Are you still denying?
Now I know there is something more
That this is the truth
It's all in you
