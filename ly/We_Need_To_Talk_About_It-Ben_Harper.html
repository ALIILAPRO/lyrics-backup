		  Slavery
We need to talk about it (we need to talk about it)
I say Black Lives Matter (ooh)
'Cause history says we don't
You're either a Christian or a racist (ooh)
You can't be both

Slavery
We need to talk about it (we need to talk about it)
What does it say about America
What does it say about Africa
And what (what) does it say (say) about all of us (about all of us)

Whoever said time heals all wounds
Wasn't a slave I'm guessing (I'm guessing)
Hundreds of years
That's just too long of a lesson (we need to talk about it)
What does it say about the buyer (ooh)
And what does it say about the seller (ooh)
And what (what) does it say (say) about all of us (all of us)

How does a ghost forgive? (We need to talk about it)
How are we supposed to live? 
How? Tell me how?(We need to talk about it)
With twelve million taken (oh, Lord)
Not one single reparation (we need to talk about slavery)
What does it say about forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, talk about (we need to talk about it)
Talk about
What does it say about compassion? 
Talk about it (we need to talk about slavery)
About justice
And about fairness (we need to talk about slavery)
And about the law and the land
(We need to talk about it)
About then
What does it say about now?
(We need to talk about slavery)
