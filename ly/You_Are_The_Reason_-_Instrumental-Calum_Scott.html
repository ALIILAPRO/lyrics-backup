		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There goes my heart beatin'
'Cause you are the reason
I'm losing my sleep
Please come back now
And there goes my mind racin'
And you are the reason
That I'm still breathin'
I'm hopeless now

I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason

There goes my hands shakin'
And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleedin'
And I need you now
And if I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour of every day
Keeping you safe

And I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, 'cause I need you to see
That you are the reason

(I don't wanna fight no more)
(I don't wanna hide no more)
(I don't wanna cry no more)
(Come back, I need you to hold me closer now) 
You are the reason, oh
(Just a little closer now) 
(Come a little closer now)
(I need you to hold me tonight)

I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
'Cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
