		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you getting back
Coming to the stage is a girl who's new in town
She goes by the name where your stacks at
This pretty little thing I swear won't let you down
Watch her drop it like (Down down down) hey
Hey

Oh it's not complicated so this won't take a while
You see music make her dance and money money money make her smile

(Gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got) Yeah
(Gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got) Yeah
(Gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got)

Money money money make her smile
(Gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got) Yeah
(Gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got) Yeah
(Gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got)
Money money money make her smile

She's a super freak
You wouldn't know it if you saw her outside these velvet walls
No she don't go where preachers preach
She only go to the church where dollars fall
Watch her drop it like (down, down, down) hey
Hey

Oh it's not complicated so this won't take a while
You see music make her dance and money money money make her smile

(Gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got) Yeah
(Gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got) Yeah
(Gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got)

Money money money make her smile
(Gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got) Yeah
(Gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got) Yeah
(Gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got)
Money money money make her smile

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Watch her

(Gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got, got, got, got, got)
(Gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got, got, got)

Oh it's not complicated so this won't take a while
You see music make her dance and money money money make her smile

(Gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got) Yeah
(Gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got) Yeah
(Gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got)

Money money money make her smile
(Gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got) Yeah
(Gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got) Yeah
(Gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got)
Money money money make her smile
