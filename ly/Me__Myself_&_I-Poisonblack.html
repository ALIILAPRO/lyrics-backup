		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ""\""Lust and you'll rust\""  Enough about you let's talk about me My ego refuses to hear or see To be distressed by your reality  Don't give a fuck about you it's all about me I know I control the struggle to be pseudo-free to keep loss at arms' length to make you bow and bend  So come and get me babe Come invade my mind Chew and tell me what my shit tastes like  So come and take me babe Are you of my kind? Laughing in denial when the end is nigh  Enough about you let's talk about me My disastrous lies will make you bleed for me And I will lure you into my reality  Don't give a fuck about you it's all about me For I am the big star and you're just a wanna-be wanna be  with me Keep your love at arms' length Can't make me bow and bend  So come and get me babe Come invade my mind Chew and tell me what my shit tastes like  So come and take me babe Are you of my kind? Laughing in denial when the end is nigh  So come and get me babe Come invade my mind Chew and tell me what my shit tastes like  So come and take me babe Are you of my kind? Laughing in denial when the end is nigh  So come and get me babe Come invade my mind Chew and tell me what my shit tastes like  So come and take me babe Are you of my kind? Laughing in denial when the end is nigh""
