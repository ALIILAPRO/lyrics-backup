		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been a team player 
Don't feel like playin 
This my life don't feel like wastin it
ct the gig don't feel like hangin 
Shots fired don't feel like bangin shit 
Maybe I should run for mayor cause y'all really ain't changing shit 
cll praises to my creator gave me the keys to flip the game

Came from the trenches 
cin't no lovey dovey
Got bands no funny money 
Got bread im hungry for it
No singles anymore 
Run shit not anymore 
X-ray I see ya core
My soldiers kick ya door

Breakin out the cage and who finna stop me surpressing the rage don't make me bring out Tyson I don't have to chase 
Now the people follow me 
cin't no tryouts for the team 
You should see behind the scenes 

Need someone new on top
They don't wanna leave they spot
Not csian but we got chops
Me movin we got stops
They scheming we got plots
Don't make me set it off so hot they take it off thinking you'll break them off

Naked for what? For nothing 
Your not worth a nothing 
Gotta stand for something 
You can't just live for money
No love respect or life if you don't strive for something 
Better off slitting your throat that body ain't never grow 

Came from the trenches 
cin't no lovey dovey
Got bands no funny money 
Got bread im hungry for it
No singles anymore 
Run shit not anymore 
X-ray I see ya core
My soldiers kick ya door

Yea my anger ain't minor 
Dance with danger get fire
Y'all make deals with the devil 
I report to something much higher
My soul was cryin out
Really free I'm higher now 
Truth serum who lying now
Visionary ain't foggy now 
Talk too much like what is you sayin? 
Steps ahead you not even playin 
Spark your mind could change your soul
I work to the bone cause I ain't made it 
Empty inside you vacant 
Gotta keep that mind sedated 
That lifestyle overrated 
You won't make it if you fake it 
You won't make it if you cover up 
Never full it's never been enough 
Some of y'all get overtaken like the mummy I've awakened this my time here I ain't given up 

Need someone new on top
They don't wanna leave they spot
Not csian but we got chops
Me movin we got stops
They scheming we got plots
Don't make me set it off so hot they take it off thinking you'll break them off
