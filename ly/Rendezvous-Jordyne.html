		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey baby
Can't you see
There's a lot of you
And there's only one of me
It's time to leave
Come meet me
You got all these friends
And I got all these fantasies

Send me that location
Work you out
Need maintenance
East side of the city
Come ride with me
Young and dangerous
I had bad temptations
Keep on getting faded
Don't say that you miss me
Only love you
When you're naked
So, we could split a pill or two
Drop the top
Jump out the roof
Forget the past
And keep it cool
One night
One life
Let's rendezvous
You know me
Know that's all I do
City lights and pretty coupes
Foreign sights and smoky rooms
Bring your friends
Let's rendezvous

You got all these friends
And I got all these fantasies
All these friends
And I got all these fantasies
You got all these friends
And I got all these fantasies
You got all these friends
And I got all these fantasies

Send me that location
Work you out
Need maintenance
East side of the city
Come ride with me
Young and dangerous
I had bad temptations
Keep on getting faded
Don't say that you miss me
Only love you
When you're naked
So, we could split a pill or two
Drop the top
Jump out the roof
Forget the past
And keep it cool
One night
One life
Let's rendezvous
You know me
Know that's all I do
City lights and pretty coupes
Foreign sights and smoky rooms
Bring your friends
Let's rendezvous
