		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here we are
In a room full of strangers
Standing in the dark
Where your eyes couldn't see me

Well, I had to follow you
Though you did not want me to
But that won't stop my lovin' you
I can't stay away

Blamin' it all on the nights on Broadway
Singin' them love songs
Singin' them straight to the heart songs
Blamin' it all on the nights on Broadway
Singin' them sweet sounds
To that crazy, crazy town

Now in my place
There are so many others
Standin' in the line
How long will they stand between us

Well, I had to follow you
Though you did not want me to
But that won't stop my lovin' you
I can't stay away

Blamin' it all (blamin' it all)
On the nights on Broadway (blame it on the nights on Broadway)
Singin' them love songs
Singin' them straight to the heart songs
Blamin' it all (I'm blamin' it all)
On the nights on Broadway (blame it on the nights on Broadway)
Singin' them sweet sounds
To that crazy, crazy town (oh those nights)

I will wait
Even if it takes forever
I will wait
Even if it takes a lifetime
Somehow I feel inside
You never ever left my side
Make it like it was before
Even if it takes a lifetime, takes a lifetime, ooh

Blamin' it all (I'm blamin' it all)
On the nights on Broadway (blame it on the nights on Broadway)
Singin' them love songs (yeah, yeah)
Singin' them straight to the heart songs (yeah, I'm blamin' it all)
Blamin' it all (blamin' it all)
On the nights on Broadway (blame it on the nights on Broadway)
Singin' them sweet sounds (oh yeah)
To that crazy, crazy town (yeah)

Blamin' it all (I'm blamin' it all)
On the nights on Broadway (blame it on the nights on Broadway)
Singin' them love songs (yeah, yeah)
Singin' them straight to the heart songs
Blamin' it all (I'm blamin' it all)
On the nights on Broadway (blame it on the nights on Broadway)
Singin' them sweet sounds (oh yeah yeah)
To that crazy, crazy town (yeah)

Blamin' it all (I'm blamin' it all)
On the nights on Broadway (blame it on the nights on Broadway)
Singin' them love songs (yeah, yeah)
Singin' them straight to the heart songs
Blamin' it all (I'm blamin' it all)
On the nights on Broadway
Singin' them sweet sounds
