		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here I go again 
I'm imagining a world outside, unlike the one I'm in 
Daydreaming again of when I'll get a chance 
There's a world that understands 
But you don't hear the whispers in the room you're walking in 
Daydreaming again, all I need is a chance 

When I feel my fear staring at me
I tell it just wait and see
I know who I'm gonna be
I know who I'm gonna be
The world's half-asleep
It's gonna wake up and see

If it's a million to one 
I'm gonna be that one and 
If it's a shot in the dark 
I'm gonna be the sun 
And I just can't afford to be wrong 
Even when I'm afraid 
You're gonna know my name 
Yeah, you're gonna know my name 

I can barely sleep
'Cause my heart is always racing, chasing, pacing 'round the room 
Living carefully is something I don't wanna do 

When I feel my fear staring at me
I tell it just wait and see
I know who I'm gonna be
I know who I'm gonna be
The world's half-asleep
It's gonna wake up and see

If it's a million to one 
I'm gonna be that one and 
If it's a shot in the dark 
I'm gonna be the sun 
And I just can't afford to be wrong 
Even when I'm afraid 
You're gonna know my name
Yeah, you're gonna know my name 

I can see her now and then
The one I know that I could be
Yeah
I see her laughing
'Cause she knew all along in her head
So when the light is hard to see
She's telling me

If it's a million to one 
I'm gonna be that one and
If it's a shot in the dark
I'm gonna be the sun and I
I just can't afford to be wrong (na, na, na, na, na)
Even when I'm afraid 
You're gonna know my name
You're gonna know my name (oh)
You're gonna know my name 
You're gonna know my name, yeah
You're gonna know my name
You're gonna know my name
