		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're everywhere that I turn
Feel like I'm losing it
It gets so hard to discern
What's reeling in my head
I should be more concerned
But I don't think there's
Nothing I can do, nothing I can do...

You're haunting me
You're haunting me
You're haunting me
You're haunting
You're haunting me
You're haunting me
You're haunting me...

(Go)

You're everywhere that I turn
Feel like I'm losing it
It gets so hard to discern
What's reeling in my head
I should be more concerned
But I don't think there's
Nothing I can do, nothing I can do...

You're haunting me
You're haunting me
You're haunting me
You're haunting
You're haunting me
You're haunting me
You're haunting me...

You're haunting me
You're haunting me
You're haunting me
You're haunting
You're haunting me
You're haunting me
You're haunting me...

(You have now reached... your destination)
(Go)

(Malfunction-)
