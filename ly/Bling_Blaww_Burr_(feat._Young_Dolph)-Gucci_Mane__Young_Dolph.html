		  Whew, Big Gucci
Hah, whew
(Metro Boomin want some more)

Bling blaww
Bling blaww
Bling burr
Burr blaww
Whew, whew
Bling blaww
Bling burr
Burr blaww

You see this car I'm riding in cost 500,000
Tell them pussy ass niggas they should look at me now
Niggas say that they gon' run up on the Gucci but how?
And tell your sister I don't love her, I'm in love with her mouth
I'm from East Atlanta Georgia, I'm in love with the south
I put an ounce in the pot and make it Bankhead bounce
My mama found some sacks on me, kicked me out of her house
But I had 40,000 saved, I shoulda been moved out
You know Guwop been iced out but I got new jewels now
Think I'm a clone but if they cut me this sauce gon' ooze out
I made these haters lose they cool, I done changed the rules
When real niggas walk in the room then they change the mood
It's Gucci

Bling blaww
Bling blaww
Bling burr
Burr blaww
Whew, whew
Bling blaww
Bling burr
Burr blaww

She got good head and a fat onion
She only fuck niggas with money
I killed that pussy all in her tummy
Then I asked that bitch "who run it?"
She said she waiting, I said I'm coming
I'm on the e-way doing 100
Bitch I got dope to sell
Fresh as fuck like I got hoes for sale
Can't fuck with a bitch that don't listen
Two bitches in the car with me kissing
In Detroit balling like a Piston
All this hot sauce got me dripping
Blow out the candles, make a wish
Your bitch is like a side dish
I might fuck with her, I might not
Depend on if I feel like or not
She only fuck with niggas with them stacks
Yeah bitch my motor in the back
I just wanna hit her from the back
I might dump her then take her back
My bitch mad at me but I fixed and bought her a bag
I just walked in the bank with a whole quarter in cash

Bling blaww, bling burr
I'm a street nigga with money and that's obvious
She only fuck niggas with money and that's obvious
I'ma keep that shit 100 and that's obvious
And this watch here cost 100 and that's obvious
I'm a street nigga with money and that's obvious
She only fuck niggas with money and that's obvious
I'ma keep that shit 100 and that's obvious
And this watch here cost 100 and that's obvious

Bling blaww
Bling blaww
Bling burr
Burr blaww
Whew, whew
Bling blaww
Bling burr

Metro Boomin want some more nigga
