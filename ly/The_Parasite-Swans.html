		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Breathe my breath into your head
Righteous, pure and sour with death
Here I am, just empty skin
There is no way out there is no way in
Crucified in fractured fields of blue
All information is equally true feed on me
Feed on me feed on me now
Feed on me feed on me
Feed on me now

Over the plain and under the seas
Follow the lines: they all lead back to me
Tunnel the mountains and cut
Through the skies
Cut open your belly, look into my еyes
Come to me comе to me
Come to me now come to me
Come to me come to me now

You are not free you are not free
Come to me come to me
Come here to me you are not free
You are not free you must come to me
You must come to me you are not free
You are not free come to me
Come to me come here to me
Come to me feed on me
Come to me feed on me

I wonder what you are i wonder where I am
I wonder if the water is swallowing the land
I wonder if an image in realer than the thing
I wonder if I'm singing what
You're thinking me to sing
I wonder if I lost you
You were pulsing in my hand
Now the continents are shifting
From the future to the past
The deeper into space
The smaller that you'll go
The more that you consume
The less you'll ever know
I wonder where I was i wonder where this is
I wonder what's inside you
Will the glass reveal your bliss?
Am I broken into pieces to
Be scattered in the wind?
When the revelation comes
Does it erase the host that lives
In the body of a sun
That it'self exists within
An ever-shrinking sphere
That is contracting as we spin?
I wonder how we got here i wonder if I care
I wonder if your breathing is
Stealing all the air breathing in
Breathe us in breathing in
Breathe us in read my mind
Reach inside read my mind
Reach inside breathing in
Breathe us in
