		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We don't know where they want us to go
No I don't answer a call, let it froze
They post up like soldier, nights been they home
They home
They home

Evil he runs, and they running the code
They don't give fucks where you from, who you know
Don't press the jump, mental running my world
My world
My world

But I, wanna give my life
I'm out of sight, run until the light
And I been alive
But run out of time
But run out of time

You all don't send it like that
Bitch I might send it right back
Fuck where your problems at
I want them all detached
Remember my world collapsed
But this been a better past
Remember my world collapsed
Remember my world collapse
Eyes riding by me
Hollow my mind, she spot me
Pass right by, fam role deep
Man go pop, no drop top, woah
Handle those thoughts, that tone
Handle those thoughts, that tone
She gonna move like dancer
Got to move all my weight up
How I been worried bout answers
Dreaded my line, can't catch up
Ain't no lie out my dental
Ain't no lie out my dental

We don't know where they want us to go
No I don't answer a call, let it froze
They post up soldier, the nights been they home
They home
Been they home

Evil he runs, and they running the code
They don't give fucks where you from, who you know
Don't press the jump, mental running my world
My world
My world
