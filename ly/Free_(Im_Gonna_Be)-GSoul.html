		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the names, all my stuff, all my memories 
I've been carrying on
Now I'm determined to be just dropping off 
All the heavy baggage I'm dropping off 

All I want is to be me 
And that shouldn't be something so hard to do
Why did I make it so hard to do when 
No one is above me but who I've been praying to 

Oh somewhere 
I'll never ever have to feel the weight again 
Oh somewhere 
I'd never have to feel the same pain again 

I'm gonna be, just wanna be
I'm tryna be free from me 
Free from me 
No more settling for any less than I deserve 
And be my own worst enemy, I

I'm gonna be, just wanna be
I'm tryna be free from me 
Free from me 
No more keepin' myself hostage from my own damn self and 
Be my own worst enemy 

All my life, I had to fight 
Thought I had to fight for everything 'til now 
Now I'm too high above the fray to be 
I'm loving all of me today 

Oh somewhere 
I'll never have to feel the weight again 
Oh somewhere 
Never have to feel the same pain again 

I'm gonna be, just wanna be 
I'm tryna be free from me 
Free from me 
No more settling for any less than I deserve 
And be my own worst enemy, I 
I'm gonna be, just wanna be 
I'm tryna be free from me 
Free from me
No more keepin' myself hostage from my own damn self and 
Be my own worst enemy
