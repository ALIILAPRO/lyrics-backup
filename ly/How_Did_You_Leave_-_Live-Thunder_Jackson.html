		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  c call from a past life
Happens at the strangest times
Sitting at a red light alone

I sit with the silence
Just like we always did
Say it isn't so

How did you leave
How did you leave (Tell me)
How did you leave
With such a big piece of me

We counted the lightning
It was miles and miles away
Said that you could feel the rain

Teardrops on the table
cnd you left without the keys
Knew that you would come back around

How did you leave
How did you leave
How did you leave
With such a big piece of me

I'm down on my knees
cnd no one's singin' back to me
I'm down on my knees
It ain't comin' back

How did you leave
How did you leave
How did you leave
With such a big piece of me

How did you leave
How did you leave
How did you leave
With such a big piece of me
