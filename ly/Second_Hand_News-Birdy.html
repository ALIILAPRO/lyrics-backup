		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a book of mistakes
And it's just getting worse
Every new one I make
Is a rumour you heard

'Cause these days I'm self-destructive the way I love
I push away every chance
'Cause it's never enough, my love

You can take the things they say
As the bitter truth
Don't throw it all away
On second hand news

'Cause if I just let go
If my heart could choose
I would burn these bridges I've built
And find my way back to you
No, don't throw it all away
On second hand news

Been a broken machine
Since the day you've been gone
On a loop in a dream
Did you think I'd move on?

You can take the things they say
As the bitter truth
But don't throw it all away
On second hand news

'Cause if I just let go
If my heart could choose
I would burn these bridges I've built
And find my way back to you
I'd leave it all behind
I've got nothing to lose
And I know you've heard what you've heard
But it doesn't mean it's true
No, don't throw it all away
On second hand news

Crying silent tears in the next-door room
'Cause everybody's here but you
So I wrote you out this message
But I stopped myself from sending it off

(Ah, ah, ah)

If I just let go
If my heart could choose
I would burn these bridges I've built
And find my way back to you
Leave it all behind
I've got nothing to lose
And I know you've heard what you've heard
But it doesn't mean it's true
No, don't throw it all away
On second hand news

No, don't throw it all away
On second hand news
