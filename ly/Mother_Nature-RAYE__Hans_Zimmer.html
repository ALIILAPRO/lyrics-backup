		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Good morning, 
Mother Nature painted the sky for us
This dawning 
She took some crimson reds and melts them into oranges 
She hides the moon behind the curtains safe out of sight 
Then she'll open them up to prepare for the night 

As she breathes and she blows 
The trees they stretch their arms
As they dance they've rehearsed it 
The ocean roars like a thousand lions standing proud 
Oh Mother Nature you're just showing off now 

As it rains 
How she cries 
For as she burns for us
She still turns for us 

And so she will provide 
For as long oh as long as she can 

She'll be beautiful 
So beautiful 
For as much as she can stand 

Forgive us Mother Nature 
For we know not what we do 

But in her dress of green and blue 
She still turns, she still turns
And she's still turning 

And so she will provide 
For as long for as long as she can 

She'll be beautiful 
So beautiful 
For as much as she can stand 

Forgive us Mother Nature 
For we know not what we do 

But in her dress of green and blue 
She still turns, and she still turns
And she's still turning

In her dress of green and blue
And she's still turning hmm
