		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, baby used to stay out all night long.
She made me cry, she done me wrong.
She hurt my eyes open, that's no lie.
Table's turning, now her turn to cry.

Because I used to love her but it's all over now.
Because I used to love her but it's all over now.
Well, she used to run around with every man in town.
Spent all my money playing a high class game.
She put me out, it was a pity how I cried.
The table's turned and now, her turn to cry.

Because I used to love her but it's all over now.
Because I used to love her but it's all over now.
Well, I used to wake up in the morning, get my breakfast in bed.
When I gotten worried, she could ease my aching head.
But now she's here and there with every man in town.
Instead of trying to take me for that same old clown.

Because I used to love her but it's all over now.
Because I used to love her but it's all over now.
Because I used to love her but its all over now.
