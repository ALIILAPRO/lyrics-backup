		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want it all
Make the pussy go, deep
Make the dick go slidin', divin'
Backwards down my throat

Niggas call me Billie, Billie, Billie Jean
Better know what I'm about
'Cause I make 'em pay the bills to get in my jeans
And then I just suck it up
Bought a Lambo just for a fuckin' queen
And still wouldn't let 'em sleep on my couch
I said, "Baby, I know you don't walk at all
But you can let that dick moonwalk up in my mouth" 

I throw the pussy in his face, told him, "Don't be a diva"
Turn his face to J. Cole, I wanna see no features
If the pubic hairs long, I suck his dick with some tweezers
Snatch a soul out a nigga like you cleaning some sneakers
I need child support for the kids in my throat (uh-huh)
Been feedin' 'em food and damn near broke (damn)
When the dick disappeared, looked like it eloped
Gawk, gawk, gawk, gawk, is the words I spoke (oh)
He said, "Let's go to Sip N Paint, catch a vibe, you know?"
I said, "It's COVID-19, motherfucker they closed
But I could sit up on your dick and you could paint my face"
I'll give that dick a fresh tip and make it cum all day
I sit on your face and sit on your friends, who cares? (hmm)
On both of y'all, shit, I'm playin' musical chairs 
If they not playin' hide and seek, he sayin', "Where you at?"
I like the balls in my court so I suck it from the back, come on (hmm, yes)

Billie, Billie, Billie Jean
Better know what I'm about
'Cause I make 'em pay the bills to get in my jeans
And then I just suck it up
Bought a Lambo just for a fuckin' queen
And still wouldn't let 'em sleep on my couch
I said, "Baby, I know you don't walk at all
But you can let that dick moonwalk up in my mouth" 

He gonna give me, give me, give me everything I need
Yeah, I keep a trickin', talkin' out my sleeve
If he can't pay, I'll just replace his D
I stay with two different niggas like I'm Angela Yee
Okay, my mouth a talk show, come shoot it up like The Joker (oh)
These ain't no dry walls, you can hang up a poster
Bootyhole worth Gayle, Pussy hole worth Oprah
When he calls it says "Ikea", use his head as a sofa (yeah, aye)
Come and eat this box like Castle Slider
The throat spit more than a mumble rapper (hmm)
I'm rubbin' this clit 'til the shit just spatter (oh, oh)
He stay up on the pussy like I'm holdin' my bladder (ooh, babe)
Then give me Dirty Diana with the MJ lines
I throw it back on the dick, that's remember the times
Then let you buss on my face so my skin get clearer (hmm)
I hope it wasn't what it was to see that man in the mirror, ah

Billie, Billie, Billie Jean
Better know what I'm about
'Cause I make 'em pay the bills to get in my jeans
And then I just suck it up
Bought a Lambo just for a fuckin' queen
And still wouldn't let 'em sleep on my couch
I said, "Baby, I know you don't walk at all
But you can let that dick moonwalk up in my mouth" 

Make the pussy go
Make the dick go
Make the pussy go
Make the dick go
