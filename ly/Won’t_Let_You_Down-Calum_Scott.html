		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The love of your life, is treating you wrong
You stand by his side, he lies all alone

It's the fairytale you want
But the glimmer in your eyes have gone
And now you're alone, I'll lend you my shoulder to cry on

I won't let you down, this time around
I'll show you how, no matter how far
Don't care where you are, I won't let you down

Thanks for the tears, the pain that you caused
And now you're just a memory
An old familiar melody, she's heard before

It's a fairytale you ended
Done with your pretending you're the fool
Oh, you're the fool
And now she's alone, I'll give her my hand to hold on to

I won't let you down, this time around
And I'll show you how, no matter how far
Don't care where you are, I won't let you down

And I see now, my eyes are open
I'm all yours, tears have spoken
I can't fix all that is broken
My feet on the ground
But I won't let you down, this time around
I'll show you how, no matter how far

But I won't let you down, this time around
And I'll show you how, no matter how far
Don't care where you are, I won't let you down
