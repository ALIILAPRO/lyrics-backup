		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh, oh 
I, I was a city boy
Riding to danger's where I'd always run 
A boy who had his fun
But I wouldn't have done
All the things that I have done
If I knew one day you'd come
Now, baby (now, baby), now, baby (now, baby)

Oh, oh, oh, I, I know it breaks your heart
To picture the only one you wanna love
In someone else's arms, but I wouldn't have done
All the things that I have done
If I knew one day you'd come
Now, baby (now, baby), now, baby (now, baby)

Oh, baby, please
let's leave the past behind us, behind us
So that we can go where love will find us
Yeah, will find us
I know once girls would leave me
But I know that you believe me

Baby, I, I wish we were seventeen
So I could give you all the innocence
That you give to me
No, I wouldn't have done
All the things that I've done
If I knew one day you'd come
If I knew one day you'd come
