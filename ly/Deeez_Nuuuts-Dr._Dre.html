		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just let me call this old bitch, see what this bitch doin'
Call this bitch, raggedy-ass, shit, man
Hello?
What's up?
Nothin', what you doin'?
Nothin' just kickin' it
Are y'all done?
Nah, what you gon' do today?
Um, pick up my clothes from the cleaners, I needa go get my nails done
Serious?
Why? What's up?
Ayy, did, did, did what's-your-name them get at you yesterday?
Who?
Deez nuts
Aw, shut up, nigga

But I wanna ask you one question
If I had some nuts hangin' on the wall
What do I have, honey?
I said, "Darlin' you got some walnuts"
She said, "Well, daddy, if I had some nuts on my chest would those be chestnuts?
I said, "Hell yeah"
She said, "Well, daddy, if I had nuts under my chin would those be chinnuts?"
I said, "Hell no, bitch, you'd have a dick in your mouth"

Chiggidy-check, microphone check one
Chiggidy-check, microphone check two
Chiggidy-check, microphone check three
Check game from the notorious Compton G

Back with some shit that gots to bump
As you pull up in the park you pops the trunk
Just to floss it like a motherfucker, clownin' and shit
Got your Danas on your hooptie and your fly ass bitch
Throw off, go off, show off, I take that ho
If she proper I'ma pop her, the ho hopper
It's back on the track
With big money, big nuts and a big fat chronic sack

So Daz, step up on the ass
And give these motherfuckers a blast from the past

Diggidy Daz out of the cut with some shit that I wrote
With my nigga D-R-E, so you know I must be dope
But uh, rat-tat-tat-tat that ass
Startin' static with Dre, make way for the AK
That I bring as I slang like cavi
Not from Kris Kross but they call me Mac Daddy
Had he not known about the city I'm from
Long Beach, Tic Tac, grab your gat, watch your back
Here I come, stompin' in my khaki suit
B.G from the hood, kinfolk Eastwood
Goddamn, I ripped up, flipped up, and skipped up
On top of things as they swing towards my ding-a-ling

But did you raise up off his nuts?
'Cause Dr. Drizzay's about to rizzip shit up

Chiggidy-check, microphone check one
Chiggidy-check, microphone check two
Chiggidy-check, microphone check three
You tuned to the sounds of the D-R-E

Now check me out, it's back to the old school
Where the niggas get their scrap on, don't nobody cap on
Slap on some D-R-E
Or some funky ass shit by the D-O double-G-Y D-O double-G
Real G's who drop ki's, protect these N-U-T's, so nigga, please
Peep out my manuscript
You'll see that it's a must, I drop gangsta shit (biatch)
So recognize game from the gangsta
Things will remain the same until I change 'em

It's real easy to see
So you can check sounds from Nate D-O-double G

I can't be faded
I'm a nigga from the motherfuckin' street
I can't be faded
I'm a nigga from the motherfuckin' street
I can't be faded
I'm a nigga from the motherfuckin' street
I can't be faded
I'm a nigga from the motherfuckin' street

I heard you wanna fuck with Dre
You picked the wrong motherfuckin' day
Here we go, toe to toe, flow for flow
Let me know if you think you can fade Death Row
I heard you wanna fuck with Dre
You picked the wrong motherfuckin' day
Here we go, toe to toe, flow for flow
Let me know if you think you can fade Death Row

I can't be faded
I'm a nigga from the motherfuckin' street
I can't be faded
I'm a nigga from the motherfuckin' street
