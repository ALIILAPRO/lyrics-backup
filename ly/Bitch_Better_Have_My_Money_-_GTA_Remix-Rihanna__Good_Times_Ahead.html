		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yayo, yayo
Moo-la-lah
Yayo

Bitch better have my money
Y'all should know me well enough
Bitch better have my money
Please don't call me on my bluff
Pay me what you owe me
Ballin' bigger than LeBron
Bitch, give me your money
Who y'all think y'all frontin' on?
Bitch better have my money

Bitch better have my

Like brrap, brrap, brrap

Bitch better have my

Like brrap, brrap, brrap
Louis XIII and it's all on me, nigga you just bought a shot
Kamikaze if you think that you gon' knock me off the top
Shit, your wife in the backseat of my brand new foreign car
Don't act like you forgot, I call the shots, shots, shots

Where y'all at, where y'all at,where y'all at
Like brrap, brrap, brrap
Where y'all at, where y'all at, where y'all at
Like brrap, brrap, brrap
Where y'all at, where y'all at, where y'all at
Like brrap, brrap, brrap
Where y'all at, Where y'all at, where y'all at

Bitch better have my money
Y'all should know me well enough
Bitch better have my money
Please don't call me on my bluff
Pay me what you owe me
Ballin' bigger than LeBron
Bitch, give me your money
Who y'all think y'all frontin' on?
Bitch better have my
Bitch better have my
Bitch better have my
Bitch better have my
Bitch better have my

Like brrap, brrap, brrap

Bitch better have my

Bitch better have my money

Turn up to Rihanna while the whole club fuckin' wasted
Every time I drive by, I'm the only thing you're playin'
In a drop top, doin' hundred, y'all in my rear view mirror racin'
In a drop top, doin' hundred, y'all in my rear view mirror racin'
Where y'all at? Where y'all at? Where y'all at?
Like brrap, brrap, brrap
Where y'all at? Where y'all at? Where y'all at?
Like brrap, brrap, brrap
Where y'all at? Where y'all at? Where y'all at?
Like brrap, brrap, brrap
Where y'all at? Where y'all at? Where y'all at?

Bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money
