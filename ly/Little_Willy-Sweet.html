		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  North side, east side
Little Willy, Willy wears the crown
He's the king around town
Dancing, glancing
Willy drives them silly
With his star shoe shimmy shuffle down
Way past one and feeling all right
'Cause with little Willy round
They can last all night
Hey down, stay down, stay down down

'Cause little Willy, Willy won't go home
But you can't push Willy 'round
Willy won't go, try tellin' everybody but, oh no
Little Willy, Willy won't go home

Uptown, downtown
Little Willy, Willy drives them wild
With his run around style
Inside, outside
Willy sends them silly
With his star shine shimmy shuffle smile
Mama done chase Willy down through the hall
But laugh, Willy laugh, he don't care at all
Hey down, stay down, stay down, down

'Cause little Willy, Willy won't go home
But you can't push Willy 'round
Willy won't go, try tellin' everybody but, oh no
Little Willy, Willy won't go home

Little Willy, Willy won't
Willy won't, Willy won't
Little Willy, Willy won't
Willy won't, Willy won't
Little Willy, Willy won't
Willy won't, Willy won't
Little Willy, Willy won't
Willy won't, Willy won't

Little Willy, Willy won't go home
But you can't push Willy 'round
Willy won't go
Try tellin' everybody but, oh no
Little Willy, Willy won't go home

Little Willy, Willy won't go home
But you can't push Willy 'round
Willy won't go
Try tellin' everybody but, oh no
Little Willy, Willy won't go home
