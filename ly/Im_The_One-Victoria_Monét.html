		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I could be riding horseback towards you, slow motion on the beach
Titties bouncin' and everything
I could be the one you sit right next to
Every time you get on a train
Or the one that you compliment often, that knows all your problems
'Cause I'm the one you call to vent
I could be right in your face, screamin' at you
While I'm waving a sign that says, "Heaven-sent"

And you still wouldn't see
I'm the one you need
Why can't you see
I'm the one you need?

Yeah, I'm the one, I'm the one
You would've already won
If you knew I was the one
The one
I'm the one, I'm the one
You would've already won
If you knew I was the one
The one

And even if you wrote a whole list 'bout a bitch
Naming every wish
Then God whispered you my name
And then angels appeared and carried me
Out of here into your bed and I gave it to you perfect
And if it felt like home anytime we're alone
You would still be a runaway
I wonder what it is
Is it fear?

Oh, why can't you, why can't you see
I'm the one you need?
Why can't you see
I'm the one you need?

Yeah, I'm the one, I'm the one
You would've already won
If you knew I was the one
The one
I'm the one, I'm the one
You would've already won
If you knew I was the one
The one

Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me, love me, love, love me
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Love me, love me, love me, won't you love me, love me, love, love me
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Ooh
