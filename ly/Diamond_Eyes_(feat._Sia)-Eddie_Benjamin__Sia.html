		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It can be it partially
But it's usually that something historical has come up
And might've feel really personal to us (yes)
Really rejecting
But I'm really good at helping counsel for that stuff, so
Just always let me know, I'm always here

When the past comes to day
Put your fears on display
Let your tears runaway
I am here, my baby
Let your wing make me sing
On my firstborn earthling
So much joy, do you bring
Little wind, little wind

Oh, will you, oh, will you
Treat her with the tenderness
I promise you, I promise you
I'll treat her with the kindness
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

So when you wanna cry
Just know that I'll be by your side
And when you wanna hide
I'll give you wings so you can fly, oh

Diamond eyes (diamond eyes)
Diamond eyes (diamond eyes)
Diamond eyes (diamond eyes)
Diamond eyes

If I asked you to dance
Would you please hold my hand?
You know I'm such a fiend
Of that old school romance
You're an endless sunset
That I'll never ever forget
You're my heartbeat, my breath
You're my life, you're my death

I promise you, I promise you
I'll treat her with the tenderness
Oh, will you, oh, will you
Treat her with the kindness?

So when you wanna cry
Just know that I'll be by your side
And when you wanna hide
I'll give you wings so you can fly
I wanna catch all your tears
I'll take the fall for all your fears
I wanna love you tonight
My baby, with those diamond eyes, oh

Diamond eyes (diamond eyes)
Diamond eyes (diamond eyes)
Diamond eyes (diamond eyes)
Diamond eyes

Diamond eyes (you'll always have me to come over)
Diamond eyes (diamond eyes)
Diamond eyes (you'll always have me to come over)
Diamond eyes
