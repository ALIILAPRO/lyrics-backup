		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We focus on your death
We focus on your death
You share not the blood of our, our, ours
Thus we focus on your death

We focus on your death
We focus on your death
You share not the blood of our, our, ours
Thus we focus on your death

We focus on your death
We focus on your death
We focus on your death
We focus on your death
You share not the blood of our, our, ours
Thus we focus on your death

We focus on your death
We focus on your death
You share not the blood of our, our, ours
Thus we focus on your death

We focus on your death
We focus on your death
We focus on your death
We focus on your death
You share not the blood of our, our, ours
Thus we focus on your death

We focus on your death
We focus on your death
You share not the blood of our, our, ours
Thus we focus on your death

We focus on your death
We focus on your death
We focus on your death
We focus on your death
You share not the blood of our, our, ours
Thus we focus on your death

We focus on your death
We focus on your death
You share not the blood of our, our, ours
Thus we focus on your death

We focus on your death
We focus on your death
You share not the blood of our, our, ours
Thus we focus on your death

We focus on your death
We focus on your death
You share not the blood of our, our, ours
Thus we focus on your death

We focus on your death
