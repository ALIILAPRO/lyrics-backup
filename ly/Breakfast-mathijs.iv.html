		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't believe I get to call you mine
I think about you like all the time
Last night you looked so good
Black dress, high heels, gold hoops
I think that you're so cool
But my favourite you is when we drive to breakfast
Hair back, hoodie and jeans
I missed the exit cause you were looking at me
And singing oh oh oh, in the passenger seat
You're the most beautiful thing that I've ever seen
I don't believe in much
I'm an atheist
When we touch I go 'Thank god!"
Not polyamorous
Want it all for us
I got jealous like last night
Last night you looked so good
Saw them staring at you
They don't know you like I do
And they're never gonna drive you home from breakfast
Hair back, hoodie and jeans
I missed the exit cause you were looking at me
And singing oh oh oh, in the passenger seat
You're the most beautiful thing that I've ever seen
And it's been 6 years now waking up in a dream
I bought a king size bed just to share with my queen
We're singing "Oh oh oh" while we're brushing our teeth
Put on a boy band tee then you throw me the keys
Let's drive to breakfast
Hair back, hoodie and jeans
I missed the exit cause you were looking at me
And singing oh oh oh, in the passenger seat
You're the most beautiful thing that I've ever seen
And singing oh oh oh, in the passenger seat
You're the most beautiful thing that I've ever seen
