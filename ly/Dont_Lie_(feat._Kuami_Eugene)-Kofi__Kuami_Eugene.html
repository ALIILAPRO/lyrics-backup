		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ain't got the time 

For you to play me 

I don't need no women in my life 

Saying save me 

When you say you love me don't lie 

Baby 

When you say you love me don't lie 

Don't lie 

Don't 

Yeah 

 

Where you at? 

Where you been? 

Tell me you've been anywhere except with him 

Tell me you're an angel and you're innocent 

Tell me that I'm crazy I aint trynna spin 

 

Lie to me 

Lie to me 

Tell me I should trust you then you lie to me 

You try to piss me off and then you cry to me 

Cry to me 

You know 

 

I ain't got the time 

For you to play me 

I don't need no women in my life 

Saying save me 

When you say you love me don't lie 

Baby 

When you say you love me don't lie 

Don't lie 

 

Rockstar 

Yeah 

You don't tell me the truth hey 

So I put all your s*** back in your suitcase 

It's over with the dirty games you been play 

How you steady clubbing on a Tuesday? 

Girl you're too fake 

F*** it I'll be ready for ya 

I heard you f*** with Jeremiah 

Now you're just a bloody liar 

Why can't you just treat me better? 

We should be there for one another 

 

Ohhhh 

 

I never envisioned that you gon' do me this way 

Gave you all my heart and you sold it on Ebay 

Let the song play 

Put it on replay 

I can do away the pain but let the scar stay 

 

I promise baby Imma find a way 

Aint gon' be here in another day 

All day all day you know girl imma be here for you anyday 

Good bye for drama days 

F*** you baby you could run away 

Don't come between my sanity 

Imma be back on my feet again 

 

I ain't got the time 

For you to play me 

I don't need no women in my life 

Saying save me 

When you say you love me don't lie 

Baby 

When you say you love me don't lie 

Don't lie 

Don't 

Yeah
