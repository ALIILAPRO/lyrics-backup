		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know who I am today
Pristine, rotting in my brain
Impossible not to miss me
At least you still think I'm pretty
Different editions, it's all the same

Better suck it up,
baby you'll be out of luck
Better keep the money coming
or you'll never be enough
Your tears are worth buying
Your pain is enticing them

Guessing it's a bit fucked up
Guess you know a little and a little too much
Staying too in til I'm out of touch
Keep it quiet cause you're being too loud
Blinding myself in front of the crowd
What the hell am I if you're not around?

I can be everything you want
So I'll play nice, learn how to be soft

Better suck it up,
baby you'll be out of luck
Better keep the money coming
or you'll never be enough
Your tears are worth buying
Your pain is enticing them

Guessing it's a bit fucked up
Guess you know a little and a little too much
Staying too in til I'm out of touch
Keep it quiet cause you're being too loud
Blinding myself in front of the crowd
What the hell am I if you're not around?

Guessing it's a bit fucked up
Guess you know a little and a little too much
Staying too in til I'm out of touch
Keep it quiet cause you're being too loud
Blinding myself in front of the crowd
What the hell am I if you're not around?

Guessing it's a bit fucked up
Guess you know a little and a little too much
Staying too in til I'm out of touch
Keep it quiet cause you're being too loud
Blinding myself in front of the crowd
What the hell am I if you're not around?
