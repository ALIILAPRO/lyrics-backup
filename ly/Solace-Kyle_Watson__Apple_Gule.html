		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I sit here in the silence
I'm my own worst enemy
Starting to fight minus the violence
So what is happening to me?

Maybe drank just way too much again
Feels like I'm falling from a dream
Feels like my heart has been ripped out and then
Whiskey's my ecstasy

I just wish that you would stay (Would stay)
Oh please don't leave me, leave me this way (Leave me this way)
Needing you is my silence
I will change that, I promise

I just wish that you would stay
Oh please don't leave me, leave me this way
Needing you is my silence
I will change that, I promise

I will change that I promise

I sit here in the silence
I'm my own worst enemy
Starting to fight minus the violence
So what is happening to me?

Maybe drank just way too much again
Feels like I'm falling from a dream
Feels like my heart has been ripped out and then
Whiskey's my ecstasy

I just wish that you would stay (You would stay)
Oh please don't leave me, leave me this way (Way)
Needing you is my silence
I will change that, I promise

I just wish that you would stay (You would stay)
Oh please don't leave me, leave me this way
Needing you is my silence
I will change that, I promise
