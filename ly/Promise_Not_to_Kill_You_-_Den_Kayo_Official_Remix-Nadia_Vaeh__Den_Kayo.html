		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh the world burns 
I think I've grown horns
cre we living in the upside-down
You're my new thrill
cnd I've got looks to kill
In a glance, we're taking this whole town

Going into overdrive
Gonna be some wild nights
I'll be your ride or die
cnd even though the fights

No bedtime - up all night 	
Sleep till the afternoon
Through the fights 
Ride or die
I love you to the moon
These 4 walls hide it all 
I won't be leaving soon
Kiss my neck Juliette 
cnd I promise not to kill you

Like a tattoo 
I'm always with you
No one else can handle me confined
Write my small
In case we lose it all
We may wanna call quits sometimes 


Going into overdrive
Gonna be some wild nights
I'll be your ride or die
cnd even though the fights

No bedtime - up all night 	
Sleep till the afternoon
Through the fights 
Ride or die
I love you to the moon
These 4 walls hide it all 
I won't be leaving soon
Kiss my neck Juliette 
cnd I promise not to kill you

Under the sheets 
I know how to fix this fight 
Don't speak
Don't think twice

cnd I promise not to kill 

Under the sheets 
I know how to fix this fight 
Don't speak
Don't think twice


Under the sheets 
I know how to fix this fight 
Don't speak
Don't think twice

Under the sheets 
I know how to fix this fight 
Don't speak
Don't think twice

Under the sheets (no bedtime ....)
I know how to fix this fight 
Don't speak
Don't think twice
No bedtime - up all night 	
Sleep till the afternoon
Through the fights 
Ride or die
I love you to the moon
These 4 walls hide it all 
I won't be leaving soon
Kiss my neck Juliette 
cnd I promise not to kill you

Under the sheets (no bedtime ....)
I know how to fix this fight 
Don't speak
Don't think twice

cnd I promise not to kill you
