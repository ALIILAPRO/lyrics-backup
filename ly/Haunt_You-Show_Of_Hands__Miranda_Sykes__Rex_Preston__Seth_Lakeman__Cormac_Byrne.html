		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A year at sea your letter came
Shattered all my plans
You set me free, you changed your name
I stretch out these hands
On board ship the news flies fast
No one meets my eye
I've nailed your ring onto the mast
Pray my curses fly

I'll haunt you
Haunt your bed
Tap the window, wake in dread
You'll pray that you loved me instead
I'll haunt you, I'll softly tread
I'll haunt you
Sleep in fear
Whisper curses in your ear
A course right through your heart I'll steer
I'll haunt you, I will be near
And I will haunt you

I pace the deck from stem to stern
A thousand times or more
Half a year from my return
Thoughts fly back to shore
You promised me you would be strong
You said that you'd be true
You can tell yourself I'm long gone
Here's what I will do

I'll haunt you
Haunt your bed
Tap the window, wake in dread
You'll pray that you loved me instead
I'll haunt you, I'll softly tread
I'll haunt you
Sleep in fear
Whisper curses in your ear
A course right through your heart I'll steer
I'll haunt you
I will be near and
I will haunt you
