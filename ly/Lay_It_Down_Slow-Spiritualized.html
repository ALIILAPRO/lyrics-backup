		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you got dreams in your heart
Why don't you share them with me?
And if dreams don't come true
I'll make sure that you're nightmares
Are through

If you got pain in your heart
Why don't you share it with me?
And we'll just wait and see
If it's half what it used to be

And lay it down slow
Lay it down free
Lay it down easy
But lay it on me

If you've got love in your heart
Why don't you keep it with mine?
I can't promise a miracle
But I'll always be trying

And lay it down slow
Lay it down free
Lay it down easy
But lay it on me

Lay it down easy
Lay it on me

Lay it down easy
But lay it on me
