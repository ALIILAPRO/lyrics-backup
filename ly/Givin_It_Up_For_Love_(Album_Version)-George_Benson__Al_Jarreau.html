		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give, give, givin' it up
This is my story
And over the story
Givin' it up for love

This is my story
I gave it up to love
Let me tell you how

I could have been an architect
I could have been a doctor
Been a good police detective
Looking for a robber

[Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible]
Could put up a real good fight
I got good chance but I'm givin' it up for love

I could have been an architect
I could have been a doctor
Been a good police detective
Looking for a robber

Through solo Shanghai
I'm born to make Lee a loner
Could put up a real good fight
I got good chance but I'm givin' it up for love

I gave it up
Givin' it up to love
I gave up everything
My everything gone

I gave it up
Yes, I'm givin' it up to love
I gave up everything

What would you do, do for love?
Wounded in cruel sacrifices and blood
Darling don't stress, no, darling don't go
I'll be an angel as long as we keep on singin' this song

I could have been an architect
I could have been a doctor
Been a good police detective
Looking for a robber

Through solo Shanghai
I'm born to make Lee a loner
Could've put up a real good fight
I got good chance but I'm givin' it up for love

I could have been an astronaut
Or a half-past lawyer
Or an [Incomprehensible]
Just find [Incomprehensible]

They wrote in the [Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible]
Could've put up a real good fight
I got good chance but I'm givin' it up for love

I gave it up
Givin' it up to love
I gave up everything
My everything gone

I gave it up
Yes, givin' it up to love
I gave up everything

What you'd do for love, love?
Would you give it up?
What you'd do for love, love?
Would you give it up?

Baby, I'm in love with you
What am I supposed to do
Anything that I can do
Givin' all my love to you
Baby, I'm in love with you
Anyone will see that I'm gone

Baby, I'm in love with you
What am I supposed to do
Anything that I can do
Givin' all my love to you
Baby, I'm in love with you
Anyone will see that I'm gone

Baby, I'm in love with you
What am I supposed to do
Anything that I can do
Givin' all my love to you
Baby, I'm in love with you
Anyone will see that I'm gone
