		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  from the tips of my toes
to the top of me
from the no need for clothes
to this is all free

you can stay all night
or leave if you please
just take your time
to take your time with me

lets just have some fun
just take your time

oops, there she goes
donâ€™t mind if i do
al little taste for me
a little more for you

from the tips of my toes
to the top of me
from the no need for clothes
to this is all free

lets just have some fun
just take your time
