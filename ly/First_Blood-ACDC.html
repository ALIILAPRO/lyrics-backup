		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got a screaming feeling, need a little loving healing
Want some of that stuff, cause I like a hot touch
Want to little squeezing, just a touch and teasing
Maybe wrong, maybe right, but I like it every night

Come on baby, down my way
Were gonna make it, night and day

I want first blood, a look in the eye
Thirst blood, a need in disguise
Bad dog come, back for more
First blood, first blood

Some like it hot, some like it not so hot
Cause I like a touch, and I want it so much
Come on baby, down my way
Were gonna make it every night and day

First blood, a look in the eye
Thirst blood, a need in disguise
Bad dog come back for more
First blood, first blood

I want first blood, a look in the eye
Thirst blood, a need in disguise
Bad dog come back for more
First blood, first blood

I want first blood, a look in the eye
Thirst blood, a need in disguise
Bad dog come back for more
First blood

You know I want a first blood
Some like it hot
First blood, all right hot shot
Bad dog, come back for more
I want first blood
