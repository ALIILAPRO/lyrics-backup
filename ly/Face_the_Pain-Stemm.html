		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time to end this suffering
I need a minute to my-self
So I can drift away
You will never get to me, what can be done I'll do myself
So I can slip away
Watch you rise, and watch you fall
Watch you losing control
Now I see the way
Watch you rise, and watch you fall
Now I'm about to break
Watch you rise, and watch you fall
Watch you loosing control(Crawl inside my head)
Watch you rise, and watch you fall
Now I'm about to break
Face the pain, no escape can you step to this
Face the pain, Face the pain, It's ripping me into pieces
Face the pain, no escape can you step to this
Face the pain, Face the pain, It's ripping me into pieces
Face this mirrior in front of me, I see the image of myself
So I can drift away
My thought runs deep, I've trained to meet
Our solders are advancing south
So I can slip away
Watch you rise, and watch you fall
Watch you losing control
Now I see the way
Watch you rise, and watch you fall
Now I'm about to break
Watch you rise, and watch you fall
Watch you losing it all
Crawl inside my head
Watch you rise, and watch you fall
Now I'm about to break
Face the pain, no escape can you step to this
Face the pain, Face the pain, It's ripping me into pieces
Face the pain, no escape can you step to this
Face the pain, Face the pain, It's ripping me into pieces
Watch you rise, and watch you fall
Watch you rise, and watch you fall
Watch you losing control
Watch you losing control
Watch you rise, and watch you fall
Now I'm about to break
Break
Now I'm about to break
Face the pain, no escape can you step to this
Face the pain, Face the pain, It's ripping me into pieces
Face the pain, no escape can you step to this
Face the pain, Face the pain, It's ripping me into pieces
Pain
In to pieces
Pain
In to pieces
