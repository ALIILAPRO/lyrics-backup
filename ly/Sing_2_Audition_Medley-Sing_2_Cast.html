		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some boys are trying too hard
He don't try at all through
Younger than my exes but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I'll take my time

Hi, my name is
What? My name is
Who? My name is 

Abra, abracadabra, abracadabra 

She bangs, she bangs
Oh baby, when she moves, she moves

What do you want from me?
Why do you run from me?
What are you wondering?
What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me?
Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

You used to call me on my cell phone 
Late night when you need my love

Talk to me baby
I'm goin' blind from this sweet-sweet cravin', whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean (uh)
Walk for me, baby
I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean (uh)
