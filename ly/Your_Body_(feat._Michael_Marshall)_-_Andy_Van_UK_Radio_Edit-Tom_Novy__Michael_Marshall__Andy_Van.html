		  Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoaaah! 
Somethin' 'bout your body 
Yeah-hey 

I don't want nobody 
I don't want nobody baby, but you 
Somethin' 'bout your body 
Has got me thinkin' of nobody, but you 

I don't want nobody 
I don't want nobody baby, but you 
Somethin' 'bout your body 
Has got me thinkin' of nobody, but you 

I don't want nobody 
I don't want nobody baby, but you 
I don't want nobody 
I don't want nobody baby, but you 

Somethin' 'bout your body 
Has got me thinkin' of nobody, but you

Somethin' 'bout your body baby 
You're drivin' me crazy 
Uh!
