		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I had another nightmare
Go back to sleep honey, everything will be alright in the end

All the girls love
It's so simple
Look, black is dead, guitars are dead
Category astronaut

Ain't got nobody

Ain't got nobody
Ain't got nobody
Ain't got no one to really love me

Ain't got nobody
Ain't got nobody
Ain't got no one to kiss and hug me

I've been so patient
All around the nation
There ain't no one in all creation

I'm livin' all alone
Nobody at home
It's hard to fall asleep
I really start to freak

My daddy loves me
No one could touch me
'Till he went up and left me lonely
That's human nature
We fail each other
And keep on searching for another

I thought I had a friend
But she was just pretend
She didn't have a soul
Nothing I could hold

Ain't got nobody
Ain't got nobody
Ain't got no one to really love me

Someone I can greet
When I come home from work
Someone who would smile
And take away the hurt

Ain't got nobody (Ain't got nobody)
Ain't got nobody (Ain't got nobody)
Could you be the one to really love me?

Ain't got nobody
Ain't got nobody
Ain't got no one to kiss and hug me

Tutututututu
Tutututututu
Tutututututu
