		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Brr
Brr
Ayo

Ayo, controller of the exits
The ark keeps stormin' got a Mac on both sides
My shot keep pouring
Hold your head up all time 'cause time keep going
The flyest nigga of all time, and y'all know it
If God shy, we all shy, life's euphoric
Bust a brick out the bag of raw, I can stove it
Saint Joseph with red tops in front of Rose's
Had a four and the jit, turnt the nine and called it culture
Pot pioneers had to suplex the soda
They raided the duplex, they missed us by a quota
Let the Mac off out the Trackhawk, doing doughnuts
Cold shoulder, let the niggas all know
You better know us, yeah
You better know us, yeah
You better know us, four pound on your forehead
Your mind off your shoulders
We the greatest, beef like eating greens
Kill 'em on the wake up
They popped the cells, Lord, love your neighbor
Put you out your misery
The only box I'ma be in is six deep
Been in school too long, I wanna deal a key (I wanna deal a key)
I wanna feed all the fam, I want my mans to eat (I want my mans to eat)
I got some niggas that I miss but we ain't never speak
My nigga praying for parole (Uh huh), let my nigga free (Uh huh)
Let my nigga free

If Allah shine, Kutter gon' shine, it's mathematical
Peace God, keep your head up on your sabbatical
Jay Elect, Griselda, done finally entered the chat
With that "skrrt, do-do-do-do" all over the tracks
Spitting actual facts soon as the originator was Black
From Buffalo to Tupelo we tryna break from the trap
You should read theology of time as your days blow by
It'll be like Yoda with Luke in the Dagobah
The truth is coming like Butcher, nigga, that's word to Jigga
I pray you skate through your bid like eights, see how I figure?
The flow is icy icy, nary a one as nicey
It's the goat herder, you writing for ghosts? Bitch, I might be
It's just me, the machine, Westside, Hermes for Hitler, Jay-dolf Spitler
Burning niggas live with the scripture
Like Gang Starr and Freddie Fox told you, it's the militia
I spit it for that Mac, that mouth, that Calliope and that fisher
You should hang this thousand word verse in your cell like a picture
Remember Kutter, you a god, no demi, no Ashton Kutcher
My god, my god, without Bruce Almighty or Bruce Willis, we die hard
Allah sent you here to be king like Flygod
