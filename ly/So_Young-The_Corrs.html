		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

We are taking it easy 
And bright and breezy, yeah
We are living it up 
Just fine and dandy, yeah

And it really doesn't matter that we don't eat 
And it really doesn't matter if we never sleep
It really doesn't matter, it really doesn't matter at all 

'Cause we are so young now 
We are so young, so young now 
And when tomorrow comes 
We can do it all again 

We are chasing the moon 
Just running wild and free 
We are following through 
Every dream, and every need 

And it really doesn't matter if we don't eat 
And it really doesn't matter if we never sleep
No, it really doesn't matter, it really doesn't matter at all 

'Cause we are so young now
We are so young, so young now 
And when tomorrow comes 
We can do it all again 

Yeah we are so young now
We are so young, so young now 
And when tomorrow comes 
We'll just do it all again
All again
All again
Yeah
All again
All again, yeah yeah yeah

So young now
We are so young, so young now 
And when tomorrow comes 
We'll just do it all again

Yeah we are so young now
We are so young, so young now 
And when tomorrow comes 
We'll just do it all again

We are so young, yeah
We are so young, yeah
We are so young
