		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All of my friends are the reason I'm only
On for the weekend when it's not so lonely
Most Friday nights end up looking this way

Wake up so high, now I'm drunk on the feeling
Boredom comes next and I stare at the ceiling
Most Monday nights end up looking this way
End up looking this way

Come on sugar, don't you leave early
I'm tired of counting myself back to sleep

Baby, we don't need no money
No worries tonight
Start a party in the living room
Turn it up until we feel it boom
Baby, let's get fucking crazy and lose track of time
Why we always got to fret about it?
There's nothing to regret about it
There's nothing to regret about it
There's nothing to regret about it

My friends are the reason that I'm never sober
Young and I'm broke and I live on a sofa
When it gets hard, yeah we get drunk again

We get wild, we let down
Yeah we're foolish and scared
We run and we jump when we feel unprepared
But I got your back if you make a mistake, if you make a mistake

Come on sugar, don't you leave early
I'm tired of counting myself back to sleep

Baby, we don't need no money
No worries tonight
Start a party in the living room
Turn it up until we feel it boom
Baby, let's get fucking crazy and lose track of time
Why we always got to fret about it?
There's nothing to regret about it
There's nothing to regret about it
There's nothing to regret about it 
(There's nothing to regret about it)

Come on sugar, don't you leave early (there's nothing to regret about it)
I'm tired of counting myself back to sleep

Baby, we don't need no money
No worries tonight
Start a party in the living room
Turn it up until we feel it boom
Baby, let's get fucking crazy and lose track of time
Why we always got to fret about it?
There's nothing to regret about it
There's nothing to regret about it
There's nothing to regret about it
There's nothing to regret about it
There's nothing to regret about it
