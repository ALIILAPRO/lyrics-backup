		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We fought the fiends and we overcame
Then we lost each other and we lost our way
It’s hard to breathe, and alone I’m fading
I need you now, to save me somehow

Can you see my signal rising to the sky
In the night, the ghouls and ghosts rush in to fight
I need you by my side
The flame in my eyes
Is burning low
Can you save me before I go

Can you save me before I go
(Now listen!)
(Gotta go back)
(Now settle down!)
(Make yourself, body and style)
Can you save me before I go
(Now listen!)
(Gotta go back)
Can you save me before I go

We crossed our hearts and we hoped to die
We scared the wraiths with our battle cry
But now you’re gone, how can I survive
I need you now, to save me somehow

Can you see my signal rising to the sky
In the night, the ghouls and ghosts rush in to fight
I need you by my side
The flame in my eyes
Is burning low
Can you save me before I go

Can you save me before I go
(Now listen!)
(Gotta go back)
(Now settle down!)
(Make yourself, body and style)
Can you save me before I go
(Now listen!)
(Gotta go back)
Can you save me before I go

Can you see my signal rising to the sky
In the night, the ghouls and ghosts rush in to fight
I feel the cold and darkness
Creeping up inside
I need you now
My flame is burning out
