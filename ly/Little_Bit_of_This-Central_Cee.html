		  Little bit of that
Come alive at night
And let's see how you shake that back
Vibrate, let's see how you make that
Little bit of this, little bit of that
(You are now listening to Young Chencs)

Little bit of this, little bit of that (little bit of that)
Come alive at night and let's see how you shake that back
Vibrate, let's see how you make that clap
Little bit of this, little bit of that (little bit of that)
Come alive at night and let's see how you shake that back
Vibrate, let's see how you make that clap

No-no doubt in my mind that my time will come
All I done was stick to the grind
Bro bro, got the darg parked off
It's willing to bark if it gets out of line, am I lying?
She wanna complain all the time, goodbye
Deleted that bitch off my line
I'm on my job, I'm occupied
But I do a bit of this on the side

Little bit of this, little bit of that (little bit of that)
Come alive at night and let's see how you shake that back
Vibrate, let's see how you make that clap
Little bit of this, little bit of that (little bit of that)
Come alive at night and let's see how you shake that back
Vibrate, let's see how you make that clap

Shake that back like a video vixen
Back out the rod like, let's go fishing
Oh, that's your, oh that's your missus?
Send her a cab and make her go missin'
She wanna spend a day in a life with me and my guy
Bring friend for a friend
Short and sweet, she's five foot five 
With the curly hair, she a ten out of ten
The way that it's clapping, I'm fascinated
Matter of fact, I'm infatuated
Bend her back, she elasticated
Kill the pum pum, assassinate it
Hmm, I'm activated
You-you-you got the vibe just right 
Come alive at night, I'm on demon time
She don't trust man, I got no reason to lie

Little bit of this, little bit of that (little bit of that)
Come alive at night and let's see how you shake that back
Vibrate, let's see how you make that clap
Little bit of this, little bit of that (little bit of that)
Come alive at night and let's see how you shake that back
Vibrate, let's see how you make that clap

The way that it's clapping, I'm fascinated
Matter of fact, I'm infatuated
Bend her back, she elasticated
Kill the pum pum, assassinate it
Hmm, I'm activated
You got the vibe just right 
Come alive at night, I'm on demon time
She don't trust man, I got no reason to lie

Four bad, four bad B's in the ride
Gotta squeeze them, it's a wee bit tight
Most these females the deceiving type
Take the P's and then go leave them guys
What you doing in the AM?
You only ever holla in the evening time
I'm here for a good time 
Not a long time, can you keep it quiet?

She wanna spend a day in a life with me and my guy
Bring friend for a friend
Short and sweet, she's five foot five 
With the curly hair, she a ten out of ten

Little bit of this, little bit of that (little bit of that)
Come alive at night and let's see how you shake that back
Vibrate, let's see how you make that clap
Little bit of this, little bit of that (little bit of that)
Come alive at night and let's see how you shake that back
Vibrate, let's see how you make that clap

Come alive at night
Little bit of this, little bit of that
