		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You really like my limousine
You like the way the wheels roll
You like my seven inch leather heels
And goin' to all of the shows, but

Do you love me, do you love me
really love me
You like the credit cards and private planes
Money can really take you far
You like the hotels and fancy clothes
And the sound of electric guitars, but

Do you love me, do you love me
Do you love me, I mean like do you
Really love me

You really like rock 'n' roll
All of the fame and the masquerade
You like the concerts and studios
And all the money, honey, that I make, but

Do you love me, do you love me
Do you love me, really love me

Your backstage pass and black sunglasses
Make you look just like a queen
Even the fans, they know your face
From all of the magazines, but

Do you love me (do you love me)
Do you love me (do you love me)
Do you love me (do you love me)
Really love me (really love me)
I want to know
Do you love me (do you love me)
Do you love me (do you love me)
Do you love me (do you love me)
I mean like do you
Really love me (really love me)
I want to know
Do you love me (do you love me)
Do you love me (do you love me)
Do you love me (do you love me)
I mean like do you
Really love me (really love me)
I want you to (do you love me, do you love me)
I need you to (do you love me, do you love me)
And you know I'm so tired of everybody sayin' it
And you know, (do you love me, do you love me)
I just gotta know if you really really really, really love me
(Do you love me, do you love me)
So come on, do you love me (do you love me)
I need you to
Do you love me (do you love me) I want you to
Do you love me (do you love me) I need you
Really love me (do you love me)
I want to know
Do you love me (do you love me) do you, do you
Do you love me (do you love me)
I just got to have some love (do you love me, do you love me)
I just got to have some love (do you love me)
I just got to have some love, love, love, love, love
