		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Weh di bloodclaat do yuh?
Siddung, siddung
Turn it up, Ah-ah
A-a-ayy, Pulse, this shit slaps
Pu-pu-pull up dat boy, wheel up, wheel
Ayy, what you-
Ayy (Ready)

Ridin' high all the time
Look down, see cloud nine level
Tellin' niggas for the last time
I'm way too up to be restful
Treat this life like a past life
It's light work, not stressful
Niggas mad 'cause my flow gets tighter
Cuz I'm steady practicin' my specials
Had√¥ken!
I should squash all of you bugs, my solution
Can't even share what I'm on, how I'm movin'
Shishi Sonson
You're in two bitch
Shishi Sonson
These niggas can't bully man, aim for the throat
Make you trend on Insta, fucking with the goat
Left that set back do this shit alone
See, men cap, women cap, but numbers cap the most

Real talk
My cyaa do the most that's real talk
DXXMLIFE always sold out, real talk
You ain't know, now you know that it's real talk

Yeah, lately I've been speaking to myself
I am not somebody you can mention
Keep that fuckin' drama to yourself
I don't ever give it the attention
Boss nigga but the flow's made in hell
Oh, don't start with the questions
Never really cared about the sales
I'm so used to rejection, oh

Show face then dip
Mask on real shit
Y'all make me sick
Hoodie on, eyes low
I ain't doin' no pics
Had to get it how I live
DXXMLIFE at the crib

Don't make me do it, don't make me do it
Uh
Stop asking me
Fuck! You make me sick

Ahhh!
Don't start with, don't start with the questions
Don't start with, oh, don't start with the questions
Don't start with, don't start with the questions
Don't start with, oh, don't start with the questions
Pussy, Ayy
Right, haha
