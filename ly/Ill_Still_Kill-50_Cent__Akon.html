		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothin' changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I don't want to, nigga, but I will if I got to kill
If niggas get to fuckin' around (yeah)
If niggas get to fuckin' around

Respect come from admiration and fear
You can admire me or you can catch one in your wig
You see the Testarossa, the toaster's right on my lap
So if a nigga get out of line then nigga get clapped
I got an arsenal, an infantry, I'm built for this mentally
That's why I'm the general, I do what they pretend to do
Front on me now, nigga, I'll be the end of you
Forget your enemies and think of what your friends'll do
I drop a bag off, then let a mag off
The Heckler & Koch'll tear half of your ass off
I'm not for the games, I'm not for all the playin'
The hollow tips rain when I unleash the pain
Get the message from the lions or get the message from the nine
Paint a picture with words, you can see when I shine
Put my back on the wall, nigga, watch me go for mine
I let twenty-one shots off at the same time, yeah

Oh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothin' changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I don't want to, nigga, but I will if I got to kill
If niggas get to fuckin' around (yeah)
If niggas get to fuckin' around

Where I'm from death is always in the air, homie
Nana love me so you know she say my prayers for me
I come creepin' through the the hood wearin' Teflon
Hit the corners, motherfuckers get left on
Niggas know, if not, they better check my background
Try and stick me I'll fill your back with MAC rounds
Ask Preme, nigga, 50 don't back down
I keep it funky like fiends in a crack house
Cross the line, boy, I'ma air your ass out
Screw your face at me I wan' know what that's 'bout
Nigga, I know you ain't mad I done came up
And if you are, fuck you 'cause I ain't change up
The OG's wanna talk, but I don't know these niggas
And I ain't did no business with 'em, I don't owe these niggas
A minute of my time, I get it 'cause I grind
All across the globe like the world's mine, yeah

Oh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothin' changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I don't want to, nigga, but I will if I got to kill
If niggas get to fuckin' around
If niggas get to fuckin' around

Konvict
Now tell me have you ever looked off in the distance
And seen a MAC aimin' at your head, man?
Before you know it, life is flashin', reminiscin'
And your body is drippin' and full of lead, man
I done been there, I done copped that
It ain't never been a question, I'm 'bout that
Don't go there, you'll get clapped at
And if you plan to fuck around and re-route that
You'll never catch me ridin' around on these streets
Without a couple metal pieces under my feet
Fully automatic weapons and loaded with dundees
Stashed up under the carpet like a can of Sea Breeze
50, don't make me ride on these niggas
'Cause I will kill, dip and hide on these niggas
50, don't make me ride on these niggas
'Cause I'll be long gone like the Ripper, so

Don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothin' changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I don't want to, nigga, but I will if I got to kill
If niggas get to fuckin' around
If niggas get to fuckin' around
