		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't wanna be forward
Don't wanna cross a line
But if I were to crash in this plane tonight
I'd want you to know this

Don't wanna say too much
Intrude on your space
But if I were to crash and I never made it home
I'd want you to know this

Oh, and to tell you is too scary
So I'll just say something else
And I wish that you could hear me
When I talk to myself
But this plane might not land safely
So what the hell do I have to lose?
If I just tell you

I wanna eat pancakes for dinner
I wanna get stuck in your head
I wanna watch a TV show together
And when we're under the weather we can watch it in bed
I wanna go out on the weekends
I wanna dress up just to get undressed
I think that I should probably tell you this in case there is an accident
And I never see you again
So please save all your questions for the end
And maybe I'll be brave enough by then

Don't wanna say something wrong
Don't wanna be weird
But if you're still in love with her, I think that I'll leave it there
And I won't ever tell you this

Oh, 'cause to tell you is too scary
So I'll just say something else
Like how was fall semester?
And what was that song about?
I'll try to hide the way I feel
But I just wanna shout
What do I have to lose right now?

I wanna eat pancakes for dinner
I wanna get stuck in your head
I wanna watch a TV show together
And when we're under the weather we can watch it in bed
I wanna go out on the weekends
I wanna dress up just to get undressed
I think that I should probably tell you this in case there is an accident
And I never see you again
So please save all your questions for the end
And maybe I'll be brave enough by then

Or maybe I won't ever say what's in my head
No, I won't have to say anything
You'll say it instead
