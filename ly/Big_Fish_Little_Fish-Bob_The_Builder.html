		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now gather round and hear me out,
This dance will make you sing and shout.
Don't get all tied up in knots,
Just get a fish and a cardboard box.

OK, now were gonna teach you how to really dance!
This is part one: Big fish, little fish

1234!
Big fish
Big fish
Big fish
Cardboard box!

Big fish, little fish
Big fish, little fish
Big fish, little fish
Cardboard box!

Big fish, little fish, cardboard box
Big fish, little fish, cardboard box
Big fish, little fish, cardboard box
We're all having fun!

When you find two halves don't make a whole,
Get a big machine with a lot of soul.
Scoop it out, that's the ticket!
Be like muck an' dig dig dig it!

This is part two!
You've got to scoop it out an' dig dig dig it!
Can ya dig it?

1234!
Scoop it out
Scoop it out
Scoop it out
Cardboard box!

Scoop it out, dig dig dig it
Scoop it out, dig dig dig it
Scoop it out, dig dig dig it
Cardboard box!

Big fish, little fish
Big fish, little fish
Big fish, little fish

Big fish, little fish, cardboard box
Big fish, little fish, cardboard box
Big fish, little fish, cardboard box
We're all havin fun!

Now anyone can join our crew,
Get your cake and eat it too!
Lift that hammer, big or small, and bang that nail into the wall!

OK this is the last bit now!
You've got to bang that nail into the wall.

1234!
Nail in the wall
Nail in the wall
Nail in the wall
Cardboard box!

Nail in the wall, bish bash bosh it
Nail in the wall, bish bash bosh it
Nail in the wall, bish bash bosh it
Cardboard box!

Scoop it out
Scoop it out
Scoop it out
Cardboard box!

Scoop it out, dig dig dig it
Scoop it out, dig dig dig it
Scoop it out, dig dig dig it
Cardboard box!

Big fish, little fish, cardboard box
Big fish, little fish, cardboard box
Big fish, little fish, cardboard box
We're all having fun!

Right,
Now we've shown you how to do it, we wanna see how good you are!
Let's put it all together!

1234!
Nail in the wall, bish bash bosh it
Nail in the wall, bish bash bosh it
Nail in the wall, bish bash bosh it
Cardboard box!

Scoop it out, dig dig dig it
