		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's the deal with my brain?
Why am I so obviously insane?
In a perfect situation
I let love down the drain
There's the pitch, slow and straight
All I have to do is swing and I'm a hero
But I'm a zero

Hungry nights, once again
Now it's getting unbelievable
'Cause I could not have it better
But I just can't get no play
From the girls, all around
As they search the night for someone to hold onto
I just pass through

Singing oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Singing oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Get your hands off the girl
Can't you see that she belongs to me?
And I don't appreciate this excess company
Though I can't satisfy
All the needs she has and so she starts to wander
Can you blame her?

Singing oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Singing oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Tell me there's a logic out there
Leading me to better prepare
For the day that something really special might come

Tell me there's some hope for me
I don't wanna be lonely
For the rest of my days on the earth, oh!

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Singing oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Singing oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
