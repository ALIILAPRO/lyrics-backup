		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She don't know who she is
Oh, I can take her anywhere
Do whatever comes naturally to you
You know she just don't care
You know she just don't care

'Cause I am always where I need to be
And I always thought 
I would end up with you, eventually
Do, do-do-do-do-do, do
Do, do-do-do-do-do, do
Do, do-do-do-do-do, do

Now I see her again
I ask to be her hummingbird
Whisper words in her ear
Oh, now you know I just don't care

Because I am always where
I need to be
And I always thought
I would end up with you, eventually
Do, do-do-do-do-do, do
Do, do-do-do-do-do, do
Do, do-do-do-do-do

I'm a man, I'm a man, oh 
Oh, I'm a man on the scene
I'm a man, and I can be so obscene
Because I always think that I know how to be
But I always thought 
I would end up with you, eventually
Do, do-do-do-do-do, do
Do, do-do-do-do-do, do
Do, do-do-do-do-do

Said
Oh, I'm a man, I'm a man, oh 
Oh, I'm a man on the scene
I'm a man, I'm a man 
I can be so obscene
