		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't see those things that move there
Thinking it wasn't living her
I didn't choose to stick around
Enough to know what it's about
There's all these worlds we want to see
Carry me out from underneath
The rules are different when you're done
Finding the room where we are one

Out here
But we're in a race 
Is that all?
In a certain place
Here we are
And we come alive
I reflect, here what's in front of you

I mean to hide
We can try to find
Who we are
We can leave behind
Owners, everybody house proud

Living underground
Living underground
Living underground
Living underground

Trying to find my way home
Below, I'm running on my way
Hurry before they catch a trace
Until we find somewhere that's safe
Our light shows what's in front of you
Trying to find my way to you
Waiting here, on the dial tone
Alright, if you can be alone

Out here
Then we come alive
Is that all?
It's a different time
In my heart
Then we try to play
I reflect, here what's in front of you

Then we go
Down the bowels of our
Here we are
We do what we're told
Owners, everybody house proud

Living underground
They're living underground
Living underground
Living underground
Living underground
Living underground
Living underground
Living underground
