		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I'ma do it
Just myself and the sea
I think I'ma do it
Need no one
I think I'ma do it
Just myself and the sea
I think I'ma do it
Need no one

Why you believe in something
If it brought skeletons
You was made to win
You was optimist
Now it feels like you're done
They envy where you sittin'
Shit ain't sweet, shit is rough
Back to back it's the same old fight
They gon' eat you live 'til you front

I will fight the vision
But the vision is so clear
Feeding my soul with my sins
I'm choosing my life for the ending

I think I'ma do it
Just myself and the sea
I think I'ma do it
Need no one
I think I'ma do it
Just myself and the sea
I think I'ma do it
Need no one

I wish sometimes I'd be dumb
I wish I walked more than run
And if I'm meant to be numb
At least I did what they can't
She feed me good, she my sun
She know I ain't a bad man
When everybody had a condescending picture of my psyche
It's all love and she knew it first
Bad man, bad man
Don't forgive me when I'm dead and gone
That's fine, that's fine
It ain't your fault, nah
It's mine, it's mine

I will fight the vision
But the vision is so clear
Feeding my soul with my sins
I'm choosing my life for the ending

I think I'ma do it
Just myself and the sea
I think I'ma do it
Need no one
I think I'ma do it
Just myself and the sea
I think I'ma do it
Need no one

If I ever leave pretend I didn't
I'm still living, breathing in your eardrum
I'm just waiting for you in the next room
Baba don't cry
I know you're more than strong
Don't ever change your tone
When you talk 'bout your son I love you so much
I'm so sorry

(Need no one
I think I'ma do it
Just myself and the sea
I think I'ma do it
Need no one)

I think I'ma do it
Just myself and the sea
I think I'ma do it
Need no one
I think I'ma do it
Just myself and the sea
I think I'ma do it
Need no one
