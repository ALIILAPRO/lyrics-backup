		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Late last nite I was dreamin'
I was dreamin' of your charms
And I was standin' on the edge of love baby
With you in my arms

Well you whispered sweet things and you told me
You told me that you'd love me
And you'd always be true
And that you'd stand on the edge of love with me
I'll stand with you

That's why I'm standin' on the edge of love
And I'm just about to slip and fall
That's why I'm standin' on the edge of love baby
Waitin' on your call

Well a young man's mind will wonder
And wander off to distant shores
And if you'd just come here and stand with me
I won't wander no more

Well I promise that I'll stop all of my gamblin'
Stop stayin' out late all nite
Might even settle down baby
Treat ourselves right

That's why I'm standin' on the edge of love
And I'm just about to slip and fall
That's why I'm standin' on the edge of love baby
Waitin' on your call

That's why I'm standin' on the edge of love
And I'm just about to slip and fall
That's why I'm standin' on the edge of love baby
Waitin' on your call

That's why I'm standin' on the edge of love
And I'm just about to lose my mind
That's why I'm standin' on the edge of love baby
Waitin' on you one more time
