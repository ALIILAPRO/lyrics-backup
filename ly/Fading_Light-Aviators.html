		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Life's breath in the Candle light
Lost Hearts in the dead of night
It's a long way down
To the place they found

Dark sun hollowed by the fate
Our debt they left to be paid
See the blackness stare promising to spare
The chosen

Born of graves and left below
Painted ashes, painted snow
When the Dark awakens
Fires of our last hope are getting low

Souls of gods and Souls of Men
Meet in Cinders to ascend fate has chosen
And our Fading Light is at it's end

I've a tale that time has lost
Scenes of judgement, born in frost
Then he took a name for the one profaned

Know the dark and let it rest
Left to lurkers in their quest
Let the watchers fight let the Blood ignite
The chosen

Born of graves and left below
Painted ashes, painted snow
When the Dark awakens
Fires of our last hope are getting low
Souls of gods and Souls of Men
Meet in Cinders to ascend fate has chosen
And our Fading Light is at it's end

Souls to revive us or rot us away
Want for the weary and Death for the sane
Cursed yet we listen for bells left to toll
To fight back the depths of Humanity's soul

For the Unkindled we look to the sun
Cities in gold all the victories one
Fear not the dark nor the monsters my friend
And brace for the feast of Humanity's end

Born of graves and left below
Painted ashes, painted snow
When the Dark awakens
Fires of our last hope are getting low
Souls of gods and Souls of Men
Meet in Cinders to ascend fate has chosen
And our Fading Light is at it's end

Fading Light
