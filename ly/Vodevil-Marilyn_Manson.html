		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wake up everyday on 
The wrong side of the bed 
But I won't lay down on the floor 
Like I'm the whore in your head 
Call me a failure 
Pretender, sex-offender, infector 
Say I killed all my friends 
And I deserve to be dead. 

Kiss baby kiss 
Bang baby bang 
Suck baby suck 
It's Vodevil 
Kiss baby kiss 
Bang baby bang 
Suck baby suck 
It's Vodevil 

This isn't music and we're not a band 
We're 5 middle fingers on a motherfucking hand 
This isn't music and we're not a band 
We're 5 middle fingers on a motherfucking hand 

I won't pull out I just came 
I want all of the blame 
your love is tin, faith is thin 
No concept of pain, right to complain 
All you fagazines, senile teens 
Jaw me black ball me 
Deejay yourself away and turn your back 
It will be easier to stab 

Kiss baby kiss 
Bang baby bang 
Suck baby suck 
It's Vodevil 
Kiss baby kiss 
Bang baby bang 
Suck baby suck 
It's Vodevil 

This isn't music and we're not a band 
We're 5 middle fingers on a motherfucking hand 
This isn't music and we're not a band 
We're 5 middle fingers on a motherfucking hand 

VIP add TRD violent shiny hate crime 
"Total Requested Dead" it's 
Version point (less) downloadable suicide. 
The only ones left standing are the ones not demanding 
This isn't a show, this is my fucking life 
I'm not ashamed you're entertained 
But 
I'm not a puppet 
I am a grenade 
I'm not ashamed you're entertained 
But 
I'm not a puppet 
I am a grenade 

Kiss baby kiss 
Bang baby bang 
Suck baby suck 
It's Vodevil 
Kiss baby kiss 
Bang baby bang 
Suck baby suck 
It's Vodevil 

This isn't music and we're not a band 
We're 5 middle fingers on a motherfucking hand 
This isn't music and we're not a band 
We're 5 middle fingers on a motherfucking hand
