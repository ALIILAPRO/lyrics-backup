		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't wanna do it now
You don't wanna know the answer
I know you haven't been around
But you already know the answer

Without you I don't wanna talk
Without you I don't wanna sleep
Without you I don't wanna try
I don't wanna live

Baby no, no need to worry about tomorrow
You'll never know what tomorrow will bring
Baby I love, I'll be there for you whenever you call
You'll never walk, walk alone on the street
Baby no, no need to worry about tomorrow
You'll never know what tomorrow will bring
Baby I love, I'll be there for you whenever you call
You'll never walk, walk alone on the street

Don't worry about a thing
Girl I'm here by your side
I think you already know me
But you think that it is not enough

Without you I don't wanna talk
Without you I don't wanna sleep
Without you I don't wanna try
I don't wanna live

Baby no, no need to worry about tomorrow
You'll never know what tomorrow will bring (oh no)
Baby I love, I'll be there for you whenever you call
You'll never walk, walk alone on the street (whoa)
Baby no, no need to worry about tomorrow
You'll never know what tomorrow will bring
Baby I love, I'll be there for you whenever you call
You'll never walk, walk alone on the street

Don't worry about it baby
No need to worry about it baby
Baby you can be my little lady
So don't you worry about it baby
Don't worry about it baby
No need to worry about it baby
Baby you can be my little lady
Don't worry about it baby

Baby no, no need to worry about tomorrow
You'll never know what tomorrow will bring (oh no)
Baby I love, I'll be there for you whenever you call
You'll never walk, walk alone on the street
Baby no, no need to worry about tomorrow
You'll never know what tomorrow will bring
Baby I love, I'll be there for you whenever you call
You'll never walk, walk alone on the street
