		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never thought that you'd teach me to walk away
You said "I love you so much, baby, won't you stay?"
So it goes, goes, goes, so it always goes
So it goes, goes, goes, so it always goes

I went down to the river to wash away the things I've done
And all the names I've traced into my skin since you've been gone
And his hands, they feel just like yours against my arm
But his voice, it sounds nothing like yours when you're telling me I'm wrong

I sleep in agony, I sleep alone
Your hangman hands have got me cold
Guess you don't know, no, no, guess you'll never know
Now you don't know, no, no, now you'll never know

So I went back to the devil and told him everything I know
Let him drink my blood and feed me wine in the TV glow
And his hands they feel just like yours against my throat
But his voice it sounds nothing like yours when you're begging me to come home

I went down to the river to wash away the things I've done
And all the names I've traced into my skin since you've been gone
