		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me see now
I might be wrong
But so what?
I don't really need what others feel
It changes actually
When I turn around

Like wake up to the light
My awareness came back to my side
So many, too many things going on
Only outside of my world

There is nothing to say
Everything is falling into the best part
There is nothing more to say now

Like sun goes through the dark
Suddenly you appeared in my life
So many, too many things going on
Sometimes I would better doubt my eyes

But there's nothing to say
Everything is falling into the best part
There is nothing more to say now

If life were a made-up story
Why don't we act like a star?
'Cause no, nobody can get
The best of you, the best of me
The best of you, the best of me
The best of you, the best of me

I'm still on my way
And I don't really need what others feel
Laugh it off even when life gets tough and hard
I'm trying to be true to myself
