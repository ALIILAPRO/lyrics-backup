		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just for the record let's get the story straight
Me and Uncle Tom were fishin' it was gettin' pretty late
Out on a cypress limb above the wishin' well
Where they say it got no bottom say it take you down to Hell

Over in the bushes and off to the right
Two men talking in the pale moonlight
Sherriff John Brady and Deputy Hedge
Haulin' two limp bodies down to the Waters' Edge

I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's Cabin oh yea
I know a secret that I just can't tell

They didn't see me and Tom in the tree
Neither one believin' what the other could see
Tossed in the bodies let em sink on down
To the bottom of the well where they'd never be found

I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's Cabin oh yea
I know a secret that I just can't tell
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's Cabin
I know a secret that I just can't tell
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's Cabin
I know who put the bodies in the wishing well

Soon as they were gone me and Tom got down
Prayin real hard that we wouldn't make a sound
Runnin through the woods back to Uncle Tom's shack
Where the full moon shines through the rooftop cracks

Oh my God, Tom, who are we going to tell?
The Sherriff, he belongs in a prison cell
Keep your mouth shut, that's what we're going to do
Unless you want to wind up in the wishing well too

I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's Cabin
I know a secret that I just can't tell
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's Cabin
I know a secret that I just can't tell
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's Cabin
Know who put the bodies, know who put the bodies
In the wishin well
Oh yea
