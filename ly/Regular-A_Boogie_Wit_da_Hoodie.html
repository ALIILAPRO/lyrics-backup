		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Mother- spaceship)

Tryna see if the pussy was tight enough
I could fuck on a bitch without likin' her
So much Balmain, I feel like a biker, huh
Got a puck on my chain, I'm a Mighty Duck
And I used to not think I was good enough
And then I started gettin' my money up
I'm countin' up on the regular
Now they callin' my phone like it's regular
All day, on the regular
Balmain like it's regular
I made you look regular
Look at you, look at you, regular
Oh (regular)
Oh (regular)
Oh (regular)
Oh (regular)

I hit from the back if it's wet enough
I hit it again while she dressin' up
I want you to eat me, etcetera
I want a threesome, so set it up
You was poppin' them Percs on a regular
You was poppin' them Percs when I met you, huh?
I was smokin' a lot, I admitted it
Only thing in my pocket, a MetroCard
Don't talk about it, I get it in
Dick in her mouth, she gon' fit it in
VVS', they be glitterin'
They don't like me, but they listenin' (on God)
If I buy her the symphony, she gon' ride like a Bentley then
And she only like the boss type, she is not into middlemen
When I was nineteen, I stopped doin' 9 to 5s, I swear, nigga
Now I'm only twenty-six, pimpin' out rides like I'm Xzibit, yeah
Double E sign on the side of my hat, I only hang with millionaires
And I don't wanna get in my feelings, yeah
DTB, I know bitches be trippin', yeah

Tryna see if the pussy was tight enough
I could fuck on a bitch without likin' her
So much Balmain, I feel like a biker, huh
Got a puck on my chain, I'm a Mighty Duck
And I used to not think I was good enough
And then I started gettin' my money up

I'm countin' up on the regular
Now they callin' my phone like it's regular
All day in the regular
Balmain like it's regular
I made you look regular
Look at you, look at you, regular
Oh (regular)
Oh (regular)
Oh (regular)
Oh (regular)

Stars align, I want number one with the smoke on the sign up
I'm gettin' money, you know this already
But told her, "Meet me at the diner"
Remember I was down bad, wanted fly shit, couldn't get no designer
Now my circle is high-class, thinkin' 'bout smokin' a blunt with Madonna
My nigga, I'm hot as Hell
Need me some ice just to go with the Donny
My bitch havin' mood swings, but she be alright when I show her the money
Go up on a Monday like we ain't got nothin' to do in the mornin'
I'm flyer than ever, my nigga
My hoodie on like it was stormin' (huh?)

Tryna see if the pussy was tight enough
I could fuck on a bitch without likin' her
So much Balmain, I feel like a biker, huh
Got a puck on my chain, I'm a Mighty Duck
And I used to not think I was good enough
And then I started gettin' my money up

I'm countin' up on the regular
Now they callin' my phone like it's regular
All day in the regular
Balmain like it's regular
I made you look regular
Look at you, look at you, regular
Oh (regular)
Oh (regular)
Oh (regular)
Oh (regular)
