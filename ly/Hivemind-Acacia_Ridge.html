		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My heart is racing
My blood is heating up
I'm alternating back and forth
From almost to enough
I'm hesitating
Persisting all at once
Innovating desperation
Water in my lungs

We're on the precipice of life
Hold on, it's just beginning
Welcome to the hive
You're always welcome in the hive

My mind is aching
Burning in my eyes
Twist and tear the inhibitions
Used as my disguise
Don't be introspective
That's always the reply
I'd be okay with contention
If you would just try to see my side

We're on the precipice of life
Hold on, it's just beginning
Welcome to the hive
You're always welcome in the hive
You couldn't leave us if you tried
It's not that complicated
Welcome to the hive
You're always welcome in the hive

Leave me alone to my devices
My vices
Watch me
I'll leave all this behind me
Behind me
Behind me

We're on the precipice of life
Welcome to the hive
You couldn't leave us if you tried
Welcome to the hive
You're always welcome in the hive
