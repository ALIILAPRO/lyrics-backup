		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whoa, baby
Yeah

I stopped sending flowers to your apartment
You said you weren't around much anymore, yeah
I stopped dropping by without an appointment
‘Cause I heard laughter coming through your door

Sometimes late at night you still call me (Baby)
Before you close your eyes to sleep, yeah
I made a vow that I would drop by some times
But that's a promise I can't keep

‘Cause I love you too much to ever start likin' you
Let's leave the story here to end, no
I love you too much to ever start likin' you
So don't expect me to be your friend, no

You act so happy when I see you, girl
You smile and take my hand
Introduce me to your latest lover, yeah
That's when the world starts crashing in

‘Cause I love you too much to ever start likin' you
Let's leave the story here to end, yeah
I love you too much to ever start likin' you
So don't expect me to be your friend, no, no, no

Well
Oh, baby
Oh

I stopped sending flowers to your apartment
You said you weren't around much anymore, no
I stopped dropping by without an appointment
‘Cause I heard laughter from your door

Sometimes late at night you still call me
Just before you close your eyes to sleep, yeah
I made a vow that I would drop by some times
But baby, that's a promise I can't keep

‘Cause I love you too much to ever start likin' you
So let's leave the story here to end, yeah
‘Cause I love you too much to ever start likin' you
So don't expect me to be your friend, no

I love you too much to ever start likin' you
So leave the story here to end, no
I love you too much to ever start likin' you
