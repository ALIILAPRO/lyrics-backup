		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Within seconds you stole my attention
Skin so perfect, a golden complexion
More than beautiful girl, you're a work of art

Oh, my, I cannot believe my eyes
Oh, my, pinch me, am I dreamin', am I?
Oh, my, did you fall from the skies?

I can't see your wings, but girl, you're an angel
Oh, my, my angel
You're so out of this world, you're hiding your halo
Oh, oh, my angel
Oh, my, my angel
Won't you be mine? My angel
I can't see your wings, but girl, you're an angel
Oh, my angel

Atrapaste mi amor en segundos
Piel de oro y tus ojos profundos
Una obra maestra, a work of art

Oh, my, I cannot believe my eyes
Oh, my, tu cuerpo es un sue√±o, oh my
Oh, my, did you fall from the skies?

I can't see your wings, but girl, you're an angel
Oh, my, my angel
You're so out of this world, you're hiding your halo
Oh, oh, my angel
Oh, my, my angel
Won't you be mine? My angel
I can't see your wings, but girl, you're an angel
Oh, my angel
