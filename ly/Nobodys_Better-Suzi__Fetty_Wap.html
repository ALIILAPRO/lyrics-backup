		<p>
		  yeah
ohh
Zoovier! 
Yeah (Ayo Z talk to 'em!) 
Squaa!

I wanna know what's on your mind
Baby, can you tell me?
We are such a mystery, yeah
I see you liking all those pics
Flirtin' with that other chick, baby
And I can't take this no more

Baby, can you tell me how you feelin'?
I ain't feelin' the way I'm feelin' about you right now

Baby what you see is what you get
Talk to me, say what it is
Nobody's better by your side, baby
Baby what you see is what you get
Talk to me, say what it is
Nobody's better by your side, baby
Please don't take this lightly
I like you and you like me
Just don't believe the hype, baby
I got you and you got me
Please don't take this lightly
I like you and you like me
Just don't believe the hype, baby
I got you and you got me

Do you really wanna put it that way?
Is that all you have to say?
I gave all my love to you
And you're throwin' it all away
It was not too long ago, you were sayin'
"Baby won't you come my way?
Cannot, cannot keep you out my brain"
So I gotta know

Baby can you tell me how you feelin'?
I ain't feelin' the way I'm feelin' about you right now

Baby what you see is what you get
Talk to me, say what it is
Nobody's better by your side, baby
Baby what you see is what you get
Talk to me, say what it is
Nobody's better by your side, baby
Please don't take this lightly
I like you and you like me
Just don't believe the hype, baby
I got you and you got me
Please don't take this lightly
I like you and you like me
Just don't believe the hype, baby
I got you and you got me

See I really wish that I could believe
The words that you are sayin' to me, babe
I need a little bit more from you than that
I need a little bit of honesty
Let me know when you're ready to love me
Baby let me know when you're ready to love me (And only me, yeah)

Baby what you give is what you get
Talk to me, forget the rest
Nobody's better by your side than me
Baby what you give is what you get
Talk to me, forget the rest
Nobody's better by your side than me
Please don't take me lightly
I like you and you like me
I won't believe the hype, baby
If you treat me right (me right)
Please don't take me lightly
I like you and you like me
I won't believe the hype, baby
If you treat me right (me right)
