		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll talk but I know you won't listen to me
Oh you wouldn't say it but you wanted to
Don't look, don't walk away when I am speaking
I'll take it, but I know it's not for taking

The oneness of one of which you notice me
I told you, do not follow what you couldn't see
Oh, I love you, I love you
Some way, you will want it your way, sunrise
So I would not be mistaken what I know is right
Don't be so funny with me, I'm not laughing
Oh, I love you, I love you
