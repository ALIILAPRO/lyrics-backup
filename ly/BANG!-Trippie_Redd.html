		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Bang)

I can't do this anymore, trying not to be ignored
Put my pedal to the floor, I spread my wings I let them soar
Let them soar-oar, let them soar

I can't do this anymore, yeah
When it rains it really pours, yeah
Like an eagle I'ma soar, yeah
Desert eagle, let it roar, yeah
Let it bang, bang, let it bang, bang
Let it rang, sang, let it bang, gang
Baby, yes, you're mine, baby, yes, you're fine
When I'm on the road, do I cross your mind?
When I'm on the road, baby, yes, come ride, yeah
Let it bang for me, rang for me
She let that shit sang for me, yeah

She gon' let that shit bang for me, yeah
She gon' let that shit bang for me, yeah
She gon' let that shit bang for me, yeah
She gon' let that shit bang for me, yeah

Yeah, let it bang for me (bang) 
Yeah, let it bang for me (bang) 
Yeah, let it bang for me (bang) 
Yeah, let it bang for me (bang)

Baby, yes, you're mine, baby, yes, you're fine
When I'm on the road, do I cross your mind?
When I'm on the road, baby, yes, come ride, yeah
New Chanel walkers, when I walked up in the room, uh
Maison Margiela, when I walked up in the room, uh
Bunch of dope smokers, when I walked up in the room, uh
Iced-out Motorola, when I walked up in the room, uh
Woadie with my chopper, talkin' down and boy you're doomed (bang)
Used to want a 'Rari, now I'm rich, I bought a coupe (bang)
Now I'm switchin' lanes and I never keep a roof (bang)
You goin' out sad, all they do is laugh at you, uh
Yeah, I gotta get it for my mama and my sisters 
And my nephews and my nieces, love 'em all
Hope you niggas really ready for the fall
When it all comes down, who can you call?

I can't do this anymore, yeah
When it rains it really pours, yeah
Like an eagle I'ma soar, yeah
Desert eagle let it roar, yeah
Let it bang, bang, let it bang, bang
Let it rang, sang, let it bang, gang
Baby, yes, you're mine, baby yes you're fine
When I'm on the road, do I cross your mind?
When I'm on the road, baby, yes, come ride, yeah
Let it bang for me, rang for me
She let that shit sang for me, yeah

She gon' let that shit bang for me, yeah
She gon' let that shit bang for me, yeah
She gon' let that shit bang for me, yeah
She gon' let that shit bang for me, yeah

Yeah, let it bang for me (bang) 
Yeah, let it bang for me (bang) 
Yeah, let it bang for me (bang) 
Yeah, let it bang for me (bang)
