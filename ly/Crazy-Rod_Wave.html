		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ain't it fun? Ain't it fun?
Living in the real world
What works for you might not work for me
I dropped everythin', went and chased my dreams
They thought I was crazy
They thought I was crazy
You thought I was crazy
But I'm not, oh, I'm not (crazy)
Yeah, I'm not

Walk in inside the dealer, people look at me weird
Like I ain't 'posed to be here, probably the richest one here
I got too many cribs, I only stay for a year
And then it's back on the road, 'cross the globe doin' shows
'Cross the globe doin' shows, I live a rockstar life
Never did coke in my life but I put dope in my Sprite
Yeah, I put dope in my Sprite to ease my pain
So much came with this fame, but I just gain and maintain
I just gain and maintain, won't catch Noonie complainin'
I got this shit off the pavement, I walk to school while it's rainin'
Punchin' the clock feel like slavery
Can't believe that I made it
If you got dreams, young nigga, you better chase it

Ain't it fun? Ain't it fun?
Living in the real world
What works for you might not work for me
I dropped everythin', went and chased my dreams
They thought I was crazy
They thought I was crazy
You thought I was crazy
But I'm not, oh, I'm not (crazy)
Oh, I'm not
