		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Unable so lost,
I can't find my way,
Been searching, but I have never seen,
A turning, a turning from deceit.

'Cause the child roses like,
Try to reveal what I could feel,
I can't understand myself anymore,
'Cause I'm still feeling lonely,
Feeling so unholy.

'Cause the child roses like,
Try to reveal what I could feel,
And this loneliness,
It just won't leave me alone, oh no.

I'm fooling somebody,
A faithless path to roam,
Deceiving to breath this secretly,
A silence, this silence I can't bear.

'Cause a child roses light,
Try to reveal what I could feel,
And this loneliness,
It just won't leave me alone, oh no,
And this loneliness,
It just won't leave me alone.

A lady of war,
A lady of war.
