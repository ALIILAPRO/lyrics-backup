		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, Gucci ghost, she fill my ghost, I'ma get that mula (ghost, grra)
While my brother got loyalty, ain't gotta pay my shooter (whoa)
I was in the rack, all flashes, watch weight that I boo' up (cap)
Glowed up on a broke boy, just watch weight that you lose, yeah (gang)
Put a hole in a broke boy, so big look like a hoola (that me)
Now get money, tryna be my man's, look at him like who ya? (Savage)
No, you ain't really with the shits, I could just see right through ya (what?, Bitch)
No, no you can't hang with the gang, we ain't her junior (what?)
Yes, I'ma boss, I'ma floss, and too I bang drugs, I feel like Lupta (yeah)
Get in the club with a .40 on the moss, I swear my gun is too tough (gang)
I was just with you bitch, made her eat my two nuts (yeah)
All the opps mad 'cause we getting this guap, they can't believe we brew up (uh)
We don't know them (uh), but best believe they knew us (uh)
I was in the drop, man I'm off this cap, I had to pour up like two cups (yeah)
Had to get on a flight to Madagascar and these niggas still can't move us (bitch)
Let me hit 'em bro, I don't care if he sue us (bitch)

Nah you ain't even got to hit him bro, that's the reason I'm your shooter
Nigga I was really in the field, Deezer stay in the house so suit up (grrr)
Me and DooWop in LA, and we made a duet on a cougar (no cap)
Now I'm in the hills, just popping up pills, so I'm cooling like a cooler
Vvs diamonds, hit off the Raf Simons, man, shout out to my jeweler (opps)
Your love just got brain, now she smarter than a tutor (brain)
Her top gave me sane, I oblongata her medulla (brain)
But we don't chase hoes, all we chase is that mula (guap)
I'm still in the trap, and my boys sell packs, that's the way we still maneuver (money)
Clip long as a ruler, FN got a cooler (bih)
Tech nine it'll juke ya, been had chops bitch, this ain't new to us (ay, ay)
Nothing new, battle my choppa, shoot at her (ay)
We aim at your mind and you prolly could lose your life (ay, ay)
You niggas bitches, you really ain't shooting, nothing
I fucked on this bitch and I wetted her coochie up (what?)
You nigga's diamonds ain't doing no stupid stuff
Told a little goofy, just give all this goofy up
Hundred round clips, they talking no movie, huh
Your life is boring, that means that your movie sucks
We keep getting money, this shit ain't new to us
I got the drugs with the Boosie cut
Might just go shoot up your funeral
My niggas soldiers, they say you ain't losing us
Put some little money on his head (head)
We do the shooting, ain't no niggas shooting us
I had to pour up some red (red)
Pass her that rack and now bitches be choosing us (bitch, whoa, uh)
