		  Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

I'm pretty good with a hammer and a nail
I've been known to do it myself
There ain't much in this house that I can't fix
We been beat but it ain't broke yet
Got a few loose strings hangin' by a thread
Honey, I don't know how-much these hearts got left

Are we fixin' to break?
Are we fixin' to break?

Tell me somethin'
What's been on your mind?
Are you thinkin' 'bout runnin'?
'Cause I'm sittin' here losin' mine
And there ain't nothin'
You could say to me right now
To change the way I love you
But if it's up to you this time
Tell me what it is you're thinkin', shoot me straight
Are we fixin' to break?

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

Built this love up stone by stone
We both know we can't do it alone
We can build this house back up or we can break it down
Yeah, we can build this house back up or we can break it down

So tell me somethin'
What's been on your mind?
Are you thinkin' 'bout runnin'?
'Cause I'm sittin' here losin' mine
And there ain't nothin'
You could say to me right now
To change the way I love you
But if it's up to you this time
Tell me what it is you're thinkin', shoot me straight
Are we fixin' to break?
We fixin' to break?

We've been fightin' like hell and tellin' ourselves
Maybe we'd be better off with someone else

Are we fixin' to break?
Are we fixin' to break?
Are we fixin' to break?

Tell me somethin'
What's been on your mind?
Are you thinkin' 'bout runnin'?
'Cause I'm sittin' here losin' mine
And there ain't nothin'
You could say to me right now
To change the way I love you
But if it's up to you this time
Tell me what it is you're thinkin', shoot me straight
Yeah, I know that I might lose you, but either way
Are we fixin' to break?

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
