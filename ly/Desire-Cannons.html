		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm hooked on you, honey
Never letting you go
'Cause I got desire
It's starting to show
I'm holding you tightly
Bathing inside your glow
'Cause I got a fire
I feel it starting to grow

Here's the thing
I can't stop thinking about you
Can't stop thinking about you
Here, just thinking about you
'Til the stars burn blue

Call it sad, call it funny
I don't care to know
'Cause I got desire
And I can't let you go

Here's the thing
I can't stop thinking about you
Can't stop thinking about you
Here, just thinking about you
'Til the stars burn blue

Let me back in your head and your heart again
I've been thinking 'bout you, baby, tell me when
I get so carried away, lookin' in your eyes
You spark a fire, and I just can't deny

'Cause it's you I'm thinking of

Here's the thing
I can't stop thinking about you
Can't stop thinking about you
Here, just thinking about you
'Til the stars burn blue
