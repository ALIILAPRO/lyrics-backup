		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  007 and Brucey Wayne
Are shitting there 'selves because there's another name coming to claim
What is his to claim
10% faster with a sturdier frame

He's certainly come into his own
There's one on his arm in every land that he roams
And two consecutive nights alone
Are a thing of the past as he has recently shown

They said he looks so handsome stood not dancing
Drawing you in like it's boring to him
It's a war you can't win and the first and the last are two things you'll never
Be my darling

Another roll around and another push and shove
Further away from the idea of love
And his conclusion it must be good
Oh wouldn't the penny would drop with an incredible thud
They forgot to kick the tin, he knows where she's going
But don't know where she's been
And as opposed to the other thing
He'll worry about it when it's trouble he's in

They said he looks so handsome stood not dancing
Drawing you in like it's boring to him
It's a war you can't win and the first and the last are two
Things you'll never be my darling

Things you'll never be my darling

(Two things you will never be my darling)

(Two things you'll never be my darling)

Well they sneered and sniffed and spat at my chat up lines
Not to feel like a twat at times is hard
(But not for this kid, not when they come to you)
