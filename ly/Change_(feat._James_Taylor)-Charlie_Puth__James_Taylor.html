		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, three, four

Why are we looking down
On our sisters and brothers?
Isn't love, all that we got?
Don't we know everyone's
Got a father and mother?
The day we know we're all the same
Together we can make that change

Look around there are too many of us crying
And not enough love to go around
What a waste, another day
Another good one dying
But I know that the world will change
The day we know we're all the same

Why can't we just get along?
If loving one another's wrong
Then how are we supposed to
Get close to each other?
We gotta make that change, yeah
Why can't we just get along?

What a waste it would be to deny somebody
Of a chance to be theirselves
What a waste it would be if we hurt for nothing?
But I know that the world can change
The day we know we're all the same

(Why can't we just get along?)
Why can't we just get along?
(Why can't we just get along?)
If loving one another's wrong
(Why can't we just get along?)
Then how are we supposed to
Get close to each other?
We gotta make that change, yeah

I know we could break apart
We don't have to go that way
Not today

Why can't we just get along?
If loving one another's wrong
Then how are we supposed to
Get close to yeah
(Why can't we just get along?)
Why can't we just get along?
(Why can't we just get along?)
If loving one another's wrong
(Why can't we just get along?)
Then how are we supposed to
Get close to each other?
We gotta make that change, yeah

The change, yeah
