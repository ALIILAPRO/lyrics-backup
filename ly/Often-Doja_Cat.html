		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You must do this often
You must do this often
You must do this often
You must do this
Oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa

Baby, it's so telling
What you can do
It's a simple understanding
Between me and you
Oh, because

'Cause when you run your tongue up my thigh
I can't help but wonder, hmm, why?
You got so much more up yo' sleeve
You wanna make sure I don't leave
I won't, and what is this now?
You must make your daddy so proud
Way you bump n' grindin' on me
You got more than something I need

You must do this often
Practice on me or perform
You must do this often
Because I really want more
You must do this often
Makin' my way to your door
You must do this
Oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa

I just wanna watch us again
and over again
Superstar
Professional
You already read the room
I wanna do intervals
Let that soak in

'Cause when you run your tongue up my thigh
I can't help but wonder, hmm, why?
You got so much more up yo' sleeve
You wanna make sure I don't leave
I won't, and what is this now?
You must make your daddy so proud
Way you bump n' grindin' on me
You got more than something I need
