		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish there was a way for me to put this into words
All these feelings that I have as I start to lose control
(I feel panic rushing over me and gripping at my chest)
(And no matter what I say or do, I know that that it won't rest)
I feel my vision fade, sweat dripping down my back
I can hear my heart pound, I can feel my mind crack
(And I know that you love me and you want to save me now)
In the end of it all you can't save me from myself

Am I too damaged for you?
After everything we've been through
If you go, I won't stop you
You're not damaged like me
Am I too damaged for you?
After everything we went through
If you stay, I won't stop you
You'll end up damaged like me

I know you think I'm damaged and I question everything
I'm obsessive and compulsive, a disorder I can't flee
(I'll race you to the end you see I got a manic side)
(And the more I try to fight it he grows stronger every time)
Post-traumatic stress, yeah, that's what my doctor said
So when I think I'm dying, I just got to take a breath
(I know that you love me and you want to save me now)
In the end of it all you can't save me from myself

Am I too damaged for you?
After everything we've been through
If you go, I won't stop you
You're not damaged like me
Am I too damaged for you?
After everything we went through
If you stay, I won't stop you
You'll end up damaged like me

You know I never wanted you to leave
I didn't mean for you to hurt along the way
'Cause I would tear myself apart without you here
You would sabotage it all for me to stay
I'm code red (it's alright)
Code red (it's alright)

Am I too damaged for you?
After everything we've been through
If you go, I won't stop you
You're not damaged like me
Am I too damaged for you?
After everything we went through
If you stay, I won't stop you
You'll end up damaged like me
Damaged like me
You're not damaged like me
