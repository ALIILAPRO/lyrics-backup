		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gave you everything, everything, everything, everything, everything

Gave you everything, yeah
Think I need to take it all back (take it all back, hey)
I gave you everything, yeah
But you don't know what to do with all that
And that's on everything
I'ma have to switch, switch up on you
Snip, snip, hit that nip tuck on you
Ring, ring, never pick up on you (yeah, brr)
I'ma have to switch, switch up on you
Snip, snip, hit that nip tuck on you
Let go, time to give up on you

Hmm
See, I used to curve to niggas like you
Skrr, skrr, swerve niggas like you
Even though I heard what you might do
I didn't get concerned 'cause I liked you
But no, no, I can't hide to you
I, I can't lie, it's too hard (so hard, so hard)
I need more than what you got from me
You want a bad bitch, and new cars

And I gave you everything, yeah
Think I need to take it all back (take it all, take it all back)
I gave you everything, yeah
But you don't know what to do with all that
And that's on everything
I'ma have to switch, switch up on you
Snip, snip, hit that nip tuck on you
Ring, ring, never pick up on you, oh
I'ma have to switch, switch up on you
Snip, snip, hit that nip tuck on you
Let go, time to give up on you

I know how to flip niggas like you
I got petty and clip niggas like you
Fuck around and forget niggas like you
Promise I could never miss niggas like you
Said no, no
Feeling's fadin' away
I can't hear what you say
I need more than what you got from me
You got a bad bitch, you won't stay

And I gave you everything, yeah
Think I need to take it all back (take it all, take it all back)
I gave you everything, yeah
But you don't know what to do with all that
And that's on everything
I'ma have to switch, switch up on you
Snip, snip, hit that nip tuck on you
Ring, ring, never pick up on you, oh
I'ma have to switch, switch up on you
Snip, snip, hit that nip tuck on you
Let go, time to give up on you

Yo
Give up on 'em, I don't even wanna get up on 'em
And I ain't tryna work it out
But I'm at the gym, on a mat doin' sit ups 'em
You let yourself go, you don't represent O
So trust me, just go
You settle for less, yo, you disrespectful
You is bad show, the new you just dull
So cut all that bull, the nerve of me to come off my pedestal
Come off my pedestal, money off that edible
Which means that bags stacked high
You ain't get the drive, my nigga your pedal stalled
You said you wept, aww, everyday a queen you slept on
And I ain't talkin' 'but your mattresses 
But, um, you the type of player I press eject on
I can't believe you played for that long
I never re-respected nobody
I never needed you, you must have thought I did
I should have copped the stick but I'm Teflon
Pressed on, head's strong, sex the bomb
Dreams of a bad bitch tryna F a don
If it's word bond, any one I sex, icons
If he bust down and don't wanna waste my time
Who the fuck you thought you was tryna stunt on Nick'?
Shoulda put you on blast like a gun on hip
But it's okay, we gon' keep secrets, nigga
'Cause a true bad bitch ain't weak or bitter
