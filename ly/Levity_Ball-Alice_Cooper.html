		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got my invitation
To the annual levity ball
Seeing the location
Was within the mirrored room
Walking in my room I found that I
Had nothing to find
I got into my evening wear and
Left my clothes behind

I sat down on the stairway
Seven hours at a time
Writing all of this poetry
That I knew would never rhyme
The memory I know I must have
Had when I came in
Was of some weary places
Where I've never ever been

And then in came a cake all
Decorated in my name
With four paper brown candles
Are all spelling out this name
The clock was passing out
From time to time I saw it all 
Beginning of the ending
Of my first levity ball
