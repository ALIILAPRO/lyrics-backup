		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's just like breathin', speakin'
When we touch, like a force of nature
Not just a feelin', let's believe it
The birth of love like a force of nature

Undeniable (it's our love)
Unforgettable (it's our love)
Nothing compares to when
I feel you on my skin

It feels so natural, natural
When we come together
Like a force of nature
It feels so natural, natural
When we come together
Like a force of nature

When we come together, together, together
When we come together, together, together

Pure heart, deeper
Beautiful, like the bluest ocean
Like a wave, we broke down
The barriers, like the bluest ocean

It's incredible (it's our love)
Unforgettable (it's our love)
Nothing compares to when
I feel you on my skin

It feels so natural, natural
When we come together
Like a force of nature
It feels so natural, natural
When we come together
Like a force of nature

When we come together, together, together
When we come together, together, together

Like a hurricane (it's our love)
Like a hurricane (it's our love)
Like a hurricane
When we come together
Like a hurricane (it's our love)
Like a hurricane (it's our love)
Like a hurricane
When we come together

It feels so natural, natural
When we come together
Like a force of nature
It feels so natural, natural
When we come together
Like a force of nature

Let's come together, come together
Right now, right now
Let's come together, come together
Right now, right now
Come together, together
Right now
