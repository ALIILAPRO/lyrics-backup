		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I get tired of this me-first attitude
You are the one thing that keeps me smiling
That's why I'm always wishing hard for you

'Cause your life shines so bright
I don't feel no solitude
You are my first star at night
I'd be lost in space without you

And I'll never lose my faith in you
How will I ever get to heaven, if I do

Feels just so fine
When we touch the sky, me and you
This is my idea of heaven
Why can't it always be so good?

But it's alright, I know you're out there
Doing what you've gotta do
You are my soul satellite
I'd be lost in space without you

And I'll never lose my faith in you
How will I ever get to heaven, if I do
I'll never lose my faith in you
How will I ever get to heaven, if I do

I'll never lose my faith in you
I will never lose my faith in you
I will never lose my faith in you
I will never lose my faith in you
I will never lose my faith in you
I will never lose my faith in you
I will never lose my faith in you
I will never lose my faith in you
I will never lose my faith in you
I will never lose my faith in you
I will never lose my faith in you
I will never lose my faith in you
I will never lose my faith in you
I will never lose my faith in you
I will never lose my faith in you
