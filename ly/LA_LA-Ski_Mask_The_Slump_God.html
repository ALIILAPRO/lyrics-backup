		<p>
		  La, la, laa (huh)
La, la, laa (huh)
La, laa, la, laa
Oh my god, Ronny
Stupid

Like a Quarter Pounder, I found her
She with a boy think it's Ned Flanders
She said that, really nice
With my ice, I drown her
I found her soul in the night
She's a Salamander
Cold blooded the type

Yuh, this ain't that, bitch (yuh), that ain't this (yuh), yuh (yuh)
This ain't that, bitch (yuh), that ain't this (yuh), yuh (water)
This ain't that, bitch (yuh), that ain't this (yuh), yuh (bitch)
This that him that's talking shit
Bend him like a blimp (yuh)

I know she gon' swallow like the bitch can't swim, yuh
Hit 'em with a follow when a bitch can't tip, yuh
Who the fuck the reaper? Fuck that nigga named Grim, yuh
I am the one with light inside the darkness of the den, yuh
I'm a god but I'm still praising God too
Know a nigga know dogs, sell dog food
Know my game on point, no harpoon
Know a nigga said I'm fry, so I told 'em get fist
'Cause these niggas too old, too broke too (aye, aye)
Cut em' off my frequency, no Pro Tools (aye)
Blue cheese and blue jeans and you know they're Balmains
So they come with the wrinkles like a Pug do (ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)

Yuh, this ain't that, bitch, that ain't this, yuh
This ain't that, bitch (yeah), that ain't this, yuh (woo)
This ain't that, bitch (ha ah), that ain't this, yuh (bitch)
This that him that's talking shit
Bend him like a blimp (Let's go, yuh)

Gucci on my body feel like water, I can't swim (yuh)
So I bought a Gucci rubber ducky with the fins (yuh)
When I was a youngin', hid at home I was 10 (yuh)
Told my Dad, "I'm selling molly", ninth grade in (yuh)
You are now inside of my mind
It is very black and white, no mime
I put diamonds up on my time, mhm
Laid back sippin' Fiji with the lime, do
She an animal, eat me like bamboo
Young nigga, and I'm sly like Cantu

Yuh, this ain't that, bitch (yuh), that ain't this (yuh), yuh (bitch)
This ain't that, bitch (yuh), that ain't this, yuh (woo)
This ain't that, bitch, that ain't this , yuh (water)
This that him that's talking shit (bitch)
Bend him like a blimp (bitch)

La, la, a, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
