		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alright, Mello made it right
Bye-bye, bye-bye
Oh my, get out my life
She said, "Why?"
(Mello made it right)

I hit her with a bye-bye, bye-bye
You're out your mind
I'm out of pills
And you're out of lies
It stays dark outside
Even when it's daytime
Like, bye-bye, bye-bye
Uh, bye-bye, bye-bye

Um, see you later, uh
Girl, I got a question for you, yeah, I need a favor (uh)
Turn yourself back to a demon, I'm a demon slayer (uh)
Hell-proof to the core, take me to your lair (uh)
Uh, hella persuasive
Hella curved animation like The Matrix
Percocet, body achin', stomach achin'
Feel like it's a fuckin' earthquake where my brain is (huh, oh)
Hell's Kitchen blazing
Cooking coke up for slave masters, bloody apron
I remember havin' a dream catcher when I was like ten
Set that bitch on fire
All my dreams been coming true since (been coming true since)

Hit her with a bye-bye, bye-bye
You're out your mind
I'm out of pills
And you're out of lies
It stays dark outside
Even when it's daytime
Like, bye-bye, bye-bye
Uh, bye-bye, bye-bye
