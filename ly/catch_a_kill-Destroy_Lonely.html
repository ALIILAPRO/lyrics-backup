		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Huh, huh, shawty, she dancin', making a scene
Ass bounce, trampoline, I got a whole lot of pints of lean
I got a whole lot of clothes, CELINE
I got a whole lot of sticks and ammo, bitch, I loaded the magazine
I look like a model, I look like I'm 'posed to just pose on the cover of magazines
My bitch like a model, she look too bad, but nah, she ain't too bad for me
Me and the gang, we slide, we creep
I'm in a Trackhawk Jeep, my boy in the 720S, McLaren
Suicide doors on the creature, my main ho trippin', yeah
'Cause I don't be caring, I'm too damn evil
I can't even lie, you pretty, baby, but I don't think that I need you
Huh, I'm sippin' on red, yeah, my young nigga'll wet you up
I got racks, upper echelon, my bad bitch too wet, yeah
I got water, I got way more water than a bathtub
I just been tweakin' lately, huh, I don't give no fuck
Tell that ho to pull up, I'ma throw it, throw more than a dub
Stripper party in the studio, I don't go to clubs
I'm at Prime Italian, in Miami, bitch, I'm eatin' good
I know my niggas tied, so I gotta get up out that hood
Know your tushy tight, yeah, I fuck that bitch, I fuck her good
I done burned the tires off the whip, I slide it through your hood
I don't get tired, real vamp, bitch, I'm up all night
I fuck thick hoes, real thick hoes, super thighs
Money, American Deli, I got a ten piece with some fries
She got a pink pussy, I call my lil' freak Nicki Minaj

Then go outer-space, yeah, Phantom came with some stars
When I'm in L.A., I fuck on every superstar, bitch
I smoke out the bag every day, I don't want a zip
And I'm pourin' up real mud, do you want a sip?

Baby, do you want a sip?
I just called my shooter up and he ready to catch a kill
I just called my shooter up, he ready to catch a kill
Ten-thousand on your head, you'll be dead for real
Thirty-thousand in my bed, nigga, yeah, for real
I was signed into a deal, goin' crazy, a hundred mil'
I just throw that money up and watch it fall
I just throw that money up and watch it fall
We got bitches poppin', poppin', poppin' pussy, yeah, now
We got bitches poppin', poppin', poppin' pussy, yeah, now
Nigga tried to get over on me, hell nah
Nigga tried to pull a move on me, we knock his head off
I'm the Top Floor, Top Floor, Top Floor, Top Floor, Top Floor, Top Floor Boss
I got gang members on the top floor, servin' pitbull, that dog
Yeah, my chain hangin' and it's swingin', I got VVSs shawty
If you ain't gang-gang, then you ain't in, it's a real nigga party
It's a boss bitch party, yeah, shawty
Yeah, let's get it started, huh, yeah, shawty
Ain't no keepers, but it's started, it's a foreign
She a freak and she pop a pill, yeah, she gettin' horny
Woah, yeah, this shit get crazy
This bitch tried to come and trap me for a baby
I just bought my old bitch a brand new Mercedes
I cut off the old shit, now I'm goin' brazy
I cut off the old shit, now I'm goin' brazy
I cut off the old shit, now I'm goin' brazy
I cut off the old shit, now I'm goin' brazy
I cut off the old bitch, now I'm goin brazy
