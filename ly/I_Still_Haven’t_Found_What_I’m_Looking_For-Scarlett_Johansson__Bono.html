		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have climbed highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

I believe in the kingdom come
Then all the colors will bleed into one
Bleed into one
Well yes, I'm still running

You broke the bonds
And you loosed the chains
You carried the cross
Of my shame
Oh my shame
You know I believe it

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

(But I still haven't found what I'm looking for)
(But I still haven't found what I'm looking for)
