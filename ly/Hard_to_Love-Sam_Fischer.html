		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can shut off for days at a time
Do what I want without you in mind
I try to change
But it's hard to change
When I get it wrong, you get it right
And I'm just a loner in your social life
And I'm always late
And I always say

I gotta break these habits before I die
I just need some time

I'm doin' all I can to be a better man
So, please don't give me up when I'm hard to love
My heart's a little roughed up, it can be too much, but
Please, don't give me up
When I'm hard to love, hard to love, hard to love
When I'm hard to love, hard to love, hard to love

I don't wanna let you down like I have before
You've got your share of reasons not to love me anymore
I drink but I still pray, I cry but I'm okay
'Cause you forgive me when I can't forgive myself

Oh, I gotta break these habits before I die
I just need some time

I'm doin' all I can to be a better man
So, please don't give me up when I'm hard to love
My heart's a little roughed up, it can be too much, but
Please, don't give me up when I'm hard to love

When I get it wrong, you get it right
And I'm just a loner in your social life
I try to change
But it's hard to change

I'm doin' all I can to be a better man
So, please don't give me up when I'm hard to love
My heart's a little roughed up, it can be too much, but
Please, don't give me up
When I'm hard to love, hard to love, hard to love
When I'm hard to love, hard to love, hard to love
When I'm hard to love, hard to love, hard to love
When I'm hard to love, hard to love, hard to love
