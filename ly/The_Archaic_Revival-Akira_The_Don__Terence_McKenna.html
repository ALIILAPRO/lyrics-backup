		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The way I think of the psychedelics is
They are catalysts to the imagination
They were back 100, 000 years ago
The imagination
Which was just this glimmering
This iridescence on the surface
Of ape cognition
Was under the influence of the reciprocal
Feedback of self-reflection
That is created by watching your own mind

Watching your own mind
Watching your own mind
Watching your own mind

Because it has suddenly become interesting
Because it has suddenly been flooded
By a psychoactive aiming, that iridеscence
Has been coaxed into languagе
Art, to architecture, music, poetry
The whole ball of whack
But now, we know these things
We can uncover the secret of our origin
(of our origin)
I'm very keen for the notion of
What I call the archaic revival
And the archaic revival is
This overarching metaphor
That is the way for us to go
To save our necks at this point
When a culture gets into trouble
Instinctively what it does is it goes
Back through it's own past
Until it finds a moment where
Things seemed to make sense and then it

Brings that moment forward into the present
The archaic revival
Brings that moment forward into the present
The archaic revival
Brings that moment forward into the present
The archaic revival
Brings that moment forward into the present

When medieval Christianity
No longer made sense to a major percentage
Of the people of Western Europe
The intellectuals of that time instinctively
Reached backwards into the past
Looking for a stable model and finally
They reached the golden age
Of Periclean Athens
And there they found Plato
Aristotle, the dramatists
And they created classicism
Classicism was brought to birth
In the 1400s, 2
000 years after the death of Plato
We are the children of
This classical revival
Which we call the Renaissance
Our theories of law, our theories of
Government, our notion of justice
All drawn from classical Greek and Roman
Models brought back from the dead
500 years ago by a bunch of
Italian investment bankers who thought
This was a good model to
Hang their civilization on

Brings that moment forward into the present
The archaic revival
Brings that moment forward into the present
The archaic revival
Brings that moment forward into the present
The archaic revival
Brings that moment forward into the present
The archaic revival
So, we must now reach far back into
Time for a new cultural model
Our crisis is so great that we have
To reach back to the high paleolithic
To the moment immediately before
The invention of agriculture
And the creation of the dominator ego
