		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You should go)
Mending a broken heart, at least I'm right on the beat (go)
After I heard about all the company you keep
(You should've known)
Don't know them bitches by name, won't even lie
(You should know)
But since you went sealing our fate, you don't get no goodbye

I hit whoever, I held us together so don't say whatever now (ooh-oh-oh)
You being selfish and you should know better, there ain't no forever now (ooh-oh-oh)
Played your game, now I feel the flame die out (ooh-oh-oh)
Now I just wanna know how (oh-oh)

How you act so easy? (Easy)
Say your ass gon' leave me? (Leave me?)
Well, if you say that, better mean it (mean it)
And you better back that with a reason (reason)
Sayin', "Oh girl, before you go, you better know, you better know"
I don't do no pleadin' (pleadin')
You can hit the Four Seasons (yeah)

Look who you made me turn into lately
It's hard to not offend, 'cause ain't it your fault again?
Had to be crazy for thinking you changed
We had a feeling you can't beat
Now we gotta seek out a plan B

I hit whoever, I held us together so don't say whatever now (ooh-oh-oh)
You being selfish and you should know better, there ain't no forever now (ooh-oh-oh)
Played your game, now I feel the flame die out (ooh-oh-oh)
Now I just wanna know how (oh-oh)

How you act so easy? (Easy)
Say your ass gon' leave me? (Leave me?)
Well, if you say that, better mean it (mean it)
And you better back that with a reason (reason)
Sayin', "Oh girl, before you go, you better know, you better know"
I don't do no pleadin' (pleadin')
You can hit the Four Seasons (yeah)

Mean it, mean it
Mean it, mean it
Mean it, mean it
Mean it, mean it
Mean it
