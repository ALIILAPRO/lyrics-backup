		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who'll ride this dying carousel?
Four rusting horses strangled by their own rope
What children love a singing wheel
Now that their tight hearts it broke
That their tight hearts it broke

Everyone will come, everyone will come to my funeral
To make sure that I stay dead
Everyone will come, everyone will come to my funeral
To make sure that I stay dead

I can see the coffin shining through my tinted window
Must've missed the sign that said it was a fire sale
I can see the coffin shining through my tinted window
Must've missed the sign that said it was a fire sale

Everyone will come, everyone will come to my funeral
To make sure that I stay dead
Everyone will come, everyone will come to my funeral
To make sure that I stay dead

You can't take this from me
(forbidden in Heaven and useless in Hell)
You can't take this from me
(forbidden in Heaven and useless in Hell)
Useless in Hell

I can see the coffin shining through my tinted window
Must've missed the sign that said it was a fire sale
I can see the coffin shining through my tinted window
Must've missed the sign that said it was a fire sale

Everyone will come, everyone will come to my funeral
To make sure that I stay dead
Everyone will come, everyone will come to my funeral
To make sure that I stay dead

You can't take this from me
(forbidden in Heaven and useless in Hell)
You can't take this from me
(forbidden in Heaven and useless in Hell)
You can't take this from me
(forbidden in Heaven and useless in Hell)
You can't take this from me
(forbidden in Heaven and useless in Hell)
Useless in Hell

Who'll ride this dying carousel?
Four rusted horses strangled by their own rope
What children love a singing wheel
Now that their tight hearts it broke
That their tight hearts it broke
