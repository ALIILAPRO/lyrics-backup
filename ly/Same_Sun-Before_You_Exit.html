		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't be the only one
Who still believes with everything
The best is yet to come

I can't be the only one
Who wants to see a world 
Where every daughter, every son

Flood these streets with harmony and love

We're all under the same sun
We go until the days done
So maybe just for once
We could try to be one
We're all under the same sun 

You are not the only one
Who has their days where every dream
Is hard to carry on

Know that it takes only one
To bring upon a change
For every color, old and young

Hear them sing with melody and love

We're all under the same sun
We go until the days done
So maybe just for once
We could try to be one
We're all under the same sun

Just look up
Don’t close your mind
It’s all alright
It’s all alright

Just look up 
No don’t you cry
It’s all alright
It’s alright

We're all under the same sun
It don’t matter where you’re from
So maybe just for once
We could try to be one
We're all under the same sun
