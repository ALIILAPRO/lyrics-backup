		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We said it so wrong
by cutting our tongue.
We fed our own soul a gun
to kill the nights crawling numb,
lost in between lines
in incoherent sound.
If we were all blind in mind,
we’d hear it so loud.
And All the things glow

Turn the lights out,
we will all see.
All the things glow in our
placebo IV.
Pretend you can see
directly through me.
Our broken mind embassy,
this is not real.
Turn the lights out

We said it so wrong
by cutting our tongue.
We fed our own soul a gun
to kill the lights, one by one.
Lost in between lines
in incoherent sound.
If we were all blind in mind,
we’d hear it so loud.

All the things glow
all around me.
Another fake role - is gone,
how does it feel?
Our sheltered black hole
forgot to be real.
Our picture on hold you run,
you cannot unsee.
