		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Riding on this know-how
Never been here before
Peculiarly entrusted
Possibly that's all

Is history recorded
Does someone have a tape?
Surely, I'm no pioneer
Constellations stay the same 

Just a little bit of danger
When intriguingly
Our little secret
Trust say trust me

'Cause no one will ever know
That this was happening
So tell me why you listen
When nobody's talking?

Oh oh oh, what is there to know?
Oh, this is what it is
Oh oh oh, you and me alone
Sheer simplicity 

Oh oh oh, what is there to know?
Oh, this is what it is
Oh oh oh, you and me alone
Sheer simplicity 

Oh oh oh, what is there to know?
Oh, this is what it is
Oh oh oh, you and me alone
Sheer simplicity
