		  (Banger)
(The Melody)
(DJ on the beat, so it's a banger)

I was too lazy, I had to get up
He died from cancer, he ain't get a check-up
I went Travis Barker, tatted the neck up
I feel better, gettin' deeper religion
Court for child supports visits, I'm better
Say you love me with a hidden agenda
Low seven steam, I took down the mirror
Stole from me, old management devils
Trenches broke, I gotta hold 'em together
Tryna claim the lil' boy, I'm better
If I'ma change, I'ma change forever
I ain't tryna stay in this lane forever
He was that nigga, now servin' cheddar (cheese)
I die, niggas won't T up for me
You wasn't there for who helped you
You think you gon' be there for me?

Feel like a dream, pourin' up the lean
Turned me a to man, they plan's just to leave

Think I'ma help 'em, won't help 'em again
Think I'ma help 'em, won't help 'em again
Think I'ma help 'em, won't help 'em again
Think I'ma help 'em, won't help 'em again

Copy what I said, you sound like a parrot
How you send your kids lookin' generic?
You better be lucky I'm cool with Amiri
New kids season, I know that you see it
Sendin' shots when I come to the city
I'ma shoot with the money, but threat gon' protect me
I'm the way out, they just cannot accept it
You my son, I had more than your daddy
The gas worth more than 757, new Patek say 757
I can't wait 'til it's 7:58
Ramadan comin', I just be hopin' you full and you fed
'Salaam alaykum, wa alaykum 'salaam to the people we fed
It's the people who in the trenches I really got love for wanna see me dead
Answer the phone to show 'em I ain't scared
Daddy got life so he told me he comin' home too late
I told him, "I'm goin' to bed"
When she get mad, she be playin' with my head
Do not deliver, act like you ain't read it
Too far without me, can't put on her Patek
The label gave me another thirty mill', I hate that you don't got it

Think I'ma help 'em, won't help 'em again 
Think I'ma help 'em, won't help 'em again 
Think I'ma help 'em, won't help 'em again 
Think I'ma help 'em, won't help 'em again 
Think I'ma help 'em, won't help 'em again
Think I'ma help 'em, won't help 'em again 
Think I'ma help 'em, won't help 'em again 
Think I'ma help 'em, won't help 'em again 

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
