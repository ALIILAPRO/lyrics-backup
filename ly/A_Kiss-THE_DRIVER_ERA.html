		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Apparently I've lost control
To all my friends have told me so)
Na na na na na
Na na na na na

Look out, I'm on a wave
Don't give a fuck of what you say
Apparently I've lost control
To all my friends that told me so
Just get out the way
Because we don't want to behave
Apparently you lost control
You never really had before

Say, ooh you changed, you're not the same
You're different than the way that I loved you
The way that I loved you
But honestly it won't matter in a day or so
So why are you so precious about it?
So precious about it?
It's just a curve upon the lips, the hips
Just the satisfaction of the twist, the twist
Nothing the matter with a kiss, a kiss
Nothing the matter with a kiss, a kiss
It's just a curve upon the lips, the hips
Just the satisfaction of the twist, the twist
Nothing the matter with a kiss, a kiss
Nothing, it's just a little, ha, it's just a little
Ha, it's just a little kiss

(Na na na na na)
(Na na na na na)
(Na na na na na)

Ha it's just a little
Oh was 'bout to cut the drapes

Secure the feeling in my face (well sorta)
But why is it that you're so scared?
Or is it that you're unaware?
Just let me have my face
I didn't grab her by mistake (no)
We're dancing like we lost control
We've done a bit of times before

Say, ooh you changed, you're not the same
You're different than the way that I loved you
The way that I loved you
But honestly it won't matter in a day or so
So why are you so precious about it?
So precious about it?

It's just a curve upon the lips, the hips
Just the satisfaction of the twist, the twist
Nothing the matter with a kiss, a kiss
Nothing the matter with a kiss, a kiss
It's just a curve upon the lips, the hips
Just the satisfaction of the twist, the twist
Nothing the matter with a kiss, a kiss
Nothing, it's just a little, ha, it's just a little
Ha, it's just a little kiss

(Na na na na na)
(Na na na na na)
(Na na na na na)
Ha it's just a little, ha, it's just a little kiss
(Na na na na na)
(Na na na na na)
(Na na na na na)
(It's just a little)

It's just a curve upon the lips, the hips
Just the satisfaction of the twist, the twist
Nothing the matter with a kiss, a kiss
Nothing the matter with a kiss, a kiss
It's just a curve upon the lips, the hips
Just the satisfaction of the twist, the twist
Nothing the matter with a kiss, a kiss
Nothing it's just a little, ha, it's just a little
It's just a curve upon the lips, the hips
Just the satisfaction of the twist, the twist
Nothing the matter with a kiss, a kiss
Nothing the matter with a kiss, a kiss
It's just a curve upon the lips, the hips
Just the satisfaction of the twist, the twist
Nothing the matter with a kiss, a kiss
Nothing, it's just a little, ha, it's just a little
Ha, it's just a little kiss
(Na na na na na)
(Na na na na na)
(Na na na na na)
Ha it's just a little, ha, it's just a little kiss
(Na na na na na)
(Na na na na na)
(Na na na na na)
Ha, it's just a little, ha, it's just a little
