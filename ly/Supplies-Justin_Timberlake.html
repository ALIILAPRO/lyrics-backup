		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo, ain't no need of stoppin', girl
Yeah, there ain't no need of stoppin', girl
Yeah, OK

Met you out on Broadway on the hottest night in town
We arrived solo but we were bein' chased around
Saw you bein' cornered by some guy you used to know
Stepped in between the both of y'all
Said, "I'm leavin', do you wanna go?"

'Cause I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity
Some shit's 'bout to go down
I'll be the one with the level head
The world can end now
Baby, we'll be livin' in The Walkin' Dead

'Cause I got supplie ie ies
Supplie ie ies
I got you, I got supplie ie ies
Supplie ie ies

I don't know if you remember this
But I was out of town
Flew in on a three a.m. just to show up and hear your sounds
The multiple times, stop, hit the set
You ain't had it that way
I can guarantee you that

'Cause I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity
Some shit's 'bout to go down
I'll be the one with the level head
The world can end now
Baby, we'll be livin' in The Walkin' Dead

'Cause I got supplie ie ies
Supplie ie ies
I got you, I got supplie ie ies
Supplie ie ies

Ain't no need of stoppin', girl
Can't nobody top it, girl
Ain't no better option, girl, OK
Ain't nobody stoppin', girl
This here when I drop in, girl
I work, work when I clock in, girl, OK

I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity
Some shit's 'bout to go down
I'll be the one with the level head
The world can end now
Baby, we'll be livin' in The Walkin' Dead

Now I wanna know everything
Don't leave a single detail out
I'll get mine later, just fell out
It makes me a generous lover
Ooh, I wanna see everything
So don't leave a single detail out
I want it all on the table
The personal way to, wait

Ain't no need of stoppin', girl
Yeah, there ain't no need of stoppin', girl
Yeah, OK

'Cause I got supplie ie ies
Supplie ie ies
I got you, I got supplie ie ies
Supplie ie ies
