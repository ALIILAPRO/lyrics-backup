		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me all you've got, ooh yeah (tell me more)
Your love has captured me

Over and over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
When all the while inside
I knew it was real (ooh)
The way you make me feel, hey, hey (ooh yeah)
And ooh (oh)

Lyin' here next to you, oh
Time just seems to fly, yeah
Needin' you more and more (more and more)
Let's give love a try (let's give love a try)
I wanna try love

Sweeter and sweeter love grows
And heaven's there for those
Who fool the tricks of time
With hearts of love will find
True love in a special way (love, ooh)

The closer I get to you, baby (the closer I get to you, baby)
The more you make me see (the more you make me see)
By givin' me what you've got (oh, yeah)
Your love captured me

Ooh over and over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
When all the while inside
I knew this was real, got to be real (got to be real)
The way you make me feel (you know, you know, you know)
My baby, my baby, my baby, my love, my love, my love, my love, ooh
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)

(Come closer love) come a little closer so that we can see into the eyes of love
I wanna see into those eyes of love
(Come closer love) just a little a closer, let me speak to you
I wanna softly tell you something
Here I am and here's my love, I just want you to come closer, yeah
Come a little closer, let me whisper in your ear
'Cause I wanna tell you something
I wanna whisper in your ear so soft, so come closer love
Move on in real close so we can celebrate the way we feel about each other's lovin'
Wanna tell you words, words of love, words that make you wanna
