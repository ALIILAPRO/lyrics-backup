		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's not your eyes
It's not what you say
It's not your laughter that gives you away
You're just lonely
You've been lonely, too long

All your actin'
Your thin disguise
All your perfectly delivered lies
They don't fool me
You've been lonely, too long

Let me in the wall, you've built around
And we can light a match and burn it down
Let me hold your hand and dance 'round and 'round the flame
In front of us
Dust to

You've held your head up
You've fought the fight
You bear the scars
You've done your time
Listen to me
You've been lonely, too long

Let me in the wall, you've built around
And we can light a match and burn them down
And let me hold your hand and dance 'round and 'round the flames
In front of us
Dust to dust

You're like a mirror, reflecting me
Takes one to know one, so take it from me
You've been lonely
You've been lonely, too long
We've been lonely
We've been lonely, too long
