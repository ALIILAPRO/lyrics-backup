		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Think I might
Think I might love my-
Think I might
(Think I might love myself) think I might
Think I might love my-
Think I might
Think I might love myself
Think I might
Think I might love my-
Think I might
Think I might love myself

I thought love was overrated
And I don't know how to take it
Still chasing ghosts
I feel so unsure
And I sold myself a lie
Still gave it one more try
Gave everything that I had and more

Couldn't happen to me
Couldn't happen to me
Couldn't happen to me
Ooh, then it

Took my body over
Lost all my composure
Never felt quite like this before
Chemistry is changing
Emotions rearranging
I'm outta my cage
Breaking my spell
Think I might (think I might)
Think I might love myself

Think I might love my-
Think I might
Think I might love myself
Think I might
Think I might love my-
Think I might
Think I might love myself

Trade my hope for pain
Still hate who I became
How long am I gonna be young and lost?
Might never feel right
Never be clear
But nothing'll change until I face my fear
Done paying the price without knowing the cost

Could it happen to me?
Could it happen to me?
Could it happen to me? Yea-yeah, woo

It took my body over
Lost all my composure
Never felt quite like this before
Chemistry is changing
Emotions rearranging
I'm outta my cage
Breaking my spell
Think I might (think I might)
Think I might love myself

Think I might
Think I might love my-
Think I might
Think I might love my-

Focused on the time
How I'm loosing every minute
Gotta make a choice
Gotta push it to the limit
Never felt better
Never making an apology
(I'm exactly who I wanna be)

(I'm exactly who I wanna be)

Well, it took my body over
Lost all my composure
Never felt quite like this before
Chemistry is changing
Emotions rearranging
I'm outta my cage
Breaking my spell
Think I might
Think I might love myself

(Think I might love myself)
Think I might love myself
