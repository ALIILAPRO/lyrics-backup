		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hello, my name is Mr. Fear
I wish I had a faster therapy
I've come to mind control your needs
Tonight I'm gonna star all of your leads

You know
I'll never disappear
Now get me out of here
Just trust in me, my dear
No cure is coming near

How long you'll call me insincere?
I'm not here to fulfill your parody
How come my song becomes unreal?
You never understand my melodies

You know
I'll never disappear
Now get me out of here
Just trust in me, my dear
No cure is coming

You know
I'll never disappear
Now get us out of here
Don't fight with me, my dear
Why can't I be in here?

Cause you make me feel like I'm so alone
I know it's not real, but is in my soul
And I just can try to face
The dark inside my head

You know
I'll never disappear
Now get me out of here
Just trust in me, my dear
No cure is coming

You know
I'll never disappear
Now get us out of here
Don't trust in me my dear
What cure is coming near?
