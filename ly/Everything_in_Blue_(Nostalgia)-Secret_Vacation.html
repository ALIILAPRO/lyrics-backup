		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dandelions
Old cartoons
Taco nights
Nightly news
Nostalgia coming through when it's just me and you
We think of everything in blue
Quite alright if you do too
I don't mind filling your shoes
It's not the life we choose
It's not just me and you
We think of everything in blue
You and I
Are so alike
Every time
I see my face
You and I
were born this way
You and I
Are so alike
Every time
I hear my name
You and I
were born this way
I don't mind filling your shoes
Fire inside you until you see the sun behind the moon
You'll come home soon
And I can't wait to follow through
You and I
Are so alike
Every time
I see my face
You and I
were born this way
You and I
Are so alike
Every time
I hear my name
You and I
were born this way
