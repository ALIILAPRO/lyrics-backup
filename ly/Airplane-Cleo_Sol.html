		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Little bird don't cry
Know you hurt your wing when you fell outside
Some will cheer, the flight is over
And doubt, give grace, but don't you walk away

And you will find your power
Little bird, wait
And you will fly again, no fear
High like an airplane

You never fell before
Well, people never ever share when they're hurting
We gotta know which way the wind is blowing
And change direction to find where love is

Know that life will test the favour all the time
Seasons while they change, keep holding on, fly high
I'm gonna teach you and pick you up when you're torn in pieces
Time to embrace, when you face it, it will go your way
Take a bible, read the scriptures, they'll say
Blessed forever, are those who hear the word of God, and obey

And you will find your power
Little bird, wait
And you will fly again, no fear
High like an airplane
And you will find your power
Little bird, wait
And you will fly again, no fear
High like an airplane

High, high
High, little bird, fly
Fly, fly, fly, fly
So high like an airplane
You will fly so high
