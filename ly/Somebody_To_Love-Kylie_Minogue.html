		<p>
		  One day the arrow's gonna get through
Nothing you can do, it's automatic
You won't know what you're getting into
But when it happens, it's cinematic

Strangers to friends and to lovers
Open your heart and let the solo go
We could be good for each other
Don't have to do it alone

So if you want somebody to love you
When you're feeling like the time is right
Maybe I could be the one that you run to
And forever could be starting tonight
I just want it to be real (real)
Don't ever break it up (break it up)
I know going with the feeling can be tough
But baby, if you want somebody to love you
That someone is me

Could be a dream we're holding onto
But just imagine, it could be magic (yeah)

Strangers to friends and to lovers
Open your heart and let the solo go
We could be good for each other
Don't have to do it alone

So if you want somebody to love you
When you're feeling like the time is right
Maybe I could be the one that you run to
And forever could be starting tonight
I just want it to be real (real)
Don't ever break it up (break it up)
I know going with the feeling can be tough
But baby, if you want somebody to love you
That someone is me

Know what it feels like right at midnight
That's when hearts get torn in two
But if it's wrong I don't wanna be right
Let those arrows shoot right through

Singing, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

If you want somebody to love you
When you're feeling like the time is right
Maybe I could be the one that you run to
And forever could be starting tonight
I just want it to be real (real)
Don't ever break it up (break it up)
I know going with the feeling can be tough
But baby, if you want somebody to love you
That someone is me

Singing, oh, oh, oh (from me, baby)
Oh, oh, oh (ooh, why do, why do ya?)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
