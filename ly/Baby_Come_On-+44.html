		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's a pretty girl
She's always fallin' down
And I think I just fell in love with her
But she won't ever remember, remember

And I can always find her
At the bottom of a plastic cup
Drownin' in drunk sincerity
A sad and lonely girl

Quit cryin' your eyes out
Quit cryin' your eyes out and baby come on
Isn't there something familiar about me?
The past is only the future with the lights on
Quit cryin' your eyes out, baby

And she said, I think we're runnin' out of alcohol
Tonight I hate this f***ing town
And all my best friends will be the death of me
But they won't ever remember, remember

So please take me far away
Before I'm melt into the ground
And all my words get used against me
You sad and lonely girl

Quit cryin' your eyes out
Quit cryin' your eyes out and baby come on
Isn't there something familiar about me?
The past is only the future with the lights on
Quit cryin' your eyes out, baby

Quit cryin' your eyes out
Quit cryin' your eyes out and baby come on
Isn't there something familiar about me?
The past is only the future with the lights on

Quit cryin' your eyes out
Isn't there something familiar about me?
Quit cryin' your eyes out
The past is only the future with the lights on
So quit cryin' your eyes out, baby
