		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is that a word you said, my love
Or just a gesture in tongues?
Well, I live to guess your sorrow
And you live to empty my lungs
And you've got me up in a frenzy again
And I know you're planning to
Leave in the end

Won't you say that you will?
Let the impulse to love
And the instinct to kill entangle to one
In this light, you are mine
'Til the sweat turns to blood
Won't you say that you will
Even if you won't?

Oh, is that a glint in your eye?
Is that a blade in your palm?
Well, I am yours tonight
So will you lay in my arms?
You've got me up in a frenzy again
I know you're planning to leave in the end

Won't you say that you will?
Let the impulse to love
And the instinct to kill entangle to one
In this light, you are mine
'Til the sweat turns to blood
Won't you say that you will
Even if you won't?
Won't you say that you will?
Let the impulse to love
And the instinct to kill entangle to one
In this light, you are mine
'Til the sweat turns to blood
Won't you say that you will
Even if you won't?

You've got me up in a frenzy again
You've got me up in a frenzy again
You've got me up in a frenzy again
You've got me up in a frenzy again
You've got me up in a frenzy again
You've got me up in a frenzy again
