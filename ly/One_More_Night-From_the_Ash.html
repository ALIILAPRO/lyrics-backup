		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another night in the darkness
Another day in the silence
It's like a bad dream
That you can't wake up from
And all these dreams are like nightmares
They bring the day that you can't keep facing
'Cause you can't face another day

As your life runs by your eyes
You hear a voice from the other side

Fight for your life 
For your right
Are you afraid to die 
Is there fear deep inside
Just hang on one more night
I'll be there by your side
There's no hope in suicide
So hang on for your life
Just hang on one more night
Just hang on one more night
Just hang on one more night

You try to find the path
That will ease your pain
But the pain will never go away
And now it seems as though
All the hope is gone
You try to leave you can't move on

As your life runs by your eyes
You hear a voice from the other side

Fight for your life 
For your right
Are you afraid to die 
Is there fear deep inside
Just hang on one more night
I'll be there by your side
There's no hope in suicide
So hang on for your life
Just hang on one more night
Just hang on one more night
Just hang on one more night

But when the tears begin to flow
Weakness closes in
You feel your life is broken
You don't know if the fear will end
You don't have to be alone
'Cause there's another way
To wipe away your tears and carry on another day

When the tears begin to flow
And weakness closes in
You feel your life is broken
You don't know if the fear will end
You don't have to be alone
'Cause there's another way
To wipe away your tears and carry on another day

Just reach out your hand
I'll be there for you
I'll be by your side 
I'll fight for your life

Just reach out your hand
I'll be there for you
I'll be by your side 
I'll fight for your life

I'll Fight for your life 
For your right
Don't be afraid 'cause
I'll wipe the tears from your eyes
Just hang on one more night
I'll be there by your side
There's no hope in suicide
So hang on for your life
Just hang on one more night
Just hang on one more night
Just hang on one more night
