		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm longing for some space 
I'm longing for the place 
I'm longing for the days
Where you start listening to me 

Sometimes I cry 
Sometimes I hide 
Sometimes I buy a holiday 
In seven heavenly skies 

You think you're free 
But the breed has got you 
You think you're free 
But the need has got you 
You think you need the breed of greed
You rule my world 
With the breed that's got you 

[Chorus:]
Heaven is a place I long to go 
Has a face when I see you 
Is a hell in seven skies 
Tell me truth not holy lies 

Show me the world of peace 
Show me what I can't see 
Show me that place and face your 
Breed of greed 

My mind is shaded blue, 
I don't know what to do
Shall I just leave or is there 
Anything left to do 

You think you're free 
But the breed has got you 
You think you're free 
But the need has got you 
You think you need the breed of greed
You rule my world 
With the breed that's got you 

[Chorus:]

I'm longing for some space 
I'm longing for the place 
I'm longing for the days
Where you start listening to me
