		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So you're new to this block
Welcome to the ride of your life
Just keep away and your
Life will be pleasant, you'll find
Some secrets are best let go
So stop knocking on my damn front door
I'll find you and I'll kick
You out of sight for you see
As much as I look like I've
Got stuff left for you
My house is not a place to steal all my clues
I know you're new here
But you should think twice
Before you come near
I'm smarter than your average neighbor, too
I don't care what you do

Don't step into my house
Because you can just tiptoe quiet as a mouse
Don't fool around

Hello! I'm your neighbor
Goodbye, I'll see you later
This place was not for you to look and see
Take it from me hello! You're in danger
Good riddance to your behavior
You may think I'm the devil
And I wish your lives in peril
Let me spell this out for you
I'm just your neighbor now get out

Where are you now? Play hide and seek
But I'll always find you out now get out
You're a nuisance to my plans
Now get out, now get out

So my house is huge, yeah
It's two-thousand feet high
This does not give you the
Right to provoke what's behind
I keep myself away
So there's no right reason for you to say
That a sneak peek of my building is defined
For you see
I've had more tremors than your
Soul needs to know
Your curiosity will make you my foe
My love was always there
Until some mad man gave me despair
Now please get off my lawn or I will show
Don't make me explode

Don't step into my house
Because you can just tiptoe quiet as a mouse
Don't fool around

Hello! I'm your neighbor
Goodbye, I'll see you later
This place was not for you to look and see
Take it from me hello! You're in danger
Good riddance to your behavior
You may think I'm the devil
And I wish your lives in peril
Let me spell this out for you
I'm just your neighbor now get out

Where are you now? Play hide and seek!
But I'll always find you out now get out
You're a nuisance to my plans now get out

You think I don't know where you are
My boy? You don't think I know?
My cameras are always watching
So you best keep your tushie prepared
I'm ready to knock some sense into you
Haven't you heard? Be kind to your neighbor
Read a damn book or something

La, la, la, la keep away, stay away
La, la, la, la
Take your head out of the clouds
La, la, la, la
You're getting closer to the door
You don't wanna know, just go
Don't go right down to the basement so low

So you've found it
Are you happy with yourself?
You nosy little f- i told you not to look
And you're scarred
I told you you wouldn't get far
Get out of my house

Hello! I'm your neighbor
Goodbye! I'll see you later
This place was not for you to look and see
Take it from me hello! You're in danger
Good riddance to your behavior
You may think I'm the devil
And I wish your lives in peril
Let me spell this out for you
I'm just your neighbor now get out

Where are you now? Play hide and seek!
But I'll always find you out now get out
You're a nuisance to my plans now get out

You're a nuisance to my plans
Get out of my house
