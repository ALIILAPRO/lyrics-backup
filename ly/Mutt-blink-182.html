		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He pauses shaving and he tells himself that he is the bomb
She has her curlers set, her credit cards are paying the funds
He's not that old, I've been told, a strong sexual goal
They go out every day, she goes every way, oh yeah
They don't even care at all

She's open, waiting for more
And I know he's only looking to score
And it is way too unhealthy
Often they've typically been starved for attention before

She smokes a dozen and he doesn't seem to notice the smell
He took the seat off his own bike because the way that it felt
He wants to bone, this I know, she is ready to blow
They go out every night, his pants are super-tight, oh yeah
They don't even care at all

She's open waiting for more (she's open for more)
And I know he's only looking to score (he's only looking to score)
And it is way too unhealthy
Often they've typically been starved for attention before

She's open, waiting for more
And I know he's only looking to score
And it is way too unhealthy
Often they've typically been starved for attention before
