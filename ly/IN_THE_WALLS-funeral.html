		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's something hidden in the walls
I can't get it to stop
Don't wanna get involved
I'm not helping at all
I can't get it to stop
Don't wanna get involved
I'm not helping at all

Take me out this endless hole
I don't wanna shoot a soul
Take me out this endless hole
I don't wanna shoot a soul

Wait, no, don't go less I say so
They know, covered so its case closed
Wait, no, I feel somebody may know
They know

There's something hidden in the walls
I can't get it to stop
Don't wanna get involved
I'm not helping at all
I can't get it to stop
Don't wanna get involved
I'm not helping at all

Take me out this endless hole
I don't wanna shoot a soul
Take me out this endless hole
I don't wanna shoot a soul

Take me out this endless hole
I don't wanna shoot a soul
Take me out this endless hole
I don't wanna shoot a soul
