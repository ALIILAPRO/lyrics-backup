		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you turn it up a bit more?
Thank you

Dance with me, shoulder to shoulder
Never in the world have two others been closer than us
Closer than us
Hold my hand under the table
It's not that I'm not proud in the company of strangers
It's just some things are for us

Lover, you know, when they ask me, I'll tell them
Won't be ashamed, no, I can't wait to tell them
Love her, I love her, I love her, I love her, I
See in her eyes that she's lost in the moment
Holding on tight and all that I know is
Love her, I love her, I love her, I love her, I

Dance with me, shoulder to shoulder
Never in the world have two others been closer than us
Closer than us
Hold my hand under the table
It's not that I'm not proud in the company of strangers
It's just some things are for us

Lover, you know, when they ask me, I'll tell them
Won't be ashamed, no, I can't wait to tell them
Love her, I love her, I love her, I love her, I
I see in her eyes that she's lost in the moment
Holding on tight and all that I know is
Love her, I love her, I love her, I love her, I

Lover, I love her, I love her, I love her
I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her
I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her
Lover, I love her, I love her, I love her
I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her
I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her
I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her
I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her
I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her

I don't want to control her
I don't want to change her
Or suffocate her, I just want to love her
I don't want to control her
I don't want to change her
Or suffocate her, I just want to

Lover, you know, when they ask me, I'll tell them
Won't be ashamed, no, I can't wait to tell them
Love her, I love her, I love her, I love her, I
