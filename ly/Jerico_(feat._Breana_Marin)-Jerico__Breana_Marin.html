		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You ain't ever been with a real one
Ya last nigga made you won't feel nothing
You aint ever gonna go heal none
Or have fun
If you hang on to a bad one
Nothing worse than a bad bitch
With some baggage
Cant move on cause some trust issues
Cause ya trust misused
Cause you trust this dude
And he Left you
At the air port
Barefoot
Trust misused
And I want you to
But I can't deal
With the dumb mind games
Can't go 5 days
"What hoes Im slayin"
Only hoe I'm slayin is you
And im not that nigga its true
Untill you block him
Untill you stop him
Im done with the games

The problem is you
The problem is you
And it's true
And I don't know what a sister been through
Yea true
But you got some shit you gotta get through
Yea true
Cause
I need a woman just like you
Nah
I need a woman who won't fight you
Yea
Problem with the last nigga
A woman who cant past niggas
I don't really know all I know
Is I want you
