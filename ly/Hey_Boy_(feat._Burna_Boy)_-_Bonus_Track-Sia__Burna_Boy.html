		  Hey boy
Whatcha got for me, whatcha got in store?
Hey boy
Damn you're so sexy, got me wanting more (yeah)

Not going to be single, not tonight
(You fi come closer, baby)
Am I going to be single all my life?
I want you to stop and come on by
(You fi come closer, baby)
'Cause you know what us single women like (oh)

Hey boy, won't you come, come around town?
Hey, hey boy (oh, tell me have you ever?)
Hey boy, better run, better run now
I say, "Hey boy" (oh)
Come and pull up, pull up, pull up
In your hoopty ride, ok boy (oh, tell me have you ever?)
Hey boy, better run, better run now
I say, "Hey boy" (hey boy)

Hey boy, when I get with you
My heart is satisfied, yeah
Oh yeah boy, when I get with you
All I need is one night (yeah)

Not going to be single, not tonight
(You fi come closer, baby)
Am I going to be single all my life?
I want you to stop and come on by
(You fi come closer, baby)
'Cause you know what us single women like (oh)
(You won't find no one to do you better, better)

Hey boy, won't you come, come around town?
Hey, hey boy (oh, tell me have you ever?)
Hey boy, better run, better run now
I say, "Hey boy" (oh)
Come and pull up, pull up, pull up
In your hoopty ride, ok boy (oh, tell me have you ever?)
Hey boy, better run, better run now
I say, "Hey boy" (hey boy, Oluwaburna ti de o)

Tell me, have you ever been with a bredda
Wey go take you through any weather?
Start drying up he make you wetter
So me ting set off
You won't find no one to do you better
You fi come closer, baby
Make I put you pon my roster, babe
Put me weapon inna your holster, babe
Your last lover was a joker, babe
Me beat it up like a drummer
When the music feel right with the vodka
Mix with tings you like, like my banana
Situation get hot like lava (oh)

Hey boy, won't you come, come around town?
Hey, hey boy (oh, tell me have you ever?)
Hey boy, better run, better run now
I say, "Hey boy" (oh, Oluwaburna ti de o)
Come and pull up, pull up, pull up
In your hoopty ride, ok boy (oh, tell me have you ever?)
Hey boy, better run, better run now
I say, "Hey boy" (oh, hey boy)
