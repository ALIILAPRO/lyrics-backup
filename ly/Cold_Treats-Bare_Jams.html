		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're all burnt up by the light of the morning sun
The condescending sound of the city buzz
Our feet don't leave the ground of the life we're flying through but,
We're living together, dreaming is better

So, stand still for a second
Just look around and listen
You give what you get and get what your given
Hold still for a moment,
If they're not gonna change,
Promise that we won't stay the same

It's just another daydream thinking about ice cream
Oh, it's just a lovely cold treat
Look behind the green screen, nothing quite as it seems
One more step and we fall to our feet

I said it's been like this for years
We're built to consume, I said this same old scene, this stale routine
Never have I ever had a strong plan B, oh
I said the dude that tried to find the time
To slip inside is running blind, blind, blind

I'm like, stand still for a second
Just look around and listen
You give what you get and get what you're given
Hold still for a moment, if they're not gonna change
Promise that we won't stay the same

It's just another daydream thinking about ice cream
Oh, it's just a lovely cold treat
Look behind the green screen, nothing's quite as it seems
One more step and we fall to our...

Can it make, does it make, will it make you shy?
If dropped straight in the deep end
Are you full, are you fat from the treats you're fed?
When you gonna make them your best friend?

It's just another daydream thinking about ice cream
It's just another daydream thinking about ice cream

Stand still for a second if they're not gonna change

It's just another daydream thinking about ice cream
Oh, it's just a lovely cold treat
Look behind the green screen, nothing's quite as it seems
One more step and we fall to our feet
