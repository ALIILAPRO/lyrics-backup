		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come unto me and you will feel perfection
Come unto me and dedicate
Come unto me, you'll never feel rejection
Come unto me and terminate

Remove your heart, it's only good for bleeding
Bleeding through your fragile skin
Remove your thought 'cause it's only for deceiving
Deceiving thoughts destroy within

Disappear like man was never here
Long live machine
The future supreme
Man overthrown
Spit out the bone

Plug into me, I guarantee devotion
Plug into me and dedicate
Plug into me and I'll save you from emotion
Plug into me and terminate

Accelerate, utopian solution
Finally cure the Earth of man
Exterminate, speeding up the evolution
Set on course a master plan

Reinvent the Earth inhabitants
Long live machine
The future supreme
Man overthrown
Spit out the bone

The flesh betrays the flesh
Your man has had his time
We lay him down to rest
Machine, the new divine

Stop breathing and dedicate to me (dedicate to me)
Stop dreaming and terminate for me (terminate for me)

All meaning you dedicate to me (dedicate to me)
All feelings you terminate for me

Disappear like man was never here
Long live machine
Our future supreme
Your man overthrown
Spit out the bone, yeah
