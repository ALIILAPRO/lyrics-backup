		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh, starry eyed (starry)
Oh, oh
Starry eyed

Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit me with lightning
Handle bars, and then I let go, let go for anyone
Take me in, and throw out my heart and get a new one

Next thing we're touching
You look at me it's like you hit me with lightning
Ah

Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And everybody glows
Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And my body goes
Whoa, oh, oh, ah, ah
Whoa, oh, oh, ah, ah
Whoa, oh, oh, ah, ah

So we burst into colors, colors and carousels
Fall head first like paper planes in playground games

Next thing we're touching
You look at me it's like you hit me with lightning
Ah

Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And everybody glows
Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And my body goes
Whoa, oh, oh, ah, ah
Whoa, oh, oh, ah, ah
Whoa, oh, oh, ah, ah

Next thing we're touching (oh whoa, whoa)
Next thing we're touching (and I let go)
Next thing we're touching (oh whoa, whoa)
Next thing we're touching (we come and go but we're not in love)
Next thing we're touching (oh whoa, whoa)
Next thing we're touching (we come and go but we're not in love)
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touching
Hit me with lightning

Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And everybody glows
Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And my body goes

Oh, everybody's starry eyed (everybody's starry eyed)
And everybody glows
Oh, everybody's starry eyed (oh, everybody, whoa-oh)
And my body goes (oh-ooh, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Whoa oh oh ah ah (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Whoa oh oh ah ah (whoa, where my body goes?)
Ah, oh, ooh-ooh
