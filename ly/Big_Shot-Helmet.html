		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Recapture his anger
He screams and yells he hates you

Your mind faded so fast
Just drunk bitching and rehash
I’m done acting surprised
It’s all bullshit and
Barefaced lies

Recapture his anger
He screams and yells he hates you
Catch phrases, disguises
He sells it all, you buy it

You think everybody loves you
But I know you’re an asshole


Recapture his anger
He screams and yells he hates you
Catch phrases, disguises
He sells it all, you buy it
Recapture his anger
He screams and yells he hates
