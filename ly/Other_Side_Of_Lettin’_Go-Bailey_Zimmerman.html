		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Weatherman said there's a storm rolling in
And I'm checking my phone wondering where she's been lately
I've been going crazy

My new nine to five is sitting outside
Not getting over her, ain't for lack of trying daily
I've been going crazy
Well, maybe that rain will wash away my pain

I bet she's stuck in Colorado
While I'm strung out, missing her
I bet she's out somewhere with the wind in her hair
While I'm stuck here where we were
I see them taillights of that Bronco
Every time I close my eyes
But I can't sleep 'cause I'm hung up on goodbye
She's on the run, chasing the sun and I'm all alone
Stuck on the other side of letting go

Put my life on pause, with all that I lost
Guess that's the cost of holding onto heartbreak
Damn straight

And I did everything that I knew to do
To get you gone but what's the use?
'Cause to tell the truth, it's driving me insane

That she's stuck in Colorado
While I'm strung out missing her
I bet she's out somewhere with the wind in her hair
While I'm stuck here where we were
I see them taillights of that Bronco
Every time I close my eyes
But I can't sleep 'cause I'm hung up on goodbye
She's on the run, chasing the sun and I'm all alone
Stuck on the other side of letting go

Ain't had a missed call, just another sunset
Counting every day ever since she left
With this five by seven laying on my chest, making it hard to forget

That she's stuck in Colorado
While I'm strung out missing her
I bet she's out somewhere with the wind in her hair
While I'm stuck here where we were
I see them taillights of that Bronco
Every time I close my eyes
But I can't sleep 'cause I'm hung up on goodbye
She's on the run, chasing the sun and I'm all alone
But that porch light's on if you ever wanna come back home
Back to the other side of letting go
