		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I took a walk with the gods
Flirted with the demons in my head
I got all I could want, but I can't find the meaning
No, oh-oh, oh-oh 
God, I need a new heaven
Thought I had a voice
But I'm choking on the feeling
Clawed my way to the top
But I still can't reach it
Oh-oh-oh, God, I need a new heaven

I'm losing my faith, and I can't be saved
Paid the price, wore the crown
Drank the holy water just to spit it out
The higher I reach, the less I believe
Said the prayer, took the vow
I did the time, now get me out
God, I need a new heaven

If I should die, before I wake
I need a new heaven for heaven's sake
If I should die, before I wake
I need a new heaven (for heaven's sake)

I put on a show, just to cover up who I am
And I just sold my soul, and it's not coming back
No, oh-oh, oh-oh 
God, I need a new heaven
My dreams became a curse wrapped around my neck
There's no signs of life, and it's too late to turn back
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh 
God, I need a new heaven

I'm losing my faith, and I can't be saved
Paid the price, wore the crown
Drank the holy water just to spit it out
The higher I reach, the less I believe
Said the prayer, took the vow
I did the time, now get me out
God, I need a new heaven

If I should die before I wake
I need a new heaven for heaven's sake
If I should die before I wake
I need a new heaven
(For heaven's sake)

(Be careful when you make a wish)
('Cause you just might get it)

I'm losing my faith, and I can't be saved
Paid the price, wore the crown
Drank the holy water, just to spit it out
The higher I reach, the less I believe
Said the prayer, took the vow
I did the time, now get me out

God, I need a new heaven (if I should die before I wake)
God, I need a new heaven (I need a new heaven for heaven's sake)
God, I need a new heaven (if I should die before I wake)
For heaven's sake
