		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Scars on my feet from the eggshells
But why would you care?
You took all the space on the bookshelf
And all of the air

Baby, it's your turn every time
And honestly that's fine
And there's nothing to forgive
I'm just out of fucks to give (oh)
Hmm-mmm-mmh

Daddy's a psycho (hmm-mmm-mmh)
So give me a break (so give me a break)
And mama's an angel
I guess that's what it takes (guess that's what it takes)
But I don't think that I can be like that for you
And I care, boy, you know that I do

But daddy's a psycho
And I think you are too

You got a way of distorting the story
And warping the truth
I could be literally perfect
But I'd still be sorry whatever I do

'Cause, baby, it's your turn every time
And honestly that's fine
And there's nothing to forgive
I'm just out of fucks to give (oh)
Hmm-mmm-mmh

Daddy's a psycho (hmm-mmm-mmh)
So give me a break (so give me a break)
And mama's an angel
I guess that's what it takes (guess that's what it takes)
But I don't think that I can be like that for you
And I care, boy, you know that I do

But daddy's a psycho
And I think you are too

You know I was always on your side
Oh, baby, don't say I never tried
And all this pity rings a bell
I just know this shit too well, oh

Daddy's a psycho (hmm-mmm-mmh)
So give me a break (so give me a break)
And mama's an angel
I guess that's what it takes (guess that's what it takes)
But I don't think that I can be like that for you
And I care, boy, you know that I do

But daddy's a psycho
And I think you are too
