		  (Oh-oho-oho, ohh-oh-oho)
(Oh-oho-oho, ohh-oh-oho)

It's not worth the mention
The way I feel
Oh, I just kinda hope it wasn't real
Starting the engine
Every single day, hah
But everywhere I go I couldn't stay (oh-oho-oho)
It's just a day dream
It's not what it seems
Intoxicating, hallucinating (oh-oho-oho)
I keep on changing 
To make a statement
I gotta go
(I gotta go, I gotta go)

You know I'll be on my way-ay-ay-ay to you
I wanna feel like I'm supposed to
Sending shivers down my spine
I'm on my back, you're on my mind
Get away-ay-ay in the morning blue
But I can't get over you
(Oh-oho-oho, ohh-oh-oho)
(But I can't get over you)
(Oh-oho-oho, ohh-oh-oho)

I can feel the tension
Running through my veins
Oh, I been feeding myself to the flame
If I pay close attention
I can make it last
But I can't form a thought inside my head
Too much at stake here
I cannot stay here
I gotta go
(I gotta go, I gotta go)

You know I'll be on my way-ay-ay-ay to you
I wanna feel like I'm supposed to
Sending shivers down my spine
I'm on my back, you're on my mind
Get away-ay-ay in the morning blue
But I can't get over you
(Oh-oho-oho, ohh-oh-oho)
(Oh-oho-oho, ohh-oh-oho)
But I can't get over you
(Oh-oho-oho, ohh-oh-oho)
(Oh-oho-oho, ohh-oh-oho)

Oh, we have come so far but couldn't reach the stars
Oh no, we're still too far, too far away
Oh, we have come so far but couldn't reach the stars
Oh no, we're still too far

I'll be on my way-ay-ay-ay to you
I wanna feel like I'm supposed to
Sending shivers down my spine
I'm on my back, you're on my mind
Get away-ay-ay, you get away-ay-ay in the morning blue
(Oh-oho-oho, ohh-oh-oho)
(Oh-oho-oho, ohh-oh-oho)
But I can't get over you
(Oh-oho-oho, ohh-oh-oho)
(But I can't get over you)
(Oh-oho-oho, ohh-oh-oho)
But I can't get over you

(Oh-oho-oho, ohh-oh-oho) Oh, we have come so far but couldn't reach the stars
(Oh-oho-oho, ohh-oh-oho) Oh no, we're still too far, too far away
(Oh-oho-oho, ohh-oh-oho) Oh, we have come so far but couldn't reach the stars
(Oh-oho-oho, ohh-oh-oho) Oh no, we're still too far

Too far away-ay-ay-ay, ay-ay
Too far away-ay-ay-ay, ay-ay
