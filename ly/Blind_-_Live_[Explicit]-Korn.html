		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you ready?

This place inside my mind, a place I like to hide
You don't know the chances, what if I should die?
A place inside my brain, another kind of pain
You don't know the chances, I'm so blind
Blind, blind

Another place I find to escape the pain inside
You don't know the chances, what if I should die?
A place inside my brain, another kind of pain
You don't know the chances, I'm so blind
Blind, blind

Deeper, and deeper, and deeper
As I journey to live a life that seems to be
A lost reality
That can never find a way to reach my inner

Self-esteem is low, how deep can I go
In the ground that I lay if I don't find a way to
See through the gray that clouds my mind
This time I look to see what's between the lines

I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind

I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind

I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind

I'm blind
I'm blind
I'm blind
I'm blind
