		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wait
Wait, wait, wait, yeah
Wake up every day
Lord, please guide my way
I'm so grateful (yeah)

I can't wait for September
'Cause that means that next month, it's goin' down like timber
You're too down with the gangy, you're one of my members
She gotta represent for the guys now
They gotta see a part of me in her (yeah)
Red flag, blue flag, green flag, and a white flag to surrender (yeah)
My ex girl was a head case, I cannot defend her

You're too down with the gangy, you're one of my members
They see you comin' 'round in the realest way
Now them hoes gettin' friendlier
You're too down with the
You're too down with the gangy, with the gangy
With the, what? With the gangy
You're too down with the members
You're too down for the O, girl, fuck November, December

Ask them other guys in the city what happened
L-O-L gang, we the last ones laughin'
Are you jackin' them or jackin' us?
When you ride around the 6ix, girl
Are you slappin' them or slappin' us?
I know the answer
I'll take you farther than Mexico (yeah, yeah)
You still got niggas hard pressed on you though (yeah)
I know you, shorty a ten, but not the messy ho (yeah)
You standin' tall like the star-spangled
I'll give you my all if you're ready for it
Hop off the block if you're Jenny for me (yeah)
Hop off the yacht with the Henny for me (gangsta, gangsta, gangsta)
You know the airport is callin' our name
You know the Clearport is callin' our name
I'll take you farther than Biscayne, my girl (woo, gangsta, gangsta, yeah)

You're too down with the gangy, you're one of my members (yeah)
They see you comin' 'round in the realest way
Now them hoes gettin' friendlier
You're too down with the
You're too down with the gangy, with the gangy
With the, what? With the gangy
You're too down with the members
You're too down for the O, girl, fuck November, December

You're too down for the O, girl, the O, girl
Going deeper inside, my feelings can't subside
These walls are so thin, you gon' wake up the whole eastside, girl
Feel like I'm bi 'cause you're one of the guys, girl
All jokes aside, you gon' wake up the whole eastside
Wake up the whole eastside
Comin' from Jahron B side
On the road, goin' eighty
I live like forty minutes from you, that sex drive is crazy
You used to jack the other side, but that shit doesn't phase me
Not at all
Those guys were never gangy, those guys are in a strange place
Say you started datin' girls now, say it to me with a straight face
Oh, now it's girls
I wanna know all of your kinks
I wanna touch more money than Brinks
I bet I could change how you think
I know, I know I could have us both
Both cummin' at the same time like, "Jinx," I'm talkin' dirty
Time to arch that back and put both hands down like 6:30
N-Y-see me later when I'm right there like New Jersey
All your friends keep judgin' us, it's like you're my attorney
