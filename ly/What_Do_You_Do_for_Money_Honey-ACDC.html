		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're working in bars
Riding in cars
Never gonna give it for free
Your apartment with a view
On the finest avenue
Looking at your beat on the street
You're always pushing, shoving
Satisfied with nothing
You bitch, you must be getting old

So stop your love on the road
All your digging for gold
You make me wonder
Yes I wonder, I wonder

Honey, whaddya do for money
Honey, whaddya do for money
Where you get your kicks

You're loving on the take
And you're always on the make
Squeezing all the blood out of men
They're all standing in a queue
Just to spend the night with you
It's business as usual again
You're always grabbin', stabbin'
Trying to get it back in
But girl you must be getting slow

So stop your love on the road
All your digging for gold
You make me wonder
Yes I wonder, yes I wonder

Honey, whaddya do for money
Honey, whaddya do for money
Yeah, whaddya do for money honey, how you get your kicks
Whaddya do for money honey, how you get your licks
Go

Yeow
Honey, whaddya do for money
I said, Honey, whaddya do for money
Oh ho honey
Oh honey
Whaddya do for money
What you gonna do
Honey
Oh yeah honey
Whaddya do for money
What you gonna do
Oh, what you gonna do
