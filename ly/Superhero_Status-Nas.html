		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a shame, the way it's goin' down
I'm on the sideline while he's playing around

The difference between you and I spittin's a wide difference
They hate on you, but me, they want me to die different
No ego, I'm just providing
A better understanding, I don't wish it on nobody
Who doesn't have the bandwidth
It come with standin' your ground
When you from a poor town, that generate awareness
The ventilation shifts where the air is erased when you hear it
Somewhere between great and endearing
You smell it and taste it, 'cause it's serious
And you don't think it's fair, you feel like you come with bars
And you won some wars
Frankly, they should send they regards
Some of the hardest rappers get overlooked and ignored
No matter what happen, I hope all of us soar, I go

Superhero status, no masks, no gadgets
Send them villains at us, we ain't scared of action
We ain't characters cappin'
Ability to leap buildings, if you blink, you won't catch it
(Audio) Dope, (audio) dope, (audio) dope, (audio) dope
It's a sh-
It's a shame, the 

Always on time, I'm never petty, yeah, I'm always ready
That's why my shit flows smooth and steady, pictures on Getty
I don't complain, I don't blame, know when my time is done
I move to the side
I don't want nothing to prove to these guys, if y'all was moving like Nas
Y'all wouldn't assume someone owe you
Nobody know you when you old 'cept your peoples
That should keep you peaceful, instead
Delusional mood illusions refusin' to see truth
Your personal hurt, you unleash on the first
Person you come across doing your evil work
Damn
It's a sh-
It's a shame
It's a shame, the 
Slugs, blood, laugh, hugs, survive if you could
Downsize, intro the thugs to the plug, and just today
I noticed a different pain
Man, catch me, don't let me slip in no demented stage

Repetitive Beat Street watcher, a gatekeeper, conqueror
Late night creep sponsor
Need a frequent flyer, beyond, think I'm a sheikh
She don't need to fly to Dubai for it
Fleet of cars, she under my arm, and she honored with' it
Cognizant correspondence, I don't respond to nonsense
Adidas shells, I keep a reefer smell on me
Ringin' the Wall Street bell at 9:30 AM Is my coffee
My gang is New York Stock Exchange
Here's my costume change

Superhero status, no masks, no gadgets
Send them villains at us, we ain't scared of action
We ain't characters cappin'
Ability to leap buildings, if you blink, you won't catch it
(Audio) Dope, (audio) dope, (audio) dope, (audio) dope

It's a sh-
It's a shame, the 
It's a shame, the way it's goin' down
I'm on the sideline while he's playing around
