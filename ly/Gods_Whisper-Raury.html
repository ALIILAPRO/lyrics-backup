		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I won't compromise
I won't live a life
On my knees
You think I am nothing
I am nothing
You've got something coming
Something coming because

I hear God's whisper
Calling my name
It's in the wind
I am the savior
(Sing it again!)
Savior
Savior
(I can't hear you! What?)
Savior (What?)
Savior

We are indigos
(Savior, savior)
Living lives we chose
(Savior, savior)
Show you're brave
Those will faith
(Savior, savior)
On a mission
Led by intuition
You should listen because

I hear God's whisper
Calling my name
It's in the wind
I am the savior
I hear God's whisper
Calling my name
It's in the wind
I am the savior
We are the saviors!

I hear God's Whisper
Calling my name
We are the saviors!
It's in the wind
I am the savior
We are the saviors!

I hear God's Whisper
Calling my name
We are the saviors!
It's in the wind
I am the savior
We are the saviors!

Savior, (we are the saviors!) savior
Savior, (we are the saviors!) savior
Savior, (we are the saviors!) savior
Savior
