		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's cold around me, the night is young
The sun has fallen
And I've become the lonely one
The moon is dancing among the clouds

And my knees are shaking
And my dreams are braking
But I know I live
But I know I live, today

I know we could live tomorrow
(Live tomorrow)
But I know I live today,
I know we could live tomorrow
But I don't think we should wait! 
No

I know we could live tomorrow
But I know I live today,
I know we could live tomorrow
But I don't think we should wait! 
No

I know we could

Taking my life in my hands!
(The power who has it?)
Taking my life in my hands!
(The power who has it?)

I don't like to wait! 
No, no
It's happening, It's happening
I don't like to wait! 
No, no
It's happening

I know we could live tomorrow
But I know I live today,
I know we could live tomorrow
But I don't think we should wait! 
No

I know we could live tomorrow
But I know I live today,
I know we could live tomorrow
But I don't think we should wait! 
No

I know we could live tomorrow
(Live tomorrow)
But I know I live today
(I live today)
I know we could live tomorrow
(live tomorrow)
But I don't think we should wait! 
No
(I live today)

I know we could live tomorrow
(Live tomorrow)
But I know I live today
I know we could live tomorrow
But I don't think we should wait!
No
