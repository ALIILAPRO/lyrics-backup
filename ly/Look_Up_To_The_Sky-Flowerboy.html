		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look up to the sky
Look up to the sky
Should I come to your place? Come to mine
I pretend like I'm not just as lost as you
I ain't pay no attention paid a price
Can't believe all the promises I'm running through
Run away but there's no where left to hide
Feel small when you look up to the sky
Think about you tears fall out my eye
(Yeah, yeah yeah)
If I could go back I'd play it right
Look up to the sky
Look up to the sky
Look up to the sky
Look up to the sky
Look up to the sky
Look up to the sky
Yeah, I'm seeing colors in my mind
My love is cherry and my body blue
I wake up pissed off every night
I forgot my balance and a part of you
Run away but there's no where left to hide
Feel small when you look up to the sky
Think about you tears fall out my eye
(Yeah, yeah yeah)
If I could go back I'd play it right
Look up to the sky
Look up to the sky
Look up to the sky
Look up to the sky
Look up to the sky
Look up to the sky
