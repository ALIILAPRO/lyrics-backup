		  Fish in the Sea

Come all you young sailor men, listen to me
I'l sing you a song of the fish in the sea

And it's
Windy weather, boys, stormy weather, boys
When the wind blows, we're all together, boys
Blow ye winds westerly, blow ye winds, blow
Jolly southwester, boys, steady she goes

Up jumps the eel with his slippery tail
Climbs up aloft and reefs the topsail

And it's
Windy weather, boys, stormy weather, boys
When the wind blows, we're all together, boys
Blow ye winds westerly, blow ye winds, blow
Jolly southwester, boys, steady she goes

Then up jumps the shark with his nine rows of teeth
Saying, You eat the dough boys, and I'll eat the beef

And it's
Windy weather, boys, stormy weather, boys
When the wind blows, we're all together, boys
Blow ye winds westerly, blow ye winds, blow
Jolly sou'wester, boys, steady she goes

Up jumps the whale., the largest of all
If you want any wind, well, I'll blow ye a squall

And it's
Windy weather, boys, stormy weather, boys
When the wind blows, we're all together, boys
Blow ye winds westerly, blow ye winds, blow
Jolly sou'wester, boys, steady she goes

And it's
Windy weather, boys, stormy weather, boys
When the wind blows, we're all together, boys
Blow ye winds westerly, blow ye winds, blow
Jolly sou'wester, boys, steady she goes

And it's
Windy weather, boys, stormy weather, boys
When the wind blows, we're all together, boys
Blow ye winds westerly, blow ye winds, blow
Jolly sou'wester, boys, steady she goes
