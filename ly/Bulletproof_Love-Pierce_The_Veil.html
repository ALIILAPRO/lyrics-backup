		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I breathe you in with smoke in the backyard lights
(Backyard light)
We used to laugh until we choked into the wasted nights
(Wasted nights)
It was the best time of my life, but now I sleep alone
(Sleep alone)
So darling, don't, don't wake me up, 'cause my thrill is gone
(Say I'm wrong)
In the sunset turning red behind the smoke
Forever and alone
Yeah!

You've gone and sewn me to this bed, the taste of you and me
(You and me)
Will never leave my lips again under the blinding rain
(Blinding rain)
I wanna hold your hand so tight I'm gonna break my wrist
(Break my wrist)
And when the vultures sing tonight I'm gonna join right in

I'll sing along, oh
'Cause I don't know any other song
I'll sing along
But I'm barely hanging on
No, I'm barely hanging on
By the time you're hearing this I'll already be gone
And now there's nothing to do but scream at the drunken moon

This isn't fair!
(No!)
Don't you try to blame this on me
(Ohhh)
My love for you was bulletproof but you're the one who shot me
And God damn it, I can barely say your name
So I'll try to write and fill the pen with blood from the sink
Woah oh, oh oh
But don't just say it, you should sing my name
Pretend that it's a song 'cause forever it's yours
And we can sing this on the way home

I'll sing along
(Oh)
'Cause I don't know any other song
(Oh oh)
I'll sing along
But I'm barely hanging on
No, I'm barely hanging on
By the time you're hearing this I'll already be gone
And now there's nothing to do but tear my voice apart
Nothing to do
And scream at the drunken moon
