		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I Really gotta warn you
Before it gets too late
This boy from California
Loves to run away
And It ain't nothing personal
Not something you can change
Maybe in a few loves
He'll learn but not today so

Leave before you miss me
Do what you gotta do
'Cause if you try to fix me
You'll be fixing you

No, no, don't make that choice
Don't fall in love with a broken boy
You'll never fill that void
Don't play, don't play with a broken toy
Hurt people hurt people and
Trust me I'm no exception
No, no, don't make that choice
Don't fall in love
fall in love with a broken boy
You'll just get hurt
With a broken boy
You'll just get hurt

I really wanna hold ya
But I'll push you away
If you get any closer
You'll just get closer to the pain so

Leave before you miss me
Do what you gotta do
'Cause if you try to fix me
You'll be fixing you

No, no, don't make that choice
Don't fall in love with a broken boy
You'll never fill that void
Don't play, don't play with a broken toy
Hurt people hurt people and
Trust me, I'm no exception
No, no, don't make that choice
Don't fall in love
fall in love with a broken boy
You'll just get hurt
With a broken boy
You'll just get hurt
With a broken boy
You'll just get hurt
With a broken boy
You'll just get hurt

Leave before you miss me
Do what you gotta do
'Cause if you try to fix me
You'll be fixing you
