		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was on the outside looking in
Now I'm on the inside trying to stay
Out of my head
I need peace of mind

Grew up pretty fast
Good things never last
You gotta live before you learn
Now I'm somewhere far
Away from where I started
With no point of return
But I'm turning

I was on the outside looking in
Now I'm on the inside trying to stay
Out of my head
I need peace of mind

Landed in the middle of somewhere
With you
Now you're stranded in the middle of somewhere, oh yeah
Too

Always runnin' away
Looking for an escape
Everyone is an alien
When you're tryin' to find your place (tryin' to find your place)

Trying to stay out
Trying to stay out of my head
Trying to stay out
