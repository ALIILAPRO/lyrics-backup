		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (All of this pussy the devil six, six, six
All of this pussy the devil
All of this cash the devil
All of this cash the devil, the devil
The devil all of this lean is the devil
All of this pussy the devil)

All of this pussy the devil
All of this cash is the devil
All of this ash is the devil
All of these pills is the devil
All of this lean is the devil
I won't go to heaven, nah
I won't go to heaven, nah
I won't go to heaven, nah
I won't go to heaven, nah
I won't go to heaven, nah

Bitch, I be that broke boy
Two scripts half-full make a full script
Mean I'm runnin' out bitch, I be a ho toy
Making two bad bitches bashful
Comin' out they nutshell, pass me the rag
Fool bitch, I be that dope boy
Smoke cash, ash snowin' on the broke glass
Throat slashed, now I got a blood-soaked rash
Go bash in a fuck boy's
Skull, wearin' no mask, toe tag
Make the rope last, don't ask
Uh, al-all of my vices the devil
Fuck all this nice shit
I meddle in murderous temptation
Roll up the windows and push down the pedal
Burn a cigarette in my wrist
That 7th Ward shit fuck a bitch, then dip
No tint, gas tank on E
'64 Impala at the bottom of a cliff, bitch

All this heroin is the devil
All these Xanax is the devil
All of these murders the devil
All of these hoes is the devil
Bitch, I am the devil, the devil
And I can't go to heaven, nah
I can't go to heaven, nah
I can't go to heaven, nah
I can't go to heaven, nah
I can't go to heaven, nah

K-Keeping it packin' with a hunnid rounds
Keep them dead bodies all on the ground
Posted in Memphis, at Orange Mound
TA rollin' the loud when we come around
Smokin' and drinkin', I ain't never thinking
Poppin' them pills 'til I'm under the cement
Six hundred sixty-six, smokin' that reefer
If you looking for dope, ho
I got it for cheaper
New Orleans crypt keeper, the killer
The creeper believe me that demons are real
Once you see us fuckboys wanna be us
The ho's wanna please us
Ask in yo' city, they'll tell you I'm Jesus
The motherfucking Antichrist
$uicide, we anti-life

Bitch, don't make me tell you twice
That I can't go to heaven, nah
