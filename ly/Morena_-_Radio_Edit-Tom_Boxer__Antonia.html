		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I said Morena, Morena, Morena I give you my love
I said Morena, Morena, Morena I give you my love
I said Morena, Morena, Morena I give you my love
I said Morena, Morena, Morena I give you my love

Why, oh why, you don't love me and you say goodbye
If you leave me I will make you cry
Boy you set my heart on fire
Why, oh why, you don't love me and you say goodbye
If you leave me I will make you cry
Boy you set my heart on fire, take me higher

I said Morena, Morena, Morena I give you my love
I said Morena, Morena, Morena I give you my love
I said Morena, Morena, Morena I give you my love
I said Morena, Morena, Morena I give you my love

Why, oh why, you don't love me and you say goodbye
If you leave me I will make you cry
Boy you set my heart on fire
Why, oh why, you don't love me and you say goodbye
If you leave me I will make you cry
Boy you set my heart on fire, take me higher

I said Morena, Morena, Morena I give you my love
I said Morena, Morena, Morena I give you my love
I said Morena, Morena, Morena I give you my love
I said Morena, Morena, Morena I give you my love

I said Morena, Morena, Morena I give you my love
