		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna love
I'm gonna take what you're givin'
'Cause I know you're willing
To take me all the way
You got me right here, impossible
And I can't wait to finally explode

The big, big bang
The reason I'm alive
When all the stars collide, in this universe inside
The big, big bang
The big, big bang
The big, big bang

Some people like to talk
But I'm into doing
What I feel like doing
When I'm inspired
So if we had a walk down
It would be so nice
I bet that we could light up the sky

The big, big bang
The reason I'm alive
When all the stars collide, in this universe inside
The big, big bang
The big, big bang
The big, big bang

Take it from me I don't wanna be so mummified
Sometimes I feel so isolated
I wanna die
And I'll take it from you if you got it
Every time, so baby bring your body here
Next to mine, next to mine
When I don't want a thing
I just want to live it
So baby, let's just not miss this state

The big, big bang
The reason I'm alive
When all the stars collide, in this universe inside
The big, big bang
The big, big bang
The big, big bang
