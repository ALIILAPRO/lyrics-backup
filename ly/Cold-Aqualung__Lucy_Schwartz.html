		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  God and his priests and his kings
All were waiting
All will wait
As they go over

Held between heaven and hell
As they're dancing
As they dance
Over and over
Over

Cold
Cold

Crimson and bare as I stand
Yours completely
Yours
As we go over

Sing for the lion and lamb
Their hearts a-hunting
Still hearts hold
Ever and ever
Ever

Cold
Cold

God and his priests and his kings
Turn their faces
Even they feel the
Cold

What you are giving
Can't be forgotten
And never forsaken

What you are giving
Can't be forgotten
And never forsaken

What you are giving
Can't be forgotten
And never forsaken

Cold
