		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I might look a bit older now
But I'm still the same kid I've always been
Changed the color of my hair
But I still need you like I always did
My friends just finished college
And they're moving to the city where I live
So you might have to see me less
But it's nice to have somebody to miss

I'm so looking forward to vacation
Let's make up for everything I've missed

Ooh
I'm so sorry for the things I do
I hope it doesn't hurt your heart, it's true
Go rest your mind 'cause I still need you too

You love those old photographs
That I swear you've shown me a thousand times
And usually I fake a laugh
While you're tryin' your hardest not to cry
We'll go walk the dogs at Winslow Park
'Cause Westport's perfect in the spring
And I'll swallow my pride and try
To tell you just how hard it's really been

Ooh
I'm so sorry for the things I do
I hope it doesn't hurt your heart, it's true
Go rest your mind 'cause I still need you too
Hey
There's nowhere else I'd rather spend my day
I love you, I know sometimes I don't say
'Cause I know everything will be okay
Be okay

You keep calling just to say you miss me
Never know what I'm supposed to say
I'm so sick and tired of the city
I need an excuse to get away
Can't believe it's already September
Summer wasn't easy to enjoy
Don't think I can make it to November
I just really need to hear your voice

Ooh
I'm so sorry for the things I do
I hope it doesn't hurt your heart, it's true
Go rest your mind 'cause I still need you too
I still need you too
Hey
There's nowhere else I'd rather spend my day
I love you, I know sometimes I don't say
'Cause I know everything will be okay
Be okay
