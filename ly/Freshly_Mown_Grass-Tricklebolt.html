		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was spring time
World was turning green
I was talkin with daddy
Doin the midnight dogwalk
I had a cold 
Had spended days lowering my resistance
I could barely smell a thing
Untill my soul started to sing

Fresh mown grass
Its the smell that i love best
Fresh mown grass
Its the smell that i love best

It was september
The late summerwarmth makin me slow
I was walking with johnny
Doing the left wing bigtalk
He reached for his pocket
Ofcourse he had brought something sweet
His summertime gardening thing
Was gonna make my soul sing

Fresh mown grass
Its the smell that i love best
Fresh mown grass
Its the smell that i love best
