		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Coiled forever in the darkness below
They await for the right time to strike
Defending the truth and protecting the lies
Reptilian, shedding their skin
They gather in masses, encrypting the stars
To breed slaves sworn to war
The thrashing and bashing and blistering burns
Death brought forth to the world

Serpent's eyes
Always watching you
Without a trace
The covenant of the snake
Succumbing unto your fate
They've been watching you
Through shape-shift eyes
In sumerian disguise
By the gods who decree our faith
By the gods who decree our faith

De-luvium religions of monarchs and gods
The hideous hydra takes shape
The bloodline descendants of its original form
The dragon of Egypt awakes
They've taken the tablets and hidden the scrolls
To deceive the ones they protect
The truth of creation, mutation of man
Entombed in the Vatican walls

Serpent's eyes
Always watching you
Without a trace
The covenant of the snake
Succumbing unto your fate
They've been watching you
Through shape-shift eyes
In sumerian disguise
By the gods who decree our faith

By the gods who decree our fate
By the gods who decree our fate
By the gods who decree our faith

Now!
We are the ones who dominate (who dominate)
Five thousand years silent control (silent control)
Societies to subjugate (to subjugate)
Eternity complete control (complete control)
The brotherhood of the snake (of the snake)
And we will always assume control!
