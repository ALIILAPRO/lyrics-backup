		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Full the moon and midnight sky
Through the dark they ride
Warriors of forever will sacrifice the night

One for all and all for one
The future time has come
Faces filled with torment
Your heart beats like a drum

Never will you look back again
You'll fight on 'til the end
Together we will live on
Forever more

In this land we have defended from all things dark and cruel
Now we are defenseless in a land where dragons rule

In this land we have defended from all things dark and cruel
Now we are defenseless in a land where dragons rule

Flash of steel in the mid-day sun
The battle has begun
Blood spills all around us but still we carry on

No mercy we will show to them
The white flag shall be raised
We'll fight for our freedom
Ride towards this evil place

We all stand until the end allegiance to this game
In this land we've defended from all things dark and cruel
Now we're defenseless in a land where dragons rule

In this land we've defended from all things dark and cruel
Now we're defenseless in a land where dragons rule

Sun set in the western sky
The battle's almost done
The victory will be glorious
Our enemies are gone
