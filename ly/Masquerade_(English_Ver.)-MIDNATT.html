		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So go on and leave me
'Cause I don't think I need ya (mm-mm)
Everything's an illusion
Won't look back and I mean it (mm-mm)

Yeah, we can keep up the role play
I don't care what the rules say
Making up things that push me away
Yeah, fire burned up and twisted
Love that never existed
I don't got any reason to stay

Masquerade
Danger in what we're doin'
It's all over and done
I don't know who we're foolin'
So turn around and hate me
I'm bending 'til I'm breaking
I love it, love it, love it too much (too much)

Masquerade (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Masquerade (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Please look at me and tell me
Just tell me you don't want me
I love it, love it, love it too much (too much)
Masquerade

The pain, the hurt, the scars
The fear, the tears we hide
Your love is in my veins
Lost in this toxic maze
I'll drink your love poison

I'ma give you a warning
Don't come any closer (mm-mm)
We're doin' a bad thing
We're gonna hurt 'til it's over (mm-mm)

Yeah, pushing all of the limits
Crave you like it's forbidden
Touching you feels like playing with flames
Yeah, pushing all of the limits
Go against what's permitted
Touching you feels like playing with flames

Masquerade
Danger in what we're doin
It's all over and done
I don't know who we're foolin'
So turn around and hate me
I'm bending 'til I'm breaking
I love it, love it, love it too much

Masquerade (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Masquerade (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Please look at me and tell me
Just tell me you don't want me
I love it, love it, love it too much (too much)

Masquerade (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Masquerade (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
When there's nothing to begin with
You'll never find the ending
I love it, love it, love it too much
