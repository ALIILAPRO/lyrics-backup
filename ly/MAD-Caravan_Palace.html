		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I turn on the engine, better be on clock
I bumped into Jane looking tired, like a zombie 
Cause she grinded all the weekend
'Til she dived, overdrive
May believe I'm a loser but I don't mind 
(I go)

cin't nobody and ain't no right
Go away, bang bang
(I bet you)
cin't nobody and ain't no right
Go away, bang bang bang

I had a Top Dog Story, late last night
End of my shift, ready to down a pint 
But the boss says, "Hold, no time to spare"
The party's poppin', but he just don't care
(I go)

cin't nobody and ain't no right
Go away, bang bang
(I bet you)
cin't nobody and ain't no right
Go away, bang bang bang

I was cool in the kitchen when the tyrant knocks
Sir step brother came, ominous and preachy he's
Naggin' bout my livin, satisfied all the time
(Please)
Go away, bang bang bang

I gotta tell you baby (ain't no right)
None of my biz but you (ain't no right)
I'm Just Sayin' but you (ain't no right)
(Please)
Go away, bang bang bang
