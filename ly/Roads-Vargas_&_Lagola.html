		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Call on me in my darkest hour
Now when love is all around me
I think heaven let you find me
If it matters to go
Call on me whenever you need me
Don't hold back, I never said it'd be easy
I can feel the wind is blowing
Blowing louder than before

But I never forget
Yes you know that I would never forget

I wanna turn back time and
Go back to the days
When there was no doubt in my mind
Baby do you believe me
Never said it'd be easy
Letting go of your heart
I wanna push rewind and
Go back to the days
When you were the best that I had
Baby do you believe me
Never said it'd be easy
Letting go of your heart

In my arms I can feel it comin'
Down this road, I'm always losing something
You're my California dreamin'
You're my ever-lasting love
Good old me, singing hallelujah
I find a way to make 'em pretty for ya'
I can feel the wind is changing
Changing faster than before

But I never forget
You should know that I would never forget

I wanna turn back time and
Go back to the days
When there was no doubt in my mind
Baby do you believe me
Never said it'd be easy
Letting go of your heart
I wanna push rewind and
Go back to the days
When you were the best that I had
Baby do you believe me
Never said it'd be easy
Letting go of your heart

Even though I tried
True days in your eyes
They don't ever lie
Hope I make it back in time
I know I'm asking for much
Oh, I can't deny
True days in your eyes
They don't ever lie
Hope I make it back in time
I know I'm asking for much
I know I'm asking for much

I wanna turn back time and
Go back to the days
When there was no doubt in my mind
Baby do you believe me
Never said it'd be easy
Letting go of your heart
I wanna push rewind and
Go back to the days
When you were the best that I had
Baby do you believe me
Never said it'd be easy
Letting go of you heart
