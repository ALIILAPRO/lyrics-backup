		  Huh?
Dem mad (Rehum)

All that verbal on the Net, you dey scare who? (Huh?)
Hey, boss man, me, I no dey fear you (you mad)
You dey use your boy hotspot dey tweet (huh?)
I can't wait 'til I buck you and your peeps (boom, boom, boom)
That girl fine like Kelly pon my TikTok
Can you make it shake? Baby, make it tick-tock
Back a rotate, jumping like it's Kris Kross 
You dey make a nigga spaz like Rick Ros, huh (mad)

Yeah, bro fresh out from my hood, holiday (whoosh)
He's on license, but still on vaca' (skrrt)
Yeah, cash in hand before you see me on stage (yeah)
All that tweetin', can't say it face-to-face
Uh, you still in the block down, Holloway
Crime was the only way, fast lane, CLA
Can't afford to see jakes, nah
Nah, man, I can't afford to make mistakes (nah)
If I come late, definitely fashionably late (hah)

Not today
Can't do me the way they done me yesterday 
Christian thinks Jesus is the only way 
Muslim thinks Allah is the only way 
Sex, ha, holy way
Christian thinks Jesus is the only way 
Muslim thinks Allah is the only way 
Sex, ha, holy way

All that verbal on the Net, you dey scare who? (Huh?)
Hey, boss man, me, I no dey fear you (you mad)
You dey use your boy hotspot dey tweet (huh?)
I can't wait 'til I buck you and your peeps (boom, boom, boom)
That girl fine like Kelly pon my TikTok
Can you make it shake? Baby, make it tick-tock
Back a rotate, jumping like it's Kris Kross 
You dey make a nigga spaz like Rick Ros, huh

Said he's really tryna take me off the map, why try? (Why?)
Told her that your getting all this money, nigga, why lie? (Why?)
Said she wan fuck me and I swear I didn't try
Brodie make the guns go bukku bye bye (bye, bye, bye)
You really would regret it if you touch my ice 
Man a give a man slaps like I'm Kimbo Slice 
Took the whole cake, I ain't come for no slice (nope)
Can't get bun in the beef 'cause I came with five guys (five)

Put in the work don't wait to be put on
Bro, had the semi he put him in colon 
He don't even talk broski on action
Drippy like water strictly come fashion 
Freaky in the sheets but wahala for streets
Told him it was peak if I buck him and his peeps 
Killy on peace just like breast he squeeze 
It's another one make your volume increase

Never shed a tear even in a crisis
I was on the strip, bro was doin' ISIS
Gyal how yuh jean so tight you don't know what your size is?
She show me Dr. Pepper when I'm fantasizing (hey)
Now she here talking to me about baecation 
I need brain, baby, focus on your education 
Separate the Whitney from the Bobby that's segregation

All that verbal on the Net, you dey scare who? (Huh?)
Hey, boss man, me, I no dey fear you (you mad)
You dey use your boy hotspot dey tweet (huh?)
I can't wait 'til I buck you and your peeps (boom, boom, boom)
That girl fine like Kelly pon my TikTok
Can you make it shake? Baby, make it tick-tock
Back a rotate, jumping like it's Kris Kross 
You dey make a nigga spaz like Rick Ros, huh
Dem mad
