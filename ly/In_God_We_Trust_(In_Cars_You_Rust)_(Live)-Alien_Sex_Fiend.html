		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In god we trust (in cars you rust?)
Up on the cross, looking down
My arsehole is the sea and in it you'll drown
(up on the cross, looking down)

In god we trust, in cars we rust
Brain is soaked from ultra violent rays
Phone keeps ringing, ringing ears in the night

In god you trust, in cars you rust (rust)
Sticks and stones may break your bones
But names will never hurt us
(living on promises of what could've been)

The flesh is stretched, the flesh is blue
The smell of it all is - coming - over you (ha)
(living on promises)

In god we trust, in cars you rust (rust)
Sticks and stones might break your bones
But names will never hurt us

In god you trust, in cars (we) you rust
Talk, talk, talk, talk some more
Till you're blue in the face
(talk, talk, talk, talk some more)
Your head's on the floor
You're blue in the face
Kick it around and talk some more
Kick it around and talk some more, talk some more

In god we trust, in cars we rust
The skin is stretched, the skin is blue
The smell of it all is coming - over you

In god we trust, in cars we rust
(now I find it has me)
Bones are bleached from ultra violent rays
(oh god why me?)
The phone is ringing, ringing ears in the night
(i trusted you totally)

In god we trust
The flesh is stretched, the flesh is blue
The smell of it all is - coming - over you

In god I trust, in my car I rust
In cars we rust, in god we trust
In cars we rust, in god we trust
