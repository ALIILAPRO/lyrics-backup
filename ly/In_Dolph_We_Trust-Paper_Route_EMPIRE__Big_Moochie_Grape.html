Stupid-ass nigga, let's go (uh, yeah, uh, yeah)

Young nigga chasing these millions (millions)
Got in my bag and I tunneled my vision, uh (I tunneled my vision)
These niggas, they thought I was kidding (what?)
Broke out this shit and it really got serious (it really got serious)
Since a lil' baby, I been on my business (on my business)
And I'm standin' ten toes 'til a nigga come kill me (ten toes)
Before the mic and the deal, I was dealing (I was dealing)
Before it's said and done, I'ma make a nigga feel me (yessir)
New coupe with no ceilings (skrrt), just made a fifty real quickly (uh)
Beat this shit up in a minute (yeah)
And I don't fear no nigga (uh), play and it's gon' be a killing (brrt)
Father God gon' be my witness (Father God)
Slide on your shit with the fullys and semis (slide on your shit)
Niggas don't get away, just know the time ticking (uh-huh)
Seventy bands on my Rollie, no ticking (seventy bands)
And it's Paper Route biz
These niggas know that we the real and the richest (true story)
Don't wanna hear the bullshit, it's irrelevant (uh)
Niggas ain't fuckin' with me like I'm celibate (uh)
Been goin' dumb, but they know I'm intelligent (uh)
Got on the mic and I been straight ever since (yessir)
Know I been broke, stayed down and I kept it in (yeah)
Long live Dolph, yeah, I took a big loss, get your real, big bruh
Just know we gon' handle it (just know we gon' handle it)

Yeah, let a nigga play with your name (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Or anything somebody gon' die today, uh (yeah, die today)
Paper Route the gang, don't fuck with you lames (yeah, yeah)
Nigga playin' games, send them shooters like right away, uh (yeah, yeah)
Let a nigga play with your name 
Or anything somebody gon' die today, uh
Paper Route the gang, don't fuck with you lames
Nigga playin' games, send them shooters like right away, uh (like right away)

Yessir
Uh-huh, uh-huh, yessir

In the name of Dolph, nigga (uh-huh)

That's how this shit goin', nigga
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout? (Yeah)
Paper Route the gang, nigga
Paper Route Illuminati, nigga, know what I'm sayin'? (Big Moochie)
We still standin' on this shit, nigga
To this day, nigga, know what I'm talkin' 'bout? (Gigantic)
This shit'll never die, nigga, know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
