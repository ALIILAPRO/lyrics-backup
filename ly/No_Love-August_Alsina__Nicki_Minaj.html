		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  August (she said she understands yeah)
Young Money (I don't think I care, no)
I swear this is my favorite song
I'm serious, burrrrr

Red light, you know I can't make this thing that official
Believe, we had a great night 
But I ain't the type to tell you that I miss you, shit
You don't like that, I make this easy (easy) leaving (leaving)
After sexing on the floor
Baby I know you need me (need me) like I need you (need you)
But I'm not the one you wanna love, so just

Pop a couple bands with a nigga like me
Loving ain't the same with a nigga like me
You used to them but ain't no love in me
I hear what you was sayin' and girl it's clear to see
You should just drink a couple drinks with a nigga like me
You prolly go insane with a nigga like me
Let's just party till we can't, ain't no love in me
And I'm the one to blame, ain't no love in me

So don't come looking for love 
(No love, no love, no love, no love)
(No love, no love, no love, no love)
Don't come looking for love 
(No love, no love, no love, no love)
(No love, no love, no love, no love)

Shawty, if you looking for somebody trying to settle down
Probably won't be around, nah baby
You should hit me when you tired of playing up in the house
And ain't nobody around, you need that
When you need that late night
We can both make love to the daylight
You got it girl, you got it girl
But you know I can't stay right? Uh, nah babe
All I want is you so what you tryna do?

Pop a couple bands with a nigga like me
Loving ain't the same with a nigga like me
You used to them but ain't no love in me
I hear what you was sayin' and girl it's clear to see
You should just drink a couple drinks with a nigga like me
You prolly go insane with a nigga like me
Let's just party till we can't, ain't no love in me
And I'm the one to blame, ain't no love in me

So don't come looking for love 
(No love, no love, no love, no love)
(No love, no love, no love, no love)
Don't come looking for love 
(No love, no love, no love, no love)
(No love, no love, no love, no love, no love)

(No love, no love, no love, no love, no love)
(No love, no love, no love, no love, no love)
(No love, no love, no love, no love, no love)
(No love, no love, no love, no love, no love)

August, you know, I'm here to save you
Me and them girls, we ain't the same boo
You know I hate it, when you leave me
'Cause you love it then you leave it but you know how bad I need it
You so fuckin' conceited, why you coming over weeded?

You can't treat me like you treat them
Yes, I am the crème de la crème
Yes, I am from one to ten, ten
You fronting in them streets, keep saying we just friends
You can't front like this ain't way realer
I know you hard, I know that you a killer
I know you started off a dope dealer
But let your guard down, your niggas know you feel her, feel her
So what you want, baby?
(All I want is you so what you tryna do?)

Pop a couple bands with a nigga like me
Loving ain't the same with a nigga like me
You used to them but ain't no love in me
I hear what you was sayin' and girl it's clear to see
You should just drink a couple drinks with a nigga like me
You prolly go insane with a nigga like me
Let's just party till we can't, ain't no love in me
And I'm the one to blame, ain't no love in me

So don't come looking for love 
(No love, no love, no love, no love)
(No love, no love, no love, no love)
Don't come looking for love 
(No love, no love, no love, no love)
(No love, no love, no love, no love, no love)

(No love, no love)
