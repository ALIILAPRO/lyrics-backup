		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  tomorrow i hope i wake up as the last one on earth
i’d burn down the walls of this shit town and live in the dirt
roam the hallways i hated, kerosene every turn
visit the homes that i died in, show them i learned 

(do you wanna go home)
to be alone and watch the city burn
(do you even have a home)
(do you wanna go home)
(do you even have a home)

yeah fuck a family, i’m on my lonely
never had a goddam home to console me
baby on the east side poppin pillies
i’ll fuck up then we’ll go south until no one can say they know me

what they never gave me i’m cursed to forever seek
if blood is thinner than water then what the hell are we
abandoned and broken, vines took the foundation
the rodents moving in will have a better home than i did

(do you wanna go home)
(do you even have a home)

tomorrow i hope i wake up as the last one on earth
i’d burn down the walls of this shit town and live in the dirt
roam the hallways i hated, kerosene every turn
visit the homes that i died-

man i’m way too young to burn bridges, cut ties, feel this goddam tired
man i’m way too done with hurt feelings
oh i sympathize, i just got the stars in my eyes

tomorrow i hope i wake up as the last one on earth
i’d burn down the walls of this shit town and live in the dirt
roam the hallways i hated, kerosene every turn
visit the homes that i died in, show them i learned

(do you wanna go home)
to be alone and watch the city burn
(do you even have a home)
(do you wanna go home)
(do you even have a home)
