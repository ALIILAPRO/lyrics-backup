		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh god! 

Once again, waiting for the darkness, beyond smile this cry ("life") 
Keep trying for another one 
The bright day, one day, sets light into my way 
Dig up yourself from your grave 

Back to the reason to kill, not exactly motherfucking raw metal 
Do you look into the grime 
(Fuck the ("you") beat!), it's your choice for the future, by the cross 
Before you probably make you ("it") last 

As long as the twilight bailed 
The dead came as we embrace 
More than the ones we love 
We own it, we burn it down 

Not afraid to cry is not our fault 
Not afraid of falling down below 
To the night where we'll soon reply 
Like the living dead we'll never die 

Spoiling inside me fight back, treat you like a madman 
When your waiting for the light to come 
(She was down!), stuck on a bright ("light") shining bright 
It's time to close your eyes 

Not afraid to cry is not our fault 
Not afraid of falling down below 
To the night where we'll soon reply 
Like the living dead we'll never die 

As long as the twilight bailed 
The dead came as we embrace 
More than the ones we love 
We own it, we burn it down 

Not afraid to cry is not our fault 
Not afraid of falling down below 
To the night where we'll soon reply 
Like the living dead we'll never die
