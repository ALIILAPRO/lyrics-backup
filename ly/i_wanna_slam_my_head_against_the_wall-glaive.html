		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I shouldn't text you
You act just like my ex do
You know I try my best to catch you

She wanna be so perfect, so it's silicone
For the last two years, I've been all alone
For my last few peers, I hope you fucking choke
I'm on the brink of insanity inside my own home

I wanna slam my head against the wall 'til I cannot feel at all
She doesn't really like me, she likes alcohol
I watched my idols fall, I might just end it all
I wanna slam my head against the wall 'til I cannot feel at all
She doesn't really like me, she likes alcohol
I watched my idols fall, I might just end it all

Serotonin
I need you bad, you know it
I know you mad, I'm glowing
I know you mad, I know you mad (and I know)

Sometimes I shouldn't text you
You act just like my ex do
You know I try my best to catch you

And he has a wife but he loves his mistress
Blink twice and you might just miss it
So much jealousy, it's vindictive
I'm worthless, a pot to piss in

I wanna slam my head against the wall 'til I cannot feel at all
She doesn't really like me, she likes alcohol
I watched my idols fall, I might just end it all
I wanna slam my head against the wall 'til I cannot feel at all
She doesn't really like me, she likes alcohol
I watched my idols fall, I might just end it all
