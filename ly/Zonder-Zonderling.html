		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't go
Don't leave me here
All alone
There's no place I can be
So close
But yet so far from you
(Where did you go?)

Where did you go?
Let you go
I lose control of me
I'll be waiting for you
Where did you go?
I let you go
I lose control of me
Where did you go?

(Where did you go?)
(Where did you go?)

My tears
Running down my cheeks
And I feel 
Like I can't replace ya
I know 
There's someone out there without me
(Where did you go?)

Where did you go?
Can't find your love
Where did you go?
You're far from home
Where did you go?
I'm so alone
Is someone out there without me?

Where did you go?
Let you go
I lose control of me
I'll be waiting for you
Where did you go?
I let you go
I lose control of me
Where did you go?

(Where did you go?)
(Where did you go?)
