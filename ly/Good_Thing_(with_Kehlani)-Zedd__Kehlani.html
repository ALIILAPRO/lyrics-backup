		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I book myself tables
At all the best restaurants, then eat alone
I buy myself fast cars
Just so I can drive them real fuckin' slow
I like my own company
Company, I don't need it
I'm not always cold
I'm just good on my own, so good on my own

I've always been told, one day, I'll find
Somebody who changes my mind
If they come along, I won't think twice

'Cause I already got a good thing with me
Yeah, I already got everything I need
The best things in life are already mine
Don't tell me that you got a good thing for me
'Cause I already got a good thing with me
Yeah, I already done everything I dream
I'm good by myself, don't need no one else
Don't tell me that you got a good thing for me
'Cause I already got a good thing

I make myself up
Just to dance in the mirror when I'm at home
I pose and take pictures
Then send them to people that I don't know
I like getting compliments
Compliments how I'm feeling, oh
I'm not always selfish
Just bad at romance, it's not in my bones

I've always been told, one day, I'll find
Somebody who changes my mind
If they come along, I won't think twice

'Cause I already got a good thing with me (good thing with me)
Yeah, I already got everything I need (everything I need)
The best things in life are already mine
Don't tell me that you got a good thing for me
'Cause I already got a good thing with me (good thing with me)
Yeah, I already done everything I dream (everything I dream)
I'm good by myself, don't need no one else
Don't tell me that you got a good thing for me
'Cause I already got a good thing

I've always been told, one day, I'll find
Somebody who changes my mind
If they come along, I won't think twice

'Cause I already got a good thing with me (oh, good thing with me)
Yeah, I already got everything I need (everything I need, yeah)
The best things in life are already mine
Don't tell me that you got a good thing for me (no, no)
'Cause I already got a good thing with me (good thing with me)
Yeah, I already done everything I dream (everything, yeah)
I'm good by myself, don't need no one else
Don't tell me that you got a good thing for me
'Cause I already got a good thing
