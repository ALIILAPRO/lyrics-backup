		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She said she liked to party
She sure looked good
She said, let me show you
What I got under my hood

She slid on over
And she called me honey
She said, before you get a kiss
You got to show me the money

Show me the money
Don't be talking no trash
Only thing better than money
Is a pile of that cold hard cash

Took my baby out on the town
The other night
Drinking champagne in the
Candlelight

I told the waiter
Bring another bottle for my honey
He said, before we pop the cork
You got to show me the money

Show me the money
Don't be talking trash
Only thing better than money
Is a pile of that cold hard cash

On my way home
I stopped to catch the last call
I could hear the band jamming
The people was having a ball

The owner asked me
If I would sit in
I said I ain't no dummy
Show me the money

Show me
You know just what I mean
Don't be talking trash
If you want the real deal now
Show me that cold hard cash

Show me the money
Show me the money
Show me the money
Show me the money

The only thing better than money
Is a pile of that cold hard cash
