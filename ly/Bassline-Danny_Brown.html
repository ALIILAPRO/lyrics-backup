		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ho, the only thing you gotta know
My dick touch the ground when I'm sitting on the flo'
You think I'm gonna fall off? I got advice for ya homes
Fall asleep in your car in your garage with the engine on
I'm playing ping pong with your bitch' jaws
You the type to have a sing-along in Superman drawers
I got a redhead ho, I call her Molly Ringwald
She like to take a lot of Molly and bring Adderall
Sipping white wine 'til the sunset
Before it got dark she already got naked
Necked her for a second, then she got reckless
Rump shaker, wrecks and FX'd it
Bum, stickity bum, stickity bum, Das EFX'ed it
Left her bum sticky, fell asleep on the terrace
Me on the beat, that's a hate crime
With black ink, I murder white lines 

Baseline

What's with all the ho shit?
Your flow's atrocious, the amount of weed I smoke is copious
Eyes red like Soviet, dog, you're on some bogus shit
These novice poets are not my associates
Ferocious, but the flows inappropriate
But if you approach this they might call encroachment
I'm so bent, oh shit, got your bitch soaking
I ain't Clarence Carter but bitch I be stroking
Ho, are you outta your mind?
I tell a bitch like this, "You are not that fine"
I don't give a bitch shit, no, not a dime
But bitch, for you, I ain't even got time
The sunshine in the thunder storm
Catching clouds smelling like the green giant underarm
I can never cop her homes, I just give her Sutter Homes
Nut all on her butt, wipe it up, then I send her home 

Baseline
