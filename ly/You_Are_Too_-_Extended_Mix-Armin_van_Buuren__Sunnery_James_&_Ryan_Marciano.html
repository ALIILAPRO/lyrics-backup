		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are
You are s-
You are sand
You are sun
You are love
You're the one
You're my day
You're my night
You're my beat
Bring me light
You are classy
You are grace
You are fine
And you're mine
Mine, mine, mine, mine

You're my dream
You're my soul
I'm alive
Make me whole
You are real
You're the deal
I can feel
You're surreal
You are free
Bring me high
You are fine
And you're mine
Mine, mine, mine, mine
You are s-

Sexy
Sexy
Sexy
Sexy
Sexy
Sexy
Sexy
Sexy
Sexy

You are
Clap your hands!

You are sexy
You are sweet
You are hot
Feel the heat
You are pretty
You are pure
You're my kind
I want more
You are sexy
You are sweet
You are hot
Feel the heat
You are pretty
You are pure
You're my kind
I want more

You are sexy
You are sexy
You are sexy
You are sexy
You are sexy
You are sexy
You are sexy
You are sexy
You are sexy

You are

A State Of Trance

You are
You are
You are
