		  Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, break that down man
Ayy, bruh, don't get that shit on my sheets, bruh

She used to bust them scripts for me at Walgreens (pour up, pour up)
Smugglin' narcotics was my calling (hey), ayy

Hah-hah, you searchin' for fame (damn)
I became a superstar in the dope game (it's Dolph)
Found out you a hater, I can't look at you the same (goddamn)
She said can she take a picture with my chain? (goddamn)
Got two twin sisters, call 'em yin yang (goddamn)
I wish I wouldn't've fucked that bitch, she insane (goddamn)
Alexander McQueen on me, ain't got a stain (yeah yeah)
Turned to the plug, my life ain't never been the same (yeah yeah)

Fours on the Mercedes, that's major (uh uh)
Whole gang going crazy, that's major (uh uh)
Millions on the table, that's major (uh uh)

House full of bitches like Flavor (Flav)
These cuts in my thumb come from countin' paper, yeah (racks)
Paper Route the gang and bitch we a label (gang, yeah)
New Glock with a laser, yeah I let you meet your maker (yeah)
Then go out to Jamaica with my motherfuckin' rastas, yeah, yeah
I'm movin' with my motherfuckin' shottas, yeah, yeah
I walk in, pop my motherfuckin' collar, yeah, yeah
A pistol in the motherfuckin' party (Glock)
