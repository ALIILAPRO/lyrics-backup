		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How come the stars shine so bright
Here in this night, it will not end
There's a boy and a girl
Who know all the wrong words
And you and I need no more

[Chorus:]
It's so good to be alone with you
It's so good to be open eyed
And they won't know us anymore
Once we step back into
This old house

In this old house
Where every door is open
Listen real close
This old house

In this old house
We know there's more to this than that
With the nation of two
In this old house

This old house is where we
Consider it gone never 
Now, there were days when we would fall
Those guiding stars would shine no more
Oh it's all right with me
We just don't talk it over
Stay the rest of this day in this bed

[Chorus]
It's so good to be alone with you
It's so good to be open eyed
And they won't know us any more
Once we step back into
Oh this old house

In this old house
Where every door is open
We'll take it real slow
In this old house
In this old house
We know there's more to this than that
Never leave
This old house

Oh in this old house
We know there's more to this than that
Never leave
This old house
Oh in this old house, this old
We know there's more to this than that
We'll never leave
This old house
