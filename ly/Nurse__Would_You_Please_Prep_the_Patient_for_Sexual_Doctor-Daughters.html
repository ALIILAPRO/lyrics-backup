		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Five hundred milligrams of love has me in a disarray

(the room whitens to the voice of panicked doctors)

get this man to the o.r.
Stat: unconscious
Time lapse: (the shades rise, call button by body side)

in the recovery room I wrote a list of all the ways that you are beautiful.
It goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on...
