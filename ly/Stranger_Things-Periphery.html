		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wandering below the hadean seal
Shaking, mortified, making my way back to nowhere
This skeletal mask brings a demon of the day
There never would have been a light if the messenger in still life had regard for
The son of the damaged soul
Send the mirror falling
Heavens see that this man once had value among all the golden
But eccentric revisions in life brought on decay
Take submission from a man in control
Set the sail blowing, search for peace
A loose feeling consuming me
Blood is spent
A token for my sacrifice
Fallen angel, you speak my name
The needle turns, the hourglass is spinning around
Give it, I want it... a sense of a fucking life
I can almost feel mine at home
Selfish cries
I'm diseased
Let it pour out and show what has healed
One can finally find what's left in this masochistic personality
In a holy bond we live
Take a breath for seconds in this moment
Sail upon the open skies (Sail upon the open skies, Sail upon the open skies)
Exhale your death and feel life, like water raining from above
Majestic aura
Take in my breath and lock eyes with a world once absent of your love
Majestic aura
Blood is spent
A token for my sacrifice
The tortured realm has released my name
I can feel my body parting with this world Rebirth is starting from within
I'm born some place beyond your time 
I'm born some place beyond your time Selfish cries
Flaunt disease
Own what's mine
Death upon my knees
Let it pour out and show what has healed
One can finally find what's left inside this masochistic personality
In a holy bond we live
Take a breath for seconds in this moment
Sail upon the open skies
Let it pour out and show what has healed
One can finally find what's left inside this masochistic personality
In a holy bond we live
Take a breath for seconds in this moment
Sail upon the open skies
Floating up above the hadean seal
Sounds of ambient voices will lead me from nowhere
This skeletal mask brings a demon of the day
