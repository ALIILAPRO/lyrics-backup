		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  New Saturday
In the park, didn't think you fell that hard
Woke up again
Woke up and you wanted a new start
New Saturday
In the park, didn't think you fell that hard
Oh, Adrian
The silver maple never saw you coming

Stay where you are
State what you are
Stay where you are
And no one gets hurt

You cut your hair
Now you look like a little boy
You climbed the stairs
So high, you can't come down from there
Said you wanted to get it together but you don't
Said you wanted to get it together but you won't

Say something, waste something
Change your life
Take something, break something
Make your flight
Say something, anything
Mommy wants you to be a doctor
So she can tell her friends you're like your father
And if it's all for the sake of conversation
Then maybe you should try a new vocation
Oh, saved by a waif and the weight of your wayfarers

Not to be confused with hippies in Toronto

You cut your hair
Now you look like a little boy
You climbed the stairs
So high, you can't come down from there
Said you wanted to get it together but you don't
Said you wanted to get it together but you won't
Oh, saved by a waif and the weight of your wayfarers
