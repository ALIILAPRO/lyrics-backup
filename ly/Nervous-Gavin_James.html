		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I promise that I'll hold you when it's cold out
When we loose our winter coats in the spring
'Cause lately I was thinking I never told you
That every time I see you my heart sings

'Cause we lived at the carnival in summer
We scared ourselves to death on a ghost train
And just like every Ferris wheel stops turning
Oh I guess we had an expiration date
So I won't say I love you, it's too late

(And oh)

'Cause every time I saw you I got nervous
Shivering and shaking at the knees
And just like every song I haven't heard yet no
I didn't know the words in front of me
In front of me, and oh
But I don't wanna know

Who'll take you home?
Who'll take you home?
Who'll take you home, home?
If I let you go

(And oh)

Now that you're on someone else's shoulders
The winter winds are colder on my own
Maybe we will meet when we get older
Maybe we won't
So I won't say I love you if you don't
And no you don't (oh oh)
So I won't say I love you if you don't
