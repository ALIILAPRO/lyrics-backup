		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say that you love me
Do you really mean that?
I'm not sure but I think you do
I say that I love you
Do I really mean that?
I'm not sure but I think I do
All we do is fight fight fight
Till the night time time time 
And I'm sick and tired of it 
All you do is wine wine wine 
While I sigh sigh sigh
And were sick and tired of it
