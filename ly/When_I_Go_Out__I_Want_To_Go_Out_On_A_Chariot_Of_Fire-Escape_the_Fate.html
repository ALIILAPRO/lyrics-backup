		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He had a plan to kill you all along,
The evidence was hidden in this song,
I was a ghost,
I was there at the scene,
As the embers rise, my hands,
Smelled like gasoline,

So, the headlights murdered my thoughts,
I curse this taste that's on my tongue,
This taste will last until I rip it out,
No, I won't need these gloves,
Her bones are withered away, but her ghost will remain.

You're the only one that wore your seat belt,
We're the only ones that cried,
Catastrophic accidents,
You're the only one that died.

[Chorus:]
So keep my casket closed,
Your heart beats under the floor,
It haunts me in my dreams,
And nothing's as it seems,

Hallelujah, whoaa
So just believe in me,
I'll never let you down,
This was a curse like you said,
As you lie in your bed.

You're the only one that wore your seat belt,
We're the only ones that cried,
Catastrophic accidents,
You're the only one that died.

[Chorus]

Tried so hard,
To heal the scars and touch her heart.
I was to blame,
For the reasons and the absence of my faith.
[x2]

You say that there's no
(I never thought, I would never expect for this to turn out this way.)
Answers and I,
(Down below, lies your bones, they're cold and withered away)

You say that there's no answers and I,
(I never thought, I would never expect for this to turn out this way, down below)

I was a ghost.

What did you expect?
(It was never enough, it was never enough, it was never enough, now was it?)
[x3]

Down below,
Lies your bones,
I'm dancing with your ghost,
I hope and pray that someday,

[Chorus x2]

I was a ghost.
(But nothing's as it seems)
