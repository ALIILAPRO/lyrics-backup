		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drive on, drive on
My special one
Don't you stop 'til you know you're gone
Your sister and me have a set of keys
Don't you worry your head 'bout a thing

Drive on, drive on
My special one
Don't you stop 'til you know you're gone

Drive on, drive on
My special one
Don't you stop 'til you know you're gone
Your sister and me will keep your place clean 
so it shines when you finally come home

Drive on, drive on
My special one
Don't you stop 'til you know you're gone
