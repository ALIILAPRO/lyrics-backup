		  Next to your love next to your love
I wanna get next to your love
Next to your love next to your love oh
Get next to your love

Sweet fire my desire
I admire your body yeah yeah yeah
Keep me nice punani righteous
Can't divide us cause you are my baby

Girl I tek you on I make you feel like fuck
Cock it up and jack it up and give you this woah
Suicide doors the way your legs up store
The way your pussy locked on mi body handcuff

You got me hypnotized but I know that it's alright
Girl I apologize never been too anxious uh

I just wanna get next to your love next to your love uh
I wanna get next to your love
Next to your love next to your love oh

Next to your love next to your love uh
I wanna get next to your love
Next to your love next to your love oh

Flip up on I twist up in di bed yeah
Get you wetta than a showerhead uh
You reach 2 o'clock inna me yard uh
So mi make you bowl and beg
You got di right energy
If you lookin' for ah fix I got di remedy
Coulda been anywhere but you here with me
Don't you deny girl don't you deny

You got me hypnotized but I know that it's alright
Girl I apologize never been too anxious uh

I just wanna get next to your love next to your love uh
I wanna get next to your love
Next to your love next to your love oh
Get next to your love

I wanna get next to your love
