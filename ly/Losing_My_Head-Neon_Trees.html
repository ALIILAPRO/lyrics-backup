		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You need new friends, someone you can depend on
Dispose of old ones like a box full of toys
I understand the mentality lately
Burn everything to the ground it wasn't for us

My greatest trend is how much I adored you
A consequence for a lifetime of fear
When half of everything is something uncomfortable
You learn to understand why everything's here

I'm out on the edge, almost could
Remember the last time I felt this good
The more I know what heaven's like
The more I'm chasing hell tonight

High water, swim harder
I guess I'm trying to catch a wave
I'm out on the edge seeing red
I guess I found my way back by losing my head

I guess I found my way back by losing my head
I guess I found my way back by losing my head

You need new friends, it's a common occurrence
Like if you really love it, give it away
I understand that mentality lately
Burn everything to the ground to make way

My latest drug is how much I ignore you
My latest thrill is consensual sex
When half of everything is something uncomfortable
You learn to understand what everything meant

I'm out on the edge, almost could
Remember the last time I felt this good
The more I know what heaven's like
The more I'm chasing hell tonight

High water, swim harder
I guess I'm trying to catch a wave
I'm out on the edge seeing red
I guess I found my way back by losing my head

I guess I found my way back by losing my head
I guess I found my way back by losing my head

Modern culture is a common regret
Modern culture is a common regret
Yeah, fuck your patience, I've been coming correct
And now I found a way back by losing my head

I'm out on the edge, almost could
Remember the last time I felt this good
The more I know what heaven's like
The more I'm chasing hell tonight

High water, swim harder
I guess I'm trying to catch a wave
I'm out on the edge seeing red
I guess I found my way back by losing my head

I guess I found my way back by losing my head
I guess I found my way back by losing my head
