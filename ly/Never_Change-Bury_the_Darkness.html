		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't believe how long it's been
It took some time
My eyes are opening now
You won't hear the truth of what I have to say
I feel like this is going nowhere
If this is love I'm better off without it
I've waited long enough to know why
Somethings in life never really change
Here we go again
Living in a cycle being punished till the end
Masochist, narcissistic
A personality I learned to love
I'm through being stuck living with your fucked up lies
Now I refuse to go along with a game that's killing me inside
What I have to say is
I feel like this is going nowhere
If this is love I'm better off without it
I've waited long enough to know why
Somethings in life never really change
Take your misery and lies you fed to me
Get out of my mind and let me live in peace
This is going nowhere
This is going nowhere
I feel like this is going nowhere
If this is love I'm better off without it
I've waited long enough to know why
Somethings in life never really change
