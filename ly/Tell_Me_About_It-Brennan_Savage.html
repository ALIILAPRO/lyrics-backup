		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Turn around, look away, don't be scared, it's ok
Tell me bout it
Turn around, look away, don't be scared, it's ok

I've been thinkin' what it takes to be a man
All the pills and all these drugs are like a crutch to help me stand
I can't walk without you, you're like a brace across my back
I can't breathe around you
You're like my lungs when they collapse
And I can't hear you scream help
When I fall asleep, and I can't hear my voice
Right through the door, you closed on me
Someone needs to help me, I've fell into the dark
I been so distracted since you pierced me in my heart

I'm lost, but you found me
I'm gone, but you ground me
When time, runs out not
I'll be fine, but I'm dead inside
Tell me 'bout it

Turn around, look away, don't be scared, it's ok
Tell me 'bout it
Turn around, look away, don't be scared, it's ok
I'm lost, I'm lost, I'm tired, I'm dying, I'm fine, but I'm dead inside

I'm lost, but you found me
I'm gone, but you ground me
When time, runs out not
I'll be fine, but I'm dead inside
Tell me 'bout it

Settle down, say goodnight, don't be scared, it's alright
Tell me bout it
Settle down, say goodnight, don't be scared, it's alright
Settle down, say goodnight, don't be scared, it's alright
