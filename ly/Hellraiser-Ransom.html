		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All aboard on this twisted
And crooked journey, i'm cookin' early
Food for thought, a lot is at stake
And now they all lookin' worried
I shook the jury with a hook and flurry
I ran thirty in his chest with the falcon
 got all these rookies girly
My look is surly
Full beard with the greys in it
You stay timid
Mount Rushmore of rap and my face in it
(Facts) i straight clinic, I'm surgical
With the shit, jake
A sick ape, i pound on my chest 'til
All of my ribs break
It's Ransom, remember that name, trust me
You lames lucky stab a nigga over the TV
Make sure the blade's rusty (Ahh)
Life is clean but the grave's dusty
I'm cleanin' house usin' all of my muscle
Guess I was made husky
I refuse to let this pain crush me
I brainstorm in the booth and cry
When the rain touch me (Real shit)
With all this power, it's a risky bidness
Your darkest hour's only sixty minutes
So I keep my family and guns closer
Got one holster if I had a boy I would
Strap it over my son's shoulder
(yeah, war ready)
Now that's what I call a young soldier
Raise the heat, too hot on these streets
I let the sun roast ya
Kill me, nah that's tricky hoe
Too risky bro
Thinkin' you got "Power" for life
Until that fifty show (Bla-ouw)
My mama said I'm a hell raiser
A pure shooter like Dame Lillard
A Trailblazer

He in the wrong business
Thinkin' he powerful
But he won't know his strength in the
Place until he walks in it
When you on top, certain shit off limit's
(Niggas lost privilege) stainless got
The gloss finish
Mama said I'ma meet my match
Pops smokin' stones
Home is where I leave my hat
Ain't gotta put me in top 5s
'Cause I'll be good cookin' Popeye's

Yeah, let's try to get to this plot quicker
You not sicker
I'll cross you niggas like swastikas (yeah)
You not killers
You petty dealers and shoplifters
Hardest thing to be in this
World is somethin' you not, nigga
(Facts) gotta be brutally honest just to
Get through to ya
I dance with the reaper and
Did a mambo with Lucifer
It has to be more to this
Life than models and hookah, bruh
You lack balls dog
I don't think that motto is new to ya
I prove to ya, my level is Mars
Saturn and Jupiter
I'm fresher than cilantro
Fresh lime with arugula
Yeah, I'm ramblin', might be losin ya
(Come on) but it might be too damagin'
Tellin' truth to ya (Let's go)
I'm dark horror like Tony
Todd to phony frauds no façade
Life is a gamble but you don't know the odds
Nah, my father said I'm a hell raiser
Melo with the shot from the corner
A true Trailblazer
