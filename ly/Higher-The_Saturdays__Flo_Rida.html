		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm doing nothing;
'Cause then at least I'm doing nothing wrong.
And I'm staying on my own,
And turn off my telephone,
But nothings gained, nothings won.

Yeah, you can tell them,
Yeah, you can say whatever;
I don't care, yeah.
But if you wanna play it cool,
Then I got news for you,
It's getting hotter, hotter in here

So, when I speak, listen
This is my decision,
But you keep on messing up the words (oh, oh, oh)
So when I speak, listen,
'Cause you keep on pushing,
Like I need permission to be heard (oh, oh, oh)
I'm gonna lift it, lift it,
Higher!
I'm gonna lift it, lift it,
Higher!
So when I speak, listen,
This is my decision,
But you keep on messing up the words.

It's getting closer,
I'm movin' in and there are things ya know,
And I am sick of playing games,
And I'm not go'n say no names,
But you are not who to blame.

Yeah, you can turn off,
Yeah, you can go ahead and put it straight,
'Cause I am finishing myself,
And I do not need your help,
I'm gonna do this tonight.

So, when I speak, listen
This is my decision,
But you keep on messing up the words (oh, oh, oh)
So when I speak, listen,
'Cause you keep on pushing,
Like I need permission to be heard (oh, oh, oh)
I'm gonna lift it, lift it,
Higher!
I'm gonna lift it, lift it,
Higher!
So when I speak, listen,
This is my decision,
But you keep on messing up the words.

I'm gonna lift it, lift it
When you say higher, I go higher!
I'm gonna lift it, lift it
Yeah, you can try, but I go higher!
I'm gonna lift it, lift it
The only thing that I've been tryin' to do is listen, so listen!

So, when I speak, listen
This is my decision, (yeah, yeah!)
But you keep on messing up the words (oh, oh, oh) (You keep on messing up my words!)
So when I speak, listen,
'Cause you keep on pushing,
Like I need permission to be heard (oh, oh, oh)
I'm gonna lift it, lift it,
Higher!
I'm gonna lift it, lift it,
Higher!
So when I speak, listen,
This is my decision,
But you keep on messing up the words.
