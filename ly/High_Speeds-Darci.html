		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lost in the city
Where we sitting we can sightsee
Hitting tunnel vision
Make you wonder what it might be
Something hitting different
Got us racing through the high beams
I think, crazy what can happen
At these high speeds
IIcy, shawty know it glisten
With the ice cream
Time leaves, sitting something different
When the night bleeds
Might be, thinking what can happen
At these high speeds (yeah)

Whips on the order shawty hop off the curb
Pull up to the room know it’s do not disturb
If we talking keep it honest
We ain’t mixing the words
Racks in the duffle
Like we flipping with birds
But you know how it gets
When it gets to the worst
Keep cold like your wrist
When we down in the dirt
Knife hold, let it twist
Cause you know what it’s worth
Yeah yeah, cause you know what it’s worth

Lost in the city
Where we sitting we can sightsee
Hitting tunnel vision
Make you wonder what it might be
Something hitting different
Got us racing through the high beams
I think, crazy what can happen
At these high speeds
IIcy, shawty know it glisten
With the ice cream
Time leaves, sitting something different
When the night bleeds
Might be, thinking what can happen
At these high speeds (yeah)

Lost in disorder we got plenty to learn
Up crossing borders we got plenty to burn
What you want we can order
Never really concerned
We got racks out the duffle
Like we flipping with birds
But you know how it gets
When it gets to the worst
Keep cold like your wrist
When we down in the dirt
Knife hold, let it twist
Cause you know what it’s worth
Yeah yeah, cause you know what it’s worth

Hitting tunnel vision
Make you wonder what it might be
Something hitting different
Got us racing through the high beams
I think, crazy what can happen
At these high speeds
Crazy what can happen at these high speeds
IIcy, shawty know it glisten
With the ice cream
Time leaves, sitting something different
When the night bleeds
Might be, thinking what can happen
At these high speeds (yeah)
Hitting tunnel vision
Make you wonder what it might be
