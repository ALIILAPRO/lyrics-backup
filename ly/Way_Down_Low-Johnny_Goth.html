		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just want to see you in the light my love
I can tell that your not afraid
Tell me you love me just to hear me say the same
But when the day is falling
Day is falling
No ones callin'
The rain is falling down
And no ones callin~
Let's make it so
My dear I'd like to meet you in the way down low
In the way down low
Oh it's true, what they say about you
But I forget when the
Day is falling
No ones calling
The rain is falling down
And no ones callin~
Wait
I think I love you but I don't want to repeat myself
When love always turns to hate
In the day, love will never change
But in the night thats when the
Day is falling
No ones callin
The rain is falling down
And no ones callin' no ones callin'
Day is falling
No ones calling
The rain is falling down
And no ones callin~
