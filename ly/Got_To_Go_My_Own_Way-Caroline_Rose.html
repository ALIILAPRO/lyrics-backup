		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you see me?
On the big screen
I'm talking 'bout our back-home's
'Cause they got the big dreams

And when I come home
They call me little Hollywood
I get free ice cream
And give it to the kids of our neighborhood

When you see me
Just like at our first dance
Or in the schoolyard
Swinging on the swing set

I'll be walking alone
Taking the higher road
I'm taking my first steps

'Cause I got to go my own way
About to start a new life
I got to go my own way
'Cause I was born to be a star

I'm moving to LA
A weekend to Paris
I'm gonna bask in fame
Fiji in a banana hammock

Remain humble
Not like all these fakers
Always get bleacher seats
Sitting at the LA Lakers

And when will you see me
Just like when we first met
You catching green lights
You only see red flags

But the past is done
I've clearly moved on
Enjoy your new name

'Cause I got to go my own way
I've got to start a new life
I got to go my own way
I was born to be a star

I'm jumping off the deep end
I'll be back when the kids are named
I've got to go my own way
And now it's time to say goodbye

(Remember when we wanted all of the same things)
(To settle down and hyphen both of our last names)
(That's getting close, so now it's time to save face)
(And I move away, one thing I do say)

Got to live my

Got to have my
