		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Caught up in my feelings, I'll fuck around and kill another nigga
You ain't even gotta push me, how I'm feelin' now
I been havin' mood swings like a Gemini
I can use the murder for therapy
I can make the news with it, break the internet
Have 'em all nervous and scared of me
Then get away sneaky clean, never seen a thing (K.i.D)
I got forty-four F&N bullets and twenty-five thousand stuffed in these Amiri jeans
Damn, look at what happened to hip-hop
He at the Grammys and still got that shit cocked
Pull out the cameras with me and my bitch out
And take a picture, ain't a hatin' nigga in the world fuckin' with big John
I'll knock his brains out if he got it on his mind

Lonely, lonely baby
Lonely, lonely baby
A lonely, lonely baby (lonely)
Lonely, lonely baby (lonely, baby)
Lonely, lonely baby
A lonely, lonely baby (K)

As if I got a reason to act like I'm lonely
I saw my big brother laid out with his brains blowed out
It's been catchin' up on me
Shit, how would you act if your bro took his life?
And you know that you rappin', make all of these millions
And you don't even trap and you livin' your life
The best you ever had just to see it come crashin', I'm burnin'
You don't know the feelin'
In the car with a bottle of liquor, a pistol, a lonely killer
Ain't no love at the top, just a lonely nigga
Ain't no love at the bottom either
All these blood-suckin' leeches and bottom feeders
All these sores on our feet 'cause we over-steppin'
He just caught his first one so you know he reppin'
He just a lonely, lonely baby, yeah, baby
Peter Piper picked the pepper
I pulled a stick out, hit him, then I left him
She pulled my dick out, hit her on the dresser
We fucked my aggression out
She like a pretzel how I fold her up and put it in her
She fuckin' a lonely nigga that's a killer, nigga
(That ain't DaBaby, that's my baby, K.i.D)

Mm, it's Weezy Baby, at the top, it's lonely
Got choppers on me, can't stop the moment
I just popped a soma and now I'm calmer
All that body on me got you hot, I'm warmin'
And it ain't gon' help you more than I'm gon' harm you
Out here by myself rollin' like a army
Fuck her by myself, fuck her with her homies
I don't need nobody, I don't see no solids
Ba-ba-ba-ba-bap, 'til I don't see nobody
Come and see about it, I bet you see a rivalry
On Giovanni's and I bet this pipe knock the Peter out of him
Better pick the pepper, all the devils hide from here to Heaven
Better get a reverend, bet his mama cry when she hear the reverend
Shots hit the reverend, better get a extra with your lonely ass
On your OnlyFans, you your only fan
You gon' die a stripper, wasn't born to dance
Fucked a thousand niggas, I'm the only man let you stay lonely
Let you skate on it, let you play on it
Then lay on it and cuddle on it
MJ on 'em, like you are not alone

Lonely, lonely baby (baby)
Lonely, lonely baby
A lonely, lonely baby (lonely, lonely, lonely)
Lonely, lonely baby (lonely, lonely, lonely)
Lonely, lonely baby
A lonely, lonely baby (you are not alone)
