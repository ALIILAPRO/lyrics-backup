		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it romantic how all my elegies
Eulogize me?
I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones
These hunters with cell phones

Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

What should be over burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I've come too far to watch some name-dropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth

Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow
Right over my bare feet
'Cause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here

A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools with my calamitous love
And insurmountable grief

Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse
No, not without you
