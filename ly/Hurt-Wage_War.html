		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Does it ever go away?
Or will I always feel this way?
Feels like I'm cursed by this burn
And it all adds up to hurt
Is it written on my grave?
Or a cycle I can't break?
Do we all just wait our turn?
'Cause it all just feels like

Hurt, I can never seem to find the right words
I guess that's still the way the world turns
You break me, forsake me
And show me everything that I can never be

It still hurts
It feels like everything just gets worse (worse)
But I can't be the only one at ends
With this to live until I have learned
All adds up to (hurt, hurt)

Does it know me by my name?
Or will it haunt us all the same?
It always comes in waves
'Cause nothing good can stay

It still hurts
I can never seem to find the right words
I guess that's still the way the world turns
You break me, forsake me
And show me everything that I can never be

It still hurts
It feels like everything just gets worse
But I can't be the only one at ends
With this to live until I have learned
It all adds up to hurt

Does it ever go away?
Does it ever go away? (Go away)

Hurt, I can never seem to find the right words
I guess that's still the way the world turns
You break me, forsake me
And show me everything that I can never be

It still hurts
It feels like everything just gets worse
But I can't be the only one at ends
With this to live until I have learned
It all adds up to hurt
It all adds up to
