		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Yeah yeah
Quavo

I just counted up a hundred thousand, I don't like to do no talkin'
Show these niggas that I'm ballin', show these hoes that I'm flawless
What you would just for that cash?
What you would do just for your man?
I swear it's hard to keep track
All this money coming fast
Baby if you love a nigga let me know
But if it's temporary then you can go
She gon' fuck me just to put my chain on
Say that she love me just to put my ring on

Inside the bag, baby come and take a look
Swear this world is too large for somebody to be pushed
Every time we hit the scene we have everybody shook, yeah
Count up that paper then we stack it like some books yeah
Get together just to break up, that been too many times
Meteor rise, I swear you one of a kind
When you come question me sometimes I might tell a few lies
Fuck all that pride, went on stage I had you by my side

I just counted up a hundred thousand, I don't like to do no talkin'
Show these niggas that I'm ballin', show these hoes that I'm flawless
What you would just for that cash?
What you would do just for your man?
I swear it's hard to keep track
All this money coming fast
Baby if you love a nigga let me know
But if it's temporary then you can go
She gon' fuck me just to put my chain on
Say that she love me just to put my ring on

Yeah yeah, Quavo
I put my chain on a spinner (ice ice)
Hypnotized the way she ride when I hit it (skrt skrt skrt)
And I ain't seen her in a minute (no)
I'm her town, hook her fam up with tickets
Look at your wrist right now, imagine a bust down
Got her last nigga mad but don't want smoke now
And she like the way I grab her neck like a chokeslam
Got her piped up, FaceTiming on boats now (pipe up)
Now my top down, we sliding
Ice tray keep shining (ice)
New cars, no mileage (new whip)
Huncho cosigned it (Huncho)
She like I'm from the streets, that's a fact though (fact)
If she ever go away I want it back though (want it back)
'Cause I had four by four wood on them bandos (bando)
Bought a bag from overseas, a place she didn't know
I turned around and put a ten on her tuition (ten)
Now three years later she somewhere out there gettin' it (yeah)

Tell me if it's genuine or if it's phony
You gon' ride for me for life or for the moment?
If I lose the juice would you leave me out here lonely?
When I'm in that pussy you gon' tell me that I own it?
To be honest I feel like you round me 'cause I got a check
Tryna show off all on Snapchat with my chain around your neck
I counted up some trap money and bought a Audemar Piguet
And if you lookin' for a come-up let me know 'cause this ain't that

I just counted up a hundred thousand, I don't like to do no talkin'
Show these niggas that I'm ballin', show these hoes that I'm flawless
What you would just for that cash?
What you would do just for your man?
I swear it's hard to keep track
All this money coming fast
Baby if you love a nigga let me know
But if it's temporary then you can go
She gon' fuck me just to put my chain on
Say that she love me just to put my ring on
