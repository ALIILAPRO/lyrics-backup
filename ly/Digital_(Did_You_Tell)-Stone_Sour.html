		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, save us all again
From a cynic's Armageddon
When your mind didn't want to break
Your rusty mouth consented
I think you're all afraid
Too afraid to admit pollution
Now there's no easy way 
To avoid such a hard solution

Digital (digital)
Did you tell the world today that we would say goodbye?
Digital (digital)
Did you tell the world today that we would say goodbye? (Goodbye)

Here we go again with a brilliant overreaction
My advice isn't gonna change
Dysfunction over fashion
I think you're all ashamed
Too ashamed to admit your faults (faults)
No daylight in the bunker
Just darkness in the vaults

Digital (digital)
Did you tell the world today that we would say goodbye? (Bye)
Digital (digital)
Did you tell the world today that we would say goodbye?

There's only one way out of this
But do we have the nerve to try?
'Cause there is no way out of this
If all our answers say goodbye (goodbye)

Goodbye (goodbye)
There's only one way out of this
But do we have the nerve to try?
'Cause there is no way out of this
If all our answers say goodbye (bye)

Digital (digital)
Did you tell the world today that we would say goodbye? (bye)
Digital (digital)
Did you tell the world today that we would say goodbye?

Digital (digital)
Did you tell the world today that we would say goodbye?
Digital (digital)
Did you tell the world today that we would say goodbye? (goodbye)
