		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dragging through the night
Who was left, who was left to comfort?
Nobodies in sight of it
Caught at the net
Mention of your charm

Lost souls
You're a laughing stock
Limitless songs
Loveless sour
Leave so long
Surreal

(Lonely shadow, lonely shadow)
Lay still
Leave softly love
Separated line
Sensing less
So long
Stay low
Surreal

I don't wanna kill time like it doesn't matter
You chose this instrument yourself
Stop trying to make it seem like you give a shit
You don't have to believe in anything

I don't wanna kill time like it doesn't matter
You chose this instrument yourself
Stop trying to make it seem like you give a shit
You don't have to believe in anything

I can't stop this one
We are meant to change
In the wind and rain
Make me new again
Make me new again
We are meant to change
Make me new

(Lonely shadow, lonely shadow)
Lay still
Leave softly love
Separated line
Sensing less
So long
Stay low
Surreal

I don't wanna kill time like it doesn't matter
You chose this instrument yourself
Stop trying to make it seem like you give a shit
You don't have to believe in anything

I don't wanna kill time like it doesn't matter
You chose this instrument yourself
Stop trying to make it seem like you give a shit
You don't have to believe in anything

(Lonely shadow) I don't want to be alone with it anymore
(Lonely shadow) I don't want to make the lottery
(Lonely shadow) forgive another victim

I don't wanna kill time like it doesn't matter
You chose your instrument yourself
Stop trying to make it seem like you made a difference
You don't have to believe in anything

I don't wanna kill time like it doesn't matter
You chose this instrument yourself
Stop trying to make it seem like you give a shit
You don't have to believe in anything

I don't wanna kill time like it doesn't matter
You chose this instrument yourself
Stop trying to make it seem like you give a shit
You don't have to believe in anything
