		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a half-read story
I was fine on the shelf
Why did you take me down
As if I needed your help?
No prior warning
No one to catch when I fell
Now that you're not around
I'm not doing so well

Do I look like a monster
Underneath all my skin?
I wanna cut all this open
'Til I'm feeling something
Now I'm tracing the cracks
So I can let the light in
I'm in love with the ghost of you

Better luck next year
There's nothing left here
Why am I constantly searching, feeling unsettled?
Living in Hell, pretending it's Heaven
Head spin
Maybe I'm destined to be
Always lonely, alone, a loser, pathetic
Maybe tomorrow will be better

But I'm stuck on the page
But I'm stuck on the page
But I'm stuck on the page

I'm a half-read story
Better off in the fire
Now I feel like the fool
Haunted by desire
For a moment of glory
I would risk all I am
I look at what we had
And I don't understand

Do I look like a monster
Underneath all my skin?
I wanna cut all this open
'Til I'm feeling something
Now I'm chasing the cracks
'Til I can let the light in
I'm in love with the ghost of you

Better luck next year
There's nothing left here
Why am I constantly searching, feeling unsettled?
Living in Hell, pretending it's Heaven
Head spin
Maybe I'm destined to be
Always lonely, alone, a loser, pathetic
Maybe tomorrow will be better

But I'm stuck on the page
But I'm stuck on the page
But I'm stuck on the page
But I'm stuck on the page
