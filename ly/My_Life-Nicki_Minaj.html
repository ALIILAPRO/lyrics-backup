		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm always up, ain't gotta ante
I ball hard, don't ever owe 'em like Lammy
Ayo, these bitches lucky that I still ain't find a nanny
All of them is my junior, Sammy, uh
They know I pop up like jumprope
If-if the queen sleeze put a bag on it then it's gun smoke
So ain't playin' on the internet
I got bigger fish to fry, that's why I got a bigger net

Once I had a love and it was a gas
Tried to play me but I should've done it first
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
I stole his heart and then I put it in a verse
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
He caught feelings when I rode it in reverse
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
These bitches mad I did better and first

When I go, I can't take the money with me
Gotta keep a hitter 'round, they tryna get me, whoa
Real or fake, baby, sorry, I don't know (baby, I don't know)
They don't know me but they always judgin' my life
They can't tell me who to love or fuck, it's my life
They gon' talk about me whether I'm wrong or I'm right
I don't need no more drama in my life
My life, my life, my life (my life)
My life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life (my life, my life, my life)

Ain't no prince on the jammies
But'll still tuck that ass to sleep like your mammy
I pull strings without the hammy
Bunch of jealous bitches, but I know the real bitches hear me
A bitch hot, come feel me
And that ass still sittin' so I know they can't stand me
Sexy bitch, but my money real manly
Sealed your fate if you ever hated on the family

Once I had a love and it was a gas
Tried to play me but I should've done it first
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
I stole his heart and then I put it in a verse
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
He caught feelings when I rode it in reverse
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
These bitches mad I did better and first

When I go, I can't take the money with me
Gotta keep a hitter 'round, they tryna get me, whoa
Real or fake, baby, sorry, I don't know (baby, I don't know)
They don't know me but they always judgin' my life
They can't tell me who to love or fuck, it's my life
They gon' talk about me whether I'm wrong or I'm right
I don't need no more drama in my life
My life, my life, my life (my life)
My life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life (my life, my life, my life)

Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
