		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I breathe in slow to compose myself
But the bleeding heart I left on the shelf
Starts beating now, bleeding half death
'Cause I hear in you all mine

So I press my lips down to your neck
And I stay there and I reconnect
Bravery, I've been trying to be perfect
It can wait for a while

Scared of the hope in my head
It's been making me sweat, but it turns out
You here with your head on my chest
I should guess

The world will turn and we'll both will learn how to be
To be incomplete

I breathe out now and we fall back in
Just like before we can re-begin
Let your arms push slow up against my skin
Let it all feel just right

Gone is the emptiness
We just take what's best and move on
All of the heart gets left
I should of guessed

The world will turn and we'll both will learn how to be
To be incomplete
This here now, it's where we touch down
You and me, let's be incomplete

How we ever go without?
I don't know but it looks like we made it again
Tell me you'll never look down, down

And the world will turn and we'll grow
We'll learn how to be
To be incom

I don't wanna look down
I don't want us to break up in the cloud
All I want is to stay us to, stay with you now

I don't wanna look down
I don't want us to break up in the cloud
All I want is to stay us, to stay with you now

And the world will turn and we'll both will learn how to be
To be incomplete
This here now, it's where we touch down
You and me let's be incomplete
