		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dance with me under the diamonds
See me like breath in the cold
Sleep with me here in the silence
Come kiss me, silver and gold
You say that I won't lose you but you can't predict the future
So just hold on like you will never let go
Yeah, if you ever move on without me
I need to make sure you know

That you are the only one I'll ever love
(I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone
(I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
Lookin' back on my life, you're the only good I've ever done
(Ever done)
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone
(Anyone) not anyone

Forever's not enough time to
Love you the way that I want (love you the way that I want)
'Cause every morning I find you
I fear the day that I don't
You say that I won't lose you but you can't predict the future
'Cause certain things are out of our control
Yeah, if you ever move on without me
I need to make sure you know

That you are the only one I'll ever love
(Only one) (I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone
(I gotta tell ya) gotta tell ya
Lookin' back on my life, you're the only good I've ever done
(I've ever done)
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone
It's not anyone, not anyone

Oh
If it's not you, it's not anyone
Oh
Oh yeah, whoa

Yeah, you are the only one I'll ever love
(I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya, yeah)
You, if it's not you, it's not anyone
(I gotta tell ya) gotta tell ya
Lookin' back on my life, you're the only good I've ever done
(Ever done, oh, yeah)
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone
