		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been headed to the bottom of the barrel for a while now
I think I need to slow down
I've been blaming everybody but myself and yet somehow
I feel the weight deep down

Yeah, you know me
Making friends with all my demons, never lonely
Self-destructive and I know it
But it's only a matter of time before I'm outta my mind
I think I need a lifeline

I don't know when I became somebody
Somebody I don't recognize
I swear to God I never saw this coming
I never thought I'd leave it all behind
I want it, don't need it
I had to realize
I hate it, I feed it
Believed my own lies
I really think that I could use somebody
Somebody to bring me back to life

Sometimes it comes in waves
And hits me out of nowhere like a hurricane
Feels like I'm going insane
I don't wanna be a problem
But my self-control's a losing game
When the venom's in my veins

Yeah, you know me
Makin friends with all my demons, never lonely
Self-destructive and I know it but it's only
A matter of time before I'm outta my mind
I wish that I could rewind

I don't know when I became somebody
Somebody I don't recognize
I swear to God I never saw this coming
I never thought I'd leave it all behind
I want it, don't need it
I had to realize
I hate it, I feed it
Believed my own lies
I really think that I could use somebody
Somebody to bring me back to life

Yeah, you know me
Makin friends with all my demons, never lonely
Self-destructive and I know it but its only
A matter of time
Before it's flatlined vital signs
Can I be revived?
Can I be revived?

I don't know when I became somebody
Somebody I don't recognize
I swear to God I never saw this coming
I never thought I'd leave it all behind
I want it, don't need it
I had to realize
I hate it, I feed it
Believed my own lies
I really think that I could use somebody
Somebody to bring me back to life

Can I be revived?
Somebody to bring me back to life
