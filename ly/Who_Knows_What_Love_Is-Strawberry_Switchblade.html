		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sitting in my front room
On a rainy afternoon
My mind turns to think of you
And how I might see you soon
Then I get myself a glass of milk
And a color magazine
I flick through it slowly
But the pages are unseen
And I think

[Chorus]
Who knows what love is
I wonder if you do
Who could tell me what love is
I wish it could be you
I wish it could be you

Sitting in my front room
As the sun is going down
I'm wishing I had someone
Who could maybe come around
Oh but all I do is watch TV
A program I want to
But I never see it
Cause I'm thinking about you
And I think

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Who knows (repeat)
