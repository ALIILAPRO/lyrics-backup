		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Should I sing you a happy song
With a noose around my neck?
Apologize for bleeding
When you stab me in the back

You're controlling me
You tie me up like a puppet
Then you pull my strings
Try to turn me into something
That I'll never be
I'm a shell of what I was
I'm tired of being someone else
Let me be myself

All you wanna do
Is tell me how to live my life and what to choose
It's got me feeling like I'm flying by a noose
I see that smile, guess my misery is brightening your mood

Should I sing you a happy song
With a noose around my neck?
Apologize for bleeding
When you stab me in the back, yeah
I think you like when
I'm fucking dying 'cause
It feels like I'm killing myself

There's a hole in me
Where you cut me from my spirit
Yeah, you torture me
And act like I should thank you for the suffering
It's killing me inside
I'm tired of being someone else
Let me be myself

I'm sorry for the mess
I wouldn't noticed if you stabbed me in the chest
You had a motive that I never could've guessed
You tried to choke me then you cut me up for holding in my breath

Should I sing you a happy song
With a noose around my neck?
Apologize for bleeding
When you stab me in the back, yeah
I think you like when
I'm fucking dying 'cause
It feels like I'm killing myself
Just to make you happy

I'm killing myself, killing myself
Yeah, are you happy now?

Can I sing you a happy song
With a noose around my neck?
Apologize for bleeding
When you stab me in the back, yeah
I think you like when
I'm fucking dying 'cause
It feels like I'm killing myself

Should I sing you a happy song
With a noose around my neck?
Apologize for bleeding
When you stab me in the back, yeah
I think you like when
I'm fucking dying 'cause
It feels like I'm killing myself
Just to make you happy

Does it make you happy?
Does it make you happy?
Does it make you happy?
Tell me, are you happy now?
