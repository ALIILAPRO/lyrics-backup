		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I didn't want to know
I just didn't want to know
Best to keep things in the shallow end
'Cause I never quite learned how to swim
I just didn't want to know
(Didn't want, didn't want)

Close my eyes just to look at you
Taken by this seamless vision
I close my eyes
Ignore the smoke
Ignore the smoke
Ignore the smoke

Call an optimist, she's turning blue
Such a lovely color for you
Call an optimist, she's turning blue
While I just sit and stare at you

Because I don't want to know
I didn't want to know
I just didn't want to know
I just didn't want

Mistook the nods for an approval
Just ignore the smoke and smile

Call an optimist, she's turning blue
Such a lovely color for you
Call an optimist, she's turning blue
Such a perfect color for your eyes
Call an optimist, she's turning blue
Such a lovely color for you
Call an optimist, she's turning blue
While I just sit and stare at you

I don't want to know
