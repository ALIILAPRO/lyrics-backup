		<p>
		  Oh
Ooh, yeah
Don't wanna be a player (T.S.)

I don't wanna be a player no more
I'm not a player, I just crush a lot
But me and Punisher still got what you're lookin' for
For my thugs, for my thugs (don't wanna be, don't wanna be)
I don't wanna be a player no more
I'm not a player, I just crush a lot
But you know Big Pun and Joe are still down by law
Who's down to crush tonight?

Hey yo, I'm still not a playa but you still a hater
Elevator to the top, hah, see you later, I'm gone
Penthouse suite, Penthouse freaks
In house beach, French count sheets, ten thou a piece
Rent-out lease, with a option to buy
Coppin' a 5 or Benz for when I'm not far up in the sky
Puffin' the lye with my Twinzito
Up in the Benzito with my kiko from Queens, nicknamed Perico
We go back like PAs and wearin' PJs
Now we reached the peak age, runnin' trains for three days
Who wanna ride? It won't cost you a dollar
Whether soft or harder, of course you still gonna holla
Mama, I'm thick (ugh), I rip my through your hooters
I'm sick, you couldn't measure my with six rulers
Hold up, Chula, I'm all about gettin' loot
But I knock that boot if you out to get koofed

I don't wanna be a player no more
I'm not a player, I just crush a lot (no more)
But me and Punisher still got what you're lookin' for
Uptown, baby, Uptown
I don't wanna be a player no more
I'm not a player, I just crush a lot (don't wanna be a player)
But you know Big Pun and Joe are still down by law
Who's down to crush tonight?

I love from butter pecan to blackberry molass'
I don't discriminate, I regulate every shade of the (ugh)
Long as you show class and pass my test
Fat breasts, highly intelligent bachelorettes
That's the best, I won't settle for less
I wanna get a brunette with unforgettable sex
I lay your head on my chest, come feel my heartbeat
We can park the Jeep, pump Mobb Deep, and just spark the leaf
It's hard to creep since I found Joe
Every pretty round brown, wanna go down low
But this Boogie Down professional, I'ma let you know
Once I put the blows, get your clothes 'cause you got to go
Out the door downstairs, little brown hairs everywhere
(You nasty, Twin) I don't care
Round here they call me Big Pun, if you with the big guns
Thick tongue, known to make a chick

Up in the hot tub, poppin' bubbly
Rubbin' your spot, love, got you screamin', "Punish me"
But it don't stop, watch the Pun get wicked
When I stick it even Luke be like, "Don't stop, get it get it"

Up in the hot tub, poppin' bubbly
Rubbin' your spot, love, got you screamin', "Punish me"
But it don't stop, watch the Pun get wicked
When I stick it even Luke be like, "Don't stop, get it get it"

I don't wanna be a player no more (Punisher, Punisher, Punisher, Big Punisher)
But me and Punisher still got what you're lookin for (Punisher, ooh Big Punisher)
I don't wanna be a player no more (Punisher, Punisher, Punisher, Big Punisher)
But you know Big Pun and Joe still down by law (Punisher, ooh Big Punisher)
Who's down to crush tonight?

Boricua, morena, boricua, morena
Boricua, morena, boricua, morena
Boricua, morena, boricua, morena

No more rolling with an entourage
Unless it's Pun and the Terror Squad

Punisher, Punisher, Punisher, Big Punisher
Punisher, Joe and Big Punisher

Boricua, morena, boricua, morena
Boricua, morena, boricua, morena
Boricua, morena, boricua, morena
Boricua, morena, boricua, morena
Boricua, morena, boricua, morena
Boricua, morena, boricua, morena
