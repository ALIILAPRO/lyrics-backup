		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go from A to the B, cross an ocean, cross a sea
‘cause I think I like you, I think I do.
You can't deny I deserve it if you try
‘cause I think I like you, I think I do.

When you see me, when you look at me
You find pleasure, you can't hide it no, you can't hide it mhm

But I know that it's all up to me
‘cause you can't understand that a girl such as me says:
Please sweep me off my feet!

Go from A to the B, cross an ocean, cross a sea
‘cause I think I like you, I think I do.
You can't deny I deserve it if you try
‘cause I think I like you, I think I do.

Work for me work for me don't you give up – aha
A to the B I don't want much – aha.
Work for me work for me don't you give up – aha
A to the B, from A to the B aha.

All my life yeah every boy I liked
I'd persuade him and he'd love it yeah he'd love me for it

But now I'm fed up it is time
For a change why don't you try arrange somethin' nice
All it takes is one little thrill!

Go from A to the B, cross an ocean, cross a sea
‘cause I think I like you, I think I do.
You can't deny I deserve it if you try
‘cause I think I like you, I think I do.

Work for me work for me don't you give up – aha
A to the B I don't want much – aha.
Work for me work for me don't you give up – aha
A to the B, from A to the B aha.

You see, it seems to me that all us strong,
Independent women make men lazy.
All of a sudden they think they don't have to court us properly.
But boys let me tell you something:
There's nothing like a man who knows how to treat a lady.

Baby every day I hope and pray
That you will be mine the old-fashioned way.
‘N you ought to know;
I just need a gentleman to pamper me right.

Go from A to the B, cross an ocean, cross a sea
‘cause I think I like you, I think I do.
You can't deny I deserve it if you try
‘cause I think I like you

Go from A to the B, cross an ocean, cross a sea
‘cause I think I like you, I think I do.
You can't deny I deserve it if you try
‘cause I think I like you, I think I do.

Work for me work for me don't you give up – aha
A to the B I don't want much – aha.
Work for me work for me don't you give up – aha
A to the B, from A to the B aha.
