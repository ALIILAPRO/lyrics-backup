		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Steal my love, no I don't want it that bad
So steal my love, no I don’t want it that bad

Come catch a vibe like no
Other that you'll ever find
You're so divine come get entangled
In this web of mine
Love’s a drug so addicting do you dare to try
We'll be so high I just hope
You ain't afraid of heights
And every time I get around
You swear I'm paralyzed
Them other man tried to lay you
On a bed of lies
But not me lil mama swear I'm different
Your last man was Trippin so I
Think it's best you ditch him

No I don't want it that bad so, steal my love
No I don't want it that bad, So steal my love

And lil mama hit my line
I won’t waste your time
The only thing on my mind is
Tryna to make you mine
Wine and dine little mama let me take you out
Then afterwards let me take you
Home and break you down yeah
And if you wit it just hit me up
Name the time in the place I’ll pick you up
Don't get it twisted I ain’t trying
To just dick you down
I need someone that'll stick around, OK

No I don't want it that bad so, steal my love
No I don't want it that bad, So steal my love
