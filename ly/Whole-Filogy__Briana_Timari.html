		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come in love
This ain't just common love
The stories they wrote for us
cre a thousand years old
Pick it up
The pen other lovers dropped
cnd color a page for us
Sincere as stone
Blur the edges of the world you know
Fall into me let the spaces close
Whole, whole
Tie them up
cll of your broken chords
Cut by another's words
It's time to let it go
cnd fill your cup
Don't give away too much
It's give and take with us
cnd here is home
Once a silhouette of all you are
Now the vacancy inside my heart
Is whole, whole
Taking in the motions
You were moving like a poet
I was falling, I was falling for you
We were falling into chorus
You were wading in the water
Dancing through your karma
I was falling, I was falling for you
We were falling into chorus
I was taking in the motions
You were moving like a poet
I was falling, I was falling for you
We were falling into chorus
Falling in, we're falling into chorus
Falling in, we're falling in, we're falling in
Falling in, we're falling in
