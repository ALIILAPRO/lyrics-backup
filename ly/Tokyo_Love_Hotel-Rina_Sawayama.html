		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tokyo
Tokyo (people don't know, with the taking)
(Until it's gone)

You got that something that everyone wants
You got that movie star glow
You got them asking to have you on their skin
Even though, they don't know, yeah

They don't know you like I know you
No they don't
Use you for one night and then away they go
Thought I was original but after all
I guess this is just another song 'bout Tokyo (Tokyo)

I don't wanna check into the Tokyo Love Hotel
I just want your love all to myself
Everybody's staying at the Tokyo Love Hotel
I just want your love all to myself
Tokyo
Tokyo
Tokyo
I guess this is just another song 'bout Tokyo

And oh there's nothing that I could say
That hasn't already been said
You got that neon lights, golden guy
Falling for a stereotype
Has it all gone to your head?

'Cause they don't know you like I know you
No they don't
Use you for one night and then away they go
All their love for you is simply just for show
I guess this is just another song 'bout Tokyo (Tokyo)

I don't wanna check into the Tokyo Love Hotel
I just want your love all to myself
Everybody's staying at the Tokyo Love Hotel
I just want your love all to myself
Tokyo
Tokyo (I just want your love)
Tokyo (to myself)
I guess this is just another song 'bout Tokyo, ooh

If you've been through what I have
Then you know what is true love
Yes I see, yeah I see you now
(Yeah I see you now)

Holding years, for you in here
Spend my nights shutting you up
Yes I see, yeah I see you now
Yeah, I see you now

I don't wanna check into the Tokyo Love Hotel
I just want your love all to myself
Everybody's staying at the Tokyo Love Hotel
I just want your love all to myself
Tokyo
Tokyo (I just want your love for myself)
Tokyo (yeah, your fascination's my world)
Tokyo (yeah, your fascination's my world)
Tokyo (yeah, your fascination's my world)
Tokyo (yeah, your fascination's my world)
Tokyo (yeah, your fascination's my world)
Tokyo (yeah, your fascination's my world)
Tokyo
Tokyo
Tokyo
