		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My heart was stolen by a blind pickpocket
In the deep city streets in the summer of 2012
And I never even saw her face
My dreams were shattered like a stained glass window
Jesus in Pieces! I believe I threw a brick right through Him
But my memory could not be saved
It just seems unlikely that it's me who was to blame
So I bookmark my DSM 'cause I need to remember my place

This is not enough
This is not enough to prove it yet
No, I need to hit the bottom
This is not enough
This is not enough to prove it yet
No, I need to hit the bottom

Gotta get to the bottom of this
Gotta get to the bottom of this
Gotta get to the bottom of this
Take you with me

My soul was crushed like a tall boy
Underneath the boots on the curb
And Iâ€™m still picking up my molars
And putting them back in my face
My name was soiled by a last call spill
With a backwash swill and the blackout killed me
Sober on impact from a fall from grace
â€‹
Take the road on higher ground
And tell me â€œDonâ€™t look down! Youâ€™ll fall and break your back.â€
But that just reminds me how thereâ€™s more to be found beneath the black


This is not enough
This is not enough to prove it yet
No, I need to hit the bottom
This is not enough
This is not enough to prove it yet
No, I need to hit the bottom

Gotta get to the bottom of this
Gotta get to the bottom of this
Gotta get to the bottom of this
Take you with me

Bottle, well, or barrel? All are empty
Dug, or drank, or poured it out
When too much is not enough thereâ€™s plenty more
Where that came from around
Looking up we see the point of entry
Between where we are and weâ€™ve been
Looking up I could say Heaven sent me
Hand me my shovel, Iâ€™m going in
Looking up we see the point of entry
Between where we are and weâ€™ve been
Looking down I could say Heaven sent me
Hand me my shovel, Iâ€™m going in

Gotta get to the bottom of this
Gotta get to the bottom of this
Gotta get to the bottom of this
Gotta gotta get, gotta gotta get, gotta get
Gotta get to the bottom of this
Gotta gotta get, gotta gotta get, gotta get
Gotta get to the bottom of this
Gotta gotta get, gotta gotta get, gotta get
Gotta get to the bottom of this
If it kills me
Gotta gotta get, gotta ow!
Gotta get to the bottom of this
Gotta get to the bottom of this
Gotta get to the bottom of this
If it kills me

This is not enough
This is not enough to prove it yet
No, I need to hit the bottom
This is not enough
This is not enough to prove it yet
No, I need to hit the bottom
This is not enough
This is not enough to prove it yet
No, I need to hit the bottom
This is not enough
This is not enough to prove it yet
No, I need to hit the bottom
