		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A woman can change a man
If she loves him, the way that I´m in love with you
I know it, I know that I can
If it´s the last thing, the last thing I´d ever do

So you may still feel the same old yearning
Believe me the flame will soon stop burning

A woman can change a man
If she stays with him whatever maybe in store for her
So just put, your trust in me
I´ll never hurt you baby, I´ll never desert you babe

It feels so good just to be near you
To feel your lips, to see and hear you
Ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...

I´ll be forever your shadow, walking next to you
Caring for you, is what I won´t do for you baby
A woman can change a man
Make him want her, and make him want to be with her
Oh baby I´ve no secret plans
I just hope in my heart, someday you´ll be free of her

So you may still feel the same old yearning
Believe me the flame will soon stop burning

Ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...
Ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...
