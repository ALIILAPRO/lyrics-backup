		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Silence drowns the whisperin' wind
The quiet commands the waverin' of my heart
As it embarks chasin' lost phenomenons
At any cost and far beyond any path
Into the dark

The unexplained, the unattained
The emptiness, the thrill of what could await
When I look up

Under the sky, it never ends
The shadows as they dance
Some kind of magic in the air
And it doesn't matter where I am
I'm lost within a trance
All of this magic in the air, woo

I lived and died a thousand times
And done my time for countless
Crimes of the heart
Put it apart (Put it apart)
But for all my  no lack of tryin'
I can't deny the miracle in your eyes
And they ignite, woo

Under the sky, it never ends
The shadows as they dance
Some kind of magic in the air
And it doesn't matter where I am
I'm lost within a trance
All of this magic in the air, woo

Under the sky, it never ends
The shadows as they dance
Some kind of magic in the air
And it doesn't matter where I am
I never understand
All of this magic in the air

Woo oh woo oh
Woo oh it's in the air
