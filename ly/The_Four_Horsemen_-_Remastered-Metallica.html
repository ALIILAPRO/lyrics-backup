		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  By the last breath of the fourth winds blow 
Better raise your ears 
The sound of hooves knocks at your door 
Lock up your wife and children now 
It's time to wield the blade 
For now you have got some company 

The horsemen are drawing nearer 
On the leather steeds they ride 
They have come to take your life 
On through the dead of night 
With the four horsemen ride 
Or choose your fate and die 

Oh yeah yeah
You have been dying since the day you were born 
You know it has all been planned 
The quartet of deliverance rides 
A sinner once a sinner twice 
No need for confession now 
'Cause now you have got the fight of your life 

The horsemen are drawing nearer 
On the leather steeds they ride 
They have come to take your life 
On through the dead of night 
With the four horsemen ride 
Or choose your fate and die 

Oh yeah yeah

Time has taken its toll on you 
The lines that crack your face 
Famine, your body it has torn through 
Withered in every place 
Pestilence, for what you have had to endure 
And what you have put others through 
Death, deliverance for you for sure 
There is nothing you can do 

So gather round young warriors now 
And saddle up your steeds 
Killing scores with demon swords 
Now is the death of doers of wrong 
Swing the judgment hammer down 
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat 

The horsemen are drawing nearer 
On the leather steeds they ride 
They have come to take your life 
On through the dead of night 
With the four horsemen ride 
Or choose your fate and die

Oh yeah yeah
