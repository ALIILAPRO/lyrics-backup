		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I need you
I just close my eyes and I'm with you
And all that I so what to give you
It's only a heart beat away

When I need love 
I hold out my hands and I touch love
I never knew there was so much love
Keeping me warm night and day

Miles and miles of empty space in between us
The telephone can't take the place of your smile
But you know I won't be traveling forever
It's cold out, so hold out, and do like I do

When I need you
I just close my eyes and I'm with you
And all that I so want to give you
It's only a heart beat away

It's not easy when the road is your driver
Honey that's a heavey load that we bear
But you know I won't be traveling a lifetime
It's cold out, so hold out, and do like I do
When I need you

When I need love
I hold out my hands and I touch love
I never knew there was so much love

Keeping me warm night and day
When I need you
I just close my eyes
And you're right by my side

Keeping me warm night and day
I just hold out my hand, hold out my hand)
And I'm with you
All I want to give you

It's only a heart beat away
When I need you
