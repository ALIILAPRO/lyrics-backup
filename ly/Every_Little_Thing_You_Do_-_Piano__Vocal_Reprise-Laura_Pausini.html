		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you listen to my heart
Ooh, I like it
When you touch me I get so excited
And I never thought that I would say
I'm gone away and so into
Every little thing you do

When you look at me that way
Oh, it moves me
When you take my hand, the love
Goes right through me
And the reason that it feels so good
Is because you put your heart into
Every little thing you do

You're the rhythm in my song
You're the switch that turns me on
The only place where I belong or want to be with you
You're the half that makes me whole
The only one who sees my soul
Baby it's so real but still I can't believe
Every little thing you do to me

I like it

Even in the night
When you're not here with me
My sweetest dreams
Still take me to
Every little thing you do

Every little thing you do to me
