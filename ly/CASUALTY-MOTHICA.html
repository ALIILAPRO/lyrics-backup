		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a masochist, I get my fix from feeling nothing
Hospitals at twenty-four, alone and self-destructive
Long nights to quiet my mind with empty conversations
Destroyed the life in my eyes, "I swear I'm gonna change" (yeah)

I won't be a casualty
A product of my agony
Blame my bloodline
Feel the pain and then kill it twice
I won't be a casualty
No, I won't go down like that

No, I won't go down like that
No, I won't go down like 

Six feet under
What would everybody say? I wonder
She was throwing back shots and she couldn't even talk
Just another O.D., what a bummer

They say one is too many
When enough is enough
These thoughts get too heavy
When my heart weighs a ton

I won't be a casualty
A product of my agony
Blame my bloodline
Feel the pain and then kill it twice
I won't be a casualty
No, I won't go down like that

No, I won't go down like that
No, I won't go down like that
No, I won't go down like that

I won't be a casualty
A product of my agony
Blame my bloodline
Feel the pain and then kill it twice
I won't be a casualty
No, I won't go down like that
