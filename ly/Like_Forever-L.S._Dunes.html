		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw it break
Cut through the other side
Wide awake
Lost the vision
Lost his sight
There's nothing anyone can do to change your mind

If you get high again
Spinning off a giant rote
Never knowing what it is
Dream of going after it
The consequence
I tried to keep it hidden
Keep your eyes to yourself
The common threat
Dilate to keep it simple
You can't deny what you're fed

Go through it all at once
(You've got no witness to your photograph)
Tap dancing on the edge
(You've got to seal the code in 5G tied)
Go through it all at once
They've got no way to prove that it was me
(Don't think to save)

Our light will lead fair
Arriving after the veiled affair
On everybody's unvaccinated lungs

The common thread
Dilate to keep it simple
You better watch where you shit

Go through it all at once
(You've got no witness to your photograph)
Try dancing on the edge
(You've got to seal the code in 5G tied)
Go through it all at once
(You've got no way to prove that it was me)
Don't think to serve

You say it best when you say nothing at all
When you say nothing at all
When you say nothing at all
(Go through it all at once)
You say it best when you say nothing at all
When you say nothing at all
When you say nothing at all
(Go through it all at once)
You say it best when you say nothing at all
When you say nothing at all
When you say nothing at all
(Go through it all at once)
