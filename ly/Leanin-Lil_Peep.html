		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Catch a feelin' for me
Catch a feelin' for me
Catch a feelin' for my lifestyle (feelin' for my lifestyle)

Poppin' pills for free
Poppin' pills for free
Pop that pussy for me right now (right now)
Leanin' back in my seat
Leanin' back in my seat
Got me thinkin' 'bout my life now (life now)
I wish that I could see you right now (right now)
Bury me with all the lights out

Woke up surprised
Am I really alive?
I was trying to die last night
I survived suicide last night
Woke up surprised
Am I really alive?
I was tryin' to die last night
I survived suicide last night

Catch a feelin' for me
Catch a feelin' for me
Catch a feelin' for my lifestyle (feelin' for my lifestyle)

Poppin' pills for free
Poppin' pills for free
Pop that pussy for me right now (right now)
Leanin' back in my seat
Leanin' back in my seat
Got me thinkin' 'bout my life now (life now)
I wish that I could see you right now (right now)
Bury me with all the lights out

Woke up surprised
Am I really alive?
I was trying to die last night
I survived suicide last night
Woke up surprised
Am I really alive?
I was tryin' to die last night
I survived suicide last night

Everything you say about me
All I ever think about
Every time I hear your name it
Makes me wanna fuckin' shout
Everything you say about me
All I ever think about
Every time I hear your name it
Makes me wanna fuckin' shout

I can't feel the tension, we know
We can't feel the tension, I know
You can't feel the tension, let's just
Run away forever, let's just
Catch a feelin' for me
Catch a feelin' for me
Catch a feelin' for my lifestyle (feelin' for my lifestyle)
Poppin' pills for free
Poppin' pills for free
Pop that pussy for me right now (right now)
