You know who it is, when you hear that
Lil Pump (huh)
Montana (haan)
Mally Mall

What I'm supposed to do? (huh?)
What I'm supposed to do? (yeah)
What I'm supposed to do? (huh?)
What I'm supposed to do? (yeah)
I'm surrounded by all these bad bitches, but I only want two (two)
I'm surrounded by bad bitches, but I only want two (yeah, yeah, yeah, two)

What I'm supposed to do? (huh?)
What I'm supposed to do? (yeah)
What I'm supposed to do? (huh?)
What I'm supposed to do? (yeah)
I'm surrounded by all these bad bitches, but I only want two (two)
I'm surrounded by bad bitches, but I only want two (yeah, yeah, yeah, two)

What I'm supposed to do? (do)
Pick 'em by the two (two)
Smellin' like gelato (gelato) when I'm walkin' through
Surrounded by some scammer bitches, but I want you (ooh)
Space coupe, UFO, take off, vroom (vroom)
Chopper bite, achoo (achoo)
Dropped 30 on some shoes (ooh ooh)
Fuck you and your crew (your crew)
Panties on the roof (doo doo)
I took you to Calabasas, now I like you (I do)
My bitch cannot wear no UGG's, she got Chanel boots (Chanel)
All these Lambos in my driveways, what I'm supposed to do? (do)
How I'm supposed to move? (walk), let me play with your cooch
Bitches in my room and I left them for you (for you)
She might be a thot but I'm a thot too (ooh ooh)

What I'm supposed to do? (huh?)
What I'm supposed to do? (yeah)
What I'm supposed to do? (huh?)
What I'm supposed to do? (yeah)
I'm surrounded by all these bad bitches, but I only want two (two)
I'm surrounded by bad bitches, but I only want two (yeah, yeah, yeah, two)

What I'm supposed to do? (huh?)
What I'm supposed to do? (yeah)
What I'm supposed to do? (huh?)
What I'm supposed to do? (yeah)
I'm surrounded by all these bad bitches, but I only want two (two)
I'm surrounded by bad bitches, but I only want two (yeah, yeah, yeah, two)
(Ayy Pump, we out here, Montana!)

Bad bitches all around me, hundred acres keep me grounded (grounded)
Phantom speedin' through Calabasas, like Robert Downey (haan)
Hottest in my town, talk the sauce, fuckin' drowning (haan)
Turn it to the max, 'til he free Max out the county, (haan)
I got choppas that'll lift up thirty bouncers (yeah)
Talk the drip, sell it bottled up in 20 ounces
Drip, drip, drip, yeah, 30 fountains (Migos)
30 birds, like the Falcons
Number one in 30 countries (haan)
I need two-piece and a biscuit (biscuit)
Groupies and a mistress (mistress)
Chain piece, like a diss track
On two p's gettin' lifted (lifed)
Nigga, I'm the truth, coupe lookin' like a torpedo
Carlito's Way, and got the album on the way
Montana!

What I'm supposed to do? (huh?)
What I'm supposed to do? (yeah)
What I'm supposed to do? (huh?)
What I'm supposed to do? (yeah)
I'm surrounded by all these bad bitches, but I only want two (two)
I'm surrounded by bad bitches, but I only want two (yeah, yeah, yeah, two)

I want a two-piece (I really want her)
I want a two-piece (I really want her)
I want a two-piece (I really want her)
I want a two-piece (I really want her)
I want a two-piece (I really want her)
I want a two-piece (I really want her)
I want a two-piece (I really want her)
I want a two-piece (I really want her, ooh)
