		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm tired of my life.
I feel so in between.
I'm sick of all my friends, girls can be so mean
I feel like throwin' out everything I wear
I'm startin' over new,
Cause I'm not even there.

Sometimes,
I wanna get away some place,
But I don't wanna stay too long.
Sometimes,
I want a brand new day,
Trying to fit in where I don't belong

Hook hook me up.
I wanna feel the rain in my hair.
Hook hook me up.
Where should we go I don't even care.

Anywhere is good enough.
Hook me up.
Hook me up.

I like the lights turned out,
The sound of closing doors.
I'm not like other girls,
Who always feel so sure.
Of everything they are,
Of what their gonna be.
Sometimes I'm just a girl stuck inside of me (of me)

Sometimes,
I wanna disappear some place,
But I don't wanna stay too long.
Sometimes,
I'm feeling so alone,
Trying to fit in where I don't belong.

Hook hook me up.
I wanna feel the rain in my hair.
Hook hook me up.
Where should we go I don't even care.

Anywhere is good enough.
Hook me up.
Hook me up.
Anywhere is good enough
Hook me up

Not gonna crash and burn,
I'm gonna find a way,
Nothing left to say

Hook hook me up.
I wanna feel the rain in my hair.
Hook hook me up.
Where should we go I don't even care.

Hook hook me up.
I wanna feel the rain in my hair.
Hook hook me up.
Where should we go I don't even care.

Anywhere is good enough
Hook me up
Hook me up
Hook me up
