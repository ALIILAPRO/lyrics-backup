		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been goin' through some things
I struggle with my inner man
I hustle, I'll do what I
I've been goin' through some i've been goin'
I've been, III

I guess, I gotta do some things
'Cause we been long doin' some things
I've been swervin', I'm swervin'
We've been swervin', we swervin'
I guess I gotta do some things
It is six in the mornin'
We have sex in the mornin' why is you callin
Yeah, I know that you want it
But my mind it ain't on it, no
My mind it ain't on it
She prolly gotta do some things
Been workin', been workin'
I'm drivin' a coupe now
Circles in circles, we stuck in a loop now
If I say that I love you, then I'm on the way
If you tell me you love me
Convince me to stay oh
I guess, you gotta do some things
'Cause we been long doin' some things
We've been swervin', we swervin'
We've been swervin', we swervin'
I guess we gotta do some things

Couldn't pick up my phone
It's on one percent
Couldn't pick up my phone
It's on one percent
Couldn't pick up my phone
It's on one percent it's on one percent
So I cannot get back to you
So I cannot get back to you
