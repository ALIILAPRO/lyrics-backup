Ceiling fan crew
Phew, phew, phew
Phew, phew, phew, phew
Phew, phew, phew, phew, phew
Ceiling fan crew
Phew, phew, phew
Phew, phew, phew, phew
Phew, phew, phew, phew, phew

Ceiling fan crew 'cause we spin a lot
Ceiling fan crew 'cause we spin a lot
Ceiling fan crew 'cause we spin a lot
Ceiling fan crew 'cause we spin a lot

Opps see me and turn around like they in Vlone (what?)
Walkin' with that glizzy, see it pokin' like a broke bone
If I pull it out my pants, bitch, I'm bustin' ain't no hold on
Let it sing, you gon' feel it in yo' soul like a slow song
Gon' feel it in yo' body-ody
She say you got everybody
I can fuck no anybody
Come give me that lady-dady
I like all my money neat
I like all my toppy sloppy
Nigga better not fuck with me
This chopper I got do karate

Ceiling fan crew
Phew, phew, phew
Phew, phew, phew, phew
Phew, phew, phew, phew, phew
Ceiling fan crew
Phew, phew, phew
Phew, phew, phew, phew
Phew, phew, phew, phew, phew

Ceiling fan crew 'cause we spin a lot
Ceiling fan crew 'cause we spin a lot
Ceiling fan crew 'cause we spin a lot
Ceiling fan crew 'cause we spin a lot

Phew, phew, phew
Phew, phew, phew, phew, phew
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

Ceiling fan you
Ceiling fan, who?
Blowers in the whip, this a ceiling fan coupe
Ceiling fan crew (grraow)
This ceiling fan new
She blow me everyday that's my ceiling fan boo
Ceiling fan, ooh (grraow)
Ceiling fan, boom (grraow)
Bullet in the barrel, that's the ceiling fan view (grraow, grraow, grraow)
Ceiling fan one (grraow), ceiling fan two (grraow)
We some animals with blowers, it's a ceiling fan zoo
Ceiling fan bang (grraow), ceiling fan, boom (grraow)
Now you leakin' red, call that ceiling fan juice

Ceiling fan crew
Phew, phew, phew
Phew, phew, phew, phew
Phew, phew, phew, phew, phew
Ceiling fan crew
Phew, phew, phew
Phew, phew, phew, phew
Phew, phew, phew, phew, phew

Ceiling fan crew 'cause we spin a lot
Ceiling fan crew 'cause we spin a lot
Ceiling fan crew 'cause we spin a lot
Ceiling fan crew 'cause we spin a lot
