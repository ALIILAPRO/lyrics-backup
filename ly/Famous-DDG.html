		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fall in love I hate that shit
Knocking me off my grind I can't fuck with relationships
I ain't even got enough time in a day for me to chase a bitch
I don't even ask for much I ask you to do the basic shit
Hardest thing I did was fall in love with a famous bitch
Fans all on my penis, too much stress don't need it
If you see me tweet don't read it, I swear I'll delete it
Sometimes I feel so defeated, broken hearts repeated
Said "I love you" did you mean it? Why don't I believe it?

I'm trynna figure out what we gon' do
How we gonna get to the top?
Filming a movie now you kissing dudes
You know I love you a lot
I don't give a fuck if that shit for promo
I don't wanna see this shit no more
Why is you holding hands in the photo
You know I'm insecure that's a no-no
I keep coming back, when they leave but I'm too attached
Take you shoppin', I'm thumbin through racks
Ain't no limit I'm spending the max
All these niggas that be in your dm's trynna tell you they proud
But them motherfuckers don't even know you, so I wanna know how
But I know that's just part of the game, all these industry niggas is lame
They just want you cause you got a name 
And because you the girl that I claim
All these motherfuckers all in my business
They be stressing me out on some real shit
I get so high I can't feel shit, I get so high

Fall in love I hate that shit
Knocking me off my grind I can't fuck with relationships
I ain't even got enough time in a day for me to chase a bitch
I don't even ask for much I ask you to do the basic shit
Hardest thing I did was fall in love with a famous bitch
Fans all on my penis, too much stress don't need it
If you see me tweet don't read it I swear I'll delete it
Sometimes I feel so defeated, broken hearts repeated
Said "I love you" did you mean it? Why don't I believe it?

I be so insecure that I be thinking you really be fucking niggas
You in movies with but on the internet I just be coolin' it 
But in my head a nigga really losing it 
Gotta be payin' good cause you keep doing it 
I might tweet somethin' just to ruin it, I got a platform I'm abusin' it
It's a couple things about your job I wanna know
When you shoot your movie do this niggas turn you on? 
When you leave the set do y'all still text each other phone? 
Just because they filmin it, it don't mean that it ain't wrong

Fall in love I hate that shit
Knocking me off my grind I can't fuck with relationships
I ain't even got enough time in a day for me to chase a bitch
I don't even ask for much I ask you to do the basic shit
Hardest thing I did was fall in love with a famous bitch
Fans all on my penis, too much stress don't need it
If you see me tweet don't read it I swear I'll delete it
Sometimes I feel so defeated, broken hearts repeated
Said "I love you" did you mean it? Why don't I believe it?

Why don't I believe it?
Why don't I believe it?
Why, why don't I believe it?
Why don't I believe it?
Why don't I believe it?

It's a couple things about your job I wanna know
When you shoot your movie do this niggas turn you on? 
When you leave the set do y'all still text each other phone? 
Just because they filmin it, it don't mean that it ain't wrong
