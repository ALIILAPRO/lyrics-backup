		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Only mistake
You gave me 365 days
But nothing could ever make me be
Next to you
I've tried so hard
But no one's perfect enough
But when you're alone
There's something so sweet
About death
'Cause when you are gone
I've lost myself away
And I've never wanted to feel so wrong
When I'm in love with you

I follow your step
I'll never leave you again
'Cause when I'm with you
It feels like home again
I've missed you touch
I want to drown in your eyes
And look at us now
No one is perfect enough
'Cause when you're gone
I've lost myself away
And I've never wanted to feel so wrong
When I'm in love

Your lips like poison
Our hearts so broken
No one believed we don't care
We've made bad choices
Our souls were frozen
Now we are here ones again
And I've never wanted to feel so wrong
When I'm in love with you
