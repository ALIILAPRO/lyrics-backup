[sample: "give me summer"] x2 



Broken darkness my cold end 
I look for places I've never seen 
Nothing moves but the quiet on the street 
Now I open my eyes to this 
Isolated walking long hard hours 
Winter cold just brings me winter showers 
It's so brutal with the cold sky 
Wrapped in cold late at night 

[sample: "give me summer"] x2 

Come clean  there's no sun yet 
The only lights here are made 
I can't speak, I can't hear, but I know I'm real 
There's no warm here anyway 
The darkest lights before the dawn 
You remember the sun but it sank 
In the water that eats the light 
Wrapped in cold late at night 

[sample: "give me summer"] x2 

I open my eyes, it's cold 
The only souls go by 
Lift the bridge out of the water 
The stone black light 
Living is easy when it's night 
The cold has covered the rain 
I can see forever, to the deep 
Wrapped in cold, late at night 

[sample: "give me summer"] x4
