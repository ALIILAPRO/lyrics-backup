		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In my head I hear a million conversations
I'm spinning out, don't wake me up until the end
The rivers flowing in denial I can't fake it
I'm paranoid that all my thoughts are all my friends

I got
Blood in my chest
Fight in my step
No sleep no rest
No sleep no rest
Sparks in my brain
Am I insane
Trying to light the flame
Trying to light it

All these thoughts I battle creeping up my skin, creeping up my skin
Fears they try to rattle who I am within, where do I begin
It's one of those days, my world is crashing everything looks on fire
It's one of those nights, I'm dreaming but I'm walking on a wire
All these thoughts I battle creepin' up my skin, burn 'em from within like
Fire
Fire

Run away, I'm going faster if I want to
On a journey, on a mission, never left
No more doubt, no more running from the half truth
I'm a fighter, lighting fires, knock 'em dead got

I got
Blood in my chest
Fight in my step
No sleep no rest
No sleep no rest
Sparks in my brain
Am I insane
Trying to light the flame
Trying to light it

All these thoughts I battle creeping up my skin, creeping up my skin
Fears they try to rattle who I am within, where do I begin
It's one of those days, my world is crashing everything looks on fire
It's one of those nights, I'm dreaming but I'm walking on a wire
All these thoughts I battle creepin' up my skin, burn 'em from within like
Fire
Let it rain, let it rain
Through the pain through the pain like
Fire
Let it rain, let it rain
Through the pain through the pain like

Clench my teeth, I need to end this conservation
Strike a match 'cause now it's time to hit reset
No more doubt, no more running from the half truth
I'm a fighter, lighting fires, knock em dead

All these thoughts I battle creeping up my skin, creeping up my skin
Fears they try to rattle who I am within, where do I begin
It's one of those days, my world is crashing everything looks on fire
It's one of those nights, I'm dreaming but I'm walking on a wire
All these thoughts I battle creepin' up my skin, burn 'em from within like
Fire
Let it rain, let it rain
Through the pain through the pain like
Fire
Let it rain, let it rain
Through the pain through the pain like

Let it rain, let it rain
Through the pain through the pain
