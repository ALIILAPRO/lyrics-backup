		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't run from me, river
Don't run from me river, river
No, don't run from me, river
Don't run from me river, river

Look, you can play it cool
Act like you don't care
River, don't be cruel
You're pushin' me away
Don't want to get hurt
So you hurt me first
With the words you say

Maybe you should fall
That's what rivers do
'Cause when you're in love
You don't mind a different view
Things are lookin' up

Oh, river (river, river)
Don't run (run, run)
Don't run (river, river)
Don't run (run, run)
Oh, river (river, river)
Don't run (run, run)
Don't run (river, river)
From our love (run, run)

Look, darlin', don't give up
When the water's rough
Where you gonna go?
My heart is your home
Nothin' is as cold
As runnin' on your own
So river, don't you rush

Maybe you should fall
That's what rivers do
'Cause when you're in love
You don't mind a different view
Things are lookin' up

Oh, river (river, river)
Don't run (run, run)
Don't run (river, river)
Don't run (run, run)
Oh, river (river, river)
Don't run (run, run)
Don't run (river, river)
From our love (run, run)

Don't run from me, river
Don't run from me river, river
No, don't run from me, river
Don't run from me river, river
No, don't run from me, river
Don't run from me river, river
No, don't run from me, river

Maybe you should fall
That's what rivers do
'Cause when you're in love
You don't mind a different view
Things are lookin' up

Oh, river (river, river)
Don't run (run, run)
Don't run (river, river)
Don't run (run, run)
Oh, river (river, river)
Don't run (run, run)
Don't run (river, river)
From our love (run, run)

Oh, river (river, river) (don't run from me, river)
Don't run (run, run) (don't run from me river, river)
Don't run (river, river) (no, don't run from me, river)
Don't run (run, run) (don't run from me river, river)
Oh, river (river, river) (don't run from me, river)
Don't run (run, run) (don't run from me river, river)
Don't run (river, river) (no, don't run from me, river)
From our love (run, run) (don't run from me river, river)
No
