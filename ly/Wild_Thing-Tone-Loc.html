		  Let's do it

Workin' all week, 9 to 5 for my money
So when the weekend comes I go get live with the honey
Rollin' down the street, I saw this girl and she was pumpin'
I winked my eye, she got into the ride, went to a club, was jumpin'
Introduce myself as Loc, she said, "You're a liar"
I said, "I got it goin' on, baby doll, and I'm on fire"
Took her to the hotel, she said, "You're the king"
I said, "Well, be my queen if you know what I mean, and lets do the wild thing"

Wild thing
Wild thing

Shoppin' at the mall looking for some gear to buy
I saw this girl, she gon' rock my world, and I had to adjust my fly
She looked at me and smiled and said, "You have plans for the night?"
I said, "Hopefully, if things go well, I'll be with you tonight"
So we journeyed to her house, one thing led to an other
I key in the door, I cold hit the floor, looked up and it was her mother
I didn't know what to say, I was hangin' by a string
She said, "Hey, you two, I was once like you, and I liked to do the wild thing"

Wild thing
She loved to do the wild thing
Wild thing
Please, baby, baby, please

Posse in effect, hangin' out is always hype
And when me and the crew leave the shindig, I want a girl who's just my type
Saw this luscious little frame, I ain't lyin', fellas, she was fine
This sweet young miss cold gave me a kiss and I knew that she was mine
Took her to the limousine, it's still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur when it was over and I gave her my own ride
Couldn't get her off my jock, she was like static cling
But that's what happens when body start slappin' from doin' the wild thing

Wild thing
She wanna do the wild thing
Please, baby, baby, please

Wild thing
Doin' a little show at the local discotheque
This fine young chick was on my jock, so I said what the heck
She wanted to come on stage and do her little dance
So I said, "Chill for now, but maybe later, you'll get your chance"
So when the show was finished I took her around the way
And what do you know, she was good to go without a word to say
We was all alone and she said, "Tone, let me tell you one thing
I need fifty dollars to make you holler, I get paid to do the wild thing"

Say what?
Yo love, you must be kidding
You're walkin', babe
Just break out of here
Hasta la vista, baby
Wild thing
