		  Hey, said a hustler's work is never through
We makin' it 'cause we makin' moves
The only thing we know how to do
Said it's the only thing we know how to do

Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
We work hard, play hard
Keep partyin' like it's your job
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
We work hard, play hard
Keep partyin' like it's your job, ayy

Come on, baby, and drop it (okay)
Scrub that floor and just mop it (okay)
Show these gangsters how you pop lock it (okay)
Don't care what you got in your pocket (okay)
I peep the way that you rockin'
Flip that thang-thang, girl stop it
Wanna just bang-bang and pop it
While the club crowded, just watch you work it out

Got a gang of cash and it's goin' all on the bar (now work it out)
And it's going fast 'cause I feel like a superstar (now work it out)
And you may not have it, I might just broke the law (now work it out)
It's your turn to grab it, now make this whole thing yours (now work it out)

Hey, said a hustler's work is never through
We makin' it 'cause we makin' moves
The only thing we know how to do
Said it's the only thing we know how to do

Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
We work hard, play hard
Keep partyin' like it's your job
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
We work hard, play hard
Keep partyin' like it's your job, ayy

Yes, I'm fresh to death, lookin' plush (okay)
Ladies can't get enough (okay)
Got my fitness, looking buff (okay)
And all my people with me, I trust (okay)
Holdin' down for my city
If they askin' you, I'm not guilty
Only thing that I'm guilty of is making you rock with me, work it out

Got a gang of cash and it's goin' all on the bar (now work it out)
And it's going fast 'cause I feel like a superstar (now work it out)
And you may not have it, I might just broke the law (now work it out)
It's your turn to grab it, now make this whole thing yours (now work it out)

Hey, said a hustler's work is never through
We makin' it 'cause we makin' moves
The only thing we know how to do
Said it's the only thing we know how to do

Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
We work hard, play hard
Keep partyin' like it's your job
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
We work hard, play hard
Keep partyin' like it's your job, ayy

Hey, said a hustler's work is never through
We makin' it 'cause we makin' moves
The only thing we know how to do
Said it's the only thing we know how to do

Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
We work hard, play hard
Keep partyin' like it's your job
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
We work hard, play hard
Keep partyin' like it's your job, ayy
