		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You and me
We used to be together
Everyday together always
I really feel
That I'm losing my best friend
I can't believe
This could be the end
It looks as though you're letting go
And if it's real
Well I don't want to know

Don't speak
I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't speak
I know just what you're thinking
And I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Our memories
They can be inviting
But some are altogether
Mighty frightening
And as we die, both you and I
With my head in my hands
I sit and cry

Don't speak
I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't speak
I know just what you're thinking
And I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me cause it hurts

It's all ending
I gotta stop pretending who we are, who we are

You and me I can see us dying, are we?

Don't speak
I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't speak
I know just what you're thinking
And I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Don't speak
