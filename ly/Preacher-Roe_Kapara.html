		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I could see them smile
Doused in gasoline
Offer up their child
As they burn and scream
My parents sold me to a preacher
Now I miss my mom and dad
I heard they joined a cult
They say, mass suicidal death
I’m locked inside the church
They say the prophecy’s foretold
Strapped to the altar
I’m the sacrifice the owe
Oooh
They’ll chase me through the graveyard
I hear their guns
I’ll hide behind the chapel
Their out for blood
They’ll call you brother
Then They’ll turn around and chop off your hands
Can’t trust your mother
Cause your father was a traveling man
Stone written tablets in the basements
Where authors etched their lies
They’ll sell you your forgiveness
If you pay them with your life
An actor in his mansion
Holds a party where they’ll meet
Strapped to the table
Let the holy have their feast
They’ll chase me through the graveyard
I hear their guns
I’ll hide behind the chapel
Their out for blood
They’ll call you brother
Then They’ll turn around and chop off your hands
Can’t trust your mother
Cause your father was a traveling man
They’ll preach salvation as they tie my limbs
And rip out my teeth
They’ll soak their daggers In the pigs blood
As I beg and I plead
