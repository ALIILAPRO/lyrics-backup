		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Only one day is left 
Only one day
We are leaving the others 
We're going away 

Today we all steal 
Animals we are 
Possession is lost 

Our souls are from the wild 
And wings to reach the sky 
Let the sun fall into the ocean, 
Let the earth erupt in flame

It is enough to have the strength 
And knowledge 
To raise our dream machines 
Into the sky

Let them sleep who do not know 
The final day is here 
The very last
And we leave at dawn 

Millions of machines on nitroglycerin 
Thunder in us 
There is no force no money and no power
To stop us now and change our fate
Before we rise 

Now every problem is destroyed 
We raise our hands and bodies to the peak 
Into the Universe - towards the stars we go 
Sending machines up to the sky 

(Chorus) 

Machines we are sending to the skies 
Above us all
And leave behind those who don't know 
Of the final day 
We leave in sleep those who don't know
(and) we leave at dawn
We are driven by the be	-machine 
(Wild be	-machine - that never stops)
