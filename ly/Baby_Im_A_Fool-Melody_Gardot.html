		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How was I to know that this was always 
Only just a little game to you?
All the time I felt you gave your heart 
I thought that I would do the same for you
Tell the truth, I think I should have 
Seen it coming from a mile away
When the words you say are

Baby, I'm a fool who thinks it's cool to fall in love?
If I gave a thought to fascination 
I would know it wasn't right to care
Logic doesn't seem to mind that 
I am fascinated by the love affair
Still my heart would benefit from 
A little tenderness from time to time, but never mind
'Cause baby, I'm a fool who thinks it's cool to fall in love

Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm

Yeah

Baby, I should hold on just a moment 
And be sure it's not for vanity
Look me in the eye and tell me 
Love is never based upon insanity, yeah
Even when my heart is beating 
Hurry up the moment's fleeting
Kiss me now, don't ask me how

'Cause baby, I'm a fool who thinks it's cool to fall
Baby, I'm a fool who thinks it's cool to fall
And I would never tell if you became a fool and fell in love
