		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get behind me
Get behind me
Get behind me, Satan
Get behind me
Get behind me
Get behind me, Satan

So you wear your damage on your sleeve
But don't worry
It's all just tongue and cheek, yeah
Not a victim of fashion
More fascist than vogue
'Cause victim is chic
You're as famous as your pain
Victim is chic, yeah

If you conjure the devil
You better make sure
You got a bed for him to sleep in
If you conjure the devil
You better make sure
You got a bed for him to sleep in

Buckshot, glitter perfume
Is something you never want to wear
In your hair will be brains
And this shit won't be the same

Get behind me
Get behind me
Get behind me, Satan (and this shit won't be the same)

If you conjure the devil
You better make sure
You got a bed for him to sleep in
If you conjure the devil
You better make sure
You got a bed for him to sleep in

Get behind me
Get behind me
Get behind me, Satan

Am I Superman?
Am I superstitious?
Am I Superman?
Am I superstitious?
Am I Superman?
Am I superstitious?
Am I Superman?
Am I superstitious?

Get behind me
Get behind me
Get behind me, Satan
