		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love, I'll be there (I'll be there)

I'll reach out my hand to you
I'll have faith in all you do
Just call my name and I'll be there (I'll be there)

And ooh, I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad that I found you

I'll be there with a love that's strong
I'll be your strength
I'll keep holdin' on (holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on)
Yes I will, yes I will

Let me fill your heart with joy and laughter
Togetherness, girl, is all I'm after
Whenever you need me, I'll be there (I'll be there)

I'll be there to protect you (yeah baby)
With an unselfish love that respects you
Just call my name, and I'll be there (I'll be there)

And ooh, I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad that I found you

I'll be there with a love that's strong
I'll be your strength
I'll keep holdin' on
Ooh ooh ooh
Yes I will (holdin' on, holdin' on)
Yes I will

If you should ever find someone new
I know he better be good to you
'Cause if he doesn't
I'll be there (I'll be there)

Don't you know baby, yeah yeah, I'll be there
I'll be there, I'll be there

Just call my name, I'll be there (I'll be there)
Just look over your shoulders honey, ooh
I'll be there, I'll be there
Whenever you need me, I'll be there (I'll be there)

Don't you know, baby yeah
I'll be there, I'll be there (la la la la la la)
Just call my name, I'll be there (I'll be there)
Oh oh oh oh, I'll be there, I'll be there
