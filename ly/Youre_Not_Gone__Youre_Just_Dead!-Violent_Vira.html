		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To the coffin
To the ties
Waiting till the afterlife
My confession won't suffice
There is too much life left in your eyes
I know, I know you never betray truth
Too soon
The walls they could say
You're just another saint
Try to understand
You are just a man
The cracks in the pavement just another sign
This roof will collapse to kill us both inside
The bride and the groom are laid to rest
Can I predict what's next?
The corridor halls of emptiness are looking for a guest
Sitting in silence I know what we both see
I know, I know the end is approaching for you and me
Try to understand
You are just a man
"Promises that won't satisfy"
What are you saying?
I can't take it anymore
You're the one who I adore
Wishing I could've been there to save you
I know, I know that if I kiss you it might
Just burn us alive
