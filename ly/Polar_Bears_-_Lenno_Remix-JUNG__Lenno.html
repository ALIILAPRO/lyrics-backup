		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We need more understanding of human nature
Because the only real danger that exists
Is man himself

We were raised in 2020
Everything we heard
We did not believe a word
They said that we were too many
So they took out the machines
And they wiped the surface clean

Arctic water everywhere
Where are all the polar bears
And penguins and tigers
Now it's only you and me
Swimming where it used to be a city
Our city

Are we ever gonna dance again? Would you ever dare?
Would you ever take a chance on me?
If we ever make it back to the world we used to have
Would you ever lay your eyes on me?

Remember when we had the borders
Didn't care about the mess
Voted POTUS, Mr. West
Now we're hiding in the forest
Running 'round the cemeteries
Singing 'bout the lemon trees (wonder how?)

Poison in the atmosphere
Radiation everywhere, the rain is contagious
We're sitting on a mountaintop
Levels of the sea won't stop, horizon is rising

Are we ever gonna dance again? Would you ever dare?
Would you ever take a chance on me?
If we ever make it back to the world we used to have
Would you ever lay your eyes on me?

Would you ever lay your hands on me
If it wasn't for this tragedy?
Would you ever wanna dance with me?
Would you ever lay you eyes on me?

Hear the machines
Humming melodies
Ohh-ooh

Are we ever gonna dance again? Would you ever dare?
Would you ever take a chance on me?
If we ever make it back to the world we used to have
Would you ever lay your eyes on me?

Would you ever lay your hands on me
If it wasn't for this tragedy?
Would you ever wanna dance with me?
Would you ever lay you eyes on me?
