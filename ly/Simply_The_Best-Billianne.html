		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Verse 1]
I call you when I need you and my heart's on fire
You come to me wild and wired
You come to me and give me everything I need
Give me a lifetime of promises and a world of dreams
Speak the language of love like you know what it means
And it can't be wrong, take my heart and make it strong, babe

[Chorus]
You're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone, anyone I've ever met And I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Well, tear us apart
Baby, I would rather be dead

[Verse 2]
In your heart, I see the the start of every night and every day In your eyes, I get lost, I get washed away
Just as long as I'm here in your arms
I can be in no better place

[Chorus]
You're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I've ever met
And I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Well, tear us apart
Baby, I would rather be dead, oh

[Bridge]
Each time you leave me, I start losing control
Like you're walking away with my heart and my soul I can feel you, babe, even when I'm alone
Baby, don't let go

[Chorus]
'Cause you're simply the best Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I've ever met
And I'm stuck on your heart, babe I hang on every word you say Well, tear us apart
Oh, well I would rather be dead [Outro]
Ooh, ooh
Oh, you're the best
