		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought I'd found the man of my dreams
Now it seems, this is how the story ends
He's going to turn me down and say
Can't we be friends

I thought for once it couldn't go wrong
Not for long, I can see the way this ends
He's going to turn me down and say
Can't we be friends

Never again, through with love
Through with men
They play their game without shame
And who's to blame

I thought I'd found a man I could trust
What a bust, this is how the story ends
He's going to turn me down and say
Can't we be friends

Yes, I thought I knew the wheat from the chaff
What a laugh, this is how our story ends
I'll let her turn me down and say
Can't we be friends

I acted like a kid out of school
What a fool, now I see this is the end
I'll let her turn me down and say
Can't we be friends

Oh what should I give
Though he gave me the air
Why should I cry
He was sigh and wonder why

Yes, I should have seen the signal to stop
What a flop, this is how the story ends
She's gonna turn me down and say
Can't we be friends

What should I give
Though he gave me the air
And why should I cry
He was sigh and wonder why

I should have seen the signal to stop
What a flop, this is how the story ends
I let him turn me down and say

Can't we be, can't we be, can't we be
Can't we be, can't we be, can't we be friends
Oh yes
