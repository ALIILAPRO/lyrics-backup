		<p>
		  ""One day we'll find our way Straying from the road We thought we could go Until we would fade  One day we'll find our way Straying from the road We thought we could go Until we would fade Traveling across the fallen earth  And the foreign lands we survived To believe that this is not the end This is not the time Moving unseen beyond  The shadows waiting for The birth of a star we can follow One day we'll find our time Come to realize  That our history Came full circle Traveling across all the dried up seas And the foreign lands we survived To believe that this is not the end  This is not the time We crane our necks for youth We know we'll make it through And we can go back to the forest Let's go back to the world That was 30 years ago And let's believe this is our time Let's go back to the world That was 30 years ago And let's believe this is our time Let's go back to the world That was 30 years ago And let's believe this is our time Let's go back to the world That was 30 years ago And let's believe this is our time Traveling across all the dried up seas And the foreign lands we survived To believe that this is not the end This is not the time We crane our necks for youth We know we'll make it through And we can go back to the forest Let's go back to the world That was 30 years ago And let's believe this is our time Let's go back to the world That was 30 years ago And let's believe this is our time Let's go back to the world That was 30 years ago And let's believe this is our time Let's go back to the world That was 30 years ago And let's believe this is our time ... Let's go back to the world That was 30 years ago And let's believe this is our time Let's go back to the world That was 30 years ago And let's believe this is our time Let's believe this is our time Let's believe this is our time""
