		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We will not forgive,
Nor will we forget
The willful deceit that spread
Your future is dark
Soon filled with regret

The plan was to bury us where we stand
To suffocate at last
But we will rise to claim this land  

Hear our voice
Ava of Death
You will not forget
This moment in death
Here we stand against the gods
Ava of death

By your blood you'll drown 
Try and strike us down
You will learn to fear us all
Ava of death

Our voice travels far beyond this land
We're an army of the damned
Bearing the mark of shackled hands

Fear will trap your soul
Darkness will unfold
Ava of Death
You will not forget
This moment in death
Here we stand against the gods
Ava of death

By your blood you'll drown 
Try and strike us down
You will learn to fear us all
Ava of death

You will not forget
This moment in death
Here we stand against the gods
Ava of death

By your blood you'll drown 
Try and strike us down
You will learn to fear us all
Ava of death
