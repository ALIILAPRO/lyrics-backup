		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, go your way
I'll take the long way 'round
I'll find my own way down
Oh, as I should

And hold your gaze
There's coke in the Midas touch
A joke in the way that we rust
And breathe again

And you'll find loss
And you'll fear what you found
When the weather comes, oh
Tearing down

There'll be oats in the water
There'll be birds on the ground
There'll be things you never asked her
Oh, how they tear at you now

Oh, go your way
Oh, I'll take the long way 'round
Oh, I'll find my own way down
Oh, as I should

And hold your gaze
There's coke in the Midas touch
A joke in the way that we rust
And breathe again

And you'll find loss
And you'll fear what you found
When the weather comes
Tearing down

There'll be oats in the water
There'll be birds on the ground
There'll be things you never asked her
Oh, how they tear at you now
