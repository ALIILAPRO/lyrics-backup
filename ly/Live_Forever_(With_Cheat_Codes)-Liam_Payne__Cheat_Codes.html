		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jaded, faded, self-medicated
I didn't know I was waiting for you, yeah, yeah
Broken, smoking, 'til you came into focus
Sobered me up off of one hit of you

Wasn't even trying to chase a high
I just didn't wanna feel so low, low, low
Know I'm gonna miss the crazy nights
But you made me wanna let it all go

I was always gonna live fast, die young
Slow down when you came along, yeah
Burn bright, burn out
But now you make me wanna live forever
All that runnin', gonna give it up for you
Nothing ever get me high like you do
Some way, somehow

You and I, we're gonna live forever
Forever
You and I, we're gonna live forever

Reckless, restless, I let it get so hectic
All the way up with my head in the sky, yeah, yeah
Too much, too gone, too many, too fun
I don't know how but I got out alive

Wasn't even trying to chase a high
I just didn't wanna feel so low, low, low
Know I'm gonna miss the crazy nights
But you made me wanna let it all go

I was always gonna live fast, die young
Slow down when you came along, yeah
Burn bright, burn out
But now you make me wanna live forever
All that runnin', gonna give it up for you
Nothing ever get me high like you do
Some way, somehow

You and I, we're gonna live forever
Forever
You and I, we're gonna live forever
Some way, somehow
You and I, we're gonna live forever

The party's over, let the good times roll
But we're still gonna lose control
Lose my mind, getting high on you
High on you
The party's over, let the good times roll
But we're still gonna lose control
Lose my mind, getting high on you

You and I, we're gonna live forever, forever and ever
You and I, we're gonna live forever
Forever and ever
You and I, we're gonna live forever
Forever and ever
You and I, we're gonna live forever
Forever and ever
You and I, we're gonna live forever

Live fast, die young
Slow down when you came along, yeah
Burn bright, burn out
But now you make me wanna live forever
