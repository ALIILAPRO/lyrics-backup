		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Sometimes I don't know what to do with myself)
(This is one of those times)
(I'm hoping that maybe in recording this I won't fucking explode)
(Geez Louise)

I can't believe it's not God
My God lives somewhere in the south of Europe 
Sightseeing with His favorite son
I've existed for 500 years and now I'm waist-high in murderer's blood
This stink won't come off, it won't come off
And no one knows about it at all so I guess it's not your fault
(Good luck)

Geez Louise
He's just like me, she's just like me, they're just like me, damnit
Geez Louise
He's just like me, she's just like me, they're just like me, God damnit

You're telling me that it's my responsibility 
To dig these roots after ages of attack
You're telling me that I'm wasting all my energy
Better catch-up girlie, you won't find love like that
This isn't a game I'd be happy to play
You gave yourself a head start (give yourself a head start)
Life seems to work in mysterious ways
But how's that my fault? (How's that my)

Geez Louise
He's just like me, she's just like me, they're just like me, damnit
Geez Louise
He's just like me, she's just like me, they're just like me, goddamnit

Geez Louise
He's just like me, she's just like me, they're just like me, damnit!
Geez Louise
He's just like me, she's just like me, they're just like me, goddamnit

Um, six sections in my mane
I don't wanna look younger, it's just something I'm into
People like us did it every day, 'til we were forced to change it
But we don't have to talk about it
No, we don't have to talk about it

Um, eighty relatives in my life
Each and every one a different flavor of Catholic
People like us were among the divine until the cops arrived
But we don't have to talk about it
No, we don't have to talk about it
And I'm like

Geez Louise
He's just like me, she's just like me, they're just like me, damnit
Geez Louise
He's just like me, she's just like me, they're just like me, goddamnit

Um, two souls in my body and mind
He doesn't make mistakes, and I will not be the first one
People like us only follow our lines from His great design
But we don't have to talk about it
No, we don't have to talk about it

Um, '41 at the back of my head
I know without my mother I'd be dead in an instant
People like us never get what I get, and I'm forever indebted
But we don't have to talk about it
No, we don't have to talk about it
And I'm like

Geez Louise
He's just like me, she's just like me, they're just like me, damnit
Geez Louise
He's just like me, she's just like me, they're just like me, goddamnit

I know it's easier said than done to live on concrete and speech alone
My mother tongue, she's aching for a shift, a familiar addition of sensibility

Must I pin-point anything to kick up dust, let it settle in
Adorn my skin in accidental patterns
Not sure if it matters 
But it sounds a lot like a life being lived

Trace it back and and run it through this tangled mesh of wasted breath
Divine deception

Wait 'til you're older, when you've had the chance to mull it over
But it's not lost on me
How could I repent for time well spent?

Womanoid
We don't have to talk about it
We don't have to talk about it
Womanoid
We don't have to talk about it
We don't have to talk about it
