		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Show yourself show me your face show me who you really are
Don't tell me the reason why you hide yourself from me is because
you think that we are similar
With blood on your hands you are unclean
Preying on those who are depraved
But yourself you know you cannot be saved- you cannot be saved
So many unshed tears to undergo a pain so severe
You try to take me by surprise I see right through your eyes
Wicked malicious are blameless & faultless
Forgive you? How can i? I can't even forgive myself
What you, you take, you take from me
I know who you are I see right through you the real you
Please give me something to pull myself through this
Don't you think that its been so long overdue
Say its for the last time & never again
Lie & tell me I'm blind never again
Why would you do this? Never again
For the last time- forgive you how can I
