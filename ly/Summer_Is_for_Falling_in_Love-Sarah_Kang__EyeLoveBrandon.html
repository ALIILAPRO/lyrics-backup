		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We could drive along
An ocean reflecting the sun
Or make a bed of green
Atop a wide open scene
Under a canvas of blue
I would draw ever nearer to you
To feel the dew on your skin
That is how it would begin
For summer is for falling in love
We could stay out late
Until the sun sets past eight
And the cotton candy haze
Mirrors the warmth of your gaze
Raise your glass to mine
And as we drink, we would lock eyes
So we could disregard
The thought of ever having to part
For summer is for falling in love
This lightness of being
We both know to be fleeting
Like the last breath of a sunset
Right before the day is dead
But maybe the heat of today
Could keep even winter away
So I'll remember your laugh
'Cause nothing ever changes the fact
That summer is for falling in love
Summer is for falling in love
