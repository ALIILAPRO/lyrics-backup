		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know people always say
?Women should be thin
They should be on diet?
But I don't care, I just enjoy eating

I like my coffee with a lot of cream
I like to eat late at night
I like scrambled eggs after a sweet dream
I like potatoes deep fried

I like some sugar in my lemonade
I like hot chicken wings and steak
I like thick cheesecake but homemade
I like a long lasting lunch break

Give me the food, I say, give me the food
Give me no fruit if you love me
Give me the food, I say, give me the food
Give me no fruit if you love me

Some girls may think, 'This chick's a little big'
Slim girls don't understand, I don't care
Some guys may say, 'It?s her curves that I didn't urged'
They like the tight pants that I wear

I am Romanian, I love to eat
It's in my genes, I can't control
Look at my carnation 'cause this bottles can't compete
I am woman, no skinny doll

Give me the food, I say, give me the food
Give me no fruit if you love me
Give me the food, I say, give me the food
Give me no fruit if you love me

Give me the food, I say, give me the food
Give me no fruit if you love me
Give me the food, I say, give me the food
Give me no fruit if you love me

You know people say women
Should only eat yogurt and strawberries
They say a lot of things but you know

I don't care what people say 'bout my weight
So if you want to take me out for a date
Make sure there is big love, don't food on my weight
And maybe I let you get a taste of my cake

Give me the food, I say, give me the food
Give me no fruit if you love me
Give me the food, I say, give me the food
Give me no fruit if you love me

Give me the food, I say, give me the food
Give me no fruit if you love me
Give me the food, I say, give me the food
Give me no fruit if you love me
