		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (Pooh, you a fool for this one)

I became what you fantasized about becomin'
Had to quit sendin' music out, 'cause somebody fucked around, leaked somethin'
Every girl that I mess with knows what's up, but they keep comin'
Pretty sure at this point, they don't wanna know the secrets I keep from 'em
Put your phone down and be somethin', twenty-five and you broke (broke)
Talkin' 'bout me on the internet, but you dapped me up when we spoke (fake)
I don't know if I'm genius, but I definitely had a few strokes (uh)
Real raps, not jokes (mmm), dress like I'm at Oakes (ayy)
Seer suckin' my coat (coat), daycare in her throat (yeah)
Hit songs in my notes (ooh), hit notes like, "Don't" (don't)
I just got in my zone (zone), had to let it be known (known)
Brought her out, she got flown (boom), unspoken, we bone
Fell in love with my tone, airplane on my phone
Floatin' off the Patr√≥n, in the club and I'm stoned
Used to curve me in the tenth grade, now things changed, I'm grown
I ain't gettin' dethroned, hit the gas and I'm gone (hit the gas and I'm gone, gone) 
I'm the one that put the city on

Yeah, I'm the one that got the city known off of turkey bags and I'm in it for 'em
I'm the one that gave us big records, I done fucked around and got my Guinness on
Yeah, in the city I be buildin' hoes, put butt shots and her titties on
Me though, I like natural, fifty bands in the satchel
Yeah, a million in just jewelry actually, and she saved my number under "Daddy"
Used to do field trips up to Gatti's, used to do road trip to the natty
Don't take no pics and don't at me 
I take you to the show to meet Jackie (to the show to meet Jackie)
These girls'll do anything for some backstage passes (yeah, yeah)

Yeah, lights, camera, action (lights, camera, action)
Don't stop, keep goin', it's relaxin' (stop, keep goin')
You comin' on tour with how you actin' (comin' on tour)
She seen my car and got to askin' (she seen my car)
Yeah, this Aventador, not a 'Vette, I ain't went platinum, I go jet
But I'm still livin' life, no sweat, came in the Rolls coupe, the Rolls truck next
Another quarter million on the wrist (another quarter million on)
Pick her up, she ignore a text
Pretty sure he know what's next (he know what's-)
I told her, "More spit, baby, more lips" 
You ain't know I leave 'cause I'm born sexy
If you didn't know, now you know (didn't know, now you-)
Move with young hood nigga hope
One-fifty for a local show (fifty for a show)
I'm the fire extinguisher to the smoke 
We all know who hate me the most (we all know who hate me the-)
All the lame niggas that's broke (all the lame niggas that's-)
From the black sheep to the GOAT (from the black sheep to the-)
I was just microwavin' my dope (I was just microwavin' my dope)
Since the white Rollie and the rope (white Rollie and the-)
Like my food with a side of coke (food with a side-)
I ain't gotta say much, y'all know (say much, y'all-)

Yeah, I'm the one that got the city known off of turkey bags and I'm in it for 'em (in it for 'em)
I'm the one that gave us big records, I done fucked around and got my Guinness on
Yeah, in the city I be buildin' hoes, put butt shots and her titties on
Me though, I like natural, fifty bands in the satchel
Yeah, a million in just jewelry actually, and she saved my number under "Daddy"
Used to do field trips up to Gatti's, used to do road trip to the natty
Don't take no pics and don't at me, I take you to the show to meet Jackie
These girls'll do anything for some backstage passes
