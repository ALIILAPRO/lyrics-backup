		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Trips to the islands
Girl I need your vibrance
We could be in silence
Still living our lives to the best we know
Don't gotta do too much with you,
I'm at peace with a touch or two,

Need little time
Tryna make you mine (oh oh)
Can't let it go by
Treat your body like sign (oh oh)
Did I read it right
Tell me what you like so slow
You're the perfect trip to me
Don't gotta go too far to see

Don't gotta tell me twice I know what you like
Fuck it i need break lets take a flight
Keeping me down to earth when I'm still high
Seeing it clear as day throughout the night

Beating it up
No I cannot get it enough
I'm tryna run this shit up with you
oh oh
oh oh

I'm giving it up
And I'm addicted as fuck
But I dont care enough to go slow
