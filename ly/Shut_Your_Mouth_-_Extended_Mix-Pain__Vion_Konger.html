		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shut your mouth
Shut your mouth
Shut your mouth
Shut your mouth
The only thing I ever wanted
The only thing I ever needed
Is my own way, I gotta have it all
I don't want your opinion, I don't need your ideas
Stay the fuck out of my face, stay away from me
I am my own God, I do as I please
Just wipe your own ass
And shut your mouth
Oh-oh
I had enough and you're going down
(Shut your mouth)
Oh-oh
What comes around, you know goes around
Shut your mouth
Shut your mouth
Shut your mouth
