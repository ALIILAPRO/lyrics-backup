		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tip-toed 'round my door
Was not looking for you
Busy finding who I am (I am)
Just one year ago
You couldn't have told me
That this was a part of my plans (my plans)

I never imagined such a thing
Never imagined such a thing
So beautiful, wonderful
Oh, oh
Never imagined such a thing (yeah, yeah)
Never imagined such a thing (oh, I)

Now I understand
Was all in the timing
Busy counting down the days
And I could never see
Never would've guessed that
You'd show up for me this way

I never imagined such a thing
Never imagined such a thing
So beautiful, wonderful
No, no
Never imagined such a thing (ooh, ooh baby)
Never imagined such a thing (no)

What's better than this?
Heaven never missed
Glad he showed me this
Showed me you in this life
What's better than this?
Heaven never missed
Glad he showed me this
Showed me you in this life
What's better than this?
Heaven never missed
Glad he showed me this
Showed me you in this life
What's better than this?
Heaven never missed
Glad he showed me this
Showed me you in this life

Glad he showed me this
Showed me you in this life
What's better than this?
Heaven never missed
Glad he showed me this

So beautiful, wonderful
No, no
Glad he showed me this (oh, oh)
Showed me you in this life (ooh, ooh)
What's better than this?
Heaven never missed
Glad he showed me this
Showed me you in this life
