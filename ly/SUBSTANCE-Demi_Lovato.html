		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is anybody happy with life in the backseat?
Trying to master the art of detaching
Is anybody driving, is anyone asking?
Is anyone grasping that nothing lasts?

Whoa, I know we're all fucking exhausted
Whoa, am I in my head or have we all lost it?

So I ask myself
"Am I the only one looking for substance?"
Got high, it only left me lonely and loveless
Don't wanna end up in a casket, head full of maggots
Body full of jack shit, I get an abundance
Am I the only one looking for substance?

I don't remember last week, got my head scratching
But everyone's acting like nothing is lacking
Think we might be crashing, everyone's laughing
Time is just passing yet, nothing lasts

Whoa, I know we're all fucking exhausted
Whoa, am I in my head or have we all lost it?

So I ask myself
"Am I the only one looking for substance?"
Got high, it only left me lonely and loveless
Don't wanna end up in a casket, head full of maggots
Body full of jack shit, I get an abundance
Am I the only one looking for substance?

Am I talking to myself?
Is anyone out there screaming at the walls?
I can't relate at all, relate at all
Fuck the theatrics, what happened to classic?
Give me the real shit, give me the magic

So I ask myself
"Am I the only one looking for substance?"
Got high, it only left me lonely and loveless
(Don't wanna end up in a) Casket
(Head full of) Maggots
(Body full of) Jack shit
(I get an) Abundance
Am I the only one looking for substance? 

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
