		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My heart is worried about you
From a temptation between your hands
That took me from you but didn't get me back to you
 
My heart is worried about you
I didn't own anything
The love had burned me
And the end of love is burning
 
My heart
My heart is worried about us
We separated when we met
 
My heart
My heart is worried about us
We separated when we met
And if we stop we will walk
Each on a different way
Each without a heart
As if we never knew each other (Met)
As if we never fell in love
