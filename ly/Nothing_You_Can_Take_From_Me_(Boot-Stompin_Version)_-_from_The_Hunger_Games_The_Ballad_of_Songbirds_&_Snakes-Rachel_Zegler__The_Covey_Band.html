		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can't take my past, you can't take my history
You could take my pa, but his name's a mystery
Nothin' you can take from me was ever worth keepin'
Oh, nothin' you can take was ever worth keepin'

Can't take my charm, can't take my humor
Can't take my wealth, 'cause it's just a rumor
Nothin' you can take was ever worth keepin'
No, nothin' you can take was ever worth keepin'

Thinkin' you're so fun, thinkin' you could have my
Thinkin' you're in control, thinkin' you'll change me
Maybe rearrange me, think again if that's your goal
Ooh

Can't take my sass, can't take my talkin'
You can kiss my ass, then keep on walkin'

Nothin' you can take was ever worth keepin'
Oh, nothin' you can take was ever worth keepin'
Nothin' you can take from me is worth dirt
Take it, 'cause I give it free, you all heard
Nothin' you can take was ever worth keepin'
No, nothin' you can take was ever worth keepin'
