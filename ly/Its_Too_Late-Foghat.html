		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rod Price Dave Peverett - Knee Trembler Music - ASCAP
Since you've been gone, I've been holdin' on,
Behind my smile sadness grows.
I tried to hide the pain,
The pain I feel inside, but it shows.

And it's too late to change your mind - we can't turn back the hands of time,
It's too late to change your mind.

I tried and tried, but the feelin' died,
The love we had, it turned to hate.
And now you're gone for good,
I keep on sayin' baby, it's too late.

It's too late to change your mind - we can't turn back the hands of time,
It's too late to change your mind.

I'd have the strength to stand alone,
If I was strong enough to break your heart of stone.

It's too late to change your mind - we can't turn back the hands of time,
It's too late to change your mind.
Yea

{Rod - Solo}
I'd have the strength to stand alone,
If I was strong enough to break your heart of stone.

It's too late to change your mind - we can't turn back the hands of time,
It's too late to change your mind - we can't turn back the hands of time.

It's too late, it's too late,
It's too late, it's too late,
We can't turn back, we can't turn back,
We can't turn back, we can't turn back,
'Cause it's too late.

It's too late, it's too late,
We can't turn back, we can't turn back,
It's too late, it's too late, yeah,
We can't turn back,
