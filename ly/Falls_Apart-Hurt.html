		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I messed up again when I tried
You spend all your money and I
And, oh! By the way.
With all you did nothing has changed
So lie like a waste by the side
As everything just falls apart
'Cause everything just fell apart for me

I cracked my head and broke my
I correct my head and broke my
I cracked my head and broke my heart

And I don't feel the need to go on
I was happier singing along the way
I had things, I need to say
But now its like a swallowed tape
That holds up my face from inside

'As everything just falls apart
'Cause everything just fell apart for me

I cracked my head and broke my
I cracked my head and broke my
I cracked my head and broke my heart

So woe is me
Oh woe is me, yeah
Woe is me
It all fell apart

I cracked my head and broke my
I cracked my head and broke my
I cracked my head and broke my...heart

And the hell of it is what we are
We finish and wish we could start again
Our skin tears away as our memories fade with age
And we don't even know 'til its gone...
But everything just fell apart
'Cause everything just falls apart for me

I cracked my head and broke my
I cracked my head and broke my
I cracked my head and broke my heart

So woe is me
It all falls apart you see
So woe is me
It all fell apart

I cracked my head and broke my
I cracked my head and broke my
I cracked my head and broke my heart

Everything just comes down
It falls around me cause, well
Everything just falls uhhhh

So woe is me
It all falls apart you see
So woe is me
It all fell apart

But I cracked my head and broke my
I cracked my head and broke my
Everything just falls a
