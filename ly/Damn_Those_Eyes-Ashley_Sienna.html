		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was one time
One time I lost control
One kiss
And now I'm down a rabbit hole
One look
That made me want it all
I shouldn't be here
But I can't stay clear
I had one rule
Don't be fooled by those boys
And this boy
Is one I know I should avoid
One day
He'll leave me so destroyed
I've been here before
But I always want more
He'll mess up all I have
Rip my heart in half
Make it bleed so bad
But damn, those eyes
So pretty I could cry
How could I
Not get hypnotized
By those eyes
By those eyes
I'd die for those eyes
Every time
He makes me
Fall on my shaky knees
When I see his eyes
I forget how to breath
He breaks me
But I am too deceived
I know that he's bad
But without him I'm sad
He'll mess up all I have
Rip my heart in half
Make it bleed so bad
But damn, those eyes
So pretty I could cry
How could I
Not get hypnotized
By those eyes
By those eyes
I'd die for those eyes
Every time
If I close my eyes
Maybe this time
I will break free from his spell
But then I feel his touch
Makes my blood rush
Places his lips right on mine
But damn, those eyes
So pretty I could cry
How could I
Not get hypnotized
By those eyes
By those eyes
I'd die for those eyes
Every time
But damn, those eyes
So pretty I could cry
How could I
Not get hypnotized
By those eyes
By those eyes
I'd die for those eyes
Every time
Damn those eyes
I
Fall for them every time
Why can't I just
Think for myself sometime
