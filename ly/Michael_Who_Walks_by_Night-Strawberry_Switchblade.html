		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Close your front door
On just another day
A backward glance
And on your way
Once on the street
You'll find your feet

Michael goes by
Who walks by night
Michael goes by 
Who walks by night

My friend, you are a walking
Not talking man
Once on the street
You will find your feet
You don't want me
When you are free

Michael goes by
Who walks by night
Michael goes by 
Who walks by night

Michael goes by
Who walks by night

A nightly walk
In all your fine finery
The girls go by
Some look, some dance
Who could take exception
To you

Michael goes by
Who walks by night
Michael goes by 
Who walks by night
