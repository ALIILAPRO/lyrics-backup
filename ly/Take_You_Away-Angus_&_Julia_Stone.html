		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When your feeling down
And your sky is grey
And the people that you love
Well they have nothing lovely
To say

When your days are long
And lonlier than before
When your bed is cold
And the sheep are at your door

I'll take you away
I'll take you away
I'll take you,
I'll take you away
I'll take you away

When you're tired of working
Like a slave
And the smell of the coffee bean,
Well it just won't go away
And you friends, well they've got
Nothing good to say
You just call out my name

And I'll take you away
I'll take you away
I'll take you,
I'll take you away
I'll take you away

And I'll take you away
I'll take you away
I'll take you,
I'll take you away
I'll take you away
