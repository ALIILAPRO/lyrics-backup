		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you're a bit scared
You're living on edge
It's hard to escape your worries

If you wanna hide
You're losing your mind
You gotta lean on somebody

I'll be that somebody for ya
Thousand miles it don't matter
When you're feeling under pressure
Say the word I'll be there

'Cause you can reach me, easy, whenever you like
Hit me up, DM, tweet, Kakao me, or FaceTime
'Till we're free to meet up for a coffee and a smile
See you on the other side

Don't let it get, don't let it get you down
(You down, you down, you down)
It's gonna end, it's gonna end, no doubt

I'm out here holding my breath
I just can't wait to see you again
Oh yeah, it feels like it's been forever
Counting down the days

When it's overwhelming, hold on tight
I'll be here, don't forget it
'Cause in life sometimes we need a
Helping hand, you'll be alright
Just take it slow, one day at a time

If you think you're trapped
You're in that box you built yourself
I'll help you break it

And I'm gon' catch you when you fall or when you're sinking
And when it gets too much don't over think it

Don't look back, let it go (let it go)
Just keep calm and carry on, oh

Yeah they talk a lot but I ain't tripping
Trying to drown us, keep on swimming
What we have, stay in the moment
We can't stop just trynna be honest

Put it on lock, we could pull up
Yeah, we can keep up, it's about love
Yeah we go up top, no this ain't luck
Yeah they can all try but they never break us ever

When it's overwhelming, hold on tight
I'll be here, don't forget it
'Cause in life sometimes we need a
Helping hand, you'll be alright
Just take it slow, one day at a time

Oh you've come so far
We're in this together
Even though we're apart
Won't be for long, won't be for long

We face stormy weather
Rain's pouring but it never lasts
Only gets better from here

When it's overwhelming, hold on tight
I'll be here, don't forget it
'Cause in life sometimes we need a
Helping hand, you'll be alright
Just take it slow, one day at a time
