		  Narcissus
Narcissus
Narcissus
Narcissus

Being left, being left, being left, being left
Being left, being left with me
Being left, being left, being left, being left
Being left, being left with me
Being left, being left, being left, being left
Being left, being left with me
Being left, being left, being left, being left
Being left, being left with me

Narcissus
Narcissus
Narcissus
Narcissus
Narcissus
Narcissus
Narcissus

The saddest story ever told
The perfect glory, so all alone
And I could love you 'til kingdom come
I might not deserve you, save you from

The saddest story ever told
Loving only what you will hold
In your own reflection
When love is here
With all your protection
I hold you dear

The saddest story ever told
The narcissistic glory to be all alone
And I could show you, listen what I say
To fear real love is to give it away
A happy ending would never be
Narcissus dying

Narcissus
Narcissus
Narcissus
Narcissus
Narcissus
Narcissus
Narcissus
Narcissus
Narcissus
Narcissus
Narcissus

Rosebud
Narcissus, touch me, reach out your hand
Oh, if you fall in love with your own reflection
Like it was planned
You would die in love
Failing to feel or to understand
That just I can give
Narcissus, I, the nymph
The rosebud
Narcissus, see me turn into sand
If you fall in love with your reflection
You may be damned
But, darling, I could teach you to feel
And to understand
Narcissus, my love
Thy love will go

Being left, being left, being left, being left
Being left, being left with me
Narcissus

Being left, being left, being left, being left
Being left, being left with me
Narcissus

Being left, being left, being left, being left
Being left, being left with me
Narcissus

Being left, being left, being left, being left
Being left, being left with me
Narcissus

Being left, being left, being left, being left
Being left, being left with me
Narcissus
