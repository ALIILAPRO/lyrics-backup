		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh uh uh uh oh ooh
Why did you have to go-oh
Away from home, me love
Uh uh uh uh oh ooh
Why did you have to go-oh
Away from home, me love

See the first time me looking at your eyes
Me be tell you want a guy like me (guy like me)
We use to ave good times on the evening
Me and you chilling on the beach (on the beach)

We use to kiss and caress an trust me
Girl it feels so sweet (feels so sweet)
Den one day you move
Now I'm feeling kinda blue
Cause we had to see you leave (you leave)

I feel like I'm drowning in the ocean
Somebody come and take me away

Uh uh uh uh oh ooh
Why did you have to go-oh
Away from home, me love
Uh uh uh uh oh ooh
Why did you have to go-oh
Away from home, me love

Now I'm sitting in a chair wit no one here
And I'm feeling all alone (all alone)
Thinking to myself like
Damn why my baby up and gone (up and gone)
It's like I'm missing her and I know shes missing me (missing me)
Its been two years an a half in July will make it three (make it three)

I feel like I'm drowning in the ocean
Somebody come and take me away

Uh uh uh uh oh ooh
Why did you have to go-oh
Away from home, me love
Uh uh uh uh oh ooh
Why did you have to go-oh
Away from home, me love

Why you leave me, why you leave me
Baby tell me, baby tell me
Why you leave me, why you leave me, why you leave me

Why you leave me, why you leave me
Baby tell me, baby tell me
Why you leave me, why you leave me, why you leave me

I feel like I'm drowning in the ocean
Somebody come and take me away

Uh uh uh uh oh ooh
Why did you have to go-oh
Away from home, me love

Uh uh uh uh oh ooh
Why did you have to go-oh
Away from home, me love

Uh uh uh uh oh ooh
Why did you have to go-oh
Away from home, me love

Uh uh uh uh oh ooh (Why you leave me, why you leave me)
Why did you have to go-oh (Baby tell me baby tell me)
Away from home, me love (Why you leave me, why you leave me)
