		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Slashes to Slashes, Dust to Dust
With the blade in my hand, kill you, I might
Forget about falling, it's for poor distant punks
I tell you I'll see the pain after I see the trunk

So you really thought I just came
To the gutters forlorn to be tamed?

I'm at the end of, my rope your Tying
This is just dreaming of might
Hallucination, your in for shit!
I dare you to look at me, I'm a pshyco freak!

You motherfuckers wanna give me, a lobodomy?
Fuck no, then you know who I am?
Well we're about to fucking see
You started messin with death
No one said?
I'm a Maniac
Fuck yeah, you have no power to ask why!
Then I will give you a turn

When talking out of your bodom mouth
At night I bark, scream or shout
So really thought I just came
To the gutters forlorn to be tamed?

You motherfuckers wanna give me, a lobodomy?
Fuck no, then you know who I am?
Well we're about to fucking see
You started messin with death
No one said?
I'm a Maniac
Fuck yeah, you have no power to ask why!
Then I will give you a turn

I'll never give a fuck that
These poor bridges are burnt
Fuck no, fuck all that shit
Now then, would you all just let me go
