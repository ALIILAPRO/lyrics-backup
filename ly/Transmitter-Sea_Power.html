		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another day another age
I thought that we were in this all together
If you ever come back again
Will you be more than a witness to the weather?
What have you 
What have you
What have you done my dear?
 
All of this used to mean so much to me
It doesn't mean so much anymore
 
Well after all after all the thrills
I feel more confused than ever
I guess I know I know you know the drill
Somebody else was pulling all the levers
What have you 
What have you
What have you done my dear?
 
All of this used to mean so much to me
It doesn't mean so much anymore
Anymore
 
Oh I can take it
You can have it
I will understand
