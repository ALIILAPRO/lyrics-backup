		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby you’re my death note
I don’t wanna let go
Cuz you're like a hole
Burned into in my brain

Cuz baby you are psycho
I think think it’s all right though
Cuz I love you more
When you drive me insane

You shot my heart
With a smoking gun

Then you laughed and told me that
You did it all for fun

Pathological lies,
you got that look in your eyes
That drives me crazy, but I’m God damn terrified

Circling conversations
And accusations
Are all we are worried about

Why can’t we have some patience
Communication
Let's figure it out

Baby you’re my death note
I don’t wanna let go
Cuz you're like a hole
Burned into in my brain

Cuz baby you are psycho
I think think it’s all right though
Cuz I love you more
When you drive me insane

You’re giving me heart attack
Run it back
Why you gotta talk like that
Is this another one of your games

Baby you’re my death note
I don’t wanna let go
Cuz you're like a hole
Burned into in my brain

Burned in the back of my mind
You set off a fire
And now it’s setting my world ablaze

Your always way out of line
But most of the time
You know that you're gonna getcha your way

Circling conversations
And accusations
Are all we are worried about

Why can’t we have some patience
Communication
Let's figure it out

Baby you’re my death note
I don’t wanna let go
Cuz you're like a hole
Burned into in my brain

Cuz baby you are psycho
I think think it’s all right though
Cuz I love you more
When you drive me insane

You’re giving me heart attack
Run it back
Why you gotta talk that
Is this another one of your games

Cuz baby you’re my death note
I don’t wanna let go
Cuz you're like a hole
Burned into in my brain

Ohhhh why do I feel like
You might just tear me in two

Ohhhh why do I feel like
you’ve left me tattered and bruised

Baby you’re my death note
I don’t wanna let go
Cuz you're like a hole
Burned into my brain

Cuz baby you are psycho
I think think it’s all right though
Cuz I love you more
When you drive me insane

You’re giving me heart attack
Run it back
Why you gotta talk that
This another one of your games

Cuz Baby you’re my Death Note
I don’t wanna let go
Cuz you're like a hole
Burned into my brain
