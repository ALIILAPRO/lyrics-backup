		  Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Stay badu dem day day (swee da do day swee da do day)
Swee da do dem day day (swee da do day)
(Swee da do day swee da do day) dee la do do dem day day (day ay)

(Ay) and she says she needs more than a friend
That's all I ever been yo
Well one day you gon' overstand, yo badu ba dee la do, day day
And I remember the first time that we met yo
How could I forget ya?
When you smiled, and I turned and said to you
"Yo, your pure and true"

I'm in love with you, in love with you, in love with you, in love with you
I'm in love with you, in love with you, in love with you, in love with you, yeah
I'm so in love, baby
And I don't care what your mama say
Standing in love lady
And I don't care what your sister say
Yo badu, ba da, ba la, day day, day, I need ya

He said he's really diggin' me
I don't know what to say
I can't imagine why I feel so weak, say, say
That's when he took my heart in his hands
And kissed it gently
He open up his lips then said this poetry

I'm in love with you, love wit' you
Love wit' you, love with you
Love wit' you (wow), love with you
I'm in love wit' you, love wit' you
I'm so in love baby
I don't care what your brothers say, no (what?)
I'm so in love baby
I don't care what the people say

Well I try and I try and I try
And I try and I try and I try and I try and I try

(Ay) and you said you need more than a friend
That's all I've ever been yo
Well one day you gon' overstand, yo badu ba dee la do, day day

(Ay) and when I look In your eyes, I know that you were meant to be
My solider, so baby come on, I mean it desperately

I'm in love with you, love with you
I'm in love with you, in love with you
No see I'm in love wit' you, love with you
No, no, no I'm in love with you, in love with you

No see 'cause, I'm so in love baby
I don't care what the people say
I'm so in love baby
And I don't care what your teacher say
I'm so in love baby
I don't care what the Raga say, oh (ay)

Dee da do badu ba dee dem, day day (ay ay)
Badu la dee da do day day
(I try, I try) Yo badu la dee da do dem, day day, (I try, I try) badu la dee da do day
(I try, I try) Swee la da la dee da do dem, day day, (I try, I try) dee da do, dem, day day

'Cause you in love with me
You in love with me
No, you in love with me
No, no, no you in love with me
No see you in love with me
No, no, no you in love with me
No, I think you in love with me
No, no, no you in love with me (ha)
I know you're in love with me
No, no, no you in love with me
Alright I'm in love with you
Yes I'm in love you
I'm in love with you, and I'm in love with you
Ooh, I'm in love with you, say, I'm in love with you
Oh, I'm in love with you, I'm in love with you, love wit' you
