		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Classic)

Said Afrikaner when I'm on the vibe
And I'm undercover when I'm on the way
So I need a day, wanna run away
As in I wanna leave, said I wanna dip
So I need a jet and I went away
Not the internet 'cause we only met
But I wanna wall
I just wanna ball, yeah

So imagine the energy
It remains in my memory
Yes, we are and the eyes will see
I won't give no apologies, no no
Can you feel me?
I am living, I am living my life now
I am living, I am living my time now
I am living, I am living my life

So live life (live life)
No time (no time)
So live life (live life)
No time (no time)

It's January night celebrating life
Elevator heights, illuminating light
A white tiger can't deny or take away my stripes
Through the valleys in the peaks, we maintain the hype
We the vice, heard it from me, now you like
Making nice movements, shoot the dice, but your aim is nice
No time, no time, gotta say it twice
Life's full of living, I'm just tripping off the greatest vice
Strong roots, bare fruit, we got the juice within
Back against the wind, time to win again
Grab my fire dripping pen, tap into my zen
Tell the universe to bend then produce a gem
You know the blend make it classy
I ain't even capping
Three tapes in the row, that's a hack trick
Tell so and so you can adapt it
If you want that original vibe, you gon' blast this

So imagine the energy
It remains in my memory
Yes, we are and the eyes will see
I won't give no apologies, no no
Can you feel me?
I am living, I am living my life now
I am living, I am living my time now
I am living, I am living my life

So live life (live life)
No time (no time)
So live life (live life)
No time (no time)

Live life my guy, no think twice
My head anointed with oil, my drip nice
We manifesting the vibes on this side
They tried to trick guys, they lies ain't sit right
In the eye of the storm we sit tight
Even when there was turbulence in flight
Swear the world ain't prepared for these times
The weak will switch sides
The eagles keep flying 'cause
That's why we came, not for the fame
Meek shall inherit that's the word that remains
Ogunmade, that's the blood of a king
When you hear the bang 
Just know you're now rocking with livest
Tell me what your vibe is, cruise for the night, uh
Music that is timeless
If it is for the latter make I holla you in private
If you can describe it then show them who providing

Live life (live life)
No time (no time)
So live life (live life)
No time (no time)
