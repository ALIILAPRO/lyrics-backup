		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Before I start just let me say
You make the baddest bitch look good any day
I won't forget the day you rescued me
The day your true colors came out to play

Did anybody tell you you look better with your makeup on?
Did anybody tell you you don't matter to me anymore?
I was your joke, you were my heart
You played me well like a deck of cards
I see the tears run down your face
What, you think my mind is gonna change?
And I'm like

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
You're gonna have to let this go
Didn't wanna say I told you so oh oh
But someone had to let you know
And if you think your tears are gonna change my mind
I'm not gonna waste your time
I'll remind you what I told you
You'd be laughing until you cry
I told ya
You'd be laughing 'til you cry, cry back to me
You'd be laughing 'til you cry, cry back to me

Before you go, let me explain
With you, I lost way more than I ever gained
And now you're crying back to me, what a shame
You had the best and now the worst has come your way

Did anybody tell you you look better with your makeup on?
Did anybody tell you you don't matter to me anymore?
I was your joke, you were my heart
You played me well like a deck of cards
I see the tears run down your face
What, you think my mind is gonna change?
And I'm like

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
You're gonna have to let this go
Didn't wanna say I told you so oh oh
But someone had to let you know
And if you think your tears are gonna change my mind
I'm not gonna waste your time
I'll remind you what I told you
You'd be laughing until you cry
I told ya
You'd be laughing 'til you cry, cry back to me
You'd be laughing 'til you cry, cry back to me

If you think I'd take you back you must be dreamin'
(You're dreamin')
If you think I'd understand I've got no reason (no reason)
And if you think that this ain't fair take what you're given
I knew there would be a time you would cry back to me

I hope you had a good time baby girl we finito
You done crossed the line so I ain't countin free throws
You brought out the best in me
It's all in this verse
So I'm addin' up the recipe 'cause bitches gotta eat too
How you feelin' like a million bucks
Wait, you used to feel it when I beat it up
But now others gon' tell me how it feel
They be standin' in a line and they know I know the deal
Real man on the tracks 'cause I tell it how it is
Whole past was a game
So familiar with the tricks
Yeah you knew em all
I was blind deaf or dumb not to see that
You must've had a stash where you hid all your cheats at
Think you can play me
Baby girl you're crazy
I was in the studio with Divy and Faydee
So I had to put it down it's gotta tear you apart
That you knew I had a dozen other bitches from the start (wassup)

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
You're gonna have to let this go
Didn't wanna say I told you so oh oh
But someone had to let you know
And if you think your tears are gonna change my mind
I'm not gonna waste your time
I'll remind you what I told you
You'd be laughing until you cry
I told ya
You'd be laughing 'til you cry, cry back to me
You'd be laughing 'til you cry, cry back to me
