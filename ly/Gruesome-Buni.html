		  (Sebz Beats, baby)
Ya-yo, ya-yo

Let me buck one of them, I'm yingin' him up
Gruesome, doc' ain't fixin' him up
Any mash on sale, man pickin' it up
Any opp I spot, I'm liftin' it up (lift it up)
Fuck gyal good, man's fuckin' it up
Mek gyal buss 'fore bussin' my nut
I'm a madman, secret sick head, yuh know?
Shiesty B, were bookey, yuh know?

I get angry, my shit's bipolar
Big knocker will knock man over
He got hit from a range, no Rover
Wet you up, your boss and soldier (wet it up)
I'm livin' la vida loca
Gun lean, I still fling my shoulder
My shit swing, I don't wear no choker
Madman, sick in my head like Joker (madman)
You got bun up and still ain't glide (dickhead)
You got stitch up with lead inside (dickhead)
He touch me? Someone lied
Grab the snake and crucify (get 'em)
Me and twin, that's a scary sight
Rock-a-bye if I let that shine
Push it in then twist, quick rise
You don't want war? Better love your life (better love it)
Home boy, better love your life, better love your wife, better love them kids
I'm the- I'm the one that turn up shit
Quick to lose it when I turn off shit
Oi, Cali I smoke got my head back twis'
Ying that, ying, don't throw up your fist
All of my old opps, they know what it is
So for the new ones, best stay in your biz
Headshot gang lookin' for a headshot
Don't get gassed or I'll get your head popped
Turn gyal mad when I mek the bed rock
He got caught, left with a red top (dead boy)
Headshot gang lookin' for a headshot
Don't get gassed or I'll get your head popped
Turn gyal mad when I mek the bed rock
He got caught, left with a red top (ya-yo, ya-yo)

Let me buck one of them, I'm yingin' him up
Gruesome, doc' ain't fixin' him up
Any mash on sale, man pickin' it up
Any opp I spot, I'm liftin' it up (lift it up)
Fuck gyal good, man's fuckin' it up
Mek gyal buss 'fore bussin' my nut
I'm a madman, secret sick head, yuh know?
Shiesty B, were bookey, yuh know?
Let me buck one of them, I'm yingin' him up
Gruesome, doc' ain't fixin' him up
Any mash on sale, man pickin' it up
Any opp I spot, I'm liftin' it up (lift it up)
Fuck gyal good, man's fuckin' it up
Mek gyal buss 'fore bussin' my nut
I'm a madman, secret sick head, yuh know?
Shiesty B, were bookey, yuh know?
