		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Before this battlefield
We were on our way to better days
Rolling like a freight train
With no brakes
Into the future like we had it made

I can see the smoke
Rolling off your gun
And them lips
Tellin' me we're done
Sometime some of them shots, ya just can't outrun

When you're living in a war zone
With a heart full of bullet holes
And boarded up windows
We've been riding out this storm
For way too long
How we gonna call this house a home
Living in a war zone?

Before this battlefield
We were fighting on the frontlines
Now all that I can feel
Is this heart breaking on the other side

And I can see the smoke
Rolling off your tongue and
Them lips telling me we're falling outta love
Sometime some of them shots, ya just can't outrun

When you're living in a war zone
With a heart full of bullet holes
And boarded up windows
We've been riding out this storm
For way too long
How we gonna call this house a home
Living in a war zone?

Living in a war zone
With a heart full of bullet holes
And boarded up windows
We've been riding out this storm
For way too long
And are we gonna let this love run cold?
Living in a war zone
