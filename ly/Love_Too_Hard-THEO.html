		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This one is for when you need it
Please do not wear it out baby
Listen closely I mean it
When I say, hmm
Put your hands on my shoulders, your head on my chest
And let's dance
As we sway I'll whisper to you words of romance,
You're entranced
Spend our nights on jets
Wake up in Paris
That's the half of it, baby
Other half you'll get
If it does happen
It'll be worth the wait
Because I know nobody's perfect, but you still deserve it
I know you think I'm uncertain, but I know you're worth it
When you
Love you love too hard
Fall you fall apart
I don't mind at all
That's what makes you art
Love you love too hard
I don't mind at all, so
Put your head on my shoulder, your hands on my chest,
You need rest
As you fall I'll whisper to you songs of romance,
Force your laugh
That's the sweetest sound
When you turn around
Give that toothy little smile, babe
Love that shit to death
I'm so passionate
I won't hold it back baby
'Cause I know nobody's perfect, but you still deserve it
I know you think I'm uncertain, but I know you're worth it
Love you love too hard
Fall you fall apart
I don't mind at all
That's what makes u art
Love u love too hard
Fall you fall apart
Put your hands on my shoulders, your head on my chest
And let's dance
As we sway I'll whisper to you words of romance,
You're entranced
Spend our nights on jets
Wake up in Paris
That's the half of it, baby
Other half you'll get
If it does happen
It'll be worth the wait
Because I know nobody's perfect, but you still deserve it
I know you think I'm uncertain, but I know you're worth it
