		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a man of habits
Never have to think twice
Always one step ahead
I don't play nice
 
You won't see me talking
I don't tell you what's right
I won't give my opinion
When you're out of sight
 
Love is like a magnet, assembled underground
If you're a man of steel, the magnet pulls you down
Being stuck in quicksand, kicking back will make you drown
Love is like a magnet, sure to pull you down 
 
I'm a man of habits
Never have to think twice
Always one step ahead
I don't play nice
 
You won't see me talking
I don't tell you what's right
I won't give my opinion
When you're out of sight
