		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come on everybody clap your hands
Ah, you're looking good
I'm gonna sing my song and you won't take long
We're gonna do the twist and it goes like this

Come on let's twist again like we did last summer
Yeah, let's twist again like we did last year
Do you remember when things were really hummin'?
Yeah, let's twist again, twistin' time is here

Round 'n around 'n up 'n down we go again
Oh baby make me know you love me so and then
Twist again like we did last summer
Come on twist again, like we did last year
(Twist, yow)

Who's that, flyin' up there?
Is it a bird? No
Is it a plane? No
Is it the twister? Yeah

Yeah, twist again like we did last summer
Come on let's twist again, like we did last year
Do you remember when things were really hummin'?
Come on let's twist again, twistin' time is here

Round 'n around 'n up 'n down we go again
Oh baby make me know you love me so and then
Come on twist again like we did last summer
Girl, let's twist again, like we did last year
Come on twist again, twistin' time is here
