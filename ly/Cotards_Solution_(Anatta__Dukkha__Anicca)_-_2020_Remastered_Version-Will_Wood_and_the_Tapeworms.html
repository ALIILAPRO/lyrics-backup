		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What if the wind caught up with me, started to change when I did
Would I blow out like a light? Or like a kite fly away?
What if the fear of darkness gave way to the fear of color?
Would you live in black and white or rest your eyes through the day?

And if dreams can come true, what does that say about nightmares?
Iâ€™ll stay awake tonight

Cry my name, remind my brain of my identity
Iâ€™m not gonna listen, Iâ€™m not my volition, Iâ€™m
Sha Na Na Na Na Na Na Na free will
Am I to blame for riding this train right by my destiny?
Ah, prove I can crack, ah, loose from the track, ah
Sha Na Na Na Na Na Na Na free will

Rolling my third eye into the back
Of my head and squinting through the black
Saw no center, saw not where it lead
Itâ€™s times like this that make me wish thatâ€”
I wished that I were dead
I donâ€™t wish I were dead
But somebody's got to go

I wanna make my murder look like a suicide
But theyâ€™ll all know the bodyâ€™s mine
I wanna go anonymous to identify
But theyâ€™ll all know the bodyâ€™s mine

Divide by 1 and find Iâ€™m one less than the one I was
So how many people am I? Now that I keep â€˜em in my
Sha Na Na Na Na Na Memory, Still I
Check in the mirror to see how I look, I look different in different ways
Ah you do the math, ah, whoâ€™s looking back, ah
Sha Na Na Na Na Na Na Na that's not me.

Carving my initials in the back
Of my hand in case of losing track
I forgot, remember to forgive?
Itâ€™s times like this that make me wish thatâ€”
I wished that I could live
I donâ€™t wish I could live
But somebody's got to stay

I wanna make my murder look like a suicide
But theyâ€™ll all know the bodyâ€™s mine
I wanna go anonymous to identify
But theyâ€™ll all know the bodyâ€™s mine

And if dreams can come true, what does that say about nightmares?
Iâ€™ll stay awake tonight

I wanna make my murder look like a suicide
(Kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me)
But theyâ€™ll all know the bodyâ€™s mine
(Kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me)
I wanna go anonymous to identify
(Kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me)
But theyâ€™ll all know the bodyâ€™s mine
(Kill me, kill me, kill me)
