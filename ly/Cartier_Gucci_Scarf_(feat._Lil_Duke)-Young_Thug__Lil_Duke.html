		<p>
		  (48 Hertz)
(That's gon' get me rich)
(Prezzley P. Get you popped, nigga)
(Get your ass popped, boy)

Wipe the Cartiers off with the Gucci scarf
Wipe the Cartiers off with the Gucci scarf
Wipe the Cartiers off with the Gucci scarf
Wipe the Cartiers off with the Gucci scarf, yeah
I came from the top
Big big pointers in the watch, woo
Filled up a party with some thots, woo
Pillsbury Doughboy, where the molly? Yeah
I take the top of that Benz off
I take the top of your girl off
Richards the cost of your Murlock
Untop the top like a tanktop
I was just bringin' the bread out
I pour the syrup out
Mix red with the green like a turtle
And a lil' workout

Ayy, hopped out a Maybach coupe
Inside blue and the Patek came blue, ayy
I'm 'bout to spray your boo
Knock it out the park, you can call me Babe Ruth, ayy
I put the crap on the seat
All red guts, got the crap on the seat, ayy
Paralyze a nigga in the street, yeah
Riding with the carbon on the seat, hey
Pop out a new red Spider, yeah
I bought a new red Spider, bitch
Hit your own mama, don't wife her, yeah
Heard you dance just like her, bitch
I'ma take a bar, Lil Peep, ayy
Yellow school bus in my cheeks, ayy
Rolls Royce stars in the seat, yeah
Stars in the seat, yeah
I'm Justin Bieber-ed up
The Maybach, the coupe, but I keep it tucked
They couldn't stand down when I built it up
I'm riding 'round the town with the semi tucked
I got my bundles up
Back burner if you don't got no tummy tuck
Money only thing make it certain
I'ma come through like Big Worm

Wipe the Cartiers off with the Gucci scarf
Wipe the Cartiers off with the Gucci scarf
Wipe the Cartiers off with the Gucci scarf
Wipe the Cartiers off with the Gucci scarf, yeah
I came from the top
Big big pointers in the watch, woo
Filled up a party with some thots, woo
Pillsbury Doughboy, where the molly? Yeah
I take the top of that Benz off
I take the top of your girl off
Richards the cost of your Murlock
Untop the top like a tanktop
I was just bringin' the bread out
I pour the syrup out
Mix red with the green like a turtle
And a lil' workout

Hey, hoppin' out the Lambo' coupe
I forgot the roof, ballin' like swoosh, hey (swoosh)
Spittin' like I lost a damn tooth
All my dawgs go roof, boy, you cuffin' the swoop, hey (swoop)
I left the streets and I went to the booth
No hesitatin', I'ma shoot, hey
I'm 'bout to get something new
I'ma geek that bitch up, I'ma paint that bitch blue, hey (skkrt)
I'ma leave him dead in the street
Throw him in the river, won't find him for a week, hey
All of my hoes, they freaks (freaks)
She ain't got my money then her ass gettin' beat, bitch
Shoot that bitch up with the stick
Had the Glock in the spot, pretty bitch suckin' my cock
She bad and she know that she got a fat ass
How could I not? Hey (how could I not)
They're screaming my name (name)
They singing my shit all in Spain (Spain)
Kick so much shit, need a cane (kick it)
I'm blowing on good Mary Jane, hey
Look at my mama up
YSL hot as a sauna, we up (sauna, we up)
Up like a Tonka truck (Tonka truck)
Not OJ Mayo, but I get the bucks

Wipe the Cartiers off with the Gucci scarf
Wipe the Cartiers off with the Gucci scarf
Wipe the Cartiers off with the Gucci scarf
Wipe the Cartiers off with the Gucci scarf, yeah

I pour the syrup out
Mix red with the green like a turtle
And a lil' workout
