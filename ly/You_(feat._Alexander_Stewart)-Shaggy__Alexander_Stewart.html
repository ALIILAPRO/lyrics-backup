		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You, you, you
Girl, I see you, you, you, ayy

In a crowded room with noise, I hear your voice
With a sea of people, you're my only choice
(Come on)
From a distant summer, you captured my heart
I been hit by Cupid, baby

'Cause all I see is you, you, you, you, you, you, you
(All I see is you, girl) all I see is you, you, you, you, you, you, you
(Come on) 'cause all I see is you, you, you, you, you, you, you
(All I see, girl) all I see is you, oh

Gyal, you give me tunnel vision
It's like I got blinders on (all I see is you)
And there's no doubt or question
Who I got my mind on (all I see is you)
I think about you all day long
I wanna be with you all night (come on)
Through everything, you hold me down
You're always by my side (ayy)
When they try to plot and scheme
To come between you and me (all I see is you)
And in all honesty, I decline respectfully

'Cause all I see is you, you, you, you, you, you, you
(All I see is you, girl) all I see is you, you, you, you, you, you, you
(All I see, girl) 'cause all I see is you, you, you, you, you, you, you
(All I see, girl) 'cause all I see is you, oh

Aye
All I see is you
All I see is you

Ay, gyal you got di boomting I just have to confess this (all I see is you)
I make it known dem gyal out di road can't try disrespect this (all I see is you)
Baby, let me hold you tight
I wanna be with you all night
I'm gonna give you real love
That you can feel when I dim the lights
When they try to plot and scheme
To come between you and me (all I see is you)
(Uh) and in all honesty, I decline respectfully

'Cause all I see is you, you, you, you, you, you, you
'Cause all I see is you, you, you, you, you, you, you
'Cause all I see is you, you, you, you, you, you, you (ohh)
'Cause all I see is you, oh (ohh)

In a crowded room with noise, I hear your voice
With a sea of people, you're my only choice
From a distant summer, you captured my heart
I been hit by Cupid, baby

'Cause all I see is you, you, you, you, you, you, you
'Cause all I see is you, you, you, you, you, you, you
'Cause all I see is you, you, you, you, you, you, you
'Cause all I see is you, oh
