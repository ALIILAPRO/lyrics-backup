		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Does you really don't know where the avenuers go?
Are you lyin' through your teeth or are they payin' through your nose?
A set of manners and a smile is all they want you for
But we can talk about it later, you can read it in the paper
I hated you away from the very start
I seen you stickin' to your smile, it's gone and broken my heart
Now the wind is makin' work of every step on the bridge
You say, "I used to say we found each other, now I don't know where he is"
You get that feel, make your spirit shine
I let her prise apart my ribcage like a crackhead at the blinds
It hurt, but come the downing of the scrapyard sun
There is no light falls on our failure, it ain't covered in the paper

Well, I really don't care what you think of me
But something gears me to the grovel every opportunity
I've got that jealous stripe, I probably am that type
I'll see you twenty Marys later, when your tongue is talking straighter
Heard he took 'em all down to the mercenary bar
I heard she broke up with her fella now he's drinkin' in his car
Nah, I'm not inclined towards the scandalous word
But on the subject of myself, I do believe what I heard
There is a track beneath the wheel and it's there 'til we die
She says, "I don't agree with nothing", I say, "Neither do I"
Go to sleep, there's not a thing can't be fixed with a dream
And we can talk about it later, you can read it in the paper

I bet ya, I bet ya
You had your smile, you had your smile
For the open mile
I bet ya, I bet ya
You had your smile, your face defile
For the open mile
I bet ya, I bet ya
I bet you now
I bet ya, I bet ya
I bet you now
I bet ya, I bet ya
I bet ya
I bet you now
