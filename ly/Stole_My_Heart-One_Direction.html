		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I waited for a girl like you)

The light shines
It's getting hot on my shoulder
I don't mind,
This time it doesn't matter
'Cause your friends,
They look good and you look better

Don't you know all night I've been waiting for a girl like you to come around, 'round, 'round?

Under the lights tonight
You turned around, and you stole my heart
With just one look, when I saw your face
I fell in love
It took a minute girl to steal my heart tonight
With just one look, yeah
I waited for a girl like you

I'm weaker
My worlds fall and they hit the ground
Oh life, come on head, don't you fail me now?
I start to say,
"I think I love you", but I make no sound

You know 'cause all my life, I've been waiting for a girl like you to come around

Under the lights tonight
You turned around, and you stole my heart
With just one look, when I saw your face
I fell in love
It took a minute girl to steal my heart tonight
With just one look, yeah
I waited for a girl like you

There is no other place that I would rather be
Than right here with you tonight
As we lay on the ground I put my arms around you
And we can stay here tonight
'Cause there's so much that I wanna say, I wanna say

Under the lights tonight
You turned around, and you stole my heart
With just one look, when I saw your face
I fell in love
It took a minute girl to steal my heart tonight

Under the lights tonight
You turned around, and you stole my heart
With just one look, when I saw your face
I fell in love
It took a minute girl to steal my heart tonight

With just one look, yeah
I waited for a girl like you
I waited for a girl like you
