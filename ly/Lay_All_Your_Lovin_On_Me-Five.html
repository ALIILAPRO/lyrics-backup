		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This one right here
Is for all you freaks
Get it on
(C'mon)

Now I know what I like
And I like what you got
Get me hot
Make me wanna come
And hit you in the freaky spot
And any way you wanna write it
Get excited, don't you fight it
Baby you know, you know, you know
You know I wanna hit you off
On the source to the rough
Like we did it Friday night
So we're feelin' like we take it off
Now if you wanna come and get it
Don't you fight it
Guarantee you won't regret it
As we kick it better place
Check it out

High heels, black leather
Fire even better
Try me any weather
I wanna give it to ya lady
Now or never

Lay all your loving on me
(You know I'm gonna get ya)
Lay all your loving on me
When the heat gets fat
You won't find a better man
So come on
Lay all your loving on me

Strap with the fly high
Let it down to the toast
She even got leather pantyhose
And only I know
This the girl's nasty
Looking at me
You know, you know, you know
She's got tattoos of cupids
Got me all on
Dangerous with the G's and the thong on
So the next time a girl hits you with the line
Make it up for me
Make a move for the baseline

High heels, black leather
Fire even better
Try me any weather
I wanna give it to ya lady
Now or never...
