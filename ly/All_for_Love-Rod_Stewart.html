		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When it's love you give
I'll be your man of good faith
When in love you live
I'll make a stand, I won't break
I'll be the rock you can lean on, oh
Be there when you're old
To have and to hold

When there's love inside
I swear I'll always be strong
And there's a reason why
I'll prove to you we belong
I'll be the wall that protects you, yeah
From the wind and the rain
From the hurt and the pain, yeah, oh

Let's make it all for one and all for love
Let the one you hold be the one you want
The one you need
'Cause when it's all for one it's one for all
When there's someone that you know
Then just let your feelings show
And make it all for one and all for love

When it's love you make
I'll be the fire in your night
Then it's love you take
I will defend, I will fight
I'll be there when you need me
When honor's at stake
This vow I will make, yeah

That it's all for one and all for love
Let the one you hold be the one you want
The one you need
'Cause when it's all for one it's one for all
When there's someone that you know
Then just let your feelings show
And make it all for one and all for love

Don't lay our love to rest
'Cause we could stand up to the test
We got everything and more than we had planned
More than the rivers that run inland
We got it all in our hands

Now it's all for one and all for love
Let the one you hold be the one you want
The one you need
'Cause when it's all for one it's one for all
When there's someone that you know
Then just let your feelings show
When there's someone that you want
When there's someone that you need
Let's make it all, all for one
And all for love
