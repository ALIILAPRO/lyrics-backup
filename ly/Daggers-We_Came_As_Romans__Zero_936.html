		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When my back's to the wall, I will conquer

I see the mountain ahead, I feel the thunder roar
I hear the fury within, but louder than before
Feeding the voice in my head, and now it's fighting back
I can't go through this again, no, I'm not turning back this time
It's eye for an eye

Draw the dagger
Cut out the pain, to find the power
Draw the dagger
Cut out the pain, I will conquer

Draw the dagger
Draw the dagger

Yeah, I been locked down, broke up out it, I don't even try to talk to doubt no more
Washed out, holding down this inner fear that I don't think about won't cure
This shit that's inside of me trying to crawl out
Walking around in this armor they aim and they target me like this a motherfucking fall out between us
The reason I can't seem to crawl out will never be you
So if anybody want to talk I'ma cut that shit off
I been dealing with me vs myself since I learned how to walk
How the fuck you think you gonna get involved?
I've been trynna find the heart within the person I've become
Don't you try to get between it less you wanna meet your god
Or a nameless facade or whoever you'll blame when you're gone motherfucker

Draw the dagger
Cut out the pain, to find the power
Draw the dagger
When my back's to the wall, I will conquer

You're gone motherfucker

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
There's no escape from the wrath in my eyes
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
There's no escape from the wrath in my eyes

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
There's no escape from the wrath in my eyes
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
There's no escaping this time

No mercy

Draw the dagger
Cut out the pain, to find the power
Draw the dagger
Cut out the pain, I will conquer

Draw the dagger
Draw the dagger
When my back's to the wall, I will conquer
