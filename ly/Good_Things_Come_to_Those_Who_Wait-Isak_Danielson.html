		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I walked a million miles to find a god
I heard she opens up the sky and stars above
The road has many obstacles to meet
I crossed the ocean, mountains and the empty streets

I stopped along the way but I always carried on
There was nothing in the world that could stop me

I want the fire in their eyes
I want applause that never dies
The moment when I feel alive is when the lights are burning bright
I want to move you 'til you cry
There's only me inside your mind
I remember if she's here what she would say
"Good things come to those who wait"

Many years have passed and I'm still here
And the end of this endeavor is nowhere near
The power that she has is still so strong
Will she ever let me in and take me home

I stop along the way but I always carry on
There is nothing in the world that can stop me

I want the fire in their eyes
I want applause that never dies
The moment when I feel alive is when the lights are burning bright
I want to move you 'til you cry
There's only me inside your mind
I remember if she's here what she would say
"Good things come to those who wait"

Out harder days, never lose their faith
Keep holding on, even when tides are strong
Don't go without a fight
You can leave it all behind
It's all or nothing and I will follow her

I want the fire in their eyes
I want applause that never dies
The moment when I feel alive is when the lights are burning bright
I want to move you 'til you cry
There's only me inside your mind
I remember if she's here what she would say
"Good things come to those who wait"

Good things come to those who wait
