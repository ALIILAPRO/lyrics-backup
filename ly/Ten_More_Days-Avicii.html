		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ten more days under water
And I already know
I'll be fine
Ten more days 'till it's over
'Till the darkness goes
And I see the light

I'm torn between
Fulfilling my wildest dreams
To satisfy the beast inside of me
And I grounded love

That raises me high above
The grabbing hands of cowards
And of thieves
Ten more days to find my way
Ten more days 'till I'm awake
Ten more days 'till I don't have to fight

I don't need a future king
There ain't a prayer that I could sing
Ten more days and I'm gonna make it right
You see my conscience betrayed me
But baby I'm strong enough to take the tides
The bed it trembles beneath me

But wherever the road is rough
You know I'll rise
I'm torn between
Fulfilling my wildest dreams

To satisfy the beast inside of me
And I grounded love
That raises me high above
The grabbing hands of cowards
And of thieves
Ten more days to find my way
Ten more days 'till I'm awake
Ten more days 'till I don't have to fight
I don't need a future king
There ain't a prayer that I could sing
Ten more days and I'm gonna make it right
Ooo
