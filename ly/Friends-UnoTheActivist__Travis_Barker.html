		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah
I got a couple questions for y'all
Y'all niggas not them, man
Just a few questions
Ayy yo, Travis, this him right here, ain't it?

Why can't we all just be friends? Yeah
Is it because my diamonds make you feel some type of way? (Ooh)
You told me you would kill for me the other day
I know why we cannot be friends, yeah
Hate and jealousy got one thing in common 
Yeah, I know what love is, a promise is not promised
Promise, yeah, I promise love will blind you
Might have broke your promise but my problems is my problems

Carry the stick like Travis Barker
Now I drip more like Travis Barker
Take your bitch and then transport her
Your bih' like me and that's extortion
To the water I escort her
Take her places like Honduras
You are poor
We don't hang 'cause I don't trust these niggas' morals (ooh, dig)
Don't know what got into that boy
Count so much money I'm developing a boil
Racks jumping out the air like they just got deployed
These niggas sour, they sour, they spoiled
So I got a big stick hit me with the light oil
These niggas hating, ain't making no noise
This a two-seater, girl, jump in for joy

Why can't we all just be friends? Yeah
Is it because my diamonds make you feel some type of way? 
You told me you would kill for me the other day
I know why we cannot be friends, yeah
Hate and jealousy got one thing in common 
Yeah, I know what love is, a promise is not promised (dig)
Promise, yeah, I promise love will blind you
Might have broke your promise but my problems is my problems 

Yeah, fuck you doing ho? Fuck out my vicinity
Ooh, she the swoop, act like she still got her virginity
Ooh, fuck her for a long minute, I got energy
Ooh, all these legs surrounding my body like a centipede (dig)
Ooh, she can't trust a soul, gotta keep it G
Ooh, gotta keep this pole on the side of me
Ayy, your closest friends are your enemies
Uh, get you shot on sight 'cause a nigga try to run up, I'ma let this bih' fly

Why can't we all just be friends? Yeah
Is it because my diamonds make you feel some type of way? 
You told me you would kill for me the other day
I know why we cannot be friends, yeah
Hate and jealousy got one thing in common 
Yeah, I know what love is, a promise is not promised (dig)
Promise, yeah, I promise love will blind you
Might have broke your promise but my problems is my problems 

Why can't we all just be friends? Yeah
Is it because my diamonds make you feel some type of way? 
You told me you would kill for me the other day
I know why we cannot be friends, yeah
Hate and jealousy got one thing in common 
Yeah, I know what love is, a promise is not promised (dig)
Promise, yeah, I promise love will blind you
Might have broke your promise but my problems is my problems
