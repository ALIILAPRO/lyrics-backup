		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember when, I remember
I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo in so much space

And when you're out there without care
I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you
Who do you think you are?
Ha ha ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control

Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little, it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

But baby I'm crazy
Baby you're crazy
Baby we're crazy
Probably

But baby I'm crazy (baby I'm crazy)
Baby you're crazy (baby you're crazy)
Baby we're crazy (baby we're crazy)
Probably
