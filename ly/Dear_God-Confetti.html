		  [Intro]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah

[Chorus]
Dear God, where'd ya go?
You haven't been answering your phone
Not sayin' I'm mad but the world is fucked up So you should come around more
Oh dear God, I hate to say
People don't believe in you these days
Not saying I don't but the world is fucked up So you should come around more

[Verse 1]
Oh dear God, we haven't talked in a while
I'm all grown up now but still feel like a child
And I'm sorry that I only holla when I need a favor
But all my people really need a savior
Enough about me, what about you dawg
You beefin' with science?
And by the way I got some bad pressure in my sinus
It may be a migraine, it may be the climate change But who am I to talk, I haven't recycled in 5 days, yeah

Dear God, we still celebrate Christmas
'Cause the novelty of holidays is really big business
You heard the prophecy of ol' Saint Nic
I heard this year he got Ms.Claus some big fake tits
And the longer you go missin'
The more the story's twistin'
And people count the days to make their birthday wishes And it's never gon-never gonna change
So you should come around more

[Chorus]
Oh dear God, where'd ya go?
You haven't been answering your phone
Not sayin' I'm mad but the world is fucked up So you should come around more
Oh dear God, I hate to say
People don't believe in you these days
Not saying I don't but the world is fucked up
So you should come around more

[Verse 2]
Goddamn, people say that I'm insensitive
And that I use your name in vain and I should be more sensitive (uh-ho ho) But I bet they mean more secretive
To not expose the hypocrite in every walkin' piece of shit
And hiding is insulting your intelligence
That fake-ass walking 'round in Sundayâ€™s best
When they know the world revolves around money and sex
The worst people are the first to forget (uh)

[Bridge]
Ooo-na-na-na, oh no
I bite my tongue but can't change how I think Ooo-na-na-na
I talk to you because I can't afford a shrink Ooo-na-na-na
It's the everyday people who do the ugliest things And it's never gon-never gonna change
So you should come around more

[Chorus]
Oh dear God, where'd ya go?
You haven't been answering your phone
Not sayin' I'm mad but the world is fucked up So you should come around more
Oh dear God, I hate to say
People don't believe in you these days
Not saying I don't but the world is fucked up So you should come around more

[Refrain]
Oh dear God, and it's never gon- never gonna change So you should come around more
Oh dear God, and it's never gon- never gonna change So you should come around more
And it's never gon- never gonna change
So you should come around more
Oh dear God, and it's never gon- never gonna change So you should come around more

[Outro]
