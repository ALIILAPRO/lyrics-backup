		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wandering in the dark,
Dodging all the cars
And I wonder if I'm gonna make it home
Hey hey hey! Im ok
Sometimes I just get a little sad
Hey hey hey, you're ok.
Don't you know that Life aint so bad
Yeah I cut off all my friends,
It's better off for them.
Cause this time, they'll know why.
Hey hey hey! Im ok
Sometimes I just get a little sad
Hey hey hey, you're ok.
Don't you know that Life aint so bad
Stuck inside my mind,
Another night confined
Don't tell me it's gonna be alright
The smile is hurting now,
Well you don't like the frown,
But I feel, like I'm about to drown
Everything's fine, everything's fine
I don't mean to make you worry
Its all in my mind, all in my mind
Life gets a little too scary
There's nothing you can do
There's nothing you can do
There's nothing you can do
There's nothing you can do
(Let me go)
There's nothing you can do
There's nothing you can do
(Just let me go)
There's nothing you can do
There's nothing you can do
(Let me go)
