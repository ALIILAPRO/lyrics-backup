		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know they say that the space between
Can make it stronger than we've ever seen
They might be right but I disagree
'Cause I've never felt stronger than when you're with me

Sometimes I wonder why you even care
'Cause even when I leave you're always there with me
And like a candle makes a brighter place
This mark you've made on me can't be erased 

I wanna be so far gone in you
So far nothing else will ever do
I wanna be so far gone in you
In you

I've stood alone and I've fallen down
Your hands were there to pick me off the ground
Sometimes I cry cause I can't believe
Your love is big enough to cover me

Sometimes I've wondered if you're even there
But when I feel far away you meet me there
And like a candle makes a brighter place
This mark you've made on me can't be erased
Yeah

I wanna be so far gone in you
So far nothing else will ever do
I wanna be so far gone in you
In you

I wanna be so far gone in you
So far nothing else will ever do
I wanna be so far gone in you
In you I wanna be lost

I wanna be lost in you
Like a ship in the night
I wanna get lost in you
Underneath your sky

I wanna be lost in you
Like a ship in the night
So far gone tonight

I wanna be so far gone in you
So far nothing else will ever do
I wanna be so far gone in you
In you

So far gone in you
In you
In you
So far gone in you
