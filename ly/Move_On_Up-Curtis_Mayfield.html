		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hush now, child
And don't you cry
Your folks might understand you 
By and by
Just move on up 
Towards your destination
Though you may find, from time to time
Complication

Bite your lip 
And take a trip
Though there may be wet road ahead
And you cannot slip
Just move on up 
For peace you will find
Into the steeple of beautiful people
Where there's only one kind

So hush now, child 
And don't you cry
Your folks might understand you 
By and by
Move on up 
And keep on wishin'
Remember your dream is your only scheme
So keep on pushin'

Take nothing less
Than the supreme best
Do not obey rumors people say
'Cause you can pass the test
Just move on up 
To a greater day
With just a little faith, if you put your mind to it
You can surely do it
