		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When will I learn to stop me making the same mistakes again?
Same mistakes again for you
When will I learn to lock my heart so it doesn't break again? No
Doesn't break again in two

I should've known, should've known by now
That I was always gonna come back around
Back in the day, you know you let me down
Thought maybe I finally figured you out

'Cause you said that things would be different
But all that turned out to be fiction
Breaking dishes in the kitchen
Walking on glass, babe
You say it's space that you're needing
I say, "Well fuck it, I'm leaving"
But history keeps on repeating

When will I learn to stop me making the same mistakes again?
Same mistakes again for you
When will I learn to lock my heart so it doesn't break again? No
Doesn't break again in two

When will I learn that I, I can do better?
I can do better, much better than you
When will I learn to stop me making the same mistakes again?
Over and over again, over and over again

I'm all out of new words to say (words to say)
Runnin' on empty, out of reasons to stay (To stay)
My friends told me it would go this way
They call me stupid when I say that you've changed

But you said that things would be different
But all that turned out to be fiction
History keeps on repeating

When will I learn to stop me making the same mistakes again?
Same mistakes again for you
When will I learn to lock my heart so it doesn't break again? No
Doesn't break again in two

When will I learn that I, I can do better?
I can do better, much better than you
When will I learn to stop me making the same mistakes again?
Over and over again, over and over again

I should know better, I should know better
I should know better, tell me why, yeah
I can't remember, I can't remember
The way it hurts me every time

When will I learn that I, I can do better?
I can do better, much better than you
When will I learn to stop me making the same mistakes again?
Over and over again, over and over again

When will I learn to stop me making the same mistakes again?
Same mistakes again for you
When will I learn to lock my heart so it doesn't break again? No
Doesn't break again in two
