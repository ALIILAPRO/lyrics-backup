		  I'm so glad I've found this 
I'm so glad I did 
I'm so glad I've found this 
I'm so glad I did 

People are fragile things, you should know by now 
Be careful what you put them through 

People are fragile things, you should know by now 
You'll speak when you're spoken to 

It breaks when you don't force it 
It breaks when you don't try 
It breaks if you don't force it 
It breaks if you don't try 

People are fragile things, you should know by now 
Be careful what you put them through 

People are fragile things, you should know by now 
You'll speak when you're spoken to 

With one hand you calm me 
With one hand I'm still 
With one hand you calm me 
With one hand I'm still

People are fragile things, you should know by now 
Be careful what you put them through 

People are fragile things, you should know by now 
You'll speak when you're spoken to 

You'll speak when you're spoken to 
You'll speak when you're spoken to 
He'll speak when he's spoken to 
She'll speak when she's spoken to
