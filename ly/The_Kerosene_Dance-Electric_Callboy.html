		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I tell you a story 
I swear it is true 
I never met a girl 
I despise more than you 
Day by day its hard to handle 
This fucking mess inside my head 
A dance on the edge of the heart 
So ugly 
So starved 
And if this curtain falls 
You'll be nothing more than a fuck 
I've given up and always too much 
What you've given to me? 
Nothing less than a touch 
You try to drag me down 
But I'm so much stronger today 
You're goddamn worthless 
Like
The cig's in your ashtray 

Do you remember? 
I've given up myself 
Don't want to feel this way again 
Fuck you whore 
Say goodbye 

Do you remember? 
My world turns into a lie 
Don't want to feel this way again 
Fuck you whore 
Say goodbye 

With every step you changed your face 
Your greatest pleasure was 
My moments of disgrace 
The hell with you! 
You mentally retarded whore! 
I've tried my best again and again 
Always cursed the moment 
Where it began 
So many times you made me feel 
That I've been the mistake in your life 
Thank you for nothing 
For all your lies 
You try to drag me down 
But i'm so much stronger today 
You're goddamn worthless 
Like
The cig's in your ashtray 

Do you remember? 
I've given up myself 
Don?t want to feel this way again 
Fuck you whore 
Say goodbye 

Do you remember? 
My world turns into a lie 
Don't want to feel this way again 
Fuck you whore 
Say goodbye 

Fuck you whore, you're nothing to adore! 
Fuck you whore, you're nothing to adore! 
And if this curtain falls 
You will be nothing but a
And if this curtain falls 
You will be nothing but a
Fuck!
