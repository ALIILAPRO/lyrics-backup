		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It is time for us, you are alone
And what if I just got your uh

Tell me you got the power
And I say uh
You say you got the power
And I say no no no
Tell me you got the power
And I say uh
You say you got the power
And I say no no no
No I say uh, No I say uh
You say you got the power, Oh I say uh
No I say uh, No I say uh
You say you got the power
No I say uh

You know sometimes I remember
I have to say it was all you had
Just let me take my time
What if I got mason stages in our hands

It is time for us, you are alone
And what if I just got your uh

Tell me you got the power
And I say uh
You say you got the power
And I say no no no
Tell me you got the power
And I say uh
You say you got the power
And I say no no no
No I say uh, no I say uh
You say you got the power, oh I say uh
No I say uh, no I say uh
You say you got the power
No I say uh
