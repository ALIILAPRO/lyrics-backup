		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I once begged you to love me
Now I’m doing it again 
Turns out that it's just very hard
To truly love yourself
If I ever figure it out
I won't be such a child
I’ll be a brand new woman 
You won’t recognise me

It could be more than a daydream
If only I grew the spine (Mmh)
To leave a note to tell you
That we’ve kissed for the last time (Mmh)
Getting in the car at sunrise
Purging my old life
I could be a wild woman
A dot on the horizon

Oh God!
How does it feel to breathe?
There’s always been a feral dog (Ooh)
Clawing its way out of me
If I ever let her see 
The light of day 
Then maybe
I could be a wild woman (Ooh)
A brand new woman
I could be a wild woman (Ooh)
And I’d never have to beg you

A glass of wine
Might calm me down
Am I foaming at the mouth? (Ah)
Scratch marks on the bed frame
And tears in the new towels (Ah)
Well before they’ve left my throat 
I’m eating my own words 
“Baby, I’m a wild woman
And I don’t care if that hurts you”

Oh God!
How does it feel to breathe?
There’s always been a feral dog (Ooh)
Clawing its way out of me
If I ever let her see the light of day 
Then maybe
I could be a wild woman (Ooh)
A brand new woman
Oh what a wild woman (Ooh)
I could be
I could be 
I could be
I could be 
I could be
I could be
