		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I got all the drugs in the world that you need
We get high to pass time but bitch I ain't no fiend
I got money on my mind, I be stacking my green
Shawty said she like my style, I be dripping with ease
Please don't send me naked pictures, I don't like to be teased
Say she got that Super Soaker, well girl just let me see
I ain't worried 'bout shit, these niggas ain't scaring me
I was destined for this life, this is my destiny
Friends wanna be friends when you doing the most
How you tell me you my bro then you went out and told
Niggas say they down to ride but be folding like clothes
Purple hearts all on my garment, I ain't trusting a soul

I roll up the Mary Jane, no they can't feel my pain
I'm still trapping everyday, I think I'm stuck in my ways
If you looking for a handout get the fuck out my face
I don't care about no friends because they all were just fake
In my inbox like I owe you, I got this by myself
I was broken down bad when you said you would help
Now I'm up, they love to hate me, that's just bad for your health
And she say she a college girl but left her books on the shelf
She gon' fuck me like a porn star, a rock star
Trying to skrt off in that fast car, like NASCAR
Girl you know I got a cold heart
If I would give it to you, would you tear that shit apart
Red roses on my grave, bury me with art
And with some Backwoods and a lighter just so I could spark
Midnight rider, never put the car in park
I'm shining bright just like a light 'cause I came from the dark
I ain't never had nobody, put that on my mommy
I might have to catch a body if you try to stop me
She ride like a Kawasaki and she like it sloppy
Oh you got a hotty body, come ride on my Johnny
I'm go show you the wave, just give me some space
Why you all up in my face like you need a taste
Good designer on my waist, shooters keep the K
I tell them boys to play it safe, don't lay in your grave
I ain't never taking time off, I'm steady grinding
I'm never lying, was never crying
Take flights I'm flying, no you can't see me
Say you need me but you deceive me

And I got all the drugs in the world that you need
We get high to pass time but bitch I ain't no fiend
I got money on my mind, I be stacking my green
Shawty said she like my style, I be dripping with ease
Please don't send me naked pictures, I don't like to be teased
Say she got that Super Soaker, well girl just let me see
I ain't worried 'bout shit, these niggas ain't scaring me
I was destined for this life, this is my destiny
Friends wanna be friends when you doing the most
How you tell me you my bro then you went out and told
Niggas say they down to ride but be folding like clothes
Purple hearts all on my garment, I ain't trusting a soul

Said I ain't never forgotten, not a soul worth remembering
'Cause all these motherfuckers turn to foe when they envy
So I don't talk, I work hard
'Cause you could be someone today and just be nobody tomorrow
She said I'll never be shit but a goddamn rock star
That blunt ash on the floor
Well she ain't that far off
Said she ain't that far off
Roll, smoke
That's all we know
Toke
Took a drag out that Wood now she goin' for my wood
So we going to my hood
Yea she gonna get it good
Yea she know who we are
She want this rock star life and she said I'm going far
And she off a bar
And she can't feel her face no more
Yeah she off a bar and she can't feel her face no more
She said she can't feel her face no more
