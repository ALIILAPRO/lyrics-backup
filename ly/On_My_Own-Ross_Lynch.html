		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It almost feels like it was just a dream
All these memories of you and me
Blown away in the summer breeze
It almost feels like we just never were
All the time we spent was just a blur
Now it's just me and a melody

So what am I supposed to do?
'Cause all these plans we made in the sand are through

Without you, I'm on my own
Am I gonna be alone?
And if it's only me, myself and I
Will I be fine?
So far from home
And I just don't know
Am I gonna make it?
Brave enough to take this road
Out on my own

And maybe I'm falling on my face
Or maybe I'm landing in my place
And maybe we're a million miles apart
Or maybe we're standing heart to heart
But no matter what, I'm walking right off this stage
And never looking back, looking back to yesterday
No way
No way

I'm on my own, yeah, yeah, yeah
As long as I got me, myself and I
I'm doing fine
So far from home
But now I know that I am gonna make it
Brave enough to take this road
Out on my own

It almost feels like it was just a dream
All these memories of you and me
