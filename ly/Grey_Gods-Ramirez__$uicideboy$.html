		  This for all you, this for all you
This for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you playa hataz

Flip my fuckin' cross, I don't need a Messiah
Fuck that crown of thorns
I got a crown of barbwire
Burn a fuckin' church
Light a blunt with the fire
Fumes got my head spinnin'
Like a fucking tire
Me and my whole clique are pariahs
Hittin' C notes like the choir
Hittin' C notes like Mariah
Your bitch wanna give me her saliva
Addin' six more bitches to the dick
Now that's the Hydra pride to the Odyssey
I fucked your mom's vagina
She was soft and wet like papaya
Suicide for hire, holes in my designer
Haters scope me like a fuckin' sniper
Me and $lick are rippin' blades
Waitin' to retire

This for all you, this for all you
This for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you playa hataz

It's the corpse creepin' up the graveyard
Snort an eight ball
Bullets fall like a raindrop on a stable 51
50 psych ward killer
Northside Gorilla, Grey59 militia
I'm a punk, get the picture
Shootin' junk through' my tissue
Walkin' solo with you chillin'
Sippin' lean with no filler
Triple the six, fuck a bitch
I get that itch I gotta scratch
You just a bitch, you never scrap
I got the demons on my back
They tellin' me is time
To fuckin' kill tonight
Ridin' with the lights dim and
The scope on sight what a thrill
What a thrill when the trigger finger pull
Bound for hell, fuck the law, pussyboy
Fuck you

This for all you, this for all you
This for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you playa hataz

Creepin' out the jungle, it's
The Silverback Gorilla, mane
Beatin' on my chest
I pull up then I blow your fuckin' brains
Throw your ligaments inside a pit and
Then I watch em' burn
Dancin' 'round the flames
I'm spittin' out these sacrificial words
Roll me up a blunt with the page
That I ripped out of the bible
I been feelin' homicidal
Grippin' on my fuckin' rifle
Bitch, you thinkin' that you safe but I
Find out where the fuck you stay
Pull up to your neighborhood and
Let the fuckin' gauge spray
Boy, I'm saucin', I do this often
I lay inside my coffin rottin'
I sit here plottin'
I'm skatin' down through Compton
Caution that when I'm chartin'
I'm 'bout to fucking rob 'em
Hang him from the crucifix and leave
His family just to watch 'em

This for all you, this for all you
This for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you playa hataz
