		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alright now
Alright, alright
Mm, oh, yeah
Ah, play

Ah, play it now, play
Come on out
Alright, boys
Let me hear ya
Yeah, hey
Yeah, yeah
Ah, get it, get it, get it
Ah, play
Hey
Let's do it

You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Quit snoopin' 'round my door
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Quit snoopin' 'round my door
You can wag your tail, but I ain't gon' feed you no more

You told me you was high classed
But I can see through that
Yeah, you told me you was high classed
But I can see through that
And daddy I know, that you ain't no real cool cat

You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Quit snoopin' 'round my door
You're just an old hound dog
Quit snoopin' 'round my door
You can wag your tail, but I ain't gon' feed you no more

Oh, play it now
Come on, play it where I can hear you now
Ah, we gon' mess around right here
Get it, get it, get it
Ha
Make you feel good

You make me feel so good
You make weep and moan
You make me feel so good
You make weep and moan
'Cause you ain't lookin' for a woman
All your lookin' for is a home

You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Quit snoopin' 'round my door
You're just an old hound dog
Quit snoopin' 'round my door
You can wag your tail, but I ain't gon' feed you no more
Ow
(Ow-ooh, woo, woo, woof, woo)
