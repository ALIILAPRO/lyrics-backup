		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Should've fixed
That shallow drift
A long time ago
I know, babe I know

You were right
About Summer times
They pull you in before you know

We were chasing the dream
We were running through doors
We were busy building a life
We were too tired to hear the creaks in the floor
When our head hit the pillow at night

Waves
Come after waves
We feel the break
We just keep running into waves
Come after waves
We feel the break
But we just keep running, running into waves

Shut the door, turn the key
Wave goodbye
To the front porch swing where you and I
Would sit and drink
​​​​​​​Dream and think
About the ladders we
Were gonna climb

Now a couple of kids who were
Up all night
Taking life too seriously
Got a couple of kids 
And house that's too small
Fighting while they're asleep

Shut the door, turn the key
Wave goodbye
Wave goodbye

Waves
Come after waves
We feel the break
We just keep running into waves
Come after waves
We feel the break
But we just keep running into waves

And it always happens slow
Lose your heart in the undertoe
Drifting farther than you know 
But I ain't letting you go 

And it always happens slow
Lose your heart in the undertoe
Drifting farther than you know 
But I ain't letting you go
No, I ain't letting you go

Waves
Come after waves
We feel the break 
We just keep running into waves
Come after waves
We feel the break
But we just keep running into waves
