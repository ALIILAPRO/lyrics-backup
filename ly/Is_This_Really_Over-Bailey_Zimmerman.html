		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't stand the thought of
Goodbye really being goodbye
This house can't get any colder
The way you slammed that door
And threw your car in drive
Never even looked over your shoulder

Is this really over?
'Cause I need some closure
And it's 10 AM and I'm still gettin' sober
Let's call it a bad night
Don't call it the last time
'Cause I feel that goodbye gettin' closer and closer
Is this really over? (Ooh)
Is this really over?

Yeah, we're gettin' pretty good at this
Should we settle down and call it quits?
I hate that I don't know if you're not comin' back
So I gotta ask

Is this really over?
'Cause I need some closure
And it's 10 AM and I'm still gettin' sober
Let's call it a bad night
Don't call it the last time
'Cause I feel that goodbye gettin' closer and closer
Is this really over? (Ooh)
Is this really over?

Haven't really heard our last song
Haven't really had our last dance
Have I really used up my last one more chance?

Is this really over?
'Cause I need some closure
And it's 10 AM and I'm still gettin' sober
Let's call it a bad night
Don't call it the last time
'Cause I feel that goodbye gettin' closer and closer
Is this really over? (Ooh) oh
Is this really over, over, over?

Can't stand the thought of
Goodbye really being goodbye
Is this really over? (Ooh)
