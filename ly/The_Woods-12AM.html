		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hate me, baby i would hate me too
Fire don't burn unless it's close to you
These scars I gave you always hurt me too
It's hard to love when you've
Been broke in two

O-o-o oohhh, I've been turning in the woods
O-o-o oohhh, this pain is so misunderstood
And if I can't have you only for my own
Leave you six feet under when my casket glows

Just fight baby, wait for the day
This fake masquerade
You'll take to your grave

You'll die here in the woods
You'll die here in the woods
You'll die here in the woods
You'll die here in the woods in the woods
You'll die here in the woods

Hate me, baby i would hate me too
Left you lonely, life ain't made for two
Drag me under 'till my face went blue
That loaded gun you never say you shoot

O-o-o oohhh, I've been turning in the woods
(help me)
O-o-o oohhh, this pain is so misunderstood
And if I can't have you only for my own
Leave you six feet under when my casket glows

Just fight baby, wait for the day
This fake masquerade
You'll take to your grave

You'll die here in the woods
You'll die here in the woods
You'll die here in the woods
You'll die here in the woods in the woods
You'll die here in the woods

Hey you'll die here in the woods
Hey you'll die here in the woods
Hey you'll die here in the woods
Hey you'll die here in the woods
