		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it sick of me to need control of you?
Is it sick to make you beg the way I do?
Is it sick of me to want you crawling on your knees?
Is it sick to say I want you biting down on me?

Are you sick like me?

Am I beautiful (beautiful)
As I tear you to pieces? (As I tear you to pieces?)
Am I beautiful? (Am I beautiful?)
Even at my ugliest you always say
You're beautiful (beautiful)
As you tear me to pieces (as you tear me to pieces)
You are beautiful (beautiful)
Even at your ugliest I always say

You're beautiful and sick like me

Is it sick of me to feed the animal in you?
Is it sick to say I tease the hunter like I do?
Is it sick of me to watch the wicked way you thrill?
Is it sick to say I live to break your will?

Are you sick like me?

Am I beautiful (beautiful)
As I tear you to pieces? (As I tear you to pieces?)
Am I beautiful? (Am I beautiful?)
Even at my ugliest you always say
I'm beautiful (beautiful)
As you tear me to pieces (as you tear me to pieces)
You are beautiful (beautiful)
Even at your ugliest I always say

You're beautiful and sick like me (like me, me, me)

Am I beautiful
As I tear you to pieces?
I am beautiful
Even at my ugliest you always say
You're beautiful
As I tear me to pieces (as I tear you to pieces)
Am I beautiful
Even at your ugliest I always say

You're beautiful
As you tear me to pieces (as you tear me to pieces)
You are beautiful (you are beautiful)
Even at your ugliest I always say
You're beautiful and sick like me
