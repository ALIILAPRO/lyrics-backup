		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I went looking at pictures I didn't wanna see
They brought back memories
You look happy, I guess 
Got the life that you wanted but it ain't with me
You would think by now that I wouldn't care 
It's been a couple years 
And yeah, I've had my share
Of other broken up hearts but I only shed real tears over ours

Now I'm in this cold bright light
And this don't even feel like life
'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me
Religiously (religiously)
And now I'm in the back of the church
Praying just to stop the hurt
'Cause I don't have the only woman who was there for me
Religiously (religiously)

Remember watchin' you play me our song on guitar
I thought I'd marry you
Act like I'm happier now but all of my friends know that ain't the truth
And lately life's been good to me
Mama's healthy and I'm helpin' out the whole family
Lot of people know my name, I made a little change
But that don't mean nothin'

'Cause now I'm in this cold bright light
And this don't even feel like life
'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me
Religiously (religiously)
And now I'm in the back of the church
Praying hard just to stop the hurt
'Cause I don't have the only woman who was there for me
Religiously (religiously)

You brought me to God and I put you through Hell
You were all about us, I was all about myself
What kind of man would lose a woman like that?
If my soul could be forgiven, I would give it all back

Now, I'm in this cold bright light
And this don't even feel like life
'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me
Religiously
And now I'm in the back of the church
Begging God just to stop the hurt
'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me
Religiously (religiously)
I ain't got the only woman who was there for me
Religiously
