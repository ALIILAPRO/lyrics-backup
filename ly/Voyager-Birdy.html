		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Watching satellites
Lying in the grass
I know our days are numbered
But you don't know that I feel like that

You don't hear solitude calling me away
And the hardest part is part of me wants to stay

I won't wait for you
I'm already gone
Like moonlight leaves with the dawn
I won't wait for you
The night's too long
I'm a voyager and I voyage on

Clouds move like paint
Changing in the sky
If the wind is on my side
Might leave tonight

I hate to disappoint you but I've always been this way
And I know you need me here but I know that I won't stay

No, I won't wait for you
I'm already gone
Like moonlight leaves with the dawn
I won't wait for you
The night's too long
I'm a voyager and I voyage on
I'm a voyager and I voyage on

Ooh-ooh, ooh

No, I won't wait for you
I'm already gone
Like moonlight leaves with the dawn
I won't wait for you
The night's too long
I'm a voyager and I voyage on
I'm a voyager and I voyage on
On
