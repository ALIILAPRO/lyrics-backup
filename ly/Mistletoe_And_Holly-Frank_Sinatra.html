		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, by gosh, by golly
It's time for mistletoe and holly
Tasty pheasants, Christmas presents
Countrysides covered with snow

Oh, by gosh, by jingle
It's time for carols and Kris Kringle
Overeating, merry greeting
From relatives you don't know

Then comes that big night
Giving the tree the trim
You'll hear voices by starlight
Singing a yuletide hymn

Oh, by gosh, by golly
It's time for mistletoe and holly
Fancy ties and granny's pies
And folks stealin' a kiss or two
As they whisper, "Merry Christmas" to you

Then comes that big night
Giving the tree the trim
You'll hear voices by starlight
Singing a Yuletide hymn

Oh, by gosh, by golly
It's time for mistletoe and holly
Fancy ties and granny's pies
And folks stealin' a kiss or two
As they whisper, "Merry Christmas" to you
