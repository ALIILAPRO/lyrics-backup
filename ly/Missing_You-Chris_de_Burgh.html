		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been missing you

I've got the roses, I've got the wine
With a little luck she will be here on time
This is the place we used to go
With romantic music and the lights down low
And as you stand there amazed at the door
And you're wondering what all this is for
It's just a simple thing from me to you
The lady that I adore, 'cause there's something
That you should know, it's that

I've been missing you, more than words can say
And that I've been thinking about it every day
And the time we had just dancing nice and slow
And I said now I've found you
I'm never letting go

There is no reason to the things that we do
You can break a heart with just a word or two
And take a lifetime to apologize
When the one you love's in front of your eyes
And I will fall to my knees like a fool
If it's the only way of getting through
You see if I think you are beautiful
Someone else is going to feel it too
So there's only one thing to do, tell you that

I've been missing you, more than words can say
And that I've been thinking about it every day
Well tonight's our night for dancing nice and slow
Because now I've found you, I'm never letting go
No, now I've found you, I'm never letting go

I've been missing you, I've been missing you
I've been missing you, I've been missing you, darling
