		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All my actions don't make me, take a wrong direction
Aight, do I gotta say that?
Look (Great John on the beat, by the way) 
Look, huh

All my actions don't make me, take a wrong direction (yeah)
I pray to God to do shit right but still make left decisions (yeah)
They do shit for the Internet, they do it for a mention (yeah)
I bless my brothers, we get knocked, but we won't speak or mention shit, huh
I'll be there, no you not alone
Know we trappin' out of them vacancies even though I had a home, huh
I'm one phone call a way, huh
Just took my dawgs away, but
One call's all it takes to, to get you gone today, look

Many stoves, plenty digits, huh
We been runnin' through them tunnels like it's Tubman with us
Used to book me every chance they get, but, bitch, I never read it
Always went to school, coulda been a scholar
But I chose to be a gangster and I don't regret it
Tell 'em I ain't done yet (I ain't done yet)
Disrespect and you still livin', I ain't done yet (I ain't done yet)
I bet he'll be missed, but I don't be missin' when I draw my gun, yeah
If they catch me first, yeah
Take the L and then my niggas gon' send somethin', yeah
They ain't think I woulda made it far with all this pain in my life, huh
They don't wanna see us winnin', nigga, but of course we do, right? Huh
That gun on me, still flex on 'em, huh
Please do not test over here 'cause it ain't no regrets over here, look

All my actions don't make me, take a wrong direction 
I pray to God to do shit right but still make left decisions 
They do shit for the Internet, they do it for a mention
I bless my brothers, we get knocked, but we won't speak or mention shit, huh
I'll be there, no you not alone
Know we trappin' out of them vacancies even though I had a home, huh
I'm one phone call a way, huh
Just took my dawgs away, but
One call's all it takes to, to get you gone today, look

Gun on my waist, huh 
I bet I shoot up the place, huh
Or maybe I won't, huh
Bad little bitty, Casamigos and then I'm all in her kidney, huh, huh
I used to dream about this, I had to be patient, huh
Love don't live here, baby girl, that space is vacant, huh, huh
Never die, I put the pole where your melon at
I could wear hats, still won't never cap
Still on the block where them fellas at, uh-uh, uh-uh
Lawyer still beatin' the case, huh
They tryna send me away, huh
Guess I'll be doin' the race (guess I'll be doin' the race)

Trappin' out of them vacancies even though I had a home, huh
I'm one phone call a way
Just took my dawgs away, but
One call's all it takes to, to get you gone today, look
