		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you stay up all night like I do
Do you hide all your tears for the bathroom
So you're parents don't see
Care what everyone thinks
So you throw out the one who swore they'd never leave
Does it hurt when you see all my pictures
Wear the hoodie I gave back when we were
"So-Called" in love
Did you mean all the stuff
Did you think that I'm stupid and won't catch your bluff
I thought you would've called me by now
Tell me all the things you're sorry about
Cause I'm done fighting
Do you even care how I am
Cause if you did you'd try to work it out
Take your pride and then you'd throw it down
You say it's not worth it
But I did nothing wrong and still I'm the one hurting
Replaying the things you never told me bout
You could've been honest, built a stable ground
I know you feel burdened
But I thought you'd try harder to not lose your person
Did you think Id be moving on easy
Did you know I would have trouble sleeping
Are you thinking bout me
Question how i might be
Only love makes you wonder bout all of things
I thought you would've called me by now
Tell me all the things you're sorry about
Cause I'm done fighting
Do you even care how I am
Cause if you did you'd try to work it out
Take your pride and then you'd throw it down
You say it's not worth it
But I did nothing wrong and still I'm the one hurting
Replaying the things you never told me bout
You could've been honest, built a stable ground
I know you feel burdened
But I thought you'd try harder to not lose your person
One slip away
From just falling apart
Can't face our grave
Can we go back to the start
When you made me happy
How'd we go from nothing to something
To just ending
Replaying the things you never told me bout
You could've been honest, built a stable ground
I know you feel burdened
But I thought you'd try harder to not lose your person
