		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So here we go again
My heart is wearing thin
Fell in love with the ways that you kill
Me Do or die, you and I we're guilty
One look into your eyes
They speak in alibis
Tie me up in a crime of
Passion Take me down like an
Assassin
The dark is where you lie
It's hello and it's goodbye
Oldest story ever told
Hold me til we both go cold
Ya I'm on the edge but
I'm not quite critical
Now you're in my head like a
Love sick criminal
And it's the same
Shit every time
So here we go again
My heart is wearing thin
Fell in love with the ways the you kill me
Do or die, you and I we're guilty
One look into your eyes
They speak in alibis
Tie me up in a crime of passion
Take me down like an assassin
You make it hard to breathe
Another ace up your sleeve
Your fingerprints on the
Weapon, I'm Never gonna learn
My lesson
So do your worst and for
Gods sake finish it
I'm addicted to your type of
Punishment
And it's the same shit every time
So here we go again
My heart is wearing thin
Fell in love with the ways that you kill me
Do or die, you and I we're guilty
One look into your eyes
They speak in alibis
Tie me up til in a crime of passion
Take me down like a assassin
Should've known better from the last time
You said you won't come back again
But now I know better for the next time
You come crying
So here we go again
My heart is wearing thin
Fell in love with the ways that you kill me
Do or die, you and I we're guilty
One look into your eyes
They speak in alibis
Tie me up in a crime of passion
Take me down like a assassin
You kill me.
