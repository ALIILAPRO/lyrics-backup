		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do not take what is not yours
Do not step on sacred land
Do not cross the borderlines
Do not harm the innocent
Do not talk about our loss
Do not hide behind your lies
Reputation crossed with ties
Leading to your inner child
(Ahhh)
Take your gun and run away
Hide, she gave you another day!
Run to the mountains, run to the hills
Choose another path than this
The Valley of peace the hidden land
You came and you took
With violent blood
The ghost of the past the hear the sound
Of everlasting war
The Valley of peace the hidden land
You came and you took
With violent blood
The ghost of the past they hear the sound
Of everlasting war
The Valley of peace the hidden land
You came and you took
With violent blood
The ghost of the past they hear the sound
Of everlasting war
Everlasting war
(Ahhh)
