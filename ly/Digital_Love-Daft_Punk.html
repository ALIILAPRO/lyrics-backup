		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Last night, I had a dream about you
In this dream, I'm dancing right beside you
And it looked like everyone was having fun
That kind of feeling, I've waited so long

Don't stop, come a little closer
As we jam, the rhythm gets stronger
There's nothing wrong with just a little, little fun
We were dancing all night long

The time is right to put my arms around you
You're feeling right
You wrap your arms around too
But suddenly, I feel the shining sun
Before I knew it, this dream was all gone

Ooh, I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
I wish this dream comes true

Ooh, I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
We'll make this dream come true

Why don't you play the game?
Why don't you play the game?
