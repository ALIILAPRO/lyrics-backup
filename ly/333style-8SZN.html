		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got runts in my shit get me gone 
Smoking til the c.M 
Smoking til dawn 


China white on ur streets 
My tunes got u tweaking like u off the b 
Got u itching like a fiend 
cnd if u in the way of bro then uno I hit a screen

Call my bro like what's the mission 
Today I made a killing 
 We ain't even leave a witness 
Chop city 
I'ma â€˜daemon'
With a business
I twiss my watch it's skeletal 
Yh uno this bitch is skinless 
Snowy trees like it's Christmas 
 
I put prada on my bitch 
Unknown on my brother 
Everytime I flip the switch 
It's 1 of 1 there ain't no other

Put a pinky down for 1v1s
Bro hit nuttin but net 
I could tell u that ur vest won't help 
My bro hit nuttin but necks 
cffiliate to who
Don't worry 
Tribe stay scattered round 
I couldn't care ab a postcode war 
My opps know I'm about 
U could catch me in the south 
Deptford shelling shows again 
I like it in the night 
Baddies out and they got hoes for friends
U can't trust em 
They all chose the bench 
Watch could never mention
I ain't into talking if I'm sober 
You could never question 
Can't fuck with all these influencers 
They just seek attention 
Pussy 
I can't hold u to u ur skinny jeans 
Loosen up 
These treesh women tryna claim me 
How could you fall in love 
Keep getting spotted in the streets by fans it's only up!
U can't drink this holy cup
My garms free cos I'm lit 
This ain't no holy luck 
Pussy 
Scars on fists 
Never told em went straight to class 
Just cos u never done that shit doesn't mean I can't 
I was in the library with beats to my fucking feet
No revision done I had bass booming all week 
Who really done the royal clbert hall before u hit puberty
I was dancing Hard Rock Cafe 
Trust me this ain't new to me
Built to perform 
Do it nasty 
Or do it kind 
Voted most likely to be famous 
Ima prove em right 
If u doubted my expansion 
Ima prove u wrong 
These niggas hurt 
Cos their bitch reciting all my songs 
Face long 
So confused how I flow like this 
Take down that chaos flick boy u do not own that pic 
I was wilding out 
Like hitman holla 
U can't duck these Ls
cin't talking church 
But bro got a love for ringing bells 
Like a fox I'm way too quick 
Can't catch me in the cells 
Catch catch me on a block 
Wont catch me wid a rock 
Oh well
