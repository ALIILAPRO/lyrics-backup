		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Contrast and compare
Between the busy ones
And the ones that don't care
Until there is no one
That you really know
So I drift through these days
Of appointments and promises made
They will all end up broken
And quickly replaced

Weeks are slow, days drag on
Even practice and parties seem long
But I found myself going
I guess there's nothing to do
Oh well
Group of kids, line of cars
More will show up after the bars close
There's this boredom that drowns everything
Bottles break, music plays
Conversations competing for space
I look for a corner or a quieter room

There's no heat in this house
I can't breath with these words in my mouth
But I'm not going to say them
Yeah, I've made that mistake before
On the stairs, she grabs my arm
Says, "Whats up, where you been
Is something wrong?"
I try to just smile
And say, "Everything's fine"
