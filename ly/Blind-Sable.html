		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The beauty of your imperfection
Still echoes loud within my mind
When I lost you I lost direction
Without you I feel so
Blind
Bleagh
You're so far out of sight
But not out of my mind
You're a leech, parasite
But the kind I don't mind
I cannot think, I cannot sleep
The thought of you took over reason
Your image's planted way too deep
So now it's heartbreak season
The beauty of your imperfection
Still echoes loud within my mind
When I lost you I lost direction
Without you I feel so blind
I'm still afraid to look behind
You left a print of your touch right on my heart
It starts to rot, decay now that we're apart
I don't fucking want to feel
I'd rather rip my own heart out of my chest
The beauty of your imperfection
Still echoes loud within my mind
When I lost you I lost direction
Without you I feel so blind
I'm still afraid to look behind
Without you I feel so blind
Bleagh
