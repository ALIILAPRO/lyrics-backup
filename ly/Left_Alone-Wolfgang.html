		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Crippled now my hands as my days fade away
Once lived a colored life quickly turned to grey
No matter how hard I try nothing stays the same
Maybe it would be better left alon
Idiot
Spinning round and around as my hands leave my side
I know that I've got a choice though it's dampened by my pride

All the day couldn't count and life passed me by
I should just leave this alone
My eyes roll back in my head so I can see my mind
The cuts I got will heal you see but the scars just swell in time
And we rise to our occasions detered by our shame
Blinded by your stupid visions just too great to obtain
