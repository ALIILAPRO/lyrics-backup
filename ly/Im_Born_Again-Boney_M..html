		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm born again, I feel free
No longer alone
A bright light is shinning
And shows me a world that I own
I can see my way through
I know I will walk beside you
All those prayers of mine weren't in vain
I'm born again
I'm born again, I feel free
There's a quite different me
No longer I'm tossed like a ship on an unruly sea
I've been blessed with a love
That's meant for the rest of my time
All those prayers they were not in vain
I'm born again
Since love touched my heart right
My life has a meaning
I feel I'm no longer drifting in space
I believe once again that there is a tomorrow
A brand new tomorrow I know I can face

I'm born again, I feel free
No longer alone
A bright light is shinning
And shows me a world that I own
I can see my way through
I know I will walk beside you
All those prayers of mine weren't in vain
I'm born again
All those prayers they weren't in vain
'Cause I'm born again
