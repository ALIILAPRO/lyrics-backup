		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I,
Was a fool to be
Thinking just of me
And I told myself we're better off this way

I,
Thought that leaving you
Was the thing to do
And I've regretted each and every single day

Darling we
Had a lot to learn
But our heart's returned
And nothing's in our way

[Chorus]
Back to you
I'm going back to you
No I didn't know what love was
But darling now I do
And I know it might sound crazy
But I've changed my point of view
Guess I always knew I'd find my way
Back to you

I,
Put our love behind
Cause I'd made up my mind
That I'd find a way to spend those lonely nights

I,
Thought out love was gone
But you proved me wrong baby
From the moment you came back into my life

Darling we
Had a lot to learn
But our heart's returned
And nothing's in our way

Back to you
I'm going back to you
No I didn't know what love was
But darling now I do
And my life has been so crazy
Just because of missing you

Living alone
Was hard to do
Now that I'm in your arms again
Make it forever more

[Chorus]
