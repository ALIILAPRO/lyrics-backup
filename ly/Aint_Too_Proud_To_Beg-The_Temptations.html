		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you wanna leave me
But I refuse to let you go
If I have to beg, plead for your sympathy
I don't mind 'cause you mean that much to me

Ain't too proud to beg and you know it
Please don't leave me, girl (don't you go)
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl (don't you go)

Now I've heard a cryin' man is half a man
With no sense of pride
But if I have to cry to keep you, I don't mind weepin' 
If it'll keep you by my side

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, girl (don't you go)
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl (don't you go)

If I have to sleep on your doorstep all night and day
Just to keep you from walkin' away
Let your friends laugh, even this I can stand
'Cause I wanna keep you any way I can

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, girl (don't you go)
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl (don't you go)

Now I've got a love so deep in the pit of my heart
And each day it grows more and more
I'm not ashamed to call and plead to you, baby
If pleading keeps you from walking out that door

Ain't too proud to beg and you know it
Please don't leave me, girl (don't you go)
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl (don't you go)

Baby, baby, baby (sweet darlin') 
Please don't leave me
