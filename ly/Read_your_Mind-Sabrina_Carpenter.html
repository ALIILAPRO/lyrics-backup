		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ahh

Made it clear when you told me (ahh)
Don't why but you gotta be lonely (ahh-ah)
Say it's hard but you make it look easy (ahh)
So I'm trying to live a reality (ahh-ahh)

Decompressin', tryna ease the tension
But you got me stressin'
Feelin' like I need to go and
You sneak up on me
Tell me that you miss me in your life

I can't read your mind
You say that you need to be alone
But night and day
Want me at your beck and call
You say you know that you might be crossin' the line
Wastin' all our time
To think that we could be casual
You're not my friend
And, baby, you never were
Why the fuss? If you say you just wanna be mine
I can't read your mind

Tell me what's gonna happen
When it's you and me in a room
But you know you can't have it?
Oh, I'll be laughing
When you say that you really have changed
Finally found your way
'Cause I'm close to your face, ahh-ah

Double checkin'
Did I get the message
In the way you intended?
Got me second guessing when you
Sneak up on me
Tell me that you need me in your life

I can't read your mind
You say that you need to be alone
But night and day
Want me at your beck and call
You say you know that you might be crossin' the line (uh, yeah)
Wastin' all our time
To think that we could be casual
You're not my friend
And, baby, you never were
Why the fuss? If you say you just wanna be mine
I can't read your mind

You say that you need to be alone
But night and day
Want me at your beck and call
You say you know that you might be crossin' the line

I can't read your mind
You say that you need to be alone
But night and day
Want me at your beck and call (want me at your beck and call)
You say you know that you might be crossin' the line
Wastin' all our time (time)
To think (think) that we could be casual
You're not (you're not) my friend (my friend)
And, baby, you never were
Why (why) The fuss? (The fuss?) 
If you say you just wanna be mine
I can't read your mind

Ha, oh, oh, ohh-la, mh-mh
