		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel my story's still untold
But I'll make my own happy ending
I guess I'd rather be alone
Than making do and mending

I think maybe I've outgrown this old town
I see you almost every day
And every time I turn around
Our love is stuck on replay

Replay
Replay
Replay
Replay

Every since we broke up
I've been afraid to go out
But I won't be a prisoner
Locked up in this house
I feel my story's still untold
But I'll make my own happy ending
But I'd rather be alone
Than making do and mending

Have I outgrown this old town?
I see you almost every day
And every time I turn around
Our love is stuck on replay

It's Murphy's law, I'm gonna meet you tonight
Just one match could relight the flame
And just when everything is goin' alright
All my hard work goes down the drain
And Murphy's law, I'm gonna meet you tonight
Just one match could relight the flame
And just when everything is goin' alright
Murphy's law's gonna strike again
It's gonna strike again
It's gonna strike again

What have I got to lose?
I'm so tired of complaining
Pretty soon I'll be breaking loose
And the scenery'll be changing
Now I'm back on my feet
Ain't looking over my shoulder
But if I put a foot wrong
I'll be goin' nowhere

When we talk, it gets around
There's other people's feelings
To think about, not just you and me
This small town mentality

It's Murphy's law, I'm gonna meet you tonight
Just one match could relight the flame
And just when everything is goin' alright
All my hard work goes down the drain
And Murphy's law, I'm gonna meet you tonight
Just one match would relight the flame
And just when everything is goin' alright
Murphy's law's gonna strike again

All my hard work keeps on going down the drain
All my hard work keeps on going down the drain
All my hard work keeps on going down the drain
All my hard work keeps on going down the drain

Murphy's law
Murphy's law
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Murphy's law (keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on)
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Murphy's law (keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on)
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
