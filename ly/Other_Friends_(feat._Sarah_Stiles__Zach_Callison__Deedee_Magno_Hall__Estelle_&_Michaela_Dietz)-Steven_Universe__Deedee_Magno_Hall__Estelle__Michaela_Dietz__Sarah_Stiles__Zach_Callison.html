		  Well, well, well, well, well
Let me get a look at the menagerie
You must be Amethyst
You must be Garnet
And Pink Diamond's Pearl, well
She took you with her?
Isn't that just swell?

(It can't be)
Oh, but it can be and it is
I've got a new style
And a few new toys
That are gonna put an end to your happily ever after
Once and for all

(Whoa, whoa)
(This, this has got to be a misunderstanding)
(In case you haven't heard, I've established peace across the)

Yeah, yeah, I've heard
I've had your little message to the universe
On loop

I just love that part
Where Pink Diamond spends the rest of her days
On this nowhere planet
With a bunch of nobodies

That's right, I heard the story over and over again
Gee, it's swell to finally meet her other friends
That's right, I heard the story, don't really like how it ends
Gee, it's swell to finally meet her other friends

What did she say about me, what did she say?
What did you do without me, what did you do?
Did you play games without me, what did you play?
Did you think all this time that I wouldn't find out about you?

Ah, that's right, I heard the story over and over again
Gee, it's swell to finally meet her other friends

She's running circles around us
I'm rusty, give me a break
It really is her, but she can't be serious
You know her, Pearl? Can you tell us who she is?

Who am I? Who am I? What are you even saying?
I'm the loser of the game you didn't know you were playing!
Let's play another game, this time I get to win
Lives on the line
Winner takes all
Ready or not
Let's begin

Oh, that's right I heard the story over and over again
Gee, it's swell to finally beat her other friends
Oh, that's right I heard the story, don't really like how it ends
Gee, it's swell to finally beat her
Other
Other
Other friends
