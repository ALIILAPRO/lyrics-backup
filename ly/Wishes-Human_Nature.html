		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I wish that I could turn back time 
I check myself 'cause I was way out of line 
I only hope that we can start all over again 

I must admit that I was more than wrong 
I used your heart like a stepping stone 
Please forgive a fool who doesn't know what to do 
What do I do 

And I wish that I cuold have just one more chance 
And I wish that I could be your pillar of strength 
And I pray that you will see that what I'm sayin' is true 
'Cause I, I wish for you 

In my mind I can see your face 
You're on the breath of every word I say 
If there's anyone to place the blame on- it's me 
Baby can't you see? 

And I wish that I cuold have just one more chance 
And I wish that I could be your pillar of strength 
And I pray that you will see that what I'm sayin' is true 
'Cause I, I wish for you 

I wish for you 
I wish for you (for you) 
Oh baby I wish 

I really miss you baby 
I think about you baby (all night long) 
I really need you baby 
I want to hold you baby 
Stay (won't you stay) with me 
Just stay with me 

And I wish that I cuold have just one more chance 
And I wish that I could be your pillar of strength 
And I pray that you will see that what I'm sayin' is true 
'Cause I, I wish for you 

I wish for you 
I wish for you (for you) 
Oh baby I wish 
For you
