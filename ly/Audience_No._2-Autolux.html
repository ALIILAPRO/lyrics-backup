		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In between the thinking and the saying
Threw away what I can't believe
Tell me how you lose this feeling
All moods have been dealt and played
Tell me how you lose this feeling
All hands have been cut and waved
I have always been your vegetable
And you my Swedenborg
I would drop myself through black holes
To end up at your door
There's no one else to get hung about
And there's nothing else makes you twist
You set yourself up
The lightning bolt hit
You watched yourself change
And no one's left to blame
The helicopter's spotlight shaking
Hungry Orson on the make
The less you put yourself in
The less you feel so fake
Suddenly I'm alright
And it's time for you to go
You set yourself up
The lightning bolt hit
You let yourself change
Now everyone's to blame
And the gulf sign split the screen up
And the gulf sign split the screen up
And the gulf sign split the screen up
And the gulf sign split the screen up
And the gulf sign split the screen up
And the gulf sign split the screen up
