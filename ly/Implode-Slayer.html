		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So is it just me, can everyone can see
The world drowning in its own blood?
Humanity's decline, dismantled over time
A fossil drying in the mud
Deception and the greed that germinates the seeds
Of dissent growing all around
Is this the beginning or the end?
In darkness we descend
And I can't wait to see it all go down

Standing room only all the world will attend
Front row center to the ultimate end
Mankind constantly parading its flaws
Tangled in charades of the orthodox laws
Like a firestorm raging out of control
Ignorance of all has taken its toll
It seems that blame is your personal hell
Dish it out to anyone but never yourself

Implode
No resurrection of divine
Implode
Extermination of the swine

Sick of this shit called policy
Life support for a dead economy
Brain dead leaders of the world conspire
Acting with malice only fuels the fire
No wonder people of religion obsess
All it wants a man to do is confess
Arrogance will never let the fools concede
You know you're gonna have to stand and watch them bleed

Implode
Cleansation of mankind
Implode
Extermination of the Swine

So many still ask why
I've said a million times
There's nothing godly looking over us
It's just the choice you make
I'll still inject the hate
That brings finality to the fuss
Society will bleed
So watch the violence breed
And deconstruct the protocol
And if I'm proven wrong
I think you know the song
I'm pretty sure that God still hates us all

Standing room only all the world will attend
Front row center to the ultimate end
Mankind constantly parading its flaws
Tangled in charades of the orthodox laws
No wonder people of religion obsess
All it wants a man to do is confess
Arrogance will never let the fools concede
You know you're gonna have to stand and watch them bleed

Implode
Cleansation of mankind
Implode
Extermination of the swine

No resurrection of divine
Extermination of the swine
It's the cleansation of mankind
No resurrection of divine
Extermination of mankind
