		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get a load of me, get a load of you
Walking down the street, and I hardly know you (hardly know you)
It's just like we were meant to be

Holding hands with you when we're out at night
Got a girlfriend, you say it isn't right (isn't right)
And I've got someone waiting too

What if this is just the beginning?
We're already wet, and we're gonna go swimming

Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you?
Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you?
It's inevitable, it's a fact that we're gonna get down to it
So tell me
Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you?

(Whenever I think about you)
(Whenever I think about you)
(Whenever I think about you)
(Whenever I think about you)

Isn't this the best part of breaking up?
Finding someone else you can't get enough of
Someone who wants to be with you too

It's an itch we know we are gonna scratch
Gonna take a while for this egg to hatch (but wouldn't it)
But wouldn't it be beautiful?

Here we go, we're at the beginning
We haven't fucked yet, but my head's spinning

Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you?
Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you?
It's inevitable, it's a fact that we're gonna get down to it
So tell me
Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you?

High enough for you to make me wonder
Where it's going
High enough for you to pull me under
Something's growing
Out of this that we can control
Baby, I am dyin'

Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you?
Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you?

Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you?
Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you?
It's inevitable, it's a fact that we're gonna get down to it
So tell me
Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you?

(Whenever I think about you)
(Whenever I think about you)
(Whenever I think about you)
(Whenever I think about you)
