		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Calling out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat?
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancing in the street
They're dancing in Chicago (dancing in the street)
Down in New Orleans (dancing in the street)
In New York City (dancing in the street)

All we need is music, sweet music (sweet, sweet, sweet music)
There'll be music everywhere (everywhere)
There'll be swinging, swaying
And records playing
Dancing in the street, oh

It doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on, every guy, grab a girl
Everywhere around the world
They'll be dancing (dancing in the street)
They're dancing in the street (dancing in the street)

This is an invitation across the nation
A chance for folks to meet
There'll be laughing, singing, and music swinging
Dancing in the street

Philadelphia, PA (dancing in the street)
Baltimore and D.C., now (dancing in the street)
Can't forget the Motor City (dancing in the street)

All we need is music, sweet music (sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet music)
There'll be music everywhere (everywhere)
There'll be swinging, swaying (swaying)
And records playing (playing)
Dancing in the street, oh

It doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on, every guy, grab a girl
Everywhere around the world
They're dancing
They're dancing in the street (dancing in the street)

Way down in L.A. (dancing in the street)
Every day, they're dancing in the street (dancing in the street)
Let's form a big, strong line (dancing in the street)
Get in time, we're dancing in the street (dancing in the street)
Across the ocean blue (dancing in the street)
Me and you, we're dancing in the street
