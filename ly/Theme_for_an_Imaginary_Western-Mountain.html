		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the wagons leave the city
For the forest and further on
Painted wagons of the morning
Dusty roads where they have gone

Sometimes travelin' through the darkness
Met the summer comin' home
Fallen faces by the wayside
Looked as if they might have known

Oh, the sun was in their eye
And the desert that dry
In the country towns
Where the laughter sound

Oh, the dancing and the singing
Oh, the music when they played
Oh, the fire that they started
Oh, the girls with no regret

Sometimes they found it, sometimes they kept it
Often lost it along the way
Fought each other to possess it
Sometimes died in sight of day

Oh, the sun was in their eye
And the desert that dry
In the country town
Where the laughter sounds

Oh, the sun was in their eye
And the desert that dry
In the country towns
Where the laughter sound
