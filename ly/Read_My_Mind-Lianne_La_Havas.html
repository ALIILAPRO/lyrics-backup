		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So right, but make a baby tonight
Throw my life away, oh, I'll die another day
Feels like I've got nothing to hide
Serendipity, I noticed you noticed me
Those eyes caught by surprise
If I look again, oh, what's gonna happen then?

A sweet joy when a girl meets a boy
It happened naturally, mmh, better believe 
Mmh, could you possibly be any closer to me, boy?
Not a thing you can do 'cause I'm coming for you

Yes it's time (what you waiting)
Read my mind (what you waiting)
Seek and you will find (what you waiting for?)
(What you waiting, what you waiting for?)
Oh, it's love, nothing more (what you waiting, what you waiting)
What you waiting for?
(What you waiting, what you waiting for?)
Oh no, it's time

Oh, no, you're everywhere that I go
In my head again, oh, stuck in my head again
A full force, nature taking her course
No need for hide-and-seek I'll let you find me
Loving like personified
I'm so into him, oh, I hope God is listening

The pure joy when a girl meets a boy
Naturally chemistry, oh, better believe 
Could you possibly be any closer to me, boy?
Not a thing you can do 'cause I'm coming for you

Yes it's time (what you waiting, what you waiting)
Read my mind (what you waiting)
Seek and you will find (what you waiting for? What you waiting)
Oh my, it's love (what you waiting for?)
(What you waiting, what you waiting)
Nothing more (what you waiting)
What you waiting for?
(What you waiting, what you waiting for?) I'm yours

Oh boy (what you waiting)
Read my mind (what you waiting, what you waiting)
Seek and you will find (what you waiting for? What you waiting)
Oh my, it's love (what you waiting for?)
(What you waiting, what you waiting)
Nothing more (what you waiting)
What you waiting for?
(What you waiting, what you waiting for?) 
(What you waiting, what you waiting for?) 

Mmh, could you possibly be any closer to me, boy?
Not a thing you can do 'cause I'm coming for you, boy

(What you waiting, what you waiting)
(What you waiting, what you waiting for?)
(What you waiting, what you waiting for?)
(What you waiting, what you waiting for?)

Could you possibly be any closer to me, boy?
Not a thing you can do 'cause I'm coming for you, boy
