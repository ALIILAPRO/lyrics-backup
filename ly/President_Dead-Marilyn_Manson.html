		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is for the people, they want you
This is for the people, they want you
This is for the people, they want you
Getting high on violence, baby

President Dead is clueless and he's
Caught in a headlight police state 
God, and his skull is stained glass

Incubated and jet set the bitter
Thinkers buy their tickets to go find
God, like a piggy in a fair

And we don't want to live forever
And we know that suffering is so much better

This is for the people, they want you
This is for the people, they want you
This is for the people, they want you
Getting high on violence, baby

Give the pills time to work, we
All can't be martyred in the
Winter of our discontent (getting high on violence, baby)

Every night we are nailed into place and
Every night we just can't seem to
Ever remember the reason why (getting high on violence, baby)

And we don't want to live forever
And we know that suffering is so much better

(This is for the people, they want to)
(This is for the people, they want to)
(This is for the people, they want to)
(Getting high on violence, baby)

And we don't want to live forever
And we know that suffering is so much better
And we don't want to live forever
And we know that suffering is so much better
And we don't want to live forever
And we know that suffering is so much better
