Yeah yeah yeah 
Come clean 
Fix up 
Tell all spill guts off the veil 
Stand revealed
Show the card bring it on break the seal 

Ladies and gentlemen 
Step right up and see the man who taught the truth 
Swing the noose again 
Pierce the apple skin 
You bit more than you need 
Now you're choking on the bad seed 
On the bad seed

Drop through the sky 
Spit it up spit it out
