		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You saw him in the back room
In the darkness solitude
You pulled him from the prism
He thought he'd found a home
He looked into the mirror
She had no reflection
A room of knives
Deception
A veil
Of words
All lies
Remember what's forgiven
Remember all the sin
Remember what's departed
Remember how he let you in
Deception
Deception
Deception
She walks through a field of swords
Veiled eyes led by words
She follows a shadow vision
As it cuts her memory
She climbs up to the tower
A shadow lets her in
He sleeps over a tomb stone
Nine swords hang over him
Remember what's forgiven
Remember all the sin
Remember what's departed
Remember how he let you in
Remember what's forgiven
Remember all the sin
Remember what's departed
Remember how he let you in
