		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All that I have, is all that you've given me
Did you never worry, that I'd come to depend on you
I gave you all my love, that I had in me
Now that I've found you lied, I can't believe it's true

Wrapped in his arms, I see you across the street
I can't help but wonder, if he knows what's going on
You talk about that love, but you don't know how it feels
When you realize, that you're not the only one

You'd better stop, before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop, before you go and a break my heart
Oh whoa, you'd better stop

Time after time, I've tried to walk away
But it's not that easy, when your soul is torn in two
So I resign myself, to it every day
Now all I can do, is leave it up to you

You'd better stop, before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop, before you go and a break my heart
Oh whoa, you'd better stop

You better stop if you love me
Oh it's time to be sorry
No it won't last forever
I can't believe you walked out on me

You'd better stop, before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop, before you break my lonely heart
Whoa whoa you better, whoa whoa
Whoa oh you better stop
Better stop babe
