(Clouds)

I know you say
That you don't like it complicated
That we should try to keep it simple
But love is never ever simple
No

Someday
You're gonna see the things that I see
You're gonna want air that I breathe
You're gonna wish you never left me

Here we go again
Another go-round for all of my friends
Another non-stop, will it ever end?
Here we go again
Another go-round for all of my friends
Another non-stop, will it ever end?
We're never coming back down
Yeah, we're looking down on the clouds

I know you said
That you don't like it complicated
That you are tired of all the changes
But love is always, always changing
Whoa

Someday
You're gonna see the things that I see
You're gonna want the air that I breathe
You're gonna wish you never left me

Here we go again
Another go-round for all of my friends
Another non-stop, will it ever end?
Here we go again
Another go-round for all of my friends
Another non-stop, will it ever end?
We're never coming back down
Yeah, we're looking down on the clouds

And we go
And we go
And we go
And we don't stop (clouds)

But we don't
No we don't
No we don't
Never go up (clouds)

And we go
And we go
And we go
And we don't stop (clouds)

But we don't
No we don't
No we don't
Never go up

Here we go again
Another go-round for all of my friends
Another non-stop, will it ever end?
Here we go again
Another go-round for all of my friends
Another non-stop, will it ever end? (Here we go again)

(And we go, and we go, and we go and we don't stop) Here we go again
Another go-round for all of my friends (here we go again)
(But we don't, no, we don't, no, we don't ever grow up)
Another non-stop, will it ever end? 
Here we go again (here we go again)
(And we go, and we go, and we go and we don't stop)
Another go-round for all of my friends 
Another non-stop, will it ever end? (Here we go again)
