		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wake from your sleep
The drying of your tears today we escape we escape
Pack and get dressed before your father hears us
before all hell breaks loose
Breathe keep breathing don't lose your nerve
breathe keep breathing
I can't do this alone
Sing us a song a song to keep us warm
there's such a chill such a chill
You can laugh a spineless laugh
We hope your rules and wisdom choke you now
we are one in everlasting peace
We hope that you choke, that you choke
We hope that you choke, that you choke
We hope that you choke, that you choke
