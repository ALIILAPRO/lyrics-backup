		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (MITO)

Color in my moods (my moods)
No blues (blues)
Your violets on horizons
Forgot my screws (my screws)
My booze (shh)
My love brings all the lions
I don't assume that you knew (hey)
That I miss you when it's quiet
Oh, it's true, I want you (it's getting dark)
To tell me if I'm lying

Oh, I just came back from the moon
Found the lightning coming from your 눈
Violins holding onto your tune
My moods are swinging for you

Oh, I just came back from the moon
Found myself looking right at you
Violins playing into your tune
My moods are swinging for you

Color in my moods, no blues
Your violets on horizons
Forgot my screws and my booze
My love brings all the lions
Honey don't assume that you knew
That I miss you when it's quiet
Oh, it's true, I want you
To tell me if I'm lying

You know we spend so much time (too much time)
Just sinking holes in my mind
Our conversations last night (shh)
It got me thinking about you at
Four in the morning, rendezvous
You spend my feelings until I breakthrough
You were burning me, not setting me free
And I want to let you know

Oh, I just came back from the moon
Found the lightning coming from your 눈
Violins holding onto your tune
My moods are swinging for you

Oh, I just came back from the moon
Found myself looking right at you
Violins playing into your tune
My moods are swinging for you

Color in my moods, no blues
Your violets on horizons
Forgot my screws and my booze
My love brings all the lions
Honey don't assume that you knew
That I miss you when it's quiet
Oh, it's true, I want you
To tell me if I'm lying

As we're drowning
In the deepest seas
Bring down the sirens
I'll give you all of me

As I'm drowning
In the deepest seas
Bring down your sirens
I'll set you free (I'll set you free)

Color in my moods, no blues
Your violets on horizons
Forgot my screws and my booze
My love brings all the lions
Honey don't assume that you knew
That I miss you when it's quiet
Oh, it's true, I want you
To tell me if I'm lying
