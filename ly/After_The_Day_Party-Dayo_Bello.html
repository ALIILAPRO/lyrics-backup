		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say you think you're in love
(I thought we spoke about this)
You signed the dotted line
Im no villain in this story
I've ben honest from the start
You wanna be the one that holds me

You say you've never felt like this before
(And you've tried to stop it)
You say you've never felt like this before
(It's only cos you can't have me)
It better be the henny talking
Don't wanna have to end this
True, you're one of my best
Lets forget the shit you're saying

Girl tonight, i'll love you right
Girl tonight, i'll ease your mind
From the night until the early morning
We'll go on and on
Girl tonight, i'll ease your mind
I'll ease your mind
Just ease my mind
I'll ease your mind
Just ease my mind
Ooo
Yeah
