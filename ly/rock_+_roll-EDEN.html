		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So tell me this is who you are
They tell me I've got something more
And oh you could be loved
But I don't want the lights to find me when I'm dark and lost
But never on my own

'Cause I just wanna swing like Sinatra
Singing like I can't stop
'Cause I could never rock like a Rolling Stone
I just wanna live like the ones before
And maybe I could play guitar like Hendrix
Or save the world or end it
And then maybe you'll remember me when I'm gone
That's all I could ever want
That's all I want

So I got ten minutes to be all or nothing to
Whoever wants to hear
And I got ten weeks of talking bullshit on repeat 'till I'm burnt out and disappear
But I owe you nothing
And I own my luck
Oh they said you'll never be alone again
But I don't think you understand me or what I fear
But you could be loved
But I don't want to lie to tell myself
I'm more than all the mistakes I've out run

'Cause I'm only here for a minute
And I don't care what you say 'cause I know
You're only here 'cause I'm winning
But I can be my own kind of rock and roll like
I don't really care if you say you don't fuck with me
And I can say what the fuck I want 'cause its down to me
And I got love for you even if you are doubting me
Like oh my God I just can't stop

'Cause I just wanna sing like Sinatra
With ethanol my soundtrack
Cause I could never rock like a Rolling Stone
I wonder how it feels to burn out young, yeah
'Cause I just wanna die before my heart fails
From heartbreak or cocktails
Then maybe you'll cry once you know I'm gone
That's all I could ever want
Oh, that's all I want, yeah

'Cause I ain't scared of livin'
No I ain't scared of livin'
No I ain't scared of livin'

'Cause it's all we got
What are we breathin' for if we ain't living?
And I don't want your love
I just wanna feel like I'm still livin'
And if there is no God
I know the day I die I lived through heaven
And that I gave it Hell
And if it hurt, oh well
At least that's living

That's all I want
That's all I want
