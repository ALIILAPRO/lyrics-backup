		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I drive all alone, at night,
I drive all alone.
Don't know what I'm headed for.

I follow the road, blind.
Until the road is dead end.
Night's in my veins, it's calling me,
Racing along these arteries
And law, is just a myth
To herd us over the cliff.

I follow the road at night,
Just hoping to find
Which puzzle piece fell out of me.

I know who you are,
Open the door and climb in.
Hold me real close, then do it again,
I ache for the touch of my dead end friends
And oh, I gotta know
Is it dead
At the end of the road?
I can tell
By that look in your eyes,
We're the same,
My dead end friends and I

We drive all alone at night,
A never ending begins.
Sweet as a curse just out of reach,
Awakens the dead end part of me and oh,
No more wandering.
Just me and my dead end friends again.

Dead end friends
Dead end friends
Dead end friends
Dead end
