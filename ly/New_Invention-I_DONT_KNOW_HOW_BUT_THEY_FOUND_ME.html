		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've got the devil on your shoulder (shoulder, shoulder, shoulder)
You better shut your mouth just like I told ya (told ya, told ya)
You've been controlling me through fiction, it's obvious
I've got to break you like a bad addiction

Now I can't say no, I'm losing control
I'm having bad dreams
And nothing you can do will keep the bad things
Away from me until I fall asleep, bad dreams
Despite your good intentions
That girl is like an architect
And I am just the new invention
I am just the new invention
I am just the new invention

You've got to choose between your faces (faces, faces, faces)
Feels like you're running out of holy places (places, places)
And now the room is getting quiet (shh)
Oh, what a shame
Nobody taught you how to read and riot (riot, riot, riot)

Oh, bless my soul, I'm losing control
I'm having bad dreams
And nothing you can do will keep the bad things
Away from me until I fall asleep, bad dreams
Despite your good intentions
That girl is like an architect
And I am just the new invention
I am just the new invention
I am just the new invention

It's a miracle I'm standing
You're dragging me back into having
I'm having bad dreams
And nothing you can do will keep the bad things
Away from me until I fall asleep, bad dreams
Despite your good intentions
That girl is like an architect
And I am just the new invention
I am just the new invention (bad dreams, bad dreams)
I am just the new invention
I can't sleep
I am just the new invention
I can't sleep, I can't sleep
I am just the new invention
