		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will lead a wallpaper life
Or run away to the foreign legion
I will lead a wallpaper life
Or run away to the foreign legion

And as the tanks roll into town
As the tanks roll into town
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you

As the tanks roll into town
As the tanks roll into town
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you

I don't know why I feel so tongue-tied
I don't know why I feel so skinned alive

Run until your lungs are sore
Until you cannot feel it any more
Run until your lungs are sore
Until you find an open door

I build you up to pull you down
Tie you to your feet, and watch you drown
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
I build you up to pull you down
Tie you to the stake and watch you burn in hell

I don't know why I feel so tongue-tied
I don't know why I feel so skinned alive

I'll find another skin to wear
I'll find another skin to wear
