		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nigga, my gun go off - you see the barrel turning
You feel the hollows burning, nigga, now you're learning
Nigga, my gun go off - call it attempted murder
Nigga, I'm trying to murk you when I come back busting
Nigga, my gun go off - don't try to say I'm tripping
When I get to flipping and I smack the clip in
Nigga, my gun go off - we call it putting work in
Leaving niggas hurting, homicide's lurking
Nigga, my gun go off

Fuckboy, you can see it to believe it
Try to dodge and weave it, end up a paraplegic
Believe me, its easy, I'll hurt you, I'll murk you
I'll pop something, drop something, I ain't going to stop hunting
Run, run, 'til you're spun, one shot, one gun
One 911 emergency, it's murder, B
It's excellent execution when I'm pulling the trigger
No mistake for that cake, I'm hitting you and your niggas
Feel the flame when I aim for the top of your brain
See the spark and the bang, nigga, shit ain't a game
Do the math or get blast, bullets go through the glass
Goes through your ass fast and the leather seat in your Nav
Nigga, its not a war when there's casualties on one side, I ride
Turn it up on you nigga after Jake ride by
I click-clack, that's that, I don't flash, I mash
I wave the Uzi at them, I make a movie out them

Nigga, my gun go off - you see the barrel turning
You feel the hollows burning, nigga, now you're learning
Nigga, my gun go off - call it attempted murder
Nigga, I'm trying to murk you when I come back busting
Nigga, my gun go off - don't try to say I'm tripping
When I get to flipping and I smack the clip in
Nigga, my gun go off - we call it putting work in
Leaving niggas hurting, homicide's lurking
Nigga, my gun go off

You better lose yourself in the moment
Use it, fuck the music, I'mma let it go
You only get one shot before I back out and fire back
At your hat, your back, your ass crack, your nutsack
Your Cadillac, if you make it to that, I'm hitting that
The 70's was smack, the 80's crack
The 90's was grimy, millennium MACs, man
Clips on the whips I ride in them, bad bitches, I ride in them
Don't worry, I'll get them, gat's jammed or unjammed
God damn safest the safety don't work, squeeze the eagle, it chirps
End up faced down in the dirt more than hurt
Bring the beef where you hang out, bang out, shots ring out
Hit your shoulders trying to blow your brains out
Hit your homies in their legs, bet they have their canes out tomorrow
You know tomorrow's just a day away
If you can keep your heart beating, then your ass awake

Nigga, my gun go off - you see the barrel turning
You feel the hollows burning, nigga, now you're learning
Nigga, my gun go off - call it attempted murder
Nigga, I'm trying to murk you when I come back busting
Nigga, my gun go off - don't try to say I'm tripping
When I get to flipping and I smack the clip in
Nigga, my gun go off - we call it putting work in
Leaving niggas hurting, homicide's lurking
Nigga, my gun go off
