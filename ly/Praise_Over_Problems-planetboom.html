		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I tell my problems, how big my God is
Nothing's beyond Him, His name is Jesus
His name is Jesus
So praise will be my response
Praise will be my response
I tell my future, my God has got this
He's my provider, He'll never leave us

The enemy's under my feet
The enemy's under my feet
I praise You 'cause Lord, I believe
That Jesus set me free
Now whether I feel it or not
I'll praise You with all that I got
You are my God and my Rock
Someone turn that praise up


I tell my issues, how good my God is
He is my freedom, His name is Jesus
His name is Jesus
So praise will be my response
Praise will be my response
I'm facing giants, what they don't know is
They 'bout to find out, how big my God is

The enemy's under my feet
The enemy's under my feet
I praise You 'cause Lord, I believe
That Jesus set me free
Now whether I feel it or not
I'll praise You with all that I got
You are my God and my Rock
Someone turn that praise up

Ya, ay turn it up, turn it up
Ya, ay turn my praise up, turn it
Ya, ay turn it up, turn it
Oh ya, ay turn my praise up, turn it

We lift Jesus up, and the walls come down
We lift Jesus up, and the walls come down
Hey, hey nothing can stop my God, hey
Hey, hey nothing can stop my God, hey
We lift Jesus up, and the walls come down
We lift Jesus up, and the walls come down
Hey, hey nothing can stop my God, hey
Hey, hey nothing can stop my God, hey

The enemy's under my feet
The enemy's under my feet
I praise You 'cause Lord, I believe
That Jesus set me free
Now whether I feel it or not
I'll praise You with all that I got
You are my God and my Rock
Someone turn that praise up
The enemy's under my feet
The enemy's under my feet
I praise You 'cause Lord, I believe
That Jesus set me free
Now whether I feel it or not
I'll praise You with all that I got
You are my God and my Rock
Someone turn that praise up


Someone turn that praise up ya, ay
Turn it up, turn it up ya, ay
Turn my praise up, turn it ya, ay
Turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it
Ya, ay, turn it up
Someone turn that praise up
