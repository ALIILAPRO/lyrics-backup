		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wind yourself, wind yourself tightly to me 
Drag yourself, nostalgia we're ready to leave 
We'll ride this, we'll ride this easily 
We'll ride this, we'll ride this surely 
Paddle me closer, I promise you never look back down 

The taken time, two ends are starting to tie 
We drained it all, is friction, and skinning as hard 
We'll ride this, we'll ride this easily 
We'll ride this, we'll ride this surely 
Paddle me closer, I promise you never look back down 

We're no metaphor, we're numbness the king
We took control, remind yourself of yourself, 
Working with them, it sounds out of place 
Wind ourselves, wind ourselves, stronger again 

We'll ride this, we'll ride this easily 
We'll ride this, we'll ride this surely 
Paddle me closer, I promise you never look back down
