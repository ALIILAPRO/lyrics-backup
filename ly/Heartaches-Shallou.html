		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your love takes me higher
Than I've ever been before
And your heart's on fire
It lights me up

But your heart aches in love
And I know it, and I know it
Your heart aches in love
And I know it, and I know it

Your heart aches in love
And I know it, and I know it
Your heart aches in love
And I know it, and I know it

Your heart aches in love
And I know it, and I know it
Your heart aches in love
And I know it, and I know it

Our love's on the wire
And it feels like we could fall
Yeah, we're both just treading water
And it cools you down

But your heart aches in love
And I know it, and I know it
Your heart aches in love
And I know it, and I know it

Your heart aches in love
And I know it, and I know it
Your heart aches in love
And I know it, and I know it

Your heart aches in love
And I know it, and I know it
Your heart aches in love
And I know it, and I know it

Your heart aches in love
And I know it, and I know it
Your heart aches in love
And I know it, and I know it

I know it
I know it
Your heart aches
I know it
