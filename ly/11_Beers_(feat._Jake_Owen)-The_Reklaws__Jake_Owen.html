		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That summer rolled right in and out like a storm
Picked you up at your momma's
Then we fake ID, bought 'em
Yeah, I had seven baby, you had four
Then laid back and let me hold ya
Sang "Champagne Supernova"

Next morning you were leaving
That evening you were mine
Who woulda thought we'd have
The best damn time with

Eleven beers off an old county road
Oasis playing on my Silverado stereo
Full moon shining on your midnight hair (ooh)
Sometimes I sit on the hood and I just
Wonder where you are baby
And if I'm crazy for thinking
That you might be drinkin' thinkin' 'bout me too?
I don't know what you thought we had but I do, yeah
Eleven beers and there's still one waiting for you

What's your story, Jake?
It's still sittin' in the back of the fridge
Won't let nobody touch it
Lookin' at it gets me buzzin'
And reminiscin' on that summertime kiss
Girl, they were gone too soon
Just like you, those a

Eleven beers off an old county road (old county road)
Oasis playing on my Silverado stereo
Full moon shining on your midnight hair (ooh)
Sometimes I sit on the hood and I just
Wonder where you are baby
And if I'm crazy for thinking
That you might be drinkin' thinkin' 'bout me too?
I don't know what you thought we had but I do, yeah
Eleven beers and there's still one waiting for you
Waiting for you (ooh)

I thought it was a dozen bottles (ooh)
I picked up at the store (ooh)
But looking back we had a whole lot more than just a

Eleven beers off an old county road (ooh)
Oasis playing on my Silverado stereo
Full moon shining on your midnight hair (you're lookin' good girl)
Sometimes I sit on the hood and I just
Wonder where you are baby
And if I'm crazy for thinking
That you might be drinkin' thinkin' 'bout me too?
I don't know what you thought we had but I do, yeah (you do)
Eleven beers and there's still one waiting for you, girl

I got one waiting for you (ooh, yeah)
Yeah, there's still one waiting for you (ooh)
I wonder when you hear Oasis playin' (ooh)
Where are you now baby? (it's right here, baby)
Is there still one waiting? Ooh, ah ah (for you)
