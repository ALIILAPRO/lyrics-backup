		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Was it the glow
In your eyes for me
Honey you shook
My family tree
When you love
You lose a piece 
When i’m low
She bring the sun
She bring the sun to me

I need therapy
Want to get you off your feet
I need therapy
So tenderly
I need therapy
Want to get you off your feet
I need therapy
She bring the sun
She bring the sun to me

Could you repair
What’s left of me
I need the cure
Not a remedy
I’m digging for a quick fix
No I’m never gonna jump ship
Because you give me a boat
Stuck in a void
You’re my density

I need therapy
Want to get you off your feet
I need therapy
So tenderly
I need therapy
Want to get you off your feet
I need therapy
She bring the sun
She bring the sun to me
