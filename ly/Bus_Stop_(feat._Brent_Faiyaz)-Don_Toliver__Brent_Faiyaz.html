		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  By the bus stop
Most of the room didn't make it, the kid was like
In my different bag oh God I want my baby back
What about the girl in the drop top, top, top, top, top, top, top, top, top, top
In my different bag oh God I want my baby back (oh, oh, oh, oh)

Okay, what about the girl in the drop top
With the lollipop at the light, by the bus stop
Most of the room didn't make it, the kid was like
In my different bag oh God I want my baby back
Oh, yeah like she go low
Oh, yeah like she go low
Oh, yeah like she go low
Oh, yeah like she go low, yeah

Fuck the love, to you know it's when we met
Don't be afraid, I guess I'll be right there
I need you to do this when I say
Not what it was destined, I can be your best friend

And I guess you love to fall
Since you came back, I am not involved
She said "do you still love me?", I said "not at all"
Please don't wait, I won't be here long

Okay, what about the girl in the drop top
With the lollipop at the light, by the bus stop
Most of the room didn't make it, the kid was like
In my different bag oh God I want my baby back
Oh, yeah like she go low
Oh, yeah like she go low
Oh, yeah like she go low
Oh, yeah like she go low

I need you to, and I want you to
Fall in love with no issues
Yeah, I did you wrong, but I miss you
It's not my fault, it's some you knew

And I guess you love to fall
Since you came back, I am not involved
She said "do you still love me?", I said "not at all"
Please don't wait, I won't be here long

Okay, what about the girl in the drop top
With the lollipop at the light, by the bus stop
Most of the room didn't make it, the kid was like
In my different bag oh God I want my baby back
(Okay, what about the girl in the drop top)
(With the lollipop at the light, by the bus stop)
Most of the room didn't make it, the kid was like
In my different bag oh God I want my baby back
Oh, yeah like she go low
Oh, yeah like she go low
Oh, yeah like she go low
Oh, yeah like she go low

This is for my bitches in the drop top, it don't stop
You could bring a friend or you might not (ooh)
This is for my bitches in the drop top, it don't stop
Might fuck your friend or I might not
Fuck a winner now (oh, yeah she go low)
Bitches ain't new, I say anything cool
It ain't a thing to me, show me with your friend
She don't gotta be your enemy
This ain't my first time on the road, I got not a cold
It ain't a thing to me
It's two of y'all and one of me, let's make it three
This is for the bitches in the drop top, it don't stop
You could bring a friend or you might not (might not)
Fuck a winner now
This is for my bitches in the drop top, it don't stop
You could bring a friend or you might not (might not)
In the winter, suicide
