		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You went from my home to
It was nice to know you
And it breaks my heart
That we gave it our best shot
Now I'm in California
I'm still waiting for ya
Will you change your mind?
I would give it all up for us

Ooh
I wish I could stay with you
Ooh
I wish I could stay with you
Come before it's too late
I got things to say
Before I go
There's no time to wait
We can hide away
Need to let you know that

Ooh
I wish I could stay with you
(I wish I could stay with you)
Ooh
Know that I will wait for you
(Know that I will wait for you)

You went from my home to
It was nice to know you
And it breaks my heart
That we gave it our best shot
Now you're in California
I'm still waiting for ya
Will you change your mind?
I would give it all up for us
