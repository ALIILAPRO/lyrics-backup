		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take a minute to tell you right
And you can say what you want
Turn around every night
So now you're always going off
Doesn't matter what I done
Or if I even crossed the line
Is that the hollar going for blood
Girl, it doesn't have to be a fight

Throwing out the blame when you know it ain't my fault
Messing with my brain when you want to see me fall
There may come a time when I don't bother you at all
It isn't my call, it isn't my call

Hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
I say hey
why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
I say hey
why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
I say hey
why you keep screaming at the top of your head?

There's no need to scream, baby
I'm standing right in front of your face
Why?
I know sometimes we don't get along
So Chris sing the second verse to you
Like this

Take a minute to tell you now
and I don't have to raise my tone
Take the level and bring it down
I just want you to know
I got no trouble with what you said
I don't even think you're wrong
It's how you say it
You lose your head
Girl, I'm standing right in front of you

Throwing out the blame when you know it ain't my fault
Messing with my brain when you want to see me fall
There may come a time when I don't bother you at all
It isn't my call, it isn't my call

Hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
I say hey
why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
I say hey
why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
I say hey
why you keep screaming at the top of your head?

Silence is golden
I used to think that silence was golden
Silence is golden
I used to think that silence was golden
Silence is golden
I used to think that silence was golden
Silence is golden
I used to think that silence was golden

Hey, why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
I say hey
why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
I say hey 
why you keep screaming at the top of your head?
I say hey
why you keep screaming at the top of your head?

Silence is golden
I used to think that silence was golden
Silence is golden
I used to think that silence was golden
