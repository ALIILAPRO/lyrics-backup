Migo
Sup Zay'?
(Go)
Ha, niggas can't fuck with QC
(Go, go)

Niggas ain't built like me, these niggas ain't built like me (no way)
You niggas will never be bigger than me
These niggas ain't built like me (not at all)
(Uh) niggas ain't built like me, these niggas ain't built like me 
Bet you ain't never seen no young nigga fucked up the profit, get it back (Quavo)
They ain't built like me (gone)

These niggas ain't built like me
I can turn a whole nick' to a mother fuckin' key
Look at you nigga you ain't never been an OG
Nigga, I ain't choose the trap, nigga, trap chose me
"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee"
That's the late great words of Muhammad Ali
Gotta move real smooth, if the feds watch me
Gotta hit 'em real hard if a nigga try me (boom, boom, boom)
Can we fix it, like Bob the Builder?
Break in my trap and I kill ya (kill ya, pew)
These nigga ain't built like my nigga down the road
West side and Williams (free Willie Mack)
Like that is the moral of the story
You niggas ain't built like that with no courage
You niggas out here really hurtin'
Lockin' the block down like Richard Sherman (lock down, gone)

Niggas ain't built like me, these niggas ain't built like me (no way)
You niggas will never be bigger than me
These niggas ain't built like me (not at all)
(Uh) niggas ain't built like me, these niggas ain't built like me 
Bet you ain't never seen no young nigga fucked up the profit, get it back 
They ain't built like me (gone) (Takeoff, Takeoff)

You ain't never seen a nigga like me
Hit the club, diamonds glowin' in the back of VIP
Straight through line, nigga, don't serve me
Give the wine to the bitches, 'cause I'm pourin' up lean
Smokin' OG like it's nicotine
I got the Molly, the Percocet, and methamphetamine
We kicked the Versace went to the Giuseppe store
Grab that shit straight off the mannequin (Giuseppe me)
You fuck niggas ain't in my weight class
I'm heavy weight, you niggas get your weight up (light weight)
When it comes to this rap shit
You Sonny Liston and I'm Cassius Clay (baow-baow-baow)
Runnin' chickens on a Tonka toy
Beatin' the pot like I'm Pretty Boy Floyd
Independent just like Macklemore
Hittin' these hoes like Mcllroy

Niggas ain't built like me, these niggas ain't built like me (no way)
You niggas will never be bigger than me
These niggas ain't built like me (not at all)
(Uh) niggas ain't built like me, these niggas ain't built like me 
Bet you ain't never seen no young nigga fucked up the profit, get it back (Offset)
They ain't built like me ((gone)

Niggas ain't built like Offset (not at all)
Sippin' on Actavis like it was MoÃ«t (Actavis)
What you think you doin' with your little bitty Rolex? (What you think you doin'?)
Little bitty nigga but I'm built like Bowflex (uh)
Wanna come back hit a nigga like Jack (baow)
MCM bag that's a money book bag (money bag)
Don't get it twisted, I get on yo' ass (grraow)
Don't let the rap fool you, I been sellin' bags (don't let it fool you)
Run to the money got energy like I'm a generator
Maison Margiela, my shoes is an alligator (Maison Margiela)
When we got beef I'm the one who's the instigator
When I perform they say I look intimidatin'
I run off a ticket like I was a scientist
You rappers is fake, you an animation (fake)
And I'm a G, but I'm not a Mason (G)
I'm playin' with money like recreation (uh)

Niggas ain't built like me, these niggas ain't built like me (no way)
You niggas will never be bigger than me
These niggas ain't built like me (not at all)
(Uh) niggas ain't built like me, these niggas ain't built like me 
Bet you ain't never seen no young nigga fucked up the profit, get it back 
They ain't built like me (gone)
