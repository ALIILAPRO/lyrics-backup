		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Red, white, boom
I can't hear you
Red, white, boom

You can't come up for air when you're living on a dime
The truth is all around us if you read between the crimes
We ride the wheel of misfortune just like a carousel
We each are our own devil, and we make this world our hell

Cold and isolated
Sold out, violated
Over stimulated
So run for your life, or detonate it

Red, white, boom
I can't hear you
Red, white, boom
The land of the free, the sick, and depraved

They say you can't forget the past if you won't give up it's ghost
The difference between medicine and poison is the dose
Our carpel tunnel vision is our social suicide
So smile for the camera, aim it right between your eyes

Cold and isolated
Sold out, violated
Over complicated
So run for your life, or detonate it

Please keep your hopes and dreams
Inside the vehicle at all times
Free will is no longer permitted on this ride
One, two, fuck you

Yeah

It's hard to take a breath when dying to survive
The truth is all around, just read between the crimes
Our coffin's rent to own, we're swinging from a rope
The symptoms of control, if undiagnosed, are doomed to explode

Cold and isolated
Force fed, violated
Divided states of hope and hatred
So run for your life or detonate it
Go fuck the algorithm
I won't bow down to a broken system
Where madness is celebrated
So pull the pin and detonate it

Red, white, boom
I can't hear you
Red, white, boom
The land of the free, the sick, and depraved
