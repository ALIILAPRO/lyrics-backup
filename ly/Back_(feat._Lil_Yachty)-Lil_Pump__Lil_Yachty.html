Bang, bang, bang, like ya knockin' on the front door
Bitch brown skin like a muhfuckin' fronto
Used to post at the Citgo, uh
Now I got chips in the Citgo, uh
Now I got a wrist like a igloo, huh
And it glow like a disco ball
Bih, bend it over like your shoe's untied
Side bitch still got a iPhone 5
Main bitch still got a iPhone 7
Still caught a Uzi pistol or a MAC-11
Still fuck a nigga main bitch while I got my own bitch
And I better still make it up to Heaven, uh
I'ma have a kid just to dress him up in Gucci
To the seven, Goddamn, I'm a reverend
