		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Outtatown, we never outta money)
(star boy, you're my hero)

Thought you was my lover, but you just a slut
Thought you was my lover, but it was just lust
I thought you was my lover, I thought you was no other then
I thought we was forever, I thought we would never end
I thought you was 4L, I thought you was my best friend, yeah
I thought you'd never tell, but you switched up on me at the end, yeah
But shit, oh well, still countin' up all these Benjamins, yeah
These niggas, they be fake as hell
I swear that these niggas, they be pretend, yeah

We don't do fake friends, no
I'ma pop this Adderall
Swiped her off my catalog
I get fly, I'm rock, no roll
Hell nah, nigga, this not G-Star
I get high, I go to Mars
Xanax pill, yeah, I got bars
Foreign, foreign, yeah, my car
I'm going too fast, I'll see you tomorrow
He broke as hell, he need to borrow
I took his bitch and we went far
I rock this shit, got no guitar
I rock this shit like Green Day

Give a fuck about what he or she say
But if I love you, I'm gon' let it spray
If I love you, I do strange things 
for you I'll rob a bank for you
I'll lose everything for you
I'd damn near go insane for you
And if the police came for you
I'd take the blame for you
I woulda did anything for you
But you wouldn't do the same for me (nah)

Thought you was my lover, but you just a slut
Thought you was my lover, but it was just lust

I thought you was my lover, I thought you was no other then
I thought we was forever, I thought we would never end
I thought you was 4L, I thought you was my best friend, yeah
I thought you'd never tell, but you switched up on me at the end, yeah
But shit, oh well, still countin' up all these Benjamins, yeah
These niggas, they be fake as hell
I swear that these niggas, they be pretend, yeah
