		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you please explain
The reasons why you were so
Afraid of consequence
When we first said hello

Can you please explain
The reasons why you were so
Afraid of consequence
When we first said hello

Where am I going?
What concerned you was being true
In the nearest bathtub with hot water
Soaking me into you
The withstand time of mine
The will to never under mind
You're growing and
I feel strong all ways

Can you please explain
The reasons why you were so
Afraid of consequence
When we first said hello

Can you please explain
The reasons why you were so
Afraid of consequence
When we first said hello

Pigeons circle my roof
Ten to a hundred times a day
Nothing stops them from feeding
On our grass that lay astray
Bothersome it may be 
To the naked eye nothing is free
But the burden of proof may take
More than a lifetime to see

Where am I going?
What concerned you was being true
In the nearest bathtub with hot water
Soaking me into you

Can you please explain
The reasons why you were so
Afraid of consequence
When we first said hello
When we first said hello
When we first said hello
When we first said hello
When we first said hello

Can you please explain
The reasons why you were so
Afraid of consequence
When we first said hello

Can you please explain
The reasons why you were so
Afraid of consequence
When we first said hello

Can you please explain
The reasons why you were so
Afraid of consequence
When we first said hello

Can you please explain
Why you were so afraid
Can you please explain
Why you were so afraid
Can you please explain
Why you were so afraid
Can you please explain
Why you were so afraid

Can you please explain
Why you were so afraid
Can you please explain
Why you were so afraid
Can you please explain
Why you were so afraid
Can you please explain
Why you were so afraid

Why you were so afraid
