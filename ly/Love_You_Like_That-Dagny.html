		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You hate that I usually don't open up
I know when I say it, it doesn't say enough
With you close, I'm the happiest I ever was

I tend to avoid getting emotional
I'm not shutting you out
It's just the way I'm born
But I see myself next to you until we're old

You know how they say you got the real thing
When nothing else matters
I love you like that
I love you like that
I love you like that
I love you, I love you
I love you like that

All I wanna say is I got the real thing
And nothing else matters
I love you like that
I love you like that
I love you like that
I love you, I love you
I love you like that

I'm not always clever with the words I use
You want something deeper
Yeah I know you do
But right when I hold you, don't you know the truth

One look in my eyes
And you should know the truth
You should know the truth
Yeah, you

You know how they say you got the real thing
When nothing else matters
I love you like that
I love you like that
I love you like that
I love you, I love you
I love you like that

All I wanna say is I got the real thing
And nothing else matters
I love you like that
I love you like that
I love you like that
I love you, I love you
I love you like that

You know when they say you got the real thing
And nothing else matters
I love you like that
I love you like that
I love you like that
I love you like that

You know how they say you got the real thing
When nothing else matters
I love you like that
I love you like that
I love you like that
I love you, I love you
I love you like that

All I wanna say is I got the real thing
And nothing else matters
I love you like that
I love you like that
I love you like that
I love you, I love you
I love you like that

(Yeah you)
I love you, I love you
I love you like that
(Yeah you)
I love you, I love you
I love you like that (I love you like that) (yeah you)
I love you, I love you
I love you like that

All I wanna say is I got the real thing
And nothing else matters
I love you like that
