		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Overwhelming ecstasy
Our bodies move in harmony
Always waking breathlessly
From dreams that leave me wanting more of you
These silly games we play
Stupid ways to make you stay
My heart's split open on display
I can't wait another day
To touch your face, to hold you
I just need you by my side tonight

Overwhelming ecstasy
Your name repeated endlessly
Ice cream by the movie screens
We'll make out in the backseat of your car
Ripped shirts and perfect throws
Til my body overflows
In the summer afterglow
I love you more than you will ever know
But it's alright
Just keep it all inside tonight

We can leave right now, never come back home
You're all I need
Forget everything that we used to be
Take me to another place, fly me up to Jupiter
We can run away
But I'll always feel at home with you

Overwhelming ecstasy
Your skin is like a melody
Your heartbeat brings me to my knees
Just begging for a chance to simply
Taste the moonlight on your lips
The fever sings, the honey drips
Curtains closed, the record skips
No one has ever loved like this
I'm certain, it must be holy
To feel something so pure

Overwhelming ecstasy
Twisted in your entropy
Clinging to you desperately
And I can taste the sweetness of your breath
The stars are screaming loud
The world outside is breaking down
Burning cities, whispered vows
And I can feel you all around me
Nothing feels the same
Nothing feels quite like you

We can leave right now, never come back home
You're all I need
Forget everything that we used to be
Take me to another place, fly me up to Jupiter
We can run away
But I'll always feel at home with you

And if you run, I'm right behind you,
We'll make it out
Nothing left between us but light and sound
Take me into outer space, fly me up to Jupiter
I am yours forever
And I'll always be at home with you
