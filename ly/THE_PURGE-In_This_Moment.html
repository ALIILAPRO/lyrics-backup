		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pushing like pudding
Like butter, like gold
You wanna get the cash, you wanna get the fool
You wanna find the fake, you wanna be seen
You wanna blame an addict but you're already a fiend

Fuck it, the whole world is gonna see 
High off fumes, addicted to the feed
What's it all for? Like you don't really know
Another on the hook and another Jane Doe
When you're pushing back and forth then forth and back again
They say that you were free, now you're locked in a cage
You're pushing lies like your life is on the line
You want a reason why
Now you're begging for a sign

Maybe, maybe we're all fucked (fucked)
Maybe we'll all burn (burn)
Maybe we're all just purging
Yeah (yeah), maybe we'll all die (die)
Maybe you were right (right)
Maybe we're all just parasites
(Purge)

You cutting like glass, like needles, like knives
You wanna get the girl, you wanna win the fight
You wanna be a God, you wanna be a star
You wanna be another and this time you went to far

Fuck it, the whole world's gone mad
High off smoke, addicted to the fad
Why am I here? Like, I don't really know 
Another in the bag and another Jane Doe
Now you're pushing back and forth, then forth and back again
They said that you were free, now you're locked in a cage
You're pushing lies like your life is on the line
You want a reason why
Now you're begging for a sign

Maybe, maybe we're all fucked (fucked)
Maybe we'll all burn (burn)
Maybe we're all just purging 
Yeah (yeah), maybe we'll all die (die)
Maybe you were right (right)
Maybe we're all just parasites

(I can feel the purge)
(I can feel the purge coming on)

Maybe, maybe we're all fucked (fucked)
Maybe we'll all burn (burn)
Maybe we're all just purging 
Yeah (yeah), maybe we'll all die (die)
Maybe you were right (right)
Maybe we're all just parasites
(Purge)
