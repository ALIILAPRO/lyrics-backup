		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I told her bounce it back
I told her ounces back
I told her bounce it back
You been sellin' drugs for years
Ain't got a bird, nigga
You been sellin' weed, nigga
You ain't a plug, nigga

You know I'm different from them
I'm from a different cloth
I got a nina ross
9th grade, gettin' paid
Sunshine, no shade
All day, errday
Southwest Atlanta, A
Okay
Let me start, nigga
Apartment baby, I can't deny
Transparent, see through it, I like it then I buy
Seen through you niggas like Ziplocs
Gucci be all on my flip flops
Had me more white than a avalanche
I put that gas in a turkey bag

I told her ounces back
I told her bounce it back
I told her ounces back
I told her bounce it back
You been sellin' drugs for years
Ain't got a bird, nigga
You been sellin' weed, nigga
You ain't a plug, nigga

I'm back to my condo on Jupiter
You must have forgot I had it
You already know what I'm mad at
I'm wearin' Hermes as a habit
And I got that hat and the rabbit
So now that we got it established
Who want a gunfight?
Slung it from left right
Back on my bullshit, it ain't nothin' nice
Ain't sacrifice, went Saks twice
That's how I feel, young nigga, yoooooung
Okay, I'm back, where they at?
Yo, Skooly, my nigga
What we gon' do on these niggas?
Rockin' Medusa on niggas
Quality tru
My cousin coolin', meant to say, my bousin boolin'
Goat had them units, Goat had that cookie
I had a plug on it, I brought the kush in
See I wanna rub on it, I miss that pussy
And I'll beat that pussy, friendly reminder
Don't let me find you, I creep up behind you
I give you the Heimlich, you think it's a Heimlich
Then I'ma G5 it, just switched the climate
And this is Bvlgari, and no I'm not sorry
I'mma get married at Benihana's, have the reception at Follie's

I told her ounces back
I told her bounce it back
I told her ounces back
I told her bounce it back
You been sellin' drugs for years
Ain't got a bird, nigga
You been sellin' weed, nigga
You ain't a plug, nigga

I told her bounce it back
I told her ounces back
I told her bounce it back
You been sellin' drugs for years
Ain't got a bird, nigga
You been sellin' weed, nigga
You ain't a plug, nigga
