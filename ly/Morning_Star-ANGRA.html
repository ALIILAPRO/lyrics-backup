		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dawning time
Lights a new beginning
On the shadows of your eyes
Hurts inside
Wounded heart is healing
After all you will survive

All the time I was lost in the desert
Counting what was left from the
Illusions in my mind
Hopeless fights
Foolish thoughts we were in heaven
till we die, oh!
Death will bring us back
where we belong
Now you must decide before the
Dawn is brightening up the day
Announcing in the sky
the Morning Star

Nothing left to loose
I am going on my way tonight
(On my way and...)
Shouting to the moon
I'll be roaming till I find the Morning
Star - Oh!!!
Another chance you waste
I'm the owner of my days
I'll be howling through the night till
the end of time.

Look out!

All this time I was lost in the desert
Got to get away!
Now I must decide before the
Dawn is brightening up the day
Announcing in the sky
the Morning Star!

Nothing left to loose
I am going on my way tonight
(On my way and...)
Silent like the moon
I will wonder till I find the Morning
Star - Oh no!!!
Another chance you waste
Cause I'm going on my way tonight
(On my way and...)
Shouting to the stars
I'm the owner of my days
I'll be howling through the night till
the end of time. Oh!
End of time!
Shouting to the stars!
