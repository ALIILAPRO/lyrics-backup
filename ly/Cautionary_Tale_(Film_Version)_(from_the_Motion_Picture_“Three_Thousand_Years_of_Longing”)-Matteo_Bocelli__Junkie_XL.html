		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it wrong for me to say
That love is a cautionary tale?
"Let's try," is your reply
"Though love can always fail"

Do we want too much?
Do we give too much?
Do we have a choice at all?
Even when you're gone
You're my everywhere
You're in every singer's song

Blinded by smoke and lies
Love and loss, dangerous game
So beautifully played
Beautifully played

Do we want too much?
Do we give too much?
Do we have a choice at all?
Even when you're gone
You're my everywhere
You're in every singer's song

Do we want too much?
Do we give too much?
Do we have a choice at all?
Will we come unstuck?
Is it love, or just
One more leap before the fall?
