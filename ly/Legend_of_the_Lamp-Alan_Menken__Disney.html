		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah, salaam and good evening to you, worthy friend
Please, please, come closer
Ah, too close, a little too close
There, welcome to Agrabah, city of mystery, of enchantment
And the finest merchandise this side of the River Jordan, on sale today
Come on down
Look at this, yes, combination hookah and coffeemaker, also makes Julienne fries
It will not break, it will not, it broke.
Oh, look at this, I have never seen one of these intact before
This is the famous dead sea Tupperware
Listen, ah, still good
Wait, don't go
I can see that you're only interested in the exceptionally rare
I think, then, you would be most rewarded to consider this
Do not be fooled by its commonplace appearance
Like so many things, it is not what is outside, but what is inside that counts
This is no ordinary lamp
It once changed the course of a young man's life
A young man who like this lamp was more than what he seemed, a diamond in the rough
