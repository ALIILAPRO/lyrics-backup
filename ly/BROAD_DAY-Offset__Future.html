		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mask on, thirty piece
(Yo Nick Papz, make it slap, brrt)

Mask on, thirty piece (mask)
Got it out the mud, we was servin' P's (servin' P's)
If you from the streets, you probably heard of me (heard of me)
Fuck that, nigga, certainly (hey)
Catch a body, broad day, shoot him in the hallway
Coroner one call away, dump his body in the lake
Fuck her on my off day, I've been ballin' all state
Me and brodie made a play, like the NCAA

Fuck nigga, I'm havin', I'm clearin' two hundred thous' a day (hey)
Ducked off, I'm makin' my millions, you niggas in the way
I tell the bitch to go and shop with it, here go bout' 20K (here)
I know she kinda bi' wit' it, but scared to say she gay (oh yeah, oh yeah)
Hope God forgive my sins, I been really tryna win, yeah (oh yeah, oh yeah)
I keep a cool killer look, my bitch be mad 'cause I don't grin, yeah (smile)
Police pull me over, tryna profile (police)
They can't catch me, I'ma kick the door right at the dope house (dope)
Soon as we land, five hours, now we ain't got no problems (gone)
It was rainin', money showers, better not bring your ho out (ho)
Money bring a lot of power, 'til the money go down
I was knockin' at the door and then I kicked the door down (kick door)
Hundred thousand ten times, million dollar program (M)
I don't fuck with niggas, pickin' sides, nigga dickridin' (hey)

Mask on, thirty piece (mask)
Got it out the mud, we was servin' P's (servin' P's)
If you from the streets, you probably heard of me (heard of me)
Fuck that, nigga, certainly (hey)
Catch a body, broad day, shoot him in the hallway
Coroner one call away, dump his body in the lake
Fuck her on my off day, I've been ballin' all state
Me and brodie made a play, like the NCAA

Thirty piece on me, I got my new Chanel mask on
Rap didn't work, I'd be hood rich, gettin' my roll on
Soon as the right price on your head, you get shit on (yeah)
Free my niggas straight from out the fed, one got told on
Wrap niggas up, kidnap 'em, and murder 'em, in broad day
For a little cash, you can get a nigga violated (straight up)
All red Atlanta Hawk, chinchilla, okay (alright)
Feet kicked up like a big killer, okay (phew, phew, phew)
I got the whole world poppin' G6 (phew, phew, phew)
Chopper go grah, off a reflex (phew, phew, phew)
I'm with all the savages and heathens (phew, phew, phew)
Bitch hide that dope in her cleavage (woah, woah, woah)
Murder squad gon' murder shit, that's all I know (murder)
All I got is shooters, no friends like VLONE (super)
Put an NCAA gym in my home (super)
75 North, nigga, my money that long
Nigga, I'm rollin' like a stone (Pluto)

Mask on, thirty piece (mask)
Got it out the mud, we was servin' P's (servin' P's)
If you from the streets, you probably heard of me (heard of me)
Fuck that, nigga, certainly 
Catch a body, broad day, shoot him in the hallway
Coroner one call away, dump his body in the lake
Fuck her on my off day, I've been ballin' all state
Me and brodie made a play, like the NCAA
