		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some walk by night
Some fly by day
Nothing could change you
Set and sure of the way

There is the sun and moon
They sing their own sweet tune
Watch them when dawn is due
Sharing one space

We'll walk by night
We'll fly by day
Moonlighting strangers 
Who just met on the way
