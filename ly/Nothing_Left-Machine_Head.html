		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Withered away I see it 
Every day complacent 
Desecrates the fabric of lies 
Emptiness fills inside me 

Bitterness has denied me 
Faith like this well 
Could I really give a shit 

When I feel it 
Come falling 
I turn you away 

I am the things that you fear 
My leap of faith without a sound 
Don't push my back against the wall 
Yes I have strength will never fall  will never 

Withered inside 
This soul has petrified 
As concrete fills the skies 
This life is disarray 

Consequence every action 
Brings violence from the passions 
Loneliness the emotion withering inside 

When I feel it 
Come falling 
I turn you away 

I am the things that you fear 
My leap of faith without a sound 
Don't push my back against the wall 
Yes I have strength will never fall 

I feel around the fall is on 
For so long I've been away..away 
For years to now been holdin' on 
For so long I've been away.. away 

I have nothing left for nobody else 
I have nothing left for nobody 

Feel it 
Come falling 
I turn you away 

I am the things that you fear 
My leap of faith without a sound 
Don't push my back against the wall 
Yes I have strength will never fall
