		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Made my steps towards the water
Where Undine last was seen
I was told that if you saw her
It should make you more naive
Made my steps towards the shore
She sang her love at me
Oh Undine so sweet and pure
Make me more naive
Oh Undine, sing your love to me
Oh Undine, knowing I'd love this lovely scene (?)

There were ropes around my wrist
And the tide pulled at her hair
Pulling her away from me
And me away from there
Yes the water tried to take her
Tried to make poor Undine hide
But she fought herself against it
Love in her had not yet died
Oh Undine, sing your love to me
Oh Undine, fight your way, fight your way

You live for the sea
Undine, you live for the sea
You cannot, you cannot

What's going on in there?
What's going on in there?
Let me in

It's cold there in December
So I took my coat and left
Left Undine by the embers
That's all our fire had left
Left Undine by the shore
Where she sang her love at me
Oh Undine so sweet and pure
Knowing I'd love this lovely scene (?)

You live for the sea
Undine, you live for the sea
You cannot, you cannot

What's going on in there?
What's going on in there?
Let me in

You live for the sea
Undine, you live for the sea
You cannot, you cannot
You cannot love me
