		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (One, two, three, four)

I've walked among the shadows
You wiped my tears away
And I've felt the pain of heartbreak
And I've seen the brighter days
And I've prayed prayers to heaven from my lowest place
And I have held the blessings
God, You give and take away

No matter what I have, Your grace is enough
No matter where I am, I'm standing in Your love

On the mountains, I will bow my life
To the One who set me there
In the valley, I will lift my eyes to the One who sees me there
When I'm standing on the mountain, I didn't get there on my own
When I'm walking through the valley I know I am not alone
You're God of the hills and valleys
Hills and valleys
God of the hills and valleys
And I am not alone

I've watched my dreams get broken
In You, I hope again
No matter what, I know I'm safe inside Your hand

On the mountains, I will bow my life
To the One who set me there
In the valley, I will lift my eyes to the One who sees me there
When I'm standing on the mountain, I didn't get there on my own
When I'm walking through the valley I know I am not alone
You're God of the hills and valleys
Hills and valleys
God of the hills and valleys
And I am not alone

Father, You give and take away
Every joy and every pain
Through it all, You will remain
Over it all

Father, You give and take away
Every joy and every pain
Through it all, You will remain
Over it all

On the mountains, I will bow my life, yeah
In the valley, I will lift my eyes, yeah
On the mountains, I will bow my life
To the One who set me there (to the One who set me there)
In the valley, I will lift my eyes to the One who sees me there
When I'm standing on the mountain, I didn't get there on my own
When I'm walking through the valley I know I am not alone (I'm not alone)
You're God of the hills and valleys
Hills and valleys
God of the hills and valleys (You're the God of the hills)
And I am not alone

You're God of the hills and valleys
Hills and valleys
God of the hills and valleys (You're the God of the hills)
And I am not alone (the God of the valleys)

And I will choose to say, "Blessed be Your Name, yeah, yeah"
And I am not alone
