		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come up here?
Metro on the beat, Metro on the beat
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

You know I change with the seasons (yeah I change, change)
The same way I'm coming bitch I'm leaving (yeah I'm out)
And when I'm gone you won't see me (gone)
Unless you give me a reason

V12, I got a need for speed
Only time I'm slowing down is in between her knees
Might tell her ass to leave when I need to breathe
Lil Metro on the beat, push the keys with ease
I flew out every airport, of course God is my source
When you do the numbers it gets taxing of course
Somehow I just kept it twenty-five times four
Kill the shows, kill the pussy, they both want an encore
Like go Don, go
Gave everybody 'round me jobs
Fuck a job corps, bitch we on the top floor
Working like we still tryna get it off the ground though
And if you not contributing bitch then fuck you 'round for?
And if I split these blessings with you you my brother
If I don't text you back then I don't trust you
If I pick up on the first brrt I love you
And if I tell you all my secrets you my lover, yeah yeah

You know I change with the seasons (yeah I change, change)
The same way I'm coming bitch I'm leaving (yeah I'm out)
And when I'm gone you won't see me (gone)
Unless you give me a reason
You know I move with the seasons
The same way I'm coming bitch I'm leaving (yeah I'm leavin')
And when I'm gone you won't see me (you won't see me)
Unless you give me a reason

Yo them girls don't need me
I learned them girls don't need me
Girls don't need me
So why do they always hate to leave me?
Remove my pants, I won't be needing these
Pretty girl gon' tell me pretty please
I change like the season
My old girls, I really don't see them

I think these boys don't like me, want to fight me
But they don't talk to my face like they do on IG
I guess it bring the best out of me when they doubt me (for sure)
Fucked up how my mind be, maybe the mayhem calm me
Bring competition 'round me, eat 'em alive like zombies
I think I got insomnia, up all night to the morning
Turn my phone off 'cause I got a higher calling
And for the gold medal I keep my foot on the pedal
Keep my girls on rose petals, keep runnin' into the devil
Beat his ass every time, next time I'ma bring a shovel
To put his ass in the dirt and then laugh 'til it hurt
And I'm in rare form like Jordan airborne
I'm here there and gone, lowkey it's baritone
She love my pheromones, I'm 'bout to take this trip
And I can hold your hand instead of this carry-on, gone

You know I change with the seasons (yeah I change, change)
The same way I'm coming bitch I'm leaving (I'm out, yeah I'm out)
And when I'm gone you won't see me (bye, gone)
Unless you give me a reason
You know I move with the seasons
The same way I'm coming bitch I'm leaving (I'm out)
And when I'm gone you won't see me (you won't see me)
Unless you give me a reason
