		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Monitor outside
For the people inside
A prevention of crime
A passing of time 

The come and they go
It's a passing of time
They come and they go
Whilst we sit in our homes 

Sit back and enjoy
The real McCoy
Our new air of authority
Our sentinel of misery 

His face was full of intent
And we shook excitement
Then the victim stared up
Looked strangely at the screen
As if her pain was our fault
But that's entertainment
What we crave for inside
No more second rate movies
From those people outside
