		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can see you baby from a thousand miles away,
And I know you love me, no matter what you say.
I can tell you baby, where you belong,
By my side at the end of the day, when the work is
Done.

I can tell when you been sleepin' all day in bed,
And I know what drives you, out of your head.
I can feel your heart beatin' through a cememt wall,
An' I know you'll come runnin', when ever I call.

Can't fool me (no, no, no)
Can't fool a man who's been around,
You can't leave me (no, no, no)
Without me knowin' where you're goin'
Can't get away

Oh, I can touch, every breath you take,
And I know with me you can't make no mistake.
Just like butter on a hot summer's day,
I can melt you baby an' leave you that way.

If your heart was a diamond and your love was gold,
You'd be a ring on my finger, you don't need to be
Told,
That it ain't no use tryin' to cheat on me,
'Cause everybody knows, where you got-ta' be.

Can't fool me (no, no, no)
Can't fool a man who's been around,
You can't leave me (no, no, no)
Without me knowin' where you're goin'
Can't get away
