		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember when your head caught flame
It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain
Well you laughed, baby it's okay
It's buzz cut season anyway
(Well you laughed, baby it's okay)

Explosions on TV, and all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool, where everything is good

We ride the bus with the knees pulled in
People should see how we're living
(We ride the bus with the knees pulled in)
Shut my eyes to the song that plays
Sometimes this has a hot, sweet taste
(Shut my eyes to the song that plays)

The men up on the news, they try to tell us all that we will lose
But it's so easy in this blue, where everything is good

And I'll never go home again (place the call, feel it start)
Favorite friend (and nothing's wrong when nothing's true)
I live in a hologram with you
Where all the things that we do for fun (and I'll breathe, and it goes)
Play along (make-believe it's hyper real)
But I live in a hologram with you

Cola with the burnt-out taste
I'm the one you tell your fears to
There'll never be enough of us

Explosions on TV, and all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool, where everything is good

And I'll never go home again (place the call, feel it start)
Favorite friend (and nothing's wrong when nothing's true)
I live in a hologram with you
Where all the things that we do for fun (and I'll breathe, and it goes)
Play along (make-believe it's hyper real)
But I live in a hologram with you
