		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was the one
I who could pull in all the stars above
Lay them on your feet and I gave you my love

You are the one who got me started
You could have let me love anyone but I only wanted you
So why did he make me cry
Why didn't you come get me one last time

You'll always know
The reason why
We could've had the moon and the sky
You'll always know
The reason why this love, reason why this love
Ain't gon' let you go

You let me down
Left me for alliance
A long, long time ago

You left me there dying
But you'll never let me go

You'll always know
The reason why
We could have had the moon and the sky
You'll always know
The reason why this love, reason why this love
Ain't gon' let you go

You'll always know the reason why
The song you heard will stay on your mind
It ain't gon' let you go, no
'Cause you have removed the light in the sky

You'll always know
The reason why
We could have had the moon and the sky
You'll always know
The reason why this love, reason why this love
Ain't gon' let you go

Ain't goin' let you go
You had the keys to car (you'll always know)
You had every star (the reason why)
Everyone of them twinkling (we could have had)
Baby, what were you thinkin'? (the moon and the sky)
You'll always know

We had the moon and the sky above
And I gave you my love
