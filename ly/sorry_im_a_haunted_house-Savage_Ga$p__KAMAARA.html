		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cause I'm a grave man
Skeleton man
Not no bape man
Fake man's
Ditto face man's
Man I hate them
Closet full of skeletons
And some fake friends
Halloween decorations
Tell 'em hang 10
Rinnegan see thru fake friends
Damn, that's pain man
Ye man, in 08 man 808 blam
OVO
Keep a drake jammed, In my waist band
Haunted house, how I pop out with the gang man

In the field like a scarecrow
With my kinfolk
Red dot like a pimple
At your temple
You can feel me when the wind blows
And the moon glows
Tia and Tamera twin glocks shoot akimbo
Mobile suit gaspare
Gundam boots smashing
One to ur neck
One to floor gassin
Skelton jack, in the back, on attack
Better titan up boy I'm on y'all assess

Cause I'm a grave man
Skeleton man
Not no bape man
Fake man's
Ditto face man's
Man I hate them
Closet full of skeletons
And some fake friends
Halloween decorations
Tell 'em hang 10
Rinnegan see thru fake friends
Damn, that's pain man
Ye man, in 08 man 808 blam
OVO
Keep a drake jammed, In my waist band
Haunted house, how I pop out with the gang man

Looking at the end (Yuh)
I can feel death blowing kisses in the wind (Yuh)
I can only see her when im looking through the lends
Fatal frame baby this shit ain't a game
If you saw it how i see it you would prolly go insane
Don't know what it was or what i saw but i can hear it lurking screeching outside in the Yall
Baby better hold tight you're in for a long night
Gaspare and kamaara digging graves out in the moonlight

Cause I'm a grave man
Skeleton man
Not no bape man
Fake man's
Ditto face man's
Man I hate them
Closet full of skeletons
And some fake friends
Halloween decorations
Tell 'em hang 10
Rinnegan see thru fake friends
Damn, that's pain man
Ye man, in 08 man 808 blam
OVO
Keep a drake jammed, In my waist band
Haunted house, how I pop out with the gang man
