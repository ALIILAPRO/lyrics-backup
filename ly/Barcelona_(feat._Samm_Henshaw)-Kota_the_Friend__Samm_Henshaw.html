		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They just chat I live it, yeah
Boy don't cap, y'all fill it, yeah
My whip got no ceiling, yeah
Bitch, I ball like Krillin, yeah
I can't stress no bitch, yeah
Life too short though, innit? Yeah
Watch how quick they flip, yeah
Do me, fuck yo feelings

Philippines with my wife that's where I'm at
Limousine for the night that's where I'm at
In a dream, but real life, that's where I'm at
Wrapped up in the moment, I'll call you back

Cabin out in Arizona
Bungalow in California
Baby, we do what we wanna
Summerhouse in Barcelona

Cartier new edition
Gourmet chef in my kitchen
Flights that don't cost a distance
Thought you was in on my business
You blink twice, oops you missed it, uh
Only live life where the light hits best
We only find rest where we find success
Ah, high tea folks with accents
If this is life then say less
We'll be living high in paradise
Champagne skies, anything you like
Le commode, the French chateau
Where we'll go
Only heaven knows, yeah (ah, yeah)

Cabin out in Arizona
Bungalow in California
Baby, we do what we wanna
Summerhouse in Barcelona

2K23 is so different
Vision just as clear as my mission
Grateful for the way that I'm livin'
I'm the only cook in my kitchen
Living out my bucket list
Had some fun on the road to riches
Fell head first but I'm up again
Every step got good intentions

Gimme that daylight, yeah, ayy
Gimme that moonlight, yeah, ayy
Gimme that breeze, gimme them trees
Gimme some room right here, yeah
Gimme that view
Beach and a pool
Gimme that too
I don't want lies
Gimme that truth
I just wanna vibe
She just wanna move, yeah

Cabin out in Arizona
Bungalow in California
Baby, we do what we wanna
Summerhouse in Barcelona

Tell 'em see ya, yeah yeah
Argentina, yeah yeah
Hit Ibiza, yeah yeah
Nice to meet ya, yeah yeah
Mount Fuji, yeah yeah
It's a movie, yeah yeah
In the mountains (yeah)
Ain't no shouting (yeah)
Coolin' out in (yeah)
My jacuzzi (yeah)
