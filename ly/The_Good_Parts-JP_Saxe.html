		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The way you turned to me in bed
And the way you said, 'Can I have my spot?'
Put your head against my chest
Asked me to rub your neck
Put on British Bake Show
Or some other stupid show we'd watch
My hand on your knee, in the passenger seat
On the 101 driving just aimlessly
The way you turned to me and said
'Going anywhere with you is okay with me'

So much of us was perfect
And it's always what I think about first
How nice it could've been if we only lived where our love works

Fossilize, my heart
Tryna hold on to the good parts
Memorize, you in my arms
Tryna hold on to the good parts
Can we separate the way it ended from the person
Refuse to take to heart the things we said when we were hurtin'
I still think we mostly are, the good parts

The way you'd make up silly names for me
I hated but you'd call me all the time
The way you fell asleep beside me in a hospital recliner
On the evening my appendix chose to die
In any kind of crisis it's impossible I wouldn't run to you
We almost prophesied it on the day we met like we already knew

Fossilize, my heart
Tryna hold on to the good parts
Memorize, you in my arms
Tryna hold on to the good parts
Can we separate the way it ended from the person
Refuse to take to heart the things we said when we were hurtin'
I still think we mostly are, the good parts

So much of us was perfect
And it's always what I think about first
How nice it could've been if we only lived where our love works

Fossilize, my heart
Tryna hold on to the good parts
Memorize, you in my arms
Tryna hold on to the good parts
Can we separate the way it ended from the person
Refuse to take to heart the things we said when we were hurtin'
I still think we mostly are, the good parts
