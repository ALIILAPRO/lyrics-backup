		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did you really understand?
Falling down to begin again
Did you see it's all real?
For the part of us to let go

Did you give way?
For the time to renew
Did you see it's all real?
Did you follow?

Understand falling down to begin
Did you see it's all real?
For the part of us to let go

Did you give way?
For the time to renew
Did you see it's all real?
Did you give?
