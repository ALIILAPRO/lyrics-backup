		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We paid our dues
No lust for fame
When tides get turned
They know your name
When all of you were fast asleep
We made ourselves the ones to beat

Ah, we were down on our knees
We were so close to defeat
Heard a chant, grab your hand
One thing I'll never understand
It was magic, magic (oh)

Skies are blue; fields are green
And the crowd was deafening
Out of breath, all within
But still we found a way to win
It was magic, magic (oh)

We run for love
We run through hurt
But gods conspire
Our fall to earth
But not before we light the flame
And feed our hunger for the game

Ah, we were down on our knees
We were so close to defeat
Heard a chant, grab your hand
One thing I'll never understand
It was magic, magic (oh)

Skies are blue; fields are green
And the crowd was deafening
Out of breath, all within
But still we found a way to win
It was magic, magic (oh)

Oh, our blood will run together
And we won't know surrender (oh)

Ah, we were down on our knees
We were so close to defeat
Heard a chant, grab your hand
One thing I'll never understand
It was magic, magic (oh)

Skies are blue; fields are green
And the crowd was deafening
Out of breath, all within
But still we found a way to win
It was magic, magic (oh)
