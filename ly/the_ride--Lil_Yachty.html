		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh
Don't ask no questions on the ride
Makin' eye contact is suicide, yeah
When I'm alone with my thoughts, I'm terrified
That's why I need you here, just by my side, yeah
A quick zoom to the moon, come on and ride, yeah

Baby, if you scared of heights, just close your eyes
It get lonely at the top, baby, come inside
Baby, bust it open for me, don't be shy

Ooh
Don't ask no questions on the ride
Makin' eye contact is suicide, yeah
When I'm alone with my thoughts, I'm terrified
That's why I need you here, just by my side, yeah
A quick zoom to the moon, come on and ride, yeah

Fill my void (fill my void), fill my void (fill my void)
Fill my
Fill my void (fill my void), fill my void (fill my void)
Fill my

I feel empty, riding on E
A shopping spree may fill the V, V as in void
Speakin' of void, I may avoid all of my boys
That doesn't work, is unemployed, now I'm annoyed
All of the things I want from joy doesn't bring joy
It just bring noise, it just bring noise
It just bring noise, it just bring noise
It just bring noise, it just bring noise
It just bring noise, it just bring noise (nice)

Ooh, yeah
Don't ask no questions on the ride
Makin' eye contact is suicide (suicide)
When I'm alone with my thoughts, I'm terrified
That's why I need you here, just by my side, yeah
A quick zoom to the moon, come on and ride, yeah
A quick zoom to the moon

Come on and ride, yeah
