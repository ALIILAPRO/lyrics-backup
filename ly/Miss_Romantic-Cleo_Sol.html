		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Running into him every other week
Getting closer every time you both speak
Say, "There's a mutual connection"
Hopin' that he just don't wanna creep
Thinking about him on the daily
Waiting for the day that he will leave her
Your friends tell you, "Be careful"
But what is life when you're just careful?

Looking at him like he's a God figure
Maybe you just need a father figure
Now it's all gone left, he said, she said
You knew there were issues before you got there
But he's older, you just don't understand
He should be responsible for an older man

And now you're feeling it firsthand
At one point you wanted him to be your man, your man
Your man, your man

Pick yourself up, girl, it's not deep
Worth more than this, you just can't see
You just need love and affection
He's playing on your insecurity
Big and strong, but he's really weak though
Take control of your mind and roll
Time to go, girl, the lessons are learned
Lift yourself, lift your blessings up

So what's it gonna be?
Are you gonna go around or are you gonna leave?
Heading in the wrong direction
Is this the girl that you wanna be?
Looking at him like he's a God figure
Maybe you just need a father figure

And now you're feeling it firsthand
At one point you wanted him to be your man, your man
Your man, your man

You're just gonna lay there?
You don't have to stay there
You deserve better
Miss Romantic
But he said he loves you
And also loves her too
It's a disrespect to yourself
Miss Romantic
They all know you, Miss Romantic
He's just gonna use you
And throw you when he's through
You're not what he wants
Miss Romantic

You are smart
You're no fool
You are brave
You are true
You won't lose
Trust in you
Trust in you
God's with you
