		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And terrified to see you
Hiding in the darkness
Colder in its twilight
And i've been feeling restless
Covered in the stars
Underneath the sky
Don't believe the shit they're saying
We're all the same on the inside
Covered in the stars
Covered in the stars
And terrified to see you
Hiding in the darkness
Colder in its twilight
And i've been feeling restless
Can you see me breathing
Standing here without you
I can see it's midnight
How can i live without you
Covered in the stars
Underneath the sky
Don't believe the shit they're saying
We're all the same on the inside
Covered in the stars
Covered in the stars
Covered in the stars
Covered in the stars
