		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In some of the nights, 
there's a glimpse of hope. 
And when it fades away, 
I know the treasure that I've lost.
Clouds in my head, 
bury the words you said. How mighty they are, even if they seem so far.
I'll maybe get wrecked by your illogical mind, 
but you should know that I have tried until I got blind.
On one of these days, 
we'll meet again. 
I'll go crazy for sure, 
by your beauty that once was mine.
I'll maybe get wrecked by your illogical mind, 
but you should know that I have tried until I got blind. I'll maybe get wrecked by your illogical mind, 
but you should know that I have tried until I got blind.
