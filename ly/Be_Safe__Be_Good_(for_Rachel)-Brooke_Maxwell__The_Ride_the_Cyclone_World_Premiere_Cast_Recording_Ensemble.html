		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never went out swimming
Directly after lunch
I didn't smoke no, I'd never text and drive
I always wore my seat belt, a life vest
Or sunscreen
I had plans to stick around and stay alive

Button up my jacket when the cold wind blew
I'd brush my teeth at least two times a day
I never sat too close to the television
To my parents, I would listen and obey

Be safe, they said be good

But things don't happen quite
The way they should

Oh, mama

You know I've tried my best to toe the line
'Cause I thought at first
That this universe had a reason or a rhyme

You can dot your T's and cross your I's
But steady yourself for the big surprise
'Cause sooner or later you realize

It's not fair! not fair

Boiled down and simplified
All that you can really do is buckle in
And hang on for the ride
