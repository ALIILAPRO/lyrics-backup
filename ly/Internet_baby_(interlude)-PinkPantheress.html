		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ayy)

You're a needy guy
But, I guess I kind of like that (I like that)
You came on too strong
But, I guess I kind of like that (I like that)
You're a needy guy
But, I guess I kind of like that (I like that)
You came on too strong
But, I guess I kind of like that (I like that)

I got this rhythm for you, you
It goes a little something like, "Oh, I"
You offered a brand new tattoo
You wanna put your name on me, here's why
My SDs, USBs, you want all of those
And now you want to borrow my clothes
I hope you know, you're not me, you can let it go
To me, you're just somebody I know

You're a needy guy
But, I guess I kind of like that (I like that)
You came on too strong
But, I guess I kind of like that (I like that)
You're a needy guy
But, I guess I kind of like that (I like that)
You came on too strong
But, I guess I kind of like that (I like that)

I am not your internet baby (baby)
I am not your internet baby (I like that)
I am not your internet baby (baby)
I am not your internet baby (I like that)
I am not your internet baby (not your internet)
I am not your internet baby (it's makin' me upset)
I am not your internet baby (I don't know why you're actin' like that, baby, no)
I am not your internet baby

Ayy (no matter what you say, you should go away)
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
