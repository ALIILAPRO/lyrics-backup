		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You chose a giant step - caught your eye
Guaranteed sweetness that you thought broken
And you were not fine
And bearing in mind
Other ones that you could have wed
And hopefully dread

and I wouldn't dare to
Bring out this 
Awful bliss

no I wouldn't dare to
Bring out this 
Awful bliss

no I wouldn't dare to
Bring out this 
Awful bliss
