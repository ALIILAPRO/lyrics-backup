		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The sun just went behind a cloud again 
Down crowded streets he walks alone 
He's a stranger out of place 
A number not a face 
And all day long, all day long

He's feelin' like an alien 
Feelin' like he don't belong 
Have mercy, cried the alien 
Help him find his way back home 
The feelin' that he feels he can't explain 
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, they're all the same 
He's lost and all alone 
A heart without a home 
Standin like a statue in the rain 

Now, now and then we all are aliens 
Feelin' like we don't belong 
Have mercy, cried the alien 
Help him find his way back home 
Feelin' like an alien 
he's feelin' like he don't belong 
Have mercy, cried the alien 
Help him find his way 
Help him find his way
