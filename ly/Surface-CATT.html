		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Right under the surface
First layer revealed
Scent of secrets
Still not what you feel

Second layer takes its time
Careful like you planned
Searching for the light
How you bow your head

You're not ready to fight
You know you shouldn't be
I'm not your steady light
But we can hold it up together, forever
Whatever that means so

You're not ready to fight
You know you shouldn't be
I'm not your steady light
But we can find it out together, forever
Whatever that means so

Ooh
Ooh

White under the surface
How far can you dive?
Scent of secrets
Until you and I

Landing on the same ground
Sparkling in our eyes
Baffled by what we had found
Please do not let it die again

You're not ready to fight
You know you shouldn't be
I'm not your steady light
But we can hold it up together, forever
Whatever that means so

You're not ready to fight
You know you shouldn't be
I'm not your steady light
But we can find it out together, forever
Whatever that means so
