		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If this room was burning
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind
With your little white lies, little white lies

You say it's getting late
It's getting late
And you don't know if you can stay
If you can stay

But you, you don't tell the truth
No you, you like playing games

Your hands touching me, they're touching me
And your eyes keep saying things
They say what we do
When it's only me and you
I can't concentrate

That's all I'm thinking about
All I keep thinking about
Everything else just fades away

If this room was burning
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind
With your little white lies, little white lies

You say you're a good girl
But I know you would girl
'Cause you've been telling me all night
With your little white lies, little white lies
With your little white lies, little white lies

Back seat of the cab
We're in the cab
My lips getting so attached
They're so attached

Now you wanna make some rules
Now cool then we'll watch them break tonight

I know what you want
And I've been waiting so long

If this room was burning
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind
With your little white lies, little white lies

You say you're a good girl
But I know you would girl
'Cause you've been telling me all night.
With your little white lies, little white lies
With your little white lies, little white lies

I know you want it
I know you feel it too
Let's stop pretending
That you don't know what I don't know
Just what we came to do

If this room was burning
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind
With your little white lies, little white lies

You say you're a good girl
But I know you would girl
'Cause you've been telling me all night
With your little white lies, little white lies
With your little white lies, little white lies
