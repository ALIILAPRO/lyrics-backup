		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come away with me in the night
Come away with me
And I will write you a song

Come away with me on a bus
Come away where they can't tempt us with their lies

And I want to walk with you
On a cloudy day
In fields where the yellow grass grows knee-high
So won't you try to come

Come away with me and we'll kiss
On a mountaintop
Come away with me
And I'll never stop loving you

And I want to wake up with the rain
Falling on a tin roof
While I'm safe there in your arms
So all I ask is for you
To come away with me in the night
Come away with me
