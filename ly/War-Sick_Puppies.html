		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's do this

Faking falls
Stop and stall
Take it all
Fact is, I'm taking mine
I'm taking mine

Time is up
Out of luck
Should've stood up when you had the time
But you're out of time

Let's do this (fight, fight)
Lock and load (fight)
Rock and roll
Bitch, it's all over (fight)
You're going down (fight)
You're going down (fight)

Get ready to settle the score
And get ready to face the floor
'Cause it's time to remember it (war)

This is war
And it's on tonight
So get up and fight
Get up and fight
You had all your life
To run and hide
Now step up, now step up
Let's do this

Sat around
Going down
How about a little reaction, man?
You can barely stand
Bitch slap, slow attack
Man, that was practically suicide
Next in line

(Here we go)
Fight
Fight
Fight
Fight
Fight
Fight
Fight
Fight

Get ready to settle the score
And get ready to face the floor
'Cause it's time to remember it (war)

This is war
And it's on tonight
So get up and fight
Get up and fight
You had all your life
To run and hide
Now step up, now step up
Let's do this

'Cause we're all about ready to break
Yeah, we're all about ready to break
Yeah, we're all about ready to break
Yeah, we're all about ready to break

This is war
And it never ends
So get up, get up, get up, get up

You had all your life
To run and hide
Now step up, now step up

This is war (and it never ends)
This is war (and it never ends)
This is war

Let's do this
Let's do this
Fight
Fight
Fight
Fight
Fight
Fight
Fight
Let's do this
