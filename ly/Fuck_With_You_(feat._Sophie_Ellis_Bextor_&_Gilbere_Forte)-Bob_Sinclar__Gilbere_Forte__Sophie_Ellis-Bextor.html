		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me away on a holiday sugar
We can be free, alone by the river
A glass of champagne in a candy rain
Dancing on a rainbow

And if you've got a baby
Just don't tell her that you're hanging with me
I'll be your baby from the movie screen

And if she calls you baby
Someone tell her she should worry
I've got a plan and yes I'm bound to win

Feel like Marilyn Monroe and
Darlin' I came here for you
And no, you're not allowed to go
Until I fuck with you

Feel like Marilyn Monroe and
Darlin' I came here for you
And no, you're not allowed to go
Until I fuck with you

Take me on a trip around the moon
I wanna fuck with you

Na na na na na na na na

Take what you want, baby be my big spender
Unleash a tightest night is nothing like tender
Gamble and win, play the cards rough
They control my sugar rush

And if you've got a baby
Just don't tell her that you're hanging with me
I'll be your baby from the movie screen

And if she calls you baby
Someone tell her she should worry
I've got a plan and yes I'm bound to win

Feel like Marilyn monroe and
Darlin' I came here for you
And no, you're not allowed to go
Until I fuck with you

Feel like Marilyn Monroe and
Darlin' I came here for you
And no, you're not allowed to go
Until I fuck with you

Take me on a trip around the moon
I wanna fuck with you
Yes

Ah,
Lets make arrange miss
I'm your fix when you're in madness
Call me crazy, awesome, baby
Imma take your love to the maximum steady

Such a wild boy, no need explaining
Love's worth money you ain't got to pay me
Look me in the eye cos you want me baby
Make you love me so much that you fucking hate me

Imma fuck you then fuck your friend
And fuck her cos I've fucked her twin
Livin' life so pure with an etch of sin
Clear, no need to fear

Moving so fast that its hard to steer
I hope we don't crash when we land in here
Being your best lover was the plan for years
Take it back to the town we'll be standing in here

I wanna fuck with you
I wanna fuck with you
I want I want I want
I wanna fuck with you-oh-hooo
