		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy-yeah

What?
I didn't hear a single word of that
What the fuck you mean, "Why aren't you coming back?"
Who would tell you such a stupid thing?
608 been hiding preparing for all my dreams, ayy
What the fuck you mean by, "Quality I lack"?
What you tryna say, "I'm never coming back"?
Who would tell you such a stupid thing?
608 been hiding preparing for all my dreams, ayy

What's the point in tryna give an explanation?
I'm not going down that route, a criminal investigation
See I'm not dead
Blood red
Preparing for bloodshed
Get your own act together before you lose your head, ayy
I switch off, it gets too much at times
I see the end, I reach out for it like I've seen the light
I feel braindead but I've learned my lines
So when you ask me stupid questions, I can save time
Shut the fuck up, I'm getting bored of this
The more you interrogate me, the more I'm getting pissed
If I answer, consider yourself lucky
'Cause now my ears are blocked and I can't hear a thing

What?
I didn't hear a single word of that
What the fuck you mean, "Why aren't you coming back?"
Who would tell you such a stupid thing?
608 been hiding preparing for all my dreams, ayy
What the fuck you mean by, "Quality I lack"?
What you tryna say, "I'm never coming back"?
Who would tell you such a stupid thing?
608 been hiding preparing for all my dreams, ayy
