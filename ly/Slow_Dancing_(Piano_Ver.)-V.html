		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's about time we get it straight
Gimme a minute if it ain't too late
대충 무리였나 봐 babe
애먼 기분만 해친 채
버티기가 이만큼 힘든데
Stay with me 'til the end of the day

Maybe we
Could be
Slow dancing
Until the morning
We could be romancing
The night away, yeah

Turnin' me up and back off like this
What do you want? Do you not like it?
Stop teasin' me, girl
Now, you made me leave my heart out here
날 딛고 올라가
다시 새로 누군가 (got it on, did you?)
닮았던 우리가
먼 이웃 같은 날

Maybe we
Could be
Slow dancing
Until the morning
We could be romancing
The night away, yeah
