		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love you 
I love you 
And this is eternal, oh 

It's love, true love 
That brings my heart to you 
Home to you girl, yeah 
And it's the same 
Deep feeling of love 
That brings you close to, to me baby 
Oh, but tonight I want my arms 
And body wrapped all around you 
All around you 
For as close as we both are 
So much closer we will be 
Believe in me, yeah 

[Chorus]
Here and now 
I wanna take a lover's vow 
I want you to come with me now 
Let's make tonight the first night of a love eternal 

Day and night 
We'll have an everlasting life 
I wanna feel it shining bright 
Let's make tonight the first night of a love eternal 

Here in this place our passions move 
Move in slow motion 
Oh, while the rest of the world 
In real time passes by, rushes by 
Oh, I expressly forbid 
Any heartache to ever, ever, ever, ever 
Come anywhere, anywhere, anywhere near you girl 
Oh, we'll use our love as protection 
You'll never, never, never, never 
Never have to cry oh, dry your eyes 

[Chorus] x2

I'll dry your eyes girl, oh 

[Chorus] x2

Hey, oooh, oooh baby 
Oh, Lord have mercy 
You see, all I know is I love you girl 
And I need you baby 
Ooo weee, oooh wee 
Ooo wee, ooh wee baby 
Ah, ah, ah 
Feel your body 
All around me baby 
I don't need no one but you girl 
Oh, for the rest of my life 
Your life and my life 
We'll be eternal 

(Baby our love's eternal) 
(Baby my love is eternal) 

Oh whoa, whoa oh, oh yeah 
Yeah, oh I need, trust in you girl 
Nobody can tell me anything 
Anything, anything about you baby 
You been good to me girl 
Oh, this is forever baby 
Forever and ever and ever and ever 
Ever, ever, ever 
It's eternal 
Forever, ever, ever, ever, ever ever 
Oh, I, I love you girl 
I really, really, really, really, really really ,really
