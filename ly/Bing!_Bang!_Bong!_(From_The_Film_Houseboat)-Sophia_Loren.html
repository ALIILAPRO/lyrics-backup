		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Prego, prego
Anywhere you may go
Make each day be a day full of fun
If there's a game or a girl to be won
Do it with a bing bang bong
(A bing bang bong)
A bing bang bong

Presto, presto
Do your very besto
Don't hang back like a shy little kid
You'll be so glad that you did what you did
If you do it with a Bing Bang Bong
(A Bing Bang Bong)
A Bing Bang Bong

Be like Cristobal Columbo
Take a chance, take a chance
Don't be a dopey or a dumbo
Goin' round in a trance

One step, two step
Step into a new step
Live your life with a zip and a zing
You'll have the world on the end of a string
If you do it with a bing bang bong
(A Bing Bang Bong)
A bing bang bong

Prego, prego
Anywhere you may go
Make each day be a day full of fun
If there's a game or a girl to be won
Do it with a Bing Bang Bong
(A bing bang bong)
A bing bang bong

Be like Cristobal Columbo
Take a chance, take a chance
Don't be a dopey or a dumbo
Goin' 'round in a trance

One step, two step
Step into a new step
Live your life with a zip and a zing
You'll have the world on the end of a string
If you do it with a Bing Bang Bong
(A bing bang bong)

A bing bang bong
A bing bang bong
