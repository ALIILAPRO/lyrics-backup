		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We don't define each other
Stand on your own, be a pillar
Lay on my pillow
Ain't fairly new to each other, call you my lover
Drinks to my liver, I cry now a river
Full of tears

Don't you ever hope for something else?
Don't you ever hope for something else?

Breeze outside my window turned to color
Know that I will see the sun again
Leaves have turned into a tint of orange
Answers that will lie inside myself
What will I leave behind me?
Where will I choose to go?
To tell the truth, I'm tired of falling
When I'm floating I'm closer to you
We can't control all the outcomes
Let go of the reins, ride the rhythm
Doubled my vision, ain't fairly new to this feeling
Searchin' for meaning, still don't believe it
Stopped at the ceiling, all these
Lightly floating, ecstasy

Don't you ever hope for something else?

Breeze outside my window turned to color
Know that I will see the sun again
Leaves have turned into a tint of orange
Answers that will lie inside myself
What will I leave behind me?
Where will I choose to go?
To tell the truth, I'm tired of falling
When I'm floating I'm closer to you

We don't define each other
Stand on your own, be a pillar
Lay on my pillow
Call you my lover
Drinks to my liver, I cry now a river
Full of tears

Don't you ever hope for something else?
