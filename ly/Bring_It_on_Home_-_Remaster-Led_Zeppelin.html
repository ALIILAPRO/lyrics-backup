		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby
Mmm baby
'M gonna bring it on home to you
I've got my ticket, I've got that load
Gone up, go higher, all aboard
'M take my seat, a-right way back, ooooh yeah
Watch this train goin' down the track
Gonna bring it on home
Bring it on home to you
Watch out, watch out, man move

Try to tell you baby
What you tryin' to do
Tryin' to love me baby
Love some other man too
Bring it on home, bring it on home

Went 'n a little walk downtown, ah yeah
Missed 'n got back late
Found a note there waiting
An' it said, Daddy, I just can't wait
Bring it on home, bring it on home
Bring it back home, bring it back home to me baby

Tell you, pretty baby
You love to mess me 'roun'
I'm gonna give you lovin', baby
Gonna move you outta town
Bring it on home, bring it on home

Sweetest little baby
Daddy ever saw
I'm gonna keep you lovin' baby
I'm gonna give you more
Bring it on home, bring it on home
Bring it on home, alright

Bring it on home
Bring it on home to you
