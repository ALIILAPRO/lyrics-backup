		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take a ride with me on my motorcycle 
You and me on my motorcycle  
Ride with me on my motorcycle tonight
On my motorcycle tonight

I take a ride in the night
Streets are empty no one insite
I don't know where I'm heading for
I just wanna drive some more

The next time I don't want to be alone
Next time I'm gonna call you on the phone

Take a ride with me on my motorcycle 
You and me on my motorcycle  
Ride with me on my motorcycle tonight
On my motorcycle tonight

Take a ride with me in the sun
Come with me and let's have some fun
Different places I wanna see
Why don't you take a ride with me

The next time I don't wanna to be alone
Next time I'm gonna call you on the phone

Take a ride with me on my motorcycle 
You and me on my motorcycle  
Ride with me on my motorcycle tonight

Take a ride with me on my motorcycle 
You and me on my motorcycle  
Ride with me on my motorcycle tonight
On my motorcycle tonight

Take a ride with me on my motorcycle 
You and me on my motorcycle  
Ride with me on my motorcycle tonight

Take a ride with me on my motorcycle 
You and me on my motorcycle  
Ride with me on my motorcycle tonight

Take a ride with me on my motorcycle 
You and me on my motorcycle  
Ride with me on my motorcycle tonight
