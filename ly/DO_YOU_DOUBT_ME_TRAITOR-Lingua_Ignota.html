		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How can you doubt me now?
How can you doubt me?
How can you doubt me now?
How can you doubt me?

Every stone on every mountain
Is etched with my name
Every vein, of every leaf, of every tree
Is slaked with poison

If you rise up to heaven
I turn the sun to blind you
If you sleep deep in hell
I have chains to bind you

How can you doubt me now?
How can you doubt me?

How can you doubt me now?
How can you doubt me?

Satan!
Satan!
Satan get beside me!

Satan!
Satan!
Satan fortify me!

I don't eat
I don't sleep
I don't eat
I don't sleep

I don't eat
I don't sleep
I don't eat
I don't sleep
I don't eat
I let it consume me

How do I break you
Before you break me?
How, how do I break you
Before you break me?

How do I break you?
How do I break you?
How?
How?
How do I break you?

How?
How do I break you

How do I break you?
How do I break you
Before you break me?
How do I break you
Before you break me?
How do I break you?
How do I break you?

How?
How?
How do I break you?

How?
How do I break you?

When all this is ended
As cruel as I am
Remember how I loved you
But that nothing, nothing can stand

My friends all wear your colors
Your flag flies above every door
But bitch I smell you bleeding
And I know where you sleep

Do you doubt me traitor?
Throw your body in the fucking river
I'm the cunt killer

And I don't eat
I don't sleep
I don't eat
I don't sleep
