		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Goodbye was the best thing you told me
Only time that I ever heard the truth
Even now I'm haunted by the whole thing
Can't believe I believed in you

Oh 
I sing to myself all alone in the dark
And, oh
I could run but I won't get far

'Cause baby, you're the ghost in my guitar
Tugging all the strings inside my heart
And when I try to write you out
I write you down
It's pouring out again
I hear it in my head and there you are
Bringing back the best and the worst parts
And when I try to let you go
You still echo
'Cause baby, you're the ghost in my guitar

Yeah, I wanna smash it like a rockstar in a hotel room
Before I tell it all the things that I can't tell you
I wanna burn it down to ashes in the driveway
Set that shit on fire, babe
You don't get to haunt me

Oh
I've been telling my friends, and they're calling me crazy
Oh
I'm believing them lately

'Cause baby, you're the ghost in my guitar
Tugging all the strings inside my heart
And when I try to write you out
I write you down
It's pouring out again
I hear it in my head and there you are
Bringing back the best and the worst parts
And when I try to let you go
You still echo
'Cause baby, you're the ghost in my guitar

I don't wanna hear another sad song
I don't want a melody to open the door
I told myself the last was the last one
Well, here's one more

Oh
I don't wanna write another sad song, sad song
Oh, no, no, no

Baby, you're the ghost in my guitar
Tugging all the strings inside my heart
And when I try to write you out
I write you down
It's pouring out again
I hear it in my head and there you are
Bringing back the best and the worst parts
And when I try to let you go
You still echo
'Cause baby, you're the ghost in my guitar

Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Baby, you're the ghost in my guitar
Baby, you're the ghost
You're the ghost in my guitar
