		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We always know in the first minute or so
If something's worth 
Staying for

We always know
You fools trying to go deeper
Don't you see how easy it should be?
You fools trying to go deeper
Don't you see how easy it should be?

If you have to go to the bottom of a hole 
To find what's wrong
Just let it go

Everyone told us it's hard
But they were wrong

When you love, you love it all
And nothing is impossible

You fools trying to go deeper
Don't you see how easy it should be?
You fools trying to go deeper
Don't you see how easy it should be?

Everyone told us it's hard
But they were wrong
Everyone told us it's hard
But they were wrong
When we love, we love it all
And nothing is impossible
