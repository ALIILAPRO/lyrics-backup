		  Wait, that ain't me?
You tellin' me that, that that ain't me? 
That's, sheesh
(bbno$)

All them freaky hoes shop at Whole Foods (Whole Foods)
Baby, let me pay for your tofu (tofu)
Gravy got a new go-to (go-to)
Yeah, that vegan ass on some whole new shit, baby
I be posted with them freaks at Whole Foods (at Whole Foods)
Baby, let me pay for your tofu (tofu)
Them granola hoes ain't got no rules (no rules)
Feelin' healthy layin' pipe at Whole Foods

Gravy walk up in it, I'm just tryna get somethin' to eat (woo)
I walk up to the counter, lady, heard y'all got some heat (some heat)
Shawty lookin' at me like she heard I got some meat (meat)
Shit, baby, what's up with it? Heard y'all got some freaks

If the freaks in aisle four
Well, I guess I'm goin' poor (whoa)
Ten percent off bad bitches? 
Damn, I love this store
I bought that girl a quinoa salad
She said I need to clean my palate
I bought myself a vegan patty
I need that green 'cause I'm an addict
I never cap it

Goin' shoppin' in a peacoat (in a peacoat)
Eatin' gluten-free Doritos (Doritos)
With a gluten-free freak ho (freak ho)
Ayy, I'm touchin' butts like I'm Nemo

She be lactose intolerant, yeah, it's kinda botherin'
It's funny how our GMO dicks kept them hollerin'
Baby, what's your diet? You should do some modellin'
(Um, drinkin' beer and eatin' pussy) nice

All them freaky hoes shop at Whole Foods (Whole Foods)
Baby, let me pay for your tofu (tofu)
Gravy got a new go-to (go-to)
Yeah, that vegan ass on some whole new shit, baby (ayy, ooh, ayy, ayy, ayy)
I be posted with them freaks at Whole Foods (at Whole Foods)
Baby, let me pay for your tofu (tofu)
Them granola hoes ain't got no rules (no rules)
Feelin' healthy layin' pipe at Whole Foods

You know she got that smart pop, good brain
Oh, you want Chicago mix?
Coke with the sugar cane
No iceberg, only romaine
Woo, can't drink Minute Maid
Lady, I'm a minute mane
She only eatin' zero-grain
Wait, how you thick?

You look like you eat bologna sandwiches for breakfast (goddamn)
I'm like Whole Foods produce, I'm the freshest (fresh, baby)
She ain't got a cellphone, had to leave a message
She ain't had kombucha yet, so she gettin' aggressive

"Girl, you do pottery?" Oh, I love astrology
I get too much brain, baby, I need a lobotomy
Put that light up, salt rock, red meat, cock-block
Hot dog, soya based, wheat grass, dry plate
Fuck your groceries, fuck your groceries
Fuck your groceries, fuck your groceries, huh
We supposed to be fuckin' groceries
Let's have a fuckin' baby at the grocery store
