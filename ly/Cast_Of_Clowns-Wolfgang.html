		  Father I know now your 	
Life's been stretched too long
Across paper torn and crumpled was drown the garden that we've sown
You made me, so damn happy
Wanting to follow you around but leading a cast of clowns
How could you expect me to worship your name
Father I know now it's etched to deep in sand
I'm sorry... so sorry I couldn't wipe it with my hand
So unhappy you made the sky come down
Father I smile now wings have stretched to the sky
When I look up at the heavens 
I see your face in the stars at night
Again you made me happy
The stage has been turned down
The clowns have lost their crowd
Now sleep well and sound
Quietly rest
