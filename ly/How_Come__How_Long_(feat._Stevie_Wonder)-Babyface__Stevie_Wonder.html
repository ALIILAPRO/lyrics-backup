		  Hey, come here for a second
I don't like the way he treats you
He doesn't deserve you
He really don't

What kind of man
Would leave you standing in the cold?
Must've been a silly one
To sacrifice a pot of gold
You're the kind of woman
That needs a man that's always there
It's not that you require a lot
Just need some tender love and care, girl

I give good love
I'll buy your clothes
I'll cook your dinner too (yeah)
Soon as I get home from work
I'll pay your rent
Your faithful lover (ooh baby)
Soon as I get home
Soon as I get home from work
Girl, I'll treat you right
And I'll never lie
For all that it's worth
I give good love 
(Good love, good love, good love, girl)

It doesn't make sense
That you should have a broken heart
If I were the only one
I'd never let you fall apart
You're the kind of woman
That needs a man with lots of cash
With a stack of major credit cards
And with me you don't have to ask

I give good love
I'll buy your clothes
I'll cook your dinner too (ooh baby)
Soon as I get home from work
I'll pay your rent
Your faithful lover
(Soon as) Soon as I get home
Soon as I get home from work
Girl, I'll treat you right
And I'll never lie or flirt
(Girl I'l never, never, never mess around, no)

Soon as I get home
Soon as I get home from work
(I'm coming straight home to you, baby)
Girl I'll be around, never let you down
For all that it's worth
I give good love 
(Good love, good love, good love, good love)
Oh, I give good love 
(Good love, good love, good love, good love)

(I give good love) I give good love (yes)
I'll buy your clothes
I'll cook your dinner too (yeah)
Soon as I get home from work
I'll pay your rent
Your faithful lover 
Soon as I get home
Soon as I get home from work
Girl, I'll treat you right
And I'll never lie or flirt
(I will never, never, never, never mess around, baby)

Soon as I get home
Soon as I get home from work
(I'm coming straight home to you baby yes I am)
Girl I'll be around, never let you down
For all that it's worth
I give good love 
(Good love, good love, good love, good love)
I give good love 
(Good love, good love, good love, good love)

(Good love, good love, good love, good love)
