		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh-oh I see shadows 
and they’re at my window
Feelings I’ve never known 
Uh-oh heads a junkyard 
so cold midnight graveyard 
Uh-oh I’m gonna again

Wake me up when you’re sober
When you don’t wanna give up 
Do you wanna feel better 
Better
Wake me up cause I wanna 
get away from the trauma 
can anyone make this better?

Every time my hearts under attack I
I slam my skull into a wall
Every time I think of going back I 
I slam my skull into a wall 
I felt so indestructible 
But now I feel out of control
Anytime I think of going back I
I slam my skull into a wall

Uh-oh I feel hollow 
Seems like there’s no tomorrow 
Head hurts it might explode 
Uh-oh need a restart 
I’ll send you a postcard
Uh oh I’m gone again

Wake me up if you’re crying
Please stop cause you’re dying 
I’ll help you feel better better 
I’ll wake you up cause I wanna 
Help you to feel something 
Yeah I think I could make you better 

Every time my hearts under attack I
I slam my skull into a wall
Every time I think of going back I
I slam my skull into a wall 
I felt so indestructible 
But now I feel out of control
Any time I think of going back I
I slam my skull into a wall
