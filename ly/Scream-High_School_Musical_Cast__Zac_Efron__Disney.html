		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The day a door is closed
The echoes fill your soul
They won't say which way to go
Just trust your heart

To find you're here for
Open another door
But I'm not sure anymore
It's just so hard

Voices in my head
Tell me they know best
Got me on the edge
They're pushin', pushin'
They're pushin'
I know they've got a plan
But the balls in my hands
This time its man-to-man
I'm driving, fighting inside

A world that's upside down
Spinning faster
What do I do now? without you

I don't know, where to go, what's the right team
I want my own thing. so bad I'm gonna scream
I can't choose, so confused,what's it all mean
I want my own dream. so bad I'm gonna scream

I'm kickin' down the walls
I gotta make 'em fall
Just break through them all
I'm punchin', crashin', I'm gonna
Fight to find myself
Me and no one else
Which way, I can't tell
I'm searchin', searchin', can't find the
Road that I should take
I should! turn right or left is
It's like nothing works without you

I don't know, where to go, what's the right team
I want my own thing, so bad I'm gonna scream
I can't choose, so confused, what's it all mean
I want my own dream, so bad I'm gonna scream

Yeah, the clock's running down
Hear the crowd gettin' loud
I'm consumed by the sound
Is it her, is it love
Can the music ever be enough
Gotta work it out, gotta work it out
You can do it, you can do it

I don't know, where to go, what's the right team
I want my own thing, so bad I'm gonna scream
I can't choose, so confused, what's it all mean
I want my own dream, so bad I'm gonna scream

I don't know, where to go, what's the right team
I want my own thing, I want my own thing
I can't choose, so confused!, what's it all mean
I want my own dream, so bad I'm gonna scream

Oh
Ah
