		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ? by the break of day
You are now entirely mine again
Still I hold you in my arms
There is not much to talk about anyway

Quite emotional now
Right by your side, straight to the bone, for you
Quite emotional now, not making sense

You keep on whispering that you won't stop
I take it back, babe
Everything that I have said
And I hold you in my arms
There's no better place for me and you anyway

Quite emotional now
Drifting pass the point of reason's way
Quite emotional now, not making sense
Quite emotional now, not making sense
Quite emotional now, not making sense

So like I am in your, your head
Quite emotional now

I don't believe you now
