		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Into the battles, making cages rattle 
There's a pain that's inside us and we're letting it out
Charge right in, we dare to fail
No one is giving in, always we live to win
A hunger turns and burns inside of all of us
And it will not be denied

Walking a path untraveled to reach higher level
Challenging always going against the grain
Blood for blood, that is the rule
And we will make the rules, never be fortune's fool
There's right and wrong in almost everything we do
For us we do what is right

Bulldozer feeds upon the weaker as they fall
Bulldozer crushes all

Somebody told me I should do what they told me
But there's a hole in that plan and I'm tearing it down
Trust our guts, follow our hearts
No one can break these nuts, these lips ain't kissing butts
The path of most resistance tests all of our strength
This strength will not be denied

Bulldozer feeds upon the weaker as they fall
Bulldozer crushes all
Bulldozer feeds upon the weaker as they fall
Bulldozer crushes all

Walking on paths untraveled
Challenging one and all
Deeper into the battles
Alone and standing tall
The more evolving changes
The more we stay the same
Full steam against the odds
Go headfirst against the grain

Full steam we go against the odds
Headfirst we go against the grain

Bulldozer goes against the odds
Bulldozer goes against the grain

Against the odds, against the grain
We go against the odds, against the grain

This is the bulldozer
This is the bulldozer
