		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I think I was born on the day that I met you
Spent all of my days, all my nights praying you never let me go
I hate to admit that I still got some shit from my fucked up past
But you've managed to break down my walls (walls)

You love me so much, it gave me enough
Enough to finally have the guts to love myself
Thought that I'd been deep, yeah, I could've sworn
But everything you are to me is so much more

You made me realize that I've never loved anyone before
You made me realize that I've never loved anyone before

The only complaint that I got is that I'm fucking scared now
The fact that we do, I had so much to lose, got me terrified
And if the world ends and it pulls us apart
Then you know I promise to find you wherever you are (wherever you are)

You love me so much, it gave me enough
Enough to finally have the guts to love myself
Thought that I'd been deep, yeah, I could've sworn
But everything you are to me is so much more

You made me realize that I've never loved anyone before
You made me realize that I've never loved anyone before

Yeah, you're lighting up my soul
When I start you help me finish
Pull me up when I feel low
A year could feel like minutes
And when my eyes are gettin' tired
You hold them open wide
I wouldn't think twice if you asked me to die for you

You love me so much, it gave me enough
Enough to finally have the guts to love myself
Thought that I'd been deep, yeah, I could've sworn
But everything you are to me is so much more

You made me realize that I've never loved anyone before
You made me realize that I've never loved anyone before
