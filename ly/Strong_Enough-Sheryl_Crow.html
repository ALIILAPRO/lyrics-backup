		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  God, I feel like hell tonight
The tears of rage, I cannot lie
I'd be the last to help you understand

Are you strong enough to be my man?
My man

Nothing's true and nothing's right
So let me be alone tonight
'Cause you can't change the way I am
Are you strong enough to be my man?

Lie to me
I promise I'll believe
Lie to me
But please don't leave, don't leave

I have a face I cannot show
I make the rules up as I go
Just try and love me if you can
Are you strong enough to be my man?
My man

(Are you strong enough)
To be my man?
(Are you strong enough)
To be my man?
(Are you strong enough)
My man

When I've shown you that I just don't care
When I'm throwing punches in the air
When I'm broken down and I can't stand
Would you be man enough to be my man?

Lie to me
I promise I'll believe
Lie to me
But please don't leave
