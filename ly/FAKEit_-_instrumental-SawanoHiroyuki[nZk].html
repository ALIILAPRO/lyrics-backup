		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  買い被った机上之論 倣う
You pretend to know the story
But you were wrong
疑心暗鬼の攻防戦
I don't wanna be fooled again
偽善者風情は何奴だ?

Got a killer in me
I got a skeleton
Get away, I don't need a good Samaritan
弛む口元に見透かした
漂う幻影が下す采配
The walls have ears
Don't even breathe
黙る選択など取らない

So, get the justice

Don't you fake it now?
Don't just take a bow
うつろう実体の業燃やす サンクチュアリはない
Don't you fake it now?
Don't just take a bow
振り返す痛みごと
Drink your justice

Hell, just beat your enemy
赦しを乞うように差し出す愚弄の evidence
But this spirit doesn't break
Just beat your enemy
邪推は執拗に蝕んでいく providence
But this spirit doesn't break

醜態も崇拝も
曝した蔽は on and on
Vicious lies
Fear makes them strong
You came here

So get the justice

Don't you fake it now?
Don't just take a bow
因果の応報が掻き鳴らす カタストロフィーのネガ
Don't you fake it now?
Don't just take a bow
振り返す痛みごと
Drink your justice

So, just beat your enemy
赦しを乞うように差し出す愚弄の evidence
But this spirit doesn't break
Just beat your enemy
執着は巧妙に蝕んでいく providence
But this spirit doesn't break

Now, yeah, yeah, woo, nah, yeah
Come on, don't you fight now? No, no, no, no
Huh, we're under control
Huh, let me open the door
Yeah, come on now
Do that, get it, get it, get it (yeah)
