		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  An apple a day keeps the doctor away
That's what everybody says
But salicylates turn on my fight or flight
So I'm better off in bed

With a body of norm, and the cells that you don
Your average hemoglobin count
The tetany overtakes me
I wanna be okay, but the odds I really doubt

Stop giving advice
You don't know what it's like
Being stuck with my disease
When help you're denied 'cause they say it's benign
But you're chronically fatigued
Now my throat's full of flies
But I eat it despite
The overload of histamines
It's gonna be kinda tricky
Why don't you try and fix me?

You're doing well
No, I'm feeling like hell
But I cannot say too much
Thinking I'm in good health
Now I'm covered in welts
From my mast cells flaring up
Curling in on myself
'Cause there's nobody else
Who gets so easily undone
The look of it isn't pretty
As anyone can see, I'm a tragedy

Invisible disability?
It's rather visible to me
An illness like this goes very far
Beneath the skin
My arms are looking like bathroom walls
There's something stuck inside my lungs
You cannot comprehend the pain I'm in

Oh
I am a medical anomaly
There's something seriously wrong with me
And every day there's something new to note
I'm losing sight of my entelechy

Look what we have in store
Yes, I've seen it before
I can get you back on top
Just don't overextend, get some rest in your bed
And then that will make it stop

I don't feel the effects
Is it all in my head?
Maybe I need a bigger dose
Was any of this deserving?
Is that why it's not working?

In a short time you'll be asleep
Just take a breath and count to three
The tourniquet's tied so tightly
All around my limbs
And every day they're drawing blood
There are mushrooms growing in my lungs
I'm waiting for the ending to begin

Oh
I am a medical anomaly
Unknown, mysterious biology
Symptoms come from the places no one knows
My body doesn't function normally

I am a medical anomaly
There's nothing wrong with you that I can see
I don't know how much longer I can go
I'm ripped apart by my repellence

I am a medical anomaly
I'm turning into a monstrosity
Another day I've been misdiagnosed
You better try to treat me properly

A CAT scan, a nasal rinse
The biopsies and IV drips
The medicine is flowing underneath my skin
They've given me every type of drug
There are sticks and stones inside my guts
They do not know what kind of pain I'm in

The doctors don't know what to do with me
Somebody tell me what is wrong with me

Yeah, I'm that medical anomaly (I'm an anomaly)
There's something rotten that's inside of me (inside of me)
And all these things I've had to undergo
They've all meant absolutely nothing (no, nothing at all)
I am the medical anomaly (I'm the anomaly)
Lost in my own peculiarity (you're scared of me)
I feel like I'm already decomposed
Just let the mold become a part of me
