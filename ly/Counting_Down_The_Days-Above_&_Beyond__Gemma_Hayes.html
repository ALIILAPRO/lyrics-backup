		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been counting down the days and the nights
Since you last said that you loved me
And it's cold here in the shadows with no light
Since you last said that you loved me

I've been counting down the days and the nights
Since you last said that you loved me
And it's cold here in the shadows with no light
Since you last said that you loved me

Time is like an enemy leaving lovers by the side
The more you cling to love, the more you're gonna lose your mind
All I feel is sadness now
Taking over, taking over, taking over
All I see is black clouds of doubt
Taking over, taking over, taking over

I've been counting down the days and the nights
Since you last said that you loved me
And it's cold here in the shadows with no light
Since you last said that you loved me

Time is like an enemy leaving lovers by the side
The more you cling to love, the more you're gonna lose your mind
All I feel is sadness now
Taking over, taking over, taking over

I've been counting down the days and the nights
Since you last said that you loved me
And it's cold here in the shadows with no light
Since you last said that you loved me
