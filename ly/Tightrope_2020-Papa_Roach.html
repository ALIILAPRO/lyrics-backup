		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My words are weapons
In which I murder you with
Please don't be scared
Please do not turn your head
We are the future, the 21st century dyslexic
Glue sniffing cyber sluts
With homicidal minds and handguns
We are insane, nothing will change
We are insane, nothing will change

There is a thin line between what
Is good and what is evil
And, I will tiptoe down that line
But I will feel unstable
My life is a circus and I
Am trippin' down that tightrope
Well, there is nothing to save me now
So I will look down
And again, and again, and again
And it happеns again and again, and again

There's no beginning, thеre is no end
There is only change progression backwards
Is this where we are heading
Take back your soul, forget your emptiness

There is a thin line between what
Is good and what is evil
And, I will tiptoe down that line
But I will feel unstable
My life is a circus and I
Am tripping down that tightrope
Well, there is nothing to save me now
So I will look down fallin' to the ground
Down to the ground all the way down

I speak of madness, my heart and soul
I cry for people who ain't got control
Let's take our sanity, let's take compassion
And be responsible for every action
Hell no, no how, no way, no way
No way, no how, no way, no how

There is a thin line between what
Is good and what is evil
And, I will tiptoe down that line
But I will feel unstable
My life is a circus and I
Am tripping down that tightrope
Well, there is nothing to save me now
I'm fallin' to the ground

Fallin' to the ground all the way down
Hidden in the dirt
