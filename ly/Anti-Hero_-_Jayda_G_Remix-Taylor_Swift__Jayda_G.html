		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's me, hi
It's me, hi

I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

It's me, hi (I'm, I'm the problem)
(I'm, I'm the pro-pro-problem)
It's me, hi (I'm, I'm the problem)
(I'm, I'm the pro-pro-problem)

Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Did you hear my covert narcissism
I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

It's me, hi (I'm, I'm the problem)
(I'm, I'm the pro-pro-problem)
It's me, hi (I'm, I'm the problem)
(I'm, I'm the pro-pro-problem)
(I'm, I'm the problem)
(I'm, I'm the pro-pro-problem)
(I'm, I'm the problem)
(I'm, I'm the pro-pro-problem)

Me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi, everybody agrees, everybody agrees

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

It's me, hi (I'm, I'm the problem)
(I'm, I'm the pro-pro-problem)
It's me, hi (I'm, I'm the problem)
(I'm, I'm the pro-pro-problem)
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

It's me, hi (I'm, I'm the problem)
(I'm, I'm the pro-pro-problem)
It's me, hi (I'm, I'm the problem)
(I'm, I'm the pro-pro-problem)

I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
