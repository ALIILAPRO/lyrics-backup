		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something always seemed to be surreal
When you always knew what to do with me
I gotta find another way to stand
You’ll no longer be here, baby tell me what’s the deal

It’s still ringing in my head
All the words you tried to say, and I know you tried to help
But I gotta walk away
And I won’t hold you back again

When I’m out at night, lighted by the moon
I wonder what you’d do
Then I’m in my car, on my way home
I wanna drive to you
When I’m out at night, lighted by the moon
I wonder “Where are you ?”
Then I’m in my car, on my way home
I know I still wanna drive to you

Sometimes I can’t find the words to say
‘Cause you always said you still liked me
Please go find somebody else to share
Anything you need, baby I don’t know what’s the deal

It’s still ringing in my head
All the words you tried to say, and I know you tried to help
But I gotta walk away
And I won’t hold you back again

When I’m out at night, lighted by the moon
I wonder what you’d do
Then I’m in my car, on my way home
I wanna drive to you
When I’m out at night, lighted by the moon
I wonder “Where are you ?”
Then I’m in my car, on my way home
I know I still wanna drive to you

I see in your eyes n
Then I don’t know why I can’t stop caring
