(DJ on the beat so it's a banger)

They in my business, they tryna treat me like a menace, they tryna turn me down
You know I'm different, I'm walkin' around with my skinnies, I'm Saint Laurent down
Sayin', "He stable," that nigga had got off the table, so we had to calm down
Come to the 'Raq with a rack, you think I'm dramatic, you niggas get shot down
Went outta town, they say I had a warrant for a murder, that shit gotta die down
I'm like ta-da, nigga had put up his work, that nigga had got down
Can't hide no body around, can't hide no thotty around, 'cause niggas gon' bail out
When he was ballin', I had to go sit out and wait on my turn before we had fell out
And I was standin' my ground, I ain't have nobody around, I'm fightin' assault
I had a deadly weapon, I had a Smith and Weston, but I got caught
I got Sam for all my cases, you know damn well he gettin' me off
Better do hair and nails, you better go pull off a scam to get me out
I done did street shit to a street nigga and there was times I ain't get caught
I had a best friend with a best friend, she a lesbian on dope
I got my gas in, I went to the Westin, I ain't go to the Trump
Keep it a buck, I was just listenin' to Gucci and Jeezy, I ain't listen to Pump
You a killer, you ride with wolves, why you tell 'em we not into it?
Park the car, they gon' jump out the door
Catch you slippin', you get a reward
And they snatchin' my people for it
Got the keys, Alicia know it
Geekin', Addy up, hittin' the 'Wood
In that 'Cat with the Drac' out the door

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Why you tellin' niggas we into it?
Why you tellin' niggas we goin' to war?
I don't even know about them boys (oh, whoa, whoa)
Nah, we ain't tryna squash no wars
We ain't tryna make peace with them boys
Niggas know what they did and they (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Whenever it's war, then you gotta move
You send in your homie, you cut on the news
And I don't even talk, I'm so confused (whoa, whoa, whoa)
You gettin' indicted from the computer
I don't even talk about no rumors
I pay rent, they're my shooters (oh, whoa, whoa)

In the trenches, you don't get a scholarship
A delivery, you sold to the cop or some'
You remember, you hop in the car with them
Chase some hoes, you know I ain't gon' bother them
On parole, on the road with my partner 'nem
You reload, reload, get outta there
He ain't got it, you know that he outta there
Inside the track, it's a red car
No cappin', I'm rappin' my ass off
Sippin' a four with my pants off, been makin' me feel like a grandpa
You can go have you a shootout, don't mean you a killer, 'cause you ain't gon' land one
Nigga be bringin' up pushin', be around bushes, I'ma go lay in one
Nigga be pussy, bringin' up shit they ain't do, that's why I don't be sayin' non'
Back in the day, with his mask and his MAC in his lap, we ain't totin' no handgun
Back in the day, with his head in his lap from the MAC, I went to Cancun
I didn't report last time I went to court, I took my last shroom
Hop on the back of the Benji, I want some candy
When you be bringin' up high speeds, you need a red key
I'm the type to hop on a flight with a warrant, you gotta catch me
I'm the type to pop me a pill with a orange juice, don't catch me

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Why you tellin' niggas we into it?
Why you tellin' niggas we goin' to war?
I don't even know about them boys (oh, whoa, whoa)
Nah, we ain't tryna squash no wars
We ain't tryna make peace with them boys
Niggas know what they did and they (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Whenever it's war, then you gotta move
You send in your homie, you cut on the news
And I don't even talk, I'm so confused (whoa, whoa, whoa)
You gettin' indicted from the computer
I don't even talk about no rumors
I pay rent, they're my shooters (oh, whoa, whoa)
