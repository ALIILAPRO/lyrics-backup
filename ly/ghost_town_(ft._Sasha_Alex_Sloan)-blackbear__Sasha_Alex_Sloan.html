		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your heart is a ghost town, my head is a nightmare
The more that I reach out, the more that you're not there
Your heart is a ghost town, my head is a nightmare
But that's where you want me, you know that it's not fair

So many people were around last year that I don't even know now
Rather lock myself inside my room and be alone now
We don't got nothing to say, you leave my love on froze now
Thanks for nothing, I don't care, your heart is like a ghost town
And all I have left is this pain
You say that you want me to stay
You keeping me running in place
I swear that you like it this way
I swear to God that

Your heart is a ghost town, my head is a nightmare
The more that I reach out, the more that you're not there
Your heart is a ghost town, my head is a nightmare
But that's where you want me, you know that it's not fair

Your heart is a ghost town, my head is a nightmare
If ever you need me, you know I'll be right there
You know I'll be right there

So many people were around last year that I don't even know now
Emotions that I thought would last forever, I don't show now
Vacant rooms and empty words are really all I know now
Thanks for nothing, you don't care, your heart is like a ghost town
And all I have left is this pain
You don't got nothing to say
You keep on running away
All that I feel is ashamed
I swear to God that

Your heart is a ghost town, my head is a nightmare
The more that I reach out, the more that you're not there
Your heart is a ghost town, my head is a nightmare
But that's where you want me, you know that it's not fair

Your heart is a ghost town, my head is a nightmare
If ever you need me, you know I'll be right there
You know I'll be right there

(Your heart is like a ghost town)
Your heart is like a ghost town
