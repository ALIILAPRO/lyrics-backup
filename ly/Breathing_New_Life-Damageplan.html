		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you feel it building 
Devastation is on the way 
Feel the hair on the back of your neck 
As the rush begins 

You can't take it away 
I earned this with sweat and blood 
You can't take it away 
Take what's mine 

Breathing new life back into me 
Challenging all the powers that be 

Can you feel it slipping 
As you lose your grip on me 
Can you face that I won in the end 
I can't keep from laughing 

You can't take it away 
I earned this with sweat and blood 
You can't take it away 
Take what's mine 

Breathing new life back into me 
Challenging all the powers that be 
Breathing new life back into me 
Challenging all the powers that be 

Don't you see it coming 
When you've caught on, it's too late 
When it hits, don't forget who I am 
Don't forget this face 

You can't take it away 
I earned this with sweat and blood 
You can't take it away 
Take what's mine 

Breathing new life back into me 
Challenging all the powers that be 
Breathing new life back into me 
Challenging all the powers that be
