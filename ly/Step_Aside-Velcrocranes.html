		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Read the sign and change the letters 
You have to hide your name 
What is that you see inside me 
cll the words I say in vain 

Step aside 
Or come inside to see what they've got 
Why are you so afraid to listen 
Step aside 
Or come inside to see what we've got 
Why are you so afraid of what you're not 

Different paths from different places 
The choice that you can't deny 
But you will never have my hatred 
No matter how hard you try

Step aside 
Or come inside to see what they've got 
Why are you so afraid to listen 
Step aside 
Or come inside to see what we've got 
Why are you so afraid of what you're not

Step aside 
Or come inside to see what they've got 
Why are you so afraid to listen 
Step aside 
Or come inside to see what we've got 
Why are you so afraid of what you're not

Step aside 
Or come inside to see what they've got 
Why are you so afraid to listen 
Step aside 
Or come inside to see what we've got 
Why are you so afraid of what you're not

Step aside 
Or come inside to see what they've got 
Why are you so afraid to listen 
Step aside 
Or come inside to see what we've got 
Why are you so afraid of what you're not
Why are you so afraid of what you're not
Why are you so afraid of what you're not
Why are you so afraid of what you're not
