		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, they call me the voodoo woman
And I know the reason why
Oh, they call me the voodoo woman
Oh, and I know the reason why
Oh, if I raise up my hands now
Don’t you know the sky begins to cry down

Oh, they call me the voodoo woman
I look through water and I spot dry land
Oh, they call me the voodoo woman
I look through water and I spot dry land

And I’m gonna tell all you men out there
If your woman’s got some other man
Honey you better hope she doesn’t

Gotta rabbit foot in my pocket, toad frog in my shoes
A crawdaddy on my shoulder looking dead at you
I got dust from a rattlesnake and a black spider bone
If that don’t do it baby you better leave this girl alone

They call me the voodoo woman
Lord I know the reason why
Oh, if I raise up my hand
Doesn't know the sky begins to cry down
Look right down

Gotta rabbit foot in my pocket, toad frog in my shoes
A crawdaddy on my shoulder looking right at you
I got dust from a rattlesnake and a black spider bone
If that don’t do it baby you better leave this girl alone

They call me the voodoo woman
Oh, I know the reason why
Oh, if I raise up my hand
Doesn't know the sky begins to cry down
Look right

Oh, they call me the voodoo woman
I look through water and I spot dry land
Oh, they call me the voodoo woman
I look through water and I spot dry land

And I’m gonna tell all you men out there
If your woman’s got another man
