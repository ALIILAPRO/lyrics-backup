		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come along with me
To my little corner of the world
Dream a little dream
In my little corner of the world
You'll soon forget
That there's any other place
Tonight, my love
We'll share a sweet embrace
And if you care to stay
In my little corner of the world
We'll ride away
In my little corner of the world
I always knew that I'd find someone like you
So hop o'er to my little corner of the world

And if you care to stay
In our little corner of the world
We could hide away
In our little corner of the world
We always knew that we'd find someone like you
So hop o'er to our little corner of the world
