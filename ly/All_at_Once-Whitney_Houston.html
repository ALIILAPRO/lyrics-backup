		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All at once 
I finally took a moment 
And I'm realizing that 
You're not coming back 
And it's finally hit me all at once 
All at once I've started counting teardrops 
And at least a million fell 
My eyes began to swell 
And all my dreams were shattered all at once 

Ever since I met you 
You're the only love I've known 
And I can't forget you 
Though I must face it all alone 

All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea 
Wishing you'd come back to me 
And that's all that matters now 
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea 
Holding on to memories 
And it's hurt me more than you know 
So much more than it shows 
All at once 

All at once I looked around and found that you were 
With another love 
In someone else's arms 
And all my dreams were shattered all at once 
All at once the smile that used to greet me 
Brightened someone else's day 
She took your smile away 
And left me with just memories all at once 

Ever since I met you 
You're the only love I've known 
And I can't forget you 
Though I must face it all alone 

All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea 
Wishing you'd come back to me 
And that's all that matters now 
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea 
Holding on to memories 
And it's hurt me more than you know 
So much more than it shows 
All at once 

All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea 
Wishing you'd come back to me 
And it's hurt me more than you know 
So much more than it shows 
All at once
And that's all that matters now 
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea 
Wishing you'd come back to me 
And it's hurt me more than you know 
So much more
