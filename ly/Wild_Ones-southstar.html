		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Party rocker
More Chambull, number one-
Party rocker
More Chambull, number one-
Party rocker
More Chambull, number one-
Party rocker
More Chambull, number one-

I am a wild one, break me in
Saddle me up and let's begin
I am a wild one, tame me now
Running with wolves and I'm on the prowl

Hey, I heard you were a wild one
Ooh, ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club
With you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones, wild ones, wild ones
Ooh, ooh

Hey, I heard you were a wild one
Ooh, ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club
With you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones, wild ones, wild ones
Ooh, ooh

Party rocker, fa' sho' stopper
More Chambull, number one club popper
Got a hangover like too much vodka
Can't see me with ten binoculars
So cool, no doubt by the end of the night
Got the clothes comin' off then I make that move
Somehow, some way, gotta raise the roof, roof
All black shades when the sun come through
Uh-oh, it's on like everything goes
Wild out, baby, 'til the freak, it shows
What happens to that body is a private show
Stays right here, pri-private show
I like 'em untamed, I'm talkin' high pain
Tolerance, bottoms up with the champagne
My life, call my homie then we hit Spain

I am a wild one, break me in (yeah)
Saddle me up and let's begin (yeah)
I am a wild one, tame me now (ah)
Running with wolves and I'm on the prowl

Show you another side of me
A side you would never thought you would see
Tear up that body, dominate you 'til you've had enough
I hear you like the wild stuff

Hey, I heard you were a wild one
Ooh, ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club
With you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones, wild ones, wild ones
Ooh, ooh
