		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every time I see you and I look into your eyes
There's a feeling that I get
And it's way down deep inside, girl
I've been trying to hold on, but you say that you're not sure
I just hope you realize what my heart is going through

How long, must this feeling go on
How long, must I stand the pain and
How long, must this feeling go on
Waiting for the night
Waiting for the right time to come

I know all about the hurt and the problems in the past
I know why your scared of love,
'Cause you think it just wont last long
Well, I'm here to tell you what I'm saying is all true
There ain't nobody else in life
That can take the place of you

How long, must this feeling go on
How long, must I stand the pain and
How long, must this feeling go on
waiting for the night
Waiting for the right time to run

Why can't we just run away, and oh run
A place were we can be alone and nobody finds us, run
Can we both just run away, and oh run
Girl I can't wait to have you

How long, must this feeling go on
How long, must I stand the pain and
How long, must this feeling go on
Waiting for the night
Waiting for the right time to come, to come
