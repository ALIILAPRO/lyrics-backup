		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You think that something's happening
And it's bigger than your life

But it's only what you're hearing
Will you s'Till remember
When the morning light has come
Wil the songs be playing over and over
'Till you do it all over again

Play, play the game tonight
Can you tell me if it's wrong or right
Is it worth the time, is it worth the price
Do you see yourself in the white spotlight
Then play the game tonight

And when the curtains open
To the roaring of the crowd
You will feel it all around you
Then it finally happens
And it's all come true for you
And the songs are playing over and over
'Till they do it all over again

Play, play the game tonight
Can you tell me if it's wrong or right
Is it worth the time, is it worth the price
Do you see yourself in the white spotlight
Then play the game tonight

Tonight
Play the game tonight
Can you tell me if it's wrong or right
Is it worth the time, is it worth the price
Do you see yourself in the bright light
Play the game tonight
Can you tell me if it's wrong or right
Is it worth the time, is it worth the price
Do you see yourself in the white spotlight (play the game tonight)
Play the game tonight
