		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hear a voice in my mind
I know her face by heart
heaven and earth are moving in my soul
I don't know where to start
tell me, tell me, the words to define
the way I feel about someone so fine
how do you talk to an angel
how do you hold her close to where you are
how do you talk to an angel
it's like trying to catch a falling star
at night i dream that she is there
and I can feel her in the air
tell me, tell me, the words to define
the way I feel about someone so fine
how do you talk to an angel
how do you hold her close to where you are
how do you talk to an angel
it's like trying to catch a falling star
how do you talk to an angel
how do you hold her close to where you are
how do you talk to an angel
it's like trying to catch a falling star
how do you talk to an angel
how do you hold her close to where you are
how do you talk to an angel
it's like trying to catch a falling star
yeah, yeah
