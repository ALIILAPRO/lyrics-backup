		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I'd know better, better
No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I'd know better, better

The hardest part this troubled heart
Has never yet been through now
Was heal the scars that got their start
Inside someone like you now

For had I known or I'd been shown
Back when how long it'd take me
To break the charms that brought me harm
And all that would erase me

I never would or thought I could
No matter what you'd pay me
Replay the part, you stole my heart
I should have known you're crazy

If all I knew was that with you
I'd want someone to save me
It'd be enough, but just my luck
I fell in love and maybe

All that I wanted was
Now I know you better
You know, I know better
Now I know you better

So bittersweet, this tragedy
Won't ask for absolution
This melody inside of me
Still searches for solution

A twist of fate, a change of heart
Cures my infatuation
I'm a broken heart, provides the spark
For my determination

No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I'd know better, better
Oh, no one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I'd know better, better

All that I wanted was
Now I know you better
You know, I know better
Now I know you better

I never wanted you to be so full of anger (anger)
I never wanted you to be somebody else
I never wanted you to be someone afraid to know themselves
I only wanted you to see things for yourself

All that I wanted was
Now I know you better
Now we all know better
All that I wanted was

No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

If I were you I'd manage to
Avoid the invitation
Of promised love that can't keep up
With your adoration

Just use your head and in the end
You'll find your inspiration
To choose your steps and won't regret
This kind of aggravation

No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I'd know better, better
No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I'd know better, better
