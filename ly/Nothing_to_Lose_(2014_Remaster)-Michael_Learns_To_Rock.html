		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There are times 
When you make me laugh 
There are moments when you drive me mad 
There are seconds when 
I see the light 
Though many times you made me cry 

There's something 
You don't understand 
I want to be your man 

[Chorus] 

Nothing to lose 
Your love to win 
Hoping so bad 
That you'll love me in 
I'm at your feet 
Waiting for you 
I've got time 
And nothing to lose 

There are times 
When I believe in you 
These moments when I feel close to you 
There are times I think 
That I am yours 
Though many times I feel unsure 

There's something 
You don't understand 
I want to be your man

[Chorus] 

Nothing to lose 
Your love to win 
Hoping so bad 
That you'll let me in 
I'm on your feet 
Waiting for you 
I've got time 
And nothing to lose 

I'll always be around you 
Keep an eye on you 
And I won't let you run 
'Cause you are the only one 

[Chorus] 

Nothing to lose 
Your love to win 
Hoping so bad 
That you'll let me in 
I'm at your feet 
Waiting for you 
I've got time 
And nothing to lose
