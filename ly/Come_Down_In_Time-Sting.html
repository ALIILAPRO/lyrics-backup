		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the quiet silent seconds 
I turned off the light switch
And I came down to meet you 
In the half light the moon left
While a cluster of night jars 
Sang some songs out of tune
A mantle of bright light s
Shone down from a room

Come down in time I still hear her say
So clear in my ear like it was today
Come down in time was the message she gave to me
Come down in time and I'll meet you half way

Well I don't know if I should have heard her as yet
But a true love like hers is a hard love to get
And I've walked most all the way and I ain't heard her call
And I'm getting to thinking if she's coming at all

Come down in time I still hear her say
So clear in my ear like it was today
Come down in time was the message she gave to me
Come down in time and I'll meet you half way

There are women and women and some hold you tight
While some leave you counting the stars in the night
