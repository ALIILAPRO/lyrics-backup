		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You live so much, it's like you're dying 
You can't give up, your body's trying 
You build so tall it's like you're flying 
But rocks will fall, the sky keeps climbing 

You're gonna lose everything (x4)
How does it feel 
How does it feel 

I'm not scared so much of trying 
But don't look up you might start flying 

You're gonna lose everything (x6)
How does it feel 
How does it feel 

Oh know 

I want to know 
I want to know 
How does it feel 
Oh, how does it feel

You're gonna lose everything
You're gonna lose everything 
How does it feel 
Oh, how does it feel 

You live so much, its like you're dying 
You can't give up, your body's trying 
Oh you build so tall, its like you're flying 
But rocks will fall, the sky keeps climbing
