		  What About Love
Lyrics & Melodies: Leif Ehlin Music: Leif Ehlin, Kent Hilli, Rolf Nordström, Fredrik Forsberg, Mats Byström)

You know that I 
I've been longing to scream out your name 
I wish that i
I'm wishing you could feel the same
Time after time
I had to stop myself from falling 
Walking a line 
a line so far from me

Every part of me
Is crying out in silence 
Something so clear to me 
That no one else can see

What about love
What about honesty
What about life consuming pain that burns in me 
What about love
Just to be true to me
For better or for worse
My love is free
Oooohmy love is free, yeah

I Can't deny
I would love to show you my friends
But i'd rather die
Then cause you pain in any sense
but Time after time
I had to see behind the rainbow
love can survive
If only you could feel

Every part of me
Is crying out in silence 
Something so clear to me 
That no one else can see

What about love 
What about honesty
What about life consuming pain that burns in me 
What about love
truth is my destiny
For better or for worse
My love is free.

What about love 
What about honesty

What about love
What about honesty
What about life consuming pain that burns in me 
What about love
Just to be true to me
For better or for worse
My love is free
Oooohmy love is free, yeah 
Oooohmy love is free
