		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Either you're bluffin' or you just don't care
You could be bluffin' or I could mean nothin' at all
You're mad at somethin' or there's nothing there
Maybe there's nothing there
Either you're bluffin' or just don't care(You don't care)
You're mad at somethin' or there's nothing there
Yeah

Lately I don't feel the same
I ain't your baby father
I ain't your one and only
But you love to scream my name
And I done taught you things
In exchange for constant pain (you don't care)
You led me on
On and on and on

Either you're bluffin' or you just don't care
You could be bluffin' or I could mean nothin' at all
You're mad at somethin' or there's nothing there
(Maybe) Maybe there's nothing there (Yeah)
Either you're bluffin' or you just don't care
(You don't care)
You're mad at somethin' or there's nothing there

All he do is beat you down
But you stick around (you don't care)
I bet he won't be actin' so hard if I was there (nothing there)
I know you get lonely
And I know you don't know me (you don't care)
That don't mean that this won't ever go nowhere
And I call your bluff

Either you're bluffin' or just don't care (don't care)
You could be bluffin' or I could mean nothin' at all
You're mad at somethin' or there's nothing there
Maybe there's nothing there 
Either you're bluffin' or you just don't care
(You don't care)
You're mad at somethin' or there's nothing there

(Maybe there's nothing there) 
Maybe, you just don't care (you don't care)
Or there ain't nothin' (nothin' at all)

(Maybe there's nothing there) 
Maybe, you just don't care (you don't care)
Or there ain't nothin' (nothin' at all)

Either you're bluffin' or you just don't care
You could be bluffin' or I could mean nothin' at all
You're mad at somethin' or there's nothing there
Maybe there's nothing there
Either you're bluffin' or you just don't care
(You don't care)
You're mad at somethin' or there's nothing there
