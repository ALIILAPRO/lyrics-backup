		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Want you to know
That I could go anytime
I want you to know

Gave me her lips
Gave me her perfect hips
And I slow down
I slow down in love

Once I rise inside

CHORUS:
Once she would hold me
She was my only
Only true love
Once she had told me
That I'm holy
Only so long

She'll stay all night
She'll be so quiet
And she won't laugh at my jokes

Once I rise inside
