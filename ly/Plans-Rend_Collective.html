		  Plans for me
Plans

I'm a blank page, you're the author
I'm the canvas, You're the painter, oh
My story isn't over
From the heartbreak, from the hurting
Lord, I know that You're moving, oh, oh
Come and do a new thing

When I haven't seen the answer to my prayer
Lord, I still believe there's a miracle to spare

You got plans for me
You got plans for me
Greater than my wildest dreams
Stronger than the enemy
You got plans for me
You got plans for me
Even in my worst defeat
Will You give me faith to see
You got plans for me
Plans for me

Looking back on all my failings
All the endings were beginnings, oh, oh
You were always working

If I lose my way and all my strength is gone
Lord, I still believe there are better days to come

You got plans for me
You got plans for me
Greater than my wildest dreams
Stronger than the enemy
You got plans for me
You got plans for me
Even in my worst defeat
Will You give me faith to see
You got plans for me
Plans for me

When I haven't seen the answer to my prayer
Lord, I still believe there's a miracle to spare

Your promises are (yes and amen)
Your purposes are (yes and amen)
Your people crying (yes and amen)
Your praise is rising (yes and amen)
Your promises are (yes and amen)
Your purposes are (yes and amen)
Your people crying (yes and amen)
Your praise is rising

You got plans for me, oh yeah
You got plans for me
Greater than my wildest dreams
Stronger than the enemy
You got plans for me

Oh yeah, You got plans for me
Even in my worst defeat
Will you give me faith to see
You got plans for me
Plans for me
Plans for me, whoa, oh

You got plans for me
Plans for me
Plans for me, whoa, oh
