		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tonight is falling away home, gone away.
Tonight is falling away, starlight is fading into daylight.
Today into daylight.
Your freedom is founded, but at what a price to pay
Your lover is hushed and she is torn away.
Freedom is founded, but at what at a price to pay.
And here it is- one step following the other step, walking along down the avenue of the americas.
Two eyes and a head following two arms and legs that are diggin a snow angel in th air.
Two steps my footsteps stepping between the shattered sunlight that is coming between the buildings
Brown moth- a brown moth.

Tonight is falling away, starlight is fading into daylight today.
And your freedom is found- but at what a price to pay.
Your lover, she is hushed and she is torn away.
Walking along on down the avenue of americas my footsteps- two eyes and a head 
My footsteps stepping between the shattered sunlight that is coming between the buildings
Walking along on down the avenue of the americas
My footsteps stepping between the shattered sunlight that is coming between the buildings
Again today and pasiing wind carrying slowly, there came about me, when I saw the sun, when I saw the building cloud above me.
Gray.
Smoke gray.

There is something about here- where we have sound, where sound is understood.
A tree cut down, fell in the amazon
Expose bank. forest. expose bank impenetrable, so many shoulders and in our heads, simillarly unkind bent out of shape my life.

walking along on down the avenue of americas my footsteps- two eyes and a head following my two arms and legs digging at the snow angel in the air.
Expose bank eroded in cyclet rivulet.
Tonight it is. starlight is fading to day light today to daylight
Your freedom is found, its a beautiful sight, but at what price to pay.

lalallaa

your lover, she is hushed and she is torn away.
