		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I heard (I heard) that you want to be closer to me
I heard (I heard) that you said you've seen me in your dreams
He said she said you like the way I smile
He said she said you like my confidence and style
He said she said you want to hold my hand and more
And more

All these rumors spreading around
And I kinda like the way they sound
All these rumors 'bout you and me
How can we make this a reality? Oh

He said she said your body's a temple
And I think I pray just for the sight of you
Do you think you'd let me see inside of you? (Inside of you)
I've been sinking, let me just confide in you

He said she said you like the way I smile
He said she said you like my confidence and style (I like your confidence and style)
He said she said you want to hold my hand and more
And more

All these rumors spreading around (spreading around)
And I kinda like the way they sound
All these rumors 'bout you and me (you and me)
How can we make this a reality? Oh

He said she said, mm
He said she said, she said

I like what I'm hearing, so my attention, you get tonight
If you're half as good as you say you are, let's stop wasting time
Now, we can keep talking through everybody that's in this room
Or we can come face to face, and find out if it's true

All these rumors spreading around (spreading around)
And I kinda like the way they sound (the way they sound)
All these rumors 'bout you and me (you and me)
How can we make this a reality? Oh

He said she said
He said she said
He said she said
