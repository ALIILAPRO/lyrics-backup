		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm walkin' down the street, shufflin' my feet
Whistlin' a feel good song
Got the sun on my face, nothin' in my way
So I keep rockin' along

I'm just doing my thing, just doin' my thing
Just floatin' on a breeze
I'm just doing my thing, just doin' my thing
Don't worry 'bout me

The people downtown, are hustlin' around
The weight of the world on their mind
Me, I'm sittin' in the shade, soakin' up the day
Watchin' 'em all roll by

I'm just doing my thing, just doin' my thing
Just floatin' on a breeze
I'm just doing my thing, just doin' my thing
Don't worry 'bout me

Don't you worry!

I like it laid back, like a baby blue Cadillac
Easing on down the road
I like it nice and slow, layin' low
Rollin' anywhere that the wind wanna blow

I'm just doing my thing, just doin' my thing
Just floatin' on a breeze
I'm just doing my thing, just doin' my thing
Don't worry 'bout me

Hey, hey

I'm just doing my thing, just doin' my thing
Just floatin' on a breeze
I'm just doing my thing, just doin' my thing
Don't worry 'bout me

Don't you worry
(I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing)
(Just floatin' on a breeze)
I'm just doin' my thing
(I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing)
(Don't worry 'bout me)
Come on,
(I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing)
(Just floatin' on a breeze)
(I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing)
(Don't worry 'bout me)
