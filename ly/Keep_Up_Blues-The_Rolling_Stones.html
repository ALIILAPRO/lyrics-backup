		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got a new suit, kind of Italian style
It's got a low-cut collar, kind of carved behind
Stitched in the waist and it's real tight in the butt, that's right
You better watch out, baby, see me strut my stuff

Yeah, come on

Yeah my shirt's made in England and my shoes in Rome
You know I'm coming, smell my cologne
You've got to keep up, baby, keep up with the times, yeah, you better
Well, better watch out, you'll be left lagging far behind

Oh yeah
Keep up, baby, keep up

I've got a new apartment, the view's sublime
Sit on my sofa and let's pass some time
The roof is leaking, oh the rent is high, yes it is
I've got to keep up, baby, keep up with the times

Yeah, you've got to keep up now, keep up
Yeah

I, I've got a new actress, she ain't been in much
Except for filling a cocktail bar
But said she got a break, she got a starring part, in a movie
If I don't watch out, I'll be pushing a shopping cart, that'll be me

You've got to keep up, baby, keep up, baby
Keep up, baby, keep up with the times, yeah
That's right, keep up with the times
Well if you don't watch out, you'll be left lagging far behind
All right
