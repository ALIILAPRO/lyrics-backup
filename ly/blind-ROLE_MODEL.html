		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She got the gold hoops, Prada fit
I'm in love with all of it
Ex-boy didn't get the picture
Cut him out of it
I fall pretty hard
Never really getting far
You make everyone
Look like they aren't anyone

I haven't felt a thing this year
And I'm only tryna be sincere

Yeah, I've never seen
Something quite like you
I've never seen
Something quite like you
I try to look away
But something's in the way
I think I'm going blind
I hope it doesn't change
'Cause I've never seen
Something quite like you

But you're a little like me, same type
Cancels every date night
Stays home, never leaves
Just can't find the energy
I stay pretty numb
Never fell for anyone
You seem similar
Always end up getting hurt

I haven't felt a thing this year
And I'm only tryna be sincere

Yeah, I've never seen
Something quite like you
I've never seen
Something quite like you
I try to look away
But something's in the way
I think I'm going blind
I hope it doesn't change
'Cause I've never seen
Something quite like you

And you're not one for conversation
Always running out of patience
I'd like to think that we're the same
I don't even know your name
All I'm really tryna say is

I've never seen
Something quite like you
And I've never seen
Something quite like you
I try to look away
But something's in the way
I think I'm going blind
I hope it doesn't change
'Cause I've never seen
Something quite like you
