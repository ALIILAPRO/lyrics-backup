		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh joy love you bring
Oh joy make my heart sing

And I drove across the desert
I was in my four wheel drive
I was looking for the Buddha
And I saw Jesus Christ

He smiled and shrugged his shoulder
And lit a cigarette
Said jump for joy
Make some noise
Remember what I said

My soul is a like a ruby
And I threw it in the earth
But now my hands are bleeding
From scrabbling in the dirt
And I look up to the heavens
And a light is on my face
I never never never
Thought I'd find a state of grace

Hey joy
Love you bring
Oh joy
Make my heart sing
Oh joy
Joy in everything

Joy joy joy oh joy
Joy joy joy oh joy

I was drowning in the darkness
As I drove down to the sea

Joy joy joy oh joy

And I looked up to the mountain
And the light burst over me
Joy joy joy oh oh joy

You make me sing
Joy [cont]

Oh joy
The love you bring
You make me sing
Oh joy
In everything
In everything
Everything

Jump for joy
Jump for joy
Jump for joy
