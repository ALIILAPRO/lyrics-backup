		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You could read a million pages, know the words and all the phrases
You could try to turn a lie into the truth
You can live to be a hundred, memorizin' every number
You could even put a man on the moon
And the science of the heart is sometimes lost on me
But I'm following this feeling!

I don't know why, it's so hard to swallow our pride!
And I don't know how many wrongs make a right
I don't know the reason
Sometimes it just feels so, good to cry!
And I don't know which way the wind will blow
But You're here with me
And that's All I Need To Know!

There's a moment in the morning, when I feel the most alone
But then I hear Your voice, whispering my name
It's like a wave of understanding and I never could of planned it
When the questions, and doubts all fade away

I don't know why, it's so hard to swallow our pride!
And I don't know how many wrongs make a right
I don't know the reason
Sometimes it just feels so, good to cry!
And I don't know which way the wind will blow
But You're here with me
And that's All I Need To Know!

I figured it out, You turned me around at the speed of light
All that ever, needed to know was in your eyes

I don't know why, it's so hard to swallow our pride
And I never killed all the stars in the sky
I don't know the reason
Sometimes it just feels so, good to cry!
And I don't know which way the wind will blow
But you're here with me
And that's All I Need To Know!

That's all I need to know!
That's all I need to know
All I need to know!
