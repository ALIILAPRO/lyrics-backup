		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll be honest, I wasn't devastated
But you could've held my hands through this, baby
Let my mind run underneath warm jets
I run my hands through what's left
But we're getting older, baby
Don't have much longer, baby
Why am I preaching
To this choir, to this atheist?
Just like mine, versions of these belong to you
After a while
They're keeping me close to you

(Just like me, they long to be)
(Close to you)
