		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah, ay

I miss my cocoa butter kisses, hope you smile when you listen
Ain't no competition, just competin' for attention
And you're like, "I'm not on no games"
Well, baby I been peepin' and you ain't been the same
Who been on your mind, babe? Who got your time, babe?
Who you been vibin' wit' and why I can't make you mine, babe?
Used to be texting me, checking me, calling me your slime, babe
And now you treat me like my worth less than a dime, babe, ay

If we paint a perfect picture 
We can make it last forever, oh yeah
Singing love songs, love songs
Singing love songs, love songs
Ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay (ay)

Double cupped, but bae I'm leaning on you
You been playing games, I'm tryna make you my boo
I don't duck no action, you buss one and I buss two
Pills of satisfaction, I take the red, you pop the blue

Singing love songs
Why you got me singing all these fucking love songs?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
Like whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, ay

Love songs, yeah
Singing love songs oh yeah
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, yeah, ay
I'm on fire, ay
