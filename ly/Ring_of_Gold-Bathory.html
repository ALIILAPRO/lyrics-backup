		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Silver, the moon high over pond of water calm and dark
Woe, mist, the breath of the dragon, sweeping down mountain side
All still, the day asleep, the sun rests in nest of the Gods
Afar high adventures await me, I hear my brothers calling

Spring is here and the ice breaks free
The endless sky and open sea
I will sail where the Raven will lead me
Fly on black wings, high and free
I shall return with the wind the day
From high adventures, swelling sail
Autumn red comes to Asa bay

Meet me by the well where the water, crystal clear, flows free
From deep within the great mountain towering to the sky
I will be awaiting you coming down treading the trails of clues
Bare feet, let your hair down like the mist across the pond

In dawn of time, before gods and man
When earth and shy was first divided
A star did fall into river deep
A star of gold into silvery water
While I sail, by this you shall remember me
Wear it, yours forever to deep
To bind us beyond end of time, to thee I give a ring of gold
