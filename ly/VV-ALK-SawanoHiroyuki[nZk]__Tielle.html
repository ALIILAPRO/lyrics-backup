		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  この手で触れた希望
外れた幼い足の音
階段に響く鼓動 理想にもたれて
消えそうな光を映した
指導者が唱えても
僕の位置からズレて
記憶の周りで遊んでる
例えなど数えても
逃げてしまう焦りのよう
取り替えれない昨日たち ここから
WALK
She's calling a timeout to say
"I won't hurry no more,
no matter how they think
about me"
WALK
You never have to be framed
There's no limit to go
Counting every step you take
(Wow) I won't hurry no more,
no matter how they think
'bout me
(Wow) There's no limit to go
Let me walk the right way
We never know the truth of lies
Everyone makes
it a rule of white lies
Is that for me or for you
to keep from hurting our prides?
If we could rid ourselves
from vanities
They pushed me out,
then knocked me out
But smiled as if
nothing was done
We did not see eye to eye
Their point of view
is nothing new
We've been completely
poles apart
And had no time to rewind
But who minds?
WALK
She's calling a timeout to say
"I won't hurry no more,
no matter how they think
about me"
WALK
You never have to be framed
There's no limit to go
Counting every step you take
(Wow) I won't hurry no more,
no matter how they think
'bout me
(Wow) There's no limit to go
Let me walk the right way
So let me walk on,
or I'll slip through your hands
I won't hurry no more,
no matter how they think
'bout me
Don't let me look back,
I'm looking straight ahead
There's no limit to go
We ain't going the same way
WALK
She's calling a timeout to say
"I won't hurry no more,
no matter how they think
about me"
WALK
You never have to be framed
There's no limit to go
Counting every step you take
(Wow) I won't hurry no more,
no matter how they think
'bout me
(Wow) There's no limit to go
Let me walk the right way
