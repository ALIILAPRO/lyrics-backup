		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I-I-I-I thought I knew you
I-I-I-I guess I didn't
I-I-I-I thought I knew you
But baby I guess I didn't
I-I-I thought you was down for real
Thought you would stick around for real
I-I-I-I-I
I-I ah

Misconstrued your love (misconstrued your love)
You confused my love (my love)
You givin' up (up)
On love (on love)
Not to lose my love (not to lose my love)
Yeah

Honestly I think this shit excites you
You love drama, it excites you
I-I liked you
I-I-I-I don't think I'm talking to the right you

I-I-I-I thought I knew you (thought I knew you)
I-I-I-I guess I didn't
I-I-I-I thought I knew you
But baby I guess I didn't
I-I-I thought you was down for real (down for real)
Thought you would stick around for real ('round for real)
I-I-I-I-I
I-I ah

Tell me why you let me come inside for real
Never mind, you were never mine for real
Hit my line, I'ma hit decline for real
I ain't trying for a second time for real
Honestly I think this shit excites you
All that drama that you're tied to (oh yeah)
You play the victim every time too
That shit came back and hit you times two

I-I-I-I thought I knew you (thought I knew ya baby)
I-I-I-I guess I didn't (guess I didn't)
I-I-I-I thought I knew you (oh yeah)
But baby I guess I didn't
I-I-I thought you was down for real (down for real)
Thought you would stick around for real ('round for real)
I-I-I-I-I
I-I ah

You broke my heart and now ever since
I just want them dead presidents
I just want them dead presidents
I just want them dead presidents
You broke my heart nigga ever since
I just want them dead presidents
I just want them dead presidents
Yeah, I just want them dead presidents
Dead-dead presidents
Presidents-dents, them presidents
Presidents-dents, them presidents
Presidents-dents, them presidents
Presidents-dents, them presidents
