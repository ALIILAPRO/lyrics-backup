		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ,It's a snake around my lizard brain
Gonna take me off the tracks
Gets me terrified, pouring out your bitches' brew
I'm g-g-g-g-gonna have a heart attack
You got one hand in my pocket
(You got) uh, one hand on my throat
You wanna keep me locked in, death throes

Then every rattle I make is just to let you know
That's how you'll hear me coming
That's how you'll feel me coming

In my tomb, tell me what you're gonna do
(Write your name in my doomsday book, yeah)
It's my rules and I'm never gonna lose
It's my rules, it's my rules
(Write your name in my doomsday book, yeah)
(Keep my finger on the trigger)
(Sugar, I can smell you coming from a mile away, yeah)

It's a snake around my lizard brain
Gonna tip me off the edge (gonna tip me off the edge)
Did you dare escape, did you think that I'd be afraid
I'd p-p-piss on that if the colors bled

The lord gon' forgive me
'Cause he know my killings is so righteous, baby
(Huh)
So off with my head, sucka
It doesn't matter, my ghost got the venom

Then every rattle I make is just to let you know
That's how you'll hear me coming
That's how you'll feel me coming

In my tomb, tell me what you're gonna do
(Write your name in my doomsday book, yeah)
It's my rules and I'm never gonna lose
It's my rules, it's my rules
(Write your name in my doomsday book, yeah)
(Keep my finger on the trigger)
(Sugar, I can smell you coming from a mile away, yeah, yeah)

You're gonna rattle now
Tell me what you, tell me what you're gonna do
So I'll surrender
So I'll surrender 

The lord gon' forgive me
'Cause he know my killings is (so righteous, baby)
(Huh)
So off with my head, sucka
It doesn't matter, my ghost got the venom (venom)

Then every rattle I make is just to let you know
That's how you'll hear me coming
That's how you'll feel me coming

In my tomb, tell me what you're gonna do
(Write your name in my doomsday book, yeah)
Baby, when you think it's better
It stings so bad, yeah
I think that I'm gonna
Pouring out your bitches' brew
I'm g-g-g-g-gonna have a heart attack
That's how you'll feel me coming
Pouring out your bitches' brew
I'm g-g-g-g-gonna have a heart attack
That's how you'll hear me coming
That's how you'll feel me coming
That's how you'll feel me coming
That's how you'll feel me coming
That's how you'll feel me coming
That's how you'll feel me coming
That's how you'll feel me coming
That's how you'll feel me coming
That's how you'll feel me coming
