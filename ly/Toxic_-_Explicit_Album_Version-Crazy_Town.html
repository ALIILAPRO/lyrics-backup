		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Catch a fire, fire it up
Corrupt stirring it up

It's burning hot, drifting
Hitting every slot
With a drop kick ,

It's toxic
Trouble, like your girl in a mosh pit
I've lost it
And that the only way that we rock shit
Banging heads and ripping threads
If I wasn't rocking shows
I'd be better of dead

With a one two
One word can destroy your whole crew
And that's toxic

[Chorus]
Toxic, loud and obnoxious
Crazy town's toxic
With that, rock your block shit
Toxic, popping more lip
We love to talk shit
Rocking you block with that
Straight out the block shit
Toxic

A budda, blastic
Blacklisted. twisted of faith
My vocal's fatal
As naughty v block concoctions
Rock your cradle
I thought I wait 'til the timing was right
To ignite
'Cause people like me
We only come out at night
I rock the main line
And party with fine bitches
Which is a dirty job
But somebody's got to do it

So, who the crew with?
More has than vivid
Lyrics explicit
So fuck the critics
We leave them hanging
Like INXS.

[Chorus]

Toxic thresholds of
Colombian gold
You can't roll how we roll
We possess you soul
And push the panic

Is it godly or satanic?
Toxic or organic?
Manic minds refined or frantic
Just the way we planned it

See. we be stomping around the planet
And we stand alone
We inflitrate your chromosomes
No clone
Our DNA has got a strain
Of it's own and it's toxic

[Chorus]
