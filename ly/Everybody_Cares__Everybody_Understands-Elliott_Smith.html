		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody cares, everybody understands
Yes everybody cares about you
Yeah and whether or not you want them to
It's a chemical embrace that kicks you in the head
To a pure synthetic sympathy that infuriates you totally
And a quiet lie that makes you want to scream and shout
So here I lay dreaming looking at the brilliant sun
Raining it's guiding light upon everyone

For a moment's rest you can lean against the banister
After running upstairs again and again 
From wherever they came to fix you in 
But always fear the city's finest follow right behind
You got a pretty vision in your head
A pencil full of poison lead
And a sickened smile illegal in every town
So here I lay dreaming looking at the brilliant sun
Raining its guiding light upon everyone
Here I lay dreaming looking at the brilliant sun
Raining its guiding light upon everyone
You say you mean well, you don't know what you mean
Fucking ought to stay the hell away from things you know nothing about
