		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don’t wanna watch you dance
Unless you in versace, gucci or vuitton
My friends are Ben, George, Thomas and thats all
When I walk in, I take anything I want
Oui
I can never see me fall
Unless I’m in versace, gucci or vuitton
My friends are Ben, George, Thomas and thats all
When I walk in, I take anything I want
Oui
Yeah
When I walk in I take everything, I pillage and I steal
You and me know what I act like
If you see me talk to 12 you know I’m lying through my teeth
I put a ring on the cash life
Bags full of cheese
Cheese in the bank
Dash when I speed
Leave with my cash
Thinks she knows me
But she dont know shit
As long as she is with me, then she can believe what she pleases yeah
Bags full of cheese
Cheese in the bank
Dash when I speed
Leave with my cash
Thinks she knows me
But she dont know shit
As long as she is with me, then she can believe what she pleases
I don’t wanna watch you dance
Unless you in versace, gucci or vuitton
My friends are Ben, George, Thomas and thats all
When I walk in, I take anything I want
Oui
I can never see me fall
Unless I’m in versace, gucci or vuitton
My friends are Ben, George, Thomas and thats all
When I walk in, I take anything I want
