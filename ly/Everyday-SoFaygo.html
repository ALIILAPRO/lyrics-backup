		  Woohoo
(Ayy, Woods, light that shit up)
Yeah, woo

Trapped in a box, feel like I can't breathe (woah)
These niggas my sons, it ain't hard to see
Striped like a viper, I really got snipers 
They up in the cut and they hit shit for me
Y'all niggas makin' this shit way too difficult 
Foot on the pedal, lil' bitch, I am speedin'
Like what should we call it now? 
Why is the shit that we built not holdin' together?
Make my shooter hunt you down, all it's gon' take is one slip 
Make 'em float like a feather (ayy, ayy, yeah, yeah)
Some things just harder to say (yeah, woo-hoo)
I'm with my gang every day (woo-hoo)
These hoes get wet like the Bay (yeah)

They wanna stay by my side 'cause they know I could get rich any day (okay)
I tell that ho to slide and put all the feelings away (okay)
You feel like suicide is the only way you can escape (okay)
You gonna see better days, I promise it's gon' be okay (go, go)
I know these niggas gon' hate so I got guns on me, all out of state (woo-hoo)
She wanna know what the vibe is 'cause she don't got nowhere to stay
Wanna pull up with the top down, wanna pull up in a wraith (ayy, ayy, yeah)
I'ma cross up with your bae (yeah), I told her she get one day (okay)

(Ayy, yeah, yeah)
Trapped in a box, feel like I can't breathe (woah)
These niggas my sons, it ain't hard to see
Striped like a viper, I really got snipers
They up in the cut and they hit shit for me
Y'all niggas makin' this shit way too difficult 
Foot on the pedal, lil' bitch, I am speedin'
Like what should we call it now? 
Why is the shit that we built not holdin' together?
Make my shooter hunt you down, all it's gon' take is one slip 
Make 'em float like a feather (ayy, ayy, yeah, yeah)
Some things just harder to say (yeah, woo-hoo)
I'm with my gang every day (woo-hoo)
These hoes get wet like the bay (yeah)

(Ayy, ayy, yeah, yeah)
Some things just harder to say (yeah, woo-hoo)
I'm with my gang every day (woo-hoo)
These hoes get wet like the Bay (yeah)
Some things just harder to say (yeah, woo-hoo)
I'm with my gang every day (woo-hoo)
These hoes get wet like the Bay (woo-hoo)
