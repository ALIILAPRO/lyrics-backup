		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been living with a curse
Combing through the pages of my youth
There's a million soggy miles
Soaking through the soles of my shoes

And I've been staying up all night
I don't give a damn to sleep anymore
My eyelids are heavy
But my dreams don't sing like before

And I apologize a thousand times for holding up the show
I always had the words, but they don't quite know where to go
You said give me one good reason, now give me 20 more
Don't give yourself away to settle someone else's score

I got the guiltiest conscience
Listening for a savior on a Saturday night
I got my ear to the ground
You got Easter Sunday in your eyes

And I apologize if I seem a little overwhelmed
I'm thirsty, but the holy keep on pissing in my well
I had a purpose and a song that was true
But I ain't ever had a lick of sense when it comes to you

So try to be patient, try to understand
I'm a child, trying to do the work of a man
My pockets are empty, I don't own a thing
But I'd take a diamond from the sky and put it in your ring
