		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Welcome to the funeral, yeah
Closed casket as usual
Yeah, welcome to the funeral
The choir's singin' musicals
Kumbaya, it's beautiful
I bust in with that Uzi, though
And they look like they saw Lucifer (rr)
Welcome to the funeral
We not welcome, we intruded, though
You wanted smoke until you blew the smoke
That's just inexcusable
Welcome to the funeral, where we from, we ruin them
We been to quite a few of 'em
The reverend talk, we booin' him
We throw up the Piru at him

Welcome to the funeral, closed casket as usual
Soul snatching as usual
Amen, hallelujah though
Whole family delusional
Niggas crying like two year olds
Bullet holes come through the doors
I just crossed my heart, then I threw a rose
Damn, welcome to your funeral
Everybody knew you, bro
Ain't nobody shootin' though
Gotta die to see who you know
Damn, welcome to the funeral
Where we from, we ruin 'em
The preacher preach, we shootin' him
Now we need one for you and him
That's why they should cremate ya
Hope when you die they commemorate you
Life is a movie and it's in theaters
Some of y'alls already went to cable
Get shot from afar, you can get a facial
Black gun, chrome gun, interracial
Weed so strong, need ventilation
Funeral home need renovation
I got your mom's teary eyed, that's precipitation
Nigga when you died, did your bitch a favor
Nigga, we gon' mob like the Genovese's
Nigga, fat mob, I'ma Jenny Craig 'em
Drive-bys in a Winnebago
Snipers never hit a baby, crib or cradle
Sit tomatoes on your head and split tomatoes from a hundred feet away, now it's a halo
That's tomato sauce, Heinz 57
Catch up nigga, you behind, where I left you
I hate your bitch, your mom, and your fellas, kids, cousins, uncles, aunts, and your nephews
Shoot a pussy nigga in the face, closed casket
Look his pretty kids in the face, poor bastard
Tears running down his bitch face, romantic
Two straps on me like the old Bo Jacksons (bah)
In his face, closed casket
Send him on the highway to heaven, no traffic
My lil' nigga just caught a body, he ecstatic
He cried tears of joy, then he got him tatted
Welcome to the funeral, closed casket as usual
Whole family delusional
Amen, hallelujah though
Choir singing musicals, Kumbaya, it's beautiful
I bust in with the Uzi, though
They look like they saw Lucifer
Yeah, welcome to the funeral, everybody knew your bro
Ain't nobody shootin' though
That's just inexcusable
Damn, welcome to the funeral
Where we from, we ruin 'em
I've been to quite a few of 'em
My nigga, got immune to them
Shoot a pussy nigga in the face, closed casket
Huh, huh, bop
Look his pretty kids in the face, poor bastards
Goddamn, drive bys in a Winnebago
Snipers never hit a baby, crib or cradle
Sit tomatoes on your head and split tomatoes from a hundred feet away, now it's a halo

In other words, a nigga dead
