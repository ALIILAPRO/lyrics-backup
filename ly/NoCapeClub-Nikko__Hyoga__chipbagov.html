		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I'm so sorry baby but I can't save you
Give a fuck about your life and I ain't got no cape boo
I won't be flying through the night
I'm in wraiths with the gang movin'
And we are not afraid to let it bang to let it shoot like a movie
I got your bitch right on my side but I'm too dangerous for her
She holds the camera every time we fuck she wanna record it
I don't love her
I adore her
She's just my pretty lil whore
I like to slut her out nasty and leave her spit on my floor
Yuh

Every time she around
I bust a bank roll out
But I ain't movin' her out the hood got no cape no cowl
I'm sugar daddy cash cow
And she sit when I bark loud
She like my silver chains, fast car
Lick the sweat off my brow

HA HA HA HA
Make me laugh I make you cry
Look my in the eyes
Reflection that'll get you high
I wanna kill a line
Time to have a pillow fight
I'm high as a tower I get you wings cause your my kryptonite
Once upon a time
You called me yours I called you mine
But you flew to high
I'm the one who's left behind
My life's black and white
I-I-I pop them pills that have a smile
Yeah they brings violets back to life
But real love is hard to find

Yeah I'm booted up
Lil bitch I'm booted up bad
Her ass gon toot it up
Her last man tried copying my swagger

Purple Haze
Can't feel my face
You get me high like outer space
My lungs explode like hand grenades
I wish I could've went your ways but

I'm so sorry baby but I can't save you
Give a fuck about your life and I ain't got no cape boo
I won't be flying through the night
I'm in wraiths with the gang movin'
And we are not afraid to let it bang to let it shoot like a movie
I got your bitch right on my side but I'm too dangerous for her
She holds the camera every time we fuck she wanna record it
I don't love her
I adore her
She's just my pretty lil whore
I like to slut her out nasty and leave her spit on my floor
Yuh
