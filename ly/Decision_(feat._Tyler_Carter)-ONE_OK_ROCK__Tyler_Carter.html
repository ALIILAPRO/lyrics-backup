		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Any day)
Whoa (whoa, whoa)

Whoa
Another day, another life
I wanna live it to the fullest
A little work, a lot of play
All right
足跡たどり行き着く場所
なぞるだけが僕の人生じゃない
We'll never be as young as we are now

You say it's all right
You say it's ok
It's up to you?
Is that the truth? tell me
I'm feeling used
With no one to save me
You say it's all right
Does that make it OK?
What's best for you is less for me
It's my decision

Whoa

消える前 光る前 変わらない
分からないままじゃ 絶対終われない
We'll never be as young as we are now

You say it's all right
You say it's ok
It's up to you?
Is that the truth? tell me
I'm feeling used
With no one to save me
You say it's all right
Does that make it OK?
What's best for you is less for me
It's my decision, woo!

Never never never never again
It's my life, my life, my life
My life to live

You say it's all right
You say it's OK
It's up to you?
Is that the truth? tell me
I'm feeling used
With no one to save me

They say it's all right
Does that make it OK?
What's best for them
Not listening
It's my decision
You say it's all right
You say it's OK
It's up to you?
Is that the truth? tell me
I'm feeling used
With no one to save me

Whoa
