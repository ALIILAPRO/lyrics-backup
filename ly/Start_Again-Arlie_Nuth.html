		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can we? Can we go back in time?
Maybe we, we can go back in time
When you haven't been around
I kinda hear you making sound
It's killing me inside again
When you said you love me more
I said I never let you go
I got nothing left to say
When you said that you hate me
Wish you never met me
The love that you gave me
Can we start again?
I blame it all on me
Baby I'm sorry
The way that you love me
Can we talk again?
Can we? Can we go back in time?
Maybe we, we can go back in time
When you haven't been around
I kinda hear you making sound
It's killing me inside again
When you said you love me more
I said I never let you go
I got nothing left to say
When you said that you hate me
Wish you never met me
The love that you gave me
Can we start again?
I blame it all on me
Baby I'm sorry
The way that you love me
Can we talk again?
Let's start again (oh no)
Let's start again (let's start again)
Let's start again (can we start again?)
Let's start again (it'll be better)
Let's start again (I'll be better)
Let's start again (we'll be better)
Let's start again (it'll be better)
Can we start again?
