		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I walked away
'Cause you'd sucked it to the bones
And I was all yours, I was all yours
I walked away
From everything, but now

I'm gone, I've got nothing to lose
My hands are in my pockets
And my thoughts on the move
I roam the streets like a fish in the sea
I've been dealing with disillusion enough to be freed
We pushed the boundaries way too far
But it was so beautiful
I loved you and I loved us
Living for wanderlust

You think that you can tell when everything will crumble
That this is your life and there is nothing to change it
You think you can hold on everything you know
And everything will go alright
I walked away
'Cause you sucked it to the bones
An hour before, I was all yours
I walked away
From everything we know

I'm gone, the Onassis lake is frozen
I'm gazing at the wild geese and I'm holding my fate on
The cold fact that life is just a long migration
Towards the sun I guess, towards the sun, I guess
Far, in distance, there is hope
Or at least another round
We're not dead, just out of tune
I'll see you in the neighborhood

You think that you can tell when everything will crumble
That this is your life, and there is nothing to change it
You think you can hold on everything you know
And everything will go alright
I walked away
'Cause you had sucked it to the bones
And I was all yours, I was all yours
I walked away
From everything, but now
I walked away, love, I was all yours
I walked away
'Cause you had sucked it to the bones
And I was all yours, I was all yours, yes
