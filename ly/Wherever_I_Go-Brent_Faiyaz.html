		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I should've never got so close
I should've never told you things
Now, your code can match my code
I should've never taught you things (mm-hmm)

I might see you out sometimes
Then I remember when you used to be mine (be mine, that's mine)
Mine (that's mine)
If only I knew, I'd take care of you
You could've skipped the line (now you outside)

It's like you know (it's like you know)
Why would you be here?
You're wherever I go (you're wherever I go)
Listen, you're playin', girl
It's like you know (it's like you know)
And that's why you go
Wherever I go (you're wherever I go)

I shouldn't have let you know
Should've never brought you things
I shouldn't have let you close
I should've never bought you things (oh, yeah)

I might see you out sometimes
And I'll remember when you used to be mine (be mine, that's mine)
Mine (that's mine)
If only I knew, I'd take care of you
It may be your night, yeah (now you outside)

It's like you know (it's like you know)
Why would you be here?
You're wherever I go (you're wherever I go)
Face it, you're playin', girl
It's like you know (you know)
And that's why you go
Wherever I go (wherever I go)
