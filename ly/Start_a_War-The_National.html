		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We expected something, something better than before
We expected something more

Do you really think you can just put it in a safe
Behind a painting, lock it up and leave?
Do you really think you can just put it in a safe
Behind a painting, lock it up and leave?
Walk away now and you're gonna start a war

Whatever went away, I'll get it over now
I'll get money, I'll get funny again
Whatever went away, I'll get it over now
I'll get money, I'll get funny again
Walk away now and you're gonna start a war

We expected something, something better than before
We expected something more

You were always weird but I never had to hold you
By the edges, like I do now
You were always weird but I never had to hold you
By the edges, like I do now
Walk away now and you're gonna start a war

Whatever went away, I'll get it over now
I'll get money, I'll get funny again
Whatever went away, I'll get it over now
I'll get money, I'll get funny again
Walk away now and you're gonna start a war
Walk away now and you're gonna start a war
