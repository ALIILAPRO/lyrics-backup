		  Ah, ah, h-ha ha
Well hello there little buddy, come on in!
Whatcha got there with you?
That your dog?
Guess there's no reason you can't have dogs up there on the moon,
That's a good pretty good looking pooch...
Betcha come back for more of Dr. Neptune's delicious elixir is that right?
Ha ha ha ha, I knew you would. I'll get that for ya...
Oh, I see, you figured out where it is, didn'tcha.
Well, alright, I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll set up the checkerboard here,
We'll have us another game of checkers...
One without all that cheatin' you done last time...
We ain't gonna have no more of that I can tell ya'...
I seen what you done...
They have any glasses like that up there on the moon?

Testify

Napalm
When the bomb's activated and mutilated the leg and arms...
