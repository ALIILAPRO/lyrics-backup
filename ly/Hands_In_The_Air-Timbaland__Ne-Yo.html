		<p>
		  I said there's a
Hey Baby girl
You can open up
I want it all

Such a beautiful girl
Standing on the chase
With everything to
Can't stand it

Hands up in the air, 
Hands up in the air
Hands up in the air
Hands up in the air

Hands up in the air, 
Hands up in the air
Hands up in the air
Hands up in the air

Such a beautiful girl
Standing on the chase
With everything to
Can't stand it

Hands up in the air, 
Hands up in the air
Hands up in the air
Hands up in the air

Hands up in the air, 
Hands up in the air
Hands up in the air
Hands up in the air
