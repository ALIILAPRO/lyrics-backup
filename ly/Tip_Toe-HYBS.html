		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me back to the
Ground cause girl
You look fine as hell

I’m not easily distracted
But you’re acting like a magnet
You pull me in

I’ll be putting on a suit
Be tip toeing to you
If you’re down for it
We got nothing else to do
And nothing else to lose
And I’m down for this

If you’re in the mood
We can take it to the moon
Just like a movie scene
Table for two
No need to be fed
I want you instead
If you’re in the mood
We can tip toe to the moon

Hold up
Tell my friends to pinch me hard
Cause it coudn’t be real
Is this a dream i’m living
Lord help me pls
Cause i can’t get over you

I’ll be putting on a suit
Be tip toeing to you
If you’re down for it
We got nothing else to do
And nothing else to lose
And I’m down for this

If you’re in the mood
We can take it to the moon
Just like a movie scene
Table for two
No need to be fed
I want you instead
If you’re in the mood
We can tip toe to the moon


If you’re in the mood
We can take it to the moon
Just like a movie scene
Table for two
No need to be fed
I want you instead
If you’re in the mood
We can tip toe to the moon
