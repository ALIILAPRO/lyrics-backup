		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Show me what you're made of (Ohh ohh)
Like, understand what I'm made of (Oh) ohh

Like, understand what I'm made of
No more bad news while I'm sleep
You gotta let me wake up
She be talkin' 'bout quittin', nah
It ain't in my genetic makeup
She be callin' in sick every day
Now you gotta take you a pay cut
She said "Glad that you know, but lowkey
It's still weird you ain't ask me"
(yeah, yeah, go, yeah, go)
In a dark place with my mind gone
(Go, go, yeah)
Tryna turn back time like I'm Dr strange
So far away from home (yeah, yeah)
Goin' back to the future, girl
I'm on the way, Scott, scott and Ramona
That shit feel like la la when it's on
(yeah, yeah) i been shootin' my shot, shot
I'm in the zone (yeah, yeah, go, go, go)

Got me goin' back bro
Spend my time in my dome
I just think and I rap
This shit straight from the soul
Love that shit when it's rarely
My life so unknown
Give a fuck if they stare, girl
They been should've known
Got my hand in my face
It's too many lights on
Almost late for my flight
I got too much ice on
It's like 5: 32, I'm up all
Night long, all night long, all night long
When I'm back in my dream I go
All night long, all night long
All night long get your bitch out my face
She goin' all night long (All night long)
All night long, soon as I got rich
Now they love my songs
Swear it's so strange
You used to hate my songs
Still remember those days you
Ignored my phone (Ignored my phone)
In a way I feel like
I'm way too damn inanimate
She be blowin' up my phone up every day
Girl I'm way too past it
Tryna tell me you real but every
Month you fill yourself with plastic
I ain't judgin' your life but lowkey, it's
Still weird if you ask me, yeah, yeah
If it ain't these drugs then this
Motherfuckin' time finna get me, yeah, yeah
What would you say if the sun
Wasn't rollin' around with me? yeah
Get that shit out your heart and your mind
Leave it all on the table
You ain't stop lovin' shit it's a fable
Off a blunt and put stone in my

Like, understand what I'm made of (Go)
No more bad news while I'm sleep
You gotta let me wake up
She be talkin' 'bout quittin', nah
It ain't in my genetic makeup
She be callin' in sick every day
Now you gotta take you a pay cut
She said "Glad that you know, but boy
It's still weird you ain't ask me"
(I'm just tryna be free)
In a dark place with my mind gone
Tryna turn back time like I'm Dr strange
So far away from home (yeah, yeah)
Goin' back to the future, girl
I'm on the way, Scott, scott and Ramona
That shit feel like la la when it's on
(yeah, yeah) i been shootin' my shot, shot
I'm in the zone (yeah, yeah, go, go, go)

Yeah, talk to me right
I don't like when you fuck with my peace
(yeah) i'm talkin' 'bout arguments, girl
I'm tryna make this shit easy
Like how you gonna act next year when
The kid hop out on TV?
Say you hate me every time that I leave
When you know damn well you need me
And that shit's so awkward
She know lowkey she think she need me
And the key word "Think, " in
The back of your mind, go ahead and free me
And I can't lie, half the time that I'm
With you, I don't feel like me, me
And I took off my shackles, I'm
Countin' my blessings, because I'm free
Yeah

Like, understand what I'm made of
No more bad news while I'm sleep
You gotta let me wake up
She talkin' 'bout quittin', girl
It ain't in my genetic makeup (yeah)
She be callin' in sick every day
Now you gotta take you a pay cut
She said "Glad that you know, but boy
It's still weird you ain't ask me"
(I'm just tryna be free, go)
In a dark place with my mind gone
(yeah, yeah)
Tryna turn back time like I'm Dr strange
So far away from home (yeah, yeah)
Goin' back to the future, girl
I'm on the way, Scott, scott and Ramona
That shit feel like la la when it's on
(yeah, yeah) i been shootin' my shot, shot
I'm in the zone (yeah, yeah)

Let's go yes, sir
I'm just tryna be free (Sorry) yeah, yeah
