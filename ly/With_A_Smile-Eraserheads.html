		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lift your head, baby, don't be scared
Of the things that could go wrong along the way
You'll get by with a smile
You can't win at everything but you can try

Baby, you don't have to worry
'Cause there ain't no need to hurry
No one ever said that there's an easy way
When they're closing all their doors
And they don't want you anymore
This sounds funny but I'll say it anyway

Girl, I'll stay through the bad times
Even if I have to fetch you everyday
You'll get by if you smile
You can never be too happy in this life

In a world where everybody hates a happy ending story
It's a wonder love can make the world go 'round
But don't let it bring you down and turn your face into a frown
You'll get along with a little prayer and a song

(To-do-do-do)
(To-do-do-do)
(To-do-do-do, do-do)
(Do-do, do-do)
Let me hear you sing it
(To-do-do-do)
(To-do-do-do)
(To-do-do-do, do-do)
(Do-do, do-do)

'Cause in a world where everybody hates a happy ending story
It's a wonder love can make the world go 'round
But don't let it bring you down and turn your face into a frown
You'll get along with a little prayer and a song

Lift your head, baby, don't be scared
Of the things that could go wrong along the way
You'll get by with a smile
Now it's time to kiss away those tears goodbye

(To-do-do-do)
(To-do-do-do)
(To-do-do-do, do-do)
(Do-do, do-do)
Let me hear you sing it
(To-do-do-do)
(To-do-do-do)
(To-do-do-do, do-do)
(Do-do, do-do)

(To-do-do-do)
(To-do-do-do)
(To-do-do-do, do-do)
(Do-do, do-do)
(To-do-do-do)
(To-do-do-do)
(To-do-do-do, do-do)
(Do-do, do-do)

(To-do-do-do)
(To-do-do-do)
(To-do-do-do, do-do)
(Do-do, do-do)

With a smile
