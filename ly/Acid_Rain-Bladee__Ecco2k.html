		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mix the six, it's all warped
You're so sweet, I need salt
This your job, here's your stage
Speak your truth, it's okay
Eat the night, through the veil
Shield the flame, bless the rain
In this world, watch me age
Be the love, birthday cake

What would it take to make it break?
Whatever that is, I can't save it
Walk away, holy grace
I like it better when it's naked
What you say?
You're not even drain
I wanna see what you hold sacred
Wipe the smile off of your face
Fuck your birthday cake, happy drain day

Keep it silent in the circle (ah)
You're the part of me that is so perfect (ah)
Keep it silent in the circle (ah)
You're the part of me that is so perfect (ah)
Don't try that with me, it isn't worth it
Made the hotel to a place of worship
Make the music when it is submerging
Heavy load, I keep it on me, burden
I don't wanna see, close the curtain
It's not even that early
But the sky's looking purple

What would it take to make it break?
Whatever that is, I can't save it
Walk away, holy grace
I like it better when it's naked
What you say?
You're not even drain
I wanna see what you hold sacred
Wipe the smile off of your face
Fuck your birthday cake, happy drain day

Keep it silent in the circle
Fuck your birthday cake, happy drain day
