		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I still see you in
The places we would go
Like your face is painted on the walls
I've been trying to forget
All the moments that we spent
'Cause now I do it on my own
Oh, you and I were like the summer
But now it's winter here on my own

If I would have known
That you wouldn't be here anymore
I would have made the moments last a little longer
'Cause now I'm alone
And you're just a memory in my mind
I would have given anything to say goodbye
If I would have known
If I would have known, oh

Oh, I remember how
We would laugh all the time
But now you're not around
And I'm just trying to find
Something else to fill
The empty spaces you left behind
But nothing ever seems to work
I've been thinking 'bout
The things that you used to say
Even not around
You're in my head every day
But it's fine I don't mind
I promise I'll be okay

If I would have known
That you wouldn't be here anymore
I would have made the moments last a little longer
'Cause now I'm alone
And you're just a memory in my mind
I would have given anything to say goodbye
If I would have known (ohh)
If I would have known, oh

Oh
Oh
