		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see the mighty fortress crumble, tumble to the ground
Swarms of rumbling bumble bees, consume the frantic crowd
Seething, breeding mescaline drench the pretty girls
Boredom for excuse, there's no more fun in the world

Me outside my window, me inside my door
Inside or outside, I don't give a fuck no more
Say I'm angry, have a lousy attitude
It's hard to be optimistic when I share the world with you

Pretentious asshole, time to move aside
Can't survive on your hypocrisy and lies

You're building up, but you're tearing down
The mighty fortress crumbles, tumbles to the ground

And I can't understand, can't understand, can't comprehend
Indifference to my fellow man, no longer amused
Just pissed off and confused, still I laugh
Me eyes are dry and I don't know why, I wonder why...
And I'm so fucking happy
