		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There goes my heart again. Here comes the hurt back in.
You'd think I'd learn by now to let you go.
With just one look from you my heart start beating blue.
Just when it's on the mend, there goes my heart again.

I'd tried to talk it out of lovin' you, but my heart has a mind of its own.
It won't forget you like I told it to. I wish it would leave you alone.
There goes my heart again. Here comes the hurt back in.
You'd think IÃ¢??d learn by now to let you go.

With just one look from you my heart start beating blue.
Just when it's on the mend, there goes my heart again.

I was doin' fine for a little while even with no one to hold.
I slowed it down 'til I saw your smile. Now it's racing out of control.
There goes my heart again. Here comes the hurt back in.
You'd think I'd learn by now to let you go.

With just one look from you my heart start beating blue.
Just when it's on the mend, there goes my heart again.
Just when it's on the mend, there goes my heart again.
