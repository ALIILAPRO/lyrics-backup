		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, fucking up this bag I need more (1k, 1k)
Psychic always knew I'd see more (yeah, yeah)
Getting these racks (yeah, yeah)
Getting these racks
Came a long way, I been through downs, don't talk no badge (yeah, yeah)

I be in the kitchen like in and out
I be in the trap, I'm in and out
Spend a hundred racks, I'm spending now
I be in the trap, I'm in and out
Best weed, that I smoke (that's so nice)
30k just to show (that's so nice)
I be in the booth just making art when you break my heart
Had to leave from the start (had to leave)
Best weed, that I smoke (that's so nice)
30k just to show (that's so nice)

Aye, yeah
Fucking up the cash, lil' nigga I need more (need more)
Yeah, see into the future, 8 figures I see more
Yeah, counting these racks again
Double ain't trafficking
Humble, I can't begin
Yeah, I'm counting these racks again
Best weed, that I smoke
30k just to show
When they see cash, they stop (stop)
When they see the bag, they pop (pop)
Can't believe the bag I caught (caught)
Double R, pull it off the lot (lot)
Shooter, no gym, got a shot
Turnin' heads pulling off the lot (lot)
Busting down brick to a watch
(We counting these racks again)

I be in the kitchen like in and out
I be in the trap, I'm in and out
Spend a hundred racks, I'm spending now
I be in the trap, I'm in and out
Best weed, that I smoke
30k just to show (that's so nice)
I be in the booth just making art when you break my heart (heart)
Had to leave from the start (had to leave)

Fiends locked me up, I was in and out
I told 'em I had to leave (gone)
On my way out playin' my music, this has to be the funniest shit
I left that loud even though most of the time, everyone just left it to me
Now what the fuck wrong with these people?
Don't reach your hand out, ain't no dappin' me
You crazy
We got whatever you need nigga, name it
She say she ain't suckin' dick in no basement
She had her mind made up, she changed it
She like "you way too smooth, you dangerous"
Lost 5 stacks when I was on vacation
So many racks, you really almost fainted
It ain't no regular child you was raisin'
That's when she came to that realization
You don't gotta get my mind right, whole lotta crazy shit happened in my life
Remember you watched from the sidelines, (?) Highlight (highlight)
That shit, uh, roll that four, five, six
I'ma call it from now, you gon' be back around when I'm all the way lit
Let's skrt, let's skrt

Fucking up this bag I need more (yeah, yeah)
Psychic always knew I'd see more (yeah, yeah)
Getting these racks (yeah, yeah)
Getting these racks
Came a long way I been through downs don't talk no badge (yeah, yeah)
