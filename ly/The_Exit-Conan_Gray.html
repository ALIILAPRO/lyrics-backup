		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  February, and the flowers haven't even wilted
It's crazy how fast you tilted
The world that we were busy buildin'
Mid-November, and I'm sippin' on a half-cold coffee
Starin' at a girl who's not me
On your arm, a carbon copy

Feels like we had matching wounds
But mine's still black and bruised
And yours is perfectly fine now
Feels like we buried alive
Something that never died
So, God, it hurt when I found out

You love her, it's over
Do you even doubt it on your lips? (When you say it, say it?)
You love her, it's over
You already found someone to miss
While I'm still standin' at the exit (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
I'm still standin' at the exit (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)

I can't hate you for gettin' everything we wanted
I just thought that I would be part of it
I was movin' into your apartment
When you met someone, she's from your hometown
You hate the East Coast, it's where you live now
Impossible to understand how you're not comin' back
But I can't say it out loud

You love her, it's over
Do you even doubt it on your lips? (When you say it, say it?)
You love her, it's over
You already found someone to miss
While I'm still standin' at the exit (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
I'm still standin' at the exit (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)

Feels like we had matching wounds
But mine's still black and bruised
And yours is perfectly fine
Feels like we buried alive
Something that never died
So, God, it hurt when I found out

You love her (feels like we had matching wounds)
It's over (but mine's still black and bruised)
Do you even doubt it on your lips? (And yours is perfectly fine now)
(When you say it, say it?)
You love her (feels like we buried alive)
It's over (something that never died)
You already found someone to miss (so, God, it hurt when I found out)

You love her, it's over
You already found someone to miss
