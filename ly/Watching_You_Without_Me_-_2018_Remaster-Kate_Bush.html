		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can't hear me
You can't hear me
You can't hear what I'm saying
You can't hear what I'm saying to you

You watch the clock 
Move the slow hand 
I should have been home 
Hours ago
But I'm not here 
But I'm not here 

You can't hear me
You can't hear me 
You can't feel me 
Here in the room with you now 
You can't hear what I'm saying 
You don't hear what I'm saying, do you? 

Can't let you know 
What's been happening
There's a ghost in our home
Just watching you without me
I'm not here
(You don't hear me) 
But I'm not here (you can't hear me) 
But I'm not here (you don't hear what I'm saying) 

Don't ignore, don't ignore me
Let me? 
Don't ignore, don't ignore me 
Let me? 
Don't ignore, don't ignore me
Let me? 
We see you here

You don't hear me come in 
Help me, baby, help me, baby, talk to me, listen to me
Listen to me, talk to me, help
(You can't hear me) 
Listen, baby, listen to me, baby, help me, help me, baby
Talk to me! talk to me! please, baby, talk to me
(You can't hear me) 
You won't hear me leaving
