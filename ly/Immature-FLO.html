		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feels like I've been waitin' a lifetime (yeah, yeah)
For you to tell me what's goin' on in your mind (mind)

But you don't talk to me, talk to me
I'm tryna walk with you so walk with me
But you be takin' too long (you be takin' too long)
Soon, I'll be gone

Say you want my body, body 
But you ain't never do a thing about it 
Baby, lovin' you is such a chore
'Cause you're steady movin' immature
I don't want no body, body 
Who talk that talk but don't do shit about it
Say you gonna put it down for sure
Why you gotta be so imma-, imma-

Imma-tu-tu-tu-ture, tu-tu-tu-ture
Imma-tu-tu-tu-ture, tu-tu-tu-ture
Imma-tu-tu-tu-ture, tu-tu-tu-ture
Imma-ture

Oh (oh)
I'm tryna understand your point of view
But you fuckin' with me, fuckin' with me
Tell me, how can I relate (ah)
If you don't communicate?

But you don't talk to me, talk to me (oh)
I'm tryna walk with you so walk with me (walk with me, yeah)
But you be takin' too long (you be takin' too long)
Soon, I'll be gone

Say you want my body, body (ah)
But you ain't never do a thing about it (ha-ah-ah-ah)
Baby, lovin' you is such a chore
'Cause you're steady movin' immature
I don't want no body, body (no I don't, no I don't)
Who talk that shit but don't do shit about it
Say you gonna put it down for sure
Why you gotta be so imma-, imma-

Imma-tu-tu-tu-ture, tu-tu-tu-ture
Imma-tu-tu-tu-ture, tu-tu-tu-ture
Imma-tu-tu-tu-ture, tu-tu-tu-ture
Imma-ture

Say you want my body, body
But you ain't never do a thing about it (thing about it)
Baby, lovin' you is such a chore
'Cause you're steady movin', immature

I don't want nobody, body (no, oh)
Who talk the talk but don't do shit about it (about it)
Say you gonna put it down for sure (down for sure)
Why you gotta be so imma-, imma-

Immature, immature (immature, immature)
Immature, immature (immature, immature)
Ha, ah, ah (imma-tu-tu-tu-ture, tu-tu-tu-ture)
Immature, so immature
Why you gotta be? (So immature)
Why you gotta be? (So immature)
So immature
Oh
