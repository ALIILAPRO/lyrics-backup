		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And so she woke up from a dream
That was beautiful and starry and oh so wild
It was all still clear in her eyes
And though her mind was foggy and blank
She wondered why
Her life couldn't be as lovely it was time
There was this king he had a castle or throne
But his horse was great and white
He rode alone and liked it that way
But when he met her he swore

He would never leave her side
They road across the land two lovers hand in hand
And no danger would come near
And when something made her cry
She'd look at him teary eyed
And he would make her feel better
So much better so much better than before
And now this forest was his home
It was a night time and the right time for love in the dark
She placed her hand upon her chest 

And all the rest just flowed 
Makin' love down under an ancient far away night
It was so grand just holding someone's hand
And now safety came naturally
It was so clear that she would never have to fear
Oh tell me a story of magic and spiralling ships
And the stars in the night
Just whisper in my ears make it soft make it clear
I want to hear every breath you say
She placed her hand upon her breast

But she woke up from the land tears falling in her hands
As she looked up asking why
She laid back in her bed thoughts rising in her head
Why can't my life be beautiful she said
As she closed her eyes again
Just prayin' he'd return
But only darkness fell upon her
