		  Follow my lead
Hey

Good little girl
Always picking a fight with me
You know that I'm bad
But you're spending the night with me
What do you want from my world?
You're a good little girl

Bad little boy
That's what you're acting like
I really don't buy
That you're that kind of guy
And if you are
Why do you want to hang out with me?

Don't you know I'm a villain?
Every night I'm out killin'
Sendin' everyone runnin' like children
I know why you're mad at me
I've got demon eyes
And they're looking right through your anatomy
Into your deepest fears, baby, I'm not from here
I'm from the Nightosphere
To me, you're clear, transparent
You got a thing for me, girl, it's apparent

Oh, oh
I got a hot potato
And I got two hot tomatoes
Well, they'll make a good sauce, maybe
You're not so bad, you know (so I'll shake it all over the table)
Not so bad? (I'll shake it, shake it)
I'm the son of a demon (and shake it and shake it)
And the Vampire King (and shake it all over the table)
It's not something I have to try at
You on the other hand (the table, for as long as I am able)
I'm not trying to be bad 
I'm hanging out with you because you're my friend
What? Like him?
Pfft-pfft, no, different, ugh, hey
Hee-ya (oh no)
Hee-ya (oh, hahaha)
Hey, break it up you two
