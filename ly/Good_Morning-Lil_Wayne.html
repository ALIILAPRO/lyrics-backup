		  Good Morning, it's Weezy FS1

Skip the BS and put everybody after VS
P.S., all I spit is F-A-C-T-S
The best, Skip Bayless, yeah, say less
Top of the top, apex, everyday flex
If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin', I ain't tryna hate
Let's have a Jordan and Lebron debate, I got time today
Drippin' on the chain, my diamonds say what they gotta say
If you think it's a game, I commentate, I ain't got to play
On in the mornin', I own my opponent
My competition is not an issue, just cotton tissue, uh
Unconventional, controversial, convoluted
Unconditional, undeterred, and Undisputed
No mercy (no mercy), no mercy
Unconventional, controversial, convoluted
This the new Undisputed
Now let's go face to face, I embrace debate
I don't make mistakes, I just make my case
"Drops mic" when I'm done, what more can I say?
Not bitin' my tongue, I don't like the taste

And I won't back down (Won't back down), won't back down
Won't back down (Won't back down), won't back down
Won't back down (Won't back down), won't back down
Won't back down (Won't back down), won't back down

No mercy, no mercy
No mercy, yeah
Unconventional, controversial, convoluted
Unconditional, undeterred, and undisputed
No mercy, no mercy
No mercy, yeah
Unconventional, controversial, convoluted
This the new Undisputed
No mercy

Good morning, it's Weezy FS1
