		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Out of the zone, trying to see
I'm so alone, nothing for me
I guess I'll go home, try to be sane
Try to pretend none of it happened
Oh, this old tree, lonely old me
Whoops-a-daisy, I thought I was happy, oh

Out of the zone, now that I see
I don't need them and they don't need me
I guess I'll go home, try to be sane
Try to pretend none of it happened
Destined to be lonely old me
Whoops-a-daisy, I thought I was happy, oh

Ah, why won't they talk to me?
(Thought I was happy, oh)
Ah, why won't they talk to me?
(Thought I was happy, oh)
Ah, why won't they talk to me?
(Thought I was happy, oh)
Ah, why won't they talk to me?
(Why?)
Ah, why won't they talk to me?

But I don't really care 'bout it anyway
I wouldn't listen to a word any of 'em say
They just talk about themselves all day
One day I'll be a star, they'll be sorry

Ah, why won't they talk to me?
Ah, why won't they talk to me?
Ah, why won't they talk to me?
Ah, why won't they talk to me?
(Why?)
Ah, why won't they talk to me?
