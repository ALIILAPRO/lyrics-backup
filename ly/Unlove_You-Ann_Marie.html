		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  See I never understood
How you can just tell lies to me
I thought that we were good
Then you start acting differently

I call, you don't pick up
I swear you be testing me
You claim you won't switch up
But you ain't the same to me

But now I understand
That you ain't never gonna change
I kept letting you back
And you just let me down again

When you were down and out
I helped you out
I did everything you asked me to
And, baby, now

I wish I could forget you
Wish I could unlove you
Wish that I could go back to the days before I met you

Then maybe you can't hurt me like you do
Make me feel the way you do
Keep me running back to you
(I wish that I)

I wish I could forget you
Wish I could unlove you
Wish that I could go back to the days before I met you

Then maybe you can't hurt me like you do
Make me feel the way you do
Keep me running back to you
(I wish that I can rewind)

Way before I touched you
Way before I fucked you
Way before I thought that I could love you
Way before I kissed you
Wish I would've dissed you
'Cause when I try to hate you, man
I fuck around and miss you

You 'posed to hold me down
But all you did was hold me back
I wished I knew you were a clown
I wouldn't have threw this ass back
Ya'll I said it, I'm to good for you
Shorty, that's a fact
I gave you everything and more
And this is how you pay me back

Now all I wanna know is was it the truth?
You could've fucked them hoes lives up
So why did you choose me?
Why did you use me?
Why did you bruise me?
Should've kept that shit moving
Now, baby, I

I wish I could forget you
Wish I could unlove you (wish I could unlove you)
Wish that I could go back to the days before I met you (before I met you)

Then maybe you can't hurt me like you do
Make me feel the way you do
Keep me running back to you
(I wish that I)

I wish I could forget you
Wish I could unlove you
Wish that I could go back to the days before I met you

Then maybe you can't hurt me like you do
Make me feel the way ya do
Keep me running back to you

(I wish that I can rewind)
