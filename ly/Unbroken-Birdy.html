		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Could you keep your head up?
When you're losing ground
Could you keep your head up?
Everything you once loved
Like your own blood
Comes crumbling down
Could you keep your head up?

Sometimes the tears we cry
Are more than any heart can take
We hurt, just keep it inside
Small wonder that it starts to break

Many moons will lighten the way
And sure this night will follow a day
And everything you once loved remains
Unbroken, unbroken

Could you find a daydream?
In the dead of night
Could you find a daydream
Keep a quiet victory
To a whisper
In an uphill fight
Could you keep your head up

Sometimes the tears we cry
Are more than any heart can take
We hurt, just keep it inside
Small wonder that it starts to break

Many moons will lighten the way
And sure this night will follow a day
And everything you once loved remains
Unbroken, unbroken

Everything you once loved lies unbroken
Many moons will light us
Many moons will guide us
Everything you once loved lies unbroken
Leave the past behind us
Leave the past behind us

Many moons will lighten the way
And sure this night will follow a day
And everything you once loved remains
Unbroken, unbroken, unbroken
