		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you stupid, stinky
Yeah, you stupid, stinky (we got London on the track)
Yeah

Let me get it started
Round one, fight
Round two, ice
Round three, bye (bitch)
Let me get it started
Yeah, round one, fight (fight)
Round two, ice
Round three, bye

Okay
I don't mean to instigate
Y'all really phone it in with the music lately
I don't need another hit 'cause it's useless really
I ain't lookin' good? You hallucinating
Every time I hear 'em talk I assume they crazy
You could open up for me, who are you? First lady?
Shut it down, mid-show tell 'em, "Fuck you, pay me"
That's a new Mercedes, I am graduating (yeah)

Let me get it started
Round one, fight (fight)
Round two, ice (put 'em up)
Round three, bye (put 'em up, put 'em up)
Let me get it started (bitch, come on)
Yeah, round one, fight (louder)
Round two, ice (yeah)
Round three, bye (yeah, said)

Yeah, and it's so much ice (so much)
She wanna hit me, I said no Mike Tyson (no Mike)
In 2050 they won't know you, Otis (uh-uh)
A hunnid billies, I'm the G.O.A.T., no Eilish (yeah)
You full of Remy, now your face look tired (yeah)
Used to be the baby ma, you Marten now
You gon' need another doc, can't talk me down
You better pick her up 'cause hoes brawlin' now
So come buck up

Let me get it started (yeah)
Round one, fight (let's go)
Round two, ice (ayy)
Round three, bye (thought you did something)
Let me get it started (bitch)
Yeah, round one, fight (yeah)
Round two, ice
Round three, bye (let me try it again)
(Yeah)

Crusty, musty, dusty
Don't you ever, ever
In your life
Come for me
