		  (Great John on the beat, by the way)

You don't know me but you know my body
Ridin' shotty with my bro, we got it
AP, make him watch my pockets
Uh, uh, uh
Look, look

Everybody wanna be somebody (uh-huh)
You don't know me but you know my body
Ridin' shotty with my bro, we got it
AP, make him watch my pockets, uh
Backends, don't front, we got it 
Batman, I was tryna go robbin' (robbin')

You flip the gang and we mobbin'
She either thick or she starvin', huh (starvin')
I'm so high like martians
I blew up like atomic, ayy
Flow so sick, might vomit, huh
Ask about drills, no comment, uh
Everything, I gotta own it, huh
I ain't fearin' no opponent, huh
I ain't fearin' no opp, no, no opp
Tell 'em, "Block'll send you to the top floor, to the top"
All them hatin' niggas, tell 'em, "Stop"
Spent your whole life on a watch
This for all my times gettin' locked
This for all my niggas in the box
Hold your head high, rest up to the dead guys
No more stoppin' at the red light 
No one's stoppin' at the, no, huh

Everybody wanna be somebody (body)
You don't know me but you know my body
Ridin' shotty with my bro, we got it
AP, make him watch my pockets, uh
Backends, don't front, we got it (look)
Batman, I was tryna go robbin'

So I'll be here makin' all the music that they party to, huh, huh
I had a dream in a Wraith, huh, she wanna fuck tell her, "Wait," huh
So now I just ride through the Figgy, look, look
Tell me she love how it taste, I know they watchin' my plays, huh
I bet you we still make completion, meet up, tell 'em, "Drink up"
Bustin' down with us, how you gon' keep up, huh?
Ain't care to meet us, now it's on Sheff, Sleep with a speaker, look
Wrist work still with it, couple new charges, still move with it, huh
Wrist work still with it, gettin' left, right, face with center, ayy (look)

Everybody wanna be somebody (uh-huh)
You don't know me but you know my body
Ridin' shotty with my bro, we got it
AP, make him watch my pockets, uh
Backends, don't front, we got it 
Batman, I was tryna go robbin' (robbin')
