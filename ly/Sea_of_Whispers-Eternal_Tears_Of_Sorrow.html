		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the last angel's falling above the crimson sea,
By the sun's final rising, I don't even see

How the silent tears are flowing from the reaper's eyes,
As the frost is calling for young harvest to the night,
He's crying for my heart... He's mourning for my soul.... I'm all alone

Every time I hurt myself, I somehow still survived,
Every time my dreams were killed, but they always came back alive

Tears frozen on my cheek while roaming through the time,
And the whispers calling for my harvest through the night,
I'm crying with the wind... I'm crying for my life... I'll die alone

Hear the whispered dreams of the fallen...

I'll rest alone...

Hear the whispered dreams of the fallen...

Tears frozen on my cheek while roaming through the night,
And the whispers calling for my harvest to the night,
I'm crying with the wind... I'm crying for my dreams... I'll die alone

Hear the whispered dreams of the fallen...

I'll die alone...

Hear the whispered dreams of the fallen...
