		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ink fills the page
A classic killer completes the cast
If evil's all the rage
Cut to the close up, then fade to black

Sit back for the sequel of your dreams
All psychos crave more shocking scenes
Who cares if it bleeds beyond the screen?

Are you misunderstood?
Are you more bad than good?
Welcome to Horrorwood
Where anyone would kill for a call back

'Cause everyone is just so fucking
Desperate for fame
Can't blame the savages this town attracts
I guess we're all insane
So silence the critics, 'cause this is not an act
But here's the soundtrack

Sit back for the sequel of your dreams
All psychos crave more shocking scenes
Who cares if it bleeds beyond the screen?

Are you misunderstood? (Yeah)
Are you more bad than good?
Welcome to Horrorwood
Where anyone would kill for a call back

The tabloids say
"There goes the neighborhood"
But long live Horrorwood
The only place it pays to be a hack

But will you make the cut if you know
Stardom's just an afterthought
For all those stabbed in the backlot
Piled up and left to rot
So how's this for an establishing shot?

Are you misunderstood? (Yeah)
Are you more bad than good?
Welcome to Horrorwood
Where anyone would kill for a call back

The tabloids say
"There goes the neighborhood"
But long live Horrorwood
The only place where everyone should

Fear the premiere
There's always a target out on the red carpet
Between 'Silver Screams' something's awakened
And you'll never make it
But enjoy the show

(Yeah)

Are you misunderstood? (Yeah)
Are you more bad than good?
Welcome to Horrorwood
Where anyone would kill for a call back

The tabloids say
"There goes the neighborhood"
But long live Horrorwood
The only place it pays to be a hack
Be a hack
Welcome back
