		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My anger will cut traces on most of my skin
I'm just a ragdoll, tell me why
My body may take it but my mind is weak
Why do I love becoming my own enemy?

I will keep on waiting
For a sign from you
I don't know how my heart
Can survive without affection
In the light of your forgiveness
Let me open up to you
And I will let you see
The war inside of me

Ha hoo
Ah ha hoo
Ha hoo
Ah ha hoo

Self-destruction draws patterns in me
It will bring us down, I don't know why
I keep on playing the games of power and need
You're the only way out, I am my own enemy

I will keep on waiting
For a sign from you
I don't know how my heart
Can survive without affection (ah ha hoo)
In the light of your forgiveness (ha hoo)
Let me open up to you
And I will let you see (ha hoo)
The war inside of me

Ha hoo
Ah ha hoo
Ha hoo
Ah ha hoo

I will keep on waiting
For a sign from you
I don't know how my heart
Can survive without affection (ah ha hoo)
In the light of your forgiveness (ha hoo)
Let me open up to you
And I will let you see (ha hoo)
The war inside of me

The war inside of me
The war inside of me
