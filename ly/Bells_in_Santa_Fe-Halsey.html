		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't call me by my name
All of this is temporary
Watch as I slip away
For your sake
All of this is temporary

Well, maybe I could hold you in the dark
You won't even notice me depart
Secondhand thread
In a second hand bed
With a second man's head
Leaving through the door without a word
You won't even notice, little bird
Better off dead so I reckon I'm headed to hell instead

So don't wait for me
Don't wait for me
Wait, ah

It's not a happy ending

Don't wait for me
Don't Wait for me
Wait, ah

It's not a happy ending

Jesus needed a three day weekend
To sort out all his bullshit, figure out the treason
I've been searching for a fortified defense
Four to five reasons
But, Jesus, you've got better lips than Judas
I could keep your bed warm, otherwise I'm useless
I don't really mean it, 'cause who the fuck would choose this?

Well, maybe I could hold you in the dark
You won't even notice me depart
Secondhand thread in a second hand bed
With a second man's head
Leaving through the door without a word
You won't even notice little bird
Better off dead so I reckon I'm headed to hell instead

So don't wait for me
Don't wait for me
Wait, ah

It's not a happy ending

Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me
Wait, ah

It's not a happy ending

Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me
Wait, ah

It's not a happy ending

Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me
Wait, ah

All of this is temporary
All of this is temporary

All of this is temporary
All of this is temporary

(In the dark)
(You wouldn't even notice me depart)
(Second hand thread in a second mans bed)
(With a second man's head)

All of this is temporary
All of this is temporary
All of this is
