		<p>
		  (I just wanna see you like that)
(See you like that, uh-uh)

(So if you're ready)
(And if you'll let me)
(You won't regret me)
(Champagne confetti)

'Cause you know how I like it, girl (girl)
3D (woo)
You know how I like it, girl (girl)
3D (woo)

One (so), I'm missing (you know how I like it)
Two, dimensions
One, I'm missing (you know how I like it)
Two, dimensions
One, I'm missing (you know how I like it)
Two, dimensions

Like it girl
3D
You know how I like it girl
3D
'Cause you know how I like it girl (ooh)
3D
You know how I like it girl
3D

I'm on my Jung Kook, take a chick off one look
And when they get took, they don't ever get untook
When I seen that body, you would think it was a dead body
The way I told my boys, "Come look"
I used to take girls up to Stony Brook
And steal they hearts like some crook, true story
Now when I hold somebody's hand it's a new story
All my ABGs get cute for me
I had one girl (one girl), too boring
Two girls, that was cool for me
Three girls, damn, dude's horny
Four girls, okay, now you whorin'
(Hey, hey) I'm loose (hey)
I done put these shrooms to good use
I done put my city on my back
And the world know my name, I'm the truth

So if you're ready
And if you'll let me
I wanna see it
In motion
In 3D
You won't regret me
Champagne confetti
I wanna see it
In motion
In 3D (show it to me, girl, now)

'Cause you know how I like it, girl (how do you like it? Right)
3D (woo)
You know how I like it, girl (girl)
3D (woo)
You know how I like it, girl (girl)
(Spy Kids) 3D (woo)
You know how I like it, girl (girl)
3D (woo)

I got you playin' with yourself on camera
You my bae, just like Tampa
Speaking of bucks, I got those
And as for fucks, well, not those, and as for thots 
Well, do you really wanna know? I thought so
I'll fly you from Korea to Kentucky
And you ain't gotta guarantee me nothing, I just wanna see if I get lucky
I just wanna meet you in the physical and see if you would touch me

You know how I like it
3D (woo)

You know how I like it, girl
(You know how I like it) 3D (woo)
You know how I like it, girl
(You know how I like it) 3D (woo)
You know how I like it, girl
3D (woo)

So if you're ready
And if you'll let me
I wanna see it
In motion
In 3D (woo)
You won't regret me
Champagne confetti (champagne confetti)
I wanna see it
In motion
In 3D (show it to me, girl, now)

'Cause you know how I like it, girl (how do you like it? Right)
3D
You know how I like it, girl (oh, yeah)
(Alright) 3D (woo)
'Cause you know how I like it, girl
(You know how I like it, alright) 3D
You know how I like it, girl (oh, yeah)
(Alright) 3D (woo)

You know how I like it
(Time zone)
You know how I like it
(Time zone)
You know how I like it
(Time zone)
You know how I like it
