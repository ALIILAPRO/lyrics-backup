		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dimitri, Mike and 
Gucci

Laying on the front lawn, vibing to the bassdrum
Sipping on a 40
And someone's on the rooftop, lighting up like Snoop Dogg
And it's only Tuesday
And we just wanna unwind from this semi-charmed life, baby, baby
I don't need, I don't need nothing else
I don't need, I don't need nothing else

We don't have to wake up 'cause we didn't sleep
I still got a full cup of that Hennessy
All my friends by my side
Is all I need in my life
5am and we still feeling reckless
Pile up in the whip getting breakfast
All my friends by my side
Is all I need in my life

All my friends by my side
Is all I need in my life

I just wanna show you how to win, let me coach you
I'm just trying to turn you, baby, turn you to my soldier
Trying to help you prosper, I'm a trail profit
You know they really pocket, they don't really got it
I just wanna see you shop, shop 'til you drop
Pull out with a title, top drop of the lot
She don't want to lead though while she know to not eat
So once the plot thicks so does Gucci's hard dick

We don't have to wake up 'cause we didn't sleep
I still got a full cup of that Hennessy
All my friends by my side
Is all I need in my life
5am and we still feeling reckless
Piled up in the whip getting breakfast
All my friends by my side
Is all I need in my life

All my friends by my side
Is all I need in my life

I just wanna have a good time in this semi-charmed life, baby, baby
I don't need, I don't need nothing else
I don't need, I don't need nothing else

We don't have to wake up 'cause we didn't sleep
I still got a full cup of that Hennessy
All my friends by my side
It's all I need in my life
5am and we still feeling reckless
Piled up in the whip getting breakfast
All my friends by my side
Is all I need in my life
