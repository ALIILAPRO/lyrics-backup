		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'd barely seen you when you asked me if I hated you
Wasn't surprised but still had nothing I could say to you
I'm sorry if I ever made you feel the way you do

Yeah, I know I know you better than your parents
I heard about 'em, you don't gotta be embarrassed
You go online 'cause that's where you can be the saddest
You've been acting careless

Now you put on a happy face
You need someone who's gonna stay
I know you're crushed under the weight
Wanna hold you up
Wanna hold you up
You keep things bottled up inside
I wish you'd give someone a try
You fell apart a million times
Wanna hold you up
Wanna hold you up
Before my heart gives out, mm

You're losing track of all the friends I know you used to have
Don't know what happened but the old you wasn't half as bad
I'm sorry no one sees what's going on inside your head

Yeah, I know I know you better than your parents
I heard about 'em, you don't gotta be embarrassed
You go online 'cause that's where you can be the saddest
You've been acting careless

Now you put on a happy face
You need someone who's gonna stay
I know you're crushed under the weight
Wanna hold you up
Wanna hold you up
You keep things bottled up inside
I wish you'd give someone a try
You fell apart a million times
Wanna hold you up
Wanna hold you up
Before my heart gives out

I know that you hate when I figure you out
You get so distant just so you can hear a sound
Swear that you've been gone but yet your body's still around
What are you doing now?

Now you put on a happy face
You need someone who's gonna stay
I know you're crushed under the weight
Wanna hold you up
Wanna hold you up
You keep things bottled up inside
I wish you'd give someone a try
You fell apart a million times
Wanna hold you up
Wanna hold you up
Before my heart gives out
