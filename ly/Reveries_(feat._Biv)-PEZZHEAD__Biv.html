		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dream trilogies
Detailed memory
No panicking
Welcome reveries
The menacing eyes that follow me
The menacing eyes that follow me
Haunt me like the ghost on the radio
The screams that ring like a telephone
Haunt me like a ghost on the radio
Haunt me like a ghost on the radio
Stays in my head
(My head)
Once words you said
(You said)
To burn my flesh
Again
(Again)
You wanna focus
I never could notice
Only you chose it
Emotions they folding
I couldn't hold it
The thought is too potent
Don't act like you hopeless
Your feelings is loaded
(I know)
Leave me in the back drop
Sitting in the back lot
Living off the Black top
Would it
Make you feel more like a last thought?
Poppin till the lungs stop
Till my fuckin' breathe drop
Should it?
She been shrieking for an hour straight
Her skin gone grey like council estate
Now she clawing at the wall like an animal
Blood burns through the floor like its chemical
With spread arms like crucifix
She floats up
You pray
The Father taketh away
This possession
(Possession)
See me untied
(Tied)
Far too alive
(Live)
Far too kind
(Far too kind)
Far to climb
"I'd rather die than live this"
A plea to you; Her final breath
(A breath)
I'd rather die than like this
A Baphomet has taken it
(Dream trilogies
Detailed memory-y-y)
No panicking
Welcome reveries
(I know)
The menacing eyes that follow me
The menacing eyes that follow me
(That follow me)
Haunt me like a ghost on the radio
(On the radio)
The screams that ring like a telephone
Haunt me like a ghost on the radio
Haunt me like the ghost on the radio
The screams that ring like a telephone
Haunt me like a ghost on the radio
Haunt me
