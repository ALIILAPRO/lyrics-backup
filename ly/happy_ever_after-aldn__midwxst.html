		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  i swear we talk all the time
feel like an actor
i got no sense of time
what am i after?
tell me that you meant it
wrong answer
acting like i'll fix it
you got it backwards
you know we talked last night
what'd you do after 
i got no sense of time
lost in the laughter 
tell me that i'm worth it
make it matter 
i wish that i was perfect 
happy every after 

cause we talk all the time
feel like an actor
i got no sense of time
what am i after?
tell me that you meant it
wrong answer
acting like i'll fix it
you got it backwards
and when you called last night
i didn't answer 
i got no sense of time
lost in the laughter
tell me that i'm worth it
make it matter 
i wish that i was perfect
happy ever after

and now the sadness turn to anger
what's the matter?
i served my love upon a platter 
but that shit shattered 
you notice how u mind my business
bitch you're a witness 
all the work i put into this
shit made me lifeless 
yea i see they try to judge me
but are they happy? 
i know they're everything i could be
but i just wanna feel free
 maybe it's not worth it 
i'm just a bother
i wanna live my life happy ever after

cause we talk all the time
feel like an actor
i got no sense of time
what am i after?
tell me that you meant it
wrong answer
acting like i'll fix it
you got it backwards
and when you called last night
i didn't answer 
i got no sense of time
lost in the laughter
tell me that i'm worth it
make it matter 
i wish that i was perfect
happy ever after

MIDWXST:
my mind drifts away to a vacant place 
i wanna talk but it's hard for me i'm too afraid 
i don't believe in myself i think that imma waste
you left me broken yea you left me in some disarray 
i know you might think that i'm a fuck up
i run my mouth like it never seem to shut up
my feelings run away and i can't seem to catch up 
i'm tryna leave all this stress and all this pressure 
try to build a wall but it came crashing right down 
i standing in my silence i will not make a sound no 
all these thoughts go inside my head spin around but 
it's so hard to let my guard back up when it's down
no feeling in my chest i cant feel my heart pulsing 
you know i'm in pain you already know i'm hurting 
there's a hole inside of my heart as deep as the ocean 
putting on an effort so long imma close the curtains

ALDN:
cause we talk all the time
feel like an actor
i got no sense of time
what am i after?
tell me that you meant it
wrong answer
acting like i'll fix it
you got it backwards
and when you called last night
i didn't answer 
i got no sense of time
lost in the laughter
tell me that i'm worth it
make it matter 
i wish that i was perfect
happy ever afterw
