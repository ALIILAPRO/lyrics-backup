		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna be loved by you, just you
And nobody else but you
I wanna be loved by you, alone!
Boop-boop-a-doop!

I wanna kissed by you, just you
Nobody else but you
I wanna be kissed by you, alone!

Boop-boop, I couldn't aspire
To anything higher
Than, filled with desire
To make you my own!
Boop-boop-a-doop, boop-boop-a-doop!

I wanna be loved by you, just you
And nobody else but you
I wanna be loved by you, alone!

Aa-ah-um! Boop-boop-a-doop!

Daddle-at-dat-dat-dumb, I couldn't aspire
To anything higher
Than, filled with desire
To make you my own
Bup-bum, butle-doodle-dumb-bum!

I wanna be loved by you, just you
Nobody else but you
I wanna be loved by you, a-lup-a-dup-a-dup-a-dup!
Boop-boop-a-doop
