		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I wonder where our lives go
They question who we used to be
Sometimes I feel like I'm the oxygen between
The cigarette and gasoline

I can't sleep 'cause what if I dream
Of going back to San Diego
We bought a one way ticket
So we could go see the Cure
And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot
And think of every person I ever lost in San Diego (to San Diego)
Can't go back to San Diego (can't go back to San Diego)

Abandoned houses with the lights on (oh, oh, oh)
Late at night I call your name (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Abandoned love songs smashed across the hardwood floors
I read the sadness on your face

I can't sleep 'cause what if I dream
Of going back to San Diego
We bought a one way ticket
So we could go see the Cure
And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot
And think of every person I ever lost in San Diego (to San Diego)
Can't go back to San Diego (can't go back to San Diego)

I never needed to hear
All of the pain and the fear
Your secrets filled up my ears
Like the ocean blue
I never wanted to know
How deep these cuts on you go
And like a river they flow 
To the ocean blue

Going back to San Diego
We bought a one way ticket
So we could go see the Cure
And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot
And think of every person I ever lost at San Diego (San Diego) (to San Diego)
Can't go back to San Diego (San Diego) (can't go back to San Diego)
