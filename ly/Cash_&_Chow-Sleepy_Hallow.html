		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Patek and panicked
I be fixin' shit up like mechanic
(Oh my Lord, it's Great John)
I cannot come through the front with no backend
Was a dummy now she double backin'
Please, do not give me your heart, I'ma, uh
Please, do not give me your heart, I'ma, uh

She took a flight for the Patek and panicked
I be fixin' shit up like mechanic
I hit it once, she gon' keep comin' back in
She be throwin' that shit, quarterbackin'
I cannot come through the front with no backend
Was a dummy, now she double backin'
Please do not give me your heart, I'ma, uh
Please don't give me your heart, I'ma crack it

Baby, I'm not one of those
Uh, I can't be trustin' these hoes
Uh, I put my trust in the dough
Feel like Uzi, I rock and roll
She said she love me, I already know
Said she love me, girl, I gotta go
I'm with my muddies, I'm back on the, uh
I'm with my muddies, I'm back on the road
Wait, I feel like Cash and Chow
It's too slizzy when I get around
She get it up and I'm puttin' it down
Said she never been to pound town
And she not alone, yeah, she came a buddy
My bitch bad 'cause I know it get ugly
And I'm gettin' deady, I feel like a mummy
Empty heart, you should fill it with money
Comedian guy, he keep thinkin' he funny
I'ma laugh when you turn to a duppy
Don't be cappin' like you really love me
Don't be actin' like you really, wait

She took a flight for the Patek and panicked
I be fixin' shit up like mechanic
I hit it once, she gon' keep comin' back in
She be throwin' that shit, quarterbackin'
I cannot come through the front with no backend
Was a dummy now she double backin'
Please do not give me your heart, I'ma, uh
Please don't give me your heart, I'ma crack it
Please do not give me your heart, I'ma, uh
Please don't give me your heart, I'ma crack it
Please do not give me your heart, I'ma, uh
Please don't give me your heart, I'ma crack it
Please don't give me your heart, I'ma
Give me your heart, I'ma crack it
Give me your heart, I'ma
Give me your heart, I'ma

She took a flight for the Patek and panicked
I be fixin' shit up like mechanic
I hit it once, she gon' keep comin' back in
She be throwin' that shit, quarterbackin'
I cannot come through the front with no backend
Was a dummy, now she double backin'
Please do not give me your heart, I'ma, uh
Please don't give me your heart, I'ma crack it
