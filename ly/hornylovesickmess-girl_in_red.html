		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm in New York, thinking of you
Wondering what you are up to
From this lonely-ass hotel room
With a pretty good lookin' view

I am somewhere in the states
Going somewhere on a plane
It doesn't really matter as long as I'm
Always far away

Or maybe on a bus for months straight
Shit's fun but I'm going insane
Like it's been months since I've had sex
I'm just a horny little lovesick mess

And I don't wanna be the type of person who calls you up
Every time I need to get off but
I guess that's who I'm turning into
Oh fuck

Down at Times Square in the rain
There's a billboard with my face
It's so weird how things have changed
Think about it every day

If I ever make it back
Will I find what we once had?
Guess I ruined us pretty bad
Oh-whoa

I'm in the same city as you
But I still don't come through
'Cause I've got so much to do
And that's the shittiest excuse

So don't ever take me back
Let's just face the fact
I treated you like trash
And you deserve more than that

My love comes out at midnight
My love comes out at midnight

My love comes out at midnight
My love comes out at midnight
My love comes out at midnight
