		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have you read the message, the writing on the wall
Could it be the answer, the answer to it all
What's going down in heaven, I'm playing with your head
Don't believe them when they tell you, you'd be better off dead

Living in the thunder driving me insane
Can I get a witness to take away the pain
Walking on the water going nowhere fast
Feeling like I'm walking with no shoes on broken glass
You know it

You don't have to leave me lights on
I'm so used to being blind
No more goodbyes or yesterdays
So it's I'll see you tomorrow, I'll see you tomorrow

Welcome to the sideshow, I'll cut to the chase
Yeah I can hear you thinking it's going all to waste
I don't mean to offend you when I look you in the eyes
What's all this commotion? It leaves me mystified

Chasing all the rainbows falling from the sky
I know your intentions are all a bunch of lies
I'm running out of patience, falling off track
You better start to worry, 'cause I may not make it back
All right now

You don't have to leave me the lights on
I'm so used to being blind
One good reason to blow me away
So it's, I'll see you tomorrow, I'll see you tomorrow

Can it wait 'til tomorrow?
'Cause tomorrow never comes...

Living in the big house, dying by the rail
If I wanted your opinion I'd call you in hell
Could that be the mailman knockin' on the door
Or just another lightweight finally evening the score
You know it

You don't have to leave me the lights on
Now I'm so used to being blind
No more goodbyes or yesterdays
So it's, I'll see you tomorrow
No more good reasons to blow you away
So it's I'll see you tomorrow
