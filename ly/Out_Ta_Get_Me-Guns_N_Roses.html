		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been hidin' out
And layin' low
It's nothing new ta me
Well you can always find a place to go
If you can keep your sanity
They break down the doors
And they rape my rights but
They won't touch me
They scream and yell
And fight all night
You can't tell me
I lose my head
I close my eyes
They won't touch me
'Cause I got somethin'
I been buildin' up inside
For so fuckin' long

They're out ta get me
They won't catch me
I'm fucking innocent
They won't break me

Sometimes it's easy to forget where you're goin'
Sometimes it's harder to leave
And every time you think you know just what you're doin'
That's when your troubles exceed
They push me in a corner
Just to get me to fight but
They won't touch me
They preach and yell and fight all night
You can't tell me
I lose my head
I close my eyes
They won't touch me
'Cause I got somethin' I been buildin' up inside
I'm already gone!

They're out ta get me
They won't catch me
I'm innocent
They won't break me

Some people got a chip on their shoulder
And some would say it was me
But I didn't buy that a fifth of whiskey that you gave me
So I'd be quick to disagree

They're out to get me
They won't catch me
I'm fucking innocent
They won't break me
They're out to get me
They won't catch me
'Cause I'm innocent

So, you can suck me
Take that one to heart
