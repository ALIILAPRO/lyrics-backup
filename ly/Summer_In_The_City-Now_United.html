		<p>
		  It's Now United
Redone
Let's get it started
Let's go!

Hey, the city streets 
Are burning up our feet
As we, as we running wild
As we, as we running wild
Hey, just like the sun
We're gonna blaze it up
Cali-California style
Cali-California style (uh, ha)

I know you feel it like I feel it 
It's the right time
With everywhere you go
(Uh) out the sunroof we can catch a summer vibe
Here with me, it's always home
Turn it up and keep it popping for the whole night
Going so hot, burn to go
Just let it go and close your eyes, we'll be alright
Yeah yeah, haha (eh, eh, eh)

Summer in the city
We'll be looking pretty
Going at it all night
Summer in the city
Sing it to me, baby
Do-do-do-doo
Summer in the city
We'll be looking pretty
Underneath the sunlight
Tell me what you want (ahh)
I know what you want (ahh)

Summer in the city
We'll be looking pretty
Going at it all night
Summer in the city
Sing it to me, baby
Do-do-do-doo
Summer in the city
We'll be looking pretty
Underneath the sunlight
Tell me what you want
(Just tell me what you want girl)
I know what you want
(I know what you want girl)

Hey, one thing is true
The summer has no rules
It's just, it's just how we live
It's just, it's just how it is
Hey, I got a wish
Before the autumn hits
Promise, promise, don't forget
All the, all the, we did

I know you feel it like I feel it 
It's the right time
With everywhere you go
(Uh) out the sunroof we can catch a summer vibe
Here with me, it's always home
Turn it up and keep it popping for the whole night
Going so hot, burn to go
Just let it go and close your eyes, we'll be alright
Yeah yeah, haha (eh, eh, eh)

Summer in the city
We'll be looking pretty
Going at it all night (all night, all night)
Summer in the city
Sing it to me, baby
Do-do-do-doo (like do-do-do-doo)
Summer in the city
We'll be looking pretty
Underneath the sunlight 
(Tell me what you want)
Tell me what you want
(Just tell me what you want girl)
I know what you want
(I know what you want girl)

Summer in the city (ohh)
We'll be looking pretty
Going at it all night
Summer in the city
Sing it to me, baby
Do-do-do-doo (do-do-do-doo)
Summer in the city
We'll be looking pretty
Underneath the sunlight
Tell me what you want
Just tell me what you want girl
I know what you want
I know what you want girl

Summer in the city
You'll be looking pretty
Going at it all night
Summer in the city
Sing it to me, baby
Do-do-do-doo (like do-do-do-doo)
Summer in the city
You'll be looking pretty
Underneath the sunlight (underneath the sunlight)
(Tell me what you want)
Just tell me what you want girl
(I know what you want)
I know what you want girl

Summer in the city (yeah)
We'll be looking pretty
Going at it all night (we'll be going at it all night)
Summer in the city
Sing it to me, baby
Do-do-do-doo (sing it to me, sing it to me) (sing it to me baby)
Summer in the city
We'll be looking pretty
Underneath the sunlight (underneath, yeah)
Tell me what you want
Just tell me what you want girl
I know what you want
I know what you want girl
