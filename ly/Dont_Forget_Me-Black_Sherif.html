		  (London)
Ay, ay
Kk, hey
Ay, yeah

Let's make some memories, girl
I don't know when a man is gonna see you again
I don't know when I'm leaving but it's not too far from today
Let me be a favori before I leave so you don't forget me
Come hold my hand, look in my eyes and say to me something

It's time to say goodbye
But you know this is not the end, I'll see you someday
You will be in my arms
Even when they get to take my life
Heaven is not far away
I'll see you someday
And we'll have a good time

Let's make some memories, girl
I don't know when a man is gonna see you again
I don't know when I'm leaving but it's not too far from today
Let me be a favori before I leave so you don't forget me
Come hold my hand, look in my eyes and say to me something

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Watching me go (watching me go)
Might not be easy for you (easy for you)
But I need to go
You and I know
Girl, I'm not from this side
Ebi life carry me come here o
And I need to go back
I no fit stay here for long

So let's make some memories, girl
I don't know when a man is gonna see you again (memories, girl)
(Memories, memories)
I don't know when I'm leaving but it's not too far from today
Let me be a favori before I leave so you don't forget me
Come hold my hand, look in my eyes and say to me something

So let's make some memories, girl
I don't know when a man is gonna see you again
(Memories, memories girl)
I don't know when I'm leaving but it's not too far from today
Let me be a favori before I leave so you don't forget me
Come hold my hand, look in my eyes and say to me something

(Rewind and come in)
