		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'd like to be, together we'll talk
I'd like to be, together we'll walk
I'd like to be, together we'll find a way
I can see the force in your eyes

I wanna be, together we dream
I wanna be, together we swim
And I wanna be, together we'll find a way
I can see the force in your eyes

And no excuses
I've tried to do my best
Now I cannot run
Follow the road into the lake

I wanna be, together we fly
I wanna be, together we die
And I wanna be, together we'll find a way
I can see the force in your eyes

And no excuses
I've tried to do my best
Now I cannot run
Follow the road into the lake

Look at that smile on her face
Now I cannot stop
To watch her
Sleeping in my hands

I feel so sorry
'Cause I'm not so strong
And you tell me I'm wrong
I feel so empty
But I want to become
So strong, so strong
I want to become
So strong
