		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How many times should I stop and believe in myself,
I dont believe much in anything.
Ive seen enough of the pain and the shame and the blame,
It dont amount up to anything.
Now I,
Rewind back to a time where I could do anything and pay any price.
And I,
Need time cause' im starting to think that the promises aint worth the sacrifice

And theres nothing for me here.
Theres nothing for me here.

How many nights should I walk in my sleep,
and I dream of how much I wanna run away (wanna run away)
Ive had enough of the stress and the mess
I cant take anymore I gotta getaway
Now I,
Know why im empty inside and im sure ive only got myself to blame.
And I,
Dont try to view the lies its just a waste of time i'll never be the same

Theres nothing for me here.
Theres nothing for me here.
Theres nothing for me here.
I gave you my life and its fading away.
Theres nothing for me here.
I gave you my life just to fade away.

And I cant go on.
And I cant explain.
What everyones going on,
lifes falling away.
And I cant rewind.
And theres no escape.
Its been so long and I just dont feel the same.

Theres nothing for me here.
Theres nothing for me here.
Theres nothing for me here.
I gave you my life and its fading away.
Theres nothing for me here.
I gave you my life just to fade away.
How many times should I stop and belive in myself,
I dont belive much in anything.
Theres nothing for me here.
Theres nothing for me here.
I gave you my life just to fade away.
