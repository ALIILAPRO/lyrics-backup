		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tastes bitter on a guilty tongue
It's hard to see I'm the chosen one
Fake friends with a camera phone
Ugly, drunk, cold, and missing home

This home of mine, I see it in my dreams
Where everyone looks happy and everyone still likes me
This home of mine, I miss it all the time
What happened to this family? 
What happened to this family? (If I let you down)

Texts, calls, hugs, birthday cards
Being thoughtful can be so hard
First fifteen years, I'm the favorite son
Last fifteen years, I'm the hated one

This heart of mine gets blacker all the time
Affection makes me nauseous, believe me, I don't want this
I hurt my blood tonight, I made my sisters cry
I never say I love you, even though I want to

I'm just my father's son, my mother's kid
A shitty brother, I'm nobody's friend
This is all my fault, I only make you cry
I don't deserve this family, you're better off without me

'Cause I let you down, and I lost my fucking mind
Then everything got messy, and everyone got angry
I cursed my blood tonight, it happens all the time
Is everyone against me? Has everyone God damned me?

What happened to this family?
What happened to this family?
What happened to this family?
What happened to this family?

Don't hate me, don't hate me
Don't let me drown

I hate goodbyes, so cringey I could die
We only say "I love you", 'cause that's what we're supposed to
And most families lie, but I meant it every time
I treat you like you're worthless, I never said I'm perfect
