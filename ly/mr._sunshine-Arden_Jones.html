		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm sorry I'm not Mr. Sunshine
All jokes, 'til I start feeling like the punchline
I know that you want Mr. Optimistic, that ain't realistic
I ain't Mr. Sunshine
Na-na-na-na

Do my smile keep you around?
How about when it's upside down?
How about when I'm in bed four or five days
Will you love me now?
I bet money you'd smell cyanide in my honey
Watch me cry at night and then roll your eyes
'Til you decide to start runnin', oh

I'll be ready when you let me
Don't forget me, maybe I ain't what I was then

I'm sorry I'm not Mr. Sunshine
All jokes, 'til I start feeling like the punchline
I know that you want Mr. Optimistic, that ain't realistic
I ain't Mr. Sunshine
Na-na-na-na
I'm sorry I'm not Mr. Sunshine, so low
And I might be here for a long time
I know that you want Mr. Optimistic, that ain't realistic
I ain't Mr. Sunshine
Na-na-na-na

'Member the time that I told you, your troubles are mine?
And I'd hold you down, stick around
Now you nowhere to be found
Now you want rainbows, I'm a hurricane, a tornado
Full of hurt and pain, and we don't hurt the same
But I still care if you're okay though, oh

I'll be ready when you let me
Don't forget me, maybe I ain't what I was then

I'm sorry I'm not Mr. Sunshine
All jokes, 'til I start feeling like the punchline
I know that you want Mr. Optimistic, that ain't realistic
I ain't Mr. Sunshine
Na-na-na-na
I'm sorry I'm not Mr. Sunshine, so low
And I might be here for a long time
I know that you want Mr. Optimistic, that ain't realistic
I ain't Mr. Sunshine
Na-na-na-na
