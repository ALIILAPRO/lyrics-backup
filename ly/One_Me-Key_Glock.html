Got money on my mind and a bag on his head
These niggas some snakes, I can see them shed
If that nigga a snake, then cut off his head (yeah, cut off his head)
Hold up, let me take my meds

Lil' nigga hit a block, them boys fled
Put a brick on his head just like Craig

When I wake up it's a money-makin' mission
You ain't talkin' 'bout money, then zip it (shut up)
Money talkin' right now, need to listen (hush)
Niggas talk too much, I keep my distance (yup)
Niggas talkin', gossip more than bitches (damn)

Glizock not a hit, it's a go (go)
Glizzock not your average Joe (no)
Why the fuck you buy two Rolls? (Two Rolls) 
Low key, I'm workin' on three (on three)
I was fourteen, mouth full of gold (gold)
