		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's too early to close the party 
Into the ring
Come into the ring

Shak-a-Boom 着火 microphone, ride in this flow (hey)
Kick off the festa, such a nitro bomb (hey)
始まりの合図から it's so long (hey)
終わりまで beat goes on (oh)
Test one, two, set けっ飛ばした bran-new sense (hey)
Everybody, come with me, climb over the fence (hey)
To the break your dull, it's a 超倍転 (hey) 
くだけ散ろ ちゃちな境界線もう

Whoa, get your hands up, fat the beat
Whoa, get your hands up, fantasy
Bring it on down

Let it go, ready or not, let me mo' rock (hey)
Kick it the lyric, lady, go loud (hey)
This rhyme and beats gonna change your mind (hey)
そこらじゅうに英知 on line (oh)

Heat up your heart beat like daftly
Presume the rhythm, gonna be free (hey)
俺たちが lilies in the place to be (hey)
今はただ just rockin' mean to sing mo'

Whoa, get your hands up, wanna be
Whoa, get your hands up, fantastic

One time organize, Lily the nation
Over night vast creation
From the TMC foundation, it's a ejaculation
Two time border line 突破 熱唱 
終わらない creation
From the TMC foundation
On the rock' 'n' roll foundation

Whoa
The voice whirled away everything 'bout pleasure and sorrow
Far reaches of the sky
Whoa 
The voice whirled away everything 'bout pleasure and sorrow
Far reaches of the sky

It's too early to close the party 
Into the ring
Come into the ring

So check this out
ともせ put your lights on for the nice song (hey)
It is not over, yeah, look at my zone (hey)
この場所からまた party line (hey)
続けようぜ highに dive (whoa)

Shake 揺らせ body movin', you're the next
Tricky で freaky breakin', who the best?
楽しみたきゃほら up and down (hey)
見せつけな Lily is in the "Run and Gun" go

Whoa, get your hands up, fat the beat
Whoa, get your hands up, fantasy
Whoa, get your hands up, wanna be
Whoa, get your hands up, fantastic

One time organize, Lily the nation
Over night vast creation
From the TMC foundation, it's a ejaculation
Two time border line 突破 熱唱 
終わらない creation
From the TMC foundation
On the rock' 'n' roll foundation

Whoa
The voice whirled away everything 'bout pleasure and sorrow
Far reaches of the sky
Whoa 
The voice whirled away everything 'bout pleasure and sorrow
Far reaches of the sky
Far reaches of the sky
Far reaches of the sky
Far reaches of the sky
Far reaches of the sky
