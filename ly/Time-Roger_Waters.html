		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The voice had been there all along
Hidden in the stones, in the rivers 
Hidden in all the books
Hidden in plain sight
It was the voice of reason

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

Tired of lying in the sunshine
Staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long
And there is time to kill today
And then one day you find
Ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run
You missed the starting gun

You run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
And racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter
Never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to nought
Or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desparation is the english way
The time is gone
The song is over
Thought I'd something more to say

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
And far away, across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells
