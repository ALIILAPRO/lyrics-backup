		  Yessir, baby, On The Radar Radio freestyles
Yo, Sleepy Hallow in the building
I'ma step out, he gon' step in

Hold on
It's a wrap when I get in my zone, start glitchin'
They play with that boy and he clickin'
Smack a nigga like Will, I ain't have me a Smith'n
I was tryna bag it and flip it
Say you love me, I'm onto you bitches
They don't love me, they lovin' the riches
Had to chill, I was movin' too vicious
I gave Fresh one, I don't need two bitches
Brand new glizzy, I make it extend
Slip once, I ain't fallin' again
Cut you off, we ain't talkin' again
And I came in a Lamb but I left in a Benz
Fuck it up, I was born to win
Back then I just felt I was born to spin
If I up it he gone again
I told bro to get 'em he do it again
Let me stop, I been focused on money
'Cause mommy ain't raise no dummy
I do this for days, I was broke and bummy
Had a gun, I ain't have no honey
I slid on the jakes that day the got on me
Where I'm from, you get shot by your homie
Where I'm from, you can't hang, you don't know me
You gotta move tact when you slide on yo' doley
Lil' bro used to hop out the, hol' on

Baby, I'm back for real
I'm movin' tact for real
"What's that?" Girl that's the strap for real
Don't lack, that's how you get killed
But you ain't gotta be in the field
You could go to school and be real
You got a nine to five, so what?
Tell 'em niggas you could pay bills
Fuck it, I'm livin' life like I love it
Sometimes I just wanna dub it
Shorty a eater, I ain't tryna cuff it
What you talkin' soundin' like rubbish
I don't like parties, I don't like clubbin
If I go then the Glock comin'
(Uh, what, if I go then the Glock, hol' on)
Gotta watch who call yo' girl
Gotta watch who call ya mans
Lil' nigga the world is yours
Make some money then do it again
She try to play you, don't want you to win
It's gon' hurt when you fuckin' her friend
You should ask her where she wanna cry
In a Lamb or up in a bed
Heard the feds all up on my head
They said that we let it off and we fled
You think Sleepy gon' tell on the gang?
I'm like, "Nigga, I'd rather be dead"
Like fuck it, I'd rather be gone
Don't forget who was puttin' you on
Had ya chance but you took too long
Like I gotta chill, can't do too wrong, like
Like baby, I'm not one of them
Kiss and tell, we ain't fuckin' again
He a rat, I can't trust him again
If he snitch once, he be snitchin' again
Body different, I said it again
I been growing up, clippin' my ends
They like Sleepy he did it a, uh
They like Sleepy he did it again
