		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember the time, the days long ago
Before the cold set in and
The rivers still flowed
When we would sing by the warm fire light
No fear of the frost nor a fear of the ice
When Bitingcold ruled before their
Kin driven mad the Age of Desolation

Our protectors, our warriors
Our shields, our pride
Our strength never bending
With them by our side

Now we have but one goal
One thing which to strive
Only one goal is at hand
And that is to survive

Lying deep in the desert where reptiles run
She flies over head, silhouetted in sun
Shifting the sands, bright blue in the night
She'll rise up again
Hallowed in the moonlight
Now Thunderclaps loose there's no
Where to hide
Her thunder and lightening rain
Fire from the sky

Our protectors our warriors
Our shields no more the Age of Desolation
An epoch of war

Now we have but one goal
One thing which to strive
Only one goal is at hand
And that is to survive

Powerful, brazen, Old Toroshivar
The first Lord of Dragons
His mind driven far
With Shardscale to blame for all to behold
What once was our home is now dead, fire
And cold
Survive if you can the realms of our land
Survive this Age of Desolation

We have but one goal
One thing which to strive
Only one goal is at hand
And that is to survive we have but one goal
One thing which to strive
Only one goal is at hand
And that is to survive
