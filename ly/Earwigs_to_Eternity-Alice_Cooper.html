		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, four years long
And oh, what a song to hear, my dear
Four long years
Now we start to hear a whisper

Alice Cooper
All of the time we have
All of the time we had you
All of the time we have
All of the time we have

We are throwing all of our hands so high
You out there
[two voices at the same time]
Singing (playing) ditties (lovely) beautiful song (what a little song)
for you to be aware

Oh what a time we have
All of the time we have you
Oh what a time we have
All of the time we have
All of the time we have you

You're the one you're looking for
Let me in, let me in
Who's there, who's there, who's there
