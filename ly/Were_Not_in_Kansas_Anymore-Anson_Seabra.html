		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you remember when our lives
Were all so simple?
We had the world and then
Some laying in our hands
Drive in circles around our
Hometown on the weekend
And never worried all about the bigger plan

But we're much older now
And if you look around

We're not in Kansas anymore
A different place, a distant shore
Nobody knows just what's in store
Packed all our bags and closed the door
No going back to like before
We're not in Kansas anymore

Ah, ah, ah, ah ah, ah, ah
Ah, wе're not in Kansas anymore

All the pеople here are honestly so different
And well
They never seem to look you in the eyes
And it's so easy to lose track
Of why you came here
When you're so drunk and blinded
By the city lights

But there's something 'bout this place
That makes me miss those days

We're not in Kansas anymore
A different place, a distant shore
Nobody knows just what's in store
Packed all our bags and closed the door
No going back to like before
We're not in Kansas anymore

Ah, ah, ah, ah ah, ah, ah
Ah, we're not in Kansas anymore
Ah, ah, ah, ah ah, ah, ah
Ah, we're not in Kansas anymore
