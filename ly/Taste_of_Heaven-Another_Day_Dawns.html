		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Should have been the same old story
Lovers fall in love… the end
But with you things aren’t that boring
Didn’t see the trouble I stepped in
Red flags
Don’t lie
Like the devil in your eyes
But I let your sex control me
Hooked on all your alibis
    
Should have known right from the start
Should of known just who you are
You just want a taste of Heaven
Now I’m falling from the stars
As I’m calling out your name
I want you bad but you won’t stay
You just want a taste of Heaven
Spit me out and walk away
 
Should of seen your colors changing
Like a mood ring with a curse
Slip you on and you’re an angel
Slip you off it’s in reverse
No air
Can’t breath
Still tied up in your sheets
Pray to God somebody saves me
You locked the door and threw away the key
 
Should have know right from the start
Should of known just who you are
You just want a taste of Heaven
Now I’m falling from the stars
As I’m calling out your name
I want you bad but you won’t stay
You just want a taste of Heaven
Spit me out and walk away

Do, do what you best do..but don’t confuse the truth.. leaving me in the dark... 
do, do what you best do, but don’t confuse the truth.. leaving me in that dark!

Should have know right from the start
Should of known just who you are
You just want a taste of Heaven
Now I’m falling from the stars
As I’m calling out your name
I want you bad but you won’t stay
You just want a taste of Heaven
Spit me out and walk away
