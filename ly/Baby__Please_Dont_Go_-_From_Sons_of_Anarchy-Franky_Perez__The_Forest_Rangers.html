		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, please don't go 
Baby, please don't go 
Baby, please don't go
Down to New Orleans, you know I love you so 

Before I be your dog 
Before I be your dog 
Before I be your dog 
I get you way'd out here, and let you walk alone 

Turn your lamp down low 
Turn your lamp down low 
Turn your lamp down low 
I beg you all night long, baby, please don't go 

You know your man down gone 
You know your man down gone 
You know your man down gone 
Down the country farm, with all the shackles on

You brought me way down here 
You brought me way down here 
You brought me way down here 
'Bout to Rolling Forks, you treat me like a dog 

Baby, please don't go 
Baby, please don't go 
Baby, please don't go 
Down to New Orleans, I beg you all night long
