		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Keep on hating me I’m still a freak 
 They want my everything, my memories 
 
 And if I contemplate all the time that I wasted think I’ll go insane with my own sense of hatred. 
 
 And if I contemplate all the time that I wasted think I’ll go insane with my own sense of hatred. 
 
 
 Rest in peace and make some Ps
 Couple of my enemies are in the trees 
 Cause I had to find myself some space got keys to a yard that ain’t my place 
 
 I get these nightmares like everyday 
 Roses on my casket I’m in the grave
 Took some drugs they made me free at the top of the sky now I’m in too deep 
 
 I f I can’t stay if I can’t stay
 There ain’t no time to waste no time to waste 
 I won’t stop till we all decay 
 
 And if I contemplate all the time that I wasted think I’ll go insane with my own sense of hatred. 
 
 And if I contemplate all the time that I wasted think I’ll go insane with my own sense of hatred. 
 
 Posted with my demons like some angels we go fly
 Sleeping in my coffin with the dead I might die 
 Find me in the deep end searching for the weekend I can’t get no sleep I’m weeping with my demons 
 
 Find me in a dungeon with a baddie by my side 
 Riding with the devil they go lose it when I die
 Rip me into pieces be my little secret, beat it then delete it I love the way she lies 
 
 
  f I can’t stay if I can’t stay
 There ain’t no time to waste no time to waste 
 I won’t stop till we all decay 
 
 
 And if I contemplate all the time that I wasted think I’ll go insane with my own sense of hatred. 
 
 And if I contemplate all the time that I wasted think I’ll go insane with my own sense of hatred.
