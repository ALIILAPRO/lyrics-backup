		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hope you have a bad day
I hope you have a bad day

The last I heard is you was goin' through it
Smile on my face, I heard the news, yeah
I might pull up on you in a new whip
With a pretty little thing, top down, girl, you blew it
You stupid, you knew this would happen, you ruthless
I can't stop the pain, wonderin' why did we do this?
You left me for a lame and my brain can't compute it
You clueless, the truth is that

If I never seen you again, seen you again
I would be fine, fine
And I don't wanna be friends, I know how that ends
A waste of my time

I hope you have a bad day
I hope you have a bad day
I hope you have a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day
And I hope that I'm the reason for your bad day
I hope you have a bad day
I hope you have a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day
And I hope that I'm the reason

Last I heard that you was doin' tragic
Passed out in a lawn in Calabasas
Pulled up to your party just to crash it
Just to trigger you and all these fuckin' plastics, it's classic
You knew this would happen
You changed and it's drastic
I can't fix the past, wonder how it even lasted
You play like you've changed, but it's all just an act
When you really just cappin', it's facts

That if I never seen you again, seen you again
I would be fine, fine
And I don't wanna be friends, I know how that ends
A waste of my time

I hope you have a bad day
I hope you have a bad day
I hope you have a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day
And I hope that I'm the reason for your bad day
I hope you have a bad day
I hope you have a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day
And I hope that I'm the reason

I hope you have a bad day
I hope you have a bad day
I hope you have a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day
And I hope that I'm the reason
