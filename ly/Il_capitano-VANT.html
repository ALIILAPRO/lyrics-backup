		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  out, there's always an easy way out
what are you taking about?
I don't mind where you come from
I don't mind that you talk to yourself 
everyone's all on their self
tryna get out of the cold
out of the snow
how'd you grow?
how'd you get so bad?
it hurts

it's about ready to burst
when do you plan to attack?
no looking back
where you came from
all of the people are gone
under the ground
that you stand upon 
lays all 
all that you love
all that you ever loved 

glow, everyone's starting to glow
better the devil you know
now that the world doesn't work
like you thought it used to
how, how are we even alive?
how did we end up inside?
all of this time
i just can't believe my god damn eyes

it's about ready to crack
when do you plan to attack?
no looking back
where you came from
all of the people are gone
under the ground
that you stand upon
lays all
all that you love
all that you ever loved 

what did you expect from us?
il capitano
what did you expect from us? 
il capitano
what did you expect from us?
il capitano
what did you expect? 

no you can't look
don't look back
it's about ready to crack
when do you plan to attack?
no looking back
where you came from
all of the people are gone
under the ground
that you stand upon
lays all
all that you love
all that you ever loved
