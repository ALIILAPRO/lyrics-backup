		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Today, today 
There’s so many beautiful things
To see, to say
To grow in so many ways
And I'll be here waiting
When you come back around
You can tell me all about
Today

The world is full
Of so many wonderful things
Sights and sounds
And colors you can barely believe
So go on and see it
When you come back around
You can tell me all about
Today

And there might be days 
When it won't go your way
And there might be days
It rains on your parade
No matter what comes
It'll all be ok
Cause I'll always be around
You can tell me all about
Today

Ohhhhh
Ohhhhh

Today, today
There’s so many beautiful things
To see, to say
To grow in so many ways
And I'll be here waiting
When you come back around
You can tell me all about
Today
