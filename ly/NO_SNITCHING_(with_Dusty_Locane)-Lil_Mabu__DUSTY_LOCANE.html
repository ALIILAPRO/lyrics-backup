		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Say hello to my little friend)

I could never snitch (gang, gang, gang)
That's on my kids (yeah)
I put a choppa on the blade, he put a blade on a switch (gang, gang, gang)
I keep my right hand spinnin' like my last name Smith (my last name Smith)
I don't miss, I'm making money while I piss, like (gang, gang, gang)

Double M, bitch, we the fever (fever)
Dead off the muddy, go pour up a liter
Back on his head, he a Peter (Peter)
Glock-19 and I'm naming it Tina (Tina)
One-sixty on the dash, I'm checking the meter (the meter)
You better not miss, that switch leave him with amnesia (urgh)

I got a plug from the P, (free Snow), then the cops got him 
Cock run, make the block run, opps duck
I got the drop on some funds, man, I'm finna cop some (finna cop one)
I'm finna cop that icey piece from Rihanna (grah)

I got to keep it thorough, I ain't one and done
Y'all niggas dick ride, go get back for the nigga you call your friend
Cut that fake shit, all pretend
If I miss, I spin again
Spin again, spin again, and I might just hit his (shh)

I could never snitch (gang, gang, gang)
That's on my kids (yeah)
I put a choppa on the blade, he put a blade on a switch (gang, gang, gang)
I keep my right hand spinnin' like my last name Smith (my last name Smith)
I don't miss, I'm making money while I piss, like (gang, gang, gang)

Hop out the Scat', where my shooters at? Guess they running late
All my opps probably smoking rocks so I got time to waste
Picked up my pace, 'cause I saw a shop ten feet down the block (obvi)
He ain't got a lock, so I walk into it, then I saw the ball (grah, grah)
And he like, "Hi, how's your day?" I said, "I'm doing great" (hi)
Then I upped it at his face and I said, "Open up that case" (open up that case)
I took a chain, bust-down pendant too, depending on my mood (grah)
I need to run, but the final shot, I only got one too (Get out my way)
Then I saw twelve, Dusty rang my bell
He said, "What's the move?" (What's the move?)
I said, "I'm doomed"
'Cause the cops just said that if I move, they shoot
Said, "You a fool"
(If you got the jewels, then I'll be there at 2)
Now I'm pacing, and my heart is racing, don't know what to do (what do I do?)
I'm acting cool, drippy like a pool, waiting for the goons (grah)
Then I seen 05 let off two, we starting racing with the loot (we off the shit)

(Don't run, don't trip, gah)
(Don't run, don't trip, gah, gah)
Gang, gang, gang
(Grr, we started, grah)
Gang, gang, gang

I could never snitch (gang, gang, gang)
That's on my kids (yeah)
I put a choppa on the blade, he put a blade on a switch (gang, gang, gang)
I keep my right hand spinnin' like my last name Smith (my last name Smith)
I don't miss, I'm making money while I piss, like (gang, gang, gang)

How many niggas you know is ready to spin when it's time for the drama? (for drama)
I'm letting off every shot in this clip, I put that shit on my momma (grr, grr, grr)
The homies told me, "Chill out," back on his head so he dying proper (rest in piss)
We might've mixed it up with fentanyl, somebody go call him a doctor
Double Ms, what's the word? First nigga run up, get hit with that (Mabu)

And you know I ain't missing that
Got a beam on my head with a fitted mask
Pussy niggas be all for the chitter chat (they chitter-chat)
I'ma rip down the boy, knock his fitted cap (fitted cap)
Can't say no to the poles, then I'm gon' beat him down with a bat (the pole)
I put an opp in a wheelchair (uh oh), give me like an hour, I'm leaving him flat (haha, haha)
I got a custom boot with your face on it
Now he off the map (urgh)
