		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I'm walking beside her
People tell me I'm lucky
Yes, I know I'm a lucky guy
I remember the first time
I was lonely without her
Can't stop thinking about her now

Every little thing she does
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does
She does for me, ooh

When I'm with her I'm happy
Just to know that she loves me
Yes, I know that she loves me now

There is one thing I'm sure of
I will love her forever
For I know love will never die

Every little thing she does
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does
She does for me, ooh

Every little thing she does
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does
She does for me, ooh

Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little
