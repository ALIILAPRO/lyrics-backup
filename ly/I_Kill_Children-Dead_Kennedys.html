		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  God told me to skin you alive

I kill children
I love to see them die
I kill children
And make their mamas cry
Crush 'em under my car
I want to hear them scream
Feed 'em poison candy
Spoil their Halloween 

So you're in the kids' ward
You're in there 'cause you're ill
How about some Pavulon so I can see you chill 
Time to hit the school bus
I think I'll shoot out the tires
Offer them a helping hand of open telephone wires 

Ever wanted to die?
Of course you have
But I won't till I get my revenge
Been fucked far, far too many ways
I don't want to see people any more 
Things I never ever saw before
Make me see them for the shit they are
Take as many as I can away with me
Anyone can be king for a day 

So I kill children
I love to see them die
I kill children
And make their mamas cry
I kill children
I bang their heads in doors
I kill children
Can hardly wait for yours
Can hardly wait for yours
Can hardly wait for yours
Can hardly wait for yours
Can hardly wait for yours
Can hardly wait for yours
Can hardly wait for yours
Yours
