		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You, you gotta run away
And save yourself
You're so pure and golden
I'm, I'm not the one to love
I'm gonna break your heart
I'm so cruel and broken

I was an angel babe
Innocent and full of love
Someone took my heart apart 
And made an angel fall
When I look at you 
Oh I see myself
Don't let me break your heart

Stop wasting your time
A fallen angel is not an angel
Just stop wasting your time
Walk away and save yourself now

You, you can't change me baby
I've been changed already
Trust me I've tried my baby
But I can't fall for you
Now just run and save yourself

I was an angel babe
Innocent and full of love
Someone took my heart apart 
And made an angel fall
When I look at you 
Oh I see myself
Don't let me break your heart

Stop wasting your time
A fallen angel is not an angel
Just stop wasting your time
Walk away and save yourself now
Stop wasting your time
A fallen angel is not an angel
Just stop wasting your time
Walk away and save yourself now
