		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it a crime? (oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah)
That I might want 'em all? (oh, whoa)
I don't know (oh, whoa, no, no, yeah)
Just tell me, baby

Tell me, is it a crime to want them all?
How could I decide on either or?
Too many beautiful girls in this world
And up under these club lights they look even more fine, won't lie
So, is it a crime?

I just met the prettiest girl I've ever met (ooh)
Then damn near fell in love with this shawty on the left (ooh)
And seen another beauty remind me of my ex
They all look better than the best (better than the best)

I just might take me home one or two or maybe four
'Cause we all know more is more
And my hands are tied, so can somebody

Tell me, is it a crime to want them all?
How could I decide on either or?
Too many beautiful girls in this world
And up under these club lights they look even more fine, won't lie
So, is it a crime? (oh)

It doesn't mean I wouldn't be content (ooh)
If anyone of you was in my bed (ooh)
I like to call myself a gentleman (ooh)
So the door is open, hey

I just might take me home one or two or maybe four
'Cause we all know more is more (more is more)
And my hands are tied, so can somebody

Tell me, is it a crime to want them all? (to me, yeah, to them all)
How could I decide on either or? (to decide I, I, how could I?)

Too many beautiful girls in this world (in this world)
And up under these club lights they look even more fine, won't lie
So, is it a crime?
