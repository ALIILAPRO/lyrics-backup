		  (Akayfinessin)
Talk to me nice
Man-man get fried (man like SINNER)
Talk-talk to me nice
Man get fried
Talk to me nice
(Crud)
(Akayfinessin)

Talk-talk to me nice, chat properly
Got gun pon waist, it's underneath (feet)
Watch a man get fried like Kentucky (shatta)
Make my head get hot like Tommy Lee
She want a real badman, want a jangali (uh)
Gyal, jump on body like trampoline
Toxic poison like a bumblebee
Oi, look, boydem, we got company

Anywhere the killy dem there (we 'ave it)
No problem, spot them and khalas it (bullet)
Sign out, might get put in a packet
Right now, man still look in the 'matic (bullet)
Meanwhile, big G-lock, let 'em 'ave it
(Child of God, I ain't fuckin' with magic)
One fuck, now, she's movin' erratic
Yv, why these girls so dramatic?

Flirtin', I think she's onto me
Big batty gyal, must be Congolese (feet)
Massive big dick energy
When I bust three times in Tennessee (shawty)
She want a real badman, want a jangali
Goose strapped up like dungarees
Big machine can't trouble me

Talk-talk to me nice, chat properly
Got gun pon waist, it's underneath
Watch a man get fried like Kentucky
Make my head get hot like Tommy Lee
She want a real badman, want a jangali
Gyal, jump on body like trampoline
Toxic poison like a bumblebee
Oi, look, boydem, we got company

Slidin', bunnin' up, rolled in my Yeezies (outside)
Diamonds, can't get enough of my VV's (yes)
Hug me, squeeze me, I love you, habibi (uh-huh)
Ooh, she freaky, whine like a genie (uh-huh)
Gyal-gyal-gyal get friggy pon killy, get giddy (uh-huh)
She 'eard 'bout milly, bad boy like Diddy (Wha?)
Akimbo, call that Chunkz and Filly (feet)
Doa, gang dump on any (shatta)

Flirtin', I think she's onto me
Big batty gyal, must be Congolese
Massive big dick energy
When I bust three times in (feet)
She want a real badman, want a jangali
Gyal, jump on body like trampoline
Done run thru' a million, obviously when I bare back

Talk-talk to me nice, chat properly
Got gun pon waist, it's underneath
Watch a man get fried like Kentucky
Make my head get hot like Tommy Lee
She want a real badman, want a jangali
Gyal, jump on body like trampoline
Toxic poison like a bumblebee
Oi, look, boydem, we got company

Talk to me nice
Man get fried
Talk to me nice
Man get fried
