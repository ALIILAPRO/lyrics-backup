		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mm, I been up for three nights tryna plan out my life
I been livin' so wrong but I just wanna do right
It's like I did her so wrong but wanted her to be my wife
Wanna pack up my clothes, my kids and catch us a flight
They gettin' older
I never wanted them to know how it feel to come from a broken home
My fault, guess I did it all wrong
Park the Rolls truck, ain't drove that thing in a minute
I don't even know why I bought it, really hate the attention
I said it was the look on my mama face when I did it
But really it was my pride, ready to say it ain't rented
Can't get lost in the sauce, caught in money competitions
What's the point of an Instagram image when you got millions for real? 
You really got them millions for real
Seven in the mornin', my shit buzzin' and bangin'
All day my phone ring, ever since I been famous
Everybody got the perfect scheme to get us some paper
Tryna make it seem it's best for me and it ain't no favor
If it wasn't for favors, they'll never call you
Sometimes I need someone to talk to
Sometimes this life can be confusing
Call your friends and ask how they doin'

I'm coolin', most days I just be coolin'
Everybody got they own life and they own problems
This life's too short for grudges, call 'em
To the girl who got my heart forever, open my line
To my niggas down the road, one call at a time
My phone never ring to see if I'm doing fine
Even though I be so caught up on the grind
Could you call me if I ever cross your mind?
Do I ever cross your mind?
If I ever cross your mind
Call me if I ever cross your mind
Do I ever cross your mind?
If I ever cross your mind
Please, call me
