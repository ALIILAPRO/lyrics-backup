		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I fear the end has just begun
As darkness festers in my heart
I know I can’t go on
Chasing shadows in the dark

I’ve been searching for a remedy
Between the devil and the deep blue sea
Say the words and you will set me free
Before the sky is falling down on me

Take my hand
And guide me through
The valley of shadow of death
Hold on to heaven, hold on to heaven

I fear the end has just begun
As darkness festers in my heart
I know I can’t go on
Chasing shadows in the dark

I feel it crawling underneath my skin
In the dark I hear them whispering
From the shadows calling out my name
Fuel the fire going down in flames

Take my hand
And guide me through
The valley of shadow of death
Hold on to heaven, hold on to heaven

I fear the end has just begun
As darkness festers in my heart
I know I can’t go on
Chasing shadows in the dark

Chasing shadows in the dark

I’ve been searching for a remedy
Between the devil and the deep blue sea
Say the words and you will set me free
Before the sky is falling down on me

Down on me

Take my hand
And guide me through
The valley of shadow of death
Hold on to heaven, hold on to heaven
