		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Speeding across the country, in somebody else's car
Keeping a book of secrets, and taking it too far
When we were

Sleeping in motels
Of course I'm
Skipping some details
And we would
Break all the windows, to feel the wind on our skin

How long did you think we could make it
How far did you think we could take it
We couldn't be bothered
We didn't have time to think that far ahead

How long did you think we could make it
How far did you think we could take it
How bad did we want it, and good did it feel
Driving fast, until we crashed into each other's hearts

Fast until we crashed into each other's hearts

Feeling across your body, in someone else's bed
Reading our book of secrets, aloud and in our head
And we were

Sleeping in motels
Of course I'm
Skipping some details
And we would
Break all the windows, to feel the wind on our skin

How long did you think we could make it
How far did you think we could take it
We couldn't be bothered
We didn't have time to think that far ahead

How long did you think we could make it
How far did you think we could take it
How bad did we want it, and good did it feel
Driving fast, until we crashed into each other's hearts

Fast until we crashed into each other's hearts
Fast until we crashed into each other's hearts
