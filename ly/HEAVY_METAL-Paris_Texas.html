		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't chill with a bop or a bozo (alright)
I'm the one dodging bullets in slo-mo (okay)
Lil' bitch you are not at a dojo (Kung Fu) 
You can't kick it here here bitch I am JoJo (get out)
Bizarre how I move when I'm tripping
Got these tabs on my tongue like a browser 
Oh my God Louie over there spittin'
He can beat up this beat for an hour
Bitch from the city of God
Everybody you know is a fraud 
Man I stink someone spray me in BOD
I just wanted my father's applause 
I just wanted my mother's applause 
I just wanted these crackers' applause 
So I stand on the stage with the bars
So I stand on the stage with the boys

Blessed with my presence, say thanks
Little bitch, What is your rank?
Walk in my hood for a second
They might put you in the dirt
Born this way must be a curse
You dropped a song, that's the worst
She don't suck dick that's a first
She said she was playing, then she go to work 
Aim for her mouth, then I burst
Like a gun or a Semi, no you ain't fucking with me
Yeah my girls hella pretty not saditty, they self-conscious
Insecure, real high emotions
Long acrylics to hit all the roaches
But I don't give two fucks that's my bitch
Ass so fat in them jeans, it might rip
Wanna move to Atlanta, then strip 
Hold your tongue with that menacing grip
Got no Semi, no Uzi, no clip
Just a hunnid fist, jamming yo' shit, ayy
On your tombstone, we pissing lil' bitch, ayy
Since my skin, been a solar eclipse 
Grab Orion belt, then you get whipped
You my son, you my child, you my kid
SSX, let's get tricky lil' bitch
Uber coming you leaving lil' bitch
You can't get no high score in this shit
