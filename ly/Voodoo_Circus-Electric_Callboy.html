		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to the Voodoo Circus!)

You'll never forget us
Get low with all of our fellas
Oh, I got a feeling that I cannot describe
Can you see the scary faces veiled in that blurry lights?
They wanna play Hide and Seek. If you lose you are dead.
Follow the voice in your head.

And everything that I gave to you
Everything that you gave to me
We always wanna be more
More than eyes just can see
And everything that I gave to you
Everything that you gave to me
We always wanna be more
More than eyes just can see

I swear they' re never gonna get us
Get low with all of our fellas
Oh, I'm the voice in your head
I tell you how to behave
'Cause I'm the master of your dreams
I make you feel like a slave
If you try to escape Ima treat you like a toy
Agony is just for the joy

And everything that I gave to you
Everything that you gave to me
We always wanna be more
More than eyes just can see
And everything that I gave to you
Everything that you gave to me
We always wanna be more
More than eyes just can see

Can you feel the magic under spotlights of death?
Sometimes being famous feels, like a gun to your head
Can you feel the magic under spotlights of death?
Sometimes being famous feels like a gun to your head

Feels like a gun to your head
 
And everything that I gave to you
Everything that you gave to me
We always wanna be more
More than eyes just can see
And everything that I gave to you
Everything that you gave to me
We always wanna be more
More than eyes just can see

And everything that I gave to you
Everything that you gave to me
We always wanna be more
More than eyes just can see
And everything that I gave to you
Everything that you gave to me
We always wanna be more
More than eyes just can see
