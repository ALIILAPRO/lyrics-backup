		<p>
		  It is so simple Lonely always
It feels just right I can't explain it

It is so simple Lonely always
It feels just right I can't explain it
It is so simple Lonely always
It feels just right I can't explain it

It is so simple Lonely always
It feels just right I can't explain it

It is so simple Lonely always
It feels just right I can't explain it
It is so simple Lonely always
It feels just right I can't explain it

It is so simple Lonely always
It feels just right I can't explain it

It is so simple Lonely always
It feels just right I can't explain it
It is so simple Lonely always
It feels just right I can't explain it
It is so simple Lonely always
It feels just right I can't explain it
It is so simple Lonely always
It feels just right I can't explain it

It is so simple Lonely always
It feels just right I can't explain it
