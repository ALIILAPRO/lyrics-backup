		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Willow, where are you hiding now?
Willow, where are you hiding now?

In the dappled light, deep in the trees
The spiders and the centipedes
Crawl across your hands, across your knees

Willow, do you walk across the sand?
Willow, do the waves crash and fall?

And their fingers tickle at your feet
And pull a little as they retreat
Do you feel the rushing forward
Though you're standing still?

Willow, are we rushing forward, are we standing still?
Willow, are we rushing forward, are we standing still?

Willow, do you crouch among the rooftops?
Willow, listening to the city wheezing?
And your dreams, they stretch beyond the clouds
And past the moon, into the stars
Do you feel the rushing forward
Though you're standing still?

Willow, are we rushing forward, are we standing still?
Willow, does this love hold a destination?
Willow, do you feel the wind run through your hair?
Willow, do you feel the sun upon your back?
A lover's hand?
Breath
An abyss
