		  (ALTÉGO)

Baby, can't you see I'm calling?
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm falling
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm loving it

Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?

With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slipping under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?
(If you're horny, let's do it) 
And I love what you do, don't you know that you're toxic?
(Ride it, my pony)
(My saddle's waiting)
(Come and jump on it)

It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from my devil's cup
Slowly, it's taking over me

Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now?

With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slipping under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?
(If you're horny, let's do it) 
And I love what you do, don't you know that you're toxic?
(Ride it, my pony)
(My saddle's waiting)
(Come and jump on it) don't you know that you're toxic?

With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slipping under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?
(You're horny, let's do it) 
And I love what you do, don't you know that you're toxic?
(Ride it, my pony)
With a taste of a poison paradise (my saddle's waiting)
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?
(Come and jump on it)

Intoxicate me now with your loving now
I think I'm ready now (I think I'm ready now)
Intoxicate me now with your loving now
I think I'm ready now

(ALTÉGO)
