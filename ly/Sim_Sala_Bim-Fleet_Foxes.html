		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He was so kind, such a gentleman tied to the oceanside
Lighting a match on the suitcase's latch in the fading of night

Rufflde the fur of the collie 'neath the table
Ran out the door through the dark
Carved out his initials in the bark

Then the Earth shook
that was all that it took for the dream to break
All the loose ends 
would surround me again in the shape of your face

What makes me love you despite the reservations?
What do I see in your eyes
Besides my reflection hanging high?

Are you off somewhere reciting incantations?
Sim sala bim on your tongue
Carving off the hair of someone's young

Remember when you had me cut your hair?
Call me Delilah then I wouldn't care
