		  I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care, care if I'm old
I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind, I don't mind, if I don't have a mind

Get away, get away, get away
Get away, get away, away from your home
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, afraid, ghost

Even if you have, even if you need
I don't even care, we don't have to breed
We could plant a house, we could build a tree
We could have it all, we could have all three

She said, she said
She said, she said
She said, she said
She said, she said

I don't mind, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, care, care if I'm old
I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind, mind, don't have a mind

Get away, get away, get away
Get away, get away, away from your home
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, afraid, ghost

Even if you have, even if you need
I don't even care, we could have a tree
We could plant a house, we could build a tree
We could have it all, we could have all three

She said, she said
She said, she said
She said, she said
She said, she said

Even if you have, even if you need
I don't even care, we don't have to breed
We could plant a house, we could build a tree
We could have it all, we could have all three

She said, she said
She said, she said
She said, she said
She said, she said
She said, she said
She said, she said
She said
