		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the remains
Of a cadaver of days
I keep hidden away
Keep them there just in case
I wanna visit that place
Blow the dust from the bones
Off a body of years
That I leave all alone

Just a body of years

See the skin disappears
And the blood turns to stone
In a body of years
Now a pile of bones
Like a sheet of veneer
Each a piece of my soul
It's a body of years
That I leave all alone

It's just a body of years
Now a pile of bones
You know

Old soul who falls down
Can't stop trippin' on these
Old roads I go down
Get back up and

Get my foot in the door
And my face on the page
Make my mark in the world
With a bat and a blade
It's a body of work
That you can't ever change
Like a body of years
That you take to your grave

It's just a body of years
That I leave all alone
It's just a body of years
Now a pile of bones
Like a sheet of veneer
Each a piece of my soul

Old soul who falls down
Can't stop tripping on these
Old roads I go down
Get back up and I'm a (body of years)
Old soul who falls down (body of years, body of years)
Can't stop tripping on these (body of years, body of years)
Old roads (body of years, body of years)

Body of years
It's just a body of years
That I leave all alone
It's just a body of years
Now a pile of bones
Like a sheet of veneer
Each a piece of my soul
Like a pile of shit
I can't seem to forget
Just a body of years
That I leave all alone

Telltale diary pages
They unveil a ghost from the ages
When bodies of years
Were breaking from all of the weight
Of diary pages
Telltale diary pages
Oh, oh
