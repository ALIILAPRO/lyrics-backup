		  (FREAKEY!)
Yeah

I done seen so many switch like a slideshow (what?)
So I stay around the fire like a pyro (yeah, yeah)
If you wanna cross that line, cut your tight-rope (cut it)
Look my chain up in its eyes, that's a light show (woo, yeah, woo)
And there's no turning back (back)
Perc' 10, Perc' 10, fuck a heart attack (Perky, what?)
Pray my brothers reach the promised land (woo)
For them, we do the fire dance (hey, hey, hey, hey)

This shit crazy, man, right wrist, I'm revengeful
Count through a hundred bands, dead men, got a handful (yeah)
Heard he a skeleton, just counting down the time though
So Helen Keller, yeah, I can't tell no info (no, no, no, no)
Told you once (hold up), won't say it again (what?)
Hop in the Rolls-Royce and the doors open like fridge (hello)
T-t-two Rollies on my wrist, yeah, I call 'em twins (two, two, two)
Got way too used to giving more than I get
Hundred problems, I can't solve 'em
But if they switch sides (switch sides), then we on 'em (yuh, hey)
Then we solve 'em (yeah)
One phone call 'em (yeah), just to taunt 'em (yeah)
I done crushed so many roads, just my shadow (what?)
Don't you think you won the war from a battle (what?)
Could have bought another chain, bought a castle (yeah)
And if they want it, let it rain, we got ammo (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I done seen so many switch like a slideshow (what?)
So I stay around the fire like a pyro (yeah, yeah)
If you wanna cross that line, cut your tight-rope (cut it)
Look my chain up in its eyes, that's a light show (woo, yeah, woo)
And there's no turning back (back)
Perc' 10, Perc' 10, fuck a heart attack (Perky, what?)
Pray my brothers reach the promised land (woo)
For them, we do the fire dance
