		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everytime I call you think got me a freaking doll
But I'm not your freaking doll,
And my heart goes boom.
Everytime we meet down the street
You don't really give a shit
And my heart goes boom boom boom
Boom boom boom boom

Everytime I call you think got me a freaking doll
But I'm not your freaking doll,
And my heart goes boom.
Everytime we meet down the street
You don't really give a shit
And my heart goes boom boom boom
Boom boom boom boom

You got me insane in da brain
And tonight I'm gonna lose control
And my heart goes boom.
You got me insane in da brain
And tonight I'm gonna lose control
And my heart goes boom.

You got me insane again and again and again
Get out of my way ‘cause you got me insane
In da brain and tonight I'm gonna lose control
Gonna lose control ‘cause you got me insane

Insane sane sane sane sane
Insane sane sane sane sane
Got me insane sane sane sane sane

Everytime I call you think got me a freaking doll
But I'm not your freaking doll,
And my heart goes boom.
Everytime we meet down the street
You don't really give a shit
And my heart goes boom boom boom
Boom boom boom boom 

Everytime I call you think got me a freaking doll
But I'm not your freaking doll,
And my heart goes boom.
Everytime we meet down the street
You don't really give a shit
And my heart goes boom boom boom
Boom boom boom boom ..

You got me insane in da brain
And tonight I'm gonna lose control
And my heart goes boom.
You got me insane in da brain
And tonight I'm gonna lose control
And my heart goes boom.

You got me insane again and again and again
Get out of my way ‘cause you got me insane
In da brain and tonight I'm gonna lose control
Gonna lose control ‘cause you got me insane
