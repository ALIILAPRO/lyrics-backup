		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Seventy-seven degrees in this city tonight
Nothin' else on my sleeve, pride and feelings aside

Too many thoughts, too many issues
Too many nights I go to deprived
Too many nights without a kiss from you
Won't even think to say good night this time

Let me, let me, let me guess
Know you ain't in love, you probably with your ex, though
She thinks it's current, what a fuckin' mess, you
You hit her 'round and hit me with a text
Where the fuck you at?
Stirrin' up commotion, why you worrie?
I'm steady poppin' shit, I do it well
I, I never ask for much, I know you heard me
I got no problem slidin' by myself instead
Havin' motion
If it ain't for love and devotion
I thought that it was me that you wanted
I'm caught in the heat of the moment, yeah, yeah

Seventy-seven degrees (degrees, degrees)

I'm always on your time, yeah (yeah, yeah)
I hope you really mine, I be movin' on your (on God), yeah
Okay, arch that back, let me show you how it get (ooh)
Can't no pretty boy have you feelin' like this (ooh)
I'm a gangsta, she like the way that I choke her when we kiss (ooh)
I got a technic service with the blick (on God)
I'm cold hearted but I still show her love
I ain't finna share you girl, you know that's a dub
She say she outside with her friends and it's up
That good dick'll make her leave the club
I can't even hide it, I got feelings for you (feelings for you)
If they ever play, you know I'm drillin' for you (drillin' for you), yeah
Girl, I got more chopsticks than Tao and Nobu
Cover you in diamonds like a real one 'posed to
Huh, I'm just movin' how a real one move
You make my day whenever you send me nudes
Broke your heart a thousand times and you still come through
I'm a FaceTime away, you know I'm comin' to

Seventy-seven degrees in this city tonight
Nothin' else on my sleeve, pride and feelings aside
