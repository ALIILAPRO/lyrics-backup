Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, yeah (Big Boy on the track)

She got green eyes, she think that she innocent
Men in Black so I know I can't let 'em in
Get her wet, now I feel like the weatherman
Bitch, I'm on top, I can't settle with settlements
You said that he talkin', then get him then
That nigga, he want it, get him then
He wants some beef, get him then
If you want problems your job is to settle them
She got green eyes, she think that she innocent
Men in black so I know I can't let 'em in
Get her wet, now I feel like the weatherman
Bitch, I'm on top, I can't settle with settlements
You said that he talkin', then get him then
That nigga, he want it, get him then
He wants some beef, get him then
If you want problems your job is to settle them

I stay with some real niggas, never switch
Some niggas, they messed up like a glitch
Kickflip 'cause these niggas is tricks
She bad, shoot my shot, never miss
She a treesh so I never kiss
I know you, baby, like Yung Pinch
She fake, I can smell it on her stench
Mental, she like to grip, like to clench

She got green eyes, she think that she innocent
Men in black so I know I can't let 'em in
Get her wet, now I feel like the weatherman
Bitch, I'm on top, I can't settle with settlements
You said that he talkin', then get him then
That nigga, he want it, get him then
He wants some beef, get him then
If you want problems your job is to settle them
She got green eyes, she think that she innocent
Men in black so I know I can't let 'em in
Get her wet, now I feel like the weatherman
Bitch, I'm on top, I can't settle with settlements
You said that he talkin', then get him then
That nigga, he want it, get him then
He wants some beef, get him then
If you want problems your job is to settle them

Niggas they be jealous, use that shit as motivation
She used to leave me on seen, now she say that I'm playin'
Now she slide in my DMs, she wanna see where I stay, yeah
Get off my body, tryna be my bae like a blade, yeah
I got two other bad bitches, can I get a trade? Yeah
And I cannot lack, got a two-end blade, yeah
Money come fast from the west to the east
I got a bad bitch and that bitch from Belize
I hit a hundred K, I cannot believe
I'm goin' up fast, see the ground gettin' steep
I got her wrist bling and I feel like Lil Peep
She show off to me, her throat gettin' deep
I'm in Long Island, she said that she deep
But she pull up to fuck and I know that she peep
These niggas be stalkin', these niggas be creeps
They try to steal my energy
Man, these niggas be leech
I know your bitch, she feelin' me, yeah

She got green eyes, she think that she innocent
Men in black so I know I can't let 'em in
Get her wet, now I feel like the weatherman
Bitch, I'm on top, I can't settle with settlements
You said that he talkin', then get him then
That nigga, he want it, get him then
He wants some beef, get him then
If you want problems your job is to settle them
She got green eyes, she think that she innocent
Men in black so I know I can't let 'em in
Get her wet, now I feel like the weatherman
Bitch, I'm on top, I can't settle with settlements
You said that he talkin', then get him then
That nigga, he want it, get him then
He wants some beef, get him then
If you want problems your job is to settle them
