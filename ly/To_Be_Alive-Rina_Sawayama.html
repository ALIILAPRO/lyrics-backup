		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Flowers still look pretty when they're dying
Blue skies always there behind the rain, rain
Oceans swallow all of our feelings
I know it's just temporary pain, pain

'Cause I used to make my world so small
Prisoner to my bedroom walls
I never thought that I'd get this right
But I finally know what it feels like
To be alive, to be alive
Open my eyes
Feels like the first time
That I finally know what it feels like

To be alive, to be alive
Open my eyes
Feels like the first time
That I finally know what it feels like
To be alive
(I'm alive, I'm alive)

Darkness used to wrap its arms around me
I used to bring it with me everywhere, where
I swear that sometimes I get to be my worst enemy
I swear this is all the time, the answers spin right in front of me
All of the beauty and love I cannot see
I see it now
I see it now

'Cause I used to make my world so small
Prisoner to my bedroom walls
I never thought that I'd get this right
But I finally know what it feels like
To be alive, to be alive
Open my eyes
Feels like the first time
That I finally know what it feels like

To be alive, to be alive
Open my eyes
Feels like the first time
That I finally know what it feels like
To be alive

Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

Flowers still look pretty when they're dying
Oh, flowers still look pretty when they're dying
Flowers still look pretty when they're dying
Oh, flowers still look pretty when they're dying
