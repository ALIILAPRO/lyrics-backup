		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look up, look up, look up, look up
Your empty head
You worry them
You're gonna drop dead

Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog

Look up, look up, look up, look up
Your empty head
You worry them
You're gonna drop dead

Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
Like an old dog, like an old dog
