		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know we'll do it again
I know we're going to collide
I know we'll call it the end
It's always, always a lie
You wear your heart on your sleeve
I wear my blood on my tie
But it's only love underneath this disguise

Oh you left a hole in me
But I don't cut easily
I'm only just holding up, on my knees
Think it's time to open up
I don't mean bleed

So turn it on
We can go wild if it's what you want
Fire at me

I can't bear to let you go
So keep on throwing your sticks and stones
I'd rather fight with you all night
Than never have you in my life
I can't bear to let, bear to let you go

Why don't you do it again?
Go wrecking something of mine
Like you deserve the revenge
Like I've got something to hide
I'll keep on playing with you
You keep on calling me names
Sure, I can take the abuse
It's just a game

Oh you left a hole in me
But I don't cut easily
I'm only just holding up, on my knees
Think it's time to open up
I don't mean bleed

So turn it on
We can go wild if it's what you want
Fire at me

I can't bear to let you go
So keep on throwing your sticks and stones
I'd rather fight with you all night
Than never have you in my life
I can't bear to let, bear to let you go

All I know is I love it when our shit blows
We keep turning red hot and stone cold
Sweet burn inside, deals get broke
We fall in and fall out
We're too close, it's dead love
Until curtains close and we come alive

I can't bear to let you go, no
So keep on throwing your sticks and stones
I'd rather fight with you all night
Than never have you in my life
I can't bear to let, bear to let you 

I can't bear to let you go
So keep on throwing your sticks and stones
I'd rather fight with you all night
Than never have you in my life
I can't bear to let, bear to let you go
