		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I was a young boy I was honest and I had more self-
Control if I was tempted I would run
Then when I got older I began to lie to get exactly
What I wanted when I wanted it
And I wanted it

Now I'm having trouble differentiating between what I
Want and what I need to make me happy,
So instead of thinking, I just act before I have a chance to
Contemplate the consequence of action

And I will turn off
And I will shut down
Burying the voices of my conscience hitting ground
And I will turn off
And I will shut down
The chemicals are restless in my head

Cause I lie
Not because I want to
But I seem to need to all the time
Yeah, I lie
And I don't even know it
Maybe this all a part of my
Flawed design

And ever since I figured out that I could control other people
I've had trouble sleeping with both eyes closed
And if I ask permission, if I make sure it's okay,
I promise I won't slip up this time, you can trust me

But never take advice from someone who just admitted to being devious, who just confessed to treason
And I would ask you never a question that I cannot ask myself
For it might dirty up your conscience

Cause I lie
Not because I want to
But I seem to need to all the time
Yeah, I lie
And I don't even know it
Maybe this all a part of my

How can you say those things? Why can't you just believe?
How can you say those things and keep a straight face?
How can you say those things? Why can't we just believe?
How can you say those things and keep a straight face?

And I will turn off
And I will shut down
Burying the voices of my conscience hitting ground
And I will turn off
And I will shut down
The chemicals are restless in my head

Cause I lie
Not because I want to
But I seem to need to all the time
Yeah, I lie
And I don't even know it
Maybe this all a part of my

Cause I lie
And if I could control it
Maybe I could leave it all behind
Yeah, I lie
And I don't even know it
Maybe this is all a part of my
Flawed design
