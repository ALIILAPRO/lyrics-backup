		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were you all over me
Now you're all over us
Said you need room to breathe
And you've had enough
Now you're out a bar
And you're probably drunk
Baby it won't be long
Until, you hit me up

Ah, then suddenly
You're ca-ca-calling me
Middle of night, I'm not by myself
I met a better you
He's hotter too
Well-
Guess you should've thought of that before
You left and said you needed

Space
Be careful what you wish for
What you wish for
I just let somebody take your
Place
We're kissin' on the front porch
Through the front door
Oh, and he wants anything but
Space
Space
Space
Oh, and he wants anything but
Oh, and he wants anything but

Now he's all over me
And I'm all over us
It's getting harder to breathe
When we're making out

Kinda want you to watch
Really want you to see
So I can put you out of your misery

Ah, then suddenly
You're ca-ca-calling me
Middle of night, I'm not by myself
I met a better you
He's hotter too
Well-
Guess you should've thought of that before
You left and said you needed

Space
Be careful what you wish for
What you wish for
I just let somebody take your
Place
We're kissin' on the front porch
Through the front door
Oh, and he wants anything but
Space
Space
Space
Oh, and he wants anything but
Oh, and he wants anything but

Closer than the makeup on me
Skin to skin all on my body
Suddenly, you're feeling sorry
It's too late
Guess you should've thought of that before you left and said you needed

Space
Be careful what you wish for
What you wish for
I just let somebody take your
Place
Were kissin' on the front porch
Through the front door
Oh, and he wants anything but
Space
Space
Space
Oh, and he wants anything but
Oh, and he wants anything but
Space
