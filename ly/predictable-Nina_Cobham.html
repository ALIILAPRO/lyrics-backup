		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I fall asleep to things I’ve seen a hundred times, to me its comforting to know
that the ending’s predictable
My heart doesn’t fall into my stomach every time I get a message from you anymore
thats an achievement on its own
It’s not nice that its not fair, so absentmindedly unaware of it
but I’d rather it was this, than the other way around
It’s never nice when it’s not fair, I’m just grateful that you’re here
I’ve had the the time to readjust and I just haven’t yet

Te hice una lista de mis canciones favoritas
Didn’t think you’d even read them, pay attention the way that he does 
I can’t make you a playlist, I just cried to the one that I made him 
heard that song too many times and now I hate it

I fall asleep to things I’ve seen a hundred times, to me its comforting to know
that the endings predictable
My heart doesn’t fall into my stomach every time I get a message from you anymore 
thats an achievement on its own
It’s not nice that it’s not fair, so absentmindedly unaware of it
but I’d rather it was this, than the other way around
It’s never nice when its not fair, I’m just grateful that you’re here
I’ve had the the time to readjust and I just haven’t yet

CDs and DVDs, I like to keep physical memories of the things that I love 
(I know I say it a lot)
That voicenote my friend sent to me, I saved it,
must’ve played it once a day, every day, at least for a month
(’til I didn’t need it so much)

Could you tell your friend I watched that film he recommended?
I’m happy that it had the type of ending I predicted when we spoke about it before all this happened
I’ve had the time to readjust and I just haven’t

(There’s something comforting about falling asleep to this programme again) 

mhmm y empezamos otra vez
