		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give me 
Release
Witness me
I am 
Outside
Give me peace

Heaven holds a sense of wonder
And I wanted to believe
That I'd get caught up
When the rage in me subsides

I can't 
Help this longing
Comfort me
I can't 
Hold it all in
If you won't let me

Heaven holds a sense of wonder
And I wanted to believe
That I'd get caught up
When the rage in me subsides

In this white wave
I am sinking
In this silence
In this white wave
In this silence
I believe

In this white wave
I am sinking
In this silence
In this white wave
In this silence
I believe

I have seen you
In this white wave
You are silent
You are breathing
In this white wave
I am free
