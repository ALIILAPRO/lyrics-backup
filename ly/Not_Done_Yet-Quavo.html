		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I flew around the world and I turned out to be
What they said I couldn't be
I made a name for myself and I lived out the dreams
They said I couldn't reach
And I'm not done yet
Straight from the bottom, can't let them forget that I'm not done yet
Lived out the vision with no regrets, and I'm not done

I'm not done, I'm not finished, yeah, I got a mission
Tryna change the world, but Quavo ain't no politician
All the odds stacked against me and we still did it
Mama said I was hardhead but I knew how to listen

And I might took a loss, but I'm not done winning
I'm not done winning, no, I'm not done winning
And God showing out, no, he not done with me
He not done with me, no, He not done with me

I flew around the world and I turned out to be
What they said I couldn't be
I made a name for myself and I lived out the dreams
They said I couldn't reach
And I'm not done yet
Straight from the bottom, can't let them forget that I'm not done yet
Lived out the vision with no regrets, and I'm not done

Positivity energy, that's what I need for me
Hope you really mean it when you say you pray for me
Giving it all I got, don't know what God got for me
Holding my head up high, I hope y'all really proud of me

And I might took a loss, but I'm not done winning
I'm not done winning, no, I'm not done winning
And God showing out, no, he not done with me
He not done with me, no, He not done with me

I flew around the world and I turned out to be
What they said I couldn't be
I made a name for myself and I lived out the dreams
They said I couldn't reach
And I'm not done yet
Straight from the bottom, can't let them forget that I'm not done yet
Lived out the vision with no regrets, and I'm not done

Lived out the vision with no regrets, and I'm not done
