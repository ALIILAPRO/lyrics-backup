		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And it's my whole heart
Weighed and measured inside
And it's an old scar
Trying to bleach it out
And it's my whole heart
Deemed and delivered a crime
I'm on trial, waiting 'til the beat comes out
I'm on trial, waiting 'til the beat comes out

Who's a heretic now?
Am I making sense?
How can you make it stick?
Waiting 'til the beat comes out
Who's a heretic, child?
Can you make it stick, now?
And I'm on trial
Waiting 'til the beat comes out

I'm miles away, he's on my mind
I'm getting tired of crawling all the way
And I've had enough, it's obvious
And I'm getting tired of crawling all the way
Crawling all the way
Crawling all the way

I'm not beat up by this yet
You can't tell me to regret
Been in the dark since the day we met
Fire, help me to forget

I'm not beat up by this yet
You can't tell me to regret
Been in the dark since the day we met
Fire, help me to forget

And it's my whole heart
While tried and tested, it's mine
And it's my whole heart
Trying to reach it out
And it's my whole heart
Burned but not buried this time
I'm on trial, waiting 'til the beat comes out
I'm on trial, waiting 'til the beat comes out

I'm miles away, he's on my mind
I'm getting tired of crawling all the way
And I've had enough, it's obvious
And I'm getting tired of crawling all the way

I'm not beat up by this yet
You can't tell me to regret
Been in the dark since the day we met
Fire, help me to forget

I'm not beat up by this yet
You can't tell me to regret
Been in the dark since the day we met
Fire, help me to forget

Chained and shackled, oh
All that gravel, oh
It's a pity, oh
Never to return
But I never learn
It's a pity, oh
Chained and shackled, oh
All that gravel, oh
It's a pity, oh
Say I won't return
But I never learn
It's a pity, oh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
