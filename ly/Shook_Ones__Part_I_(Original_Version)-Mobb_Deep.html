		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The most violent of the violentest crimes we give life to
If these Queensbridge kids don't like you
We bring drama of the worst kind to enemies
Your first time will be your last Earth memories
It's only your own fault, I gave you fair warning
Beware of killer kids who don't care
Unaware fools will be dealt with in time
It ain't a mystery how I form the words in rhyme
In nineteen hundred and ninety square
All shook niggas is supposed to have fear
Tryna get a piece of this pie, we don't share
Prepare for the worst 'cause I been there, try to 
Keep a positive mind and walk a straight line don't work
So niggas is forced to do dirt
And God made dirt, so this dirt won't hurt
If I listen to the lessons and the rules I learnt
On these streets for nineteen years and not leaving
My first priority's to reach twenty-one breathing
Forever beef, nobody will ever be even
So I grab the heat before breezing
Lost in this foul mind state, I can't keep straight thinkin'
But I keep my eyes on the Earth without blinking
It's hard to be a man in this land of the venom
Any man try to front he get slugs in him because

He ain't a crook, son, son (yeah, yeah, yeah)
He just a shook one, shook one (word up)
Shook one
We live the life that of diamonds and guns (diamonds and guns)
And numerous ways that we choose to earn funds (earn funds)
Some niggas get shot, locked down and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones (shook ones, shook ones)
He ain't a crook, son (what? South side)
He just a shook one, shook one

For every rhyme I write it's twenty-five to life
To all my peoples in the Bridge know what I'm talking 'bout, right?
Ain't no time for hesitation, that only leads to incarceration
You don't know me, there's no relation
'Cause Queens niggas don't play
I don't got time for the he say she say I'm bigger than that
Claiming that you pack a gat but you scared to get locked
Once you get upon the Island change your ways and stop
Thirteen years in the projects of hard times I've lived in
Wake up in the morning thank God I'm still living
Sometimes I wonder, "Do I deserve to live
Or am I gonna burn in Hell for all the shit I did?"
No time to dwell on that 'cause my brain reacts
Front if you want, nigga, lay on your back
I don't fake jax, kid, you know I bring it to you live
Stay in a child's place, kid, you outta line
Criminal minds thirsty for recognition mission
I'm strictly sipping E&J like got my mind flippin'
I'm bugging, digging my ways out of holes by hustling
Get that loot, kid, you know my function
'Cause long as I'm alive I'ma live illegal
And once I get on I'ma put on all my peoples
React quick, spit lyrics like MACs, I hit your dome up
When I roll up, don't be caught sleeping 'cause I'm creeping 
('Cause I'm creeping, 'cause I'm creeping)

You just a shook one
We live the life that of diamonds and guns
And numerous ways that we choose to earn funds
Some niggas get shot, locked down and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones (shook ones, shook ones)
He ain't a crook, son
He just a shook one, shook one (shook one, shook one)

We live the life that of diamonds and guns
And numerous ways that we choose to earn funds
Some niggas get shot, locked down and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones (shook ones)
He ain't a crook, son, crook, son (crook, son)
He's just a shook one, shook one (shook one, shook one)

Yeah
Hit 'em up, son, hit 'em (Mobb Deep)
(Mobb Deep)
Put the motherfucking guns up (Mobb Deep)
(Mobb Deep)
SP's representin' (Mobb Deep)
(41st side) representin' (Mobb Deep)
