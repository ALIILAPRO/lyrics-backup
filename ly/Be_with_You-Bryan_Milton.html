		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your flashing eyes are a beacon light
That guides the jet-plane in the night
I just want to be with you

Pick me up when I'm down
Feel so good when you're around
I just want to be with you

It's not blue the way it's been
It's not night or between
It's not guilt at feeling free
Takes much more to conquer me
I just want to be with you

There's no place, no person left
Don't want to be nobody else
I just want to be with you darling
I just want to be with you darling
