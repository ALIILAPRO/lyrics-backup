		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I for no do like that (no do like)
Go on lose you like that (go lose you like)
Beau cul, jolis cils
(Like that)
(Stop it)
Amour difficile
(Until it just go like that)

Ma shorty, men nhar cheftek ga3ma b9it 9ad n'différer
W ma shorty, sahra bla bik ga3ma tferahli lili
Sekran lonely, b'Hennessy kanfekar fik ya lili
Sahran lonely, sekrani wajda khesni nerja3 bik f yeddi

3arfinek bagha bonhomme fini w bébé
3arfinek bagha Merco, villat, L.A.
3arfinek bagha Louis V, beaucoup bénef'
Fik kankhamem, yeah
Beau cul, jolis cils, amour difficile
Nti sbab 3dabi f'ma vie, bla bik 3ayech malaise
Hchich ma ynessini fik, khay, c'est difficile
Sur la Tour Eiffel dat gelbi cellophané

If I had none
I for no do like that (like that)
I think that you got man in his right senses
Go on lose you like that
Omoge na, if I had none
We haffi just keep it like that
They say you never know wetin you lose
Until it just go like that, like that

I got flaws, I know too
I want more and I want you
(?) but you open it, girl, so why not you? Why not us?
I'm not cursed, I want love
Knocking at your door and I can't back off
I ain't gon' stop, but you open it, girl
So why not you? Why not us?
What is heard, we said, what she said, they said
Shouldn't be the reason we downfall
What she said she felt when we felt a way
Shouldn't be the reason we fucked up
Yewande, how you dey?
How I dey for your place?
Holiday no dey for my name
For your case oh, yeah

If I had none
I for no do like that (like that)
I think that you got man in his right senses
Go on lose you like that (Go lose you like that)
Omoge na, if I had none
We haffi just keep it like that
They say you never know wetin you lose
Until it just go like that, like that, oh, no

If I had none
I for no do like that (like that)
I think that you got man in his right senses
Go on lose you like that (Go lose you like that)
Omoge na, if I had none
We haffi just keep it like that
They say you never know wetin you lose
Until it just go like that, like that
