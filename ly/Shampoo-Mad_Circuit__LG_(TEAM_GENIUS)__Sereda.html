		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Speechless, but I think we need to talk 
May be clumsy but I’ll never break your heart 
If you falling too, I’m here to break your fall
Rinse you through my mind but I can’t shake you off 
At all 
Ah, love ain’t like the movies 
You soak through my hair, you shampoo me yeah 
Wanting you to spook me, unless you can prove it’s real 
For real

Sweet like candy
I can taste it, when I close my eyes 
When you pull up it’s too sweet
Oh I’m on a sugar high 

Shampoo, shampoo, oh
Got me in my head like
Shampoo, shampoo, oh
Gotta get my head right
shampoo shampoo
I need a couple a things
I’m soaked up guess I'm conditioned that way
Shampoo, shampoo
Gotta get my head right 

I don’t wanna take my time right now 
Know you got it, keep ya game up 
Spill my feelings, better jot that down
Chinese, we could lay up 
Stay up, babe
‘Cause I’m givin’ you the raw me 
Late nights with no makeup 
Straight up
Uh
In my head like suds 
Round and round I couldn’t Rinse you out

Sweet like candy
I can taste it, when I close my eyes 
When you pull up it’s too sweet
Oh I’m on a sugar high 

Shampoo, shampoo, oh
Got me in my head like
Shampoo, shampoo, oh
Gotta get my head right
shampoo shampoo
I need a couple a things
I’m soaked up guess I'm conditioned that way
Shampoo, shampoo
Gotta get my head right 

Got me bubbled up like shampoo 
Left a mark, no tattoo 
Somethings we don’t plan to 
But life it justs command you 
Past due 
Like the last dude to enter in the classroom 
Even when your out my head, I know that you’ll be back soon 
Close grip like track shoes
Runnin’ down my head and shoulders 
Squeeze you tight to get you goin’ 
Foaming emotions when you move ya hands in different motions
Just another longer aroma for me to sit and soak in 
But just in case you didn’t notice 
Shampoo 
Shampoo 
Oh I’m on a sugar high

Shampoo, shampoo, oh
Got me in my head like
Shampoo, shampoo, oh
Gotta get my head right
shampoo shampoo
I need a couple a things
I’m soaked up guess I'm conditioned that way
Shampoo, shampoo
Gotta get my head right 
Got me in my head like
Gotta get my head right 
Got me in my head like
Gotta get my head right 
Got me in my head like
Gotta get my head right
