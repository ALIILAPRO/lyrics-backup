		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nigga god damn
Spent five bands on some Balmain, that's a lot man
I pull strings like a violin, A Boogie, damn he be wylin'
Nigga who scared? You think I'm scared?
Put them goons on you that's a nightmare
I got ten guns, I don't fight fair
Gotta buzz now, this a lightyear
This that new shit, got a new bitch
I spent two bands on her new kicks
Hanging from my neck, that's a Cuban
I swear you don't wanna see me lose it
When that Cuban, got bust down
Told them bitches I don't give a fuck now
I'm A Boogie, nigga what now?
See me shining, wanna show me love now
You a dub now
When I see you, I'ma treat you like you see-through
Thought I told you I dont need you
You is old news, I'ma be cool
Nigga stop it
I'm from Highbridge where you see a whole lot of fly shit
Louis V hoodie on my bitch
How I'm flexing you would think I got rich, ah

I know, I know what's real so keep it a thousand, ahh
In the field, swervin' in that Audi
Fuck your feelings, fuck whoever doubt it
Told the plug ain't no need to count it
I know, I know what's real, I know you in the field
I know, you say you drill, I know, I know what's real
My nigga I seen a lot now
And if you talk about that shit you might get shot down

I'm immaculate I feel, I see hatred in they grill
All blue faces on my bills, I keep thugs with me still
Try to take it they gon' kill, got no patience they just drill
All they places getting filled, ain't no cake then ain't no deal
When I be riding I got it, trust me I got it, I promise
I fuck with good girls who look like they coming straight outta Onyx
They in college, I pull up on 'em and work on a project
My name is Artist, I got it, they give me brain I'm just watching
I put my thumb in her butt and she told me nigga you wylin'
I keep on fuckin with her after I say I'm gon' stop it
No lovey-dovey no more, baby im just being honest
I'm going hard and I promise, like I play for the Rockets
I put my homie on, now his Rollie on, that shit flooded
Balmain hoodie on, I get what I want, I get money
Ain't no need to front, this ain't what you want, bitch you buggin'
If you say what's real, we could prolly chill, that's a hunnid

I know, I know what's real so keep it a thousand, ahh
In the field, swervin' in that Audi
Fuck your feelings, fuck whoever doubt it
Told the plug ain't no need to count it
I know, I know what's real, I know you in the field
I know, you say you drill, I know, I know what's real
My nigga I seen a lot now
And if you talk about that shit you might get shot down
