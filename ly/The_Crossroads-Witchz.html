		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Listen up
Hey I’m infected with love for the highest sins
Need to light me up
Cus I been playing all these games in my mind again
When will he learn
You're on our way to die
Just smile and walk the line
Their teaching for tomorrow
But they ain’t got no sight
They preach about the light
But hypocrites they lie
And all the sheep will follow
I’ll see you at the crossroads
Pick me up
Cus I been chasing all this pain with my high again
The world burns
You're on our way to die
Just smile and walk the line
Their teaching for tomorrow
But they ain’t got no sight
They preach about the light
But hypocrites they lie
And all the sheep will follow
I’ll see you at the crossroads
I beg you
Please save me now
I’m hollow
Life break me down
And I know
If ill be found whole
Send my love home
