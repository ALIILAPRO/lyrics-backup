		  J'suis pas content
J'suis pas content
I'm looking for the one but you don't want me at all
Elle est serpente
Elle est serpente
You leaving me stunned locked up cell wall
But I just can't help it
Three doors down the chairs are velvet
I know I sound selfish
No ten toes down but I know you felt it
Yeah I drink a bottle of red
And a bottle of white, said
She could coddle my head
Or keep me up all night
Till we see the sun
Trapped in the web all that you've spun
She does it just for me or is it anyone
Yeah I could call her Eve devour me and carrion
Devour me and carrion
Oh she's just a serpent
Let loose up in my mind
She's so observant
Wrapped up in her body
I'm confined
Yeah she's making me nervous
My mind she's undermined
How can I preserve this
When these lines so ill-defined
Look
I need that
Taking two steps forward and three back
No time for chit chat
Yeah I need it on me and I need it stat
It's just more my speed
It's a leap of faith it isn't guaranteed
I'd sweat I'd cry I'd lie I bleed
Yeah she's just a
Here's looking at you baby
You a snake and I don't know what to do baby
You gettin stuck on my mind like glue lately
If you know me this ain't anything new really
Now everyone's looking at you baby
You a snake and I don't know what to do baby
You gettin stuck on my mind like glue lately
If you know me this ain't anything new really
She's just a serpent
Let loose up in my mind
She's so observant
Wrapped up in her body I'm confined
Yeah she's making me nervous
My mind she's undermined
How can I preserve this
When these lines so ill-defined
Make my day
Set my soul on fire
For making me feel this way
But my pants been hot
So you call me a liar
Oh she's such a
Oh she's such a serpent
Let loose up in my mind
She's so observant
Wrapped up in her
body I'm confined
Yeah she's making me nervous
My mind she's undermined
How can I preserve this
When these lines so ill-defined
