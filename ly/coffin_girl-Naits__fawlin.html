		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fallin' down, I'm fallin' down, I'm fallin' down without you
Fallin' down, I'm fallin' down, I'm fallin' down without you
Fallin' down, I'm fallin' down, I'm fallin' down without you

Yeah, said you gon' stay but you're gone now
Told me that you think about me every time you fallin'
Now I think about you and I swear I do it often
Think about you often every second to be honest
Fallin' down, I'm fallin' down, I'm fallin' down without you
Talkin' to you often even though you're in a coffin

Yeah, said you gonna carry my heart and never break it
Every single thing that we go through we will make it
Drownin' all my sorrows in bottles to escape it
Yeah my shawty turned into an angel
I didn't know you were in danger
This fuckin' life is so painful
I see you flyin' but I don't

Yeah, and I don't know what I'm gonna do
I wake up in the mornin' and I'm not next to you
Felin' like I can't do this anymore
And I don't know what the fuck I'm fightin' for
Yeah, trippin' I got demons in my brain
Telel me how to fuck I'm gonna stay
I don't wanna waste away
Shawty I don't wanna waste away
I don't wanna waste away

I see you flyin' but I don't know how I just keep on fallin' down
Talkin' to an angel would you please just come on down
Would you please just come on down?
Runnin' in circles in my head and I'm runnin' wild
I see you flyin' but I don't know how I just keep on fallin' down
Talkin' to an angel would you please just come on down
Would you please just come on down?
Runnin' in circles in my head and I'm runnin' wild

Fallin' down, I'm fallin' down, I'm fallin' down without you
Fallin' down, I'm fallin' down, I'm fallin' down without you
Fallin' down, I'm fallin' down, I'm fallin' down without you

Yeah, said you gon' stay but you're gone now
Told me that you think about me every time you fallin'
Now I think about you and I swear I do it often
Think about you often every second to be honest
Fallin' down, I'm fallin' down, I'm fallin' down without you
Talkin' to you often even though you're in a coffin

Yeah, said you gonna carry my heart and never break it
Every single thing that we go through we will make it
Drownin' all my sorrows in bottles to escape it
Yeah my shawty turned into an angel
I didn't know you were in danger
This fuckin' life is so painful
I see you flyin' but I don't

Fallin' down, I'm fallin' down, I'm fallin' down without you
Fallin' down, I'm fallin' down, I'm fallin' down without you
Fallin' down, I'm fallin' down, I'm fallin' down without you
