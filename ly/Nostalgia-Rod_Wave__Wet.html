		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where did the day go?
I never get to see you
And I never get to feel you, ooh
An ocean between us
The feeling below us
Watch as the distance
Leads to the fallout
The sun is settin' now
Somewhere in the back of your mind
The leaves are fallin' down
And I cling to the vine
Where did the day go?
I never get to see you
I never get to feel you, ooh

Uh, damn, youngin', where have you been? Swear it been a minute
On a late flight from Dallas, on the way back to the city
Tryna balance out my life, I been so booked and busy
Disconnected from the trenches, but my heart forever in it
I'm still in this motherfucker with the ones I started with
I don't need no brand-new friends, only partnerships
I don't want no fairy tale Instagram model chick
I don't have the time for the party and the arguin'
'Member them small clubs? Hole in the wall clubs
Five-hundred-dollar backends in all dubs
These days, it ain't the same, everything done changed
Youngin' get up on stage, seven-fifty for his pain
At the basketball arena, but they here for the Wave
This motherfucker packed like a playoff game
All the women in my life could easily feel a distance
What's the point of havin' my heart if my mind busy?
All these niggas claimin' it's love, but I don't get it
I don't never ever feel love, only tension
Used to look up to rappers, but arrivin' what did it
Ain't no friends in this business, cutthroat competition
Lot of niggas get inside this position and lose the vision
So I'm focused more than ever, been grindin' like we ain't winnin'
I was stuck inside that bottom with problems, gettin' evicted
Now it's back-to-back tours two summers for sixty million

Where did the day go? (Alright)
I never get to see you (alright)
I never get to feel you (uh, alright), ooh, ooh
Where did the day go?
I never get to see you
I never get to feel you, ooh, ooh
