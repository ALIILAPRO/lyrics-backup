		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You almost forgot how it made you feel
Your feet on the edge, you knew it was real
It faded away, yeah

At the starting gun, no one ever told you
That it's time to run, some hell to go through
But it's not enough, watching from the sidelines now

When was the last time you felt your heart race, your heart race?
When was the last time you left your safe place, your safe place?
Just let it go

Whoa
When was the last time, the last time?
Whoa
When was the last time, the last time?

Time isn't slowing, got left behind
The future's in ocean, take the dive
Take it away, yeah

At the starting gun, no one ever told you
That it's time to run, some hell to go through
But it's not enough, watching from the sidelines now

When was the last time you felt your heart race, your heart race?
When was the last time you left your safe place, your safe place?
Just let it go

Whoa
When was the last time, the last time?
Whoa
When was the last time, the last time?
