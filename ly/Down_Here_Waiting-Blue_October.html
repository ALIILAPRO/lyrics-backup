		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I cannot look the other way

I was messing with the B team
Thought it was the first string
Looking out for number one
Yeah I see you got your own thing
Well I don't need a damn thing
We just trying to get it done
Well I guess I gotta come clean
I don't like a routine
Easier to cut and run
Well I know this is gonna hurt
Soft pink, red, teal If my heart had a mouth, I could tell you how I feel

Come and get it, it's supposed to feel good
Yeah you're so sweet when you're looking at me
And the lights go out

I'll be down here just waiting for a little attention from you now
I'll be down here just waiting and no one in the world can stop me now

Tell me what you've been through
I can be your go-to
You can be my number one
You've been on the run, too
Come here let me look at you 
How about a little fun?
Well I guess I gotta come clean
I don't like a routine
Easier to cut and run
So come on baby, make it hurt
Soft pink, red, teal If my heart had a mouth, I could tell you how I feel

Come and get it, it's supposed to feel good
Yeah you're so sweet when you're looking at me
And the lights go out

I'll be down here just waiting for a little attention from you now
I'll be down here just waiting and no one in the world can stop me now

I'll be down here
I cannot look the other way and I'll say it: Here we go!
I'll be down here just waiting for a little attention from you now
If my heart had a mouth I could tell you how I feel
I'll be down here just waiting and no one in the world can stop me now
If my heart had a mouth I could tell you how I feel
