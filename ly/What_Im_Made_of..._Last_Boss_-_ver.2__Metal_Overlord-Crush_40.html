		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't care what you're thinking
As you turn to me
'Cause what I have in my two hands
Is enough to set me free (set me free)
I could fight the feeling
To resist it over time
But when it's just too much to take
You sneak up from behind

Is it me, you say, you're looking for
Let me show you who I am and what I'm here for...(here for)

Try to reach inside of me, try to drain my energy
Let me show you just what I'm made of
Simple curiosity tries to take a bite of me
Let me show you just what I'm made of now...

Like a million faces
I've recognized them all
And one by one they've all become
A number as they fall (as they fall)
In the face of reason
I can't take no more
One by one they've all become
A black mark on the floor

Is it me, you say, you're looking for
Let me show you who I am and what I have in store... (in store)

Try to reach inside of me, try to drain my energy
Let me show you just what I'm made of
Simple curiosity tries to take a bite of me
Let me show you just what I'm made of now...
You can take another life long try
You can take another try...

Guitar Solo
Try to reach inside of me, try to drain my energy
Let me show you just what I'm made of
Simple curiosity tries to take a bite of me
Let me show you just what I'm made of now...

Try to reach inside of me (Let me show you what I'm made of)
Try to drain my energy (Let me show you what I'm made of)
Let me show you just what I'm made of
