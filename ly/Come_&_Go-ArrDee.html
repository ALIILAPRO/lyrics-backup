		  ArrDee, ArrDee
Come and you go
Can't trust a soul, no
Story of my life
Look, uh

In this world, you come and you go (go)
Story of my life
I've been on my ones, I'm grinding
Not gettin' by but it's all timing
I don't mind it, it's alright
However you cope
When you live in a place so cold
Hearts get froze, I don't trust a soul
'Cause in this world, you come and you go (go)
Story of my life
I've been on my ones, I'm grinding
Not gettin' by but it's all timing
I don't mind it, it's alright
However you cope
When you live in a place so cold
Hearts get froze, I don't trust a soul

Started from young and the kid ain't grown
But the problem have, I hardly did know my dad
But it weren't his fault, I'm no longer mad
He does what he can, they come and they go (always)
The first girl that I had still fucks with my mind
But the girl is a ho 
But now I'm trash so what do you know
I cum and I go, literally 
They all show love on the road
And I got all the bad girls tryna get pics with me
If I step in the club then they sit with me (come)
It's a blessing I ain't gonna bitch, but see
I bet you now they wouldn't stick with me (facts)
If I didn't rock this flow
If I didn't pop then blow but I chose this

In this world, you come and you go (come and you go) (go)
Story of my life (life)
I've been on my ones, I'm grinding
Not gettin' by but it's all timing
I don't mind it, it's alright (it's all good)
However you cope
When you live in a place so cold
Hearts get froze, I don't trust a soul
'Cause in this world, you come and you go (come and you go) (go)
Story of my life
I've been on my ones, I'm grinding
Not gettin' by but it's all timing
I don't mind it, it's alright
However you cope
When you live in a place so cold
Hearts get froze, I don't trust a soul
'Cause in this world, you come and you go (go)

I got my own but I got me first (me)
Shout out the ones that have done me dirt (shout out)
I pour the pain in the verse
But bruv I been hurt so much it don't hurt
I bring bro 'cause he put in the work
They come and they go, but he wouldn't dare
From young he been there and never been scared
He'd kill a man before they touched my hair
But most of them came and gone
I think that's why I'm always moving
I never stay, I switched up the plot
Hardly even lay my head in my spot (don't stay there)
I'm an outside baby, but the mind I've got
I would never swap, I been through a lot

'Cause in this world, you come and you go
Story of my life
I've been on my ones, I'm grinding
Not gettin' by but it's all timing
I don't mind it, it's alright
However you cope
When you live in a place so cold
Hearts get froze, I don't trust a soul
'Cause in this world, you come and you go (go)
Story of my life
I've been on my ones, I'm grinding
Not gettin' by but it's all timing
I don't mind it, it's alright (it's alright)
However you cope
When you live in a place so cold
Hearts get froze, I don't trust a soul
'Cause in this world, you come and you go (come and you go) (go)
