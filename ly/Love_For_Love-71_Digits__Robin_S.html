		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I need somebody, somebody, yeah

It's so hard to find someone special
That someone you can love and trust
It's so hard to put your love on the line
You know love for sure is space and time

Some people all they want is fortune
Some people all they want is fame
Some people all they'll do is break your heart
There's got to be a, a better way of giving your love

I, I'm givin' ya love for love
If you feel it in your heart
That's the only way to start
It's gotta be love for love, hey

And when you find that special someone
There's got to be a little give and take
It feels so bad to give all of your heart
Only to find that just is just in vain

Some people say that love's a gamble
Some people think that it's a game
Some people say that love is just for fools
There's got to be a better way of giving your love

I'm givin' you love for love
Love is in your heart
That's the only way to start
I'm givin' you love for love

I'm givin' you love, oh baby
I am givin' you love for love
If you want me here to stay
Baby that's the only way
It's gotta be love for love, hey

I need your lovin', oh baby
I want your lovin' baby
It's gotta be love
It's gotta be love for love
Oh, yeah, I

It's gonna be love for love
If you feel it in your heart
That's the only way to start
It's gonna be love for love
I'm givin' you love, oh baby

I am givin' you love for love for love
If you want me here to stay
Baby, that's the only way
I'm givin' you love for love

I'm givin' you love, oh baby
I'm givin' you love for love
If you want me here to stay
Baby, that's the only way
It's gotta be love for love, hey
