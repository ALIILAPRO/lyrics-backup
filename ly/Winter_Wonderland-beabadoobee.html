		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He's singin' a song as we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, are you married? We'll say, no man 
But you could do the job when you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face, unafraid, the plans that we've made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman
Until the other kids come knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrilling?
Though you know kids are chilling
We'll frolic and play the old fashioned way
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
