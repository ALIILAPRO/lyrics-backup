		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Macavity's a mystery cat
He's called the Hiddenpaw
For he's the master criminal
Who can defy the law
He's the bafflement of Scotland Yard
The Flying Squad's despair
For when they reach the scene of crime
Macavity's not there

Macavity, Macavity
There's no one like Macavity
He's broken every human law
He breaks the law of gravity
His powers of levitation would
Make a fakir stare
But when they reach the scene of crime
Macavity's not there

Macavity's a ginger cat
He's very tall and thin
You would know him if you saw him
For his eyes are sunken in
His brow is deeply lined with thought
His head is highly domed
His coat is dusty from neglect
His whiskers are uncombed
He sways his head from side to side
With movements like a snake
And when you think he's half asleep
He's always wide awake

Macavity, Macavity
There's no one like Macavity
For he's a fiend in feline shape
A monster of depravity
You may meet him in a by-street
You may see him in the square
But when a crime's discovered
Then Macavity's not there

He's outwardly respectable, I know
He cheats at cards
And his footprints are not found in
Any files of Scotland Yard's
And when the larder's looted and
The jewel case is rifled
Or when the milk is missing
Or another peke's been stifled
Or the greenhouse glass is broken
And the trellis past repair
There's the wonder of the thing
Macavity's not there

Macavity, Macavity
There's no one like Macavity
There never was a cat of
Such deceitfulness and suavity
He always has an alibi
And one or two to spare
What ever time the deed took place
Macavity wasn't there
And they say that all the cats
Whose wicked deeds are widely known
I might mention Mungojerrie, Rumpleteazer
Griddlebone
Are nothing more than agents for the
Cat who all the time
Just controls the operations
The Napoleon of Crime macavity, Macavity
There's no one like Macavity
He's a fiend in feline shape
A monster of depravity
You may meet him in a by-street
You may see him in the square
But when a crime's
Discovered, then Macavity, macavity
Macavity, Macavity

When a crime's discovered, then
Macavity's not there
