		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a pain that sleeps inside
It sleeps with just one eye
And awakens the moment that you're near
Though I try to look away
The pain it still remains
Only leaving when you're next to me

Do you know that every time you're near
Everybody else seems far away
So can you come and make them disappear
Make them disappear and we can stay

So I stand and look around
Distracted by the sounds
Of everyone and everything I see
And I search through every face
Without a single trace, of the person
The person that I need

Do you know that every time you're near
Everybody else seems far away
So can you come and make them disappear
Make them disappear and we can stay

Can you make them disappear?
Make them disappear

There's a pain that sleeps inside
Sleeps with just one eye
And awakens, the moment that you're near
And I search through every face
Without a single trace, of the person
The person that I need

Do you know that every time you're near
Everybody else seems far away
So can you come and make them disappear
Make them disappear and we can stay
