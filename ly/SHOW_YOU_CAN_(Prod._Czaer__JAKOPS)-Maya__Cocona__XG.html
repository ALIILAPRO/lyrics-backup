		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah
Slam dunkin' on 'em when I take that shot
Studio to the stage ain't no days off
もはや無意味 f the haters let 'em talk
Doin' a whole lot of nothin' with ya life, what the f (uh)

I know, I know 우리가 하면 lit
우리 말곤 이런 존재는 찾을 수 없지
One of one only
We one of one only
We one of one only
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

XG breaking ground bound breakers
Fear nobody, but God, that's the essentials
Mind over matter that's my only utensil
Yeah, it's prime time ain't no minute or second to waste
Uh, yeah, I guess we're on the right track
他のことなんて印象にないはず
掻っ攫った show 異論は無いはず
もう挑まない方がいい we're gonna fight back (oh, oh)

Levitate on 'em, we be outer space, ayy
Limited players steppin' to the plate, ayy
I'm meteor flame, they mediocre plain
Even heavyweights strike out when Coco-tani's playin'(haha)
늘 여유만만, 위풍도 당당
무대 발라버릴 때는 bam-ba-ba, bam-bam
우린 복붙 아닌 한정
태생부터 남달라 we're not the same, I'ma Martian

Slam dunkin' on 'em when I take that shot
Studio to the stage ain't no days off
もはや無意味 f the haters let 'em talk
Doin' a whole lot of nothin' with ya life, what the umm

I know, I know 우리가 하면 lit
우리 말곤 이런 존재는 찾을 수 없지
One of one only
We one of one only
We one of one only
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?

Whoa, that girl's extraordinary
No pause button, we born ready
Tear the roof off, turn it into confetti
They gassed up, but they ain't premium, unleaded
Yeah, we get busy doin' big things
まだならそのうちぶっちぎり
遠くからでも I know you gon' feel the heat
勝負事見慣れた 相手の悔し泣き

From beast mode 다 씹어 먹어 feast mode
Whole team 상타치, 사기캐 no cheat code
Veni, vidi, vici motto came saw conquered
And ya'll ain't seen a group like us 
As if our name was "Jon" though (no)
Confident in any continent
Never been caught slackin' lackin' competition
Street fight battle me? Ha, sure you can
Street fight battle me? Ha, show you can

Slam dunkin' on 'em when I take that shot
Studio to the stage ain't no days off
もはや無意味 f the haters let 'em talk
Doin' a whole lot of nothin' with ya life, what the f (uh)

I know, I know 우리가 하면 lit
우리 말곤 이런 존재는 찾을 수 없지
One of one only
We one of one only
We one of one only
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

(Hey)
(Hey)
