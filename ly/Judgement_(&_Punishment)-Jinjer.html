		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We came from the lands
Where kindness equals weakness.
Feelings are conditional
And help is something supernatural.

Your judgements sign your own punishment
Your judgements sign your own punishment

Yes, it is what it is
I know you're pissed off
Narrow minds cannot believe
What they hear.

An individual with bitter inner word
Is a cause of deficiency of goodness and love.
Of goodness and love.
All your good intentions are muted and disabled.
Booyah!
Tell me what you're gonna bring to the table?
Do you know we re gonna eat at the same table?

This is what it is!
I know you're pissed off.
Narrow minds cannot believe in what they hear.
Their system of beliefs experiences stress.
Mental impenitence put into the test.

So if you are here
To bring the atmosphere of fear,
Don't bother, brother!
Don't bother, brother!

The power of speech is idled away.
Poison is spilt, dirty moths sting!
Sting!

Don't bother, brother!
We've seen things that can't be unseen.
Don't bother, brother!
That's exactly what makes us go even farther.

This is what it is!
I know you're pissed off.
Narrow minds cannot believe in what they hear.
Their system of beliefs experiences stress.
Mental impenitence put into the test.


Your judgements sign your own punishment.
Your judgements - your own punishment.
