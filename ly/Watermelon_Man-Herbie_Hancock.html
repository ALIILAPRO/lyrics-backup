		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The girl could move, and she did
We were captives on a casino ship
Where the Midwest lay out hours and burnt to crisp
I spent a year as her hair lip
but now I fall apart at night and dream about our trip

But the first two weeks were great
I felt content to watch the Entertainment Channel fornicate
With flashes of you maturing into stage
flawless masterpieces built of dreams I swore were memories

And I dream, I dream, I dream

I saw the ocean envelop the sky
And blot out the sun on the day that we died
The former, the latter, and all in between
They were vanquished by Loki the fiend

Do you remember me, do you remember me?
The one that you loathed when he set you free
Do you remember me, do you remember me?
The one with whom you fell beneath the sea

Yeah, we killed, we killed it all night
All night
Yeah, we killed, we killed it all night
All night
Yeah, we killed it, we killed it all night
All night
Yeah, we killed it, we killed it all night
All night
Yeah, we killed it, we killed it all night
