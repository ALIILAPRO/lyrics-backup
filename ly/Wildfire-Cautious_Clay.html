		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your eyes are like weapons
Your lips could teach lessons
Don't use them so reckless
'Cause for you I'm helpless
You gotta take caution
You know that I'm all in
The chance of me falling
You know that it's often

But if you don't wanna stay
Then please stop moving this way

You're starting up a wildfire in my heart
Hope it's what you want
Not just what you do
You're starting up a wildfire in my head
Hope it's what you meant
Not just what you do

This love is so costly
It's killing me softly
Don't know what to call it
This thing that you started
You make it look easy
The way that you lead me
Into the fire, babe
Are you coming with me? Yeah

But if you don't wanna stay (don't wanna stay)
Then please stop moving this way

You're starting up a wildfire in my heart
Hope it's what you want
Not just what you do
You're starting up a wildfire in my head
Hope it's what you meant
Not just what you do

(In my head)
(What you meant)
Hope it's what you want
Not just what you do
(What you want)
(Just what you do)
Hope it's what you meant
Not just what you do
