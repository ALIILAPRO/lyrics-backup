		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Outside the gates of Heaven, oh, there lives a unicorn
I close my eyes to seven oh, this world is not my home
A broken heart in danger and a pillow filled with tears
Oh, can you see the strangers in the pain and in the fears? 

Can you feel my heart? Baby don't give up
Can you feel my love tonight?

In 100 years love is illegal in 100 years from now
In 100 years love is illegal in this lonely, heartbreak town
In 100 years love is illegal all your dreams will die
In 100 years love is illegal and your hope will not survive

L.O.V.E
Love is illegal in my heart, can you hear my heart is beating
L.O.V.E
Love is illegal in my heart, can you hear my heart is beating

You're looking through a fire computers everywhere
Oh, you're a shotgun rider controllers here and there
And you read old love letters drowning in the sea
Oh baby it doesn't matter, oh you've lost all what you feel

Can you feel my heart? Baby don't give up
Can you feel my love tonight

In 100 years love is illegal in 100 years from now
In 100 years love is illegal in this lonely, heartbreak town
In 100 years love is illegal all your dreams will die
In 100 years love is illegal and your hope will not survive

L.O.V.E
Love is illegal in my heart, can you hear my heart is beating
L.O.V.E
Love is illegal in my heart, can you hear my heart is beating
L.O.V.E
Love is illegal in my heart, hear my heart is beating
L.O.V.E
Love is illegal in my heart, hear my heart is beating
