		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been singing along to try
To sing along, I sing it all the day
And you stole my singin'
And you say that you ought to be strong, poison all, all

Oh, did I be seen along and all the way eternal
Though, you saunter on
Long again, I know
Hey, hey
Hiding on before they sing together, song tonight
Here, how, adding on to blame
Hating all that you've done, and know it's all too long

And it's all too long, I leave too long
And it's all too long, it seem too long
Hey, dum-di
Hey, hey, hey, hey

I'm singing too long tonight
I sing along, I sing it all the day
And you stole my singin'
And you say that you ought to be strong, poison all, all

Here did happen song and now I'm rolling on the sand
Beyond the song, tonight
Long again, I know
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Ahh, ah-da, ahh
Oh, oh, oh
