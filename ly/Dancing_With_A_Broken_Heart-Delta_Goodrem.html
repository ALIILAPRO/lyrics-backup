		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Held my breath as the last wave pulled me under, under
What doesn't kill you makes you so much stronger, stronger
Can you feel this pain
Rushing through these veins
Driving me insane
But I won't break

I won't look back tonight,
This is the time of my life
Underneath these stars
I'm dancing with a broken heart
Fight fire with fire
The truth to a liar
I'm going higher
I'm Dancing with a broken heart

I'm gonna bury all the past that sinks me under, under
I'm gonna make a storm from lightning and thunder, thunder
I won't let dogs lie
In the peace and quiet
Moving on to another time

I won't look back tonight
This is the time of my life
Underneath these stars
I'm dancing with a broken heart
Fight fire with fire
The truth to a liar
I'm going higher
I'm Dancing with a broken heart

Can you feel this pain
Rushing through these veins
Driving me insane
But I won't break

I won't look back tonight
This is the time of my life
Underneath these stars
I'm dancing with a broken heart
Fight fire with fire
The truth to a liar
I'm going higher
I'm Dancing with a broken heart
