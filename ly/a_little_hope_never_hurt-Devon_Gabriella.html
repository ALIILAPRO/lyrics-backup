		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Always leave my door unlocked 
in case you change your mind
Wear makeup to the grocery store
what if I see you in line?
The ringer of my phone stays on
won’t sleep through your drunk call 
But who am I to think 
you even miss me 
at all?

I'll hold on but i'm exhausted
I remember everything, you forgot it
Part of me feels idiotic
but it’s my last resort to comment

So I’ll miss while you move on 
Hard you hate you when I loved us
But a little hope never hurt anyone 

I look a little too hard for you 
whenever i’m in a crowd 
Glued my headphones to my ears
you’re too fucking hard to drown out 
Called our friends to my 21st
hoping you’d come around
Though I’d never admit it to myself
you’re celebrating someone else 

I'll hold on but i'm exhausted
I remember everything, you forgot it
Part of me feels idiotic
but it’s my last resort to comment

So I’ll miss while u move on 
Hard you hate you when I loved us
but a little hope never hurt anyone 

1, 2, 3, 4
I want you to know
but I don't want to tell you
I’d pick up your call
but is that something only I’d do
I text you drunkenly
intoxicated love receipts 

Did you know that you’re hard to let go of?
Is it my fault, think I loved you too much 

I'll hold on but i'm exhausted
I remember everything, you forgot it
Part of me feels idiotic
but how am I supposed to stop this?

So I’ll miss while u move on 
Hard you hate you when I loved us
But a little hope never hurt anyone
