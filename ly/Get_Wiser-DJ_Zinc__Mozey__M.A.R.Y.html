		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How will I know if you don't say 
We'd just keep moving the same way 
Finding ourselves in a roleplay 
Looking for new outcomes
Surfacing what's inside
Now's the time to alchemise 
Seeing things as they are 
cnd we turn it into art
cll these cycles repeat
Till we meet them consciously and get wiser
Open up to love
Follow the core of your care 
What are we here for
If not to feel this
So we be owning our choices 
cs we grow into our voices 
Weaving ethereal noises
cs we get closer too
Surfacing what's inside
Now's the time to alchemise 
Seeing things as they are 
cnd we turn it into art
cll these cycles repeat
Till we meet them consciously and get wiser
Open up to love
Follow the core of your care 
What are we here for
If not to feel this
Open up to love
Follow the core of your care 
What are we here for
If not to feel this
