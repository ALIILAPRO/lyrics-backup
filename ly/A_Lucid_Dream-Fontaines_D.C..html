		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was there
When the rain changed direction
And fled to play tricks with your hair
Overlooking the fair
And it's all coming back
And you're prowling the track
Like a cat on the back of a chair
And the clouds opened up
For the aul' ones to look down
The detail, in books, the affair
And it's all coming back
And the main thing
Is that the rain changed direction 
Before you were there
Ah

I was there
When the rain changed direction
And fled to play tricks with your hair
Overlooking them, there
And it's all coming back
And you're prowling the track
Like a cat on the back of a chair
And the bulletin board
Was shot up like a ward full of junk
And all kinds of despair
And it's all coming back
And the main thing
Is that the rain changed direction 
Before you were there
Ah, ah

And now the foreign corner's gone and thrown
Are you opposed
To being anyone else
Other than you
Are you opposed
As anyone else
And they just want to come to your place
And see you sing 
I was there
When the rain changed direction
And fled to play tricks with your hair
Overlooking the fair
And it's all coming back
And you're prowling the track
Like a cat on the back of a chair
And the clouds opened up
For the aul' ones to look down
The detail, in books, the affair
And it's all coming back
And the main thing
Is that the rain changed direction 
I was there
When the rain changed direction
And fled to play tricks with your hair
Overlooking them, there
And it's all coming back
And you're prowling the track
Like a cat on the back of a chair
And the bulletin board
Was shot up like a ward full of junk
And all kinds of despair
And it's all coming back
And the main thing
Is that the rain changed direction 
Before you were there
Ah
