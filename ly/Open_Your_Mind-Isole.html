		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In an empty room you can scream
In the darkness you can bleed
In the darkness

In a crowded room you can hide
in a corner silently

It's time to stop wallowing in the mire
Embrace yourself and make a stand
Somewhere deep down in your subconscious
A voice of reason is growing strong

With an open mind you can see
all the oppression, all the guilt
and all the greed

Raise your voice
Freedom of speech
You're not alone
We can make the difference

It's time to stop wallowing in the mire
Embrace yourself and make a stand
Somewhere deep down in your subconscious
A voice of reason is growing strong

In a crowded room you will speak
with a voice sincere and full of hope
