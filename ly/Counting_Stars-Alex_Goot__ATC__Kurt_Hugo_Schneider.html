		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Yeah, we'll be counting stars

I see this life like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
In my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye shall find
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
And I feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing
And I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I could lie, could Iie, could lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
(oh)
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars
Yeah we'll be counting stars, yeahh

I feel the love and I feel it burn
Down this river, every turn
Hope is a four letter word
Make that money, watch it burn
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
And I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I could lie, could lie, could lie
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
(woah)
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But lately, I've been
I've been praying hard
Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars

Yeah we'll be counting stars, woah

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But lately, I've been
I've been praying hard
Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars
