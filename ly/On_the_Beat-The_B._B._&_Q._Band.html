		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How's about your company this evenin'
Won't you say that you are free
Take you out to somewhere really special
Oh won't you come along with me
From what I've heard them say
The music that they play
Is nothin' like you've ever heard before
Once you get to dancin' you can stomp your feet
'Cause the rhythm keeps in time
What do you say now?

Are you ready or not
It's only up the street
Everybody's dancin'
And everybody's on the beat
I'm a-beggin' you now
It's where we both could be

Everybody's dancin'
And everybody's on the beat

Are you ready or not
It's only up the street
Everybody's dancin'
And everybody's on the beat

Say that you'll accept this invitation
Oh won't you say you'll come along
Music can give lovers inspiration
It's just a place where we could go
Nobody has a care
'Cause there's music in the air
It's nothin' like you've ever seen before
People dancin' all night long
Won't you say you've got the time
You wanna go there?

Are you ready or not
It's only up the street
Everybody's dancin'
And everybody's on the beat

Are you ready or not
It's where we both could be
Everybody's dancin'
And everybody's on the beat

(What you say) you and I should go together
(What you say) it's for everyone to see
(What you say) do you want to come along with me?
