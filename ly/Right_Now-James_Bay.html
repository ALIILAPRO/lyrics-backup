		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hold me, hold me
Oh, I want to feel you now
Do we, do we
Do we ever need to doubt?

We can do no wrong, so we must be long
Overdue a life together

When will I know? When will it be
The right time to show you you're the only one for me?
Thought I needed a sign, thought you needed a scene
But I look deep into your eyes, and it's obvious to me
That it's right, right now
That it's right, right now

See me, see me
You only see me for who I am
You ought, oh, you ought
You ought to know it, but you hold my hand

This is all we want, so we must be long
Overdue a life together

When will I know? When will it be
The right time to show you you're the only one for me?
Thought I needed a sign, thought you needed a scene
But I look deep into your eyes, and it's obvious to me
That it's right, right now
That it's right, right now
There can be no doubt
That it's right, right now

Words on my chest, I just can't bear
Want to tell you no one compares to you

When will I know? When will it be
The right time to show you you're the only one for me?
Thought I needed a sign, thought you needed a scene
But I look deep into your eyes, and it's obvious to me
That it's right, right now
That it's right, right now
There can be no doubt
That it's right, right (now), right, right, right now
