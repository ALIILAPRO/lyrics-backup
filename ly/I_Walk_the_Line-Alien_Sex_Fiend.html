		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I walk the line between good and evil
This apple's rotten, rotten to the core
Get up, get up, off your knees
Get down, get down, on the floor!

I walk the line
I walk the line
I walk the line

Between good and evil
My business is a little cloak and dagger
I drink so much I don't walk I merely stagger!
No you wouldn't listen & I don't blame you
No I don't blame ya!

I walk the line
I walk the line
I walk the line
I walk the line

Between good & evil
My rent is 65 a day
I can't move
You know that's the price you pay

Is life all in vain?
Starts off in my arm
Opens up my brain
I'm already in the gutter -
Next stop is the drain!

I walk the line
I walk the line
I walk the line
I walk the line

Between good and evil
Live fast, die young
Live fast, die young
I walk the line
Evil

I walk the line
I walk the line
I walk the line
I walk the line

Between good and evil
While others have been thinking about it - I've been there and back

I walk the line
I walk the line
I walk the line
I walk the line
Between good and evil
