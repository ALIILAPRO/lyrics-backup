		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've been knocking at the windows
Rattling the doors
Dragging me to hell
My claw marks on the floor

Chained me to the bedpost
Colder than a corpse
Bodies under covers
Quiet as a morgue

Your heart's an unending maze
Of dead end rooms and hallways
Can't go back, it's a trap
Won't be your creature

I've lost control
God save my soul

You're just like a haunted house, house
Locked inside I can't get out, out
You're just like a haunted
Feels like I'm crazy
Hallucinating
No one to save me now
House, house, you're just like a haunted

Your heart is barely beating
Have you always been so cold?
My head is still repeating 
All the lies that you have told
So runaway, it isn't safe
Am I trapped in here forever?
Sorry to say, you'll never change
And I'd do anything to escape

I've lost control
God save my soul

You're just like a haunted house, house
Locked inside I can't get out, out
You're just like a haunted
Feels like I'm crazy
Hallucinating
No one to save me now
House, house you're just like a haunted

The moonlit skeletons come alive in my dreams
I'm so sick of you haunting me every time I sleep
The walls are bending 
And I'm thinking that this is the end
I'm so sick of this fantasy, never-ending dread

You're just like a haunted house, house
Locked inside I can't get out, out
You're just like a haunted
Feels like I'm crazy
Hallucinating
No one to save me now
House, house you're just like a haunted
