		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You act some ways I can't believe
But I'm steady moving up so
I fall my way back to the leaves
And I'm hoping that you notice
Can't stop myself I caught a breeze
Yea she dancing in the summer
I sold my x back to the streets
Like I couldn't save you I come back around now
You thought I'm Superman but I can't fly alone now
It was only yesterday I had you on my own well
You ain't losing no one I cant slow myself down
I thought I told you how I felt but you're still sad about it
How she see another lover on the weekend now
I shoot 40 shots into the sky like every morning
They complaining bout the noises every evening now
I lost my mind like totally
But they acting like they know me
I sold my love back to the streets
Like I couldn't save you I come back around now
You thought I'm Superman but I can't fly alone now
It was only yesterday I had you on my own well
You ain't losing no one I cant slow myself down
Like I couldn't save you I come back around now
You thought I'm Superman but I can't fly alone now
