		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can leave this place
You can leave this town and
Never look down
Fly on by on that fancy flying machine
Take me there, girl
Take me where I wanna go
To the place where we belong together

My baby got a love song
My baby got a love song for me
A-ha, ye-eah, my baby got the best of me
My baby got a love song
My baby got a love song for me
A-ha, ye-eah, my baby got all of me

Hm, I see her across the room
She's dancing like the moon just
Tipped to the sky, she's shining bright
She takes my hand
She takes me where I wanna go
To the place where we belong together

My baby got a love song
My baby got a love song for me
A-ha, ye-eah, my baby got the best of me
My baby got a love song
My baby got a love song for me
A-ha, ye-eah, my baby got all of me

My baby like to float down the river
My baby like to watch the treeline fall away
With the sky, my baby got all of me
My baby like to take me dancin'
My baby like to drink up all the wine
A-ha, ye-eah, my baby got all of me
All of me, all of me
