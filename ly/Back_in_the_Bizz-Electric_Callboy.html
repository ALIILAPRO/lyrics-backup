		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

We're back in the bizz
And it goes like this
Come on motherfucker, put your hands in the air
We don't give a fuck, we are the German nightmare

We are back in the bizz, the scene is under attack
Rims are spinning fast of the deep black Cadillac
Kings of the underground, back on the hunting ground
Stick your hands up, pay the bill, hail the crown
When the score has to settle, push the pedal to the metal
Backyard fights in front of headlight dazzles

We sound like a gun, it goes boom boom pow
Let us share the black credit card and pump up the sound

We're everything that you wanted
Pushed it back where it started
What we made will last forever, forever
We're back from the ashes
Turn hate into passion
What we made will last forever

We're back in the bizz
And it goes like this
Come on motherfucker, put your hands in the air
We don't give a fuck, we are the German nightmare

The EC is back, we put some meth on the track
Spitting rhymes like a shotgun, dead on target
Still the coolest motherfuckers of the hood
Blowing up your speakers everytime our bass drops
2010, sippin' Bombay with a straw
Come into your club, pay the bill with a chainsaw

We sound like a gun, it goes boom boom pow
Let us share the black credit card and pump up the sound

We're everything that you wanted
Pushed it back where it started
What we made will last forever, forever
We're back from the ashes
Turn hate into passion
What we made will last forever

Yeah
I'll tell you once and forever

We're back in the bizz
And it goes like this
Come on motherfucker, put your hands in the air
We don't give a fuck, we are the German nightmare

We're everything that you wanted
Pushed it back where it started
What we made will last forever, forever
We're back from the ashes
Turn hate into passion
What we made will last forever
