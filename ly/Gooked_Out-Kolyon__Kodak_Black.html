		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mic check, see my city it's like nightmare
On elm street these
Niggas a kill yo ass on elm street
See my city, it ain't no pretty sight you
Got thug niggas fuck niggas
And police lights we just round
Here be gooking man

See that molly got em gooking
That flocka got em shooting
That powder keep em moving
These jit's round here getting booted
It go, one for the money two for the bitches
Three for my niggas popping jiggas
They bout they skrilla, see them my niggas
Verse 1: (Koly P) in the city where i live
They jit's getting killed
Dealing methinphetamines
Snort coke pop pills
Man this shit get real nigga
Drop body like tears
Its hard to be the boss
My fault got lost in the sauce
See now my mind is on a million
Its bout to go down like them buildings
Yall fuck niggas rapping
Them real niggas feel me
See Koly back snapping
These pussy want a kill me
In the kitchen Kodak bopping
Fuck wit me and thats a privelage
And I might go see the dentist
With 5 racks in my skinnies
Im with Kodak in a cutlass
Told em fuck it nigga bend it
For my niggas who be hustlin
No cuffing niggas spending
What yall niggas rapping
We already did it it's KKK

See that molly got em gooking
That flocka got em shooting
That powder keep em moving
These jit's round here getting booted
It go, one for the money two for the bitches
Three for my niggas popping jiggas
They bout they skrilla, see them my niggas

Verse 2: (Kodak Black)
Bending corners with that toolie
I might go run down on Soolie
Steady playing wit my cutlass
Said it was gone be ready Tuesday
Coolin but Im never boolin
Booted but Im still not boolin
Every day im slanging cash
Polo let me hold the uzi
Molly got me in hear spinning
Got a young nigga all in my feelings
Trigga finger itching
Clean a nigga up like penicillin
I just called Koly
He'll be pulling up here any minute
Yestersday I saw him in a lamb
Now he in a Bentley
Finessin like a legend call me Paul?
I got to keep a weapon
You know these niggas envy
They Know when im in the building
But they don't know Im jigging
Im turnt up on the highest i might hit for 20

See that molly got em gooking
That flocka got em shooting
That powder keep em moving
These jit's round here getting booted
Two for the bitches
Three for my niggas popping jiggas
They bout they skrilla, see them my niggas
