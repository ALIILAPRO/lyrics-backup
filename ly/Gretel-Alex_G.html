		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I don't wanna go back)
(Nobody's gonna push me off track, uh-huh)
(I don't wanna go back)
(Nobody's gonna push me off track, uh-huh)

It's calling me back
House of Sugar
Did they bury me here?
Daddy, don't let 'em put me down
Daddy, don't let 'em turn me around
Uh, uh

I don't wanna go back
Nobody's gonna push me off track, uh-huh
I see what they do
Good people got something to lose, uh-huh
I don't wanna go back (go back)
Nobody's gonna push me off track, uh-huh
I don't wanna be this (be this)
Good people gotta fight to exist, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh

(I can see it right there, right in front of me)
(I can see it right there, right in front of me)
(I can see it right there, right in front of me)
(I can see it right there, right in front of me)
(I can see it right there, right in front of me)
(I can see it right there, right in front of me)
(I can see it right there, right in front of me)

(I don't wanna go back)
(Nobody's gonna push me off track, uh-huh)
(I don't wanna go back)
(Nobody's gonna push me off track, uh-huh)
(I don't wanna go back)
