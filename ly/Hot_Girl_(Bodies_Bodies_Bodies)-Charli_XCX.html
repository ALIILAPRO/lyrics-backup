		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Yeah

I'm a hot girl, pop girl, rich girl
I'm a bitch girl, fast girl, "Catch me if you can" girl
You a swerve, girl, who the fuck are you, girl?
You just wanna be me
I'm a hot girl, pop girl, rich girl
I'm a bitch girl, fast girl, "Catch me if you can" girl
You a swerve, girl, who the fuck are you, girl?
You just wanna be me

Pull up to the mansion, pull up to the party
All my friends are so hot, we're gonna get it started
Pull up to the mansion but you are not invited
Lip gloss on and I look good

'Cause I'm a hot girl, hot girl, rich girl
I'm a bitch girl, fast girl, "Catch me if you can" girl
You a swerve, girl, who the fuck are you, girl?
You just wanna be me
I'm a hot girl, pop girl, rich girl
I'm a bitch girl, fast girl, "Catch me if you can" girl
You a swerve, girl, who the fuck are you, girl?
You just wanna be me

Woo, woo, ha
Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah, yeah
Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah, yeah
Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo

I'm a hot girl and I come in different flavors
All the hot boys got me as their screensavers
Tall green, money green just like Bottegas
I'm taking off my clothes in the window for the neighbor
'Cause I'm really hot (yeah), dancing in stilettos on the table tops (woo)
Rodeo drive's where I like to shop
And I can race you there in my Bentley truck (vroom vroom)
'Cause when I pull up and step out, I shine (yeah)
I know Tony, I'm cutting the line (hi, Tony)
Yeah, I'm buttery, creamy and vine, my acrylics are on, my white wine (ching)
I travel 'round the globe, Paris Fashion Week and I'm in the front row (bonjour)
I'm going skiing even when the slopes are closed
'Cause I'm so hot with snow up my nose

'Cause I'm a hot girl, pop girl, rich girl
I'm a bitch girl, fast girl, "Catch me if you can" girl
You're a swerve, girl, who the fuck are you, girl?
You just wanna be me
I'm a hot girl, pop girl, rich girl
I'm a bitch girl, fast girl, "Catch me if you can" girl
You're a swerve, girl, who the fuck are you, girl?
You just wanna be me

You just wanna be me
I'm a hot girl
You just wanna be me
You just wanna be me
I'm a hot girl
You just wanna be me, I'm a
You just wanna be me
