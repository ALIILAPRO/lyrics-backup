		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Oh) understand, girl, I'm out of sight
Turn the other side, I don't want no stripes
Got my insides loud like motorcycles
Girl, don't notice it, I don't notice it
And the love make me wanna sing, sing
And my heart make me wanna sing, sing
And the pain make me wanna blink, blink
But I'm in a Rover, I won't feel a thing

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

Guess I've been awake, thinking 'bout our fate
Fighting two devils, blood in my toothpaste
Spit into the night, thought it would be nice
You just make me nervous, you were cold as ice (you're cold)
I was in your town, drivin' eighty miles
Do not even notice, do not even frown
And how could I deserve this, I'm never slowin' down (never slowin' down)
Don't love me at the surface, love me like it's now (love me, love me, love me, love me)

(Oh) understand, girl, I'm out of sight
Turn the other side, I don't want no stripes
Got my insides loud like motorcycles
Girl, don't notice it, I don't notice it
And the love make me wanna sing, sing
And my heart make me wanna sing, sing
And the pain make me wanna blink, blink
But I'm in a Rover, I won't feel a thing
