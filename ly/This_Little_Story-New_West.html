		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I won't run out of songs to tell you I love you
And I won't be done 'til you say I do
And when we grow old babe
Heaven will know that we made it through
Just me and you

It's the way you say hi
When you do you're kind of shy
But not the times when you're with me
And you're too loud when you laugh
When you're talking with your hands
And I just want you to kiss me

But maybe there's more to this little story

Cause I won't run out of songs to tell you I love you
And I won't be done 'til you say I do
And when we grow old babe
Heaven will know that we made it through
Just me and you

And every time we say goodbye
You hold my hand too tight
And then you cry when I kiss you
And every letter that you sign
Theres a heart over the I'
Each time you write I miss you'

When you're lying next to me
And you're talking in your sleep
You're so damn sweet when you're dreaming
And the mornings we wake up
When we've had a bit too much
We made love til the evening

But maybe there's more to this little story

Cause I won't run out of songs to tell you I love you
And I won't be done til you say I do
And when we grow old babe
Heaven will know that we made it through
Just me and you
