		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
(Ayy)

City goin' up (up), so you better bust
Finna see who really one of us
Really spillin' blood (cuz)
Everybody tough 'til they gotta go and see the judge
Nigga better hush (hush)
Remember growin' up, all I wanted was to be a thug
Wanted me a plug (plug) to get a lil' bread
Shoot a couple niggas in the head
Still outside (outside), I don't hide
From this shit for life
Had to fight (I swear) for my life
Took them hits in stride (I swear)
If I die (die) for the guys
Have my candlelight goin' up (up) like the club
After that, go slide (slide)

Are you with that? I won't get back
I'm gon' hop out and crack
Are you with that? (Yeah) I want big racks (yeah)
I'm gon' flock, I'm gon' stack (huh?)
Are you with that? (Ayy) won't forget that (ayy)
Shit I saw in my past (yeah)
Are you with that (yeah) like I'm with that?
Hope you watchin' your back

(Hope you watchin' your back)
(Hope you watchin' your back) yeah
(Hope you watchin' your back) yeah

Whenever I miss those days
Visit my Crips that lay
Under the ground, runnin' around (yeah)
We was them kids that played (dead homies)
All in the street, followin' leads
Of niggas who lost they ways (dead homies)
Some of them outside still (still)
Some of them inside graves
I'm a real beach boy (I'm a real beach boy)
Come ride my wave 
Left me with a either-or
Fill these voids or fill my bank (ayy, ayy)
Blue strips only, you switched on me
Mama told me 'bout you snakes
Keep my shit off safety (yeah)
You know you can never be too safe (you know it)

Are you with that? I won't get back
I'm gon' hop out and crack (ayy, yeah)
Are you with that? I want big racks (with that)
I'm gon' flock, I'm gon' stack (with that)
Are you with that? Won't forget that (with that)
Shit I saw in my past (with that)
Are you with that like I'm with that? (Ayy)
Hope you watching your back (yeah)

Cars screech, I'll be gone
(Hope you watchin' your back)
Watch my back 'cause they gon' run 'em how they come
(Hope you watchin' your back) yeah
Get your block up, get back
Pump first, best not miss that
Tell me if you with that, mmh
