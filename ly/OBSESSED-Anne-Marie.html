		  La, la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la

Oh, my Lord, never met someone like you before
Think I'm kinda going overboard, oh, oh
Now I'm obsessed, how can somebody be so perfect?
Boy, you really got me by the neck
Whatever you want, you just gotta ask

I'll do anything for you, boy, anything
Yeah, I'll do anything, anything for you
Yeah, I'll do crazy shit
And I'll get away with it
Boy, I'll do anything, anything for you

If you go and get yourself somebody new
I don't know what the hell I'd do, oh, oh
But if I found out, I will go and turn up at her house
Break a nail and rip her hair right out
Huh, and I hope you like that I'm crazy like that

I'll do anything for you, boy, anything
Yeah, I'll do anything, anything for you
Yeah, I'll do crazy shit
And I'll get away with it
Boy, I'll do anything, anything for you

Go to Timbuktu, anything
Get your name tattooed, anything
Take a hit for you, anything
Anything for you
Start a fire or two, anything
Nothing I won't do, anything
Kill a bitch for you, anything
Anything for you (la-la-la)

I'll do anything for you, boy, anything
Yeah, I'll do anything (anything), anything for you
Yeah, I'll do crazy shit
And I'll get away with it
Boy, I'll do anything (anything), anything for you

La, la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la
La, la, la-la
