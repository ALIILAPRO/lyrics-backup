		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need a fuckin'
'Cause this shit not smokin'
Aight, yeah

Top ten if you don't agree, I'm on your ass, yeah (no cap), uh
R.I.P. to 2-4, now my foot on the gas (know that), yeah
This shit was given to me, I ain't choose it
Tried to make life and somehow made a movie
The only rapper who can go on the road and don't fuck with no groupies
If it don't make sense or dollars
I ain't got no time, can't holla
I just got off the plane from Ghana
And my airport clothes, they Prada
I work harder than all of the rest
And I'm wishing you all the best
I got bags from all the stress
Now all my bags belong on jets
Yes, so many war wounds, I had to make more tunes
Gotta cancel these niggas, they cancelled
Couldn't even enjoy June
But I'm a living, walking, fun guy
Even though I had some tough times
Made my bed on the frontline
One time for the, one time for the one time

I fought the fight (I fought the fight)
Roll up the dice (roll up the dice)
Bet on my life (bet on my life)
Paid the price
Take no advice (woo)
I been in the field and I know my wrongs, I know my rights (rights)

I fought the fight (I fought the fight)
Roll up the dice (roll up the dice)
Bet on my life (bet on my life)
Paid the price (paid the price)
Take no advice (woo)
I been in the field and I know my wrongs, I know my rights (rights)

Top five if you don't agree
Go check the numbers, too many can't run with me
I'm making moves that's gon' take care of my family
She did me dirty, it fucked up my sanity
Bitches can't handle me
I'm like an animal
Eat it like Hannibal
She got the stamina
She clean the mess up
I keep the checks up
We go get check ups
Gotta stay healthy
Already rich, now I'm tryna get wealthy
I didn't reply back but they get the message
Not saying I'm the best
But I go like the vest
Seen these chains on my neck
AP water, baguette
I'm ahead of the Feds
Keep my head on my neck
Put my foot in your ass
I done ran out of passes to give
This shit get passive for real
I keep on passing on deals
One day I'ma chill
One day I'ma get me a spot in the Hills
But until, I'm serving these packs
Keep on murdering tracks
Keep on rolling the dice
Got my life in this shit
I'ma ride, I cant switch, I'll die for this shit
Bust down both of my wrists
At 11:11, make both us some riches
Yeah, we both would get rich
Yeah, we never could expect
Now I look up, we the G.O.A.T's of this shit

I fought the fight (I fought the fight)
Roll up the dice (roll up the dice)
Bet on my life (bet on my life)
Paid the price (paid the price)
Take no advice (woo)
I been in the field and I know my wrongs, I know my rights (rights)

I fought the fight (I fought the fight)
Roll up the dice (roll up the dice)
Bet on my life (bet on my life)
Paid the price
Take no advice (woo)
I been in the field and I know my wrongs, I know my rights (rights)
