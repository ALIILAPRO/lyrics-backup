		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Brothers, sisters
One day we will be free
From fighting, violence
People crying in the street

Brothers, sisters
One day we will be free
From fighting, violence
People crying in the street

When the angels from above
Fall down and spread their wings like doves
And we'll walk hand in hand
Sisters, brothers, we'll make it to the Promised Land

When the angels from above
Fall down and spread their wings like doves
And we'll walk hand in hand
Sisters, brothers, we'll make it to the Promised Land

You and I
We'll walk the land
And as one, and as one
We'll take our stand

When the angels from above
Fall down and spread their wings like doves
As we'll walk hand in hand
Sisters, brothers, we'll make it to the Promised Land

Oh yeah, Oh yeah
Oh no, Oh no, Oh no
Hand in Hand,promised Land
And spread their wings like doves
Hand in Hand, promised Land
