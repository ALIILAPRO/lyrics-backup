		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The call of the wild's 
Not a whispering wind
It's more like a cry
That gets under your skin
Till one day you fly to close the flame,
Close to the flame

And all of the things 
You leave behind
Catch up with your heart 
And reign in your mind
I know where I belong now
I just hope that it's not too late

Elmira, take me home
And cradle me upon the waves
I still keep you in my soul
Sometimes I count the days

Elmira, you should know
I left but never lost my place
These nights I miss you most
My heart is yours to break

I see you in streets
I dream you in dreams
The sound of your voice
Drowns out the machine
From this far away
I need you one million ways
There's never a day... Goes by...

Elmira, take me home
And cradle me upon the waves
I still keep you in my soul
Sometimes I count the days

Elmira, you should know
I left but never lost my place
These nights I miss you most
My heart is yours to break
My heart is yours to break
My heart is yours to break
My heart is yours to break
