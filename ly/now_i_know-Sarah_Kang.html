		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought it would be like poetry
That feeling of when eyes meet
They said it would feel so easy
Like how a bird takes to the trees
They've written the songs and films and books
Of how it would take just one timely look
To dance and fall your way into love
And that's how you'll know he's the one
It feels like way back when
I wish I had known it then
There's no such thing as a soulmate
'Cause love is what you make of it
I think I've got a taste of it
I wish I had known all of this before
I wish I had known
But at least
Now I know
I thought summer vacation would never end
That feeling of sinking toes in the sand
They said to enjoy it while you can
But those words never seemed to land
It feels like way back when
I wish I had known it then
That time is the quickest of thieves
She won't ever be caught by nobody
She'll run all the way to eternity
I wish I had known all of this before
I wish I had known
But at least
Now I know
It feels like way back when
I wish I had known it then
That soon we'll be gone with a final breath
And there won't be time to hold onto regrets
But I know there's something on the other end
I wish I had known all of this before
I wish I had known
But at least
Now I know
I wish I had known
But at least
Now I know
