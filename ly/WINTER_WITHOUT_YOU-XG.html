		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah, oh, oh

Every year right around this time
People putting up trees and lights
And I been thinking that this don't feel right
'Cause I'm without you

If I could make a list
You'd be the first in it
If I could make a wish
You'd show in a minute
Only if it was that way

But there's some things that I can't chance

So now this ain't winter without you
No more joy no laughter
Wish that I could
Turn it back around
When I'm falling down

So how
How am I supposed to go without you?
Days gone cold so won't you
Say that you'll be home for christmas

I don't care about no mistletoe (mistletoe)
On the dl I still miss you though
Looking cute at
Every Christmas party
Posting on my story
Still a little snowy, yeah

Joyful, joyful, joyful raise your voice
Everybody come and raise your voice
So now hey, let me tell the truth

If I remember we would sit by the fire holding hands
Sweet smell of sugar and spice
Was he a venscent
But like the season you was
Gone with the wind fall winter spring
Back around with my decenber blues
I've been feeling again

So listen
I really wanna know where
We went wrong
I wanna know if you would
Hear this song
And if I could turn back the time
You'd be in my arms again

But there's some things
That I can't chance

So now this ain't winter without you
No more joy no laughter
With that I could
Turn it back around
When I'm falling down

So how
How am I supposed to go without you?
Days gone cold so won't you
Say that you'll be home for Christmas

Heavy snow
Pouring out my window
(Window, oh)
I pray to stars and the angels
No no more lonely nights
No way to hide
Why I need you for sure

So I keep wishing and hoping
You'd walk through the door
(Walk through the door)
Hold me 'cause I know we'll fight through the cold
(Fight through the storm)
As long as I am with my baby please
Hurry up, hurry up
I'll be stay'in up all night

No matter what I unwrap in the morning
I won't be the same I'd play back
Every moment

There's nobody else to run to
Believin' it like it's true
That you would come to rescue
I merry miss you 

Now tell me how
How am I supposed to go without you?
Days gone cold so won't you
Say that you'll be home for Christmas

So now, this ain't winter without you
No more joy no laughter
Wish that I could turn it back around
When I'm falling down

So how
How am I supposed to go without you?
Days gone cold so won't you
Say that you'll be home for Christmas

Woo, baby talk to me now
This is where I'm going down
No need to worry about
Let me turn it around
When it's all falling down
Just tell me how
So baby won't you
