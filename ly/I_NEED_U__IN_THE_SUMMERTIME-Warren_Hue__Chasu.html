		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Life pass too fast, I don't wanna fall short
I brag too much, need to chill up in New York
Why can't we go somewhere else than the food store
I plan to do things with you till the moon shows
Why the mood be too slow, who knows, new phone
I told the cab to reverse like UNO, yellow
I don't exist in your eyes, bitch, like pluto, pluto
Hello, I'm right here, shift the gears, skrt
Shine like chandeliers, I appeared, where you at, bitch

Where you at?
Baby, where you at, at, at?
Where you at?
I just wanna fall in love in the summertime (summertime, summertime)
I just wanna see you at half past nine (where you at? Where you at? Ay)

I'm too clingy for you, baby, wait up (wait up)
Meet me at our favourite location (ooh)
I'm on the way to you, I know I'm late again (yeah)
The sun is getting lower, so let's make amends
And I don't wanna spend time if I'm all alone
I need you all the time, I feel uncomfortable
I'm on the way to you I know I'm late again
The sun is getting lower, so let's make amends

Whatsapp status online, send me the loc', ay
Don't need the box, she like a sunny mirage
When I arrive, ay, five minute tops
Let's work it out like pilates, ay
Let's work it out, baby, I'm jogging the block I need the destination
Running out of time, IGOR
My ego higher than an eagle
Zero change trying to find you
You too rare like the T-bones
I chew, come through, we can relate, huh
Alien, it's an invasion
Bitch, I wear Nike, I don't really need to impress (huh)
Bitch, yeah my veins poppin', need some SOS (huh)
Ten out of ten, we like Barbie and Ken
Bonnie and Clyde, fuck yeah, we in disguise
I'm trying to see through your mind, uh

Where you at?
Baby, where you at, at, at?
Where you at?
I just wanna fall in love in the summertime (summertime, summertime)
I just wanna see you at half past nine

I'm too clingy for you, baby, wait up (wait up)
Meet me at our favourite location (ooh)
I'm on the way to you, I know I'm late again (yeah)
The sun is getting lower, so let's make amends
And I don't wanna spend time if I'm all alone
I need you all the time, I feel uncomfortable
I'm on the way to you I know I'm late again
The sun is getting lower, so let's make amends
