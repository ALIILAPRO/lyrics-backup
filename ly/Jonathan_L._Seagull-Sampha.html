		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Even though we've been through the same
Doesn't always mean we feel the same (no)
Doesn't always mean we heal the same
You are not me and that's okay (that's okay)
Seasons come and seasons cry
Seasons grow and seasons die
How high can a bird ever fly, ever fly?

Couldn't stomach those blues you articulate
I've been
Acting like your actions are from outer space
But I understand that I've been out of place
Driving late night back home through the London rain to you

I puzzle into your embrace
Now take me far, far away
I puzzle into your embrace
Now take me far, far away

Making life decisions based on what's been laid
We've both dealt with loss and grief in separate ways 
(Listen to your heartbeat beat)
On the same track running at a different pace
Will I catch up or will you just race away someday?

Puzzle into your embrace
Now take me far, far away
Puzzle into your embrace
Now take me far, far away

Even though we've been through the same
Doesn't always mean we feel the same
You are not me and that's okay (that's okay)
You are not me and that's okay
Seasons come, seasons cry (cry)
Seasons grow and seasons die
How high can a bird ever fly, ever fly?
