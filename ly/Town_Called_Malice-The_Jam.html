		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Better stop dreaming of the quiet life, 'cause it's the one we'll never know
And quit running for the runaway bus 'cause those rosy days are few
And stop apologizing for the things you've never done
'Cause time is short and life is cruel but it's up to us to change
This town called malice

Rows and rows of disused milk floats stand dying in the dairy yard
And a hundred lonely housewives clutch empty milk bottles to their hearts
Hanging out their old love letters on the line to dry
It's enough to make you stop believing when tears come fast and furious
In a town called malice, yeah

Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, oh
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

Struggle after struggle, year after year
The atmosphere's a fine blend of ice, I'm almost stone cold dead
In a town called malice, ooh yeah

A whole street's belief in Sunday's roast beef
Gets dashed against the Co-op
To either cut down on beer or the kid's new gear
It's a big decision in a town called malice, ooh yeah

(Ooh)

The ghost of a steam train, echoes down my track
It's at the moment bound for nowhere
Just going round and round, oh
Playground kids and creaking swings
Lost laughter in the breeze
I could go on for hours and I probably will
But I'd sooner put some joy back
In this town called malice, yeah

(Ooh)

In this town called malice, yeah
In this town called malice, ooh yeah
