		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time goes quick it's passing by
Bitch I don't know where am i
Yea I love to call you mine
Yea I love to call you mine
Little bitch you stole my heart
Yea you fucked me up so bad
Time goes quick it's passing by
Bitch I don't know where am i
Yea I love to call you mine
Yea I love to call you mine
Little bitch you stole my heart
Yea you fucked me up so bad
Don't hit me up about your needs
Sorry I don't give a shit
I only care about my closest ones
Here comes another little bitch
Ye if you tryna fuck with us
You end up in a ditch
Ain't talking shit
These mothefuckers want some clout
You can keep on chasing numbers
Bitch I never gave a fuck bout no fuck
Close my dms
Take a break
Ye I ain't need no new friends
Ye I'm better on my own, with no one
Time goes quick it's passing by
Bitch I don't know where am i
Yea I love to call you mine
Yea I love to call you mine
Little bitch you stole my heart
Yea you fucked me up so bad
Time goes quick it's passing by
Bitch I don't know where am i
Yea I love to call you mine
Yea I love to call you mine
Little bitch you stole my heart
Yea you fucked me up so bad
Time goes quick it's passing by
Bitch I don't know where am i
Yea I love to call you mine
Yea I love to call you mine
Little bitch you stole my heart
Yea you fucked me up so bad
