		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're all ready to have some fucking fun here tonight, right?
Well you all came to the right place.
Now we're doing some shit uh, from the And Justice For All album
And I know you guys are ready to sing loud as a mother fuck
So uh, no worries here
You're going to put your eyeballs on Jason,
Cause he's going to show you what the fuck to do here.

Keep it going Mexico City!

My life suffocates
Planting seeds of hate
I've loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fate
I give
You take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth

Anger
Misery
You'll suffer unto me

Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow

Come on man, get it. Whoa!

Pure black looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to me
Get back which used to be
Drink up
Shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain
Your loss becomes my gain

Anger
Misery
You'll suffer unto me

Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow

All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmares
See into my eyes
You'll find where murder lies

Infanticide

Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow
Harvester of sorrow
Harvester of sorrow
Harvester of sorrow
Harvester of sorrow
