		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't taint this ground
With the color of the past
Are the sounds in bloom with you
Cause you seem like
An orchard of mines
Just take one step at a time

And you seem
To break like time
So fragile on the inside
You climb these grapevines
Would you look now
Unto this pit of me on the ground
And you wander through these
To climb these grapevines
Vines

I say it to be proud
Won't have my life turn upside down
Says the man with some
With some gold forged plan
Of life so incomplete
Like weights strapped around my feet
Tread careful one step at a time

And you seem
To break like time
So fragile on the inside
You climb these grapevines
Would you look now
Unto this pit of me on the ground
And you wander through these
To climb these grapevines

To know
To feel
To play me once again
Do you denote from what we feel
Do you not know
I see you play the game
Do you denote

La flama niposa
La ombra dispare
La noce immortale
La voce murmure

To know
To feel
To play me once again
Do you denote
Do you not know
I see you play the game
Denote
