		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Red dirt, wear it like a badge on your work boots
White t-shirt that you sweat through, oh, lovin' that view
Workin' that land looks good on you
Blue jeans, all torn out from the wild fence
Old red diesel you're ridin', oh, you and that Ford
Nah, they don't make 'em like that no more

Bring back them Carhartt's baby
Break out them old Lucchese's
Black Stetson keep the sun out your eyes
My shotgun ride or die
"Yes, ma'am" with a southern accent
Stand up for what needs standing
Thank God I got a man like that
Look at you bring cowboy back

Real men, once they give their word, they don't go back
Takes a little more than a Bass Pro cap and a scole ringin' back
I want the whole truck not the trucker hat

Bring back them Carhartt's baby
Break out them old Lucchese's
Black Stetson keep the sun out your eyes
My shotgun ride or die
"Yes, ma'am" with a southern accent
Stand up for what needs standing
Thank God I got a man like that
Look at you bring cowboy back

Bring back them Carhartts baby
Break out them old Lucchese's
Black Stetson keep the sun out your eyes
My shotgun ride or die
"Yes, ma'am" with a southern accent
Stand up for what needs standing
Thank God I got a man like that
Look at you bring cowboy back

Oh, yeah
Oh, bringin' cowboy back
