		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please save a kid that needs some help
And I can't begin to think of anything that could help
But the weed is guaranteed indeed
Just what I need
How I feel upon a time
So recent in time make me sad
When I recollect how it use to be like David and Goliath
Kinda like me and the Devil
Tryna rip out my soul
Tryna catch a nigga on sleep no no
You can try again and I'll be ready
Wont let you kill me in my dream like Freddy Kruger
No I'm not no loser I'll see you in hell

At the end of the day, day
My momma told me don't let no one break me
Let no one break me
At end of the day, day,
Nobody, nobody, ever could stop me
Ever could stop me
At the end of the day, day
You cant regret it if you were trying
If you were trying
At the end of the day, day
I'm walking with a heart of a lion, yea

Please save a kid that needs some help
And I can't see ahead of me so I'm moving stealth
Hide and seek within a dream
I seem to glide above my horror
Though I feel I'll never be complete
Inside the dark I borrow
To proceed and remain intact
My mental is so unstable
And they talk and judge a man
They have no clue of what I'm capable
'til I show a side of me
No one had thought could be within
I told ya, no I'm not no loser
I'll see you in hell

At the end of the day, day
My momma told me don't let no one break me
Let no one break me
At end of the day, day,
Nobody, nobody, ever could stop me
Ever could stop me
At the end of the day, day
You cant regret it if you were trying
If you were trying
At the end of the day, day
I'm walking with a heart of a lion, yea

No, no, no, no, no, no, no yea no yea (the heart of lion)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no yea no yea (the heart of lion)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no yea no yea (the heart of lion)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no yea no yea (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'm just a kid who needs no help I've achieved
A bigger thing no cash or check could be more blessed
And if you would've seen the things I've seen
Up in my slumber you'd be sure stay awake
No need to run your fate would follow you
You should know not for the faint at heart
This world understands no cowards
Its a goal a simple code I stay on the grind 'til the 25th hour
And I know the fight in me is somewhere
Hiding deep within I told you no
I'll never let you drag me down to hell no

At the end of the day, day
My momma told me don't let no one break me
Let no one break me
At end of the day, day,
Nobody, nobody, ever could stop me
Ever could stop me
At the end of the day, day
You cant regret it if you were trying
If you were trying
At the end of the day, day
I'm walking with a heart of a lion, yea

No, no, no, no, no, no, no yea no yea (yeah, yeah, yeah)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no yea no yea (yeah, yeah, yeah)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no yea no yea (yeah, yeah, yeah)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no yea no yea (yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
