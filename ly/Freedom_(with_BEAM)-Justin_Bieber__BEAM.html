		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Big up to my brother
Blessed sons and daughters 
We all lookin' for the answers 
We in search of living water 
Too blind to see the Messiah 
Are you weary? Are you tired? 
Runnin' on empty, feelin' the fire 
Mmm, the Devil is a liar 
The story's already written 
Children, you are forgiven, yeah 
Ain't nothin' you could do for you to change that 
And everything you did, He erased that 
Yeah, He took it all and threw it in the wasteland 

Freedom, don't it feel good? (Mmm) 
Freedom, don't it feel good? 
Freedom, don't it feel good? (Mmm) 
Freedom, don't it feel good? (Bah) 

Big up to our Father (big) 
If you call pon Him, Him answer (brrt) 
All we need ah the begotten son to prosper (yeah, yeah) 
The dead resurrected, the Devil tried test it, him lost 
Him lose again (mmm) 
Head bruise again (mm-hmm-hmm) 
Sweat, blood, tears pon the cross 
Did you know He paid the cost for you? 
Work over North, West, South and East 
Easter Sunday, bun and cheese 
Good Friday fish and bammy
One table and one family 
All of the times when mi cry for The Most High
God said, "Nuh worry about it, my love abundant, trust in mine" (mmm) 

Freedom, don't it feel good? (Mmm) 
Freedom, don't it feel good? 
Freedom, don't it feel good? (Mmm) 
Freedom, don't it feel good?
