I'm a player, how the hell you turn me lovey-dovey?
I make you opposite of leavin', that's every time we fuckin' (I make you cum)
I'm a gangsta, how the hell you turn me kissy-huggy?
I show you outdoor affection, I love on you in public
I'm a player, how the hell you turn me lovey-dovey?
I make you opposite of leavin', that's every time we fuckin' (I make you cum)
I'm a gangsta, how the hell you turn me kissy-huggy?
I show you outdoor affection, I love on you in public

I put hickies on your neck and hickies on your coochie
I go from lickin' down your back to lickin' on your booty
I wanna hear you moan and scream, ain't fuckin' to no music
To me, your voice so pretty but I always make you lose it
Girl, I love you and you know I do (know I do)
Like you said, this shit forever
I can't see me gettin' tired of you (gettin' tired of you)
I block them other bitches out my view (fuck them other hoes)
I know all you see is me so the only girl that I see is you (all I see is you)
She my street assistant, she take me to make my plays
She my street assistant, put my weapons in her name
She my street assistant, tell me when the police hot
She my street assistant, put my bullets in my Glock
Bae, I'm hungry, but I just ate
I'm full from food but I wanna eat you 
Until you shake like earthquake (shake like earthquake)
Hit from the back, it sound like patty cake
All that clappin' got the water from your kitty splashin' on my face (splashin' on my face)

I'm a player, how the hell you turn me lovey-dovey?
I make you opposite of leavin', that's every time we fuckin' (I make you cum)
I'm a gangsta, how the hell you turn me kissy-huggy?
I show you outdoor affection, I love on you in public (public)
I'm a player, how the hell you turn me lovey-dovey?
I make you opposite of leavin', that's every time we fuckin' (I make you cum)
I'm a gangsta, how the hell you turn me kissy-huggy?
I show you outdoor affection, I love on you in public

I'm a gangsta, how the hell you turn me kissy-huggy?
I'm a player, how the hell you turn me lovey-dovey?
I'm a gangsta, how the hell you turn me kissy-huggy?
I'm a player, how the hell you turn me lovey-dovey? (Turn me lovey-dovey)
(How you turn me lovey-dovey?)
