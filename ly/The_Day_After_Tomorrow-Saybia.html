		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please tell me why do birds

Sing when you're near me?

Sing when you're close to me?

They say that I'm a fool

For loving you deeply

Loving you secretly


But I crash in my mind

Whenever you are near

Getting deaf, dumb and blind

Just drowning in despair

I am lost in your flame

It's burning like the sun

And I call out your name

The moment you are gone


Please tell me why can't I

Breathe when you're near me?

Breathe when you're close to me?

I know you know I'm lost

In loving you deeply

Loving you secretly

Secretly


But I crash in my mind

Whenever you are near

Getting deaf, dumb and blind

Just drowning in despair

I am lost in your flame

It's burning like the sun

And I call out your name

The moment you are gone


Tomorrow

I'll tell it all tomorrow

Or the day after tomorrow

I'm sure I'll tell you then


Well I crash in my mind

Whenever you are near

Getting deaf, dumb and blind

Just drowning in despair

I am lost in your flame

It's burning like the sun

And I call out your name

The moment you are gone

The moment you are gone
