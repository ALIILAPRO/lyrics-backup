		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The following is a true story
Only the names have been changed
To protect the guilty

Well I left my job in my home town
And I headed for the smoke
Got a rock 'n' roll band and a fast right hand
Gonna get to the top
Nothing's gonna stop us, no nothing

So if you've got the money, we've got the sound
You put it up and we'll put it down
If you've got the dollar, we got the song
Just want to boogie woogie all night long
Yeah boogie

I got holes in my shoes
I got holes in my teeth
I got holes in my socks
I can't get no sleep
I'm trying to make a million

And I got patches on the patches
On my old blue jeans
Well they used to be blue
When they used to be new
When they used to be clean

But I've got a Momma whose a hummer
Whose keeping me alive
While I'm in the band doing drinking with the boys
She's working 9 to 5
She knows her place that woman

Just you wait,
One of these days see me driving round town
In my rockin' Rolls Royce with the sun roof down
My bottle of booze
No summer time blues
Shouting out, look at me
In my rock 'n' roll voice

Ain't no fun waiting 'round to be a millionaire
Ooo it ain't no fun, waiting 'round to be a millionaire
Do you believe me, it ain't no fun, waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
It ain't no fun, I don't care what they say
Hangin' 'round to be a millionaire
Drive a Rolls Royce car
No it ain't no fun, waiting 'round to be a millionaire
No no no no no no no no
No ain't no fun, hangin' 'round to be a millionaire

Said it ain't no fun
Ain't no fun, oh no
No it ain't no fun
Ain't no fun, that's what I said
Yeah it ain't no fun
Ain't no fun, and you ain't even rich
No it ain't no fun
Ain't no fun, its no fun doin' this bitch

Ain't no fun waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
You better believe it
Ain't no fun waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
Ain't no fun waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
No it ain't no fun waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
No it ain't no fun
Ain't no fun
No it ain't no fun
Ain't no fun
It ain't nothing no fun
Ain't no fun
No it ain't no fun
Ain't no fun
Ain't no fun waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
No no
Ain't no fun waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
Yeh it ain't no fun waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
No it ain't no fun waitin' 'round to be a millionaire

Hey, hello Howard, how you doin'babe, next door neighbor?
Oh yea,
Get your fuckin' jumbo jet out of my airport
It ain't no fun
It ain't no fun
It ain't no fun
No it ain't no fun
No ain't no fun, hangin' 'round to be a millionaire
Ain't no fun waiting 'round to be a millionaire
No it ain't no fun waiting 'round to be a millionaire
Ain't no fun
No no no no no no
