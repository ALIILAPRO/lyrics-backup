		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  These houses have so many rooms
I've seen a lot of strangers too
But I couldn't find you
Just you
But you're no ghost in my mind
And my eyes can find you

I'm struck by lightning
You could be my high, for sure
Baby now I want to shout out loud
I know it's you I've found
I wanna get to know you

You'll be my stranger
That saves the day
Can you be my stranger
That saves the day

Nah, nah-nah, nah-nah aha
Nah, nah-nah, nah-nah
Saves the day

These houses have so many rooms
Crystal light and iron tombs
God is upon you
Just you
You're different
An alien
Lets run away into the shadows, shadows

I'm struck by lightning
You could be my high, for sure
Baby now I want to shout out loud
I know it's you I've found
I wanna get to know you
Get to know you

You'll be my stranger
That saves the day
Can you be my stranger
That saves the day

Nah, nah-nah, nah-nah
Nah, nah-nah, nah-nah
Nah, nah-nah, nah-nah aha
Nah, nah-nah, nah-nah aha

Nah, nah-nah, nah-nah
Nah, nah-nah, nah-nah
Nah, nah-nah, nah-nah aha
Nah, nah-nah, nah-nah aha
