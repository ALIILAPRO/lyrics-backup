		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Our mistake was the love we made
I didn't deliberate 
But I never meant you wrong
No I didn't mean it 

If you've ever lost a loved one
I pray for you I really do 
If you've ever lost a loved one
I pray for you 

â??Cause there's a sad and lonely comfort 
In the hollow of your eyes 
But don't you let it take you over
â??Cause it will eat you up inside 

I heard you're married to a house carpenter
And your love will never be mineâ?¦

If you're not breathing why am I 
Left alone in this ship 
If you're not breathing 
Why am I left alone? 
With a sad and lonely comfort
Of the hollow in your eyes 
But don't you let it take me under 
â??Cause it will eat me up inside 

I'm sure you're married to your house carpenter
And your love will never be mine â?¦

All the pain and the way it was 
All of the pain and the way because 
I was in love with the way it was 
All that I do
I do it for you 

All the pain in the way it was 
All of the shame and the hate because 
I was in love with the way it was 
All that I do
I do it for you 
If you're not breathing 
Why am I left alone in this shit? 
If you're not breathing 
Why am I left alone?

With a sad and lonely comfort 
Of the hollow in your eyes 
But don't let it take me over 
â??Cause it will eat me up inside 

I'm sure you're buried with your house carpenter
And your face I'll never see no more 
Your face I'll never see no more 
Your face
Your face 
Your face 
Your face

With a sad and lonely comfort 
Of the hollow in your eyes 
Don't let it take me under
â??Cause it will eat me up inside 

Yeah I heard your married to a house carpenter
And your love will never me mine
Your love will never be mineâ?¦
