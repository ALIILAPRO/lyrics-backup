		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It looked so good from the outside, I couldn't wait to join the crowd.
It all looked different on the inside,
It must have been my imagination,
I felt so sure that was where I wanted to be...

I thought I'd get out of the city, I took a trip down to the sea.
I didn't stay too long 'cause there was nothing there but sky and ocean,
Oh yeah, it must have been my imagination,
I really thought that was where I wanted to be...

Looking for something that might have some meaning,
Looking for something that might make me feel alive.
Looking around for the right situation
Where I can believe what's happening right in front of my eyes.

I think I'll stay in one position, and just leave well enough alone.
I'm never satisfied 'til I've been disillusioned,
Oh yeah, it must be my imagination,
I always think there's a better place to be...

Looking for something that might have some meaning,
Looking for something that might make me feel alive.
Looking around for the right situation
Where I can believe what's happening right in front of my eyes.
