		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No hablo espanol
But uno that my drink do
Whole lotta tugs in the spot
Whole lotta racks
Whole lotta drug misuse
When it gets late
I reminisce
Can't say that I don't miss you
But I gotta get back to the cash flow
Uno
I can't get whipped like pistol

Is it 5
Is it fendi
5EB
Or knkrt hippy
Back then
Buck bro at the chippy
Same place
That he would go buck his nitties
Aye
I'm sippin on red
Bitch no I ain't sippin on whisky
Got bad ones all on my dick now
Uback in secondary
They was all dissinn

Nah i can't lie that's cap
In my secondary's
Yearbook they said who's the next 5 but it ain't like that
Cuz I'm one in a trillion and you just an average joe or jack
Type of guy I would hit for a zip
Then send twin there u with finna get jack

They tryna book man all over the globe
Back then I would do free bookings
Twins still in the
T house cooking
Back then it weren't just tunes
I was pushing
Washed up yutes try push an agenda
Coz they ain't seen all the work we put in
Nah
Need a doc real soon
For
The fuckboys looking

Shit
They ain't even got no motion
Ain't even tryna go make them a way
Me n Lkizz
Need matching whips
Matching cartiers
On the frames
I'm a grown ass man
Not a PS2
So shawty
She
Know that she can't play games
Aye
She know Imma dip out
Like have a good day

Got a couple of issues
They fucking my mental
I been wanting to tell tell you
But I know ppl can judgemental
So I just get to the readies
Regular day
Imma stick to the schedule
Yh
Got me laying my pain
Over this instrumental
She calling me daddy
But I ain't parental

Like I ain't ya pops
Bae
I ain't got no pops
Bae
I got knots on knots
And there ain't no opps
In this spot bae
Aye
Like
Lil uzi
I know u wanna rock bae
Like
PUSSY MONEY AND WEED
WHAT I NEED LIKE ROCKY

No hablo espanol
But uno that my drink do
Whole lotta tugs in the spot
Whole lotta racks
Whole lotta drug misuse
When it gets late
I reminisce
Can't say that I don't miss you
But I gotta get back to the cash flow
Uno
I can't get whipped like pistol

Liek I ain't ya pops
Bae
I ain't got no pops
Bae
I got knots on knots
And there ain't no opps
In this spot bae
Aye
Like uzi
I know u wanna rock bae
Like
PUSSY MONEY AND WEED
WHAT I NEED LIKE ROCKY

Like I ain't ya pops
Bae
I ain't got no pops
Bae
I got knots on knots
And there ain't no opps
In this spot bae
Aye
Like uzi
I know u wanna rock bae
Like
PUSSY MONEY AND WEED
WHAT I NEED LIKE ROCKY
