		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want a talk show
Guess that'll have to do
Up all night
Baby I meant you
Outta tylenol
Head still aches
Got enough strength to flip a paincake
Got the luggage packed
Waiting by the front
Quarter after five
It's already one
I'll say it one last time
Walking out the door 4:59

5:15 not a minute more
Ready for the knock on my door
5:15 not a minute more
Ready for the waves on my shore
And at 5:16 if you're not with me
You can catch me in the next city
Never knew you meant that much to me
Until 5:15

I think I've come done
Sick on puppy love
Wanna break out
Think I've had enough
The walls are caving in
And my thick skin is feeling kinda thin
You find your way back in
Never thought it meant
When we came to June
I would feel this way about you
But I'll say it one last time
I'm walking out the door for 4:59

5:15 not a minute more
Ready for the knock on my door
5:15 not a minute more
Ready for the waves on my shore
And at 5:16 if you're not with me
You can catch me in the next city
Never knew you meant that much to me
Until 5:15

Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na na

At 5:15
Ready for the knock on my door
5:15 not a minute more
Ready for the waves on my shore
And at 5:16 if you're not with me
You can catch me in the next city
Never knew you meant that much to me
Until 5:15

I won't wait another minute, no
When the waves are at my shore
Ready for the waves on my shore
And at 5:16 if you're not with me
You can catch me in the next city
Never knew you meant that much to me
Until 5:15

Five oohh
Oohh hey
I won't wait for you, hey, hey
Until 5:15 mmm
Hey
