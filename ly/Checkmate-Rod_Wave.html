		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lost in my feelings, runnin' out of love
Sometimes, get in my feelings
It's just sometimes, in my feelings, yeah
Like, this shit really like War Dogs, you know?
Just through that life with all these cuts and bruises and scars
I'm the Michael Corleone of this shit, you know?

Okay, lost in my feelings, runnin' out of love
Sometimes, I get in my feelings when codeine in my blood
Most times, I be trippin', reminiscin' 'bout us
But I gotta stand on business, ten toes no matter what
You know life is like a chess game, gotta think it through (yeah, yeah)
Gotta make your next move your best move
And what's happenin', Uncle Dee? I probably never could repay you (what up?)
Helped me chase my dream, found my dream and went major
And these niggas haters, shot my whole truck up
Beef, we ain't squashin', never gettin' fucked up
And I really fuck with bruh, hope he got the message I sent
It's on the floor, stay out the car with them jits (yeah, yeah)

So many war wounds, so many nights all alone
God blessed the child that could hold his own
And you can wave your white flag all you want (you want)
I want you to know
I'ma pay you back for that one
I'ma pay you back for that one (yeah, yeah)
I gotta pay you back for that one
I'ma pay you back for that one (that one)
Pay you back for that one (yeah)
I'ma pay you back for that one
I gotta pay you back for that one (yeah, yeah)
I'ma get you back for that one, uh

Okay, now tell me how this bitch found it in her heart to cross me
I had your back since we was little, can't forget you or forgive you
Since we first got together, know we had some stormy weather
But you ain't make this shit no better
Now it's up, it's stuck forever
And I'm on that dope so bad right now that I can't feel a thing
Codeine cups to the brain, smilin' through my pain
Like dancin' in the rain, yeah
When you smilin' through your pain
It feel like dancin' in the rain

So many war wounds, so many nights all alone
God blessed the child that could hold his own
And you can wave your white flag all you want (you want)
I want you to know
I'ma pay you back for that one
I'ma pay you back for that one
I gotta pay you back for that one
I'ma pay you back for that one (I'ma get you back for that one)
I'ma pay you back for that one (yeah)
I'ma pay you back for that one
I gotta pay you back for that one
I'ma get you back for that one, yeah

I don't give a fuck if I die tryin', bitch knew, swear to God
Swear to God, I don't give a fuck, you heard me?
One, a year, you know what I'm sayin'?
A day
Ten years, you know what the fuck, nigga, you know?
I'ma get you, I'ma get you though
Grrah
