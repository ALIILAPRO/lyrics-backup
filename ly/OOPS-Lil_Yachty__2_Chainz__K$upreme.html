		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Polo Boy Shawty on the track, so I am killin' it

Never needed nothin', nigga
Canary yellow diamonds like the wrapper of a Butterfinger
Hit him, then my brother follow up, that's a double stinger
Told the bitch, "True" she runnin' 'round like she Jerry Springer
It could be an opera singer
Two speedin' tickets in a month, that's the Bentley Coupe
Split the check, half with the gang, that's what brothers do
Check a bitch, checkmate, check, please, who?
Two cribs, six cars, under twenty-two

Oops, oops, ooh
Fuck a nigga's bitch, I'm like, "Oops" (oops)
Pass her to the gang, nigga, that's an alley-oop (oop)
Ridin' 'round town in an all-white coupe (yeah)
Gang of bad bitches blow a nigga like soup (yeah)
You was buyin' Polos, I was buyin' coupes
Oops, oops, oops, oops (2 Chainz)

Man you still rockin' them Ray Bans (Ray Bans)
Them sure look like Ray Bans (woo)
Took a brick, then got a spray tan (hah)
Represent the A like an exam
Lie in front of the block, shine in the dark
Grind a la carte, time on the clock
Can't get it back, where you niggas at?
So Shimins ease, can't take a nap (tell 'em)
Tired of the fraternize
I am as real as they advertise (yeah)
I like the pussy with sanitize (true)
She left her thong, tried to sabatoge
Bitch, you know I got a main (got a main)
I got my pockets on Country Kane
Gator shit on like a Florida game
If you spill somethin' on me, I wouldn't get a stain
Oops, oops

Oops, oops, ooh
Fuck a nigga's bitch, I'm like, "Oops" (oops)
Pass her to the gang, nigga, that's an alley-oop (oop)
Ridin' 'round town in an all-white coupe (yeah)
Gang of bad bitches blow a nigga like soup (yeah)
You was buyin' Polos, I was buyin' coupes
Oops, oops, oops, oops

Racks up, fat knots
Deep bass, big watts
Six cars, young Yacht
Too rich, clean stitch (woo)
Lean fixed, grilless
New whip black as Seal, sis
Diamonds all real, sis
Your daughter my gutta bitch
The belly gettin' bigger (woo)
Might put some ice on my trigger (huh)
Choppa start singin' like Trigga (Trigga)
Don't fuck with me, nigga
Yeah, late night, I'm out with your bitch
Someone took a pic, ooh (yuh)
What that is up on my wrist?
That's a whole brick, Lil Boat

Oops, oops, ooh
Fuck a nigga's bitch, I'm like, "Oops" (oops)
Pass her to the gang, nigga, that's an alley-oop (oop)
Ridin' 'round town in an all-white coupe (yeah)
Gang of bad bitches blow a nigga like soup (yeah)
You was buyin' Polos, I was buyin' coupes
Oops, oops, oops, oops
