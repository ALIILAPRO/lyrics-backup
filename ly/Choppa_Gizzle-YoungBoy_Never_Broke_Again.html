		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Just run that beat from lil' Ken)
Who wanna fuck with a nigga? Then do somethin', do somethin'
You don't like me, lil' nigga? Then do somethin', do somethin'
Wah, haha

And now you know me
Play me like a ho, gon' need the police
Hit your block, ain't gotta roll deep
I send one nigga for to get you
It's one nigga to come and split you
I'm in my mansion with gorillas
Baking cakes for all you pussy niggas
Lean running over, bitch gon' ride me like a rollercoaster
Fuck my partner when it's over
Strap that chopper to my shoulder, stand over 'em like a soldier
Get the executive peeled, bitch, don't try to fuck me over
Petey Pablo, own jail like I'm Pablo
Hold on, check the side note, make sure that his mind blow
Rich as fuck, strung out on dope
Tryna get active with your ho
Try to act off while I cope, I'll let you know, bitch

I keep that rocket, lil' nigga, I'll shoot somethin', shoot somethin'
You don't like me, lil' nigga? Then do somethin', do somethin'
You got a problem, lil' nigga? Then prove somethin', blew somethin'
Already know when I'm comin' there, bitch, I'm tryna screw somethin'

Who got me full of loose screws? I'ma take 'em all the way out for 'em
My youngins don't do school, so I'm tryna make a way out for 'em
I need a new deal, bitch, I call that winnin' the playoffs for 'em
We go and buy new grills, plenty diamonds, bitch, and plenty guns
I'm in the Melpomene, like Pistol P, I get them fires and do 'em
I'm in this bitch with them roosters, they'll bust you up early morning
Bitch, I catch your mama yawning, shot as soon we spotted homie
Pussy bitch, I ain't your cuz, you play, I'm gon' put blood up on you
Kill me, you gon' die from staining, know that I'm a problem, nigga
I ain't tryna kill you, I'ma hit your security with that chopper, nigga
Bang out like I'm Flocka, nigga, cut a head and flop a nigga
Pussy playing with my daughter mama
Bitch, I'ma turn your daughter to a bopper, nigga
Gotta make sure lil' Top pop this nigga, I'm a perfect killing thinker
Find his address and spray paint his house that it's nice to meet you
Fuck that song, I don't need you, bitch, you dealing with a creature
I'ma catch you and snipe your pussy ass from top the bleachers

I keep that rocket, lil' nigga, I'll shoot somethin', shoot somethin'
You don't like me, lil' nigga? Then do somethin', do somethin'
You got a problem, lil' nigga? Then prove somethin', blew somethin'
Already know when I'm comin' there, bitch, I'm tryna screw somethin'
I keep that rocket, lil' nigga, I'll shoot somethin', shoot somethin'
You don't like me, lil' nigga? Then do somethin', do somethin'
You got a problem, lil' nigga? Then prove somethin', blew somethin'
Already know when I'm comin' there, bitch, I'm tryna screw somethin'
