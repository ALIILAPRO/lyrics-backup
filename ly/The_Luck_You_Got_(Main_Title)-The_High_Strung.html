		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Think of all the luck you got 
Know that it's not for naught 
You were beaming once before 
But it's not like that anymore 

Count all the moods you've known 
Know they're not stuck in stone 
You were patient once before 
But it's not like that anymore 

What is this down side 
That you speak of 
What is this feeling 
You're so sure of 

Round up the friends you got 
Know that they're not for naught 
You were willing once before 
But it's not like that anymore 

The time that you would never trade 
Is equal to the effort made 
You were simple once before 
But it's not like that anymore 

What is this down side 
That you speak of 
What is this feeling 
You're so sure of 

What is this down side 
That you speak of 
What is this feeling 
You're so sure of
