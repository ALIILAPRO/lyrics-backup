		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel
I feel tired
Awake all night
Heads so heavy like a waste basket

I feel choke
Emotionally broke
Everything comes around still at the night

I feel alone
I want out
I want on my own
I want everything I own

I find letters, pictures
Memories of which I can't seem to let go
In your bedside table in your pocket in your wallet
You'll know

Abusive
A stranger in bed
Elusive
Forget everything you said
You've got the right to have that hand on your own
But the moment you hit it you're on your own

You already took over
Want now you want to hit the road
In love like a steamboat running on 'need to float'

I don't need 5 times a day
To tell me to go

3 6 9
You drink wine
Monkey on your back you feel just fine

Free
Free, everything you ever wanted

Fuck me
