		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was honest for the second time
I guess that wasn't really what you had in mind
Said that you could like me if you wanted to
Then followed me around until I talked to you
And could you tell that you were scaring me?
Called me crying
Said you thought you were in love with me
Cut my hair enough that I wont look the same
Maybe it gets easier in seventh grade

I'd already had enough then
I already gave an answer and still, it wouldn't end
you didn't care what I said
Guess it was just another rule that you could bend
We used to be friends

Even at my best, I'm still just small to you
Dragged me halfway down the hall cause it was easy to
What a funny feeling when you're pushed around
You don't even know you're falling til your on the ground

I'd already had enough then
I already swore to be the person I'd defend
Carry me to the deep end
What could be worse than having nothing to depend on?
We used to be friends

You were just waiting on the call
I never cared for it at all
You were so hopelessly dissolved
I never wanted you to take the fall
Take the fall
