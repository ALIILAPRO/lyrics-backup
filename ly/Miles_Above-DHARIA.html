		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  3 AM now
With you on my mind
A...a...a
'Cause your aura got me hypnotized
Mhm..m...m

All the smiles and looks we can't undo
Make me think you want me too
All the stories in your mind
From your lips straight to my heart

I'm feeling like you're hiding miles above, miles above
That's the rhythm of a higher love, higher love
Heart is racing, goes like hi love, hi love
Take my hand and fly me higher, higher

6 AM now
Sky is falling down
Mm..naa...a
Almost sunrise in this messy town
Mm...naa..a

What's on your mind?
You feel it too when we're together?
The way you speak
It takes me right back to forever
You twist and turn me
Keep on changing like the weather
I know you're here
And this is stronger than the pressure

Summer on repeat
Maybe you could take me back
August diaries
Aaaa...
More than memories
Take my story right now
Give it to the seas
