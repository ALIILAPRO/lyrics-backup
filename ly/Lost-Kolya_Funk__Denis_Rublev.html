		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm lo-lo-lo-lost
I swear i will be better than i was
I thought that i was special
We will be together
But i've never been so wrong
I'm lo-lo-lo-lost
I swear i will be better than i was
I thought that i was special
We will be together
But i've never been so wrong
I'm lo-lo-lo-lost
I swear i will be better than i was
I'm lo-lo-lo-lost
But i've never been so wrong
Tell me, was it worth it
My heavy heart is broken
And now you're telling me that yours have opened
And your way baby it's too much
And i feel just like a foolish
I have done with stupid loser
I'm lo-lo-lo-lost
I swear i will be better than i was
I thought that i was special
We will be together
But i've never been so wrong
I'm lo-lo-lo-lost
I swear i will be better than i was
I thought that i was special
We will be together
But i've never been so wrong
I'm lo-lo-lo-lost
I swear i will be better than i was
I'm lo-lo-lo-lost
But i've never been so wrong
I'm lo-lo-lo-lost
I swear i will be better than i was
I thought that i was special
We will be together
But i've never been so wrong
