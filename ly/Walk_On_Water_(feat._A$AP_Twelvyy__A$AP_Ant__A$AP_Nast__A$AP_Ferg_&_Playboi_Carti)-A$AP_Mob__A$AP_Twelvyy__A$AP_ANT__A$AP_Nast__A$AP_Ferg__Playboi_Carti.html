		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just robbed a lil' nigga (ooh)
I just robbed a lil' nigga
And took that nigga bitch
I just robbed a lil' nigga
And took that nigga bitch
I just robbed a lil' nigga
And took that nigga bitch
I just robbed a lil' nigga
And took that nigga bitch
I just robbed a lil' nigga
And took that nigga bitch
I just robbed a lil' nigga
And took that nigga bitch

We can touch the water
Bitch I walk
Walk on top of water
Slime
We can touch the water
Bitch I walk
Walk on top of water
Slime

Fade on me like a pussy
Bitch she popping her coochie
My girl she look like a stripper
Codeine in a Kool-Aid pitcher
Put diamonds on my sister
Put Prada on my mama
Eating Benihana's
Filled up off the lobster
Pasta like a mobster
Reds got me poppin' (yeah)
On a tropic island (yeah)
TMZ watching

I'm a money man
I got her running away
Come up off that pussy
Make some money today
Fetti Provolone
She fell in love with the guap
Leave your man at home
And I'ma make you a star
Take you round the world
You can't pronounce where we are
I just robbed a little nigga
And I'm takin' his broad

I just robbed a lil' nigga
And took that nigga bitch
I just robbed a lil' nigga
And took that nigga bitch
I just robbed a lil' nigga
And took that nigga bitch
I just robbed a lil' nigga
And took that nigga bitch

We can touch the water
Bitch I walk
Walk on top of water
Slime
We can touch the water
Bitch I walk
Walk on top of water
We can touch the water
Bitch I walk
Walk on top of water
Slime
We can touch the water (yah)
Bitch I walk (wah, yah)
Walk on top of water (bitch I, yeah)
Slime (bitch I, ay)

Big bang
Nasty in this hoe man
I might fuck around and
Fuck a little nigga's hoe, man
You know how the game go
You know that shit for sure, man
Fuck yo bitch one night
She blow the next, they just like propane
Spend a lil' shopping money
On a lil' Dolce
Prada and that Gucci
Plus Chanel, she love the clothes game
Told her if she fuck me right
She could get what she wanted
It ain't nothin' to me
I just call up my accountant
Guap

You see me on water
Walking on it like Jesus
Margiela on my collar
Remember they used to tease us
I need Obama daughter
Yeah, I really need her
Hundred racks froze in water
I plug that in the freezer
Jump with the Mac in the back of the Jeep
Sweep them niggas clean (roo!)
Hit em with a magazine
Make your sneakers lean (roo!)
Cadillac diamond the back of that old school
When I'm with my team
Don't wanna fuck with the team
Don't do that, know what I mean (Alright!)
She wanna fuck with a king
Diamonds all bling
Hood Pope doing his thing
She wanna ride with the team
By Any Means
Taking the bitch of your dreams
Now that bitch my little queen
Got her from Queens
Might come in raw, with a G
Gucci and Prada on her feet
Designer her sheets
A dollar sign A P

I just robbed a lil' nigga
And took that nigga bitch
I just robbed a lil' nigga
And took that nigga bitch
I just robbed a lil' nigga
And took that nigga bitch
I just robbed a lil' nigga
And took that nigga bitch

We can touch the water
Bitch I walk
Walk on top of water
Slime
We can touch the water
Bitch I walk
Walk on top of water
We can touch the water
Bitch I walk
Walk on top of water
Slime
We can touch the water
Bitch I walk
Walk on top of water
Slime
