		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Suddenly, it's not what it seems
Thought you were perfect
Perfect for me
You tried but it's hopeless
Boy, you can't fix what's broken
So, don't buy me roses
Don't buy me roses

Lookin' back I was so naive
You let me open
Said you were everything to me
I didn't notice
That you weren't where you said
Who you with late at night, where you lay your head?
Call me crazy instead, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

I cared for you more than you'll ever know
Needed your rain, you wouldn't let me grow, I
I let you go

Suddenly, it's not what it seems
Thought you were perfect
Perfect for me (perfect for me)
You tried but it's hopeless
Boy, you can't fix what's broken
So, don't buy me roses
Don't buy me roses

Too many promises to keep 
Too many broken
I gave you something to believe
It was hopeless
'Cause you weren't who you said
You just made me feel like I was in my head
Called me crazy instead, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

I cared for you more than you'll ever know
Needed your rain, you wouldn't let me grow, I
I let you go

Suddenly, it's not what it seems
Thought you were perfect (thought you were perfect)
Perfect for me (perfect for me)
You tried but it's hopeless
Boy, you can't fix what's broken
So, don't buy me roses
Don't buy me roses

Don't buy me roses
