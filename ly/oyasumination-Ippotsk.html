		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  小鳥の命を / Kotori no inochi wo
Kotori自分の手で / Kotori jibun no te de
Который мы 忘れた / Kotoriy my wasureta
Controlling の人生は / Controlling no jinsei wa
終わらない / Owaranai

The last dinosaur
I wonder what it saw, when there was nothing anymore
And now you try to soar
Upon the wings you've stolen from the efforts not of yours
I wonder when the wax melts and you'll
Fall to the ground,
Anytime
Your satellite won't get this
There's a sad lie underneath it
This macrocosmic joke
Will be observed no more

So keep laughin' while you can
When the time comes
I'll swear that someday
You will taste the sun
Take a hike into the cosmos
With Icarus in tow
And may it make you understand
The weight of the world

I saw the news today
Impressive how a man just throws all life in disarray
While underlings expire
While underlings expire, you're still a figure no-one asked for
Just pretending to inspire me (so look around)
And just like that, the world will end
In time, your guess is as good as mine
So what will you do
Once the fake moon falls?

I'll stay awake
'Til the day comes when
I will suffocate on
My own terms
Even when cars will fly
And machines will all talk
Still it matters not to me
Nor to anyone else

So keep runnin' while you can
When the time comes
I'll swear that someday
You will taste the sun
If your catastrophic dream
Lies far beyond the things we see
I'll make you understand
The weight of the world

No matter the phase of plan you see
(for my dream)
Still blind to reality
(for my dream)
But before you let yourself go
Let me pin just one more note onto the memo(ir)

Too many sudden setbacks pushin' me out of the zone
"Tomorrow"'s such a nice word
Such a shame that I forgot (just what it meant)
To be another case for you to stand on
This macrocosmic joke
Will be observed no more

So rejoice now, while you can
'Cause the time comes for you to
Throw yourself into the sun
Now that your only mission statement
Is paid out in full,
Then I hope you understand
The weight of the world
