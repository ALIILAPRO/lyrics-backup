		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  At the end of your week
Are you answering honestly?
Are you a clock ticking endlessly
Avoiding existence?
Maybe you're drowning in water under the bridge
Or choking on dust you swept under the rug
It's not your fault I made my bed
In good faith with bad blood
It's the cost to be on the in between
It's the cost to be
It's not so safe outside my window
The howling rages on
For all the years, where did the wind go?
I slept while it got strong
I want to fix this
Sensation torn in two
Build a shelter
To shield me and you
From the draft that's
Been pushing through
I want to fix this
Sensation torn in two
Build a shelter
To shield me and you
From the draft that's
Pushing through
It's not so safe outside my window
The howling rages on
For all the years, where did the wind go?
I slept while it got strong
It's not so safe outside my window
The howling rages on
For all the years, where did the wind go?
I've learned to fear the calm
