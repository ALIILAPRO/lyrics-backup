		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you feeling fascist? Are you feeling mean?
We don't need a reason, we don't need a thing
We destroy just who we want to, brutality is ""in""
Oppression is our weapon, chaos is our king

If ignorance is really bliss you should be happy you should be happy
If you amount to only this I'm really sorry I'm really sorry
If ignorance is really bliss you should be happy you should be happy
If you amount to only this I'm really sorry I'm really sorry

We never heard of 'free will', independence is a sin
If you think you're superior then you're as good as in
It's psychosis and delusion, arrogance, denial
And so much more awaits you, yeah, we sell it by the mile

If ignorance is really bliss you should be happy you should be happy
If you amount to only this I'm really sorry I'm really sorry
If ignorance is really bliss you should be happy you should be happy
If you amount to only this I'm really sorry I'm really sorry

And are we justified? I don't think so
But we never let the truth get in the way
And when you're crucified who will you turn to?
You can sell your soul to cover up the pain

So if you're feeling fascist and if you're conscience is clean
We're holier than everyone and immorally supreme
Don't question what we tell you, just devour what we sell
Why should we serve in Heaven when we could rule all in Hell?

There is a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part. You can't even passively take part! And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop! And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it  that unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all! 

If ignorance is really bliss you should be happy you should be happy
If you amount to only this I'm really sorry I'm really sorry 
If ignorance is really bliss you should be happy you should be happy
If you amount to only this I'm really sorry I'm really sorry 
If ignorance is really bliss
If ignorance is really bliss
You should be happy
