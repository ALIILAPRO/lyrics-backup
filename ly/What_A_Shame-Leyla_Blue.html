		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't understand how you got your hands
All up on that new mistake
Wait, which one was she again?
Could be dating all her friends
You know that they all look the same
And talk like, "Take my picture, wait redo"
"Might delete it, I felt kinda cute"
Guess I'll never understand the thinking of a man
The only thing that's left to say

What a shame, baby, what a shame
Coulda been with me instead of what's-her-fucking-name?
What a shame, baby, what a shame
Had a winning hand but you threw away the game
Gave you a million chances, don't get no more
Can't wait forever, I'm getting bored
What a shame, baby, what a shame
What a shame

You pay for all her fun, T-Pain on your tongue
But I can buy my own damn drink
Don't need smoke inside my lungs or liquor in my blood
To tell you what the fuck I think
Guy's like, "What's your problem? What? Why you mad?"
"You should smile, you look better like that"
Guess I'll never understand why guys want something bland
Over someone who's got everything

'Cause what a shame, baby, what a shame
Coulda been with me instead of what's-her-fucking-name?
What a shame, baby, what a shame
Had a winning hand but you threw away the game
Gave you a million chances, don't get no more
Can't wait forever, I'm getting bored
What a shame, baby, what a shame
What a shame

Now it's four in the morning
What am I doing here?
I need to fucking leave
I could say more but
The only thing that's left to say

Is what a shame, baby, what a shame
Coulda been with me instead of what's-her-fucking-name?
What a shame, baby, what a shame
Had a winning hand but you threw away the game
Gave you a million chances, don't get no more
Can't wait forever, I'm getting bored
What a shame, baby, what a shame
What a shame
