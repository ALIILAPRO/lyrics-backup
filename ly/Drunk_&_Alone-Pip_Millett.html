		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Waiting, I'm waiting for
Waiting for, waiting
Waiting, I'm waiting for
Waiting for, waiting waiting

Drunk and alone
It's nice having someone to phone
Better than having someone to kiss
And hold hands with

Didn't mind the distance
(Didn't mind the distance, I don't mind)
Wish your job was different
I can only wait for used to be chill
Feelings got deep real fast, real real
Deeper, heavy fast I feel
It's a little deeper (I feel, I feel)
Heavy fast I won't lose grip
Chest to mouth, sex to mouth i'm feeling it
Deeper than before

Hate sleeping alone
You're further away on the phone
I keep a light on, not the big one
Too bright, tonight I'll comfort me
When you're not here I get no sleep

Didn't mind the distance
(I didn't mind the distance)
I do wish your job was different
I can only wait for you
I'm waiting for you (Ah ah ah ah)
Deeper, heavy fast I feel
It's a little deeper
(I got a little, a little deeper)
Heavy fast I won't lose grip
Chest to mouth, sex to mouth (Heavy fast I)
I'm feeling it (Heavy fast I feel)
Deeper than before (Heavy fast I)

Deeper heavy fast I feel
Deeper heavy fast I feel
Deeper, deeper heavy fast I, I
Heavy fast I feel heavy fast I, I
