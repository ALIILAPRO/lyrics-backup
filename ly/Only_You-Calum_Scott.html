		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Only you, you you
Only you, you you 
I remember in the school yard
The children didn't understand
So they bullied me with silence
Just for being who I am
So I got good at keeping secrets
I used to blend in with the crowd
On the inside I was screaming
With you I did not have to hide

Only you, could see that I was hurting
Only you, ever cared to understand
Always know, that I'd do do the same
I'd do anything for you, my friend
It's true

I used to stare up at the ceiling
Wide awake all through the night
Why the world was busy sleeping
I was so caught up in my mind

Only you, could see that I was hurting
Only you, ever cared to understand
Always know, that I'd do the same
I'd do anything for you, my friend
It's true
So true

When I'm all alone
A million miles away from home
Would you stand with me?
You'll always be
My rock and shoulder to lean on
Every hope I have is gone
I'll turn to you
You know it's true

Only you, could see that I was hurting
Only you, ever cared to understand
Always know, that I'd do the same
I'd do anything for you, my friend
It's true
So true

And I know
'Til the bitter end
I'd be proud to call you, my best friend
It's true
You, you you
Only you, you you
