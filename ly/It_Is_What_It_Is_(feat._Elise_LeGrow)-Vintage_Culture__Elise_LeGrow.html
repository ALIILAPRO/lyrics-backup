		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And now you call me up
No need to call me twice
Just 'cause I window shop
Don't mean I'm looking to buy
He says he's dynamite
But it was just alright
He left happily
It's all the same to me

You wanna take your time
Don't rush to settle down
You wanna see the world
You wanna shop around
'Cause men'll come and go
That you already know
Why listen though?
Because I told you so

It is what it is
(It is what it is)
Just like this
(It is what it is)
It is what it is
(It is what it is)
Just like this
(Just like this)
It is what it is

And now you call me up
No need to call me twice
Just 'cause I window shop
Don't mean I'm looking to buy
He says he's dynamite
But it was just alright
He left happily
It's all the same to me

You wanna take your time
Don't rush to settle down
You wanna see the world
You wanna shop around
'Cause men'll come and go
That you already know
Why listen though?
Because I told you so

It is what it is
(It is what it is)
Just like this
(It is what it is)
It is what it is
(It is what it is)
Just like this
(Just like this)

It is what it is
(It is what it is)
Just like this
(It is what it is)
It is what it is
(It is what it is)
Just like this
(Just like this)

(It is what it is)
(It is what it is)
(It is what it is)
(It is what it is)
(Just like this)
