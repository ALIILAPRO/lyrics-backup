		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say it's true, there's nothing like me and you
I'm not alone, tell me you feel it too
And I would run away
I would run away, yeah, yeah
I would run away
I would run away with you

'Cause I have, I've fallen in love with you
No, I never have, I'm never gonna stop
Falling in love with you

Close the door, lay down upon the floor
And by candlelight, make love to me through the night (through the night)
'Cause I have run away
I have run away, yeah, yeah
I have run away, run away
I have run away with you

'Cause I have, I've fallen in love with you (fallen in love)
No, I never have, I'm never gonna stop
Falling in love with you
With you

And I would run away
I would run away, yeah
I would run away
I would run away with you

'Cause I have, I've fallen in love with you (I've fallen in love)
No, I never have, I'm never gonna stop
Falling in love with you

I've fallen in love with you (fallen in love)
No, I never have, I'm never gonna stop
Falling in love with you
With you, my love
With you, with you
