		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  At first I was afraid
I was petrified
I kept thinking 
I could never live without you by my side

But then I spent so many nights
Just thinking how you'd done me wrong
I grew strong
I learned how to get along

And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you here
Without that look upon your face

I should have changed that fucking lock
I would have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me

Oh now go
Walk out the door
Just turn around
Now, you're not welcome anymore

Weren't you the one
Who tried to break me with desire?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh not I
I will survive
Yeah
As Long as I know how to love

I know I'll be alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
I will survive
I will survive
Yeah, yeah

It took all the strength I had
Just not to fall apart
I'm trying hard to mend the pieces
Of my broken heart
And I've spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high

And you see me
With somebody new
I'm not that stupid little person
Still in love with you
And so you thought you'd just drop by
And you expect me to be free
But now I'm saving all my lovin'
For someone whose lovin' me

Oh now go
Walk out the door
Just turn around
Now, you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one
Who tried to break me with desire?

Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh not I
I will survive
Yeah
As long as I know how to love
I know I'll be alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
I will survive
I will survive

Yeah, yeah
Oh no
