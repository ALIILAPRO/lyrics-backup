		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you think, when you think, when you think you're alone
I'll be, be, be like a ghost behind you
When you're down, when you're down
When you're down and you can't find the things to say
You know I'll give my words to you, you
When the sea, when the seasons change
And the sun shines on your face
Yeah, I'll be there with you, you, you, you, you
You're a part, you're a part for me now
Just as much as I'm a part of you

I find peace in every story you told
I think of you, I'll never be alone
It's true, true, true
You know I do, do, do

Oh, I need you more than words can say
Oh, you save me in ways that I can't explain
Always been there for me, now I'll do the same
Oh, I need you more than words can say

Won't forget, won't forget
Won't forget when he broke my heart
How you helped me through
You turned, you turned, you turned a disaster into a dream
Gave me the power, made my life brand new
When the world try to break us, we found magic
And we grew stronger, though every line, line, line
Every night, every night, every night
I strain and sing the truth
Now, now they know that they gonna be alright, alright

I find peace in every story you told
I think of you, I'll never be alone
It's true, true, true
You know I do, do, do

Oh, I need you more than words can say
Oh, you save me in ways that I can't explain
Always been there for me, now I'll do the same
Oh, I need you more than words can say

Whoa, yeah, whoa
I find peace in every story you told
I think of you, I'll never be alone
Oh, it's true
You know I do, yeah

Oh, I need you more than words can say (more than words can say)
Oh, you save me in ways that I can't explain (ways that I can't explain)
Always been there for me, now I'll do the same
Always did it for me, now I'll do it the same
Oh, I need you more than words can say

Oh, I need you more than words can say
