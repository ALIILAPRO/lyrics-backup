		  Hang on, Sloopy
Sloopy, hang on
Hang on, Sloopy
Sloopy, hang on

Sloopy lives in a very bad part of town (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
And everybody, yeah, tries to put my Sloopy down (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Sloopy, I don't care what your daddy do (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
'Cause you know, Sloopy, girl, I'm in love with you (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
And so I say now

Hang on, Sloopy
Sloopy, hang on
Hang on, Sloopy
Sloopy, hang on 

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Give it to 'em (yeah)

Sloopy, let your hair down, girl
Let it hang down on me (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Sloopy, let your hair down, girl
Let it hang down on me, yeah, yeah (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Come on, Sloopy (come on, come on)
Well, come on, Sloopy (come on, come on)
Well, come on, Sloopy (come on, come on)
Well, come on, Sloopy (come on, come on)
Well, it feels so good (come on, come on)
You know, it feels so good (come on, come on)
Oh, shake it, shake it, shake it, Sloopy (come on, come on)
Oh, shake it, shake it, shake it, yeah (come on, come on)
