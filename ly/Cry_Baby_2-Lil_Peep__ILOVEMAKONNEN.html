		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you tell me bye-bye, baby, I'll turn into a cry-baby
If you ever leave, I don't know what to do
I hope you know it's true, I'm so in love with you
If you tell me bye-bye, baby, I'll turn into a cry-baby
If you ever leave, I don't know what to do
I hope you know it's true, I'm so in love with you

If you tell me bye-bye, baby, I'll turn into a cry-baby
If you ever leave, I don't know what to do
I hope you know it's true, I'm so in love with you
If you tell me bye-bye, baby, I'll turn into a cry-baby
If you ever leave, I don't know what to do
I hope you know it's true, I'm so in love with you
If you tell me bye-bye, baby, I'll turn into a cry-baby
If you ever leave, I don't know what to do
I hope you know it's true, I'm so in love with you

Feelin' like I wanna die lately, I've been getting high lately
If you tell me bye-bye, baby, I'll turn to a cry-baby
If you ever leave, I won't know what to do
Baby, yeah, it's true, I'm so in love with you
Baby, if you leave, I won't know what to do
Baby, yeah, it's true, I'm so in love with you
If you tell me bye-bye, baby, I'll turn to a cry-baby
If you ever leave, I won't know what to do
Baby, yeah, it's true, I'm so in love with you
If you tell me bye-bye, baby, I'll turn to a cry-baby
If you ever leave, I won't know what to do
I'm so in love with you

If you tell me bye-bye, baby, I'll turn into a cry-baby
If you ever leave, I don't know what to do
I hope you know it's true, I'm so in love with you
If you tell me bye-bye, baby, I'll turn into a cry-baby
If you ever leave, I hope you know it's true
I'm so in love with you, I'm so in love with you
If you tell me bye-bye, baby, I'll turn into a cry-baby
If you ever leave, I don't know what to do
I hope you know it's true, I hope you know it's true
If you tell me bye-bye, baby, I'll turn into a cry-baby
If you ever leave, I don't know what to do
I hope you know it's true, I'm so in love with you
Yeah
