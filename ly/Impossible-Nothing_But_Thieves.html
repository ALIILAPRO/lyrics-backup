		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Took a breath, let it go
Felt the moment settle so
I couln't wait to tell you why
I'm standin' here with this awkward smile
And that's because

I could drown myself in someone like you
I could dive so deep I never come out
I thought it was impossible
But you make it possible

Love, it stings and then it laughs
At every beat of my battered heart
A sudden jolt, a tender kiss
I know I'm gonna die of this
And that's because

I could drown myself in someone like you
I could dive so deep I never come out
I thought it was impossible
But you make it possible

I'll take the smooth with the rough
Feels so fucked up to be in love
Another day, another night
Stuck in my own head but you pull me out
You pull me out

I could drown myself in someone like you
I could dive so deep I never come out
I thought it was impossible
But you make it possible

Somebody told me and I think they're right
There is a change on its way tonight
And I feel it's so
But I fear it though

Somebody told me and I think they're right
There is a change on its way tonight
And I feel it's so
And I feel it so

I could drown myself in someone like you
I could dive so deep I never come out
I thought it was impossible
But you make it possible
