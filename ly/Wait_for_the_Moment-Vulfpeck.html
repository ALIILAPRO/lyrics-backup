		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mom said, "Wait for the moment!"
Gone home, went to bed
While the other kids, they're still outside

I don't feel time when I sleep
So I snuggle up with my sheet
And wait for a brighter day

I'll play football tomorrow
With only my best friends
People I like, but I don't love, are not allowed

I wonder if Sharon will see me
But I'll play cool
'Cause cool is what you have to do

It's hard to make a point
When you're living so loud
Turn it down

Trying to get my friend excited
About not being invited
I say: "That's an opportunity!"

Butt dialed I smile
Listen dialed I smile
It was so nice to get a call

Sharon, I'm good at stuff
And you're into stuff (woo)
Let's make products

Oh, oh, I'm a product guy
And you're a produce girl
I said money money money money money money will be spent

I'm attuned to the grooves
That turn you off
Bass man, ooh, break it down!

Ooh, butt dialed I smile
Listen dialed I smile
It was so nice to get a call

Oh, Sharon, ooh, oh, I'm good at stuff
And you're into stuff (woo)
Let's make products

Oh, yeah, I'm a product kind of guy
And you're a produce kind of girl
I said money money money money money money money money
Will be spent

Oh, I'm attuned to the grooves
That turn you off, oh
Oh oh, ooh
