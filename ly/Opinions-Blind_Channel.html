		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your friend who is not my friend
Should keep their nose out of my business
I don't wanna hear opinions, opinions, opinions
I don't wanna hear opinions, opinions, opinions, (yeah)

2020 lockdown, wrapped it
All these other motherfuckers capped it
Things are looking pretty fly in the backseat
(My life is a) rollercoaster, I'm not strapped in
Fear of death is so relaxin'
Walk the wire? I'll fuckin' dance it
(What's the first thing that could happen?)

Interviews? Million views?
Drinking all this booze just to let it loose?
Nothing as scary as when your dreams come true, oh

Your friend who is not my friend
Should keep their nose out of my business
I don't wanna hear opinions, opinions, opinions
I don't wanna hear opinions, opinions, opinions

Do you recall when I lost myself and asked your help?
Yeah, me neither
I don't wanna hear opinions, opinions, opinions
I don't wanna hear opinions, opinions, opinions

Labels complaining 'bout our language
All they tryna do is get advantage
Shut your mouth, go make me a sandwich
(And all of these) people who didn't believe in me
Are telling other people about meeting me
You wanna piece of me? Or a selfie?
I don't care, I got a place to be

Morning news, fan tattoos
Paparazzis in the avenues
Nothing as scary as when your dreams come true
Ain't nobody gonna tell me what to do, so

Your friend who is not my friend
Should keep their nose out of my business
I don't wanna hear opinions, opinions, opinions
I don't wanna hear opinions, opinions, opinions

Do you recall when I lost myself and asked your help?
Yeah, me neither
I don't wanna hear opinions, opinions, opinions
I don't wanna hear opinions, opinions, opinions

Now they're all so proud, and everybody knows me
All this clout is only giving me nosebleeds
Dreams might drown you, I'm already neck deep

Because your friend who is not my friend
Should keep their nose out of my business
I don't wanna hear opinions, opinions, opinions
I don't wanna hear opinions, opinions, opinions

Do you recall when I lost myself and asked your help?
Yeah, me neither
I don't wanna hear opinions, opinions, opinions
I don't wanna hear opinions, opinions, opinions
Opinions, opinions, opinion
