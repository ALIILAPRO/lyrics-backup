		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love and hate
Tattooed on the knuckles 'round the handles of a blade
On the knuckles 'round the handles of a blade
A bloody blade

Now here it comes
All the flashing lights and sirens, you know it won't be long
Time for the radio to play your last song
Your last song

I'm just calling to tell you, baby
That they're be takin' me away for a while
Well, don't blame me, it's the world that made me
And they're takin' me away for a
Takin' me away for a

Yes, ah well, here they come
Flashing lights and sirens scream, you know they won't be long
Just time to phone the missus and tell her what you've done
And how you've done wrong

I was calling to tell you, baby
They're takin' me away for a while
Ah, you can't blame me, it's this world that's made me
Now they're takin' me away for a
Takin' me away for a

Oh, you've got to know
As you wash the blood from your clothes
You can clean out your clothes
You'll never clean your soul, no, no

A-C-A-B
Tattooed on your knuckles, does the world know what it means?
Ah, now they're slippin' on the bracelets, are you so young and hard and mean
So cold and mean
(And the radio says)

I'm just calling to tell you, baby
That they're be takin' me away for a while
No, don't blame me, it's the world that's made me
Now they're takin' me away for a
Takin' me away for a

Love and hate
On your knuckles
On your white knuckles
Love and hate
On your knuckles on the handles of a blade
The handles of a
