		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, before I give up I’ll die hard,
Before I lay down I’ll go against the odds,
I was birthed to be a king put a hand to God,
A soldier in the field in my camouflage.
No retreat, no surrender, fight with no doubt,
Never sell out my soul or my folks out.
I’d rather die slow, victory survival,
It’s every piece of me I see it with my eyes closed.

There ain’t a piece of me,
Not made for victory,
Keep marching like a soldier,
This world up on my shoulders.
There ain’t a piece of me,
Not made for victory,
Keep fighting on my knees,
Till I see victory.

Yeah you can’t stop it if it’s destiny,
Nah, I’ll leave my mark you’ll remember me,
It’s more to me than what the eyes can see,
I’ve got the spirit of war stories and victory.
I’ve got the blood of a martyr with every sacrifice,
I’ve got the will of a soldier before the afterlife,
I’ve got the honor and love so I paid the price,
Victory is mine you’ll see it in my eyes.

There ain’t a piece of me,
Not made for victory,
Keep marching like a soldier,
This world up on my shoulders.
There ain’t a piece of me,
Not made for victory,
Keep fighting on my knees,
Till I see victory.

You could never kill a kill,
You could never stop my dream,
You could never make me run,
I go to war until the battle’s won.
You could never kill a kill,
You could never stop my dream,
You could never make me run,
I go to war until the battle’s won.

There ain’t a piece of me,
Not made for victory,
Keep marching like a soldier,
With this world up on my shoulders.
There ain’t a piece of me,
Not made for victory,
Keep fighting on my knees,
Till I see victory.

Until I see it,
That’s what I’m looking for,
That’s what I’m fighting for,
I won’t stop no.
Victory,
Victory,
Till I see victory.
