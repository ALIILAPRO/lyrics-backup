		  (Yo, yo, this beat actually really hard)
Girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls all over the world
The world
Look, look

She's a real deal diva, more than an Instagram model
Bad bitches love reposado, drinkin' out the bottle
I don't usually try and shoot no shots, but I couldn't pass on her
Told 'em stop the car and let me out, I seen the ass on her
Playin' mean, but she really sweet, my heart skipped a beat
And in the club where I hardly could be, so I bring the party to me
Top floor, presidential suite and we fifty deep
Hold on, T, could you stop the beat? Let's get somethin' to eat
If she tryna set a trap, then it's gonna work
I love you and all your baddie friends, boo, let's go to Turks
I don't want your Insta' or your Snapchat
Add me on your finsta where you be bad at
She don't want no more love and I don't mind
She's here for a good time, not a long time
I told her after we get done, we can island hop
Her friend told me, "Nigga, shut up, it's shot o' clock"

Girls, girls (whoa), girls, girls, girls all over the world
She's a vibe and her friend's a vibe and we 'bout to have some fun
Bad bitches 'round the world, better grab you one, oh
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls all over the world
The world (D on the track, D on the track)
The world

Michigan, Atlanta, Florida, Alabama (21)
Bougies and the ratchets, I don't really have a standard (yeah)
I'm a young player, I rub feet and I light candles (yeah)
She love lemon drops and like to open-toe her sandals (21)
Okay (21, 21), come here, baby, let me coach you (yeah)
If you learn to do it with no hands, I might promote you (on God)
You know I got superpowers, I would never ghost you
We just made a movie, now we watchin' it on Roku

Girls, girls (whoa), girls, girls, girls all over the world
She's a vibe and her friend's a vibe and we 'bout to have some fun
Bad bitches 'round the world, better grab you one, oh
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls all over the world
The world (D on the track, D on the track)
The world

She's a vibe and her friend's a vibe, know we 'bout to have some fun
Bad bitches 'round the world, better grab you one
Bad bitches 'round the world, better grab you one
Better grab you one, oh
What up, Houston? What up, Dallas?
What up, Chicago? What up, Cali?
In Atlanta, I'm in New York (D on the track, D on the track)
I'm in-

Girls, girls (whoa), girls, girls, girls all over the world
She's a vibe and her friend's a vibe and we 'bout to have some fun 
(Yo, yo, this beat actually really hard)
Bad bitches 'round the world, better grab you one, oh
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls all over the world
The world
The world
