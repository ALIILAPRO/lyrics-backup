		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby picked me up at the airport
I could see them waiting outside
Sitting on the tarmac in New York
Baby's come to give me ride

Nothing gets me higher than aeroplanes
Except the way you're looking at me
Nothing keeps me up like an all night flight
Nothing makes me feel so free

We could see the Palace of Babylon
If we had a time machine
We could make tonight last a whole life long
Meet somewhere in between

If we had our very own submarine
We could sail beneath the deep blue sea
We could stay far away, under the waves
Darlin if you know what I mean
