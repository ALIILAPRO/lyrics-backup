		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I be dying fuck your living
We got different states of mind
I be manic I be tripping
While you lying bout your life
I seen broken fucking bodies, so I sip until they gone
Know that better men than you have fucking died for lesser cause
I'm in disarray from the misery
But I'm hanging on for you ain't missing me
I got better days, man I'm in a haze
But I popped a lot of amphetamines
So I work a lot to forget the pain
I'm a workaholic and it ain't phase
Mix the alcoholic and some fucking chains
And you got a sloth, now we are the same
Fuck
I'm sick I need a doc
I hate these fucking voices in my mind they need to stop
Why
Do I gotta fight
Just to fucking live another day this shit ain't right
I don't know what is right
Lost my fucking way, I can't tell if this is real
Die, lost my will to fight
Until I think of all the times I wish I could just see you
Life is what you make it
That's why I've had better days
I load my fucking brain up
In attempts to get away
7 deadly sinners
I'm the slothboi and you ain't
Don't you play
Bitch you ain't about the fuck I am, you lame
Life is hard they never told us how to make it out alive
We just keep on grinding everyday and hopes it will suffice
But I'm cold and getting colder
Getting fucked up hell is closer
Couldnt even see my vision
Now I'm working every second of the day
Im insane
Really work hard till I can't
Sippin mud i been fan
But now I try to reach my paix
I'm addicted to the flipin' makin digits
ain't gon change
Feeling vivid keep on thinking
Will they Love beyond the grave
I'm in disarray from the misery
But I'm hanging on for you ain't missing me
I got better days, man I'm in a haze
But I popped a lot of amphetamines
So I work a lot to forget the pain
I'm a workaholic and it ain't phase
Mix the alcoholic and some fucking chains
And you got a sloth, now we are the same
Fuck
I'm sick I need a doc
I hate these fucking voices in my mind they need to stop
Why
Do I gotta fight
Just to fucking live another day this shit ain't right
