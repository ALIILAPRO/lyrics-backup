		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  News runnin' wild on the TV screen
Repeatin' shit that I've already seen
People pointin' fingers takin no kind of blame
But when it rains it pours ain't ya doin the same
Ol' shit, it reciprocates
Tell me that ain't the truth in this case
You need some Levon Helm to send ya back in to grammar school
The cavalry is headed your way

But me, I'm a try to get right with the man
Forgive me for me sins and what I don't understand
I'm just a good ol' boy, tryin to make ends meet
Is it me, or has
The whole damn world gone crazy

Find myself runnin' down yonder to the corner store
Just a minding my business tryin' to get me some smoke
My guy talkin' politicky telling me to take a stand
Agree to disagree wasn't in the cards at hand
Said are ya left or right or fickle 'cause
There ain't no play the middle
Now boy which route is this gonna be

But me, I'm a try to get right with the man
Forgive me for me sins and what I don't understand
I'm just a good ol' boy, tryin to make ends meet
Is it me, or has
The whole damn world gone crazy

Me, I'm a try to get right with the man
Forgive me for me sins and what I don't understand
I'm just a good ol' boy, tryin to make ends meet
Is it me, or has
The whole damn world gone 

Me, I'm a try to get right with the man
Forgive me for me sins and what I don't understand
I'm just a good ol' boy, tryin to make ends meet
Is it me, or has
The whole damn world gone crazy
