		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got this smile on my face
Inside I'm bleeding
While they're all cutting a shape, I'm shedding pieces
Their bags are checked at the gate
And they're all doing okay
But they don't see me

Oh where do the lonely people go?
I wanna know
Just skin and bones
Where we can leave behind our ghosts
I wanna go

Somewhere that I fit in
Take me to that place where I can get up out of my head
Where broken hearted people come together and they dance
Make no plans, cause they can't hope for a good tomorrow
Only sorrow
Somewhere that I fit in

I try to move out of my bed
But I wanna feel that beat again
Cause people love to talk, but they don't wanna connect
They smile through their teeth
But they don't hear me

Oh where do the lonely people go?
I wanna know
Just skin and bones
Where we can leave behind our ghosts
I wanna go

Somewhere that I fit in
Take me to that place where I can get up out of my head
Where broken hearted people come together and they dance
Make no plans, cause they can't hope for a good tomorrow
Only sorrow
Somewhere that I fit in

How low, low, low can we go?
Take me down, down, down
The rabbit hole
How low, low, low can we go?
Take me down, down, down
I wanna go

Somewhere that I fit in
Take me to that place where I can get up out of my head
Where broken hearted people come together and they dance
Make no plans, cause they can't hope for a good tomorrow
Only sorrow
Somewhere that I fit in
