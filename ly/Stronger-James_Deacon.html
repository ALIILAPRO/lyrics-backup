		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We've been searching for a clearing in the trees
Always moving, keep our backs against the breeze
Over horizons, there is so much to explore
We'll keep rising, there's adventure out the door

Got me singing like
Woah
Yeah
Uh oh
Yeah

Oh
Yeah
Uh oh
Yeah

Stronger than before
Keep coming back for more
Stronger than before
Keep coming back for more

Get up, yeah, the season's changing
Something magnetic, but it's more than a feeling
Rolling on down to the beat
Your body pressed down in the seat

Lean your head back
Raise your hands to the ceiling
With a little help I'll give your movements some meaning
Keep you moving to the sound of the street
I know that you can, you can take the heat, take the heat, take the

Woah
Yeah
Uh oh
Yeah

Oh
Yeah
Uh oh
Yeah

Woah
Yeah
Uh oh
Yeah

Oh
Yeah
Uh oh

Stronger than before
Keep coming back for more
Stronger than before
Keep coming back for more

Got me singing like
Stronger than before
Keep coming back for more

Got me singing like
Stronger than before
Keep coming back for more
