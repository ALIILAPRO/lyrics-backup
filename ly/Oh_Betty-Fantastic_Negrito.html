		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So I said, I said, "Oh Betty"
I'm grieving
And the years keep passing me by
But I keep believing
'Cause you're the only thing that matters
Oh Betty
The days keeps passin' me by
But I keep on dreaming
One day we'll be together
Oh, my sweet, sweet Betty
I can hear your body talking to me sweetly
You're the only dream I dream of

I can hear them
Sweet songs you're singin'
I can hear them
Sweet songs you're singin'
I can hear them songs

Oh

Oh Betty
It's late in the evening
Staring through your window pane
It ain't relieving
But it's the only thing I do
Oh, my sweet, sweet Betty
I can feel you laugh and cry
Your tears, they clean me
You're the only thing that feeds me
Oh Betty
You'll be free in seven years
While I'm still bleeding
I wonder if you'll ever need me?

I can hear them
Sweet songs you're singin'
I can hear them
Sweet songs you're singin'
I can hear them songs

Oh
Get up

Oh betty, come on

I can hear them
Sweet songs you're singin'
I can hear them
Sweet songs you're singin'
I can hear them songs

Oh Betty
Please believe me
Oh, them years keep passing me by
And I'm still breathing 
You'll be only thing that matters
