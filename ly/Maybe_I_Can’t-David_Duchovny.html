		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you come back to me again
I'll make the blue sky rain
I'll make it snow in mid-July
Well maybe I can't, but I'll try

If you come back to me again
Make the midnight shine
I'll slap the cuffs on the hands of time
Well maybe I can't, but I'll try
Maybe I can't

Your choice, you choose
I win, we lose
What price, what cost?
You won, we lost

If you come back to me again
Make it to the bitter end
I'll talk to God so we never die
Well maybe I can't, but I'll try

Moving on, moving on, moving on
Everybody's gotta get a move on
Say goodbye, wave goodbye, I'll say goodbye
Well maybe I can't, but I'll try

Your choice, you choose
I win, we lose
What price, what cost
You won, we lost

We lost, we lost, we lost, we lost, we lost, we lost, we lost
Say goodbye, wave goodbye, I'll say goodbye
Well maybe I can't
