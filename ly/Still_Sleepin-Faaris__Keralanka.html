		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Does anybody know who you are?
You're no artist! Sucka, you suck!
I wanna know who still got doubts
Cause the bars come hard but I still got bounce
I've been counting up the money but I still lost count
Tryna keep me in my lane but I still got routes
I got fans up North but I'm still down South
It's been how many how many years? And I still got clout
Look, I'm the one they're having conversations about
And they're throwing curveballs but I straighten 'em out
This is verbal exercise, test my fitness
Got a hunger for the game, I'ma rep my district
Started writing raps had to check my image
But I work at a bank so they always had interest
How am I working for the man and tryna build a brand?
Life gavе me lemons and I openеd up a stand
I squeeze out bars then I serve you a minute-maid
I should be featured on lyrical lemonade
Every songs a different style, yeah I like to innovate
I don't really miss though like I got the weapon aimed
I mean I made "Hell Out There" for heavens sake
I break through the door, buy the house, then I renovate
Either way I need a second resume
It's too much for one, I think it's time to use a second page
All thanks to the rhymes I demonstrate
All thanks to the time I dedicate
Still sleepin, how they still sleepin?
Times runnin out, the alarm's been beepin
Still sleepin, how they still sleepin?
Everybody's waiting on you
Still sleepin, how they still sleepin?
Times runnin out, the alarm's been beepin
Still sleepin, how they still sleepin?
Everybody's waiting on you
Hush hush, motherfucker don't wake up!
Hush hush, all you bitches so basic
Faaris got 'em up with the heat, now I got 'em wiling
Heezy pushin' the rap product, we bout it bout it
La Di Da, I'm slick & fresh with the classics
But bitches interject for the bag
Labels want a piece of me, I cut em in with the shit
They claimin' they got the sauce, but double dipping the drip
Fuck ya minimum bag, my upper limit been lit
I'm breaking through all ya ceilings, still stuck with imminent risk
Student of the game, my environment ruthless but
They refuse to show love if accounts isn't lucrative
So motherfuck these plants, let's get down to the root of it
Ya'll been spitting dumb punches but my counter intuitive
The lighter the fluid, the darker the days
Start to decay my innocence, alarmed with the praise
Taylor made for the art and exchange
But still Swift to do you dirty, this shit Braun over brains
My foot down, I keep pushin' like Scooters
I'm beat butchering bitches, ya'll be shook of them losers
In the heat cookin' up, rappers still in abyss
Please stop acting like these kids that eat boogers and mucus
That's a tip for the snot-nosed
Pick up cilantro, bitch that's the don flow
Stick up cuz I don't play stations in the whip, rather body the DJ
And now these labels tryna hit me and get rich off a con's soul
Still sleepin, how they still sleepin?
Times runnin out, the alarm's been beepin
Still sleepin, how they still sleepin?
Everybody's waiting on you
Still sleepin, how they still sleepin?
Times runnin out, the alarm's been beepin
Still sleepin, how they still sleepin?
Everybody's waiting on you
Hush hush, motherfucker don't wake up!
Hush hush, all you bitches so basic
