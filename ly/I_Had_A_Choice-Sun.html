		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Holding hands, strolling through the park
Sweet memories are torn apart
I made a promise I could not keep
I played around, oh, girl, I made you weep

I had a choice
And I chose wrong
I made a promise, girl
To leave it alone

You gave me trust
I threw it away
Baby, please
Baby, please

You were honest right from the start
The love you gave, baby, came from the heart
I should have known our love was right
I was blind, oh, couldn't see the light

I love your charms, I miss your smile
Please baby, come on, lay with me awhile
I crave the love that we once shared
Open up your heart, oh, girl, don't despair

I had a choice
And I chose wrong
I made a promise, girl
To leave it alone

You gave me trust
I threw it away
Baby, please
Baby, please

Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...
Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...

I had a choice
And I chose wrong
I made a promise, girl
To leave it alone

You gave me trust
I threw it away
Baby, please
Baby, please, listen to me

Holding hands, strolling through the park
Sweet memories are torn apart
I made a promise I could not keep
I played around, oh, girl, I made you weep

Baby, please
Baby, please
Baby, you got me down on my knees
Baby, please
Baby, please
Whoa...oh...yeah...

I'll be so honest, I'll be so true
I'll be so doggone good to you
Baby, please
Baby, please
Baby, please
