		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the day
I just can't wait till Christmas time
When I can grope you in the hay

Easy come, easy go
Have a good time with lots of dough
Slippin' up high, slippin' down low
Love'm and leave'm on with the show

Listen, I like female form in minimum dress
Money to spend with a capital S
Get a date with the woman in red
Want to be in heaven with three in a bed
(One of me in heaven)

He got it, I want it
They got it, I can't have it
But I want it, but it don't matter
She got it, and I can't get it
I want a mistress for Christmas
I want a mistress for Christmas

Ooh yeah, haha yeah
I want a mistress for Christmas
Come on

Easy come, easy go
Slippin' high, slippin' low (yeah, aw right)

He got it, I want it
They got it, I can't have it
I want it, don't matter
She got it, and I can't get it

(Mistress)
He got it, I want it
(For Christmas)
They got it, and I can't have it
(Mistress)
But I want it, it don't matter
(For Christmas)
She got it, and I can't get a

Mistress for Christmas

You know what I'm talkin' about
Mistress for Christmas
You gotta send me down
You gotta send me down
Mistress for Christmas
I want the woman in red with bow in my bed
(Mistress for Christmas)
I can hear you coming down my smoke stack
I want to ride on your reindeer honey and ring the bells
