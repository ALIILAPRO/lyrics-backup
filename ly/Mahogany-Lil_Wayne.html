Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash, boy
Gas to the floor, I'm pressin' fast forward
I'm racin' NASCAR, transport, just what you asked for
Don't ask me what I asked for if you can't answer
Now who them Xans for?
I'll pop Dans for muscle relaxation
I'm a patient, pick up the pace when I feel too adjacent to who I'm racin'
Yeah, I'm spacin', I'm spacin' out, oh you faded?
I'm faded out, oh you made it? I made it out
But you shady like 8 Mile
8 Ball from Orange, my letdown, I lay it down
Like an eagle, she spread it out
Air it out, yeah I ate it out
I'm a Libra, I weigh it out
Hope the reaper don't take me out
I'm too eager to wait it out, stuck the heater in Satan's mouth
Pray polices don't raid the house, pay my taxes and baby moms
Ain't no cappin', don't play around, hate me back and then hate me now
In my lap is your face, I got napkins to waste
I got mansions with gates, feel like I'm NASA with space
Don't feel like answerin' my phone, I feel like thrashin' today
I put my ratchet on safe, and I feel actually safe
Catchin' spasms and aches, from all the hands I done shaked
And all the cash I done counted and all the blunts I done rolled up
I stunt when I rolled up, with a bad bitch sittin' in the front with her nose up
You know what's in my soda
And your trap house closin', your glass house broken
And my mad house open and my lighthouse glowin'

Mahogany dashboard, do the dash, boy
Mahogany dashboard, do the dash, boy
Mahogany handle on the gun in my hand, boy
Brains all over my mahogany dashboard

Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash, boy
I think in my backyard, I need an airport
Mahogany sand, boy, I start a sand storm
Mahogany skin touch me I cut your hands off
Mahogany door handle, to match the floor panel
Mahogany sand, mahogany Dior sandals
Mahogany dash, slime, I do the dash, slime
Sit the coke on the glass, slime, she snort a flat line
Good times, no hard times, uh oh, it's that time
We at war, I check my Chopard for the exact time
Bang, bang, brrat time, I'm reppin' Bad Vibes
Flag high, red, red, red, bloody vampire
Plug was a fuckin' Arabi, no cap, slime
Judge gave me time, I did that time like nap time
Mahogany skateboard, I parked the Wraith for it
I kick, push straight forward, I hear Lupe flowin'
Under the skully, these bright mahogany dreads showin'
Let's get in bed and break these mahogany head boards
Oh, whoa, mahogany, yeah, whoa

Mahogany dashboard, do the dash, boy
Mahogany dashboard, do the dash, boy
Mahogany dashboard, do the dash, boy
Uh, yeah, I do the dash, boy
Mahogany handle on the gun in my hand, boy
Brains all over my mahogany dashboard

Louis mahogany bags for the bag boys
Louis, Louis mahogany bags for the bag boys
Soon as we land, on mahogany sand
Maho-mahogany sand
Louis mahogany bags for the bag boys
Soon as we land, on mahogany sand
I ain't arguin', I'm sayin'
Ooh, mahogany
