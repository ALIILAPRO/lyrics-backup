		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  House full of roses
A letter on the stairs
A tape full of messages
For anyone who cares
Collage of broken words
and stories full of tears
Remembering your life
'Cause we wish that you were here

Nothing is harder
Than to wake up all alone
Realize it's not okay
It's the end of all you know
Time keeps passing by
But it seems I'm frozen still
Scars are left behind
But some too deep to feel

And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel tonight
We're all just victims of a crime
When all's gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside
We're all just victims of a crime

Some days you'll find me
In a place I like to go
Ask questions to myself
'Bout the things I'll never know
What's left to find
'Cause I need a little more
I need a little time
Can we even up the score?

And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel tonight
We're all just victims of a crime
When all's gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside
We're all just victims of a crime

And nothing lasts forever
For all good days it's true
I'd rather tred it all
For somehow saving you
It must have been the season
That've threw us out of line
Once I stood so tall
Now I'm searching for a sign

So don't need your salvation
With promises and kind
And all those speculations
Save it for another time
'Cause we all need a reason
A reason just to stay
Some just can't be bothered
To stick around another day

And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel tonight
We've all been victims of a crime
When all is gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside (oh)
We've all been victims of a crime
Victims of a crime
Living with this crime

I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
