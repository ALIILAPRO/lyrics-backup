		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hark how the bells
Sweet silver bells
All seem to say
Throw cares away

Christmas is here
Bringing good cheer
To young and old
Meek and the bold

Ding dong ding dong
That is the song
With joyful ring
All caroling (oh, oh, ah)

One seems to hear
Words of good cheer
From everywhere (from everywhere)
Filling the air

Oh, how they pound (oh, how they pound)
Raising the sound
O'er hill and dale
Telling their tale (telling their tale)

Gaily they ring
While people sing
Songs of good cheer (oh, oh, oh)
Christmas is here

Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas (Merry Christmas)
Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas (Merry Christmas)

On on they send
On without end
Their joyful tone
To every home (ah, ah, ah)

Ding dong ding dong
Ding dong ding dong

Hark how the bells (hark how the bells)
Sweet silver bells
All seem to say
Throw cares away (seem to say)
(We will throw cares away)

Christmas is here
Bringing good cheer
To young and old
Meek and the bold
(Bringing cheer to the young and old)

Oh, how they pound (oh, how they pound)
Raising the sound
O'er hill and dale
Telling their tale (telling their tale)

Gaily they ring
While people sing
Songs of good cheer (oh, oh, oh)
Christmas is here

Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas (Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas)
Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas (Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas)

On on they send (ah, ah, ah, ah)
On without end
Their joyful tone
To every home
