		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hate you so much
Fuck you are the worst damn nightmare
You're sick and close to die
But shit I don't care
You make me sick, your love is a lie
I wanna hate so I keep you alive

I love the smell of your blood
Dance dance baby go dance for me
The beat is beating you up
You are a part of my destiny
But I can't let go

Gimme all your love
All your tears
All the hate you feel
Gimme all your love
Your pain, your thrill
Gimme all your memories, melodies, remedies now

'Cause I wanna burn them
Down, down
Down, down
I burn them
Down Down
'Cause I wanna burn it down

Back in the day you wanted me
I got your heart so easily
The sex we had so endlessly
I make your mind a part of me
Still makes me sick that your love is a lie
I wanna hate so I keep you alive

I love the smell of your blood
Dance dance baby go dance for me
The beat is beating you up
You are a part of my destiny
But I can't let go

Gimme all your love
All your tears
All the hate you feel
Gimme all your love
Your pain, your thrill
Gimme all your memories, melodies, remedies now

'Cause I wanna burn them
Down, down
Down, down
I burn them
Down Down
'Cause I wanna burn it down

I make your heart stop
Reanimate you 'cause I
Will make your heart stop
Your fucking heart stop
I make your heart stop
Reanimate you 'cause I hate you
I make your heart stop
Your fucking heart stop
I make your heart stop
Your fucking heart stop

Gimme all your love
All your tears
All the hate you feel
Gimme all your love
Your pain, your thrill
Gimme all your memories, melodies, remedies now

'Cause I wanna burn them
Down, down
Down, down
I burn them
Down, down
'Cause I wanna burn it down
