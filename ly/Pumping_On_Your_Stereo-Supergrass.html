		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?

Life is a cigarette, you smoke to the end,
But if you rocket the middle bit,
Then you burn all your friends,
The wider your eyes, the bigger the lies, yes it's true,

Can you hear us pumping on your stereo?
Can you hear us pumping on your stereo?

Take a look through your window now,
You're all alone on the road,
Well you'll burn all your bridges down,
And now you're losing control,
The wider your eyes, the bigger the lies, yes it's true,
If you make a mistake where you couldn't
Relate to your groove, (yes, that's true)

Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?

Well now that I've met you,
And I love you as a friend,
Yeah but your love is mogadon,
Love is the end,
Well, the wider your eyes, the bigger the lies, yes it's true,
If you make a mistake well you couldn't relate to your groove, yes it's true,

Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
