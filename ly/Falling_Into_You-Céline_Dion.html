		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And in your eyes I see ribbons of color
I see us inside of each other
I feel my unconscious merge with yours
And I hear a voice say, "What's his is hers"

I'm falling into you (falling into you)
This dream could come true
And it feels so good falling into you (falling into you)

I was afraid to let you in here (I was afraid)
Now I have learned love can't be made in fear
The walls begin to tumble down
And I can't even see the ground

I'm falling into you (falling into you)
This dream could come true
And it feels so good falling into you (falling into you)

Falling like a leaf, falling like a star
Finding a belief, falling where you are

Catch me, don't let me drop
Love me, don't ever stop

So close your eyes and let me kiss you
And while you sleep I will miss you

I'm falling into you (falling into you)
This dream could come true
And it feels so good falling into you (falling into you)

Falling like a leaf, falling like a star
Finding a belief, falling where you are

Falling into you
Falling into you
Falling into you, yeah
