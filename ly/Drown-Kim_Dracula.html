		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And you smiled for the last time in my life
I hope you fucking drown (drown, drown, drown, drown, drown) 
(Toxic)
I hope you fucking drown

Ooh, I'm not fucking around (I'm not fucking around)
Baby, we've been helpless lately
I can't get rid of you now (I can't get rid of you now)
I hope you fucking drown (I hope you fucking drown)
(I can't get rid of you now)

Everybody, everybody, I want everybody
Everybody, everybody, I want everybody
(Don't want money, or fame, or power)
(I want a lifestyle)
Everybody, everybody, I want everybody
Everybody, everybody, I want everybody
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
(I want everybody to be like me)

And I'll erase you
But I'd die to save you (to save you)
And I'll erase you

(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick)

I hope you fucking drown (I hope you fucking drown)
Baby, we've been helpless lately
I can't get rid of you now (I can't get rid of you now)
Ooh, I'm not fucking around (I'm not fucking around)
I hope you fucking drown 

I can't get rid of you now
Ooh, I'm not fucking around (I'm not fucking around)
Baby, we've been helpless lately
I hope you fucking
I hope you fucking
I hope you fucking drown
