		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I get up, I get down and I'm jumpin' around
And the rumpus and ruckus are comfortable now
Been a hell of a ride but I'm thinkin' it's time to grow
(Bang! Bang! Bang!)
So I got an apartment across from the park
Put quinoa in my fridge, still I'm not feelin' grown
Been a hell of a ride but I'm thinkin' it's time to go
(Bang! Bang! Bang!) 
(Here we go)

So put your best face on, everybody
Pretend you know this song, everybody
Come hang
Let's go out with a bang 
(Bang! Bang! Bang!) 
I'm way too young to lie here forever
I'm way too old to try, so whatever
Come hang
Let's go out with a bang 
(Bang! Bang! Bang!) 

Feel like I'm gonna puke 'cause my taxes are due
Do my password begin with a one or a two?
Been a hell of a ride but I'm thinkin' it's time to grow
(Bang! Bang! Bang!) 
(Metronome)
Man, I'm up to something (up to something), ooh-dee-la-dee-doh
Thank you all for comin' (all for coming), I hope you like the show
'Cause it's on a budget, so ooh-dee-la-dee-doh
Yeah, come on here we go, yeah, come on (here we go)

So put your best face on, everybody
Pretend you know this song, everybody
Come hang
Let's go out with a bang 
(Bang! Bang! Bang!) 
I'm way too young to lie here forever
I'm way too old to try, so whatever
Come hang
Let's go out with a bang 
(Bang! Bang! Bang!) (Bang! Bang-bang) 
(Bang! Bang! Bang!) (Bang! Bang-bang! Bang! Bang!)

Been a hell of a ride but I'm thinkin' it's time to go

So put your best face on, everybody
Pretend you know this song, everybody
Come hang
Let's go out with a bang 
(Bang! Bang! Bang!) 
(Here we go)

So put your best face on, everybody
Pretend you know this song, everybody
Come hang
Let's go out with a bang 
(Bang! Bang! Bang!) (Bang! Bang-bang) 
I'm way too young to lie here forever
I'm way too old to try, so whatever
Come hang (come hang)
Let's go out with a bang 
(Bang! Bang! Bang!) 
(Here we go)
(Bang! Bang!)
