		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time stands still
When you feel like I feel
I forget where I was goin'
But I know who I'ma go with, it's you (you)
We're in motion, and I'm emotional
And I'm all over you
So what you wanna do?

Oh, if you don't mind
Closing your eyes
Just give me your time
'Cause you've got all mine

We've got one life
I won't waste it, one life
I'm gon' taste the joy in every minute
Beginnin' 'til the finish
We've got one life
Get lost together, one life
We'll go wherever 'til the ride is over
Everywhere and nowhere, we'll go

Where we'll go
We don't know
Everywhere and nowhere, we'll go
Where we'll go (whoa)
We don't know (yeah)
Let's go everywhere and nowhere

Days turn night
Let's bathe in the moonlight
Dance around the stars
Maybe go too far
Sensational
No particular place to go
Feeling insatiable
Like even outer space could be attainable

But if you don't mind
We'll let our love fly
Just give me your time
'Cause you've got all mine

We got one life
I won't waste it, one life
I'm gon' taste the joy in every minute
Beginnin' 'til the finish
We've got one life
Get lost together, one life
We'll go wherever 'til the ride is over
Everywhere and nowhere, we'll go

Where we'll go
We don't know (ooh)
Everywhere and nowhere, we'll go
Where we'll go (whoa)
We don't know (yeah)
Let's go everywhere and nowhere

I wanna take you everywhere (ayy), and maybe nowhere (let's go out tonight)
I wanna take you (go out tonight)
I wanna take you there (yeah)
I wanna take you everywhere (ooh), and maybe nowhere (let's go out tonight)
I wanna take you (go out tonight)
I wanna take you there

Ooh, if you don't mind
We'll let our love fly
Just give me your time
'Cause you've got all mine

We've got one life
I won't waste it, one life
I'm gon' taste the joy in every minute
Beginnin' 'til the finish
We've got one life
Get lost together, one life
We'll go wherever 'til the ride is over
Everywhere and nowhere, we'll go

Where we'll go
We don't know (come on)
Let's go everywhere and nowhere
Go-go-go
Where we'll go (yeah)
We don't know
Let's go everywhere and nowhere
One life
