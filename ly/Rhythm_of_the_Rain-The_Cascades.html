		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain (ahh)
Telling me just what a fool I've been (pitter patter, rap-tap-tap)
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain (ahh)
And let me be alone again (pitter patter, rap-tap-tap)

The only girl I care about has gone away (ahh)
Looking for a brand new start (pitter patter, rap-tap-tap)
But little does she know that when she left that day (ahh)
Along with her she took my heart (pitter patter, rap-tap-tap)

Rain please tell me now does that seem fair
For her to steal my heart away when she don't care?
I can't love another when my hearts somewhere far away (ooh)

The only girl I care about has gone away (ahh)
Looking for a brand new start (pitter patter, rap-tap-tap)
But little does she know that when she left that day (ahh)
Along with her she took my heart (pitter patter, rap-tap-tap)

Rain won't you tell her that I love her so
Please ask the sun to set her heart aglow
Rain in her heart and let the love we knew start to grow (ooh)

Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain (ahh)
Telling me just what a fool I've been (pitter patter, rap-tap-tap)
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain (ahh)
And let me be alone again (pitter patter, rap-tap-tap)

Oh, listen to the falling rain (ahh)
Pitter patter, pitter patter (ahh)
Ooh listen, listen to the falling rain (ahh)
Pitter patter, pitter patter, ohh (ahh)
Ooh listen, listen to the falling rain (ahh)
