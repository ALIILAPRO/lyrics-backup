		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Underneath all the thundering there's magic 
And if there's a better way to live, I've gotta have it
Because I think all but when I drink I'm OK
It gets further away everytime I try to grab it
Underneath all the chattering theres heaven
I gotta peak one day made me feel like I was seven
I know it exists but I can't stop getting pissed
One more thing I'll be adding to the list

Faoi dheireadh tá deireadh tagtha le mo rut
Mar bhí lá maith agamsa inniu buíochas le foc
So I stroll I dtreo an pholl sa bhalla
Four digit code, what do you know its Mo Chara
And I'm gonna be spending my dole tonight
Two pints at a time strolling about like Dolemite
But home for a shite ar dtús, thit sé amach one push
Mar nach raibh bac ar bith ag bailiú strap inniu, seo Móglaí Bap 
(What's happening)
And then we both jump down and do a class handstand 
Like a man's man can
Fág slán leis an dúshlán a bhí againn an mhí seo 
Mar go dtí seo, I'm on the upside of the sea-saw

Underneath all the thundering there's magic 
And if there's a better way to live, I've gotta have it
Because I think all but when I drink I'm OK
It gets further away everytime I try to grab it
Underneath all the chattering theres heaven
I gotta peak one day made me feel like I was seven
I know it exists but I can't stop getting pissed
One more thing I'll be adding to the list

Go fóill ag mothú cosúil le cac
Ach ní ligim orm féin cause an ndéanann sé stop? 
Obviously not, what? Is mise moglai bap
Cuirim mo raybans orm sula bhfágaim an teach 
Nó ba chuma liom, cause tá an t-am ag dul anonn
Is tá an saol seo I bhfad róghairid bheith ag cur amú an oiread ama ann 
Go síoraí I do cheann ag iarraidh éalú achan soicind 
Irish exit out the back without text 
Mar caithfidh tú tú féin a chur chun tosaigh
I bhfad rófhurast bheith chomh crua ort féin I gcónaí
Mar ní haon áit bheith i’do chónaí, déan cibé rud dtig leat a stócaigh
Is faigh fíor-bhlas sula n-imíonn an beocht di

Underneath all the thundering there's magic 
And if there's a better way to live, I've gotta have it
Because I think all but when I drink I'm OK
It gets further away everytime I try to grab it
Underneath all the chattering theres heaven
I gotta peak one day made me feel like I was seven
I know it exists but I can't stop getting pissed
One more thing I'll be adding to the list

Finally there's an end to my rut, because I had a good day today, thank fuck
So I stroll towards the hole in the wall, 4 digit code, what do you know its Mo Chara
And I'm gonna be spending my dole tonight
Two pints at a time strolling about like Dolemite
But home for a shite first, it fell out with one push
Because there was no complications collecting tick today, so Móglaí Bap? 
(What's happening)
And then we both jump down and do a class handstand like a man's man can
Say goodbye to the challenges we have had this month 
Because so far I'm on the upside of the sea-saw

Underneath all the thundering there's magic 
And if there's a better way to live, I've gotta have it
Because I think all but when I drink I'm OK
It gets further away everytime I try to grab it
Underneath all the chattering theres heaven
I gotta peak one day made me feel like I was seven
I know it exists but I can't stop getting pissed
One more thing I'll be adding to the list

Still feeling like shite 
But I don’t let on cause does it stop? 
Obviously not, what? Coz I’m moglai bap
I stick my raybans on before I leave the gaff 
I didn’t care, cause the time is going on 
And this life is far too short to be wasting so much time on it
Always in ur head tryna get out every second
Irish exit out the back without text 
Cause you have to big yourself up 
Way to easy to be hard on yourself always 
Cause it’s no place to live do the best you can lad
Get a real taste before the life leaves her
