		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been a long time gone
Did you miss me oh?
This is what you wanted
This is what you chose
Where did we go wrong?
Oh I think you know
Oh I think you know

Hello it's me, I'm the voices in your head
Sou shut me out, but you're listening again
You try to run, try to hide
But I keep on coming back
I think we should be friends

Said you'd lock me away
Oh I thought that you might
But you know that I'm always on your mind

Hello it's me I'm the voices in your head
You said you wouldn't but you're listening again
You try to run, try to hide
But you know it wouldn't last
I think we should be friends

Hello it's me I'm the voices in your head
You shut me out, but you're listening again
You try to run, try to hide but I keep on coming back
I think we should be friends
