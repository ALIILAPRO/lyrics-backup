		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was the knight in shining armor in your movie
Would put your lips on mine and love the aftertaste
Now I'm a ghost, I call your name, you look right through me
You're the reason I'm alone and masturbate

I, I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie, lie, l-lie I tried to hide
But now you know it

That I'm at an all time
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

I was the prototype like 3 Stacks on that CD
An example of the perfect candidate
Now all your girlfriends say that you don't want to see me
You're the reason that I just can't concentrate

I, (I, I) I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie (lie, lie), lie, l-lie I tried to hide
But now you know it

That I'm at an all time
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

Yo, it's the same old shit, I'm feelin' low again
Another iPhone 6 I have to throw again
'Cuh you raise your voice, I lose my head, I need to blow again
Make me cancel off a show again
We started from the bottom
If them seeds never blossom, let me sow again
Like, I can reckon we could glow again
But you're just sayin' no again
I get depressed and hit the crow again
Then Flipz phoned my phone like
"If it's that fuckin' hoe again"
And bro, you need to 'llow it 'cuh you're better than that
And bro, sometimes I wish you never met her and that
You know it's tour time, bro, you know there's pressure in that
You're at an all time low and I can't settle with that
He said, "Look, bro, you're winnin'," and then I started grinnin'
Like, "Yeah, man, you're right, I'm like the shit with all the trimmings"
I jump in my whip, but just before I go and skrr off
I roll down my tints and say it's her loss, we're done now, cool

Hey!
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
