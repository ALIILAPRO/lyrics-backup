		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’ll do things the hard way
Maybe I’ll run
Maybe I’ll stay
Standing at the edge again
Before we’re done
I’ll hear you say
This could go one of two ways
One of two ways
Just like a flip of a coin
There’s a choice
I don’t wanna make
One of two ways
Heads I’m strong enough
But tails I’ll break
Like a flip of a coin
There’s a choice that I don’t wanna make
This could go one of two ways
One of two ways
O, One of two ways
One of two ways
One of two ways
Looking up at the pinnacle
What have I done
Is it too late Standing at the edge again
All before it’s over
I’ll hear you say
One of two ways
Heads I’m strong enough
But tails I’ll break
Like a flip of a coin
There’s a choice that I don’t wanna make
This could go one of two ways (One of two ways)
One of two ways (One of two ways)
O, One of two ways (One of two ways)
One of two ways (One of two ways)
This could go one of two ways (One of two ways)
One of two ways (One of two ways)
Like a flip of a coin
There’s a choice that I don’t wanna make (One of two ways)
This could go one of two ways
