		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Raining again
I ought to get out from under
Sometimes I wonder
Sometimes I don't wonder at all

And as for loving again
Somewhere, somebody might need me
But where would it lead me?
I'd just be rising to fall

Love was easy to believe in
When you wanted me yesterday
But I couldn't feel the touch of time upon tomorrow

After you
What am I gonna be?
You took a part of me
As you were passing through

After you
How am I gonna find
The me I left behind
That I'll meet after you?

Drifting again
From place to place without reason
Season to season
I just keep running away

And as for people again
I'm just a girl who discovers
Now and then lovers
Who never ask me to stay

Love was easy to believe in
When I walked in the light of you
Now I'm walking by myself
And all I see is darkness

After you
What am I gonna be?
You took a part of me
As you were passing through

After you
How am I gonna find
The me I left behind
That I'll meet after you?

Raining again
I ought to get out from under
Sometimes I wonder
Sometimes I don't wonder at all

After you
How am I gonna find
The me I left behind
That I'll meet after you?

After you
What am I gonna be?
You took a part of me
As you were passing through

Raining again
Raining again
Raining again

After you
What am I gonna be?
Raining again
