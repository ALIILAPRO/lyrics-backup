		<p>
		  it's a sunny day
it's so bright, so bright, so bright
it's a sunny day
it's so bright, so bright, so bright

Let's take a walk
in the woods
take your mind off
yeah you should
Let's take a walk
up to the moon
take your mind off
yeah you should
come on
darlin'
follow me
you will see
come on
baby
today is a good day
caus'

it's a sunny day
it's so bright, so bright, so bright
it's a sunny day
it's so bright, so bright, so bright

come on
darlin'
follow me
you will see
come on
baby
today is a good day
caus'
