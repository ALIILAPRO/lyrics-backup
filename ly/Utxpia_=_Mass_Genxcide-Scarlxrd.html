		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you become a big fat star, you ain't ever gonna forget
Your buddies that always stuck by you now, are you?
Well of course not
But don't pitch yourself sir
This is gonna be an awful lot of hard work, and I hope you're up to it
Yeah, uh
Don't say I didn't warn ya

Fuck 'em all
Rock a size 12 in my head I kick the door
Leave them fighting over bread the crumbs is small
No I can not take it steady this a war
No, you'll never will forget me I'm a force, uh
Backyard got a court, uh
Young Scar yeah he ball, huh
Back to back when I score
This flow nostalgia when I can't be bothered
This shit here will cost ya instant karma
Please forgive me, father
Please forgive me, father

Let's go (ayy), what?
Why do you? Why do you?
Okay
Why don't they like me? Why don't they love me?
Why don't they love me? Why don't they like me?
Don't you like me?
Why don't you
Why don't you crucify?

Fuck
(Bleh)
Watch me raise up the death rate
Mass genocide on my mind like aah
Sorry, I was healthy but I can't change
Little bitch you are mine right now
Why you running? I'm just killing you softly
Little bitch you are mine right now

(Oh, fuck)
Little bitch you are mine right now
Watch me raise up the death rate
Mass genocide on my mind like aah
Sorry, I was healthy but I can't change
Little bitch you are mine right now
Why you running? I'm just killing you softly
Little bitch you are mine right now
