		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Into the night I've gotta go
That's when the juices start to flow
Everything will be alright

I might be blind but I can see
I got the power inside of me
Everything will be alright

I'm never gonna crack under a witch's spell
Never put her chain's on me
I'm never gonna break
You know I'll never tell
I know she'll never let me be

Party, party with the animals
Party, no dogs allowed
Party, party with the animals
Party, no dogs allowed no more

I like it fast, I like it slow
There's no direction I couldn't go
Everything will be alright

I like it loud, I like it mean
I got the thunder in my machine
Everything will be alright

Dancing with disaster is a part of me
I'm never gonna let it go
Don't know what I'm after, I'm deserting me
The secret that I'll never know

Party, party with the animals
Party, no dogs allowed
Party, party with the animals
Party, no dogs allowed no more

No more, no more
Hey baby, I like it, girl
No more, no more
Hey baby, I like it, girl

Party, party with the animals
Party, no dogs allowed
Party, party with the animals
Party, no dogs allowed

Party, party with the animals
Party, no dogs allowed
Party, party with the animals
Party, no dogs allowed
