		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hear them whisper secrets
'Til my name is dirt
But I will not falter
I will hide the hurt
And I can feel the earth
Like it's a part of me
But never have I felt so alone
No place to call my home

Ooh, the wind blows
Someday I will follow
Far away from this lonely town

In that darkest hour
I'll spark a flame
Heart that can't surrender
Burns into a hostile blaze
In that darkest hour
You'll know my name
I will hold the power
And I'll run that game

They built a tower
But I climbed so high
I could almost reach it
The sunrise
And damn your love
And damn your hope
All those fears that made you cold
I forgive them all

Ooh, the wind blows
Someday I will follow
Far away from this lonely town

In that darkest hour
I'll spark a flame
Heart that can't surrender
Burns into a hostile blaze
In that darkest hour
You'll know my name
I will hold the power
And I'll run that game

I'll run this game
Ooh
