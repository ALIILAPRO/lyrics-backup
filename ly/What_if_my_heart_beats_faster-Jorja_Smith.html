		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please, don't take for granted what I said on the phone if I was sorry
You shouldn't take for granted what I said on the phone if I was sorry, now
Don't forget to leave a message if you got a problem and not ask me about, mm
Whatever you say, whatever you do, I don't really care
Tell me 'bout the lies in the corner of your smile, I think we've all got them
I don't think it's funny all the time but you may see that I laugh often anyway, well
I couldn't decide how I felt the time that my face said differently
Funny how life will change but they never figure it out

If I ever find my heart beat faster
I could love for miles and still not open up
I should call this off knowin' that I'll never feel how they could
Funny how life will change but they never figure you out

You can't read my mind and tell me something that you think that I would like in there
I'm just bein' polite, no, I'm not tryin' to offend you, I just know better now
I finally realized what I like and I didn't have always been this way
Funny how life will change but they never figure it out

If I ever find my heart beat faster, oh
I could love for miles and still not open up, oh
I should call this off knowin' that I'll never feel how they could
Funny how life will change but they never figure it out
Funny how life will change but they never figure you out

Only realize that all the times that I've had so many signs for this now
You will never know what's really right even if you have it all written down
I could read your mind and try and tell you something nice but it's worth more than that
You will never know how much I feel 'cause it looks like I feel nothing at all
I'm not tryin' to run, you just didn't want to hear it being over
I was always scared of bein' so close so I'd never have to feel like this, no, well
You could try and tell me, and it hurts knowin' that I'll never feel how you feel, oh
I used to think about this all the time, but instead I would just hold it down, oh
There's no need to run, no need to hide 'cause I figured out I got this, oh well
You'll never understand what's on my mind and I know that it cuts deeper
