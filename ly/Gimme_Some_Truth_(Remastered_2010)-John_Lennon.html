		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm sick and tired of hearing things from
Uptight, short sided, narrow minded hypocrites
All I want is the truth, just give me some truth
I've had enough of reading things
By neurotic, psychotic, pigheaded politicians
All I want is the truth
Just give me some truth

No short-haired, yellow-bellied
Son of Tricky Dicky's
Gonna Mother Hubbard soft soap me
With just a pocket full of hope
Money for dope
Money for rope, woo-hoo

No short-haired, yellow-bellied
Son of Tricky Dicky's
Gonna Mother Hubbard soft soap me
With just a pocket full of soap
Money for dope 
Money for rope

I'm sick to death of seeing things from
Tight-lipped, condescending, mama's little chauvinists
All I want is the truth, just give me some truth, now
I've had enough of watching scenes with
Schizophrenic, egocentric, paranoid prima-donnas
All I want is the truth, now-now 
Just give me some truth

No short-haired, yellow-bellied
Son of Tricky Dicky's
Gonna Mother Hubbard soft soap me
With just a pocket full of soap
It's money for dope
Money for rope

Ah, I'm sick to death of hearing things from
Uptight, short-sighted, narrow minded hypocrites
All I want is the truth, now
Just give me some truth, now
I've had enough of reading things
By neurotic, psychotic, pigheaded politicians
All I want is the truth, now
Just give me some truth, now
All I want is the truth, now
Just give me some truth, now
All I want is the truth
Just give me some truth
All I want is the truth
Just give me some truth
