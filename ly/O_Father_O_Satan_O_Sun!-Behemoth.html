		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Akephalos
Shine through me
Come forth in war
Come forth in peace
Bring down the sun
Extinguish all the stars
Let me remain in splendor of thy light

Bornless one
As darkness bright
Found not in tongues
Found not in light
Bring down the rain
Drain waters of Styx
Faustian luminary
Redeem blaspheme
Like a day without the dawn
Like a ray void of the sun
Like a storm that brings no calm
I'm most complete yet so undone

Agathos Daimon of plague and fever
Thy name is nowhere, thy name is never
Liberate me
Ignite the seeds
Bind not to guilt
Ignis Gehennalis

Oh father, oh satan, oh sun
Let the children come to thee
Behold the morning star
Akephalos
Shine through me
Come forth in war
Come forth in peace

Like a day without the dawn
Like a ray void of the sun
Like a storm that brings no calm
I'm most complete yet so undone

O Lion-Serpent Sun, the beast that whirlest forth
A thunder-bolt, begetter of life
Thou that flowest, thou that goest
Thou Satan-Sun, Hadith, that goest without will
Thou air, breath, spirit, thou without bound or bond
Thou essence, air swift-streaming, elasticity
Thou wanderer, father of all
Thou wanderer, spirit of all

Hear me, and make all spirits subjects unto me
So that every spirit of the firmament and of the ether
Upon the earth and under the earth
On dry land and in the water of whirling air, and of rushing fire
And every spell and scourge of God
May be obedient unto me

Thou spiritual sun, satan, thou eye, thou lust
Cry aloud, cry aloud
Whirl the wheel, oh my father, oh satan, oh sun
