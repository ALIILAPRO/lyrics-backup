		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you, yeah

It started polite, out on thin ice
'Til you came over to break it
I threw you a line and you were mine

Yeah, I was afraid, but you made it safe
I guess that is our combination
Said you feel lost, well, so do I

So won't you call me in the morning?
I think that you should call me in the morning
If you feel the same, 'cause

Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you, yeah

Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you, yeah

Engulfed in the flames
Engulfed in the shame
Betrayed by your imagination
In over my head, but that's alright

So won't you call me in the morning?
I think that you should call me in the morning
If you feel the same, 'cause

Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you, yeah

Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you

The world keeps on spinning, but I ain't dizzy yet, yeah
The more that you give, give, give, give, the more that you get

It's just us two in the crowd, we feel alone
I turn every chair that you sit in into a throne
Not too many of 'em put it down like me
I say it humbly, but they don't wear the crown like me
It's all in your eyes, locked, loaded, we were rolling
You make the whole room feel slow-motion
You make me feel like I'm drowning in a potion
Closed off, tryna get a little open
The more that I give, the more that I get
So baby, I'ma call you in the AM
You're down for my love, honey, say when
I'll be waitin' on my time 'cause I'm patient

Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you, yeah

Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you, yeah
