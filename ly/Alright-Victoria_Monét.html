		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He gave me some dick in bed, now he think his dick is embedded
'Bout to leave his text on read, I'ma let him know that I read it

Makin' niggas feel a way, it's a forte, really
Might not even hit you when I'm in your city
Thought you was about to get some foreplay with me?
You won't even get a picture of these 4K titties

I'm gon' be on my shit tonight
No one on my hip tonight
Plus I got this feelin'
Life's alright, alright
Gon' be on my shit tonight
No one on my hip tonight
Plus I got this feelin'
Life's alright, alright

Alright, alright
Alright
Alright, alright

Once he think he touched my soul, I'll be back out here solo
Yeah, he might call me a ho, but I like to call it immortal

Makin' niggas feel a way, it's a forte, really
Might not even hit you when I'm in your city
Thought you was about to get some foreplay with me?
You won't even get a picture of these 4K titties

I'm gon' be on my shit tonight
No one on my hip tonight
Plus I got this feelin'
Life's alright, alright
Gon' be on my shit tonight
No one on my hip tonight
Plus I got this feelin'
Life's alright, alright

Alright, alright
Alright
Alright, alright

Tonight, tonight, tonight
Alright, alright
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Alright, alright
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Alright, alright
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Alright, alright
