		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I need you in rotation
Now I only want it more, oh, ohh-oh
'Cause in my imagination
You take my hand and then we're rollin' on the floor

So good
So nice
You'll find me where the lights are low
So good
You're my vice
No, I can't stand it no more

Temptation
Won't you set me free?
Make my fantasy come true
Temptation
What you do to me
Got me begging please for you

When you call my name
I feel it in my veins
Put my heart in overdrive
Temptation
Won't you set me free?
Bring my fantasy to life

Oh, we're only get started, mmh
I can tell you feel it too, uh, uh-uh
Like a flicker in the darkness
I pull you in and then I tell you what to do

So good (so good)
So nice (so nice)
You'll find me where the lights are low
So good (so good)
You're my vice (so good)
No, I can't stand it no more

Temptation
Won't you set me free?
Make my fantasy come true
Temptation
What you do to me
Got me begging please for you

When you call my name
I feel it in my veins
Put my heart in overdrive
Temptation
Won't you set me free?
Bring my fantasy to life

Overdrive
Overdrive
Overdrive
Overdrive
Overdrive
Overdrive
Overdrive
Overdrive, overdrive

Temptation (overdrive)
Won't you set me free? (Overdrive)
Make my fantasy come true (overdrive)
Temptation (overdrive)
What you do to me (overdrive)
Got me begging please for you (overdrive)

When you call my name
I feel it in my veins
Put my heart in overdrive (overdrive, baby)
Temptation
Won't you set me free?
Bring my fantasy to life
