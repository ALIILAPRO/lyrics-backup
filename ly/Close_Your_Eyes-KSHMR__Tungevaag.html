		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We felt the world go up in flames
And now we're nothing but a memory
So now I long for yesterday
I never thought I'd miss the rain

We can hold on to forever
We're alone, but we're together
Through the night
Through the night
I'm by your side

So hold on to me forever
We're alone, but we're together
Through the night 
Through the night 
I'm by your side
Just close your eyes

Just close your eyes
Close your eyes
I'm by your side

We tell ourselves it's not too late
Ten thousand days, a million miles away
So every night I lie awake
And think of all the things I'd say
In every dream I see your face

We can hold on to forever
We're alone, but we're together
Through the night
Through the night
I'm by your side

So hold on to me forever
We're alone, but we're together
Through the night 
Through the night 
I'm by your side
Just close your eyes

Just close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
I'm by your side

We can hold on to forever
We're alone, but we're together
Through the night
Through the night
I'm by your side

So hold on to me forever
We're alone, but we're together
Through the night 
Through the night 
I'm by your side
Just close your eyes
