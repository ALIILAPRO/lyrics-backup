		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On a frozen subway corner late December 
Oh I swear to God your face it stopped the rain 
Yeah your voice is like a song my soul remembers
Sing it again love, just sing it again 

You had that vinyl record player from your father 
We were dancing to the New York City trains 
And they told us love was hard but I know I loved you harder 
Play it again love, play it again

This is our song 
You can take the music with you  
It plays long after we're gone 
So If you're ever lonely 
Put that radio on
Cause this is our song
This is our song.

Will you let this be the soundtrack to our story
When the candle's burning slowly till the end
Don't you hear your father saying child don't worry
Sing it again love, just sing it again 

This is our song 
You can take the music with you  
It plays long after we're gone 
So If you're ever lonely 
Put that radio on
It plays our song
This is our song
