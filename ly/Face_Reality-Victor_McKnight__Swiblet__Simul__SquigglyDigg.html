		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Listen to the radio
The safety's lost and we will show
Our preparations and what you know
Will surely help you flow
You know you'll never swing
When the colors gone and everything
Has signed their way as my offspring
And now you'll hear them sing

Calling out, you're in danger
A stranger, he's angered
Your life's on the line, running out of time
All through these halls I would wager
You're braver, a savior determined to find
And crawl through his mind


Seeking for answers with darkened thoughts
Blind, yet you clearly see us
Praying that you will rise up
Wake up and face reality

Deep down you leave your cage
It's a twisted world, but I'm on the stage
In 30 years, we stay of age
You think it's time for change
This is the rise and fall
Rooms full of dolls, Two separate calls
"Ink's on my walls!" "Not in my halls!"
You're bound to hear them all go

Chanting out, you're believing
Deceiving, no screaming
Our faith's in our skin
And our life is built-in
And in the course of this contest
I've been blessed, it's my nest
Determined to win
Wandering's a terrible sin

Seeking for answers with darkened thoughts
Blind, yet you clearly see us
Praying that you will rise up
Wake up and face reality


In between the breakdowns you can
Always find the keys
It's time to believe in what you can't see
Of the devil's tide
Welcome to my horror show can I get an amen?
All eyes on me here you are only my toy
I witness it all right before my eyes
Liar, liar
I've been away for the longest time
Build up our machine you die tonight
We flow together
So devilish, so devilish, so devilish
You've been away for far too long

You think it's laughable
We'll appease the gods
But you're just frightened
More dreaming dreaming dreaming
Have faith and soon you'll be enlightened
Wishing for the impossible
Well that's just crazy, wouldn't you think
Why don't you just calm down
Pick up that Bacon soup, take a drink

Just a pencil and a dream
Success, fortune, power, that's all it takes
Any short of my vision? Ha! No!
I'll raise the stakes!
Your credence of suffering, and
You feel I'm on the brink?
Well Boris, Alice, and Bendy
They'll all rise in the ink! Ahh
Ha ha ha ha ha!

Seeking for answers with darkened thoughts
Blind, yet you clearly see us
(Blind, yet you clearly see us)
Praying that you will rise up
Wake up and face reality

Begging for mercy in your workplace
Bold, but you are a disgrace
(Bold, but you are a disgrace)
Dreams come true no blood to erase
Wake up and face reality
