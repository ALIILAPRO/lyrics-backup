		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wasn't young still
I was hardly even born yet
Half of my mind made up on a cigarette
It's like how having a good thing ain't enough to do just often
As I exhale I start coughing
When the day came that I learned how to feel right
Those were the end times creeping out of sight
It's like how when a good friend
Can't even see you rarely
But as you meet up
You feel so close it's scary
Oh oh oh, you're talking slow
As I light your smoke
You stumble home
You stumble home
If my old friends leave me unanswered
Or forget any of the good times
That there once were
In case I take that to heart
Like I tend to do
I could mend the bleeding side hole
With the sweetest words coming from you
Oh oh oh, you're talking slow
As I light your smoke
You stumble home
You stumble home
To the pieces of me not broken
But torn apart all the same
Well I just recently started learning
How I should behave
If my biggest fears are ever confirmed
And I'm able to sum them up
In seventy words
I'll give credit to my head
For validating concerns back when
It almost killed me
And I'll reprimand clear thought
For faking its own rationality
Oh oh oh, you're talking slow
As I light your smoke
You stumble home
Oh oh oh, you're talking slow
As I light your smoke
You stumble home
You stumble home
