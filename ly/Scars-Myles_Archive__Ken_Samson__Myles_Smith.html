		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And i've been questioning if I'm enough
Cause lately I've been feeling so low
and all the thoughts that I've been thinking of
on these roads, I don't know where I should roam

now this ain't right yeah
tell me how I lose my sense of time yeah
and all the feelings that I'm feeling don't feel right yeah
cause you're so righteous and in the dark, I'm blinded
the pain you caused it won't go

and it ain't right, right now
and can you turn the lights out now, cause I like it
and you'll see me fade right out
fade right out, like the scars from my body

you know I don't like to, yet, since I met you I've been going out so I can feel love
can't control my life no more
I was tired of feeling like the warmth you had, had grown cold

and do I even matter no, yeah?
and do I even matter no, or yeah?
and do I even matter no, yeah?
do I even matter no, or yeah?

and it ain't right, right now
and can you turn the lights out now, cause I like it
and you'll see me fade right out
fade right out, like the scars from on body

rides out...
