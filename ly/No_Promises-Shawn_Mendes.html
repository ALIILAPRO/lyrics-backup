		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Staring out my hotel window
Too much on my mind
Maybe we should keep it simple
We don't have to decide
Oh no, we don't need to over-complicate it
'Cause I've been here once before don't even say it

Baby, please no promises (whoa)
'Cause we won't keep our promises (whoa)
And I know the consequences (whoa)
So baby please, baby please no promises

I've never been a fan of heartbreak
So tell me what you want
Take my hands across your body
We don't have to hold on
Oh no, we don't need to over-complicate it
'Cause I've been here once before don't even say it

Baby, please no promises (whoa)
'Cause we won't keep our promises (whoa)
And I know the consequences (whoa)
So baby please, baby please no promises

'Cause I've living only for this moment
And I don't wanna let it slip away
I've been living only for this moment
And I don't know how much that I can take, yeah

Baby, please no promises (whoa)
'Cause we won't keep our promises (whoa)
And I know the consequences (whoa)
So baby please, baby please no promises

Yeah baby, please no promises, yeah
Oh, baby, please no promises
Baby, please
Baby, please no promises
