		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I gave my knuckles a run for their money
Spider web, cracks on the mirror
I see someone but not somebody
If I could then I would
If I could then I would
If I could

I let my demons take hold and choke on me
Can't fill these holes that I'm digging
Can't stop my heart when it's sinking
But if I could then I would
If I could then I would
If I could

If I could you don't think I would pretend
Troubles coming but I still don't know when
That's the voice that I can hear in my head
I hear it over and over again

I hear trouble coming
I hear trouble coming
I hear trouble coming
Over and over again
I hear trouble coming
I hear trouble coming
I hear trouble coming
Over and over again

In my reflection I see signs of psychosis
I try to pay them no attention
Can't keep them under the surface
If I could then I would
If I could then I would
If I could

If I could you don't think I would pretend
Troubles coming but I still don't know when
That's the voice that I can hear in my head
I hear it over and over again

I hear trouble coming
I hear trouble coming
I hear trouble coming
Over and over again
I hear trouble coming
I hear trouble coming
I hear trouble coming
Over and over again

I can't wait forever
'Cause I don't have the time left to spend
Wishing I was someone better
Wishing I could start all over again

I hear trouble coming
I hear trouble coming
I hear trouble coming
Over and over again
I hear trouble coming
I hear trouble coming
I hear trouble coming
Over and over again

I hear trouble coming
(If I could you don't think I would pretend)
I hear trouble coming
I hear trouble coming
(Troubles coming but I still don't know when)
I hear trouble coming
I hear trouble coming
(That's the voice that I can hear in my head)
I hear trouble coming
I hear trouble coming
(I hear it over and over again)

I hear trouble coming
I hear trouble coming
I hear trouble coming
Over and over again
I hear trouble coming
I hear trouble coming
I hear trouble coming
Over and over again
