		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Endless nights, they shot across the boat
You take the high road once again
And I'll take the lows
I see the sadness in your eyes now
And it's difficult to swallow
(It's difficult to swallow, to swallow)

Packed your bags, got out before the slope
Want you to stay for one more night
Would that just rock the boat?
I know I should've done the math
But it's still hard to let you go

But I know I'm not the only one
To fall for all the lies
That we were living in a house of cards
So, I can't be surprised when I'm

Waking up in a sea of sadness
And I know we'll make it a force of habit
Maybe, in a year or so, I'll be able just to laugh at it
But, for now, I spend my nights
Wishing we could just go back to it

Better half, that's what I thought you were
Path of glory, same old story
"Time's a thief", I've heard
You can hold the smoking gun
But I'll still shoot the messenger (messenger)

Sea of sorrows
You wiped it off my cheek
See you tomorrow
That's time borrowed for another week
I can't stand beside you now if you don't really want me

Well, I know I'm not the only one
To fall for all the lies
That we were living in a house of cards
So, I can't be surprised when I'm

Waking up in a sea of sadness
And I know we'll make it a force of habit
Maybe, in a year or so, I'll be able just to laugh at it
But for now, I spend my nights
Wishing we could just go back to it

I remember we were once in love
Remember we were once in love

I hope that when you think of us
You'll remember it the way it was
I hope that when you're missing me
You're missing what we used to be
I hope that when you're falling down
You remember how I stuck around
And I hope that when you look me up
You remember we were once in love

(We were once in love)
You remember we were once in love
(We were once in love)
Remember we were once in love

Waking up in a sea of sadness
And I know we'll make it a force of habit
Maybe, in a year or so, I'll be able just to laugh at it
But for now, I spend my nights
Wishing we could just go back to it
