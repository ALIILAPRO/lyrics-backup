		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been seein' too much of you lately
And you're starting to get on my nerves
This is exactly what happened last time
And it's not what we deserve

It's a, a waste of my time lately
And I'm running out of words
If it's really meant to be
Then you can find a way to see

And maybe you should just shut up
Even when it gets tough
Baby 'cause this is love
And you know when push comes to shove
It's gonna take the both of us
Baby, this is love
Baby, this is love

Love
Love
Love

It's really great to be with you
This is how I spend my life
But I'm capable of taking care of myself
So if you fuck this up then go take a hike

It's a waste of my time
Shakin' it up,
Goin' out to search if it's really meant to be
Then you could find a way to see

Maybe you should just shut up
Even when it gets tough
Baby cause this is love
And you know when push comes to shove
It's gonna take the both of us
Baby, this is love
Baby, this is love

You and me
We can both start over
Just the two of us
We can get a little closer

So follow me
Honestly
And you will see, yeah

Maybe you should just shut up
Even when it gets tough
Baby 'cause this is love
And you know when push comes to shove
It's gonna take the both of us
Baby, this is love
Baby, this is love

Maybe you should just shut up
Even when it gets tough
Baby 'cause this is love
And you know when push comes to shove
It's gonna take the both of us
Baby, this is love
Baby, this is love

Love
Love
Love
