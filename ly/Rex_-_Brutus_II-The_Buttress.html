		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ho!
I see now old friends do come to greet me
While outside lions roam city streets
Rife with the sounds of women weeping
Ghost!
Speak with me!
No - 
Your eyes already say the things that with your mouth you won't
Below my countrymen cry out for eachother's blood and anguish
The men and women now at war, each camp speaking different language
cnd yet both sides curse out at me as they toil and they languish
cm I even Brutus still? It's like I've forgotten my own name...
But the people call me Rex 
cnd as long as some still need me I'll remain
Whether I lead or I be lead
For all that's good and great begins and ends with them
My heart never beats in me alone 
But always through the hearts of other men
That want me dead

Sick, wasted, lazy and complacent
Brutus - come to take away from you the things you don't deserve
You're not worthy, I killed Caesar
He was my brother, my friend, you were neither!
You just shame me, named me Nimrod, enemy of God
I don't reject it either!
Brutus! Lover of humans
I don't need to prove it
Everything I do I do for you - 
ccts of cruelty, killed my teacher
I'll continue to, though they reject my love
I am no Cassius
I do not do what is best for myself, but for us -
The Public

Begone, cursed spirit!
Leave me Caesar
cm I my brother's keeper?
I don't mourn for you any more than you'll mourn me either
On that day soon, when I'll face you in Hades
Where I'll greet you with a kiss upon your face
I'm so excited, I can't wait!
I have no empathy, Rex!
When they send me their messengers I send back heads molested
I want to be a fierce and fearless leader like you were
But now here I supersede you -
The difference between you and me -
You act out of love for yourself
I do so for my love of the people

There, you - 
Have you no pride?
What are you doing?
Feel shame, it is I - Brutus the human
Come to make enemies among men
Make them like oil from water -
I will separate them!
Mothers will kill their own daughters
cnd friend will kill friend
It's not cruel or loveless or hatred
Cause even if it means I must erase you
I do so for the good of the many of those who must remain so please forgive me!

Rex! Brutus the rudest
Lover of men, descendant of Judith
It is my duty, I must separate them
Must divide them -
With tear in eye and iron stomach
Hey, there - 
Brutus the rudest
Lover of men, descendant of Judith
It is my duty, I must separate them
Like oil from water, I will separate them!

Here I go now...
Like Samson among the Philistines...
For I am become....
Death.
