		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something's on my mind
It's been for quite some time
This time I'm on to you

So where's the other face
The face I heard before
Your head trip's boring me

Let's nuke the bridge we torched two thousand times before
This time we'll blast it all to hell

I've had this burning in my gut now for so long
My belly's aching now to say

Stuck down in a rut
Of dislogic and smut
A side of you well hid

When it's all said and done
It's real and it's been fun
But was it all real fun?

Let's nuke the bridge we torched two thousand times before
This time we'll blast it all to hell

I've had this burning in my guts now for so long
My belly's aching now to say

To say
You're just
A fuck
I can't explain it 'cause I think you suck

I'm taking pride
In telling you to fuck off and die

I've had this burning in my guts now for so long
My belly's aching now to say

I'm taking pleasure in announcing this to you
So listen up 'cause you might miss

You're just
A fuck
I can't explain it 'cause I think you suck

I'm taking pride
In telling you to fuck off and die

Good night
