		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Born to be with you

By your side, satisfied
Through and through
'Cause I was born to be with you

Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm

Wondrously, love can see
So I knew that I was born to be with you

Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm

Do I find
Peace of mind
Yes, I do
'Cause I was born to be with you
All life through
Yes, I was born to be with you, hmm, hmm
