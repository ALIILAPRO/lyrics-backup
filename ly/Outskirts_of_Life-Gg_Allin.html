		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Always gonna fight, until the day I die
No laws or limits will stop me from the way I live my life
Don't get in my way, unless you want to die
I'm living fast and hard and I accelerate on high
I listen to the one, use who I got to use
Don't ever try and get too close, 'cause I'm a burning fuse
Everyone around me is someone I will play
I'm living out my life and I'm living day to day

Within the perimeters of this world I just don't feel real right
I'm living by the laws of a gun and a knife
My soul cannot be tamed, I'm living just to die
I'm living by myself on the outskirts of life

Live from state to state, living day by day
The only paycheck that I know is what I steal today
I like my girls real young, but keep marriage out of mind
I lick 'em and forget 'em because my friends I have no time
Never settle down, living just to fry
But all the things I take in life are things that you can't buy
I sleep all through the day time and I creep all through the night
But I'll live until I die on the outskirts of life

Within the perimeter of this world I just don't feel real right
I'm living by the laws of a gun and a knife
My soul cannot be tamed, I'm living just to die
I'm living by myself on the outskirts of life

Don't try talking to me, I just don't have the time
You bore me with your useless life, but you never know about mine
Listen to me closely, do exactly what I say
Give me what I want from you or I'll take it anyway
Liquor, drugs, whores and greyhounds, guns and violence too
In my world I'm living by the laws of who knows who
I have no fear of nothing, each day I set to die
So I'm living by myself on the outskirts of life

Within the perimeter of this world I just don't feel real right
I'm living by the laws of a gun and a knife
My soul cannot be tamed, 'cause I'm living just to die
I'm living by myself on the outskirts of life
