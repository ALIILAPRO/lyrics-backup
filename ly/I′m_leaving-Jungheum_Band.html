		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm about to leave this road
Leaving this dust and noise behind

I'm about to leave this way
Leaving this place full of sin and greed

A small warm wind blowing from my dry heart
That wind becomes my tears

You are the only reason
I'm gonna leave tomorrow
You are the only one
I have to fight the world
I'm about to leave this road
I'm on my way heading to you
Waited so long
I'm leaving

I'm about to leave this road
Turing my back to my days of tears and sadness
I'm about to leave this way
Against the pain and sighing days

A small warm wind blowing from my dry heart
The tears are soothing my sadness

You are the only reason
I'm gonna leave tomorrow
You are the only one
I have to fight the world

I'm about to leave this road
I'm on my way heading to you
Waited so long
I'm leaving
