		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One for the money
One for the show
I got a sexdate
With the neighbour hoe!
Go!

One for the money
One for the show
I got a sexdate
With the neighbour hoe!

The chicks getting colder
God of sex
Fuck this autotune
On bc bree bree tracks

Come an swallow my ice cream!

Wonderbra boulevard!

One for the money
One for the show
I got a sexdate
With the neighbour hoe!

Wohoohooho
With the neighbour hoe!
Wohoohooho
With the mighty camel toe!

Fuck your mom
Hahaha
What the fuck?!

Is this child doing here?
Oh my god he is watching me
Fucking his pretty mom
And he still is licking some of my ice cream

"Hey Kev, tell me, what did you do last night?"
"Do you remember this super-tittie ding-dong mam from the party?"
"She was damn hot!"
"I took her to my room."
"Tell me more!"

I fucked a hot mommy like G. Stefanie
She was hot, she was wild
We fucked through the night

The shit is vaginas
V-A-G-I-N-A-S 

Now I'm the star on the wonderbra boulevard
I am fucking famous
For cuming in your anus

I hate these fucking faces
These kids need a facegrind
Hate fucking braces

Wonderbra boulevard!

One for the money
One for the show
I got a sexdate
With the neighbour hoe!

Wohoohooho
With the neighbour hoe!
Wohoohooho
With the mighty camel toe!
