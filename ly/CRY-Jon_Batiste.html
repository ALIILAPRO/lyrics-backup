		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who do you love?
Who you gonna love?
Who do you love when push comes to shove?
How does it feel?
How's it gonna feel?
How does it feel when it's getting too real?

Why sometimes does it seem like all I wanna do
All I wanna do is cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry

What can you say?
What you gonna say
To make it okay?
And who's gonna pay?
Who will you fight?
How you gonna fight?
Who will you fight to make it alright?

Why sometimes does it feel like all I wanna do
All I wanna do is cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry

Floods keep on rising
Tears keep on falling down
Oh, why?
Cry

Cry, cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry

For the loss of the innocence
For the struggle of the immigrants
For the struggle of the immigrants
For the wrongful imprisonment (cry, cry, waoh)

Cry, cry
Cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
