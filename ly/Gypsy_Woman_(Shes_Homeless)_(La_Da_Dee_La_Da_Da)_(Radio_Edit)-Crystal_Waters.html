		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She wakes up early every morning
Just to do her hair now
Because she cares, y'all
Her day, oh, wouldn't be right
Without her makeup
She's never out of makeup
She's just like you and me
But she's homeless, she's homeless
As she stands there singing for money

La da dee la dee dow, la da dee la dee dow

You try, oh, not to care
About the homeless
But you got your own mess
You barely make enough for you
Well, is she alright?
Could you apologize?
And then I spotted these
As she stands there singing for money

La da dee la dee dow, la da dee la dee dow

In my sleep, I see her begging
Preaching, "Please"
Although her body's not mine
I ask, God, why? God, why?
She's just like you and me
But she's homeless, she's homeless
As she stands there singing for money

La da dee la dee dow, la da dee la dee dow

She wakes up early every morning
Just to do her hair now
Because she cares, y'all
Her day, oh, wouldn't be right
Without her makeup
She's never out of makeup
She's just like you and me
But she's homeless, she's homeless
She's homeless
She's homeless
She's homeless

She's just like you and me
As she stands there singing for money

La da dee la dee dow, la da dee la dee dow
La da dee la dee dow, la da dee la dee dow
La da dee la dee dow, la da dee la dee dow
La da dee la dee dow, la da dee la dee dow
La da dee la dee dow, la da dee la dee dow
La da dee la dee dow, la da dee la dee dow
La da dee la dee dow, la da dee la dee dow
La da dee la dee dow, la da dee la dee dow
La da dee la dee dow, la da dee la dee dow
La da dee la dee dow, la da dee la dee dow
La da dee la dee dow, la da dee la dee dow
La da dee la dee dow, la da dee la dee dow
