		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We've been designed
Never feel at all
To never feel what comes behind
I

We've been designed
Like never feared before
Like never feared before the night
Never feared before
Before, before, before, before
Never feared before

We've been designed
To never miss the world
To never miss the humankind
I

We've been designed
To never live before
To never live before this time
To never feel before
To never feel, never feel
Never feel before

Before, before, before, before, before
Never feel before

I
Let me fall
Let fall

Goodbye, goodbye
The sound of death
Another fool

Now, all of a sudden
Annoying sound
I'm falling down
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Why, why the sound of death has shape of life
Why this sound is carrying me

My life I am done
Why, why is taking me away
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

We've been designed
To never feel before
To never feel before this time

I never feel before
I never feel, never feel

Never feel before
