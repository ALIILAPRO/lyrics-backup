		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

Bring bring on the bicycle
Beep beep in the car
Ping ping a submarine
Phew phew helicopter (wow)
A choo choo train, an aeroplane
Or whee down the slide

I just adore-dore-dore you every day more
Wherever we are

So up in the sky
And deep in the ocean
Through valleys and hills
Away we go

Bring bring on the bicycle
Beep beep in the car
Ping ping a submarine
Phew phew helicopter (wow)
A choo choo train, an aeroplane
A rocket to the stars

There's a dance, dance, dance going on in my heart
Wherever we are

So up in the sky
And deep in the ocean
Through valleys and hills
Away we go

You little monkey who's staying up late
Who purrs like a cat when they get their own way
Who then turns into a lion who let's out a (roar)

I love, love, love you every day more
Whatever's in store

Woo, up in the sky
And deep in the ocean
Through valleys and hills
Away we go

Woo, up in the sky
And deep in the ocean
Through valleys and hills
Away we go
