		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If it's the end of the world and there's nobody left
would you stay here by my side

But I know that i'd try and two wrongs don't make a right,
but with us i think they might

I woulda woke up just to crash my car today
I'm on the bright side but the sky looks grey
So I plant some red flags to find my way
That's when you caught me in the streetlight ripping out some peace signs

Loose jeans, black vans studded belt on
Flare guns in the street just to be dumb
Stitched up but I'm broken too
That's when I saw you on the rooftop, watching all the bombs drop

Just two lost souls young and in the way
Nicotine and kerosene we're burning like a flame
love like a car crash, you'd never look away
gave it all but took my name

If it's the end of the world and there's nobody left
would you stay here by my side

But I know that i'd try and two wrongs don't make a right,
but with us i think they might

You woulda woke up just to paint some roses black
You're all smiles when you stab them in the back
You hit me in the chest, a heart attack
So when you said you're up for anything, I had to steal a wedding ring

Throwing rocks through the shopfronts,
beer cans and blunt guts,
swinging right and taking out a mailbox

Spray paint all the cop cars,
christen them with crowbars,
Take our broken parts and make a love heart

Just two lost souls young and in the way
Nicotine and kerosene we're burning like a flame
love like a car crash, you'd never look away
gave it all but took my name

If it's the end of the world and there's nobody left
would you stay here by my side

But I know that i'd try and two wrongs don't make a right,
but with us i think they might

So when we're both old and grey and the clocks running down,
would you stay here till the end

If it's the end of the world and there's nobody left
would you stay here by my side

But I know that i'd try and two wrongs don't make a right,
but with us i think they might

Just two lost souls young and in the way
Nicotine and kerosene we're burning like a flame
love like a car crash, u'd never look away
gave it all but took my name
