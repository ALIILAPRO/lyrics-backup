		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm coolin' but I'm booted
I got thirty in my tooly
You a lame, want to screw me
I'm so smooth, don't need no lubricant
Kodak making movies
My lil homie he a foolie
I be sticking, I be moving
I'm the youngest nigga to do this shit

I'm coolin' but I'm booted
I got thirty in my tooly
You a lame that want to screw me
I'm so smooth, don't need no lubricant
Kodak making movies
My lil homie he a foolie
I be sticking, I be moving
I'm the youngest nigga to do this shit

I'm zooted in the Phantom so I'm cruising
On the way to your lil' lady
I might fuck her in her booty
Dropped the Cutlass off the suited
Rocking Gucci, this ain't Coogi
Nigga better stop going to suzy
Nigga, and go get you a Cuban link
Pull up, make them niggas faint
I'm doing what you niggas can't
I'll wet a nigga up, no paint
All of my niggas I'm with don't think
Youngest nigga in the game
I'm fourteen when I caught a case
I was fifteen with a thirty-eight
I was sixteen, went to Larry James
I'm cooling but the block on fire
Scoop the twenty out the pot
None of my niggas ain't went to college
All of my niggas they out there probably
Drop the money, catch the body
Jimmy Neutron with the rocket
Fuck with me, you know I got it
I do it and won't talk about it

I'm coolin' but I'm booted
I got thirty in my tooly
You a lame, want to screw me
I'm so smooth, don't need no lubricant
Kodak making movies
My lil homie he a foolie
I be sticking, I be moving
I'm the youngest nigga to do this shit

I'm coolin' but I'm booted
I got thirty in my tooly
You a lame that want to screw me
I'm so smooth, don't need no lubricant
Kodak making movies
My lil homie he a foolie
I be sticking, I be moving
I'm the youngest nigga to do this shit

Run up if you stupid, come on
Clutching on that wooly, come on
I'm burning in the looting (aye)
I'm fleeing in the looting
Polo let me hold the Uzi
I just rented me a vert
I be playing with that work
Remember playing in the dirt
Call me Dora, it's in my backpack
Fuck that ho 'cause she a nat nat
I'm gon' always keep a clapback
I'm gon' always keep a gat
Give me head, I call it snapback
I just drove up in a hatchback
Got them pounds, ain't talking hashtags
Boy I'm working with that sack
Your old lady say you fool
I just ran off with your boo
Told me everything you say
She told me everything you do
Aye I'm playing with that wool
Aye I'm playing with tool
You fuckin' with my zoes
Like you playin' in a zoo, aye

I'm coolin' but I'm booted
I got thirty in my tooly
You a lame, want to screw me
I'm so smooth, don't need no lubricant
Kodak making movies
My lil homie he a foolie
I be sticking, I be moving
I'm the youngest nigga to do this shit

I'm coolin' but I'm booted
I got thirty in my tooly
You a lame that want to screw me
I'm so smooth, don't need no lubricant
Kodak making movies
My lil homie he a foolie
I be sticking, I be moving
I'm the youngest nigga to do this shit
