		  (Ooooo)
From time to time
I like to write
I wish I had
A few more tries
I wish I had
A little more time
I wish I had another life
If I bleed
Would you be there if I seemed like I been needing life
If I seem
Like I'm hiding something would you treat it nothing
Would you turn me in and say that I've been cutting
I have a lot of scars
Probably as much as there are stars
I have a world of my own
The only pain that I control
If I bleed
Would you be there if I seemed like I been needing life
If I seem
Like I'm hiding something would you treat it nothing
Would you turn me in and say that I've been
If I bleed
Would you be there if I seemed like I been needing life
If I seem
If I bleed
