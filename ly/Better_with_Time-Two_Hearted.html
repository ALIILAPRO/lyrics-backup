		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't say I saw this coming
You hit my blind spot, crashing now 
You turned what was into nothing
And now your memories fading out

Tell me how it feels all alone in the night 
Lost that spark in your eyes 
Pain in your eyes now baby 
They say it gets better with time 
Ohh
They say it gets better with time better with time now baby 
It all gets better with time 

Listen to me,
When I tell you I had enough
I cleared the path now I'm taking off
You told me I was safe when I never was 
The way you made the truth bend it will never end, the demons of your past coming back for you again, and I'm not feeling bad for you
No I'm not feeling bad

I never saw this coming, faith in you led me wrong 
Look at what you ended up in 
Waiting for the break of dawn

Tell me how it feels all alone in the night 
Lost that spark in your eyes 
Pain in your eyes now baby 
They say it gets better with time 
Ohh
They say it gets better with time better with time now baby 
It all gets better with time 

You're so used to the darkness
You let it shape who you are
Ive had to face that your heartless 
I should've know all along 
Chasing lows I can see at the time that
You were not ready for love
Passed up once so its pain you chose 
Yeah its pain you chose 

Tell me how it feels all alone in the night 
Lost that spark in your eyes 
Pain in your eyes now baby 
They say it gets better with time 
Ohh
They say it gets better with time better with time now baby 
It all gets better with time
