		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Riding through this town
Early morning hour
It's a ghost town
The houseless go pick flowers
Parking in the street
Faint glow, romanticize
And it's light blue
About you
Sick of writing songs
About you
It's been so long
And I'm scared to face the truth
The door is closed when I move on from you
And I want to say "I'm fine"
"You're not on my mind"
But I don't mind, I try to
I'm a ghost now
No matter where I run
Om Mani Padme Hum
'Bout you
What can I do?
Without you
What is there left to do?
'Bout you
Gave my heart to keep
You don't make any art for me
Every time I build a wall
See your face and watch it fall
Every time I build a wall
See your name and watch it fall
Every time I build a wall
Hear your voice and watch it fall
Every time I build a wall
See your art, it breaks my heart
Everytime I build a wall (Gave you my heart to keep)
See your face and watch it fall
Everytime I build a wall (You made nothing for me)
See your name and watch it fall (You make nothing for me)
Every time I build a wall (Gave you my heart to keep)
Hear your voice and watch it fall
Every time I bulid a wall (You made nothing for me)
See your art, it breaks my heart (You make nothing for me)
Gave you my heart to keep
You made nothing for me
You make nothing for me
Gave you my heart to keep
You made nothing for me
You make nothing for me
