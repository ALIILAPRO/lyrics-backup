		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't get my shit together
I take pills, I don't get better
Coming down under the pressure
Maybe I'm just not that clever
I am just an organism
Stuck inside the mechanism
I can't trust my intuition, it's been lost to pessimism

I'm not fine
Lost my damn mind
Gone all wrong, right
I'm not fine (no)
I'm not fine
Lost my damn mind
Gone all wrong, right (ha)

I get up, I go out
See my friends, blend in with the crowd
Smile and wave, swirling 'round
Like I've got it all figured out
But

I can't get my shit together
I take pills, I don't get better
Coming down under the pressure
Maybe I'm just not that clever
I can't get my shit together
I take pills, I don't get better
Lost my mind, but, uh, whatever
I can't get my shit together

Nobody knows my secret
My life's in total disarray
I can't seem to find the pieces
To put it back together again

I get up, I go out
See my friends, blend in with the crowd
Smile and wave, swirling 'round
Like I've got it all figured out
But

I can't get my shit together
I take pills, I don't get better
Coming down under the pressure
Maybe I'm just not that clever
I can't get my shit together
I take pills, I don't get better
Lost my mind, but, uh, whatever
I can't get my shit together

I'm not fine
Lost my damn mind
Gone all wrong, right (ha)
I'm not fine (no)
I'm not fine
Lost my damn mind
Gone all wrong, right (ha)

I can't get my shit together
I take pills, I don't get better
Coming down under the pressure
Maybe I'm just not that clever
I can't get my shit together
I take pills, I don't get better
Lost my mind, but, uh, whatever
I can't get my shit together

I can't get my shit together
I take pills, I don't get better
Coming down under the pressure
Maybe I'm just not that clever
I can't get my shit together
I take pills, I don't get better
Lost my mind, but, uh, whatever
I can't get my shit together
