		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were meant to be the one who always cares
You're supposed to call when no one's there
You were meant to say I love you at the end
Always my friend
You were meant to be the one to say I do
After something old and something blue
All I borrowed was my time with you
There's nothing new

And if you're gonna let me down
Let me down a little more gentle, darling
'Cause it's killing me now, killing me now
I'm not the one who gets to call you darling

So, where are you now? Where did you go?
'Cause I gave forever
When you took whatever you needed the most
And I poured my love out while you tore my heart apart
And that was the easiest part
I know the tables have turned
But I'll still never learn
That you don't deserve me
And if you really loved me
It would hurt when you'd hurt me

I always thought that you would be the one
When they ask me who's the one to blame
For trading all my talent in for love instead of fame
So, even if I reach beyond my peers
It's loss if you're no longer near
It's worthless without you here, my dear

If you're gonna let me down
Let me down a little more gentle, darling
'Cause it's killing me now, killing me now
I'm not the one who gets to call you darling

So, where are you now? And where did you go?
'Cause I gave forever
And you took whatever you needed the most
And I poured my love out while you tore my heart apart
And that was the easiest part
I know the tables have turned
But I'd still never learn
That you don't deserve me
And if you really loved me
It would hurt when you'd hurt me

You don't deserve me
'Cause if you really loved me
It would hurt when you hurt me
