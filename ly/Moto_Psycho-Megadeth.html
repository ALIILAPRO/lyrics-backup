		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Responsibility, an anchor around my neck
Dependability, made me a nervous wreck
Accountability, I live from check to check
Volatility, neglect and no respect

Got my wheels in motion and I got a path to beat
I hit the road to I don't know and look for Tough Shit Street

One-way ticket nowhere there's no windows on this train
Can't see where I'm headed but I'm going there again

Moto Psycho (going nowhere)
Everybody is a
Moto Psycho move it or lose it baby
Moto Psycho (going nowhere)
100 Miles an hour
Moto Psycho I'm a Moto Psycho
Moto Psycho

You know you can't resist to tell me what I mean
You gave my mind a twist said that I was unclean
The actor runs the play and ad-libs in between
You're all that I resent my thoughts were so obscene

Got my wheels in motion and I got a path to beat
I hit the road to I don't know and look for Tough Shit Street

One-way ticket nowhere there's no windows on this train
Can't see where I'm headed but I'm going there again

Moto Psycho (going nowhere)
Everybody is a
Moto Psycho move it or lose it baby
Moto Psycho (going nowhere)
100 Miles an hour
Moto Psycho I'm a Moto Psycho

One-way ticket nowhere there's no windows on this train
Can't see where I'm headed but I'm going there again

Moto Psycho (going nowhere)
Everybody is a
Moto Psycho
Moto Psycho (going nowhere)
Move it or lose it baby
Moto Psycho

Where I'm headed I don't know
But I'm shoving off and I hit the road
Moto Psycho (going nowhere)
Im a Moto Psycho
Moto Psycho (Im going nowhere)
Moto Psycho (going nowhere)
