		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No I can't forget this evening or your face as you were leaving,
But I guess that's just the way the story goes,
You always smile, but in your eyes,
Your sorrow shows,
Yes, it shows

No, I can't forget tomorrow,
When I think of all my sorrow,
Well I had you there and then I let you go,
And now it's only fair that I should let you know,
What you should know

I can't live,
If living is without you,
I can't live,
I can't give anymore,
I can't live,
If living is without you,
I can't live,
I can't give anymore

No, I can't forget this evening or your face as you were leaving,
But I guess that's just the way the story goes,
You always smile, but in your eyes,
Your sorrow shows,
Yes, it shows,

I can't live,
If living is without you,
I can't live,
I can't give anymore,
I can't live,
If living is without you,
I can't live,
I can't give anymore
