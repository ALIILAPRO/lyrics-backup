		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Dream, this shit go dummy) yeah
(Uno, I killed it)

She said I'm bringin' you to my playhouse
She invite me to her playhouse
I think I might blow my brains out
It's so hard to find my way out (Yeah)
We gon' pull up, masquerade it (Let's go)
No faces, no cases (Yeah)
As we take a trip to the Matrix (Shh)
We start changin' faces (Yeah)

She heard about it, word of mouth
Now she beggin' me to get in her mouth
But all this water on me, feel like Nemo
Can't watch, she fucked more than ten people
(Dream, this shit go dummy)
She want me to fuck her from the back, yeah
(Yeah)
Pull at her and choke her Elliot, yeah
Dolla $ign back with with UnoTheAct, yeah
(Yeah)
'Til I make a billi', I can't relax, yeah
(Relax, yeah) still puttin' up plaques
Puttin' up plaques, yeah
(Yeah) still break her whole back
Break her whole back, yeah
She say she in love with my fashion (Fashion)
I think she in love with my status
(Uno, I killed it, haha)

She said I'm bringin' you to my playhouse
She invite me to her playhouse
I think I might blow my brains out
It's so hard to find my way out (Yeah)
We gon' pull up, masquerade it (Let's go)
No faces, no cases (Yeah)
As we take a trip to the Matrix (Shh)
We start changin' faces (Yeah)

I just bought these chains on places
I just bought these chains on places
I just bought these chains on places
Came along from being basic (Yeah)
I got it (haha) , I got it (What?)
I got everything you want, I got it (What?)
I got everything you need, I got it
(Swear, yeah)
As we goin' to finish the time, what a time
Perfect timing i see all the signs that
It's time to unwind it
We gon' run around all the city
Took the time just to find it (Psh)
Said she's tryna find me but
I'm not too far behind, yeah
It's like "Boom" we go right
In love, on this room, we fell in love
It's the love right out my window
I see you from above
I just can't believe my eyes
All these thoughts goin' through my mind

She said I'm bringin' you to my playhouse
She invite me to her playhouse
I think I might blow my brains out
It's so hard to find my way out (Yeah)
We gon' pull up, masquerade it (Let's go)
No faces, no cases (Yeah)
As we take a trip to the Matrix (Shh)
We start changin' faces (Yeah)
