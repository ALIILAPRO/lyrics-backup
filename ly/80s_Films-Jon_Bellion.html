		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just like the 80s films
We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive
Just like the 80s films
We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive

She said, "How does it feel to be you?"
I said, "It's alright, I really think I peaked in high school"
She said, "That isn't possible, you are out of your mind
'Cause we never hooked up in high school"

We just need a night like
We just need a night like this, yeah
Take me back to ninth grade
Take me back to ninth grade shit, yeah

Just like the 80s films
We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive
Just like the 80s films
We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive

She said, "How'd we end up in the parking lot in Smithtown?"
The morning's on its way to sunrise
She said, "The island is long, but life is short in this town
I'm glad we got to redo the time"

We just need a night like
We just need a night like this, yeah
Take me back to ninth grade
Take me back to ninth grade shit, yeah
And just like the 80s films
We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive

Just like the 80s films
We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive
Just like the 80s films
We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive

I can't let go and your lips feel retro
You're my Breakfast Club
You're my song from Cyndi Lauper
No more missed times, we fly by street signs
Let your hips rewind
Take me back into the future, yeah

Just like the 80s films
We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive
Just like the 80s films
We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive
