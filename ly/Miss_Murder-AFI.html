		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey (hey), Miss Murder, can I
Hey (hey), Miss Murder, can I
Make (hey) beauty stay if I
Take my life? Oh

With just a look, they shook
And heavens bowed before him
Simply a look can break your heart

The stars that pierced the sky
He left them all behind
We're left to wonder why
He left us all behind

Hey (hey), Miss Murder, can I
Hey (hey), Miss Murder, can I
Make (hey) beauty stay if I
Take my life? Oh

Oh

Dreams of his crash won't pass
Oh, how they all adored him
Beauty will last when spiralled down

The stars that mystified
He left them all behind
And how his children cried
"He left us all behind"

Hey (hey), Miss Murder, can I
Hey (hey), Miss Murder, can I
Make (hey) beauty stay if I
Take my life? Oh

What's the hook, the twist within this furthest mystery?
I would gladly bet my life upon it
That the ghost you love, your ray of light will fizzle out
Without hope
We're the empty set just flowing through our empty skin
Ever-searching for what we were promised
Reaching for the golden ring, we never let go
Who would ever let us put our filthy hands upon it?

Hey (hey), Miss Murder, can I
Hey (hey), Miss Murder, can I
Make (hey) beauty stay if I
Take my life? Oh

Hey (hey), Miss Murder, can I
Hey (hey), Miss Murder, can I
Make (hey) beauty stay if I
Take my life? Oh
