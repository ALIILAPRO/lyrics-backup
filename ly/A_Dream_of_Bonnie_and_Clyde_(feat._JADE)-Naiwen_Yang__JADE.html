		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna do
Wanna do
Wanna do
Wanna do
I wanna do things others won't dabble

What if you
What if you
So what if you
What if you too
What if you too become enabled

So what if you're mine and what if we coupled
So two of one kind and everything's doubled
So what if we go a little insane
So what if we make a little bit of trouble

We've got it made
We've got it made
We've got it made
We've got it made

I wanna do
Wanna do
Wanna do
Wanna do
I wanna do things others won't dabble

What if you
What if you
So what if you
What if you too
What if you too become enabled

So what if you're mine and what if we coupled
So two of one kind and everything's doubled
So what if we go a little insane
So what if we make a little bit of trouble 

We've got it made
We've got it made
We've got it made
We've got it made

So what if you're mine and what if we coupled
So two of one kind and everything's doubled
So what if we go a little insane
So what if we make a whole lot of trouble

We've got it made
