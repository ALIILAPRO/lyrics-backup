		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I sat up on the stage 
Where the audience was paid
To watch the reel in overnight 

I didn't have a clue 
What for the others trying to do
Now I keep stealing for a light 

So why do you make me say alright
Why do you make me say 

I'm walking through the rain
Since they keep dealing with my pain
I lift my head up to the sky 

The homy was a message
Girl it seems that they care less
About the holes I've gotta climb 

So why do you make me say alright
Why do you make me say
Your right away (right away)
Make me run wild
Make me run 

Down at the club
Where the average man goes 
He doesn't ask much for his money
His going to work well his going to be late
He curses his luck its not funny 

Why do you make me say alright
Why do you make me say
