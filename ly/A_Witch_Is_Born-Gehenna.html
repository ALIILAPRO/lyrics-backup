		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In a crooked house as old as the forest
A child was born in fire

Her hellish voice, her furious screams
In my crystal that night I could hear

Ten thousand childrean: The dau she was born
Suffered and died in their crypts

A witch is born

With eyes of lightning, raven black hair
She was a beauty

She came here to rule us all
With her cruelty

I admire her beauty, and
The madness that she brings
Singing in awe
Hail o new born witch

A witch is born
