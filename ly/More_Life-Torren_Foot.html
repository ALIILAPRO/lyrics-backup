		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  More life, more life
More life, more life

I don't need you
'Cause I got more life
And I got more wave
Yeah, I'm on that hype
I don't need you
'Cause I got more life
On my paper chase
Yeah, I'm on that hype

Uh, made it out the block like Jenga
I've been on a three-day bender
Ask Israel, I'm a style bender
Southsider, not an Eastender
Tinie, I scratch that Tempah
Bet I make a gyal scream like Benga
Uh, big back like Br3nya
Air BnB off of Cahuenga (woo)
Push, look at them looks
Would if I could
Jugg, jugg we good in our hood
Heart jumping, getting me shook
Money like YMCMB
Them man ain't from the E-N-D
Breaking news like the BBC
Off my head, you know you need me

I don't need you
'Cause I got more life
And I got more wave
Yeah, I'm on that hype
I don't need you
'Cause I got more life
On my paper chase
Yeah, I'm on that hype

Wanna get faded
Bad and she dangerous
I just took a hiatus
Back from the worldwide mania
From rain to the palm trees again
Flexing, we ain't tryna party with them
Where the fuck is my car key again?
So lit, I'm on ten, ten, ten

Ayy, all my cars opaque
Haha, I'm just bait
Man know that the city ain't safe
CCTV, everything tape
Them man still outta shape
Still going 'til the very next day
Yo, I just see a rapper in a Wraith
Now everybody lit in the UK
K-K-K-K
K-K-K-K
K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K
K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K

I don't need you
I don't need you
'Cause I got more life
And I got more wave
Yeah, I'm on that hype
I don't need you
'Cause I got more life
On my paper chase
Yeah, I'm on that hype, woo

Whoa
Whoa
More life (more life, more life, more life)
I don't need you
Yeah, yeah, uh, uh (more life)
