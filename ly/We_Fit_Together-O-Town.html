		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been waiting for the stars to come out
Dinner it was fine,
But I can't lie 'cause I've been waiting for ya
To come back to mine,
I've been, thinking of you 24/7, and 365
Now the girl for me Impanema
She's here right by my side

I got you now and I just want to
Show you how to play
Goosebumps on your body
Guide the way

(Chorus)
I want to go all night
Ain't no stoppin' 'til the breakin' of the dawn
I want to go inside every corner
Girl you really turn me on
I want to go
Knock knock
Our bodies to the beat
And when the morning comes
We're letting the sun shine
We'll stay in bed
You can't separate us
We fit together

I can feel you comin' closer
Dancin' in the dark (dancin' in the dark)
I touch your lips and kiss your shoulders
Send a letter to your heart
I can't explain to which extreme I'm feelin' you (feelin' you)
How many triple x dreams that's been starring you

I got you now and I just want to
Show you how to play
Goosebumps on your body
Guide the way

(Chorus)

I won't get nothing done of what I ought'a do,
It doesn't really matter to me
I-I-I-I am here with you
I can't explain to what degree I'm feelin' you
How many triple x dreams I've had starring you

But I got you now and I just want to show you how to play (show you how to play)
Goosebumps on your body
Guide the way

I want to go all night,
Ain't no stoppin' 'til the breakin' of the dawn (breakin' of the dawn),
I want to go inside every corner (every corner baby),
Girl you really turn me on
I want to go knock knock
Our bodies to the beat (knock knock to the beat)
And when the morning comes
We're letting the sun shine
Stay in bed,
You can't separate us
We fit together
I want to go all night
Ain't no stoppin' 'til the breakin' of the dawn
(There ain't no stopping 'til the breakin' of the dawn)
I want to go inside every corner (every corner every corner baby)
Girl you really turn me on
I want to go knock knock
Our bodies to the beat
And when the morning comes (when the morning comes)
We're letting the sun shine
Stay in bed
You can't separate us
We fit together

All night
I want to go all night
Can I go inside
How about inside
I want to go all night
Can I go all night
What about inside
Can I go inside
