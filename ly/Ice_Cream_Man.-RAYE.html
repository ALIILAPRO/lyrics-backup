		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So, this producer hit me up on the DM
He told me, "Hey, I really like what you are doing"
He told me, "Come 'round to the studio, let's cook it"
He told me, "Come to catch a vibe and make some music"

But when I got there, should've heard what he was saying
Tryna touch me, tryna fuck me, I'm not playing
I should have left that place as soon as I walked in it
How goddamn dare you do that to me, really?

Coming like the ice cream man
'Til I felt his ice-cold hands
And how I pay the price now, damn
Goddamn, no, what the? Goddamn
Everything you did, it left me in a ruin
And, no, I didn't say a word
I guess that proves it
I'm a woman, oh, yes

'Cause I'm a woman
I'm a very fucking brave strong woman
And I'll be damned if I let a man ruin
How I walk, how I talk, how I do it
Man, I've been broken for a moment
I've been through it, no
It's even harder to be brave alone
Was a girl, now I'm grown
I'm a woman
A very fucking strong woman

And I was seven
Was twenty-one, was seventeen and was eleven
It took a while to understand what my consent means
If I was ruthless, they'd be in the penitentiary
But all the stress of being honest wouldn't help me
I pushed it down but it was living in me rent-free
And then I fell into some things that were unhealthy
A place where no one heard me, asking them to help me

Coming like the ice cream man
'Til I felt his ice-cold hands
And how I pay the price now, damn
Goddamn
Everything you did, it left me in a ruin
And no, I didn't say a word
I guess that proves it
I'm a woman

'Cause I'm a woman
I'm a very fucking brave strong woman
And I'll be damned if I let a man ruin
How I walk, how I talk, how I do it
Man, I've been broken for a moment
I've been through it, no
It's even harder to be brave alone
I was a girl, now I'm grown
I'm a woman
A very fucking strong woman, mm

I wish I could say how I feel
How I felt and explain why
I'm silently blaming myself
'Cause I put on these faces pretending I'm fine
Then I go to the bathroom
And I press "rewind" in my head
Always going 'round and 'round in my head
Your fingerprints stuck a stain on my skin
You made me frame myself for your sin
You pathetic, dead excuse of a man

Ooh, ooh
Oh, I'm a brave strong woman, oh, yeah
Yeah
Oh

And I'll be damned if I let a man ruin, oh
I'm a very fucking brave strong woman, yeah
