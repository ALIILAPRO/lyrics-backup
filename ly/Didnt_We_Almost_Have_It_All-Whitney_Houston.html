		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember when we held on in the rain
The night we almost lost it
Once again we can take the night into tomorrow
Living on feelings
Touching you I feel it all again

[Chorus]
Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving?
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
Didn't we almost have it all
The night we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all

The way you used to touch me felt so fine
We kept our hearts together down the line 
A moment in the soul can last forever
Comfort and keep us
Help me bring the feeling back again

[Chorus]

Didn't we have the beat of times
When love was young and new? 
Couldn't we reach inside and find
The world of me and you?
We'll never lose it again
Cause once you know what love is 
You never let it end

[Chorus]
