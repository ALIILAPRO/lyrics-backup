		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I was 13 I had a sister for 6 months
She arrived one February morning
Pale and shellshocked
From past lives I could not imagine
She was 3 years older than me
But in no time we became friends
We'd listen to her mixtapes
Dead Can Dance, Felt, This Mortal Coil
She introduced me to her favorite books
Gave me clothes
And my first cigarette

Sometimes
We would head down to Blackbirds Moor
To watch the barges on Grand Union in the twilight
She said "the water has no memory"

For a few months everything about our lives was perfect
It was only us
We were inseparable

But gradually
She passed into another distant part of my memory
Until I could no longer remember her face
Her voice
Even her name

We've got
We've got the perfect life
We've got
We've got the perfect life
We've got
We've got the perfect life
We've got (we've got)
We've got the perfect life
We've got (we've got)
We've got the perfect life
We've got (we've got)
We've got the perfect life
We've got (we've got)
We've got the perfect life
We've got (we've got)
We've got the perfect life
