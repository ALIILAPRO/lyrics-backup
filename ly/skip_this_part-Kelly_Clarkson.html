		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can I skip this part
When I fall to pieces
Back here at start
Need a time machine then

If I could escape all this hurt and this pain, oh, I would
What it's gonna take to get me through this break is no good

I'd like to skip this part
Cuts you so deep when it feels like the end
I'm not sure how much more I can take of these waves crashin' in
I'd like to skip this part
No need for Ferris wheel memories to tend
I'm real good at forgiving, but my heart can't forget the ache before the mend

I'd like to skip this part, ooh
I'd like to skip this part, ooh

Are you happy now?
Will you ever be?
And it's all over town
Why did she leave him?

If I could escape all this gossip and shame, oh, I would
What it's gonna take to get me through this break is no good

I'd like to skip this part
Cuts you so deep when it feels like the end
I'm not sure how much more I can take of these waves crashin' in
I'd like to skip this part
No need for Ferris wheel memories to tend
I'm real good at forgiving, but my heart can't forget the ache before the mend

I'd like to skip this part
(Cuts you so deep when it feels, oh, it feels like the end)
I'd like to skip this part
(I'm good at forgiving, but I can't forget)

I feel every break as I realize my fate
I succumb to the taste of betrayal
I try numbing the pain with my sweet Mary Jane
But I know this escape isn't stable (I'd like to skip this part)
I'd like to skip, I'd like to skip
I'd like to skip this part (I'd like to skip this part)
I'd like to skip, I'd like to skip
I'd like to skip this part
