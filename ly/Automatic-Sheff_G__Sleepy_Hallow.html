		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hoover, Hoover Gang
Shooter, Shooter, that Shooter Gang
Hoover, Hoover Gang
Shooter, Shooter, that Shooter Gang
(Great John on the beat, by the way)

We slide on blocks, we'll leave it in park, look, we balling no parks, huh
Push engine to start, ain't no evidence when it sparks
Brllt, look, brllt di blat, couple 'ol guns is useful, intact
I done seen fights to backing out straps, couple lil' snakes I thought had my back
'Til I gotta shoot that boy he flinching, spotted them routes he looks suspicious
Look, shit he clinching, ambulance speed that boy to the clinic
Tell 'em bring, paramedics, acrobatics, cinematic hungry hoes with you
Niggas try shooting at us, clapping at us, niggas know that Shooter Gang hit you
Pockets obese, real damage, ain't much love I got in these streets nigga
But I'm street nigga, that's his man, Sleepy hit his ass have him sleep quicker
He deceased with him, tote no straps don't hang around me, stand around me
Look, can't split no cash, no lick around me, stain around me, gang around me
Chillin', only my bitch arouse me, silly
I've done been drilling around these buildings, praying to my God I know he forgiving
Look, more havoc, wanted to taste, bring more addicts
Keep a closed mouth that's smooth traffic, hop in that car that's few 'matics

Hoover, Hoover Gang
Shooter, Shooter, that Shooter Gang

If you ask me, please don't ask me, uh
When it come to bitches, like my shorty super nasty
But if we talking chops, uh, I love 40 Glocks
If we talking blocks, we done spinned a lot, uh
If you talking opps, simple, make your niggas pop, pimple
You ain't sending shots, look, you just send a threat
But we can make a bet, 100K gang get your whole set
It ain't nuttin' less, next, smoking what I stretch
Shooter gang got food on niggas necks
Who the gang got niggas tryna flex
We the gang got bitches tryna sex
I ain't really worried 'bout a bitch, big bro told me worry 'bout a check
Disrespect then you valid for a death
Naw, he ain't no big dog, I swear that man is a rat
He try running we shooting his kicks off, when he trip he get hit with that braat
Wanna know where I got all of this sauce, I just say I do this and do that
Any minute I want niggas clipped off, I can pull up with Sheff and attack, Sheff and attack
