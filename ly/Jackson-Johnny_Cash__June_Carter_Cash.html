		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout
We've been talkin' 'bout Jackson, ever since the fire went out
I'm goin' to Jackson, I'm gonna mess around
Yeah, I'm goin' to Jackson
Look out Jackson town

Well, go on down to Jackson, go ahead and wreck your health
Go play your hand you big-talkin' man and make a big fool of yourself
Yeah, go to Jackson, go comb your hair
Honey, I'm gonna snowball Jackson
See if I care

When I breeze into that city, people gonna stoop and bow (ha)
All them women gonna make me teach 'em what they don't know how
I'm goin' to Jackson, you turn-a loose-a my coat
'Cause I'm goin' to Jackson
Goodbye, that's all she wrote

But they'll laugh at you in Jackson and I'll be dancin' on a Pony Keg
They'll lead you 'round town like the scalded hound
With your tail tucked between your legs
Yeah, go to Jackson, you big-talkin' man
And I'll be waitin' in Jackson, behind my Jaypan fan

Well now, we got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper Sprout
We've been talkin' 'bout Jackson, ever since the fire went out
I'm goin' to Jackson and that's a fact
Yeah, we're goin' to Jackson, ain't never comin' back

Well, we got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout
Honey we've been talkin' 'bout Jackson
