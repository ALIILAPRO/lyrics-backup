		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I lay next to myself, breathing slow
Car crash in rewind
"There's nothing you could have done", said a soft voice
"Calm down, you will survive"
Leave me out of my mind, sedated
Bitter and blurry-eyed
Please don't look me in my face when I'm wasted
You know you can't relate

And the world got a little more dim tonight (whoa-oh-oh)
The world got a little more dim tonight (whoa-oh-oh)
Though you had to go, I won't forget your light
The world got a little more dim tonight (whoa-oh-oh)

Days come just like our friends with the soft glow
The one touch that slowly fades
You're just out of my reach, oh, in the shadows
Still young but weathered grey

And the world got a little more dim tonight (whoa-oh-oh)
The world got a little more dim tonight (whoa-oh-oh)
Though you had to go, I won't forget your light
The world got a little more dim tonight (whoa-oh-oh)

I will protect your light
I will protect your light

Lay down with me tonight, breathing slow
Back in your driveway
Rest now, kiss me goodbye in the morning
I'm with you always

And the world got a little more dim tonight
The world got a little more dim tonight
