		  Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo, doo, doo, ah
Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo, doo, doo, ah
Doo-bee-doo-bee

Where do I begin?
I'm sittin' here jaded
Yeah, I fell asleep with the makeup still on my skin
Wide awake again
I'm prayin' I make it
I step in the 12 but it's somewhere I've already been

Diamonds won't fool me 'cause I'm too far gone
Wish I could get back the air in my lungs
I've been so fucked up, it's bad for my heart
My heart

So
No more I love you's
It's too easy to say, yeah
No more I loves you's
Until I'm okay, yeah
I blamed it on the time zones
I blamed it on my eyes closed
I blamed it on the world like it owes me
So stop me before it's too late
No more I love you's
Until I'm okay

Oh, I faced my sins
And I wish it was easy
Now I fall asleep with the light on but still without you
So I'll make amends
And I buy myself flowers
And then when they die, I'll be happy that they got me through

Diamonds won't fool me 'cause I'm too far gone
Wish I could get back the air in my lungs
I've been so fucked up, it's bad for my heart
My heart

So
No more I love you's
It's too easy to say, yeah
No more I loves you's
Until I'm okay, yeah
I blamed it on the time zones
I blamed it on my eyes closed
I blamed it on the world like it owes me
So stop me before it's too late
No more I love you's
Until I'm okay

It's not on my lips and I love it
No weight on my chest, I'm above it
I'm takin' a moment to cut it out (oh)
I feel my conscience is callin'
Now there's no fear, no more runnin'
I don't want words that mean nothin', no

Oh, no more I love you's (no, no more I love you's)
It's too easy to say, yeah (know it's too easy to say)
No more I loves you's (no)
Until I'm okay (until I'm okay)
I blamed it on the time zones (oh)
I blamed it on my eyes closed (eyes closed)
I blamed it on the world like it owes me
So stop me before it's too late
No more I love you's (ooh, oh, no)
Until I'm okay (until I'm okay)
