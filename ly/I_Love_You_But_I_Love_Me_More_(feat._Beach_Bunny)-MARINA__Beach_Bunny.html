		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love you, but I love me more
Don't come back knocking at my door
You've had your chance and now you want more
You say you'll ch-change, you say you'll transform

Do you expect me to believe that you've changed
When I can tell that you're exactly the same?
You'd rather shut your eyes than feel any pain
Told myself I can't go back ever again (oh-oh-oh-oh)

You try to tell me that we're so deep in love
Well, if we were, then why did we fuck it up? (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Told you before that love isn't enough
Come on, baby, I can call your bluff

I love you, but I love me more
Don't come back knocking at my door
You've had your chance and now you want more
You say you'll ch-change, you say you'll transform

Sometimes I felt I was a part of your plan
You're holding me while holding somebody else's hand
I thought we were eternal, I try and hit restart
I watch you take and take and take until I fell apart (oh, oh-oh)
You made me think there was a problem with me (oh, oh-oh)
I gave you my heart, you gave me anxiety
I'ma vision, I don't need you to see
That everything I needed was inside of me

I love you, but I love me more
Don't come back knocking at my door
You've had your chance and now you want more
You say you'll ch-change, you say you'll transform

Don't come back knocking at my door
You say you'll ch-change, you say you'll transform

Are you worth the risk? I just can't make up my mind
I've been choosing your heart, your heart over mine
I don't understand how you missed all the signs, signs

I love you, but I love me more
Don't come back knocking at my door
You've had your chance and now you want more
You say you'll ch-change, you say you'll transform

I love you, but I love me more
Don't come back knocking at my door
You've had your chance and now you want more
You say you'll ch-change, you say you'll transform
Mm, mm-hmm, mm, mm-hmm (ooh-ooh-ooh)
