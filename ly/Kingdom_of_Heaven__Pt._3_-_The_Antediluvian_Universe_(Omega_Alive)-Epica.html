		  I. Ātman

Oceani nos guttulae
Spiritus omnium viventium
Miscere cum universo

II. Sri Yantra

Rise and shine with all your light
Awake the force within you
Wade in waters filled with joy
Try to find the place that hides
The treasure in the palace
All the stars are by your side

This bright light
Does shine from within you
Inside
Life does thrive and those that ridicule never know

Just as water turns to snow
What is above so is below
In time we learn to heal the cells
We can cure ourselves
Use this healing energy
Form a holy trinity
This is the knowledge that we have been searching for

The barriers will fall
Rise to heights
Those who seek will know
All shadows will flee, go with the flow of life
Those who seek will see
Endlessly

Balance and harmony
As above so below

Wise do search as fools emerge
Don’t fear the ones that judge you
All you find they will deny
Trust your heart as it’s the way
Refine the finest diamond
Look inside you are divine

This bright light
Does shine from within you
Inside
Life does thrive and those that ridicule never know

Just as water turns to snow
What is above so is below
In time we learn to heal the cells
We can cure ourselves
Use this healing energy
Form a holy trinity
This is the knowledge that we have been searching for

III. Halls of Amenti

Deep within the heart of Earth lie
Veiled for men, the Halls of Amenti

IV. Duality

We all are divided by space-time
Our duality
We all fall apart in this lifetime
Together we stand strong
Together we are one

Wherever we will go

Energy does flow

We all are united by nature
Our coherency
We all are a part of each other
Together we stand strong
Together we are one

V. The Chikhai Bardo ~ Navigating the Afterlife Realms

As we linger towards our final breath
Forge yourself, be ready for the moment of your death

I collide

Darkness dies in light
Embrace your final breath
Navigate beyond your death

VI. The Flower of Life ~ The Cosmic Spiral

Rise, perceive and do believe
That wisdom lies within you
All what’s lost can be retrieved

This bright light
Does shine from within you
Inside
Life does thrive and those that ridicule never know

Just as water turns to snow
What is above so is below
In time we learn to heal the cells
We can cure ourselves
Use this healing energy
Form a holy trinity
This is the knowledge that we have been searching for

The barriers will fall

May thy kingdom come
