		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm livin' in a dead man's shoes
Stolen coat, not much hope with these cardiac blues
And I keep forgetting I'm not a god like you
Trivialize a mirror image alive, I won't trouble you, I'm just double
But now, now, now, now, now
(We don't have to leave it alone)
(We don't even have to be alone)
(We just have to think we're alone)
(So everybody leaves us alone)

I don't serve my time, 'cause time don't tell
The grimace behind me, I'm always aligned with my selves
(Come and lead me on)
(Come and see me on)
(Come and feed me on)
(The shit we all be on)

I'm not a god like you
I'm not a god like you, yeah

I'm runnin' in a dead man's shoes
Sacrilege and broken cartilage
I'm beaten and bruised
And I keep forgetting to forget
(The back is always front)
(The way is always shut)
(The one is always two)
I'm not a god
(The back is always front)
(The way is always shut)
(The one is always two)
I'm not a god like you

I'm livin' in a dead man's shoes
I'm livin' in a dead man's shoes
