		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Slip em up falling over drop em with a Sambo slam
Jumping from the cage beat em up like it's Dagestan
Don't have time to explain if you don't understand
Slaying with my verses spitting fire like I'm Killa Cam
I make money to talk shit air out of my diaphragm
Do what I want fuck an opinion don't give a damn
Slip em up falling over drop em with a Sambo slam
Jumping from the cage beat em up like it's Dagestan
Don't have time to explain if you don't understand
Slaying with my verses spitting fire like I'm Killa Cam
I make money to talk shit air out of my diaphragm
Do what I want fuck an opinion don't give a damn
