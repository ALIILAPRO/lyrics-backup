		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The lights go out, the music is fading
I haven't danced at all tonight
Holding up the wall
I've never tried
But if you ask me to I might

Too many roads leading out of here
Too many reasons we're way overdue
Show me a road leading nowhere
And I will walk it with you

Without a word you caught up with me
Where do we go from here tonight

I can't recall the last time I cried
But if you touch me now I might

Too many roads leading out of here
Too many reasons we're way overdue
Show me a road leading nowhere
And I will walk it with you

The stars go out
The night fading
Where do we go from here
