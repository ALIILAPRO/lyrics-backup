		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were damn good
At putting bandaids over bullet holes
Mister sweet talk
Mister I'm not doing anything wrong

Don't matter if somebody got a diamond ring
And he's bending on a knee to say the perfect thing
I don't need another man to promise everything
I can't trust anyone

You made me hate love
You're the devil haunting my angel
Boy, you put the pain in painful
Never wanna love again (wanna love again)
You made me hate love
Now I know I'd rather be strangers
Boy, you put the ache in heartbreaker
Never want to love again

You said crying every night was, it was real true love
And if you give your heart to someone
That's what falling does

Don't matter if somebody got a diamond ring
And he's bending on a knee to say the perfect thing
I don't need another man to promise everything
I can't trust anyone

You made me hate love
You're the devil haunting my angel
Boy, you put the pain in painful
Never wanna love again (wanna love again)
You made me hate love
Now I know I'd rather be strangers
Boy, you put the ache in heartbreaker
Never want to love again

Ooh-ooh
Never wanna love again
Ooh-ooh
Never wanna love again

You made me hate love
You're the devil haunting my angel
Boy, you put the pain in painful
Never wanna love again (never wanna love again)
You made me hate, what?
You made me hate love
Now I know I'd rather be strangers
Boy, you put the ache in heartbreaker
Never wanna love again (never wanna love again)

Ooh-ooh
Never wanna love again
Ooh-ooh
Never wanna love again

You made me
