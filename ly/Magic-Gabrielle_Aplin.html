		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember when we snuck out of your birthday
Didn’t even say goodbye
Cause even there in a room full of faces
All I saw was you and I
And our friends, no they don’t understand  Why we never seem to hold hands
You can tell that they think it’s pretty strange
That they’ve never seen us slow dance

But it’s who we are
You’re never going to catch us dancing in the dark
Cause I already know your heart

I know that you love me
Don’t need anyone to tell me
I can see it written on your face
And you know that I need you
Like I’m never gonna leave you
Have you ever seen me walk away

It’s all the words you never say
The way I catch you watching me
I know that you love me
Don’t need anyone to tell me
I can see it written on your face

I know, I know, I know, I know
I know you can feel the magic
We don’t need to talk about it
I know, I know, I know,I know
I know you can feel the magic

What’s the use trying to pick us apart
When it’s something that you can’t explain
Like the earth falling into the stars
Like a fire burning in the rain
No we don’t feel the need for colourful displays
Cause it’s not the kind of game we play
And why should we show the world how we feel when
It’s not about them anyway

It’s just who we are
You’re never going to catch us dancing in the dark
Cause I already know your heart

I know that you love me
Don’t need anyone to tell me
I can see it written on your face
And you know that I need you
Like I’m never gonna leave you
Have you ever seen me walk away

It’s all the words you never say
The way I catch you watching me
I know that you love me
Don’t need anyone to tell me
I can see it written on your face

I know, I know, I know, I know
I know you can feel the magic
We don’t need to talk about it
I know, I know, I know,I know
I know you can feel the magic

Don’t need to see it to believe it
No need to wake me up
Cause I’m not dreaming
And maybe there’s no hidden meaning
No need to wake me up
Cause I’m not dreaming
Don’t need to see it to believe it


I know that you love me
Don’t need anyone to tell me
I can see it written on your face
And you know that I need you
Like I’m never gonna leave you
Have you ever seen me walk away

It’s all the words you never say
The way I catch you watching me
I know that you love me
Don’t need anyone to tell me
I can see it written on your face

I know, I know, I know, I know
I know you can feel the magic
We don’t need to talk about it
I know, I know, I know,I know
I know you can feel the magic
