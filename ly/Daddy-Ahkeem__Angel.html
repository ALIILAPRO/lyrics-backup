		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That's daddy
You know you wanna call him daddy
That's daddy
(Kiss) They call him daddy

That's daddy
You know you wanna call him daddy
That's daddy
(Kiss) They call him daddy

Just in case you couldn’t tell I leave a permanent scar
After this won’t be a question bout if I go the hardest
Her last nigga moved foul and end up breaking her heart
If she show ya boy a picture then you know imma pop him
Everyday I get hotter
I swear this shit neva stop
She tell her friends about the stroke and now they all wanna watch
All this shit got lil shorty pussy wetter than water
I dropped that bag on they ass and I got the key to the box
Boy I’m self made
Ain’t shit fake
Neva stressing bout gun play
Loss me you’ll need a first aid
I only care about a bank statement
Dark skin that’s new bae
Now her girlfriends on da way
Bitches calling me daddy cause I’m working even on off days
And the sexy mamacitas wanna marry me
I’m a star you could put me on your Christmas tree
I set the bar all these other niggas under me
All these motherfuckers looking like some wannabes

That's daddy
You know you wanna call him daddy
That's daddy
(Kiss) They call him daddy

That's daddy
You know you wanna call him daddy
That's daddy
(Kiss) They call him daddy

You heard the name and it been that
Savannah nigga like 3 Stacks 
Big Boi but I’m Big Daddy
Having you thinking this a flashback
Raw shit ain’t no cap
She come hard back to back
Beat the pussy up every time
Got her screaming for a rematch
She want me
She on me
Without a nigga she relapse
She sucking me
She fucking me
I pull out and she stare at it 
Tall nigga I been packing
Main reason she so attached
If niggas talking that rah rah I’ll put a hole in his snapback
And lately I been dealing with the millionaires
Money on my line got me paying for her airfare
I can take you anywhere but imma take this errrwhere
I told her bring her friend and lick me up like it’s a double dare
Girl I’m tryna take it there
You already know
Niggas don’t want smoke dawg
They don’t want no smoke
Wilding on the internet but really they a joke
And imma always talk my shit I’m tryna leave this world the GOAT lil nigga
