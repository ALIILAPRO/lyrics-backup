		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  't was on the Isle of Capri that I found her 
Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree 
Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming round her 
Where we met on the Isle of Capri 

She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning 
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri 

Summertime was nearly over 
Blue Italian sky above 
I said "Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?" 

She whispered softly "It's best not to linger" 
And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger 
't was goodbye at the villa Capri 

Summertime was nearly over 
Blue Italian sky above 
I said "Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a fine word of love?" 

She whispered softly "It's best not to linger" 
And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a plain golden ring on her finger 
't was goodbye on the Isle of Capri
't was goodbye on the Isle of Capri
't was goodbye on the Isle of Capri
