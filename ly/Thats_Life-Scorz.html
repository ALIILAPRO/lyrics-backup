		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Compared to the vastness of outer space
We're no more than a dot on a canvas
A grain of sand in a stretch of desert
A single snowflake on a snow-capped mountain
But if you look closer
If you allow yourself to see
You’ll find the miracles in lives lived
The wonder in these tiny circles
We learn, we grow
We explore and discover
We make decisions in an attempt to be good
And try to make right for the things done wrong
We learn to love each other, learn to fight side by side
And try even harder to accept ourselves and the person we are
We then take our children by the hand
Help them learn and help them grow
Help them explore and discover
Only for the cycle to begin anew
That’s life
