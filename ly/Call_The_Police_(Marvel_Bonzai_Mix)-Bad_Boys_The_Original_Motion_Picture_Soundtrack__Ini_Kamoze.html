		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Calling all stars
Calling all stars

This is an emergency
There is a crucial jam at the corner of R & B
Proceed with caution
Suspects are musically armed and dangerous

Call the Police, Police, Police
I'm about to make a hit, yeah
Call the Police, Police, Police, Police

A heart is about to quit
Jump off ma stool outa ma corner
May I have the floor to say
I play the fool to catch the wiser
Now I've gotta motto that the guilty must P A Y

Call the Police, Police, Police
I'm about to make a hit, yeah
Call the Police, Police, Police, Police

A heart is about to quit
Don't single me out as the worst offender
My words and my actions are clear
We analyze like a computer
Set, set evil men conscience in fear

Call the Police, Police, Police
I'm about to make a hit, yeah
Call the Police, Police, Police, Police

A heart is about to quit
Jump off ma stool outa ma corner
May I have the floor to say
I play the fool to catch the wiser
Now I've gotta motto that the guilty must P A Y
