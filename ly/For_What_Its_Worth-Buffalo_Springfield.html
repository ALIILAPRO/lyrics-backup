		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's somethin' happenin' here
But what it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
A-tellin' me I got to beware

I think it's time we stop
Children, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down

There's battle lines being drawn
And nobody's right if everybody's wrong
Young people speakin' their minds
A-gettin' so much resistance from behind

I think it's time we stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down

What a field day for the heat (ooh-ooh-ooh)
A thousand people in the street (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Singin' songs and a-carryin' signs (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Mostly say, "Hooray for our side" (ooh-ooh-ooh)

It's time we stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down

Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life, it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
You step out of line
The man come and take you away

We better stop, hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down

We better stop, hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down

We better stop, now, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down

We better stop, children, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
