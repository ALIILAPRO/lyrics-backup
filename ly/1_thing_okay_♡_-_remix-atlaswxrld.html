		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't trip over 1 thing
Yea, I need my bands tall just like Yao Ming
And my ex just hit me up she said I'm charming
Shawty think that we in love but we just vibing

She didn't get the message
Okay let me get it clear on a double text
Homies hit me up they saying I got no respect
Even if we part ways I wish you all the best

Yea I'm on the block with a Bible and verses
I know a lot of people want me riding the hearses
People speaking on me, but say nothing in person
They talking hella cap like they an Amazon commercial

I'm teaching lessons like you're a student
Spreading hate is all against improvement
Y'all be faking all for my amusement, bruh If you don't like me you should start a movement hoe

It's this 1 thing that's got me tripping
It's this 1 thing that's got me tripping, you did
This 1 thing my soul may be feeling
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh
It's this 1 thing that caught me slipping
It's this 1 thing I want to admit it, you did
This 1 thing and I was so with it
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh

It's this 1 thing that's got me tripping
It's this 1 thing that's got me tripping, you did
This 1 thing my soul may be feeling
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh

One thing got her tripping
Yea, conversation had us clicking
Feel like GTA by the way I had her stripping
Said she wanna cuff
So I had to tell her
Na-na-na-na-na, hoe

I can't stress over hoes I'm cozy
I count cheques with my bros I'm cozy
Smiling to the bank cuz it shows I'm cozy
If she want me back, best believe I'm ghosting

But what you did, yeah
It's this 1 thing that's got me tripping
It's this 1 thing that's got me tripping, you did
This 1 thing my soul may be feeling
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh
It's this 1 thing that's caught me slipping
It's this 1 thing I want to admit it, you did
This 1 thing and I was so with it
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, it's just something
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, It's just, I don't know
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, This thing
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I don't wanna fight it

Na, na, na, na, na, oh
Na, na, na, na, na, oh
Na, na, na, na, na, oh
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, oh
Na, na, na, na, na, oh
Na, na, na, na, na, oh
Na, na, na, na, na
