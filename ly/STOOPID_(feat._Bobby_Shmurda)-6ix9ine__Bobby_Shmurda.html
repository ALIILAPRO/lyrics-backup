		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Y'all already know it be the boy Yung Gordon
And you rockin' with Take Money promotion
Ayy, Take Money Promotion
Give 'em that new shit, no fool shit
Oh yeah, let's go

DJ Lethal, Lethal (Rough Rider)
TMP 954, we live
Take Money Promotion
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up

Bitch, I'm silly
Up the chopper, shoot your shit up, let's get busy
Drinkin' Henny, goin' brazy, poppin' pillies
Sex Money Murda, shout out all my blazing Billies (all my Billies)
We in yo' city (We in yo'-)

Shout out my apes in the fuckin' zoo (Filayo)
Filayo, they gon' shoot
Spin a hoop, who the fuck is you?
Who the fuck you know, nigga? No, nigga
Niggas killed your cousin, you want smoke, nigga? (stupid)
Glo nigga, rollin' up your cousin in a blunt, nigga
Bozo, bitch are you dumb-d-dumb-dumb-dumb-d-dumb-dumb-dumb? (stupid)
Bitch, I'm Nick Cannon with this drum-dr-drum-drum-drum (brra-pum-pum)
Pull up with semis, no Lil Pump-pr-ump-pump-pumps (no esskeetit)
We goin' dumb-d-dumb-dumb-dumb-d-dumb-dumb-dumb
Bitch I'm stupid, bitch I'm dumb
I be tweakin', I be wildin', I be booted (bitch I be drunk)
I be stealin', I be robbin', I be lootin' (you don't wanna die)
Your boyfriend dumb, he get no money, bitch, he stupid
Oh, bitch, he, oh, bitch, he stupid
Damn, homie, in high school you was the man, homie (2012)
What the fuck happened to you? (stoopid)
I'm just sayin', homie
Now you smokin' Black & Milds, smokin' Reds, homie

Ah, ah, ah, what's up?
Shmurda on the motherfuckin' east side nigga
6ix9ine what's poppin' cuz?

Tell him shut up, suck a dick
Tell him fuck him, I'm the shit
Bitch, I'm drunk recording this
I'm getting money, I'm the shit
Shout out my Bloods, shout out my Crips
That nigga Ebro, he a bitch
Just another old nigga on a young nigga dick
Bitch I'm lit on the Gram, a million likes, you see my shit
Your bitch DM for the dick
But I probably wouldn't hit
VVS, Cuban hit
Shout out Jimmy for the drip
Your baby daddy mixtape wasn't shit, he a bitch
Free Bobby, free Rowdy, free Cueno, free the 9
Shout out Jay Dee, shout out Kooda, Dee Savv, those my guys
FOA they gon' ride, GS9 they gon' slide
When I woo, woo back, ah-ah-ahh, those my guys

She give me neck until I burst out
She give me teeth, she get cursed out
And all these suckers with they fucking feelings
Always got these bitches with they purse out
We on the block, put the bird out
I count bricks put the word out
You know you like a nigga Shmoney Dance
You gon' love a nigga when I swerve out

Bitch, I'm silly
Up the chopper, shoot your shit up, let's get busy
Drinkin' Henny, goin' brazy, poppin' pillies
Sex Money Murda, shout out all my blazing Billies (all my Billies)
We in yo' city

Hold up, hold up, hold up, gang
Run that shit back
