		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Call me a thief
There's been a robbery
I left with her heart
Tore it apart
Made no apologies

I've been living in the darkness
Shadows in my apartment, heartless
Taking love just to spill it on parchment
Next page and I'm out again
I've been living in the night life
Lips hit you like a drive by, frost bite
Ice cold, I mean they cut you like a sharp knife
Next page and I'm out again

Skin on my skin, what a wonderful sin
Take your breath but you're asking for more
The tip of my finger is tracing your figure
I say good night and walk out the door

Call me a thief
There's been a robbery
I left with her heart
Tore it apart
Made no apologies
Just call me a thief
She was on top of me
Then I left with her heart
Broken and scarred
Made no apologies

We can be so hollow
Like my rib cage, the echoes follow
Follow me like the fears I swallow
And drown in all my mistakes
All I know is if my skin bled
Like the ink dripped from my pen
My bed will be drenched in a scarlet rose red
And drown in all my mistakes

Skin on my skin, what a wonderful sin
Take your breath but you're asking for more
The tip of my finger is tracing your figure
I say good night and walk out the door

Call me a thief
There's been a robbery
I left with her heart
Tore it apart
Made no apologies
Just call me a thief
She was on top of me
Then I left with her heart
Broken and scarred
Made no apologies

Girl you better just lock me up
Because I've never been good for nothing
So you better just lock me up, lock me up
Girl you better just lock me up
Because I've never been good for nothing
So you better just lock me up, lock me up

The tip of my finger is tracing your figure
I say good night and walk out the door

Call me a thief
There's been a robbery
I left with her heart
Tore it apart
Made no apologies
Just call me a thief
She was on top of me
Then I left with her heart
Broken and scarred
Made no apologies

Girl you better just lock me up
Because I've never been good for nothing
So you better just lock me up, lock me up
Girl you better just lock me up
Because I've never been good for nothing
So you better just lock me up, lock me up
