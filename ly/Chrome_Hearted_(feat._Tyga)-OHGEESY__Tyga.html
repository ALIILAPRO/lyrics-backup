		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your bitch told me that I'm the hardest (I'm the hardest, nigga, ayy, ayy)

Bitch told me that I'm the hardest (I'm the hardest)
One K long sleeve tee, chrome hearted (Chrome hearted)
Finna paint her face like a nigga is a artist
Front flip in the pussy like a nigga Jeff Hardy
What, you think a nigga broke? We ain't sippin' no Bacardi
What, you think a nigga lackin'? We got pistols in the party
Eleven K, what I pay just to bust down the Carti's
All the hoes call me daddy like an episode of Martin

I want all the smoke like a nigga Bob Marley
She gon' hop up on the dick and then she ride it like a Harley
I be with gorillas like I live in a safari
I don't play no games, what I look like, I'm Atari?
Do I look like a Nintendo? Nigga, keep extendos
Hoppin' out of busses, we ain't shooting out no windows
Drop it down and bust it, baby, pop it like a pimple
Pull it out and bust it and I put it on her dimples
Ayy, pretty faced bitch, let a street nigga bust
I wanna hit it from the back, pull the tracks, gettin' rough on it
Fuck her more than once, but a nigga never cuff
And her head so good that a nigga put the buffs on it, ayy

Bitch told me that I'm the hardest (I'm the hardest)
One K long sleeve tee, chrome hearted (Chrome hearted)
Finna paint her face like a nigga is a artist
Front flip in the pussy like a nigga Jeff Hardy
What, you think a nigga broke? We ain't sippin' no Bacardi
What, you think a nigga lackin'? We got pistols in the party
Eleven K, what I pay just to bust down the Carti's
All the hoes call me daddy like an episode of Martin

Two fingers in the air like a nigga Jeff Hardy (hah, hah)
Shootin' up shots, had to clear out the party (bah)
Ahead of my class, I ain't never been tardy (nope)
Autograph the pussy and it's not with a sharpie (nope)
Nigga, I'm a shark out the water and I'm hunting (bah)
I been fucking hoes way back since Top-Ramen
Lil' bitch, she ain't nothing, she a runner, I don't want it
I'ma slide on her friend in the black six-hundred
I'ma fuck then I'm busting and back to the money
I need my respect and my jet on the runway
Bitch, run me my flowers and pay me in hundreds
House always sunny, she suck me like slushie (bitch)
Bitch, I'm coming, don't gag, nose runnin' (runnin')
Top floor suite, tell 'em, "Meet me at the London" (London)
Broke as a joke and you niggas so funny (funny)
Me and OhGeesy make it rain 'til it thunder (bitch)

Bitch told me that I'm the hardest (I'm the hardest, Ha)
One K long sleeve tee, chrome hearted (gat)
Finna paint her face like a nigga is a artist
Front flip in the pussy like a nigga Jeff Hardy
What, you think a nigga broke? We ain't sippin' no Bacardi
What, you think a nigga lackin'? We got pistols in the party
Eleven K, what I pay just to bust down the Carti's
All the hoes call me daddy like an episode of Martin
