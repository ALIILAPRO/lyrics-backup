		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My face is the front of shop
My face is the real shop front
My shop is the face I front
I'm real when I shop my face

Artificial bloom
Hydroponic skin
Chemical release
Synthesize the real
Plastic surgery
Social dialect
Positive results
Documents of life

Oh
Nana-nana-nana-nana
Nana-nana-nana-nana-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-nana-nana

My face is the front of shop
My face is the real shop front
My shop is the face I front, front
I'm real when I shop my face

Scalpel, lipstick, gel
Action, camera, lights
Violence in your heart
Memories of love (what?)
Professor?

Oh
Nana-nana-nana-nana (hold it)
Nana-nana-nana-nana-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-nana-nana

My face is the front of shop
My face is the real shop front
My shop is the face I front, front
I'm real when I shop my face

So you must be the one
That I've seen in my dreams
Come on, touch me
Set my spirit free
Ooh, test me
Do you feel what I feel?
Do you see what I see?
Ooh, reduce me to nothingness
Yes, yes

My face is the front of shop
My face is the real shop front
My shop is the face I front, front
I'm real when I shop my face

And you know what I want
My face is the front of shop
So give me what I want
My face is the real shop front
I said everything I want
My shop is the face I front
So give me what I want
I'm real when I shop my face

And you know what I want
My face is the front of shop
So give me what I want
My face is the real shop front
I said everything I want
My shop is the face I front
So give me what I want
I'm real when I shop my face
