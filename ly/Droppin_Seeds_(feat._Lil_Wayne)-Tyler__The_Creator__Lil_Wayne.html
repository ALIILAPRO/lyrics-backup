		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mula
Like Adam in the garden of Eve
My bitch got an apple bottom and she swallow my seeds
Follow my lead, fire I breathe, water my sea
And sit back and watch money grow on trees
Droppin' C's like classes, these hoes drop they asses
I drop a seed in her panties, if it smell like pansies
I'm a banshee in her panties, nigga, ask your mammy
Never played golf, but got a driver and a Caddy
Whole squad slammin' like Onyx, you know sticky fingaz
Some dropped science, I'm droppin' English
Even if Tyler, named the song flower
No seeds in the bud, still don't trust bugs

Droppin' seeds on these niggas
They can't fuck with the boy (Mula)
Droppin' seeds on these bitches
For the love of the sport
I'm droppin' seeds, got this garden
Flowers poppin' of course
I'm droppin' seeds, motherfucker
Weezy Baby the boy, yeah
