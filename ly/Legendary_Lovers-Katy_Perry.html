		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Under a silver moon, tropical temperature
I feel my lotus bloom, come closer
I want your energy, I want your aura
You are my destiny, my mantra

Never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your life
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical, tonight (oh, oh)

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum

Legendary lovers
Yes, we could be legendary (la, la, la, la, la)
Legendary lovers
Yes, we should be legendary (la, la, la, la, la)

Go down in history
Go down together, into infinity, forever
You're Cleopatra
You're blushing Juliet
Anything for your love, a ride or die

Never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your life
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical, tonight (oh, oh)

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum

Legendary lovers
Yes, we could be legendary (la, la, la, la, la)
Legendary lovers
Yes, we should be legendary (la, la, la, la, la)

Ah-ooh! 
Hoo!
Ah-ooh! 
Hoo! 
Ah-ooh! 
Legendary lovers, legendary lovers, (ah-ooh!)
Legendary lovers (ooh!)

Oh, Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum (drum, drum, drum, drum)

Legendary lovers
Yes, we could be legendary (la, la, la, la, la)
(Legendary lover) legendary lovers
Yes, we should be legendary (la, la, la, la, la)

(Oh, take me down) take me down to the river
(Underneath the sun) underneath the blood orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum (oh, baby)

Legendary lovers
Yes, we could be legendary (la, la, la, la, la)
(Oh, oh) legendary lovers
Yes, we should be legendary (la, la, la, la, la)
Ah-ooh!
