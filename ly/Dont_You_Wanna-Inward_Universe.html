		  Ha-ha-i-a

Don't you wanna come on over?
Don't you wanna work it, ha?
Don't you wanna love me better?
Love me better
Love me now

Don't you wanna fix our problems?
Baby, I can show you how
Don't you wanna love me better?
Love me better
Love me now

Don't you wanna fix our problems?
Baby, I can show you how
Don't you wanna love me better?
Love me better
Love me now

I wanna make you work
But all I do is make you worse
The truth is as my beauty swallow

Don't you wanna come on over?
Don't you wanna work it, ha?
Don't you wanna love me better?
Love me better?
Love me now?

Ha-ha-i-a

Don't you wanna come on over?
Don't you wanna work it, ha?
Don't you wanna love me better?
Love me better?
Love me now?

Don't you wanna fix our problems
Baby, I can show you how
Don't you wanna love me better
Love me better
Love me now

Ha-ha-i-a
