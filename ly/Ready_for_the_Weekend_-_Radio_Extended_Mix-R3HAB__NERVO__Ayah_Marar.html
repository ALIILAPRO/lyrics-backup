		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hold on, long week never ending, it's never ending
I keep looking for the light at the end of the road, yeah

I've been working overtime
And now the weekend's on my mind
So if you're hearing me tonight
Then let me see you put em high

If you're ready for the weekend
You gotta let yourself go
If you're ready for the weekend, yeah
I'll take you places you don't know
Everybody, can you hear me?
You've gotta let your heart decide
If you're ready for the weekend, yeah
Then let me see your hands up high
