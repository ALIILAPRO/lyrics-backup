		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Birds flying high you know how I feel
Sun in the sky you know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on by you know how I feel
It's a new dawn it's a new day
It's a new life for me
Oh, it's a new dawn it's a new day
It's a new life for me oh
And I'm feeling good

Fish in the sea you know how I feel
River running free you know how I feel
Blossom on a tree you know how I feel
It's a new dawn it's a new day
It's a new life for me
Ooh and I'm feeling good
Dragonfly out in the sun you
Know what I mean, don't you know
Butterflies all havin' fun
You know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done
That's what I mean
And this old world is a new world
And a bold world for me
Ooh

Stars when you shine you know how I feel
Scent of the pine you know how I feel
Yeah, freedom is mine and I know how I feel
It's a new dawn it's a new day
It's a new life for me, Oh
And I'm feeling good i'm feeling good
I'm feeling good
