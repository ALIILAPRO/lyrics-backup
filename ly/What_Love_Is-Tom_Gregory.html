		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been wait, wait, waiting for days
I would wait a thousand more
Just for one more second or two
To explain the way that I feel

Oh, if we get it right, this could be paradise
Just you and me, just you and me
Oh, it ain't no sacrifice with you by my side
Just you and me, just you and me

I'm gonna say it right to your face
I wanna know, wanna know what love is
Wanna know, wanna know what love is
Another minute I don't wanna waste
I wanna know, wanna know what love is
Wanna know, wanna know what love is

Only thinking 'bout me and you
Got my feelings going through the roof
Only thinking 'bout me and a-you (a-you)
I'm gonna say it right to your face
I wanna know, wanna know what love is
Wanna know, wanna know what love is

I would run, run, run to the moon
I would bring a star back for you
Wanna know, know that if it was you
Would you do the same for me too?

Oh, if we get it right, this could be paradise
Just you and me, just you and me
Oh, it ain't no sacrifice with you by my side
Just you and me, just you and me

I'm gonna say it right to your face
I wanna know, wanna know what love is
Wanna know, wanna know what love is
Another minute I don't wanna waste
I wanna know, wanna know what love is
Wanna know, wanna know what love is

Only thinking 'bout me and you
Got my feelings going through the roof
Only thinking 'bout me and a-you (a-you)
I'm gonna say it right to your face
I wanna know, wanna know what love is
Wanna know, wanna know what love is

I wanna know, wanna know what
I wanna know, wanna know what love is
What love is
Ooh yeah
I wanna know, wanna know what
I wanna know, wanna know what love is
What love is

I'm gonna say it right to your face
I wanna know, wanna know what love is
Wanna know, wanna know what love is
Another minute I don't wanna waste
I wanna know, wanna know what love is
Wanna know, wanna know what love is

Only thinking 'bout me and you
Got my feelings going through the roof
Only thinking 'bout me and a-you (oh)
I'm gonna say it right to your face
I wanna know, wanna know what love is
Wanna know, wanna know what love is

Your love is
