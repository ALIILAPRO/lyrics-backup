		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been up, I've been down
Seen the world from the ground
But I hear the drumming
Now my veins are pumping
Scraped my knees, bruised my heart
Where you end's, not where you start
I see them running
'Cause they see me coming

I'm done with the noise that life seems to bring
But I'll use my voice, it's my turn to sing
Woo, woo

You know that
All my life
I have been waiting, I have been waiting for this
All my life
I have been fighting, I have been fighting for this
Dream in my soul
And I won't let it go
You know that
All my life
They try to keep me down but I just get higher

Whoa whoa whoa
They try to keep me down but I just get higher

Broke my bones, tasted blood
Burned my wings close to the sun
But I'll keep on flying
I'm too young for dying
'Cause there's a dream I can taste
Think it's time I break my chains
And run with the giants
Like smoke, I'm rising

I'm done with the noise that life seems to bring
But I'll use my voice, it's my turn to sing
Woo, woo

You know that
All my life
I have been waiting, I have been waiting for this
All my life
I have been fighting, I have been fighting for this
Dream in my soul
And I won't let it go
You know that
All my life
They try to keep me down but I just get higher

Whoa whoa whoa
They try to keep me down but I just get higher
Whoa whoa whoa
They try to keep me down but I just get higher

All my life
All my life
There's a dream in my soul
And I won't let it go
You know that
All my life
They try to keep me down but I just get higher

Whoa whoa whoa
They try to keep me down but I just get higher
Whoa whoa whoa
They try to keep me down but I just get higher
