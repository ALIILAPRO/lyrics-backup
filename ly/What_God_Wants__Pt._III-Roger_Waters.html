		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't be afraid it's only business
The alien prophet sighed
The vulture and the magpie took
The cash box from its hook

The monkey in the corner wrote
The figures in his book
Crazed the checkout lady's fingers
Flash across the till

The captain posts
The menu for the day
And in banks across the world
Christians Moslems Hindus Jews

And people of every
Race creed colour tint or hue
Get down on their knees and pray
The raccoon and the groundhog

Neatly make up bags of change
But the monkey in the corner
Well he's slowly drifting out of range
Christ it's freezing inside

The veteran cries
The hyenas break cover
And stream through the meadow
And the fog rolls in

Though his bottle of gin
So he picks up a stone
That looks like a bone
And the bullets fly

And the rivers run dry
And the fat girls sigh
And the network anchor persons lie
And the soldier's alone

In the video zone
But the monkey's not watching
He's slipped out to the kitchen
To pile the dishes

And answer the phone
