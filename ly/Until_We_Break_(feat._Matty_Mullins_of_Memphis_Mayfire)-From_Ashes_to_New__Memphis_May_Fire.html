		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Break
You're the cause of the hate and the violence
The pain and the silence, yeah
And all we need to do is

Close our eyes 'cause there is nothing to see
We'll all be fine if all we do is believe

You're the heart of the fate that divides us
A plague and a virus, yeah
And all we need to do is

Close our eyes 'cause there is nothing to see
We'll all be fine if all we do is believe

So, smile for the camera, swallow the dagger
Cut out the ones who disobey
Follow the leader into the fever
One by one, until we break

We can run but it's always behind us
We hide but it finds us, yeah
And all we need to do is

Close our eyes 'cause there is nothing to see
We'll all be fine if all we do is believe

So, smile for the camera, swallow the dagger
Cut out the ones who disobey
Follow the leader into the fever
One by one, until we

Ashes to ashes, we all fall
Burn it down, light the flame
Bury your head till it goes away

Smile for the camera, swallow the dagger
Cut out the ones who disobey
Follow the leader into the fever
One by one, until we break

Smile for the camera (the camera), swallow the dagger (the dagger)
Cut out the ones who disobey
Follow the leader (the leader) into the fever
One by one, until we break
