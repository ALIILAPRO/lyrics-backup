		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A court is in session, a verdict is in
No appeal on the docket today
Just my own sin
The walls are cold and pale
The cage made of steel
Screams fill the room
Alone I drop and kneel
Silence now the sound
My breath the only motion around
Demons cluttering around
My face showing no emotion
Shackled by my sentence
Expecting no return
Here there is no penance
My skin begins to burn

(And I said oh) so I held my head up high
Hiding hate that burns inside
Which only fuels their selfish pride
(And I said oh) all held captive
Out from the sun
A sun that shines on only some
We the meek are all in one

I hear a thunder in the distance
See a vision of a cross
I feel the pain that was given
On that sad day of loss
A lion roars in the darkness
Only he holds the key
A light to free me from my burden
And grant me life eternally

Should have been dead
On a Sunday morning
Banging my head
No time for mourning
Ain't got no time

Should have been dead
On a Sunday morning
Banging my head
No time for mourning
Ain't got no time

(And I said oh) so I held my head up high
Hiding hate that burns inside
Which only fuels their selfish pride
(And I said oh) all held captive
Out from the sun
A sun that shines on only some
We the meek are all in one

I cry out to God
Seeking only his decision
Gabriel stands and confirms
I've created my own prison
I cry out to God
Seeking only his decision
Gabriel stands and confirms
I've created my own prison

(And I said oh) so I held my head up high
Hiding hate that burns inside
Which only fuels their selfish pride
(And I said oh) all held captive
Out from the sun
A sun that shines on only some
We the meek are all in one

(And I said oh) so I held my head up high
Hiding hate that burns inside
Which only fuels their selfish pride
(And I said oh) we're held captive (I created)
Out from the sun (I created)
A sun that shines on only some (I created)
We the meek are all in one (I created my own prison)

Should've been dead on a Sunday morning
Banging my head
No time for mourning
Ain't got no time
