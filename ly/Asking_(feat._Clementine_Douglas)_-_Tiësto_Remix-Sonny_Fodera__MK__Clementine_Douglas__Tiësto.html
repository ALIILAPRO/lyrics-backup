		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, my baby
Where you at?
You know I need you now
Ooh, you been acting so shady
You used to make me feel
Unbelievable

You swore that only you could love me deeper
But it seems you got a bad case of amnesia
I even gave you my keys to the Bimmer
Anytime that you wanted to ride
All I was asking for was you
And some tenderness
All I was asking for was you
All I was asking for was you
All I was asking for was

And you know
Giving my heart ain't usual for me
Try to hide my vulnerability
And I know, I know I don't need ya
'Cause you lie, lie, lie
Every single time

You swore that only you could love me deeper
But it seems you got a bad case of amnesia
I even gave you my keys to the Bimmer
Anytime that you wanted to ride
All I was asking for was you
All I was asking for was you
All I was asking for was you
All I was asking for was you
All I was asking for was

All I was asking for was
All I was asking for was you
