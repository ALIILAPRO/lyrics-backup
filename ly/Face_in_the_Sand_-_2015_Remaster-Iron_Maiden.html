		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everyone's waiting for something to happen 
Everybody's waiting for something to see 
Lunatics waiting for bigger disasters 
Everyone's waiting for news on TV 

Winding lives at the end of the spiral 
Waiting dictators with their next big thrill 
Everyone's looking, but no one is listening 
Everybody wants to be in at the kill 

I wait for the signs, they tell me true 
I see the signs of the end time 

Everyone's searching, but nothing's revealing 
Everyone's looking for the reason why 
Everyone's hoping for life ever after 
Everyone's looking at death from the sky 

Everyone's nightmares are going to happen 
Everybody's ripping the mask from their eyes 
Everyone's praying but no one's believing 
Everyone's heroes tell everyone's lies 

I wait for the signs, they tell me true 
I see the signs of the end

So I watch and I wait 
And I pray for an answer 
An end to the strife and the world's misery 
But the end never came 
And we're digging the graves 
And we're loading the guns for the kill 

Can the end be at hand? 
Is the face in the sand?
Future memory of our tragedy?
Can the end be at hand? 
Is the face in the sand?
Future memory of our tragedy?

So I watch and I wait 
And I pray for an answer 
An end to the strife and the world's misery 
But the end never came 
And we're digging the graves 
And we're loading the guns for the kill 

Can the end be at hand? 
Is the face in the sand?
Future memory of our tragedy?
Can the end be at hand? 
Is the face in the sand?
Future memory of our tragedy?

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
