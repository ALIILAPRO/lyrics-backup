		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uhhh you've got me running around
Burning up, I keep burning up
'Cause you're cool, looking hot
Baby oh you're burning me up like a lot
Uh, I can't control it 
Oh boy, won't you stop?
I feel like you stole it
And I can't live without my heart - don't take it away!

But you please me when you tease me
And I just want more!
Uhhh you've got me running around
Burning up, I keep burning up
1, 2, 3 it's time for me to be burning up!
I keep burning up
4, 5, 6 I love your licks and I'm burning up!
I keep burning up

Can't deny
It's a fight
Uhhh it's all a battle to get with you right
You really got me going
And my mind is set
I'm seeing something growing
But when you touch and play you never go all the way, oh no!

But you please me...
