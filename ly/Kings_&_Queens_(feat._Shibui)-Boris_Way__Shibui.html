		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell your friends to bring their friends, we can dance, we can sing 
Tell your friends to bring their friends (hey)
We're kings and we're queens

Gotta hole here in my heart
Tryna fix it, where to start?
Because the world don't stop for no one
(Because the world don't stop for no one)

All the lights and all the card
I'll be looking to the stars
Ain't it crazy how we move on

I say, oh we, oh we, oh
We go, we go, we go
When you feel it's all coming down
I say, oh we, oh we, oh
We go, we go, we go
And if you're lost just follow the sound

Tell your friends to bring their friends, we can dance, we can sing
Tell your friends to bring their friends (hey)
We're kings and we're queens
We'll do what we want
And we'll get what we need
Tell your friends to bring their friends
We're kings and we're queens

Oh, we oh
Go, we go
Oh, we oh
Go, we go
Oh, we oh
Go, we go
Oh, we oh
Go, we go (hey)

Say the things you wanna say
Just before it gets away
You know time don't stop for no one
(You know time don't stop for no one)

Take the junk you wanna take
Right before it drifts away
'Cause it's harder if you hold on

I say, oh we, oh we, oh
We go, we go, we go
When you feel it's all coming down
I say, oh we, oh we, oh
We go, we go, we go
And if you're lost just follow the sound

Tell your friends to bring their friends, we can dance, we can sing
Tell your friends to bring their friends (hey)
We're kings and we're queens
We'll do what we want
And we'll get what we need
Tell your friends to bring their friends
We're kings and we're queens

Oh, we oh
Go, we go
Oh, we oh
Go, we go
Oh, we oh
Go, we go
Oh, we oh
Go, we go, tell your friends to bring their friends

We can dance, we can sing
Tell your friends to bring their friends (hey)
We're kings and we're queens
