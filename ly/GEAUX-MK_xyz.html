		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know I'm on go
(Go, go, go, go, go)
(Uh, MK) 
(Go, go, go, go, go)
Yeah

You know I'm on go (go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go)
Got your mans on go (go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go)
I tell you when to go (go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go)
You know I'm on go 

Big steppa, but ya baby mama feelin' me (feelin' me)
Big mad at the big dick energy (energy)
You, me and her, yeah, I'm fair boo
Like it how you lookin' back wit' ya hairdo
Bare face bae wit' a booty weave (booty weave)
Taste so good, want two of me
She said she don't even do this usually
I'm like, "Bitch, can you tell the truth to me?"
Yeah (yeah)
Blue racks make 'em all break down
Louis leather make 'em all lay down
Told y'all that I don't play 'round
I won't stop, not now

'Cause you know I'm on go (go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go)
Got your mans on go (go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go)
I tell you when to go (go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go)
You know I'm on- 

Fine just like LisaRaye
Make yo' man insecure like Issa Rae
It's a picture, pose before we on the way
I'm in Paris but I'm actin' like we in the A
Damn, mama in my DM 'bout them eyebrow tips
Ooh, you think you slick? You wanna know me?
Runway girl keep the lobby on lit
In a foreign wit' a foreign like we tourin' off hits, yeah
These jewels might brighten up The Shade Room
Laid up, stretched out in ya bae room
Stop frontin', bae, you let me in the back door
White flag, what's that for?

You know I'm on go (go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go)
Got your mans on go (go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go)
I tell you when to go (go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go)
You know I'm on go

(Go, go, go, go, go)
(Uh, MK) 
(Go, go, go, go, go)
