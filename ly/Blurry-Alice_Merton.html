		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why does everything seem so blurry?
I got lost in a silence out of my head
All the kids shout, "Hey, don't worry"
But what's the point of a love when it comes to an end?

You've got water in your eyes again
It seems like you've been crying again
Bite your lips until they're bleeding red
And maybe you'll find that it's all in your head

I can feel the stares across the side of the room, but
I'm trying not to imagine what is happening with you
Ooh-whoa, I don't wanna know

Why does everything seem so blurry?
I got lost in a silence out of my head
All the kids shout, "Hey, don't worry"
But what's the point of a love when it comes to an end?

I don't wanna play, I don't wanna play this
I don't wanna play the game, oh-oh-oh
Why does everything seem so blurry?
I got lost in a silence out of my head

You've been calling all the shots again
It seems like I'm still running from them
I'll bite your lips until they're bleeding red
And maybe you'll mean all the things that you said

I can feel the stares across the side of the room, but
I'm trying not to imagine what is happening with you
Oh-woah, I don't wanna know

Why does everything seem so blurry?
I got lost in a silence out of my head
All the kids shout, "Hey, don't worry"
But what's the point of a love when it comes to an end?

I don't wanna play, I don't wanna play this
I don't wanna play the game, oh-oh-oh
Why does everything seem so blurry?
I got lost in a silence out of my head

Why does everything seem so blurry?
I got lost in a silence out of my head
All the kids shout, "Hey, don't worry"
But what's the point of a love when it comes to an end?

I don't wanna play, I don't wanna play this
I don't wanna play the game, oh-oh-oh
Why does everything seem so blurry?
I got lost in a silence out of my head
