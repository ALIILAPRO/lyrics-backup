		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  August Moon, laid just for you, steady, ready, smile like his, until it's out of sight.
Don't undo the true chance that chooses you
Face to face with a new day
So simple it seemed, you dare to dream impossibly, risking its rarity of â€˜I'll do it now'
Black and blissful, tumbling, I wake, I sleep, it feeds me
Fate may rule you and heart it fools you to lose your sanity
