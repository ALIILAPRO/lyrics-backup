		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it's hard
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you know it's hard
Everybody wants her, everybody loves her
Everybody wants to take your baby home

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch your friends
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it never ends
You know that it's crazy, you wanna trust her
Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone

Maybe it's just an ego problem
Problem is that I've been fooled before
By fair-weather friends and faint hearted lovers
And every time it happens it just convinces me more

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you look for lies
Everybody tempts her, everybody tells her
She's the most beautiful woman they know

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch your friends
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it never ends
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes
