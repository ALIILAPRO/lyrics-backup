		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You said at the party that I was too drunk
I told you I liked you, you said, "Sober up"
But why would I lie? It's so clear I'm in love with you
A tense conversation, you like someone else
I say, "If I waited, could that maybe help?"
You told me that patience won't change how you felt for me

So I'll stop being pretentious and loathing our friendship
You taught me a lesson that love isn't precious
It's not like the novels, no Pride and Prejudice at all

So I'll just take a footnote in your life
And you could take my body
Every line I would write for you
But a footnote will do
A footnote will do

We ate at a restaurant, the hosts said we're cute
They think we're a couple, they bought us some booze
We shared the Moscato and laughed 'cause it's true to me
Oh, and I'd be embarrassed if I weren't so pleased
That everyone else sees what you never see
We're perfect together but I'll never be the one

So I'll stop being pretentious and loathing our friendship
You taught me a lesson that feelings are reckless
It's just like the novels, side characters end up alone

So I'll just take a footnote in your life
And you could take my body
Every line I would write for you
But a footnote will do
A footnote will do
A footnote will do

Please, don't forget me
Forget me
Please, don't forget me
Forget me (a footnote will do)
Please, don't forget me
Forget me
Please, don't forget me
Forget me
A footnote will do
A footnote will do
(Forget)
A footnote will do
A footnote will do
