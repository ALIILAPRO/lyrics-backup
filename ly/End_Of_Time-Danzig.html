		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The suffering's here
The wait is gone
The streets are filled
With a hollow song
Got a new death
It lurks outside
Follows me home
Waiting for me

Lost your soul
Doomed and cold
Yea
Lost your soul
Doomed and cold
Yea

A hum in the ear
Numbness comes
Feeling like you're almost home
The open arms
Tempting embrace
It's always been
Waiting

Waiting at the end of time for you
And you'll be too
Yea

The suffering's here
The wait is gone
The streets are filled
With a hollow song
Empty world
Of listless night
I pray to thee
I suffer blind

Waiting at the end of time for you
And you'll be too
Yea

Lost your soul
Doomed and cold
Yea
Lost your soul
Doomed and cold
Yea
Right

Waiting at the end of time for you
And you'll be too
Yea

Lost your soul
Doomed and cold
Yea
Lost your soul
Doomed and cold
Yea
Lost your soul
Doomed and cold
Yea
Lost your soul
Doomed and cold
Yea
