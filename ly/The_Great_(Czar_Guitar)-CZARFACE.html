		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say the first blow stuns you
The second one, that's the KO
My knuckles 'bout to hurt, going in

Y'all don't want it with Deck
You know anything I drop will never fall short of respect
Y'all the type that they sorta respect
I'm a war vet
Off with your head once they forward the check
Yup, the cream keep calling me back
Never falling to trap
I flee the scene with your broad in my lap
And I ain't worried 'bout half of the chat
Haters talk 'til you see 'em
That's when they try (?)
Keep a wise mind writing his act
Don't even try to react
Tony Stewart how I'm riding the track
Even if you don't vibe to my rap
I still be on your dome like a snap back fastened your straps
The rebel how they said I act, no lie
Like I work for Home Pride all the bread I stack
Call the jet to a west-side flat to relax
Left with the stewardess on the red-eye back

See I'm straight, y'all got it twisted
I'm great, y'all not as gifted
See I'm straight, y'all got it twisted
I'm great, y'all not as gifted

Beside man, relax
Stand up, straighten your back out
Realizing, man
He made some good fertilizer, fam
It's what I said as I tied his hands and feet to a post on a random street
Then I chop his little body up into sandwich meat
I'm flying handsome version of Brian Cranston
Holding a cop for ransom
Open up my demands and clean it out
But keep every bit of the [?] ransom
And Make some giant bands that [?] anthem
A phantom Pteranodon
Quick, turn the cameras on
Get a pic with him or the dying rapper he's landing on
As he turns the ghost cannon on
Says he bought it on Amazon
Now tell me what the fuck are you planning on? (nothing)
Damn, he strong, can't be wrong
Air heads out like the candy's gone
It's Czarface, back to attack your heart again
Destroy your ass like Drax from the Guardians
Czarface is here, we got you
