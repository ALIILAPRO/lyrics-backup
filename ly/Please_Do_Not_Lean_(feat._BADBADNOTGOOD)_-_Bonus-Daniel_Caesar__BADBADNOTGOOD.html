		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sweet Emily, my bride to be
Just how long will you stand next to me?
For we both know, it's more than a load
For you to bear
It'd break my heart but I'd understand
If you'd leave me for another man
With a little less on his mind, less on his plate
Less in his brain

Please do not lean on me, I'm unstable
You're all you need, I've seen it, you're able
Please do not lean on me, I'm unstable
You're all you need, I've seen it, you're able

Sex in the air, deep in despair
Could you please act like you're unaware?
But we both know I'm just a dog
Chasin' his bone
Please understand, I'm just a man
That's nearly figured out his master plan
Just stick around and you gon' see
I'm worth every pound

Please do not lean on me, I'm unstable
You're all you need, I've seen it, you're able
Please do not lean on me, I'm unstable
You're all you need, I've seen it, you're able

The more that we both try to fight it
The harder it's gon' be
I wish that we could stand united
Instead, we're crumblin'
I know that you gon' always love me
In spite of things you've seen
In spite of things you've heard me say
No matter how obscene

If I am the sky (I am the sky, I am the sky)
You are the sea
Starin' back at me
If I am the sky (I am the sky, I am the sky)
You are the sea
Starin' back at me
If I am the sky (I am the sky, I am the sky)
You are the sea
Starin' back at me
