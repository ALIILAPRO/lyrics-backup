		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What do you say to the dead?
Will you forgive me for living?
Can't believe the things that they said
Wonderful day for a killing
It's killing me!

What do they do with your soul?
Is it just lying there busted?
When did you lose all control?
Is there someone to be trusted with my mind?

Oh there's insufficient evidence
Of what just might come after
But sometimes out of nowhere
There's demented sounds of laughter

Are we all haunted by the ghost - imagination?
It just can't be, I've seen them there howling at the moon
Is it just me or does somebody else, believe this
Well I'm not alone and I'm not afraid
There's just one way to see after all
After all
After all
After all

What do you say to the dead?
Is there a place where it's burning?
It says in a book I once read
Yes, there's a chance of returning
Turn to me

The fundamental principles
Say nothing of forever
But those are voices that I hear
Or I'm just not so clever

It can't be me I know somebody else, believes this
Well I'm not alone, I'm not afraid
Just one way to see after all
After all
Coming after all
After all
After all
