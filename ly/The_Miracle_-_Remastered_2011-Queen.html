		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every drop of rain that falls in Sahara Desert says it all
It's a miracle
All God's creations great and small
The Golden Gate and the Taj Mahal
That's a miracle
Test tube babies being born
Mothers, fathers dead and gone
It's a miracle
We're having a miracle on earth
Mother nature does it all for us
The wonders of this world go on
The Hanging Gardens of Babylon
Captain Cook and Cain and Abel
Jimi Hendrix to the Tower of Babel
It's a miracle
It's a miracle
(It's a miracle)

It's a miracle
The one thing we're all waiting for
Is peace on Earth and end to war
It's the miracle we need, the miracle
The miracle we're all waiting for today

If every leaf on every tree
Could tell a story that would be a miracle
If every child on every street
Had clothes to wear and food to eat
That's a miracle
If all god's people could be free
To live in perfect harmony
It's a miracle
We're having a miracle on earth
Mother nature does it all for us

Open hearts and surgery
Sunday mornings with a cup of tea
Super powers always fighting
Mona Lisa just keeps on smiling
It's a miracle
It's a miracle
It's a miracle

(The wonders of this world go on)

Well it's a miracle
It's a miracle
(It's a miracle)
It's a miracle
The one thing (the one thing)
We're all waiting for (we're all waiting for)
Is peace on earth (peace on earth)
And an end to war (end to war)
It's the miracle we need, the miracle

(The miracle)
Peace on earth and end to war today

That time will come one day you'll see when we can all be friends
That time will come one day you'll see when we can all be friends
That time will come one day you'll see when we can all be friends
That time will come
