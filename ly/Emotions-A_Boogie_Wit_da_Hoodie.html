		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't be in my feelings, emotions be hittin' too strong (hittin' too strong)
I can't open up to you, I feel like you gon' do me wrong (gon' do me wrong)
I don't know the intentions you hide, but I guess I'll just have to see over time (yeah)
I don't need no one, if you leave, I'ma do me, baby, 'cause
I can't be in my feelings, emotions be hittin' too strong (nah, nah)
If I open up to you, just promise you won't do me wrong (don't do me wrong)
I don't know the secrets you hide, hopefully I can just trust you with mine (yeah)
I don't need nobody, you leave, I'ma do me, baby, 'cause I

They be thinkin' they know what's goin' on (nah, nah, nah)
Wanna see me heartbroken so I can sing love songs like
I'm your man and you're my girl
Christian Dior your world
You match my whole fly
Show you off to the whole wide world
You're my girl
Outside, you act shy
I know you inside
Seen you at your worst times
And I'll fuck you right, I will
I'll fuck you right, I-
I'ma fuck you, feelin' like no one has ever made you feel, yeah

I can't be in my feelings, emotions be hittin' too strong (hittin' too strong)
I can't open up to you, I feel like you gon' do me wrong (gon' do me wrong)
I don't know the intentions you hide, but I guess I'll just have to see over time (yeah)
I don't need no one, if you leave, I'ma do me, baby, 'cause
I can't be in my feelings, emotions be hittin' too strong (nah, nah)
If I open up to you, just promise you won't do me wrong (don't do me wrong)
I don't know the secrets you hide, hopefully I can trust you with mine (yeah)
I don't need nobody, you leave, I'ma do me, baby, 'cause I

I get it (yeah)
Swipe the card, no limit (card no limit)
Papers, ain't grabbin' no Swishers
Captain Hook, big fisher (Captain Hook)
Had to cut out my ex out the picture
In the BX, I'm that nigga
But that's where they put my best friends in the system
Gets more lonely every time I get richer
Nowadays, I don't wanna take pictures, yeah (I don't wanna take pictures)
Outside you act shy
You're exactly my type
I'ma tell it to the whole wide world, yeah
And they fiendin', they know what be goin' on
Wanna see me heartbroken so I can sing love songs like (ooh, ooh, ooh)

I can't be in my feelings, emotions be hittin' too strong (hittin' too strong)
I can't open up to you, I feel like you gon' do me wrong (gon' do me wrong)
I don't know the intentions you hide, but I guess I'll just have to see over time (yeah)
I don't need no one, if you leave, I'ma do me, baby, 'cause
I can't be in my feelings, emotions be hittin' too strong (nah, nah)
If I open up to you, just promise you won't do me wrong (don't do me wrong)
I don't know the secrets you hide, hopefully I can trust you with mine (yeah)
I don't need nobody, you leave, I'ma do me, baby, 'cause I (yeah)

(NOVA gon' make that shit bang)
