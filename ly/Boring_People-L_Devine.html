		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Boring people, boring lives
Wake up to the same nine to five
Drinkin' coffee, fried off the night
'Cause we boring people, boring life

I'm aching, what's new
I'm so vain, and I hate my self, too
Crybaby, all blue
But I love my life, yes, I promise

But I save me, breakthrough
I got my shit together right with the news
But I'm faking, no clue
Talkin' the same shit is always

Boring people, boring lives
Wake up to the same nine to five
Drinkin' coffee, fried off the night
'Cause we boring people, boring life

So ready, let's go
Sit tight, I can put on a show
Hey friends, love you
I can't believe they fell for it

Might watch paint dry
And reminisce about when I was a child
Get low, get high
My dreams are the same as my problems

Boring people, boring lives
Wake up to the same nine to five
Drinkin' coffee, fried off the night
'Cause we boring people, boring life

Boring people, boring lives
Wake up to the same nine to five
Drinkin' coffee, fried off the night
'Cause we boring people, boring life
