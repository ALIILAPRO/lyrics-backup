		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Darling, I know we talked about it one too many times
How there was something missing in our lives
A little life
So we tried, it was more than just a twinkle in your eye
But some things you just don't get to decide
At least we tried

The first casualty of life is the plan
When I look back I'm not even sure that
We were thinking

Somewhere
She's probably dancing with her blonde hair
Falling like ribbons on her shoulders
Just like we always saw
Bright eyes
Spinning in circles in the sunlight
Darling, we tried but now it's over
We had it all and then we lost
The girl that never was

If I could say
A million words to take away the pain
What kills me is you trying to take the blame
You're not to blame

I'll never say I told you so
But sad I've thought the words
Tried drowning you in happiness
I only make it worse
We never should've picked a name
'Cause now she has a face
And now no matter what we do
No one will take her place

Somewhere
She's probably dancing with her blonde hair
Falling like ribbons on her shoulders
Just like we always saw
Bright eyes
Spinning in circles in the sunlight
Darling, we tried but now it's over
We had it all and then we lost
The girl that never was

I know we'll never know you
I know we'll never hold you
I never got to show you
My love

'Cause somewhere
You're probably dancing with your blonde hair
Falling like ribbons on your shoulders
Just like we always saw
Bright eyes
Spinning in circles in the sunlight
Darling, we tried but now it's over
We had it all and then we lost
The girl that never was
