		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can’t bring myself to throw out your chapstick
It still rolls around the glovebox where you left it
As stupid as it sounds
I still got it now
Cause parts of me knows
Parts of you will always regret it

If you don’t leave me in your past
I’ll always see you as my future
I can’t love just half of you
Just do what you gotta do

Let me crash
Let me burn
It’s a better kinda hurt
When it’s all 
Been said and done
Maybe then i’ll give you up
Now i’m begging you for mercy
And i’m praying you’ll desert me
So promise me you’re never coming back
Leave me in the aftermath

I would spend a hundred nights alone if i had to
Maybe then i’d start to picture me without you
Cause i can’t escape the pain
It’s like i’m bleeding either way
It’s that first time that you left i’m going back to

If you don’t leave me in your past
I’ll always see you as my future
I can’t love just half of you
Just do what you gotta do

Let me crash
Let me burn
It’s a better kinda hurt
When it’s all 
Been said and done
Maybe then i’ll give you up
Now i’m begging you for mercy
And i’m praying you’ll desert me
So promise me you’re never coming back
Leave me in the aftermath

You know i still love you
We both know exactly what you’re doing
Give me just enough to keep me
Coming back so there’s no moving on

Let me crash
Let me burn
It’s a better kinda hurt
When it’s all 
Been said and done
Maybe then i’ll give you up
Now i’m begging you for mercy
And i’m praying you’ll desert me
So promise me you’re never coming back
Leave me in the aftermath
