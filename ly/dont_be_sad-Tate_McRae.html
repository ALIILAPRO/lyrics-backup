		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  D-d-don't be sad

I'm sorry, I can't seem to do anything right
To be honest might delete this song tonight
Did you even notice I was here?
If I left the party would you even care?

So I guess that I was never what you wanted
Wasted all my money throwing pennies in a fountain
It's not easy tryna tell you how I feel
When all you ever say is

"Don't be sad"
"The sun is shining"
"Just be happy"
"Why you whining?"
Waiting room is getting crowded
"You're not special, you're not special"

"Don't be sad"
"The sun is shining"
"Just be happy"
"Why you whining?"
Waiting room is getting crowded
"You're not special, you're not special"

(You're not special, you're not special)
"You're not special, you're not special"
(You're not special, you're not special)
"You're not special, you're not special"

I'm sorry, sorry that you just don't understand
You always tell me that it's only in my head
Then why's the Internet feel like my only friend
The only one that knows that this isn't pretend

Everyone's in therapy
Wouldn't go if you were there for me
Never should've told you how I felt
Cause all you ever say is

"Don't be sad"
"The sun is shining"
"Just be happy"
"Why you whining?"
Waiting room is getting crowded
"You're not special, you're not special"

"Don't be sad"
"The sun is shining"
"Just be happy"
"Why you whining?"
Waiting room is getting crowded
"You're not special, you're not special"

(You're not special, you're not special)
"You're not special, you're not special"
(You're not special, you're not special)
"You're not special, you're not special"
