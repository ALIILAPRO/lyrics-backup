		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nobody knows my love
Nobody knows my love
In the Gods we hide away
And nobody ever looks up
Like the heavy summer haze
I don't see past my love

He wakes my quietly
With a kiss that lingers like evergreen
We drift so sweet
And with his eyes he speaks to me silently

Nobody knows my love
Nobody knows but us

There's a world out there
That would keep us apart
Let's stay where
We're safe in the dark

Nobody knows my love
For how long we've been this way
And ever if it rains, my love
Oh, there'll be hurricanes
And rivers will come rushing through the gates
But know that we'll land somewhere
Know that we'll have somewhere
'Til it all evaporates, mmh

There's a world there
That would keep us apart
Let's stay where
We're safe in the dark

Nobody knows my love
Nobody knows but us
