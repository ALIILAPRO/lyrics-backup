		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This ain't what you want
This ain't what you want now
This ain't what you want

Too alive can't put me in a box
I redefine any definition you got
Eye of the tiger, I'm making steps to the top
With flames I whip it up you
Just gotta hand me the Roc

Take a seat you cannot stand it
All I know the flow hotter
Than a scotch bonnet
Don't try study me, you cannot manage
Told you this ain't what you want, bitch
I'm a fucking phenomenon

(Bitch, I'm a phenomenon)
(Bitch, I'm a phenomenon)
This ain't what you want, bitch
I'm a fucking phenomenon

This ain't what you want, bitch
I'm a fucking phenomenon

(I'm a phenomenon, I'm a phenomenon)
(I'm a phenomenon)

It's Dax!
Yeah, you better listen I'm bringing heat
You'll bе a fan when I start rapping
The way I'll have your fucking hеad spinning
I'm known to spit vicious
Release bombs, they go tick-tick boom!
You blown leave that head missing
I'm a phenomenon
Stacking cheese like it's Parmesan
Eight different flows call me Octomom
I'm moving fast like the autobahn
And I'm independent so I'm not here
Fucking starving like it's ramadan
Sick twisted gifted, can't copy print it
Can't hold me down I shape shift I'm liquid
I killed this beat I might get convicted
They know how I move it was predicted
Persistent, spoke it into existence
So consistent, no assistance
Hear me once become addicted
If I rapped it then I lived it
There's no cap when I be spitting

Told you this ain't what you want, bitch
I'm a fucking phenomenon
This ain't what you want, bitch
I'm a fucking phenomenon
