		  Gym Class Heroes
Radiokilla

Haha, you know what it is
Gym Class Heroes, The-Dream
It's hard to look innocent when I got cookie crumbs all over my face and shit

I like girls
They like me
They look so good in their 7 Jeans
Want you to be the one
And my only
I want to be faithful
But I can't keep my hands out the cookie jar

My hands, my hands, my haha, my hands
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my ha, my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my ha, my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my hands out the cookie jar

You see I got this problem
I need help trying to solve it
'Cause meeting after meeting
And I'm still a cookie-holic
You can hide 'em, I'ma find 'em
On the counter, in the closet
And I'll say I ain't do it
With my face covered in chocolate
My girl be setting booby traps
To catch me eating Scooby Snacks
I left crumbs in the bed once
But I told her I was through with that
She still don't be believing me
And I guess that I'm cool with that
But I got a sweet tooth
That'll never come loose
And the fact of the matter is

I like girls
They like me
They look so good in their 7 Jeans
Want you to be the one
And my only
I want to be faithful
But I can't keep my hands out the cookie jar

My hands, my hands, my haha, my hands
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my ha, my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my ha, my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my hands out the cookie jar

I got a thing for Milano biscotti Italianos
And I'll never turn down some Oreos if you got them
Butter pecan Puerto Rican
Or them oatmeal raisin Asians
Hazelnut Brazilians, macadamia Caucasians
Double Stuf or Thin Mint
It don't matter, you gettin' it
'Cause I got a sweet tooth
That'll never come loose
And the fact of the matter is

I like girls
They like me
They look so good in their 7 Jeans
Want you to be the one
And my only
I want to be faithful
But I can't keep my hands out the cookie jar

My hands, my hands, my haha, my hands
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my ha, my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my ha, my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my hands out the cookie jar

I'm a monster for these cookies
I'm a beast for their treats
A animal for their crackers
Head to feet, they so damn sweet
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my huh-uh, my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my hands out the cookie jar

And there you have it
I tried my best
I went to Cookie Anonymous
I guess I'm a failure
I can't seem to keep my damn hands out the cookie jar, but
It is what it is
