		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, yeah
Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business
God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open

All that you got, skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy

Somethin' 'bout you
Makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

Nothin' to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin' like introducing
Us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste of flavor, 'cause I'm a taker
'Cause I'm a giver, it's only nature
I live for danger

All that you got, skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy

Oh, yeah
Somethin' 'bout you
Makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Somethin' 'bout you

All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that
You know how I'm feeling inside (somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout)
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that
You know how I'm feeling inside (somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout)

Somethin' 'bout you
Makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Somethin' 'bout you

All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath like that
You know how I'm feeling inside (you know how I'm feeling inside, baby)
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath like that
You know how I'm feeling inside (somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout)

(Yeah, there's somethin' 'bout you, boy)
(Yeah, there's somethin' 'bout you, boy)
(Yeah, there's somethin' 'bout you, boy) somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Somethin' 'bout you
(Yeah, there's somethin' 'bout you, boy)
(Yeah, there's somethin' 'bout you, boy)
(Yeah, there's somethin' 'bout you, boy) somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Somethin' 'bout you
