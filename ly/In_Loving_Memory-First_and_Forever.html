		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Running out, I’m running over
Call me out, call me sober
It’s in my head, it’s like a sickness
Pull me down, pull me closer
Underground, it’s getting colder
It’s in my head, it’s like a sickness

Out loud
I can hear the echoes screaming
On the way down

My chest, your knife
I know what’s on your mind
Cut me open, look inside
T-T-T-Tell me what you find
One last kiss before we fall
I guess that makes it personal
I made my hate say never again
I always find my way back in the end

Starting out, I’m starting over
I’m getting out, I’m getting closure
I’m in your head, I’m like a sickness
Hold me down, hold me closer
Shut me down, keep me sober
I’m in your head, I’m like a sickness

My chest, your knife
I know what’s on your mind
Cut me open, look inside
T-T-T-Tell me what you find
One last kiss before we fall
I guess that makes it personal
I made my hate say never again
I always find my way back
 
In loving memory
I wrote your name in scarlet
Another surgery
Strap me down, carve me out

My chest, your knife
I know what’s on your mind
Cut me open, look inside
One last kiss before we fall
I guess that makes it personal
I made my hate say never again
I always find my way back
