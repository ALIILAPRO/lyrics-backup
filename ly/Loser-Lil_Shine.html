		  (Bitch, Hey, fuck you, mane)
(Who put this shit together? Me)
(Who do I trust? Me)

I got a fear of the future
I got a fear that I'll lose her
I get money but feel like a loser
My licks on computers
Yeah, I wanna tap that
Let me smack that lil’ girl out my way
Sendin' shots, hit the block
Better move out the way

And I told you not to come
Back around but you did
How it feel to be here after all this time?
Finally, finally gettin' nothin’ but honesty
Honestly baby, like, you took a loss with me
(Bitch) i told you not to come
Back around but you did
How it feel to be here after all this time?
Finally, finally gettin' nothin' but honesty
Honestly baby, like, you took a loss with me

Fuck it, bae, let's turn up
That bitch wanna turn up
I just wanna get slurped up
And she wet like surfs up
She say that she had enough
I think that I've had enough
Racks so tall, can't add it up
She got ass, lemme slap it up
Fuck it, bae, let's turn up
That bitch wanna turn up
I just wanna get slurped up
And she wet like surfs up
She say that she had enough
I think that I've had enough
Racks so tall, can’t add it up
She got ass, lemme slap it up

I got a fear of the future
I got a fear that I’ll lose her
I get money but feel like a loser
My licks on computers
Yeah, I wanna tap that
Let me smack that lil' girl out my way
Sendin’ shots, hit the block
Better move out the way

Bitch, bi-bi-bitch
