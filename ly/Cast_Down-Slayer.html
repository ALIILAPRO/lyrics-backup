		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Despair, emptiness
See the hatred wasted on yourself
Face down taste the dust; it's getting harder everyday
Just to find a reason not to end it all yourself
Suicide on the street
Everywhere around you watch it breed
It begins to bury you in self-induced rejection 

So now you're wasted, broken down
I see through your ignorance
Penetrate the surface of your insecure inside
Next fix, shoot it up
Looking for the place where god speaks
Every time you find him he just stabs you in the back
Again 

No one hears you
You're society's infection
I won't judge you
When the blood steals life from you 

Cast down and thrown away
You are the living dead
The needle numbs the pain
Of all your suffering
This is where the world of money changes nothing 

Just a statistic in the shadows of the real world
The system's failing you just the way it failed me
Hell is home on the concrete where the city bleeds
America, home of the free, land of fucking
Disenchantment 

Despair, emptiness
Isolation rapes you everyday
Face down taste the dust, digging deeper in your grave
Haven't found a reason
Haven't found a thing to fucking live for
Godless he doesn't care
How you choose to destroy yourself
In a world that feeds on hate
You're left here just to waste away
In your cardboard prison, asphalt wasteland 

No one hears you
You're society's infection
I won't judge you
When the blood steals life from you
No one sees you
You're society's infection
I won't judge you
When the blood steals life from you 

Cast down and thrown away
You are the living dead
The needle numbs the pain
Of all your suffering
This is where the world of money changes nothing
