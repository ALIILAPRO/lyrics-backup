		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like a prayer surrounding us, moving effortlessly
Every word is relief
I'm in dancefloor therapy, all my babies and me
But tonight it's for free

No self-sabotage, no letting my thoughts run
Me and this spiral are done
Burn this camouflage I've been wearing for months
Tryna let a little happy in for once

I need to let my mind rest
While my body reflects

Don't get me down, I won't let me get me (down)
Don't get me down, I won't let me get me (down)
I'm good right now, I won't let me get me 
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside out

Diving in ferociously, dancing intimately
I'm so connected to me
In the dark I'm letting go, so anonymously
I guess this is what it feels like to be free

I need to let my mind rest (my, my mind)
While my body reflects

Don't get me down, I won't let me get me (down)
Don't get me down, I won't let me get me (down)
I'm good right now, I won't let me get me
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside out

Don't get me down, I won't let me get me (down)
Don't get me down, I won't let me get me (down)
I'm good right now, I won't let me get me
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside

Oh, my, I guess this is what it feels like to be free (ooh)
Oh, my, I guess this is what it feels like to see me (ooh)

(Down)
(Get down)
Don't get me
(Down)
Oh
(Get down)
Don't get me
(Down)
(Get down)
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside out

Don't get me down, I won't let me get me (down)
Don't get me down, I won't let me get me (down)
I'm good right now, I won't let me get me
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside out
