		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To die in this dimension
Would protect all the things
That want to do you harm
I don't know if I am meant to enjoy it
When it all feels the same

If we offer refunds
All that has been abandoned
Waver not for love

Shadoop-shooby-doo
Shadoop-shooby-doo
Shadoop-shooby-doo
Sorry that I wish that I was dead
Shadoop-shooby-doo
Shadoop-shooby-doo
Shadoop-shooby-doo
Sorry that I wish that I was dead

Offer mending
Want without demanding
Burn up
On the only bridge that you had kept
Watch the world in rich amazement
I'm not meant to be here
Choose the most unsaturated outlet
Made the deal with one agreement
Never to be left out
Die in this dimension and you'll wake
Lonely, replacement, reach

Shadoop-shooby-doo
Shadoop-shooby-doo
Shadoop-shooby-doo
Sorry that I wish that I was dead
Shadoop-shooby-doo
Shadoop-shooby-doo
Shadoop-shooby-doo
Sorry that I wish that I was dead
