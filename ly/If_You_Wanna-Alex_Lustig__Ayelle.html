		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you wanna work I'm working
If you wanna work I'm working

You want a reaction something to say
Yeah, we got boxes ticked
But we're not the same you wanna confuse us
For everyone else
I guess that's your business but
I don't wanna be compared

If you wanna work I'm working
And I wanna work on you
If you wanna work, keep workin'
If you wanna work on me too
If you wanna work I'm working
And I wanna work on you
If you wanna work, keep workin'
If you wanna work on me too

You wanna be certain you wanna be sure
Yeah, we got all these tricks
But you want more
I guess that's your business, babe
I know you got things to say
I can't tell the future for ya
But I'll working towards it

If you wanna work I'm working
And I wanna work on you
If you wanna work, keep workin'
If you wanna work on me too
If you wanna work I'm working
I wanna work on you
If you wanna work, keep workin'
If you wanna work on me too
