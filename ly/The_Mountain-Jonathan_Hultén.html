		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Moonlight shines brightly
Laying bare an unseen path
Of dreams and hopes 
That all had gone away

I've seen promise in the dawn
Released from the shadows
I bathe in time we never had

Walking up the mountain 
Into the big red sun

I'll search far and wide
For all the keys
To my spirit's love for fire

Climbing up the mountain
The secrets of the sun

Fall down

Danger, danger
There's no ground
I'm falling down
Wounds run deep
I'm dying
The end is drawing near

I did wrong
To here stay for so long
For I have come
To sing the daemons' songs
I travel on

Standing on the mountain
Within the blood red sun
I am fire, burning in the sky
Standing on the mountain
Within the blood red sun
