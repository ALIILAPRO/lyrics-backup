		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dancing in the graveyard
Leave me in a coffin call me on my cellphone
And ask me if I'm off it
Spinning in my head, head
Leave me like I'm dead, dead
She wanna drink my blood
But I want her's instead

Dancing in the graveyard
Leave me at Hot Topic
Call me on my cellphone
And ask me if I'm off it
Spinning in my head, head
Leave me like I'm dead, dead
She wanna drink my blood
But I want her's instead

Scene slut in the club and
She's getting fucked up
With a halo on my head and
These diamonds on my tongue
And she said she liked my fit
But it wasn't up to snuff (omg)
But my face was really cute and
She really wants to fuck
So we linked online and
She's like "Blah, blah, blah"
And I wanna cut her off
But I really wanna fuck
So I chat her up in a bind all day
And she's like "By the way, I'm a vampire
Baby"

Dancing in the graveyard
Leave me in a coffin call me on my cellphone
And ask me if I'm off it
Spinning in my head, head
Leave me like I'm dead, dead
She wanna drink my blood
But I want her's instead

Dancing in the graveyard
Leave me at Hot Topic
Call me on my cellphone
And ask me if I'm off it
Spinning in my head, head
Leave me like I'm dead, dead
She wanna drink my blood
But I want her's instead

Dancing in the graveyard
Leave me in a coffin call me on my cellphone
And ask me if I'm off it
Spinning in my head, head
Leave me like I'm dead, dead
She wanna drink my blood
But I want her's instead
Dancing in the graveyard
Leave me at Hot Topic
Call me on my cellphone
And ask me if I'm off it
Spinning in my head, head
Leave me like I'm dead, dead
She wanna drink my blood
But I want her's instead
