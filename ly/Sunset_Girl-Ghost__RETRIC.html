		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's goes, the girl I loved so long
She just walked out, and it set in like the sun
I'm alright, knowing that we're both wrong
I'm going hard, and my money going dumb
Sunset girl, she don't like to cause fuss
Sunset girl, on my mind through the dusk
Sunset girl, she don't like to cause fuss
Sunset girl, on my mind through the dusk

I'll confide in these songs whenever she's gone
Wish I could find a better note that we could leave on
Every-time I see her face i can't pretend to be strong
There's something that I'd like to know and I'll just have to dream on
Things won't be the same, no
Diamonds on my chains, glow
My clique in the same, boat
Hoes gone need a rain, coat
I make it rain I make it snow
You're boyfriend is lame and broke
His bitch gone go the way I go
She wanna come take my soul
Should've saw the writing on the wall
Out here running up a bag so I never call
Emotion pouring out of you until the dawn
Wish that you would let me know what's going on
Oh, Oh
You fucking with him
I don't want you
Do what you do
Oh
Said you were friends
Lied to my face
That wasn't true
Oh
I'm on my shit
Getting this cake
You fucked up my mood
Oh
This is ain't a game
I'm really a king
You'll see when I'm through
Oh

There's goes, the girl I loved so long
She just walked out, and it set in like the sun
I'm alright, knowing that we're both wrong
I'm going hard, and my money going dumb
Sunset girl, she don't like to cause fuss
Sunset girl, on my mind through the dusk
Sunset girl, she don't like to cause fuss
Sunset girl, on my mind through the dusk
