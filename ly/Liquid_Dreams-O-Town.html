		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Posters of love surrounding me
Lost in a world of fantasy
Every night she comes to me 
And gives me all the love I need

Now this hot girl, she's not your average girl
She's a morpharotic dream from a magazine
And she's so fine, designed to blow your mind
She's a dominatrix, supermodel, beauty queen, ooh

I dream about a girl who's a mix of Destiny's Child
Just a little touch Madonna's wild style
With Janet Jackson's smile
Throw in a body like Jennifer
You got the star of my liquid dreams

Angelina Jolie's lips to kiss in the dark
Underneath Cindy C's beauty mark
When it comes to the test, well, Tyra's the best
And Salma Hayek brings the rest, oh-whoa

Now this hot girl, she's not your average girl
She's a morpharotic dream from a magazine
And she's so fine, designed to blow your mind
She's a dominatrix, supermodel, beauty queen, ooh

I dream about a girl who's a mix of Destiny's Child
Just a little touch Madonna's wild style
With Janet Jackson's smile
Throw in a body like Jennifer
You got the star of my liquid dreams

Looks ain't everything, she's got the sweetest personality
Like Halle B 
My mama thinks I'm lazy, my friend all think I'm crazy
But in my mind, I leave the world behind every night I dream

Liquid dreams, my liquid dreams
Waterfall and streams, these liquid dreams

I dream about a girl who's a mix of Destiny's Child
Just a little touch Madonna's wild style
With Janet Jackson's smile
Throw in a body like Jennifer
You got the star of my liquid dreams

I dream about a girl who's a mix of Destiny's Child
Just a little touch Madonna's wild style
With Janet Jackson's smile
Throw in a body like Jennifer
You got the star of my liquid dreams

I dream about a girl who's a mix of Destiny's Child
Just a little touch Madonna's wild style
With Janet Jackson's smile
Throw in a body like Jennifer
You got the star of my liquid dreams
