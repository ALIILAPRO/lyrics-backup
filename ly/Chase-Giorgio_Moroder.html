		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As the night is leaving silently retreating down an empty hall
Suddenly a stirring finally recurring where I let it fall
Following the wanderings of a dream a dream that keeps my soul alive
Believing in an open sky believing in a love

Dancing with a stranger careless of the danger there within his smile
While the dew was forming breathing in the morning like a sleeping child
If the memory of the light should fade horizons reaching cold and blue
Until your heart is free to fly then I will keep the sun for you
Until you touch the open sky then I will keep the sun for you
Until we never say goodby then I will keep the sun for you
