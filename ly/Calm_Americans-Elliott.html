		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bound to own all of our dreams. 
Intimate love affair with common man themes. 
You'll come quick and you'll come here now a fool to make it all erase. 
You stand where you fall, 

You climb when you cave, 
Your looks spent the life your body would pay. 
You're a minute thin when the time is always right. 
You've already Americanized your thoughts. 

Realize I try it's all I've got. 
It's all been Americanized that's all. 
You lead your life pretending that you're not found dead yet. 
You've already made it, 

You've already met your goal. 
You entertain take a taste and runaway with, 
It's all been Americanized that's all. 
You symbolize the message that we're all ok with, 

We all fall in bed with, 
We've all lost our sense of touch. 
Bound to own all of our dreams. 
It's all ready Americanized that's all. 

You come for suicides and breaknecks, 
It's alright I've already made my dream. 
It's alright I convince myself, 
It's over let's get it right. 

We calm ourselves with sex and games, 
It's over let's get it right. 
We calm ourselves with locks and keys, 
It's over let's get it right. 

We calm ourselves with store bought dreams, 
It's over let's get it right. 
Realize I've tried feel it's all I've got. 
It's all been Americanized that's all. 

You symbolize with a message that we're all ok with. 
We all lie in bed with, we've all lost our sense of tough. 
Bound to own all of our dreams. 
It's already Americanized that's all.
