		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love
Bleed in your own light
Dream of your own life
I miss me
I miss everything I'll never be
And on, and on 

I torch my soul to show the world that I am pure
Deep inside my heart
No more lies

A crown of horns
An image formed deformed
The mark I've borne
A mark of scorn to you

Consume my love, devour my hate
Only powers my escape
The moon is out the stars invite
I think I'll leave tonight

Soon I'll find myself alone
To relax and fade away
Do you know what's coming down
Do you know I couldn't stay free?

I shall be free
I shall be free
I shall be free
I shall be free
Free, free
Free of those voices inside me
I shall be free
I shall be free
