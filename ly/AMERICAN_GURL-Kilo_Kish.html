		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No guts, no glory
Same old figure
But different story
Can't believe
I bought what you sold me
Just a little more
Stands before me
So I run

Who are you, baby?
Who are you keeping around?
I'm changing places
So I can't see you anymore
Who are you, baby?
Will I know your face?

In a locked box, in a locked drawer
Will I find me an American girl?
American girl

Follow the leader
Bit the apple
Mastered the teacher
Broken shackles
Hang in the breezes
Heavy-hearted
And hardly breathing
I just run (just run)

Who are you, baby?
(Baby, baby, baby, baby)
Who are you keeping around?
(Around, around, around, around)
I'm changing places
(Changing, changing, changing places)
So I can't see you anymore (no more)
Who are you, baby?
(Baby, baby, baby, baby)
Will I know your face?

In a locked box, in a locked drawer
Will I find me an American girl?
American girl

Makes me feel like flying
Top down, backseat driving
Dusty road, all alone
Tip my hat
Puff of smoke, smoke
Makes me feel like flying
I just run (just run)

Who are you, baby?
(Baby, baby, baby, baby)
Who are you keeping around?
(Around, around, around, around)
I'm changing places
(Changing, changing, changing places)
So I can't see you anymore (no more)
Who are you, baby?
(Baby, baby, baby, baby)
Will I know your face?

In a locked box, in a locked drawer
Will I find me an American girl?
American girl

And I'm gone away, gone away
I don't see your face, see your face
And I'm gone away, gone away
I don't know nothing
And I'm gone away, gone away
I don't see your face
I'm tired of running

In a locked box, in a locked drawer
Will I find me an American girl?
American girl
