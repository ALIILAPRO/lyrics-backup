		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm falling in love with party, friends and alcohol
I'm falling in love with party, friends and alcohol
We falling in love with party, friends and alcohol
That's why I'm falling in love I'm falling in love
With you tonight

Spent my whole life waiting for a girl like you
Baby tell me what I got to do
We can leave this party, back to my room
You could show me a thing or two

'Cause I been spending all my money
On these pretty girls and alcohol
But honey they ain't got a thing on you

You shook me once, you shook me twice
Now take me to your paradise
You know there's just one thing left to

Let me show you I'm talking about

If you let me be your lover
I'd do anything for you
I could rock you like no other
Oh oh come on girl get loose

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

Baby shake that body, now turn around
Slow motion for me now (oh yeah)
Girl you got me going, now I'm going down
Yeah you know what I talking about

'Cause I been spending all my money
On these pretty girls and alcohol
But honey they ain't got a thing on you

You shook me once, you shook me twice
Now take me to your paradise
You know there's just one thing left to

Let me show you I'm talking about

If you let me be your lover
I'd do anything for you
I could rock you like no other
Oh oh come on girl get loose

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

I'm the mailman I deliver
Take her to dinner
Conversate a little then I split her down the middle like Miam's river
I like my women one up one down Kerry Kittles
Here's a riddle
What's the opposite of walk ? run
What's the opposite of go ? come
That means I hit it, you come
Fe fi fo fun, tear the club up!
All my sexy ladies that came to lose their minds
Put you hands up high tear the club up!
She ain't looking for me, she just looking for a really good time
That's right! tear the club up!
Let's drink that bottle and forget what we doing tonight
Tear the club up!
I ain't trying to be your lover for life just your lover tonight
That's right

If you let me be your lover
I'd do anything for you
I could rock you like no other
Oh oh come on girl get loose

If you let me be your lover
I'd do anything for you
I could rock you like no other
Oh oh come on girl get loose

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
