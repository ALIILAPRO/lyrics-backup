		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been working so hard
I'm punching my card
Eight hours for what?
Oh, tell me what I got
I've got this feeling
That time's just holding me down
I'll hit the ceiling
Or else I'll tear up this town

So now I gotta cut loose
Footloose, kick off the Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back, come on before we crack
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose

You're playing so cool, obeying every rule
Deep way down in your heart
You're burning, yearning for the some, somebody to tell you
That life ain't passing you by
I'm trying to tell you
It will if you don't even try

You'll get by if you'd only cut loose
Footloose, kick off the Sunday shoes
Ooh-wee, Marie, shake it, shake it for me
Woah, Milo come on, come on, let's go
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose

Yeah, ooh-oh-oh
(Cut footloose)
Ooh-oh-oh
(Cut footloose)
Yeah, ooh-oh-oh
(Cut footloose)
(Ooh)
(First) you got to turn me around
(Second) and put your feet on the ground
(Third) gotta take the hold of all

I'm turning loose, footloose, kick off the Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back, come on before we crack
Lose your blues (blues, yeah), everybody cut footloose

Footloose, footloose
Footloose, kick off the Sunday shoes (c'mon, girl)
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees (ohh)
Jack, get back, come on before we crack (c'mon, whoa, now)
Lose your blues, everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody, everybody cut footloose
