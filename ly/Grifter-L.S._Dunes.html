		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They lifted the monument
I couldn't find the words to say the way it felt
Ring out in the aisle
The profits gain from the disguising, the effect of it

All that divides
And all that will break you

Dependent
I believe
It all depends on it
Love, don't lock yourself away

The god in which you pray
Lay in hate
Undivided inseam
Offer of disgrace
Violent taste
All errors divine

Separated the barograph
Can't imagine the mistakes of being wrong
While the tradition would decay
All the time we spent disguising the effects of it

All that divides
All that'll make you
Never escape its power again
All that divides
All that'll break you

Flu shed
Stabilize
Just to see your dead
Love won't offer you a thing

The god in which you pray
Lay in hate
Undivided inseam
Offer of disgrace
Violent taste
All errors divine

Dragged along the ground
Violins play all around
By the weather's growing
I know you'll get wind
It's impossible to see
Make a mockery of me
Undivided inseam
All errors divine

Dependent
I believe
It all depends on it
Love, don't lock yourself away

The god in which you pray
Lay in hate
Undivided inseam
Offer of disgrace
Violent taste
All errors divine
