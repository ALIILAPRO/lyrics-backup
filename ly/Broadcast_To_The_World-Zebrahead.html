		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Brace yourself kid for the final collapse
'Cause the world is spinning fast
Coming off its axis
Fight to survive, ode lay essay
And the kids with the guns shout
"Out of my way!"
Sex and violence are here to stay
Broadcast to the world
Out of control
Ready to fold
Broadcast to the world
Out of control
I want to have it all and I want it right now
I want to have it all and I want it now

So here we go reload
Another round implode
We're spinning now until our heads explode
And so I guess we know how far we all can go
We're on a mission to destroy the world we know

The saints and the sinners
Have identity crises.
That spread like a virus
Multiplies and lysis
Down to the bottom
Looted graves they turn
Eat the razorblade apple
Open a can of worms
Narcotics on the weekends
As the city it burns

Broadcast to the world
Out of control
Broadcast to the world
Ready to fold
Broadcast to the world
Out of control
I want to have it all and I want it right now
I want to have it all and I want it now

So here we go reload
Another round implode
We're spinning now until our heads explode
And so I guess we know how far we all can go
We're on a mission to destroy the world we know

You know we all are to blame
Broadcast to the world
Final collapse is on
Heaven and Hell collided

Broadcast to the world
Final collapse is on
We stand divided

So here we go reload
Another round implode
We're spinning now until our heads explode
And so I guess we know how far we all can go
We're on a mission to destroy the world we know
