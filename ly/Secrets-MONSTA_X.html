		<p>
		  Hey, hey girl, hmm
Do you wanna tell me something? umm, eh eh

You're sipping from my glass of whiskey, and
They're playin' Whitney from the 90s, yeah
Under the red light at our table, eh
Why don't we stop the pointless convo

Wish I could read your mind (I do)
Don't wanna waste this time (it's true)
Tell me what's behind those eyes? (Yea you)
I wanna start tonight, no, no, no more lies

(I got secrets) tell me what you want
Tell me how to hold ya (hold ya)
(Dirty little secrets)
And I'll tell you something good
That I never told ya (told ya)

Baby you got me feeling high
So would you please give me a sign? (Oh will you)
Tell me what you want now, the night is over (over)
What's your secret? (yeah)

Postin' on the couch, yeh my daily routine
Ain't no clothes yeh that's what I need
You want me to slide to your side? (Slide)
Tell me then, how many times, hah

I want one, two, three to the four
We go up to the sky on the board
Flying high, yeah it's a good vibe
Everyday you're my surprise

Baby I like your style (I do)
That Mona Lisa smile (it's true)
Tell me what's behind those eyes? (Yeah you)
I wanna start tonight, no, no, no more lies

(I got secrets) tell me what you want
Tell me how to hold ya (hold ya)
(Dirty little secrets)
And I'll tell you something good
That I never told ya (told ya)

Baby you got me feeling high
So would you please give me a sign? (Oh will you)
Tell me what you want now, the night is over (over)
What's your secret?

Why are you hesitatin'
I can't hold this long, let's stop wasting (dirty little secrets)
You want to tame me
I know what you want, don't stop this gaming (you got secrets)

Hold me tight, baby don't push
We don't talk about our issue (dirty little secrets)
Just makin' pretty secret tonight
Close the door and turn off the light
No more lies

(I got secrets) tell me what you want
Tell me how to hold ya (hold ya)
(Dirty little secrets)
And I'll tell you something good
That I never told ya (told ya)

Baby you got me feeling high
So would you please give me a sign? (Oh will you)
Tell me what you want now, the night is over (over)
What's your secret? oh

Dirty little secrets (you got me so high ya, so did you?)
You got secrets
Dirty little secrets (so tell me your secrets)

What's your secret?
You got secrets
Dirty little secrets
