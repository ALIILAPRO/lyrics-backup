		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How do I look tonight?
Lit by mobile phone light
Since the other night
Feelin' my chest get tight
We could do anything
Be brave and don't let go
If I could only sing
Any song that you know

One kiss pulls me to the light
One kiss pulls me to the light

How do I feel tonight?
Light up what's lost inside
So we'll pass the time
In you, I can confide
We could do anything
Oh, when I'm feelin' low
If I could only sing
Any song that you know

One kiss pulls me to the light
One kiss pulls me to the light
One kiss steals me from my life
One kiss pulls me to the light, oh

One kiss
One kiss

One kiss pulls me to the light
One kiss steals me from my life
One kiss pulls me to the light
One kiss pulls me to the light

I wish you knew the way I feel
Because the way I feel is holding me back inside
I wish you knew the way I feel
Because the way I feel just can't be described
I wish you knew the way I feel
Because the way I feel is holding me back inside
I wish you knew the way I feel
Because the way I feel just can't be described
I wish you knew the way I feel
Because the way I feel is holding me back inside
I wish you knew the way I feel
Because the way I feel just can't be described
I wish you knew the way I feel
Because the way I feel is holding me back inside
I wish you knew the way I feel
Because the way I feel just can't be described
