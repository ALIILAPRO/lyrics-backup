		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ride with me
Don't gotta worry for the both of us
(Great John on the beat by the way)
I'll put you in the driver's seat
Don't gotta hurry in the name of love
When you ride with me, don't gotta worry when tomorrow comes
I'll put you in the driver's seat
Don't gotta worry, no, 'cause, we stay in control, in the name of love

I been in my bag way too long
Tell me if I'm doin' wrong
Yeah, I love you, but I rather be alone
Yeah, I rather be alone
I made some bad moves
I know you did bad too
It's funny, I be laughin' when I'm sad too
Baby, I'll be back soon
I get druggy in the back room
She said, "Boy, you know you bad news"
Perky keep me calm, X, it make me lash out
I don't know what's wrong
I don't know what that's 'bout
I'm just makin' hits, I treat the stu' like it's my damn house
She said, "Give me more," she said, "Make me tap out"
I don't wanna (I don't wanna), I don't wanna crash out
Lil' bro keep a stick, he clickin' shit like it's a damn mouse
I been smokin' too loud, I should keep it down
Don't know what to do now, got shit to figure out

Ride with me
Don't gotta worry for the both of us
I'll put you in the driver's seat
Don't gotta hurry in the name of love
When you ride with me, don't gotta worry when tomorrow comes
I'll put you in the driver's seat
Don't gotta worry, no, 'cause, we stay in control, in the name of love

Yeah, I know I'm bad for you, yeah, I know you bad for me
She said, "Can you get this bag for me?"
Money make her happy
Don't need nothin', if you ask me
I might slide off in the backseat
Lean got me laggin', the Addy get me goin'
I don't do the braggin', you say it, I'ma show it
Baby, I was chattin', that liquor had me flowin'
Baby, I was chattin', that liquor had me turnin'
Anxiety, you nervous
You fall in love on accident, is that your purpose?
You put in work for all this shit, but was it worth it?
I ain't tryna cry, so, I put pain inside these verses
I think it's workin'

Ride with me
Don't gotta worry for the both of us
I'll put you in the driver's seat
Don't gotta hurry in the name of love
When you ride with me, don't gotta worry when tomorrow comes
I'll put you in the driver's seat
Don't gotta worry, no, 'cause, we stay in control, in the name of love
