		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby said you had to be a lover
One way or the other
Nobody wins without once giving in
So don't cry now , don't cry now

Love is just a game you played in high school
Girls know how to be cruel
Most of the time girls are cruel to be kind
So don't cry now , don't cry now

And we try to be cool as we dance in a crowded room
At the end of the day , makin' love to a paper moon

She said , boys do fall in love , they make time
making love on a Saturday night
And she said , hearts beat as they dance
In the street to a radio , oh
Boys fall in love

Baby knows i like to be excited
No one wants to fight it
It's getting late so I'll just demonstrate
Don't cry now , don't cry now

And we try to be cool as we dance in a crowded room
At the end of the day , makin' love to a paper moon

And she said , boys do fall in love , they make time
making love on a Saturday night
And she said , hearts beat as they dance
In the street to a radio , oh

Oh , boys do fall in love ,they make time (they make time)
They get love on a Saturday night
And she said , hearts beat as they dance
In the street to a radio
Oh, boys fall in love

Boys, boys,boys....

boys do fall in love ,they make time (they make time)
making love on a Saturday night
And she said , hearts beat as they dance
In the street to a radio
Oh, boys fall in love(2x)

boys fall in love(4x)
