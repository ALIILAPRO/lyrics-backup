		  (Fuck you anthem, ah)

I ripped your clothes, I crashed your car
I smashed all your expensive art
Your conversation piece for all your
Fake ass friends who think they're rockstars

This is my fuck you anthem
I'm goin' out drunk and dancin'
Call it reckless abandon
I call it my

Fuck you anthem
Ah, ah
(Why'd I)
Fuck you anthem
Ah, ah

I ripped your clothes, I crashed your car
I smashed all your expensive art
Your conversation piece for all your
Fake ass friends who think they're rockstars

Always knew you'd ruin my life
Ruin my life, yeah
Love me, leave me, cut like a knife
Leave me to die, yeah

This is my fuck you anthem
I'm goin' out drunk and dancin'
Call it reckless abandon
I call it my
Why'd I even date you anthem
You're not even rich or handsome
Call it a temper tantrum
I call it my

Fuck you anthem
Ah, ah
(Why'd I)
Fuck you anthem
Ah, ah

Always knew you'd ruin my life
Ruin my life, yeah
Love me, leave me, cut like a knife
Leave me to die, yeah

This is my fuck you anthem
I'm goin' out drunk and dancin'
Call it reckless abandon
I call it my
Why'd I even date you anthem
You're not even rich or handsome
Call it a temper tantrum
I call it my

Fuck you anthem
Ah, ah
(Why'd I)
Fuck you anthem
Ah, ah
