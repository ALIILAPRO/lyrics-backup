		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo, yo, hold up man ay skip
All these goddamn bricks man
Hurry up, put em up there go the feds
Go!

Put the bricks in the attic
Hope the feds ain’t watching
Sniper on the roof for
You fuck niggas plotting
Yeah she spoiled rotten
She got chickens in her stocking
F & N on my side (fly) , that’s a hot pocket
Gone!

All white Charger pull up
With the police lights
Red, blue, and white, asking questions
I’ll take flight run back to my trap
Stash them bricks off in the attic
12 hit my spot, throw saran wrap and plastic
They thought they was gon' catch me slipping
Looking and searching for
Chickens and pigeons
They ain’t find shit but a
Fork in the kitchen
And a couple seeds from the
Bags full of midget finesse Takeoff
You ain’t never catch me slipping
Keep an egg beater, yeah I'm always whipping
Stay with a PT, always sipping
Young rich nigga with the all gold kitchen

Put the bricks in the attic
Hope the feds ain’t watching
Sniper on the roof for
You fuck niggas plotting
Yeah she spoiled rotten
She got chickens in her stocking
F & N on my side (fly) , that’s a hot pocket
Put the bricks in the attic
Hope the feds ain’t watching
Sniper on the roof for
You fuck niggas plotting
Yeah she spoiled rotten
She got chickens in her stocking
F & N on my side (fly) , that’s a hot pocket

I’m whipping and whipping the chicken
The bricks in the ceiling
Finesse with no feelings
The bitches they play with the water
They splashing the work and I
Call em Free Willy
Finessing the plug and I’m not gon stop
Till a young nigga hit a milli
Young nigga with banana clip (ba bow)
Niggas start peeling
Busting the bricks out the wrapper
I will pop you like a snapper
Young goon put it on your head
They’ll eat your ass like an apple
Young nigga and I’m sipping on mapple
I meant maple
50 bricks to the top of skyscrapers
My house got marijuana acres

Put the bricks in the attic
Hope the feds ain’t watching
Sniper on the roof for
You fuck niggas plotting
Yeah she spoiled rotten
She got chickens in her stocking
F & N on my side (fly) , that’s a hot pocket
Put the bricks in the attic
Hope the feds ain’t watching
Sniper on the roof for
You fuck niggas plotting
Yeah she spoiled rotten
She got chickens in her stocking
F & N on my side (fly) , that’s a hot pocket

Ay what’s happening man, you tuned in
To motherfucking Brick Squad radio
You tuned
Into Migos right now, 1017 Migos man
You know what I’m saying, at
All times I got that hot pocket
On me, all motherfucking time, you
Better believe that, gon use it if
You suckers take my soul, don’t you
