		  Feel it (feel it, feel it, feel it)
(Feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it)

Love will lift us up again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Love will lift us up again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Love will lift us up again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Love will lift us up again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

Love will lift us up
Us up again I know
Love will lift us up
Us up again I know

Love will lift us up again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Love will lift us up again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it? 
(Feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it)
(Feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it)
(Feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it)
(Feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it)

Love will lift us up again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Love will lift us up again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
