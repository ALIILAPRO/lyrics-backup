		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am so tired, I have to tame my mind before I get too frustrated
Can't go back in time to change in someone's eyes 
That I was not something to play with
Try not to talk about it, I'm too mad, I'm too late, I'm too gentle
It's too hard to explain, I'm not helpful

It's my body and I'm trying to hate you 'cause I want to
It's my body and I'm trying to while everybody loves you
It's my body and I'm trying to forgive you, I don't want to
It's my body and it hates you, why does everybody love you?

Sometimes I close my eyes amidst the dancing lights
When it feels too wild for breathing
I can't sleep at night
Unless I start to lie and believe it like a story, no no
Try not to think about it, so insane, I'm so used to my nightmares
It's ok 'til it's not and I'm back there, no no

It's my body and I'm trying to hate you 'cause I want to
It's my body and I'm trying to while everybody loves you
It's my body and I'm trying to forgive you, I don't want to
It's my body and it hates you, why does everybody love you?
Why does everybody love you?
They don't know enough about you
Do they know that I regret you?
Do they know I shouldn't have to?
Why does everybody love you?
They don't know enough about you
Do they know that I regret you?
Do they know I shouldn't have to?
