		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As long as you love me yeah
Yeah

We're under pressure
Seven billion people in the world trying to fit in
Keep it together
Smile on your face even though your heart is frowning
But, hey now, you know girl
We both know it's a cruel world, but, I will take my chances

As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, and I'll be your gold
As long as you love me
As long as you love me, love me, love me

I'll be your soldier
Fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl
I'll be your Hova
You can be my Destiny's Child on the scene, girl
Don't stress, and don't cry
We don't need no wings to fly
But just take, my hand

As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, and I'll be your gold
As long as you love me
As long as you love me, love me, love me

I don't know if this makes sense but, you're my hallelujah
Give me a time and place, I'll rendezvous it
I'll fly you to ya, I'll meet you there
Girl, you know I got you
In us, trust, a couple things I can't spell without U
Now we on top of the world, that's just how we do
Used to tell me sky's a limit, now the sky's our point of view
Now, we stepping out like oh God, cameras point and shoot
Ask me 'what's my best side?', I stand back and point at you
You, you the one that I argue with,
Feel like I need a new girl to be ballin' with
But, the grass ain't always greener on the other side,
It's green where you water it so I know,
We got issues baby, true, true, true
But I'd rather work on this with you than to go ahead and start with someone new

As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, and I'll be your gold
As long as you love me (That's all I need, that's all I want baby)
As long as you love me,(You're everything I need)
As long as you love me, you love me, you love me yeah
As long as you love me yeah, you love me, you love me yeah
As long as you love me yeah,
Yeah
