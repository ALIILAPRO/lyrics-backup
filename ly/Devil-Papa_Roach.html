		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You fought the hells now
No consequences 
Would I go touch the flame
Or would I run for the exit
I fuck this all my life
The blood shedding like never before
But I finally see your face
It's just a mirror looking back at me

My reflection is all I see

I don't wanna finish what we started
I never should've let you in
You thought I was an easy target
Now I know who you are, who the devil is
You can try to take my salvation
You can try to take everything
I'm not asleep to your temptation
'Cause I know who you are and who the devil is

There's nowhere safe to hide
I can feel your presence
But we've been waging war
Since you fell from the heavens
I fuck this every night
It feels like I've already been here before
Well, I'm looking into your eyes
And my reflection is looking back at me

And the devil is all I see

I don't wanna finish what we started
I never should've let you in
You thought I was an easy target
Now I know who you are, who the devil is
You can try to take my salvation
You can try to take everything
I'm not asleep to your temptation
'Cause I know who you are and who the devil is

I had enough of you, 'cause you took away enough from me
The lies I've lived became everything I believe
But the truth is that, the devil on you is me
The devil on you is me
The devil on you is me

I don't wanna finish what we started
I never should've let you in
You thought I was an easy target
Now I know who you are, who the devil is
You can try to take my salvation
You can try to take everything
I'm not asleep to your temptation
'Cause I know who you are and who the devil is
