		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why ya bite my head off?
Why ya bite my head off?
Why ya get so pissed off?
Why ya bite my head off now? Yeah
Come on
Why ya bite my head off?
Acting such a jerk off
Why you have to mouth off?
I got the world to worry about

Yeah, if I was a dog
Yeah, you would kick me down
I'd be spendin' the night
Howlin' 'round your house
But I ain't on a leash, yeah
Well, I ain't on a chain
You think I'm your bitch
I'm fuckin' with your brain, yeah

Why'd ya bite my head off?
Yeah
Come on
Come on

Well, life can be a riot
I can be the pilot
Provided that it's private
I got the world to worry about
What? Come on
Now you got me drinkin'
Started to stop thinkin'
The whole fuckin' ship is sinkin', sinkin'
I'm lookin' for a quick way out

Yeah, well, I'm hearin' the bark
And I'm feelin' the bite, yeah
I'm seein' the shark
I think I gotta hide
Well, I ain't on a leash
Well, I ain't on a chain
You think I'm your bitch
I'm fuckin' with your brain, yeah

Come on, Paul, let's hear something

Come on
What?

Well, why you bite my head off?
Just 'cause you are red hot?
Actin' like a despot
Why you bite my head off now?
Yeah, why you bite my head off?
Why you bite my head off?
Why you rip the bed up?
I got the world to worry about
