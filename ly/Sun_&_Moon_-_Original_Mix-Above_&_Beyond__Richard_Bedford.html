		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's raining, it's pouring
A black sky is falling
It's cold tonight

You gave me your answer
Goodbye
Now I'm all on my own tonight

But when the big wheel starts to spin
You can never know the odds
If you don't play you'll never win

We were in heaven you and I
When I lay with you and close my eyes
Our fingers touch the sky

I'm sorry baby
You were the sun and moon to me
I'll never get over you, you'll never get over me
I'm sorry baby
You were the sun and moon to me
I'll never get over you, you'll never get over me

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

You held back and lost out
You gave in to reach down
And walk away

A final embrace 
You won't turn, I won't change
Nothing more to say

But when the big wheel starts to spin
You can never know the odds
If you don't play you'll never win

We were in heaven you and I
When I lay with you and close my eyes
Our fingers touch the sky

I'm sorry baby
You were the sun and moon to me
I'll never get over you, you'll never get over me
I'm sorry baby
You were the sun and moon to me
I'll never get over you, you'll never get over me

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
