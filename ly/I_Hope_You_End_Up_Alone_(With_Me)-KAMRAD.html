		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hope you end up alone
With me
'Cause I'm a mess on my own
You see?
And I'm not good at playing love songs
But I feel bad whenever you're gone
I hope you end up

Honestly, I don't ever wanna see
You with anyone but me, I won't let it show
Now, now
And it seems, I'm already way too deep
Hate that I've been losing sleep, now who's in control?
Now, now

I'm falling for you, baby
Out of my mind, maybe
Ain't gonna lie, you should know

I hope you end up alone
With me
'Cause I'm a mess on my own
You see?
And I'm not good at playing love songs
But I feel bad whenever you're gone
I hope you end up

Honestly, I might have a tendency
Of doing what's not good for me, it's hard to let go
Now, now
Anyway, I know this is not a phase
Wanna see you every day, let's not take it slow
Now, now

I'm falling for you, baby
Out of my mind, maybe
Ain't gonna lie, you should know, oh, oh, oh
Been running away lately
Now I wanna stay, baby
I ain't gonna lie, you should know

I hope you end up alone
With me
'Cause I'm a mess on my own
You see?
And I'm not good at playing love songs
But I feel bad whenever you're gone

I hope you end up alone
With me
I hope you never let go
Of me
Call me a loser, call me crazy
But you will end up with me, baby

I hope you end up alone (oh, oh, oh, oh)
I hope you end up alone (oh, oh, oh, oh)
I hope you end up alone
I hope you end up alone
I hope you end up with me
