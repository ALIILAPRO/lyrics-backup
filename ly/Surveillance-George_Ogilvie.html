		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Depsite my glorified foresight
no one will be talking in time
once the limit was the sky
now I'm under watchful eye
until the day your thoughts align
and slow down with mine

I'm under surveillance
the path to the poet's ideal
forever amazed by the way
that you spin the wheel

it goes over your head dear
over your head, over
and I'm in way over my head here
over

Covering up behind design
for you to share your timeless cure
for peace of mind
because there's far more than meets the eye
that I've come to admire
all that you have in your sights
when I'm slowly losing mine

While I'm under surveillance
the path to the poet's ideal
forever amazed by the way
that you spin the wheel

It goes over your head dear
over your head, over
and I'm in way over my head here
over

Oh and how I long to breathe air
Oh and how I long to beathe air
long to breathe air
long to breathe air

But I'm under surveillance
the path to the poet's ideal
forever amazed by the way
that you spin the wheel

It goes over your head dear
over your head, over
and I'm in way over my head here
over

Oh and how I long to breathe air
Oh and how I long to beathe air
Oh and how I long to breathe air
Oh and how I long to breathe air
long to breathe air
long to breathe air
long to breathe air
