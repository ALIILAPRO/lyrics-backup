		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How deeply are you sleeping
Or are you still awake?
A good friend told me
You've been staying out so late

Be careful my darling
Be careful of what it takes
What I've seen so far
The good ones always seems to break

I was screaming at my father
And you were screaming at me
I can feel your anger
From way across the sea

I was kissing strangers
I was causing such a scene
Oh the heart it hurts
Such and image of unimaginable things

Grab me by my ankles
I've been flying for too long
I couldn't hide from the thunder
In the sky full of song

And I want you so badly
But you could be anyone
I couldn't hide from the thunder
In the sky full of song

Hold me down, I'm so tired now
Aim your arrow at the sky
Take me down, I'm too tired now
Leave me where I lie

And I can tell that I'm in trouble
When the music starts to play
And the cities without seasons
It keeps raining in LA

I feel like I'm about to fall
The room begins to sway
And I can hear the sirens
But I can't walk away

Grab me by my ankles
I've been flying for too long
I couldn't hide from the thunder
In the sky full of song

And I want you so badly
But you could be anyone
I couldn't hide from the thunder
In the sky full of song

Hold me down, I'm so tired now
Aim your arrow at the sky
Take me down, I'm too tired now
Leave me where I lie

I thought that I was flying
But maybe I'm dying tonight
I thought that I was flying
But maybe I'm dying tonight

I thought that I was flying
But maybe I'm dying tonight
I thought that I was flying
But maybe I'm dying tonight

Hold me down, I'm so tired now
Aim your arrow at the sky
Take me down, I'm too tired now
Leave me where I lie (fire)

Hold me down, I'm so tired now
Aim your arrow at the sky
Take me down, I'm too tired now
Leave me where I lie (fire)
