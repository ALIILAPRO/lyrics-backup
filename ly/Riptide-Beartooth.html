		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Riptide, it's a riptide
Riptide, it's a riptide

Finally frozen, no more emotion
Started escaping, now everything's numb
Dove in the deep end, stuck and I can't swim
So out of breath I know I don't have long

Yeah, this is way too much just (give me the rush)
Yeah, this is way too much just (give me the ru-)

I'm done explaining my pain
This is way too much
I wanna feel euphoria
Give me the rush

'Cause it's the last time that I romanticize
The riptide that's trying to drown me

Full of excuses for way too long
Don't wanna sing another hopeless song 
'Cause it's the last time that I romanticize
The riptide, it's a riptide

Riptide, it's a riptide
Riptide, it's a riptide

I'm so ashamed of my vicious problems
Keeping the worst of me all to myself
It's overwhelming not ever telling
The ones I love that I've gotta find help

Yeah, this is way too much just (give me the rush)
Yeah, this is way too much just (give me the ru-)

I'm done explaining my pain
This is way too much
I wanna feel euphoria
Give me the rush

'Cause it's the last time that I romanticize
The riptide that's trying to drown me

Full of excuses for way too long
Don't wanna sing another hopeless song 
'Cause it's the last time that I romanticize
The riptide, it's a riptide

Don't wanna die
I guess I gotta let it go
Don't wanna die
I guess I gotta let it go

I'm done explaining my pain
This is way too much
I wanna feel euphoria
Give me the rush

'Cause it's the last time that I romanticize
The riptide, yeah

I'm done explaining my pain
This is way too much
I wanna feel euphoria
Give me the rush

'Cause it's the last time that I romanticize
The riptide that's trying to drown me

Full of excuses for way too long
Don't wanna sing another hopeless song 
'Cause it's the last time that I romanticize
The riptide, it's a riptide

Riptide, it's a riptide
Riptide, it's a riptide
