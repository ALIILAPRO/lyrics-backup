		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I broke my nose
Bled on my clothes
Woke up in the vicious sun
On the steps of my front door
And I took one look
And turned around
I felt the death
I heard the black dog gaining ground

Burning daylight, daylight, daylight
Daylight, yeah
Shut up mind, shut up soul
Let me burn myself a hole
Burning daylight, daylight, daylight
Daylight, yeah
Shut up body, I'm on a roll
Let me burn myself a hole

I close my eyes
On highways sides
In rooms of smoke and yellow light
Where handsome men are brutalized
Where no one lives
And no one dies
We just wait and look for ways
To disappear behind our eyes
Oh, yeah
Another honest man gets burned alive

Burning daylight, daylight, daylight
Daylight, yeah
Shut up mind, shut up soul
Let me burn myself a hole
Burning daylight, daylight, daylight
Daylight, yeah
Shut up mind, I'm on a roll
Let me burn myself a hole

Hey
Yeah
Yeah

I took one look
And turned around
I felt the death
I heard the black dog gaining ground

Burning daylight, daylight
Daylight, daylight
Burning daylight, daylight
Daylight, daylight

Burning daylight, daylight, daylight
Daylight, yeah
Shut up mind, shut up soul
Let me burn myself a hole
Burning daylight, daylight, daylight
Daylight, yeah
Shut up body, I'm on a roll
Let me burn myself a hole
