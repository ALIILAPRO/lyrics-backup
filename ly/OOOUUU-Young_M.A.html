		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo bro, I think I had too much Hennessy, man
This Hennessy getting to me
I ain't gon' lie, I'm a little smizz
I'm a little drizz
But we in the club man, ooh

Yeah, they hate but they broke though (they broke though)
And when it's time to pop they a no-show (where they at?)
Yeah, I'm pretty but I'm loco (yeah, I'm loco)
The loud got me moving slow-mo (shhh)
Ayo Tweetie, where the hoes bro? (Where the hoes bro?)
Ayo Keys, where the hoes though? (Yo, where the hoes tho?)
That other nigga, he a bozo (he a bozo)
It's M.A, you don't know, ho? (You don't know, ho?)
We got liquor by the boatload (that Henny)
Disrespect the Lyfe that's a no-no (that's a no-no)
All my niggas dressed in that rojo (Redlyfe)
I ride for my guys, that's the bro code (that's the bro code)
Baby, gave me head, that's a low blow (that's a low blow)
Damn, she make me weak when she deepthroat (when she deepthroat)
I need a rich bitch not a cheap ho (not a cheap ho)
They be on that hate shit, I peep though (yeah, I peep though)
My brother told me fuck 'em, get that money sis (yo, fuck 'em)
You just keep on grinding on ya hungry shit (uh-huh)
Ignore the hate, ignore the fake, ignore the funny shit (ignore the funny shit)
'Cause if a nigga violate, we got a hunnid clips (brrat)
And we go zero to a hunnid quick (woo)
We just them niggas you ain't fucking with (oh no)
Pockets on a chubby chase (uh?)
And still could bag a thottie in some bummy shit (ooh)
Yerr Eli, why they testing me? (Yo, why they, uh?)
Like I don't always keep the hammer next to me? (Like I don't keep that)
Like I ain't got a hitter to the left of me? (I ain't got a hitter)
Like we ain't in these streets more than Sesame? (Woo)
If that's your chick, then why she texting me? (Yo, why she texting me?)
Why she keep calling, my phone speaking sexually? (Woo)
Every time I'm out, why she stressing me? (Yo, why she stressing me?)
You call her Stephanie? (You call her, huh?) I call her Headphanie (ooh)
I don't open doors for a ho (no, no, no)
I just want the neck, nothin' more (no, nothin' more)
Shawty make it clap, make it applause (yeah, make it clap)
When you tired of your man, give me a call (give me a call)
Dyke bitches talking out they jaw (yo, what you said?)
Next minute, calling for the law (woop-woop)
This .9'll have them calling for the Lord (rrah)
They ain't getting shmoney so they bored (man, they bored)
I could never lose, what you thought? (Man, what you thought?)
M.a got it on lock, man of course (man of course)
They say I got the juice, I got the sauce (I got the sauce)
These haters on my body shake 'em off (I shake em' off)
Pussy I'm a bully and a boss (man, I'm a boss)
I'm killing them, sorry for your loss (R.I.p)
I just caught a body, Randy Moss (ooh)
Now this year I'm really going off (I'm going off)

Ooh
Ooh
These haters on my body, shake 'em off
Ooh
Ooh
Ahh, these haters on my body shake 'em off
Ooh
Ooh
These haters on my body shake 'em off

I could never lose what you thought? What they thought?
I could never lose what you thought?
This Henny got me, it got me sauced
This Henny got me, ooh, it got me sauced
I could never lose what you thought?
M.a got it on lock, man, of course
Ooh
Ooh
