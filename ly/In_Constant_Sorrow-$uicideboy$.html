		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Serious shit, no playin', ho
Break yo'self, hit the floor, hit the floor
Ho-ish ass nigga, I'm just tired of this talking shit
Serious shit, no playin', hoe
Keep poppin' off at the mouth
Ho-ish ass nigga, I'm just tired of this talking shit
Break yo'self, hit the floor
Get your fucking wig split

Ruby keep pullin' these hoes, all over the globe
But still I'm in love with the shit up my nose
All of the money, the cars and the clothes
It comes and it goes
One day, I'll be ready to gather my bones, dig me a hole
Say goodbye, as my two eyes start to close
But then they ain't even closed
Some of y'all leave me alone (leave me alone)
Who the fuck gon' copy us?
No stopping us, she blocked me 'cause
I'm stocking up on find some sluts
And shoddy cuffs, no roxy dust
I'm Oddy Nuff
The next bitch who wan' lock me up
I'm knockin' up
The rope in my hand keeps knotting up
I'm so tired of thinking I'm not enough
Not enough, not enough (ho-ish ass nigga, I'm just tired of this talking shit)

Serious shit, no playin', ho
Keep poppin' off at the mouth
Ho-ish ass nigga, I'm just tired of this talking shit
Break yo'self, hit the floor
Get your fucking wig split

Pull up in a drop top, high (why?)
People tryna take what's mine (who?)
People I call my friends (where?)
People I call my fam, god damn
Speed dial my style for a fix (when?)
Right now I don't wanna hear shit (wait, what?)
I tell the ho, take off before I cut the dope off
Livin' too deep in a dream
I've been, I've been
I've been dreaming of a reason not to paint the fucking ceiling
With my brains, and my pain, that's just how the fuck I'm feeling
I don't fuck with feeling worthless
Is this God thing really working?
No point of searching for a purpose
Meet me at my surface
Meet me at my surface
Meet me at my surface

I never knew people could be so evil (serious shit, no playin', ho)
I don't leave here, y'know? (Keep poppin' off at the mouth)
(Break yo'self, hit the floor)
Haven't gone outside for years
I have a job over the phone, I help the people with the computers
Order anything I want on the internet, got TV
That's not a bad life
