		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take my hand
Take my hand

Say your prayers, little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone
Tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
'Til the sandman, he comes

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
We're off to never-never land
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
We're off to never-never land

Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite, yeah

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land

(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)

(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh) take my hand
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake (free from sin)
I pray the Lord my soul to take

Hush, little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beast under your bed
In your closet, in your head

Hush, little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beast under your bed
In your closet, in your head

Hush, little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beast under your bed
In your closet, in your head

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land, yeah

(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
We're off to never-never land

(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
