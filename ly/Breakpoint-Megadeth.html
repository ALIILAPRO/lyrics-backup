		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Make up the rules for me to live by 
Rules you break and just let it slide 
You try and find you inside of me 
Be as great as you want me to be 
Hypocrite, the word that fits 
Do as you say 
Not as you do 
You're pushing me to a breakpoint 
Pushing me to a breakpoint 
Pushing me to a breakpoint 
Pushing me, push, push me to a breakpoint 
Self esteem you seem to lack 
Point the finger 
There's three pointing back 
Control's the illusion with all good intent 
Bad times are contagious 
You laugh and infect 
Criticist, the word that fits 
Put me down to lift you up 
Watching pain's your only pleasure 
Fascination for sick disaster 
Suffering since you were born 
Mess with the bull and you get the horns. 
Misery, the word that fits 
Times are good when times are bad 
"In my opinion as a professional I recommend we straight-jacket the son of a 
bitch, lock him in a rubber room, sedate him, heavily, and when he wakes up, if 
he wakes up, we'll see if he can be a nice boy" 
"Well... I don't know... It's gonna hurt me more than it's gonna hurt him" 
"Let's do it!" 
"Sedate me? Cool! a straight jacket? Hey, hey, let go of me!" 
You push me to a breakpoint 
Push me to a breakpoint 
Push me to a breakpoint 
Don't push me, you piece of shit!
