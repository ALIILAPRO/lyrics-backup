		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah (go, go, go, go)
(Turn the lights on)

Whoa lover, don't you dare slow down
Go longer, you can last more rounds
Push harder, you're almost there now
So go lover, make mama proud (turn the lights on)

(And when we're done) I don't wanna feel my legs
(And when we're done) I just wanna feel your hands all over me baby
But you can't stop there (whoa, lover)
Music still playin' in the background (whoa, lover)
And you're almost there
You can do it, I believe in you, baby
So close from here

Baby, I'ma be your motivation (uh-huh, yeah)
Go, go, go, go, motivation
Go, go, go, go

Uh, gi-girl I turn that thing into a rainforest
Rain on my head, call that brainstorming
Yeah, this is deep, oh, but I go deeper
Ma-make you lose yourself, and finders keepers
It go green light, g-g-go Weezy go
I like to taste that sugar, that sweet and low
But hold up, wait, new position
I put her on my plate, then I do the dishes
She my motivation, I'm her transportation
'Cause I let her ride while I drive her crazy
Th-then I just keep going, going, like I'm racing
When I'm done, she hold me like a conversation, Weezy, baby-baby

But you can't stop there (whoa, lover)
Music still playin' in the background (whoa, lover)
And you're almost there
You can do it, I believe in you, baby
So close from here

Whoa, lover, when you call my name
No other, can do that the same, no
I won't let ya get up out the game, no
So go lover, don't it make me rain

(And when were done) I don't wanna feel my legs
(And when were done) I just wanna feel your hands all over me baby
But you can't stop there (whoa, lover)
Music still playin' in the background (whoa, lover)
And you're almost there
You can do it, I believe in you, baby
So close from here

Baby, I'ma be your motivation
