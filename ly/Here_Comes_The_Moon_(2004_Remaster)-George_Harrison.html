		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody's talking up a storm
Act like they don't notice it
But here it is and here it comes 
Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon.

Impulse always quickens when it's full
As it turns my head around me
Yes it does and here it comes
Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon.

God's gift I see that's moving up there into the night 
Though dark the mirror in the sky reflects us our light:
Looks like a little brother to the sun
Or mother to the stars at night
And here it is and here it comes
Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon.

Breath is always taken when it's new
Enhance upon the clouds around it
Yes it is and here it comes
Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon.
