		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ain't got no home, ain't got no shoes
Ain't got no money, ain't got no class
Ain't got no skirts, ain't got no sweaters
Ain't got no perfume, ain't got no love
Ain't got no faith

I ain't got no culture, ain't got no mother
Ain't got no father, ain't got no brother
Ain't got no children, ain't got no aunts
Ain't got no uncles, ain't got no love
Ain't got no mind

Ain't got no home
Ain't got no home
Ain't got no home
Ain't got no home
Ain't got no home

Ain't got no home
Ain't got no home
Ain't got no home
Ain't got no home
Ain't got no home

Ain't got no home
Ain't got no home
Ain't got no home
Ain't got no home
Ain't got no home

I ain't got no country, ain't got no schooling
Ain't got no friends, ain't got no nothing
Ain't got no water, ain't got no air
Ain't got no smokes, ain't got no chicken

Ain't got no water, ain't got no love
Ain't got no air, ain't got no God
Ain't got no wine, ain't got no money
Ain't got no faith, ain't got no God
Ain't got no love

Ain't got no home
Home
Home
Home

Home
Home
Home
Home
