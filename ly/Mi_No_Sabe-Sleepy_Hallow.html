		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mi no sabe, mi no sabe
Mi no sabe, mi no sabe
Mi no sabe, mi no sabe (it's Great John beats, baby)
Mi no sabe, mi no sabe (Great John on the beat, by the way)


Bitch I'm unlike most (uh-huh), keep a gun right close
Put my shooter on green, he'll blow (that's facts)
Even on a red light, he'll go
Pull up with a mop, I'm tryna clean 'em up (huh)
Don't got it, I'm beatin' 'em up (that's facts)
Fuck all the opps, they never keepin' up
No broom, I sweep 'em up, hol' on, wait (huh)
Big body whip, I might crash the Wraith
I give a fuck what a hater say, just know that Sleepy gettin' paid today, ayy
Turn up, huh, new opp pack, let's burn up, huh
Brand new kicks, can't scuff 'em
I spent like fifty on drip for the summer
Nah you buggin', we spent like a hundred (you trippin')
AMG, push it, I love it, huh
We let off shots and they thought we was drummin'
Free smoke, just pull up if you want it
She like, "Sleepy, you all in my stomach"
Nut in her eye, she gon' see that shit comin'
Fuck the fame, I ain't changin' for nothin'
Fuck the fame, I ain't changin' for nada
Still'll clap a nigga, on my mama
I got a thirty clip just for the drama, ayy
Huh, wait, huh

Act like they love me, I know they some liars, ayy
Huh, hol' on, huh
Pop me a 30, Perkys get me higher
Mi no sabe, mi no sabe
Mi no sabe, mi no sabe
Mi no sabe, mi no sabe
Mi no sabe, mi no sabe
