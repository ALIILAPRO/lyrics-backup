		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All I wanna do is stay right here on the floor
Get lost in the night
And dance like there's no tomorrow
Don't care about the sunrise
Somebody please just hit the lights
All I wanna do is dance like there's no tomorrow

Today just wasn't my day
Everyone's getting me so fed up
I've gotta find a way
I know what can make me feel better
Stepping out in my best
Looking hotter than ever
Wherever the party is
That's where I'll be in a second

I'm so ready to move my body
Forget about all my problems
When I hear that song
I'ma lose control
Hey, here I go

All I wanna do is stay right here on the floor
Get lost in the night
And dance like there's no tomorrow
Don't care about the sunrise
Somebody please just hit the lights
All I wanna do is dance like there's no tomorrow

I'm loving the atmosphere
Feels like I'm floating in heaven
The music's all in my ear
Taking over me
My heart's racing
Feeling so Hollywood
How I got everybody staring

Their eyes are the cameras
And I'm loving all the attention

Get up, 'bout to move my body
Forget about all my problems
They're playing our song
I'ma lose control
Hey, here I go

All I wanna do is stay right here on the floor
Get lost in the night
And dance like there's no tomorrow
Don't care about the sunrise
Somebody please just hit the lights
All I wanna do is dance like there's no tomorrow

Please DJ
Don't say it's the last one
Cause I know what it means
And I don't want you to play no slow song
I'm still building the nerve to talk to that guy
Just give me another song and make it right

All I wanna do is stay right here on the floor
Get lost in the night
And dance like there's no tomorrow
Don't care about the sunrise
Somebody please just hit the lights
All I wanna do is dance like there's no tomorrow

All I wanna do is stay right here on the floor
Get lost in the night
And dance like there's no tomorrow
Don't care about the sunrise
Somebody please just hit the lights
All I wanna do is dance like there's no tomorrow
