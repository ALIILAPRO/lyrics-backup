		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I lay myself upon the floor
We're not all dying here
Well, maybe I don't need it after all
It was a place for me to rest my head

And all the books upon your shelf
Tell stories of who we are
But there's more to the picture here
I will play it on your broken guitar
I will play it on your broken guitar

The night is for remembering
The morning is for starting again
You are for remembering
I will remember you
When I forget

I've never seen a light like this
This is how you love
I've never known a light like yours
This his how I love

The night is for remembering
The morning is for starting again
You are for remembering
I will remember you
When I forget

Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

The night is for remembering
The morning is for starting again
You are for remembering
I will remember you
When I forget

The night is for remembering
The morning is for starting again
You are for remembering
I will remember you
When I forget
