		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do, re, mi, fa, so
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
It's Gucci
Do, re, mi, fa, so
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, if I could go back to the day we met
I probably would just stay in bed
You run your mouth all over town
And this one goes out to the sound
Of breaking glass on my Range Rover
Pay me back or bitch, it's over
All the presents I would send
Fuck my friends behind my shoulder
Next time I'mma stay asleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep, oh

And you got me thinking lately
Bitch, you crazy
And nothing's ever good enough
I wrote a little song for ya
It go like

Do, re, mi, fa, so fuckin' done with you, girl
So fuckin' done with all the games you play
I ain't no Tic-tac-toe
Send the X and O's on another note
I'm do, re, mi, fa, so fuckin' done with you, baby
So send the X and O's on another note, I'm ghost
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh)

Ha, it's Guwop
Do re mi, baby, don't play me
I'm a black beatle like Jimmy, Swae Lee
Screaming "Fuck 12" in my brand new V
Just bought a time piece for my new dime piece
When I'm balling, don't stall it, put your all in
Stop talking, gotta crawl in before you walking
On the weekend, spending front end and the back end
Booty so big, got me thinking 'bout a lap dance
Pull up with these bitches like, "Damn, what happened?"
New thang, new frame, new eyelashes
Brand new swag, wearing brand new fashion
That's what you get for doing all that camping
Blackbear with me and we in the state trapping
This'll make a old legend start back rapping
This'll make a [?] start back trapping
I'mma beat it up like my name Joe Jackson (it's Gucci)

Do, re, mi, fa, so fuckin' done with you, girl
So fuckin' done with all the games you play
I ain't no Tic-tac-toe
Send the X and O's on another note
I'm do, re, mi, fa, so fuckin' done with you, baby
So send the X and O's on another note, I'm ghost
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh)

If I could go back to the day we met
I probably would've stayed in bed
You wake up everyday
And make me feel like I'm incompetent
Designer shoes and Xanax tabs
Compliments your make-up bag
You never had to buy yourself a drink
'Cause everybody want to tap that ass sometime

And you got me thinking lately
Bitch, you crazy
And nothing's ever good enough
I wrote a little song for ya
It go like

Do, re, mi, fa, so fuckin' done with you, girl
So fuckin' done with all the games you play
I ain't no Tic-tac-toe
Send the X and O's on another note
I'm do, re, mi, fa, so fuckin' done with you, baby
So send the X and O's on another note, I'm ghost
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh)

(So send the X and O's on another note, I'm)
Do, re, mi, fa, so
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
So send the X and O's on another note, I'm ghost
