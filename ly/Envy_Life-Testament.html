		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In regards to the nature used with pacts of magic
Spirits from the vastly deep
Respond the calls from their broken silence
Make sure your reach does not exced your grasp
All that is to be done before you act
In a pact of invoking spirits from the past

Have you lost your mind
The dark souls of time
Ending life!
Ending life!

They see you calling out their names and getting ready
Chant in darkness shrouding near
Through your virtued youth they'll strike a deal
What's to obtain if no pain no gain
But to sell your soul you must be insane
Wrote your name in blood and then they came

You're as good as dead
The lost souls of time
Envy life!
Envy life!

Come on down to the house of pain
You hear them calling
Shouting out their names in vain. envy life!

In regards to the nature used with pacts of magic
Spirits from the vastly deep
Respond the calls from their broken silence
Make sure your reach does not exceed your grasp
All that is to be done before you act
In a pact of invoking spirits from the past

You're as good as dead
The lost souls of time, envy life, envy life! envy life, envy life!
