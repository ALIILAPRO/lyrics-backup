		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Three times the echoes of my name
How could someone not turn insane
What made you leave, what made you go
Long road, long time ago

Whistling your lifelong song
Solace is your lifelong song
Whistling your lifelong song
Solace is your lifelong song

You fenced yourself from the crowd
Black water, far as eyes can see
Clear metal taste in your mouth
Nights howl
Are you invited or not, 'til dawn?

Three times the echoes of my name
Can one man be an island
I want to leave, I want to go
A long way, like you taught me so

Whistling your lifelong song
Solace is your lifelong song
Whistling your lifelong song
Solace is your lifelong song
