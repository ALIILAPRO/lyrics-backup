		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Her name is Lara, we learned a lotta
How to do it like we do it, like we wanna
We just know, we just know
I ain't one sided, I'm open-minded
I'm fifty-fifty and I'm never gonna hide it
You should know, uh
You should know, ay

All summer, we've been in the pool
'68 Chevy with nothing to do
Just rolling J's, kush loving
And last night, yeah, we got with a dude
I saw him, he was lookin' at you
So I said ay, kush loving

Sometimes, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
Sometimes, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls

You know I tamed it, and then I named it
I put the lion in the cage
And then I laid with her all night, her all night, ay
Yeah, I'm a hunter and she the prey yeah
I'm the thriller and the killer
And the savior up all night, we up all night
(Do it one more time) yeah

All summer, we've been in the pool
'68 Chevy with nothing to do
Just rolling J's, kush loving

Sometimes, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
Sometimes, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
You know that I do
Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls

She getting down with me, yeah-ah
She getting down with me, yeah-ah
She getting down with me, yeah-ah
Oh, we can go up
She getting down with me, yeah-ah
She getting down with me, yeah-ah
She getting down with me, yeah-ah

Rita!
Look, Cardi
Now I could be your lipstick just for one night (one night)
Girls just wanna have fun, they have their funds right (yeah)
I mean, say my name, say my name, say my name (say my name)
It tastes good just running up your tongue, right? (hurrr)
I put this MAC on your lips, so pucker up (mwah)
We ain't never heard of you 'cause you ain't done enough
And I don't gotta introduce myself (Cardi)
I'm too sexy, I seduce myself (Bardi)
Seven figure, never need a nigga (nope)
I steal your chick, have her down with the scissor
Tonight, I don't want a dog, I want a kitten
I might french a girl from Great Britain

Sometimes, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls (oh yeah)
Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
Sometimes, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls (yeah)
Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls

She getting down with me, yeah-ah
She getting down with me, yeah-ah
She getting down with me, yeah-ah
She likes, she likes (aha)
She getting down with me, yeah-ah
She getting down with me, yeah-ah
She getting down with me, yeah-ah
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls
