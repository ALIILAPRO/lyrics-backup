		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the darkest night, huh
I make the bad guys fall, huh
There's a million heroes
But I'm the best of them all, yeah

Who has the coolest gadgets? (Batman!)
Who has the tricked out ride? (Batman!)
Who does the sickest backflips? (Batman!)
Nananananana Batman, yeah!

Hey, hey, Batman yeah!
Hey, hey, Batman yeah!
Hey, hey, Batman yeah!
Dada dada dada dada Batman, yeah!

You think my muscles are big? (Thanks)
You haven't seen my brain, huh
Ladies, it's okay if you stare (Why?)
'Cause I'm a billionaire

And this is me playing guitar also

I get the last laugh
I get the final grin
Throw you into the asylum with Harley Quinn
Turn Two-Face, to black-and-blue face
I 100% am not Bruce Wayne, yeah

Who is the manliest man? (Batman!)
With the buns of steel? (Batman!)
Who could choke hold a bear? (Batman!)
Who never skips leg-day? (Batman!)
Who always pays their taxes (NOT Batman!)

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Batman
Batman, Batman, Batman, I'm Batman
Hey, hey, Batman yeah!
Hey, hey, Batman yeah!
Hey, hey, Batman yeah!
Dada dada dada dada Batman!

Who has the coolest gadgets? (Batman!)
Who has the tricked out ride? (Batman!)
Who does the sickest backflips? (Batman!)
Nananananana Batman, nananananana

Who is the manliest man? (Batman!)
With the buns of steel? (Batman!)
Who could choke hold a bear? (Batman!)
Nananananana, nananananana
Who never skips leg-day? (Batman!)
Who always pays their taxes (NOT Batman!)
Nananananana, nananananana, yeah
