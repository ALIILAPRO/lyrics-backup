		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why do you worry?
Why does it mean so much to you?
Whatever the reason
Close your eyes now

What do you carry?
What do you think is best for you?
Wherever you're going
You'll always be the same I pray

Say,
Have you ever seen that place
Have you ever been to monkey cage?
Why does it have to fade
Said you'll never stray away
Said you'll never stray away
Have you ever seen that place
Have you ever been to monkey cage?
Why does it have to fade
And I wanted you to stay
'Cause I wanted you to stay

How do you judge me
How can you put yourself aside
Wherever you're hiding
You'll always think of me, I pray

Say,
Have you ever seen that place
Have you ever been to monkey cage?
Why does it have to fade
Said you'll never stray away
Said you'll never stray away
Have you ever seen that place
Have you ever been to monkey cage?
Why does it have to fade
And I wanted you to stay
'Cause I wanted you to stay
Have you ever seen that place
Have you ever been to monkey cage?
Why does it have to fade
Said you'll never stray away
Said you'll never stray away

When I'm high
She's near and she says yeah, yeah, yeahâ€¦
