		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Welcome, won't you come inside?
Leave the ghost where I reside
Despite how they're refusing me
Lonely, I don't ever be
Comfort in the hell I know
Resentment like a cancer grows
Longing for the day I'm free
Burning gets you out of me

Lying, supplying the need
Shedding and spreading the seed
Setting the trap with a thread
Spinning the web

Misery, she needs me
Oh, oh, but I need her more
Misery, she loves me
Oh, oh, but I love her more
Misery, she kills me
Oh, oh, but I end this war
Misery, she fills me
Oh no, but she's not what I'm living for

Ricochets within my head
Conversations never said
Magnifyin' every thought
That familiar pain she brought
Seeps inside eventually
Misery loves company
Sullen, I created you
I suppose that I could end you too

She wakes (she wakes, she wakes, she wakes)
She wakes (she wakes, she wakes, she wakes)

Misery, she needs me
Oh, oh, but I need her more
Misery, she loves me
Oh, oh, but I love her more
Misery, she kills me
Oh, but I end this war
Misery, she fills me
Oh no, but she's not what I'm living for, oh no
Oh, misery

She needs me
But I need her more
She loves me
But I love her more
She kills me (she kills me)
But I end this war
She fills me (she fills me)
But she's not what I'm livin' for

Oh no, oh no
No, no, no, no, no, no
Not why I'm livin'

Misery, she needs me
Oh, oh, but I need her more
Misery, she loves me
Oh, but I love her more
Misery, she kills me
Oh, but I end this war
Misery, she fills me
Oh no, but she's not what I'm livin' for

Misery, my misery
Misery, my misery
Misery, she's not why I'm livin' (my misery)
She's not why I'm livin'
Misery, she's not what I'm livin' for, no, no (my misery)

Thank you, good night
That was the best one
Yeah man, yeah Lars
That button was the best one
The best button
