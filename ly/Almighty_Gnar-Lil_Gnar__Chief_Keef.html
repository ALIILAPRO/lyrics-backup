		  (Damn, stupid dummy)

I love some doughties (damn)
Talkin' Olympians, bitch, I got trophies (yeah)
Call me broksi (no)
Give your ass that Kobe, you try backdoor me (bang, bang, bang)
Skokie (Skokie)
Bitch, I'm from the Southside ain't from Skokie
Call me Smokey
We ready if the opps think they can smoke me
These bitches dirty
Where I'm from, you get a pistol for dirt cheap
A McFlurry
Bitch, my fuckin' wrist are McFlurry
Like a jersey
We'll leave your t-shirt like a jersey (on God)
Did ya heard me? (Bang, bang, bang, huh, huh)

43B (what?)

I just-I just copped some brand new Marni (damn, yeah)
I just-I just blew some bands at Onyx (bands and Onyx)
I just took the stand and lied to your honor (on God, Sos' baby)
She gon' come to crib and give me that body (damn)
I keep a big FN, I be with piranhas (grr)
I just copped a Lamb' truck, fuck yo Honda (ayy, skrt skrt skrt)
Lil Gnar like a doctor, he be medicated (un un, meds)
I need my money now, I ain't got no patience

Blicky hit his chin like Monkey Pox, it get messy (Sos' baby)
I get work from Mexico, I'm plugged with the ese
Caught that boy slippin' with the lead like a X-ray (X-ray)
Got your bitch squirtin' while she ridin' like a jetski (I got jet')
I feel like I'm Chief Keef in 2012 (bang bang)
All these bitches say they love me, I pour Wocky by myself
I just want some sloppy, told the thotty keep her pants on
Gave my youngin' twenty, told him slide with the shiest' on (grr)
Grown ass man, paid the bills, I keep the light on (damn)
Shit getextra sticky, FN blicky with the sights on
G-I-A, certified don't do rhinestones (ya dig?)
B-I-G, Big Guap, know I handle biz'
Half a million on Gnarcotic shoes, I done got Nike pissed (I did)
I done put the east side on my back, they fuckin' love the kid
I ran up these commas out the mall just like a cleat (what?)
When my granny died, it broke my heart, I turnt to beast (swag)
Short thick purple hair bitch, call her Wockiana
Only time I cheat on her is when I'm with my Glockiana (bang bang bang)
Slide with some ahks, they on they deen, I'm finna pop a lil' bean
Choppin' the top off of the 'Rari, call it a guillotine (yeah yeah)
Run with some zoes, sak pase, they talkin' 'bout, "N'ap boule"
Goyard bags come from France, talkin' 'bout my, "Mon Cheri"
Hellen Keller, if you ain't talkin' 'bout money, I'ma deaf man
I just got a chain and a whip, I'm like "Fuck the clan" (beep)

I just-I just copped some brand new Marni (copped some brand new Marni)
I just-I just blew some bands at Onyx (I jus-I just)
I just took the stand and lied to your honor (on God)
She gon' come to crib and give me that body (damn)
I keep a big FN, I be with piranhas (bang, bang)
I just copped a Lamb' truck, fuck yo Honda (ayy)
Lil Gnar like a doctor, he be medicated (yeah)
I need my money now, I ain't got no patience

Bang, bang, bang
(Dig)
