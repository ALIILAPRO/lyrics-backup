		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fiendish wonder in the carnival's wake 
Dull caresses once again irritate
Tread softly, stranger 
Move over toward the danger that you seek 

You think excitement has receded then the mirror distracts
The logic of the trance quickly reaches and grasps
Handsome and faceless
And weightless, your imagination runs

And now it's no one's fault but yours 
At the foot of the house of cards 
You thought you'd never get obsessed 
You thought the wolves would be impressed 
And you're a sinking stone 
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweler's hands 
That procession of pioneers all drowned 

In the moonlight they're more thrilling 
Those things that he knows 
As he leads you through the grinning 
Bubble blowers in the snow 
Watching his exit 
Was like falling off the ferry in the night 

The inevitables gather to push you around 
Any other voice makes such a punishing sound
He became laughter's assassin 
Shortly after he showed you what it was 

And now it's no one's fault but yours 
At the foot of the house of cards 
You thought you'd never get obsessed 
You thought the wolves would be impressed 
And you're a sinking stone 
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweler's hands 
That procession of pioneers all drowned 

If you've a lesson to teach me
I'm listening, ready to learn 
There's no one here to police me
I'm sinking in until you return 

If you've a lesson to teach
Please don't deviate, don't be afraid 
Without the last corner piece, I can't calibrate
Let's get it ingrained 

If you've a lesson to teach me
I'm listening, ready to learn 
There's no one here to police me
I'm sinking in until you return 

If you've a lesson to teach
Please don't deviate, don't be afraid 
Without the last corner piece, I can't calibrate
Let's get it ingrained 

If you've a lesson to teach me
I'm listening, ready to learn 
There's no one here to police me
I'm sinking in until you return 

If you've a lesson to teach
Please don't deviate, don't be afraid
