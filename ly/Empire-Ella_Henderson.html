		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Build on life and we'll

I see your lie
I know it's coming and I'm terrified
No more defenses here to hide behind
Oh, just you and I
And through the smoke,
I see you're burning like a ray of hope
I found the fire and now the ashes glow
Oh, come alive
And now that I'm awake
I'm not afraid, I'm letting go tonight

'Cause we found strength in each others arms
We built this life and we made it our
Empire, empire, empire
And you and I, can rule each others hearts
We'll build on life and we'll make it our
Empire, empire, empire

Stone by stone, we'll build a tower up and call our own
So high the world forget the world below
Oh, just you and I, high
So let the drums roll
The cannons blow, we're letting go tonight

'Cause we found strength in each others arms
We built this life and we made it our
Empire, empire, empire
And you and I, can rule each others hearts
We'll build on life and we'll make it our
Empire, empire, empire

They'll never take it down, take it down
Burn it down, burn us down
Take it down, take down our empire
They'll never take it down, take it down
Burn it down, burn us down
Take it down, take down our empire

'Cause we found strength in each others arms
We built this life and we made it our
Empire, empire, empire
And you and I, can rule each others hearts
We'll build on life and we'll make it our
Empire, empire, empire

They'll never take it down, take it down
Burn it down, burn us down
Take it down, take down our empire
