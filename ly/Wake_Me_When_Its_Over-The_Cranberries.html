		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Trying to forget
Something that you know
It hasn't killed you, yet
But you cannot let it go
Trying to exist
Trying not to scream
How it does persist
Entrapped inside a dream

Fighting's not the answer
Fighting's not the cure
It's eating you like cancer
It's killing you for sure

Wake me when it's over
Wake me when it's over
Wake me when it's over
Wake me when it's over, ah

Living in the past
It's difficult to hide
Some things will never last
When you're swallowing your pride

Fighting's not the answer
Fighting's not the cure
It's eating you like cancer
It's killing you for sure

Wake me when it's over
Wake me when it's over
Wake me when it's over
Wake me when it's over

Watch the rain drop
Watch the rain drop
Watch the rain drop
Watch the rain drop
Watch the rain drop
Watch the rain drop
Watch the rain drop

So wake me when it's over
Wake me when it's over
Wake me when it's over
Wake me when it's over
Wake me when it's over
Wake me when it's over
Wake me when it's over
Wake me when it's over, ah
