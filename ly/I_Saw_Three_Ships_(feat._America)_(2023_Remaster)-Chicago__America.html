		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw three ships come sailing by
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day.
I saw three ships come sailing by
On Christmas Day in the morning.

And what was in those ships all three
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day?
And what was in those ships all three
On Christmas Day in the morning?

The Virgin Mary and Christ were there
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day.
The virgin Mary and Christ were there
On Christmas Day in the morning.
