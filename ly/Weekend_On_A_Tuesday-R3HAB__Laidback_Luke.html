		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It goes on and on
It's been like this all along
People runnin' 'round and 'round in circles
Afraid of doin' wrong

I wanna go left when everybody go right
I wanna be free and do whatever I like
Yeah, nobody knows what tomorrow holds
So let's live now, let's live now

I'm like, weekend on a Tuesday
Let's hit the club and then we lose it
Don't wanna wait until Friday
Yeah, I'm like, weekend on a Tuesday
I'm like, weekend on a Tuesday
Let's hit the club and then we lose it
Don't wanna wait until Friday
Yeah, I'm like, weekend on a Tuesday

Nothin' ever change
Feel we're caught up in a cage
So busy doin' all the same routines
Like there's no other way
Yeah, yeah

I wanna go left when everybody go right
I wanna be free and do whatever I like
Yeah, nobody knows what tomorrow holds
So let's live now, let's live now

I'm like, weekend on a Tuesday
Let's hit the club and then we lose it
Don't wanna wait until Friday
Yeah, I'm like, weekend on a Tuesday
I'm like, weekend on a Tuesday
Let's hit the club and then we lose it
Don't wanna wait until Friday
Yeah, I'm like, weekend on a Tuesday
