		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just like the water flowing
in the river
Just like when the spring has
to turn to summer
Feels like the song
youre always in my hair
As long as youre smiling
that is all I care
Sometimes it hurts
like growing pain
At times it makes me cry
like the rain
But Id cross the ocean
if I have to
Id run through the storm
to get to you right now
Its so natural to love you
Just like the gravity
that's pulling me down
Im always gon be right there
to hold you down down down
Just like the song
you're my ribbon in the sky
As long as youre with me
that is all I care
Sometimes it hurts
like growing pain
At times it makes me cry
like the rain
But Id cross the ocean
if I have to
Id run through the storm
to get to you right now
Its so natural to love you
So natural to love you
So natural to love you
So natural
So natural to love you
To love you
