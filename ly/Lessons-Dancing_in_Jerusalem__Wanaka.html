		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's few things more painful then
Watching someone you once loved
Saw walking away from you
And one of this things is the realization
This is just nothing that you can do
To get them, to get them
Back in your arms
I'm sorry I coudln't be
The one that you want me to be
I made my own false hopes
And my false prophecies
Now my heart it ain't broken
It just bruised
But it still hurts
I'm saying goodbye to you
And I don't know is it for now or forgot
Sometimes things happen although we don't want them
Maybe sometimes they should
Maybe missing a person
This is missing the way
That you're so were in the past
That greatest lesson that i've ever learned
Was learning that great things don't last
There's few things more painful then
Watching someone you once loved
Saw walking away from you
And one of this things is the realization
This is just nothing that you can do
To get them, to get them
Back in your arms
