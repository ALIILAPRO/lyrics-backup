		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something's happening, don't speak too soon
I told the boss off and made my move
Got nowhere to go

Son of Sam, son of the shining path, the clouded mind
The couple killer, each and every time

I'm not uncomfortable feeling weird
Lonely leered, options disappeared
But I know what to do

Son of Sam, son of a doctor's touch, a nurse's love
Acting under orders from above

King for a day

Son of Sam, son of the shining path, the clouded mind
The couple killer, running out of time

Shiva opens her arms now
To make sure I don't get too far
I may talk in my sleep tonight 'cause I don't know what I am
I'm a little like you, more like son of Sam
