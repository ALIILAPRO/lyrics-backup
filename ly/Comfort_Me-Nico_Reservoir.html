		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been thinking about you a lot lately
And I just want to let you in know
I love it when you text me late at night you know it's right
I got the mattress ready girl let's put up a fight
Get physical right away keep it extra tight
Don't worry about the mood I got them night lights
Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
You know I'm a selfless gentlemen is all about you
This feeling is running deep in the skin tattoo
Hot showers tonight will help us get loose
Let's get this loving now
Let's turn it up real loud
Let's take a water break
Then go another round
You know I don't play no games
Unless it's bed games
I'm on that boss level
With the perfect aim
Contemplating your beauty is my only escape
Feeling your body close to me making me want to stay
So lost in each other where did the time go
Tonight I might reconsider being Romeo
I want to get lost in your eyes
I want you right by my side
I want you all for me
So come home and comfort me
I want to get lost in your eyes
I want you right by my side
I want you all for me
So come home and comfort me
I know you mad at me cause I went M.I.A
I had to figure out some things before the summer break
I had to make a couple calls and get some issues straight
I hope that you believe me when I say I want you to stay
I'll switch it up for you and make these wrongs right
Breakfast in bed scrambled eggs with the extra spice
Fruit bowl for the soul with the juice on the side
Stick around for dinner I'll lit the candle lights
A put your favorite movie the one that makes you smile
The one you told me you haven't seen in a while
That one that you love how they dress with the killer style
And by the end of it you ready to go wild
Chocolate covered strawberries your favorite dessert
Got my fingers ready baby tell me where it hurts
Full body massage just to get your body relaxed
Back it up for me you know I'm in love with that hahaha
I want to get lost in your eyes (lost in your eyes)
I want you right by my side (right by my side)
I want you all for me (all for me)
So come home and comfort me (comfort me)
I want to get lost in your eyes (lost in your eyes)
I want you right by my side (right by my side)
I want you all for me (all for me)
So come home and comfort me (comfort me)
I don't even got to say it baby
You know I love every bit of you
So come thru
I got the whole day plan out for you
Fuck it
I got the whole week
The whole month
The whole year
And everyday got your name on it (just for you)
Come thru baby
I miss you
