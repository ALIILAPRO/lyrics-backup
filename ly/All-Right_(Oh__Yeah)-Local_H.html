		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All Right, Oh Yeah

Here We Go I'm Back Again
Act Suprised When I Come In
It's Only Me
It's Only Stupid Me

You Could Never Figure Out
What Was All The Fuss About
I Know It's Only Me
It's Only Stupid Me
Stupid Me

Alright, Oh Yeh

Sickle Cell, Anemia,
Carpal Tunal, and Bilemia
Dont Get Sick
It's Only Stupid Me

You Think You Got The Real Deal
Damaged Goods Are Such A Steal
Serves You Right
It's Only Stupid Me
Only Stupid Me

Well Alright

Alright, Oh Yeah

I See You Comin' Round Again
Push Aside And Muscle In
When Everything Is Said And Done
It's Only Stupid Me
Stupid Me

Alright, Oh Yeah
