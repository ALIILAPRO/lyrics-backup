		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You take away my every breath I take
And if you love me, for heaven's sake
Please put an end to this heartache

Don't you hold me, don't you hold me down
Don't you leave it, on this broken ground
If you love me, if you love me now
Don't you hold me, don't you hold me down

Run from ya
My sweet love, can't believe I'm gonna
Run far away from ya to hide my pain

Don't you hold me, don't you hold me down
Don't you leave it, on this broken ground
If you love me, if you love me now
Don't you hold me, don't you hold me down

Don't you hold (hold me down, hold me down)
Don't you hold (love me now, love me now)
Don't you hold (hold me down, hold me down)
Don't you hold

Don't you hold
(don't you hold) , don't you hold me down
Don't you hold
(don't you hold) , on this broken ground
If you love, if you love me now
Don't you hold me, don't you hold me down

(Don't you hold me, don't you hold me down
Don't you leave it, on this broken ground
If you love me, if you love me now
Don't you hold me, don't you hold me down)
