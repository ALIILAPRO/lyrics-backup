		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The day I first met you
You told me you'd never fall in love
But now that I get you
I know fear is what it really was

Now here we are, so close, yet so far
Haven't I passed the test?
When will you realize
Baby, I'm not like your ex?

Don't wanna break your heart, wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong, like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live and there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break

Your heart a break, let me give your heart a break
Your heart a break, oh yeah, yeah

On Sunday, you went home
Alone, there were tears in your eyes
I called your cell phone
My love, but you did not reply

The world is ours if we want it
We can take it, if you just take my hand
There's no turnin' back now
Baby, try to understand

Don't wanna break your heart, wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong, like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live and there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break

Your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break (heart a break)
Your heart a break, there's just so much you can take (heart a break)
Give your heart a break (heart a break)
Gonna give your heart a break (heart a break)
Your heart a break, oh yeah, yeah

When your lips are on my lips
Then our hearts beat as one
But you slipped out of my fingertips
Every time you run
(Every time you run)

Don't wanna break your heart, wanna give your heart a break (don't wanna break your heart)
I know you're scared it's wrong, like you might make a mistake (I know you're scared it's wrong)
There's just one life to live and there's no time to wait, to waste (to waste)
So let me give your heart a break
'Cause you've been hurt before, I can see it in your eyes
You try to smile it away, some things you can't disguise
Don't wanna break your heart, baby, I can ease the ache, the ache (the ache)
So let me give your heart a break

Your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break (heart a break)
Your heart a break
There's just so much you can take (so much you can take)
Give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break (heart a break)
Your heart a break
Oh yeah, yeah

The day I first met you
You told me you'd never fall in love
