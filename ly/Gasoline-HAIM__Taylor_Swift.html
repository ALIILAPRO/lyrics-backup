		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You took me back but you shouldn't have
Now it's your fault if I mess around
I took a drag but I shouldn't have
Now I'm coughing up like I've never smoked a pack

Gasoline, pretty please
I want to get off but you're such a tease
Throw the keys back to me
Go on and kick off your boots
In the passenger seat

I get sad, you know I get sad
And I can't look past what I'm sad about
You did me bad (did me bad, did me bad)
And I did it back (did it back, did it back)
You needed ass, well, what's wrong with that?

Gasoline (gasoline)
Pretty please (pretty please)
I want to get off (gasoline)
But you're such a tease
Throw the keys (throw the keys)
Back to me (back to me)
Go on and kick off your boots (gasoline)
In the passenger's seat

(Strike a match, strike a match, watch it blow)
We're watching the sunrise from the kitchen counter
(Want you bad, want you bad, don't you know?)
When you're lying between my legs, it doesn't matter
(Strike a match, strike a match, watch it blow)
You say you want to go slower but I want to go faster
(I want you bad, want you bad)
Faster and faster

Gasoline, pretty please
I want to get off but you're such a tease
