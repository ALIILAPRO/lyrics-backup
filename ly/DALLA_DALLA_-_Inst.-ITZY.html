		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  People look at me and they tell me
You need to tone it down 'cause you look like you're trouble (no, no)

So what? Don't give a damn
I'm sorry, I don't care, don't care
Really don't care b-b-b-because

Don't need Prince Charming, ain't got time for love
Yeah I'm just out here looking for some fun
Unni's all over me
They say I'm young and naive
(I'm sorry, sorry) I'm never gonna grow up

Don't bring me down 'cause I dare to be different
I'm a little dalla dalla dalla
Not gonna change who I am for your comfort
So watch and learn, I'll show you what I'm about

I love myself
'Cause I'm so dalla dalla yeah
I love myself
'Cause I'm so dalla dalla yeah
Yeah I'm so dalla dalla

Bad bad, I'm sorry I'm bad
I'm just the way I am
Too busy carpe diem-ing all day
Drown out the haters, they'll never dictate my life (my life)
You better check yourself, mal-li-ji-ma (mal-li-ji-ma)
'Cause I'm one of a kind, yeah

Look in the mirror, loving what I see
Don't hold me back, 'cause I'm just living free
Unni's all up in arms
'Cause they say I'm rude and too blunt
(I'm sorry, sorry) I'm never gonna change me

Don't bring me down 'cause I dare to be different
I'm a little dalla dalla dalla
Not gonna change who I am for your comfort
So watch and learn, I'll show you what I'm about

Don't care what people say, I got nothing to prove
I'm talking to myself, don't you let it get to you
So shake it off, look up to the sky
Just keep on dreaming oh

Keep your chin up, we got your back
Keep your head up, just keep on dreaming (yeah)
Keep your chin up, we got your back
Keep your head up, just keep on dreaming

Everybody
Don't bring me down 'cause I dare to be different
I'm a little dalla dalla dalla
Not gonna change who I am for your comfort
So watch and learn, I'll show you what I'm about

I love myself
'Cause I'm so dalla dalla yeah
I love myself
'Cause I'm so dalla dalla yeah
Yeah I'm so dalla dalla yeah
