		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
And I get a feeling that I never, never, never
Never had before, no, no, hey
And I, and I, I just wanna tell y'all, I said y'all
I believe, I believe, I believe

Something got a hold on me, yeah, yeah
Oh, it must be love
Something got a hold on me right now
Oh, it must be love

Let me tell, I never felt like this before
Something got a hold and it won't let go
Believe I'd fly if only I could
Sound so strange, sure it's good

I said whoa, I said whoa
I said whoa
Aha-ho, aha-hey, yeah
Hey, now it must be love

Let me tell you now
Something got a hold on me, yeah, yeah
Oh, it must be love
Something got a hold on me right now, yeah, child
Oh, it must be love

Something's got a hold and it won't let go
Believe I'd fly if only I could
