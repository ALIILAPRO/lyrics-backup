		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you think I'm faking
When I'm lying next to you?
Do you think that I am blind
Nothing left for me to lose?
Must be something on your mind
Something lost and left behind
Do you know I'm faking now?

Do you know I'm faking
When I'm lying next to you?
Do you know that I am blind to everything you ever do?
Must be something on your mind
Something lost for me to find
Do you know I'm faking

Then she told me she had a gun
it sounded like she'd used it once before on him
Then she told me she had a gun
it sounded like she'd used it once before, oh man

I guess you know I'm faking
When I tell you I love you
I guess you know that I am blind
To everything you say and do
Must be something on my mind
There's nothing left for me to hide
Do you know I'm faking

Then she told me she had a gun
it sounded like she'd used it once before on him
Then she told me she had a gun
it sounded like she'd used it once before, oh man

We have to succumb to the feelings we can never face
I need you, I breathe you
I can't go through this all again
We have to succumb to
The feelings we can never face I need you
I breathe you, I can't go through this

Then she told me she had a gun
it sounded like she'd used it once before

Then she told me she had a gun
it sounded like she'd used it once before on him
Then she told me she had a gun
it sounded like she'd used it once before, oh man
Then she told me she had a gun
She says she wants to use it on me now
