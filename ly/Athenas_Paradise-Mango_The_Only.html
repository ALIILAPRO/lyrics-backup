		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm on my stallion
I'm in love
With-with you
I'm on my stallion, when I'm in love
I smoke italian, that's indica
Where's calabasas, comin through
Queen of the asses, how she move
Lemme take off my glasses, ain't bein rude
Put that pussy in a casket, deja vu uh
Como tale vu uh
Excuse em wa
Que-Quien eres tu uh
Nanimonai
Lemme get my bread straight, bitch I'm broke
I been eatin cup of noodles everyday, where my hoe?
Bitch I'm so pissed, that now it's pretty cold
Bitch I'm so pissed, that now it's pretty cold
I don't got no fur, on top of my coat
Collar, uh
Guala, where my money at?
Yeah, where should we go, on with you yuh
Do not lie to me uh, only tell me truths yuh
Where can we go uh, on with you yuh
Do not lie to me yuh, only tell me truths
I'm on my stallion, when I'm in love
I smoke italian, that's indica
Yeah, everything you touch turns to gold
If you choose to run away, that'll leave me with a ghost
Writing letter check the post, corazon goes to froze
All eggs in one basket
I believe in us and if you won't then that's tragic
Gimme couple months then we could see what's happening
Got me goin nuts, I'll take it with me to the casket
The thing he choke me
Cus I'm a dope fiend
They do not talk to me, cus they don't like me
If only you could see, what the fuck I see
It would be easy, to never overthink
The thing he choke me
Cus I'm a dope fiend
They do not talk to me, cus they don't like me
