		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fine (Daytrip took it to ten)

Say they wanna read my mind
They really wanna read my mind
Telling you right now, all you'll find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
They say they wanna read my mind
Do you really wanna read my mind?
I promise, all that you will find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind

I know I have a purpose, but I don't see the purpose
They tell me the death of me gon' be the Perkys
I know they lace pills, I bought them on purpose
Life's unreal and death's uncertain
It's funny how the blessed ones had the most curses
Heart falling to the floor if we lose another person
Take three more, I swear it's worth it
But it ain't no world tour if I'm laying in a hearse
I remember losing little bro, he laying in the dirt
Now I'm bound to drop a tear or two on every single verse
Good terms, bad terms, when they die, it's the worst
Sometimes when I'm high, I feel high in reverse
I ain't going out like that, you fuck with me, you get the work
You ain't gon' see me in no wooden box, I'm gonna shoot 'em first
I promise y'all I'm finna touch the world, yeah, I'ma touch the Earth
But hold on, your girl on my line, I think I may just fuck her first
Yeah, gotta have some crude humor
Just to keep a good vibe going, keep the song grooving
So all my money longer, shout out bro Uzi
Keep my eyes in the sky 'cause that's where I'm moving

Say they wanna read my mind
They really wanna read my mind
Telling you right now, all you'll find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
They say they wanna read my mind
Do you really wanna read my mind?
I promise, all that you will find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind

Is a lost soul, rich and blind
Blind, blind, blind

This is dedicated to you if you felt the lowest of the low
I know how it feels, you don't wanna struggle anymore
Used to ball hard, ain't no triple-doubles anymore
Bitch, I'm talking 'bout my tears
Turned around and faced my fears
I haven't felt this low in years
We die in three like musketeers
Ain't too many real niggas left in here
R.I.P. to all my peers
Smoking loud pack, what you say? I can't hear
But I still hear the fallen ones in my ears
Why, why do we live to die, die?
When it's my time, time, time
I'll leave behind my end, my 13 Reasons Why

Say they wanna read my mind
They really wanna read my mind
Telling you right now, all you'll find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
They say they wanna read my mind
Do you really wanna read my mind?
I promise, all that you will find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind

Is a lost soul, rich and blind
Blind, blind, blind
