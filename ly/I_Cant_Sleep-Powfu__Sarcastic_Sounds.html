		  Hey what's the matter honey?

I don't sleep cause when I do
All my dreams are dreams of you
And in yours you say your teeth are falling out
Oh I don't sleep cause when I do
All I dream are dreams of you
And in yours you say your teeth are falling out

Oh yeah
Yes, I threw away my phone in case you'd ever call
I never leave my house in case I meet you at the mall
I never talk to my friends that you're friends with
Because I know they're gonna ask why we ended
Anything to do with you I keep it on the low
Used to wish that you would stay now I'm wishin' you would go
So I came up with a remedy I promise I would keep
In order to ignore you I'll just never fall asleep

I don't sleep cause when I do (when I do)
All I dream are dreams of you (they all of you)
And in yours you say your teeth are falling out, oh (yeah yeah)
I don't sleep cause when I do
All I dream are dreams of you
And in yours you say your teeth are falling out, oh yeah

I haven't slept in like a year, me fear keeps me awake
Cause if I doze off I might see you face to face
I just turn on my TV and sit straight up on to my couch
Cause when I doze off I hear the words from your mouth
Used to wake up uncontrollably crying like every time
Getting shivers, feeling sick, whenever you would cross my mind
So I came up with a remedy I promise I would keep
In order to ignore you I just never fall asleep

I don't sleep cause when I do
All I dream are dreams of you
And in yours you say your teeth are falling out
Oh I don't sleep cause when I do
All I dream are dreams of you
And in yours you say your teeth are falling out, oh
