		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh I remember how it felt when you'd look at me.
With all the love and memories we used to share.
I thought I'd knew you and then you turn around and leave me,
We fell in love then fell apart in no time.

I never thought that you would lie and then betray me.
Till I opened up my eyes and saw the truth.
I know I tried, Lord knows I tried to hold on, to hold on.
Then you let it go.

You let it go

I tried to hold on.

Then you let it go, why?

Ay, You let it fall, you let it fall apart.
You let it fall, you let it fall apart.
You let it fall, you let it fall apart.
You let it fall, oohooh.

I'm picking up all of the pieces that you've broken.
Have you ever even seen the mess you made?
And you can tell me that you never meant to hurt me.
You didn't think, you didn't think of me at all.

At all, You didn't think of me at all.
You didn't think of me at all.
Look what you've done to who we were, yeah.

I never thought that you would lie and then betray me.
Till I opened up my eyes and saw the truth.
I know I tried, Lord knows I tried to hold on, to hold on.
Then you let it go.

You let it go

I tried to hold on.

Then you let it go, why?

Ay, You let it fall, you let it fall apart.
You let it fall, you let it fall apart.
You let it fall, you let it fall apart.
You let it fall, oohooh.
