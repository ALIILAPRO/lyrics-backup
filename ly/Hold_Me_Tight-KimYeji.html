		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm seeing through your eyes 
And know what's on your mind 

Don't say it for now 
Just stay silent under my shadow

It's just a petty game 
But I won't let you down 
Let go all your sorrow in my arms 

Why do you still hesitate? 
promised not to let you down
I know you don't want to let me go

Don't say a thing 
I'm right next to you 
Close your eyes
fumble my shadow and heart 

Too far away 
To go back a time
Close your eyes 
Just feel the lose my mind


I'm seeing through your eyes 
And know what's on your mind 

Don't say it for now 
Just stay silent under my shadow

It's just a petty game 
But I won't let you down 
Let go all your sorrow in my arms 

Why do you still hesitate? 
promised not to let you down
I know you don't want to let me go


Don't say a thing 
I'm right next to you 
Close your eyes
fumble my shadow and heart 

Too far away 
To go back a time
Close your eyes 
Just feel the lose my mind


Oh find the lost hours of our love
I will never leave your side
These feelings won't fade
hold me tight


Don't say a thing 
I'm right next to you 
Close your eyes
fumble my shadow and heart 

Too far away 
To go back a time
Close your eyes 
Just feel the lose my mind
