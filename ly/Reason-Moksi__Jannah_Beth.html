		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Too Much Space Can Break Us, No One Else To Blame. Growing Apart Takes Ages, Love Can Turn To Hate.
Cause Every Time The Seasons Change, Yes I'll Remember You.
I'll Come Back To You,
Like We Always Do.
On My Own,
On My Way To Healing. You Let Me Go,
Gave Me What I Needed. On My Own,
On My Way To Healing. You Let Me Go,
Gave Me What I Needed.
Parts Of You Have Stayed Here, We Left Our Prints Together.
They Might Wash Away,
But They Remain With Me Forever.
Cause Every Time The Seasons Change, Yes I'll Remember You.
I'll Come Back To You,
Like We Always Do.
On My Own,
On My Way To Healing. You Let Me Go,
Gave Me What I Needed. On My Own,
On My Way To Healing. You Let Me Go,
Gave Me What I Needed.
On My Own,
On My Way To Healing. On My Own,
On My Way To Healing. On My Own,
On My Way To Healing. On My Own,
On My Way To Healing.
On My Own,
On My Way To Healing. You Let Me Go,
Gave Me What I Needed. On My Own,
On My Way To Healing. You Let Me Go,
Gave Me What I Needed.
