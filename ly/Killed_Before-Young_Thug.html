		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We got London On Da Track

Everyone know I've been killed before
I've been bent like a centerfold
I crap with my money, no
Drop the top, get a breeze, ohh
Got four million in jewelry, ohh
Let that money fly to the ceiling, whoa
Did you pay someone's tuition, no (whoa)
Do you own a store? No (whoa)

Yeah, fuck all this bullshit (SLATT)
Diamonds for all us kings, yeah
Got my money went Ludacris (let's go)
Give some racks to a hood bitch
Give some racks to a pulpit
Look at the grain, it's wood bitch
On the floor, it's a wool bitch
She suck dick like a whole tick (come on)
Diamonds on me, they cold as shit
I thank God that I went legit (and what)
When we see 'em, you know we blitz (and what)
I can bet up, you know I'm rich (leggo)
Shut the fuck up, nigga bet up, you say you rich
Different color diamonds, I'm a peacock
Different color diamonds, I'm a peacock
Spot full of birdies with no treetop
You know you my son, you can be that
I bought the boat, the jetskis
Got a FN and a stick, don't test me
I stacked them hunnids up to God's knees
Ain't going broke until 2070

Everyone know I've been killed before
I've been bent like a centerfold (whoa)
I crap with my money, no
Drop the top, get a breeze, oh
Got four million in jewelry, oh
Let that money fly to the ceiling, whoa (whoa)
Did you pay someone's tuition? No (whoa)
Do you own a store? No

We ain't letting these bitches get between us
We ain't letting no monkey niggas stand that close to us (close to us)
I ain't got no heart when it come down to my bro, yeah
She is not my dresser, she just irons my clothes, yeah (thanks)
Pulled off in a Tesla, pulled back in a Porsche, yeah
Bought the Maserati, you'll get burnt like toast, yeah
I get on that bullshit, you'll get it started, yeah (started)
Six kids with me, didn't think bout abortions, yeah (ayy)
I took a thottie outta Magic, took her to the pent, then I ooh ooh
Ayy, the private jet came with a stewardess, like ooh ooh
Ready for war like a machine
Came from pillies to post schemin'
Now I got fifty hoes on they knees
I put X in my codeine
But I'm putting nothing in my weed
Yeah, I took a jet right overseas
I want some head from overseas
I caught a case, my jewelry seized
I started out with fifty ki's
My Bentayga clean like bleach
On a yacht with blue water and blue cheese
On this shit like fleas, ayy

Everyone know I've been killed before
I've been bent like a centerfold (whoa)
I crap with my money, no
Drop that top, get a breeze, oh
Got four million in jewelry, oh
Let that money fly to the ceiling, whoa (whoa)
Did you pay someone's tuition? No
Do you own a store? No

Ayy, I took a thottie outta Magic, took her to the pent, then I ooh ooh
Ayy, the private jet came with a stewardess, like ooh ooh
