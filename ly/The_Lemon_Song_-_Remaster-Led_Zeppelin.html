		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I should have quit you long time ago 
Ohh yeah, long time ago
I wouldn't be here, my children 
Down on this killin' floor

I should have listened, baby, to my second mind
Ohh, I should have listened, baby, to my second mind
Every time I go away and leave you, darling 
You send me the blues way down the line, ohh

Babe, yeah
Treat me right baby 
Oh my, my, my
Alright, take it down a bit
People tellin' me baby can't be satisfied
They try to worry me baby 
But they never hurt you in my eyes
Said, people worry baby, I can't keep you satisfied

Huh, let me tell you baby
You ain't nothin' but a two-bit, no-good jive
I wwent to sleep last night, I worked as hard as I can
I bring home my money, you take my money, give it to another man
I should have quit you, baby
Oh, such a long time ago
I wouldn't be here with all my troubles 
Down on this killing floor

Squeeze me baby, 'till the juice runs down my leg
Squeeze me baby, 'till the juice runs down my leg
The way you squeeze my lemon, I
I'm gonna fall right out of bed, bed, bed, bed, yeah

Hey 
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, you
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Hey, babe, hey, babe, babe

I'm gonna leave my children down on this killin' floor
