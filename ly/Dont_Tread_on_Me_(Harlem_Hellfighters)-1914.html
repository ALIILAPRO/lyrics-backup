		  Don't Tread on Me (Harlem Hellfighters)

My name is private Johnson, Im from AEF
The 369th Infantry Regiment
From Harlem to France, from ghetto to trench
And honestly, here's not much difference
May 15-th, An enemy patrol around twenty huns
Me and a box of grenades, I throw it all
Then took up my rifle, Cmon

191 days under fire,
Never retire
Men of Bronze
Go forward or die
Hold one's ground
That's why they call us
Hellfighters

God knows I give as good as I got
The fucking Labelle had a magazine clip of just three rounds and I fired it all
There was no time for reloading. I swung my rifle and brought it down with a thrown blow upon the enemys head. He went down, crying, and close-in fighting began
I stabbed one Jerry in the stomach, felled a lieutenant, and took a pistol shot in my arm before driving his knife between the ribs of a soldier who had climbed on my back

I killed four boches and wounded maybe ten or maybe five more cant count it well
The only weapon left is my bolo knife
So I climbed up from the ground and charged,
Hacking away at the foes
There wasn't anything so fine about it.
Just fought for my life. A rabbit would have done that.
