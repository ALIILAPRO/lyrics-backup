		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Honesty, really is the hardest thing
And all the twisted truths you bring won't let me in
Tell me how it ends
I long to be bold enough for bravery
'Cause this mess you made of me has gravity
Enough to hide the lie you kept so long
Of how you did me wrong

But I don't want this fight
Put your hands in mine
Hold me and close and move with me
Remember how we used to shine?
I don't want this fight
Set the words alight
Just hold me and close and move with me with every beat
Remember how we used to shine?

Look for me, I'm not somewhere out of reach
We're like two ships lost at sea, there's got to be
More to this than rivalry, I know
'Cause we're not made of stone

And I don't want this fight
Put your hands in mine
Hold me and close and move with me
Remember we used to shine?
I don't want this fight
Set the words alight
Just hold me and close and move with me with every beat
Remember how we used to shine?

Remember when you stayed 'round?
Remember when you showed me how
To dance all night? To cry out loud?
Remember when our love was new?
Remember what I said to you?
"You're all I want", well, that's still true

I don't want this fight
Put your hands in mine
Hold me and close and move with me
Remember we used to shine?
I don't want this fight
Set the words alight
Just hold me and close and move with me with every beat
Remember how we used to shine?

Remember when you stayed 'round?
Remember when you showed me how
To dance all night? To cry out loud?
I don't want this fight
Remember when our love was new?
Remember what I said to you?
"You're all I want", well, that's still true

I don't want this fight
