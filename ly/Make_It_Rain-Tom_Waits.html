		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She took all my money
And my best friend
You know the story
Here it comes again
I have no pride
I have no shame
You gotta make it rain
Make it rain!

Since you're gone
Deep inside it hurts
I'm just another sad guest
On this dark earth

I want to believe
In the mercy of the world again
Make it rain, make it rain!

The night's too quiet
Stretched out alone
I need the whip of thunder
And the wind's dark moan

I'm not Able, I'm just Cain
Open up the heavens
Make it rain!

I'm close to heaven
Crushed at the gate
They sharpen their knives
On my mistakes

What she done, you can't give it a name
You gotta make it rain
Make it rain, yeah!

Without her love
Withour your kiss
Hell can't burn me
More than this
I'm burning up all this pain
Put out the fire
Make it rain!

I'm born to trouble
I'm born to fate
Inside a promise 
I can't escape
It's the same old world
But nothing looks the same
Make it rain!
Make it rain!

Got to make it rain
Make it rain
You got to make it rain
Got to make it rain
You got to

I stand alone here!
I stand alone here!
Sing it:
Make it rain!
Make it rain!
