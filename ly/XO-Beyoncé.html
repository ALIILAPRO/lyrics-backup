		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Flight controller is here is looking very carefully at the situation)
(Obviously a major malfunction)

Your love is bright as ever 
Even in the shadows 
Baby, kiss me
Before they turn the lights out
Your heart is glowing
And I'm crashing into you
Baby, kiss me
Before they turn the lights out
Before they turn the lights out
Baby, love me lights out

In the darkest night hour (in the darkest night hour)
I search through the crowd (search through the crowd)
Your face is all that I see
I give you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
You can turn my lights out

We don't have forever
Ooh, baby daylight's wasting
You better kiss me
Before our time has run out
Mm, yeah
Nobody sees what we see
They're just hopelessly gazing, oh
Oh, baby take me, me
Before they turn the lights out
Before our time has run out
Baby, love me lights out

In the darkest night hour (in the darkest night hour)
I search through the crowd (I search through the crowd)
Your face is all that I see
I give you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
You can turn my lights out

I love you like XO
You love me like XO
You kill me, boy, XO
You love me like XO
All that I see
Give me everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
You can turn my lights out

In the darkest night hour (in the darkest night hour)
I search through the crowd (I search through the crowd)
Your face is all that I see
I give you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
You can turn my lights out
