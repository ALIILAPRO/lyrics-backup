		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're setting off,
It's time to go, the engine's running
My mind is lost,
We always knew this day was coming
And now it's more frightening than it's ever gonna be

We grow apart,
I watch you on the red horizon
Your lion's heart
Will protect you under stormy skies
And I will always be listening for your laughter and your tears

And as soon as I can hold you once again
I won't let go of you, I swear

We lived through scars this time
But I've made up my mind
We can't leave us behind anymore

Your hands are cold,
Your lips are turning blue, you're shaking
This fragile heart,
So heavy in my chest, it's breaking
And in the dark, you try to make a pay phone call to me

But you're miles away,
You're breaking up, you're on your own
It's hard to take,
I need an hour just to say hello
But I can't make the truth of this work out for you or me

And for all the pennies in your pocket
We barely get a second just to speak

We lived through scars this time
But I've made up my mind
We can't leave us behind anymore

We'll have to hurt for now
But next time there's no doubt
'Cause I can't go without you anymore

Oh, no, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Yeah yeah

We lived through scars this time
But I've made up my mind
No, we can't leave us behind anymore

We'll have to hurt for now
But next time, there's no doubt
'Cause I can't go without you anymore
No I can't go without you anymore
