		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's your bedside table
At the end of the day
Like an overnight ICU stay
She's not only able
She knows no other place she'd runaway
She wants to stay
I'll bookmark our place
I'll solve the mystery that we'll never know
I'll type up our fate
I'll write the story we get
And we'll get to go
Rest for me and I'll press play on every song you gave
Let it be my choice to make some magic at our grave
Cuz I can be your paperweight
I am your ashtray
Let me be where you lost your place
A crumpled final page
A crumpled final page
Let me say go
I'm a pillow
You're a cloud and you can't stay now
You gotta go
I'm the lampshade that gives a little glow
Let me say go
I'm a pencil
Listening, I took down every note
Let me say go
Before I didn't know
This is the part where you love so you let them go
She's your bedside table at the end of the day
Like a legend a father can make
Tell me if you're able
If your story's too late, take to the grave
Is mine the same
The CMO's in place
The conversation of her and little moans
Translate anyway
She doesn't know how she knows, but she knows
I'll find every hand to shake
Pull every string in place
Answers in my voice will come
In not possible ways
Cuz I'm your carpenter, always
I am your deejay
Be your own table, take my place
And un-crumple the page
Un-crumple the page
Let me say go
I'm a pillow
You're a cloud and you can't stay now
You gotta go
I'm the lampshade that gives a little glow
Let me say go
I'm a pencil
Listening, I took down every note
Let me say go
Before I didn't know
This is the part where you love so you let them go
