		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know what I wish?
It was just you and me,
Sitting in this corner bar
You could tell me how your are
But I'm not gonna lie,
Or anything...
You don't even have to speak,
If you keep looking at me

Well I could go all night,
But they're turning up the lights
It would be so easy,
(To) do or say anything
And I'm not gonna lie
I'm not looking for love...
I won't let you in my heart
But you were always on my mind
