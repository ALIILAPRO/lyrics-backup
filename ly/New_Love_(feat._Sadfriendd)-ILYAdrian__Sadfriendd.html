		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl what's the issue? What you on
You the only one that I really want
You know, dropping all these thots
You got me lost in my thoughts
Oh shit, looking for my guap
Oh shit, ain't looking for the WAP
Oh shit, singing all my songs
Oh shit, don't do me wrong
Girl what's the issue? What you on
You the only one that I really want
You know, dropping all these thots
You got me lost in my thoughts
Oh shit, looking for my guap
Oh shit, ain't looking for the WAP
Oh shit, singing all my songs
Oh shit, don't do me wrong
Like damn bitch, wassup
You the only one that I really want girl
Diamonds on me dancing on my wrist
Don't mean to stunt girl
If they want smoke ima light em like a blunt
Aye
We can run it back, run it back
Shorty back up, she was talking silly now
But I know she bad luck
Wait, she a city girl, she wanna act up
But on the low he wanna fuck a lil bit
I'm a hater for talking all your bullshit
Shorty wanna talk and I'm acting like I'm cool with
Looking for a badass bitch, not a cool kid
Can you be there by my side and drive around a cool whip
Aye fuck that, he talking all that shit
But he won't run that
Fuck it, I'm trynna get away
Where the drugs at? Shawty she breaking my fucking heart
Like where the love at
Ion really got time for no bitch
Aye, but it's just you
Honestly baby I really lust you
I been around some things
That I'm still trynna adjust to
So I kinda understand if you think that ion trust you
Aye, but I swear that it's just you
Middle of the night, you on my mind
Girl come through, always on my mind
Girl I swear that I want you
Now I'm like
Now I'm like
Girl what's the issue? What you on
You the only one that I really want
You know, dropping all these thots
You got me lost in my thoughts
Oh shit, looking for my guap
Oh shit, ain't looking for the WAP
Oh shit, singing all my songs
Oh shit, don't do me wrong
Girl what's the issue? What you on
You the only one that I really want
You know, dropping all these thots
You got me lost in my thoughts
Oh shit, looking for my guap
Oh shit, ain't looking for the WAP
Oh shit, singing all my songs
Oh shit, don't do me wrong
