		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, Mr. Angel boy
Play with me like a toy
You think I'm sweet like candy
Won't say that once you've had me

Beautiful, a fragile doll
But you don't know me at all
And you wouldn't be so blind
If you knew what was happening in my mind

So be aggressive, be, be aggressive
For a second, an hour, meet me in the shower
And be aggressive, be, be aggressive
Sex is a weapon
I'm not your possession

Say I'm a slut, I'm a whore
I don't care, I want it more
There's no such thing as purity
So what you gonna do
Call me a slut, call me a whore
It's obvious, you're insecure
There's no such thing as purity
Anymore

Stop trying to wash me clean
'Cause I bring out your fantasies
Come make me scream and cry
That's something I might like

I'll do what I want to
And I'll do you just how I want to
And you'll do me just how I like it
And I'll say, oh my god, I love this

And I'll be aggressive, be, be aggressive
For a second, an hour, meet me in the shower
And be aggressive, be, be aggressive
Sex is a weapon, I'm not your possession

Say I'm a slut, I'm a whore
I don't care, I want it more
There's no such thing as purity
So what you gonna do
Call me a slut, call me a whore
It's obvious, you're insecure
There's no such thing as purity

So be aggressive, be, be aggressive
For a second, an hour, meet me in the shower
And be aggressive, be be aggressive
Sex is a weapon, I'm not your possession
