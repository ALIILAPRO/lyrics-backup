		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know what's wrong
I'm not okay I can't pretend when it's all gone
I'm sorry for everythin' that I've done
You know I've tried my best
Thinkin' you're the one oh

Days have been hard of sleepin' alone
When the sun's comin' down
Need someone to hold
I close my eyes wishin' you're by my side
You know I hate seein' you cry

What did I do this time
Didn't I really try
Gave all my love all turned to dust
I'm losin' my mind
I'd rather have all the fights
Than all of the sleepless nights
Everything's rushed I know I just lost
A piece of mine
Why can't we turn back time

We had a love
Like no one can have
We gave our promises
Now it's all in the past
Oh we didn't stand a chance didn't we babe
Our differences always get in our ways
It's sad really thought we would last

Days have been hard of being alone (being alone)
I don't know if I can handle the cold
So I close my eyes
Wishin' you're by my side
You know I hate seein' you cry

What did I do this time
Didn't I really try
Gave all my love all turned to dust
I'm losin' my mind
I'd rather have all the fights
Than all of the sleepless nights
Everything's rushed I know I just lost (oh)
A piece of mine
Why can't we turn back time

Turn back time oh
Turn back time oh oh

What did I do this time
Didn't I really try
Gave all my love all turned to dust
I'm losin' my mind
I'd rather have all the fights
Than all of the sleepless nights
Everything's rushed I know I just lost
A piece of mine
Why can't we turn back time
