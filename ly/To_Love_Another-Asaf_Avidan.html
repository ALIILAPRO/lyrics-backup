		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She tilted down her head and brushed her hair aside
And lifted up that holy gaze beneath her eyelids

Her beating lashes were the witnesses
That heard every single word she wouldn't say but I did

And when her lips came back to touch after a smile
She pressed them way to hard so they would reconcile

Her colour darkened to a red of every blood of every dead
That ever dare to love another

To love another

She pulled her head aside and when she brought it back
I swear a little broken girl was in her body

And as a prophecy when tripling down her cheek
She said: 'Don't you think to fall is just a study'

And when the star upon her lip was glued to mine
All of the stars in all the skies had to align
And then we both just disappear in every hope, in every fear
Of what it means to love another

To love another

Another day was passing in her eyes
I realize she never said 'I love you' in the morning

But as I watch the sunset in her gaze
There is a haze of night that doesn't want to be the warning

And when she parts her lips to wet them with her tongue
They bear the weight of every word of every song
And I am left there in that chair without a clue, without a care
Insisting I could love another

I could love another

Her eyes were searching in my soul
I asked her what it is she saw
She answered only with her silence

But then she took a pen and drew an entire ocean made of glue
And it is fallen words to island

And through her lips I felt the beating of her heart
I name the upperlip the end the lowerlip to start
I said I never let them touch, I want to open them so much
We'll never stop to love another

To love another

And through her lips I felt the beating of her heart
I name the upperlip the end the lowerlip to start
I said I never let them touch,I want to open them so much
We'll never stop to love another

We could love another
