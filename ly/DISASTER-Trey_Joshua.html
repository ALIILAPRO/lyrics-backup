		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I felt wanderlust
Ever since back in in dun-ta-duns
Ever since I was young I felt uncomfortable
Not one of us
Emotional
Don't match your horoscope
But your sun is rising
I lift eyelids back two birds ago
Had the club jump jumping
Vertical
Buss a hunnid round in intervals
I can't smoke too much cuz I get way too high feel vertigo
Under the table everywhere
How's that for a lower register
Say I must be clean can't rap nor sing bout shit that's delicate
What if I don't fear death
What if I don't feel pain
What if Know what's next
Well the drug still rot in my brain
I'm so fucking sick of myself
It's the View of myself I hate
I was just tryna get rid of my self
Mama told Me i wasn't no saint

See what I'm saying

It's a disaster
You knew I was disastrous
Remember what I lost before
That's shit that you could never know
It's a disaster
You knew I was disastrous
Remember what I lost before
That's shit that you could never know

Wyd feel different
Depends who its coming from
Low key high key
Make em young bucks trip
Cuz they bitch stay thunderstruck
Mos def Kweli
In the background playing while I write these number ones
Why YYZ
Cuz I'm flying that first class bitch back to where she from
Ima misfit
Bitch I'm a misfit
Stack up my money and hunny til day when they call me a king pin
I am no king bitch
I just rap and I sing shit
Feel like a cat in the bag I ain't rocking no hat but these rats on my hit list

It's a disaster
You knew I was disastrous
Remember what I lost before
That's some shit that you could never know

It's a disaster
You knew I was disastrous
Remember what I lost before
That's some shit that you could never know
