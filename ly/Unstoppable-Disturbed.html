		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're never gonna stop me
I'm the nightmare you've been dreaming of
Now the day is approaching
Gonna show you what I'm made of
This is just the beginning
Your anxiety is justified
Let me tell you something
There's nowhere left for you to hide

Justice will be mine
You can be certain

That sound of your heartbeat
Like a time bomb slowly ticking down
You won't see me coming
I can end your life without a sound

Hear me now
It's unavoidable
I fulfill my vow
There's no escape
I am unstoppable

(I am unstoppable)

There can be no penance
For the parasite that you've become
There is no repentance
This judgment can't be undone
There will be no mercy
No lenience while I'm alive
Vengeance is coming
Believe it now, you won't survive

Justice will be mine
You can be certain

That sound of your heartbeat
Like a time bomb slowly ticking down
You won't see me coming
I can end your life without a sound

Hear me now
It's unavoidable
I fulfill my vow
I am unstoppable
Don't bother running
It's over this time
You're going to pay now
For all you have taken
Hear me now
There's no escape
I am unstoppable

I am, I am, I am, I am
I am
I am unstoppable
I am, I am, I am, I am
I am
I am unstoppable
I am, I am, I am, I am
I am
I am unstoppable

Hear me now
It's unavoidable
I fulfill my vow
I am unstoppable
Don't bother running
It's over this time
You're going to pay now
For all you have taken
Hear me now
There's no escape
I am unstoppable

(You're never gonna stop me)
(I am unstoppable)
(You're never gonna stop me)
(I am unstoppable)
