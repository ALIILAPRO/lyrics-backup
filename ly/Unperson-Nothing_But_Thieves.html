		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We lose all control of our senses, so slowly
Give them up until we're defenseless, so surely

This is not what you think it is
This is not what you, this is not what you
This is not what you think it is
It's worse

Now my computer gets sad without me, it's scary
It's turnin' off everything I believe in
'Cause it knows it's easy

This is not what you think it is
This is not what you, this is not what you
This is not what you think it is
It's worse

'Cause I'm another unperson
You created this mess
You are the grand designer
Revel in our unrest

And we're getting sick of your doublethink
We see you all and now the walls are cavin' in
And maybe I'm flawed, but I do exist
My thoughts are mine, I didn't sign up for this

Now my spirit can barely function, it's ugly
No longer fit for public consumption
Well, I guess that's somethin'

This is not what you think it is
This is not what you, this is not what you
This is not what you think it is
It's worse

'Cause I'm another unperson
You created this mess

And we're getting sick of your doublethink
We see you all and now the walls are cavin' in
And maybe I'm flawed, but I do exist
My thoughts are mine, I didn't sign up for this

I'm just another clone of a clone
I'm out here searchin' for some meanin'
I'm all out of love, I forget what it feels like, yeah
And we all take orders comin' from above us
And they won't leave me alone
I'm just another clone of a clone of a clone
