		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why am I always on the fritz
I thought I'd come off the chopping block for a bit
And if I could find the way out you know I would
I feel like I'm always going south
And if you've got a drink could you let me now
The worst type of Instagram photography
Between you and me
So why don't we just calm down
So why don't we just calm down
The car has gone over the end
And if you've got a better plan
So why don't we just calm down
I heard the word on the street
And this point you might as well have bought an ad on T.V
And you can't help but run your mouth without ever looking around
I've seen the poison in your veins
And I wonder if you know that all your blood is the same
The devil rang my phone
He wants to know if you're coming home
Your crooked skeleton
You don't deserve a birthday
I belong in a museum
For the misplaced
So why don't we
So why don't we
So why don't we just calm down
So why don't we just calm down
The car has gone over the end
And if you've got a better plan
So why don't we just calm down
