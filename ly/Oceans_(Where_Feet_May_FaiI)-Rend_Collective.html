		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For I am Yours and You are mine 
Your grace abounds in deepest waters
Your sovereign hand will be my guide
Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me

You've never failed and You won't start now
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders 
Let me walk upon the waters wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander 
And my faith will be made stronger

In the presence of my Saviour
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders 
Let me walk upon the waters wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander 
And my faith will be made stronger

In the presence of my Saviour
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders 
Let me walk upon the waters wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander 
And my faith will be made stronger

In the presence of my Saviour
In the presence of my Saviour
In the presence of my Saviour
