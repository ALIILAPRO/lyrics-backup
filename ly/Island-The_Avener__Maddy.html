		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My buzz is dying
But I'm feeling fine
This party is drying up
I'm looking fine
Not even trying
Me on the dance floor

Eyes closed
Slipping on my ex, oh
Dancing to my own flow
My feet
Stumble over cool beats
I don't need nobody

I am an island
I don't need no shelter from the storm
I am an island
I don't need no one to keep me warm

I'm a rock at sea
Let the water hit me
Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll
Let it roll, let it roll
I'm enough for me
I'm steady on my feet
Let it come, let it come, let it come
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on

My buzz is dying
And this floor is mine
While everyone swipes their phone
You think I'm crying
You walk up to me
Asking, "Why do you dance alone?"

You sure read me like a closed book
Baby, I am driftwood, yeah, yeah
This was not an invitation
I need no salvation

I am an island
I don't need no shelter from the storm
I am an island
I don't need no one to keep me warm

I'm a rock at sea
Let the water hit me
Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll
Let it roll, let it roll
I'm enough for me
I'm steady on my feet
Let it come, let it come, let it come
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on

I am an island
I am an island
I am an island
