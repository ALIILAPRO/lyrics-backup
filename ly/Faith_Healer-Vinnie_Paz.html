		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, look
C'mon, man, stop fuckin' playin' with me
Man we rippin' and runnin'
Look, yeah

No cappin', and leave the plug alone
(Don't talk to my man)
Six days he established himself
Above the throne (Alhamdulillah)
We take pesticide and we drug the clone
This a HK P30, it's from Cologne
(We over there)
It's bounties on the warship (yeah)
You should have faith in the One
That's the God lordship (Alhamdulillah)
The vortex is like a horse wish
Free the gods and blood all
Over the sword tip
I saw the biochemical grift that was honor
That was part of my dimensional shift
We was outside
We was smokin' Netherland piff
You was outlying
We was from the Nephilim grift
Look, they worshippin' the dakka
It's blood around the body if
We circlin' the Ka'bah (Alhamdulillah)
We smoke Marley and hold sickles
(Hold sickles)
Talk like Charlie and roll nickels

If you don't know where I'm at
Don't tempt me
Let off this drum 'til it's empty
Plug gon' spill the trill, come get me
Still, you all gon' feel who sent me
If you don't know where I'm at
Don't tempt me
Let off this drum 'til it's empty
Plug gon' spill the trill come get me
Still, it's all fun and
Game 'til it's empty

Crescent and star on the gold rubies
The ahkis all draped in shemagh
And they hold toolies
(It's toolies at the masjid)
Runnin' and rippin' and smoke woolies
Muhfuckas out here will stick
You wit' ol' Uzis (Ha ha haha)
You was a bitch in the womb (You was)
This a overkill
That's the elephant in the room
(Ha ha ha ha ha)
You doin' the dash, you live in the lake
He a steppa, he a bad man, Vivian Blake
(Shower bodies)
This muhfucka still mention my name
(Always talkin')
So I call over my young boi
Send for the flame
How you still alive? I'da thought
You ended the pain you a burden on society
It's simple and plain (It's that simple)
Look, I'm heavy with the hardware
(Got the biscuit's)
Too close to the magazine will
Burn your arm hair (Brrr)
Small grave and a cold coffin
Pull up with a new 45 at the old Jordan
Yeah!

If you don't know where I'm at
Don't tempt me
Let off this drum 'til it's empty
Plug gon' spill the trill come get me
Still, you all gon' feel who sent me
If you don't know where I'm at
Don't tempt me
Let off this drum 'til it's empty
Plug gon' spill the trill come get me
Still, it's all fun and
Game 'til it's empty
It's all fun and game 'til it's empty
