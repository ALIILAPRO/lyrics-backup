		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Weighted down
Beyond the rule exist
The traded myth

Fade out of time
The furthest thing from what I thought I wanted
All you left behind

Waited long enough to be this way
Never a repaid debt
Never a dream of love
The value fits
No, I never take offense to anything
In the final cast

In different dialects
Time mentions off the fortune root
Faded asleep
The different points beneath the antibodies right to waste away

Waited long enough to be this way
Never mention my name
Traded adrenal sleep
The values fit
No, I never take offense in anything
In the final cast
In the final cast

How awful
Here revolves the last thing that she said
How awful
Here revolves the last thing
I don't know if I could ever find a better way to say you lost it

Never a repaid debt
Never a dream of love
The value fits
No, I never take offense to anything
I don't hear
No, not while I was shaving shade
