		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heart strung, young and dumb
Yeah, we had no fear
Way back when we said
We'd both be millionaires
Now those days are over
And we are all ghosts

We used to sleep all day and talk all night
Stay up by the TV light (oh, oh)
When your baby teeth ain't milky white
Wipe the stardust from your eyes (oh, oh)
I said "oh come on love, we'll be just fine
We're gonna live just like it's 1999"

In 1990
In 1999
In 1990
In 1999

Back then we were trading
Cards behind the swings
Oh no, now it's money, gold, and diamond rings
Now those days are over
And we are all ghosts

We used to sleep all day and talk all night
Stay up by the TV light (oh, oh)
When your baby teeth ain't milky white
Wipe the stardust from your eyes (oh, oh)
I said "oh come on love, we'll be just fine
We're gonna live just like it's 1999"

In 1990
In 1999
In 1990
In 1999

Oh, oh no, where does it go?
Well whatever fill your body up with chemicals
Oh, oh no, kaleidoscopes
Well whatever living better in

In 1990
In 1999
In 1990
In 1999

Nintendo, Atari
Sega's my Ferrari
I got it, I love it, I, I
In 1990
Got song electronics
Voodoo economics
I got it, I love it, I, I
In 1999
