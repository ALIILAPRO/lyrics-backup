		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come on honey, take a trip with me
We'll take a double shot of ectasy
I'll drink some water from a wooden cup
Keep a rocking till the sun comes up

[Chorus]
And I warn you
It's the best shot of your life
And I warn you
It's the best shot of your life
Shot of love
Shot of love

Rock you little lady make you blow and bleed
A little bit of what you need is guaranteed
Come on now honey we'll get full of desire
A humping and a bumping till we start a fire

[Chorus]

(Shot of love I'm gonna make you plead)

[Chorus]

Like to plead?
Shot of love
A humping and pumping got you jumping
Shot of love
A little bit of what you need is guaranteed
Shot of love
Let me warn you, I'm coming for you
Shot of love
Come on give me shot of love
