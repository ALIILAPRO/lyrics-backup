		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gone are the days
I find myself asking if it's right

Gone are the ways
Of letting these doubts ruin my mind

The oldest story ever told
Of how we're bought and how we're sold
Keep your money, leaves me cold
I won't worry, won't sell my soul

Black is the new gold
Black is the new gold
Black is the new gold

Gone are the nights
When I would sit and wonder why

Here comes the light
I'm not going to lose myself this time

Please believe me, I would know
We're given freedom to play the role
The more you take, the less you hold
The less you steal, the more you owe

Black is the new gold
Black is the new gold
Black is the new gold
Hey, black is the new gold
Black is the new gold
Ooh, black is the new gold
