		<p>
		  Bet, ha
Oh, so, so you, oh, so you think you tough, though?
You think you a tough guy?
Huh (Taurus)
Huh, huh
Pussy (Run that back, Turbo)

Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies)
Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies)
We geekin' up on the Addy
Spin the block, we got the addy
Wake up, I pop me a Addy
Hard to stop poppin' these Addies
Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies)
Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies)
Roll up Biscotti, I'm drinkin' the codeine whenever I swallow a Addy
Drugs in my body, I call up a venue, he tell us pull up to the addy

Hm, hm, hm, hm
Hm, hm, hm, hm
We shady babies, we don't do the nay nay, we trapped on the block for a payday
I put the stick right to his face, now he turnin' away, actin' like he ain't say that
I jumped off the porch and I really went north, the first out my hood with a Maybach
They wanna come pop that shit while I'm on tour, uh, just wait 'til I get back
She know that she cappin', she gave me your addy, lil' boy, I know where you stay at
You sendin' big shots, shoulda stuck to the rappin', lil' boy, I swear I don't play that
They know I'm with it, connected, through the city
Skydweller, out the fridge, Elliante got it hittin' (uh)
That Addy is in me, I feel it (uh)
I'm your daddy, lil' bitch, come and get it (uh)
You niggas still cap like a fitted
I'm throwin' 'em back like they Ritalin

Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies)
Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies)
We geekin' up on the Addy
Spin the block, we got the addy
Wake up, I pop me a Addy
Hard to stop poppin' these Addies
Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies)
Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies)
Roll up Biscotti, I'm drinkin' the codeine whenever I swallow a Addy
Drugs in my body, I call up a venue, he tell us pull up to the addy

I'm geekin' on codeine, ayy, I took four beans, ayy
Adderall pink (ayy, ayy), no sleep, I'm geeked
I'm high, no lie (no lie), you can get hit with the fire (hit with the fire)
Shady baby, I come from the south (come from the south)
I'm at your neck like a tie (said whoa, yeah)
I whip the coupe out the lot
Broke my wrist in the pot, man, we shippin' 'em out (yeah)
I'm puttin' that bitch on the spot
She can fuck on the gang or that bitch can get out (bitch can get out, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a pimp, not a trick (not a trick)
Coupe is all white like a brick (like a brick)
I ride around with the stick (with the stick)
They want it, we pull up and blitz (yeah)
Patek, wetty (wetty), neck, baguettie (baguettie, yeah)
I'm wrappin' bricks like a daddy
You niggas pathetic, just shut up and bet it (yeah)
Niggas ain't havin' no fetty
They act like they ready, get hit with a bullet (hit with a bullet)
Nigga backed up when I pull it
He can get hit with the fullest (yeah)

Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies)
Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies)
We geekin' up on the Addy
Spin the block, we got the addy
Wake up, I pop me a Addy
Hard to stop poppin' these Addies
Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies)
Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies), Addy (Addies)
Roll up Biscotti, I'm drinkin' the codeine whenever I swallow a Addy
Drugs in my body, I call up a venue, he tell us pull up to the addy

(Addy, Addy, Addy, Addy)
(Addy, Addy, Addy, Addy)
