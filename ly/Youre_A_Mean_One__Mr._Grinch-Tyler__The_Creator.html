		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're a mean one
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel
Mr. Grinch, you're a bad banana
(Mr. Grinch), with the greasy black peel
You're a vile one
You got termites in your smile
You have all the tender sweetness
Of a seasick crocodile (Mr. Grinch)
You're a foul one
Friends, you don't have none
I wouldn't touch you with a thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole!
You're a monster
Your heart's an empty hole
You're a goner
You got garlic in your soul
You got garlic in your soul

All them smiles, homie
I turn to frowns
All them decorations
I tear 'em down
You can ask Max, I don't play around
Ayo (eww)
Who is this mean fellow
With his skin all green and his teeth all yellow? (eww)
What you so mad for?
Halloween come around and we ain't knockin' at your door, mane

Mr. Grinch you're a bad banana
You're gonna spoil everybody with your bad attitude
(Spoil everybody)
Mr. Grinch
La-la-la-la
Who is this mean fellow
With his skin all green and his teeth all yellow?
(La-la-la-la)
What you so mad for?
Halloween come around and we ain't knockin' at your door
Bad banana
