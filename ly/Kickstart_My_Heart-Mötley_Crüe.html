		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I get high I get high on speed
Top fuel funny car's a drug for me
My heart, my heart
Kick start my heart
Always got the cops coming after me
Custom-built bike doing 103
My heart, my heart
Kick start my heart

Oh, are you ready girls?
Oh, are you ready now?
Whoa, yeah
Kick start my heart, give it a start
Whoa, yeah, baby 
Whoa, yeah
Kick start my heart, hope it never stops
Whoa, yeah, baby, yeah

Skydive naked from an aeroplane
Or a lady with a body from outer space
My heart, my heart
Kick start my heart
Say I got trouble, trouble in my eyes
I'm just looking for another good time
My heart, my heart
Kick start my heart

Yeah, are you ready girls?
Yeah, are you ready now, now, now?
Whoa, yeah
Kick start my heart, give it a start
Whoa, yeah, baby, whoa, yeah
Kick start my heart, hope it never stops
Whoa, yeah, baby

When we started this band
All we needed, needed was a laugh
Years gone by, I'd say we've kicked some ass
When I'm enraged or hittin' the stage
Adrenaline rushing through my veins
And I'd say we're still kickin' ass

I say, ooh ah, kick start my heart
I hope it never stops
And to think, we did all of this to rock

Whoa, yeah
Kick start my heart, give it a start
Whoa, yeah, b-b-b-b-b-b-baby
Whoa, yeah
Kick start my heart, hope it never stops
Whoa, yeah, baby

Whoa, yeah
Kick start my heart, hope it never stops
Whoa, yeah, baby
Whoa, yeah
Kick start my heart, give it a start
Whoa, yeah
Okay boys, let's rock the house

That's all

Kickstart my heart
