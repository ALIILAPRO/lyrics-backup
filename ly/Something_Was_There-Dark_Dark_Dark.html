		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Think on it now
Do you recall a thing?
Under a spell
I gave chase til I fell
And you were out of it
Oh you were passing out

But something was there
Something that led me to right here
Hope upon hope 
Won’t lead it back again

You have got yours
And I’ve got mine
Which parts to share
Get lost 

Well you can keep yours
And I’m keeping mine for myself

And something was there
Something that led me to right here
Hope upon hope
Won’t lead it back again

Think on it now 
I see it all
You with your eyes firmly closed 
At it alone
I call a guide 
For all the enchanted parts of this life 

And if you think of me at all
Just let it wash over you

And something was there
Something that led me to right here 
Hope upon hope 
Won’t lead it back again
