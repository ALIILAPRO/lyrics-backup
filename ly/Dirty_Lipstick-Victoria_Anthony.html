		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thinkin’ ‘bout where we started
In that messy makeup department
I was young, and too open-hearted, oh
Trusted you with my secrets
Made me feel like you were gonna keep ‘em
And I never shoulda believed it, no

I wasted all my time (my time)
Listening to all your lies (your lies)
Waitin’ for you to apologize
I’m sorry but

You’re not sorry for what you did
I don’t need to forgive to get over it
I’m done with all your pretentious shit
Your stupid gem and your dirty lipstick
Don’t come back when you’re on your own
thrown out, clothes spread out across the road
I’m done, yeah honey, I’m over it
I hope you choke on your dirty lipstick

February to August
Couldn’t figure out what you wanted
So you left the same way you started, alone

You wasted all my time (my time)
Listened to all your lies (your lies)
Waited for you to apologize
I’m sorry but

You’re not sorry for what you did
I don’t need to forgive to get over it
I’m done with all your pretentious shit
Your stupid gem and your dirty lipstick
Don’t come back when you’re on your own
Thrown out, clothes spread out across the road
I’m done, yeah honey, I’m over it
I hope you choke on your dirty lipstick

I wasted all my time (all my time)
Listening to all your lies (all your lies)

You’re not sorry for what you did
I don’t need to forgive to get over it
I’m done with all your pretentious shit
Your stupid gem and your dirty lipstick
Don’t come back when you’re on your own
Thrown out, clothes spread out across the road
I’m done, yeah honey, I’m over it(I’m over it, I’m over it)
I hope you choke on your dirty lipstick
You’re not sorry for what you did (I don’t need, I don’t need)
I don’t need to forgive to get over it
I’m done with all your pretentious shit
Your stupid gem and your dirty lipstick
But don’t come back when you’re on your own
Thrown out, clothes spread out across the road
I’m done, I’m over it
I hope you choke on your dirty lipstick
