		  Hello?
How far you is?
I told you I was twenty minutes, five minutes ago
Man, I don't wanna hear all that shit, man
Do the dash 'bout me
Haha, ugh, boy bye

This new lil' situation got me gone, woah, woah
We've been at it for a minute, I know it's wrong though (uh)
I couldn't just leave her alone (I couldn't), I had to double-back (go back) 
I just might lock it down for life, put her on super max (woo)
She got that super wet, wet, wet (splash)
She got that boomerang, that shit make you come back (ugh)
Askin', "Did I take somethin'?" Been in it a hour flat (long)
Lost her mind when I had first put it in from the back
Thought she had an asthma attack

Told me, "When we fuck, keep this shit between us" (cool)
Ooh, that pussy good, when she nut, it's cream puff (ooh)
Pressure, you know I apply that (that's off the muscle)
That lil' junt jiggle when she walk, I had to try that (give me a sample)
I wanna feel it, I might go raw, I can't deny that (tellin' the truth)
You swear I'm lyin' when I had told you I couldn't wait to get you (real)
You ate that dick so good, I miss you, come here, let me kiss you (come here)
You caught me vulnerable, lil' baby, I couldn't help but lick you
Action News Five, got a top floor at the Waldorf (live) 
Gettin' to it 'fore the lights turn off (ooh)
Percy, titties, she don't need no bra (boobs)
I ain't talkin' 'bout a double-cross, nah
She like when I'm backstabbin' (ugh-ugh)
Love when she look back at it
And ask me, "Where you gon' nut, daddy?" (She too savage)

This new lil' situation got me gone, woah, woah
We've been at it for a minute, I know it's wrong though (uh)
I couldn't just leave her alone (I couldn't), I had to double-back (go back) 
I just might lock it down for life, put her on super max (woo)
She got that super wet, wet, wet (splash)
She got that boomerang, that shit make you come back (ugh)
Askin', "Did I take somethin'?" Been in it a hour flat (long)
Lost her mind when I had first put it in from the back
Thought she had an asthma attack

You fuckin' with me and I'm fuckin' with you
And this shit gettin' deep, I don't know what to do
Should I keep this shit player or keep this shit cool? (Choose)
More life to live, nigga, go with your mood (go)
No cap, I ain't ever have a bitch look in my eyes
And eat it up better than you (uh)
Not to mention you get wet as a pool (wet)
Put me to sleep and then cook me some food
Her face expressions say she thinkin' too hard
And I could just tell by the vibe (what's wrong?)
She wanna fuck with me, I'm knowin' she's scared
She say she don't want no surprise or replies (or lies)
Me either, ain't nobody business
Soon as she see me, them knees get to bendin'
Deep stroke, she feel when I'm in it
I don't feel no, can't even finish her sentence (uh)
Treat it like a pacifier, put me in your mouth
Like you teethin' (baby girl)
I'm diggin' in and she usin' a rose
Gon' fuck around and stop breathin' (tapped)
What you want, where you at? Let's go
What you doin' tonight, what's up? (Waitin' on you)
Wherever we at, we'll be droppin' the lo'
We be telling each other, "Pull up" (this shit done got serious, ayy)

This new lil' situation got me gone, woah, woah
We've been at it for a minute, I know it's wrong though (uh)
I couldn't just leave her alone (I couldn't), I had to double-back (go back) 
I just might lock it down for life, put her on super max (woo)
She got that super wet, wet, wet (splash)
She got that boomerang, that shit make you come back (ugh)
Askin', "Did I take somethin'?" Been in it a hour flat (long)
Lost her mind when I had first put it in from the back
Thought she had an asthma attack
