		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Creature do the ones you hurt come into the dreams your schemes of ripping these lives apart who screwed you 

For me its the love of chase 

For me it's can't create 

If it's simply covered say to one another 

WHat's in your mind in your mind in your mind that tells you 

Sadness speaks so softly so gently 

We move through as if eloquently show remorse 

Installment of what is left 

Installment of what is true 

If it's simply covered say to one another 

What's in your mind in your mind in your mind that tells you 

In your mind you know it makes you do what you do 

In your head in your filthy in your head of this mind 

In my mind in my head that makes me do what I do 

In your mind in your head that makes you do this too 

Creature do the ones you hurt come into the dreams your schemes of ripping these lives apart who screwed you 

For me it's love of chase 

For me its can't create 

If it's simply covered say to one another 

What's in your mind in your mind in you mind that tells you (she go) 

What's in your fuckin' head?
