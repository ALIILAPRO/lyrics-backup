		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Talked to you today for the first time in a long time
Get advice that I don't want but I need
Curling up inside foster lies behind my eyes
Feed you a line I can't fake
Oh I'm anxious
I get nervous
I feel tired
And is it worth it
To wake up to
Things that scare you
Hanging on by a thread I can’t break
I need a minute to mend myself you can see it on my lips
That I need fixed
I need a second to sell it
It’s coming from my fingertips that I need fixed
I need
I need
I get so distracted living out my passions I forget I’m alive
But you’re so patient with all my changes
Always on my mind
I feel nauseous
I'm so cautious
With my dark side
And you know it
You’re on my side
Till my tears dry
Pick me up from the ground
Where I lay
I need a minute to mend myself you can see it on my lips
That I need fixed
I need a second to sell it it’s coming from my fingertips
I need fixed
I need
I won’t let it hold me down, hold me down, hold me down
I won’t let it hold me down, hold me down, hold me down
I won’t let it hold me down, hold me down, hold me down
I won’t let it hold me down, hold me down, hold me down
