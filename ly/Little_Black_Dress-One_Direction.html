		  Little black dress
Just walked into the room
Makin' heads turn
Can't stop looking at you
It's so right
It's so right
It's so right you know

Little black dress
Did you come here alone?
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late to go home

It's so right
It's so right
It's so right you know
It's so right
It's so right
It's so right you know

I wanna see the way you move for me baby
I wanna see the way you move for me baby
I wanna see the way you move for me

Little black dress
Who you doin' it for?
Little black dress
I can't take anymore
It's not right
It's not right
It's not right you know

Little black dress
What's your favorite song?
Little black dress
I won't do you no harm

It's so right
It's so right
It's so right you know
It's so right
It's so right
'Cause I'll take you home

I wanna see the way you move for me baby
I wanna see the way you move for me baby
I wanna see the way you move for me

I wanna see the way you move for me baby
I wanna see the way you move for me baby
I wanna see the way you move for me

I wanna see the way you move for me baby
I wanna see the way you move for me baby
I wanna see the way you move for me
