		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take a walk with the full moon
We're all buttoned and zipped up (mad)
It's all kicking off soon
Better stay well equipped, bruv (uh)
I don't know about your goons
'Round 'ere everything liff up (liff up)
Whether it's draw, win, or lose
None of my friend dem give up

Let's do it
Ain't come here to talk it out, let's get into it (action)
Froze up, now he froze to death
You shoulda blew it (blew it, blew it)
Told you you can't f- with us
You shoulda knew it, yeah (you shoulda knew it)

We gon' do the most (yeah)
Foot all on they throat (yeah)
Oh, you wanted to ghost the bitch?
Made it out alive (I'm blessed)
Leave one of the guys, never (yeah)
We were told to die together
Get put down wherever
We gon' ride forever (ride forever)

La-di-da-di
We came to start it
Bring the paper for the pressure
Wrap 'em up like origami, yo
La-di-da-di
We came to start it (ay)
It's pepper if they ever want a problem in this party, yo

(La-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da-di)
Yo
(La-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da-di)
(Let's do it)
(La-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da-di)
Yo
(La-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da-di)

Headshot in the middle of the battlefield (boom)
Don't mind going out like that (brrt)
But guess what? Mans out here gunning
Black bandana gang, no white flags
But I'm devilish, I walk with a trident
Criminals move in silence (shh)
Champion team full of migrants
Make your brain fly like pilots (pilots)

They do what he say, I run mine (run mine)
In the field every time on the front line
Yeah, I ain't goin' out sad, not one time
Boy better not cross that gun line
Head up, it's on, no high-five (five)
Straight to it, no talkin', that's my kind
You handle that there, let him drive
When it come to this stuff, I'm top five

La-di-da-di
We came to start it
Bring the paper for the pressure
Wrap 'em up like origami, yo (wrap 'em up)
La-di-da-di
We came to start it (ay)
It's pepper if they ever want a problem in this party (woo)

(La-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da-di)
Yo
(La-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da-di)
(Let's do it)
(La-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da-di)
Yo
(La-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da-di)
(Let's do it)

Redrum, redrum, redrum, edrum
Battle of the baddest
Riyadh season
Redrum, redrum, redrum, edrum
Battle of the baddest
Only one of us are leaving
