		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whoa-oh
You got to pay your way in pain
You got to pray your way in shame

Ooh, I went to the store, I was feeling kinda hungry
But, didn't have the money and the shelves were all empty
So I went to the bank to ch-ch-check my checking
The man looked at my face, said, "We don't have a record"

Oh no, you thought we had forgotten
The show is only getting started
The road is feeling like a pothole
Sit down, stand up, head down, hands up and

Pay your way in pain
You got to pray your way in shame

Give me what I want
(What do you want, what do you want?)
You know what I want
(What do you want, what do you want?)
You know what I want
(What do you want, what do you want?) You relax baby
I, I, I wanna be loud

(Pay)
(Pain)
(Pray, shame)

So I went to the park just to watch the little children
The mothers saw my heels and they said I wasn't welcome
So I, I went back home, I was feeling kinda queasy
But all the locks were changed, my baby wouldn't see me

Oh no, you put your finger on it
The stove is only gettin' hotter
The sun is gotta, gotta melt you
Stand up, sit down, hands up, break down

(What do you want, what do you want?)
You know what I want
(What do you want, what do you want?)
I wanna be loud (what do you want, what do you want? Shame)
(What do you want, what do you want?)
I wanna be loud (what do you want, what do you want? Shame)
