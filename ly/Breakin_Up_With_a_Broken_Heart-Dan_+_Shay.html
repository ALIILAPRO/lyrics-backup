		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh yeah
Oh
Ooh yeah 

It's been a couple months now since she up and walked out
Left me in a cloud of dust
Played a million sad songs, wondered where I went wrong
I've had enough

I'm sick of feeling down, down, down
Hanging in a heartbreak town
I'm thinking what I need right now
Is a one-way ticket out

I'm breaking up with a broken heart
Taking a vacation to a brand new start
Sending my tears in a taxi
'Til they turn happy
Leaving all my lonely in the dark
Oh, I'm breaking up with a broken heart
Oh, yeah

I'ma find a good time, see a little sunshine
Put a smile on my face
Maybe hit the west coast, anywhere the wind blows
Somewhere she ain't

I'll pull up in a long gone chair
Double shot of just don't care
Where the only thing blue is the sky
And love ain't on my mind 'cause

I'm breaking up with a broken heart
Taking a vacation to a brand new start
Sending my tears in a taxi
'Til they turn happy
Leaving all my lonely in the dark
Oh, I'm breaking up with a broken heart
Oh, yeah

Adios, sayonara
I'll be waking up good tomorrow
Oh, and every day after that
'Cause I ain't looking back, no

I'm breaking up with a broken heart
Taking a vacation to a brand new start
Sending my tears in a taxi
'Til they turn happy
Leaving all my lonely in the dark
Oh, I'm breaking up with a broken heart
Oh, yeah
