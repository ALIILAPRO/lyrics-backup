		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well even the longest night won't last forever
But too many hopes and dreams won't see the light
And all of the plans I make won't come together
Something in the air
Maybe for the only time in my life
Something in the air
Turning me around and guiding me right
And it's a prime time, maybe the stars were right
I had a premonition, it's gonna be my turn tonight
Gonna be my turn tonight
Well even the brightest star won't shine forever
But all of the hands I play are working out right
And every move I make feels like a winner
Something in the air
Maybe for the only time in my life
Something in the air
Turning me around and guiding me right
And it's a prime time, maybe the stars were right
I had a premonition, it's gonna be my turn tonight
Gonna be my turn tonight
Gonna be my turn tonight
