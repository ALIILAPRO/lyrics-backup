		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, how you doing?
I haven't seen you around
Your mouth is moving
Superficial sound
Let's get together
Act like we care for a while
It's been forever
I don't really mind

I, blank staring faces
I make it to fake it

When I'm hanging with my imaginary friends
All we ever do is smile and play pretend
Nothing to give, nothing to gain
Only exist inside of my head
Imaginary, imaginary friends

We go out talking
You're still obsessed with yourself
Wish I was walking
Back into my shell
Cause every time I think that it's different
You come around just working the same shit
Like you're someone else

I, blank staring faces
I make it to fake it

When I'm hanging with my imaginary friends
All we ever do is smile and play pretend
Nothing to give, nothing to gain
Only exist inside of my head
Imaginary, imaginary friends
