		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm bathing in exhaustion
A never-ending train wreck
I swear my legs, they function
But I'm assembled to crawl
I'm heading east of Benson to glorify a casket
Whether it's Swift Falls or St. Paul
I can't spend another weekend at a funeral (funeral)

I'll try again
I need psychologic' paralyzing medicine
To forget who I am
Try again
Forever freeze in silence
I need to forget who I am
So I'll try again (try again)

I need something symbolic to rupture
I wanna seek some unforeseen color
Please get me outside with sunlight
Reflecting off a waterfall
I can't spend another weekend at a funeral

I'll try again
I need psychologic' paralyzing medicine
To forget who I am
Try again
Forever freeze in silence
I need to forget who I am
So I'll try again
I'll try again
Need some medicine
Need some medicine

Will you twist my vision into a perfect blur?
Will you pull me underwater?
Drag me down headfirst?

I'll try again
I need psychologic'
(I need this) paralyzing medicine
To forget who I am
Try again (again)
Forever freeze in silence
I need to forget who I am
So I'll try again
