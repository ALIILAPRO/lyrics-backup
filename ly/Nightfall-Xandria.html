		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here it comes, the story of mankind's final glory
Into the nightfall
The showdown now has come, this will be the last curtain
Before the Night falls

In a desert burning children's faces turning
Into another enemy in war
Icy winds are blowing over bodies piling high
There's no place left for more

Oh save me from sharing this hell
Oh save me from my blame

Here it comes, the story of mankind's final glory
Into the nightfall
The showdown now has come, this will be the last curtain
Before the Night falls

We are worshiping the gods
That keep twisting our thoughts
Everyday a new sensation
While a million creatures
See their soil turning to dust
Hrimata Eleison

Oh save me from sharing this hell
Oh save me from my blame

Here it comes, the story of mankind's final glory
Into the nightfall
The showdown now has come, this will be the last curtain
Before the Night falls

Forever and ever
You hear them crying
Forever and ever
This world is dying
We had too much time to understand

Here it comes, the story of mankind's final glory
Into the nightfall
The showdown now has come, this will be the last curtain
Before the Night falls

We are rising higher, closer to the fire
Let the final dance begin
