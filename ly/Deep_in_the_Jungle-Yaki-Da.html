		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Deep in the jungle, drums are played by hand;
They're sending a message few would understand;
But I do,
'Cause like in the jungle of emotions,
People are getting lost;
What is right over time?
What should you tell me?
Deep in the jungle of emotions,
Some things are best unsaid;
Hide your past and I stay.

I want to be your number one-
Not one in a stupid line;
You want to tell me who you are,
But, baby, don't push it too far;
I wanna be your number one.

I do.

Once in my lifetime,
I'll be standing bride;
Once in my lifetime,
I will say 'I do' to a priest;
I wanna wrap my arms around you,
But all the things you've said,
Bring me down even though I'm glad you told me
Something about your past and future;
But enough is enough;
Now I know what to say.

Don't you think we have to work this out?
Do you have to make me scream and shout?

I want to be your number one-
Not one in a stupid line;
You want to tell me who you are,
But, baby, don't push it too far;
I wanna be your number one.

Feeling like a stranger-
Want you near;
Can we make some change here,
No more fear?
I'm feeling like a stranger;
Hah-ah-ah-ah-ah

I want to be your number one-
Not one in a stupid line;
You want to tell me who you are,
But, baby, don't push it too far;
