		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feel it in my gut, no love
When I cut and the blood done run
Ain't no running from the pain
No gain, every gain maintain
But the game, no shame it’ll be okay one day
I know you hate me, I love you to death
I'm saving my breath
I told myself that I wouldn't obsess
I guess I’ll confess
All I gave is a fuck and but now
Don't wanna fuck up again
I want to pretend that I can't
Demand my brain stay sane
And the fucker was in the game
My world crumbling, I'ma stick around
We get seen together
We got nowhere to go, puttin' shit up my nose
And Lord knows ain't no one around
Me to give me hope
But God is a no-show, God is a no-show
God is a no-show
Now I'm aimless, ready to die
No one blame me, here on the ground

I am wading in the water
You can't save me, let me drown
God is a no-show god is a no-show (Ah)
God is a no-show (God is a no-show) god (Ah)
God is a no-show (No one blame me)
God is a no-show (No one, no)
God is a no-show (No one blame me)
God is a no-show (No one, no)
