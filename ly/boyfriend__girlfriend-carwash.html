		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Boyfriend, girlfriend, whatever you wanna call it
There was a boy and a girl, and their two worlds collided
Couple kids in the summer heat at seventeen
Ended up falling in love accidentally

Took me all night
Caught me by surprise
Baby blue-eyed
Napoleon Dynamite

Kiss me goodnight
So I won't forget
The very first time
That your lips met mine

Your sisters didn't like me
But they were the first ones to say we should date
I remember it like it was yesterday
Pretty and prettier you get in every way, everyday

Took me all night
Caught me by surprise
Baby blue-eyed
Napoleon Dynamite

Kiss me goodnight
So I won't forget
The very first time
That your lips met mine

You're everything to me
You're everything to me
