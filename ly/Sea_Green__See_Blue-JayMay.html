		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "Won't you miss me?" you said inside grand central station
And your eyes grew red and wild before the chasin'
I felt your body move through my coat
I felt you footstep silent but
Heavy, you followed me onto the shuttle
Tapped my shoulder one last time and that was all, that was all
Hmmmm

I miss winter just because I miss when I knew you best
I miss the typewriter in the basement, I miss making your room a mess
I miss not being misused
I miss it all, so I guess I lose
Sea green, see blue
Hmmmm

September 2nd to April 13th, but who's counting?
Song after song after song after song amounting into mountains
He told me you beat her up
Behold the "Super Keith" on the cup
What's up, enough's enough, and where's my morning coffee?
I regret every single thing I ever said, I said those things too softly
Hmmmm

There was you, there was me in the room with the alcoholic guest
You asked if we should sleep on these cardboard sheets I said "Yes, okay, let's"
And the sculptor we hardly knew
His limbs were lying askew
Sea green, see blue
Hmmmm

You tossed your phone fifty feet in the air, I can't believe you caught it
You said whatever you wanted to as long as you thought it should be true
And you dream, you make movies, you dance
You moved to Montreal, to be closer to France
How's that working out, how's the music, how's the food?
I know you won't stay there forever, I know you're gonna move again and again and again
Hmmmm

This is crazy, but I know I left you to be with your art
You always put me first, and somehow that broke my heart
'Cause it's not my place to choose
My first love, and my only muse
Sea green, see blue
Hmmmm
