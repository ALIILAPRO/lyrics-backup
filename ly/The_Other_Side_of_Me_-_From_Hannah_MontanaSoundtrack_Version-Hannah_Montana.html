		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The other side, the other side, the other side of me

By day I play the part in every way
Of simple, sweet, calm, and collected
Pretend, to my friends, I'm a chameleon
could make a girl feel disconnected

Feel like a star, a superhero
Sometimes its hard to separate
(Got too much on my plate)

If you could see
the other side of me
I'm just like anybody else can't you tell!
I hold the key, to both realities
The girl that I want you to know if only I could show
The other side, the other side, I want you to see,
The other side, the other side, the other side of me

Inside, I try, to make the pieces fit right
A jigsaw puzzle everywhere,
'Cause I flip the script so many times I forget
Who's on stage, who's in the mirror

Back in the spotlight the crowd is calling
The paparazzi and the fame

(Could drive a girl insane!)

If you could see, the other side of me
I'm just like anybody else, can't you tell
I hold the key, to both realities
The girl that I want you to know if only I could show
The other side, the other side, I want you to see
The other side, the other side, the other side of me

Down inside I'm not that different
Like everyone I have a dream
Don't wanna hide, just wanna fit in
Sometimes it's harder then it seems

If you could see, the other side of me
I'm just like anybody else, can't you tell
I hold the key to both realities
The girl that I want you to know
If you could see (C'mon) the other side of me
I'm just like everybody else can't you tell!
I hold the key, to both realities
The girl that I want you to know if only I could show

The other side, the other side, I want you to see
The other side, the other side, the other side of me
The other side, the other side, I want you to see
The other side, the other side of me
