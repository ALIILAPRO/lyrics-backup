		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where do I go? Got lost, alone
With the ashes drying me out
Don't look behind
Keep it sharp til the end of time
Burn it down to the ground
Let the flame fill up the sky
Aim and shot
We gotta make them pay their price

Rages inside
I know, oh, I know
It's born of the age of dark
I won't deny
To the hell I'll hunt you down

With the rattle of gunfire
Here we are at this madness
Oh, I don't give a damn
I'll hunt you down tonight (ooh)
Yeah, I'll hunt you down tonight
Oh, tonight (ooh)

How do I know? Where you are, mm-mm
No where you could hide
All your desire
Will devour yourself the end
Burn it down to the ground
Let the flame fill up the sky
Aim and shot
Yeah, you gotta hit them back

Rages inside
I know, oh, I know
It's born of the age of dark
I won't deny
To the hell I'll hunt you down

With the rattle of gunfire
Here we are at this madness
Oh, I don't give a damn
I'll hunt you down tonight (ooh)
Yeah, I'll hunt you down tonight, oh

Riding down the road, wild
I pave my own way to journey's end
No one left for you there
Tell me what you have to fear
Burn it up to ashes
Oh, I won't let you go
Yeah, burn like the ashes
Won't let you go

Rages inside
I know, oh, I know
It's born of the age of dark
I won't deny
To the hell I'll hunt you down

With the rattle of gunfire
Here we are at this madness
Oh, I don't give a damn
I'll hunt you down tonight (ooh)
Yeah, I'll hunt you down tonight, oh
Tonight
