		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Conductor, conductor, conductor)
Ayo

Ayo, everybody think they fly now, but ain't nobody flyer (ah)
You ever cooked a half a brick in the air fryer? (Ah)
Shootin' out the Lambo truck 'til I was tired (boom, boom, boom, boom)
Cases everywhere, burned a hole in the tire
Made his whole face lock up, my shit fire (ah)
Forties in the buffs, but today, I wore the wires (I wore the wires)
Don't talk too loud, Lord, he got the wire (he got the wire)
China flea market aprons on, baggin' China (ah)
Niggas got the Mike Tyson bags here to spite us
Call the y in, I need two niggas snipin'
FLYGOD, everybody wanna be like him
Back of the 'Bach, but I still like to drive it (skrrt)
Nothin' hurt worse than ChineGun dyin'
Nightmares my whole bid, I'm at the showers with the knifers (ah)
P Murda 'bout two cells down, he real righteous
Respected by the one-to-one niggas to the lifers (ah)
We got niggas wearin' shitbags and the diapers
Stomach full of staples, on the fuck nigga diet
Knee on a neck, now everybody riot (fuck the police)
The been killin' niggas, do the math, peep the science (peep the science)
You want my autograph, kiss the hand, I'm your highness (I'm your highness)
Takes the work better, turn to, I'm a psychic (ah)
My niggas shoot your whole block down for excitement (boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
FLYGOD, the one who made thunder and lightning (uh)
Who made water wet, I need sly out confinement
My Coke positive, you drop yours, your shit minus
Woke up, middle of the night, my celly cryin'
The nigga got a l, he realized he gon' die there

Dallas Cowboy Michael Irvin was indicted on two counts of drug possession Monday
He faces up to twenty years in prison if convicted
This stems from a march 4th incident in which police found Irvin
Former teammate Alfredo Roberts, and two female companions
In an Irving Texas motel room 
Along with substantial amounts of Marijuana and Cocaine
