		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Storm is raging
Hail of death from the sky
All guns blazing
Look your fate in the eye
Soon engaging
Dawn of reckoning arrives

Say farewell, we'll meet again
By the gates of Hades
Those who fell, we'll always remember
In the tempest of blades

Feel the thunder
Of the guns shaking ground
Torn asunder
When the hammer comes down
Broken under
Hordes of evil unbound

Say farewell, we'll meet again
By the gates of Hades
Those who fell, we'll always remember
In the tempest of blades

Break it down
Jump, jump, jump, jump
One, two, here we go

When it's over
Hear our victory cries
Wimps and posers
Now shall pay for their lies
Drawing closer
To the end of the line

Say farewell, we'll meet again
By the gates of Hades
Those who fell, we'll always remember
In the tempest of blades

(Say farewell, we'll meet again)
(By the gates of Hades)
Those who fell, we'll always remember
In the tempest of blades, yeah
