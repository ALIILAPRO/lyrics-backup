		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can't take my past
You can't take my history
You could take my pa
But his name's a mystery

Nothing you can take from me was ever worth keepin'
Nothing you can take
Was ever worth keepin' (singing? Is she out of her mind?)
You can't take my charm
You can't take my humor
You can't take my wealth (Capitol says keep rolling)
'Cause it's just a rumor
Nothin' you can take was ever worth keepin'
You can't take my sass
You can't take my talkin'
You can kiss my ass
