		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I cannot take the take, your condition was nod awake 
A selfish crier, boldface liar, robbing all of what you could take in 
Stabbed towards a death, a dirty smelling girl 
Shit decisions, no provisions, filling veins with juice of chaos 

Painted face, olive drab, swollen hole, empty bag, sunken eyes, whining dog
It's times like this you should pray for never 
I broke your fucking mold, then threw away the cast
New religion and new provisions, it's amazing you're alive 

Drop the needle and stop what you're changing into 
Erase the end dissolving, disgrace is needed more 
So I mended severed ties, through flesh we cauterized 
The undeserving, sliming, writhing, I filled you up with watered promise 

Painted face, olive drab, swollen hole, empty bag, sunken eyes, whining dog
It's times like this you should pray for never
Spitting teeth, oral lust, alley fuck, angel dust, anal whore, bleeding knees
It's times like this to pray for murder 

So now I've seen it all
Hells' wrath
No man has greater glory, glory
Cause now, now, now, now you're living through me 

So I'm done with saving you, a gift unto myself
A tired savior, a wasted favor, and I'm lucky I'm alive

Drop the needle and stop what you're changing into
I broke your fucking mold, then threw away the cast

Painted face, olive drab, swollen hole, empty bag, sunken eyes, whining dog
It's times like this you should pray for never
Spitting teeth, oral lust, alley fuck, angel dust, anal whore, bleeding knees
It's times like this to pray for murder

So now I've seen it all
Hells' wrath, Hells' wrath
No man has greater glory, glory
Cause now, now, now, now you're living through me
