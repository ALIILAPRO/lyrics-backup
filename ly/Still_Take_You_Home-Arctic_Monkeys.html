		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, it's ever so funny
'Cause I don't think you're special, I don't think you're cool
You're just probably alright
But under these lights you look beautiful
And I'm struggling, I can't see through your fake tan
Yeah, and you know it for a fact that everybody's eating out of your hands

But what do you know?
Oh, you know nothing
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Oh, yeah, I'll still take you home
So what do you know?
Said, you don't know nothing

Well, fancy seeing you in here
You're all tarted up and you don't look the same
Well, I haven't seen you since last year
Yeah, and surprisingly you have forgotten my name
But you know it, yeah, and you knew it all along
Oh and you say you have forgotten
But you're fibbing, go on, tell me I'm wrong

So what do you know?
Oh, you know nothing
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Oh, yeah, I'll still take you home
So what do you know?
Oh, you don't know nothing, no

Oh-woah, woah, woah
Oh-woah, woah, woah
Da-da, da-da-da, da-da, da-da
Da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Oh-woah, woah, woah

Oh, so what do you know?
Yeah, you don't know nothing, no
Yeah, but I'd still take you home
Oh, yeah, I'll still take you home
I said, what do you know?
Oh, you don't know nothing

I fancy you with a passion
Oh, you're a Topshop princess, a rockstar, too
But you're a fad and you're a fashion
And I'm having a job trying to talk to you
But it's alright, yeah, I'll put it on one side
Oh, 'cause everybody's looking, you've got control of everyone's eyes
Including mine
