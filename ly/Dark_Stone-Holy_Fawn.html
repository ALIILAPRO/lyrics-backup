		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  dark stone moss grown
i was a wall in me
blood-handed climbing trees
foss cliff deep trip
i am the roaring wind
swallowing all that i am

all of the hills i've lied in
pulling the tall grass inward
there was a stillness i've known
for a thousand lives
so many hearts like embers
spit from the fire
but yours is mine

dark stone seeds sown
pouring my blood into
the soil i'm walking through
dark stone half moon
it's like i never die
claw through
come back to life
