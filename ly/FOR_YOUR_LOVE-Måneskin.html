		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Aoh

I wanna be the first man you look at tonight
I wanna be stuck in your head and make you go wild
I wanna drive you 'til the morning light and
I wanna leave you alone in the middle of the night
I wanna be a good man and see you smile
And I wanna swim between your thighs
I wanna fuck you 'til you scream and cry

I wanna hold you in my arms tonight
For your love, I'll do whatever you want
For your love, I'll do whatever you want
I'll do whatever you want, for your love

So baby, why don't you please me now?
So baby, why don't you please me now?
I've got so much I can give to you
Yeah, I've got so much I can give to you

For your love, I'll do whatever you want
For your love, I'll do whatever you want
I'll do whatever you want, for your love, ahi, ahi, ah

So tell me what you want, I'll give you what you want, baby
Tell me what you want, I'll give you what you want, baby
Tell me what you want, I'll give you what you want, baby
Tell me what you want, I'll give you what you want

Because baby, for your love, I'll do whatever you want
For your love, I'll do whatever you want
I'll do whatever you want, for your love
Eh, eh, ehi, ah
