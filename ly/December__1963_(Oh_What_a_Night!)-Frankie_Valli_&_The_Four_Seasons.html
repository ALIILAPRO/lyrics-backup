		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, what a night
Late December back in sixty three
What a very special time for me
As I remember, what a night

Oh, what a night, you know I didn't even know her name
But I was never gonna be the same
What a lady, what a night

Oh, I, I got a funny feelin' when she walked in the room
And my, as I recall it ended much too soon

Oh what a night, hypnotizin' mesmerizing me
She was ev'rything I dreamed she'd be
Sweet surrender, what a night

I felt a rush like a rollin' ball of thunder
Spinnin' my head around and takin' my body under

Oh, what a night

Oh, I, I got a funny feelin' when she walked in the room
And my, as I recall it ended much too soon

Oh, what a night
Why'd it take so long to see the light?
Seemed so wrong, but now it seems so right
What a lady, what a night

Oh I felt a rush like a rollin' ball of thunder
Spinnin' my head around and takin' my body under
Oh what a night
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, oh what a night
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do, oh what a night
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do, oh what a night
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do, oh what a night
