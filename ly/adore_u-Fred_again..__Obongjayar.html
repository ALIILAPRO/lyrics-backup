		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're so much better at everything
And I think no one in my chest, there's no compare
I adore you
Ooh, I adore you
I came first but you're ahead, ahead beyond your years
People try, try to find this thing you've always been
I adore you
Ooh, I adore you

When you pray, you're answered
You walk through life just like a dancer
If I had my way, everyday would be a parade
When you pray, you're answered
You walk through life just like a dancer
If I had my way, everyday would be a parade

Ooh, I adore you
Ooh, I adore you
And I pray, pray you never lose your star
I'm so proud, proud of all that you are
Ooh, I adore you
Ooh, I adore you
I adore you
Ooh, I adore you

When you pray, you're answered
You walk through life just like a dancer
If I had my way, everyday would be a parade
When you pray, you're answered
You walk through life just like a dancer
If I had my way, everyday would be a parade

Ooh, I adore you
Ooh, I adore you
Ooh, I adore you
Ooh, I adore you
And I pray, pray you never lose your star
I'm so proud, proud of all that you are
Ooh, I adore you
Ooh, I adore you
I adore you
Ooh, I adore you

Mouth starts to movin', I will not stop 'cause I'm-
Mouth starts to movin', I will not stop 'cause I'm-
Mouth starts to movin', I will not stop 'cause I'm-
All the way live with so much juice, so
Mouth starts to movin', I will not stop 'cause I'm-
Mouth starts to movin', I will not stop 'cause I'm-
Mouth starts to movin', I will not stop 'cause I'm-
Brr, stick 'em

Ooh, I adore you
Ooh, I adore you
Ooh, I adore you
Ooh, I adore you
Ooh, I adore you

Mouth starts to movin', I will not stop 'cause I'm-
All the way, all the way, all the way, all the way
Don't stop movin', I will not stop 'cause I-
Stick 'em, stick 'em, stick 'em, stick 'em
Mouth starts to movin', I will not stop 'cause I'm
All the way, all the way, all the way, all the way
Mouth starts to movin', I will not stop 'cause I'm
Brr, stick 'em

Ooh, I adore you
Ooh, I adore you
