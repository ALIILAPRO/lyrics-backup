		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pull off my legs
Pull off my wings
You beautiful scarecrow
You pull the strings

You're deep in the shed
You're deep in there
You want all of the things
You can never get

You spend the hour
You suck the air from the room and give me cause to doubt
And here you are in your new career
You leave them all behind
You're such a bad idea

You twist the face
You twist the fence
You're lashing out to see how I react
You're never wanted
You never lived
You beautiful scarecrow
You're unimpaired

No longer slaves
But just the lonely souls took their place
And here you are a charming racketeer
You leave them all behind, you're such a bad idea
