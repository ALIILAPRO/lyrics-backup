		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uzi (yeah)
Pink Tape
Lil Uzi
(Bugz Ronin, he gon' run it up)
Yeah

I sold my soul for Chrome Heart mixed with Carhartt (what?)
Yes, I'm splashin', new fashion, I can't take no loss (loss)
I rock Junya on wannabes, I got no heart (heart)
I put Endless to denim on rims on my car (skrrt, whoa)
I got a Republican doctor (yeah)
Make my ass great again, MAGA (whoa)
Know you mad now, enchilada (yeah)
When bitches test me, it get messy like soccer
I sold my soul for Chrome Heart mixed with Carhartt (whoa)
Yes, I'm splashin', new fashion, I can't take no loss
I rock Junya on wannabes, I got no heart (no wannabe)
I put Endless to denim on rims on my car (skrrt)
I got a Republican doctor (ha)
Make my ass great again, MAGA (whoa)
Bitch, don't make me rag you, pasta (yeah)
I'm number one, you could only be dolce, Gabbana

I got a Chinese girl, yeah, she from Shanghai (ni hao)
She goes to Parsons in New York, got good eye
I know I love her, only saw her two times
I met her at Dover Street Market, good eye

Ayo, even if my name was Natalie Nunn, these bitches still couldn't chin-check me
That's word to Chanel, they ain't nothin' to see, bitches on TV channelin' me
Harajuku Barbie, Roman Zolanski, from Red Ruby to Chun-Li
I put door knocker earrings in Fendi (oh) 
Then stamped the trench coat Burberry
Where the C-O-M-P-E-T-I-T-I-O-N? Don't see any (woo)
Sittin' under stars in the city lights (city lights)
Baby daddy tell me I got pretty eyes (pretty eyes)
Bitches only eatin' when I dust crumbs (dust crumbs)
I stay with that Uzi, I'm his plus one (oop)
I was really in the field with Karl Lager' (oop) 
Now it's Heaven campaigns (R.I.P.)
Check in with Dapper Dan when I'm in Harlem
My niggas'll blow like Virgil, I got that duffel (Virgil), mm
Ooh
Everything we do, you motherfuckers do it too
Heavy on it, tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick do it too
Everything we do, do, do, do, do

These rappers can't dress, yeah, they just be hatin'
I never ratted, but got all the statements
Stopped wearin' Kapital 'cause it got basic
But I still wear Kapital, Uzi, stop fakin'
I used to wear more Number (N)ine than Asians
I mix the Greg Lauren, purple label
My closet too cluttered, clothes on my table
We wore that VLONE 'til it turned faded

Yeah, I'm the reason why niggas wear them Goyard bags (yeah)
It was niggas doin' it but I brought that shit to the hood (I started that shit)
And I made that shit all good (I started that shit)
They don't get my swag, 'cause I'm misunderstood

I sold my soul for Chrome Heart mixed with Carhartt (whoa)
Yes, I'm splashin', new fashion, I can't take no loss
I rock Junya on wannabes, I got no heart
I put Endless to denim on rims on my car (skrrt)
I sold my soul for Chrome Heart mixed with Carhartt (yes)
Yes, I'm splashin', new fashion, I can't take no loss (no)
I rock Junya on wannabes, I got no heart
I put Endless to denim on rims on my car
