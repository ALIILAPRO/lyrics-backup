		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Anger
Sadness
Laughter
Madness

We are one step away from total decay

Slipping
Falling
Closer to biting the concrete

We are one step away
You canâ€™t call this living

Walk the line and pray to your master
Ball and chain, a slave to disaster

Walk the line and pray to your master
Ball and chain, a slave to disaster
This is an omen, a warning, a lesson to take
So listen to the words that I say

Danger
Caution
Proceed
Slowly

I am one step away from losing my sanity

Slipping
Falling
Closer to places that I should not be

I am one step away, annihilate everything

Walk the line and pray to your master
(Embrace the disease)
Ball and chain, a slave to disaster
(Have I just been dreaming?)

Have I just been dreaming?

Walk the line and pray to your master
Ball and chain, a slave to disaster
This is an omen, a warning, a lesson to take
So listen to the words that I say

Heed my warning
And hear my cries
There is no way to escape
This is the end of the line

This is the end of my life
Time waits for no one
This is the end of the line

Walk the line and pray to your master
Ball and chain, a slave to disaster
This is an omen, a warning, a lesson to take
So listen to the words that I say
