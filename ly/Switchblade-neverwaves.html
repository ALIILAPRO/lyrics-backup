		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get alone
I gotta get her alone
Get alone
I gotta get her alone
Alone 
Alone
Cuz she cuts like a switchblade

Lately I
Don't even feel alive
Till she's pierced right through the bone
The bone
The bone

Calling me closer
Keeping me calm
She's carving her name on my heart
Why does she make me her prey?
Why does she kill me this way?

You didn't have to go
You didn't have to go
You didn't have to

Get alone
I gotta get on my own
Get alone
I gotta get on my own
My own
My own
Cuz she lies like a switchblade

Licking my wounds but I
Know I'll never be the same
The same
The same
Cuz she scars like a switchblade

Calling me closer
Keeping me calm
She's carving her name on my heart
Why did she make me her prey?
Why did she kill me this way?

You didn't have to go
You didn't have to go
You didn't have to go

She cut me wide open
Promised she would sew me back together
But she left me on the table
She left me on the table
Kinda hard to walk away
With your guts falling out

You didn't have to go
You didn't have to go
You didn't have to
You didn't have to go
You didn't have to go
You didn't have to go
