		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You spit out the life
It's consumed the isle of disaster
Places gone for I
You could never decide
Days like this I'm slime
I am motionless in the bedroom
I need it to come alive
Barely love, all this time

Gone
It's gone, it's gone
Gone
It's gone, it's gone

You tore off through the night
I watched the sun come up with my capture
I'm what you cherish while
But I never had the time
Gone, a waste of sky
Did I ever tell you I need you?
To lead me through the fog
I feel the silence since I'm fine

Gone
It's gone, it's gone
Gone
It's gone, it's gone

And when the silent come up in line
You falling in and out of love
Gone
It's gone, it's gone

I'm wearing all the signs
Wearing all the time
You used to be much closer to me
Whenever you show
Whenever you fall
These memories warp

And when the silent come up in line
You falling in and out of love
Gone
It's gone, it's gone

Crawling
I'm ashamed I showed
Calling
I'm a teardrop's cup
Crawling
I'm ashamed I showed
Calling
Is my capture gone?
