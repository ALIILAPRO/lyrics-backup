		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say you don't know me, you'll burn
You can refuse, but you'll lose, it's by me
Say you don't want me, you'll learn
Nothin you do will be new, 'cause I'm through

Call me a liar, you knew
You were a fool, but that's cool, it's all right
Call me the Devil, it's true
Some can't accept but I crept inside you

So if a stranger calls you
Don't let him whisper his name
'Cause it's Voodoo, oh!

Fade into shadow, you'll burn
Your fortune is free, I can see it's no good
Never look back, never turn
It's a question of time 'till your mine and you learn

So if a stranger sees you
Don't look in his eyes
'Cause he's Voodoo!

Say you don't know me, you'll burn
You can refuse, but you'll lose, it's by me
Say you don't want me, you'll learn
Nothin you do will be new, 'cause I'm through

Voodoo!

Bring me your children, they'll burn!
Never look back, never turn!
Cry me a river, you'll learn Voodoo!!
