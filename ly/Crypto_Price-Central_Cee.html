		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You are now listening to Young Chencs)
We outside (we outside)
Told homegirl that it's home time
Goodbye, go home with your negative vibe
Told bro that I'd lost my pride
I was dreamin' of this shit the whole time

We outside (we outside)
I told mum that I won't live a life of crime (we outside)
How you tellin' yourself that you can't
And you ain't even tried one time? (One time)
Told homegirl that it's home time
Goodbye, go home with your negative vibe (goodbye)
Long time I've been sellin' this white
But Alhamdulillah that I never did time (Alhamdulillah)
I'm ahead of my time in 1998, I was in '09
Should of known better, that bitch was a set up
She was schemin' on the kid the whole time
Told bro that I'd lost my pride
I was dreamin' of this shit whole time
But I'm in two minds, it goes up and down like the crypto price

Up and down, up and down like crypto
Short and sweet, when I doggy that one, she gotta go on her tiptoes
I don't usually, ah 
Let me watch my language
You ain't, you ain't fuck with them boys before
I like how your body untampered
Real bad bitch with standard
Oh no, I'm hitting it raw, like I wanna give mumsy a grandkid (oh no)
Straight in no practice, X Factor got five star rankin' (alright)
Can't handle the back shots
Give her the wood and she started plankin' (pressure)
I gave her the mental break down D, when I left she started rantin'

We outside (we outside)
I told mum that I won't live a life of crime (we outside)
How you tellin' yourself that you can't
And you ain't even tried one time? (One time)
Told homegirl that it's home time
Goodbye, go home with your negative vibe (goodbye)
Long time I've been sellin' this white
But Alhamdulillah that I never did time (Alhamdulillah)
I'm ahead of my time in 1998, I was in '09
Should of known better, that bitch was a set up
She was schemin' on the kid the whole time
Told bro that I'd lost my pride
I was dreamin' of this shit whole time
But I'm in two minds, it goes up and down like the crypto price

I don't know why they envy me
Don't ask questions, this ain't the Breakfast Club
And you ain't no Angela Yee (nah)
Huh, I've been outta town for a month
Now I'm back in the B (I'm in Bush)
Gotta mind how you're chattin' to me
Let your actions speak, stop draggin' your feet
You don't want a catastrophe (you don't want that)
My darg's got serious anger issues (bah, bah, bah)
And he's cattin' to squeeze
It's steamin', so I told him to leave it
I pree'd it, it's mad inconvenient (ah)
Strategic, it won't happen immediate
If needed, still slap on a eediat
Bro's screamin' "Less pattern this evenin'"
(Alright, fuck it then, we outside)

We outside (we outside)
I told mum that I won't live a life of crime (we outside)
How you tellin' yourself that you can't
And you ain't even tried one time? (One time)
Told homegirl that it's home time
Goodbye, go home with your negative vibe (goodbye)
Long time I've been sellin' this white
But Alhamdulillah that I never did time (Alhamdulillah)
I'm ahead of my time in 1998, I was in '09
Should of known better, that bitch was a set up
She was schemin' on the kid the whole time
Told bro that I'd lost my pride
I was dreamin' of this shit whole time
But I'm in two minds, it goes up and down like the crypto price
