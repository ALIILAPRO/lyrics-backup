		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Last night I said these words to my girl
I know you never even try, girl
Come on (come on), come on (come on)
Come on (come on), come on (come on) 
Please, please me, whoa yeah, like I please you

You don't need me to show the way, love
Why do I always have to say, love
Come on (come on), come on (come on)
Come on (come on), come on (come on) 
Please, please me, whoa yeah, like I please you

I don't want to sound complaining
But you know there's always rain in my heart (in my heart)
I do all the pleasing with you
It's so hard to reason with you
whoa yeah, why do you make me blue?

Last night I said these words to my girl
I know you never even try, girl
Come on (come on), come on (come on)
Come on (come on), come on (come on)
Please, please me, whoa yeah, like I please you
(Please me) whoa yeah, like I please you
(Please me) whoa yeah, like I please you
