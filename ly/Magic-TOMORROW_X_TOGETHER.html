		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember how I used to be so
Stuck in one place so cold
Feeling like my heart just froze
Nowhere to go
With no one, nobody

Suddenly you came through
Making me make a move
Nobody got it like you
I can't look away
I can't

'Cause baby, you're a real one, real one
Teaching me to feel something so strong (strong)
We could reach out and grab it

Oh, it's just like magic
Feeling your touch
Oh, it's a rush
No one else has it
Oh, just like magic (just like magic)

Oh it's just like magic
Holding me tight
Giving me life
Oh, it's magic (magic)
Oh, it's magic (oh, it's just like magic)
Oh, it's magic, oh, it's magic
(Just like magic) oh, it's magic
Magic

Used to be so afraid (afraid)
'Fraid of all the games we played (played)
Waited around all day
Nowhere to go
With no one, nobody

Hoping someone would save me
Till you called out my name
Something in me just changed
Got me awake
Got me

Baby, you're a real one, real one
Teaching me to feel something so strong (strong)
We could reach out and grab it

Oh, it's just like magic
Feeling your touch
Oh, it's a rush
No one else has it
Oh, just like magic (just like magic)

Oh, it's just like magic
Holding me tight
Giving me life
Oh, it's magic (magic)
Oh, it's magic (oh, it's just like magic)

Everybody clap your hands
If you've got a broken heart, just take a chance
I say everybody clap your hands
If you've got a broken heart, just take a chance
I say everybody clap your hands
If you've got a broken heart, just take a chance
I say everybody clap your hands
If you've got a broken heart, just take a chance
I say everybody clap your hands
If you've got a broken heart, just take a chance
I say everybody clap your hands
If you've got a broken heart, just take a chance, I say

Oh, it's just like magic (just like magic, yeah)
Feeling your touch
Oh, it's a rush
No one else has it
Oh, just like magic (just like magic)

Oh, it's just like magic (just like magic)
Holding me tight
Giving me life
Oh, it's magic (magic)
Oh, it's magic (oh it's just like magic)

Everybody clap your hands
If you've got a broken heart, just take a chance
I say everybody clap your hands
If you've got a broken heart, just take a chance, say (magic)
