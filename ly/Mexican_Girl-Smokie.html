		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Juanita came to me last night and she cried over and over
Ooh, Daddy I love you you know and I think it's the moonlight
She looked so fine, well she looked alright and she moaned
Ooh, Daddy move over

Oh, baby you know what I like and I think it's the moonlight
Made in Mexico, schooled in France ooh la lovin'
She needed no teachin'
Oh man, I can say international ways, I believe in

Mexican girl, don't leave me alone
I got a heart as big as a stone and I need you, believe me
To be here and love me tonight
Mexican girl, I want you to stay, you know my heart is
Longing to say that as long as I live I will always
Remember the one that I called my Mexican girl

Her skin was soft as the velvet sky
And her hair it shone in the moonlight
As the music did play well the night turned to day
And I held her tight

Then she looked at me with her dark brown eyes and she
Whispered, "Hasta La Vista!"
I don't know what it means but it sounded so good so
I kissed her

Mexican girl, don't leave me alone
I got a heart as big as a stone and I need you, believe me
To be here and love me tonight
Mexican girl I want you to stay, you know my heart is
Longing to say that as long as I live I will always
Remember the one that I called my

Mexican girl, don't leave me alone
I got a heart as big as a stone and I need you, believe me
To be here and love me tonight
Mexican girl I want you to stay, you know my heart is
Longing to say that as long as I live I will always
Remember the one that I called
My Mexican girl
