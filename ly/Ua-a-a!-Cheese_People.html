		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want to be a doll in your collection
I don't want to be a reason of your erection
I don't want to be your little pretty superstar
Now i want to be alone, give me a keys from car!

We're on different sides of fightfield
It's a start of war
(Start of war) 
We could just discuss a problem
But u seat in hole
I can leave my trench and talk
But I'm afraid I could
(Afraid I could)
Take my load gun
You'll be target
Then i just can shoot!

Uaaaa
Uaaaa
Uaaaa
Uaaaa

I don't want to be a honey on your piece of bread
You can tell me that you love me, but I know you mad
I don't want to be a flower in your hill of dung
Now I want to be alone, I think I'm very drunk

We're on different sides of fightfield
It's a start of war
(Start of war)
We could just discuss a problem
But u seat in hole
I can leave my trench and talk
But I'm afraid I could
(Afraid I could)
Take my load gun
You'll be target
Than i just can shoot!

Uaaaa
Uaaaa
Uaaaa
Uaaaa

Uaaaa
Uaaaa
Uaaaa
Uaaaa
