		  Ugh
Ahh
Ok, I suppose that's just how these racks move
Ah
Ok, I suppose that's just how these racks move
Tell me what I'm supposed to do when these racks blue
Tell me what I'm supposed to do when these racks blue
Tell me what I'm supposed cause I'm feeling drowsy
These niggas tryna impose me
They tryna fight me now
These niggas ain't beside you now
I'm tryna change my life around
Niggas tryna take my life now
Ima hit it once, then lights out
Say, I can spend 100, that's easy
Say, I can spend 100 on pleasing
Say, I can spend 100 on dangers
Spend 100 on staff, another 100 on bags
We can get it, it's just that easy
Lose 100 from a girl named Keisha
Running routes like it's football season
Running routes like I should've, should've
I know I did what I could've, could've
I wish it was that simple
But it's harder when you came out the gutter
We missing pieces to fit in the puzzle
More of a reason to put it together
But I got some time to make my own decisions
And I got more time to make me some more money
And do some more living
Why, why, why
Why, why, why
Why, why, why
Look at money like why, why, why
I can't disguise
Why, why, why
Why, why, why
Why, why, why
And I'm good
I got money on me, like ugh
Said I won't spend it, when I know that I would
You can have her back, cause yo girl, she a dub
I ain't talking back to these niggas, these scrubs
I can give you back to the streets, they love you
Don't know how to act, I ain't got time for it
I ain't going back, only time to move forward
Just tell me where you at cause I'm tryna be-
Just tell me where you at cause I'm tryna be fortunate
I don't wanna see you, less fortunate
How many B's? Need more than six
I don't think I got much love to give
I feel like you can give much more than that
Tell me how you feel, put your voice in it
Give me your opinion, you voicing it
I know how it feel to be forced in it
I don't think you got much choice in this
I don't think you got much choice in this
No choice in it
No choice in it
