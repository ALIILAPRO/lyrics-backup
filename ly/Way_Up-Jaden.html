Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, we on the way up (way up)
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, we on the way up (way up)
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, we on the way up (way up)

I went from boy to a man, wow (man)
Opposition had to stand down
Man I had to make a perfect plan, now I'm on the wave
(Wave, wave, wave)
I had to fight for the city (for the city)
I had to fight for the people (for the people)
You gotta do what all leaders do (go)
Everyone here, we believe in you (yeah)
Know you can be a hero 'cause we seen you do it (woo)
And this is the time that we needin' you (you)
Everyone is here to see you move (move)
Winnin', we winnin', we winnin' (we winnin')
We put a world on a wave (wave)
And every time you swinging through the city
You are the saving the day (let's go)

Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, we on the way up (way up)
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, we on the way up (way up)
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, we on the way up (way up)
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, we on the way up (way up)

We had to fight for the town (town)
Now there's no villains allowed ('lowed)
Everyone cheer in the crowd
But I'm still way up, I'm over the clouds (clouds)
We had to fight for the city (city)
Competition was lethal (lethal)
Honestly it's no biggie (biggie)
I had to do what all leaders do
Uh, oh, they don't want it man
Uh, oh, they don't want it, I promise
Uh, oh, they don't want it man
Uh, oh, they don't want it, I promise (promise)
Uh, oh, they don't want it man
Uh, oh, they can't handle my problems (problems)
They always hate on us, but they can't do it without us

Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, we out here cleanin' the streets (streets)
We don't accept the defeat ('feat)
We keep on going until we win (win)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, all of 'em weak in the knees (knees)
Deer in headlights when they freeze (freeze)
But we keep on going until we win

Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, we on the way up (way up)
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, we on the way up (way up)
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, we on the way up (way up)
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, we on the way up (way up)

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

(Way up)
