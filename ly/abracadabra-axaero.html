		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I told my bro to pass the joint
'Cause lately I've been feelin' down
So I take a couple hits and now I'm high up in the clouds
I don't wanna feel a thing, yeah, I'd rather pass out
Smoked so much till I can't feel now
And now this girl, she called my phone, but I'm not picking up
Just leave a message after tone, 'cause I'm all up in my zone
I'm gettin' high from all the dough
I go puff, puff, pass, then I pass it to my bro
Yuh, and all these bitches playin' games
So you know that I can't trust
And I can't really face you 'cause I'm high from all the drugs
This a vibe and I don't want it to be over
That girl told me stop, but I'm never stayin' sober
So I take a couple more shots to the brain
And I don't really care 'bout what they say
'Cause I'ma do my thing, yeah, I'ma do it my way
So I roll another blunt and take it straight to the face
