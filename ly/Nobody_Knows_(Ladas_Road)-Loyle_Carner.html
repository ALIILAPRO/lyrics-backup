		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Nobody knows all the trouble I've seen)
(Nobody knows all the sorrow)

Check, I told the black man, he didn't understand
I reached the white man, he wouldn't take my hand
I sat alone in the shadows of a man
With my eyes closed, told myself I should've ran
I'm the boss and I'm supposed to have the plan
But can't think 'til I figure who I am
Are you lost? Uh, or are you just another man?
Sittin' in my sunshine tryna catch a tan

Listen outside I can feel the sun's rain
I love it, inside I was bumping John Wayne
Made P's, you can never say the wrong name
ADHD say my last one long game
And don't fuck it up say reveal nothing
Guys I used to run with say they still puffin'
But what did they expect? Yo, what did they expect?
Ayy, yo, I used to never think of the effect
When my dad passed straight biological neglect
The other one sunset sittin' on the steps
I was left, mom came heavy in her breath
Tears on my face transferring to her chest
I was left and she would say he ain't comin'
Uh, but I can tell him that you love him
And I would shout, "Nah, love means nothing"
Say I want a hug I wanna talk I want something

See, I reached the black man, he wouldn't take my hand
Told the white man, he didn't understand
I sat alone in the shadows of a man
With my eyes closed, told myself I should've ran
I'm the boss and I'm supposed to have the plan
But can't think 'til I figure who I am
Are you lost? (Lost) or are you just another man?
Sittin' in my sunshine

My eyes wide, tears cried
The news lied, but he died
So who am I?
Ay, yo, I'm asking who am I?
Because my kid will maybe have them blue eyes
And he will understand the pain that's in mine
And late at night I wonder maybe that's why
Because I never wanna hear the same cry
From a kid who doesn't fit in
To the world that he live in
A half-caste just kiddin'
Wear a mask just kiddin'
Move ass just whip it
Yeah, no sittin', there's no livin'
Ayy, yo, you can't hate the roots of the tree
And not hate the tree
So how can I hate my father
Without hating me?

I told the black man, he didn't understand
Reached the white man, he wouldn't take my hand
Sat alone in the shadows of a man
With my eyes closed, told myself I should've ran
I'm the boss and I'm supposed to have the plan
But can't think 'til I figure who I am
Are you lost? Or are you just another man?
Sittin' in my sunshine tryna catch a tan

Glory (glory)
Glory (glory)
Glory (glory, hallelujah)
Say it again
(Glory) say it to the Lord
(Glory) mmh
Glory, hallelujah
