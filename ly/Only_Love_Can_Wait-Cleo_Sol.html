		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Only love can wait (only love)
Only love can wait (only love)
Only love can wait (only love)
Only love can wait (only love)

You are so gentle yet so hard
But it's hard to be different
Be strong
You are the joy in others' life
There's times when you need someone
To be there
You have a gift inside
So why are you hiding?
Why are you hiding?
Oh, you are the way
So don't rush your peace
It's forever
Forever

Only love can wait (only love)
Only love can wait (only love)
Only love can wait (only love)
Only love can wait (only love)

Only love can wait (only love)
Only love can wait (only love)
Only love can wait (only love)
Only love will wait for us to get it right

Only love can wait (only love, only love)
Only love can wait (only love)
Only love can wait (only love, only love will wait)
Only love can wait this long
