		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can see now the road is clear 
Been looking for the signs there to steer me
Break a mold that's ages old 
Shake patterns from the trees towering above me 
Oh like a newborn baby 
I will begin again 
And I open up my arms wide and I'm not holding on 
Free to be me beautiful and strong 
It's a beautiful life 
It's a beautiful life if you let it be

I found the key to my loneliness 
I had to find new space with in
Life in perpetual motion 
I keep moving on 
And I open up my arms wide and I'm not holding on 
Free to be me beautiful and strong 
It's a beautiful life 
It's a beautiful life if you let it be

Stop letting fear distance one another 
Can we be good to each other 
Can you hear me crying through these growing pains can you hear me laughing through these growing pains 
Oh my heart is open, is open, is open 
Oh my heart is open, is open 
It's a beautiful life 
It's a beautiful life if you let it be
It's a beautiful life 
It's a beautiful life if you let it be
