		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm so tired of screaming
When no one is listening
Why do I keep pretending
The world is more than empty?
(The world is more than empty)

These empty streets are all I see
As I'm walking down this broken road
The path to nowhere leads me home
Burned down with an echo
Days come but they don't go
Why's the world I'm living in
So fucked up beyond recognition?

I can't spend another night
Living life like I'm falling on the knife
'Cause it pulls out the breath from my lungs till I'm dead
I can't get out the thoughts in my head

I'm so tired feeling
Like something is missing
The war inside is heavy
Nobody seems to get me
I'm tired of screaming
When no one is listening
Why do I keep pretending
The world I see is more than empty?

Cut out my tongue, my voice is gone
Yeah, there's nothing left for me to say
'Cause they don't hear me anyway
I fade out like an echo, I'm trying harder to let go
The world is cruel and unforgiving
Fucked up beyond recognition

I can't spend another night
Living life like I'm falling on the knife
'Cause it pulls out the breath from my lungs till I'm dead
I can't get out the thoughts in my head

I'm so tired of feeling
Like something is missing
The war inside is heavy
Nobody seems to get me
I'm tired of screaming
When no one is listening
Why do I keep pretending
The world I see is more than empty?

And I just wanna know that I am not alone
'Cause all I hear are echoes

No one can hear me, like I'm screaming alone
Till I'm dead in my heart and I bleed in my throat
Should I let go? 'Cause all I hear are echoes
Why can't they hear me? Am I screaming alone?
Till I'm dead in my heart and I bleed in my throat
Should I let go? 'Cause all I hear are echoes

I'm so tired of feeling
Like something is missing
The war inside is heavy
Nobody seems to get me
I'm tired of screaming
When no one is listening
Why do I keep pretending
The world I see is more than empty?
The world I see is more than empty
