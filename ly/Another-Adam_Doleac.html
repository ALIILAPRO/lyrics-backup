		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put another record on, pour another glass of wine
Rock another night of us losing all track of time
Everything you do just makes me want some more of you

Every smile, every kiss, every second that I get
Every little look you give me like that
Every night, every day, every memory that we make
Baby, you ain't even gotta ask
I'll always want another dance
Another chance to hold your hand
Yeah, from the second that we fell into each other
Knew I was never gonna ever wanna
Never every gonna want another
Knew I was never ever gonna wanna
(Never ever gonna wanna)

Another smile, sleepy eyes, waking up right next to me
A million more just like last night
You and me on repeat

Every smile, every kiss
Every second that I get
Every little look you give me like that
Every night, every day, every memory that we make
Baby, you ain't even gotta ask
I'll always want another dance
Another chance to hold your hand
Yeah, from the second that we fell into each other
Knew I was never gonna ever wanna
Never ever gonna want another, ah yeah
Never ever gonna want another
Oh no, no

Everything you do
Just makes me want some more of you
Yeah baby, ain't another who
Could ever love me like you do

Every smile, every kiss, every second that I get
Every little look you give me like that
(Little look you give me like that)
Every night, every day, every memory that we make
Baby, you ain't even gotta ask
I'll always want another dance
Another chance to hold your hand
Yeah, from the second that we fell into each other
Knew I was never gonna ever wanna
Never ever gonna want another
Knew I was never gonna ever wanna
Never ever gonna wanna
Oh
