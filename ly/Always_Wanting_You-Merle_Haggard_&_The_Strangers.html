		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Always wanting you, but never having you
Makes it hard to face tomorrow
'Cause I know I'll wake up wanting you again
Always loving you, but never touching you
Sometimes hurts me almost more than I can stand

I'd been better off if I'd turned away
And never looked at you the second time
'Cause I really had my life all together till your eyes met mine

And there I say a yearning and a feeling 'cross the room
That you felt for me
Wish I'd had a way of knowing that the things we had in mind
Could never be

Always wanting you, but never having you
Makes it hard to face tomorrow
'Cause I know I'll wake up wanting you again
Always loving you, but never touching you
Sometimes hurts me almost more than I can stand

Always loving you, but never touching you
Sometimes hurts me almost more than I can stand
