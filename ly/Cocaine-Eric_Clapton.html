		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you want to hang out, you've gotta take her out, cocaine
If you want to get down, down on the ground, cocaine

She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie
Cocaine

If you got bad news, you want to kick them blues, cocaine
When your day is done, and you want to run, cocaine

She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie
Cocaine

If your day is gone, and you want to ride on, cocaine
Don't forget this fact, you can't get it back, cocaine

She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie
Cocaine

She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie
Cocaine

Cocaine
