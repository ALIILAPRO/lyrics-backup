		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm so happy, 'cause you are gone
You are gone, it makes me happy
I've been wating for so long
I thought this day would never come
When I could wave and say Good Bye

I'm so happy, do you know why?
Do you know what makes me happy?
A whole day is going by
Without a single thought of you
And I can smile cause you're not near

La la la la la la

I'm so happy 'cause you're not here
You're not here, it makes me happy
Finally you disappear
Don't wanna know where you are going
but you should stay were you belong

I'm so happy and that ain't wrong
There's nothing wrong with being happy
If you did listen to the song
We all can do this part together
Just grab your dearest and sing along!

La la la la la la

I'm so happy, 'cause you are gone
You are gone, it makes me happy
I've been waiting for so long
I thought this day would never come
When I can wave and say Good Bye.
