		  Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight (Jae5)

Too rare to die so heaven can wait
I went thru hell just to get to this stage
I live my life and I live it my way
Girl by my side but that's just my side bae
Anything you want girl I go pay
Don gorgon I need money like Dangote
Uncle sexy my only nephew that be Wray
Mix the rum with the red bull just dey play

They got so much to say
But they don't won't say it to my face
Two more shots of 1942
Cah I no want remember today
Baby girl said that she love me for me
But I think that she love me for p's
She popped a pill so she wide awake
Born broke but we found a way

Tonight
I'ma just ride
I'ma let my body do the talking baby
Take time
Baby take time
Liquor in your body can you feel it baby?
All of the vibes I'm feeling
Got all my senses tingling
Tonight we can just ride
We can just ride

We dey together like Kenkey and pepper
Arsenal and Saka
Tracksuit and a trapper
Ride or die, my right-hand blaster
My crime time partner
My night-time banger
Face ten, body peng and she bang a skeng
From her friends, she don't wanna hear their two cents about men, irrelevant
Me, her one element, we don't come in segments

She want me and me only
Told her if you really love me better show me
When I was down they didn't know me
Telling people you know me that was the old me
Gotta leave in the morning I got a early flight
Gave her dick soo good we had a early night
You know I'm feeling you, you don't need to fight
Friends told me not to but I still might

Tonight
I'ma just ride
I'ma let my body do the talking baby
Take time
Baby take time
Liquor in your body can you feel it baby?
All of the vibes I'm feeling
Got all my senses tingling
Tonight we can just ride
We can just ride

Keep my business close cuh looku looku too much
She wants loving, fucking, choking
Ma pariwo when I'm fucking ya
She wants me but I'm somebody's lover
Tonight ay ay ay
She na red wine ay ay ay
From the bedroom to the living room
Many tings go sup ay ay ay

Olohun o mind ti'n ba come over
Olohun o shy as she come closer
Like my first zeggay take a man high
Your body language talk to me nice
She say she nuh loud she such a liar
Only your matter before my matter
Made me say wow gyalie so wild
Made me say wow she come around

Tonight
I'ma just ride
I'ma let my body do the talking baby
Take time
Baby take time
Liquor in your body can you feel it baby?
All of the vibes I'm feeling
Got all my senses tingling
Tonight we can just ride
We can just ride
