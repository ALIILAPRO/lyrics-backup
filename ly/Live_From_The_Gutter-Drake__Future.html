Ah
(I woke up like this)

Reportin' live from the fuckin' gutter, bitch
I ain't talkin' but some big money shit
I ain't talkin' nothin' but big money shit
I ain't talkin' nothin' but big money, bitch

Reportin' live from the gutter
I'll buy these motherfuckers talkin' big money shit, bitch
Straight up out the gutter, never had shit
Now we got 90210 on our address
Talkin' ten mil' just to get an asset
I know them tears still fallin' down on my last bitch
This money made me hungry I'm a savage
I've seen stars linin' up you couldn't imagine
I watched my broad give up on me like I'm average
I went back inside the attic, counted up and started laughin', ha
I went back inside the attic, counted up and started laughin', ha (Freebandz)
Ha, Cuban links hangin' on my wrist, I was on welfare
Wake up in the house, I look up, I see bales everywhere
I see girls everywhere, I see scales everywhere
I see hell everywhere, I get mail everywhere
Walked inside the booth and came out in a Learjet
A fiend for that lean I ain't even started drinkin' beer yet
They bust the trap, I live there
Came out clean, I ain't clean my niggas still there
Just imagine you was livin' lavish and they still there
Wake up in the crib, pools sittin' on the hill now
I just need some niggas with me that gon' keep it real now
Got a lot of pretty bitches, I just pay they bills now
Money make 'em feel good, but, damn, she make me feel good
Known for gettin' that guala out in Europe, but I'm still hood
Known to pop a bottle on a model, fuck her like I'm on my last damn dollar

Reportin' live from the fuckin' gutter, bitch
I ain't talkin' but some big money shit
I ain't talkin' nothin' but big money shit
I ain't talkin' nothin' but big money, bitch

Yeah, reportin' live from the gutter, I will buy this motherfucker
It's not even a discussion (woo)
And I got my niggas with me, yeah, yeah
She gon' end up dippin' with me, yeah, yeah
And I got her trippin' off of yay, yay
Pillow talkin' dishin' out on all y'all
In one ear and out the other
Shut your mouth and take what's comin'
Live from the gutter dog, yeah, yeah
She don't want pets but I'm a dog, yeah, yeah
And she love it dog, yeah, yeah
And she love it dog, yeah, yeah
On the Billboards, all we do is pop shit
Soon as night fall, that's when we lock in
This for my niggas on that bullshit and that nonsense
This for my dogs that go Karrueche with the chopsticks, woo
And we gon miss you
They don't want no smoke, they don't want no issue
But these the times we gotta live through
But these the times we gotta live through
And I'm

Reportin' live from the fuckin' gutter, bitch
I ain't talkin' but some big money shit
Reportin' live from the damn gutter
Swear to God, I'll buy this motherfucker, ah
