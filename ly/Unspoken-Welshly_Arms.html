		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drunk up all the wine on the back porch
Listen to the rain through the willow trees
Must have been something in the melody

Tried to play it off but your eyes roll
I know I said things that I didn't mean
We've never been good at apologies

So just lay close to me
We don't have to say sorry
Your touch still speaks
Words are too heavy

So don't just breathe
Even though we feel broken
Sometimes love is unspoken

Bullets from the tongue always hurt more
We both know the heart's not bulletproof
I know where to aim when I want to
And maybe we're not perfect right now
But I know we will figure this out

So just lay close to me
We don't have to say sorry
Your touch still speaks
Words are too heavy

So don't just breathe
Even though we feel broken
Sometimes love is unspoken

Lay close to me
We don't have to say sorry
Your touch still speaks
Words are too heavy

So don't just breathe
Even though we feel broken
Sometimes love is unspoken
Sometimes love is unspoken

Sometimes love is unspoken
