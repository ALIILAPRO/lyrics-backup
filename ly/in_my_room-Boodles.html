		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's so hot here in my room
I need a fucking shower
I'm so lonely in these shoes
I wish i had the power to be social
But i'm not so sure
If i go out there in the real world would i score you?
It's so hot here in my room
I need a fucking shower
I'm so lonely in these shoes
I wish i had the power to be social
But i'm not so sure
If i go out there in the real world would i score you?
It's so hot here in my room
I need a fucking shower
I'm so lonely in these shoes
I wish i had the power to be social
But i'm not so sure
If i go out there in the real world would i score you?
Hit me up, i want you to hit me up yeah,
I don't wanna bother so i choose to keep it silent
I don't know if you are interested in me in person
So hit me up, i want you to hit me up yeah,
I don't wanna come and look like someone that is creepy
I feel lonely and in need of someone that can heal me
I'm tired of fuckin' swiping when i match yea they don't need me
I'm tired of fuckin' looking cuz i don't fit in with normies
My eyes blurry again
I hope it's not tears cuz i'm tired of cryin
But what can i do
I'm about to go boom
Cuz right now i feel like
It's so hot here in my room
I need a fucking shower
I'm so lonely in these shoes
I wish i had the power to be social
But i'm not so sure
If i go out there in the real world would i score you?
It's so hot here in my room
I need a fucking shower
I'm so lonely in these shoes
I wish i had the power to be social
But i'm not so sure
If i go out there in the real world would i score you?
I--L-O-V-E--Y-O-U
Fuck
