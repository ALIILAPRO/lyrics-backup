		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can’t explain why I
Cry so hard
Try so hard
Surround me with doves
In the town where you grew up
People stay inside their houses
And still you see their faces
All the different places you go

Does it hurt to be so cold?
There’s a chance it wasn’t so
Is it worth it to grow old?
Quick because I’m running out
I don’t wanna know

Tell me (I don’t wanna know)
Tell me (I don’t wanna know)
Tell me (I don’t wanna know)
Tell me (I don’t wanna know)

Tell me
Tell me
Tell me
Tell me

I can’t explain why I
Cry so hard
Try so hard
Surround me with doves
In the town where you grew up
People stay inside their houses
And still you see their faces
All the different places you go
