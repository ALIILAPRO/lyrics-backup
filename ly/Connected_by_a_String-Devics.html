		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Two sisters apart
Connected by a sring
Never mind the bombs in Tel Aviv
Never mind me chasing empty dreams
I will not go back there
And she will never leave
And so the only thing is our little string

the same stars above us
But miles in between
And so the only thing
Is our little string

two sisters apart
Connected by a dream
I see her in my dreams
She's always in my dreams
She was once a tiny thing
Always running right to me
And I would run to her
Connected by a string

the same stars above us
But miles in between
And so the only thing
Is our little string
