		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh baby, mm
Dedicated to all the pretty girls 
All the pretty girls
All the pretty girls in the world 
And the ugly girls too 
'Cause to me your pretty anyway, baby 

You give me your number, I'll call you up 
You act like your pussy on interrupt 
I don't have no problem with you fucking me 
But I have a little problem with you not fucking me 
Baby, you know I'ma take care of you 
'Cause you say you got my baby, and I know it ain't true 
Is it a good thing? No, it's bad, bitch 
For good or worse, makes you switch 
So I walk on over with my Cristal 
Bitch-ass niggas, put away your pistols 
Dirty won't be having it in this house 
'Cause, bitch, I'll cripple your style 
Now that you heard my charmin' voice 
You couldn't get another nigga, your coochie won't get moist 
If you wanna look good and not be bummy
Girl, you better give me that money, oh

Hey, Dirty
Baby, I got your money 
Don't you worry, I said hey
Baby, I got your money 
Hey, Dirty
Baby, I got your money 
Don't you worry, I said hey
Baby, I got your money 

Yo, so I glanced at the girl, girl glanced at me 
I whispered in her ear, "You wanna be with me?"
You wanna look pretty though, in my video 
Ol' Dirty on the hat and I let you all know 
Just dance if you caught up in the Holy Ghost trance 
If you stop, I'ma put them killer ants in your pants 
I'm the O-D-B as you can see 
FBI, don't you be watching me 
I don't want no problems, 'cause I'll put you down 
In the ground where you can not be found 
I'm just Dirt Dog tryna make some money
So give me my streaks and give me my honey 
Radios play this all day, everyday 
Recognize I'ma fool and you love me
None of you nuh better look at me funny 
Nuh, you know my name, now give me my money

Hey, Dirty (sing it)
Baby, I got your money (sing it, girls)
Don't you worry, I said hey (yes, sing it right now)
Baby, I got your money (if Dirty want his money, I think y'all should give him his money)
Hey, Dirty
Baby, I got your money (that's how I like it, girl)
Don't you worry, I said hey
Baby, I got your money 

Sexy, sexy, sexy
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Sexy, sexy, sexy

Yo, yo
Nigga playing in the club like this all night 
Bitches put your ass out, let me hold it tight 
You're looking at my wrist saying "It's so nice" 
The price, bitch, is diamonds, shining disco light 
Girl, you better help me solve my problem 
I'ma get this money and rob them 
Lucky Dog when I won the lotto 
Ran up on my car for carrying Rollo 
But hold on, you can call me Dirty
And then lift up your skirt 
And you want some of this Dirty
God made Dirt and Dirt bust your ass 
Stop annoying me, yeah, I play my music loud 
It takes the Bastard, Ol' Dirty, to move the crowd 
They say he had his dick in his mouth 
Eddie Murphy taught me that back in the house 
Now give me my money

Hey, Dirty
Baby, I got your money 
Don't you worry, I said hey
Baby, I got your money 
Hey, Dirty (I wanna here)
Baby, I got your money 
Don't you worry, I said hey
Baby, I got your money 

Hey, Dirty (sexy, sexy, sexy)
Baby, I got your money 
Don't you worry, I said hey (sexy, sexy, sexy)
Baby, I got your money 
Hey, Dirty
Baby, I got your money 
Don't you worry, I said hey
Baby, I got your money 

Hey, Dirty
Baby, I got your money 
Don't you worry, I said hey
Baby, I got your money 
Hey, Dirty
Baby, I got your money 
Don't you worry, I said hey
