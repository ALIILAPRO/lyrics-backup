		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, Tez keeps telling me he just turned thirty
Having dreams of being single forever he's getting worried
And I'm scared too 'cause I'm in the same boat
Good women are rare too, none of them have came close
Me, I haven't changed much, you know how I play it
Better safe than sorry
Instead of searching for substance at every single party
Baby, being part of this life
I feel like I'm bound to end up with somebody that's been with everybody
I need you to rescue me from my destiny
I'm tryna live right and give you whatever's left of me
Yeah, 'cause you know life is what we make it
And a chance is like a picture, it'd be nice if you just take it
Or let me take it for you
I'm just down to ride
We can roll around the city 'til you finally decide
I got more than a thing for you, tattoo and ink for you
Right over my heart, girl, I do the unthinkable

Moment of honesty
Someone's gotta take the lead tonight
Who's it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here
And tell you all that comes to me
If you have something to say
You should say it right now
(You should say it right now)
You ready?

You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it (let it go)
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it

I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy? (Make us look crazy)
If you ask me, I'm ready
(I'm ready, I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready
(I'm ready, I'm ready) yeah, uh

I know you once said to me
"This is exactly how it should feel when it's meant to be"
Time is only wasting, so why wait for eventually?
If we gon' do something 'bout it
We should do it right now
(We should do it right now)

Bae, uh
You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it (let it go)
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
It is what we make it

I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy? (Make us look crazy)
Or would it be so beautiful?
Either way, I'm saying
If you ask me, I'm ready
(I'm ready, I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready
(I'm ready, I'm ready)

Yeah, yeah
Say
I give up before we try
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away, fly away
I can't say I came prepared
I'm suspended in the air
Won't you come be in the sky with me

I was wondering maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy? (Make us look crazy)
Or would it be so beautiful?
Either way, I'm saying
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)
