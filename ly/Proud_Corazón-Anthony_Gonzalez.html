		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say that I'm crazy or call me a fool
But last night it seemed that I dreamed about you
When I opened my mouth what came out was a song
And you knew every word and we all sang along

To a melody played on the strings of our souls
And a rhythm that rattled us down to the bone
Our love for eachother will live on forever
In every beat of my proud corazón
Our love for each other will live on forever
In every beat of my proud corazón

Ay mi familia, oiga mi gente (ay mi familia)
Canten al coro, let it be known
Our love for each other will live on forever
In every beat of my proud corazón
Ay mi familia, oiga mi gente (ay mi familia)
Canten al coro, let it be known (oiga mi gente)
Our love for each other will live on forever
In every beat of my proud corazón
