		  Dirty rotten Bizkit
Dirty ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-rotten Bizkit
Dirty ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-rotten Bizkit
(Oh, yeah)

I need a Bizkit, I need a Bizkit
I need a stinky dirty rotten Bizkit
Can you rip shit? Can you rip shit?
Can you rip like a dirty rotten Bizkit? Come on

I am your new crazy
Just look at what you made me

Somebody better give it to me
Hard, loud
Somebody better give it to me
Right now
Somebody better give it to me
Hard, loud
Somebody better give it to me
Right now
Somebody better give it to me (Oh, yeah)
Dirty rotten Bizkit

Fuck it, finally a fantasy
Check your head, this a guillotine canopy
Super fly (fly), throw me your vibes (vibes)
Down with the shit like a Romeo fly (woah)

I am your new crazy
Just look at what you made me

Somebody better give it to me
Hard, loud
Somebody better give it to me
Right now
Somebody better give it to me
Hard, loud
Somebody better give it to me
Right now
Somebody better give it to me

I need it
Yeah, I need it too
I need it
As much as you
And feel it
Just feel it
It's mutual
And I ain't no better than you

Dirty ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-rotten Bizkit
Dirty ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-rotten Bizkit

Hard, loud
Somebody better give it to me
Right now
Somebody better give it to me

(Give it to you? What the hell's that supposed to mean, daddy?)
