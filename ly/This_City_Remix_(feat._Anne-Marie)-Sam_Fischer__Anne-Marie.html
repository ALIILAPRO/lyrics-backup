		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been seein' lonely people in crowded rooms
Coverin' their old heartbreaks with new tattoos
It's all about smokescreens and cigarettes
Lookin' through low lights at silhouettes
But all I see is lonely people in crowded rooms

This city's gonna break my heart
This city's gonna love me, then leave me alone
This city's got me chasin' stars
It's been a couple months since I felt like I'm home
Am I gettin' closer to knowin' where I belong?
This city's gonna break my heart
She's always gonna break your heart, oh

Oh, no, no
Yeah
Monday through Friday I don't do so well
I wanna call you but I stop myself
And you're the only one I wanna run to, yeah
'Cause I've been drinkin' lately, so I forget
Wonderin' what this place will give me next
'Cause all I see are lonely people with broken hearts, yeah

Oh, this city's gonna break my heart
This city's gonna love me, then leave me alone
This city's got me chasin' stars
It's been a couple months since I felt like I'm home
Am I gettin' closer to knowin' where I belong?
This city's gonna break my heart
She's always gonna break your heart

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (ooh-hoo-hoo, ooh)
Oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (ooh-hoo-hoo, ooh)
Oh

She got a hold on me (I got a hold on you)
She got me wrapped 'round her finger (hm, yeah-yeah, yeah)
She got a hold on me (I got a hold on you)
She got me wrapped 'round her finger (yeah, yeah, oh yeah)

This city's gonna break my heart
This city's gonna love me, then leave me alone
This city's got me chasin' stars
It's been a couple months since I felt like I'm home
Am I gettin' closer to knowin' where I belong?
This city's gonna break my heart 
She's always gonna break your heart

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (ooh-hoo-hoo, ooh)
Yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (ooh-hoo-hoo, ooh)
Oh

This city's gonna break my heart, hey
She's always gonna break your heart
I didn't mean to break your heart
I didn't mean to break it
