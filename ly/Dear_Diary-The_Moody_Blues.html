		  Dear diary, what a day it's been
Dear diary, it's been just like a dream
Woke up too late.  Wasn't where I should have been
For goodness sake, what's happening to me? 
Write lightly, yours truly, dear diary

It was cold outside my door 
So many people by the score
Rushing around as senselessly 
They don't notice there's people like me 
Write lightly, yours truly, dear diary

They don't know what they're playing
They've got no way of knowing what the game is
Still they carry on doing what they can 
Outside me, yours truly, dear diary

It's over.  Will tomorrow be the same? 
I know that they're really not to blame 
If they weren't so blind, then surely they'd see 
There's a much better way for them to be 
Inside me, yours truly, dear diary

Somebody exploded an H-bomb today
But it wasn't anyone I knew
