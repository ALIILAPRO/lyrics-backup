		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you want to be with me
Stop messing with my mind
Don't waste my time
Don't waste my time

If you love me let me know
If you don't I'm out the door
Don't waste my time
Don't waste my time
I get tired of playing silly games
Going through silly things, hear me
Baby that's not my style
I want to be with you
So don't waste my time
Stop messing with my mind

If you want to be with me
Stop messing with my mind
Don't waste my time
Don't waste my time

Stop, look, and listen to the things you say
Sometimes you make no sense to me
If you love me say it
If you want me show it
'Cause if it ain't that way
I really don't need you no more
Baby make up your mind
Don't have me waste my time with you
Oh, don't mess with my mind

If you want to be with me
Stop messing with my mind
Don't waste my time
Don't waste my time
