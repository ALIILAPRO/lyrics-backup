		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yea I've iced down a few thousand beers in my day

You put down twice as many
No telling how many bonfires have lit up my face
If it ain't hundreds, it ain't any
I stood on this stage so many times
And watched all my friends
Have the time of your life
There's something in this Spring time air tonight
And we're gonna do it up right

Like we ain't ever
All been together
And try to make one night last forever
Once it's gone, you can't get it back
So lift 'em up, y'all, where you at
Let's fill up on this feel good rock we don't know, know better
Like we ain't ever

This ain't the first time we've partied under the stars
Making a hang over
Well, this time I got a few more songs in this old guitar
For you to pull your baby closer
You pull your baby closer

Like we ain't ever
All been together
Let's try to make one night last forever
Once it's gone, you can't get it back
So left 'em up, y'all, where you at
Let's fill up on this feel good rock we don't know, know better
Like we ain't ever

Yeah, there's something in this Spring time air tonight
And we're gonna do it up right
Let's do it up right

Like we ain't ever
All been together
Let's try to make one night last forever
Once it's gone, you can't get it back
So lift 'em up, y'all, where you at
Let's fill up on this feel good rock we don't know, know better
Like we ain't ever

Like we ain't ever

Like we ain't ever
