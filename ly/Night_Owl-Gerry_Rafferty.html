		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Night comes down and finds you alone
In a space and time of your own
Lost in dreams in a world full of shadows

Down the street the neon light shines
Offering refuge and hope to the blind
Who stumble in with no thought of tomorrow

Yes I get lonely when the sun gets low
And I end up looking for somewhere to go
Yes I should know better but I cant say no
Oh no no no no no no no

The light are low when the music is loud
You watch yourself as you play to the crowd
One more face in a palace of mirrors

One more drink your sailing away
One more dream but its looking okay
One more time to watch the flow of the river

Yes I get lonely when the sun gets low
And I end up looking for somewhere to go
Yes I should know better but I cant say no
Oh no no no no no no no no no no

Yes I get lonely when the sun gets low
And I end up looking for somewhere to go
Yes I should know better but I cant say no
Oh no no
Oh no no no
No no no no no no no no no no
