		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Breaking ice that hardly shatters
Embrace the night of shallow chatter
Fake delight is all I'm after

I wouldn't weigh it on you 
I wouldn't weigh it on you
I wanna get a whole view
I wouldn't weigh it on you

You take the time
to say I need
to take my world 
and spin it on my
finger in accordance 
to what’s right behind your eyes
Don’t you get?
The weight on you

I wouldn't weigh it on you 
I wouldn't weigh it on you
You can’t dissect your own views
I wouldn't weigh it on you

I wouldn't weigh it on you 
I wouldn't weigh it on you
You wouldn't even come thru
I wouldn't weigh it on you

Don’t you get
what weighs on you? 


I wouldn't weigh it on you 
I wouldn't weigh it on
You can’t dissect your own views
I wouldn't weigh it on you

I wouldn't weigh it on you 
I wouldn't weigh it on you
You wouldn't even come thru
I wouldn't weigh it on you
