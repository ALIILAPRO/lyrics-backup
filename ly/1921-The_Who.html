		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got a feeling '21
Is going to be a good year
Especially if you and me
See it in together

So you think '21
Is going to be a good year
It could be good for me and her
But you and her, no never!
I had no reason to be over optimistic
But somehow when you smiled
I could brave bad weather

What about the boy?
What about the boy?
What about the boy?
He saw it all!

You didn't hear it
You didn't see it
You won't say nothing to no-one
Never in your life
You never heard it
Oh, how absurd it all seems
Without any proof
You didn't hear it
You didn't see it
You never heard it, not a word of it
You won't say nothing to no-one
Never tell a soul
What you know is the Truth

Got a feeling '21
Is going to be a good year
Especially if you and me
See it in together

Got a feeling '21
Is going to be a good year
Especially if you and me
See it in together

I had no reason to be over optimistic
But somehow when you smiled
I could brave bad weather
