		  Where's my coffee?
Good morning Dr Carter (hey sweetie)
Looks like it's going to be a long day 
(Ah, another one, huh? What we got?)
Your first patient (yeah)
Is suffering from a lack of concepts (uh-huh)
Originality (ugh)
His flow is weak (another one)
And he has no style (ugh)
What'cha got for um?

Ok, let me put my gloves on and my scrubs on
Doctor carter to the rescue 
Excuse me if I'm late
But like a thief it takes time to be this great
Ha, so just wait, your style is a disgrace
Your rhymes are fifth place and I'm just grace
One, uno, ace 
And I'm tryin' to make our heart beat like bass
But your sweet like cake and I come to fix
Whatever you shall break 
Where is your originality?
You are so fake, so picture me like a gallery
Capture what I say 
All I need is one mic 
All I need is one take
Like, hey, brighter then the sun ray
Got a pistols on the playground
Watch the gun-play like
No kidding, no kids in the way
But the kids do watch
Gotta watch what we say 
Gotta work everyday
Gotta not be cliche
Gotta stand out like Andre 3K
Gotta kick it kick it like the sensei
You gotta have faith, you gotta, gotta, wait, wait
I think I, I think I lost 'em (dial one eighteen please)

Good afternoon Dr Carter
(Nurse)
I don't know about this one 
His confidence is down 
Vocab and metaphors needs work 
And he lost respect for the game
(Ah, let me see)
Think you can save him?

Ok
Respect is in the heart
So that's where I'm a start
And a lot of heart patients don't make it
Now, hey kid
Plural, I graduated
'Cause you could get through anything if magic made it
And that was called recycling
Or re-reciting
Something 'cause you just like it
So you say it just like it
Some say its biting
But I say its enlightening
Besides, Dr Kanye West is one of the brightest
And Dr Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest
And Dr Jeezy can fix your back up the nicest
Arthritis in my hand from writing
But I'm a doctor, they don't understand my writing
So I stop writing
Now I'm like lighting
And you ain't Vince Young so don't clash with the titans
Fast and exciting
My passion is frighting
Now let me put some more vocab in your iv
Here take this Vicodin
Like it and love it
And confidence has no budget 
So pay me no mind 
I don't walk like I talk it 'cause I'm running 
I don't do it 'cause I done it and 
I'm in the emergency unit
God damn it, I've lost another one

Good evening Dr Carter, it's been a long day 
But this one looks much better then the others 
His respect is back up 
Concepts sound good
His style is showing strong signs of improvement 
All he needs now is some swagger
Ok, let me take my gloves off then

Swagger tighter then a yeast infection
Fly go hard like geese erection
Fashion patrol police detection
I stay tight like Chinese connection
I stay tight like pussy at night
Baby don't get me wrong, I could do that pussy right
But I'm too wrong to write
Too fresh to fight
Too paid to freestyle
Too paid to freestyle
I had to say it twice
Swagger so nice
And don't ask me shit unless it concern a price
And I don't rap fast I rap slow
'Cause I mean every letter in the words
In the sentence of my quotes
Swagger just flow sweeter then honey oats
That swagger I got it I wear it like a coat
Wait, as I put the light down his throat
I can only see flow
His blood starting to flow
His lungs starting to grow
This one starting to show
Strong signs of life
Where's the stitches? Here's the knife
Smack his face, his eyes open, I reply, "what a night"
Welcome back hip hop I saved your life

He, he looks good
His, his vitals are up
He's looking good
He's looking good
I think we got one
Dr Carter, I think we got one
Yup, yup we got one
We saved him 
He's good
He's good
We got one
He's good
He's good 
We got 'em, we saved him
He's a go, he's good
