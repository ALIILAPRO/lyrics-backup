		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When his mind
Is at sixes and sevens
And the man yells "Great Heavens"
That's when a tí know
And the Rosemary scent
On a bed full of roses
And he still doesn't notice
That's when a tí know
(You know what?)
My fingers intertwined with his
His eyes do tell me everything
My lips are begging for  tu kiss
Like a whisper
Like the water
And poetry looks like my face
You know it's such a simple thing
You make me feel alive again
Nothing matters
We are lovers
When the flesh
Is no longer a painting
And his patience is draining
That's when a tí know
And the lavender smell
On a glass full of wine
He now hides from the sun
That's when a tí know
You've done  right
My fingers intertwined with his
His eyes do tell me everything
My lips are begging for  tu kiss
Like a whisper
Like the water
And poetry looks like my face
You know it's such a simple thing
You make me feel alive again
Nothing matters
We are lovers
And I know
No un is escaping
Fragile John Doe!
(Give me what you've got!)
My fingers intertwined with his
(Give me what you've got!)
His eyes do tell me everything
(Give me what you've got!)
My lips are begging for  tu kiss
Like a whisper
Like the water
And poetry looks like my face
(Give me what you've got!)
You know it's such a simple thing
(Give me what you've got!)
You make me feel alive again
Nothing matters
We are lovers
