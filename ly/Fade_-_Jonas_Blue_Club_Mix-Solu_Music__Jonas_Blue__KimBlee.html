		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look at me, stare inside
Take my place, in my mind
Capture me, follow through
Validate, wanting you

Baby this seems so wrong
Baby this seems so right

Hour after hour, so long
Day after day, so long
Year, after year, after year
And now we're here

Never fade from my mind 
Shower me and give me life
Never fade from my mind
Always there when I close my eyes

Hesitate pull me in
Breath on breath, skin on skin
Lovin' deep, fallin fast
All right here, yeah, let this last

Baby it's been so long 
And it could be tonight

Hour after hour, so long 
Day after day, so long
Year after year after year
And now we're here

Never fade from my mind 
Shower me and give me life
Never fade from my mind 
Always there when I close my eyes

(Give me life) 
(Give me life)
And now we're here

Never fade from my mind 
Shower me and give me life (give me love and give me life, yeah) 
Never fade from my mind
Always there when I close my eyes (give me love and give me life)
