		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I searched the world
Around for you
In every corner
I see two
Ovations ought to
Be for me
What makes anybody
Want to be

I'm sure you're lookin'
Sure got your hooks in
It's freezing, I'm so cold (you damn right)

Minus me, minus you
I think it's all because of
I think it's all because of you! 
I think it's all because of you!

I care about, now what's his name?
Moral speakin'
Nor did I choose fame
What in the world
Took you so long?
The time is dripping,
All fluids getting strong

I'm sure you're lookin'
Sure got your hooks in
It's freezing, I'm so cold (you damn right)

Minus me, minus you
I think it's all because of
I think it's all because of you!
I think it's all because of you!
