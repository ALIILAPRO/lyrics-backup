		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl, I can't understand it, why you want to hurt me
After all the things I've done for you
I buy you champagne and roses, put diamonds on your finger
Diamonds on your finger
Still you hang out all night
What am I to do?

My girl wants to party all the time
Party all the time
Party all the time
My girl wants to party all the time
Party all the time

She parties all the time, ooh hoo

Party all the time
She likes to party all the time, party all the time, ooh hoo
Party all the time, she likes to party all the time
Party all the time

Girl, I've seen you in clubs just hanging out and dancing
You give your number to every man you see
You never come home at night because you're out romancing
I wish you'd bring some of your love home to me

But my girl wants to party all the time
Party all the time
Party all the time
My girl wants to party all the time
Party all the time

My girl wants to party all the time
Party all the time
Party all the time
My girl wants to party all the time
Party all the time, yeah

(Party, party, party) she likes to party all the time
Ooh ooh, hoo hoo hoo

She likes to party all the time
She lets her hair down
She likes to party down
She likes to party
She likes to party down (ooh ooh, hoo hoo hoo)

Party all the time, oh, now get down and party, yeah
