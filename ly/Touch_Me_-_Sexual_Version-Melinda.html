		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No longer will I do all the things
That I used to do, yeah
Well, I'm a big girl now, hmmm
With belief and desire

Come on and touch me, touch me, touch
Come on and touch me, come on, and come on
Come on and touch me, touch me, touch
Come on and touch me yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)

People can't understand it, oh yeah-eah
People can't understand it, oh, oh, oh
People can't understand it, oh yeah-eah
People, people can't understand it, oh, oh, oh

I think it's high time, yes, time
My soul gets burned, uh-huh
Just give me one look, hey, (oh yeah)
Just give me, (oh yeah), give me

Come on and touch me, touch me, touch
Come on and touch me, come on, and come on
Come on and touch me, touch me, touch
Come on and touch me yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)

People can't understand it, oh yeah
People can't understand it, oh, oh, oh
People can't understand it, oh yeah
People, people can't understand it, oh, oh, oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

Come on and touch me, come on, and come on
Come on and touch me, touch me, touch
Come on and touch me yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)

People can't understand it, oh yeah
People can't understand it, oh, oh, oh
People can't understand it, oh yeah
