		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  His name was King
He had a horse
Along the countryside
I saw him ride

He had a gun
I knew him well
Oh, I heard him singing
I knew he loved someone

His name was King (his name was King)
He had a brother (he had a brother)
His only brother
A peaceful guy

One day they found him
His shirt was red
Two shiny bullets
They found his brother dead

You can't see King
Whoa, he's riding
You can't see King
That man is searching

Got to fight his anger
Find in his eyes
Sure to find that killer
Looking for the man

His name was King (his name was King)
He had a brother (he had a brother)
His only brother
A peaceful guy

One day they found him
His shirt was red
Two shiny bullets
They found his brother dead

You can't see King
Whoa, he's riding
You can't see King
That man is searching

Got to fight his anger
Find in his eyes
Sure to find that killer
Looking for the man

His name was King (his name was King)
He had a horse (he had a brother)
Along the countryside
I saw him ride
He had a gun
Oh, I knew him well
And when he shot
Oh that man, he never missed

Ride on King, ride
You get your man
