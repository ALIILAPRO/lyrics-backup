		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Suddenly something has happened to me
As I was having my cup of tea
Suddenly I was feeling depressed
I was utterly and totally stressed
Do you know you made me cry? Whoa oh oh 
Do you know you made me die?

And the thing that gets to me
Is you'll never really see
And the thing that freaks me out
Is I'll always be in doubt

It is a lovely thing that we have
It is a lovely thing that we
It is a lovely thing, the animal
The animal instinct

Woo hoo hoo
Woo hoo hoo
Woo hoo hoo ooh

So take my hands and come with me
We will change reality
So take my hands and we will pray
They won't take you away
They will never make me cry, no oh whoa
They will never make me die

And the thing that gets to me
Is you'll never really see
And the thing that freaks me out
Is I'll always be in doubt

The animal, the animal, the animal instinct in me
It's the animal, the animal, the animal instinct in me
It's the animal, it's the animal
It's the animal instinct in me

It's the animal, it's the animal, it's the animal instinct in me
The animal, the animal
The animal instinct in me

It's the animal, it's the animal, it's the animal instinct in me
