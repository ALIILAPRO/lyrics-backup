		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something 'bout the way you talk to me
It feels so right and when we fight
We make up easily 
Something 'bout the way you look at me
'Cause in my mind when we're high
I'm still falling 
But I don't know exactly where we are 
I just know we're more than friends
It's never easy to pretend 

But can we talk about love
And why it comes and goes
If we never try, we'll never know
But can we talk about trust
And why it never lies
Can we talk about why we've never tried?
Can we talk about love, love, love, love, love?

Can't lie, feel like it's the right time 
Nothing wrong with being shy
I can make you smile
I feel like I'm the right guy
Now I never wanna leave 
Fell in love in southeast 
But we're both on our way
To a brighter place 
But I don't know exactly where we are 
I just know we're more than friends
It's never easy to pretend 

But can we talk about love
And why it comes and goes
If we never try, we'll never know
But can we talk about trust
And why it never lies
Can we talk about why we've never tried?
Can we talk about love, love, love, love, love?
