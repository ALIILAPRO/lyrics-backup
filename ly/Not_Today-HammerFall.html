		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What am I?
A torch without a fire
Lost with no tale to tell
Like tears on the pyre

Give me strength to fight
And keep the fire burning
Please show me how to stall the final curtain

Who am I?
A man without a vision
I know I blazed my trail
Based on my decisions

East nor west
True north my perfect landing
My soul is winter bound
My heart is pending

Now she speaks to me
A whisper in the wind
Are you here to take me home?

Not today
Autumn leaves are gently falling
Come tomorrow
Let me live another day
Not today
It's a time for recalling
And talk tomorrow if it comes

Winter speaks of endless shades of grey
Sky is dark, as dark can be this day
Seasons change, no autumn leaves remain
Winter's tune some sort of croon, the final one
My final one

Now she speaks again
A howling in the wind
I am here to take you home

Not today
Autumn leaves are gently falling
Come tomorrow
Let me live another day
Not today
It's a time for recalling
And talk tomorrow if it comes
