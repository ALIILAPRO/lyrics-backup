		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Keep falling back to me
And tell me what you see
While my hands on your body
Feel the eyes they all on me
Temptations
Temptations
Temptations
Baby I need saving
Temptations
Temptations
Temptations
I don't wanna cave in
Intoxicated contemplating who you waiting for
Feelings fading what you saving leave it on the floor
I pulled up and made a promise that I can't ignore
But In my head I'm always wanting more
Noo
I wanna tell the truth
I'm showing up with you
And I love the way you
Noo
If the pressure make me move
And there's nothing I can do
Then I'm coming back for you
Temptations
Temptations
Temptations
Baby I need saving
Temptations
Temptations
Temptations
I don't wanna cave in
I stay home avoiding all of these problems
But I can't run away soon as we start sipping that bottle
Devil on my shoulder which way am I gon follow
Told you that I changed and we gon find out by tomorrow
So we should live tonight
Get caught up in the vibe
No need to check the time
Leave the bullshit on the side
And I ain't gonna lie
We moving out of spite
Temptation on my mind
But I want you in my life
Temptations
Temptations
Temptations
Baby I need saving
Temptations
Temptations
Temptations
I don't wanna cave in
