		  Buckle up, phew, ha, phew, ha
Buckle up
Ayo-ayo, ayo-ayo (that's Abnormal)
Phew, phew, sit the fuck back
Phew, ha-ha
Phew, sit the fuck back, phew

That Durango talk like-
When it come down the street, buckle up when you sit in your seat
Turn your lights on make sure that you can see
It's a red light, so we jump out the V
Calm down, we to in it
Can't see in this shit 'cause it's too tinted
Wanna know who in the back, got the crew in it
Swear to God that I'm buckled all up
We don't stop at red lights 'cause we don't give a fuck
He in the street 'cause I'm in something small right now
Boy, don't make me bring out the truck (oh, watch)

On the highway, breaking the rules
They in the back screaming, "Stop, can you cruise?"
I can not stop 'cause I see red and blue
Dyce in the back, he said he see it too (mm)
He said, "Spence, you already know what to do, they might catch you this time"
I'm like, "Boy, catching who?"
Put that shit right in sport and I swear that we flew
Goddamn, we gon' need some more gas in a few
It's a station right here
He said, "How many minutes is it?"
I said, "It's coming up, it's like two"
Aw, man, the gas on E
I'ma pull up to the side real quick, tryna see what them boys want
Alright, we gon' see
He get to the car, he like, "License and registration"
Aw, shit, I don't got it on me
He like, "Sir, can I see your ID?"
He like, "Go 'head and step out for me"
I laughed, put a muscle up, skrrt off, then I said, "Officer, you better"

Phew, ha, buckle up
Phew, ha
Phew, ha, buckle up (his dumb-ass sped off)
Phew, ha-ha, phew (you really wan' stop? Come on now we got)
Sit the fuck back, phew

That Durango talk like-
When it come down the street, buckle up when you sit in your seat
Turn your lights on make sure that you can see
It's a red light, so we jump out the V (buckle up, phew)
