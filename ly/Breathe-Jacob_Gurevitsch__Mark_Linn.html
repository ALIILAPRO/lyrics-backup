		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Breathe - Breathe and be
Dream of easier times
Days of the carefree

Will or won't you know
There are many miles to go
Only time will show
Just what ends the road

Streets - quiet and bare
Ill-prepared for the tide
That came out of nowhere

Lonely days are long
And we've only just begun
Calm we carry on
We're apart and one

Waiting out the storm

Bleak - scenes unique
Gradually - in the fade
Seeing what can't be

Keep at any cost
All that can't be lost
Sing of faith - you must
Sing of seeds - and dust

Reach - past fatigue
Fears recede given time
Slowly but surely

Safer on your own?
You may never brake a bone
Yet you'd rather leave unknown
What you learn alone

Waiting out the storm
