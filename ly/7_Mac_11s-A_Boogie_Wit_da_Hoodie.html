		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Almighty God)
This young nigga with me
Really shoot like Trae

I'm pullin' up with seven MAC-11s
Hop out the double-R, Louis V steppin'
Put a beam on every single weapon
Send me the addy and I'ma address it
I wanna start rippin' through your leggings
You're better than Margiela and Giuseppe
Want you to stop playing, you can get it
Just send me the addy and I'ma address it, yeah

All I know is get the bag, facts
I get money out the ass, facts
You should see what's in my stash, racks
You don't want it to get bad, oh man
Really shootin' like The Mask, facts
Runnin' through bodies like Mad Max
Hoodie on, grippied up, mask black
I keep it on me, get your ass back
The niggas I roll with is not nice
Hit a nigga in front of his mom, I swear
Forty two niggas gon' knock him down
We can get the one, I don't know if he my height
Yeah, half of these niggas cannot fight
They used to call us dirty Bronx guys
Now niggas' bitches send me heart eyes
Niggas' bitches be sendin' me heart eyes
I got a bankroll in every whip
Hop out the double-R, Louis V steppin'
Put a beam on every single weapon
Designer clothes, I get it for free
They wonder why I never go to sleep
It's niggas tryna take me out my misery
But I can never let them get me off my feet
I put a Hellcat engine in the Jeep
It's not a G-Wagen, yeah
And I ain't really with the back-and-forth shit
Just let me know if it's static, yeah
Hangin' 'round nothin' but bosses, no losses, only W's, yeah
My nigga don't even make songs and he got more hits than a baddie, yeah
Turn my bitch into a brat, she got more double C than a Sabathia, yeah
Had a nine-car garage at the crib, crib so big, I call it a lair
I know you just wanna show off in my car, makin' videos flippin' your hair
Girl, you gon' fall out of line fuckin' with the stars, baby, you is not ordinar'
Niggas gon' fall out of line fuckin' with some thugs, nigga, get you right out of here
Got a FN, it came with a scope and a beam, I'm ready, yeah
(Almighty God)

I'm pullin' up with seven MAC-11s
Hop out the double-R, Louis V steppin'
Put a beam on every single weapon
Send me the addy and I'ma address it
I wanna start rippin' through your leggings
You're better than Margiela and Giuseppe
Want you to stop playing, you can get it
Just send me the addy and I'ma address it
I'm pullin' up with seven MAC-11s
Hop out the double-R, Louis V steppin'
Put a beam on every single weapon
Send me the addy and I'ma address it
I wanna start rippin' through your leggings
You're better than Margiela and Giuseppe
Want you to stop playing, you can get it
Just send me the addy and I'ma address it, yeah
