		<p>
		  You got me like, oh, oh oh oh
Yeah, You make me feel so alive
You got me like, oh, oh oh oh
And I'll never stop giving my all
Just thinking how blessed I am
This is the best time
To show the world I'm crazy about You
You got me like, oh, oh oh oh
Yeah, You make me feel so alive
Alive, alive, alive, alive-ive-ive
I'ma praise like

Right about now is a good time
To stop and have a good time
I'ma be up here having some God time
And you're good on the genuine, like
Illumination, illumination
You light up my life like You lit up creation
Won't let me drown, You my floatation
Won't let me thirst
'cause You my hydration
So I'ma do my dance in Your arms
This love is gonna last in Your arms
You're everything to me, everything I need
Everything I wanna be, JC

You got me like, oh, oh oh oh
And I'll never stop giving my all
You got me like, oh, oh oh oh
Yeah, You make me feel so alive
Alive, alive, alive, alive-ive-ive
I'ma praise like

Never gonna need another reason
Who You are is reason enough
You're God of all eternity and Heaven above
Your joy is strong, Your love goes on
And on, and on, and on, and on
So I'ma come in Your- gates, thanks
Courts, praise
I don't ever wanna be any other place
In Your vicinity's where I will stay
You're good when it's frosty and
Good in the blaze
You good in the darkness and good in the day
You're good all the time
What else can I say?
You're worthy of even the highest of praise
So every day, ayy
