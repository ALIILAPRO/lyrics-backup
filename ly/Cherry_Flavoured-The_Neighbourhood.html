		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sweet and sour motivation
Wish I could keep concentration

I've been gettin' high
It's keeping me low now
I'm doin' it alone now
I think I gotta slow down
And I know I
I gotta take control now
But I sold my soul a long time ago
I feel like a ghost now

Cherry flavored conversations with you
Got me hanging on
Down to Earth from all the waiting
Take me somewhere beyond

I've been gettin' high
But I don't ever stay up, no no
I feel like I'm fading, yeah
Give me stimulation now
Get me to the next level
Come on, give me levitation, God
Slow dancin' with the devil
Sent my soul on a little vacation

I've been gettin' high
It's keeping me low now
I'm doin' it alone now
I think I gotta slow down
I know I
I gotta take control now
But I sold my soul a long time ago
I feel like a ghost now

Cherry flavored conversations

Lover boy
Body toy
Cold, cold, body toy
Cold, cold, I tried to drown
All the pills, I wish they'd
Lover boy
Cold
