		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me how much hurt can a heart take?
Tell me how much wind till the walls cave?
You can just stay right there in the pain
Or listen to the voice that you hear when you pray
Tell me, how much hurt can a heart take before it breaks?

When the storm rolls in and the sky won't quit crying
And you've lost more tears than you thought you could ever lose
Oh, I swear somewhere out there
The sun is somewhere shining
So drive, baby, drive, baby, drive till it shines on you
And leave the rain in the rearview

I got ten and two on a two tone, two lanes of freedom
Singing Jesus Take the Wheel, now I know what she was feelin
Oh, 'cause I feel it too

When the storm rolls in and the sky won't quit crying
And you've lost more tears than you thought you could ever lose
Oh, I swear somewhere out there
The sun is somewhere shining
So drive, baby, drive, baby, drive till it shines on you
And leave the rain in the rearview
Leave the rain in the rearview

Leave the rain, leave the rain in the rearview
Leave the rain, leave the rain in the rearview
Don't stop till your eyes see the clear blue
Drive, baby, drive (just drive)

Leave the rain, leave the rain in the rearview
Leave the rain, leave the rain in the rearview (oh, in the rearview)
Don't stop till your eyes see the clear blue
Drive, baby, drive

When the storm rolls in and the sky won't quit crying
And you've lost more tears than you thought you could ever lose
Oh, I swear somewhere out there
The sun is somewhere shining
So drive, baby, drive, baby, drive till it shines on you
And leave the rain in the rearview
And leave the rain in the rearview
