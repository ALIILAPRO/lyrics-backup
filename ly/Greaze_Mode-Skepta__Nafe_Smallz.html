		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'ma break the law (Yeah)
Then I'ma break the bank (Yeah)
I'ma put some in the safe
Then I'ma throw some on the floor (Yeah)
Definitely make some more (Trust)
Twenty dates (Yeah)
Had to go back on tour (Yeah)
She can see how I'm flexing (Yeah)
Count my blessings, praise the Lord (Yeah)
You know the steeze, super greaze (Greaze)
Nothing nice, tell the promoter bring the P's (Yeah)
Still ain't safe, I'm in the party wit' my G's (Yeah)
And I just made your girl (Yeah), my girl, she's on her knees (Yeah)

(Bruh)
On her knees (Yeah)
She see the D, she see the freeze (Freeze)
Rollin' trees from overseas
Smoke for free, nigga please (Woo)

'Lowe me
Big gelato, V.I.P. is looking cloudy (Yeah)
This cali got me feeling drowsy
Never stressing 'cause them killers they be round me
It's best you leave me where you found me
'Cause we ain't with the disrespect, nah
Fuck your vest, we be aiming at your neck
You know the vibe, yeah, the level set (Yeah)
Mind how you step, best step correct (Woo)
I got your girl addicted to the sex

On her knees (Yeah)
She see the D, she see the freeze (Freeze)
Rollin' trees from overseas
Smoke for free, nigga please

Yeah
I'm an asthmatic, weed fanatic
When I get high I leave the planet
Tryna kick the habit but every day it's on my mind (Yeah)
She said that I smoke too much
But see I work hard and pay for mine
Definite a hustle, blud, definitely I grind (Yeah)
Since a yute, man, I always had something shottin' out the boot
Since a yute, I been a target, I cannot go around the truth
Niggas hate, soon as they see me they don't know what the fuck to do
Watchin' me, I'm not watchin' you
I was just blazin' on my zoot
It's Big Smoke
How can she tell me that I'm cute? (Yeah)
I'm so high, I'm so fly (Yeah)
I'm gonna need a parachute (Yeah)
River's Dad, super swag (Yeah)
I'm gonna need a camera crew (Yeah)
I'm gonna need some palm wine (Yeah)
I'm gonna need some pepper soup (Yeah)
And if I ain't the headline, then I must be the special guest (Yeah)
I pull up and steal the show, and I weren't even tryna flex (Yeah)
Had to touch the after party, she just sent me the address (Yeah)
Said that she wanted me to come and I told her "say it with your chest" (Yeah)

I got your girl addicted to the sex
On her knees (Yeah)
She see the D, she see the freeze (Freeze)
Rollin' trees from overseas
Smoke for free, nigga please
