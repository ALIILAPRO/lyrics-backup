		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now I'm back on the street again
It never rains unless it pours
Try to get back on my feet again
I hear the raging thunder as it roars

Tonight, tonight is it just a rhapsody
Or am I right
Tonight, tonight is it all a mystery
I just can't fight no more

I hear the questions surface in my mind
Of my mistakes that I have made
Times and places I have left behind
And am I ever going to make the grade

Tonight, tonight is it just a rhapsody
Or am I right
Tonight, tonight is it all a mystery
I just can't fight no more

As I beat my head against the wall
Running 'round in circles in vain
I'm feeling three feet tall
You don't understand I'm fading away, yeah

Don't want your pity or your sympathy
It isn't gonna prove a thing to me
Good intentions pave the way to hell
Don't you worry when you hear me sing

Tonight, tonight is it just a rhapsody
Or am I right
Tonight, tonight is it all a mystery
I just can't fight no more
