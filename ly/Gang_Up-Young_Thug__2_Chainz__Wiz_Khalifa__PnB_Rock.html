		<p>
		  Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah (yeah)

I'm with the gang, gang, gang
And we 'bout to go up (yeah)
Switchin' lanes, it's a thang
Every time we show up (skrrt-skrrt)
You a lame, lame, lame
And you so below us (yeah)
Bet your ho, she know us (yeah)
'Cause you know we glowed up
We stayed down (stayed down)
And came up (came up)
And came up (came up)
We stayed down (stayed down) (yeah)
And came up (came up)
The gang up (the gang up) (2 Chainz, yeah)

Yeah
I'm a villain that's winnin' (yeah)
With precision, I'm killin' (yeah)
Represent the religion (no)
Ended up independent
Took my car to the clinic
Let 'em check all the vitals
Middle finger to rivals (oh)
Michael Jackson, my idol (woo)
Still duckin' the pie holes
Talk to the plug everyday except Cinco de Mayo (true)
I still got me a Carlo 
Still got Monte Carlo 
Your car runnin' so bad, it stink up The Apollo 

Call my Rollie a Ralo (uh)
Call my AP a "A"P (AP)
I ain't talkin' seat belts when I say that I'm strapped (baow)
I'm in love with my side, ho
I'll sneak her through the side door
I'ma show you what we ride for
I'ma show you what we die for

I'm with the gang, gang, gang (yeah)
And we 'bout to go up (yeah, yeah)
Switchin' lanes, it's a thang
Every time we show up (I'm ridin') (skrrt-skrrt)
You a lame, lame, lame
And you so below us (2 Chainz) (yeah)
Bet your ho, she know us (yeah)
'Cause you know we glowed up (yeah)
We stayed down (stayed down) ((stayed down)
And came up (came up)
And came up (came up) (uh)
We stayed down (stayed down) (stayed down)
And came up (came up) (uh)
The gang up (the gang up, yeah) (uh)

I'm in my same lane, lane and I ain't gon' ever change up (lane, lane)
I blowed a brain out the Range like a Taz Angel (yeah, yeah)
It's RIP to Paul Walker, homie got his stain up (RIP to Paul)
We had your main on us, now we got stains on us (straight up)
And all we gotta do is stay down and come up while they flexin' (all you gotta do)
Yeah, I got her Indian, she Western (yeah, she Western) 
Yeah, I just had sex with one of your best friends (damn)
Then that Fast and Furious started nestin' (sheesh)

Say I'm 'bout to go take off on you (take off on you)
Is you stayin', is you rollin' like a scroller? (Yes, you are)
You're ready to take off like a 1980 Coke? Yes (yuh)
You ain't on that Instagram shit, are you gon' post that? (Yuh)

I'm with the gang, gang, gang (yeah)
And we 'bout to go up (yeah)
Switchin' lanes, it's a thang
Every time we show up (Young Khalifa man) (skrrt) 
You a lame, lame, lame
And you so below us (yeah)
Bet your ho, she know us (yeah)
'Cause you know we glowed up (that's exactly what we gonna do)
We stayed down (stayed down) (forever)
And came up (came up)
And came up (came up) (come see me)
We stayed down (stayed down, I got exactly what you need)
And came up (came up) (uh)
The gang up (the gang up, yeah)

Yeah, I'm always with my gang
We always ready to ride 'cause for the squad, we'll do anything
Stay down, we'll never change
We always gon' stay the same
Put you in check, when you outta place
I try to tell 'em not to mess with my gang, gang, gang
We do what we gotta do and don't complain-plain-plain
I'm on the road, I'm probably fresh up off the plane, plane, plane
Know you heard about me, I do my thang, thang, thang

I got the world on my back (back)
I put your girl on her back (back)
I did it all on my own (own)
Now there ain't no turnin' back (back)
And my whole squad got my back (back)
And shawty so bad, I asked her if she repped the gang
She said, "Facts" (facts)
Gang, gang, gang

Gang, gang, gang
And we 'bout to go up (yeah)
Switchin' lanes, it's a thang
Every time we show up (skrrt-skrrt)
You a lame, lame, lame
And you so below us (yeah)
Bet your ho, she know us (yeah)
'Cause you know we glowed up
We stayed down (stayed down)
And came up (came up)
And came up (came up)
We stayed down (stayed down)
And came up (came up)
The gang up (the gang up, yeah)
