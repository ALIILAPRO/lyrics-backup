		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In Heaven's name why are you walking away?
Hang on to your love
In Heaven's name why do you play these games?
Hang on to your love

Take time if you're down on luck
It's so easy to walk out on love
Take your time if the going gets tough
It's so precious

So if you want it to get stronger you'd better not let go
You've got to hold on longer if you want your love to grow
Got to stick together, hand in glove
Hold on tight, don't fight
Hang on to your love

In Heaven's name why are you walking away?
Hang on to your love
In Heaven's name why do you play these games?
Hang on to your love

Be brave when the journey is rough
It's not easy when you're in love
Don't be ashamed when the going gets tough
It's not easy
Don't give up

If want it to get stronger you'd better not let go
You got to hold on longer if you want your love to grow
Got to stick together, hand in glove
Hold on tight, don't fight
Hang on to your love

In Heaven's name why are you walking away?
Hang on to your love
In Heaven's name why do you play these games?
Hang on to your love

So if want it to get stronger you'd better not let go
You got to hold on longer if you want your love to grow
Got to stick together, hand in glove
Hold on tight, don't fight
Hang on to your love

In Heaven's name why are you walking away?
Hang on to your love
In Heaven's name why do you play these games?
Hang on to your love

When you find a love (hang on to your love)
Don't let it walk away (hang on)
When you find your love (hang on to your love)
You got to make it stay (hang on)

(Hang on to your love)
Don't let it walk away (hang on)
When you find your love (hang on to your love)
You got to make it stay (hang on)

You've got to hang on to your love (to your love)
You've got to hang on to your love (to your love)
(Hang on) Why are you walking away? 
(Hang on) Why do you play these games? 

(Hang on to your love) Da-da-da-da-da-dee-dee-da-da
(Hang on to your love) Da-da-da-da-da-dee-dee-da-da
(Hang on to your love) Dee-Dee-daa
