		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sunday morning
Brings the dawn in
It's just a restless feeling
By my side

Early dawning
Sunday morning
It's just the wasted years
So close behind

Watch out, the world's behind you
There's always someone around you
Who will call
It's nothing at all

Sunday morning
And I'm falling
I've got a feeling
I don't want to know

Early dawning
Sunday morning
It's all the streets you've crossed
Not so long ago

Watch out, the world's behind you
There's always someone around you
Who will call
It's nothing at all

Watch out, the world's behind you
There's always someone around you
Who will call
It's nothing at all

Sunday morning
Sunday morning
Sunday morning
Sunday morning
