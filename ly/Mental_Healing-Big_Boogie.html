		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tired of this
Mmm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm (EJ Beats)
Ayy, yeah, oh-oh-oh
(D. Major, baby)

All that fake love, I ain't with it
Don't lead a nigga on, if you really don't feel it
Tired of these fake ass niggas 
Wanna shake a nigga hand if it's up, then nigga we can get it
Tired of this fake ass love I be gettin'
Tired of these hatin' ass clubs I be hittin'
They don't wanna give a nigga credit I've been given
I be cryin' to myself, they don't know what I be feelin'
When I fall back, they gon' think a nigga flippin'
When a nigga mad, they gon' think a nigga trippin'
I don't mean no harm, I just gotta keep my distance
I'll vent to my daughter, she the only one that listen (Raya)
I don't trust niggas, they'll kill you on a mission
Yeah, I talk to God, wonder do he think I'm trippin'?
Everybody changed, I ain't hugged in a minute
Brothers locked up, they ain't thugged in a minute
Insides black, I ain't loved in a minute
Brother died on a nigga, smokin' 'Wood like a chimney
Pain in my eyes, nigga seein' bloody vision
I don't vent to niggas, they be too gangsta to listen
Proud of myself, I be on the television
Redrum for life so I'm stuck with that decision (brrt)
Free LD, that nigga fightin' in that prison
The words out his mouth, he gon' die in that prison (free LD)
Yeah life real, at night times, I cry
I'm lookin' at my nigga like, "Why we gotta die?"
Ain't it fucked up, we gotta live just to die?
"Life goes on," man, that bullshit a lie
But it is what it is, 'cause I'm thuggin' 'til I die
"Redrum broke in the bay", that's a lie
They gonna rob who? Slide work, they can try
Chopper gon' feed a nigga leg and a thigh
Damn, I done made it out the bay, can't believe that (damn)
Niggas fightin' over hoes, I done seen that
My old nigga is the opps, can't feel that (can't feel that)
Nigga dissin' Big Boogie, I ain't seen yet (I ain't seen yet)
It's some snake ass niggas we ain't kill yet (we ain't kill yet)
We got brand new bananas we ain't peel yet (brrt)
I got a future 'head of me that I ain't live yet
Cocky ass rappers, nigga shit ain't hit a mil' yet
When you broke, don't nobody wanna fuck wit' ya
When you got it, everybody say they stuck wit' ya
If you blind, you get buried in the dust quicker
You my brother, fuck them, it's just us nigga (redrum)
Redrum, them the people that I trust nigga (yeah)
Ain't no second guessin' shit, it's in my gut nigga (gut nigga)
If it's pressure on the pipes, it a bust nigga (duck)
Damn right, my temper bad, I'ma bust nigga (duck)
Yeah, them niggas shinin' hard, they ain't us, nigga (they ain't on us)
Yeah, them niggas got cars, they ain't us, nigga (they ain't us, nigga)
Yeah, them niggas got guns, they ain't bust, nigga (they ain't bust, nigga)
All my niggas got kids, bet' not fuck wit' 'em (bet' not fuck wit' 'em)
Redrum, Pitbulls, no mutts, nigga (no mutts, nigga)
Niggas changin' on they niggas, what the fuck, nigga? (What the fuck, nigga?)
Niggas showin' off guns just to take pictures (just to take pictures)
How you take it from a nigga and he ate wit' ya?
Only bitch ass niggas break the code (code)
These niggas so sour, that's a no
Redrum on my skull, they on go
Why I give my heart to people that fold?
I'm a boss to you niggas (I'm a boss to you niggas)
For this body bag it's gon' cost you little nigga (cost you little nigga)
Standin' ten solid, I ain't walkin' to you niggas
I been lost you lil' niggas (lost you lil' niggas)

Mm-hmm, mm
Mm-hmm, mm-mm
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm
Hmm-mm
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm
Mm-hmm, mm
