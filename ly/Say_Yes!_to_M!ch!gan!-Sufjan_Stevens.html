		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Demonstrate I was
Raised from the start
By a priest and
the maid on the part.
Still know what
to wear on my back:
Michigan!
Ponshewaing!
Cadillac!

If I ever meant to go away
I was raised, I was raised
In the place, in the place.
Still I often think of going back
To the farms, to the farms
Golden arms, golden arms
Start to remind me.

If the lakes took
the place of the sea.
If the cars drove
themselves, way to be!
Opposite to the trains moving in
Rivers run interstate, Michigan!

Still I never meant to go away
I was raised, I was raised
In the place, in the place.
Still I often think of going back
To the farms, to the farms
Golden arms, golden arms.
Tried to change the 
Made in Michigan
I was raised, I was raised
In the place, in the place,
Part to remind me.
