		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well since she put me down I've been out doin' in my head
Come in late at night and in the mornin' I just lay in bed

Well, rhonda you look so fine (look so fine)
And I know it wouldn't take much time
For you to help me rhonda
Help me get her out of my heart

Help me rhonda
Help, help me rhonda
Help me rhonda
Help, help me rhonda
Help me rhonda
Help, help me rhonda
Help me rhonda
Help, help me rhonda (bou, bou, bou)
Help me rhonda
Help, help me rhonda
Help me rhonda
Help, help me rhonda(bou, bou, bou)
Help me rhonda yeah
Get her out of my heart

She was gonna be my wife (bou, bou, bou)
And I was gonna be her man
But she let another guy come between us
And it ruined our plan

Well, rhonda you caught my eye (caught my eye)
And I can give you lotsa reasons why
You gotta help me rhonda
Help me get her out of my heart (bou, bou, bou, bou)

Help me rhonda
Help, help me rhonda
Help me rhonda
Help, help me rhonda (bou, bou, bou)
Help me rhonda
Help, help me rhonda
Help me rhonda
Help, help me rhonda
Help me rhonda
Help, help me rhonda
Help me rhonda
Help, help me rhonda
Help me rhonda yeah
Get her out of my heart

Help me rhonda
Help, help me rhonda
Help me rhonda
Help, help me rhonda
Help me rhonda
Help, help me rhonda
Help me rhonda
Help, help me rhonda
Help me rhonda
Help, help me rhonda
Help me rhonda
Help, help me rhonda
Help me rhonda yeah
Get her out of my heart
