		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Beast of Gévaudan, feared no sword and feared no gun
Sent from heaven, the seventh of creatures
Beast of Gévaudan, for the wrath of God to come
Came to sanction the mass and the preachers

Hunted by hundreds and never to be caught
Descent to wander, bring terror and take 'em all beyond

To the Father and the Son came the beast of Gévaudan
Terminator, a traitor, half wolf and half machine
To the prior and the nun came the beast of Gévaudan
A redeemer, believer, all fatal, mad and mean
Beast of Gévaudan

Beast of Gévaudan, Christ the force is on the run
Meant to feast on the treason of liars
Beast of Gévaudan, bring up Nemesis undone
Send the mass of profane to hellfire

Hunted by hundreds, all tempted to be fought
Ascent like thunder to tear down the enemies of God

To the Father and the Son came the beast of Gévaudan
Terminator, a traitor, half wolf and half machine
To the prior and the nun came the beast of Gévaudan
A redeemer, believer, all fatal, mad and mean
Beast of Gévaudan

In the night no man can run from the beast of Gévaudan
No escape from the fate of a martyr born in pain
When all prayers said and done, tame the land of Gévaudan
And the curse of the beast will remain

To the Father and the Son came the beast of Gévaudan
Terminator, a traitor, half wolf and half machine
To the prior and the nun came the beast of Gévaudan
A redeemer, believer, all fatal, mad and mean
Beast of Gévaudan
