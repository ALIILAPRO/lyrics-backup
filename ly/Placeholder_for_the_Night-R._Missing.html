		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought it would be darker
I thought it would be darker
But the night just passed through
It didnâ€™t want any trouble
In the morning I felt like a fool
When we entered the tunnel
Because I thought it would be brighter
I thought it would be brighter
In the morning I felt like a fool
When we entered the tunnel
Because I thought it would be brighter
I thought it would be brighter
In the morning I felt like a fool
When we entered the darker
We enter the darker
We enter the darker
We enter the darker
In the morning I felt like a fool
When we entered the tunnel
In the morning I felt like a fool
A fool
A fool
In the morning I felt like a fool
When we entered the tunnel
In the morning I felt like a fool
When we entered the tunnel
Because I thought it would be brighter
I thought it would be brighter
In the morning I felt like a fool
When we entered the darker
In the morning I felt like a fool
When we entered the darker
We enter the darker
We enter the darker
We enter the darker
