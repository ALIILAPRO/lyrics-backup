		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Spread the word, Otep has returned
Now watch me go werewolf on all these sheep

I've been cast aside, ostracized
By those who claim they're civilized
Their gods are made of knives
To carve us up and keep us divided
Watch them eat their own kind
This is what they call civilized
That's the way they survive
To carve us up and keep us divided

Da-da, da-da-da-da-da, da-da, ostracized
(Da-da, ostracized)
(Da-da, ostracized)
(Da-da, ostracized) I'm playing hide and seek with death
(Da-da)

I'm the nail
The wire
The noose from which you hang
A devil with no name

I'm the wound that will not heal
I'm the bruise you'll always feel
I'm the noose from which you hang
A devil with no name

Why am I still in this fight?
Still screaming over all their lies
Their gods are made of knives
To carve us up and keep us divided
Watch them eat their own kind
This is what they call civilized
That's the way they survive
To carve us up and keep us divided

Da-da, da-da-da-da-da, da-da, ostracized
(Da-da, ostracized)
(Da-da, ostracized) heed these scriptures from the edge

I'm playing hide and seek with death

I'm the nail
The wire
The noose from which you hang
A devil with no name

I'm the wound that will not heal
I'm the bruise you'll always feel
I'm the noose from which you hang
A devil with no name (devil with no name)

(Ah) blood

I'm the nail
The wire
The noose from which you hang 
A devil with no name

I'm the wound that will not heal
I'm the bruise you'll always feel
I'm the noose from which you hang
A devil with no name

I want you to hate me
With your dying breath
