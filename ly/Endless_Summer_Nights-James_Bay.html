		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In twenty-four hours, in the back of a car, we'll be fallin' apart
So we're goin' all in, seven-hundred percent, before it gets dark
Bloodshot eyes and sunburned
Some moments don't reverse

So stay up with me forever
Throw your arms around the night
All we are is now or never
Give me endless summer nights

You've been wearin' my shirt since Friday night
And we keep drinkin' up just to fake losin' our minds, we're all in disguise
I want you, do you want me?
We got nowhere else we should be

So stay up with me forever
Throw your arms around the night
All we are is now or never
Give me endless summer nights

I wanna see you in the blue midnight
Screamin' and dancin' in the glow of the lights
'Cause all I know is that I feel alive around you
Don't wanna let another moment slide
Every second at the speed of light
'Cause all I know is that I feel alive around you

So stay up with me forever
Throw your arms around the night
All we are is now or never
Give me endless summer, endless, oh
So stay up with me forever
Throw your arms around the night
All we are is now or never
Give me endless summer nights
