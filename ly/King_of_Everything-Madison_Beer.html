		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look at you go
Walking on everyone like stepping stones
Building a home
Made up of gold
Of people you hurt
Bridges to Hollywood you took then burned
I hope it was worth it
What you get, you'll deserve it

Easy come, easy go
Thought the view from the top would be different
In this stone cold bed that you made
Now you sleep alone in it

Baby, you're the king of everything
Building castles in the sand
That crumble in your hands (oh, oh)
Baby, you're the king of everything (oh-whoa, oh-oh)
And right now you're the man
But no one gives a damn
When the rain comes pouring down
To wash away your crown
You're the king of nothing now

Look what you've done
Taking advantage of people so young
Riding the highroad
On everyone's lows

Easy come, easy go
Thought the view from the top would be different
In this stone cold bed that you made
Now you sleep alone in it

Baby, you're the king of everything
Building castles in the sand
That crumble in your hands (oh, oh)
Baby, you're the king of everything (oh-whoa, oh-oh)
And right now you're the man
But no one gives a damn
When the rain comes pouring down
To wash away your crown
You're the king of nothing now
Now, now, now

Baby, you're the king of everything
Building castles in the sand
That crumble in your hands (oh, oh)
Baby, you're the king of everything (oh-whoa, oh-oh)
And right now you're the man
But no one gives a damn
When the rain comes pouring down
To wash away your crown
You're the king of nothing

When the rain comes pouring down
To wash away your crown
You're the king of nothing now
