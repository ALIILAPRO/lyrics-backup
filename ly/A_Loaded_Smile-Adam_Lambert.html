		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I say I'm sorry
It's just me selling a lie (um, um um, yeah)
When you're in my arms
I feel emptier inside
I never felt so satisfied
Everything falls into place but
I think I need a little more time
And yeah I know my life has changed but
Honestly I don't know if we'll survive
A loaded smile
An empty glass
And one last dance (um yeah)

Walking hand in hand
You are all I ever want
And when you're not around dear
Don't even notice that you're gone
We are barely hanging on
Everything falls into place but I
Think I need a little more time
And yeah I know my life has changed but
Honestly I don't know if we'll survive

Makes me want you baby (makes me want you baby)
Can't you feel, can't you feel it yeah (can't you feel it yeah)
Makes me want ya baby (oh it makes me want ya)
It's a certain kind of convocation
Makes me want ya baby (makes me want you)
Can't you feel, can't you feel it yeah (Can't you feel it)
Makes me want you baby (makes me want you baby)
It's a certain kind of convocation

Everything falls into place but I
Think I need a little more time
And yeah I know my life has changed but
Honestly I don't know if we'll survive
A loaded smile
An empty glass
And one last dance
