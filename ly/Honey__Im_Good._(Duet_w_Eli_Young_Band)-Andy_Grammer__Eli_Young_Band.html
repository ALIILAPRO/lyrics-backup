		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nah nah, honey I'm good
I could have another but I probably should not
I've got somebody at home

It's been a long night here, and a long night there
And these long, long legs are damn near everywhere
Hold up now, you look good, I will not lie
But if you ask where I'm staying tonight I gotta be like

Oh baby, no baby, you got me all wrong baby
My baby's already got all my love

So nah nah, honey I'm good
I could have another but I probably shouldn't
I've got somebody at home, and if I stay I might not leave alone
No, honey I'm good, I could have another but I probably shouldn't
I've gotta bid you adieu and to another I will stay true

(Hoo hoo wooh true) I will stay true
(Hoo hoo wooh true) I will stay true
(Hoo hoo wooh true)
(Hoo hoo wooh)

Now better men than me have failed
Drinking from that unholy grail
Now check it out, I've got her and she got me
And you've got that ass, but I kindly gotta be like

Oh baby, no baby, you got me all wrong baby
My baby's already got all my love

So nah nah, honey I'm good
I could have another but I probably shouldn't
I've got somebody at home, and if I stay I might not leave alone
No, honey I'm good, I could have another but I probably shouldn't
I've gotta bid you adieu and to another I will stay true

(Hoo hoo wooh true) I will stay true
(Hoo hoo wooh true) I will stay true
(Hoo hoo wooh true)
(Hoo hoo wooh)

Oh, I'm sure you, sure you will make somebody's night
But oh, I'll show you, show you it sure as hell's not mine

Oh no, honey I'm good
I could have another but I probably shouldn't
I've got somebody at home, and if I stay I might not leave alone
No, honey I'm good, I could have another but I probably shouldn't
I've gotta bid you adieu and to another I will stay

Nah nah, honey I'm good
I could have another but I probably shouldn't
I've got somebody at home, and if I stay I might not leave alone
No, honey I'm good, I could have another but I probably shouldn't
I've gotta bid you adieu and to another I will stay true

(Hoo hoo wooh true) I will stay true
(Hoo hoo wooh true) I will stay true
(Hoo hoo wooh true) I will stay true
(Hoo hoo wooh) I will stay

Singing out oh oh oh oh oh (hoo hoo wooh true)
Singing out oh oh oh oh oh (hoo hoo wooh true)
Singing out oh oh oh oh oh (hoo hoo wooh true)
Singing out oh oh oh oh oh (hoo hoo wooh true)
I will stay true
