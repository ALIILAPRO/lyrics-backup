		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't know how the spell was broken 
But you got me speakin' words I've never spoken
How did you do that?
How did you do that?
One heart driftin' in the ocean
Living in my own world 
Going through the motions
That was all I had
That was all I had
I don't want to waste more time
You took me so long to find

And I, I don't wanna spend my life wonderin'
Packin' up my heart and just runnin'
And I , I used to care a lot about nothin'
Now all I really know is this one thing
Baby, you and I, we could be somethin'

Love to watch you while you're sleeping
You give me a reason
Something to believe in 
Everything is better
Everything feels better
I don't want to waste more time
It took me so long to find

And I, I don't wanna spend my life wonderin'
Packin' up my heart and just runnin'
And I, I used to care a lot about nothin'
Now all I really know is this one thing
Baby, you and I we could be somethin'

Somethin' strong
Somethin' so right 
Baby, we could be something for the rest of our lives

And I, I don't wanna spend my life wonderin'
And I, I don't wanna spend my life wonderin'
Packin' up my heart and just running
And I, I used to care a lot about nothin'
Now all I really know is this one thing 
Baby, you and I we could be somethin'
Somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin'
