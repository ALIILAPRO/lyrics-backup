		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you're tired of feeling down
And always staying at home alone
Come with me, gonna go downtown
Gonna party all night long

Come on dance, dance, dance
Move to the music, let your heart go free
Dance, dance, dance, you can't refuse it
Dance, dance, dance with me

Let's go down to the Odyssey
They've got some people you oughta meet
They dance all night till the sun comes up
And then they dance right out on the street

I said dance, dance, dance
Move to the music, let your heart go free
Dance, dance, dance, you can't refuse it
Dance, dance, dance with me

Come on and dance, dance, dance
Move to the music, let your heart go free
Dance, dance, dance, you can't refuse it
Dance, dance, dance with me

I said dance, dance, dance
Move to the music, let your heart go free
Dance, dance, dance, you can't refuse it
Dance, dance, dance with me
