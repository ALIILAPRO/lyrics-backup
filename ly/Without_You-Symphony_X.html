		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Flying into the storm
Hanging on a broken wing
Onto every life
A little rain must fall

Oh, the words I sing
It's a greater thing
To have loved and lost
Than to never, ever
Loved at all

I've come undone
Oh, any fool can see
What's become of me

Sometimes I feel
Feels like there's nothing there
Just an empty stare
Sometimes I feel
Feels like with each passing day
Life just slips away
Without you

Drifting on the sea
A lonely ship without a sail
Sinking like a stone
Drowning in despair
Fighting tooth and nail
Mind the siren's wail
And here comes the night
But the moment's gone without a warning
Or without a prayer

I've come undone
Oh, fearing things unseen
Can I mend this broken dream?

Sometimes I feel
Feels like there's nothing there
Just an empty stare
Sometimes I feel
Feels like with each passing day
Life just slips away
Without you

The days slowly disappear, ooh
Time to face my fears
What will be will be, oh
I can't escape
I can't escape my
My destiny

Sometimes I feel
Feels like there's nothing there
Just an empty stare
Sometimes I feel
Feels like with each passing day
Life just slips away
Sometimes I feel
Feels like there's nothing there
Just an empty stare, oh
Sometimes I feel
Feels like there's nothing there
