		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When i'm on my own I think of all the ways I can get out
Fake a smile now 
It's alright now
If I just get up and leave somehow
And I'm all caught up in this hollow life it's on repeat
It's on repeat

I have this feeling it's eating away at me
This isn't who I am or my responsibility 
And I've got issues they're on repeat inside of my head
Let's play Russian Roulette 
And see if I am already dead

I'm already dead
I'm already dead
I'm already dead

The taste of metal on my tongue 
Empty the chamber one by one
Load the barrel trigger bail
There's no take two if you fail

The taste of metal on my tongue 
Maybe i'm having too much fun
My drug when life gets stale
Take a deep breath and exhale

But it's okay
Because i'm unhinged
I'll be a good sport 
And i'll let you win

I have this feeling it's eating away at me
This isn't who I am or my responsibility 
And I've got issues they're on repeat inside of my head
Let's play Russian Roulette 
And see if I am already dead

Stop
Count to three
Is this what you want
Because tonight it's between you and me
Stop
Count to three
Is this what you want
Because tonight it's between you and me
Stop
Count to three
Is this what you want
Because tonight it's between you and me
Stop
Count to three
Is this what you want
Because tonight it's between you and me

I have this feeling it's eating away at me
This isn't who I am or my responsibility 
And I've got issues they're on repeat inside of my head
Let's play Russian Roulette 
And see if I am already dead

I'm already dead
I'm already dead
I'm already dead
