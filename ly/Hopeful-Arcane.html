		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you have desires, to take it step by step
Take it up a notch and give it all your best
Or do you want that other
I could fuck you till’ the morning fix your troubles
I could touch you but you won’t feel I’m that lover
Reason why I’m askin’ is cuz’ I could feel it too
You’ve been broken once before and that keeps haunting you
And you can't figure it out, no
All that tension over things you can’t control, no
But stay hopeful
As I’m hopeful
That You’ll come through
Seems like you were wrong for thinking that it’s easy
The perception that it gives off sounds so pleasing
I know you’ve tried to control all your emotions
Yet you say you love me don’t want me is confusing
So don’t drag me into hell
Take a deep breath ask yourself what you want to have
It might take you down a path there’s no coming back from
Reason why I’m askin’ is cuz’ I could feel too
You’ve been broken once before and that keeps haunting you
And you can't figure it out, no
All that tension over things you can’t control, no
But stay hopeful
As I’m hopeful
That You’ll come through
Cuz’ I’m hopeful
That you're hopeful
Please stay hopeful
I need you
Ooo
Ooo
Ooo
Take it step by step
Let's take it step by step
