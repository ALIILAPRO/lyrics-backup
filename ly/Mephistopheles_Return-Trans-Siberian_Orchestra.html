		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In every life
It has been said
There comes a time to join the dead
Admit there is no second chance
And join death in a final dance

Across the floor eternity
Until the final moments bled
And in the dark to take his hand
Accept that it is time to wed

I don't know what I'm thinking
Because all that I see
Is his face grinning
Mephistopheles

I need to find an answer
For this one can not be
Within the words of mephistophel...

Tell me what you think
Tell me what you know
Did you really think
That there would be an ever after

Do you think I'm scared
Tell me does it show
When inside this deafness
I can always hear his whispering

( towards ghosts )

There comes a time you decide
What from your life will be real
What scars you will keep alive
What you are willing to heal

But can I gamble this night
With everything that I am
And can I erase my life
Or do I stay here and be damned

( towards twist )

Tell me what you think
Tell me what you know
Did you really think
That there would be an ever after

Do you think I'm scared
Tell me does it show
When inside this deafness
I can always hear his laughter

I don't know what I'm thinking
Because all that I see
Is his face grinning
Mephistopheles

I need to find an answer
For this one can not be
Within the words of mephistopheles

I

Don't need this path before me
Don't need forgotten glory
Don't need these threats of violence
Don't need eternal silence

Don't need these midnight visions
Don't need to make decisions
Don't need to be uncertain
Don't need this final curtain

Ii

Somewhere out there
He still gazes
As I wander through his mazes

Death and life here
Truth or lies
Every thought is well disguised

Iii

Now
It is too late
This path to take
Don't want to lose my life this way

Medusa dreams
The dead still scream
Don't want to see my life betrayed

Iv

All these things are now before me
Endless death or timeless glory
On this night of ghosts returning
To the light of bridges burning

Now it is too late
This path to take
Don't want to see my life be...( trayed )

( towards twist )

Tell me what you think
Tell me what you know
Did you really think
That there would be an ever after

Do you think I'm scared
Tell me does it show
When inside this deafness
I can always hear his laughter

I don't know what I'm thinking
Because all that I see
Is his face grinning
Mephistopheles

I need to find an answer
For this one cannot be
Within the words of mephistopheles

The cost of patience
When there's no time before me
Of hesitation
All for this twisted glory

And my salvation
The cost of how it's gotten
The cost of what's gained
All forgotten
All forgotten
