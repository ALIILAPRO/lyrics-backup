		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm in the pursuit of happiness
I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it
But the hours are getting longer
I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it
Easy on my back, going nine to ten
I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it
But the feeling's getting stronger
I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it

Easy as an ice cream sundae
Slipping outta your hand into the dirt
Easy as an ice cream sundae
Every dancer gets a little hurt

I'm in the pursuit of happiness
I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it
Every hour, I'm getting stronger
I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it
Easy on my back, going nine to ten
I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it
You know I can almost taste it
Melting on my fingertips

Easy as an ice cream sundae
Slipping outta your hand into the dirt
Easy as an ice cream sundae
Every dancer gets a little hurt
Hurt

Here's to getting hurt
To being down in the dirt
Can't give in
The end, again and again, and again

'Cause it's easy as an ice cream sundae
Slipping outta your hand into the dirt
Easy as an ice cream sundae
Every dancer gets a little hurt
Easy as an ice cream sundae
Slipping outta your hand into the dirt
Easy as an ice cream sundae
Every dancer gets a little hurt
Easy as an ice cream sundae
Oh, easy as an ice cream sundae
