		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me sleep
In the slumber of the morning
There’s nowhere I need to be
And my dreams are still calling

Lay your troubles on the ground
No need to worry about them now
Daylight shaking through the trees
Do not disturb me, let me be

And if you need a place a land
Or come down when you are weary
No more clouds to put away
In the slumber of the morning

Keep me with you on the ground
All of my worries behind me now
Daylight shaking through the trees
Do not disturb me, let me be

Let me sleep
In the slumber of tomorrow
There’s nowhere we need to be
That will not be there after

Keep me with you on the ground
All of my worries behind me now
And be sure to wake me when
Eternity begins
