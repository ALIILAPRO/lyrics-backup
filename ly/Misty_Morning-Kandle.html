		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Misty morning dark sky, running for the train 
Take me back to your arms so I may sleep again
Another time change and a suitcase in the way
Thought that I might cave rolling out the door
No one's ever wanted me to stay before 

Escaped to a mountain and a castle by the sea
I looked all around us but you only looked at me
I was frightened but you held on patiently 
I want to heal, want to give you more
No one's ever wanted me this way before 

OoooNever had a wish come true 

Felt like just a body since the age of 17
Learned to keep my mouth shut never saying what I mean
Now I see there's more than one thing that a boy could want from me 
Never did I dream I could be adored
No ones ever tried to stick around before
Can't help but ask how you're so sure 
No one's ever wanted to keep me before 

OoooNever had a wish come true
