		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Welcome
To the city
Said a young man
Sitting next to me
Heard you're new in town
Before you get around
Here's a little tip from me

Best stick to yourself
No matter where you go
Just watch your back
And hold your own
And if after that
Trouble's knockin' at your door
Remember my friend
It's a town we're fighting for

Welcome
To your paradise
Where the little man
Pays a bigger price
Take another hit
Just get it over with
We're a little sick you see

Can't stay down no more
We gotta make it known
So get back up
You're not alone
And then hit 'em back
Leave 'em grippin' to the floor
You never had a choice
They're knockin' at your door
Remember my friend
It's time
And this is war
It's time and this is war
War

Welcome
To the untold
Take a deep breathe
Take the higher road
It's what they always say
As if they know the way
They won't take it from me

But don't ever doubt yourself
'Cause life ain't just a dream
You make your own
So kick and scream
The people will act
With a never ending force
You never had the chance
So whatcha' waitin' for?
The day has come my friend
'Cause this is war
It's time and this is war
War

Light another wick
Better make it quick
We ain't got a lot of time
'Cause the powers that be
Don't want us free
So they gotta dull our shine

But when the dust settles in
They're gonna pays for their sins
I've made up my mind
Gotta stand side by side
As we drag all the lies
To the tables for sacrifice
It's time and this is war
It's time and this is war
War
