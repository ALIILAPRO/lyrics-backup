		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't dance, 'cause my feet won't let me
And I can't love, 'cause my heart won't let go
I can't tell no one the way I really feel
'Cause I don't feel nothing no more

And I came here, to remember what it's like
To hold someone, and then I saw you there dancing on your own and

There's a cure for me somewhere in here
There's a cure for me somewhere in here
There's a cure for me somewhere in here

You look like therapy
Exactly what I need
You're where the darkness meets the light
The perfect remedy
To heal this hurting me
Come be the therapy for me
And me for you, tonight

You look like therapy
You look like therapy
You look like therapy
You're where the darkness meets the light

Come be the therapy for me, and me for you
Yeah, you wanna know
Therapy, therapy, therapy, yeah

You look like therapy
You're where darkness meets the light
The perfect remedy
Come be the therapy for me
And me for you, tonight

Ooh, be my therapy
Oh, yeah, yeah
