		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your words they go like no mare
They sale the world high headed, yeah
I can't believe I'm still here
I know I should be dead, yeah

This desperation makes me feel so filthy
But I know if I don't stop I won't feel guilty
Take me higher
Pray me faster
Help me get her
Who I'm after

One time to take away all pain
One more to turn myself insane
One time to keep me high all day
Makes my reality fade away

There is no future waiting
There is no morning ever
I can't stop the place is spinning

My anti drugs get trashed, yeah
This paranoia stops my mind from sinking
I don't know if I'm awake or if I'm dreaming

Take me in you, won't be nice
Spit me out or wait and shine me

One time to take away all pain
One more to turn myself insane
One time to keep me high all day
Makes my reality fade away

One time to take away all pain
One more to turn myself insane
One time to keep me high all day
Makes my reality fade away
