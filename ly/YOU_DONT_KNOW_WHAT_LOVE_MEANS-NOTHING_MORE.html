		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't know what love means
And it's killing me
You don't know what love means
And it's killing me

Holding on
Spinning out
All my faith
Turns to doubts
Hopes and dreams
Plans we had
Set ablaze
A burning crash

I hope you get all your shit back together
I hope you know only you can make you better
And there's a world in which the two of us can still be sane
You'll see

So let's be honest
Let's be honest

You don't know what love means
And it's killing me
You don't know what love means
And it's killing me

I tried and tried
'Til it made me sick
Round and round
A toxic mix
Walls build up
You shut down
Ulcer grows
We're bleeding out

I hope you get all your shit back together
I hope you know only you can make you better

Let's be honest
Let's be honest

You don't know what love means
And it's killing me
You don't know what love means
And it's killing me

We're colliding
Losing hope
Can we make it further on our own?

We keep colliding
And we're losing hope
On a one way street
Going down a broken road

Crashing endlessly

I can't sleep
I can't eat
There's no rest
There's no peace

So let's be honest
Let's be honest

You don't know what love means
And it's killing me
You don't know what love means
And it's killing me

We're colliding
Losing hope
Can we make it further on our own?

We keep colliding
And we're losing hope
On a one way street
Going down a broken road

Crashing endlessly
Crashing endlessly
We keep crashing
We keep crashing endlessly
