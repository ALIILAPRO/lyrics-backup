		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As I lay here with you
The shame lies with us
We talk of love and trust
That doesn't matter

Though we may be the last in the world
We feel like pioneers
Telling hopes and fears
To one another

And, oh, what a feeling inside of me
It might last for an hour
Wounds aren't healing inside of me
Though it feels good now
I know it's only for now

The feeling is intense
You grip me with your eyes
And then I realise
It doesn't matter
