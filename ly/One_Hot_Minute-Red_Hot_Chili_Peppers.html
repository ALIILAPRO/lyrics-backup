		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was riding
Riding on my bike
Me with my friend
We're so alike

Am I all alone
She said all we
Have is this
We just had to stop
And share a kiss

Am I all alone
One hot minute and I'm in it come and get it 
One hot minute and I'm in it come and get it 
One hot minute and I'm in it come and get it 

If I chase it I might waste it, come and spit it

Am I all alone
Am I all alone

Sitting in the fire
Get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher
Maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
Breathe the moon and eat the sun
Sitting in the fire

Close your eyes and click your heels
Can you believe how good it feels

Am I all alone
One hot minute and I'm in it come and get it 
One hot minute and I'm in it come and get it 
One hot minute and I'm in it come and get it 
If I chase it I might waste it come and spit it

Am I all alone
Am I all alone

Sitting in the fire
Get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher
Maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
Breathe the moon and eat the sun
Sitting in the fire

Say goodbye to where you got it now
Pay your father, pay your twenty, take a bow
Say goodbye to where you buy you got it now
Pay your mamma, pay your father take a bow
Say goodbye to where you buy you got it now
Pay your father, pay your twenty, take a bow

Three pounds of love inside my skull
A million more lives it's never dull
Just a few times spun, spun around the sun
A couple more or less and then we're done

Sitting in the fire, I get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher, oh, maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
I'll breathe the moon and eat the sun
Sitting in the fire
