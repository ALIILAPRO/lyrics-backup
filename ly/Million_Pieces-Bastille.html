		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I breathe in hard
Don't speak, 'cause it's like a bitter pill
You blow my mind
It makes my heart beat
Harder, harder, harder, hard
The king's a clown
No one is love and it's not a drill
Don't look outside
The world is ending
Faster, faster, faster, faster, fast

The echoes of that news ring loud
(The echoes, the echoes)
No sound can ever drown it out
(The echoes)

It breaks my heart
Beaks my heart into
A million pieces, oh
It breaks my heart into
A million pieces
If it's gonna break me
Won't you let me go
Leave it 'til the morning
I don't wanna know
Breaks my heart
Breaks my heart into
A million pieces
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
A million pieces

We're too far gone
Nothing I say will mean anything
Just drink, fuck, dance
Right through disaster
I don't want to talk about it now

The echoes of that news ring loud
(The echoes, the echoes)
No music ever drowns it out
(The echoes)

It breaks my heart
Beaks my heart into
A million pieces, oh
It breaks my heart into
A million pieces
If it's gonna break me
Won't you let me go
Leave it 'til the morning
I don't wanna know
Breaks my heart
Breaks my heart into
A million pieces
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
A million pieces

Get fear and loathing out your mind
And don't pull me, don't pull me down from the ceiling

It breaks my heart
It beaks my heart into
A million pieces, oh
It breaks my heart into
A million pieces
If it's gonna break me
Won't you let me go
Leave it 'til the morning
I don't wanna know
Breaks my heart
Breaks my heart into
A million pieces
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
A million pieces
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
A million pieces
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
A million pieces
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
