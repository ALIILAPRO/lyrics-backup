		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Since your death 
Everything has felt so meaningless and vain 
That IÂ´ve lost the will to live 

Love, your death 
Ripped my heart right out and since you went away 
LifeÂ´s had nothing more to give 

Cross my heart and hope to die 
May my end come tonight 
Across the dark, into the light 
May death again us unite 

Love, my fate 
Will you wait for me there, where our autumn dawns? 
There, beyond the dreary seas 

Will you wait? 
Will you welcome me into your arms once more? 
Where our waters still fall free 

Cross my heart and hope to die 
May my end come tonight 
Across the dark, into the light 
May death again us unite 

Cross my heart and hope to die 
May my end come tonight 
IÂ´ll depart from this life 
May death again us unite 

May it come 

My heart went down with you 
At your funeral I was buried, too 
My life, it ended with yours 
And I exist no more
