		<p>
		  I'm crazy
I'm crazy
I'm crazy
I'm crazy

Friends tell me I am crazy
cnd I'm wasting time with you
You'll never be mine
It's not the way I see it
'Cause I feel you're already mine
Whenever you're with me (oh, oh, oh)

People always talkin' about
Your reputation
I don't care about your other girls
Just be good to me (oh, oh, oh)

Just be good to me
Just be good to me
Just be good to me
Just be good to me
I'm crazy
I'm crazy
I'm crazy
I'm crazy

People always talkin' about
Your reputation
I don't care about your other girls
Just be good to me (oh, oh, oh)

People always talkin' about
Your reputation
I don't care about your other girls
Just be good to me (oh, oh, oh)

Just be good to me
Just be good to me
Just be good to me
Just be good to me
I'm crazy
I'm crazy
I'm crazy
I'm crazy

People always talkin' about
Your reputation
I don't care about your other girls
Just be good to me (oh, oh, oh)

Just be good to me
Just be good to me
Just be good to me
Just be good to me
I'm crazy
I'm crazy
I'm crazy
I'm crazy
