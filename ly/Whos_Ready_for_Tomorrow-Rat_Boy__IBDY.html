		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ain't your average sicko
I'm dead, just like disco
My bank account is 000, oh no
I think I need a hero (oh)
I don't have no ego (nah)
'Cause I'm spitting out now, woah (woah)

I was a teenage outlaw
With no worries on my mind
And now I'm getting older
My heart is growing colder all the time

(Woah)
I was a teenage outlaw
With no worries on my mind
And now I'm getting older
My heart is growing colder all the time (woah)

I was a teenage outlaw
With no worries on my mind
And now I'm getting older
My heart is growing colder all the time

Woah
