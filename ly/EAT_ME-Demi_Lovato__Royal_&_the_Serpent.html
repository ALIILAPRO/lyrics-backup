		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Be more predictable
Be less political
Not too original
Keep to tradition, but stay individual
Dirty but washable
Winning but stoppable
All that I'm hearing is you wanna
Make the impossible possible

Is this what you'd all prefer?
Would you like me better if I was still her?
Did she make your mouths water? Ugh

I know the part I've played before
I know the shit that I've ignored
I know the girl that you adored
She's dead, it's time to fucking mourn
I can't spoon-feed you anymore
I can't spoon-feed you anymore
Dinner's served, it's on the floor
I can't spoon-feed you anymore
You'll have to eat me as I am
You'll have to eat me as I am

Clean and digestible (clean and digestible)
Less of a spectacle (less of a spectacle)
Oh, and dimensional
Try to be sexy, but don't be too sexual (don't be too sexual)
Please be presentable (please be presentable)
Bit more accessible (bit more accessible)
Get up on your pedestal
Everyone's watching, so don't be forgettable

Longer hair and tighter clothes
Would you like me better if I didn't oppose?
Silver platters, pretty bows, fuck

I know the part I've played before
I know the shit that I've ignored
I know the girl that you adored
She's dead, it's time to fucking mourn
I can't spoon-feed you anymore
I can't spoon-feed you anymore
Dinner's served, it's on the floor
I can't spoon-feed you anymore
You'll have to eat me as I am
You'll have to eat me as I am

Choke on it
Choke on it

I know the part I've played before
I know the shit that I've ignored
I know the girl that you adored
She's dead, it's time to fucking mourn
I can't spoon-feed you anymore
I can't spoon-feed you anymore
Dinner's served, it's on the floor
I can't spoon-feed you anymore
You'll have to eat me as I am
You'll have to eat me as I am
