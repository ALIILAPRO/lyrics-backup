		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dream on
Though its hard to tell
Though you're foolin yourself
Dream on

You can hide away
There is nothing to say, so dream on
Dream on
Though its hard to tell
Though you're foolin' yourself, dream on

You can laugh at me because I'm crying
You can tell your friends how much
I begged you to stay
You can live your fantasy without me
But you'll never know how much I needed you

Dream on
Its so easy for you
Though I'm broken in two, dream on
Dream on
You can never see
What you're doing to me, so dream on

You can cross your heart and still be lyin
You can count the reasons why you've thrown it away
You can dream your life away without me
But you'll never know how much I needed you

You can laugh at me because I'm crying
You can tell your friends how much
I begged you to stay
You can live your fantasy without me
But you'll never know how much I needed you

Dream on
Its so easy for you
Though I'm broken in two, dream on
Dream on
You can never see
What you're doin' to me, so dream on
Dream on
Though its hard to tell
Though you're foolin' yourself,dream on
Dream on
