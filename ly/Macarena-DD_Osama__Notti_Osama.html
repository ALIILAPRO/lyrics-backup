		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dale a tu cuerpo alegría, Macarena
Que tu cuerpo es pa' darle
Alegría y cosa buena
Dale a tu cuerpo alegría, Macarena
Eh, Macarena, ¡Ay!

We talkin' 'bout opps, spin in the V
(Like, what?)
Better duck when you run into me
Let's smoke on them Crips, got put on a tee
(Damn) oY or no Y, I ain't switchin' my team
Got a deuce with a big-ass beam
If you wanna die just run into (Me)
If you wanna die just run into, grrah
If you wanna die just run into

Dead Makks, on my O
Fuck JB, got hit in his throat (JB)
Yo, Notti, roll Blay
Mix with Woo Lotti, give a fuck 'bout Kay
(Rippy) roll Dummy, he funny, grrah
That's a face to the face (Grrah-grrah-grrah)
Grrah, grrah, grrah, grrah
That's a face to the face
Lotti had diеd and they ain't do a thing
(Lotti) spin through the 8 and we
Ain't shootin' from deep
Free Banga, you know that hе tweaked
Face-shot gang, where the Beniga spleef?
(Spleeza)
But it's always a dead nigga every week
Gotta make sure it won't be, grrah
(Grrah-grrah)
Gotta make sure it won't be a me

Yeah, it's O-block or no block
Scream, "DOA, " yeah
I'm dumpin' like two chops
(Grrah-grrah-grrah)
Like, Chase, you a bitch
That's why yo' ass got slapped with the grip
On bro, stop lyin' and shit (Lotti)
How many niggas gon' die on they drill?
Smokin' JB, he stuck in my spliff
(Like, what?)
Here with DD, let's take a trip
We ain't these fans, we stay with a grip
Like, J Star the Makk then
We dump out the whip (Ewokk)
JB ass died so I'm tappin' my shh
JB ass died so I'm tappin' my neck on the set
How the fuck do you die in your 'jects?
Rah Rah, JayRip, both got me laced
How the fuck do you die the day
Spin through the opps, bitch
I'm leavin' no trace
Lotti had died and they ain't do a thing
Like, fuck it, that nigga today (Grrah)
I'ma just up and leave him where he lay
Yo, Uddy, that's a opp?
Brodie go geek, go up it and flock
Can't link no bitch if I don't got knocks
(Grrah-grrah, boom, grrah)
Can't link no bitch if I
Don't got knocks, grrah-grrah, boom

We talkin' 'bout opps, spin in the V
Better duck when you run into me
Let's smoke on them Crips, got put on a tee
OY or no Y, I ain't switchin' my team
Got a deuce with a big-ass beam
If you wanna die just run into
If you wanna die just run into, grrah
If you wanna die just run into me
Grrah, smokin' all deads, nigga suck my dick
Grrah, grrah, grrah-grrah-grrah
