		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Hey you
Come over here
I have something to tell you
I know you don't know this
But you're a cliche
You screw up everything

I'm so embarrassed for you
I'm so embarrassed for us
You ruined everything for us
Everybody laughs behind your back (where would you be without me?)

Where would you be without me?

Where would you be without me?
Where would you be without me?
Where would you be without me?
Where would you be without me?
Where would you be without me?

Where would you be without me?

When you dance you look like a clown
You ruined everything
When you move you look like a clown
You ruined everything
I like your makeup but you look like a clown
You ruined everything

Where would you be without me?

Where would you be without me?
Where would you be without me?
Where would you be without me?
Where would you be without me?
Where would you be without me?
It's too late 
Where would you be without me?

If everyone knew you
You wouldn't have any friends
You screw up everything
I didn't want to tell you
But I have to
I, I have to because I care
I'm the only one who cares

Where would you be without me?

Where would you be without me?
Where would you be without me?
Where would you be without me?
Where would you be without me?
Where would you be without me?
It's too late 
Where would you be without me?

I'm just trying to help you (you don't trust me)
You're insane (I thought you loved me)
You're insane (but you don't trust me)
You're insane

I thought you cared
The real you would never question me
I'm just trying to help you

Where would you be without me?

Where would you be without me?
Where would you be without me?
Where would you be without me?
Where would you be without me?

Do you want to go back to where you were?
Do you want to go back to how you were living?
Where would you be without me?

Would you like another pill?
You ruined everything
I'm just trying to help you
