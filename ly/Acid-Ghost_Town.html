		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One drop on my tongue
I'll take a little taste for fun
In the kitchen when it starts to kick in
I'm crawlin' up the walls
Lookin' for a place to fall
I'm on the counter these voices gettin' louder

"Is this think on?"
"Make way for the King!"
"Someone pinch me."
"Oh shit, its not a dream"

And I can't turn you off
No, I can't turn you off

Purple smoke and candy skulls
Colors bleeding through the walls
Dripping, swirling as they fall
I turn my head like someone called
Gotta get her number
Before she melts away!
Hot damn, where's my phone?
I think I'm in this room alone
I come the reality that its a dream
I really wanna leave this place
I need someone to slap me in the fucking face!

And I can't turn you off
No, I can't turn you off

Stand up and shake it off
Show us that you're still breathing
You know it can't be stopped
It's taking over, the
Darkness will carry you
Make sure to bury your dead
Before they alter your mind
Before they come back to life

It's taking over
It's haunting you
This feeling's taking over
I think its changing you

I can't turn you off
No, I can't turn you off
