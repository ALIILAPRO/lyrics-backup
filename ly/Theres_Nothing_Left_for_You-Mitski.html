		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's nothin' left for you
Nothin' in this room
Try and go outside
Nothin' waits for you

You had it once before
Not anymore
So go on to that sweetheart's door
And find a new you

Give her all the love you saved for it

You could touch fire
You could fly
It was your right
It was your life

And then it passed
To someone new
It'll keep passin' on
Long after you

But you're the only one
She's countin' on

There's nothin' left for you
