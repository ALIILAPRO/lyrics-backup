		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cos I've been on my own
I've been feeling low
And I've been smoking too much weed
Lately and yes it shows
That I've been staying out
Trying to get these pounds
But sometimes I'm alone and in my
Head I hear the sirens
I've been waiting round for all this time
Wondering if you'll call my line
But I don't know
If I'm gonna heal with the time

I don't wanna leave this but
We gotta' keep moving
Two paths and I got to be choosing
Hand on my heart, I'm hurt that we're over
Now it's MJ and the yak I'm abusing
I don't need time
I just want what we once had
We had trust in each other but I fucked that
If you ask for the moon
I'd jump on the very next flight
And still get the bus back
Cos I'm in need of your love
But you're saying "how could I trust you?
When you had me from the start
You're always involved in some trouble"
Maybe I am
Maybe I'm stuck in my negative ways
Said that I quit, but I'm drinking again and
I'm dreading to think that
You're doing the same

Cos I've been on my own
I've been feeling low
And I've been smoking too much weed
Lately and yes it shows
That I've been staying out
Trying to get these pounds
But sometimes I'm alone and in my
Head I hear the sirens
I've been waiting round for all this time
Wondering if you'll call my line
But I don't know
If I'm gonna heal with the time
First time that we met was smiles
And roses, sex and drugs
Two lovers in motion
Think back when I was jumping trains
You would lend me Ps
So there's never commotion
I need a real one to the side of me
I like someone to confide in me
I'm not perfect, but I try to be
I like bank rolls and designer jeans
I think of the times you sat in
The passenger side thinking you're DJ Khalid
Now I'm alone, I'm searching for bangers
I just found our tune but none of it matters
Hearts gone cold, feel I'm in wizard of oz
I'm the tin man

Put our love in the trash for the binman

Cos I've been on my own
I've been feeling low
And I've been smoking too much weed
Lately and yes it shows
That I've been staying out
Trying to get these pounds
But sometimes I'm alone and in my
Head I hear the sirens
I've been waiting round for all this time
Wondering if you'll call my line
But I don't know
If I'm gonna heal with the time
