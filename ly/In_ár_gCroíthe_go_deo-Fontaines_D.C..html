		  (In ár gCroíthe)
(In ár gCroíthe)

Gone is the day, gone is the night
Gone is the day
Gone is the day, gone is the night
Gone is the day
Gone is the day, gone is the night
Gone is the day
Gone is the day, gone is the night
gone is the day

She defines the only answer
And I never had the time
She defines the only reason for feeling
All in all is all we tailor
And they always have the best
And she defines the only reason for feeling

Gone is the day, gone is the night
Gone is the day
Gone is the day, gone is the night
Gone is the day
Gone is the day, gone is the night
Gone is the day
Gone is the day, gone is the night
gone is the day

She defines the only answer
And I never had the time
She defines the only reason for feeling
All in all is all we tailor
And they always have the best
And she defines the only reason for feeling, ah, ah

Gone is the day, gone is the night
Gone is the day
Gone is the day, gone is the night
Gone is the day
Gone is the day, gone is the night
Gone is the day
Gone is the day, gone is the night
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone

(In ár gCroíthe)
(In ár gCroíthe)

She defines the only answer
And I never had the time
She defines the only answer to feeling
All in all is all we tailor
And they always had the best
She defines the only reason for feeling, ah, ah, ah

Gone is the day, gone is the night
Gone is the day
Gone is the day, gone is the night
Gone is the day
Gone is the day, gone is the night
Gone is the day
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone
