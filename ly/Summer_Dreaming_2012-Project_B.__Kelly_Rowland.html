		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What a feeling
It's never been so easy
When I'm dreaming
Summer dreaming, when you're with me
What a feeling
It's never been so easy
When I'm dreaming
Doing things that feel so good

Come on over, let's have some fun
Dancing in the morning sun
Looking to the bright blue sky
Come and let your spirit fly
You're, living it up this brand new day
Summer sun, it's time to play
Let yourself go go go
Doing things that feel so good

What I'm feeling
It's never been so easy
When I'm dreaming
Summer dreaming, when you're with me
What I'm feeling
It's never been so easy
When I'm dreaming
Summer dreaming, when you're with me

What I'm feeling (Oh whoa oh whoa)
When I'm dreaming (Oh whoa oh whoa)
What I'm feeling (Oh whoa oh whoa)
When I'm dreaming
Summer dreaming, when you're with me

Just another lucky day
No one ever makes me feel this way
And loving you, it feels so right
Baby now that you're by my side
Living it up this brand new day
Summer sun, it's time to play
Let yourself go go go
Doing things that feel so good

What I'm feeling
It's never been so easy
When I'm dreaming
Summer dreaming, when you're with me
What I'm feeling
It's never been so easy
When I'm dreaming
Summer dreaming, when you're with me

What I'm feeling (Oh whoa oh whoa)
When I'm dreaming (Oh whoa oh whoa)
What I'm feeling (Oh whoa oh whoa)
When I'm dreaming
Summer dreaming, when you're with me

Feel so
You make me feel so
Feel so
Feel so

What I'm feeling
It's never been so easy
When I'm dreaming
Summer dreaming, when you're with me
What I'm feeling
It's never been so easy
When I'm dreaming
Summer dreaming, when you're with me

When I'm dreaming
What a feeling
Summer dreaming, when you're with me
