		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ooh ooh-hoo, ah ya, ah no ah ah oh)
(One day, one day, one day)
(Ah no oh oh oh) 

Sometimes I lay under the moon
I thank God I'm breathin'
Then I pray don't take me soon
'Cause I am here for a reason

Sometimes in my tears I drown
But I never let it get me down
So when negativity surrounds
I know someday it'll all turn around because

All my life I been waitin' for
I been prayin' for, for the people to say
That we don't want to fight no more
They'll be no more wars
And our children will play

One day (one day), one day (one day), one day 
(Oh oh oh)
One day (one day), one day (one day), one day 
(Oh oh oh)

It's not about win or lose 'cause we all lose
When they feed on the souls of the innocent
Blood drenched pavement
Keep on movin', though the waters stay ragin'

In this maze you can lose your way, your way
It might drive you crazy
But don't let it phase you, no way, no way

Sometimes in my tears I drown (I drown)
But I never let it get me down (get me down)
So when negativity surrounds (surrounds)
I know someday it'll all turn around because

All my life I been waitin' for (waitin' for)
I been prayin' for (prayin' for), for the people to say
That we don't want to fight no more (fight no more)
They'll be no more wars (no more wars)
And our children will play

One day (one day), one day (one day), one day (oh oh oh oh)
One day (oh oh oh)
One day (one day), one day (one day), one day 
(Oh oh oh)

One day this all will change
Treat people the same
Stop with the violence down with the hate
One day we'll all be free and proud to be 
Under the same sun
Singing songs of freedom like

One day, one day 
(Oh oh oh)
One day, one day 
(Oh oh oh)

All my life I been waitin' for
I been prayin' for, for the people to say 
That we don't want to fight no more
They'll be no more wars
And our children will play

One day (one day), one day (one day), one day 
(Oh oh oh)
One day (one day), one day (one day), one day 
(Oh oh oh)

(Ooh ooh-hoo, ah ya, ah no ah ah oh)
(One day, one day, one day)
(Ah no oh oh oh)
