		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got your back against the wall
No time left, no time to stall
Life is about to shoot
But you don't know when, you don't know who

Under the gun
Under pressure and anxiety
You gotta find a way
Under the gun
Or there is hell to pay
Under the gun
Eventually
Gotta do what you gotta do

Doing what does not belong
Doing what you know is wrong
Pressure building up to critical mass
Trying not to break the hourglass

Got no room to make mistakes
Stuck between a rock and a hard place
Life is about to shoot
But you don't know when, you don't know who
