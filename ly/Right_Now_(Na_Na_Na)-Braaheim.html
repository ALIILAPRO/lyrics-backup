		  Lyrics:
It's been so long that I haven't seen your face
I'm trying to be strong, but the strength I have is washing away
It won't be long before I get you by my side
And just hold you, tease you, squeeze you, tell you what's been on my mind

I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now na na

Girl I know, mistakes were made between us two
And we showed our eyes that night even said some things weren't true
Watch you go? And haven't seen my girl since then
Why can't it be the way it was' cause you were my Homie, lover, and friend

I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now na na

I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now na na
