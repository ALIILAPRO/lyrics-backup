		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My home has beautiful eyes
The cutest nose, the prettiest smile
My home likes starry nights
Is short in height and sometimes bites

My home has got a couple windows to my soul
My home somehow makes me feel so whole
My home feels like gold

My home won't ever be a place
My home has the most beautiful face
My home, you're my home

You're the one who makes me feel like a child
You're the one who always makes me smile
My home
You're my home, I won't let you go

I feel so safe, no worries now
You are my home, do you even know?
'Cause when I fall, you catch me somehow
I'll give my all, I'll love you real loud

My home won't ever be a place
My home has the most beautiful face
My home, you're my home

You're the one who makes me feel like a child
You're the one who always makes me smile
My home
You're my home, I won't let you go

My home, my home
My home (you're my home)
You're my home, my home
My home
You're my home
