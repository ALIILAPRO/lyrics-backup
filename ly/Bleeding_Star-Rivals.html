		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody has their heroin
Trying to find their way numb their hearts
Poison dressing up like medicine
Everybody loves a bleeding star

Tattoos covered his skin
Eyes as empty as his Mercedes Benz
His poor father beat him to shreds
Trauma deeper then the Mariana trench

He fills his void with drama and sex
A new partner that he barely met
His girlfriends home she's crying in bed
Wondering what he's probably doing instead

Hurt people, hurt people
Passing on the pain

Everybody has their heroin
Trying to find their way numb their hearts
Poison dressing up like medicine
Everybody loves a bleeding star

Can't really blame dealer dealer
Cause He's tryna be the healer healer

She stood about 102
At 5'9 she was as thin as noose
Her poor mother told, if you
Want a man you better never consume

Hurt people, hurt people
Passing on the pain

Everybody has their heroin
Trying to find their way numb their hearts
Poison dressing up like medicine
Everybody loves a bleeding star

Everybody has their heroin
Trying to find their way numb their hearts
Poison dressing up like medicine
Everybody loves a bleeding star

Everybody has their heroin
Trying to find their way numb their hearts
Poison dressing up like medicine
Everybody loves a bleeding star
