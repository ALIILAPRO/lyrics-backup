		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put me up above the boy 
The one I love I should destroy 
My sweet tooth has burned a hole 
Forget about it all 

He hit so hard 
I saw stars 
He hit so hard 
I saw God 

He's cold give him a candycoat 
He can't swim but he can float 
One by one they all fall down 
I look at him and drown 

He hit so hard 
I saw stars 
He hit so hard 
I saw God 

He's so candy my downfall 
Melts in my mouth 'til he's nothing at all 
This keeps me, I can't sleep 
He rages to be true 

He hit so hard 
I saw stars 
He hit so hard 
I saw God 

Oh, man, he hit so hard 
I saw stars 
He hit so hard 
I saw God
