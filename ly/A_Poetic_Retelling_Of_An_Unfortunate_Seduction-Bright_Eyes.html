		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The language in the dimmer rooms
Seems to represent the light source well
How soft they speak and seem to be at peace
With the music and the madness that is pulling me into this

And the shades of the lamps are woven red
The light, it stains and consecrates
Anointing all forgotten forms that swirl and smoke
And haunt this place

The girls in gowns all nurse the dark
Pulling it near to their swelling breasts
And watch as it seeps to their hearts
And beats within their virgin chests

And here I know seduction breeds
From wanton hearts that would seduce
And grows and spreads it's vine and leaves
Embracing those who might have moved

But now remain to drink the night from vials black and thick
With intoxicating delights would leave you drunk
Inside this dream
And you watch them take the light from you

And you find yourself on a velvet couch
Tasting the skin of a foreign girl
Her eyes are black and wet like oil
And she ties your hands with a string of pearls

And you tremble like a frightened bird
As she closes in and captures you to place you
In a silver cage deep within her poisoned womb
So once you're safe inside, she might let you out

To fly in circles around the room
But it's always night and there is no moon
And you wonder if you are still alive
And you're not sure if you want to be

But you drink her sweat like it was wine
And you lay with her on a bed of blue
And it's awful sweet
Like the fruit she cuts and feeds to you
