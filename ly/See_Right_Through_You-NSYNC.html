		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me what kind of girl
Would want to play me
Tear me down and
Try to break me
Baby, how could you betray me
After all I've done for you
Take it there
But your damn ass has
Lied enough babe
Better get your story straight babe
Tell me why you want to play
I've had enough
These games they've gotta stop
About to get pissed off
You had to keep leading me on
Baby, I thought
You had me fooled
But I see right through you

Look in to my eyes
Tell me what you see
You see a man
Who thought you loved me
Played me like a fool
But I see right through you
I look in to your eyes
Tell you what I see
I see a girl who made me lonely
Though you had me fooled
But I see right through you

Tell me girl what's his name
What he do to take you
Does he freak you the way
That I do
'Cause you know that
I know how to
(I know how to)
When he leaves you
Don't come crying back to me
'Cause I'll be moving on you see
And you'll be just a memory
I think I've had enough

These games they've gotta stop
About to get pissed off
You had to keep leading me on
Baby, I thought
You had me fooled
But I see right through you

Look in to my eyes
Tell me what you see
You see a man
Who thought you loved me
Played me like a fool
But I see right through you
I look in to your eyes
Tell you what I see
I see a girl who made me lonely
Though you had me fooled
But I see right through you

Thought you had me fooled
See right
Through you
Oh, see see see, right
Through you

Baby tell me does he
Do it do it like I do
Baby tell me will he
Love you love you like I do
Now you whining
'Cause you can't believe
The way its through
I don't care cause I
See right through you
Let me tell you that uh
This is how it's gonna be
Thought I'd forgive for
What you did to me
But you won't do this to me
'Cause now I
See right through you

Look in to my eyes
Tell me what you see
You see a man
Who thought you loved me
Played me like a fool
But I see right through you
I look in to your eyes
Tell you what I see
I see a girl who made me lonely
Though you had me fooled
But I see right through you

Look in to my eyes
Tell me what you see
You see a man
Who thought you loved me
Played me like a fool
But I see right through you
I look in to your eyes
Tell you what I see
I see a girl who made me lonely
Though you had me fooled
But I see right through you

See right through you
See right through you
