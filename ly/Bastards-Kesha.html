		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, three, four, one

I got too many people (da da da da) I got left to prove wrong
All those motherfuckers (da da da da) been too mean for too long
And I'm so sick of crying, yeah
Darling, what's it for?
I could fight forever, oh, but life's too short

Don't let the bastards get you down, oh no
Don't let the assholes wear you out
Don't let the mean girls take the crown
Don't let the scumbags screw you 'round
Don't let the bastards take you down

Been underestimated my entire life
I know people gonna talk shit (da da da da), and darling, that's fine
But they won't break my spirit, I won't let 'em win
I'll just keep on living, keep on living, oh
The way I wanna live

Don't let the bastards get you down, oh no
Don't let the assholes wear you out
Don't let the mean girls take the crown
Don't let the scumbags screw you 'round
Don't let the bastards take you down
Don't let the bastards get you down, oh no
Don't let the assholes wear you out
Don't let the mean girls take your crown
Don't let the scumbags screw you 'round
Don't let the bastards take you down

Na na na, la da da da da da, na na hey, na na hey
Na na na, la da da da da da, na na hey, na na hey
Na na na, la da da da da da, na na hey, na na hey
Na na na, la da da da da da, na na hey, na na hey

So was that a good one?
Should we go again?
