		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

I don't go for no type of bogus shit (ah)
She just wanna take a picture (ah-ah), strike a pose with it
Twenty-five hundred on my bitch, she stole it, whoa (ooh)
Yeah, double deck of hoes in it, they know I'm for sho', they knock on my door with it
Donny on a roll, couple bowls, I'm gon' get in it
They gon' go-go crazy, I popped the door with it, yeah (ooh, yeah)
'Til it's over ('til it's over)
'Til it's over ('til it's over)
'Til it's over ('til it's over)
'Til it's over ('til it's over)

It's another day, on another plane, on another flight (uh-uh)
Now pull up, leave the door open, I'm gon' tonight (yeah-yeah)
And I tried to fall in love wit' you, wasn't seemin' right, wasn't seemin' right (see me right)
Speed off in a Lambo, you hear the pipes buss
I just wanna hit it here for one night 'cause
Goin' off with little shawty like a robbery, whoa
Why would I waste my time if you ain't got time for me, whoa
Two tone Patek (shut up)
Two tone at your neck (ah, haha)
Know I need respect (whoa)
Know I need respect (whoa)
You know I need my money, a hunnid thousand checks (uh-huh)
But might call Zoey Dollaz, and run straight to the 'jects
I'm out in Florida, huh, blow that back, and blow that hun-
By the time my fit is on, cross the line, no border, huh
I gotta go fill me up (fill me up)
Fill me up (fill me up)
Border

I don't go for no type of bogus shit (ah)
She just wanna take a picture (ah-ah), strike a pose with it
Twenty-five hundred on my bitch, she stole again, whoa (ooh)
Yeah, double deck of hoes in it, they know I'm for sho', they knock on my door with it
Donny on a roll, couple bowls, I'm gon' get in it
They gon' go-go crazy, I popped the door with it, yeah (ooh, yeah)
'Til it's over ('til it's over)
'Til it's over ('til it's over)
'Til it's over ('til it's over)
'Til it's over ('til it's over)

Yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (strike a pose with it, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
