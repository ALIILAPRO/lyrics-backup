		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm your baby girl
Been six years, say I'm, I'm your world
You say the best things that I've ever heard
But darling I wish I was first

Don't wanna be that, wanna be that, wanna be that girl
Don't wanna feel that, wanna feel that, wanna feel that burn
But I found your ex on your Insta
Just wanted to know what you're into

And lately I keep on checking her page, yeah
I don't even know why
Comparing her to me
I don't wanna see these pictures of her
It's driving me crazy
She's kinda cool, she's amazing
She got me thinking why
Why you and me?
Are you gonna leave?
These pictures of her
Why'd you make her your ex, your ex, your ex?
Tell me am I next, I'm next, I'm next?
Was it just good sex, good sex, good sex?
Why'd you make her your ex?

Had your baby girl
Said forever, I mean, every word
Never argued your heart's made of gold
Darling my heart has been stole

Don't wanna be that, wanna be that, wanna be that girl
Don't wanna feel that, wanna feel that, wanna feel that burn
But I found your ex on your Insta
Just wanted to know what you're into

And lately I keep on checking her page, yeah
I don't even know why
Comparing her to me
I don't wanna see these pictures of her
It's driving me crazy
She's kinda cool, she's amazing
She got me thinking why
Why you and me?
Are you gonna leave?
These pictures of her
Why'd you make her your ex, your ex, your ex?
Tell me am I next, I'm next, I'm next?
Was it just good sex, good sex, good sex?
Why'd you make her your ex?

Everyone can see
You got eyes for me
I'm just crazy
It's not you, it's me
I know truthfully
I'm your baby

But lately I keep on checking her page, yeah
I don't even know why
Comparing her to me
I don't wanna see these pictures of her
It's driving me crazy
She's kinda cool, she's amazing
She got me thinking why
Why you and me?
Are you gonna leave?
These pictures of her
Why'd you make her your ex, your ex, your ex?
Tell me am I next, I'm next, I'm next?
Was it just good sex, good sex, good sex?
Why'd you make her your ex?
