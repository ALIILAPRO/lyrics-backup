		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want to have the same last dream again,
The one where I wake up and I'm alive.
Just as the four walls close me within,
My eyes are woken up with pure sunlight.
I'm the first to know.
My dearest friends, 
Even if your hope has burned with time,
Anything that's dead shall be re-grown.
And your vicious pain, your warning sign,
You will be fine.

Hey Ohh, here I am
And here we go, life's waiting to begin.

Any type of love, it will be shown,
Like every single tree reached for the sky.
If you're gonna fall, I'll let you know
That I will pick you up, like you for I.
I felt this thing, I can't replace,
Where everyone was working for this goal.
Where all the children left without a trace,
Only to come back, as pure as gold,
To recite this all?

Hey ohh, here I am
And here we go, life's waiting to begin,
Tonight.
Hey ohh, here I am
And here we go, life's waiting to begin,
Tonight.
Hello, here I am
And here we go, life's waiting to begin.

I cannot live, I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me.
I cannot live, I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me.
I cannot live, I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me.
I cannot live, I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me.
I cannot live, I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me.
I cannot live, I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me.

Hey ohh,
Here I am (Do this with me)
And here we go, life's waiting to begin.
(Do this with me)

Hey ohh,
Here I am (Do this with me)
And here we go, life's waiting to begin.
Life's waiting to begin.
