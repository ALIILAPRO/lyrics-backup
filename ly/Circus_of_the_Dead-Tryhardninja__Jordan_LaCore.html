		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you don't mind we would like to take a moment
To invite you to an ongoing performance
In a hall of tragedies to watch the circus of the dead
Feel the spotlight fading we can't do this alone
Need an audience so we can play out our roles
Got a front row seat that's so close it's like you're part of the show

There's a place in the dark horror stories go to hide
Buried deep underground pain and torment mechanized
Whoa on a lit up stage
Whoa terror's on display
There's a place in the dark horror stories go to hide
Buried deep underground pain and torment mechanized
Whoa on a lit up stage
Terror's on display

The show must go on
Hit the lights we're going till there's no pulse left
This masquerade of souls
Needs a victim
Won't you be our hopeless guest
But if it helps you can pretend
It's make believe inside your head
This nightmare's as real as it gets
In the circus of the
In the circus of the
In the circus of the dead

Good you got here just in time you better hurry
It's our show but you're the star destined for glory
Here performing death defying acts that we can't wait to see
Body count high as the tight rope will you make it
Zero safety nets the tension is electric
Tonight you're the one that jumps through hoops
We're going off the script

There's a place in the dark horror stories go to hide
Buried deep underground pain and torment mechanized
Whoa on a lit up stage
Whoa terror's on display
There's a place in the dark horror stories go to hide
Buried deep underground, pain and torment mechanized
Whoa on a lit up stage
Terror's on display

The show must go on
Hit the lights we're going till there's no pulse left
This masquerade of souls
Needs a victim
Won't you be our hopeless guest
But if it helps you can pretend
It's make believe inside your head
This nightmare's as real as it gets
In the circus of the
In the circus of the
In the circus of the dead

It's where fear comes to life
Know you never stood a chance
As you gasp for breath
(Here on the stage)
You can run you can hide
Feel the cold steel on your hands
Crawling to your death
(There's no escape)
It's a spectacle that drags down you six feet below
So you should have stayed and just enjoyed some time at home
Encore now the ringmaster comes for you
It's the grand finale it'll all be over soon

In the circus of the
In the circus of the
In the circus of
In the circus of the
In the circus of the
In the circus of the dead

It's make believe inside your head
This nightmare's as real as it gets
In the circus of the
In the circus of the
In the circus of the dead
