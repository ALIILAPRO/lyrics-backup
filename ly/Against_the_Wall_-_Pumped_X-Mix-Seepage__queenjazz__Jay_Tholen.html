		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Keep me alive
When my back's against the wall
And I can't make it out 
Of here without you
Give me a sign
That you can come collect 
My bones and all
Cause we ain't got no chance at all

First Hit
Feeling oppression of presence
Of swarms of drones
Follow you home
The Sirens the streets
The system heartbeat
Surveillance, controlling me
Third Hit
Is the underground battle of tension
Told on a whisper, no mention
You can't even compete with concrete
Delete deplete push back from a elite

We can't do
What we want
Walls closing in on us
No chance to get away
They're closing in
