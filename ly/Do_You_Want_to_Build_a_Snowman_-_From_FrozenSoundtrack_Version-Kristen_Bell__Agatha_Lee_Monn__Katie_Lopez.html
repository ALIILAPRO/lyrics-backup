		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Elsa?
Do you wanna build a snowman?
Come on, let's go and play
I never see you anymore
Come out the door
It's like you've gone away

We used to be best buddies
And now we're not
I wish you would tell me why

Do you wanna build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman

Go away, Anna

Okay, bye

Do you wanna build a snowman?
Or ride our bike around the halls?
I think some company is overdue
I've started talking to
The pictures on the walls

Hang in there, Joan

It gets a little lonely
All these empty rooms
Just watching the hours tick by

Elsa? Please, I know you're in there
People are asking where you've been
They say, "Have courage," and I'm trying to
I'm right out here for you
Just let me in

We only have each other
It's just you and me
What are we gonna do?

Do you wanna build a snowman?
