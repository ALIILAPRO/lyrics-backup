		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuck that
Die young where the rest at
Send it through the fucking hellcat
Mask up pussy all black
Heard you put a fuckin' bag on me
Ain't nobody killed me yet
All you fuckin' look the same to me
Bitch you ain't what you claim to be
I don't do paper with pussies
I'd be dead if I ain't in a hoodie but look where the pain 'boutta put me
Fuck a check if ima die wit it
Ima kill 'em outside wit it
Been ready come try me bitch
Call flex he gon' slide wit it
You all bitch made die lil' bitch
I ain't 'boutta pay shit
Ima fuck it up till I made it
Give a fuck who you said that you came wit
All the blood spill when I came in
Got my own blood in my management
I kill 'em all 'for I settle shit
Put me through hell, what I did with it
What I did with it
Fuck that
Die young where the rest at
Send it through the fucking hellcat
Mask up pussy all black
Heard you put a fuckin' bag on me
Ain't nobody killed me yet
All you fuckin' look the same to me
Bitch you ain't what you claim to be
Fuck that
Die young where the rest at
Send it through the fucking hellcat
Mask up pussy all black
Heard you put a fuckin' bag on me
Ain't nobody killed me yet
All you fuckin' look the same to me
Bitch you ain't what you claim to be
