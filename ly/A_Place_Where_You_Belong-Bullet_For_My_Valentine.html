		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're gone!
You're gone!

Your body's cold
Hope is lost, I can't let go
Can I die with you,
So we can never grow old?

Cut the ties (Cut the ties)
With this note you left behind
As I heed the words I hear you telling me why

Too late, too late
I never said goodbye
Too late, too late
Can't even ask you why
And now I'm wasting away
In my own misery
I hope you've finally gone,
To a place where you belong

My sadness shows,
As your name is carved in stone
Can't erase the words so the reality grows

I wish I died (I wish I died)
On that night right by your side
So just kill me now and let the good times roll

Too late, too late
I never said goodbye
Too late, too late
Can't even ask you why
And now I'm wasting away
In my own misery
I hope you've finally gone
To a place where you belong

Will you wait for me? (Will you wait for me?)
Will I see you on the other side?
You won't have to wait too long
Yeah

Will you come to me? (Will you come to me?)
Will you take me to the other side?
'Cause here I don't belong

Too late, too late
I never said goodbye
Too late, too late
Can't even ask you why
And now I'm wasting away
In my own misery
I hope you've finally gone
To a place where you belong

I never said goodbye
Can't even ask you why
I'm wasting
Away in my own misery
I hope you've finally gone
To a place where you belong
