		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We are no one
We are the no one, oh
We are no one
We are the no one, oh
And I love the fever and vibe
And I love the fever and vibe
On the way up on now
On the way up on now

Always keep our love inside
'Cause what we're afraid to say, we hide
Living in a place we call regret
And we haven't found our way out yet

We've got to get there somehow
We've got to get there somehow
We've got to get there somehow
We've got to get there somehow

We are no one
We are the no one, oh
We are no one
We are the no one, oh
And I love the fever and vibe
And I love the fever and vibe
On the way up on now
On the way up on now

Talking through the door that's closed
I wanna say the words that no one knows
All the little things we can't forget
And we haven't found our way out yet

We've got to get there somehow
We've got to get there somehow
We've got to get there somehow
We've got to get there somehow
We've got to get there somehow
We've got to get there somehow
We've got to get there somehow
We've got to get there somehow

We are no one
We are the no one, oh
We are no one
We are the no one, oh
And I love the fever and vibe
And I love the fever and vibe
On the way up on now
On the way up on now
We are no one
We are the no one, oh
We are no one
We are the no one, oh
And I love the fever and vibe
And I love the fever and vibe
On the way up on now
On the way up on now
