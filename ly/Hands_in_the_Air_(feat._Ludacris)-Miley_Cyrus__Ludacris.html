		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me see your hands in the air

I remember dreaming bout
The things I do right now
Late I find on to a cloud
Scared to look back down
I remember when
I was all alone
Nobody round
To hold me down
But now you're here with me tonight
Look at what you found
I was lonely for some time
Now it's only you and I
I won't leave without your love tonight, tonight

I'm dancing
To the sound
My world's in the clouds
Too high to come down
So let me see your hands in the air
Let me see your hands in the air
Let me see your hands in the air

It's go hard or go home and it ain't no lookin' back
My toughest enemy's is in the mirror, would you look at that?
I'm top five, dead or alive, one of the best to rhyme
And if I ever take a seat I stood the test of times
Every verse, every song, every feature I was on
Better know that I abused it
If I die before my time I'll still be living through my music
I cracked the industry open but still got this s*** on lock
Even on the highway up to heaven Luda still would be on top

I'm dancing
To the sound
My world's in the clouds
Too high to come down
So let me see your hands in the air
Let me see your hands in the air
Let me see your hands in the air

Whoa whoa whoa
Ooh

Whoa whoa whoa
Ooh

Whoa whoa whoa
Ooh

Whoa whoa whoa
Ooh

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ooh

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ooh

I'm dancing
To the sound
My world's in the clouds
Too high to come down
So let me see your hands in the air
Let me see your hands in the air
Let me see your hands in the air
