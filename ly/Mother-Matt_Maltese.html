		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna make a big scene
I just need a moment lying on this street
If your lungs stop, you die
If you lose love, that's life
What a blue sky

All my friends, they miss you a lot
I know your father probably hates my guts
When a lover cuts ties
Other people get caught
In the crossfire

And yesterday I told my mother
You'll learn to love again, I know she was the daughter
You never had, and I know sometimes you might miss her
But I know the years can heal, and if there is another
Maybe you'll love them in the same way you loved her

Tuesday with your wet hair in curls
Wearing pajamas in the outside world
Couldn't look in your eyes
Then you got in your car
And started to drive

And yesterday I told my mother
You'll learn to love again, I know she was the daughter
You never had, and I know sometimes you might miss her
But I know the years can heal, and if there is another
Maybe you'll love them in the same way you loved her

And tomorrow, I'll say 
"Mother, you'll learn to love again, I know you wanna write her
You never thought you'd grow a blood bond to another
You didn't birth, but that's the joy of human nature
Some people stumble into your heart for all time"
