		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Face numb, hands cold
It's reeking of blood
Two holes in my shirt
People screaming a lot
Red, red fills my lungs
Making breathing so tough
World's on hold
Please god, am I -
Let's go
Face numb, hands cold
It's reeking of blood
Two holes in my shirt
People screaming a lot
Red, red fills my lungs
Making breathing so tough
World's on hold
Please god, am I -
Face numb, hands cold
It's reeking of blood
Two holes in my shirt
People screaming a lot
Red, red fills my lungs
Making breathing so tough
World's on hold
Please god, am I dreaming?
It's 09, mum couldn't keep me in line
So she gave me away, I didn't get it
now I know she was right
I swear it's fine
Wanting turned into stealing
Dumb kids into family
Drugs into feelings
One
Day I saw my friend get a beating
Jump in, adrenaline seems so appealing
I
I hurt his pride, anger in his eyes
One dull hit to my ribs and one to the side
He starts fucking running and I?
Face numb, hands cold
It's reeking of blood
Two holes in my shirt
People screaming a lot
Red, red fills my lungs
Making breathing so tough
World's on hold
Please god, am I -
Face numb, hands cold
It's reeking of blood
Two holes in my shirt
People screaming a lot
Red, red fills my lungs
Making breathing so tough
World's on hold
Please god, am I dreaming?
It's 999
I see my father cry
Only time I did before was
When he went to jail and
We said goodbye
Now I got tubes in my body, keeping me alive
Anxiety that kicks in when I go outside
A scar on my ribs and one on my side
Pain in my lungs 'cause I
Face numb, hands cold
It's reeking of blood
Two holes in my shirt
People screaming a lot
Red, red fills my lungs
Making breathing so tough
World's on hold
Please god, am I -
Face numb, hands cold
It's reeking of blood
Two holes in my shirt
People screaming a lot
Red, red fills my lungs
Making breathing so tough
World's on hold
Please god, am I dreaming?
