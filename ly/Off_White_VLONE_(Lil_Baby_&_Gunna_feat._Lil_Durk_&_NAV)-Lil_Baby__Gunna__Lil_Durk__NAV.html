		<p>
		  Run that back Turbo

Shoppin' spree for fun, she dig Saint Laurent (uh)
Alexander, Laurent (yah), private flight to Milan ('Lan)
Ice VV's (ice, ice), ice VS1's (VS)
Off-White Vlone 1's, foreigns parked on my lawn
Them 40's come we jump, I like my bitches blonde
Wockhardt gimme the runs, don't none of my hoes wear Uggs
If you go on a hit you can't call off
Name hold weight you can't raw dog
Off Perks and X, can't nod off
If I call you the plug, can't fall off

Coupe from outer space (tshh), trust me I'm okay
Bought Hi-Tech paid by the case (by the case)
You could tell that's Chanel by the lace (Chanel)
You could tell it's a bale by the weight (by the weight)
Gazelle, you could see I got cake (got cake)
I'm a young boss, I could cut a nigga pay (cut)
Smash, I don't never use the brakes

She ask me for cash, is you serious?
New car Fast and the Furious
Spend a big bag on Amiris
I got a big bag, that's period
My name hold weight I'm superior
Took her to Gucci I'm serious
Gotta suck dick on your period
You can't say no I ain't hearin' it

Shoppin' spree for fun, she dig Saint Laurent (uh)
Alexander, Laurent (yah), private flight to Milan ('Lan)
Ice VV's (ice, ice), ice VS1's (VS)
Off-White Vlone 1's, foreigns parked on my lawn
Them 40's come we jump, I like my bitches blonde
Wockhardt gimme the runs, don't none of my hoes wear Uggs
If you go on a hit you can't call off
Name hold weight you can't raw dog
Off Perks and X, can't nod off
If I call you the plug, can't fall off (Baby)

Drippin' all in France (France), shoppin' when we land
Made a stop in Punta Cana, shawty keep her body tan
Went to Magic last week, we probably fucked up 40 bands
Get'em flipped I really can, bitch I'm the shit hoe, fuck your man
In Dior they call me Mr. Baby, they know who I am
BB belt hold up my pants, Louis pouch hold the FN
Big Balenci's, I don't care for fashion, do it 'cause I can
Vlone Forgiato rims, white T-shirt, Amiri Timbs, yeah

Shoppin' spree for fun, she dig Saint Laurent (uh)
Alexander, Laurent (yah), private flight to Milan ('Lan)
Ice VV's (ice, ice), ice VS1's (VS)
Off-White Vlone 1's, foreigns parked on my lawn

Spent six hunnid eatin' lunch, got tired of Honey Buns
Smokin' by the ton, give a fuck about my lungs
She suck me sloppy (yeah), put my lil' babies on her tongue
In the hotel lobby (yeah), got a Glock on me with a drum (yeah)
Half a mil' in jewelry, got a quarter in my safe (yeah)
She don't ask me nothin' (yeah), put my main bitch in her place (yeah)
Take her shoppin' I got good taste (good taste), I approve her fit of the day
You ain't goin out like that, no way (no), I drip too hard every day (drip)

Shoppin' spree for fun, she dig Saint Laurent (uh)
Alexander, Laurent (yah), private flight to Milan ('Lan)
Ice VV's (ice, ice), ice VS1's (VS)
Off-White Vlone 1's, foreigns parked on my lawn
Them 40's come we jump, I like my bitches blonde
Wockhardt gimme the runs, don't none of my hoes wear Uggs
If you go on a hit you can't call off
Name hold weight you can't raw dog
Off Perks and X, can't nod off
If I call you the plug, can't fall off
