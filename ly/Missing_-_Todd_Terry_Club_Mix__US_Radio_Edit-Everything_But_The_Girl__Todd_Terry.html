		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I step off the train 
I'm walkin' down your street again
And past your door 
But you don't live there anymore
It's years since you've been there
And now you've disappeared somewhere
Like outer space 
You've found some better place

And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, oh
Like the deserts miss the rain

And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain

Back on the train 
I ask why did I come again
Can I confess 
I've been hangin' 'round your old address?
And the years have proved 
To offer nothin' since you moved
You're long gone 
But I can't move on

And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain

I step off the train 
I'm walkin' down your street again
Past your door
I guess you don't live there anymore
It's years since you've been there
And now you've disappeared somewhere
Like outer space 
You've found some better place

And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, yeah
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, and I miss you
