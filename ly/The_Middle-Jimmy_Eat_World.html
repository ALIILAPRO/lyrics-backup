		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey
Don't write yourself off yet
It's only in your head you feel left out or looked down on
Just try your best
Try everything you can
And don't you worry what they tell themselves when you're away

It just takes some time
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alright, alright

Hey
You know they're all the same
You know you're doing better on your own so don't buy in
Live right now
Yeah, just be yourself
It doesn't matter if it's good enough for someone else

It just takes some time
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alright, alright

It just takes some time
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alright, alright

Hey
Don't write yourself off yet
It's only in your head you feel left out 
Or looked down on
Just do your best
Do everything you can
And don't you worry what their bitter hearts are gonna say

It just takes some time
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alright, alright

It just takes some time
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alright
