		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I was waking up 
When she was getting home 
I guess she got tired of going all alone
Every Sunday second service
My excuse was I hate churches
But the truth is I was still drunk from the Saturday night before 
But it sure don't matter no more

She left me for all of the right reasons
She left me a new King James and said to read it
And it looks like He's the only one that will forgive my sins
So I ain't mad at Jesus
Even though she left me for Him 

Her mama raised her right
Like my daddy, I raise hell
I was dimming down her light
So she had to save herself
Now I'm reading red letter verses how could I be mad at her 

She left me for all of the right reasons
She left me a new King James and said to read it
And it looks like He's the only one that will forgive my sins
So I ain't mad at Jesus
Even though she left me 
For the Lord and savior
The same one that saved her
But I don't thank him for stepping in between us 
But I ain't mad at Jesus 

She left me for all of the right reasons
She left me a new King James and said to read it
And it looks like He's the only one that will forgive my sins 
So I ain't mad at Jesus
Even though she left me for Him
Well, I ain't mad at Jesus
