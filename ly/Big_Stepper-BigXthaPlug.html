		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Aye, aye

Aye big X, Big Stepper
Cut off my bitch, she was being too extra
The opps on my line screaming
How they gon' stretch me
But they stay in their
Place, 'cause this shit, it get hectic
More bodies we drop at the
Bed of their dresser
I be quick to throw hands
But we stay with them Wessons
Glocks, canes, yeah, we with the extras
Think I was 6 when they said I was pressure

Been chillin' and shit
But they know I'm a stepper
600 block yeah you know I'm a repper
They crossing that line
I been waiting to stretch em
Send em to God if you play with my necklace
Taliban gang and you know that we wreckin'
We be getting the bricks by the L
Like Tetris
Big booty bitch giving head in a Lexus
Ironic, I think that hoe name was Alexis
Slamming them P's on the table like wrestlin'
Yo hoe wanna fuck 'cause she
Like how I'm dressin' she say
"When I smile and I shine it's a blessin'"
Bet she be on my dick when
I ice out my necklace
I hang with the killas
We straight out of texas
8 in a sprite, got it looking like Pepsi
Feds on my ass
Tell them boys to come catch me
These racks on my head
But I bet they won't test me

Call up my phone
Like it's bills they collectin'
BigXthaPlug only known for the steppin'
Big nigga solid but I stay with a weapon
I'm stiff than a bitch
Beat a nigga like Tekken

Call up my phone
Like it's bills they collectin'
BigXthaPlug only known for the steppin'
Big nigga solid, but stay with a weapon
I'm stiff than a bitch
Beat a nigga like Tekken

Aye big X, Big Stepper
Cut off my bitch she was being too extra
The opps on line screaming how
They gon' stretch me but they stay in their
Place, 'cause this shit, it get hectic
More bodies we drop at the
Bed of their dresser
I be quick to throw hands
But we stay with them Wessons
Glocks, canes, yeah, we with the extras
Think I was 6 when they said I was pressure

Aye
