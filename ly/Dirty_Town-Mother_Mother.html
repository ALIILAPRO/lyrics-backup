		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't like livin' in a dirty town
Don't like livin' in a dirty town
I don't like livin' in a dirty town
'Cause a dirty town gets me down

I saved up and I bought some land
'Cause I can't stand livin' in a dirty town
Yeah, I pinched my pennies and I put 'em down
And I washed my hands of a dirty town
Plant my seeds in the ground
Yeah, I put 'em down in my newfound land
'Cause you can't plant seeds in a dirty town
No, you can't plant seeds in a dirty town

I'm choppin' firewood, choppin' firewood
Chop, chop, chop
Just like a country boy should be chopping wood
I country
My kindling sticks are the perfect little width
Kindling sticks

Get gone from a dirty town
Get gone from a dirty town
Everybody now
Get gone from a dirty town
Get gone from a dirty town
(Oh-oh-oh)
A-a-a-all I need is a chicken wire and a chicken feed
And a-a-a-a-all I see is a newfound land fertility, yeah

My lady friend, oh, she don't need to pretend
She country
She cracks the crack of dawn with her crackin' whip
Crackity
We having fun just makin' little chillun
Ch-chillin'

Get gone from a dirty town
Get gone from a dirty town
Get gone from a dirty town
Get gone from a dirty town
Get gone from a dirty town
Get gone from a dirty town
Get gone from a dirty town
Get gone from a dirty town
Get gone from a dirty town
Get gone from a dirty town 
From a dirty town

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my

My government, aw, he ain't made of cement
He country
We get along singing good ol' country songs
Ol' Guthrie
My bank account is a shoe box in the ground
And empty

Get gone from a dirty town
Get gone from a dirty town
Get gone from a dirty town
Get gone from a dirty town (dirty)
Get gone from a dirty town (town)
Get gone from a dirty town (dirty town)
Get gone from a dirty town (dirty town)
Get gone from a dirty town (dirty)
Get gone from a dirty town (town, town)
