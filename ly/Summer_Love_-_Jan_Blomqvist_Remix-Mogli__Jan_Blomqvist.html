		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got that summer love
But for a lifetime
I've got that summer love
But for a lifetime

You said you love me
Stop dragging me down
I'm not your mirror
So let me go

How come Berlin's so damn grey but I love it anyway
I don't miss your jealous ways
You had the last word
But I've got summer love

I've got that summer love
But for a lifetime
I've got that summer love
But for a lifetime

I understand now
You never showed up when I was hurt
I'm not just over it
I'm happier

How come Berlin's so damn grey but I love it anyway
I don't miss your jealous ways
You had the last word
But I've got summer love

I've got that summer love
But for a lifetime
You think you're so fine
But honey, I'm fine
How come Berlin's so damn grey but I love it anyway
I don't miss your jealous ways
You had the last word
But I've got summer love

With all your second guessing and all your bitterness
And all the heavy drinking
I think I've had it
I think I've had it now

Summer love
For a lifetime
Summer love
Honey, I'm fine
