		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been staring at the coastline
Thinking of every choice I've made
To lead me here right now
Standing on solid ground
And I've been hiding in the shadows
Wondering if I'm on the right road
Some place I've never been
Is this how it all begins? Oh

'Cause I've got my best suit on and I'm ready
I've got my sleeves rolled up
And I'll be on my way
While my heart's thumping, pum-pum, pum-pum

You're gonna see me rise
Oh, and rise, rise, rise, rise

For every valley, there's a mountain
For every answer, there's a new question
Is it worth all this
Pushing myself to the edge?
'Cause we're all looking for a reason
Find a shelter from the storm within
Just keep your eyes ahead
And dust yourself off again, oh

'Cause I've got my best suit on and I'm ready
I've got my sleeves rolled up
And I'll be on my way
While my heart's thumping, pum-pum, pum-pum

You're gonna see me rise
Oh, and rise, rise, rise, rise, oh

'Cause I've got my best suit on and I'm ready
I've got my sleeves rolled up
And I'll be on my way
While my heart's thumping, pum-pum, pum-pum

You're gonna see me rise
You're gonna see me rise
Not how you fall back down
But how you get back up
Before you hit the ground

You're gonna see me rise
Oh, rise, rise, oh rise, yeah (rise, rise, rise) 

You're gonna see me rise 
(You're gonna see me, rise, rise, rise)
You're gonna see me rise
