		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In here a tale of a
Boy who reached the masses
His name was Billy and he liked to get high
A normal guy until the green-skin apocalypse
A do or die

There must be something in the water
(Besides fluoride and shit) Where he lie
Where he lie he threw that gaping brain
Asunder when he realized, when he realized
It's coming down

We've sown thrones and brought the
Kings down to knees
Hello, here we are, salutations
And every day that you wake is a
Gift that you take from the gods
That's right you came from the trees and
We altered the genes
Here you are, all you fuck with is wages
You had the day but you pissed it away
I think it's time that we show our ways

Now we shed that violence all over
Let mayhem in the streets
From the mountaintop to oceans
We own your every need it's coming down
With every breath that we take
We can hear that sound
Somebody needs a reaction to
Stay on the ground
With every breath that we take
We can hear that sound
A green-skin apocalypse a do or die

So Billy heeds the call of fathers
Release high through these eyes

Embraces the chi and he praises the weeds
Holding out for the day he can face them
And every day that he trains is a
Slap in the face to the gods goddamn
Shutting out politics
Viewing beings as equals
Ain't it funny how that makes sense?
You had the floor, but you gave it a bore
Now it's equal can we clean that slate?

Now shed that violence all over
Let mayhem in the streets
From mountain top to oceans
We own your every need it's coming down
Somebody needs a reaction to
Stay on the ground it's coming down

Follow a trail of the ones
Who bleed the masses
Follow behind the reptilian eyes
A normal day in the green-skin apocalypse
A do or die there must be something in the
Water where he lie, where he lie
He threw that gaping brain asunder
When he realized, when he realized

National alliance and he leads the fight
No class, no race
Just fucking violence in their eyes
A plan for human survival takes to flight
The good that's left and all
We cherish stands to die

Is this the end of all we know?
They all float
Is this the end of all we know?
Wasted our lives for what?

Float away do we feed the reaction?
Do we stay? Do we all float away?

Do you think you know who you are?
Did you think you had it all worked out well?
And who could believe
Those dead-eyed soldiers? Red sky rainfall
The winter beams no beauty
Just cold-eyed monsters and bare branches
You can wail to the moon
But that'll just make things worse
They see you they see me
They see all

No children in the streets
Where do they play when freedom
Here has been revoked?
The ground which all their fathers soaked
No medicine
The scarcity of nourishment is evident

And where's our god?
Have we seen that side of heaven yet? No
Rich, poor
Clutching to their sheets in horror
Is there an answer?
Is there somebody who can take
Away all the present dismay? Bury the light
Pray through night mayhem in the streets
No order is there an answer?
Is there somebody who can take
Away all the present dismay? Bury the light
Pray through night

You've buried that, buried that light
Now pray through night
What has come down is littered
All around in your sight
It's littered in your sight

The claim they stake
A land from us they take
The claim they stake (They stake)
A land from us they take (They take)
The craft he shakes a race within his wake
Victory alone became his above
The soil we know a grave is laid
A man within it's cage
Victory alone became his down in
The soil he owns

(Soil we know becomes our own home)
Soil we know becomes our own home
Now we're staring at the ground together
This is not the first time or the last time
(Soil we know becomes our own home
Now we're staring at the ground together)
Now we're staring at the ground together

Soil we own becomes ours
Order back in what we know
Soil we own becomes ours
Now one with the soil we own
Soil we own becomes ours
Order back in what we know
Soil we own becomes ours
Now one with the soil we own (Soil we own)
