		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, three, four
Ha ha
Na-na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na, na

I trade the whip out for a bike, uh
Designer for some Nikes
Switch the stripper for a wife
Black tie for a white tee, uh
I've been moving lightspeed, lightspeed, lightspeed, lightspeed
Lightspeed, lightspeed, lightspeed, lightspeed

Look, I don't wanna try
Keep it cool like iced tea
So if I seem shy
It's 'cause you seem so shiesty
Sellin' what you buy, buy, buy
Just a product of the '90s
If you close your eyes
That's where you'll find me

I'm the devil's advocate
You don't know the half of it
Good luck tryna manage it
If a God is a dog, and a man is a fraud
Then I'm a lost cause

22s on the ride (ride)
Bring me back a five piece (five)
Same ticket for the rent, yeah
But I split it with a dime piece
Married to my friends
They don't always like me
I stay together for the kids, uh
I gotta do the right thing

I'm the devil's advocate
You don't know the half of it
Good luck tryna manage it
If a God is a dog, and a man is a fraud
Then I'm a lost cause
