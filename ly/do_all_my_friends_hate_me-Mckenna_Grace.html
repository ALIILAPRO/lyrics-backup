		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought you would stay for while
Thought I'd be okay for a while
I counted the days to respond
All the ways to respond to you

Did I already tell you that joke?
'Cause you already know how it goes
I feel like I'm talking too much
Or I don't say enough, oh

I guess I'm annoying
Sitting at home in
My paranoia
But I really adore ya, oh

Sometimes I feel like I'm crazy
Like all my friends hate me
Overthinking alone
No one picks up their phone
My anxiety tells me
That you're better without me
Now I'm crying alone
No one picks up their phone

So somebody save me, save me, save me
Do all my friends hate me, hate me, hate me?
I don't know, I don't know

I'm watching those tiny bubbles
Dancing beneath your name
I wish you would answer already
My hand's kinda shaky, yeah

I guess I'm annoying
Sitting at home in
My paranoia
But I really adore ya, oh, oh

Sometimes I feel like I'm crazy
Like all my friends hate me
Overthinking alone
No one picks up their phone
My anxiety tells me
That you're better without me
Now I'm crying alone
No one picks up their phone

So somebody save me, save me, save me
Do all my friends hate me, hate me, hate me?
I don't know, I don't know

I don't, I don't know
I don't, I don't know
I don't, I don't know

Am I just going crazy?
Feels like all my friends hate me
Overthinking alone
No one picks up their phone
