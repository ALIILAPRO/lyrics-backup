		  Hey kkahso this the one right here
Big Checks, Drip Check, I don't do the disrespect
Calling on the most high cuz I had a disconnect
Ima get the most high when I read the word later
Then I'm getting all my needs met cuz he's a way maker
Uh yea yea yea, Way Maker
Yea yea yea yea, Way Maker
Aye My god is a Way Maker
Yea yea yea, Way Maker
I get money while I'm deep in sleep
My fathers a provider (Jireh)
I don't gamble cuz I play for keeps
I won't see the fire
Drip on me and it look like favor
Salvation won't cheap (Cha-ching)
I get seri (Serious) when I talk bout JC (Jesus Christ) cuz he died for me
These demons fear me cuz the one who made me popped up on the scene
I got reasons and they fit the seasons summer through the spring
What you speaking might just be the reason you can't get some things
What you thinking?
Tell me is it pleasing to the king of kings?
Yea yea yea yea yea got a lot of money in the safe
But that don't matter if I never have the faith yea yea yea
I know that my God gone make a way
Yea yea yea I know that my god gone make a way
Big Checks, Drip Check, I don't do the disrespect
Calling on the most high cuz I had a disconnect
Ima get the most high when I read the word later
Then I'm getting all my needs met cuz he's a way maker
Uh yea yea yea, Way Maker
Yea yea yea yea, Way Maker
Aye My god is a Way Maker
Yea yea yea, Way Maker
Aye prophet to his people gotta lead them out
I need direction calling my father I had to seek him out
Devil be scheming devil be lurking I had to bob and weave
Stay in the field God is the coach I let him take the lead
That's right dipped in the water got baptized
I got the victory devil he envy me I told the devil it's nap time
Wait hold up wait aye Egypt to the promise and we on now
Loving all my brothers and we sticking to the code now
Ya'll say God is good but I say that he's great
I remember in the dark when I saw his face
And his glory filled my life so I'm not the same
And I'm grateful that the Lord really made a way
Big Checks, Drip Check, I don't do the disrespect
Calling on the most high cuz I had a disconnect
Ima get the most high when I read the word later
Then I'm getting all my needs met cuz he's a way maker
Uh yea yea yea, Way Maker
Yea yea yea yea, Way Maker
Aye My god is a Way Maker
Yea yea yea, Way Maker
