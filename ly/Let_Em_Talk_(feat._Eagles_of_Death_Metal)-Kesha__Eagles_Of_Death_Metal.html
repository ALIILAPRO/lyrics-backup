		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You, you got your own opinions
But baby, I don't even need to hear 'em
It used to hurt me, used to bring me down
Do your worst, 'cause nothing's gonna stop me now

Don't let those losers take your magic, baby, yeah

Shake that ass, don't care if they talk about it
Fuck all that, haters, just forget about 'em
(Woah) Just let 'em talk about it
(Woah) Just let 'em talk about it
Do your thing, don't care if you make 'em jealous
We're the kings, life is just our party palace
(Woah) Just let 'em talk about it
(Woah) Just let 'em talk, just let 'em talk

Do whatever makes you happy
And screw everything else if you ask me, hey yeah
'Cause life is short and we only got one shot
So let's go balls-out, give it everything we got

Don't let those losers take your magic, baby, yeah

Shake that ass, don't care if they talk about it
Fuck all that, haters, just forget about 'em
(Woah) Just let 'em talk about it
(Woah) Just let 'em talk about it
Do your thing, don't care if you make 'em jealous
We're the kings, life is just our party palace
(Woah) Just let 'em talk about it
(Woah) Just let 'em talk, just let 'em talk

Let 'em talk about it, let 'em talk about it, let 'em talk
Let them talk, just let 'em talk, just let 'em
Let 'em talk about it, let 'em talk about it, let 'em talk
Let them talk

Boys and girls, everybody talks about you
Loves and hates, they don't really know about you
I've decided all the haters everywhere can suck my dick
Un, deux, trois, four

Shake that ass, don't care if they talk about it
Fuck all that, haters, just forget about 'em
(Woah) Just let 'em talk about it
(Woah) Just let 'em talk about it
Do your thing, don't care if you make 'em jealous
We're the kings, life is just our party palace
(Woah) Just let 'em talk about it
(Woah) Just let 'em talk, just let 'em talk

Let 'em talk about it, let 'em talk about it, let 'em talk
Let them talk, just let 'em talk, just let 'em
Let 'em talk about it, let 'em talk about it, let 'em talk
Let them talk, just let 'em talk, just let 'em
Let 'em talk about it, let 'em talk about it, let 'em talk
Let them talk, just let 'em talk, just let 'em
Let 'em talk about it, let 'em talk about it, let 'em talk
Let them talk

(Ok!)
