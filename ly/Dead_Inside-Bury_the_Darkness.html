		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Crushing doubts pushing down on my chest
I feel the weight, it won't let up
Day after day, it's all the same
I'm just a slave to my fucked up brain
Ugh
I'm just a slave to my fucked up brain
There's no escape from this fucking pain
Wake me up from this nightmare
I've realized that this is no dream
I've scratched and clawed to hide the pain
All my fucked up life
You pushed me past the point of breaking
Now I'm dead inside
Twisting and turning with no way out
I've lived with pressure and anger
And now I'm breaking down
I'm fueled by hate
Welling up inside of me
It's not too late to save me from my misery
Wake me up from this nightmare
I've realized that this is no dream
I've scratched and clawed to hide the pain
All my fucked up life
You pushed me past the point of breaking
Now I'm dead inside
Nobody listened
I tried to warn them
Immoral and spineless
Just like you
Burn
Burn
Wake me up from this nightmare
I've realized that this is no dream
I've scratched and clawed to hide the pain
All my fucked up life
You pushed me past the point of breaking
Now I'm dead inside
Push and twist the knife
Hollow my insides
I feel dead inside
Why am I alive?
