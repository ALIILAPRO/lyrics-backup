		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My great grandmother was a magic weaver
Came across the water and caught the fever
Wondered if her mother could hear her when
She said the words she learned to say

In the blue camhanaich all shimmering still
Dame Calluna, low Lady of the Hills
Cup of cold sun and a winterpill
Send me back on my way
Seven black rabbits of Hy-Brasil
Twenty-one petals of daffodils
Thirteenth note of the blackcap trill
I'll fly home today

Down in the cradle oh I would hear her
As I breathed my soul believed if
I sang those words I could leave there
Leave my sorrow and pain

In the blue camhanaich all shimmering still
Dame Calluna, low Lady of the Hills
Cup of cold sun and a winterpill
Send me back on my way
Seven black rabbits of Hy-Brasil
Twenty-one petals of daffodils
Thirteenth note of the blackcap trill
I'll fly home today

Though my brittle body was caught in his snare
My soul would learn how to travel where
The eyes of the rabbits were gleaming there
On the isle of Hy-Brasil

Seven years we drown, seven years we rise
Said the black rabbit with the ancient eyes
You'll be free, oh lura lae
He cannot match your will

In the blue camhanaich all shimmering still
Dame Calluna, low Lady of the Hills
Cup of cold sun and a winterpill
Send me back on my way
Seven black rabbits of Hy-Brasil
Twenty-one petals of daffodils
Thirteenth note of the blackcap trill
I'll fly home today

Though I drowned for ten years, I'm still rising
Stronger for my pain and suffering
My body was broken but my heart's reborn
I'm freer than the sky

In the blue camhanaich all shimmering still
Dame Calluna, low Lady of the Hills
Cup of cold sun and a winterpill
Send me back on my way
Seven black rabbits of Hy-Brasil
Twenty-one petals of daffodils
Thirteenth note of the blackcap trill
I'll fly home today
