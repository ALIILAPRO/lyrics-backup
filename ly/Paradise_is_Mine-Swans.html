		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now we lay in the mud
In the sea, deep beneath
And we wait where we lay
For the light, for the seed
Of a thought, for a touch
For your breath, for your love
To begin, to unfurl
To create a new world
In the gash, in the break
In this place, you animate
Come to us, penetrate
Come to us, animate
Come to us, from the muck
Learn to speak, learn to fuck
Tongues are trained, fingers reach
Come to us, on the beach
Awake, awake
Awake, to sleep
Awake, awake
Awake, to sleep

Is there really a mind?
Is there really a mind? (Ah)
Is there really a mind? (Ah)
Is there really a mind? (Ah)
Is there really a mind? (Mind)
Is there really a mind? (Mind)
Is there really a mind? (Mind)
(Mind, mind, mind, mind)
Is it mine? (Mind, mind)
It is mine (Mind, mind)
Is it mine? (Mind, mind)
Mine (mind)
(Mind, mind)
Am I ready to die? (Mind)
Am I ready to die? (Mind)
Am I ready to die? (Mind)
Am I ready to die? (Mind)
Am I ready to die? (Mind)
Am I ready to die? (Mind)
Is there really a mind? (Mind)
Is there really a mind? (Mind)
Is there really a mind? (Mind)

Paint the time on my eye
It is real, it is mine
This is mine
This is mine
This is mine
Mine
