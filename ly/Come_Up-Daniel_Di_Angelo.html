		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Run up
My bitch on the come up she know how to stunt
We might pop a pill after we smoke a blunt
These boys just be talkin', I got what you want
Music just like crack, I whip that on the pot
I moved to the beach and now I'm gettin' paid
Fuckin' on a yellow girl, like lemonade
Weed so strong I know that shit gon' get you faced
Yeah we on the come up, get out of my way
This ain't the business but I'm bringing context to the contacts to the firm
I got my hand on the draw-back, if I cock back, be concerned
If you see us in the club, go ahead and make a full turn
Flashing cameras in my face so I gotta let that kush burn
Let it burn for me, I got my girl rollin' up doobies full of keef
That ain't no stunt, that's just how it be
She's on her knees begging for more I told her "count to three, then come up"
Run up
My bitch on the come up she know how to stunt
We might pop a pill after we smoke a blunt
These boys just be talkin', I got what you want
Music just like crack, I whip that on the pot
I moved to the beach and now I'm gettin' paid
Fuckin' on a yellow girl, like lemonade
Weed so strong I know that shit gon' get you faced
Yeah we on the come up, get out of my way
Yeah yeah
I'm on the come up
Isn't it funny how now they all comin' to me
Shawty get dressed, she get done up
I am a killer, the way that I murder these beats
I always work til the sun up
Dick in her mouth, make her shut up
Sponsored by all of her favorite brands, she stay rockin' the look of the summer
Now throw it back for me, I got these girls rollin' up doobies full of keef
That ain't no stunt, that's just how it be
When you get money and make music, and you keep it real, we come up
Run up
My bitch on the come up she know how to stunt
We might pop a pill after we smoke a blunt
These boys just be talkin', I got what you want
Music just like crack, I whip that on the pot
I moved to the beach and now I'm gettin' paid
Fuckin' on a yellow girl, like lemonade
Weed so strong I know that shit gon' get you faced
Yeah we on the come up, get out of my way
