		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, hey
Damn

One foot in the club everybody watch me
One pop on the booty everybody love me
Ain't the reason, I'm cocky
I make myself feel sexy
Fanning myself, I'm stanning myself
I love me so much I put my hands on myself
Fanning myself, I'm stanning myself
I love me so much I put my hands on myself

Man, I feel like Cleopatra
Joan Of Arc, Queen of Hearts, yeah
Tonight, it's only me that matters
Oh, you are the feminist type?
Hell yeah, I am!

I don't need a man
If I'm loving you, it's 'cause I can ('cause I can)
I don't want your cash
I put my own rock on my hand (woo)
I put my own rock on my hand (woo)
I put my own rock on my hand
I don't need a man
If I'm loving you, it's 'cause I can

Make way for the G-O double D, E-S-S
I spare no enemies in this dress
Uh-huh, uh-huh
I make myself feel sexy
Fanning myself, I'm stanning myself
I love me so much I put my hands on myself
Fanning myself, I'm stanning myself
I love me so much can't keep my hands off myself

Man, I feel like Cleopatra
Joan Of Arc, Queen of Hearts, yeah
Tonight, it's only me that matters
Oh, you are the feminist type?
Hell yeah, I am!

I don't need a man (need a man)
If I'm loving you, it's 'cause I can ('cause I can)
I don't want your cash (uh, uh)
I put my own rock on my hand (woo)
I put my own rock on my hand (woo)
I put my own rock on my hand
I don't need a man (nuh-uh)
If I'm loving you, it's 'cause I can

Yeah one-one, take control
Drop your man down like you don't want him no more
Say two-two, freak the floor
Drop it so low that your thighs get sore
Say one-one, take control
Drop your man down like you don't want him no more
Say two-two, freak the floor
Drop it so low that your thighs get sore

I don't need a man (need a man)
If I'm loving you, it's 'cause I can ('cause I can)
I don't want your cash (uh, uh)
I put my own rock on my hand (woo)
I put my own rock on my hand (woo)
I put my own rock on my hand (woo)
I don't need a man (nuh-uh)
If I'm loving you, it's 'cause I can
I don't need a man
If I'm loving you is 'cause I can ('cause I can)
I don't want your cash
I put my own rock on my hand (woo)
I put my own rock on my hand (woo)
I put my own rock on my hand
I don't need a man
If I'm loving you is 'cause I can
