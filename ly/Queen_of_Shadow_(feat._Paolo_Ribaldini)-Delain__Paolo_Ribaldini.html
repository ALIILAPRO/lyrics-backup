		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Grief of yesterday (grief of yesterday)
Wrapping me so tightly in the darkness
Crowning me in flame (crowning me in flame)
Never drown

The river running in the underworld
It never drowns the queen of mourning
Embracing pain of sorrow ill-deserved
I know you will never understand it

All the chaos of your dreams
Cast it away to rule over the darkness
Shadows to enslave, under your reign

You want to get inside my head
You want to see the Queen of Shadow
Into the flood of dark you can't descend
Never drown

Bearing a light you're pushing through
Setting the shadows loose
Leave me to the undertide (to the undertide)
Never drown

All the chaos of your dreams
Cast it away to rule over the darkness
Shadows to enslave, under your reign
Never drown

All the chaos of your dreams
Cast it away to rule over the darkness
Shadows to enslave, never to escape

All the chaos of your dreams (chaos of your dream)
Cast it away to rule over the darkness
Shadows to enslave, under your reign
No-oh-whoa
