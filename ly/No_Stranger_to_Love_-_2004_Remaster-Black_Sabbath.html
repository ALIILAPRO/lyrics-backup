		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cold is the night
Lonely till dawn
Cry for the light
For the love that won't come
You said that you'd never
Leave me alone

I gave you my heart
You cried for my soul
An angel won't come
This devil won't go
Something is wrong
I just can't get away

Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love
Why can't you see I'm no stranger to love
Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love
But I'm a stranger in your arms
Yes, I'm a stranger in your arms

Maybe it's right
But I just can't understand
The hurt that I feel
For my love second hand
I know I should leave
But I just can't walk away

Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love
Why can't you see I'm no stranger to love
Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love
I'm a stranger in your arms
Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love
Why can't you see I'm no stranger to love
