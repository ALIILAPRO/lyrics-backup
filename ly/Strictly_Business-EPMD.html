		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Try to answer to the master or the MC rap God is no joke
On the lyric, its hard to be modest
I knew I was the man with the master plan
To make you wiggle and jiggle, like gelatin
Just think while I sink, into the brain structure
(don't sleep on the e) you see, something might rupture
I don't take time for me to blow your mind
Take a second to wreck it because you're dumb and blind
So just lounge, cause you're a MC clown
Go join the circus, EPMD in town

Total chaos, no mass confusion
Rhymes so hypnotizing known to cause an illusion
Like a magician, who pulls a rabbit out a hat, son
I pull them all like a .44 magnum
MC freeze stop look and listen, and try to imagine
Its traveling the speed of light, but everything's motion
Is frightening, plus the thought you alone
You now enter dimension, called the twilight zone
You're terrified, plus you cant bear the thought
You and I one-on-one, in the land of the lost
You start to shiver, but then you scream, my friend
Yo wake up muttley, because you're dreaming again
But next time I'm on the scene, do not try to diss us
Keep your mouth shut sucker duck, because I'm strictly business

This is the rap season, where the e starts pleasing
Girls around the world no need to be skeezing
When I roll I stroll, cool always pack a tool
Just in case, a brother acts a fool
Ive got the energy, to put the girls in the frenzy
Put it in shock when I rock, give it up I'm not stingy
Make sure I don't bore when I'm on the dance floor
(get busy, boy) like you never saw before
Rhyme flow, good to go, after the show, Ill pull your hoe, boy
(Yo, you sniff blow? ), hell no!
I got my whole life ahead of me, no time to be sniffing
And my parents find out, then they start riffing
So I stay, a-okay, cause I'm the e, the r-I-c-k

MC's look me in my face, then their eyes get weak
Pulse rate descends, heart rate increases
Its like beam me up, scotty, I control your body
I'm as deadly as aids when its time to rock a party
And all due respect, when I say mic check
Let a sucker slide once, then I break his neck
So when I say jump, you reply, how high?
Because I'm taking no prisoners, so don't play hero and die
Cause you're a soldier, and I'm a green beret
I do not think twice about the MC's I slay
So if you want to battle, I highly recommend this
Bring your dog, mom, and dad, because I'm strictly business

Yo yo, you're still picking on that four-leaf clover?
Bring in the sandman, sucker, because its over
My name is Erick Sermon and I'm back again
I see the heads still turning and my so-called friends
They smile in my face, behind my back they talk trash
Mad and stuff, because they don't have cash
Like the e-double, or the PMD
He drives a corvette, I drive a samurai Suzuki
I'm a locksmith, with the key to fame
Never high on myself, always stay the same
Play a lot because I'm hot, like a horse I trot
Around the track and back, fatigued? no, I'm not

Well I'm the mellow, the fellow, the one who likes to say hello
To a fly girl that is good to go
With the slow tempo, and the off-beat rhyme flow
Cause when I am in action, there is no time for maxing
Or relaxing, just subtracting and reacting
On a sucker MC who mouth keeps on yapping and flapping
I lose my cool, then Ill start slapping and smacking
You wanna roll? then Albee start jacking and capping
No time to lounge, I'm packing and strapping
At my point of attack I soar at you like an eagle
I'm the sheriff, and biting is illegal
So next time I'm in town, I highly recommend this
You gots to chill, because I'm strictly business
