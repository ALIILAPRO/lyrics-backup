		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shiny like a limousine
You're spending like a cash machine
Smile, show your golden teeth
That's how you cover up your cavities

You're glowing like a diamond ring
I saw you bought some other things
You're spending like a cash machine
To cover up your insecurities
Don't front, no need

When is it enough?
How bad do you need that stuff?
What's it all for?
Why's it seem like you still want more?

When is it enough?
Turns out you don't need that stuff
What's it all for?
Why's it seem like you still want more?

Shiny like a limousine
You're spending like a cash machine
Smile, show your golden teeth
That's how you cover up your cavities
You're not fooling us all

Someone tell me something
Shut up and take my money
I've got pockets full of gold
No, I don't know nothing

Stop acting funny
I've seen greedy people hungry
Up in swarms, I've seen them running
Coming for more

When is it enough?
How bad do you need that stuff?
What's it all for?
Why's it seem like you still want more?

When is it enough?
Turns out you don't need that stuff
What's it all for?
Why's it seem like you still want more?

Shiny like a limousine
You're spending like a cash machine
Smile, show your golden teeth
That's how you cover up your cavities
You're not fooling us all
