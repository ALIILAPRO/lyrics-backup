		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna give you anything
Somehow I deserve everything
I dreamed it since I was young
It ain't long now
bro my time has come
It's no surprise to me
Nah, feel the energy
And any boy test catch a casualty
That's why all of my friends are afraid of me
Give me space
Old friends erased
Rearrange
I need to see change
Empty plate
Familiar ache
A friendly pain
You're not my friend
Are you my friend?
I don't know
You hurt me
I think you're a foe
You play
So uniform
Beautiful
Not happy anymore
Why'd you always want more?
I need your worst
I need before
I don't wanna give you anything
Somehow I deserve everything
I dreamed it since I was young
It ain't long now
bro, my time has come
It's no surprise to me (surprise)
Nah I feel the energy
And any boy test catch a casualty
That's why all of my friends are afraid of me
You only count my steps
Or praise the grave I've kept
Why can't I tell?
Delusions reign like a fascist
I can tell
I see past your smile
You're from hell
(My skin, my skin)
(my skin, my skin)
A masquerade
Where you turned up late
They can't see your excuses
Run down your face
Nah
One foot in the grave
Alone you'll lay
Promise me something
To give me nothing
Are you my friend?
I don't know
You hurt me
I think you're a foe
Are you my friend?
I don't know
You hurt me
I think you're a foe
Are you my friend?
I don't know
You hurt me
I think you're a foe
Are you my friend?
I don't know
You hurt me
I think you're a foe
