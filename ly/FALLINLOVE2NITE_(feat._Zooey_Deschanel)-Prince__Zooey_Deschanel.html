		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't, don't you wanna
Fall in love tonight
She said, don't, don't you wanna
Fall in love tonight

Special night, my favorite crew
The moon threatened to dance her out of her shoes
In his ear, he was about to hear
An offer that he could not refuse

She said don't, don't you wanna
Wanna fall in love tonight
(She said) Don't, don't you wanna
Wanna fall in love tonight

She said
Underneath the taffeta
There ain't no better hiding place
If I see the moon, I'll just laugh at her
Wanna wake up to your, your pretty face

Don't, don't you wanna
Wanna fall in love tonight
(She said) Don't, don't you wanna
Wanna do it till the morning light
She said

We can sleep all day tomorrow
Dream about this fantasy, fantasy
We don't have to backspin, apologize, or borrow
Uh, 'bout to go hard, y'all ready for me

Don't, don't you wanna
Wanna fall in love tonight
(She said) Don't, don't you wanna
Wanna do it till the morning light

Don't, don't you wanna
(Fall in love tonight)
(She said) Don't, don't you wanna
Do it till the morning light

She said
(Don't you wanna, don't you wanna, don't you wanna, don't you wanna)
Fall in love tonight
