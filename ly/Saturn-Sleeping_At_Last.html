		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You taught me the courage of stars before you left
How light carries on endlessly, even after death
With shortness of breath
You explained the infinite
And how rare and beautiful it is to even exist

I couldn't help but ask for you to say it all again
I tried to write it down, but I could never find a pen
I'd give anything to hear you say it one more time
That the universe was made just to be seen by my eyes

I couldn't help but ask for you to say it all again
I tried to write it down, but I could never find a pen
I'd give anything to hear you say it one more time
That the universe was made just to be seen by my eyes

With shortness of breath
I'll try to explain the infinite
And how rare and beautiful it is to even exist

With shortness of breath
I'll try to explain the infinite
And how rare and beautiful it truly is that we exist
