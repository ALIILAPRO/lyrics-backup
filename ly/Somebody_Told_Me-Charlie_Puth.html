		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was just with you on your birthday
And I met your whole family
But on the way home
You kept lookin' at your phone
Couldn't help here ask, "who was that, babe?"
And the way you said "nobody"
I knew the rumors, they are more than just rumors

Maybe I should have noticed
You were just half in love
Maybe I should have noticed
That I'm not the only one

Somebody told me that you
Got another lover you've been giving it to
Can't believe I believed you
You were my girl

Somebody saw you with him
Now you're tryna tell me that he's only a friend
Can't believe I believed it
You were my girl
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Lately you've been making excuses
And the stories ain't addin' up
But I just got blind, when you look into my eyes
Every time that I tried to confront you
There's always somewhere you gotta run to
The warning signs, they were more than just warning signs

Maybe I should have noticed
You were just half in love
Maybe I should have noticed
That I'm not the only one

'Cause somebody told me that you
Got another lover you've been giving it to
Can't believe I believed you
You were my girl

Somebody saw you with him
Now you're tryna tell me that he's only a friend
Can't believe I believed it
You were my girl
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
You were my girl

Maybe I should have noticed
You were just half in love
(You were half in love)
Maybe I should have noticed
That I'm not the only one (You were my girl)

Yeah
Maybe I should have noticed
That I'm not the only one

Somebody told me that you
Got another lover that you've been giving it to
Can't believe I believed you (believed you)
You were my girl

Somebody saw you with him
Now you're tryna told me that he's only a friend
Can't believe I believed it (-lieved it)
You were my girl
'Cause you are my
Ay, You were my girl

Maybe I should have noticed
You were just half in love
(You were half in love)
Maybe I should have noticed
That I'm not the only one

You were my girl
