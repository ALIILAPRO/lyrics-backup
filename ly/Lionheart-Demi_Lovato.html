		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your light is inside of me
Like a raging roar
Like an ocean born
You're in my veins
Your voice is serenity
When the Sun goes down
And the strength I've found
Is in my veins

Our story binds us
Like right and wrong
Your hand in mine
Marching to the beat of the stars

And we walk together into the light
And my love will be your armor tonight
We are lionhearts
And we stand together facing a war
And our love is gonna conquer it all
We are lionhearts

You're here like a silhouette
When the darkness rules
You're the brightest moon
And I am safe

The story binds us
Like right and wrong
Your hand in mine
Marching to the beat of the stars

And we walk together into the light
And my love will be your armor tonight
We are lionhearts
And we stand together facing a war
And our love is gonna conquer it all
We are lionhearts

You're never far from where I am
Like a lighthouse, bring me home
You're never far from me
Let your spirit glow

And we walk together into the light
And my love will be your armor tonight
We are lionhearts
And we stand together facing a war
And our love is gonna conquer it all
We are lionhearts
And we walk together into the light
And my love will be your armor tonight
We are lionhearts
