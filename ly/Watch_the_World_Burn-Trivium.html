		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If we all fall down,
We fall before moving wheels,
Crushed between the gears!
If we fall in line,
We see that this path leads straight,
Into the great machine!

If we all fall down,
We're swallowed by hopelessness,
Digested by their need!
If we fall in line,
We're cycled throughout the blood,
Keeping it alive.

I cannot take it anymore.
(I cannot take it anymore!)
I feel it bleed out on the floor.
(I feel it bleed out on the floor!)
You are a lost cause.
(You are a lost cause!)
You are a lost cause!

[Repeat: x2]
Watch the world burn,
It sets the air on fire!
Watch the world burn,
We are the arson!

If we break their hold,
We open our arms to fight,
Unleashing the light!
If we stand our ground,
We become the enemy,
The revolution sounds!

If we break their hold,
We're faced down by everything,
Challenged with a war!
If we stand our ground,
We're sacrificing ourselves,
To save so much more

I cannot take it anymore.
(I cannot take it anymore!)
I feel it bleed out on the floor.
(I feel it bleed out on the floor!)
You are a lost cause.
(You are a lost cause!)
You are a lost cause!

[Repeat: x2]
Watch the world burn,
It sets the air on fire!
Watch the world burn,
We are the arson!

Holding the breath now,
Don't make a sound,
Don't make a sound!

We are the arson,
We burn it down,
We burn it down!

I cannot take it anymore.
(I cannot take it anymore!)
I feel it bleed out on the floor.
(I feel it bleed out on the floor!)
You are a lost cause.
(You are a lost cause!)
You are a lost cause!

[Repeat: x2]
Watch the world burn,
It sets the air on fire!
Watch the world burn,
We are the arson!

[Repeat: x2]
We are the arson!
We are the arson!
We are the arson!
Watch the world burn!
