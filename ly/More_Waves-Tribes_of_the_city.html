		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They are many
But seemingly benign
Although they carry
A mysterious cargo

They don't pose questions
Don't give answers
All they want is

More of everything
More than anything
More of everything
More than anything
More of everything

The waves roll in 
Like dancers
Demanding an audience

They are many
Many

Hollow hollow hollow
Shallow shallow shallow
Hollow hollow hollow
Shallow shallow shallow
More of everything
More than anything 
More of everything
More than anything
More of everything
More and more and more and more
More and more and more
More and more and more and more
More and more and more
