		  War
A war
A war
On the far side
On the other side of the planet

And I've got
War
A war
A war
Right behind my eyes
Right behind 'em just like a headache

So I turn on (the news)
Turn off (the news)

Every second, our collective heart breaks
All together, every single head shakes
Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
(Turn on, turn off, the news)

Every second, our collective heart breaks
All together, every single head shakes
Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
(Turn on, turn off, the news)

Far
I'm far
So far
From a front line
Quite the opposite, I'm safe inside

But I worry and I give money
And I feel useless behind this computer
And that's just barely scratched the surface of my mind

So I turn on (the news)
Turn off (the news)
Turn on (the news)
Turn off (the news)

Every second, our collective heart breaks
All together, every single head shakes
Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
(Turn on, turn off, the news)

Every second, our collective heart breaks
All together, every single head shakes
Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
(Turn on, turn off, the news)

Exploitative
Performative
Informative
And we don't know the half of it
Rhetorical
Deplorable
Historical
And all along, we call it normal

Exploitative
Performative
Informative
And we don't know the half of it
Rhetorical
Deplorable
Historical
And all along we call it normal

(All along we call it normal)

Every second, our collective heart breaks
All together, every single head shakes
Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
(Turn on, turn off, the news)

Every second, our collective heart breaks
All together, every single head shakes
Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
(Turn on, turn off, the news)
