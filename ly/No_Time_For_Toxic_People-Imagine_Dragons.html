		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The way they look at me, I know exactly
What they talk about when I'm not around
Got no time for that, as a matter of fact
Every day's my birthday, oh, I hope you heard me

Take a look outside, it's a beautiful day, yeah
Yeah, it's a beautiful day, yeah
I'm gonna keep it that way, that way, ayy
Take a real good look, it's a beautiful day, yeah
Yeah, it's a beautiful day, yeah
I'm gonna keep it that way, that way, ayy

So spend your hours on what you think I've done wrong
I know I'm in your mind, I've been here way too long
I want to spend my life with those who's done me right
Your heart is frozen over, I'm a four-leaf clover

Take a look outside, it's a beautiful day, yeah
Yeah, it's a beautiful day, yeah
I'm gonna keep it that way, that way, ayy
Take a real good look, it's a beautiful day, yeah
Yeah, it's a beautiful day, yeah
I'm gonna keep it that way, that way, ayy

Do-do, do-do-do, no time for toxic people
Do-do, do-do-do, no time for that, I
Do-do, do-do-do, no time for toxic people
I, I've got no time for toxic people

Move along, move along, move along, go
Let me go to the clouds below
'Cause they're callin' me up to higher ground
What a teacup sound, even mighty drown, oh

Take a look outside, it's a beautiful day, yeah
Yeah, it's a beautiful day, yeah
I'm gonna keep it that way, that way, ayy
Take a real good look, it's a beautiful day, yeah
Yeah, it's a beautiful day, yeah
I'm gonna keep it that way, that way, ayy

Do-do, do-do-do, no time for toxic people
Do-do, do-do-do, no time for that, I
Do-do, do-do-do, no time for toxic people
I, I've got no time for toxic people
