		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh no, hmm-hmm
I've seen the rest before
And I've settled for less before
An offer so much more 
Has been knocking upon my door
Don't hesitate or so I've heard that
Eventually you'll quit waiting for me
Since I know we both belong in arms in crazy love
I gotta open up before you leave

Baby it's time to get up on track
And give it all back to you
I know that you love me
You're always there for me
Baby it's time to get up on track
And give it all back to you
I could lose you forever
And it's now or never

Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
We spend the entire day
How you always knew what to say, ooh?
You never asked to stay
And I can't believe that I couldn't see
Gotta open up before you leave me lonely, ooh

Baby it's time to get up on track
And give it all back to you
I know that you love me
You're always there for me
Baby it's time to get up on track
And give it all back to you
I could lose you forever
And it's now or never

Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
Now or never 
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no

I know we both belong in arms
I know it's crazy love
I know we both belong in arms
I know it's crazy love, it's crazy love

Baby it's time to get up on track
And give it all back to you
I know that you love me
You're always there for me
Baby it's time to get up on track
And give it all back to you
I could lose you forever
And it's now or never

Baby it's time to get up on track
And give it all back to you
I know that you love me
You're always there for me
Baby it's time to get up on track
And give it all back to you
I could lose you forever
And it's now or never 

I know we both belong in arms
I know it's crazy love
I know we both belong in arms
I know it's crazy love, it's crazy love

I know we both belong in arms
I know it's crazy love
I know we both belong in arms
I know it's crazy love, it's crazy love
