		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are stellar

Meet me in outer space
We could spend the night
Watch the earth come up
I've grown tired of that place
Won't you come with me?
We could start again

How do you do it?
Make me feel like I do
How do you do it?
It's better than I ever knew, uh

Meet me in outer space
I will hold you close
If you're afraid of heights
I need you to see this place
It might be the only way
That I can show you how it feels to be inside of you

How do you do it?
Make me feel like I do
How do you do it?
It's better than I ever knew, uh
How do you do it?
Make me feel like I do

I do, oh, uh-uh-uh
You are stellar
You are stellar

How do you do it?
Make me feel like I do
How do you do it?
It's better than I ever knew, uh
How do you do it?
Make me feel like I do
How do you do it?
Make me feel like I do, yeah
