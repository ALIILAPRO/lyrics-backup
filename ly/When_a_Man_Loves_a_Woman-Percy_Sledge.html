		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothing else
He'd change the world
For the good thing he's found
If she's bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend
If he put her down

When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
Trying to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way it ought to be

Well, this man loves you, woman
I gave you everything I had
Trying to hold on to your heartless love
Baby, please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Down deep in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she plays him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Loving eyes can't ever see

When a man loves a woman
He can do her no wrong
He can never want some other girl

Yes, when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
'Cause baby, baby, you're my world

When a man loves a woman
