		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been a little different lately, think I lost my mind
Tryna pick up all the pieces, that you left behind
I can't even call you baby, cause you're no longer mine
And it don't feel right
No it don't feel right

My oh my
Oh it hurts so hard
Cause you're on my mind, but you're out my arms
How could you do this, leave me in ruins
I'm lying in the dark
Thinking my oh my
Was it my oh my, my fault

Maybe i'm little heavy, I pulled you down sometimes
Tried so hard to make you happy, but we always fight
Now I'm screaming at the shadows in the kitchen
Cause I miss those nights
now it don't feel right
No it don't feel right

My oh my
Oh it hurts so hard
Cause you're on my mind, but you're out my arms
How could you do this, leave me in ruins
I'm lying in the dark
Thinking my oh my
Was it my oh my, my fault

Tell me was it all my fault
Cause I can't take it anymore

My oh my
Oh it hurts so hard
Cause you're on my mind, but you're out my arms
How could you do this, leave me in ruins
I'm lying in the dark
Thinking my oh my
Was it my oh my, my fault
