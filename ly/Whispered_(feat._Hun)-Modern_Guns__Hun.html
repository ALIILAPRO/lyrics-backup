		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dreading myself
In an endless sorrow
In mindless shelves
The screaming crow

And now it's the end
Of this painful book
Memories end
My heart shook
I feel hopeless

The sun is setting
The painted sky
All I see is a black lighting
That makes me cry

Dreading myself
In an endless sorrow

In mindless shelves
The screaming crow

The silence that kills
My heart collides
In mindless shelves
The screaming crow

And now it's the end
Of this painful book
Memories end
My heart shook
I feel hopeless

I feel hopeless
I am sorry, I deserve this
Over and over
Whispered

Will your anger, and hatred
Suddenly melt away?
When you realized I was asking
For you to cut me this way

Dreading myself
In an endless sorrow
In mindless shelves
The screaming crow

Would you take me in your arms?
When can you hear my words?
I am sorry, I deserve this
Over and over again
Whispered
