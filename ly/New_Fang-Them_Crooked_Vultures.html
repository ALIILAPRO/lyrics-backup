		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  New fang
Nothing
I don't mean
To parade
By the sucking on a one or other

Stand up
Step aside
Open wide
Hangin' out
My ability is gone

Want two?
Yes I do
Went along
Take a dose
Getting gone for girls
Blue slips
Blood sex sweat
Can I go
I think it's what I gotta know

Sometimes ya break a finger on the upper hand
Think you got me confused for a better man

Sometimes you break the finger on the upper hand
Say you've got me confused, ah

I ain't a better man

No slack
Cadillac
Couldn't quit
Guns slaps
As we take it back

Except
What I left
Far behind
In a time
When my mind was like a landmine

Tailgate
By the lane
Too much too young
Everybody gonna go along

Turn red
No show
Gotta let us know your gonna roll

Sometimes ya break a finger on the upper hand
Said you've got me confused with a better man

Sometimes you break the finger on the upper hand
I know you've got me confused

Don't go, oh no

New fang pressing down low
No more waiting around for

New fang pressing down, ah
No more waiting around, ah

New fang
New fang
They gonna wait? No

New fang
New
They ain't gonna wait no more
