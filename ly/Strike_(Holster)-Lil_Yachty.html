		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah (mm, mm)
Okay (yeah), okay, okay (mm, mm, mm, mm)
It's us (brr)

I been rolled up, look, I was geekin'
I was-, huh, I was high as fuck, tweakin' (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I was tryna strike shit, I was tryna strike shit
I was tryna strike shit, like a match, late night, yeah
Strike like I missed it, strike like I hit the pin
Strike like I'm not goin' to work, strike, strike

You know that shit look real when you already do
You know the guys sip on drank 'til it's early, yeah
All of this Bottega, shoulda shopped at Burlington 
Drank man had cracked the seal, I begged him to sell it too (I did)
Stars in the roof, this shit ain't nothin', I switch the coupe (gang)
Emo bitch, she like to go take shrooms, look like Betty Boop (yeah, yeah)
Shittin' me, coppin' SRTs and do Fruity Loops (shittin' me)
He can't play big bank, I switch out whips like they switch out shoes (yeah)

Yeah (mm, mm)
Okay (yeah), okay, okay (mm, mm, mm, mm)
It's us (brr)

I been rolled up, yeah, I was geekin' (yeah)
I was-, huh, I was high as fuck, tweakin' (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I was tryna strike shit, I was tryna strike shit (strike)
I was tryna strike shit, like a match, late night, yeah (slatt, slatt, strike)
Strike like I missed it (yeah), strike like I hit the pin (yeah)
Strike like I'm not goin' to work (Yeah), strike, strike

Slide, slide, shoulders, huh, shoulders
Stack them old hundreds, recreate Yoda (hm, hm, hm)
I don't put no crushed ice in my soda (hm, hm, hm)
Perky got her stuck like a holster, uh (hm, hm, hm)
It's a gun in my holster (hm, hm, hm, no stylist)
New Balenci' out in Dover (hm, hm, hm, 220)
It's a four in my soda, sit on a Balenci' coaster (shh)

Yeah (mm, mm)
Okay (yeah), okay, okay (mm, mm, mm, mm)
It's us (brr)

I been rolled up (Yeah), yeah, I was geekin' (Yeah)
I was-, huh, I was high as fuck, tweakin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I was tryna strike shit, I was tryna strike shit
I was tryna strike shit, like a match, late night, yeah
Strike like I missed it, strike like I hit the pin
Strike like I'm not goin' to work, strike, strike
