		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You light up another cigarette and I pour the wine
It's four o'clock in the morning and it's starting to get light
Now I'm right where I wanna be, losing track of time
But I wish that it was still last night

You look like you're in another world but I can read your mind
How can you be so far away, lying by my side
When I go away I'll miss you and I will be thinking of you
Every night and day

Just promise me you'll wait for me
'Cause I'll be saving all my love for you
And I will be home soon
Promise me you'll wait for me
I need to know you feel the same way too
And I'll be home, I'll be home soon

When I go away I'll miss you and I will be thinking of you
Every night and day
Just promise me you'll wait for me
'Cause I'll be saving all my love for you
And I will be home soon
Promise me you'll wait for me
I need to know you feel the same way too

And I'll be home, I'll be home
Promise me you'll wait for me
'Cause I'll be saving all my love for you
And I will be home soon

Promise me you'll wait for me
I need to know you feel the same way too
And I'll be home, I'll be home soon
