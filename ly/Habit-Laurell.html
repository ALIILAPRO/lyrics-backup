		  (You just a habit
Nana-na-na-na, not just a habit)
Oh-yeah

Forty-eight sorrys to my face
Three cups of coffee
I used to make for you, to make for you
Seven calls a week you're "running late"
Lost count of the dates, I had to wait for you
To wait for you (for you)

My heart tried a tausend times
Got eighty-tousand thoughts running through my mind
Round and round but I can't draw the line

You just a habit
And I know I gotta break
I know you no good for me but I can't stay away
'Cause I'm an addict
And I'm needing you every single day
I know you no good for me
But you're not easy to break, ey

Nana-na-na-na, not just a habit
Not just a habit

I want you more than 24 hours a day
Babe I put the work in all 365, 365
I'm tryna kick ya but I'm not ok
Don't know if I'm gonna make it outta here alive
Out here alive (out here alive)

My heart tried a tausend times
Got eighty-tousand thoughts running through my mind
Round and round but I can't draw the line

You just a habit
And I know I gotta break
I know you no good for me but I can't stay away
'Cause I'm an addict
And I'm needing you every single day
I know you no good for me
But you're not easy to break, ey

Nana-na-na-na, not just a habit
Not just a habit (not just a habit)

Nana-na-na-na, not just a habit
You not just a habit (not just a habit, not just a habit)

I'm caught, in th–µ middle cuz I can't stop
But I know I need one more shot
I don't care if it's wrong or not

You just a habit
And I know I gotta break
I know you no good for me
But you're not easy to break, ey

Nana-na-na-na, not just a habit (not just a habit)
But I can't stay away
'Cause I'm an addict (oh-oho)
And I'm needing you every single day
I know you (uhu-oh) no good for me
But you're not easy to break
