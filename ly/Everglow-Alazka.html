		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ruled the night
Too long to see the sun
Now all that's left to give
Is but a little spark
Of what I had inside

Your need to run away
Your addiction to escape
A life so full of harm
Now you ended up with me tonight

I know you'll witness what I am
Can't bring myself to let it go
(cause you've) seen a man in suffering
But chose to stay

Chase the sun
Cause if I'm the only one
Losing honesty
Don't fall for me
Fall for yourself
Yourself
I can't let you stay
Don't fall for me
Fall for yourself

A ray of light
A stranger on the run
There's nowhere to return
Nowhere you belong
When the day begins

I know that you feel safe
But still you're out of place
And you can't stay with me
So I can't afford to let you in

Now we're falling
You got so much more

I know you'll witness what I am
Can't bring myself to let it go
(cause you've) seen a man in suffering
But chose to stay

Chase the sun
Cause if I'm the only one
Losing honesty
Don't fall for me
Fall for yourself
Yourself
I can't let you stay
Don't fall for me
Fall for yourself

You've been waiting for a lifetime
You've been waiting for a lifetime
But I can't forget you

To suffer
Is the price that we pay until forever
Honestly
Don't fall for me
For me

Chase the sun
Cause if I'm the only one
Losing honesty
Don't fall for me
Fall for yourself
Yourself
I can't let you stay
Don't fall for me
Fall for yourself
