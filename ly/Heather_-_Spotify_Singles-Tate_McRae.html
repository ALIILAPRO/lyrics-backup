		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I still remember, third of December
Me in your sweater
You said it looked better on
Me than it did you
Only if you knew, how much I liked you
But I watched your eyes as she

Walks by what a sight for sore eyes
Brighter than a blue sky
She's got you mesmerized while I die

Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater
It's just polyester but you like her better
I wish I were Heather

Watch as she stands with her
Holding your hand
Put your arm 'round her shoulder
Now I'm getting colder
But how could I hate her? She's such an angel
But then again
Kinda wish she were dead as she

Walks by what a sight for sore eyes
Brighter than a blue sky
She's got you mesmerized while I die

Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater
It's just polyester but you like her better
I wish I were Heather

Oh, I wish I were Heather oh, oh, oh

Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater
It's just polyester but you like her better
I wish I were Heather
