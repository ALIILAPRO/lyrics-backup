		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wise men say, "Only fools rush in"
But I can't help falling in love with you

Shall I stay? Would it be a sin?
If I can't help falling in love with you?

Like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things were meant to be

Take my hand, take my whole life, too
'Cause I can't help falling in love with you

Like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things were meant to be, oh

Take my hand, take my whole life, too
'Cause I can't help falling in love with you
'Cause I can't help falling in love with you
But I can't help falling in love with you
