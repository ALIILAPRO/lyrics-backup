		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember
Our last summer
When your heart met mine
We would dive in
To the ocean
Always side by side

I hear your world's been getting colder, colder
But through it all, I'll be your shoulder, shoulder
And even though we're getting older, older
Remember what we said

That if the world was ending
You know I'll carry you home
(You home)
I'll be the last man standing
To keep you safe from the storm
(The storm)
I'll be the light in your darkest night
Until you know it will be alright
'Cause if the world was ending
You know I'll carry you home
I go
Wherever you go

I remember
I was broken
How you held me up
With your love, you
Made me stronger
You believed in us

I hear your world's been getting colder, colder
But through it all, I'll be your shoulder, shoulder
And even though we're getting older, older
Remember what we said

That if the world was ending
You know I'll carry you home
(You home)
I'll be the last man standing
To keep you safe from the storm
(The storm)
I'll be the light in your darkest night
Until you know it will be alright
'Cause if the world was ending
You know I'll carry you home
I go
Wherever you go

That if the world was ending
You know I'll carry you home
(Yeah, you home, yeah)
I'll be the last man standing
To keep you safe from the storm
(Yeah, the storm, yeah)
I'll be the light in your darkest night
Until you know it will be alright
'Cause if the world was ending
You know I'll carry you home
I go
Wherever you go
