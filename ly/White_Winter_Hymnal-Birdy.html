		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was following the
I was following the
I was following the
I was following the
I was following the pack
All swallowed in their coats
With scarves of red tied 'round their throats
To keep their little heads 
From falling in the snow
And I turned 'round and there you go
And Michael, you would fall 
And turn the white snow red as strawberries 
In the summertime

I was following the pack
All swallowed in their coats
With scarves of red tied 'round their throats
To keep their little heads 
From falling in the snow
And I turned 'round and there you go
And Michael, you would fall 
And turn the white snow red as strawberries 
In the summertime

I was following the pack
All swallowed in their coats
With scarves of red tied 'round their throats
To keep their little heads 
From falling in the snow
And I turned 'round and there you go
And Michael, you would fall 
And turn the white snow red as strawberries 
In summertime

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
