		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh-ooh
I wanna walk to the edge of the earth
Scream your name'till the fire's gone from my lungs
I wanna drink till I don't feel the urge
To run back to you and lay down, make me yours

I can still feel your breath all over me, filling me
I could fuck with you for eternity, infinity
Takeoff and lights on, I could be your lover
I could be the one for you and no one else at all

So how long will it be till you see how bad I need this?
I'll give you all if you please never leave, I need to keep it
I could fuck with you for infinity

I wish I never touched no one before
I envy the hearts that you've adored
Who you've loved
Don't wanna fight, so let's settle the score
Tear me apart
But don't let go

I can still feel your breath all over me, filling me
I could fuck with you for eternity, infinity
Takeoff and lights on, I could be your lover
I could be the one for you and no one else at all

So how long will it be till you see how bad I need this?
I'll give you all if you please never leave, I need to keep it
I could fuck with you for infinity

Tell me that I'm crazy, tell me I'm wrong
I will be your baby even when you're gone
'Cause I don't wanna take that I don't feel you at all
I'll be standing here when you call

I can still feel your breath all over me, filling me
I could fuck with you for eternity, infinity
Takeoff and lights on, I could be your lover
I could be the one for you and no one else at all

So how long will it take till you see how bad I need this?
I'll give you all if you please never leave, I need to keep it
I could fuck with you for infinity

I could fuck with you for infinity
I could fuck with you for infinity
