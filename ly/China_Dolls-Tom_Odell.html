		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't be so hard on yourself
You gave it all you had
It's something inside you
Petrified you
Try not to feel so bad

Don't be so hard on yourself
The game is cruel and tough
You had a straight 
And a couple of aces
But it wasn't quite enough

That's the way it goes
Some you win and some you don't
Some you sing and hearts get broke
Like china dolls, like china dolls
Delicate and beautiful

Look at their purple, look at their purple eyes
Your stepfather's on the phone
He wants to know if you're coming home
He's sick of you always getting stoned
With your china dolls
And your china dolls
Delicate and beautiful

Don't be so hard on yourself
We know that you tried
Gave 'em some love
And a couple of doves
But they didn't wanna fly

And that's the way it goes
Some they fill your heart and soul
Some they treat you so damn cold
Like china dolls, like china dolls
Delicate and beautiful

Look at their devil, look at their devil eyes
The police are on the phone
They want to know if you're coming home
God, I wish that your mother had never sold
Those china dolls, those china dolls
Delicate and beautiful
Oh, your china dolls and your china dolls
China doll, oh china dolls
