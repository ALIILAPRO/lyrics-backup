		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, paradise, yeah (yeah)
It's somewhere that I never been before (before)
Yeah, I just wanna be there when I wake up (wake up)
Yeah, like you better with no makeup (makeup, no, yeah)
Yeah, paradise, yeah (yeah)
It's somewhere that I never been before (before)
Yeah, I just wanna be there when I wake up (wake up)
Yeah, like you better with no makeup (makeup, no, yeah, yeah)

Baby, you like me, like the way you stay clean
Alexander the Wang, Alexander McQueen
You doing your little thing, you rocking Balmain
I'm rocking Mr. Completely, the 424 jeans
I started touring (I started touring)
My life is the opposite of "My life is oh-so boring"
Yeah, you know so turnt up (woo)

Paradise, yeah (yeah)
It's somewhere that I never been before (oh)
Yeah, I just wanna be there when I wake up (wake up)
Yeah, like you better with no makeup (makeup, no, yeah)

My phone, ignore it (my phone, ignore it)
When you be calling (when you be calling)
I started balling (I started balling) 
You stopped your stalling (you stopped your stalling)
That Range, I parked it, I drive a Rover
I skrrt, I skrrt, yeah, I swerve and drive it just like I stole it
And she right on my side 'cause she's the boldest
Our style's the coldest, style's the coldest
We liplock until our lips are swollen
Live in the moment, good times is golden (yeah, yeah)
I'm not gonna lie, you got me open, yeah (yeah, woo, yeah)

But that's only in the moment

Yeah, paradise, yeah (yeah)
It's somewhere that I never been before (before)
Yeah, I just wanna be there when I wake up (wake up)
Yeah, like you better with no makeup (makeup, no, yeah)

Yeah, paradise, yeah
It's somewhere that I never been before
Yeah, I just wanna be there when I wake up
Yeah, like you better with no makeup
