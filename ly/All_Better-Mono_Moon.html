		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was storming out
That new pressure moved in
My skin's paper thin
There's a hurt to this wind
It was warmer then, all the cold took a hint
But Fall's coming up and came
Back with a sprint i'll just stay awhile
There's no harm getting wet
If the water's a threat, I can disappear
If those trees could talk
Would they tell me to go?
Or just not let me know that I fucked it up

I could give this all up if I wasn't so proud
I don't need all this shit
I'm all better now
I don't care which way's up
If I'm headed back down
I don't need all this shit
I'm all better now

The ice is thin
Don't know when I'll fall through
But I see the cracks
I've been hung up on that
Of no consequencе, is the weight of my step
If I go and gеt kept, it's the lake I bet
What's the catch, the rate
The cost of being left on my own?
Doesn't matter now, no, doesn't matter now
Jesus, take the wheel while I
Slide to the back
Have a panic attack, you've got it from here

I could give this all up if I wasn't so proud
I don't need all this shit
I'm all better now
I don't care which way's up
If I'm headed back down
I don't need all this shit
I'm all better now

I'm all better now i'm all better now

I could give this all up if I wasn't so proud
I don't need all this shit
I'm all better now
I don't care which way's up
If I'm headed back down
I don't need all this shit
I'm all better now i could give this all up
I could give this all up
I don't need all this shit
I don't need all this shit
I don't care which way's up
I don't care which way's up
I don't need all this shit
I'm all better now
