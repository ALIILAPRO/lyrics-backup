		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a strange time we're living in
World can put fear in ya
Hierarchy parties, they make us feel inferior
Greed runs through the parliament interior
Devils walk among us, they fit the criteria
Eerie theories strike fear in
Weary minded men
When we're clearly living in dictatorships?
Nearly blinded by illusions to choose
But who's fooling who?
A ball chained to your shoes I'm pained
It's a cryin' shame
The pursuit of our own wealth lights a flame
That makes greed a game that
Let's the whole world burn
As the world turns, the whole world burns
But money was invented for trade
But now those bit's of paper twist hearts
Make slaves turns a saint into a sinner
A child into a killer
His finger on the trigger of a money game

Oh, rain, rain, rain, rain
A storm it comes our way
And those who rise through distorted lies
Poison in the veins
But we like to point the blame, blame, blame
Blame it's easier to blame
But point the mirror at ourselves
We're all part of this old money game

Mmm-mm-mmm this old money game
Mmm-mm-mmm

Dear Mr president
It's evident that everyone's a
Resident of fear
When they support these ideas
That keep us separate
When the make us believe
That everybody is coming
To terrorise you in the streets
They say proudly through gritted teeth
"It's my right to hate
That's freedom of speech"
But, when did freedom become
A reason to hate? A way to justify a racial
Slur or insult we make
There's an irony in freedom
'cause us in the west
We have pillaged and plundered
And murdered like savages
Colonised all of the rest
That's called hypocrisy
Preach a certain value that
You'd never keep yourselves
If your country was in flames
You'd emigrate yourselves in a second
Still, you spit your venom
Demonising immigrants
When really your an immigrant
'Cause all of us are immigrants
Or descended from immigrants
The irony is imminent
I'll shed the light on immigrants
America was colonised by Britain
Britain, it was colonised by Rome
And also colonised by the Saxons
They were German by the way
You know how people throw
Shade upon the Germans
'Cause of histories pain?
And yet we make the same mistakes all again
Demonise a whole people Jewish or Muslim
The same and the same
Old situation plays on repeat
The same old TV shows repeat
Yeah, we worship the bleak
Our opinions aren't our own and
We follow like sheep
There's no left, there's no right
In the middle we sleep

Rain, rain, rain, rain
A storm, it comes our way
And those who rise through distorted lies
Poison in the veins
But we like to point the blame, blame, blame
Blame it's easier to blame
But point the mirror at ourselves
We're all part of this old money game

Mmm-mm-mmm this old money game
Mmm-mm-mmm this old money game
