		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And so it is
Just like you said it would be
Life goes easy on me
Most of the time
And so it is
The shorter story
No love, no glory
No hero in her sky

I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes

And so it is
Just like you said it should be
We'll both forget the breeze
Most of the time
And so it is
The colder water
The blower's daughter
The pupil in denial

I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes, my eyes

Did I, did I say that I loathe you?
Did I say that I wanted to leave it all behind?

I can't take my mind off of you
I can't take my mind off of you
I can't take my mind off of you
(I can't take my mind)
I can't take my mind off of you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind
(My mind)
My mind
(My mind)
My mind
My mind
My mind
Until I find somebody new
