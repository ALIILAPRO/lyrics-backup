		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Runnin' 'round with the wrong crowd

Goin' out on a last stand
Playin' too hard an' too loud
Bad cards in a bad hand
want to dance, want to sing
Whip you with the lickin' thing

Tonight I'm gonna kick up
Out drivin' in a big truck
An' maybe I'll get beat up

Caught with your pants down

Lining up for a roll call
Goin' out with a big bang
Gettin' caught in a shootout
Take it hard like a big man
Woman workin' so hot
Givin' it everything you got
Just like it's never gonna stop

Tonight I'm gonna kick up
Out drivin' in a big truck
An' maybe I'll get beat up

Caught with your pants down
She take 'em down, down, down
She rip off her stockin's when the place start rockin'
She was a woman with a mission, stick it in your face

Caught with your pants down
