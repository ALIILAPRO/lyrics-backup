		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thank you, I'll say goodbye soon
Though its the end of the world
Don't blame yourself now
And if its true
I will surround you and give life to a world
That's our own

Thank you, I'll say goodbye now
Though its the end of the world
Don't blame yourself
And if its true
I will surround you and give life to a world
That's our own

Thank you, I'll say goodbye soon
Though its the end of the world, don't blame yourself now
And if its true
I will surround you and give life to a world
That's our own

Thank you, I'll say goodbye now
Though its the end of the world, don't blame yourself
And if its true
I will surround you and give life to a world
That's our own
