		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Her daddy gave her, her first pony
Then taught her to ride
She climbed high in that saddle
Fell, I don't know how many times
He taught her a lesson that she learned
Maybe a little too well

Cowgirls don't cry, ride, baby, ride
Lessons in life are gonna show you in time
Soon enough, you're gonna know why
It's gonna hurt every now and then
If you fall get back on again
Cowgirls don't cry

She grew up, she got married
But it never was quite right
She wanted a house, a home and babies
He started comin' home late at night
She didn't let him see it break her heart
She didn't let him see her fall apart

'Cause cowgirls don't cry, ride, baby, ride
Yeah, lessons of life are gonna show you in time
Soon enough, you're gonna know why
It's gonna hurt every now and then
If you fall get back on again
Cowgirls don't cry

Phone rang early one mornin'
Her mama's voice, she'd been cryin'
Said, "It's your daddy, you need to come home
This is it, I think he's dyin'"
She laid the phone down by his head
The last words that he said

Cowgirl don't cry, ride, baby, ride
Lessons of life show us all in time
Too soon God'll let you know why
If you fall get right back on
The good Lord calls everybody home
Cowgirls don't cry
