		  Welcome to the Camp 
I guess you all know why we're here
My name is Tommy
And I became aware this year

If you want to follow me
You've got to play pinball
And put in your earplugs
Put on your eye shades
You know where to put the cork

Hey you getting drunk, so sorry!
I've got you sussed
Hey you smoking Mother Nature!
This is a bust!
Hey hung up old Mr. Normal
Don't try to gain my trust!
'Cause you ain't gonna follow me any of those ways
Although you think you must

We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it

We're not gonna take it
Never did and never will
We're not gonna take it
Gonna break it, gonna shake it
Let's forget it better still

Now you can't hear me
Your ears are truly sealed
You can't speak either
Your mouth is filled
You can't see nothing
And pinball completes the scene
Here comes Uncle Ernie to guide you to
Your very own machine
 
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it

We're not gonna take it
Never did and never will
Don't want no religion
And as far as we can tell
We ain't gonna take you
Never did and never will
We're not gonna take you
We forsake you
Gonna rape you
Let's forget you better still

We forsake you
Gonna rape you
Let's forget you better still

See me
Feel me
Touch me
Heal me

See me
Feel me
Touch me
Heal me

See me
Feel me
Touch me
Heal me

See me
Feel me
Touch me
Heal me

Listening to you
I get the music
Gazing at you
I get the heat
Following you
I climb the mountains
I get excitement at your feet

Right behind you
I see the millions
On you
I see the glory
From you
I get opinions
From you
I get the story

Listening to you
I get the music
Gazing at you
I get the heat
Following you
I climb the mountains
I get excitement at your feet

Right behind you
I see the millions
On you
I see the glory
From you
I get opinions
From you
I get the story

Listening to you
I get the music
Gazing at you
I get the heat
Following you
I climb the mountains
I get excitement at your feet

Right behind you
I see the millions
On you
I see the glory
