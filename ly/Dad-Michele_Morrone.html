		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was a little kid when momma told me "Stay strong"
I didn't know what to do when I'm left on my own
And I thought it doesn't matter to notice the love
You know what I mean
It's something precious
Those are my days
You're still my legend
Look at me now
I'm a dad
With all my mistakes, my mistakes
I don't care about
Look at me now
I'm a man
With all my mistakes, my mistakes

I've got a feeling
I don't want you to cry
And now I mean it
Those days not over
And you're still my reason to feel it

Feel it

Can you remember? You've told me this so many times
You have to start a fight, otherwise you will go down

This is what I've got
Standing in front of you
And it's not your fault
That you became someone new

Look at me now
Look at me now

I've got a feeling
I don't want you to cry
And now I mean it
Those days not over
And you're still my reason to feel it
I don't want you to cry
You know I mean it

This is your night, night, night, night
For you
This is your night, night, night, night
For you
