		  Oh-oh-oh
Hit me like a shot in the heart
Never shoulda played you so hard
Guess I played myself, that's my fault
Ooh-ooh-ooh

I don't even know how to think
'Cause now she got your heart so I feel
Stupid, foolish, afraid, I'm losing
Everything I thought I couldn't
My whole world is falling apart

Don't you go falling in love
Trust me she's not the one
She won't ever
Love you like I do
Hold you like I do
Know you like I do
Don't you go fallin' in love
'Cause I'ma break that shit up
I won't let her
Love you like I do
Touch you like I do
Nothing like I do
Nothing like I do

Hit me like a poisonous dart
You were trouble right from the start
Should have ran, I guess it's my fault
Mm-mm-mm

I don't even know how to think
'Cause now she got your heart so I feel
Stupid, foolish, afraid, I'm losing
Everything I thought I couldn't
My whole world is falling apart

Don't you go falling in love
Trust me she's not the one
She won't ever
Love you like I do
Hold you like I do
Know you like I do
Don't you go fallin' in love
'Cause I'ma break that shit up
I won't let her
Love you like I do
Touch you like I do
Nothing like I do
Nothing like I do
