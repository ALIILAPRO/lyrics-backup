		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I cheated myself
by painting a picture that doesn’t exist
you showed me your world
but you never kept your promises

How could I be so blind?
You were so hard to find
Didn’t see you had someone else on your mind

Lost track of the signs
One too many times
Didn’t know you would leave those scars on my mind

Got my head in the clouds
Does it really have to feel that way?
So lost, never found
Feels like you’re a million miles away

How could I be so blind?
You were so hard to find
Didn’t see you had someone else on your mind

Lost track of the signs
One too many times
Didn’t know you would leave those scars on my mind
