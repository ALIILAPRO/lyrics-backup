		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Boy I, boy I, boy I know
I know you get the feels (yeah)
Boy I, boy I, boy I know

Uh, I'm so curious
'Bout you boy, wanna keep it cool
But I know, every time you move
Got me frozen I
Get so shy
It's obvious (yeah, yeah)
Catchin' feels like butterflies
If I say what's on my mind
Would I hit bullseye? (Woo)
Shoot, I'm ready, aim and fire (fire)

Baby I (whoa)
Feel like Cupid's alive
Alive tonight
Yeah, tonight
If your heart beats the same way, let me know (yeah, let me know)
'Cause I'm boom, boom, boom from head to toe and I (from head to toe)

I know love, it is such a funny thing
A mystery allure
Gotta get to know you more
'Cause I, I can feel a real connection
A supernatural attraction-ah
I got the feels for you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You have stolen my heart, oh yeah
Never let it go, oh, oh, no
Never let it go, oh, oh, oh
Lightning straight to my heart, oh yeah
I got all the feels for sure
Yeah, I got all the feels for ya

Boy I, boy I, boy I know
I know I get the feels
Boy I, boy I, boy I know
I know you feel it, too

Sway in the moonlight, dance in the dark
I, I know that I caught your eye (that's right)
Are we on the same vibe? (Same vibe)
I wonder what's on your mind
'Cause you got me good and I wanna be your boo
If it's dumb, well, I wanna be a fool
Underneath the neon lights, baby
Electricity tonight, baby

I know love, it is such a funny thing
A mystery allure
Gotta get to know you more
'Cause I, I can feel a real connection
A supernatural attraction-ah
I got the feels for you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You have stolen my heart, oh yeah (oh yeah)
Never let it go, oh, oh, no
Never let it go, oh, oh, oh
Lightning straight to my heart, oh yeah
I got all the feels for sure
Yeah, I got all the feels for ya

Boy I, boy I, boy I know
I know I get the feels
Boy I, boy I, boy I know
I know you feel it, too
Boy I, boy I, boy I know
I know I get the feels
Boy I, boy I, boy I know
I know you feel it, too

You got my attention (oh)
So what's your intention
Yeah, tell me baby what's the deal?
Oh, one look and I know it, baby, my eyes reveal
That you, you, you give me the feels (oh), oh yeah

You have stolen my heart, oh yeah (oh yeah)
Never let it go, oh, oh, no
Never let it go, oh, oh, oh
Lightning straight to my heart, oh yeah
I got all the feels for sure
Yeah, I got all the feels for ya

Boy, I, boy, I, boy, I know (the feels)
I know I get the feels (oh, yeah) (the feels)
Boy, I, boy, I, boy, I know (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I know you feel it, too (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Boy, I, boy, I, boy, I know (the feels) (come on)
I know I get the feels
Boy, I, boy, I, boy, I know
I know you feel it, too
