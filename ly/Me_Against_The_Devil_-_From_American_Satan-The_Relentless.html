		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can try to describe me but you'll never define me 
Try to grow my wings but he holds me down 
Single file to bliss, how could i ever resist? 
But when i turn to you i find heaven on the ground 

The devil keeps on calling - i keep on falling down 
My faith is crawling away. Trapped in the dark 
You're my only light. It's me against the devil - i'm ready to fight 

(through faith and fire) through faith and fire i'll be by your side (by your side) 
(the devil's a liar) the devil's a liar but my love will never die (never die)

Careful what you wish for, it might all come true 
Careful what you sell from inside of you 
My damnation - a one way ticket to hell 
Do you wear the mark? It's so easy to tell 

They can call it faith or maybe destiny 
The only thing on my mind is you and me 
Trapped in the dark - you're my only light 
It's me against the devil - i'm ready to fight! 

(through faith and fire) through faith and fire i'll be by your side (by your side) 
(the devil's a liar) the devil's a liar but my love will never die (never die) 

Well don't sing me praise 
Just keep me from my grave 
It's my last chance for what could be 
He wants me a slave - I just wanna be saved 
From this bittersweet tragedy 

Trapped in the dark - you're my only light 
It's me against the devil tonight 

(through faith and fire) through faith and fire I'll be by your side (by your side) 
(the devil's a liar) the devil's a liar but my love will never die (never die) 

Well don't sing me praise 
Just keep me from my grave 
It's my last chance for what could be 
He wants me a slave - I just wanna be saved 
From this bittersweet tragedy
