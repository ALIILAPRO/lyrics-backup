		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heavy lines have start to spread under your eyes
To remind you that you'll never outrace time
But you've heard the calls
What rises falls
Destiny's unfair

Every wish you had
the dreams that you let go
every single hope you've thrown to oblivion
On your own, On your own

Let it go, Tonight
You're not a runaway
Why would you break away from your right
Tonight
Where ever leads the way
Don't ever doubt your faith
Same peculiar feeling
It's someone else's life

And it takes more than you think to keep on track
When your burden is beyond crushing your back
You can take a break and heal the ache
Find the time you lack
And you'll start to feel the sun warmth after all
You've endured to finally learn to let go
Let your past go
Let it go

Let it go, Tonight
You're not a runaway
Why would you break away from your right
Tonight
Where ever leads the way
Don't ever doubt your faith
Same peculiar feeling
It's someone else's life
