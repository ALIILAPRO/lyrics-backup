		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see you looking back at me, snake eyes 
How dare you glare at me, snake eyes 

Why is it I stand here while the pain reigns down 
Why is it you're kneeling there 
With your face to the ground 
Could it be our eyes cannot see the same way 
Could it be our hearts are still in yesterday 

How dare you tempt, how dare you try, snake eyes 
So I see as I turn, the mask fall from your face 
So now I know 
What seemed real was a false disgrace 
Could it be you only live the lies you make 
Could it be you only live the truth of your fate
