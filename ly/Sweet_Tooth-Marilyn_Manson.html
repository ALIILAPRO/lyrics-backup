		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Her heart shivers in my hand 
She's melting on me like cotton candy 
I make the faces that make you cry
I want you more when afraid of my 
Disease, disease is draining me 
Anymore your not so "pretty please" 
Disease, disease is draining me 
I want you more when your afraid of me 
I will break you inside out, you are mine, you are mine 
I will break you inside out, you are mine, you are mine 
Her hair hangs in swollen strings, 
I'm choking on her it feels so 
Sickening 
I make the faces that make you cry, 
I want more when your afraid of my 
Disease, disease is draining me, 
I want you more when your afraid of 
Me
