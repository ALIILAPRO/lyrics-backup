		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you called up my phone, I was all alone
Voice close to my ear, like the sound of a song
You said let's take a ride, this was late July
We got lost in the night (we got lost in the night)

So we drove around town in your beat up car
Soft sounds of your breath and the sound of my heart
Don't remember the words, I know how I felt
Is this trouble again?

I never felt like this with somebody
I never thought I'd feel like I do
I never felt this close with somebody
Somebody, somebody but you

I never had this rush in my body
I never thought I'd feel something new
I never felt this close with somebody
Somebody, somebody but you

Something 'bout you and the way we fit
Like the stars in the night, heat of you on my skin
Hadn't known you for long but it felt like years
From the second we met, I knew things would change

Everything would change
Everything would change
Don't remember the words, I know how I felt
Is this trouble again?

I never felt like this with somebody
I never thought I'd feel like I do
I never felt this close with somebody
Somebody, somebody but you

I never had this rush in my body
I never thought I'd feel something new
I never felt this close with somebody (somebody)
Somebody, somebody but you

I never felt like this with somebody
(With, with, with somebody)
I never thought I'd feel something new
(With, with, with somebody)
I want somebody like you
(With, with, with somebody)
I want somebody like you
(With, with, with somebody)

I never felt this close with somebody
Somebody, somebody but you
