		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh Olivia, I've looked through your photos
Seen your holidays and all your new cool clothes
In February you bleached your hair
My brunette just doesn't compare
Oh Olivia, I think you're perfect
Criticising you just isn't worth it
With a smile that just lights up the room
And your eyes the most perfect shade of blue
I'm sure you're great
I know it's true
But Olivia, I despise you
Do you know about me?
Did you think to ask?
About all the ex lovers of
Your new boyfriends past
Did he tell you I'm crazy?
At least that's what he made me
When he stayed up all through the night texting you
But still calling me baby
I'm sure you're great
I know it's true
But Olivia, I despise you
The room stops and stares
As she walks by
Can't help but lose myself in her eyes
And I bought that dress
Of hers that you liked
Heard it's your favourite to take off at night
But it's not the same
I'll never be her
I'm just a star lost in her universe
I'm not fucking insane
I just wish I were her
Olivia, remember that I had him first
I'm sure you're great
I know it's true
But Olivia, I despise you
