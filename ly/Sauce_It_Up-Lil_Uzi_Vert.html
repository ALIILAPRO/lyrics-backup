		  Sauce it up, ayy
Sauce it up, ayy
Sauce it up, ayy
Goin' dumb, ayy
Where you from, ayy
Throw it up, ayy
I'm one of the greatest to ever do it
Goin' dumb (hey)
Goin' nuts (hey)
Sauce it up (hey)

Sauce it up (sauce it up)
Do too much (do too much)
Ain't enough (ain't enough)

Where you from? (Where you from?)
Throw it up (throw that shit up)

Where you from? (Where you from?)
Throw it up (throw that shit up)
Goin' nuts (yeah)
Goin' dumb

Everyday I'm ballin', so you know I'm scorin'
My fish are imported, my pockets enormous
These niggas keep hatin', this is their last warning
Met that girl last night, ooh, fucked her through the morning
Um, no no girl, I'm sorry, hangup girl don't call me
No, no you will not get me caught up all up on Maury
Cash out, make it rain, no game, Atari
Ride me like a Harley, only boy in the party
I was on the phone, yeah with Playboi Carti
Commes des Gar√ßon, hearts all on my cardi'
I was in a Lamb', Carti he was in a 'Rari
I'm gon' keep on flexin', if you don't like it then I'm sorry (sorry)

Sauce it up (sauce it up)
Do too much (do too much)
Ain't enough (ain't enough)
Ain't enough (ain't enough)
Where you from? (Where you from?)
Throw it up (throw it up)
Goin' nuts (yeah)
Goin' dumb
Sauce it up (sauce it up)
Do too much (do too much)
Ain't enough (ain't enough)
Ain't enough (ain't enough)
Where you from? (Where you from?)
Throw it up (throw it up)
Goin' nuts (yeah)
Goin' dumb

Okay, big guap chasin'
Big knot havin'
My money stackin'
This shit extravagant (woah)
This for all my niggas
The ones that be traffickin'
All my diamonds African
I might go and matte the Benz
I already had that bitch
Went and got a badder bitch
Persian rug, Alladin shit
Nice foreign hoe like a Latin bitch
I could serve you
Ayy, let me say it one time
Ayy, turn around, baby girl
Let me serve you
Woo, yeah I said that you wet like Squirtle
Yeah, walk around pigeon-toed, got the bird flu (brrr)
And you think you in love, don't wanna hurt you (woah)
Man I think that I'm done, gotta swerve you

Sauce it up (sauce it up)
Do too much (do too much)
Ain't enough (ain't enough)
Ain't enough (ain't enough)
Where you from? (Where you from?)
Throw it up (throw it up)
Goin' nuts (yeah)
Goin' dumb
Sauce it up (sauce it up)
Do too much (do too much)
Ain't enough (ain't enough)
Ain't enough (ain't enough)
Where you from? (Where you from?)
Throw it up (throw that shit up)
Goin' nuts (yeah)
Goin' dumb

I'm so awesome
I'm so awesome
These niggas so mad it's exhaustin'
I swear I'm a stunna like Steve Austin
I swear I'm a stunna like Steve Austin
Sauce it up (ooh)
Do too much (ooh)
Where you from? (ooh)
Throw it up (ooh)
Going nuts (ooh)
Going dumb (ooh)
