		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I should be at home
I should be alone
Instead of convincing somebody that I'm gonna call
When the morning comes
I should settle down
Make my mama proud
Said she's been wanting grand babies 
I've just been practicing how (what?)

If you wanna dance with me, I'll spin you right around
Hand on your hip and dip you down, down, down
Baby, don't you fall for me, I'll tell you right now
You're gonna hate me when we hit the ground

Baby, I'm a project
Loving me's a mistake
Find another prospect
Save yourself the heartbreak
Think you're gonna fix me
Think we're making progress
You'll be broken with me
Somewhere in the process
Baby, I'm a project

You should leave me now
Take an easy out
If you need persuading then, baby, just ask around
It's a little town
You should think again
Listen to your friends
I got more to work on than I would like to admit, yeah

If you wanna dance with me, I'll spin you right around
Hand on your hip and dip you down, down, down
Baby, don't you fall for me, I'll tell you right now
You're gonna hate me when we hit the ground

Baby, I'm a project
Loving me's a mistake
Find another prospect
Save yourself the heartbreak
Think you're gonna fix me
Think we're making progress
You'll be broken with me
Somewhere in the process
Baby, I'm a project

Now stop
Take a look at yourself
Put that fairytale bullshit back on the shelf
I know you like guys that you think you can help
But I ain't gonna be a notch on your little tool belt
If you're looking for love, you ain't looking for me
If you're lookin' for a good time, hold my drink
We can finish this song, let me find my keys
Go on get to working on this project

Loving me's a mistake
Find another prospect
Save yourself the heartbreak
Think you're gonna fix me
Think we're making progress
You'll be broken with me
Somewhere in the process
Baby, I'm a project
