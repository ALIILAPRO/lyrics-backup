		  (Monsters gon' tear it up)

Like my hunnids blue (blue)
Bad bitches, yeah, I keep 'em by the two
It's a big difference between me and you
I ain't nothin' like you, you, you, or you
Uh

I'm on a whole 'nother level, these bitches is out of they league
These bitches ain't battin' like me
You bitches ain't badder than me
You bitches don't count on these bitches can't count
I am not the one, two, or the three
You bitches look up to me
You said you look up to her, but really you look up to me (me)
I can't be playin' with niggas, I married a G
I got some niggas that do what I say
If I tell 'em to shoot, they pull up from the three
When bitches be rappin', I'm laughin'
It sound like you tryin' to me
I'm who you dyin' to be
Will somebody cop all these groupies a ticket? 'Cause I'm who they dyin' to meet
I'm in the city, I drop a location and all of the killers come out
These niggas be frontin' for y'all, but they play the back when them killers is out
When them killers is out, cut 'em off like the scissors is out
When Barbie touchdown, the baddest of bitches is out

Like my hunnids blue (blue)
Bad bitches, yeah, I keep 'em by the two
It's a big difference between me and you
I ain't nothin' like you, you, you, or you
Uh
Like my hunnids blue (blue)
Bad bitches, yeah, I keep 'em by the two
It's a big difference between me and you
I ain't nothin' like you, you, you, or you
Uh

We not the same you my opposite
I am the queen you my opp and shit
The corniest bitches be poppin' shit
Everything a Fendi, fact, you know I just dropped my shit
I just pulled the Rolls up on me
Got the Draco for whoever rolls up on me (uh)
Put my pretty feet up on mean
I call my boyfriend then you gettin' beat up by me
Ayo, what's the teacup on me?
Tryna be down but they can't even keep up on me
Uh, this them new Bottega open toes
Who gon' tell her that it's Barbie, bitch? Ho, Barbie knows
Uh, couldn't see me with a hologram
It's that multicolor Louis V, monogram
Uh, and I'm smokin' on that Taliban
I ain't skiin' but my neck is givin' avalanche (avalanche, avalanche)

(Like my, like my, like my, like my)
Like my hunnids blue (blue)
Bad bitches, yeah, I keep 'em by the two
It's a big difference between me and you
I ain't nothin' like you, you, you, or you
Uh
Like my hunnids blue (blue)
Bad bitches, yeah, I keep 'em by the two
It's a big difference between me and you
I ain't nothin' like you, you, you, or you
Uh

Mm (it's a big difference)
They know the difference (it's a big difference)
Ayo, they know the difference (between me and you, I ain't nothin' like)
They ain't the one or the two or the three or the four
Still don't add up to me
