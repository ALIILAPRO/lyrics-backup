		  OLD TOMORROWS 
You are ready to take 
But let me guess the mess 
You are not at all 
Good with being taken 

You're not willing to speak 
But let me tell you a fact 
It's way too late to shout 
When no one is there to listen 

I told you once 
I told you twice 
One day the river might run dry
So hold your breath, count 1 2 3
Dive into the water while it's deep 

Rise or hit the ground below, hit the ground below 
Time to bleach old tomorrows, old tomorrows
It's up to us, to crack the rust, 
To soak up the young blood 
Rise or hit the ground below, hit the ground below 

You are ready to break 
But let me guess the rest 
You never thought you could 
Be the broken 

Oh you're not ready to make 
The first step of change 
One day it's too late 
Hearts won't open 

I told you once 
I told you twice
When rage is covering all of your face 
You'll be tied up by your veins
Your soul will hold you in disdain 

Past can be so good at giving you nothing
Young mistakers
Old days chasers
