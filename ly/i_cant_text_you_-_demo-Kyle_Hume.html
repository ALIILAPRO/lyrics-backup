		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't text you
I can't call you
But it's all I ever want to do
I bring you back through memories
But you're still gone

Wish I could have known back then in the moment
One day I'd be sitting here hoping
That you'd finally walk back through my door
And it could feel normal just once more
Hard to look back cuz I just can't take it
Every little thing I took for granted
All of the hello's and goodbye's
If I could just see you one more time

But I can't text you
I can't call you
But it's all I ever want to do
I bring you back through memories
But you're still gone
I still miss how
You would call me
Just to tell me all the small things
On your mind
It feels like I'm wasting time
Cuz without you I'm not fine

Ohhhh ohhhh
Ohhhh ohhhh
A million things I wish that I could say
But it's too late

Cuz I can't text you
I can't call you
But it's all I ever want to do
I bring you back through memories
But you're still gone ohhhh
I still miss how
You would call me
Just to tell me all the small things
On your mind
It feels like I'm wasting time
Cuz without you I'm not fine
