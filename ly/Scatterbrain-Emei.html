		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dun, dun dun, dun, dun dun (alright)

Got a lot of friends that I can't escape
Sleepin' in my head like a Motel 6
Hold it all together with a little duct tape
It bends, it breaks
Got a lot of dreams but I let them die
Ping pong, drip drop, oh my my
The TV's on but the noise is white (what am I doing now?)

God, can't I catch my breath?
Not even for a second
Chasin' Santa Ana winds
And I obsess, I slow dance with the tension
Can you taste it on my lips?

I'm so scatterbrain
But when you touch me, it all goes away
Scatterbrain
For a second I don't feel insane
Come medicate me

I don't sleep at all, yeah, I've been counting sheep
I look perfect on the surface but a nightmare underneath
I've got anger problems, I say things that I don't mean
Some people pay for therapy, I find it in the sheets (hey)

Catch my breath
Not even for a second
Chasin' Santa Ana winds

I'm so scatterbrain
But when you touch me, it all goes away
Scatterbrain
For a second I don't feel insane
Come medicate me (scatterbrain)

I need you baby (goes away)
I need it daily (scatterbrain)
I need you baby (feel insane)
Come medicate me

(Got a lot of friends that I can't escape, can't escape, can't escape)
(Sleepin' in my head like a Motel 6, Motel 6)
Come medicate me
