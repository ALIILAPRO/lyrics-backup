		  Sunrise
Forgot to cover up my eyes
Sunrise
Should've covered up my eyes
Beauty wasted on me
Winds are shakin' my tree
With a woman too good, to believe
Take the first ride out that I see

Sunrise
Skies are servin' my plan
Grounds are movin' where I stand
Pull an airplane down
With my hand
And take the first flight out that I can

Sunrise
Forgot to cover up my eyes
Beauty wasted on me
Winds are movin' my trees
With a woman too good, to believe
Take the first ride out that I see
Sunrise
