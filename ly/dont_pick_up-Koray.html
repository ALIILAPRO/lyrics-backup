		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't waste your time
Trying to think of more lies
I have heard it all before
Henny in my system all night
Drowning in my old life
I feel like I've been here before
Déjà vu
You didn't change your mind or your attitude
I even changed my number because of you
I've had enough
I've had enough of you
Yeah
I ain't picking up
I'm the one that used to call when no one gave a fuck
Now I don't wanna know
I used to love but I just wanna be alone
So
Leave a message at the tone
Don't call me up
Looking for attention
Please stop blowing up my phone
I won't pick up
My phone is in flight mode
Leave a message at the tone
Don't call me up
Looking for attention
Please stop blowing up my phone
I won't pick up
My phone is in flight mode
Leave a message at the
Don't waste your life
Trying to convince anyone of your lies
You don't want to see
You're the one who put these scars on me
I wasted all my energy
You believe in a different reality
I accept some things just aren't meant to be
You're just another memory
I will always feel the pain that you have put me through
Love will always be a game I'm gonna lose
Yeah
And even if I tried to understand your point of view
I always knew
You're lonely too
Leave a message at the tone
Don't call me up
Looking for attention
Please stop blowing up my phone
I won't pick up
My phone is in flight mode
Leave a message at the tone
Don't call me up
Looking for attention
Please stop blowing up my phone
I won't pick up
My phone is in flight mode
Leave a message at the
