		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Devil's out tonight, I'm walking by his side
So kiss yo' mama on the lips and softly say goodnight
Another night, there's no light
That's when I start creepin' like a hitman
Scope my man, then I toss the dynamite
Devil's out tonight, I'm walking by his side
So kiss yo' mama on the lips and softly say goodnight
Another night, there's no light
That's when I start creepin' like a hitman
Scope my man, then I toss the dynamite
Devil's out tonight, I'm walking by his side
So kiss yo' mama on the lips and softly say goodnight

Grew up with them robbers
Them shotters, them hot boys on the block
I pop up with that nine millimeter, the heater
Or the ether, for any fuckboy who want it
Night or the morning
At any moment I'm known to flash out with the eyes of Lucifer
I'm Judas
Plot with the red dot, hot with the six shot
Rot in the same pot, opps gonna get dropped
Docked in the same block, rocks all in my sock
Stocked with the same Glock
Mask on, pop, pop
The devil all up in me when I murder with the semi
Pull the trigger 'till it's empty, fuckboy, don't tempt me
Fuckboys all envy *59

Another night, there's no light
That's when I start creepin' like a hitman
Scope my man, then I toss the dynamite
Devil's out tonight, I'm walking by his side
So kiss yo' mama on the lips and softly say goodnight
Another night, there's no light
That's when I start creepin' like a hitman
Scope my man, then I toss the dynamite
Devil's out tonight, I'm walking by his side
So kiss yo' mama on the lips and softly say goodnight

Pull up with the Glock cocked, aim it at my head
Shot popped, now I'm dead, with a hole full of lead
Yung $now got your hoe on a sled, gettin' head in slo-mo
Siren sounds, here come the po-po
Oh no, heard I got that work for the low-low
Don't tell 'em shit, that's a no-no
Three little pigs, I'm the big bad wolf
Blood stained teeth, and I'm covered in wool
Huff and I puff, on a blunt packed full
Bricks ain't shit
Hit a lick on a bitch
Hold 'em up with the dick
One shot in the mouth, now she starting to drool
She blew me away, now my blood starts to pool
Grade A death, like a shooting at a school
Lay me to rest, I'm okay with no breath
Ain't a fool, I ain't like the rest, bitch, I be hanging with ghouls

Another night, there's no light
That's when I start creepin' like a hitman
Scope my man, then I toss the dynamite
Devil's out tonight, I'm walking by his side
So kiss yo' mama on the lips and softly say goodnight
Another night, there's no light
That's when I start creepin' like a hitman
Scope my man, then I toss the dynamite
Devil's out tonight, I'm walking by his side
So kiss yo' mama on the lips and softly say goodnight

Yuh, uh, everybody wanna be ya' homie
When you got your life intact
As I look around, I realize that all of my opinions turn to facts
I'm burning bridges 'cause I won't communicate with a label that can't relate to me
Myself and I, you gotta tell I can tell that you lie
I need more bread, I'm not satisfied
Satellite television is not enough
I pack out these shows
Got hoes waiting right by the bus
Just to get a chance to lick my nuts
$outh $ide $uicide, do or die, who am I?
Got that .45 in my Levis
I know this bitch wanna be mine
Treat this bitch like a feline, yuh, aye

Devil's out tonight, I'm walking by his side
So kiss yo' mama on the lips and softly say goodnight
