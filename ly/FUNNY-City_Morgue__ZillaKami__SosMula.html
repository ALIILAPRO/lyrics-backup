		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Got the beat by Powers and we just made a banger)

It's funny how nobody wanted me to win
It's funny that I feel better at home
It's funny, yeah, you could be so ignorant
I'm laughing 'cause you're gonna be alone
It's funny how nobody wanted me to win
It's funny that I feel better at home
It's funny, yeah, you could be so ignorant
I'm laughing 'cause you're gonna be alone

Okay, okay, you gon' die today
I shoot, you shoot, we both go out in flames
I can tell you cannot roll with me, I'm Jack the Ripper
Or just an alcoholic who can handle all this liquor
And I know you want me to pass away
Pull up because I am feeling the same way
Glocky with a beamer, rifle with a scope on
You gon' point it at me squeeze the shit I hope, huh

It's funny how nobody wanted me to win
It's funny that I feel better at home
It's funny, yeah, you could be so ignorant
I'm laughing 'cause you're gonna be alone
It's funny how nobody wanted me to win
It's funny that I feel better at home
It's funny, yeah, you could be so ignorant
I'm laughing 'cause you're gonna be alone

All these drugs, it got my feelings cold
I did too much, I feel it in my soul (gimme that, gimme that, gimme that)
On the run from parole, ain't going back to the hole (no-no, no-no)
They gotta kill me if I go (no-no, no-no)
I got the stick and .30 on me (doot-doot-doot-doot)
Got them bodies dirty on it (doot-doot-doot-doot)
We ain't turnin' my condolences (no-no, no-no)
We just burnin' my opponents (bap, bap, bap, bap)
We just swervin' in the stolen (vyoom, vyoom)
Off the perkies and I'm rollin' (gimme that, gimmie that)
Big burner and it's blowin' (bap, bap)
Got 'em murdered, he was trollin' (doot-doot-doot-doot-doot)
Bitch, I'm purgin' like the omen (ha)
Never heard 'em, I don't know 'em
Maybach curtains get to rolling (fuck outta here, vyoom)
I'ma merk 'em when it's snowing (bap, bap, bap)
This the payback, you ain't knowin' (no-no, no-no)
Get your face crack, now it's swollen (doot-doot-doot-doot-doot)
Got my face mask like it's snowing (vyoom, vyoom)
Hit the brake pads and keep going (vyoom, vyoom, vyoom, vyoom, vyoom)

It's funny how nobody wanted me to win
It's funny that I feel better at home
It's funny, yeah, you could be so ignorant
I'm laughing 'cause you're gonna be alone
It's funny how nobody wanted me to win
It's funny that I feel better at home
It's funny, yeah, you could be so ignorant
I'm laughing 'cause you're gonna be alone
