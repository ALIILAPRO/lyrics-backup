		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We fight every day and night
You want me to make the time
You always get mad and say what you coulda had
And that you want me to make it right, uh
I couldn't do that to save my life
You always tell me you ain't surprised
You say, "This the last time" 
I guess that you were right
'Cause I'ma do one with you tonight

And now I'm so sick of these love songs
So sad and slow
And I'm so sick of wishin'
I had you on my own
And, oh, baby, I've been fucked up
Ever since you been gone
I can't bring myself to even pick up my phone
I need you the most
I need you the most
I need you the most
I need you the most
I need you the most

I ain't gon' lie, oh baby, I've been fucked up
I said I was sorry for all of the times I fucked up
Fuck love, got me thinkin' while I pour my cup up
Tonight is in memory of you, I'm gettin' fucked up
Oh, just one more chance to make it right
Promise I got you, so tell me, what's up?
I don't think that I can keep goin' this way
I can't take it

Now I'm so sick of these love songs
So sad and slow
And I'm so sick of wishin'
I had you on my own
And, oh, baby, I've been fucked up
Ever since you been gone
I can't bring myself to even pick up my phone
I need you the most
I need you the most
I need you the most
I need you the most
I need you the most
