		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time has come to say goodbye
I know it's gonna make you cry
But you belong to another my love
And half a love that just isn't enough

I am so tired
And I just can't wait around for you
I am so tried
And I always thought we would see it through

I've waited all this time for you
Believed your promises were true
I keep believing that you mean what you say
You'll leave tomorrow - now tomorrow's today

And I often sit and wonder why
You're not with me tonight
I stayed at home remaining true
While you were out with you know who

I am so tired
And I just can't wait around for you
I am so tried
And I always thought we would see it through
