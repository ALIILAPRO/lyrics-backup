		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You and I, baby
Maybe we can ride away, baby
And I just wanna get inside, baby
But I don't wanna wait forever
Scared that I can't treat you better than her

So when I'm gonna know what to feel inside, baby?
Maybe it's just all in my head, so

Don't overthink, this is love
Maybe it's just a crush
Baby, is this your love affair, your love affair?
I hope what I feel is enough
Maybe this is just lust
Baby, is this your love affair, your love affair? Yeah

I wanna know
I wanna know how to feel, what to feel, what's right
I never know
'Cause when it gets real, I just run away and hide from you
From you
From you, ooh, ooh

So when I'm gonna know what to feel inside, baby?
Maybe it's just all in my head, so (so)

Don't overthink, this is love
Maybe it's just a crush
Baby, is this your love affair, your love affair?
I hope what I feel is enough
Maybe this is just lust
Baby, is this your love affair, your love affair? Yeah

And I just want a good time
But am I wrong for that? No
Am I wrong for that? No, no, yeah
And is it not the right time?
But what's the wrong in that, oh?
Am I wrong for that? No, no, so

Don't overthink, this is love
Maybe it's just a crush
Baby, is this your love affair, your love affair?
I hope what I feel is enough
Maybe this is just lust
Baby, is this your love affair, your love affair? Yeah
