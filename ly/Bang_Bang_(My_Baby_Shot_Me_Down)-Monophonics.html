		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was five and she was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
I wore black and she wore white
I would always win the fight

Bang bang, she shot me down
Bang bang, and I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up, I called her mine
She would always laugh and say
Remember when we used to play?

Bang bang, and she shot me down
Bang bang, and I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

Oh my baby
She shot me down

Now she's gone, I don't know why
And I didn't even say goodbye
Oh sometimes I sit and cry
Didn't even have the time to lie

Bang bang, she shot me down
Bang bang, oh, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

Oh she shot me down
Bang bang
And I hit the ground
Bang bang
Bang bang
