		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The look of love
Is in your eyes
A look your smile 
Can't disguise

The look of love
It's saying so much more than
Just words could ever say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
Is on your face
A look that time can't erase

Be mine, tonight
Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And then seal it with a kiss

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
Don't ever go
