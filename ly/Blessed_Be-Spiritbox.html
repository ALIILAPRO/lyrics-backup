		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I say my blessings all for you
I feel it fade from the inside 
I open up to adore you but everything 
Was just a crutch to preserve life
Serotonin like a loaded gun
I am a coward, you pull me up
Into a place where there's nothing that left for me
But insecurity

And if I lose myself
Blessed be, I could survive in these chemicals for you 
A lonely fool above 
Just out of reach 
I could survive in these chemicals only for you

I say my blessings all for you
You say blessed be the fool who
Plucks out the eyes just to listen in frequency 
It's just a crutch to ignore you 
Serotonin like a loaded gun
I am a coward, you pull me up
Into a place where there's nothing that left for me
But insecurity

And if I lose myself
Blessed be, I could survive in these chemicals for you 
A lonely fool above 
Just out of reach 
I could survive in these chemicals for you
Entombed to die
In catacombs of restless bones 
Consumed alive 
This is my home, I'm waiting here for you 

I say these blessings all for you 

Offer me 
I have the heart of a coward
Offer me
I have the heart of a coward
So open up my sternum 
The only constant is a crutch 
The only blessing that I know 

And if I lose myself
Blessed be, I could survive in these chemicals for you 
A lonely fool above 
Just out of reach 
I could survive in these chemicals for you
Entombed to die
In catacombs of restless bones 
Consumed alive 
This is my home, I'm waiting here for you
