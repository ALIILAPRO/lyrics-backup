		  (Pooh, you a fool for this one)
(Go Grizz)
The motherfuckin' biggest
I been puttin' belt to ass all summer
I feel like y'all bitches' mama, yeah

Bitch, I'm red, not green, lil' ho, stop playin' with me (stop it)
I hate borin' bitches, they be throwin' off my energy (Goddamn)
Stop callin' me sis, lil' ho, you know you ain't no kin to me (I don't know you)
I done dropped my nuts on all these bitches, yeah, I'm Himothy, real shit (I'm her)
Bitches love to hate, say it's fake, but I'm real thick (thick)
Nigga playin' cray, loose screw, I call Drill quick (brrt)
Always get my way, what can I say? I'm hard to deal with (what can I say?)
Leave that man today, either way, bitch, I'm still lit (either way)
I brought all my bitches with me, they ain't check me at the door (ooh)
I feel like the tin man, all this chrome head-to-toe (raw)
She been tweetin' like she tough, we gon' catch that ho outside
I told Brooke, "Get the balloons, we gon' throw her a surprise" (ayy)

It's a party, it's a party, it's a party, ayy (okay)
I got shots for all the opps, it's a holiday (grr)
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party, ayy (okay)
We gon' bring them sparklers out, time to celebrate (ayy)
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party, ayy (okay)
I got shots for all the opps, it's a holiday (grr)
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party, ayy (okay)
We gon' bring them sparklers out, time to celebrate (ayy)

Brrr
Damn, them niggas ain't had enough?
Every time they threw a party, came through that bitch sideways
Lil' bro rock Sheistys all year, got that bitch on when he bathe
And bitch, I'm Baby Drill, made my name off puttin' shit in the grave
Gravedigger, same nigga
Hop out with that flame, nigga (Baby Drill)
Drill just walked inside the party, got these niggas tuckin' chains
Latto said she spot an opp, she sent the drop, I'm on the way
Drill just beat another body, take a shot, let's celebrate
Twitter beef, don't do the back and forth, pull up shootin' for days
Broke-ass nigga rockin' Purple jeans, I can't take that boy serious
I got crosses on my back, fuck up and re-up just to get 'em
Saint Laurent all on my back, I put Chrome on my denim (Chrome)
Niggas actin' like they strapped, knowin' damn well they ain't no killers
They ain't search me at the door, I'm on my rapper shit
Glock bisexual, talkin' crazy, quick to smack a bitch
Industry scared of a nigga, don't know if I'm formin' that party, we spinnin' that bitch
I feel like Waka Flocka 'cause I just got the flame in here (ayy)

It's a party, it's a party, it's a party, ayy (okay)
I got shots for all the opps, it's a holiday (grr)
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party, ayy (okay)
We gon' bring them sparklers out, time to celebrate (ayy)
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party, ayy (okay)
I got shots for all the opps, it's a holiday (grr)
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party, ayy (okay)
We gon' bring them sparklers out, time to celebrate
