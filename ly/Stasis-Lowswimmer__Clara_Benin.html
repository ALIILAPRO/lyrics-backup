		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Face it, I don't hate this at all
It's all a facelift, deviated to a blur
Everything laced with all your
Favourite top notes
It's in the stasis, so belated it was known

‘Here in the world' through a microscope
An ear to the door like a domino
Have him go wild

It's in the spaces
In the shapes between the words
You can't reshape it, ascertain it anymore
‘cus I had hardly even been around
To be sated, to be doped
Largely hated, to be airlifted alone

Hearing it swirl through a telephone
Separate it all by a decimal have me go wild

And then it got loud and then I got out
The dope's in the house
He's never coming down

Face it, I won't waste it at all
It's in the spaces
In the breaks between worlds
