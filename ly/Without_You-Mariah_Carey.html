		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No I can't forget this evening or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows

No I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
Well I had you there but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know, ohh

I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore

Well, I can't forget this evening or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows

I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore

No I can't live
No I can't live

No no no no I 
No no no no I can't live

(No I can't live)
If living is without you
(No I can't live)
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live

No I can't live
No I can't live

Domo arigato

We're gonna bring out the choir now
Chapel of Hope choir
Give 'em a big hand please
And we're gonna sing for you
A song about believing in yourself
