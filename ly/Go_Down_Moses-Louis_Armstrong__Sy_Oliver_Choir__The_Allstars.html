		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go down Moses
Way down in Egypt land
Tell old pharaoh to
Let my people go

Now, when Israel was in Egypt land
Let my people go
Oppressed so hard they could not stand
Let my people go

So the Lord said "Go down, Moses
Way down in Egypt land
Tell old pharaoh to
Let my people go"

So Moses went to Egypt land
Let my people go
He made old pharaoh understand
Let my people go

Yes, the Lord said "Go down, Moses
Way down in Egypt land
Tell old pharaoh to
Let my people go"

Thus spoke the lord, bold Moses said
"Let my people go
If not I'll smite, your firstborn dead"
Let my people go

'Cause the Lord said "Go down, Moses
Way down in Egypt land
Tell old pharaoh to
Let my people go"

Oh
Way down in Egypt land
Tell old pharaoh to
Let my people go
