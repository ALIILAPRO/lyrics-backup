		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please forgive me (it's impossible to see)
If I appear unkind (it's impossible to know)
But any fool can tell you
It's all in your mind
Down in the meadow
The old lion stirs
Puts his hand 'cross his mouth
He has no use for words

Poor little girl
With your handful of snow
Poor little girl
Had no way to know

And you've got me eating
You've got me eating
You've got me eating
Right out of your hand

I mean you no harm (that's impossible to say)
When I tell you you're blind (it's impossible to know)
Give a sucker an even break
He'll lose it all, every time
The airborne starlings circle
Over the frozen fields
The hollyhocks hang harmlessly
And the old lion yields

But you've got me eating
You've got me eating
You've got me eating
Right out of your hand
You've got me eating
Right out of your hands
Got me eating
Right out of your hands
Got me eating
Right out of your hands babe
Got me eating
Right out of your hands
