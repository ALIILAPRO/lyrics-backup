LYRICS
VERSE 1:
You got to wash with the crocodile in the river
You got to swim with the sharks in the sea
You got to live with a crooked politician
Trust those things that you can never see
PRECHORUS:
I’ve been waiting for you all my life
I’ve been waiting for you all my life
I’ve been waiting for you all my life
Hoping for a miracle
I’ve been waiting day and night, day and night
CHORUS:
I’m searching for the spirit of the great heart
(mamma ye, a
wu beke mamma ye)
I’m searching for the spirit of the great heart
(mamma ye, awu beke mamma ye)
Sometimes I feel that you really know me
(mamma ye, awu beke mamma ye)
Sometimes there’s so much you can show me
(mamma ye, awu beke mamma ye)
VERSE 2:
You’ve got to trust your lover when you go away
Keep on believing tomorrow brings a better day
Sometimes you smile while you’re crying inside
Just once you’ll turn away while the truth is shining bright
PRECHORUS:
I’ve been waiting for you all my life
I’ve been waiting for you all my life
I’ve been waiting for you all my life
Hoping for a miracle
I’ve been waiting day and night, day and night
CHORUS:
I’m searching for the spirit of the great heart
(mamma ye, awu beke mamma ye)
I’m searching for the spirit of the great heart
(mamma ye, awu beke mamma ye)
Spirit of the great spirit of the great yeah
Sometimes I feel that you really know me
(mamma ye, awu beke mamma ye)
Sometimes there’s so much you can show me
(mamma ye, awu be
ke mamma ye)
So much you can show me
