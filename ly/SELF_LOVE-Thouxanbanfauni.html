		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Indigo okay, Embasin
Oh, oh, woah, woah, woah
34, double 0, TTB, ayy

Say you hate yourself, it's alright, baby
I could help
Give my love, give my love, shawty
That's top shelf
Watch over you like nobody,  not nobody else
I get anybody whacked, this a bet
You showing this tat, yeah
Not for me, shawty, I use it, shoot it
Don't abuse it
All for you, ooh, ooh, choosey
Don't be upset
Just looking out for your best interests
Feel like we done did this one hell a century
Ooh, Tokyo blue mixed with the neon pink
Rocking Murakami and that European mink
Japanese roses, German engineering
Euro, pound, princes, stack it up
Up to the ceiling
Your man, he a dog like, roof, roof
Come here lil' mama, I'm the big bad wolf
Wolf
You way too bad to be fucking with a fool
Fool
Proof's in the pudding, I'ma put you onto it
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
That heat, that fire scorch torch
Hit Memorial Road, kick a door
Moreland Ave I'm posted on the porch
Just hopped off of the porch
Nigga just hopped out a Porsche
Lights, camera, action, shoot
Hit a pussy for all his loot
Heights in my Polo boots ralph Lauren
Two lines, smoke that danko
Shawty dug deep in the gringo
Violate you, no though
Don't mess around with no skank hoes
She bad, her attitude stank though
Make a bitch walk that plank though
Yes, I'm a little too lit for your folks
Yeah, just live up and down, down and up
Baby, I could stack it from the ground up
Left, right, right, left
Drift the tires twisting spinning like Wyclef
Found, lost, lost, found
Bringing out them Bentleys and them bustdowns
Self, treat, treat my own self
Burberry, Fendi, Prada, BB Simon Belt
Him, her, her, him
Bitch, I got myself, so it's fuck all of them
All of them, it's fuck all of them
Bitch, I got myself, all of them
Fuck all of them, fuck all of them
Bitch, I got myself, so it's fuck all of them
All of them, all of them
Bitch, I got myself, so it's fuck all of them

All of them, all of them
All of them, all of them
All of them, all of them
All of them, all of them
