		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (If I got any whiskey)
(Cha, cha, cha)

If I could stick my pen in my heart
Spill it all over the stage
Would it satisfy you? Would it slide on by you?
Would you think the boy is strange? Ain't he strange?
If I could win you, if I could sing you
A love song so divine
Would it be enough for your cheating heart
If I broke down and cried? If I cried

I know it's only rock and roll, but I like it
I know it's only rock and roll, but I like it, like it, yes, I do
I like it, ah, said, I like it, oh, I like it
Can't you see that this old boy has been lonely?

Yeah, if I could stick a knife in my heart, suicide right on the stage
Would it be enough for your teenage lust
Would it help to ease the pain? Ease your brain
If I could dig down deep in my heart
Feelings would flood on the page
Would it satisfy you? Would it slide on by you?
Would you think the boy's insane? He's insane

(Said, I know) said I know it's only rock and roll, but I like it (ah)
I know it's only rock and roll, but I like it, like it, yes, I do
I like it, oh, I like it, yeah, I like it (come on)
Can't you see that this old boy has been lonely, woo

And do you think that you're the only girl around?
I bet you think that you're the only woman in town, oh

I know it's only rock and roll, but I like it
I said, I know it's only rock and roll, but I like it
I know it's only rock and roll, but I like it
Like it, yes, I do

I like it, oh, I like it, well, y'all know that I like it
Oh, I like it, oh, I like it, yeah, ooh, I like it
Yeah, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it (ah)

I know it's only rock and roll, but I like it
Ooh, I know it's only rock and roll, but I like it
I know it's only rock and roll, but I like it (yeah)
I know it's only rock and roll, but I like it (it's only rock and roll)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I know it's only rock and roll, but I like it
Yeah, I know it's only rock and roll, but I like it
I know it's only rock and roll, but I like it
