		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Suddenly the clouds have opened up
And I'm being seen in all of my glory
The time has come for fate to decide
If a part of me is even worthy
The air is warm, my heart is cold
And I'll never know how it feels
The air is warm, my heart is cold
And I'll never know how it feels
To have a heart of gold

I feel worthy somehow
Please, I don't want to go down, down
The new world is calling me now
Please don't let me go down, down
And I feel worthy somehow
Please don't let me go down, down
The new world is calling me now
Please don't let me go down, down

Just one step unto the lonely road
Has scarred me for life
No time to reflect as I was getting by
Getting by, enjoying life
The time has come for judgment day
And I'm standing here, begging you
Please take pity on me, take pity on me

I feel worthy somehow
Please, I don't want to go down, down
The new world is calling me now
Please don't let me go down, down
And I feel worthy somehow
Please don't let me go down, down
The new world is calling me now
Please don't let me go down, down

I feel so worthy right now
I don't want to go down now (I feel worthy right now)
I feel worthy right now (I've been waiting so long)
I feel so worthy (I feel worthy right now)
I feel so worthy
I feel so worthy
