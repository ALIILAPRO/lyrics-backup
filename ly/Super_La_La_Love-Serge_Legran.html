		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm glad to see your shining face
And to be back in our place
You told so many times
That I should change my mind
But I'm here to say goodbye

I thought it was super la-la-love
When I'm sleeping, I become so close
I thought it was super la-la-love
No, instead of lies I prefer the truth
I thought it was super la-la-love
When I'm sleeping, I become so close
I thought it was super la-la-love
Super la-la-love

I thought it was super la-la-love
I thought it was super la-la-love
I thought it was super la-la-love
I thought it was super la-la-love

I thought it was super la-la-love
When I'm sleeping, I become so close
I thought it was super la-la-love
No, instead of lies I prefer the truth
I thought it was super la-la-love
When I'm sleeping, I become so close
I thought it was super la-la-love
Super la-la-love

I'm glad to see your shining face
And to be back in our place
You told so many times
That I should change my mind
But I'm here to say goodbye

I thought it was super la-la-love
I thought it was super la-la-love
I thought it was super la-la-love
I thought it was super la-la-love
Super la-la-love

I thought it was super la-la-love
I thought it was super la-la-love
I thought it was super la-la-love
I thought it was super la-la-love
I thought it was super la-la-love
