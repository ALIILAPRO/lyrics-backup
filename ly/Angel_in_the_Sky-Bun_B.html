		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Chorus: x2]
There's an angel in the sky watching over me 

[Verse 1:]
They say its always darkest before the dawn 
And that you don't know what you had until it's gone 
I thought I knew what I had but I was wrong 
And thats why I gots to write this song now 
Come on now come on say man I thought it would of been a long time for us 
And many more years on the grind for us 
I thought the future held a lot for us both 
And it was brighter we were super tight 
But finna' be super tighter 
I guess I just assumed we had more time for us to make more music 
And write more rhymes 
But never in my life could I ever have seen 
That I would ever have to lose the other half of my team (for real) 
And take away the glitter the gold and the gleam 
Say man I wonder to myself what does it all really mean 
Nothing without the people you love say man I miss my brother 
But I know he's looking down from above 
And thats an angel

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 2:]
It all began on Shreveport Ave sittin' off in the den 
Making beats and puttin' paper to pen 
We was determined to win 
And you couldn't tell us different 
Mama West was cool with it 
But Monroe kept trippin'
It seems just like yesterday sometimes 
Sittin' in ya bedroom writing dumb rhymes 
Man you makin' beats on the insonic 
And we was smokin' dirt weed cause it wasn't no chronic 
I still remember when we started the crew 
It was me Mitchell Queen Jamal Jackson and you 
Started out as 4BM but then we ended with two 
Thats when we introduced the world to the U 
To the G tot the K Underground Kings DJ Byrd Pimp C 
And Bun B we kept it G say word 
Who would'a known back in 92 in 2008 
I'd have to write this song sayin' I miss you but its true

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 3:]
Just for the record let me go ahead and say 
I love my brother Pimp C 
And man I miss him everyday 
Yeah my heart still hurts 
And the pain still fresh 
But I'ma put God first 
To keep that pressure off my chest 
And remind me that I'm blessed to have had him as a friend 
A ride or die homie that was with me till the end 
Real talk man we was closer than kin 
And I know that I'll never have a partner like that again 
So Chad Butler I just want you to know I keep ya memory close I'm never lettin' it go 
And they gon' always remember that you was here mayne 
Cause I'ma make'em remember thats why I'm here mayne yeah it's still hard 
And I still cry but you and God keep me strong so I'ma still try 
Reppin' this UGK now won't I 
Cause through your music you live forever so, trill don't die

I know your watching over me
Last night I saw you in my dreams
At the crossroads ill see you there [x2]
My friend my brother till the end
Cant wait to see you again
Save a place in heaven for me [x2]

[Chorus: x2]
