		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This beat ain't normal

I dey call you no dey answer (oh no)
I say make I call you some more (yeah)
Yeah you leave me no choice, oh
Very soon I go appear for your doormat

And you had the tight dress on
When I saw you last night at the club
Even though I had my dark shades on
I was looking at you all night long

I'm in the middle of the street
How did I ever let you leave? Oh no
Why did I drink this Hennessy?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Girl I don't know what come over me
Girl I just want make we gum body
Don't want to lose you to nobody no
My God no go 'gree

And I don't know what come over you
As you see me so I no gbadu
I swear to God ige gbu madu, oh!
Ige gbu madu

No be small thing
It's something I've been watching
Am I just drunk or something?
Oh I'm in love, in love, in love, in love
Like a junkie
A junkie for your loving
I must be high or something
But now it doesn't really matter because

I'm in the middle of the street
How did I ever let you leave? Oh no
Why did I drink this Hennessy?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Girl I don't know what come over me
Girl I just want make we gum body
Don't want to lose you to nobody no
My God no go 'gree

And I don't know what come over you
As you see me so I no gbadun
I swear to God you dey gbadun ooh
You dey gbadun

I feel, I feel if I didn't I'd be without you, ohh
I can't take this chaos no more
I can't take those lies anymore
What's trying for me, was playing with you
Baby you're drunk and maybe I'm too

Baby you're a sufferer or a soldier
Care to have your own heart
If you treat me kind and kept me close
We'll always still part
Isn't easy with me
Drinking just loosen myself up from what
I kinda shouldn't be but

I'm in the middle of the street
How did I ever let you leave? Oh no
Why did I drink this Hennessy? Ay

Girl I don't know what come over me
Girl I just want make we gum body
Don't want to lose you to nobody no
My God no go 'gree

And I don't know what come over you
As you see me so I no gbadu
I swear to God you ige gbu madu, oh!
You ige gbu madu was
