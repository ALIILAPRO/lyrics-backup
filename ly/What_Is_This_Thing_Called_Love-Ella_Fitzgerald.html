		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?

I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw it away
That's why I ask the lord in heaven above
What is this thing called love?

I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw it away
That's why I ask the lord in heaven above
What is this thing called love?
