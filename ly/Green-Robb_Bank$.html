		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I might be happy
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Turn the beat up
Fuck off
Let's go, for real
Woop, woop, woop, woop, woop

Swear I dumped my 30 and I switched 'em all with queens 
(Woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop)
Call me king of hearts, 31, 17 (yuh)
(Woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop)
Young double cup, she whip the new double king 
(I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do)
I let it fly on her, let it fly on her 
(Slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt)

Red bitch, yellow bitch, black bitch, white bitch (ooh)
Freaky pussy said "Hi"
I think she was a Pisces (I do)
Hah, hah, hah (yuh), hah (yuh, yuh)
Hah (yuh), hah (yuh), hah (yuh), hah (yuh, SSET)

Green nigga, green sipper
My whole SSET like green bitches
Green weave, green slippers
And she drive a green Civic
I'm a red sipper, purp drinker 
Make yellow turn orange, nigga
Pocket full of blue hundreds, but I like green bitches 
(let's get it, let's get it, let's go)
Frog eyed coupe, gon' save more, put a red beam on his eye 
Now he Kano, yeah (grr)
Come here, taste my rainbow, red, purple, yellow, blue laces like Fabo 
(Grr, fuck 'em)
Like Diggy, black fitted, big bag, fourth-fifth, turn 9 to a 10 (phew)
Red Tech, pour a 6 (phew)
When green on these niggas (phew), now I'm looking like a check (phew)
Niggas say that they green (ay), I put it to test (I do, I do, SSET)
White iPhone X like I'm on Wall Street (uh uh)
Green hearted, I became what they call me
59 shades of grey, no Ruby
Sapphire crystals on the Pok√©mon neck piece (yuh)
A thousand dollar Phantom (yuh) make your bitch bend backwards (yuh)
Great ball, bitch, yeah, come to your master
Tired of breaking down the Great Wall, natural disaster (SSET)
Still husting, no time for cuddling, only for action (yeah, uh)
Dark green, lime green, my SSET, Doraah slime green (yeah)
Bleed green, cry green, my 430 teardrop gang (let's go)
Got a green Lamb with green bands, my new ring look like Greenland (SSET)
Green dot the green van, my SSET call me the green man (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Green heart (slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt), green, green, green 
(Double S the SSET, SSET)
Green, green (damn, we at your neck, neck), green, green 
(She gave me that wet, wet)
Green, green (green hearted, slatt, slatt, slatt), green, green 
(Double S, SSET, SSET)
Green (green hearted), green (want your neck, neck, shit)
Yuh, green (yeah, rah, rah, rah, SSET)

Green heart, green star, hop off out my green car 
Diamonds look like sea parks
Diamonds heavy, kilos
SSET, SSET, SSET the set
Bankroll must be taking neck (take it)
Dolce for my sneakers, check (my Dolce)
Triple sign, we invented that (yuh)
Stuff my checks in fanny packs, new devils
I'm just cuffing that (let's go)
Your nigga, he's not coming back
Forgive me, I might take if back
Yeah (let's go), yeah, forgive me
I might take if back (yeah, yeah, yuh)
I stuff my checks in fanny packs
Your nigga, he's not coming back (let's go)
Green heart

Red bitch, yellow bitch, black bitch, white bitch (ooh)
Freaky pussy said "Hi"
I think she was a Pisces (I do)
Hah, hah, hah, hah (what, what, what, what, what, what, what)
Hah, hah, hah, hah (what, what, what, what, what, what, ah)

YSL say "Slatt, slatt", double S say "SSET, SSET" (yuh)
Play, we at your neck, neck, she gave me that wet, wet (get it out)
YSL say "Slatt, slatt", double S say "SSET, SSET"
Play, we at your neck, neck, she gave me that wet, wet (ah, ah, ah)
