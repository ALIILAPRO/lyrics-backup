		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When all your demons die
Even if just one survives
I will still be here to hold you
No matter how cold you are
No matter how cold you are

I see the terror in your teardrop
Take your belief make it snow, let go
And wait together until we thaw

I don't wanna be another bullet hole
In the exit sign on your road
I don't wanna be another bullet hole
In the exit sign on your road

Just smile like a rifle
Hard metal in the setting sun
Just smile like a rifle
Hard metal in the setting sun

I was invited to eat the young
I was invited to eat the young

Starting, possession, symbolic firearms
In the bottomless celebrity scar
Starting, possession, symbolic firearms
In the bottomless celebrity scar

I don't wanna be another bullet hole
In the exit sign on your road
I don't wanna be another bullet hole
In the exit sign on your road

So just smile like a rifle
Hard metal in the setting sun
Just smile like a rifle
Hard metal in the setting sun

I was invited to eat the young
I was invited to eat the young

By the roadside, all the bones they clean
Dump gas in our machine
I will still be here to hold you
No matter how cold you are
No matter how cold you are

Cast out now, no fire to smell
Earth ain't up but sunk it even though my God
It seems like Saturnalia
Sat, sat, sat, sat, sat Saturnalia
Sat, sat, sat, sat, sat Saturnalia

There's no exit planet
No emergency room in this tomb
And it's door only opens one way

There's no exit planet
No emergency room in this tomb
And it's door only opens one way

Sat, sat, sat, sat, sat Saturnalia
Sat, sat, sat, sat, sat Saturnalia
Sat, sat, sat, sat, sat Saturnalia

We're blinded by blackness
We're just empty shells
In the deafening void of our last sunset

We're blinded by blackness
Just empty shells
In the deafening void of our last sunset
