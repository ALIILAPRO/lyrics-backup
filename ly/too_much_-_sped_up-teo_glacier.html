		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Guess I was just too much for you to handle
Not enough for you to stay
Now we cross paths like we strangers
But I don't wanna look at you that way
They say that it gets easier with time
But every time be hurting more than the last
It's okay I'll be fine
Guess good things never last, huh?
I wish we coulda held on a little longer
Wish we coulda tried
I wish I never had to let you go
But I guess that this is life
I wish I never knew
I wish we never grew apart
Wish you coulda stayed
I wish I coulda kept your love
Wish my wish would come true
Come through
But then again I'd be asking for too much
You told me that you got a lot to deal with
You said 'It's me it isn't you'
You said you couldn't tell me how you're feeling
Baby excuse me I don't mean to be rude
But if you wasn't ready for me why'd you tell me you was?
I guess I should've seen it coming I was blinded by love
But in the end it doesn't matter no more
It's time to let it go girl I'm sure
I wish we coulda held on a little longer
Wish we coulda tried
I wish I never had to let you go
But I guess that this is life
I wish I never knew
I wish we never grew apart
Wish you coulda stayed
I wish I coulda kept your love
Wish my wish would come true
Come through
But then again I'd be asking for too much
