		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's happens much too fast
The rain starts pouring
How long will it last
I walk around the bend
Another fear unsaid

And then
You called and you wondered how I've been
I told you I've been trying all my best
I knew it wasn't just in my head
That's life I guess

You give me another chance
Tell me I am the perfect friend
How do I give that back?
You wanna tell me that

And then
You called and you wondered how I've been
I told you I've been trying all my best
I knew it wasn't just in my head

That's life I guess
And then
You called and you wondered how I've been
I told you I've been trying all my best
I knew it wasn't just in my head
That's life, I guess
That's life, I guess
That's life, I guess
That's life, I guess
