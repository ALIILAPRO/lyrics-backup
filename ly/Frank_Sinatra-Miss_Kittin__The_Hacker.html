		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every night with my star friends
We eat caviar and drink champagne
Sniffing in the VIP area
We talk about Frank Sinatra
You know frank Sinatra?
He's dead.
Dead.

To be famous is so nice
Suck my dick
Kiss my ass
In limousines we have sex
Everynight with my famous friends

Nice.
Suck my dick.
Kiss my ass.
So nice.
VIP area.
Frank frank frank Frank Sinatra.

Motherfuckers are so nice
Suck my dick
Lick my ass
In the mix we have sex
Every night with my famous friends

Frank frank frank Frank Sinatra.
To be famous is so nice
Suck my dick
Kiss my ass
In the mix we have sex
Every night with my famous friends

Every night with my star friends
Shake your body like the dance
Stupid smiles and autographs
This is a song for frank
Shake your body like the dance
Stupid smiles and autographs
Every night with my star friends
In limousines we have sex

Motherfuckers are so nice
Suck my dick
Lick my ass
In the mix we have sex
Every night with my famous friends

Suck my dick.
