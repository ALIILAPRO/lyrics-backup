		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Finally found my way to get out
Finally found my place from the ground
This town ain't me I can tell
It's three strikes and I'm out of there, there, there

Running, running, running
I ain't slept in weeks
I've been following that breeze
I've been scraping my knees
I've been taking that leave
I've been running, running, running
I ain't slept in weeks
I've been lost in the streets
I've been found by the breeze
I've been weak in the knees
I've been running, running, running
Been running, running, running
Been running

Finally found my way to get out
Finally found that gold in my mouth
This place is holding me down
It's three strikes and I'm out of there, there, there

Running, running, running
I ain't slept in weeks
I've been following that breeze
I've been scraping my knees
I've been taking that leave
I've been running, running, running
I ain't slept in weeks
I've been lost in the streets
I've been found by the breeze
I've been weak in the knees
I've been running, running, running
Been running, running, running
Been running

Finally found my way to get out
Finally found my name on the crown
This town can't keep me around
It's three strikes and I'm out of here, here, here

Running, running, running
I ain't slept in weeks
I've been following that breeze (running)
I've been scraping my knees
I've been taking that leave (rum, run)
I've been running, running, running
I ain't slept in weeks
I've been lost in the streets
I've been found by the breeze
I've been weak in the knees
I've been running, running, running
Been running, running, running
Been running
