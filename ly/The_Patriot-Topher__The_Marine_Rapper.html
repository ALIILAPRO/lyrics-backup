		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My mother told me
Someday I would buy
Galleys with good oars
Sails to distant shores
Stand up high in the prow
Noble barque I steer
Steady course for the havens
Hew many foe-men
Hew many foe-men
Hew many foe-men

Tens of thousands on my right, thousands by my side
War between good and evil, watching our fists collide
Battle for our freedom now, to the streets we ride
Flags waving all around, patriots full of pride 
This is where we make a stand, no more give or take
March around the capitol, storm the city gates
Putting pressure on their necks until the truth breaks
All walls of corruption, take out all the snakes
Star spangled banner got it playing loud and proud
People from all walks of life filling up the crowd
Defend the constitution many warriors have vowed
Casting down any among us who have bucked and cowed
Enough with tyranny, we come to take our country back
For all citizens, white, red, brown, or black
Return her to her former glory, fix the bloody crack
On her crown.. Fetch your gown... it's going down like

My mother told me
Someday I would buy
Galleys with good oars
Sails to distant shores
Stand up high in the prow
Noble barque I steer
Steady course for the havens
Hew many foe-men

The Marine Rapper
My mama told me yeah she warned me that this day would come
I’m like my father go to combat with the blazing guns
I survived that then I came back to the place I’m from
To face off ALL these haters and to battle in the place I love
You can’t break me down, I’m indivisible
You’d still see my wraps, If I was invisible
But I’m standing tall, and I spit the truth
So you all appalled, cause you know it's true
They call it freedom cause the fallen troops paid for this
I love this country doesn’t matter how much hate I get
I take my colors into battle ain’t no wavering
Cause this is for my warriors who marching to them cadences
This is for the sisters working hard on the shift
This is for the brothers getting y’all doctorate
Fathers, yeah, taking y’all ownership
Baby tell me why it’s hard for The Patriot (cause)

My mother told me
Someday I would buy
Galleys with good oars
Sails to distant shores
Stand up high in the prow
Noble barque I steer
Steady course for the havens
Hew many foe-men
Hew many foe-men
Hew many foe-men
