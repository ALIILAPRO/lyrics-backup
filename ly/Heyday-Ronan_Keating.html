		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For the sun, for the light
For the ride, for the masters
Oh, we come to be kind
To be warm here and after
We've been out, but we're back
Because we're graced in these matters
And we'll rise

And we did a little love, but we walked
Make a sound for the messed up
Make a little call
To the right, to the ball
And to the mast-top
And we

We fool around now and again
We're looking good
But just as friends

This is our heyday, baby
We're not gonna be afraid to shout
'Cause we can make our heyday last forever
Ain't that what it's all about?
Oh living, in our own terrible way

And we lack a little love
But a sign, a sign to get a little messed up
Picking up the rules
For the chimes making up minds
And making it last us
'Cause we live alone, and now we've grown
And we know what we're after
And we'll rise

We fool around now and again
We're looking good
But just as friends

This is our heyday baby
We're not gonna be afraid to shout
'Cause we can make our heyday last forever
Ain't that what it's all about?

We fool around now and again
We're looking good
But just as friends

So we have ourself a break
And when we're done
And we come to our senses
And we'll rise
And we'll rise

This is our heyday, baby
This is our heyday, baby
This is our heyday, baby
Ain't that what it's all about?
Oh living, in our own terrible way
In our own terrible way

This is our heyday, baby
