		  Savin' up, now we're back in love city
Savin' up, now we're back in love city
Savin' up, now we're back in love city
Now we're back in love city

It's written in the stars and our cars have all been keyed
If you don't speak the language, it's impossible to read
Our destiny is waiting and our fate is on the phone
Saying, "don't forget your papers for the satisfaction zone"
Can't find the truth if you don't know where it grows
It's as rare as real pleasure and celebrities at shows
There are things I've never told you 'cause I haven't got the guts
But I hope it doesn't matter

Ready now, ready now
The world knows I'm in love with you
Ready now, oh

We can't buy love 'cause we spent it all on you
We can't buy love 'cause we spent it all on you
We can't buy love 'cause we spent it all on you
We can't buy love

So we're savin' up, now we're back in love city
Savin' up, now we're back in love city
Savin' up, now we're back in love city

I drink to drown my sorrows but they always learn to swim
Thank you very much, yes, I am a little thin
When I exorcise my demons, I just take 'em to the gym
But I hope it doesn't matter
Seven years sober, couldn't give you up for lent
So I never even questioned if your cookies had consent
I acted on an urge, now I sit here and lament
But I hoped it wouldn't matter

Ready now, ready now
The world knows I'm in love with you
Ready now, oh

We can't buy love 'cause we spent it all on you
We can't buy love 'cause we spent it all on you
We can't buy love 'cause we spent it all on you
We can't buy love

So we're savin' up, now we're back in love city
Savin' up, now we're back in love city
Savin' up, now we're back in love city

We can't buy love 'cause we spent it all on you
We can't buy love 'cause we spent it all on you
We can't buy love 'cause we spent it all on you
We can't buy love

So we're savin' up, now we're back in love city
Savin' up, now we're back in love city
Savin' up, now we're back in love city
Savin' up, now we're back in love city
Savin' up, now we're back in love city
Savin' up, now we're back in love city
