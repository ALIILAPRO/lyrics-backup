		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Good girl or bad girl
It's my world they're gonna talk about it
Do what they want and then fuck up and then they talk about it
I had to find my way out, had to find my way around it
And then I found it, now I never doubt it

Where are you, where did you go?
(Where did you go, where did you go?)
Wouldn't you like, like to know?
(You'd like to know, you'd like to know)

I've been on a holiday (sunshine)
I don't miss the bitter taste (sweet life)
Sittin' sippin' lemonade
I caught another wave, wave, wave

Not talking Bali, Hawaii, I got a private island
Inside my mind found a fantasy my own paradise, and
Unlocked a brand new perspective, direction, I'm learning lessons
Not missing exes or stressin', accepting nothing less

Where are you, where did you go?
(Where did you go, where did you go?)
Wouldn't you like, like to know?
(You'd like to know, you'd like to know)

I've been on a holiday (sunshine)
I don't miss the bitter taste (sweet life)
Sittin' sippin' lemonade
I caught another wave, wave, wave

I've been on a holiday
I don't miss the bitter taste, no, no
Sittin' sippin' lemonade
I caught another wave, wave, wave

(I've been on a holiday)
(I've been on a holiday)
