		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Days feel hard earned
Night grows longer
Summer says its goodbyes
And darkness covers
We find shelter
Our own place to hide

Oh
As the light goes out
Thoughts turn to angels
Over us
Oh
As the night comes in
Dreams start their drifting
And you hear
A lullaby

Ooooh
A lullaby
You and I

Trees touch windows
Say their hellos
We hear this house as it settles in
Worry slips away
It don't know your name
It don't know where to find us

Oh
As the light goes out
Thoughts turn to angels
All around us
Oh
As the night comes in
Dreams start their drifting
And we hear
A lullaby
A lullaby
You and I
You and I

Lullaby
Oooh
