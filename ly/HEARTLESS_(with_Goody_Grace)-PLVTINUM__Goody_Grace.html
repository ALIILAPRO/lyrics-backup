		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Took a trip on on molly
Shit was tantric
Blood on my Versace
That’s some mob shit
No, I’m not addicted, I can stop it
Flying off the handles
In the cockpit, watch it
Woah
Drop that motherfucker like a moshpit
If I want that Fendi
Imma cop it
Put her wrists in cuffs
I’m on some cop shit
Got a couple skellies in my closet, oh shit
I found heaven in the darkness
Fucking on the floor of your apartment
We were over when it started
I can’t give you more, cause I’m heartless

Verse 1
She drink what she bring
Sniff billie jean
Mini skirt, it’s ripped at the seam
A bad little ting
Ya, ya
Rinse and and repeat
It’s unsettling
Bring home a brand new
Girl every week
But I feel incomplete
Oh my god
Why she do me like that
I used to fall in love
But now I’m falling off track

Yeah yeah
I ain’t been calling you back

I’m calling on my demons
In the form of prozac

Chorus
(I swear I just)
Took a trip on on molly
Shit was tantric
Blood on my Versace
That’s some mob shit
No. I’m not addicted, I can stop it
Flying off the handles
In the cockpit, watch it

Woah

Drop that motherfucker like a moshpit
If I want that Fendi
Imma cop it
Put her wrists in cuffs
I’m on some cop shit
Got a couple skellies in my closet, oh shit
I found heaven in the darkness
Fucking on the floor of your apartment
We were over when it started
I can’t give you more, cause I’m heartless

Verse 2 (Goody Grace)
If you want some OG I can smoke some
You know we oz’s we aint running out
Laying next to her but miss my old one
Swear you’ll never see me while the sun is out
I found heaven in the darkness
In your West Hollywood apartment
Don’t know how it started
Trust me girl, I see you, we’re both broken
I give you my heart, but it’s frozen
You already know this

Chorus
Took a trip on on molly
Shit was tantric
Blood on my Versace
That’s some mob shit
No, I’m not addicted, I can stop it
Flying off the handles
In the cockpit, watch it
Baby
Drop that motherfucker like a moshpit
If I want that Fendi
Imma cop it
Put her wrists in cuffs
I’m on some cop shit
Got a couple skellies in my closet, oh shit
I found heaven in the darkness
Fucking on the floor of your apartment
We were over when it started
I can’t give you more, cause I’m heartless
