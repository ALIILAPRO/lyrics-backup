		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stand up in a clear blue morning 
Until you see 
What can be
Alone in a cold day dawning, 
Are you still free? 
Can you be?

When some cold tomorrow finds you,
When some sad old dream reminds you
How the endless road unwinds you ?

While you see a chance take it, 
Find romance fake it
Because it's all on you

Don't you know by now no one gives you anything
Don't you wonder how you keep on moving
One more day your way
When there's no one left to leave you,
Even you don't quite believe you
That's when nothing can deceive you

Stand up in a clear blue morning 
Until you see 
What can be
Alone in a cold day dawning, 
Are you still free? 
Can you be?

And that old gray wind is blowing
And there's nothing left worth knowing
And it's time you should be going
