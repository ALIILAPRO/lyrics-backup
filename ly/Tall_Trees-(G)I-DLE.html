		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Branches exploding
My leaves are golden stars, ah
Birds love to breeze by
Dogs come to see my bark, hmm-ah

My expectations stay on low
But you're the sun, you make them grow
If there's an axe behind your back, just let me know

'Cause tall trees fall hard, hard, hard, hard, hoo
Tall trees fall hard, hard, hard, hard, hoo
Tall trees fall hard, hard, hard, hard, hoo
Tall trees fall hard
So don't you break my

My trunk is filled with stuff for a picnic cart, hmm-ah
Flowers and grasses, careful with ashes, oh

My expectations stay on low
But you're the sun, you make them grow
If there's an axe behind your back, just let me know

'Cause tall trees fall hard, hard, hard, hard, hoo
Tall trees fall hard, hard, hard, hard, hoo
Tall trees fall hard, hard, hard, hard, hoo
Tall trees fall hard
So don't you break my

Don't you break my (heart, heart)
Don't you break my heart (heart)

'Cause tall trees fall hard, hard, hard, hard, hoo
Tall trees fall hard, hard, hard, hard, hoo
Tall trees fall hard, hard, hard, hard, hoo
Tall trees fall hard
So don't you break my (don't you break my)
