		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a lazy afternoon
And the beetle bugs are zoomin'
And the tulip trees are bloomin'
And there's not another human in view
But us two.

It's a lazy afternoon
And the farmer leaves his reapin'
In the meadow cows are sleepin'
And the speckled trout stop leapin' up stream
As we dream.

A fat pink cloud hangs over the hill
Unfoldin' like a rose
If you hold my hand and sit real still  
You can hear the grass as it grows.

It's a hazy afternoon
And I know a place that's quiet, 'cept for daisies running riot 
And there's no one passing by it to see
Come spend this lazy afternoon with me
