		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Life still happens when I close my eyes
How dare it leave me behind

The pressure has run its course
I don't think I can take this
The pressure has run its course
I don't think I can take this anymore

I plucked the pedals from all my roses
Leaving a pile of stems
I drain the beauty that's left in this world
Leaving myself condemned

All the trees now look the same
Leaves fall and expose the frame

I am trapped in the grasp
Of a memory
It crawls like water
Through the veins of the weak
Memory
Kept awake by the grinding of teeth

Trapped in the grasp of a memory

Peel back the skin
Everything dissolves inside
I cannot adjust
Alone in a room full of eyes
Nothing's built to last through this weather
I try so hard and nothing works
Put me back together

Resurrect
Put me back together

Resurrect
Put me back together

Fuck

Thorn in my side

Life still happens when I close my eyes
How dare it leave me behind
