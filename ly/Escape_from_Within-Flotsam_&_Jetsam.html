		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I lie here awake.
My lifeless body that's cold feeling the pain.
That's a cry far away.
Why is this prolonged, I've already lived, what's to fear.

Now kill the power, become partners of sin.
Alone in our decision to unlock the door,
And escape from within.
For only death is my life.
Escape from within.

From terminal living, cutting me, low in my prime.
Contract of death, silent screams beg to be signed.
You'll live the life of a saint as you decide,
Mercy kill to turn the tide.

Now kill the power, become partners of sin.
Alone in our decision to unlock the door,
And escape from within.
For only death is my life.
Escape from within.
Escape from within.

From terminal living, through the years I've laid alone.
Tubes through my body, there's no will to carry on.
You'll live the life of a saint as you decide,
Mercy kill to turn the tide.

Now kill the power, become partners of sin.
Alone in our decision to unlock the door,
And escape from within.
For only death is my life.
Escape from within.
Escape from within.
Escape from within.
