		  Uno dos tres cuatro

New J-Lo (good hit)
I got that (New J-Lo)
I got that good hit

La la la la (let's go)
La la la la (let's go)
La la la la (let's go)
La la la la (let's go)

Can I please have your attention?

I'm so dope from head to toe
Armed and big, I drop it low
On the ground, I put it down
Round and round yeah here we go

Push up on me, I'm on the floor
Talk up on it, make me yours
Give you my love, give me love back
Baby I'm here, where you at

Got that New York swagger, Miami bass
Got my California Loub's on, all up in your face
Yeah I'm mid-west pimp tight, Texas (fire)
Don't you want me to have your babies
Don't you wish I was your boo

I got that good hit
Don't you wish I was your boo
I got that good hit
Don't you wish I was your boo
I got that good hit
Don't you wish I was your boo
I got that good hit
Don't you wish I was your boo

Palms up yup call them up yup
Tell 'em that I got that gold buy me some Louis stuff
Buy me Gucci stuff yup that I Love Lucy stuff yup
Baby I'm a classic don't you wanna bag me

Don't you like my outfit looking all flashy
Don't you wanna love me up right in traffic?
All up in my bum bum tryin' to back back
I'm standing right here where you at

Got that New York swagger, Miami bass
Got my California Loub's on, all up in your face
Yeah I'm mid-west pimp tight, Texas (fire)
Don't you want me to have your babies
Don't you wish I was your boo

I got that good hit
Don't you wish I was your boo
I got that good hit
Don't you wish I was your boo
I got that good hit
Don't you wish I was your boo
I got that good hit
Don't you wish I was your boo

Baby
Don't you wanna put your hands on me
On me, on me, on me, oh
Baby, I can rock you like you can't believe
Believe, believe, believe, yo
I know you love you my swagger
I know you like my style
I know you like my hmm, mm
I make the boys go wild
I got you boo, relax
Baby, I am here where you at?

Got that New York swagger, Miami bass
Got my California Loub's on, all up in your face
Yeah I'm mid-west pimp tight, Texas (fire)
Don't you want me to have your babies
Don't you wish I was your boo

I got that good hit
Don't you wish I was your boo
I got that good hit
Don't you wish I was your boo
I got that good hit
Don't you wish I was your boo
I got that good hit
Don't you wish I was your boo

Up in the club with a lot of hair
