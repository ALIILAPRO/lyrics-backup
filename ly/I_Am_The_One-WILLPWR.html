		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Welcome to the centerstage
Watch me when I demonstrate
Answer this
Whats a feather weight to a renegade
Pitiful
Who'd a thought I'd make it to the city lights
Listen up
Stay up out my lane that's some big advice
Write it down
Take a second
You gotta deal with it
Never lie, true vibe, I keep it real with it
Trust that, get a bag, its like im field trippin
Cleats on, to the dirt, I'm in the field with it
 
If you tryna have a war it's a war zone
Gatekeepers always tryna keep the door close
I'm movin' to the beat of my own drum
 
Cuz I am the one
 
Treat it like its dinner time
Lookin like its winner time
Even on my worst day, you can tell im still a vibe
Big pop
Dawg I been notorious im glorious
Run it up
Know I got the drive and I'm floorin' it
Catch me with the stars got me lookin like a horoscope
Never take a loss, that's a lesson, i got more to go
Automatic when I'm on I got you scared straight
If I'm ever not on point, that's a rare day
Never panic level up I'm on a staircase
War paint I ain't movin' here with a bare face
 
If you tryna take a shot show sum
Know my roots stand my ground don't run
Try your best but it won't be enough
 
I'm the one I'm the one I'm the one
 
Only thing I look up to is the sun
Bout the gains put in work for the funds
Through the pain come in first get it done
 
Cuz I am the one
