		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Behold the joy of children
Behold the joy of men
Behold the burning circle
That never has an end
Through falling leaves and winter snow
The sun will visit those below
And warm the Netherworld will be
But it's not there that you'll find me
Behold the joy of children
Behold the joy of men
Behold the burning circle
That never has an end
Through spring meadows and summer sky
The sun will shine on you and I
For we are young and dance around
Bonfires shining above ground
Behold the joy of children
Behold the joy of men
Behold the burning circle
That never has an end
Whether in this life or the next
Even after sunset in the west
The light will return from high above
For it is my heart and you are my love
