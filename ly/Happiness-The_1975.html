		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Confidence is comical
And I'm, and I'm happy
That's what I like
I'm happiest when I'm doing something that I know is good
That's happiness for me
I'm happiest when I'm doing something that I know is good
That's happiness for me

She showed me what love is
I'm actin' like I know myself
Oh, in case you didn't notice
Oh, oh, I would go blind just to see you
I'd go too far just to have you near
In my soul, I've got this feeling, I
Didn't know until I seen ya

My, my, my, oh, my, my, my
You mind my mind, you mind my mind
Oh, my, my, my, you mind my mind
Oh, my, my, my
She's insatiable is what she is

Her body's like a modern art
Take it out in front of me
I've gotta stop messin' it up because I'm
Feelin' like I'm messin' it up
Because I'm callin' out your name and God help me
'Cause, oh, I'm never gonna love again, hey
I'm never gonna love again, hey, oh

Show me your love
Why don't you grow up and see?
Show me your love
Why don't you grow up and see?
Show me your love
Why don't you grow up and see?
Show me your love
Why don't you?

You met me at the right time
Met me at the right time, oh
Show me your love, why don't you?
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Confidence is comical
And I'm, and I'm happy
That's what I like
I'm happiest when I'm doing something that I know is good
That's happiness for me

She showed me what love is (showed me what love is)
Now I'm actin' like I know myself (actin' like I know myself)
Oh, in case you didn't notice (ooh-ooh)
Oh, oh, oh, I'm never gonna love again, hey
I'm never gonna love again, hey, oh

Show me your love
Why don't you grow up and see?
Show me your love
Why don't you grow up and see?
Show me your love
Why don't you grow up and see?
Show me your love
Why don't you?
