		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm killing myself
But you're falling for somebody else you knew before
You said you were friends, I knew it was more
All of the signs I try to ignore

If I tell you I'm leaving, would you come clean?
I won't tell you I'm done, baby, stay with me

Had I known that you needed him
From the way that you looked at me
I'd never have let you leave
I'd have been on my knees
Oh, I'm falling now
'Cause you can't be found
When I'm missing you
It's a lonely room

Am I just a man you don't want around?
Someone you regret, something you've drowned
And all of our friends, at least they turned up
While you turned your back, I thought we'd grown up

If I tell you I'm leaving, would you come clean?
Don't you tell me you're done, baby, stay with me

Had I known that you needed him
From the way that you looked at me
I'd never have let you leave
I'd have been on my knees
Oh, I'm falling now
'Cause you can't be found
When I'm missing you
It's a lonely room

Would you let me love you, darling? (Would you let me love you?)
Would you let me love you now? (Would you let me love you?)
Would you let me love you, darling? (Would you let me love you?)
Would you let me love you now?

Had I known that you needed him (would you love me, darling?)
From the way that you looked at me
I'd never have let you leave (would you love me, darling?)
I'd have been on my knees
Oh, I'm falling now (I'm falling now)
'Cause you can't be found ('cause you don't be found)
When I'm missing you (when I'm missing you)
It's a lonely room
