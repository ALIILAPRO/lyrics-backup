		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once again we hear them calling for war
It doesn't matter what they're fighting for
They light the match and watch the whole world burst into flame
The story's always the same
So tell me people are you ready to kill?
Behold the propaganda, get your fill
A distant enemy is threatening our freedom again
How much would you like to spend?

Millions are falling in line
And it's just a matter of time
Endless destruction will ensure their pockets are lined
For all time

No more defending the lies
Behind the never ending war
It's time to make them realize
We will no longer be their whore
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more

They don't care about the blood on their hands
Look at the world and you will understand
They count the money as the innocent continue to bleed
They're always planting the seed
So tell me people are you ready to die?
We're not believing in the reason why
The paint a picture and the whole damn world is deceived
It's all that they ever need

Millions keep falling in line
It's only a matter of time
Sowing destruction will make sure their pockets are lined
For all time

No more defending the lies
Behind the never ending war
It's time to make them realize
We will no longer be their whore
No more defending the lies
Behind the never ending war
It's time to make them realize
We will no longer be their whore

No it can't be disguised anymore
How they smile as we pay for their war

No more defending the lies
Behind the never ending war
It's time to make them realize
We will no longer be their whore
No more defending the lies
Behind the never ending war
It's time to make them realize
We will no longer be their whore
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more
