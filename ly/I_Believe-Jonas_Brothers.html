		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every night, every day, how about every lifetime?
Yeah, I know what they say, and that's fine
'Cause I'm here to stay through the good and the bad times
Baby, save me to space in you're mind, yeah

Call me crazy
And people saying that we move too fast
But I've been waiting, and for a reason
Ain't no turning back

'Cause you show me something I can't live without
I believe, I believe, I believe
When you hold me, it's like Heaven coming down
I believe, I believe, I believe

That you show me (show me, show me)
That you show me (show me, show me)

Everywhere that I go, feeling you all around me
Now that I got you close, I'm alright
Baby, I didn't know, but I'm glad that you found me
'Cause I'm seeing the most in your eyes, oh yeah, yeah

Call me crazy
People saying that we move too fast (too fast)
But I've been waiting for a reason
Ain't no turning back

'Cause you show me something I can't live without (ah yeah)
And I believe, I believe, I believe
When you hold me (hold me)
It's like Heaven coming down (mmm, yea-yeah)
I believe, I believe, I believe

That you show me (show me, show me), you show me
That you show me (show me, show me), you show me

Doesn't matter anymore, now I got you here with me
Nothing matters any longer, now I got you here with me
I think about you every time I, every time I lose myself again
I lose myself again

'Cause you show me something I can't live without
I believe, I believe, I believe
When you hold me, it's like Heaven coming down
I believe, I believe, I believe
'Cause you show me something I can't live without (oh yeah)
I believe, I believe, I believe
When you hold me (when you hold me)
It's like Heaven coming down
I believe, I believe, I believe

'Cause you show me (something I can't live without)
That you show me (show me, show me), no
No (and I believe, I believe, I believe)
(When you hold me, it's like) Heaven coming down
(That you show me, show me) show me, show me
I believe, I believe, I believe

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Yeah
