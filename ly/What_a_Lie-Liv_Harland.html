		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Does she look better?
Does she laugh harder?
Does she make you feel the same?
Does she buy you flowers, the same that were ours
cnd sit with you watching the rain?
'Cause I've been asleep for forever it seems now I'm finally waking up
cnd I saw you out and you both turned around and you walked away
So I hope you find
The one that you're looking for
I, I guess it was all in my mind
I thought it was me, what a lie, oh
cnd I hope you go
To places we were gonna go
Now I get to go there alone
I thought it was me, what a lie
Oh, what a lie
Is her hair longer?
cnd is her heart stronger?
Does she hold your hand in the car?
Do you tell her secrets? You told me you'd keep them
You told me that they're only ours
'Cause I've been asleep for forever it seems now I'm finally waking up
cnd I saw you out and you both turned around and you walked away
So I hope you find
The one that you're looking for
I, I guess it was all in my mind
I thought it was me, what a lie, oh
cnd I hope you go
To places we were gonna go
Now I get to go there alone
I thought it was me, what a lie
Oh, what a lie
Someone pick me up
Now I've drunk too much
cnd my body can't take that I'm not the one
I don't wanna cry
I just wanna be right
So I hope you find
The one that you're looking for
I, I guess it was all in my mind
I thought it was me, what a lie, oh
cnd I hope you go
To places we were gonna go
Now I get to go there alone
I thought it was me, what a lie
Oh, what a lie
