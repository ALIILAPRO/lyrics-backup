(Great John on the beat, by the way)
I'm about to deadass record you, you heard
I'm 'bout to put y'all niggas in the track
I love you too, bro
Aight say that
Look, look

We ain't ever goin' dwell on a mistake, huh
Run it up, and we get back to it, huh
Never seen these days, huh
And of course, my dreams got stolen
My dreams are dead in them cells, but I'm here now
Felt like my dreams are dead in them cells, but I'm here now, huh, look

Stuck on probation and all that, huh
Can't take vacations and all that
Sometimes you hit then you miss like a Rover
I play the game with the sticks like controller
They gon' hate, but it's all good, huh
Jealousy and it's all good, huh
Know they prayin' on my downfall, huh
In my hood I'm a mogul
But don't try to test me, nigga
Don't want that X-D, nigga
"How you stay focused?" They ask me, nigga
I say, "That breesh, nigga"
'Cause we gettin' money, please do not act like you know me
I ain't your bro, don't you bro me, huh
I need it all, can you show me?
The sweet life but no Zack and Cody
Flips that we made in the trap
I done lost packs, took risks, made it back
Used to all laugh when I said, "I'ma rap"
Now they hear my track and they say, "Run it back," yeah
They ain't believe in a nigga, huh
No, they ain't believe in a nigga (they ain't believe in a nigga)

We ain't ever goin' dwell on a mistake, huh
Run it up and we get back to it, huh
Never seen these days, huh
And of course, my dreams got stolen
My dreams are dead in them cells, but I'm here now
Felt like my dreams are dead in them cells, but I'm here now, huh, look
We ain't ever goin' dwell on a mistake, huh
Run it up and we get back to it, huh
Never seen these days, huh
And of course, my dreams got stolen
My dreams are dead in them cells, but I'm here now
Felt like my dreams are dead in them cells, but I'm here now, huh, look

Stuck on probation and all that, huh
Can't take vacations and all that
Sometimes you hit then you miss like a Rover
I played the game with the sticks like controller
They gon' hate, but it's all good, huh
Jealousy and it's all good, huh
Know they're prayin' on my downfall
