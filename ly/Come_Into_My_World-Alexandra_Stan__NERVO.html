		  Da-da, oh, oh-oh-oh

Late luck, where you been?
I travel 'round and I've seen what I've seen
A dirty love, fit for a queen
And that's the way I like it (like it)

Come away, yeah
We might not get the chance, not ever again
Don't you wanna fly?
Come away, yeah
It doesn't have to end if you don't know what I'm saying

Come and take a hit, see if you like it
I'm not gonna say that it won't hurt
But I can tell you now that you're invited
To come into my world
Yeah, come into my world

Take a chance, roll the dice
You got me here and I'm paying the price
I've given in, my hands are tied
And that's the way I like it

Come and take a hit, see if you like it
I'm not gonna say that it won't hurt
But I can tell you now that you're invited
To come into my world
Yeah, come into my world

Baby, I am here, yeah, I'm excited
Tell 'em 'til the cops come shut us down
We're burnin' out the place the way we like it
And they can't stop us now, no, they can't stop us now

Come away, yeah
We might not get the chance, not ever again
Don't you wanna fly?
Come away, yeah
It doesn't have to end if you don't know what I'm saying

Come and take a hit, see if you like it
I'm not gonna say that it won't hurt
But I can tell you now that you're invited
To come into my world
Yeah, come into my world
