		  Allright, let's do this 

1, 2, 3, 4

I want a cup that overflows with love, although
It's not enough to fill my heart
I want a barrel full of love, altough I know,
It's not enough to fill my heart
I want a river full of love, but then I know
The holes will still remain
I need an ocean full of love, although I know
The holes will still remain

And this Swiss cheese-heart knows, only kindness can fill its holes
Love can dry my tears, as pain disappears

I need a miracle and not someone's charity
One drop of love from him and my heart's in extacy
The high that is sending me is most likely ending me
I need a miracle and not someone's charity now

Fill up my heart with love, boy you'd be amazed at how
Little I need from him to feel complete here and now
Stirring within me are these feelings I can't ignore
I need a miracle and that's what I'm hoping for

I need a miracle and not someone's charity
One drop of love from him and my heart's in extacy
The high that is sending me is most likely ending me
I need a miracle and not someone's charity now

Oh babe, babe
My babe

Anybody's love but his will never fill this space within me
Now doctor give me what I need to free my heart from miseryyy~
