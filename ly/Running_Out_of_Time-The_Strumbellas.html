		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somebody told me
Years don't go by slowly
Am I running out of time
Am I running out of time

When I was young there were summer days 
they lasted all night long
I always thought I'd never change
Then, one day time was gone

Maybe in the bitter cold 
Maybe I lost it all
How I'm ever gonna hang on

Somebody told me
Years don't go by slowly
Am I running out of time
Am I running out of time
The days get so lonely
Years don't go by slowly
Am I running out of time
Am I running out of time

Trying to hold on to the glory days
All the rights that turned out wrong
As long as there's blood running through my veins
I'll be riding on till dawn

Waiting on the end I know
How we come and go
Gotta try to hang on

Somebody told me
Years don't go by slowly
Am I running out of time
Am I running out of time
The days get so lonely
Years don't go by slowly
Am I running out of time
Am I running out of time


These hands keep ticking over
I'm wasted but I'm sober 
Keep stumbling to find the words to say 

These hands keep ticking over
Wasted but I'm sober 
Keep Tryna make things right again

Somebody told me
Years don't go by slowly
Am I running out of time
Am I running out of time
Somebody told me
Years don't go by slowly
Am I running out of time
Am I running out of time
The days get so lonely
Years don't go by slowly
Am I running out of time
Am I running out of time
