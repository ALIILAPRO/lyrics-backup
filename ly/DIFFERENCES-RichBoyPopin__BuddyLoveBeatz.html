		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Make my life complete (You make my life complete)
You are so sweet (Yes, you did, baby), no one competes(No one competes, oh)
Glad you came into my life Glad you came into my life
You blind me with your love I'ma try to sing it (Come on), with you I have no sight

My whole life has changed
When you came through and helped me fix my mistakes (Woah, Hey)
My  whole life has changed (Ohh)
I stop waking up and hating they world that I'm awake
My whole life has changed
And that change started with you
My whole life has changed, complete
And my whole wife den' saved me

-Make my life complete (You make my life complete)
You are so sweet (Yes, you did, baby), no one competes(No one competes, oh)
Glad you came into my life
You blind me with your love (Come on), with you I have no sight

Threw way my shades
I need to see your rays when you send your love my way
A smile comes onto my face when I say that you my bae
I N-E-E-D you, okay?
My whole life has changed for the better
You changed the way I look at life like it's the weather
What's the forecast
I'ma deliver my love to your door like it's do or dash

But I'm not dashing the doors
You're the only door I wanna knock on
So answer
Knock, knock, say who's there
I'm the one, m the one who, I'm the one for you
Maybe we are forever
I don't ever wanna hear we for never
Trying to make this work, I hope you see my effort
It's still wor

My whole life has changed
When you came through and helped me fix my mistakes (Woah, Hey)
My  whole life has changed (Ohh)
I stop waking up and hating they world that I'm awake
My whole life has changed
And that change started with you
My whole life has changed, complete
And my whole wife den' saved me

Make my life complete (You make my life complete)
You are so sweet (Yes, you did, baby), no one competes(No one competes, oh)
Glad you came into my life [Glad you came into my life]
You blind me with your love[I'ma try to sing it (Come on), with you I have no sight
