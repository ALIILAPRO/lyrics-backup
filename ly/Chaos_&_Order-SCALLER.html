		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the sun's up
You will see me through
When the world is a lie
You don't know why
When no one's to blame
It's on you
Then you'll find yourself
Telling to yourself

I'm a chaos in your order
I'm a monster under your bed
I'm the underworld of a fairytale
I'm the dragon that you're trying to slay

When the light's on
You won't see me through
I'm a shadow
I've been following through

When you're lost your way
You have only you
Then you'll find yourself
Telling to yourself

I'm a chaos in your order
I'm a monster under your bed
I'm the underworld of a fairytale
I'm the dragon that you're trying to slay

When the light's on
You will see me through
When the world is a lie
You don't know why
When no one's to blame
It's on you
Then you'll find yourself
Then you'll find yourself

I'm a chaos in your order
