		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know
That it's taken me all this time to say girl
I'm slow
So it's taken me all this time to say girl
Tip toe
And I want to acknowledge my mistake girl
Uh oh
And I hope that you know it's not too late

Put it in my pocket
Put it in my pocket
In my back pocket
Put it in my pocket
In my pocket
In my back pocket
Oh oh oh
And I'll
Put it in my pocket
Put it in my pocket
In my back pocket
Put it in my pocket
In my pocket
In my back pocket
And I'll read it when I'm alone

Do you like me? Circle yes or no
On this piece of paper
'Cause I really really need to know
Are you gonna be my fifth grade queen?
Hand it back after second hour
Then I will know if you're gonna be my special flower
Ooh girl, 'cause I need to know
I will

Put it in my pocket
Put it in my pocket
In my back pocket
Put it in my pocket
In my pocket
In my back pocket
Oh oh oh
And I'll
Put it in my pocket
Put it in my pocket
In my back pocket
Put it in my pocket
In my pocket
In my back pocket
And I'll read it when I'm alone

When you kissed me on the playground
I lost my breath, I had to lay down
And assess what I had seen
Then I had to write the words out
'Cause you took them out of my mouth
But it's hard for me to read
Out loud
Oh gee
Oh gosh

I know
That it's taken me all this time to say, girl
I'm slow
So it's taken me all this time to say, girl
Tip toe
And I want to acknowledge my mistake, girl
Uh oh
And I hope that you know it's not too late, girl
I know
That it's taken me all this time to say, girl
I'm slow
So it's taken me all this time to say, girl
Tip toe
And I want to acknowledge my mistake, girl
Uh oh
And I hope that you know it's not too late
