		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, got the sun setting down on the grass and the yard
Got my head on your shoulder and my hand on your heart
Watchin' the barefoot babies laughin' and pickin' daisies
Catchin' the fireflies in a jar

This is as good as it gets, I don't know what I would change
I love this life that we live, I love that smile on your face
No, we ain't gotta look back at all those pictures in frames
And wish it all stayed the same
'Cause right here, right now I say these are the glory days

It's a first sip of coffee in a quiet house
It's bible verses in the kitchen like it's holy ground
Livin' right don't cost a thing, it's the slow roll of a porch swing
It's dogs runnin' while the birds sing
It's you picking that six string

This is as good as it gets, I don't know what I would change
I love this life that we live, I love that smile on your face
No, we ain't gotta look back at all those pictures in frames
And wish it all stayed the same
'Cause right here, right now I say these are the glory days
Ooh, these are the glory days

This is as good as it gets, I don't know what I would change
I love this life that we live, I love that smile on your face
No, we ain't gotta look back at all those pictures in frames
And wish it all stayed the same
'Cause right here, right now I say these are the glory days

Oh, yeah, right here, right now I say these are the glory days
Oh, these are the glory days
