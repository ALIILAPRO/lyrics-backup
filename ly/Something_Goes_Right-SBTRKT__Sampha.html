		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, something goes right,
Yeah, something goes right,
Yeah something goes right
And you're hoping that it goes right 
That it goes right, that it goes right

You wouldn't even know, you wouldn't even care,
You wouldn't even know, you wouldn't even care
I've been there though, I've been there though 
I've been there though-oh

Standing in a dream world, sitting next to you, 
Up in the clouds, up up in the clouds, up up in the clouds
Sitting on the edge, looking down at the earth
Looking up into space, up up into space, up up into space

Is it better to let you go?
Or is it better to let you know?
You should t-t-t-take it, you should t-t-t-take it back

Is it better to let you go?
Or is it better to let you know?
You should t-t-t-take it, you should t-t-t-take it back

I've only got myself self self to blame
Love something thinking things will never change
These feelings probably will still still remain, I was always hurt

And I've been feeling like this most most of my life whoa
I've been feeling like things ain't gonna change
Things ain't gonna get it back?

Is it better to let you go?
Or is it better to let you know?
You should t-t-t-take it, you should t-t-t-take it back

Is it better to let you go?
Or is it better to let you know?
You should t-t-t-take it, you should t-t-t-take it back

I keep on having these conversations and p-p-p-praying
I keep on staring at these constellations and p-p-p-praying
And these bitter thoughts that keep on escaping
I wish that they were staying and something would go right 
Go right, and something will go right, go right

Don't you bring me down
Don't you bring me down
Don't you bring me down

Don't you bring me down
Don't you bring me down
Don't you bring me down

Is it better to let you go?
Or is it better to let you know?
You should t-t-t-take it, you should t-t-t-take it back

Is it better to let you go?
Or is it better to let you know?
You should t-t-t-take it, you should t-t-t-take it back

Yeah, something goes right,
Yeah something goes right
Yeah something goes right
And you're hoping that it goes right
That it goes right, that it goes right oh

You wouldn't even know, you wouldn't even care
You wouldn't even know, you wouldn't even care
I've been there though, I've been there though
I've been there though-oh

Standing in a dream world, sitting next to you, 
Up in the clouds, up up in the clouds, up up in the clouds
Sitting on the edge, looking down at the earth
Up into space, up up into space, up up into space
