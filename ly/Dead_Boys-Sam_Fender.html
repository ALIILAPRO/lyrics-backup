		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The anniversaries are short lived
But they come back around at a breakneck speed
My world spins so fast
The centrifugal force keep me stuck in the middle

We close our eyes, learn our pain
Nobody ever could explain
All the dead boys in our hometown
We close our eyes, learn our pain
Nobody ever could explain
All the dead boys in our hometown
All the dead boys in our hometown

We all tussle with the black dog
Some out loud and some in silence
Everybody 'round here just drink
'Cause that's our culture

We close our eyes, learn our pain
Nobody ever could explain
All the dead boys in our hometown
We close our eyes, learn our pain
Nobody ever could explain
All the dead boys in our hometown
All the dead boys in our hometown

(Oh)
(Oh)
(Oh)
(Oh)

We close our eyes, learn our pain
Nobody ever could explain
All the dead boys in our hometown
We close our eyes, learn our pain
Nobody ever could explain
All the dead boys in our hometown

All the dead boys in our hometown
All the dead boys in our hometown
All the dead boys in our hometown
All the dead boys in our hometown
All the dead boys in our hometown
All the dead boys in our hometown
All the dead boys in our hometown
All the dead boys in our hometown
