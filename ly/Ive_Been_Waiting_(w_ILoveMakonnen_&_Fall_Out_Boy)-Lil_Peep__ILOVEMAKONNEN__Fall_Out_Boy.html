		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whoa, yeah

I've been waiting (I've been waiting)
I've been waiting up
'Cause I can't get enough, oh
I feel I'm fading (yeah)
When I fall apart
Your needle sews my heart, oh

Fuck me up and make me just go crazy
Addicted to the pain that you just made me love
I'm fiendin' for your touchin' on the daily
You're the only one that I want

Break my heart but don't tell me I'm not doin' fine
'Cause I'm doin' fine
Let me go, I'm spendin' time
Not doin' fine but I'm doin' fine

Why you actin' vain for my love, vain for my love
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain for my blood, vain for my blood
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin'?

I've been dreamin' (uh)
Of your uniform
Your uniform of non-conformity
The tears, the tears
Tears aren't strong enough
The years aren't long enough, no

Fuck me up and make me just go crazy
Addicted to the pain that you just made me love (whoa, yeah)
I'm fiendin' for your touchin' on the daily
You're the only one that I want (yeah)

Break my heart but don't tell me I'm not doin' fine
'Cause I'm doin' fine
Let me go, I'm spendin' time
Not doin' fine but I'm doin' fine

Why you actin' vain for my love, vain for my love
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain for my blood, vain for my blood
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain?

It's hard to miss you
When you are always on the tip of my tongue, now
I feel like I'm looking for somethin'
Somethin' that'll never come

Call me when you're in the city again
My head just went oblivion
It's hard to miss you
When you are always on the tip of my tongue
(Always on the tip of my tongue)

And now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrong
Now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrong
When I've been waitin' (I've been waitin')
Long for you (long for you)

I wanna drink my wine, I wanna pass that by
I wanna make her cry, she wanna make me die
Apple pie, six cigarettes
And I'll catch the vibe that we can't forget

Why you actin' vain for my love, vain for my love
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain for my blood, vain for my blood
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain?

It's hard to miss you
When you are always on the tip of my tongue
I feel like I'm looking for somethin'
Somethin' that'll never come

I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)
Oh, for you (I'll be waiting) (for you)
And now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrong (I'll be waiting)
And now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrong (for you)
