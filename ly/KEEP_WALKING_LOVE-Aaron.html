		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And sometimes reality's biting
Its blade roomed in the backbone of your dreams
Your polished shoes move your blurred lines
You're seeking peace with the wrong eyes

Stretch your arms above the ground
This shadow cross needs all your praise
Whole life is 30,000 days
And there's a reason for your gnawed nails

Keep walking, love
Keep walking, love, you're a poem on feet
The world is the ink into which your steps will dip
The prints that you'll leave at the end of the day
Will pave the road for the next poem I'll say

And there the sun is like a red match
Standing at dusk and ready to be struck
You stand alone on the day's rim
Lonely just like a stray dog's barking

You, once solid as the summer light
You, once sharpened as the teenage eye
You now cut by words, like cut by knives
You extend the solitude of skies

Keep walking, love
Keep walking, love, you're a poem on feet
The world is the ink into which your steps will dip
The prints that you'll leave at the end of the day
Will pave the road for the next poem I'll say

Keep walking, love
Keep walking, love
Keep walking, love

You, once solid as the light
You, once sharpened as the teenage eye
You, once solid as the light
Keep walking, love
You, once sharpened as the teenage eye

Keep walking, love
Keep walking, love, you're a poem on feet
The world is the ink into which your steps will dip
The prints that you'll leave at the end of the day
Will pave the road for the next poem I'll say

Keep walking, love
Keep walking, love
Keep walking, love
Keep walking, love
