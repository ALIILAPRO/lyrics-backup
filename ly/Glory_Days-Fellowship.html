		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As the light within me falls, another day departs
If only I could see the dawn beyond the shadows cast
An empire of doubt, a heart full of clouds, befall the souls within her
The valley will weep as a mirror of old, as hope is halfway damned

Oh, to see our last day with all these shattered voices raised
Oh say, will you fight?

To seek the glory days
We'll fight the lion's way
Then let the rain wash all of our pride away
So if this victory
Is our last odyssey
Then let the power within us decide!

On the backs of giants long deceased are we still standing
We measure our worth by all the days we wasted then
All of our time, and all of our might, are fueled by the heartache of winter
Oh life as we know it is bitter and cold, but souls burn best with spite

Oh, to see our last day with all these shattered voices raised
Oh say, will you fight?

To seek the glory days
We'll fight the lion's way
Then let the rain wash all of our pride away
So if this victory
Is our last odyssey
Then let the power within us decide!

If we have to choose our fate
It's still our choice to make!

Oh, to see our last day with all these shattered voices raised
Oh say, will you fight?

To seek the glory days
We'll fight the lion's way
Then let the rain wash all of our pride away...
To seek the glory days
We'll fight the lion's way
Then let the rain wash all of our pride away
So if this victory
Is our last odyssey
Let the power within
Ignite where we've been
Let the power within us decide!
