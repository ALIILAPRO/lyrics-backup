		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All I can wish all I can do for your heart 
Night after night Every time I'll be by your side 
처음 널 봤던 그때의 emotion
All lights are fading away
시간 호흡 소리 모든 게 다
필요해 너의 그 touch (Feel your way)
Until I let out a moan yeah 
Every time I want
How can I stop it now
I don't wanna break up with you with you yeh 
Too hard too many times
널 처음 본 순간에
My whole world has stopped with you with you
Red Light Red Light
Now I'm losing my mind and I see you 
Red Light There's nothing like your skin and your touch
And your breath Everyhing about you
More beautiful than anything else in the world 
To be honest I'm freakin high
There is no focus in my eyes
My heart rate is too high
너와 나의 sound like beach flip-flops
You're my playground
밤을 새워 play like a child
Baby I'm all knotted
I will make you down
Every time I want How can I stop it now
I don't wanna break up with you with you yeh 
Too hard too many times 널 처음 본 순간에
My whole world has stopped with you with you
Red Light Red Light
Now I'm losing my mind and I see you 
Red Light There's nothing like your skin and your touch
And your breath Everyhing about you
More beautiful than anything else in the world 
Red Light Red Light
Now I'm losing my mind and I see you 
Red Light There's nothing like your skin and your touch
And your breath Everyhing about you
More beautiful than anything else in the world
