		  Nothin' but tutti-fruity
Get on the floor if you got that booty, booty
Nothin' but tutti-fruity
Get on the floor if you got that booty, booty
Well damn

She gon' shake that ass 'cause she only live once
She gon' smoke a blunt, then vibe to the front
She gon' shake that ass 'cause she only live once
She gon' smoke a blunt, then vibe to the front

She throw it back, hands on her knees
I got the racks, so bust the cheese
She love to dance, but not for free
So name the price, I'll pay the fee
You know that ass want it, I'll put this cash on it
The way you bounce that ass, you make them bitches mad, don't you?
You want somebody to come and take care your niece, uh
'Cause you a bad bitch and you don't fuck with fleas, uh
Hello?

Here's a little something 'bout a bitch like me
Rule number one, don't touch my weave
If I ain't pass, don't puff my weed
Niggas with money is all I need

She gon' shake that ass 'cause she only live once
She gon' smoke a blunt, then vibe to the front
She gon' shake that ass 'cause she only live once
She gon' smoke a blunt, then vibe to the front
She gon' shake that ass 'cause she only live once
She gon' smoke a blunt, then vibe to the front
She gon' shake that ass 'cause she only live once
She gon' smoke a blunt, then vibe to the front

You want somebody that will take you overseas, yeah
You want them ass shots, and want some double D's, yeah
You want all diamonds, tryna make your neck freeze, yeah
You want Chanel bags and want some double G's, yeah
You got that shit all in your bag
Got your ex on the side looking mad
You want somebody to come and take care your niece, uh
'Cause you a bad bitch and you don't fuck with fleas, uh
Hello?

Here's a little something 'bout a bitch like me
Rule number one, don't touch my weave
If I ain't pass, don't puff my weed
Niggas with money is all I need

She gon' shake that ass 'cause she only live once
She gon' smoke a blunt, then vibe to the front
She gon' shake that ass 'cause she only live once
She gon' smoke a blunt, then vibe to the front
She gon' shake that ass 'cause she only live once
She gon' smoke a blunt, then vibe to the front
She gon' shake that ass 'cause she only live once
She gon' smoke a blunt, then vibe to the front

Now shake that ass, bitch
And let me see what you got, now let me see you got
Now shake that ass, bitch
And let me see what you got, now let me see you got
Now drop it down, drop it down, bust it open for me
Now drop it down, drop it down, bust it open for me
Now drop it down, drop it down, bust it open for me
Now drop it down, drop it down, bust it open for me
