		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Grey skies over a setting sea
Heartbreak, that sounds like a symphony
Future memories at the thought of you
Perfect moments of a desperate youth

Sunlight burning into the moon
Just like all of the things you do
The way you got me, yeah you're in control
You can hypnotize me, you hypnotize me

I don't, I don't know what this is
But I know I love it, baby yes I know
You got my heart hypnotic
Ain't no letting go

I don't, I don't know what this is
But I know I love it, baby yes I know
You got my heart hypnotic
Ain't no letting go

Dark nights under the setting sun
Bright lights, come we're the only one
I've got this vision, how it's supposed to be
There's a fortune teller, telling you and me

Your light is beaming inside of you
That's how you mesmerize me too
The way you got me, yeah you're in control
You can hypnotize me, you hypnotize me

I don't, I don't know what this is
But I know I love it, baby yes I know
You got my heart hypnotic
Ain't no letting go

I don't, I don't know what this is
But I know I love it, baby yes I know
You got my heart hypnotic
Ain't no letting go

(Ain't no letting go)

I, I don't know what this is
But I know that I, I love it
I, I don't know what this is
But you got my heart hypnotic

I, I don't know what this is
But I know that I, I love it
I, I don't know what this is
But you got my heart hypnotic
