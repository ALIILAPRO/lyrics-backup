		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I woke upside down in bed on Sunday morning 
Not feeling pressed about the time
Open my phone and don’t forget to check your story
Wondering if I ever cross your mind 

No I never thought I would fall
I said with my hand on my heart 
But you came in from the dark 
And you changed everything

All I really wanna say is that you
You take my breath away
I doubt you know 
I’m feeling some type way 
I bet your lips taste like strawberry cake 
And when you’re around I can’t breath 
It’s like you’ve stolen all the air out of me 
You look this way and I go weak in the knees
You're like a dream to me

I’m like shit is this the way that I live 
Remember every bit of information that my brain processes
This is it you are the want that I want 
But I just look from afar 
Keep my distance so you can’t break my heart 
I lie and I ignore you 
I try, but I adore you
Wake up every morning feeling a little distorted
Coz under moon and stars
You change everything 

All I really wanna say is that you
You take my breath away
I doubt you know 
I’m feeling some type way 
I bet your lips taste like strawberry cake 
And when you’re around I can’t breath 
It’s like you’ve stolen all the air out of me 
You look this way and I go weak in the knees
You're like a dream to me

Please don’t break my heart 

All I really wanna say is that you
You take my breath away
I doubt you know 
I’m feeling some type way 
I bet your lips taste like strawberry cake 
And when you’re around I can’t breath 
It’s like you’ve stolen all the air out of me 
You look this way and I go weak in the knees
You're like a dream to me
