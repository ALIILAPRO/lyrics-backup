		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feel it come, I, I don't know
How long it's gonna
Stay with me, whoa
I'll let desire be, desire go

Ooh, dare I face the real world?

Every day
Back and forth, what's it for?
What's it for?
Back and forth, every day
Every day
Back and forth, what's it for?
I don't know
I'll get out, won't have to

Check my watch, I don't have
The verve to belong
To this dead side, whoa
Why I ever tried, I don't know

Ooh, dare I face the real world?

Every day
Back and forth, what's it for?
What's it for?
Back and forth, every day
Every day
Back and forth, what's it for?
I don't know
I forget, try to let desire be
Desire go

Feel
Feel it come
Feel it come
I

Feel it come, I, I don't know
How long it's gonna
Stay with me, whoa
I'll let desire be, desire go
