		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers 
Uh-uh, uh-uh

Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time
Uh-oh

I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright, if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright, if
We just keep dancing like we're twenty-two, twenty-two

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids ("Who is Taylor Swift anyway? Ew")
Uh-uh, uh-uh
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreamin'
Instead of sleeping

Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night, when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time
Uh-oh

(Hey) I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if (uh-uh-uh)
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're twenty-two 
(Uh, ah-ah-ah uh) twenty-two
I don't know about you
twenty-two 
twenty-two 

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news 
I gotta have you
I gotta have you 
Uh-uh, uh-uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't know about you (I don't know about you)
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright, if (uuh)
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me (you don't know about me)
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright, if
We just keep dancing like we're twenty-two 
Uh-oh, oh, oh twenty-two 
(Dancing like) twenty-two
Yeah, yeah, twenty-two, yeah, yeah

It feels like one of those nights 
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights 
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights 
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you
