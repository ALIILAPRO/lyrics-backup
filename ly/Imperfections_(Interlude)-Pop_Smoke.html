		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alright, catch this real quick

Oh I, oh I

Baby, why you actin' funny towards me?
Baby, I just need some company, company, company
Baby, I just need some company, company, company

You wanna go on a vacay
But you don't ask enough
You just be gettin' mad as fuck
I give her dick when she actin' up
Baby, you should let me hold you
Let me be the one to, give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
I love your imperfections
You are my selection 
On God

Baby, I just need some company, company, company
Baby, I just need some company, company, company
Baby, I just need some company, company, company
Baby, I just need some company, company, company
