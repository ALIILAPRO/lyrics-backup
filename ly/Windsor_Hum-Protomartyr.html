		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The sound that you're hearing across the river 
Saying, "everything's fine"

The sound across the river into your brain pan 
Saying, "everything's fine"

The sound going across the ocean
Saying, "everything's fine"

Everything's fine

It says want want want want want what you are given
Need need need need need what you'll never have 
Never have 

The old Windsor humming
Across the river
From the U.S. of A
Saying, "everything's fine"

Everything's fine 

It says want want want want want what you are given
Need need need need need what you'll never have 
Never have 
And never will

The Windsor hum
The Windsor humming
The winds are humming
