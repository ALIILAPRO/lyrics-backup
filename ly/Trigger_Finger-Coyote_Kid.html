		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Short breath on your loaded dice
I don't know why you're playing when you only roll snake eyes.
But I'll play along
But not for long
Blood stain on the kitchen knife
It wasn't made for it but I know how to improvise
To stay alive. It's not my time to die

You've got the guts kid but
Is it enough to turn this around
And around and around again

I've got two problems but you're just one
The other's tapping on the trigger of a loaded gun
I'm staring down
Don't let me down
You've got a steady hand that's cold to the touch
You've only got one shot but do you have the guts
To make it count. Don't let me down

You've got guts kid but
Is it enough to turn this around
And around and around again
