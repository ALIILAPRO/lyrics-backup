		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Locked in the darkened world
Made to never last
That's where the dreams you seek
Are like stories from the past

Sweet infant child's born
Sweet mother of the womt
Hope it is over soon
Not much more can I take

Help me lord
I'm falling fast
Bring me back

Nerves slip away from
Within your conscious mind
Translucent hopes are now
Nothing but dismal eves

You lived your life so down
To the bitter end
Better think it over now
Your life has just begun

Help me lord
I'm falling fast
Bring me back

Just show me life is how
And not a bitter war
The odds in favor now
It's hard to live and learn

Silence the sorrow
And don't let it slip away
Think of tomorrow
As the future of today

Help me lord
I'm falling fast
Bring me back

Locked in the darkened world
Made to never last
That's where the dreams you seek
Are like stories from the past

Sweet infant child's born
Sweet mother of the womt
Hope it is over soon
Not much more can I take

Help me lord
I'm falling fast
Bring me back
