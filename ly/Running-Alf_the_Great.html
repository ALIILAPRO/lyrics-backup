		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I get lost
Sometimes I get lost
I'm looking for my way
I'm searching for this day
Can someone light my way
When time and spaces bends around me like sideways
Back to back on friday
I feel like I'm lost sometimes
I feel like I'm lost

I feel like the river that never ends
I can see the mountains on the horizon
I feel like the river that never ends
I can see the mountains on the horizon

Feel like I'm running away
Feel like I'm running away
I wanna go into space
I wanna go into space
Running away from the pain
Running away from the pain
Feel like I'm running place
Feel like I'm running place
Feel like I'm running away
Feel like I'm running away
Feel like I'm running away
Feel like I'm running away

Feel like I'm running, I'm running, I'm running
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I stop
Running I stop, yeah, running I stop
More caffeine than a coffee shop
More sweet than a lollipop
Greener than the hills like the win-xp desktop
Falling down like raindrop
Crying and I can't stop
Eyes closed to the thought that broken hearts make that love lost

Don't go running away
Don't go running away
Feel like I'm running away
Feel like I'm running away
Don't go running away
Don't go running away
Feel like I'm running away
Feel like I'm running away
Don't go running away
Don't go running away
Feel like I'm running away
Feel like I'm running away
Don't go running away
Don't go running away
Feel like I'm running away
Feel like I'm running away
Don't go running away
Don't go running away aye
