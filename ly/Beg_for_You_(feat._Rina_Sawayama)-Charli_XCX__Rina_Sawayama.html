		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know I go insane
Every time you have to catch a flight
Ah, ah-ah-ah
Can I take you to the airport?
Make out under the bathroom lights?
Ah, ah-ah-ah

Put your lips on my lips
I'll remember your kiss
On the nights when I miss you, ooh
Something I can't forget
When I'm restless in bed
Yeah, you got me obsessed, mmm

Oh, don't you leave me this way
Won't you wait another hour or two?
You know I need you to stay
Don't make me beg for you
'Cause I'll beg for you

Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, yeah
Beg for you, beg for you
Beg for you, beg for you
Beg for you, beg for you
Oh, don't you leave me this way

You're like an ocean breeze
Coming and going just as you please
Ah, ah-ah-ah
Separated by a degree
Hesitate and I lose you
So far out of reach
Ah, ah-ah-ah

Oh, put your lips on my lips
I'll remember your kiss
On the nights when I miss your mouth
Something I can't forget
When I'm restless in bed
Yeah, you got me obsessed, now

Oh, don't you leave me this way
Won't you wait another hour or two?
You know I need you to stay
Don't make me beg for you
'Cause I'll beg for you

My heart is aching
My breath, you take it
Oh, babe, I just want a taste
Don't you leave me this way
Don't make me beg for you

Don't leave me, don't leave me
This way, this way
This way

Don't leave me, don't leave me
This way, this way
This way

Don't leave me, don't leave me
This way, this way (don't you leave me, don't you leave me)
This way (don't you leave me)

Don't leave me, don't leave me
This way, this way (don't you leave me, don't you leave me)
This way (yeah)
Don't you leave me (yeah), don't you leave me

Yeah, yeah, yeah
