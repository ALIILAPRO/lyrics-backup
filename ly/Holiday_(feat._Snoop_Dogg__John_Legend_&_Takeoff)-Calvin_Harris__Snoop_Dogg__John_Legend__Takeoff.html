		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look, open your eyes, déjà vu
In ways I knew my focus remains on you
I'm so true, I love that, 'cause who woulda knew
LBC, me? do what it do
Question: is your bath water ran for ya
'Cause I could be the man for ya
Baby, are your bills paid?
Were those dinner reservations made?
The whistles, the bells
How 'bout your hair?
What about your nails?
See I can have it done for ya
Looks like I'm the one for ya
I'll crack the whip and get a little action in here, my dear
But first, relax a bit
The questions and answers are clear

Holiday
What you wanna do?
Want to do with you
Let's make everyday a holiday
What you wanna do?
Want to do with you

Takeoff
Smile at you (smile)
I got my eyes on you (eyes)
I wanna climb on you
Can I ride with you? (can I?)
Touch the sky with you
Huh-huh-huh
Say the place and we go where you want to go (where?)
She say Rodeo, I say I'm thinkin' 'bout Tokyo
Let the top go, won't turn up the stereo (stereo)
Singing every word of my song that's on radio (ay)
I'ma roll one, I know that you don't smoke (I know)
Sit back, let your mind flow (phew)
Never give up hope (no)
And if you got a problem let me know
I try my best to keep you close
The life we in, no boss to match 'em on the ropes
If I'm top ten, to win I gotta be the G.O.A.T
I feel like when I step in (what?)
Gotta make an announcement
But y'all know (but y'all know)

Holiday
What you wanna do?
Want to do with you
Let's make everyday a holiday
What you wanna do?
Want to do with you
Let's make everyday a holiday
What you wanna do?
Want to do with you
Let's make everyday a holiday (don't you wanna)
 
Let's make everyday a holiday
I wanna make everyday
Make it a day
