		  Uh-huh
Uh-huh

Was minding my own business 'til you caught my eye (uh-huh)
Your attitude a little rude and six foot five (he's six foot five)
Your eyes are sending me a message, I get it (uh-huh)
We haven't touched yet but the feeling's electric

Oh-oh-oh-oh, my head and heart is telling me "No"
But my body's telling me to let go
Oh, one more drink won't hurt, I suppose
But honestly

I just came to dance, (alone?) uh-huh
You messed up all my plans, (I did?) uh-huh
But I'll give you a chance, (say what?) uh-huh
And now we're saying "Baby"
Got me going crazy
When I just came to dance

You spent the whole night only looking at my lips
I've got a feeling this won't end with just a kiss (mwah)
It might end in tears but it's too late now, forget it
And if I walk away I know I'll regret it

Oh-oh-oh-oh, my head and heart is telling me "No"
But my body's telling me to let go
Oh, one more drink won't hurt, I suppose
But honestly

I just came to dance, (alone?) uh-huh
You messed up all my plans, (I did?) uh-huh
But I'll give you a chance, (say what?) uh-huh
You got me going crazy
I told you, baby, I just came to dance

Uh, so come closer
I was pushing for a minute now I want ya
Be reckless, come get this
And when we're done, we'll do it all again for breakfast, ah

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

I just came to dance, (alone?) uh-huh
You messed up all my plans, (I did?) uh-huh
But I'll give you a chance, (say what?) uh-huh
And now we're saying "Baby"
Got me going crazy
When I just came to dance
