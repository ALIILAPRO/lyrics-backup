		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let it be strange
It’s the sign of the times and the ways
Through the fire and now we are here
Just a matter of what we’ve become
And the trials of the one

No reason why
It’s a story you won’t leave behind
Let it down and it burns the ground
You’ll be smiling and I’ll be just here
No more reasons to fear

No man’s land
Just a road leading
Straight to Hell
I was locked inside a
Mental cell
And you know that I would
Never be looking back no
Never to return again

Falling behind
I can feel all the anger inside
Just a stranger without any lead
Cut me sideways and watching me bleed
By the hands of the greed

Strange as it seems
Made a man of the heart on the sleeve
Supernova, I’m flying away
Shooting star and I’m painting the skies
With the lies and the why’s

No man’s land
Just a road leading
Straight to Hell
I was locked inside a
Mental cell
And you know that I would
Never be looking back no
Never to return again

Let it be strange
Let it shine and just give it away
Let me down and you’ll be on your way
Let us live in the times and the ways
Let us die with a praise

No man’s land
Just a road leading
Straight to Hell
I was locked inside a
Mental cell
And you know that I would
Never be looking back no
Never to return again
