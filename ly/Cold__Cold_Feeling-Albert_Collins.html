		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I?ve got a cold, cold feelin; It?s just like ice around my heart.
I?ve got a cold, cold feelin; It?s just like ice around my heart.
I know I?m gonna? quit somebody, every time that, feelin?starts.

You treat my like a prisoner, because my hands are tied.
Everything you do to me, is stackin? up inside.
It?s a cold, cold feelin? Yea, You?re just like ice around my heart.
I know I?m gonna? quit somebody, every time that, feelin?starts.

There?s a change in me baby, once I was blind but now I can see.
There?s a change in me baby, once I was blind but now I can see.
I?m gonna? put everybody down baby, 
That ever made a fool outta me.
