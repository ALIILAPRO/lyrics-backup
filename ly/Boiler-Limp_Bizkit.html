		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Looks like I'ma do everything myself 
Maybe I could use some help 
But hell, you want something done right 
You gotta do it yourself 
Maybe life is up and down 
But my life's been what 'til now? 
I crawled up your butt somehow 
And that's when things got turned around 

I used to be alive
And now I feel pathetic 
And now I get it 
What's done is done 
You just leave it alone 
And don't regret it 
Sometimes some things turn into dumb things 
And that's when you put your foot down 

Why'd I have to go and meet somebody like you? (Like you?)
Why'd you have to go and hurt somebody like me? (Like me?)
How could you do somebody like that? (Like that?)
Hope you know that I'm never coming back (never coming back)

Looks like I'ma do everything myself (everything myself)
And maybe I could use some help 
But hell, if you want something done right 
You just do it yourself (got it?)

Maybe life is up and down 
But my life's been what 'til now? (Got it?)
I crawled up your butt somehow (got it?)
And that's when shit got turned around 

I used to be alive
So pathetic 
But now I get it 
What's done is done 
I know, you just leave it alone 
And don't regret it 
But sometimes some things turn into dumb things 
And that's when you put your foot down (you put your foot down)

Why'd I have to go and meet somebody like you? (Like you?)
Why'd you have to go and hurt somebody like me? (Like me?)
How could you do somebody like that?
Hope you know that I'm never coming back (that I'm never coming back)

Why'd I have to go and meet somebody like you? (Like you?)
Why'd you have to go and hurt somebody like me? (Like me?)
How could you do somebody like that?
Hope you know that I'm never coming back (that I'm never coming back)

Depending on you is done (is done) 
Giving to you is done 
No more eating, no sleeping, no living 
It's all just more giving to you and I'm done (and I'm done)

Depending on you is done (is done) 
And giving to you is done 
No more eating, no sleeping, no living 
It's all just more giving to you and I'm done (and I'm done) 

The hiding from you is done (is done) 
The lying from you is done 
No more eating, no sleeping, no living 
It's all just more giving to you and I'm done (and I'm done) 

Why'd I have to go and meet somebody like you? (Like you?)
Why'd you have to go and hurt somebody like me? (Like me?)
How could you do somebody like that?
Hope you know that I'm never coming back (that I'm never coming back)

Why'd I have to go and meet somebody like you? (Like you?)
Why'd you have to go and hurt somebody like me? (Like me?)
How could you do somebody like that?
Hope you know that I'm never coming back (that I'm never coming back)

Why? 
Why? 

Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?

Why?
Why?

Ladies and gentlemen 
What you are experiencing 
Is in fact an interlude 
I would like you to kick back 
And think about everything you've just heard
