		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The ferns are greedy
They all want something from me
These trees are dirty
Want me to have a baby
Her kids are lonely
They all want something from me
Their eyes are beady
Their stares they pierce right through me

But I don't have anything left to give
I'm like an old bone
In the back of the fridge
And I could ask for what I want
So you could tell me what you need
But there's no use trying anymore
Like an old bone
In the back of the fridge
And I've got no home
If it's not with you

Your friends are greedy
They all want something from me
These streets are dirty
Want me to have a baby
Her kids are lonely
They all want something from me
Their eyes are beady
Their stares they pierce right through me

But I don't have anything left to give
I'm like an old bone
In the back of the fridge
And I could ask for what I want
So you could tell me what you need
But there's no use crying anymore
I'm just an old bone
In the back of the fridge
And I've got no home
If it's not with you
