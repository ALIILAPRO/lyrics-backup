		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On you, my feelings have been hurt
On you, don't you see the clouds coming down
On you, my feelings have been hurt
On you, don't you see the clouds coming down

With me on my finger, now
Fly me by the window
I travel through the sunshine
Don't you see the clouds coming down
With me on my finger, now
Fly me by the window
I travel through the sunshine
Don't you see the clouds coming down

On you, my feelings have been hurt
On you, don't you see the clouds coming down

With me on my finger, now
Fly me by the window
I travel through the sunshine
Don't you see the clouds coming down
With me on my finger, now
Fly me by the window
I travel through the sunshine
Don't you see the clouds coming down

I'm falling for you
I guess I'm just falling for you
I guess I'm just falling for you
I guess I'm just falling for you
I guess I'm falling for you
I guess I'm just falling for you
I guess I'm falling for you
I guess I'm just falling for you
I guess I'm just falling for you
I guess I'm just falling for you
I guess I'm just falling for you
I guess I'm just falling for you
