		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've seen the end i've seen pain
Watched my loved ones slip away

Black veins pull me deep i'm ashamed
I shall reap death

Painted on the streets
It's all from my hands violence

Lightning strikes upon the horizon
I call out patience all out

Killing my enemies never feeling sympathy
Won't forget what you did to me
Killing my enemies never feeling sympathy
Won't give mercy that isn't me

Back to back swift attack
Fuck 'em there's no going back
I'm over that over that
There's no going back

I've seen the end i've seen pain
Watched my loved ones slip away

Black veins pull me deep i'm ashamed
I shall reap death

Painted on the streets
It's all from my hands violence
Lightning strikes upon the horizon
I call out patience all out

I am hate i am death
Scream it 'til my last breath

Draw the axe send it back
Restless till my lungs Collapse

I'll bring destruction won't feel nothing
From it fuck it i love it crushing
And crumbling everything
'Til nothing remains look at my face

I am hate i am death
Scream it 'til my last breath
I am hate i am death
I'm the God of War

God of
War

I've seen the end i've seen pain
Watched my loved ones slip away

Black veins pull me deep i'm ashamed
I shall reap death

Painted on the streets
It's all from my hands violence

Lightning strikes upon the horizon
I call out patience all out

Killing my enemies never feeling sympathy
Won't forget what you did to me

Killing my enemies never feeling sympathy
Won't give mercy that isn't me

Back to back swift attack
Fuck 'em there's no going back
I'm over that over that
There's no going back

I've seen the end i've seen pain
Watched my loved ones slip away

Black veins pull me deep i'm ashamed
I shall reap death

Painted on the streets
It's all from my hands violence

Lightning strikes upon the horizon
I call out patience all out

God of
War
