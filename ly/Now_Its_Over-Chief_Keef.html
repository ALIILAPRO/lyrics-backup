		  (Izze The Producer)
Now it's over
Now it's over
Now it's over
Now it's over
It's over

I keep a big bankroll and some designer clothes on
Last year I didn't have shit, well now it's over
Keep me some hoes, a lot of hoes, yeah
Last year I cuffed that bitch, well now it's over
Now it's over, now it's over
Last year I didn't have shit, well now it's over
Now it's over, now it's over
Last year I cuffed that bitch, well now it's over

Learned how to record myself, well now it's over
I'ma kill these beats like a fuckin' soldier
She gon' give me top then I'ma slump her over
And we ain't with the talk boy, we'll slump you over
I be ridin' 'Raris, Rovers
I got lots of guap, you know it
And we ain't with the talk, we blowin'
I got guap, just watch me throw it
They say I'm handsome 'cause my bands up
And I don't hold no ho for ransom
And if we see a opp, we blam him
If he ain't one of ours, then damn him

I keep a big bankroll and some designer clothes on
Last year I didn't have shit, well now it's over
Keep me some hoes, a lot of hoes, yeah
Last year I cuffed that bitch, well now it's over
Now it's over, now it's over
Last year I didn't have shit, well now it's over
Now it's over, now it's over
Last year I cuffed that bitch, well now it's over
