		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now when you say you wanna slow down
Does it mean you wanna slow dance?
Maybe you just want a little extra time to focus
On our romance

What do you mean I got it backwards?
You know we're gonna be forever
Why are you telling me goodbye?
Aren't you gonna stay the night?

Are we really over now?
Maybe I can change your mind
Soon as you walk out my door
I'm gonna call a hundred times

Now I walk under a pink sky
Lovers for long and pass me by
I poured my heart out to your voice mail
Let you know I caught a bus to your side of town

And now I'm standing at your doorstep
With Los Angeles behind me dear
If you don't answer I'll just use the key that I copied
'Cause I really need to see you

You're not here when I break in
I'm gonna go into your closet
Just so I can smell your skin
As the chemicals swim
I know I'll never love again
I swear I'll never love again

Baby, are we really over now?
Maybe I can change your mind
Soon as you walk out my door
I'm gonna call a hundred times

I'm not one of those crazy girls
I'm not one of those crazy girls
I'm not one of those crazy girls
I'm not one of those crazy girls

Hey, baby, are we really over now?
Maybe I can change your mind
Soon as you walk out my door
I'm gonna call a hundred times

Baby, are we really over now?
Maybe I can change your mind
Soon as you walk out my door
I'm gonna call a hundred times

Now I'm one of those crazy girls
Now I'm one of those crazy girls
Now I'm one of those crazy girls
Now I'm one of those crazy girls
