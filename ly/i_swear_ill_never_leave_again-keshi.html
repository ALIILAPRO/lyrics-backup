		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mirror on the wall
Can you tell me who I am?
I think that I forgot
So remind me once again
Maybe I was going too fast
Babe, I'd give it all to go back (yeah-hea-eah)

Baby I'm better, I promise
Know that I've never been honest
Maybe I never forgot it (forgot it)
Daily reminder
Tattoos of tigers
Cigarette lighters
Laughter and cider

(Daily reminder)
(Tattoos of tigers)
(Cigarette lighters)
(Laughter and cider)
(Maybe I was going too fast)
(Babe, I'd give it all to go back)
(I swear I'll never leave again)

Ohh (ohh)
Ohh (yeah)
(Hea-hea-hea)
I don't deserve this
All in your arms
All your forgiveness
I don't belong
I swear
I swear I'll never leave again

(Daily reminder)
(Tattoos of tigers)
(Cigarette lighters)
(Laughter and cider)
(Maybe I was going too fast)
(Babe, I'd give it all to go back)

So this is love
Just hold me close
I'll never leave
I won't let go
Oh, I swear I'll never leave again
