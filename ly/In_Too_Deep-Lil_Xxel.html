		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I'm in too deep
Feel like I need to FaceTime to go to sleep
Feel like I need to hear your voice speak to be at peace
Feel like I need your love and affection to be at ease
I never had these feelings before, like what are these?
And maybe I should question your heart
What are the reasons that you want to battle the odds?
Cause it ain't even
Don't make me feel like loving a job, my name ain't Steve
And baby you deserve an award you were deceiving
Know I left my heart on the floor
You came and sweeped it
Not acting how you acted before, just know I peeped it
Okay, we can do it your way
But I been running in circles like I'm stuck in a maze
When I was down yeah I rose, like the ones in a vase
Now you acting real cold, like the stones in the face
Now you tweeting red flags like you've got something to say
But I'm respectfully silent..
Girl you had me unwrapped and chewed me up like trident
I'm sick that I tried it..
Knew I was in too deep, but I can't lie I like it
You toxic girl, I knew that for weeks uh
As time goes on, I'm feeling weaker
I'm leaving
You was out here crying on your knees and
You give soul suck a different reason
Okay, we can do it your way
But I been running in circles like I'm stuck in a maze
When I was down yeah I rose, like the ones in a vase
Now you acting real cold, like the stones in the face
Now you tweeting red flags like you've got something to say
But I'm respectfully silent..
Girl you had me unwrapped and chewed me up like trident
I'm sick that I tried it..
Knew I was in too deep, but I can't lie I
Feel like I need to FaceTime to go to sleep
Feel like I need to hear your voice speak to be at peace
Feel like I need your love and affection to be at ease
I never had these feelings before, like what are these?
And maybe I should question your heart
What are the reasons that you want to battle the odds?
Cause it ain't even
Don't make me feel like loving a job, my name ain't Steve
And baby you deserve an award you were deceiving
Know I left my heart on the floor
You came and sweeped it
Not acting how you acted before, just know I peeped it
