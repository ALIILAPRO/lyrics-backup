		  Ground control
What do the books say about this one?
Now I think we've lost it all
There's nothing to explain the distances anymore

All systems are critical
Can't find my way back to you
Feels like there's nowhere to go
I'm just out here waiting for you say
Don't be afraid, no

If you start floating away
Hey, I promise you will be fine
Got the universe on your side
When you're out in space
Don't you be afraid, no
If you start floating away
Hey, I promise you will be fine
Got the universe on your side
When you're out in space
Don't you be afraid, no
If you start floating away

Checking in
300 days with no reply now
I think I've lost my mind
There's nothing keeping me from going outside anymore

My systems are critical
Gotta find my way back to you
Feels like I'm drifting alone
I'm just out here wishing that you would say
Don't be afraid, no

If you start floating away
Hey, I promise you will be fine
Got the universe on your side
When you're out in space
Don't you be afraid, no
If you start floating away
Hey, I promise you will be fine
Got the universe on your side
When you're out in space
Don't you be afraid, no
If you start floating away

We gotta make contact to make it out
We gotta make contact to make it
We gotta make contact to make it out

If you start floating away
Hey, I promise you will be fine
Got the universe on your side
When you're out in space
Don't you be afraid, no
If you start floating away
Hey, I promise you will be fine
Got the universe on your side
When you're out in space
Don't you be afraid, no
If you start floating away

Don't you be afraid, no
If you start floating away
