Remember fall in Montreal
Our heads out of the windows
Canary colored balconies
Trees pinker than flamingos
Remember fall in Montreal
You were back at home and you missed it all
Well, I guess we shared October skies
As I said good day and you said good night

In my wildest dreams you'd be with me
In Montreal and the falling leaves
Take flight light as a feather
So drift to me, darling, drift to me
To Montreal and the falling leaves
We'll be light there together
We'll be light there together
Take flight light as a feather

(Ooh) mmh
(Drift to me, darling, drift to me)
(Drift to me, darling, drift to me)
(Drift to me, darling, drift to me)
(Drift to me, darling, drift to me)

Well, all that morning I was trying to find
Those fabled oranges from China
And I nearly burned my eyebrows all off
With that hot sauce from that diner

In my wildest dreams you'd be with me
In Montreal and the falling leaves
Take flight light as a feather
So drift to me, darling, drift to me
To Montreal and the falling leaves
We'll be light there together
We'll be light there together
Take flight light as a feather

'Cause, oh, you would have loved it there
Better than a video call (better than a video call)
And, oh, I wish that we could share
Our favorite moments, don't we all?
Don't we all?

Drift to me, darling, drift to me
(Drift to me, darling, drift to me)
Drift to me, darling, drift to me
(Drift to me, darling, drift to me)
Drift to me, darling, drift to me
(Drift to me, darling, drift to me)
Drift to me, darling, drift to me
(Drift to me, darling, drift to me)
Drift to me, darling, drift to me

(To Montreal and the fallen leaves)
To Montreal and the fallen leaves
(Drift to me, darling, drift to me)
Drift to me, darling, drift to me
(Take flight light as a feather)
Drift to me, darling, drift to me
