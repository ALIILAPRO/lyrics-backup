		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  First day out
Gave my mama hundred racks
And bought a iced-out AP watch
And bought a Cuban links just to match it
That was voodoo, that was magic
Nigga be cappin', I just be laughin'
That was God, nigga was fastin'
And hidin' K2 in my mattress
Smokin' Tunechi in my cell
That was my twelfth time going to jail
That was my second time going to hell
And back for real but I prevail
Canary yellow diamonds in my bracelet
Same color as my lady
'Bout to hit her with no Jimmy Mack
And go half on a baby
'Bout to hit her with no jimmy
Have her walkin' like a penguin
Still finessin', still be poppin' frogs, finagling the Range
And a brand new two-door Wraith
I coulda bought it but I just rent it
Got a brand new big old chain
Got so much sauce I don't need no pendant
Paintin' pictures when I be spendin'
I'm poppin' forreal on all these women
It's my birthday, just turned 20
And I just went to go see the dentist
Put some stones all in my gold
Know you niggas thought I was gone
Know you niggas thought I wasn't comin' home
But guess what, bitch I'm home
On probation, but I still keep that chrome
Crack a nigga dome
(On probation but I still keep that chrome
I'll crack a nigga dome)
Traded my AR for a sniper, traded my Draco for a TEC
Traded my Rollie for a AP but I coulda got a Patek
And I coulda got a Corvette, and I coulda got me a jet
And I coulda got me some sex, but I only got me some neck
Traded my ex bitch for a check
I'm takin' codeine with the x
I wanna buy my brother the world
But since I can't, I'mma get him a Lex
Ay ay, I'm a Israelite, my diamonds is real ice
I had to sacrifice to be here, that's how I'm with you tonight
I had to run down with my big Glock 9 to feed my appetite
I had to go through hard times and dark times just for me to see the light
Ay, I remember pourin' honey on my rice
Ay, I remember havin' no money, I was livin' shiest
Ay, you got me fucked up if I'mma go out without a fight
Ay, this my first day out, I'mma live it up tonight

Live it up tonight
This my first day out, I'mma live it up tonight
Live it up tonight
This my first day out, I'mma live it up tonight
Live it up tonight
This my first day out, I'mma live it up tonight
Live it up tonight
This my first day out, I'mma live it up tonight
