		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you dreaming
or could this be real?
If you could feel so
alive then just touch the sky
You cannot deny it
you won't deny it
You will never deny it
forever more
It's time to take a
chance tonight
And make a move
cause you can prove to
Just step across my fears
Rise above
Just do it
trust that you can do it
You can do it
I know you can rise above it
Just rise above
Just rise above it
Just rise above and prove us all
You are the one
that holds the future
Trust yourself cause
I know you can rise above it
Just rise above
Just rise above it
Just rise above and prove us all

Fate would have it,
that this could be real
Cause you'll feel so
alive when you touch the sky
You cannot deny it
you won't deny it
You will never deny it
forever more
You've gone and made this
chance tonight
It's time to choose
cause you can prove it
To step beyond your fears
Rise above
Just do it
trust that you can do it
You can do it
I know you can rise above it
Just rise above
Just rise above it
Just rise above and prove us all
You are the one
that holds the future
Trust yourself cause
I know you can rise above it
Just rise above
Just rise above it
Just rise above and prove us all

You can rise above it
You can rise above it
Gotta future to unfold
This life that you own
Just believe that you can go
The future is yours
Just rise above it
You can rise above it
This is the way the truth
and you are the light
This is the way the truth
and you are the light from here
