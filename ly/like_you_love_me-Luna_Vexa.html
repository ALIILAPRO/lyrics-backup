		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Enslaved I follow you, into the fire
Dripping from your poison
Depraved crawling on my knees, 
To get me higher
A drink from your cup 
And I'm powerless

Kiss my troubles away, lets ride it out
When I wrap my legs around your hips
You pull me right into your lethal kiss
Cause I want you, I want you oh
We don't need to be lovers, 
Buut I'll need you to
Fuck me like you love me

Like you love me
Like you love me
But I'll need you to
Fuck me like you love me
Like you love me
We don't need to be lovers
But I'll need you to
Fuck me like you love me

Kiss my troubles away, let's ride it out
But I'll need you to
Fuck me like you love me
A sweet raw dance with the devil, oh
Kiss my troubles away
But I'll need you to
Fuck me like you love me

Aching I follow my desire
Licking off the poison from your body
Come at me
Sword held high to my collar
I know I'm bound to your entity forever
Come for me
Bruise me with every silence
Got me obsessive and disarmed
Sharp dagger to my heart
Sign away the rules
Sign away my soul
For a sweet raw dance with the devil oh

Kiss my troubles away, lets ride it out
When I wrap my legs around your hips
You pull me right into your lethal kiss
Cause I want you, I want you oh
We don't need to be lovers, but I'll need you to
Fuck me like you love me

Like you love me
Like you love me
But I'll need you to
Fuck me like you love me
Like you love me
We don't need to be lovers
But I'll need you to
Fuck me like you love me

Kiss my troubles away, let's ride it out
But I'll need you to
Fuck me like you love me
A sweet raw dance with the devil, oh
Kiss my troubles away
But I'll need you to
Fuck me like you love me

Kiss my troubles away, lets ride it out
When I wrap my legs around your hips
You pull me right into your lethal kiss
Cause I want you, I want you oh
We don't need to be lovers, but I'll need you to
Fuck me like you love me

Kiss my troubles away, let's ride it out
But I'll need you to
Fuck me like you love me
A sweet raw dance with the devil, oh
Kiss my troubles away
But I'll need you to
Fuck me like you love me

You love me-e-e-e
Fuck me like you love me
You love me-e-e-e

Fuck me like you love me
You love me-e-e-e
Fuck me like you love me
