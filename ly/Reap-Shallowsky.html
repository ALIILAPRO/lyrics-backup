		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ignore repeating patterns
You can't run from the next chapter
You plant the seeds
I know where this leads
Comfort is just a memory
Too long you followed blindly
Someday you'll see
You'll beg
You'll bleed
If we light the fire
Awake the monster
You won't escape the ashes
You don't know what you're asking
Cut the wire
'Cause now you're on your own
And it's time for you to reap what you've sown
Reap what you've sown
Fueling a hopeless factor
Your fight, it's all that mattered
Demand, protest
Riot, obsessed
If we light the fire
Awake the monster
You won't escape the ashes
You don't know what you're asking
Cut the wire
'Cause now you're on your own
And it's time for you to reap what you've sown
Someday you'll see
You can't bite the hand that feeds
You'll beg, you'll bleed
'Cause the devil's in the details
Someday you'll see
You can't bite the hand that feeds
You'll beg, you'll bleed
'Cause the devil's in the details
Light the fire
Awake the monster
You won't escape the ashes
You don't know what you're asking
Cut the wire
'Cause now you're on your own
And it's time for you to reap what you've sown
Comfort is just a memory
You plant the seeds
Too long you followed blindly
Someday you'll see
Fueling a hopeless factor
You'll beg, you'll bleed
Your fight, it's all that mattered
Time to reap what you've sown
