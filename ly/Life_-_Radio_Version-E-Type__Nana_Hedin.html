		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got life
One more time
I leave behind just burning bridges
It's a crime

I am here
There must be somewhere I can breathe
Now take me there
It's time to see

I want to make you breathe
Life can be whatever, what you want it to be
You need the key
I'm gonna make you see

No more make belive, you just go
I've got life
You`re always on my mind
You gotta believe in something, alright

Forever by your side
I've got life
Just give me time to find
Whatever it is it will be alright

Forever by your side
What`s that sound
My destiny is bound for changes
Lost and found

You tell me
There's gonna be a showdown somewhere
It's irit
It's time to see

I'm gonna make you see
No more make believe, you just go...
I've got life
You're always on my mind

You gotta believe in something, alright
Forever by your side
I've got life
Just give me time to find

Whatever it is it will be alright
Forever by your side
I've got life, alright
You gotta believe in something, alright

I'm by your side..................
We're gonna live forever
Don't let this be... whatever
I'm gonna make you believe in something... 'cause

We're gonna live forever
If you never say never
We're gonna make it, alright
I've got life...
