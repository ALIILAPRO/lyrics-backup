		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stand beside it, we can't hide the way it makes us glow
It's no good unless it grows, feel this burning, love of mine
Deep inside the ever-spinning, tell me does it feel?
It's no good unless it's real, hillsides burning
Wild-eyed turning 'til we're running from it

I'd take care of you if you ask me to
In a year or two, oh oh oh

You say swimming in the lake we'll come across a snake
It is real and then it's fake, feel its heartbeat
Feel what you heat, far so fast it feels too late

I'll take care of you if you'd ask me to
In a year or two, oh oh oh

I'll take care of you, take care of you
That's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you
That's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you
That's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you
That's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you
That's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you
That's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you
That's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you
That's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you
That's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you
That's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you
That's true
