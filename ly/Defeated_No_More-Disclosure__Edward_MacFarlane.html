		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Defeated no more
I just feel I let you go
Been cheated, I've been fooled
But you're my heart and glow gone

Gotta let this fire keep burning
'Cause I can't seem to let this show
Instead of running I keep it slow
'Cause I won't let this take control

Got to get it, got got to get it
Got to get it, got got to get it on
Got to get it, got got to get it
Got to get it, got got to get it on

Defeated no more
I still watched you take it all
I'm healed and I'm reborn
But my heart's shaking off the cold

Gotta let this fire keep burning
'Cause I can't seem to let this show
Instead of running I keep it slow
'Cause I won't let this take control

Got to get it, got got to get it
Got to get it, got got to get it on
Got to get it, got got to get it
Got to get it, got got to get it on

I can feel it working from the last you know
I can feel it working, but can you?
I can feel it working from the last you know
I know you think you're hurting but can you love?
I can feel it working from the last you know
I know you feel it working, but can you?
I can feel it working from the last you know
I know you feel it
Can you love?
Can you love?
Can you love?
Can you love?

Defeated no more
I feel your shadow disappear
I've faded and I fought
But now I know I make the rules

Gotta let this fire keep burning
'Cause I can't seem to let this show
Instead of running I keep it slow
'Cause I won't let this take control

Got to get it, got got to get it
Got to get it, got got to get it on
Got to get it, got got to get it
Got to get it, got got to get it on

Got to get it, got got to get it
Got to get it, got got to get it on
Got to get it, got got to get it
Got to get it, got got to get it on

Got to get it, got got to get it
Got to get it, got got to get it on
Got to get it, got got to get it
Got to get it, got got to get it on

I can feel it working from the last you know
I know you feel it working, but can you?
I can feel it working from the last you know
I know you think you're hurting but can you love?
I can feel it working from the last you know
I know you feel it working, but can you?
I can feel it working from the last you know
I know you feel it
Can you love?
Can you love?
Can you love?
Can you love?
Can you love?
Can you love?
Can you love?
Can you love?
