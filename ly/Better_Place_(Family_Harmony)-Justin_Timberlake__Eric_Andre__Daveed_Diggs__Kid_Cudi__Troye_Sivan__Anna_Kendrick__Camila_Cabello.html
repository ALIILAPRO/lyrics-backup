		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's some kinda love, it's some kind of fire
I'm already up, but you lift me higher
You know I'm not wrong, you know I'm not lyin'
We do it better, we do it better, yeah

And I don't mind if the world spins faster
The music's louder, the waves get stronger
I don't mind if the world spins faster
Faster, faster

Just let me take you to a better place
(Let me take you to a better place)
I'm gonna make ya kiss the sky tonight
Yeah, if you let me show the way
I'm so excited to see you excited
I'll take you to a better place
(I'll take you to a better place)
And, baby, you can love me on the way
We're flyin' up to outer space
I'm so excited (I'm so excited) 
To see you excited (to see you excited), yeah

I don't mind if the world spins faster
The music's louder, the waves get stronger
I don't mind if the world spins faster
Faster, faster, faster

Just let me take you to a better place
