		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Intro -

They bring me down, down down, push them away
They keep on coming then, I’m gonna break
Down, down, down, down to the grave
I’ll Bury these demons the way I bury my pain, and push em down 
You keep bringing me, down
You keep bringing me, down

Verse 1 -

Im a slave turned to rouge
Put my wish in the well
I was raised by the monsters
Tried to send them to hell
Got a pistol on my side, and a book in my bag
Cause a sinner needs a saint to tell him what’s at the end

Pre -

They bring me
Down, down, down
Push them away
They keep on coming
Then I’m gonna break
Down, down, down
Down to the grave
I’ll bury these demons the way I bury my pain
And push em down

Hook -

You keep bringing me, down
You keep bringing me, down

Verse 2-

Im an outlaw by trade, yeah I’m a cold hearted man
You don’t survive in this game, if you show em your hand
Got some people tryna end me, but you’ll never do that
Cause I’ve been through some things, that you would never understand
 
Hook 2-
You keep bringing me, down 
You keep bringing me, down 
You keep bringing me, down
You keep bringing me, down
