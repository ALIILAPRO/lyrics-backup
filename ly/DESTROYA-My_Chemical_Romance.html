		  Check, check
(Check, check) check, check
(Check, check, check, check, check)
Check, ch- whoa

Don't believe what they say
We're dead flies in the summertime
They leave us all behind
With duct tape scars on my honey
They don't like who you are
You won't like where we'll go
Brother, protect me now
With blood they wash in the money

You don't believe in God
I don't believe in luck
They don't believe in us
But I believe we're the enemy
You don't believe in God
I don't believe in luck
They don't believe in us
But I believe we're the enemy

Uh, uh uh, uh, uh uh, uh uh
Uh, uh uh, uh uh, uh, uh uh, right now

I'm sick, down from the bones to the other side
Red-mob, we insects hide
King rat on the streets in another life
They laugh, we don't think it's funny
If what you are
Is just what you own
What have you become
When they take from you almost everything?

You don't believe in God
I don't believe in luck
They don't believe in us
But I believe we're the enemy
You don't believe in God
I don't believe in luck
They don't believe in us
But I believe we're the enemy

Destroya, Destroya, Destroya, Destroya
Destroya, Destroya, against the sun, we're the enemy
Destroya, Destroya, Destroya, Destroya

Uh uh, uh uh, uh uh (uh)
Uh uh, uh uh, uh uh
Uh uh, uh uh, uh uh (uh)
Uh uh, uh uh, uh-uh, uh-uh

(I don't believe in God) you don't believe in God
(I don't believe in luck) I don't believe in luck
(I don't believe in you) they don't believe in us
(I just believe in the enemy) but I believe we're the enemy
(I don't believe in God) you don't believe in God
(I don't believe in luck) I don't believe in luck
(I don't believe in you) they don't believe in us
(I just believe in the enemy) But I believe in the enemy

Uh uh uh uh, uh uh (uh uh-uh uh, uh uh-uh uh)
Uh uh uh uh (uh uh uh, uh uh-uh uh)
Uh uh uh uh, uh uh (uh uh-uh uh, uh uh uh)
Uh uh uh uh, uh uh (uh uh-uh uh, uh uh-uh uh)
Uh uh uh uh, uh uh (uh uh-uh uh, uh uh uh)

You don't believe in God
I don't believe in luck
They don't believe in us
But I believe we're the enemy
You don't believe in God
I don't believe in luck
They don't believe in us
But I believe we're the enemy

Destroya, Destroya, Destroya, Destroya
Destroya, Destroya, against the sun, we're the enemy
Destroya, Destroya, we're all waiting for ya
Destroya, Destroya, against the sun, we're the enemy
So show me what you got, you children of the gun
Don't hide and we don't run
Against the sun we're the enemy
So show me what you got
Against the sun we're the enemy
