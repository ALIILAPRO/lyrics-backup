		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Notice me
Take my hand
Why are we
Strangers when
Our love is strong?
Why carry on without me?

And every time I try to fly I fall without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby 
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face
It's haunting me
I guess I need you baby

I make-believe
That you are here
It's the only way 
That I see clear 
What have I done?
You seem to move on easy

And every time I try to fly I fall without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby 
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face
You're haunting me
I guess I need you baby

I may have made it rain
Please forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song's my sorry

At night I pray
That soon your face will fade away

And every time I try to fly I fall without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby 
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face
You're haunting me
I guess I need you baby
