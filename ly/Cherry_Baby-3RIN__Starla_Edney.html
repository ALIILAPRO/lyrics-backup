		  Cherry cherry baby
Move closer
I want you so much
Cherry cherry baby
In my mind
You are the queen tonight X2

I,
Want you to fight for me baby
you're mine,
Wanna show the world that i belong to you

I like you, do you like me?
I can see us get together
I feel you want
the same as I, I ,I ,I
I want you, do you want me?
Puzzle pieces fit together
I feel you want
the same as I


Cherry cherry baby
Move closer
I want you so much
Cherry cherry baby
In my mind
You are the queen tonight

Cherry cherry baby
Move closer
I want you so much
Cherry cherry baby
In my mind
You are the queen tonight

I
Would get in trouble for you baby you're
mine
No one can tell me different baby

I
I like you, do you like me?
i can see us get together
i feel you want
the same as I,I,I,I
I want you, do you want me?
Puzzle pieces fit together
I feel you want
the same as I


Cherry cherry baby
Move closer
I want you so much
Cherry cherry baby
In my mind
You are the queen tonight

Cherry cherry baby
Move closer
I want you so much
Cherry cherry baby
In my mind
You are the queen tonight
