		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And the gnats come and go
Take it as it comes
Maybe leave it all behind, oh no
You've reflected far too long
And the traces to be sown
Wrap 'em like twine on a ball
And the blues to decide, on and off again
Positioned by a hand
Set your sights across the fire
Treaded on a half fall
Never too late to die young, oh no
And be captured by the sun
Weeds, weeds, weeds, how they grow
And they burn, burn, burn, don't you know?
Bloody veins sow you're eyes
Nevеr sleep again
Pluck your last concern, over and out
This hindsight flickers, tricklеs thicker

This one by himself this one by himself
This one by himself this one
This one by himself this one by himself
This one by his own self
This one by their selves

Weeds, weeds, weeds, how they grow
And you pull, pull, pull, pull
