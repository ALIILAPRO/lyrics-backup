		<p>
		  Yeah, I really run it up, yeah
I really run it up, yeah
I really run it up, yeah
I really run it up, yeah

I really run it up, yeah
Ain't play no games with this shit
I got that worker from Paulo that hit up my guala
Then told him we made for this shit
Niggas stay working for commas, we stack up that guala
See I put my name on this shit
Flipp with that smoke on that ganja I bang for that comma
See I put my name on this shit

Hol' up, you, yeah
You said they watch how I move, yeah
You said they watch how I move, yeah
You said they watch how I move, yeah
You said they watch how I

I really run it up, baby
If the topic is money, I'm comin' up
She gon' suck 'til I pop without comin' up
I'm the main and the front, you the runner up
Really don't give a fuck, yeah
How I move, way I talk, they try pick it up
I can call when I want, she be picking up
Niggas bitches, they really be switchin' up
Can't play no game, I got too much to lose
Want me to fall, I got somethin' to prove
Really steal with no trace, I won't leave 'em a clue
And the check lookin' Reagan, I painted it blue
If it's me and my shawty we hop in the coupe
My lil' youngins go crazy, they lovin' the crew
She handle business, can't wait to recruit
Pop me a Addy, try make me a movie
I can't stand still when my diamonds keep movin'
Gave all my heart, tryna guide 'em to do it
Got partners who gon' try to guide 'em with music
Lil' bro don't play 'round, if he got it, he use it
Go against us, nigga gotta be stupid
Ride 'round with the stick, how I gotta be movin'
Everyday lit and them commas be movin'
This shit we be doin' inside of a movie

I really run it up, yeah
Ain't play no games with this shit
I got that worker from Paulo that hit up my guala
Then told him we made for this shit
Niggas stay working for commas, we stack up that guala
See I put my name on this shit
Flipp with that smoke on that ganja I bang for that comma
See I put my name on this shit

Hol' up, you, yeah
You said they watch how I move, yeah
You said they watch how I move, yeah
You said they watch how I move, yeah
You said they watch
Hol' up, you, yeah
You said they watch how I move, yeah
You said they watch how I move, yeah
You said they watch how I move, yeah
You said they watch how I

Rollie don't tick but it got big rocks
Bands in the whip, do the dash from the cops
Chain lookin' blitch, with the pole on my hip (ayy)
Let me go, I'm equipped, but don't bang with the opps (ooh)
Pain to regret but it's more than I get
Really made for this shit, money made, it don't stop
Say he heaven sent, I was made for the flip
I was made for this shit and I bang for the block (what?)
Beamer, the Jag', got the Benz on the lot
When and copped me crib just to park all the drops (damn, damn, gang, gang)
Fuck do you mean? I was lost in the drought (ayy)
Got the bag comin' in 'til the stars in our mouth (what?)
Money comin' in, so you know a nigga goin' (damn)
Dyin' with a flip so you know a nigga throw it (what?)
Style ever since in the game I'ma get
Got no time for this shit, get the bag and you know it, bitch

I really run it up, yeah
Ain't play no games with this shit
I got that worker from Paulo that hit up my guala
Then told him we made for this shit
Niggas stay working for commas, we stack up that guala
See I put my name on this shit
Flipp with that smoke on that ganja I bang for that comma
See I put my name on this shit

Hol' up, you, yeah
You said they watch how I move, yeah
You said they watch how I move, yeah
You said they watch how I move, yeah
You said they watch
Hol' up, you, yeah
You said they watch how I move, yeah
You said they watch how I move, yeah
You said they watch how I move, yeah
You said they watch how I
