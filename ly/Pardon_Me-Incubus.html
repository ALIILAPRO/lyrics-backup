		  Pardon me while I burst
Pardon me while I burst

A decade ago
I never thought I would be at twenty-three
On the verge of spontaneous combustion
Woe-is-me
But I guess that it comes with the territory
An ominous landscape of never ending calamity
I need you to hear
I need you to see that I have had all that I can take
And exploding seems like a definite possibility to me

So pardon me while I burst into flames
I've had enough of the world and it's people's mindless games
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me, I'll never be the same

Not two days ago
I was having a look in a book
And I saw a picture of a guy fried up above his knee
I said, "I can relate," 'cause lately I've been
Thinking of combustication as a welcomed vacation from
The burdens of the planet earth
Like gravity, hypocrisy, and the perils of being in 3-D
But thinking so much differently

Pardon me while I burst into flames
I've had enough of the world and it's people's mindless games
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me, I'll never be the same
Never be the same, yeah

Pardon me while I burst into flames
Pardon me, pardon me, pardon me

So pardon me while I burst into flames
I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me, I'll never be the same

Pardon me, never be the same, yeah
