		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you wanna yes or no?
Do you want to stay, do you want to go?
If you do let me know,
Do you wanna yes or no,

Do you wanna yes or no?
Been drinking from your potion,
Baby pass the lotion,
Going through the motions,
Drifting through your ocean,
Got you on your side,
Thumbing through your thighs,

What you wanna do?
Swear you always aloof,
Ain't no fault in you baby,
I just want you to choose baby,
Cause I know,

You know you want me,
And life gets lonely,
Right? What's your plan tonight?

Do you wanna yes or no?
Do you want to stay, do you want to go?
If you do let me know,
Do you wanna yes or no,

Do you wanna stay or go?
I've been on your bedside,
Waiting for your get right,
Touch me if you feel like,
Swear I'm not the feels type,
drinking from your potion,
Going through the motion,

What you wanna do?
Swear you always aloof,
Ain't no fault in you baby,
I just want you to choose baby,
Cause I know,

You know you want me,
And life get lonely,
Right? What's your plan tonight?

Do you wanna yes or no?
Do you want to stay, do you want to go?
If you do let me know,
Do you wanna yes or no?
