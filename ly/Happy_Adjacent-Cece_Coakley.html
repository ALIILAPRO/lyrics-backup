		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I sing the same song over and over will it start to sound believable and better? Will all the syllables slice my tongue into parables? And will I start to feel more beautiful?


Why's there a but on the end of every positive statement I'm making? Will I finally give in let my life begin? Be okay with being happy adjacent?


It's all good I'm doing great, I haven't cried one time today. I'm happy standing still in place when my life starts I won't be late. It's all good I'm doing great, I won't miss calls from mom today. I'm glad I'm here my ends aren't frayed. When my life starts I won't be late. 


When my tattoos start to match my outfit maybe I'll feel less like an idiot. And then I'll prove my parents wrong, finally make it off a song, and quit asking for help. 


Why's there a but on the end of every positive statement I'm making? Will I finally give in let my life begin? Be okay with being happy adjacent?


It's all good I'm doing great, I haven't cried one time today. I'm happy standing still in place when my life starts I won't be late. It's all good I'm doing great, I won't miss calls from mom today. I'm glad I'm here my ends aren't frayed. When my life starts I won't be late. 


It's all good I'm doing great. I like who I could be today. Times running out don't hesitate. When my life starts I won't be late.
