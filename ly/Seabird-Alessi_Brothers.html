		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a road I know I must go
Even though I tell myself
That road is closed
Listen lonely seabird
You've been away from land too long
Aw, too long

I don't listen to the news no more
Like an unwound clock,
You just don't seem to care
This world isn't big enough
To keep me away from you
Aw, from you

Seabird, seabird
Fly home
Seabird, seabird
Fly home
Like a lonely seabird
You've been away from land too long

Aw, too long

Suddenly you're with me
I turn and you're not there
Like a ghost, you haunt me
You find warmth in a 1-night bed

Sunsets, full moons
Don't turn you on
Like an untied dog
You just had to run
Like a lonely seabird
You've been away from land too long
Oh, no, too long

Seabird, seabird
Fly home
Seabird, seabird
Fly home
(repeat)
