		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Priests and the, the judges, rabbis pay very well
We aren't really here 'til we've found a way
A way to die, a way to die
Talking emptiness send to the edge, bump shots and religion
The saloon is my refuge

Uptown folks pay very well, indeed
Uptown folks pay very well, indeed

Back to the, the garden where the rich folks love a walk
Don't chop wood for practice, your place is here in the world
Delirium, delirium, maybe it's just cold outside
Crooked bones show the king's feet

Uptown folks pay very well, indeed
Uptown folks pay very well, indeed

Back to the, the garden
Back to the garden we will go
Back to the, the garden
Back to the garden we will go
Back to the, the garden
Back to the garden we will go
Back to the, the garden
Back to the garden we will go
Back to the, the garden
Back to the garden we will go
Back to the, the garden
Back to the garden we will go

Uptown folks pay very well
Uptown folks pay very well
Uptown folks pay very well
Uptown folks pay very well, indeed
Uptown folks pay very well
Uptown folks pay very well
Uptown folks, they pay very well
