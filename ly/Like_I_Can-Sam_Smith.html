		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He could be a sinner, or a gentleman
He could be a preacher, when your soul is damned
He could be a lawyer on a witness stand
But he'll never love you like I can, can

He could be a stranger, he gave a second glance
He could be a trophy of a one night stand
He could have your humor, but I don't understand
'Cause he'll never love you like I can, can, can

Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?
When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands
But they'll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can

A chance encounter of circumstance
Baby, he's a mantra, keeps your mind entranced
He could be the silence in this mayhem, but then again
He'll never love you like I can, can, can

Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?
When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands
But they'll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can, can

We both have demons that we can't stand
I love your demons, like devils can
If you're self-seeking, an honest man
Then stop deceiving, Lord, please

Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?
When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands
But they'll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
