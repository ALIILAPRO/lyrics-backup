		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Beneath a dead garden
Your soul twisted and hardened
Writhing and flailing
Crocodile tears so sublime
A performance of a lifetime

Fake wounded dove
Heart's cold as the moon above
Feeding me lies
To prey on the kindness of others
Poisoning friends and lovers

Wallow in a self-pitying shell
Sucking the lifeblood, leaving permanent marks
With claws that will drag me to hell
Swallowed into your energy well
Flourish in madness to harvest the sadness
Of everyone under your spell

Tangled in webs of manipulation
Corrupt

Fake wounded dove
Heart's cold as the moon above
Feeding me lies
To prey on the kindness of others
Poisoning friends and lovers

Take all that's left of us
Marked for death, solace
Severing ties
Obscuring the truth in your facade
Reveling in the applause

(Alone in this world
Nothing to fill that gaping hole in your self worth
Hollow, starved for affection
Wallow in your reflection
No home, no return
Rotting away, you've lost control
There's no answer
Sorrow, casting the first stone
Swallowed into the unknown
Now I can finally see that your heart is empty)

Tree of knowledge
Bearing the weight of the world
We learn to forget
As we burn and regret
In this never-ending cycle of life and death
I am a soul denied
Searching for a place to die

Still waters turn foul
Stagnation leads to decay
The graceless gods
Rotten to the core
Eating each other
Forevermore

We learn to forget
As we burn and regret
In this never-ending cycle of life and death
We are the souls denied
Searching for a place to die
(Place to die)
