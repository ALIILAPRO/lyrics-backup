		  Goin' dumb, goin' crazy (Loesoe goin' crazy)
Goin' dumb, goin' crazy
Goin' dumb, yeah, goin' crazy
Goin' dumb (goin' dumb) 
Out my mind (out my mind)
Chasin' dollar signs (dollar signs) 
Sippin' red wine (red wine)
We all losin' time (losin' time) 
Bae, don't lose your mind (lose your mind)
Bae, I'm boujee, huh (boujee, huh) 
This like movies, huh (movies, huh)

Yeah, don't rock Gucci, huh 
Catch me draped in Louis, huh 
Posted with that toolie, huh 
Boy, don't make me do it, huh
Playin' games, you stupid, huh 
I don't love, fuck cupid, huh
Aimin' like Cam Newton, huh, yeah
They think that we ruthless, huh, and I know they love that
Posted where the thugs at, Bay Bay Kid, no Rugrat
Cops kick the door, they like, "Where the drugs at?"
Drop and hit the floor, down where the rug at
Posted with the bros, made it out the store
Livin' by the code, I can't break down, I cannot erode
This the takedown, we go toe-to-toe
I'm not fake, wow, we go blow-for-blow
Is the bass loud? Come and let me know

Goin' dumb, goin' crazy (Loesoe goin' crazy)
Goin' dumb, goin' crazy
Goin' dumb, yeah, goin' crazy
Goin' dumb (goin' dumb) 
Out my mind (out my mind)
Chasin' dollar signs (dollar signs) 
Sippin' red wine (red wine)
We all losin' time (losin' time) 
Bae, don't lose your mind (lose your mind)
Bae, I'm boujee, huh (boujee, huh) 
Clips like movies, huh (movies, huh)

Goin' dumb, goin' crazy, sip some, kill some
Red rum, Vietnam, send a bomb, go dumb
Out my body, out my, out my mind
You gon' be mad when you see a nigga shine
Go 730, go 730, nigga, go slide
Put him in a hearse, put him in the dirt, shit can get televised
I just counted up a few Ms on a Addy
I just spent a couple of these racks, she a baddie
I just heard a snitch got whacked now I'm happy 
Sippin' on dope, nigga, and I'm pure, thousand gram key
That's fo sho', that's for sure, killer O.D.
I got stripes by Big Johnson, OG
Take a 35 Christ fit and I go ski
Hundred racks on a nigga head, nose gettin' wiped

Goin' dumb, goin' crazy (Loesoe goin' crazy)
Goin' dumb, goin' crazy
Goin' dumb, yeah, goin' crazy
Goin' dumb (goin' dumb) 
Out my mind (out my mind)
Chasin' dollar signs (dollar signs) 
Sippin' red wine (red wine)
We all losin' time (losin' time) 
Bae, don't lose your mind (lose your mind)
Bae, I'm boujee, huh (boujee, huh) 
Clips like movies, huh (movies, huh)

Known to kill shit, drill shit, all of the above
F&N hard to deal with, better give it up
Not from earth, on some real shit, eat my stardust
Get off the turf, you ain't ill, bitch, they ain't hard as us
Who is you? Ain't got nobody harder not as us
Niggas fool, but I'm chrome-hearted, never gave a fuck
We like glue, can't be watered down 'cause you know we stuck
Die new 'cause you see me now, man, you know it's up

Goin' dumb, goin' crazy (Loesoe goin' crazy)
Goin' dumb, goin' crazy
Goin' dumb, yeah, goin' crazy
Goin' dumb (goin' dumb) 
Out my mind (out my mind)
Chasin' dollar signs (dollar signs) 
Sippin' red wine (red wine)
We all losin' time (losin' time) 
Bae, don't lose your mind (lose your mind)
Bae, I'm boujee, huh (boujee, huh) 
Clips like movies, huh (movies, huh)

Chickens came Caucasian, find a trap, go brazy
King Pluto the greatest, ice like Radric Davis
Iced out, damn, go crazy, go retarded
If I wasn't a rapper, I'd be a rich nigga regardless
Fuck a high price, bitches livin' my life
Higher than a ceilin' these G6's bitin'
Hoes play with them pills, these hoes want that white, uh
Playin' in the field where niggas risk they life
Hundred racks on a nigga head, nose gettin' wiped

Goin' dumb, goin' crazy (Loesoe goin' crazy)
Goin' dumb, goin' crazy
Goin' dumb, yeah, goin' crazy
Goin' dumb (goin' dumb) 
Out my mind (out my mind)
Chasin' dollar signs (dollar signs) 
Sippin' red wine (red wine)
We all losin' time (losin' time) 
Bae, don't lose your mind (lose your mind)
Bae, I'm boujee, huh (boujee, huh) 
Clips like movies, huh (movies, huh)
