		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Only when you're gone
Only when you're gone
Only when you're gone
And away
Only when you're gone
Gonna need a hammer and nails
To construct this bitter love song
This cruel testamented song
That rings out only when you're gone
Only when you're gone
Only when you're gone
Only when you're gone
And away
Only when you're gone
Oh

Rude are the tongues of love
That speak of mercy for us all
And leave us only with a song
And leave us only with a song
Now it's a cold and hollow whisper
That consoles my body when you're gone
Only when you're gone
Only when you're gone
Only when you're gone
And away
Only when you're gone
Oh

And its only when you're gone
And away
Your ghost runs through me in that special way
It's a nice old town
My hometown
Come for the darkness in this prison cell
I love you long and I love you well

So bury me in the kitchen
Bury me in the stones
Oh, bury me everywhere you go
In the shadows of the hallway
Oh, for we do no longer know
What we can no longer hold
On days like these our heads fill up with smoke
And our memories grow old
Only when you're gone
Only when you're gone
Only when you're gone
And away
Only when you're gone

Only when you're gone
Only, only when you're gone
Only when you're gone
And away
Only when you're gone

Gone away
And gone away
Oh
