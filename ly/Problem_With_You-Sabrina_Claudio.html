		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Was I cold?
Went to hold you, but I wanted to control you
Paranoid
What's wrong with me?
Why am I pointing out everything wrong with you?

Let's talk about last night, who were you with?
Why didn't you answer me?
All of these questions, criticizing
You bring out the worst in me

The problem with you is
That I can't get you off my mind
And I think about you all the time
It's your fault that I don't feel right
The problem with you is
That you're all that I dream about
And you're not right here right now
Took a minute, but I figured it out
The problem with me is you
Oh no, no
Oh-oh-oh-oh

When we met
I was careless with all of my emotions
But the closer we'd get
I became more attentive, more protective, more aggressive

Let's talk about last night, you went to sleep
Didn't even talk to me
You left me with questions, agonizing
You bring out the worst in me

The problem with you is
That I can't get you off my mind
And I think about you all the time
It's your fault that I don't feel right
The problem with you is
That you're all that I dream about
And you're not right here right now
Took a minute, but I figured it out
The problem with me is you

Now I understand why I feel this way
You're the one to blame, you should be ashamed
You should be ashamed
Now I understand why I feel this way
You're the one to blame, you should be ashamed
You should be ashamed
The problem with me is you
Now I understand why I feel this way (With me is you)
You're the one to blame, you should be ashamed
You should be ashamed (Ooh, it's you)
Now I understand why I feel this way (You)
You're the one to blame, you should be ashamed
You should be ashamed

The problem with you is
Can't get you off my mind
Think about you all the time
The problem with you is
You're all I dream about
And you're not right here right now
I figured it out, the problem with me is you
