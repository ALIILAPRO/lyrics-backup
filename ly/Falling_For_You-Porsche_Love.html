		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How am I supposed to improve
If you can't give me the full picture of what I experienced?
Because I am not going to let someone feel something who didn't feel
I don't hold it against people...
Yes you will, because you're gonna hold this against me

We left, we can't go back
Still feel you in my chest
Your voice rings inside my head
I'm falling for you again
I'm falling for you
I'm falling for you
I'm falling for you
I'm falling for you

Been through highs and lows but I still need you the most, yeah
I still hold you close even though we haven't spoke, yeah
Don't believe me when I say I got your back, right?
I thought even through the pain that we'd get past fights
Gotta pray that we see this through like last time
Gotta say, I don't even know the last time
That we both had the patience my love
We took a break and we messed it all up
And my mistakes, I know I can never change 'em
I'm on my way, I won't let you walk away love

We left, we can't go back
Still feel you in my chest
Your voice rings inside my head
I'm falling for you again
I'm falling for you
I'm falling for you
I'm falling for you
I'm falling for you
I'm falling for you
I'm falling for you
I'm falling for you
I'm falling for you
