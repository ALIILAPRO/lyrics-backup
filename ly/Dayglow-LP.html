		  DAYGLOW
You touch, touch, touch the sun in me somehow…..
I say this all the time
And it breaks this heart of mine
When I can’t decide
Does it make sense to discover
The pain inside another
Then turn to ice
If you don’t believe in something besides fear of discomfort
Can anybody know what is wrong or right
If I take all of your love
And I take all of your love
It’s the trip that gets us higher into the night
And we go dayglow
We can’t say no
We just go dayglow
We can’t say nooo nooo
Not a day goes by that I don’t know
Ohhhhh ohhhhh
We were dayglow
I wanna feel your darkness
And hold you in the farthest place that you run
Your father and your mother don’t have to be
the lover that you become
(I don’t wanna know)
It’s all a bunch a bullshit
There’s not another culprit
That’s ever gonna hurt worse than honesty
So take all of my love
And I’ll take all of your love
It’s the trip that gets us higher into the dream
And we go dayglow
We can’t say no
We just go dayglow
We can’t say nooo nooo
Not a day goes by that I don’t know
Ohhhhh ohhhhh
We were dayglow
So hold me tight as time goes by
I’ll hold the light beside you
Cause every life’s another try
And I just stay inside you
