		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby don't stop, don't stop
We're getting to the sweet spot, sweet spot
Baby it's a sure shot, sure shot
We're getting to the sweet spot, sweet spot

I wanna with you, I wanna with you
I wanna with you, I wanna with you

See you dancin' like you wantin' my attention
See you dancin', see you dancin'
Now your body's movin' into my direction
My direction, my direction

Baby, what you waiting for?
You got the green light
Don't you hold back no more
Let's live our best life

So baby don't stop, don't stop
We're getting to the sweet spot, sweet spot
Baby it's a sure shot, sure shot
We're getting to the sweet spot, sweet spot

I wanna with you, I wanna with you
I wanna with you, I wanna with you

Everybody wants to leave here with somebody
Everybody, everybody
Time of night we start to dip into the candy
Give it to me, give it to me

Baby, what you waiting for?
You got the green light
Don't you hold back no more
Let's live our best life

So baby don't stop, don't stop
We're getting to the sweet spot, sweet spot
Baby it's a sure shot, sure shot
We're getting to the sweet spot, sweet spot

I wanna with you, I wanna with you
I wanna with you (yeah), I wanna with you
I wanna with you

Woo-ah!
