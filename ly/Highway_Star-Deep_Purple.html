		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nobody gonna take my car, I'm gonna race it to the ground
Nobody gonna beat my car, it's gonna break the speed of sound
Ooh it's a killing machine, it's got everything
Like a drawing power big fat tires everything

I love it and I need it, I bleed it
Yeah it's a wild hurricane
I'm a highway star, yeah

Nobody gonna take my girl I'm gonna keep her to the end
Nobody gonna have my girl she stays close on every bend
Ooh she's a killing machine, she's got everything
Like a moving mouth, body control and everything

I Love her and I need her, yeah
That's who turns me on
Alright, hold tight I'm a highway star

Nobody gonna take my head now that I'm on the road again
Nobody gonna take my head, they're gonna be my death again
Ooh I'm in heaven again I've got everything
Like an open road, all my prayers and everything

I love it and I need it, I bleed it
Yeah it's a wild hurricane
I'm a highway star, yeah

Nobody gonna take my car, I'm gonna race it to the ground
Nobody gonna beat my car, it's gonna break the speed of sound
Ooh it's a killing machine, it's got everything
Like a drawing power big fat tires everything

I love it and I need it, I bleed it
Yeah it's a wild hurricane
I'm a highway star
I'm a highway star
I'm a highway star, yeah
