		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a woman crying out tonight
Her world has changed
She asks God why
Her oldest son has died
And now her daughter cries
She can't sleep at night

Downtown
Another day for all the suits and ties
Another war to fight
There's no regard for life
How do they sleep at night
How can we make things right?
Just want to make this right

We believe
We believe
We believe
We believe
We believe
We believe
In this love

We are all the same
Human in all our ways and all of pain
(So let it be)
There's a love that could fall down like rain
(Let us see)
Let forgiveness wash away the pain
(What we need)
And no one really knows what they are searching for
(We believe)
This world is crying for so much more

We believe
We believe
We believe
We believe
We believe
We believe
In this love

So this world
Is too much
For you to take
Just lay it down and follow me
I'll be everything you need
In every way

We believe
We believe
We believe
We believe
We believe
We believe
In this love
(In this love)
We believe
(In this love)
We believe
(In this love)
We believe
(In this love)
