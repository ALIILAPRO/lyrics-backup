		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Find the light 
Find the light 
In your darkest days 
I promise you you'll see 

I've never faced a stress like this before 
I've turned to run  
But there's no way home 
I never thought I'd say 
What's it like to feel okay 
I'm sick of the negative state 

Find the light  
Find the light  
In your darkest days  
I promise you you'll see 
Find the light  
Find the light 
In your darkest days  
I promise you you'll see 

No matter what I found 
The shadows always end 
I need to break my tired mind  
(Tired mind) 
You're just like me 
Being buried in between 
Oh, I'm sick of the negative state 

Find the light  
Find the light  
In your darkest days  
I promise you you'll see 
Find the light  
Find the light  
In your darkest days  
I promise you you'll see 

When the walls are caving in 
cnd the lights taken away 
What I've become 
It'll never come undone 
To come undone 
When the storm tears life away 
cnd the night brings disarray 
Will I break free 
When the light rips through the dawn 
Rips through the dawn 

LET'S GO 

Oh, I promise you you'll see 
I promise you you'll see
