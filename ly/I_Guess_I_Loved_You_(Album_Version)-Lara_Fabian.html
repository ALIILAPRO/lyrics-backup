		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now
Tomorrow is all there is
No need to look behind the door
You won't be standing there no more
I had my chance
To dance another dance
I didn't even realize
That this was all love
And no lies
Then lost you

While
I guess I loved you
Oh, less, less than I should
Now all there is is me and me
I turn around and all I see
The past where I have left our destiny

Now
Tomorrow's a mystery
I cannot live without a dream
Vanishing from reality
I want to now
Would you come back to me?
Now that I finally realize
You are my whole
You are my life
I need you

I guess I loved you
Oh, less, less than I should
Now all there is is me and me
I turn around and all I see
The past where I have left our destiny
Oh, oh, oh, I, I guess I loved you
Oh, less, oh less, less, less than I could
Another time
Another run
To mend both of our broken hearts
To tell you how much I can love you now
I, I guess, I guess I loved you
I guess I loved you
