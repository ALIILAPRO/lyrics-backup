		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Imagine myself in an automobile
A hundred miles an hour, only me at the wheel
I want it to shine, to be only mine
The engine has to be just one of a kind

How many dollars do I need sir?
You know I sure don't have a lot
There must be something we can work out
Well, I'll take it anyway

I guess I could make room for one, a bottle of rum
You and me together riding into the sun
Live without care, with the wind in my hair
I'm driving through the desert, yeah I'll go anywhere

Take me where the wheels take me, far away
Wheels take me, I can't stay
Wheels take me, any place today

Imagine myself in an automobile
A hundred miles an hour, if you know how I feel
Alone with my mind, leave my worries behind
Might even reach the border, it's just a matter of time, yeah now!

I said take me where the wheels take me, far away
Wheels take me, I can't stay
Wheels take me, any place today

Oh I'm going to San Diego, here I come
San Francisco, won't be long
Sacramento, whoa yeah, in the sun
I just might go

Oh, I said I'm going to San Diego (San Diego) and San Jose
San Fransisco (San Fransisco) and hang by the bay
Sacramento (Sacramento), whoa, yeah all the way
I just might go all the way to Mexico
I just might go all the way down to Mexico
