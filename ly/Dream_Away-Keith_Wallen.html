		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Out on the colder side of the moon
Seeking a way to get back to you
Waking up to never-ending light
I just need to close my eyes, I just need to close my eyes

And dream away of a new life
Try to forget my worries for a while
And isolate in my own mind
Nothing matters but to feel alive

Out on the colder side of the moon
Carry your name, it's all I can do
Dark abyss comes through my line of sight
I just need to close my eyes, I just need to close my eyes

And dream away of a new life
Try to forget my worries for a while
And isolate in my own mind
Nothing matters but to feel alive, nothing matters but to feel alive

Dream away of a new life
Try to forget my worries for a while
And isolate in my own mind
Nothing matters but to feel alive

And dream away
And dream away
And dream away
Nothing matters but to feel alive
Dream away
