		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thinking 'bout 'Ya, constantly
Captivated by Your love, Your love
You're my promise keeper faithfully
In You is where my hope comes from

I don't really care 'bout what they say
Everything I am now walks by faith
Yes, I'm holding on to promises

In You, I believe
Nothing gonna change my mind
I'm set on who You are, You are
In You, I believe not gonna waste my time
Ain't gonna pay no mind, no mind
Thinking 'bout
Thinking 'bout anything other than You

I'm holding on to everything
The promises within Your word, Your word
Circumstances bow their knee
To the God that made the entire world

I don't really care 'bout what they say
Everything I am now walks by faith
Yes, I'm holding on to who You are

In You, I believe
Nothing gonna change my mind
I'm set on who You are, You are
In You, I believe not gonna waste my time
Ain't gonna pay no mind, no mind
Thinking 'bout
Thinking 'bout anything other than You

(Hey, three, two, one)
Now I'm gonna take my praise up
Turn it up loud
With the sound of the heavenlies
Heavily found in a faith so real
Believing in You don't matter how I feel
Even in the hard times faith like steel
Ayy, facts speak facts
But I'm listening to the truth
And the truth is You, God (Okay, okay, okay)
Now hit 'em with a (Fact)
Sickness might be what I feel
But the truth is: by Your stripes I'm healed
(Fact) things weighing heavy on me
But who the Son sets free is free indeed
(Fact) worried 'bout what I hear
But the truth is love drives out all fear
I got faith i got faith
I got faith

I don't really care 'bout what they say
Everything I am now walks by faith
Yes, I'm holding onto promises

In You, I believe
Nothing gonna change my mind
I'm set on who You are, You are
In You, I believe not gonna waste my time
Ain't gonna pay no mind, no mind
Thinking 'bout
Thinking 'bout anything other than You
Nothing gonna change my mind
I'm set on who You are, You are
In You, I believe not gonna waste my time
Ain't gonna pay no mind, no mind
Thinking 'bout
Thinking 'bout anything other than You
