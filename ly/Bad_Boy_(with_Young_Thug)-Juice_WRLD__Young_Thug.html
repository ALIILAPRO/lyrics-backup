		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
(Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)
Yeah

Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, I'm a bad boy
Went and got off my ass and got to the cash
And got in my bag, boy
Please don't think it's sweet, I stay with the heat
Even though I'm a sad boy
You better watch the way you breathe around me
'Fore that breath be your last, boy (let's go, yeah)

I've been drinkin' red rasp', boy (red, yeah)
I've been trappin' all these birds, McCoy (McCoy, brr, brr, brr, brr)
Newborn baby, my Richard Mille nine months (ooh)
Overseas, hundreds gettin', bitch, croissants (uh)

Wrecked the GTR (skrrt), I love to crash cars
I'm a bad boy so I got a bad broad
Futuristic rides imported from Mars (skrrt, skrrt)
Smith & Wesson .45, put a hole in his heart
Better not play with me, killers they stay with me
Your bitty lay with me
She fell in love with my ice, yeah, that hockey rink
Ain't come to kick it, I'm not on the soccer team
Knew I would make it, it's part of my prophecy
Raf Simons match my Prada jeans
I'ma do the dash, get to the bag, ain't no one as bad as me

Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, I'm a bad boy
Went and got off my ass and got to the cash
And got in my bag, boy
Please don't think it's sweet, I stay with the heat
Even though I'm a sad boy
You better watch the way you breathe around me
'Fore that breath be your last boy (it's on, yeah)

I've been drinkin' red rasp', boy (red, yeah)
I've been trappin' all these birds, McCoy (McCoy)
Newborn baby, my Richard Mille nine months (ooh)
Overseas, hundreds gettin', bitch, croissants (uh)

Sticky, sticky, Ricky, I smoke Skittles not no sticky (sticky)
I shot at his mommy, now he no longer mention me (thot, thot)
You say you want smoke and I've been comin' down the chimney (whoa)
You got barbecue, you bitches, I'm so fried and they crispy (ooh)
I had on Margielas when I shot at the cunt (murk)
Act like you want war and they gon' smoke you like a blunt (smoke you like a blunt)
I'm just keepin' it real with ya, I'm just bein' blunt (I'm just bein' blunt)
Porsche Carrera, got the pipes out the back like a skunk, yeah (skrrt)

Skrrt, skrrt 
Skrrt, skrrt
That's just the sound of the 'Vette (skrrt)
I keep me the vest (skrrt), I keep me a test (skrrt)
I read your message (skrrt), I bust on her chest (skrrt)
I made a mess (skrrt), I hope for the best (skrrt), go like a chaser (skrrt)
I be the best (skrrt), I got the neck (skrrt)
I can turn a check (skrrt), live like Project X (skrrt)

Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, I'm a bad boy
Went and got off my ass and got to the cash
And got in my bag, boy
Please don't think it's sweet, I stay with the heat
Even though I'm a sad boy
You better watch the way you breathe around me
'Fore that breath be your last boy (it's on, yeah)

I've been drinkin' red rasp', boy (red, yeah)
I've been trappin' all these birds, McCoy (McCoy, brr, brr, brr, brr)
Newborn baby, my Richard Mille nine months (ooh)
Overseas, hundreds gettin', bitch, croissants (uh)
