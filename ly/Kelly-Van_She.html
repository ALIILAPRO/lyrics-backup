		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Kelly was a young girl, looking in the mirror, doing what young kids do
Watching out the window, thinking of all the things that she should do
Sheâ??s running all the time, sheâ??s running blind.
Itâ??s raining all the time, the clock hit nine, then she met me.

[Chorus]
Oh Kelly, do what you need to come
Oh Kelly, you know I see you running

Sheâ??s sitting back know, painting in her taylors, thinking of me and you
Listening to her player, missing out all the Prince and tunes she knew
Sheâ??s running out of time, sheâ??s running blind.
Itâ??s raining all the time, the clock hit nine, then she met me.

[Chorus]

Oh Kelly, do what you need to come
Oh Kelly, you know I see you running
Oh Kelly, do what you need to come
Oh Kelly, you know I see you running
