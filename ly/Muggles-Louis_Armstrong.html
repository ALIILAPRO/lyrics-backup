		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Been snoopin' 'round the door
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Been snoopin' 'round my door
You can wag your tail
But I ain't gonna feed you no more

You told me you was high-class
But I could see through that
Yes, you told me you was high-class
But I could see through that
And daddy, I know
You ain't no real cool cat

You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Been snoopin' 'round the door
You're just an old hound dog
Been snoopin' 'round my door
You can wag your tail
But I ain't gonna feed you no more, oh play it on Sam, oh!

Aw, listen to that there old hound dog
Oh, play it, it s'all right in here
Oh, listen to that there old hound dog holler
Oh, play it boy, play it
Oh, you make me feel good
Oh, do the mess around right now, yeah
Now wag your tail
Oh, get it now
Oh, get it now, get it, get it, get it
Oh, go, holler boy

You made me feel so blue
You made me weep and moan
You made me feel so blue
Well you made me weep and moan
'Cause you ain't looking for a woman
All you lookin' is for a home

You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Quit snoopin' 'round the door
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Quit snoopin' 'round my door
You can wag your tail
But I ain't gonna feed you no more, oh!
