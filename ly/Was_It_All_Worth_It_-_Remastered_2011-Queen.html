		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oooh, oooh
Ah ah ah ah ah oh

What is there left for me to do in this life
Did I achieve what I had set in my sights
Am I a happy man, or is this sinking sand
Was it all worth it, was it all worth it
Yeah, now hear my story, let me tell you about it
We bought a drum kit, I blew my own trumpet
Played the circuit, thought we were perfect
Was it all worth it, ooh giving (hey yeah) all my heart and soul and
Staying up all night, was it all worth it (hey yeah)
Living breathing rock 'n' roll (ah), a Godforsaken life
Was it all worth it, was it all worth it (hey) all these years

Put down our money without counting the cost
It didn't matter if we won - if we lost
Yes we were vicious, yes we could kill
Yes we were hungry, yes we were brill - ha ha haa
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
We served a purpose, like a bloody circus
We were so dandy (yeah) we love you madly
Was it all worth it
Living breathing rock 'n' roll, this Godforsaken life
Was it all worth it yeah, was it all worth it
When the hurly burly's done

We went to bali, saw God and dali
So mystic, surrealistic
Was it all worth it yeah yeah, giving all my heart and soul
Staying up all night, was it all worth it
Ooh living breathing rock 'n' roll this never ending fight
Was it all worth it, was it all worth it
Yes it was a worthwhile experience
Ha ha ha ha haa
It was worth it
Ha ha
