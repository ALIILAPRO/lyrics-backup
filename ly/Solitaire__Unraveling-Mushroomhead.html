		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Locked away in a cage
My rage has got the best of me
Time finds a way each day
Of leaving less of me behind
I find this fight must be won
Inside my mind
So uptight and confined
Often blinded by the light

Taking its toll
On my system

Like some played out existence

Time ticks away
These last few moments
Is there anything we've left unsaid?
I'm on a quest for atonement
I've got to find peace of mind
And a place to rest

Biding my time
Until I'm strong enough to fight back

Hope

I hope against hope for some resistance
Been taking it out on my system

Time ticks away
These last few moments
Is there anything we've left unsaid?
I'm on a quest for atonement
I've got to find peace of mind
And a place to rest

Time ticks away
These last few moments
Is there anything we've left unsaid?
I'm on a quest for atonement
I've got to find peace of mind
And a place to rest

Rest, rest

Rest, rest

There's a calm before the storm
And the western front is quiet
I've got Rembrandt as my right hand
And Solo as my pilot

There's a calm before the storm
And the western front is quiet
I've got Rembrandt as my right hand
And Solo as my pilot

Condemned man (Condemned!)
Convicted man (Convicted!)
Could not save my life, cutting strand by strand (Strand by strand)

Condemned man (Condemned!)
Convicted man (Convicted!)
Could not save my life, cutting strand by strand (Strand by strand)

Passing it off, like some kind of king,
You don't know peace 'til you've had suffering (What's suffering?)

All of this so called resolve but you haven't tasted pain,
Have you ever been inside of the new masterpiece?

Rest!

Have you ever been inside?

Rembrandt as my right hand, and Solo as my pilot

Have you ever been inside the new masterpiece?

Rembrandt as my right hand, and Solo as my pilot

Condemned man (Condemned!)
Convicted man (Convicted!)
Could not save my life, cutting strand by strand (Strand by strand)

Condemned man (Condemned!)
Convicted man (Convicted!)
Could not save my life, cutting strand by strand (Strand by strand)

(By strand, by strand, by strand, by strand)
Condemned, condemned!

(By strand, by strand)
