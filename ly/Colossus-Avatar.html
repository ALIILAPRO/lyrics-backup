		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Colossus
Arise

In the image of man
We breed our demons
On the wide wings of science
Our abomination of a child flies

Ask me for your name, my friend
Tell me what I feel like to you
Is it coming to an end?
I don't understand it

Colossus
Colossus, arise

In old bones in the soil
We plant a garden
We are harvesting progress
The glow of a worm inside a child's eye

Ask me for your name, my friend
Tell me what I feel like to you
Is it coming to an end?
I don't understand it

Colossus
Colossus, arise

Make your way up to the top
Of electric mountains

Ask me for your name, my friend
Tell me what I feel like to you
Is it coming to an end?
I don't understand it

Colossus
Colossus, arise
Colossus
Arise
