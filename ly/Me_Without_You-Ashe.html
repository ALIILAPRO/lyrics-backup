		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Red velvet wallpaper stained by the cigarette smoke
Of people more in love than we could ever know
And it's midnight and I wanna go, but you don't

You get in the passenger seat, just to give me your reasons
And you cut the brakes just to keep me from leaving
Your hands on the wheel drove us into a wall

The only world I could exist in
Was one you lived in
Ooh, you almost had me fooled

But I can be me without you
I don't feel lost without you
Go find yourself
You let me down
Down, down, down, down
I can be me without you
You don't believe that it's true
Go find yourself
You let me down
Down, down, down, down

I can be funny and I can be interesting
People can like me it shouldn't be threatening
These are all things that I've learned now that I've been alone

We were so young when it started 
I thought you might grow up but that didn't happen
You're actually smaller now 
I can't believe I stayed long as I did

The only world I could exist in
Was one you lived in
Ooh, you almost had me fooled

But I can be me without you
I don't feel lost without you
Go find yourself
You let me down
Down, down, down, down
I can be me without you
You don't believe that it's true
Go find yourself
You let me down
Down, down, down, down

Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down

I can be me without you
The sun doesn't shine 'cause of you
Go find yourself
You let me down
Down, down, down, down
I can be me without you
You don't believe that it's true
Go find yourself
You let me down
Down, down, down, down, down
