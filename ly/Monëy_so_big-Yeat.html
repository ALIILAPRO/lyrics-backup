		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, my money big body, my money Tonka
No, I don't need you, I really don't want you (damn, Trgc made that?)
My money been twerkin', my money do dances (woah)
Yeah, shut up
I already heard you, I don't wanna answer
You ruin everythin' you touch, you a cancer (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I'm on the side where we win, no
You not that guy 'cause I'm him, yeah
I ride that big body right out the lot, it's a GLE, came with a tint
I don't wanna hear none of the shit that you sayin' 
You cap out your chinny-chin-chin (none)
I'm rockin' the latest designer, the finest of fur 
It's that chinchilla skin
Yeah, they tryna copy the wave 
And I told them they can't even surf a wave on it, yeah (ooh)
They steady been copyin' my sound, they some birds 
They a parrot if I'm bein' honest, yeah
Why you been cappin' 'bout your whole life? (Yeah)
How is you rappin' 'bout a whole lie? (How?)
How you stay rappin' 'bout these damn drugs
You ain't ever try it once your whole life? (Cap)

Yeah, these kids is some motherfuckin' burgers, I'm callin' them Five Guys
Yeah, these kids frier than a grease ball, yeah, he fried-fried (yeah, fried-fried)
Yeah, I just pulled up in that Bentley, that bitch got them frog eyes
They tryna bite the swag but they bitches bitin' our dicks (yeah)
I count every time she sucked me up, that's a hundred and sixty licks (woah)
Can't even count the songs I made in a month, that's a hundred and sixty hits (yeah)
They say, "Yeat, you keep on evolvin', how you so steady with it?" (Woah)
They say, "Yeat, how your pockets swollen? You gotta show me the shit" (woah)
'Bout to tell you how I'm doin' and shit (woah)
I got the Devil on my phone, he told me, keep doin' this shit
Yeah, Devil taught me how to get rich
Yeah, how many bands? 6-6 (woah)
Twizz in a minivan, couple of big sticks
Bitch 'bout to ride me like she on a RipStik
Yeah, they said, "What's that red on your chest?" 
I told 'em, "That's your bitch lipstick"
Yeah, I pulled up in a Tonka and a helicopter goin' nuts (yeah)
Yeah, I had a fifty band and I turned it to a honeybun (honeybun)
Didn't even need to go sign me a deal 
For these flawless diamonds, bitch, I'm already up
I got a lil' thotty, that bitch is the baddest 
She up in that coupe on me, suckin' me up (woo, woo)

Yeah, my money big body, my money Tonka honeybun
No, I don't need you, I really don't want you (woah)
My money been twerkin', my money do dances (woah)
Yeah, shut up
I already heard you, I don't wanna answer
You ruin everythin' you touch, you a cancer (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I'm on the side where we win, no
You not that guy 'cause I'm him, yeah (oh)
I ride that big body right out the lot, it's a GLE, came with a tint (woah)
I don't wanna hear none of the shit that you sayin' 
You cap out your chinny-chin-chin (none)
I'm rockin' the latest designer, the finest of fur 
It's that chinchilla skin
Yeah, they tryna copy the wave 
And I told them they can't even surf a wave on it, yeah (ooh)
They steady been copyin' my sound, they some birds 
They a parrot if I'm bein' honest, yeah
Why you been cappin' 'bout your whole life? (Yeah)
How is you rappin' 'bout a whole lie? (How?)
How you stay rappin' 'bout these damn drugs 
You ain't ever try it once your whole life? (Cap)
