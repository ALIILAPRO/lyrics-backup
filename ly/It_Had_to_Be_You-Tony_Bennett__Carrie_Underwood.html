		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It seems like dreams I've always have
Could be, should be making me glad
But why am I blue?
It's up to you to explain

I'm thinking maybe, baby, I'll go away
Someday, someway you'll come and say
It's you that I need
Maybe you'll be pleading in vain

It had to be you, it had to be you
I wandered around and finally found
The somebody who could make me be blue
Could make me be true or even be glad
Just to be sad, thinking of you

Some others I've seen, might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss
But they wouldn't do 
For nobody else gave me a thrill 
With all your faults I love you still

It had to be you, 
Wonderful you, it had to be you
