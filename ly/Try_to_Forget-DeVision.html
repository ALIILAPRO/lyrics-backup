		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You...
You return in the night
Don't have a person to hold you
And you think about the past time
When you were, when you were still loved

You go to bed alone
Don't have a person to warm you
And you think about your last love
Then you try to forget

Try to forget
Try to forget
But you can't forget

You
You will show your tears and hide
And you hope that someone knows
That you are alone and takes you
And takes you in his arms

Your secrets are your thoughts
Write them down and start to cry,
Write them down and start to scream
Because you know you are alone
