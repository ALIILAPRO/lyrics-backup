		  Er'body, TurnDaFucUp er'body, TurnDaFucUp
Er'body, TurnDaFucUp er'body, TurnDaFucUp
Er'body, TurnDaFucUp er'body, TurnDaFucUp
Er'body, TurnDaFucUp er'body, TurnDaFucUp

Yeah, if you want it
You can get it right here
You can get stuffed in the trunk in the rear
Niggas gettin dunked in the pier
Rollin' thru the truck with a
Blunt in the ear
Think it until you make the dope
You're no high roller
I can sip two beers, I can turn bipolar
Schizo, crazy, I'm flipped, I warped
That's why no more fuckin'
With prescription drugs
Everybody got stuck on that road to stardum
But the banks aren't empty
Shanks aren't empty my brain's all safety
I'm locked to the beat
Neva fall off, even if I loose my feet
I work all day, so I sleep all night
Then wake up with the Bentley
With the football lights
That's how I took yo wife told "baby
We can kick it like a football high"


Sticky fingers, God of the underground
Girls be like "Oh my God"
When I come around you waskally wabbit's
Now I gotta gun 'em down
First you wanted beef
Now you givin' me the runaround
I'll take yo pride
You'll give me my respect
See if you can cash this reality check
I'm half from Ret, but rest assured
When it come to ya'll niggas, less is more
Yeah, I took the hustlers oath
They said money don't grow on trees
I'm raking the doe
Make something outta nothin'
That's my upbringing
We don't play God but we
Got the club swingin'
I'm br-br-br-br-brolic
Don't need no trainer
Don't need no friends, don't need no favors
I'm way too loud, I don't need no neighbors
Shawty ain't giving head? Well
That's a no-brainer
