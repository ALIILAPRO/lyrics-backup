		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All my body's undulating
Back and forth but it's too late and
There's no cure and no sedating
All this pain we're generating
This prolonged, insane, grotesque thing
That we wrongly have been naming "love"
Honey, this ain't love, no

Pretty soon, I will be feeding
On the taps your little feet in
Silver boots make when they're fleeing town
And I can't get around to being
Much surprised by memories speeding
On the road on which we're bleeding
Love
Honey, this ain't love

I want you to hold me
Perpendicularly only
A sundial for the gods
We were born, born to fail
I want you to hold me
Perpendicularly only
A sundial for the gods
We were born, born to fail

It's raining cats and dogs and lightning
Strikes my heart and sheds some light on
To the fact it ain't so frightening
How there hasn't been your pretty sight in
So much time, my teeth are whitening
From the blood we shed while biting
Love
Honey, this ain't love

I want you to hold me
Perpendicularly only
A sundial for the gods
We were born, born to fail
I want you to hold me
Perpendicularly only
A sundial for the gods
We were born, born to fail

I want you to hold me
Perpendicularly only
A sundial for the gods
We were born, born to fail

Only
Born to fail

I want you to hold me
Perpendicularly only
A sundial for the gods
We were born, born to fail
