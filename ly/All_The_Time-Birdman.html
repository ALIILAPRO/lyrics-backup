		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Chorus]
Nigga I'ma stunt, yeah I'ma shine
Grind all the time with this money on my mind
Gun in my hand, nigga roll extra clips
45 mac elevens all chrome, shit
Nigga I'ma hunter and I ride big time
26, 28's nigga stay fly
Keep extra clips, fully loaded in this bitch
Rollin' in this motherfucker, born hood rich

40 cal nigga and that 2, 2, 3
Lil' hoes in seat, fuckin' with a g
Go two titties, AR front line
51 Maybach homie all the time
Now I'm on the grind five star to them hoes
Know I got this money so I play it how it go 
Off in the shack and we do it like bee's
Whole thing running, bitches keep coming
Fast lane in the hood stuntin' every summer
Made it to the top never see whats the bottom
Know about the bottom, where it rain and it shower
Phantom and a range, tinted with them things
Nigga ain't sharp if he ain't playin' with that change
Birdman daddy and its not to mention,
Family rules nigga so we get it and spend it

[Chorus]

Fact remains nigga, my hood still the same
Got that fire work nigga makin' all the change
Bitches givin' brains, niggas ain't the same,
Got these lil' niggas out ridin' for the flame
Warehouse full nigga, nothin' but some bricks
Got some toilet paper nigga full of that shit
Came back with it, did a few things
Shorty made it home and I bought a new range
Headin' to the jet fuckin' with the homies, 
Went back home nigga, fuckin' with the homies
Gotta field house, back on my shit
Gotta a million dollars nigga born hood rich
Back in my set, in a brand new truck
Rally stripe only play one color
Not even a mention doing out my senses
Leaping for this money nigga, jumping over fences

[Chorus]

Special with the tool nigga, flew to Las Vegas
Known as a whale so you know they cant fade us
G4 nigga the factor of this game
1 flight same night did it for the change
Gave it to lil' homie, he need it for the fame
Got her on the game so he took to the range
Gun pert nigga, 1 work nigga, do somethin get money 
Don;'t hurt nigga
Cash money bet I roll up dice
Stood in the fog if it meant my life
That right quick, hit the store and the bay
Get the purple kush and we burn everyday
Back with the llama get it how I stand
Got to work with me so you know I'm the man
MIA nigga, they goin' hold me down
1 on my crown, I puts it down

[Chorus]
