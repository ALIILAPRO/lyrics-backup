		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Early in the morning, before the sun could rise
Keeping to myself almost felt like a disguise
I couldn't be the one to tell you what was off that day
Opening my mouth is the most dangerous game

Once upon a time, I never knew fear like this
I can't remember how it happened, or why it did
Developing an obsession to open closed doors
Gave me a compulsive need to find out even more

And off we go to play telephone
Sharing what we know
But how long can we keep playing
Until the game
Undermines the status quo

It's all
Propaganda, prop-propaganda
I have a feeling I'm not alone (not alone)
Propaganda, prop-propaganda
Don't believe anything you see, or hear
Propaganda, prop-propaganda
I can't be the only one who knows (the only)
Propaganda, prop-propaganda
Propaganda, prop-propaganda

If we could go back, back then
When it was easier
They say ignorance is bliss

Why did I pick up the phone?
When it was easier
I should've stayed oblivious

Falling down the rabbit hole and running out of time
Hoping no one notices my thoughts are out of line
I know they know we know that something isn't right
After this my life eclipsed, fear day and night

A call to action, call for passion
Call for something more, for war
"If you're not with us, you're against us"
But I don't like the odds, the score
Call me complicit, give me a minute
Let me decide, it's my own life
I'm not about to pretend
These people are close to being my friends

Can I do it? (I can run)
I could do it (I could run)
Should I do it? (I should run)
I should do it (I should run)

And so I ran
As fast as I could
Through the ocean of trees
Through the sting of the breeze

And so I ran
I ran for my life
And I ran for a dream
For whatever that means

Every thought is sabotage
What a fool I am
To keep playing and playing
Game after game
No- losing game after losing game

It's all
Propaganda, prop-propaganda
Propaganda, prop-propaganda

It's all
Propaganda, prop-propaganda
I have a feeling I'm not alone (not alone)
It's propaganda, prop-propaganda
Don't believe anything you see, or hear it's
Propaganda, prop-propaganda
I can't be the only one who knows
Propaganda, prop-propaganda
Propaganda, prop-propaganda

Propaganda, prop-propaganda
Propaganda, prop-propaganda
Propaganda, prop-propaganda
Propaganda, prop-propaganda
