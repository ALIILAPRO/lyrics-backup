		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One more day, one more night
Fade away to your light
In my heart, in my mind
No, I can't say goodbye
Tell me, am I?

Ooh, am I, ooh, am I, ooh, am I over you?
Ooh, am I, ooh, am I, ooh, am I over you?
Ooh, am I, ooh, am I, ooh, am I over you?
Ooh, am I, ooh, am I, am I, am I

Ooh, am I, ooh, am I, ooh, am I over you?
Ooh, am I, ooh, am I, ooh, am I over you?
Ooh, am I, ooh, am I, ooh, am I over you?
Ooh, am I, ooh, am I, am I, am I

You're my flesh, one more chance
Make a wish, make a laugh
Take my soul, take my hand
No, I won't say goodbye
Tell me, am I?

Ooh, am I, ooh, am I, ooh, am I over you?
Ooh, am I, ooh, am I, ooh, am I over you?
Ooh, am I, ooh, am I, ooh, am I over you?
Ooh, am I, ooh, am I, am I, am I over you?

Am I, ooh, am I, ooh, am I over you?
Ooh, am I, ooh, am I, ooh, am I over you?
Ooh, am I, ooh, am I, ooh, am I over you?
Ooh, am I, ooh, am I, am I, am I

Am I over you
Am I over you
Am I over you
Am I, am I
