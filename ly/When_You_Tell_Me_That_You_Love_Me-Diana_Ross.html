		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want to call the stars 
Down from the sky 
I want to live a day 
That never dies 
I want to change the world 
Only for you 
All the impossible 
I want to do 

I want to hold you close 
Under the rain 
I want to kiss your smile 
And feel the pain 
I know what's beautiful 
Looking at you 
In a world of lies 
You are the truth 

And baby 
Everytime you touch me 
I become a hero 
I'll make you safe 
No matter where you are 
And bring you 
Everything you ask for 
Nothing is above me 
I'm shining like a candle in the dark 
When you tell me that you love me 

I want to make you see 
Just what I was 
Show you the loneliness 
And what it does 
You walked into my life 
To stop my tears 
Everything's easy now 
I have you here 

And baby 
Everytime you touch me 
I become a hero 
I'll make you safe 
No matter where you are 
And bring you 
Everything you ask for 
Nothing is above me 
I'm shining like a candle in the dark 
When you tell me that you love me 

In a world without you 
I would always hunger 
All I need is your love to make me stronger 

And baby 
Everytime you touch me 
I become a hero 
I'll make you safe 
No matter where you are 
And bring you 
Everything you ask for 
Nothing is above me 
I'm shining like a candle in the dark 
When you tell me that you love me 

You love me 
When you tell me that you love me
