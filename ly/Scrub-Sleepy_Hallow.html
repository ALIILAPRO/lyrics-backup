		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, uh, uh
She don't want no scrub nigga
(Great John on the beat by the way)

Look, look
She said she don't want no scrub nigga
But since we got a bag, she been tryna fuck with us
She stuck up on the gang like a sticker
She wants a Mr. Fame, we just tryna get richer
She said like, "Ouu, what's up, let me kick it witchu"
Look, I'm with the gang, who you bringin' witchu?
And I ain't tryna know your name, I ain't tryna kiss you
Look, and after this I might just forget you

Look, she like, "When you finna pull up on me to hit it off"
She said she want some Fendi, Chanel, and Louis Vuitton
Her man mad, he said he tryna get it on
I got a choppa on me, don't get hit up for a broad
Her best friend know all the words to my songs
She said she fell in love, said she finna get involved
These bitches pick and choose, and that's why they gettin' tossed
They hate to see me win, they love to see me take a loss
And I know she don't really really fuck with me
She seen a lil' cash, now she's claimin' that she stuck with me
I be in the cut like a buck-fifty
Shorty never held me down so she's never gettin' up with me

Look, look
She said she don't want no scrub nigga
But since we got a bag, she been tryna fuck with us
She stuck up on the gang like a sticker
She wants a Mr. Fame, we just tryna get richer
She said like, "Ouu, what's up, let me kick it witchu"
Look, I'm with the gang, who you bringin' witchu?
And I ain't tryna know your name, I ain't tryna kiss you
Look, and after this I might just forget you

Yeah, yeah, she get lit, and she gon' let me hit
The type to run yo' pockets tryna make you spend a brick
You ever seen the dance she do better on a dick
I pulled up with my mans and she pulled up with her bitch
I know they only want me 'cause they heard I'm gettin' rich
She love to send me pictures of her ass and her tits
My cuzzo said he clipped, said he met her on the strip
So I know she be hoein', I know she gon' do the clique
So fuck it, I ain't lovin', I'ma sit and take a sip
I'm countin' up these hunnids, I ain't worried 'bout a bitch
Look, fuck it, I ain't lovin', I'ma sit and take a sip
I'm countin' up these hunnids, I ain't worried 'bout a bitch

Look, look
She said she don't want no scrub nigga
But since we got a bag, she been tryna fuck with us
She stuck up on the gang like a sticker
She wants a Mr. Fame, we just tryna get richer
She said like, "Ouu, what's up, let me kick it witchu"
Look, I'm with the gang, who you bringin' witchu?
And I ain't tryna know your name, I ain't tryna kiss you
Look, and after this I might just forget you
