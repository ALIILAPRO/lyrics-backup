		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ha

Lost
I am lost again
No
I'm alone again

I keep falling into fear every single time I want to open up my mind
I can't see the purest colour of my soul
They keep saying this but what I want is that
They keep saying no when my body wants to move
I'm stuck in confusion

I keep falling into fear every single time I want to open up my mind
I can't see the purest colour of my soul
They keep saying this but what I want is that
They keep saying no when my body wants to move
I need to clear the mind's eye

Ha

This evolution shaped a war in my imagination
I am being suffocated by the mess that keeps on running in my head
Set me free from the darkness
I will never let you get a piece of my light
I've warned you more than once
Unlock the key and step away from my life

Love love love thank you for the longing
I am still alive
Love love love thank you for the longing
I am still alive

Ha

Ha ha

Set me free from the darkness
