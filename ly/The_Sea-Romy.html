		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I fell in love by the sea
The world was on fire around me
I met the girl of my dreams
But she doesn't believe me

I fell in love by the sea
She had her wings of desire around me
Now I don't know what to believe
'Cause she keeps on testing me

She said, "Don't play that game with my heart
And don't say it's love if it's not"

I fell in love by the sea
Oh, that girl has a power over me
My heart burned a thousand degrees
When she told me she was leaving
(Oh, she ran away)

I left my heart on the beach
No, in love there are no guarantees
So I learned to let it be
But I still hear her in my dreams

She said, "Don't play that game with my heart
And don't say it's love if it's not"
(It's not, it's not, it's not)

And I think of her
And I think of her
And I think of her
And I think of her
And I think of her
And I think of her
And I think of her
Whenever I look at the sea

And I think of her

She said, "Don't play that game with my heart
And don't say it's love if it's not"
(It's not, it's not, it's not)
