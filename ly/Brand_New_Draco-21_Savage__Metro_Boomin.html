		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
(Metro)
We ain't givin' out smoke, we givin' out embalmin' fluid
Spin that shit every day, every night
Back to back to back to back to back
Y'all niggas can't even trap, nothin'
Post up, nothin', kick with the hoes, barbeque, nothin'
We spinnin' back to back
Two weeks, three weeks straight, nigga, on God, nigga
Big 4L, pussy

Rockin' ice like I'm tryna make a knot go down (21, 21)
When the police hit the lights, I do not slow down (on God, on God, on God, straight up)
Brand new Draco ready to crash like when the stocks go down (pyoom)
I'm rich for real, I could press a button and make the opps go down (nah, facts, pussy boy)

Maybach with the shade (straight up)
Brand new CTS all red like the Braves (on God)
Y'all just started slidin', we was slidin' back in the day (21)
21 Gang, woodgrain on the K (21)
Big Slaughter, nigga, big dagger in my face (straight up)
Ski mask, fuck a camera, gun him down on tape (on God)
Breakin' news, FOX 5, pussy, we don't play (straight up)
I call my Hellcat OVO 'cause it keep a Drac' (facts)
Red dot, headshot, pussy DOA (21)
Count me a ten in one minute, count a whole hundred in ten minutes (on God)
Niggas need to call they hood Beyblades, 'cause all we do is spin in it (on God)
I own me a couple establishments, I ain't worried 'bout your business (21)
Y'all runnin' 'round here gossipin', I'm tryna make me some more millions (pussy)
Ridin' with a stick in the hotbox, I ain't never put my phone in it (pussy)
We call your main bitch pussy hood 'cause all we do is Joan in it (pussy)
Money the only paperwork I put my bros in (pussy)
Somebody please unthaw my ears 'cause they frozen

Rockin' ice like I'm tryna make a knot go down (21, 21)
When the police hit the lights, I do not slow down (on God, on God, on God, straight up)
Brand new Draco ready to crash like when the stocks go down (pyoom)
I'm rich for real, I could press a button and make the opps go down (nah, facts, pussy boy)

Charge him with theft by takin' 'cause his drip stolen (pussy)
Trap spot in the neighborhood is 60 Rollin' (pussy)
Had to do CPR, I got your bitch chokin' (pussy)
Sellin' Percocets, weed, bar, and cocaine
So many choppers in the spot, we leave the door open (21)
Put the water in the pot, then you stick the fork in
Put some holes in your shirt, now it's red, soakin' (21)
I ain't runnin' from no smoke, period, semi-colon (21)
You wanna hold somethin', I got plenty shells (21)
I don't even want no smoke, niggas gon' tattletale (on God)
I don't even play with people's kids, go play Battlefield (straight up)
I'm from the East, home of the murders, you niggas'll die out here (21)
They like to box, we like to pop, both of us bodybuild (on God)
You can get hit with one of them guns from my adlib (straight up)
You gon' fuck around and get chopped, lil' Karate Kid (pussy)
I ain't seen him in a minute, but ask if God did (pussy)
Saint Laurent sweater
Rock Balenciaga when I rock the Barett-er (21)
Shout out Robert Kraft, fell in love with the cheddar (on God)
Beat a rapper ass, Def Jam Vendetter (bitch)
When it come to shh, we got plenty
Eatin' Ruth Chris, I done burnt out on the Beni' (21)
And I eat, sleep, shit, fuck with the semi (on God)
Screamin' fuck friends, family first, rockin' Fendi (21)
