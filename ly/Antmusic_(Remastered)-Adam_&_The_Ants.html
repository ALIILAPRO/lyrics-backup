		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I'm standing here looking at you
What do I see?
I'm looking straight through
It's so sad
When you're young
To be told
You're having fun

So unplug the jukebox
And do us all a favor
That music's lost its taste
So try another flavor 
Ant music, ant music
Ant music, ant music

Well, I'm standing here what do I see?
A big nothing
Threatening me
It's so sad
When you're young
To be told
You're having fun

So unplug the jukebox
And do us all a favor
That music's lost its taste
So try another flavor 
Ant music, ant music
Ant music, ant music

So unplug the jukebox
And do us all a favor
That music's lost its taste
So try another flavor 
Ant music, ant music
Ant music, ant music

Don't tread on an ant he's done nothing to you
There might come a day
When he's treading on you
Don't tread on an ant you'll end up black and blue
You cut off his head
Legs come looking for you

So unplug the jukebox
And do us all a favor
That music's lost its taste
So try another flavor 
Ant music, ant music
Ant music, ant music

So unplug the jukebox
And do us all a favor
That music's lost its taste
So try another flavor 
Ant music, ant music
Ant music, ant music
Ant music, ant music
Ant music, ant music
Ant music, ant music
Ant music, ant music
Ant music, ant music
