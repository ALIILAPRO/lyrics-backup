		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh no
I took the wrong way out
Oh no
I should have known that baby
Oh no
I've been driving all night
Oh no
Oh I just miss my fucking snow white

Oh oh oh
No uh eh eh
Girl tonight we gonna let it go
Tonight we gonna take it on the floor uh
Oh oh oh
No uh eh eh
Oh tonight we're going to break the walls
Tonight we're going to say

Baby if you fucking want it
You never fucking own it
Oh I'm not playing any games
Any games tonight
So if you fucking want me
Don't fucking leave me
And let me go alone tonight
Go alone tonight

Baby if you fucking want it
You never fucking own it
Oh I'm not playing any games
Any games tonight
So if you fucking want me
Don't fucking leave me
And let me go alone tonight
Go alone tonight

Uh, uh uh
Uh uh (go alone tonight, go alone tonight)
Uh, uh uh
Uh uh (go alone tonight, go alone tonight)

Oh no
My girl is gone by now
Oh no
I should have known that baby
Come home
Stay for one more night
Don't go
Oh let me see your fucking moonlight

Oh oh oh
No uh eh eh
Girl tonight we gonna let it go
Tonight we gonna take it on the floor uh
Oh oh oh
No uh eh eh
Oh tonight we're going to break the walls
Tonight we're going to say

Baby if you fucking want it
You never fucking own it
Oh I'm not playing any games
Any games tonight
So if you fucking want me
Don't fucking leave me
And let me go alone tonight
Go alone tonight

Baby if you fucking want it
You never fucking own it
Oh I'm not playing any games
Any games tonight
So if you fucking want me
Don't fucking leave me
And let me go alone tonight
Go alone tonight

Uh, uh uh
Uh uh (go alone tonight, go alone tonight)
Uh, uh uh
Uh uh (go alone tonight, go alone tonight)

Uh, uh uh
Uh uh (go alone tonight, go alone tonight)
Uh, uh uh
Uh uh (go alone tonight, go alone tonight)
