		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  White sails and off shore lights
We were passing ships in the night
Now I'm tracing shadows on your back
Like I dreamt so many times

Oh, for so long I've been waiting
For so long, for a love like this
And I was so sure, baby
I'd lost you for a minute but

There's the sweetest
Spring at my door
Can you feel it?
Just the same as before
Many years have gone by
But I knew you'd come

Quietly keeping
This hope in my heart
Prayed the night bring
Back what I lost
Many years have gone by
But I never forgot

I've always been yours
Only yours, mm

There was a time when I let you go
Allowed myself to be swayed and pulled
But for all my days I make a vow
No words could ever shake me now

'Cause for so long I've been waiting
So long, for a love like this
And I was so sure, baby
I'd lost you for a minute but

There's the sweetest
Spring at my door
Can you feel it?
Just the same as before
Many years have gone by
But I knew you'd come

Quietly keeping
This hope in my heart
Prayed the night bring
Back what I lost
Many years have gone by
But I never forgot

I've always been yours
Only yours

Quietly yours
Only yours, mm

I've always been yours
Only yours, yeah

Quietly yours
Only yours, yeah
