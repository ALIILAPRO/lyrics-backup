		<p>
		  Tell these fuck niggas, voot me up, pipe up
Ayy, shouts out Bans and them
Go 'head, O
Yeah
Danny, I see you

Yeah, so long my friend (huh, ayy, yeah, huh)
Yeah, so long my friend (friend)
One life, you can't get it back
You got one life, you can't get it back
Yeah, so long my friend
Ayy, so long, so long
Yeah, so long my friend
Ah, yeah, yeah

Ayy, know a nigga wanna just get back
Brand new chopper got kickback, ayy (phew)
Poppin' these percs, no Tic-Tac (yeah)
Keep a stick in reach, I can't lack
We got one life, tryna make it out
And them young niggas in the drought
I'ma play 'em foul, play 'em foul
Keep my head above water, I don't want to drown
Dead bodies in the lost and found
Young nigga I was goin' wild
Yeah killin', killin' out of envy, for no reason
Killed my brother, hair was blue like he from Four Seasons
When I woke up, got the news, I swear I couldn't believe it
Pushin' up with raw revenge, we don't do no grievance

Yeah, yeah yeah
Got these niggas jealous, know they hate me
Got up off my back, streets made me, yeah
Young nigga tryna feed my baby

Yeah, so long my friend (huh, ayy, yeah, huh)
Yeah, so long my friend (friend)
One life, you can't get it back
You got one life, you can't get it back
Yeah, so long my friend
Ayy, so long, so long
Yeah, so long my friend
Ah, yeah, yeah
