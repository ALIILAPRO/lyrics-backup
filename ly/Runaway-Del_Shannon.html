		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As I walk along, I wonder
A-what went wrong with our love
A love that was so strong

And as I still walk on
I think of the thing's we've done
Together, while our hearts were young

I'm a-walkin' in the rain
Tears are fallin' and I feel a pain
A-wishin' you were here by me
To end this misery

And I wonder, I wo-wo-wo-wo-wonder
Why, why-why-why-why-why
She ran away
And I wonder where she will stay
My little runaway
A run-run-run-run-runaway

I'm a-walkin' in the rain
Tears are fallin' and I feel a pain
A-wishin' you were here by me
To end this misery

And I wonder, I wo-wo-wo-wo-wonder
Why, why-why-why-why-why
She ran away
And I wonder where she will stay
My little runaway
A run-run-run-run-runaway
A run-run-run-run-runaway
A run-run-run-run-runaway
