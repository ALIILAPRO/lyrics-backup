		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's all about confidence, baby
She was a confident lady
And I know she's driving me crazy
And after all this, I know she'd probably hate me

Well, I shouldn't have said this, and I shouldn't have said that
All that I know now

It's all about confidence, baby
She was a confident lady
And I know she's driving me crazy
And after all this, I know she'd probably hate me, oh

Well, I think she knows, well, I think she knows
She's making me nervous, she's making me nervous
I think she knows, well, I think she knows
She's out of my league

'Cause it's all about confidence, baby
She was a confident lady
And I know she's driving me crazy
And after all this, I know she'd probably hate me

Well, I shouldn't have said this, and I shouldn't have said that
All that I know now

It's all about confidence, baby
She was a confident lady
And I know she's driving me crazy
And after all this, I know she'd probably hate me, oh

Well, I think she knows, well, I think she knows
She's making me nervous, she's making me nervous
Well, I think she knows, well, I think she knows
She's out of my league
