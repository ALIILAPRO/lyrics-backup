		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shame on the night
For places I've been
And what I've seen
For giving me the strangest dreams
But you never really know just what they mean
Oh so shame on the night
Oh right

And shame on you
You've stolen the day
Snatched it away
But I saw the sky
An I never want to die
Now you know the reason why
I said, oh shame on the night

You don't care what you've done
So I think I'd better run

Shame on the sun
For the light you sold
I've lost my hold
On the magic flame
And now I know your name
Oh Lord just go the way you came again
Oh shame on the night

You don't care what you've done
So I know I'd better run

Shame on the night
For places I've been
And what I've seen
Forgive me the strangest dreams
You never, never, never, never know just what they mean
And oh shame on the night

You don't care what you've done
Here I go I've got to run
