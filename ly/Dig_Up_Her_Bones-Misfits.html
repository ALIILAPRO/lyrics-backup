		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Anything is what she is
Anywhere is where she's from
Anything is what she'll be
Anything as long as it's mine
And the door, it opens, is the way back in
Or is it the way back out

Anyplace is where she'll be
Anyplace, she'll see you from
Lies and secrets become your world
Any time, anywhere, she takes me away
And death climbs up the steps one by one
To give you the rose
That's been burnt by her son

Point me to the sky above
I can get there on my own
Walk me to the graveyard
Dig up her bones

I have seen the demon's face
I have heard of her death place
I fall down on my knees in praise of the
Horrible things that took her away
And death climbs up the steps one by one
To give you the rose
That's been burnt by her son

Point me to the sky above
I can get there on my own
Walk me to the graveyard
Dig up her bones

Point me to the sky above
I can get there on my own
Walk me to the graveyard
Dig up her bones

Bones
