		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah-yeah, yeah
When the trees start floppin'
And the wind starts calming down

As you walked out, I cried tears, you didn't care
I forgave you, just so you could do it all again
Yes, I love you, I wanna hate you, but I just can't
And I lost you, but you're still here, just with them
Why'd you lie about change?
Why'd you tell me that it's different now? It's the same
I can't believe that I stayed
Now I have to sleep alone again in the bed you made

I watched your house turn to flames
Spark it up and burn it down
Now, how?
After everything we gave
And still somehow, there's no place I'd rather be in (In your love)

Keep it together, we will never change (In my heart)
Lookin' to marry you, might know your name (In your love)
You in the ground, we're one in the same
Might throw the towel, I might end the game (In your love)
I'm lookin' down on my enemies (In my heart)
Look at me now, are you entertained? (In your love)
Why would I take you back now? Don't know what I'd gain
Love or lie

You got me hurtin', I don't deserve this
I gave you everything, it still ain't workin'
Where do I start? Do I begin?
We was so close, like we was twins
Thought that we would never ever end
But I guess this shit was all pretend
Three A.M., yeah, stars in the roof
But you're the only one that's still lightin' me up
Yeah, and I got the world in my hands
And I'm hatin' the fact that I'm losin' your touch
Lose your touch
I might put all of my pain up in this blunt, yeah

I watched your house turn to flames
Spark it up and burn it down
Now, how?
After everything we gave
And still somehow, there's no place I'd rather be in (in your love)

Keep it together, we will never change (In my heart)
Lookin' to marry you, might know your name (In your love)
You in the ground, we're one in the same
Might throw the towel, I might end the game (In your love)
I'm lookin' down on my enemies (In my heart)
Look at me now, are you entertained? (In your love)
Why would I take you back now? Don't know what I'd gain
Love or lie

Yeah-yeah, yeah
When the trees start floppin'
And the wind starts calming down
