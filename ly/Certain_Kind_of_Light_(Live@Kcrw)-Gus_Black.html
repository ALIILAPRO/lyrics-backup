		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tickin' in the moonlight
Tickin' in the joy
Tickin' like a parasite
Waiting to deploy

Okay you know, we can just let it go
If the satellite crashes
You gotta find yourself a home
My bottle full of sunshine
This hollowness is unkind

Don't you ever really see me?
You never really ever see me
You only ever really see me
In a certain kind of light

Tickin' in the moonlight
Tickin' in the joy
Tickin' like a parasite
Waiting to deploy

Okay you know that we can just let it go
And if the satellite crashes
You gotta find yourself a home
'Cause I don't wanna see you cry
Here in this red room

Don't you ever really see me?
You never really ever see me
You only ever really see me
In a certain kind of light

Don't you ever really see me?
You never really ever see me
You only ever really see me
In a certain kind of light

Don't you ever really see me?
You never really ever see me
You only ever really see me
In a certain kind of light
Light, light, light, light
