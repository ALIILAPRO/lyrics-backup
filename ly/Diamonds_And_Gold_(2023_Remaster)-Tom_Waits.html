		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The broken glass
And the rusty nails
Where the violets grow
Say goodbye to the railroad
And the mad dogs of summer
And everything that I know

What some men will do here for diamonds
What some men will do here for gold
Wounded but they just keep on climbin'
Sleep by the side of the road

There's a hole in the ladder
A fence we can climb
Mad as a hatter
You're thin as a dime
Go out to the meadow
The hills are agreen
Sing me a rainbow
Steal me a dream

Small-time Napoleons
Shattered his knees
But he stays in the saddle for Rose
And all his disciples
They shave in the gutter
And gather what's left of his clothers

What some men will do here for diamonds
What some men will do here for gold
Wounded but they just keep on climbin'
They sleep by the side of the road
