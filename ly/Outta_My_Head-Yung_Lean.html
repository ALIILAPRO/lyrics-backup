		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm off an oxy, I need clarity
Fuck, fuck 'em, I don't care
Twenty for a verse, Yung Lean, I'm everywhere (got the best of me)
She push me down the stairs
I'm almost at the edge, I need remedies (so, I don't care)
Big, big deal, son
Sub-zero ice, leave it all behind (left all of my sanity)
Did my time
Clear blue skies, smoke clear blue eyes (all of my vanity)
Fuck 'em, I don't care
Don't wanna be near you or breathe your air (air)
I'll see you there
You got no loyalty, so I leave you there (left all of my sanity)
Right where you stand
Never thought it was part of the plan
Get you out of my head, get you out of my head
Get you out of my head, get you out of my head (my head)

You don't need your friends, you don't need yourself
I don't need no wealth
Wish I had better health, take care of myself
And just stack two L's
Call my girl when I want, might stay in there for a month
Fuck the room, fuck the cost
I can't get you out of my head, get you out of my head
Get you out of my head

Girl, I'll give you anything
Baby, are you sure this is what you want?
Tell you the truth, I don't trust myself

Talking 'bout the real things
My intention wasn't always honest
I don't wanna talk about your feelings
Can we just live in the moment?
(We can talk about it in the morning)
Baby girl, I know you adore me
Feel my body shivering ('vering)
Tell you the truth, I'll give you hell

You don't need your friends, you don't need yourself
I don't need no wealth
Wish I had better health, take care of myself
And just stack two L's
Call my girl when I want, might stay in there for a month
Fuck the room, fuck the cost
I can't get you out of my head, get you out of my head
Get you out of my head (get you out of my head)
Call my girl when I want, might stay in there for a month
Fuck the room, fuck the cost
I can't get you out of my head, get you out of my head
Get you out of my head

Out of my head
Out of my head
Get you out of my head, my head
Out of my head
Out of my head
Get you out of my head, my head
