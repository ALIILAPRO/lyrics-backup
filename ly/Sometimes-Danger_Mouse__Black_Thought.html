		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, sometimes, sometimes, it gets real dangerous y'all
It gets real dangerous, y'all
Havin' one, mm

Prisoners of Azkaban, thinkin' of a master plan
Images of grandeur by Jamel Shabazz, Dapper Dan
Clap your hands whether you in Paterson or Pakistan
Richard Wright, black boy that grew into a blacker man
Early African or European, which was more supreme
The visions vary, this shit get scary, inform your team
My dignitary consigliere is more of a deen
My skin tone is aubergine
I'm a war machine
Sinner who's casted all the stones
He can manage, but with a home team advantage
Most people don't see the damage
Guess I'm gon' need a bandage if we plan to be companions
Some solos from the hammers be mimicking speaking Spanish
They vanish like Atlantis, come to find out they've been banished
(?) for the cameras and abandoning their manners for lies
That intertwine like a violet vine
I threw the rhyme book straight into the fire this time
I'm thinking

Oh sometimes, sometimes, it gets real dangerous y'all
It gets real dangerous, y'all
Havin' one, oh, mm mmm, mmm hmm hmm, mm hmm hmm, mm mm mmm
Mm hmm hmm, mm hmmm, mm hmm hmm, mm hmm hmm, mmm mmm, hmm hmm
