		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come on over, baby, whole lotta shakin' goin' on
Yes I said come on over, baby, baby, you can't go wrong
We ain't fakin' a whole lotta shakin' goin' on

Well, I said come on over, baby, we got chicken in the barn
Come on over, baby, babe, I got the bull by the horns
We ain't fakin', a whole lotta shakin' goin' on

Well, shake, baby, shake
I said shake, baby, shake
I said shake it, baby, shake it
Well shake, baby, shake

Come on over, whole lot of shakin goin' on
Ah let's go

Well, come over, baby, we got chicken in the barn
Whose barn, what barn, my barn
Come on over, baby, better got your bull by the horn
We ain't fakin', whole lot of shakin' goin' on

Easy now
Shake it, oh, shake it, baby
Yeah, you can shake one time for me
Well, I said on come over, baby, whole lot of shakin' goin' on
Now let's get real low one time now

Shake, baby, shake
All you gotta, honey, is kinda stand in one spot
Wiggle around just a little bit
That's what you gotta do, yeah
Ooh, babe, whole lotta shakin' goin' on
Now let's go one time

Shake it, babe, shake it
Shake it, babe, shake
Shake it, babe, come on, babe
Shake it, babe, shake it
Come on over, whole lotta shakin' goin' on
