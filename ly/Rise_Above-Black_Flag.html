		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jealous cowards try to control
Rise above, we're gonna rise above
They distort what we say
Rise above, we're gonna rise above
Try and stop what we do
Rise above, we're gonna rise above
When they can't do it themselves
Rise above, we're gonna rise above

We are tired of your abuse
Try to stop us, it's no use

Society's arms of control
Rise above, we're gonna rise above
Think they're smart, can't think for themselves
Rise above, we're gonna rise above
Laugh at us behind our backs
Rise above, we're gonna rise above
I find satisfaction in what they lack
Rise above, we're gonna rise above

We are tired of your abuse
Try to stop us, but it's no use

We are tired of your abuse
Try to stop us, but it's no use

We're born with a chance
Rise above, we're gonna rise above
I am gonna have my chance 
Rise above, we're gonna rise above
We are born with a chance
Rise above, we're gonna rise above
And I am gonna have my chance 
Rise above, we're gonna rise above

We are tired of your abuse
Try to stop us, it's no use
Rise above
Rise above
Rise above
We're gonna rise above
We're gonna rise above
We're gonna rise above
