		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Many days I've been so numb
Many days I lived in this dump
I just existed in my life
I was lost
Then false promises lost their light
My own words seemed more right
Now I'm alive
Now I'm gonna Rise
Now I'm gonna Fight
Something in my mind (said)
You gonna hear my battle cry
I didn't care about me at all
I didn't look after anyone
I was just wasting all my life
I was lost
I went on drifting through m'days
Want no gold to my name
But that's all gone
Now I'm gonna Rise
Now I'm gonna Fight
Something in my mind (said)
You gonna hear my battle cry
Now I'm gonna try
Now I'm gonna fly
Something in my mind (said)
To break this curse that's called life
Take back what's mine
This is my life
Now I'm gonna Rise
Now I'm gonna Fight
Something in my mind (said)
You gonna hear my battle cry
Now I'm gonna try
Now I'm gonna fly
Something in my mind (said)
To break this curse that's called life
