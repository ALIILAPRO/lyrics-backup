		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All she wanna do is burn with me
Learn with, get turned with me
She's so high,  she want love with me
Fuck with, no trust in me
All she wanna do is burn with me
Learn with, get turned with me
She's so high, she want love with me
Fuck with, no trust in me

Yeah, she just wanna see me burn, burn, burn
When are these bitches gon' learn, learn
Learn?
She won't sell her pussy for a buck, buck
Buck hit with that drum
She always hit's me at the wrong time
I always speak my mind in the night time, oh
Mama can't trust me with my own mind
I'm waitin' for an angel or
The right sign, oh, oh, oh
Fuck that shit
Went to New York and bought her wrist
Your man's a dork and can't do shit
Fixup, my boy, nigga
She pour gasoline on my heart
That shit gon' burn no more
Like i promised you
'cause I'd give you my world

All she wanna do is burn with me
Learn with, get turned with me
She's so high, she want love with me
Fuck with, no trust in me
All she wanna do is burn with me
Learn with, get turned with me
She's so high, she want love with me
Fuck with, no trust in me

All she wanna do is lie
Baby, fuck you and your life
I don't see you tryin', you cryin'
We fightin'
Burn with me, learn with me, it's all I get
Leaving, god, she's in my head
It's all the same ay, I'm the one to blame
Can you feel the shame
When I'm switching lanes
She just wanna drive my car in the night
I just wanna see you in my life
I don't wanna see you in the prices
She ain't like this, she ain't like this

All she wanna do is burn with me
Learn with, get turned with me
She's so high, she want love with me
Fuck with, no trust in me
All she wanna do is burn with me
Learn with, get turned with me
She's so high, she want love with me
Fuck with, no trust in me
