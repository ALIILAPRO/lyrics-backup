		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your blade will go too deep if you keep trying
Our skin will never bleed, 'cause we don't buy it
One shot from your pistol, every word's a dagger
Thought we'd break like crystal, but we're still standing

Hold on, I'm goin' on the wire
Unharmed, we walk through the fire
You know we've all got it within
So you've got nothing on us
Hold on
Hold on

When they try to bring you down
Get up again, get up again
When they try to mess around
Get up again, get up again
'Cause I don't really want anything to happen
I don't really want anything to stay the same

Hold on
Hold on

You twist the tourniquet, the pressure's rising
It's your line, just cut us free, to a new horizon

Hold on, I'm goin' on the wire
Hold on, I'm goin' on the wire
Hold on, I'm goin' on the wire
Unharmed, we walk through the fire
You know we've all got it within
So you've got nothing to know

When they try to bring you down
Get up again, get up again
When they try to mess around
Get up again, get up again
'Cause I don't really want anything to happen
I don't really want anything to stay the same

Runaway, runaway
The only thing you do
Runaway, runaway
The only thing you do
Just hold on
Hold on
Hold on

Run around 10 feet off the ground
I got dark skies rollin' in (rollin' in, rollin' in)
Climb the walls and tear em down
I got tears comin' down my chin
We will run and we will find what it takes to set us free
You know cause I told you so since 1983, yeah

When they try to bring you down
Get up again, get up again
When they try to mess around
Get up again, get up again
When they try to bring you down
Get up again, get up again
When they try to mess around
Get up again, get up again

Runaway, runaway
The only thing you do
Runaway, runaway
The only thing you do
Just hold on

Runaway, runaway
The only thing you do
Runaway, runaway
The only thing you do
Just hold on
