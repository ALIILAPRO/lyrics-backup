		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look out 'cause you know what you're doin'
Turn up the American ruse
Whitehouse, Death in June
Jim Jones paintin' in a blue bedroom
You don't know this, la dee da
You don't own this, how bizarre
Keep your pretty promise to yourself

Do you know this? La dee da
Got me goin', how bizzarre
Keep your pretty promise to yourself
Dear God

Hate
If I want to
Love
Who I like
Hate
If I want to
Hate
Psychic Television and Death in June
Jim Jones paintin' in a blue bedroom
Hate
If I want to
Hate

You can save me, la dee da
Give or take me, how bizarre
Keep your pretty promise to yourself
Keep your pretty promise to yourself
Dear God

Hate
If I want to
Love
Who I like
Hate
If I want to
Hate
Psychic Television and Death in June
Jim Jones paintin' in a blue bedroom

Hate
If I want to
Alright

Hate
If I want to
Love
Who I like
Hate
If I want to
Hate
Psychic Television and Death in June
Jim Jones paintin' in a blue bedroom
Hate
If I want to
Hate
Keep your pretty crosses to yourself
