		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rosetta (who are you talking about?)
Sweet Loretta Fart, she thought she was a cleaner
But she was a frying pan (sweet Rosetta Martin, Rosetta)
The picker, the picker
Picture the fingers burning (ooh)
OK

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back Jojo

Go home

Get back, get back
Back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Back to where you once belonged
Get back Jo

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back Loretta ooh, ooh

Go home

Oh, get back, yeah, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Yeah, get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back, ooh
Thanks, Moe
I'd like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves
And I hope we passed the audition
