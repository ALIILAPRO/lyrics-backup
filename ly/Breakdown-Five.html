		  Breakdown
Are you looking for a breakdown
Shakedown
Maybe a shakedown baby

If you're looking for a breakdown
If you're looking for a shakedown
I can feel it in the air tonight and it feels all right
Didn't see it comin'
And it's something that I can't deny
It takes me high
But I know that I'm not afraid
Not gonna hide away
I feel alive
Tonight, oh yeah yeah

If you're looking for a breakdown
Where the kicks are comin' for free
Where the mood is right
And the beats are tight
You can kick it with me
If you're looking for a shakedown
Where the mix is on the money
You know, I know that you can kick it with me
Everybody howdy howdy, shake your booty, move your body
Everybody make it rowdy that you can kick it with me

Hey girl I can see it to that you're feelin' rude
Are you comin'?
'Cause you know that I aim to please
That's the way it is (yeah)
Swing your fine self around to me
And I'll make you see I feel alive
Tonight, yeah oh yeah yeah

If you're looking for a breakdown
Where the kicks are comin' for free
Where the mood is right
And the beats are tight
You can kick it with me
If you're looking for a shakedown
Where the mix is on the money
You know, I know that you can kick it with me
Everybody howdy howdy, shake your booty, move your body
Everybody make it rowdy that you can kick it with me

Baby, can we, get up, on it?
Better tell me, do you, want it?
Baby, can we, get up, on it?
Better tell me, do you, want it?

If you're looking for a breakdown
Where the kicks are comin' for free
Where the mood is right
And the beats are tight
You can kick it with me
If you're looking for a shakedown
Where the mix is on the money
You know, I know that you can kick it with me
Everybody howdy howdy, shake your booty, move your body
Everybody make it rowdy that you can kick it with me

If you're looking for a breakdown
Where the kicks are comin' for free
Where the mood is right
And the beats are tight
You can kick it with me
If you're looking for a shakedown
Where the mix is on the money
You know, I know that you can kick it with me
Everybody howdy howdy, shake your booty, move your body
Everybody make it rowdy that you can kick it with me
