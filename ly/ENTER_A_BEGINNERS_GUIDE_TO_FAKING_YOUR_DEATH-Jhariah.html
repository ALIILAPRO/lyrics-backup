		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it really a complex or just lacking context
Why would someone go so far to be a walking lie
Yeah that don't sound like me
I don't think I'm that guy
(Enter Beginners Guide)
Please excuse our current appearance
I realize it's quite the mess
And our deepest apologies for all of the noise
We're understaffed and we're over-stressed

That I would lose
(Needed a change of pace)
Oh I would lose
Between my left and right, one day I'd have to choose
(Gone without a chance)
He found the man before him had died

(Yup!)
