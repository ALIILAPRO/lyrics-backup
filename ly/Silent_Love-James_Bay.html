		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've still got your T-shirt at home
From when everybody stayed over
In the summer, now it's cold
And I still wanna let you know
I always found you through the crowd
But I never told you out loud
To everyone else I could speak
But with you, I was tongue-tied

You will always spark the light, spark the light in me
You will always fuck me up the best
You knew my name, all of your friends
Knew what I felt was not pretend
My heart was see-through
I wanted to hold you
But I never told you

(Silent love)
(Silent love)

I guess that you made it, and left town
'Cause I never see you around
Now I'm walking solo, I'm solo
To places we used to go (go)

You will always spark the light, spark the light in me
You will always fuck me up the best
You steal all my nights, all my nights from me 
You knew my name, all of your friends
Knew what I felt was not pretend
My heart was see-through
I wanted to hold you
But I never told you

Silent love
Is a silent love
Silent love
Silent love

You will always spark the light, the light in me
You will always mess me up the best

You will always spark the light, the light in me
You will always fuck me up the best
You steal all my nights, all my nights from me 
You knew my name, all of your friends
Knew what I felt was not pretend
My heart was see-through
I wanted to hold you
But I never told you

Silent love
Is a silent love
Silent love
Is a silent love
Silent love
Is a silent love
