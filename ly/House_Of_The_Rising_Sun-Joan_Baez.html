		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
It has been the ruin of many a poor girl
And me, oh, God, I'm one

If I had listened to what my mother said,
I`d have been at home today,
But I was young and foolish, oh, God
Let a rambler lead me astray

Go tell my baby sisters 
Don't do what I have done
To shun that house in New Orleans
They call the rising sun

And going back to New Orleans
My race is almost run
I'm going back to spend my life
Beneath the rising sun
