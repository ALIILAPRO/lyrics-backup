		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I would rather go to space
Than end up cold in your arms
I could watch you fade away
While I stay comfortably drunk

And I hate to feel it changing
Say I'm wrong
I can see it on your face when
You get home

Love you the same but I'm afraid that you might let me
Rip at the threads we wove together and that scares me
Gave you all my younger days
While the lines grow on your face
You won't go
I hate the thought of us

I've been entranced by other bodies
And the stories before
Cold conversations turn to flames
All tangled up on the floor
But in the dark, I think of us
And I'm haunted by the rush of your love

Love you the same but I'm afraid that you might let me
Rip at the threads we wove together and that scares me
Gave you all my younger days
While the lines grow on your face
You won't go
I hate the thought of us

Talking late at night
Back when you were mine
This love feels hard to trust
I hate the thought of us
Hate the thought of us

Love you the same, but I'm afraid
Love you the same, but I'm afraid
Love you the same
But I'm afraid, you won't go
And I hate the way you do it every time
You twist and pull the threads until I fall in
Yeah, I could feel the change
But you were all I've ever known
You're the only one I want

Love you the same but I'm afraid that you might let me
Rip at the threads we wove together and that scares me
Gave you all my younger days
While the lines grow on your face
You won't go
I hate the thought of us

Love you the same, but I'm afraid
I love you the same, but I'm afraid
Please don't go
