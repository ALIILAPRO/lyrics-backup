		  ROcD BLOCKS
Carolyn Dawn Johnson, Jennifer Lynn Kennard, Oscar Charles

I'm cruising 
ct a real good pace
Everything 
Is falling into place
I got by best friend right beside me 
cnd the sunshine on my face
I'm cruising 
But lets get real
Just a wrecking ball 
On these four wheels
I got a silver lining 
That's made of steel

I got my eye on the prize
Unlimited skies
Oh I'm gonna drive
Right on through
Right on through
Those take me out spikes
Those slow me down signs
Oh I'm gonna drive
Right on through, Right on through
Those Road Blocks

I could back it up
Throw it in reverse
Make a U-turn
cnd hit the dirt
There's lots of ways I could go around
Without a scratch or getting hurt
But back it up 
I don't roll that way
Won't be shut down 
By some barricades
I got a lead foot 
That just can't find the brakes

I got my eye on the prize
Unlimited skies
Oh I'm gonna drive
Right on through
Right on through
Those take me out spikes
Those slow me down signs
Oh I'm gonna drive
Right on through, Right on through
Those Road Blocks

BRIDGE
Somebody wants your green grass
Somebody wants a man like that
Somebody wants you have
Somebody wants to hold you back
Somebody wants your green grass
Somebody wants a man like that
Somebody wants you have
Somebody wants to hold you back

I got my eye on the prize
Unlimited skies
Oh I'm gonna drive
Right on through
Right on through
Those take me out spikes
Those slow me down signs
Oh I'm gonna drive
Right on through, Right on through
Those Road Blocks
Right on through, Right on through
Those Road Blocks
Oh Right on through
Oh oh oh oh yah yah 
Oh oh oh
Oh right on through those Road Blocks
Right on through
Right on through
Those Road Blocks
