		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Weed limousine (Weed limousine)
Got that purple drink (Got that purple drink)
See my diamonds yea they ice cream
(Ice, ice, ice)
On my team you, you gon face the beam
(Beam, beam, beam)
Hold up, hey hold up, hold up

Alexander McQueen, put that on my jeans
(Jeans, jeans, jeans)
Different colored drink, that's in my lean
(Lean, lean, drink)
Perc, lean, weed, Xan, bitch, watchu need
(yeah)

I swear to God I'm so cold
I can't love her body i pour a four 'cause I
Can't really trust nobody
I keep the pack and a beam 'cause yeah
That shit a hobby
Yeah she see the chain and she
Be screaming "ladee dee dadee"
Now they welcome me inside
The motherfucking party
My party, it's in the back of the Benz
On her body
Fucking that bitch 'til she screaming
Out "ladee dee dadee"
Weed, lean, limousine, purple drink
Diamonds ice cream
With my team, face the beam-I get the pack
For free i know they hating on me
'cause I know they jealous of me
I pull up on them in a
Year in a brand new Maserati
My Gucci bag is on
Fleek, three bitches different, this week
I swear to god they can't breathe
All of you pussies is sleep
I get the diamonds in my sleep because
I know that this shit weak
All of you hungry, can't eat, I'm a dog
Take out the leash
All of you broke, you can't feast
I do this shit at the least

Alexander McQueen, put that on my jeans
(Jeans, jeans, jeans)
Different colored drink, that's in my lean
(Lean, lean, drink)
Perc, lean, weed, Xan, bitch, watchu need
(yeah)

Weed limousine (Weed limousine)
Got that purple drink (Got that purple drink)
See my diamonds yea they ice cream
(Ice, ice, ice)
On my team you, you gon face the beam
(Beam, beam, beam)
Hold up, hey hold up, hold up
