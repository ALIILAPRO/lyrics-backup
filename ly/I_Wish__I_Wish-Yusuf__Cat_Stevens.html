		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh yeah,
I wish I knew, I wish I knew 
What makes me, me, and what makes you, you. 
It's just another point of view, (ooh) 
A state of mind I'm going through, (yes) 
So what I see is never true, (ahh)

I wish I could tell, I wish I could tell 
What makes a heaven what makes a hell. 
And do I get to ring my bell, (ooh) 
Or land up in some dusty cell, (no) 
While others reach the big hotel, (yeah) 

I wish I had, I wish I had 
The secret of good, and the secret of bad. 
Why does this question drive me mad? (ahh) 
'Cause I was taught when but a lad, (yeah) 
That bad was good and good was bad, (no)

I wish I knew the mystery of 
That thing called hate, and that thing called love. 
What makes the in-between so rough? (ahh) 
Why is it always push and shove? (ahh)
I guess I just don't know enough, (yeah)

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I wish I knew, I wish I knew,
I wish I knew, I wish I knew

Somebody tell me, somebody tell me
Ohh, ohh
