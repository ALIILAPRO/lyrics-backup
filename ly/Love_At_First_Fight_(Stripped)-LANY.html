		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I met you in a bathroom line
Dive bar on the lower east side
You were looking at me
Like you didn't wanna be just friends

Two months and twenty-four days
Toothbrush on the sink at my place
Just a matter of time
'Til we got into an argument

You never really know someone
'Til you see the other side of them

Under the moonlight, clenching your jaw
And that's when I saw the fire in your eyes
Clothes on the floor, you stormed out the door
And that's when I knew that I can't live without you
It was sparks at first sight
But it was love at first fight 
At first fight

Flying down a flight of stairs
Just hit me how much I care
Even if that train ain't running, I'll be running myself

Two months and twenty-five days
You bet that toothbrush is here to stay
'Cause I've never fought like this
With anyone else

We were under the moonlight, clenching your jaw
And that's when I saw the fire in your eyes
Clothes on the floor, you stormed out the door
And that's when I knew that I can't live without you
It was sparks at first sight
But it was love at first fight 
(At first fight)

You never really know someone
'Til you see the other side of them
And I didn't know you were the one
'Til you and I were almost done

Under the moonlight, clenching your jaw
And that's when I saw the fire in your eyes
Clothes on the floor, you stormed out the door
And that's when I knew that I can't live without you
It was sparks at first sight
But it was love at first fight

(Never really know someone)
('Til you see the other side of them)
(And I didn't know you were the one)
(Under the moonlight)

(Never really know someone)
('Til you see the other side of them)
(And I didn't know you were the one)
(Under the moonlight)
