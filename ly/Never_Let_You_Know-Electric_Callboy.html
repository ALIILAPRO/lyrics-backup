		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I wish I could turn back the time to the day when I gave my heart away,
to the day when you took it and ran away from me. If I could change I would change everything
but I hope one day you'll understand. I always gave my best till the bitter end.

Tell me where your heart is? What does it feel? Live the fading dreams and keep 'em real.
Can you hear me, can you feel me? Please believe me I'm sorry!

But I've never let you know that it changed myself.
But I never meant to hurt you but I need no one else.
Sometimes I wish I could say I feel at home without missing a thing inside my head,
without missing the feeling to sleep in my own bed. The suspense that kills us controls everything.
Even I try to change, even I share the fate in your eyes. Every promise was just a mistake.
Please believe me I'm sorry but I would do it again and again. Please believe me I'm sorry.
Oh, please believe me I'm sorry. Please believe me I'm sorry. Please believe me I'm sorry.
Please believe me I'm sorry but I can't change it anymore - but I can't change it anymore -
but I would do it again.
Please believe me I'm sorry. Please believe me I'm sorry.
But I would do it again.
