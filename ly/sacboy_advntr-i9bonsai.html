		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Crusin' with the windows down)
(My little bonsai planet)

I just walked out, no shit around
No one in sight, not a fuckin' sound
I can't fall now, I can't go down
Yeah, but what is this all about?

Switchin' up, I'm about to do shit my way
Sippin' stuff, you could never ruin my day
Had enough
Lil' bitch you are a fuckin' lame
I can't keep on playin' on
This stupid lil' game

No one around, just me and myself
Don't need nobody, I don't need no help
Don't know what's true
But I know how I felt
Sippin' on juice 'cause it's
Good for my health
Health, health, help, I don't want no help
Oh, oh well why it feels like I'm stuck
In a fuckin' cell?

I just walked out, no shit around
No one in sight, not a fuckin' sound
I can't fall now, I can't go down
Yeah, but what is this all about?
I just walked out, no shit around
No one in sight, not a fuckin' sound
I can't fall now, I can't go down
Yeah, but what is this all about?

Switchin' up, I'm about to do shit my way
Sippin' stuff, you could never ruin my day
Had enough
Lil' bitch you are a fuckin' lame
I can't keep on playin' on
This stupid lil' game
