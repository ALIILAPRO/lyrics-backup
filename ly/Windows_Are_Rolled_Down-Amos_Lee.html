		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look up child
The world is born
Shoe's untied
And your soles are worn

Windows are rolled down
Sun is setting high
Windows are rolled down
I'm fixin' to die

Corn rows have companion feel
This rocky road and this steering wheel
Who do you call to ease your pain
I hope for you to get through this rain

Windows are rolled down
Moon is hanging low
Windows are rolled down

Think it's time for me to go hey

Is it what you dreamed it'd be
Are you locked up in this fantasy
Oh this miles that have
Torn us apart
My new found faith
And my broken heart

Windows are rolled down
Sun is rising high
Windows are rolled down
Feel that wind rushing by, hey

Windows are rolled down
