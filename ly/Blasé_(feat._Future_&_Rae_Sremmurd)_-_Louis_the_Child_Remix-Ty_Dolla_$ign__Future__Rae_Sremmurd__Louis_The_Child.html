		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know what's going on
Over there and over there, okay

Ordered up a hundred Rosés, need a Benz like blasé, blasé
I'm just, whipping Maserati (Skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
Blasé, blasé
Blasé, blasé, blasé, blasé
Ordered up a hundred bottles in the club like blasé, blasé
Whipping Maserati (Skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
Ohh, blasé, blasé, blasé, yeah, yeah

Blasé, blasé, blasé, all I drink is Bombay
When I'm with my niggas, I might drink that Henny
Smoking kush in public, motherfuck the police
I ain't scared to die, on the dead homies
Hittin' them licks, wh-whipping the bricks
Still with the shit, I'm young and I'm rich, young and I'm rich
I got hoes nigga, I got hoes in different area codes
I think I'm Nate Dogg
I started from the ground, I'm that nigga now
I stay with the loud, can you hear me now?
And my bitch cold, she a centerfold
Put her on a stand, and she never told

Ordered up a hundred Rosés, need a Benz like blasé, blasé
I'm just, whipping Maserati (Skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
Blasé, blasé
Blasé, blasé, blasé, blasé
Ordered up a hundred bottles in the club like blasé, blasé
Whipping Maserati (Skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
Ohh, blasé, blasé, blasé, yeah, yeah

I break the bank like an athlete, huh
Shawty krunk drunk, fucking up her new Louboutins
If I let her in my Masi she might be a trending topic
Before she gotta ride it, bust it, pop it, blasé, blasé
Been spent your rent and I'm still blowing big faces
Something 'bout them Ben Franklins make any bitch get naked
Crew got the juice, bitch you don't need no chasers
Ball on these niggas, I need knee replacements

Ordered up a hundred Rosés, need a Benz like blasé, blasé
I'm just, whipping Maserati (Skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
Blasé, blasé
Blasé, blasé, blasé, blasé
Ordered up a hundred bottles in the club like blasé, blasé
Whipping Maserati (Skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
Ohh, blasé, blasé, blasé, yeah, yeah

Sipping out the jug until I feel it in my body
I was, uh, hoping you were salty when you saw me
Keep her rowdy, seen around me, all we do is dip and dab
Got twin turbos on twin turbos and them bitches really smash
It's a 50/50 chance I might, ditch ya (Ditch ya)
It's a 50/50 chance that these niggas didn't pitch in
I'm pouring up 'til I can't no more
I swear everything I see slo mo'

Ordered up a hundred Rosés, need a Benz like blasé, blasé
I'm just, whipping Maserati (Skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
Blasé, blasé
Blasé, blasé, blasé, blasé
Ordered up a hundred bottles in the club like blasé, blasé
Whipping Maserati (Skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
Ohh, blasé, blasé, blasé, yeah, yeah

Alcohol and chronic, yeah, that's all we want
Alcohol and chronic, yeah, that's all we want
Alcohol and chronic, yeah, that's all we want
Alcohol and chronic, yeah, that's all we want
That's all we want
That's all we want
That's all we want
That's all we want
