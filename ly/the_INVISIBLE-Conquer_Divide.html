		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  1AM and I don't know why I'm here
Just a ghost in a hollowed out room full of empty ears
'Cause all your so-called friends are fake
And they don't see me anyway
'Cause your perfect life's a perfect lie and I can't relate

On the outside we march on, in a world we don't belong
All the cuts and breaks, they make us who we are
Have you ever been left out, been faceless in the crowd?
All the beautiful people can't see who you are
We're so invisible, invisible
So invisible, invisible
I can see, I can see, I can see you in the dark

Twenty-three and you don't know who you are
Running around this city lighting fires with an empty heart
You don't remember what you said but I remember how it felt
So when your perfect life comes crashing down, I won't be around

On the outside we march on
In a world we don't belong
All the cuts and breaks, they make us who we are
Have you ever been left out, been faceless in the crowd?
All the beautiful people can't see who you are

Woke up one day, you're on your own
Sweet twist of fate and now you know
What it feels like to be alone
Screaming out, do you see us now?
The invisible

On the outside we march on
In a world we don't belong
All the cuts and breaks, they make us who we are
Have you ever been left out, been faceless in the crowd?
All the beautiful people can't see who you are
We're so invisible, invisible
So invisible, invisible
I can see, I can see, I can see you in the dark

We're so invisible
But I can see you in the dark
