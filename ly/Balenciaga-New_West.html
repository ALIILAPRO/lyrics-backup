		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You deserve roses on your bedside table
In a house by a beach in L.A
I'll leave you love notes on the wooden dashboard
Of a red 1950s cabriolet

Yeah, I know right now I ain't made of money
But everything I make, I'll give to you
I don't need much, just tell me that you love me
And everything I have, I'll give to you

Get you that black velvet Balenciaga
For our weekend in West Hollywood
Spend every August in The Hamptons baby
When we're fifty and still lookin' good

Yeah, I know right now I ain't made of money
But everything I make, I'll give to you
I don't need much, just tell me that you love me
And everything I have, I'll give to you

I know right now I ain't made of money
But everything I make, I'll give to you
I don't need much, just tell me that you love me
And everything I have, I'll give to you

Yeah, I know right now I ain't made of money
But everything I make I'll give to you
No, I don't need much, just tell me that you love me
And everything I have, I'll give to you

No, I don't need much, just tell me that you love me
And everything I have, I'll give to you
