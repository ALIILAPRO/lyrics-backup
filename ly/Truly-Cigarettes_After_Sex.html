		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sitting out smoking in the garden of the apartment
I reached down to grab your hand and kissed it when you weren't looking
Ooh, you're on the sheets like it's a dirty magazine
And I like the way you say exactly what you mean

Truly, know that you really don't need
To be in love to make love to me

Said you wear a new perfume for each city that you visit
So you can always remember how it felt to be there
And your lips are red and all the pictures that you send
Wearing white or black, all leading up to when we met

Truly, know that you really don't need
To be in love to make love to me

Truly, know that you really don't need
To be in love to make love to me
