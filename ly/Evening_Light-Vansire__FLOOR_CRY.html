		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Driving through the outskirts of the town
Furrowed fields and cows
Lawn signs on the ground

I can't tell you where the end begins
But we're as close as we've been
When you smiled and shuffled in

If I could then
I'd go back in time
All your friends and mine
Chasing evening light
'Cause lately I've been
Far more uninclined
To look you in the eye
To tell you we'll be fine

Seasons change the world spins 'round and 'round
Never living in the now
We are lost and never found

I look back and smile at memories
Even though you're here with me
I can't stop myself from mourning

I'd go back in time
All your friends and mine
Chasing evening light
'Cause lately I've been
Far more uninclined
To look you in the eye
To tell you we'll be fine

If I could then
I'd go back in time
All your friends and mine
Chasing evening light
'Cause lately I've been
Far more uninclined
To look you in the eye
To tell you we'll be fine
