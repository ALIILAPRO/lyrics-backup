		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well I won't die for love
But I've got a body here to bury
And if truth be told, it's scary
'Cause my shoulders are heavy already

And yeah, I know
The parts of myself that I've hated
And I can't tell which ones are mine
And which I created

But I won't die for love
But ever since I met you
You could have my heart
And I would break it for you

And I won't die for love
But ever since I met you
You could have my heart
And I would break it for you

Take one in the temple
My tongue is a vessel
I try to be careful with
The thing inside my chest
You shoot for the memory
So you can forget me
I'd leave if you let me, oh

But I won't die for love
But ever since I met you
You could have my heart
And I would break it for you

Please don't leave (I'm running out of time to tell you)
Don't leave me in the shape you left me (I'm running out of things that I regret)
Please don't leave (I'm running of time to tell you)
Don't leave me in the shape you left me (I'm running out of things that I regret)
Please don't leave
Don't leave me in the shape you left me (you took me)
Please don't leave
Just leave me in the place you found me
Safe and soundly

I won't die for love
But ever since I met you
You could have my heart
And I would break it for you

I won't die for love
But ever since I met you
You could have my heart
And I would break it for you
