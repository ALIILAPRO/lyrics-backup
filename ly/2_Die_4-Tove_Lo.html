		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't look like in your photo
You're prettier than that
Now I kinda wish that you said so
Would've put in more effort

Man, I hope you call me, call me
'Cause I know I won't let you down
And I hope you believe, believe
I'll be here for you, here for you

Look alive and come with me, you're to die for every day
Drag you out at midnight to dance in headlights and making out in the rain
Look alive and come with me, you're to die for every day
When I think about you, the world go less blue, let's do it over again
Look alive and come with me, you're to die for every day
Drag you out at midnight to dance in headlights and making out in the rain
Look alive and come with me, you're to die for every day
When I think about you, the world go less blue, let's do it over again

I'll go on all your adventures
If you wanna find yourself
I've been to so many places
But I've never felt better

Man, I hope you call me, call me
'Cause I know I won't let you down
Man, I hope you believe this
I'll be here for you, here for you

Look alive and come with me, you're to die for every day
Drag you out at midnight to dance in headlights and making out in the rain
Look alive and come with me, you're to die for every day
When I think about you, the world go less blue, let's do it over again
Look alive and come with me, you're to die for every day
Drag you out at midnight to dance in headlights and making out in the rain
Look alive and come with me, you're to die for every day
When I think about you, the world go less blue, let's do it over again (it works)

(You're to die for every day)
