		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know we're floating on a planet
Spinning a thousand miles an hour
I can't say i understand it
But whenever you're here
It all slows down

There's so much that i don't know and can't explain
Like why the seasons turn and leaves are bound to change
What's the meaning of existence
It doesn't matter anyway
'Cause you mean everything to me
You mean everything to me

I know the moon affects the ocean
Even the stars die over time
But what's the reason for emotion
And out of seven billion people
Why would you and me collide

There's so much that i don't know and can't explain
Like how we ended up here, in this time and place
What's the meaning of existence
It doesn't matter anyway
'Cause you mean everything to me
You mean everything to me

You're all i need to know
All i need to know
You're all i need to know
All i need to know is

You mean everything to me
You mean everything to me
