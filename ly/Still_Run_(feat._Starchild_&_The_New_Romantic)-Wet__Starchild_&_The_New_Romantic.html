		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna go where the sun is shining and no one knows my name
Tell me, baby, did it leave desire?
Did it feel so cold in the rain?
I don't know how this world works, but I've always felt the same
I wanna go where the sun is shining and no one knows my name

Run away
It's the hardest thing that I've ever done
To love somebody and still run
It's the hardest thing that I've ever done
To love somebody and still run

I'm going, it's no surprise, I'll take a fast street out of L.A
Tell me, baby, did you need somebody?
There was no one left to complain
I don't know what this life holds, but I've always felt the same
I wanna go where the sun is shining and no one knows my name

Run away
It's the hardest thing that I've ever done
To love somebody and still run
It's the hardest thing that I've ever done
To love somebody and still run

But you weren't there for me
And that was all that I ever needed
When I see you, I see you hate me
When I look at you, I still see my family
But you weren't there for me
And that was all that I ever needed
When I see you, I see you hate me
When I look at you, I still see my family

It's the hardest thing that I've ever done
To love somebody and still run
It's the hardest thing that I've ever done
To love somebody and still run
To love somebody and still run
To love somebody
To love somebody
