		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't afford to breathe in this town 
Nowhere to sit without a gun in my hand 
Hook back up to my cathode ray 
I'm better off dead 
I'm better off dead 
I'm better off

Prove yourself 
Prove yourself 
Prove yourself 

I want to breathe, I want to grow 
I'd say I want it but I don't know how 
I work, I bleed, I beg, I pray 

And I'm better off dead 
I'm better off dead 
I'm better off

Prove yourself 
Prove yourself 
Prove yourself 

I'm better off dead 
I'm better off dead 
I'm better off

Prove yourself
Prove yourself 
Prove yourself 
Prove yourself (whoa)
Prove yourself
Prove yourself 
Prove yourself
