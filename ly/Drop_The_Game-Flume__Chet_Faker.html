		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been seeing all, I've been seeing your soul
Give me things that I wanted to know
Tell me thing that you've done
I've been feeling old, I've been feeling cold
You're the heat that I know
Listen, you are my sun

Hush, I said there's more to life than rush
Not gonna leave this place with us
Drop the game, it's not enough
Hush, I said there's more to life than rush
Not gonna leave this place with us
Drop the game, it's not enough

I've been seeing all, I've been seeing your soul
Give me things that I wanted to know
Tell me thing that you've done
I've been feeling old, I've been feeling cold
You're the heat that I know
Listen, you are my sun

I've been seeing all, I've been seeing your soul
Give me things that I wanted to know
Tell me thing that you've done
I've been feeling old, I've been feeling cold
You're the heat that I know
Listen, you are my sun

I've been seeing all, I've been seeing your soul
Give me things that I wanted to know
Tell me thing that you've done
I've been feeling old, I've been feeling cold
You're the heat that I know
Listen, you are my sun (things that you have done)
