		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been walking too long
Don't know where I belong
Been holding my pride
Keep the faith that I'm strong
I'm tired to fight for what's mine
Any longer
I'm much bolder
 
I'm speaking to you
Don't wait
Whatever's for you
Don't wait
Just go and break through
Don't wait
The future's for you
So rise up
 
I'm speaking to you
Don't wait
Whatever's for you
Don't wait
Just go and break through
Don't wait
The future's for you
Rise up
So rise up
