		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thank you for coming home 
Sorry that the chairs are all worn 
I left them here I could have sworn 
These are my salad days 
Slowly being eaten away 
Just another play for today 
Oh, but I'm proud of you, but I'm proud of you 
Nothing left to make me feel small 
Luck has left me standing so tall 
 
Gold (gold) 
Always believe in your soul 
You've got the power to know 
You're indestructible 
Always believe in, 'cause you are 
Gold (gold) 
Glad that you're bound to return 
There's something I could have learned 
You're indestructible (always believe in)
 
After the rush has gone 
I hope you find a little more time 
Remember we were partners in crime 
It's only two years ago
The man with the suit and the face
You knew that he was there on the case
Now he's in love with you, he's in love with you
And love is like a high prison wall
And you could leave me standing so tall 

Gold (gold) 
Always believe in your soul 
You've got the power to know 
You're indestructible 
Always believe in, 'cause you are 
Gold (gold) 
I'm glad that you're bound to return 
Something I could have learned 
You're indestructible (always believe in)

Love is like a high prison wall
And you could leave me standing so tall 

Gold (gold) 
Always believe in your soul 
You've got the power to know 
You're indestructible 
Always believe in, 'cause you are 
Gold (gold) 
I'm glad that you're bound to return 
Something I could have learned 
You're indestructible, always believe in
(Gold)
