		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Work me Lord, work me Lord.
Please don't you leave me,
I feel so useless down here
With no one to love
Though I've looked everywhere
And I can't find me anybody to love,
To feel my care.

So ah work me Lord, whoa use me Lord,
Don't you know how hard it is
Trying to live all alone.
Every day I keep trying to move forward,
But something is driving me, oh, back,
Honey, something's trying to hold on to me,
To my way of life.

So don't you forget me down here, Lord,
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Ah, ah, don't you forget me, Lord.
Well I don't think I'm any very special
Kind of person down here, I know better,
But I don't think you're gonna find anybody,
Not anybody who could say that they tried like I tried,
The worst you can say all about me
Is that I'm never satisfied. Whoa.

Whoa, oh, oh, work me Lord, hmm, use me Lord,
Please, honey, don't you leave me,
I feel so useless down here.
I can't find me anybody to love me
And I've looked around,
I've looked everywhere, everywhere
And I can't find me anyone to love,
To feel my care.

So honey don't you go and leave me, Lord,
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Honey, don't you go off and leave me, Lord.
Can't I show you how hard it is
Trying to live when you're all alone.
Everyday I keep pushing,
Keep trying to move forward
But something is driving me, oh, back,
And something's trying to hold on to me,
To my way of life, why.

Oh please, please, oh don't you go and
Forget me down here, don't forget me, Lord.
I think that maybe you can ease me,
Maybe I can help you, said uh whoa,
Oh please, please, don't you go and leave me Lord,
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, whoa, whoa please,
Hmm please, don't you leave me, Lord.
