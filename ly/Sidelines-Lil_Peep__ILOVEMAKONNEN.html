		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't keep on watching from the sidelines
No more, no more, no more Mr. Nice Guy
Heaven breaks and all my demons awaken
Runnin' out, but I'll never escape this truth
It's you, it's you

And I can't find the time now
To think about loving you
And I don't wanna find out
You're doing things you used to do
Telling me all your lies
Knowing that I'll believe
Saying that I'm the guy
And then you went to deceive me
No, why you can't please me?
Oh

I can't keep on watching from the sidelines
No more, no more, no more Mr. Nice Guy
Heaven breaks and all my demons awaken
Runnin' out, but I'll never escape this truth
It's you, it's you
