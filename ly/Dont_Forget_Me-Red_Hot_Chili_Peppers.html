		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm an ocean in your bedroom
Make you feel warm
Make you want to reassume
Now we know it all for sure

I'm a dancehall, dirty break beat
Make the snow fall up from underneath your feet
Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you want to go

I'm a meth lab, first rehab
Take it all off and step inside the running cab
There's a love that knows the way

I'm the rainbow in your jail cell
All the memories of everything you've ever smelled
Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you want to go

Oh (sideways falling, more will be revealed, my friend)
Don't forget me, I can't hide it (sideways falling)
Come again, get me excited (more will be revealed, my friend)

I'm an inbred and a pothead
Two legs that you spread inside the tool shed
Now we know it all for sure

I could show you to the free field
Overcome and more will always be revealed
Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you want to go

Oh, and (sideways falling, more will be revealed, my friend)
Don't forget me, I can't hide it (sideways falling)
Come again, get me excited (more will be revealed, my friend)

Oh, and (sideways falling, more will be revealed, my friend)
Don't forget me, I can't hide it (sideways falling)
There's a match, now let me light it (more will be revealed, my friend)

I'm the bloodstain on your shirt sleeve
Coming down and more, coming to believe
Now we know it all for sure

Make the hair stand up on your arm
Teach you how to dance inside the funny farm
Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you want to go

I'll be there, tell me when you want to go 
Come again, and tell me when you want to go
More will be revealed my friend
