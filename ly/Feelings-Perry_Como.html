		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feelings, nothin' more than feelings, 
Tryin' to forget my, 
Feelings of love 
 
Teardrops, rollin' down on my face, 
Tryin' to forget my, 
Feelings of love
 
Feelings, for all my life I'll feel it, 
I wish I'd never met you girl, 
You'll never come again
(You'll never come again, never, never! ) 
 
Feelings, oh, oh,, oh feelings, 
Oh feel you, 
Again in my arms( Again, again) 
 
(Feelings, feelings like I've never lost you, 
And feelings like I've never held you again in my arms!) 
 
Feelings, for all my life I'll feel it, 
I wish I'd never met you girl, 
You'll never come again
( You'll never come again, never, never!) 
 
Feelings, oh, oh, oh, feelings, 
Oh, oh, oh, feel you, 
Again in my arms (Again, again!) 
 
Again in my arms!
