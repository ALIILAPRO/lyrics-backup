		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How do I get close to you?
Even if you don't notice as I admire you on the subway
When it's dark outside your house
You won't let anybody out
And keep a padlock on the door, well

One more cocktail
And I'm on your trail

If I should fall
Act as though it never happened
I will retreat
And sit inside so very quietly

How do I grow old with you?
Even if you don't notice as I pass by you on the sidewalk
When it's dark outside your house
You won't let anybody out
You're keeping a dead girl in the closet

One more cocktail
Is it a good time?
Or is it highly inappropriate?

If I should fall
Act as though it never happened
I will retreat
And then go back to university
If I should fall
Act as though it never happened
I will retreat
And sit inside so very quietly

I want wisdom
I want wisdom
I want wisdom

If I should fall
Act as though it never happened
I will retreat
And sit inside so very quietly
If I should fall
Act as though it never happened
I will retreat
And then go back to university
