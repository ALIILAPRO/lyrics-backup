		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No messiahs, there's just us
Among corpses of patriarchs
No more heaven, only this
Lives led with an iron fist
As we live through it
Stealing fire from the kings
We will light the flames

Oh
Strongest of the strong
Curse their world, curse them all
We will rise, they will fall
Oh
Strongest of the strong
Curse their words, curse their lies
We will live
They will die (uah)

There's no history, only now
Among rats, below the vultures
Transformation from within
This death leads to awakening
Stealing fire from the kings
With an iron fist
We will light the flame

Oh
Strongest of the strong
Curse their world, curse them all
We will rise, they will fall
Oh
Strongest of the strong
Curse their words, curse their lies
We will live
They will die (uah)

Strongest of the strong
Strongest of the strong
Strongest of the strong
Strongest of the strong

Oh
Strongest of the strong
Strongest of the strong
Strongest of the strong

Burn the thrones
Strongest of the strong
Curse their words, curse their lies
We will live
They will die
