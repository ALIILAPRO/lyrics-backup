		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's nothing more beautiful than a distant star
Proof of our ignorance
Proof of how small we are

Remember gettin' high on the hood
Of my broke down car
Remember how innocent
We no longer are (we no longer are)

We don't know why we're here
But we're not here for long
We're not here for long
Surrounded by souvenirs
From days that are gone
As we bravely carry on

We like the words love and trust and invincible
But then trust falls apart 
And love turns miserable

And the light disappears
The only thing clear
The only thing clear is

We don't know why we're here
But we're not here for long
Pretend nothings wrong
Surrounded by souvenirs
From days that are gone
But still we carry on

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

We all need a memory we can hold onto
At least a few souvenirs 
To show some proof

We don't know why we're here
But we're not here for long
Pretend nothings wrong
Surrounded by souvenirs
From days that are gone
As we barely carry on
