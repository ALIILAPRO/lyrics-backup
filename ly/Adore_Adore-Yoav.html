		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is the story that time forgot
And though some names have changed
Some names, some names have not
Tune in every night at six o'clock

You can open up a magic box and see me there
Ready or not, here I come
I'm free
Yeah

I got so many names
Let Lucifer Longtail suffice
So many faces
So many devices in the
Sweet smile of the talk-show host
To the suicide celebrity ghost
That's me, yeah
The ace in the hole of America's soul, ah

Adore, adore
Bow down before
Bow down before
Adore, adore
A star is born
You start to fall
Down on your knees
And adore me

And we already know the news is bought and sold
By the man with the plan and the corporate gold
And we already know that the story can change
At the roll of a dice, reality rearranges
That's me, yeah
I'm everywhere you did not think I could be, so

Adore, adore
Bow down before

Bow down before
Adore, adore
A star is born
You start to fall
Down on your knees
And adore me

When I'll be there in the secrets that you dream in
And I'll be there when you wake up in the morning
And I'll be there when you get home in evening
'Till the days of your life is done

This is the song that the caged bird sings
Curled up like a cat at the corner of everything
Don't feel bad even if you could
'Cause if you did not do it
Someone else just would, it's
Easy
Believe Me
I'll show you such wonderful things
I'll show you such wonderful things 'till you're just like me

Adore, adore
Bow down before
Bow down before
Adore, adore
A star is born
You start to fall
Down on your knees
And adore me

Adore, adore
Bow down before
Bow down before
Adore, adore
A star is born
You start to fall
Down on your knees
And adore me
