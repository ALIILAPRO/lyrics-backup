		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once we had it all for the taking
Love was just me and you 
You better think twice 
About the plans that you're making 
Of splitting one word in two 

Put your mind in doubt 
Did you ever think about 
Everything that we're missing 
Don't you make me see 
What is best for me 
'Cause I just won't listen baby 

No no no no 
I don't need nobody 
Anyone to take your place but you 
No no no no 
I just couldn't fall for anyone new 
Nobody but you 

Girl you are the life that I'm living 
I just can't go on without you 
Let's make it alright 
Wake up to what we've been given 
Remember the things we've been through 

Put your mind in doubt 
Did you ever think about 
Everything that we're missing 
Don't you make me see 
What is best for me 
'Cause I just won't listen baby 

No no no no 
I don't need nobody 
Anyone to take your place but you 
No no no no 
I just couldn't fall for anyone new 
Nobody but you 

I can't imagine 
The two of us apart 
Can't find a reason 
'Cause I still believe 
There's no one like you 
That is why I need 
Nobody but 
Don't need nobody 
To take your place but you 
Don't need nobody at all 
No no no no... 

No no no no 
I don't need nobody 
Anyone could take your place but you 
No no no no 
I just couldn't fall for anyone new 
Nobody but you 

No no no no... 
I don't need nobody 
No no no no baby... 
I don't need nobody 
No no no no... 
I just couldn't fall for anyone new 
Nobody but you
