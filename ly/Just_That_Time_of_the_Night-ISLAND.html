		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And when I was a child 
My mother said there were no angels 
And now I'm running wild 
I see their faces in the strangers 
But it's just that time of the night
It's just that time of the night 

Now others pass me by 
I see eyes their eyes faced to the pavement 
I see their trophy lives 
I know my place in this is fading 
Far too long, far too long I thought the world was changing 
Far too long, far too long I spent my young days ageing 

Was I too old
To walk this road?
I won't slow
I'll sell my soul

Cause it's just that time of the night 
It's just that time of the night 
It's just that time of the night 
It's just that time of the night
