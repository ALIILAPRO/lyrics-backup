		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A transformation from good to bad
I thought I knew you it makes me sad
Say what happened along the way
You were bitter but why did I have to pay

I add another scar to my collection
It's been a while since the last time
I chose a path but the wrong direction
I'll turn around and try and try again

Time will heal so they say
But I think of it every day
It belongs to the past now I'm moving on
I'll try to forget I'll try to be strong

I add another scar to my collection
It's been a while since the last time
I chose a path but the wrong direction
I'll turn around and try and try again

Try again Try again Try again Try again

Step by step I break away
Need the time to get on track
My wounds are deep still bleeding
Stitch me up I'm through with it now
I'll start all over again

I add another scar to my collection
It's been a while since the last time
I chose a path but the wrong direction
I'll turn around and try and try again

Try again Try again Try again
