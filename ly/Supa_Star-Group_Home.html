		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Damn, son
The fuck's wrong with you, man? 
Shit be happenin' out here, man 
Niggas don't be realizin' the shit, man 
But, yo man, tell 'em what you be seein' out your window
Yo, I be seein' out my window gunshots everyday
Man, yo, I see sex money and drugs too
But, yo, tell 'em how duke said the world's about to end

Born in the ghetto, it's hard to survive
Some have achieved and many brothers tried
But I realized which life to choose
I wanna make money so I gotta pay dues
But there's no rules and you only have one chance
If ya fuck up kid, you face the circumstance
At night I use to scream and shout
Livin' in the ghetto tryin' to get the hell out
So I would try as I watch my friends die
But all I could do is sit back and cry
These are feelings I'm expressin' through my rhymes
I been through hard times, so many problems on my mind
I wasn't livin' rich and I also wasn't poor
I try to appreciate but I deserve more
Yeah, superman supa star
Give me super fat dough like Pablo Escobar

Supa duper star

Feared by bandits hated by chicks
Loved by kids, I never did a bid
Yes, the Group Home is thick
Plus I don't eat beef 
'Cause these dizzy-ass niggas and chicks think shit is sweet
Yo, I work hard and hard, my man break it down through the guards
After that keep it movin', have no time to be foolin'
Around town A&R's you get down with this hype sound
The things I seen'll make a grown man dream
The street's sayin', "Born by yourself, be by yourself"
Let my lyrics vibrate and shake the earth
I travel ghetto to ghetto, backstreets to street
Kick a rhyme or crime with this ill mastermind
Momdukes use to tell me with these tears in her eyes
Now I'm out on my own survivin' with the time
Like an African tribe, little Dap'll blow your mind
Check it out like this

And then like that
Supa star

"So what the fuck y'all movin' on up"
"Yes, the Group Home is thick, so all y'all punks hear this"
"So what the fuck y'all movin' on up"
"Yes, the Group Home is thick so all y'all punks hear this"
"So what the fuck y'all movin' on up"
"Yes, the Group Home is thick so all y'all punks hear this"
"So what the fuck y'all movin' on up"
"Yo, check it check it out like this, here we go"

Walkin' the tunnels of hell the next level
It's the Nutcracker givin' hell to the devil
Playin' the game the New York pain
Makes me wanna bust but I just maintain
'Cause now-a-days I talk to a brother
Always love your mother 'cause you'll never get another
In the streets bustin' off shots 
Fuck the cops, I got supa star props
Big time dough, money is a thriller
I'm gettin' more iller than the Zodiac killer
No lie but before I say bye
You can't take money wit'cha when you die

Supa duper star

Yo, I got niggas flippin' they wig
Chicks grabbin' their cunts
As the rhymes they get doper and since they greet me with blunts
One time for your mind before I break these streets
Ain't nothin' holdin' me back, hip-hop track
Yo, son, you know the feelin', shit will get revealed
As the times, I get better and you know I got skills 
I seen the days turn into nights as the stars shine bright
Motherfuckers Moet and chicks they keep stretchin'
Like Dom Perignon, one day we'll live large
Word to Allah and it don't seem hard
No more jealousy and envy curses put upon me
Watch me live free as can be
With my niggas you'll see
Risin' to the top like a rocket ship
Yo, I go far

Supa star

"So what the fuck y'all movin' on up"
"Yes, the Group Home is thick, so all y'all punks hear this"
"So what the fuck y'all movin' on up"
"Yes, the Group Home is thick so all y'all punks hear this"
"So what the fuck y'all movin' on up"
"Yes, the Group Home is thick so all y'all punks hear this"
"So what the fuck y'all movin' on up"
"Yo, check it check it out like this, here we go"
