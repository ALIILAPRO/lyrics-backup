Ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy (bitch)
Ayy, ayy

Catch me on the block, block baby, block baby, what?
Catch me on the block, block baby, uh (bitch)
Thirty-two shot, Glock baby, Glock baby, what?
Thirty-two shot, Glock baby, uh (Glock baby)
Catch me on the block, block baby, block baby, what?
Catch me on the block, block baby, uh (bitch)
Thirty-two shot, Glock baby, Glock baby, what?
Thirty-two shot, Glock baby, ayy (Glock baby)

Bad ass kids, we was racin' with the streetlight (What?)
Brand new 'fit, got a Glock with the G Nikes (skrrt)
Fresh white tee with a creased pair of Levis
Real ass Crip, I'll never ever be slime (hell nah)
Fake ass bitch, she'll never ever be mine (never that)
Cut a ho off, we don't love these felines (no cap)
No conversation, he ain't got a stick (what?)
If this get 'scalated, I'ma shoot mine quick (baow)
Big four-five push through a nigga shit (push it back)
Focused on the money, we ain't beefin' 'bout a bitch (hell nah, hell nah)
I'm a block baby with a six (what?)
I'm a cheat code, nigga, I'm a glitch (no cap)
Throw me in the game and I'm bound to get rich
Niggas turned ho, said why them nigga switch? (why?)
So many times a nigga could've been a lick (no cap)
I'ma wet a nigga up, leave his whole body drenched (yeah)

Catch me on the block, block baby, block baby, what?
Catch me on the block, block baby, uh (bitch)
Thirty-two shot, Glock baby, Glock baby, what?
Thirty-two shot, Glock baby, uh (Glock baby)
Catch me on the block, block baby, block baby, what? (Ayy)
Catch me on the block, block baby, uh (bitch)
Thirty-two shot, Glock baby, Glock baby, what? (Brr)
Thirty-two shot, Glock baby (Glock baby, ayy)

Ayy, catch me on the block with some grays, ten tray
And you know a nigga Crip from the M to L.A
Anywhere, any day, we gon' spray choppas
Got my nana lay, we gon' put the nigga in the grave
Fuck what you talkin' 'bout
Walk up to 'em and walk 'em down
Air lift him up, ayy, that's our rival
Hit 'em in their damn mouth
Standin' on the block with the gang in this bitch
Got my flag on the left and I'm letting it hang (letting it hang)
Draco bounce it to the right and to the left
I like the Glizzy better 'cause I got aim
Shit bag 'em up, bullets mark 'em up
He talkin' too much, I left me a stain
We ain't doin' water water, shooters full throttle (no cap)
Bitch, you know we aim at your brain

Catch me on the block, block baby, block baby, what?
Catch me on the block, block baby, uh (bitch)
Thirty-two shot, Glock baby, Glock baby, what?
Thirty-two shot, Glock baby, uh (Glock baby)
Catch me on the block, block baby, block baby, what?
Catch me on the block, block baby, uh (bitch)
Thirty-two shot, Glock baby, Glock baby, what?
Thirty-two shot, Glock baby (Glock baby)

Walk in the party, I just bought a stick (what?)
Got a new Glock to go with my new 'fit (new 'fit)
Niggas keep talking, I'm shooting this shit (baow-baow)
Fuck a post up, my nigga comin' right quick (no cap)
My niggas gon' jam a J special quick (J special)
Nigga keep talking, we come with them Glicks (what?)
Roll, roll, roll, roll down the street (ooh)
Got me a chop and a .223 (ooh)
F&N's coming, they blowin' his feet
No, blowin' his head 'cause I'm aimin' for teeth (no cap)
Nigga, what's up? I'm gon' aim for the cheeks (yeah)
Ooh, big smoke, ayy
Big dope smoke and I got it in the back
Brother told me go get me a rack (go get it)
So I went and got a pack and I made it right back
Had to make this shit double 'cause I got it like that, what?
I got the dope in the kitchen (no cap)
My niggas just wanna get millions, ayy
They see a young nigga gon' make it (no cap)
So they feelin' like they can go get it, ayy
My brother in the ground, nigga, skeleton and bones
And my uncle doing life, he ain't never comin' home (no cap)
This shit really crazy, couldn't feel 'em, gettin' stoned
And these niggas don't know 'cause my mind really gone
