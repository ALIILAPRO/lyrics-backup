		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Does it ever make you think
Every time he texts you
And you feel your heart sink
Maybe you're worth more than that
Baby, I know that's a fact
I'm sick of standing on the sidelines
Watching some other guy come and waste your time
You should be with someone else
Baby, that's where I can help

If I was your man
Trust me
We'd never need company
So, come on, take my hand
Move slow
Let your body let me know

Something in your mind is changing
You're wondering 'bout you and me

Why are you, why are you
Wasting your time (your time)
Why don't you, why don't you
Come waste mine (mine)
I'll set your darkest nights alight
Push the hair out of your eyes
So you can see, you can see
Just what it looks like (looks like)
If I was your man
If I was your man
If I was your man

Does it ever piss you off
Knowing that he takes for granted everything he got
I would keep you satisfied
Waking up the neighbors every night
I wanna be your only one
But until that time comes
I'm just gonna walk you through
All the things I wanna do

If I was your man
(If I was your man)
Trust me
We'd never need company
So come on take my hand
Move slow
Let your body let me know

Something in your mind is changing
You're wondering 'bout you and me

Why are you, why are you
Wasting your time (your time)
Why don't you, why don't you
Come waste mine (mine)
I'll set your darkest nights alight
Push the hair out of your eyes
So you can see, you can see
Just what it looks like (looks like)
If I was your man
If I was your man
If I was your man
If I was your man
If I was your man

If I was your man
I would keep you satisfied
I would always treat you right
If I, if I
(If I was your man)
I hope you understand
I'm spending every day just wishing
Something in your mind is changing
You're wondering 'bout you and me

Why are you, why are you
Wasting your time (your time)
Why don't you, why don't you
Come waste mine (mine)
I'll set your darkest nights alight
Push the hair out of your eyes
So you can see, you can see
Just what it looks like (looks like)
If I was your man
If I was your man
If I was your man
If I was your man
If I was your man (man, man, man)
