		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I'm so fucking happy without you)

Got no more tears left to cry
I watched the films and drunk the wine
Here in the mess you left behind
I been alright, you know
I finally let you go, yeah, yeah
Called up my friends, took their advice
Put on a dress, I'm out tonight
I can't believe I said goodbye
Oh yeah, this time you know
I finally let you go, yeah

I don't know why you thought that I'd be shedding a tear
When I'm chilling at the party and I'm glad you're not here
And I don't know what to say, but the pain disappeared
And I'm sorry

Bet you think I'm a trainwreck, upset
Friday night laying lonely in my bed
Truth is, boy
I'm so fucking happy without you
Bet you thought I'd be crawling to your feet
Tryna write another sad song, but not me
Truth is, boy
I'm so fucking happy without you

So pour yourself another drink
Sit on your couch and overthink
In all your lies and arrogance
I been alright, you know
So glad you let me go, yeah

I don't know why you thought that I'd be shedding a tear
When I'm chilling at the party and I'm glad you're not here
And I don't know what to say, but the pain disappeared
And I'm sorry

Bet you think I'm a trainwreck, upset
Friday night laying lonely in my bed
Truth is, boy
I'm so fucking happy without you
Bet you thought I'd be crawling to your feet
Tryna write another sad song, but not me
Truth is, boy
I'm so fucking happy without you

And now I've finally had enough
I'm gonna put myself in front
And you're not even trying
And now I'm done fighting to stick us back together
And now we're at the final stop
And I'm the one that's getting off
I know you hope I'm crying, but I'm doing just fine

And you thought I'd be a trainwreck, upset
Friday night laying lonely in my bed
Truth is, boy
I'm so fucking happy without you
Bet you thought I'd be crawling to your feet
Tryna write another sad song, but not me
Truth is, boy
I'm so fucking happy without you
