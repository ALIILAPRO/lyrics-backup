		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I didn't want it, it was plain to see
When we talked out plans
Making no money
I could no longer go to say it's fine
And I don't want nothing
I want a life
Trying like a jewel
Just to shine it on
Momma's gonna love it
No matter what
Riding on a silver shadow
To my grave

And it seems like we're just
Turning
Turning just to make it work

Well everybody says the seasons change
And you get hit waiting
For the winter train
Lying in your bed and it begins to rain
Yeah it feels that way
But it's not the same

I know that you're here
And that you want to stay
Wishing all the time
That you could run away
Babe we're only kids
What's one more on the way
Praying every night and day

And it seems like we're just
Turning
Turning just to make it work
All the while we're always
Learning
Learning how to make it work
But it seems like we're just
Turning
Turning till we make it work

And when you live a little
Then you learn to know
It don't always go the way it goes
So I'll take another job
You'll work nights at the bar
We can make it work
I know

Turning just to make it work
