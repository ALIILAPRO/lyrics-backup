		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, just keep it goin', man
You good? (Here we go)
We all gotta come in together like this, here we go

Ayo, rappin' just to rap, what the fuck happened to that?
Mainstream took a hold of my soul, but I made it back
Bringing it back to The Roots on some Datskat
I rhyme for the love of it, this right here is my covenant
Since I was a youngin' eatin' cheese from the government
Come on now, no matter where you at up in the world, we on now
Me and my dogs do it different, yeah, that's on the pound
If you wanna know what we on right now
Listen to the sound, listen to the sound
I said I paid my dues and stayed cool since grade school
Yeah, you know we bringing that heat like AU
Back in the day at Gburg I was wonderin' wha gwan
Tryna make it out, I was a fish in a small pond
My word is bond, we had somethin' going on
I played all the parties and sang the Lodi Dodis
I picked up the mic and serenaded the hotties
I drove the Impalas with cats that's had bodies
I hit the studio, you know I left the track bodied
I do this shit right here for me, myself, and nobody
Me and my family rollin' deep like Gotti
Word to John, oh, ya know it got it goin' on
I'm a silver tongue motherfucka' but it never con
It goes on and on and on and on and on
In the studio 'til like five in the morn'
Rappin' 'til the sun comes up and it's the dawn
While my homies smokin' more grass than acres on my lawn
Put on your good clothes, it's showtime at the Apollo
Shut the fuck up and get to the point like a hollow
I need the microphone like thirsty bitches need to follow
I get the pussy wetter than my mahalo-halo, ho
Oh, yeah, you know I'm goin' beast mode
These other rappers hittin' themselves in vitro
It's no contest
Steppin' to me, it's time to rest
I'm beyond blessed, greatest emcee
Put it to rest, right here
