		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All my life was calling
All my dreams were buried away
You love me but you don't know me
In due time you'll throw it away

I'll be there to play my part
Want to keep us safe from harm
But a love was in my heart
That I feel now

Though it wasn't there
Get it back, get nowhere
Get it right, follow my heart
Back to, back to Oz
Where I was born at the start
Don't be my last call
Do you mind that I'm falling apart?

I can deal with falling
All good reasons carried away
You want me but you can't own me
I survived but I'm still afraid

Tell me this, do you see me cry?
Do you wish I could reply?
Would a kiss make it all right?
What I feel now

Lord, I wasn't there
Send it back to nowhere
Get it right, follow my heart
Back to, back to Oz
Where I was born at the start
Don't be my lost cause
Do you mind that I'm falling apart?

I'll be there to play my part
Want to keep us safe from harm
But a love was in my heart
That I feel now

Though it wasn't there
Get it back, get nowhere
Get it right, follow my heart
Back to, back to Oz
Where I was born at the start
Don't be my last call
Do you mind that I'm falling apart?
