		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been over the edge
Say it again and I'll take you with me
Let you know how it felt
When I scraped my knees going down this mess of sorts
Pacing around, you're making your path on my floor
Wasting every minute you get and you say to me

Maybe we should give it a go
It's hot in hell where I want you baby
I couldn't let you know
I've been scared of the state of things lately
I wanted to say to you
Don't be such a mess, just kill your pain
I wanted to say to you
Heaven, hell, it's all the same

When it's dying down
Yeah, I'll be looking across that table for
Any signs of you
I said it with my chest, my daddy's wrong about you and I
Clipping every corner, never on the other side
Oh why, is getting you off still making me soft?

Maybe we should give it a go
It's hot as hell where I want you baby
I couldn't let you know
I've been scared of the state of things lately
I wanted to say to you
Don't be such a mess, just kill your pain
I wanted to say to you
Heaven, hell, it's all the same

I want to be
Something with wings
Wish I could be
Something's happening to me

I feel so good right now
I feel so good right now
