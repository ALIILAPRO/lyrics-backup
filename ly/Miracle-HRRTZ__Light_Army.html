		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you're gonna save the day
And you're hearin' what I say
I feel your touch, your kiss is not enough
And if you believe in me
Don't think my love's for free
I won't take nothing less than a deeper love

Lemme tell you, you know I
I need a miracle, I need miracle
It's more than physical
What I need to feel from you

Tell me that you understand
And you take me as I am
You'll always be the one to give me everything
Just when I thought no one cared
You're the answer to my prayers
You left my spirits high, come on and rescue me

Lemme tell you, you know I
I need a miracle, I need miracle
It's more than physical
What I need to feel from you
Lemme tell you, you know I
I need a miracle, I need miracle
It's more than physical
What I need to get me through

Miracle, miracle

Lemme tell you, you know I
I need a miracle, I need a miracle
It's more than physical
What I need to feel from you

Ooh, ooh

Lemme tell you, you know I
I need a miracle, I need a miracle
It's more than physical
What I need to feel from you
Lemme tell you, you know I
I need a miracle, I need a miracle
It's more than physical
What I need to get me through
