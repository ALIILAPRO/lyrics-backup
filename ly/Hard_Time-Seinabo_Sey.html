		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hard time forgiving
Even harder forgetting
Before you do something
You might regret friend
Hard time forgiving
Even harder forgetting
Before you do something
You might regret friend

Took me for granted, but
Call it love if you will
I'm aware of this
I did let you in
Sink for you to swim
Dancing on the ledge
Tried to make you stay
I did let you win
Broke to what became
Became you and me
Try to mend it but
I can't bend the truth
Bricks are caving in
Oh how sweet this sin
I left you the keys
You won't let me in

Hard time forgiving
Even harder forgetting
Before you do something
You might regret friend
Hard time forgiving
Even harder forgetting
Before you do something
You might regret friend

Left me on the floor
Now I'm at the shore
Here's change you can keep
Sold yourself too cheap
Thought you got away
This here ends today
You thought hell was hard
Let me show you now

Hard time forgiving
Even harder forgetting
Before you do something
You might regret friend
Hard time forgiving
Even harder forgetting
Before you do something
You might regret friend

You might regret friend

This time I will be
Louder than my words
Walk with lessons that
Oh, that I have learnt
Show the scars I've earned
In the light of day
Shadows will be found
I will hunt them down

Hard time forgiving
Even harder forgetting
Before you do something
You might regret friend
Hard time forgiving
Even harder forgetting
Before you do something
You might regret friend
