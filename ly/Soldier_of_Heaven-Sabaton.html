		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I won't be coming home
I won't be going anywhere
I will guard this post forever
Here on the alpine slope, where I did my final stand, I shall remain
Among the ice and snow that binds me to this mountain

A force of nature too strong, sent from above
Where spirits lead the way, the winds will never fade

White Friday, I'll take the
Stairway to Heaven
I'm sky high, when I die
I'll be immortal
Forever, I never
I won't return to
Blood mountain, I am the
Soldier of Heaven

I saw the end of war
I watched the soldiers come and go
And I kept my watch forever
So many brave men fell in the battles that were raging down below
I have seen it all but none will hear my story
All of these years I have been frozen in time
I cried for spring to come but here, winter remain

White Friday, I'll take the
Stairway to Heaven
I'm sky high, when I die
I'll be immortal
Forever, I never
I won't return to
Blood mountain, I am the
Soldier of Heaven

I always dreamed that I would, serve high above
Where spirits lead the way, the winds will never fade (will never fade)

White Friday, I'll take the
Stairway to Heaven
I'm sky high, when I die
I'll be immortal
Forever, I never
I won't return to
Blood mountain, I am the
Soldier of Heaven

White Friday, I'll take the
Stairway to Heaven
I'm sky high, when I die
I'll be immortal
Forever, I never
I won't return to
Blood mountain, I am the
Soldier of Heaven
