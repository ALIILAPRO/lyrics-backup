		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ain't never been a holy roller
But I found God in your eyes

The greens and browns remind me
Of a mountainside
All the days that are to come
And all the bad things that I've done

I ain't never been a holy roller
But I found God in your eyes

We can stop for gas on our last trip out of town
All these songs about nothing
And straight face bluffing's got me down
'Cause old dogs bark way too loud
And talk shit on the weekend crowd

I ain't never been a holy roller
But I found God in your eyes

Comin' down and comin' up
There's a place for good love on the river's edge, darlin'
And I know home's not far from here
From sundown to sun up
There's a place for good rest in my warm arms, honey
I found God in your eyes, dear

And you're grinning like a vandal
After swiggin' on a handle of Tito's
Lord, I didn't plan this
I'm just going as far as the wind blows
Coastlines to the flatlands
Get your rich hands out of our plans

I ain't never been a holy roller
But I found God in your eyes

Comin' down and comin' up
There's a place for good rest on the river's edge, darlin'
And I know home's not far from here
From sundown to sun up
There's a place for good love in my warm arms, honey
And I found God in your eyes, dear

I ain't never been a holy roller
But I found God in your eyes

The greens and browns remind me
Of a mountainside
All the days that are to come
And all the bad shit that I've done

I ain't never been a holy roller
But I found God in your eyes
