		  Let's get fucked up and di
I'm speaking figuratively, of course
Like the last time that I committed suicide social suicide
Yeah, so I'm already dead on the inside
But I can still pretend with my memories and photographs
I've learned to love the lie

I wanna know what it's like to be awkward and innocent, not belligerent
I wanna know how it feels to be useful and pertinent and have common sense yeah
Let me in, let me in to the club, 'cause I wanna belong
And I need to get strong, and if memory serves
I'm addicted to words and they're useless

(In this department)
Let's get fucked up and die
I'm riding hard on the last legs of every lie
And the BMX bike of my life is about to explode
I'm about to explode
I'm a mess, I'm a wreck
I am perfect, and I have learned to accept all my problems and short comings
Because I am so visceral, yet deeply inept

I want to thank you for being a part of my the forget-me-nots and marigolds
And all the things that don't get old
Is it legal to do this? I surely don't know
It's the only way I have learned to express myself around other peoples' descriptions of life
I'm afraid I'm alone and entirely useless

(In this department)
Let's get fucked up and die
For the last time I'm feeling
We'll try not to smile
As we cover our heads and drink heavily into the nights
That's no shocking and surprise
I believe that I can, overcome this and beat everything in the end
But I choose to abuse for the time being
Maybe I'll win, but for now I've decided to die

Sister soldier
You've been such a positive influence on my mental frame
If I could ever repay you I would
But I'm hard up for cash
And my memory lacks initiative

God damn the liquor stores' closed
We were so close to scoring
It hurts, it destroys til it kills
I am tired and hungry and totally useless
