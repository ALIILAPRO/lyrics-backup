		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You leave in the morning
With everything you own in a little black case
Alone on a platform
The wind and the rain on a sad and lonely face

Mother will never understand why you had to leave
But the answers you seek will never be found at home
'Cause the love that you need will never be found at home

Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away

Pushed around and kicked around, always a lonely boy
You were the one they'd talk about
Around town, as they put you down
As hard as they would try, they'd hurt to make you cry
But you never cried to them, just to your soul

Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
