		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wasn't it? Wasn't it?
Didn't you do it by accident?
I could think a million things
I could think of many things
Wasn't it? Wasn't it?
Didn't do it by accident
I could think a million things
I could think a million things

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna prove I was wrong about you
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna prove I was right about you

Couldn't it wouldn't it
Couldn't it be any different
Failing a careful balance
Falling into distance
Wouldn't it wouldn't it
Wouldn't it be any different
Overwhelmed by static so far past the limit

Someday she'll know she'll know
What peace feels like
She walks alone through warm
And placeless city nights
And everyone who told her otherwise
Doesn't remember she was еven in their lives

I don't wanna do this anymorе
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna prove I was wrong about you
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna prove I was right about you

Was a bit busted
Since I never tried singing it with like
With the key change but yea
Oh it's still recording
