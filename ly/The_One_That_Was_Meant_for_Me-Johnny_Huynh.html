		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't fall in love with someone new.
Still thinking about you.
I'm still hurting from the things you said to me.
You gave it up so easy
And you...

You ruined love for me.
I was looking for the reasons you should stay.
Cause I don't wanna lose the one that was meant for me.

It don't even feel like home when it's just me.
I'm stuck feeling defeated
When I see the sunset falling I wish you were right here,
But I guess you disappeared on me.

You ruined love for me.
I was looking for the reasons you should stay.
Cause I don't wanna lose the one that was meant for me.

And I hope you know I tried my best to keep you in my life.
And I hope you know you ripped my heart out I can't sleep at night.
And you...

You ruined love for me.
I was looking for the reasons you should stay.
Cause I don't wanna lose the one that was meant for me
