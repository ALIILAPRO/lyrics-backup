		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide

No escape from reality

Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy

Easy come, easy go
Little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead.Ã¬
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

Mama, ooh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sent shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

Mama, ooh
Anyway the wind blows
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning
Very, very frightening me

I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

Easy come, easy go, will you let me know?
Bismillah!
Easy come, easy go, will you let me know?
Bismillah!
Easy come, easy go, will you let me know?
Bismillah!

Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby
I Just gotta get out
I just gotta get right outta here

Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me

Anyway the wind blows
