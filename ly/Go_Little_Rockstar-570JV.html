		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything gone
I act a fool when I go and perform
But I'm tryna (go, little rockstar)
What the fuck is he doing?
Act like a groupie around me, he drawn
I told him to (go, little rockstar)
And I need me the dough
If I ain't get paid, I ain't doing the show
Shit, I'm finna (go, little rockstar)
I ain't cuffin' a ho
And that's just some shit you should know
But can (you take your clothes off)

Uh, finna turn up, we finna get litty
Now we global, don't care 'bout the city
He was talking but didn't do no talking 
When we seen him walking, that shit it got sticky
Two bros, two Glocks, that's sixty
And I know they looking, wan, get me
The new whip is fast
You look on the ass, the words gon' spell out hemi
He ran and tripped all over his shoelace
7.62 to his mouth like toothpaste
See niggas stealing the style but you late
See niggas think that they 5, but you ain't
How you a rockstar?
Told 'em 'cause I got back from the cop car
Sipping on Wockhardt
I heard them lil' songs, you not hard
Lying in raps, that shit is not art

Everything gone
I act a fool when I go and perform
But I'm tryna (go, little rockstar)
What the fuck is he doing?
Act like a groupie around me, he drawn
I told him to (go, little rockstar)
And I need me the dough
If I ain't get paid, I ain't doing the show
Shit, I'm finna (go, little rockstar)
I ain't cuffin' a ho
And that's just some shit you should know
But can (you take your clothes off)

Pulled up it was me and my mans
At the club and we ain't even dance
I can't tell you what happened
I don't do no cappin'
We left when we peed on our hands
You get one not three, this ain't Chance
How niggas broke, don't got no plan
And no I don't listen to niggas
I don't wanna kick it with niggas
I'm not no fan
Rappers, actors, this ain't takers
We make niggas meet they makers
My plug he from Indy, we got courtside seats to watch the pacers
They know that I'm different, uh
Niggas is running and still tripping
I'm still in it, uh
And this year we finna kill niggas

But can (you take your clothes off)
