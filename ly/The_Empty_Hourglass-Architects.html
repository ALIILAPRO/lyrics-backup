		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every moment is dead to me

Do you remember?
Because I can't forget
The saddest story, of all that ever was, or will be
Laid out before me
A living heart attack
Play it back, play it back

Take my eyes, I cannot see sense
Past and future tense 
Every moment is dead to me
Safe and sound, anywhere but here
I see it crystal clear, but it means nothing to me
It means nothing to me
It means nothing to me

Have you seen a future, filled with regret?
Breathe and count to ten
Start over again
You want to run away
Just let yourself decay
A living heart attack
Play it back, play it back

The empty hourglass
We're going nowhere fast
There's no more time to kill
If time is standing still

Take my eyes, I cannot see sense
Past and future tense 
Every moment is dead to me
Safe and sound, anywhere but here
I see it crystal clear, but it means nothing to me
It means nothing to me
It means nothing to me

Play it back, play it back
Over and over again
Over and over again

The empty hourglass
We're going nowhere fast
There's no more time to kill
If time is standing still
