		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your soul's decaying
Your life is changing
Your existence defining
I'm lifeless

Nothing to calm the anger
Nothing to calm the pain
Nothing to calm the irritation
That builds up everyday

Look inside my coffin
Tell me what you see
Memories of a person
That used to be happy

Nothing to numb the pressure
Nothing to numb the hate
Nothing to numb the anxiety
That Builds up everyday

Silence fills the empty grave
now that I'm gone, you will see
I am fear, I am sadness
I am a monument, to all your sins

Gradually falling into my grave
Gradually falling Into this pain
Absolved by what I could not become
Lessons learned, bridges burned

Run away
I'm everything you hate
Everything you wish you could escape

I'm fucking dead On the inside

Someone help me
Someone save me
It's inside of me
Crawling back and forth
Tearing me apart

Someone help me
Someone save me

Will I make it

Please forgive me

Someone help me

Someone save me

Will I make it
Please forgive me
Please forgive me

Gradually falling into my grave
Gradually falling into this pain
Absolved by what I could not become
Lessons learned, bridges burned

I am fear, I am sadness
I am everything that lies between
Light and darkness
I am fear, I am sadness

I've been distant, I've been quiet
I've been thinking what this life is
I've been distant, I've been quiet
And I'm Sorry if it shows inside my eyelids
