		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't be compromising in my thoughts no more 
I can't prevent the times my anger fills my heart 
I can't be sympathizing with a new lost cause 
I feel I've lost my patience with the world and all 

And all the politicians and their hollow promises 
And all the lies, deceit and shame that goes with it 
The working man pays everything for their mistakes 
And with his life too if there was to be a war 

So we can only get one chance, can we take it?
And we only get one life, can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have? Don't replace it 
The age of innocence is fading like an old dream 

A life of petty crime gets punished with a holiday 
The victims' mind are scarred for life most everyday 
Assailants know just how much further they can go 
They know the laws are soft, conviction chances low 

So we can only get one chance, can we take it?
And we only get one life, can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have? Don't replace it 
The age of innocence is fading like an old dream 

You can't protect yourselves, even in your own home 
For fear of vigilante cries, the victims wipe their eyes 
So now the criminals, they laugh right in our face 
Judicial system lets them do it, a disgrace 

Despondent public worries, where it all will end?
We can't protect ourselves, our kids from crime, the trend 
We cannot warn each other of evil in our midst 
They have more rights than us, you cannot call that just 

So we can only get one chance, can we take it?
And we only got one life, can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have? Don't replace it 
The age of innocence is fading like an old dream

The age of innocence is fading like an old dream
