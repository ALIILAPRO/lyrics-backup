		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need you boo, I gotta see you boo
And the hearts all over the world tonight
Said the hearts all over the world tonight
I need you boo (oh), I gotta see you boo (yeah)
And the hearts all over the world tonight
Said the hearts all over the world tonight

Hey little mama, ooh, you're a stunner
Hot little figure, yes, you're a winner
And I'm so glad to be yours
You're a class all your own
And, ooh, little cutie, when you talk to me
I swear the whole world stops, you're my sweetheart
And I'm so glad that you're mine
You are one of a kind and

You mean to me what I mean to you
And together, baby there is nothing we won't do
'Cause if I got you, I don't need money, I don't need cars
Girl, you're my all and

Oh, I'm into you
And girl, no one else would do
'Cause with every kiss and every hug
You make me fall in love
And now I know I can't be the only one
I bet it's hearts all over the world tonight
With the love of their life who feels
What I feel when I'm
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you, girl
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you

Oh girl, I don't want nobody else
Without you, there's no one left then
You're like Jordans on Saturday
I gotta have you and I cannot wait now
Hey, little shawty, say you care for me
You know I care for you, you know that I'll be true
You know that I won't lie, you know that I would try
To be your everything, yeah

'Cause if I got you, I don't need money, I don't need cars
Girl, you're my all and

Oh, I'm into you (into you)
And girl, no one else would do
'Cause with every kiss and every hug (hug)
You make me fall in love
And now I know I can't be the only one (I know I can't be the only)
I bet there's hearts all over the world tonight
With the love of their life who feels
What I feel when I'm
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you, oh
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you, yeah

And I will never try to deny that you were my whole life
'Cause if you ever let me go, I would die so I won't front
I don't need another woman, I just need your all or nothing
'Cause if I got that then I'll be straight, baby, you're the best part of my day
I need you, boo
I gotta see you, boo
And there's hearts all over the world tonight (hey, hey)
Said there's hearts all over the world tonight (woo woo, yeah)
They need it, boo (they need it)
They gotta see their boo
Said there's hearts all over the world tonight
Hearts all over the world tonight

Oh-oh, I'm into you (I'm into you, baby)
And girl, no one else would do
'Cause with every kiss (every kiss) and every hug (every hug)
You make me fall in love (you make me)
And now I know I can't be the only one (can't be the only one)
I bet there's hearts all over the world tonight
With the love of their life who feels
What I feel when I'm
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you (with you, oh-whoa, girl)
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you, oh (with you)
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you (with you)
Only with you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Yeah-yeah
