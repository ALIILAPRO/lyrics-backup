		  (Avedon)
Whoa, whoa, whoa (Diego)

White girl lit off the Molly, Charlie
She wanna party with me
Sipping Casamigos and Whitney
Emily tryna get frisky, ya get me?
Take a trip, LSD, did ya miss me?
Backdoor Stephanie tried to trick me
Good thing Tiffany wasn't with me
Going hard, yeah, I got the foreign car drifting

Get up, get up, get up, get up, go (go)
Pull up to the party and do blow (blow)
Wake up inside a place I don't know (know)
I know when I die I'ma be a G.O.a.t. (G.O.a.t.)
Bouncing, bouncing, keep it bouncing
I'm aroused with her, astounding
Bouncing on the ground and couch
We fuckin' right next to the outlet

White girl lit off the Molly, Charlie
She wanna party with me
Sipping Casamigos and Whitney
Emily tryna get frisky, ya get me?
Take a trip, LSD, did ya miss me?
Backdoor Stephanie tried to trick me
Good thing Tiffany wasn't with me
Going hard, yeah, I got the foreign car drifting

Get up, get up, get up, get up, go (go)
Pull up to the party and do blow (blow)
Get up, get up, get up, get up, go (go)
Pull up to the party and do blow (blow)

White girl lit off the Molly, Charlie
She wanna party with me
Sipping Casamigos and Whitney
Emily tryna get frisky, ya get me?
Take a trip, LSD, did ya miss me?
Backdoor Stephanie tried to trick me
Good thing Tiffany wasn't with me
Going hard, yeah, I got the foreign car drifting

Get up, get up (blow, blow)
Pull up, pull up (blow, blow, blow)
Get up, get up (blow, blow)
Pull up, pull up (blow, blow)
Get up, get up (blow, blow)
Pull up, pull up (blow, blow, blow)
Get up, get up (blow, blow)
Pull up, pull up (blow, blow) (pull up)
