		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here's to the nights never ending
Here's to the barely sleeping
Here's to our rule, our rule bending
Church of the secret keeping

I know I got my friends
We go nonstop, times ten
Into the night but I'm an island
Always alone and thinking

Help me, heal me, tell me I'm cured
It's all behind me, yeah
Days like this kinda make you unsure
They always find me, yeah
Maybe I'll just open that door
'Cause I feel safe here
Maybe I can handle one more
I feel so safe here

How do you stop when you've started
Loving a sinking feeling?
Throw me a line you cold-hearted bastard
I'm tired of kneeling

All that I got, my friends
It's got to stop, but when
'Cause it keeps coming around again faster
And faster, oh

Help me, heal me, tell me I'm cured
It's all behind me, yeah
Days like this kinda make you unsure
They always find me, yeah
Maybe I'll just open that door
'Cause I feel safe here
Maybe I can handle one more
I feel so safe here

Oh
Here we go 'round again
Oh
I feel safe here

I've hallelujahed many times when the lights weren't shining
Real talk, I thought I lost my mind, but I'm out here trying
Maybe I'm just functional 'cause, baby, I can go all night
Crazy can be comfortable, but baby, that don't make it right

Help me, heal me, tell me I'm cured
It's all behind me, yeah
Days like this kinda make you unsure
They always find me, yeah
Maybe I'll just open that door
'Cause I feel safe here
Maybe I can handle one more
I feel so safe here

Oh
Here we go 'round again
Oh
I feel safe here
Oh
Here we go 'round again
Oh
Here we go 'round again
