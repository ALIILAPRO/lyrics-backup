		  Great John on the beat, by the way
Ain't taking no days off

Look swear, I used to wait for
Run through them hundreds a day
What we used to pray for
I know they mad that I changed
Ain't whipping the same sauce
I know they mad that I changed
Ain't making the same cause
Ain't taking no days off, look

We would just post on that block every day
Need work? I can get you some yay
My lil' bro be spraying
He aim for your face
Got caught, he ain't tell on the gang
I know it's some things we did that we
Shouldn't have but you wasn't there for us
I feel like nobody care for us
(I feel like nobody care for us)
I feel like doing a check
I want that big bag, none less
Know I let that chopp' blast
Ain't no threat
If he ain't dead, then he gotta be blessed
Money calling, know it's time to collect
You broke boy, you ain't moving correct
Flew to Cali and I met the connect
The threes told me where they get it the best
Rolling deep, I came with the set
The block love me
Said I ain't like the rest
Ain't no problem, we getting them wet
The opps hate me, say I'm leaving a mess
Your lil' bitch know my niggas up next
(My niggas up next)
So she dropping her dress
I hit a lick and they looking impressed
Mr jug and finnesse

Swear, I used to wait for
Run through them hundrds a day
What we used to pray for
I know they mad that I changed
Ain't whipping the same sauce
I know they mad that I changed
Ain't making the same calls
Ain't taking no days off, look
Swear, I used to wait for
Run through them hundreds a day
What we used to pray for
I know they mad that I changed
Ain't whipping the same sauce
I know they mad that I changed
Ain't making the same calls
Ain't taking no days off, look

Bitch, I got them bands on me
Way before Instagram had them grams on me
Shit wasn't playing for me
Might do a bid Sleepy gon'
Hold it down for me gotta, gotta get it
You know us put the ill in the drillin
Play your role, if he switch, we forget him
Don't play with you niggas
This shit ain't no scrimmage
They know we all gas but
It still get you parked
It get lit after dark
The tools on me, bitch
I feel big like I'm up
Ain't no answer, don't start with us
Niggas hating but they copy us
Why they watching us
Tell 'em, tell 'em what you copping for
What you copping for

Swear, I used to wait for
Run through the hundreds a day what
We used to pray for
I know they mad that I changed
Ain't whipping the same sauce
I know they mad that I changed
Ain't making the same calls
Ain't taking no days off, look
Swear, I used to wait for
Run through the hundreds a day what
We used to pray for
I know they mad that I changed
Ain't whipping the same sauce
I know they mad that I changed
Ain't making the same calls
Ain't taking no days off, look
