		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Swallowed shampoo
Probably gonna die 
It smelled like fruit
That was a lie
Called the number on the bottle
Spoke to a guy
He said vomit
I said why
He said Poison
I said goodbye 
I look at my finger 
I look at my life 
It wasn’t that much
I’ll probably be fine
I swallowed shampoo
I’m probably gonna die 
It smelled like fruit 
That was a lie 
I swallowed shampoo
Probably going to die 
It smelled like fruit
That was a lie
I swallowed shampoo
I’m probably gonna die 
It smelled like fruit 
That was a lie 

Here lies the dipshit who drank shampoo
Even though the bottle had a warning not to
I swallowed shampoo
Probably gonna die 
It smelled like fruit
That was a lie
I swallowed shampoo
Probably gonna die
It smelled like fruit 
That was a lie
