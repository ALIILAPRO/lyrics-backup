		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's things that you guess
And things that you know
There's boys you can trust
And girls that you don't
There's little things you hide
And little things that you show
Sometimes you think you're gonna get it
But you don't and that's just the way it goes

I swear I won't tease you
Won't tell you no lies
I don't need no bible
Just look in my eyes
I've waited so long baby
Now that we're friends
Every man's got his patience
And here's where mine ends

I want your sex
I want your love
I want your sex
I want your, sex

It's playing on my mind
It's dancing on my soul
It's taken so much time
So why don't you just let me go
I'd really like to try
Oh I'd really love to know
When you tell me you're gonna regret it
Then I tell you that I love you but you still say no!

I swear I won't tease you
Won't tell you no lies
I don't need no bible
Just look in my eyes
I've waited so long baby
Out in the cold
But I can't take much more girl
I'm losing control

I want your sex
I want your love
I want your sex
I want your, sex, sex

It's natural
It's chemical (let's do it)
It's logical
Habitual (can we do it?)
It's sensual
But most of all
Sex is something that we should do
Sex is something for me and you

Sex is natural, sex is good
Not everybody does it
But everybody should
Sex is natural, sex is fun
Sex is best when it's, one on one
One on one

Sex, I'm not your father
Sex, I'm not your brother
Sex, Talk to your sister
Sex, I am a lover
Sex
Sex
Sex
C-c-c-c-come on

What's your definition of dirty baby
What do you consider pornography
Don't you know I love you till it hurts me baby
Don't you think it's time you had sex with me

What's your definition of dirty baby
What do you call pornography
Don't you know I love you till it hurts me baby
Don't you think it's time you had sex with me

Sex with me
Sex with me
Have sex with me

C-c-c-c-come on

Oh yeah
I want you baby

Oh so much love
That you've never seen
Let's make love
Put your trust in me

Don't you listen to what they told you
Because I love you
Let me hold you
Oh

I'm not your brother
I'm not your father
Oh will you ever change your mind
I'm a gentle lover with a heart of gold
But baby you've been so unkind

Come on
I want your sex
Come on
I want your sex
That's right, all night
Oh I want your sex
I want your, sex

Sexy baby's
Sexy body
Keeps me guessing
With a promise
I know we can come together
But the question is
Will we ever ever?

Sexy baby's
(Sexy baby's)
Sexy body
(Sexy body)
Keeps me guessing
(Keeps me guessing)
With a promise
I know we can come together
But the question is
Will we ever ever?

Together
You and me

I want your love
