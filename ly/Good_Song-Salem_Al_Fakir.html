		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna give you a good song
Something you may need when you feel sad and grey
Sometimes we all need to sing a long
Just let it out push your heartache away
Girl I have seen you've been struggling
Trying to figure out why they left you behind
I know just how miserable you've been
So let me help you find a way to make sweet music again

Sometimes we all have bad days
When everything feels far away
If you'd ever let me I'd do my best to bring you up again

I hope you one day decide if
The important things in life should bring you down
We all feel better without it
So let it out don't you keep it inside

It won't be no surprise
If you suddenly rise again
To be the one you were before
Just let love be your guide my friend
And you will never feel the same again
Just let me tell ya 'cause I know
Sometimes we all have bad days
When everything feels far away
If you'd ever let me I'd do my best to bring you up again

Just let me and I won't ever stop no no

Sometimes we all have bad days
When everything feels far away
If you'd ever let me I'd do my best to bring you up again

Just sing a long now
Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala

Sometimes we all have bad days
When everything feels far away
If you'd ever let me I'd do my best to bring you up again
