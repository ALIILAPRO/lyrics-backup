		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuck

Two things I ain't ever seen
A nigga that beat a gun and a bitch I need
If I go broke, I'm takin' your funds, yeah, bitch, I need it
Gave you the whole book on how to get rich and you ain't even read it
Jennifer's Body, my bitch is a hottie, my bitch is a boy eater
She don't even want no food, this dick the only thing I feed her
This bitch a thot, ain't no way, huh, I'ma keep her
I made a hunnid K in a hunnid ways, 'cause that's what I keep it
Keep it a hunnid

I got diamond, I got money
And my swag cost like a bunch
Flew her out to the Saint, I ain't talkin' Lil' Runt
This ain't no facade baby girl, I don't do no stunts
You know I can't fall, huh, huh, I ain't have nothin'
I ain't got shit lil' bitch, my pockets got lint and dust
Nah, I put that shit on every day, bitch, it's a must
He ain't puttin' shit on, he just wanna dress like us
That's why I'm fuckin' on his ho, I'm makin' her cuss
I'm all in that bitch throat, huh, I'm 'bout to bust
These niggas, huh, gettin' old, these niggas get rusty
I was on the south side of Atlanta with Lil' 88, that my cousin
They ask my why I'm clutchin', 'cause them niggas over there muggin'
Diamonds on my teeth, lil' bitch, I ain't smilin' for nothin'
VVV-VVV's on my body and I know they bustin'
CC, VV, GG on her body, uh, that's my slut
Two things I ain't ever seen, a nigga that won't die and a bitch that I ain't gon' fuck

Two things I ain't ever seen
A nigga that beat a gun and a bitch I need
If I go broke, I'm takin' your funds, yeah, bitch I need it
Gave you the whole book on how to get rich and you wouldn't even read it
Jennifer's Body, my bitch is a hottie, my bitch is a boy eater
She don't even want no food, this dick the only thing I feed her
This bitch a thot, ain't no way, huh, I'ma keep her
I made a hundred K in a hundred ways, 'cause that's what I keep it
Keep it a hunnid
