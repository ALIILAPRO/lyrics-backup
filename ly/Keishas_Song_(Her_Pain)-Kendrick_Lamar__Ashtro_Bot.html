		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fancy girls on Long Beach Blvd
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving a body sore
She take the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles,
Lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
She play Mr. Shakur
That's her favorite rapper bumping "Brenda's Got A Baby"
While a pervert yelling at her and she capture features of a woman
But only 17, the 7 cars start honkin'
She start running like FLo-Jo don't care if they Joe Blow
If they got money to blow a blow job is a sure go
And sure enough don't see a dime of dirty dollars
She give all to her daddy but she don't know her father,
That's ironic see a block away from Lueders park, I seen the El Camino parked
In her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
Rosa Parks never a factor when she making ends meet

Fancy girls on Long Beach Blvd
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals, leaving a body sore
Her anatomy is God's temple, and it's quite simple
Her castle is about to be destroyed, she's always paranoid
Watching the law inside the streets undercover the dummies that look like decoys
Remember the sergeant let her slide,
Said if he seen what's between her thighs he'd compromise,
To no surprise she took the ultimatum around the alleyway and gave him
A warm welcome to fill him right below the navel
Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
His eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em
It was a block away from Lueders Park, I seen a squad car parked
And in her heart, she hate it there but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
Cause Rosa Parks never a factor when she topping off police

Fancy girls on Long Beach Blvd
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals, leaving a body sore
As she bust down like a 12 bunk on tour
She suddenly realized she'll never escape the allure
Of the black man, white man, needed satisfaction, at first
It became a practice, but now she's numb to it
Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinners' redemption
That sounds foolish, and you can blame it on her mother
For letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
Ten months before she was ten he moved in and that's when he touched her
This muthafucka is the fucking reason why Keisha rushing through that
Block away from Lueders park, I seen a El Camino park
And in her heart she hate it there but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
And caught a knife inside the bladder, left her dead, raped in the street Keisha's song

My little sister eleven, I looked her right in the face
The day that I wrote this song, set her down and pressed play

Fancy girls on Long Beach Blvd
Flagging down all of these flashy cars
Fancy girls on Long Beach Blvd oh
Flagging down all of these flashy cars
