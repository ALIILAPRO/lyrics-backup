		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Askin' for space, I give my leg for it
I've reached a point, it's like I beg for it
I give my sweat and tears, damn, I bled for it
No one would bet that you would lose me like that
No one would guess I had the strength to fall back

Now all I want is peace and quiet
For peace of mind, yeah
Need some time, yeah, yeah

While I'm grievin', oh, oh
Grievin' us
I'm still grievin', oh, oh
Grievin' us

The option was to stay and ride
Or to let it die
I picked a side, now I'm just grievin', oh, oh
Grievin' us

You just can't slow it down, drink too much, can't pour it out
It's a merry-go-round from sun-up to sundown
You want me to stay here, mother all your sons now
This shit ain't no fun now, I just think it's funny how
Funny how you made me feel that
Turn around and made me feel bad
Name a bitch patient like that
Name a bitch to cater like that

Now all I want is peace and quiet
For peace of mind, yeah
Need some time, yeah, yeah

While I'm grievin', oh, oh
Grievin' us
I'm still grievin', oh, oh
Grievin' us

Well, I can understand how you
Would be attracted to me
Me, an ashtray for your habits
You, a moon to my sea
Well, me, the juice to your squeeze
And you, a stone I would keep
In the best room of the palace
And pretend it could weep
No one has ever given so many chances as I have (no one has ever)
No one has ever given as many chances as I have

(Well, I'm grievin', oh, oh)
Grievin' us
I'm still grievin', oh, oh
Grievin' us
I'm grievin', oh, oh
(Grievin' us)
I'm still grievin', oh, oh
Grievin' us
