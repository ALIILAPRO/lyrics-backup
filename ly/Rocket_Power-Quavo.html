		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was seventeen kickin' doors bright and early
Daddy had to take me to my favorite Aunty Charel (auntie)
I told my mama that she never had to worry (mama)
Three Migos Stooges, it was Larrry, Moe and Curly (three)
Trappin' out the bando, it was vacant to me (bando)
Mama only raised me and she raised me a beast (beast)
And, I ain't got to prove nothin' to nobody but the streets (no)

Thinkin' 'bout my nephew while I'm rollin' some trees (oh)
Mama said she cryin' and she cryin' in her sleep (mama)
And she don't know nobody to call on but tree (tree)
Yeah, that's mama rocket, and she strong as can be (strong)
Lookin' at my family, we tryna get through grief (Grief)
Scrapin' all these millions up, I gotta make a B (b)
Ain't no one to call, I got a text from JAY-Z (HOV)
I guess B's gettin' closer to me (yeah)
I won't ring me a woman 'til I make my ends meet
Cuttin' my phone, don't call in weeks, I put it on DND (no)
Back then at five thirty, we had all we can eat (five thirty)
Mama not cookin' the food for me, she cookin' it up for the three (mama)

I was seventeen kickin' doors bright and early
Daddy had to take me to my favorite Aunty Charel (auntie)
I told my mama that she never had to worry (mama)
Three Migos Stooges, it was Larry, Moe and Curly (three)
Trappin' out the bando, it was vacant to me (bando)
Mama only raised me, and she raised me a beast (beast)
And I ain't got to prove nothin' to nobody but the streets (no)
Nobody but the streets

Mama, I can't sleep
I lost my bro, aw, this just a dream
Eternal nightmares
I don't know 'bout how we got here
I wanna go far, but I don't know where
But when I go, I ain't got no fear
I bet my nephew gon' be right there
I see my niece and nephew cry tears
I told 'em, "Wipe your eyes 'cause unc' here"
I told 'em, "Wipe your eyes 'cause unc' here"
I give it all, I try my best
The backend all come to one nest
I had my heart ripped out my chest
I had my heart ripped out my chest
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, I had my heart ripped out my chest

Anybody feel like I feel?
Pray He bless you, and God will
Never knowin' it's your last meal
Don't go switch up, just remain real
Anybody feel like I feel? (Oh)
Pray He bless you, and God will (oh)
Never knowin' it's your last meal
Don't go switch up, just remain real
