		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You're my, you're my)
Angel
You're my angel
You're my, you're my angel
You're my angel (uh)

Uh, yeah, uh
Back with another one
Trust, went missing in the summer sun
And Ben and 'em can't figure if the summer's done
Pour another glass, knock it back, sip another rum
And one two checking as the colour's spun (uh)
Cassette, fling it on the decks, fuck a number one
I'm tryna keep all the respect 'fore my number comes
But never coming for your neck if I'm under thumb
'Cause I can run, run away, when it's all finished
Diminished, just business, we pour Guinness
Trust, I got nothing if it's all in this
But if I keep all the trouble that I brought with this
It's finished, yo, this is how the game goes
Dodging plain clothes villains chasing rainbows
Suppose, if it was anything but main rows
Talking ten toes, 'nother case closed

Uh, trust
'Cause listen, this is where you'll find me
Sippin' on a chai tea, talking all politely
And rightly so, they're telling me they might be
Looking for the trouble, nah, never be but mine g
I keep it low key like a baritone
Trust, far from sopranos who haven't grown
'Cause everybody talks tough in the battle zone
Three kids hit by a train with a bag of chrome
So if I stand alone, reminisce I used to run
A couple guys talked tough, never shoot a gun
I know they used to burn flame when they used the sun
I never really did label me unusual
One, it's dumb, 'cause I was tryna' change position
Pop's missing, tryna' stop this opposition
The blocks hissin', big blocks that dogs piss in
Yo, I wanted them gone, I stopped livin'
Trust, uh, I stopped livin', long
I wanted them gone, I stopped livin'
Trust, I stopped livin, trust
I wanted them gone

That's why you're my angel (you're my angel)
You're my angel (you're my angel)
You're my, you're my angel (you're my angel, you're my angel)
You're my angel (you're my angel)

Uh, uh
'Cause down there, I can see 'em
You think your enemies are nothing 'til you bleed 'em
Yo, 'cause all I really wanted was my freedom
Disappear and then I'm realizing that I need 'em
Trust, so I could sit up in the park with the setting sun
And let my missus tell me, "Baby, you're the better one"
Uh, feelin', feelin' better than I ever done
Still I know I need this fuckin' drama when it's said and done
Uh, 'cause where I'm from
Hidden in the big deep south
Opening my big deep mouth
Yo, a lot of people tryna' keep these out
But these days, I hate to say I dig deep now
Trust, 'cause honestly I need 'em
Yo, I hate 'em but I grieve 'em
Think I've finally found a reason
Trust, to light the light the fire needs the air
I won't burn unless you're there
Check it like, uh
Like the fire needs the air
I won't burn unless you're there
Check it like, uh
Like the fire needs the air
I won't burn unless you're there

(You're my, you're my angel)
(You're my angel)

It's been a while since summer
Finally found some time to be alone
I'll try and lower my tone
Never last long for me
Sitting on the train from Willesden Green
Places I've never been
And as the seasons come and grow
So do all the things I used to know
The way my heart will flow
And though we might not meet again
I want you to listen 'til the end
Over and over again

And that's why you're my angel (you're my angel)
You're my angel (you're my angel)
You're my, you're my angel (you're my angel, you're my angel)
You're my angel (you're my angel)
That's why you're my angel

Yeah, yeah, probably still
(I'll try and lower my tone, try and lower my tone)
(Never last long for me)
Whoa, sing it, tom (sitting on the train from Willesden Green)
Where the ladies at? Where they at?
Where are they at?
