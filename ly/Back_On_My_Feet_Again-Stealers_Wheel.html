		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I used to sit the whole night just like a stone
I could not move anywhere
Everyone was talking, everyone but me
I didn't know why I was there

Now I'm just glad to see the end...
I'm back on my feet again, though it took so long
I'm back on my feet again, and I'm moving on
I've been through the hard times, but now I'm winning the fight
I'm back on my feet again, and it's all right

Well, I tried so hard to listen, still I could not hear
I just had to hide myself away
Everyone was talking, everyone but me
I didn't know what I was supposed to say

Now I'm just glad to see the end...
I'm back on my feet again, though it took so long
I'm back on my feet again, and I'm moving on
I've been through the hard times, but now I'm winning the fight
I'm back on my feet again, and it's all right
