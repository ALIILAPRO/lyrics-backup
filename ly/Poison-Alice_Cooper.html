		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your cruel device
Your blood, like ice
One look, could kill
My pain, your thrill

I wanna love you but I better not touch (don't touch)
I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you but I want it too much (too much)
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison, running through my veins
You're poison
I don't want to break these chains

Your mouth, so hot
Your web, I'm caught
Your skin, so wet
Black lace, on sweat

I hear you calling and it's needles and pins (and pins)
I wanna hurt you just to hear you screaming my name
Don't want to touch you but you're under my skin (deep in)
I wanna kiss you but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison, running through my veins
You're poison
I don't want to break these chains
Poison

One look, could kill
My pain, your thrill

I wanna love you but I better not touch (don't touch)
I wanna to hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna to kiss you but I want it too much (too much)
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison, running through my veins
You're poison
I don't want to break these chains
Poison (poison)

I wanna love you but I better not touch (don't touch)
I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you but I want it too much (too much)
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison
Yeah, well I don't want to break these chains
Poison (poison)
Runnin' deep inside my veins
Burnin' deep inside my brain (poison)
Poisoning (poison)
I don't want to break these chains (poison)
Poison 
(Poison) I don't want to break these chains (poison)
