Are you stuck in yesterday?

Used to be the main one
'til they turned me to a sidekick
Can you really tell the future or
Were you just lying again?
It's been years since I first talked to you
So are we still friends?
You were acting like I couldn't use
My eyes through the lens
Wer W W Were you sabotaging all my plans?
IIII've been walking hours in the sand
I've been way too long without a stance
I can't tell the clones apart from fans
And it's fuck you today, and
If I wake up tomorrow
Then that means that I'm okay
I don't even feel betrayed
Can you tell that I'm insane?
If I'm walking through the sidelines
Then you better leave my way

I watched the rain fall through my window
I-it was better than before
I fell out with all my day ones
Now they never take my word
It's a double sided sword
Did you get what you wanted?
I forgot what I wanted
But I got it on torrent

Just like fuck it, I can't see it
Not the first time that I lead it
If I don't get my props, I'm gonna leave it
Hate it, and I hate you, I don't need it
Stop it, I don't wanna have to go repeat it
Do it all the time, but I don't even want it
Did you like me better when I wasn't myself?
You want me to fix
Something that isn't broken
When I think about it, I get so overwhelmed

Sometimes, I can tell the breaker
That I crossed the line
If you don't forgive me, gotta say it's fine
I can go another day without my shine
It's alright i can feel it through my spine
I thought of another option
How about we just be honest?

I can't tell the situation that
I got through my head
When I left my shit behind and
Then you found out I'm dead
I don't wanna be your friend
But you can always pretend
I'll remember all the visit's
That you couldn't attend
Get that shit through your head
I I I do not wanna talk
And you say that that's okay
When you were never involved
They gon' bring up all that shit
That I don't do anymore
If you never wanna talk
Then that means that you got bored


For someone that moves in silence
I'ma say you talk a lot
How does it feel? You got zeros in your squad
That shit's not real
I still took it to my heart
I was picking out the flowers
Do they love me, do they not?
IIII'm the starter, I'm default
And if I hate you, it's my fault
Because I'm always wrong
That means you're always right
And nothing that I do will
Be enough to apologize
You're looking through my eyes
You're looking at my soul
I came this far without one
Night up in a studio
You're looking at my face
I'm looking at it back you think of death
And that's enough to give you heart attacks
But I saw death up close
And all the fiction makes you think
That there would be a ghost
Would you still die for those
That wouldn't die for you?
And if this life is just a game
I'm not afraid to lose
