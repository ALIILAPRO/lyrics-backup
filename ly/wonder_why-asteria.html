		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You should know it don't take much for me to die inside
Take another loss, man, why should I try
Think I need some more, but I should push it to the side
Cut 'em all off, how you see me and still wondering why
Don't tell me to tone it down, I do this shit all the time
You know I don't fuck around, how I been locked in all night
Bitches see me, wanna be me, wish they saw from my side
I might cut 'em all off, leave 'em wondering why
(You won't choose me)
(Why not me)
Oh my God
I've been walking round with none to hold it off
Don't see how she saw myself as bad and had to cut me off
Lately taking everything I can so I can fuck me up
They want me to go on, I can't
But I can't fucking stop I'll
Break up, break out
Break up, break out
Stay up, stay out
Stay up, stay out
Break up, break out
Break up, break out
Stay up, stay out
Stay up, stay
You should know it don't take much for me to die inside
Take another loss, man, why should I try
Think I need some more, but I should push it to the side
Cut 'em all off, how you see me and still wondering why
Don't tell me to tone it down, I do this shit all the time
You know I don't fuck around, how I been locked in all night
Bitches see me, wanna be me, wish they saw from my side
I might cut 'em all off, leave 'em wondering why
(Wonder why, I wonder why)
(Wonder why, I wonder why)
(Wonder why, I wonder why)
(Wonder why, I wonder why)
(Wonder why, I wonder why)
(Wonder why, I wonder why)
(Wonder why, I wonder why)
(Wonder why, I wonder why)
