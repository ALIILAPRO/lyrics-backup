		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say that we can reconcile this
Put it in the past
They say that we can reconcile this
What if I can't?

It's in our blood
It's in our blood, oh, oh-oh
It's in our blood

Why does it feel like we're on the edge?
Staring down at certain death
Why does it feel like the story ends
Before it starts?

We were here in these fading memories
Oh, we were here in these fleeting stories
Oh, we were here in these disappearing words
Even when they stop losing meaning

It's in my blood
It's in our blood, oh, oh-oh
It's in my blood
It's in my blood

We come, we go, just like the days
There's light then dark, then the morning rays
I guess I know just like the snow
We fall, we melt, we fade away
A month, a day, a week, a year
Just like to say that we were here

We were here (we were here)
In these fading memories
Oh, we were here (we were here, we were here)
In these fleeting stories
Oh, we were here (we were here)
In these disappearing words
Even when they stop (even when they stop) losing meaning

It's in our blood (it's in my blood, it's my blood)
It's in our blood, oh, oh-oh (oh, yeah)
It's in my blood (it's in my blood, it's my blood)
It's in our blood (it's in my blood)

Whoa
(Our blood, oh, oh)
(In our blood)
Oh
