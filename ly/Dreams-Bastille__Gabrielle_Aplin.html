		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now there you go again
You say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It’s only right that you should play
It the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the
Sound of your loneliness

Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering
What you had and what you lost
Of what you had and what you lost

Thunder only happens when it’s raining
Players only love you when they’re playing
Women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know you'll know

Now here I go again, I see the crystal vision
I keep my visions to myself
It’s only me who wants to
Wrap around your dreams
Have you any dreams you’d like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness

Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering
What you had and what you lost
Of what you had and what you lost

Thunder only happens when it’s raining
Players only love you when they’re playing
Women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know

All we had and all we lost
All we had and all we lost

Thunder only happens when it’s raining
Players only love you when they’re playing
Women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know

All we had and all we lost you'll know
All we had and all we lost you'll know
All we had and all we lost you'll know
All we had and all we lost
