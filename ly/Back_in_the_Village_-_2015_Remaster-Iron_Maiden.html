		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Turn the spotlights on the people
Switch the dial and eat the worm
Take your chances, kill the engine
Drop your bombs and let it burn

White flags shot to ribbons
The truce in black and ubrned
Shellshock in the kitchen
Tables overturned

Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again

Throwing dice now, rolling loaded
I see sixes all the way
In a black hole and I'm spinning
As my wings get shot away

Questions are a burden
And answers' a prison for oneself
Shellshock in the kitchen
Tables start to burn

Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again

No breaks on the inside
Paper cats and burning barns
There's a fox among the chickens
And a killer in the hounds

Questions are a burden
And answers' a prison for oneself
Shellshock in the kitchen
Tables start to burn

Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again

But still we walk into the valley
And others try to kill the inner flame
We're burning brighter than before
I don't have a number, I'm a name

Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again, yeah
Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again

Back in the village
And I'm back in the village
And I'm back in the village again
