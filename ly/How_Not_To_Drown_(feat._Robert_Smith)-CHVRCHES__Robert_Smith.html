		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm writing a book on how to stay conscious when you drown
And if the words float up to the surface
I'll keep them down
This is the first time, I know
I don't want the crown
You can take it now
You promised the world and brought me it hanging from a string
Stuck it in my mouth, into my throat
Told me to sing
That was the first time I knew
You can't kill the king
And those who kiss the ring

Tell me how
It's better when the sun goes down
We'll never escape this town
I wasn't scared when he caught me
Look what it taught me
Tell me how
It's better if I make no sound
I will never escape these doubts
I wasn't dead when they found me
Watch as they pull me down

I'm writing a chapter on what to do after they dig you up
On what to do after you grew to hate what you used to love
That was the first time I knew
They were out for blood
And they would have your guts

Tell me how
It's better when the sun goes down
We'll never escape this town
I wasn't scared when he caught me
Look what it taught me
Tell me how
It's better if I make no sound
I will never escape these doubts
I wasn't dead when they found me
Watch as they pull me down

Watch as they pull me down
Watch as they pull me down
Pulling me down
Dead when they found me
Watch as they pull me down
Watch as they pull me down
Watch as they pull me down
Pulling me down
Dead when they found me
Watch as they pull me down

I'm writing a book on how to stay conscious when you drown
And if the words float up to the surface
I'll keep them down
This is the first time I know
I don't want the crown
You can take it now
You can take it now
Take it now
