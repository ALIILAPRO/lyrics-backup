		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't make my own decisions
Or make any with precision
Well, maybe you should tie me up
So I don't go where you don't want me

You say that I've been changing
That I'm not just simply ageing
Yeah, how could that be logical?
Just keep on cramming ideas down my throat

Woah
You don't have to believe me
But the way I, way I see it
Next time you point a finger
I might have to bend it back
And break it, break it off
Next time you point a finger
I'll point you to the mirror

If God's the game that you're playing
Well, we must get more acquainted
Because it has to be so lonely
To be the only one who's holy

It's just my humble opinion
But it's one that I believe in
You don't deserve a point of view
If the only thing you see is you

Woah
You don't have to believe me
But the way I, way I see it
Next time you point a finger
I might have to bend it back
And break it, break it off
Next time you point a finger
I'll point you to the mirror

This is the last second chance
(I'll point you to the mirror)
I'm half as good as it gets
(I'll point you to the mirror)
I'm on both sides of the fence
(I'll point you to the mirror)
Without a hint of regret
I'll hold you to it

I know you don't believe me
But the way I, way I see it
Next time you point a finger
I might have to bend it back
Or break it, break it off
Next time you point a finger
I'll point you to the mirror

I know you won't believe me
But the way I, way I see it
Next time you point a finger
I might have to bend it back
And break it, break it off
Next time you point a finger
I'll point you to the mirror
