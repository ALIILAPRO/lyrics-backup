		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been telling lines 
I never knew
all to keep that girl 
away from you
but she may call you up tonight
then what could I say 
that would sound right

Thoughts that raised my mind 
just pushed aside
all the chances there
that we once had
but she may call you up tonight
then what could I say 
that would sound right

And when I'm crying
yes I know my mind is flying
to a place where there's no trying
but she may call you up tonight

I've been telling lines 
I never knew
all to keep that girl 
away from you
but she may call you up tonight
then what could I say
that would sound right

but she may call you up tonight
then what could I say 
that would sound right
then what could I say
that would sound right
