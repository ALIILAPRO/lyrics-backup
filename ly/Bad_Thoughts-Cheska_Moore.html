		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe it's crossed my mind
Thought about it from time to time
Once or twice
Wondering if I
Could commit to such a
You're twisting my words again
I never said it
Kept it open ended
Apprehended with no intent
It's not what I meant
There'll be no getting even
I'll make you believe it
Convinced you're out on your own
Sometimes I get bad thoughts
Coming up again
Talking like a friend
3am in bed kinda
Bad thoughts
Bad thoughts
Sometimes I get bad thoughts
Fading out of colour
Talking to each other
Acting like a lover
Kinda bad thoughts
Bad thoughts
Find it hard to let it go
How the hell am I supposed
To ignore the feeling I fear the most
When I feel the most
There'll be no getting even
I'll make you believe it
Convinced you're out on your own
Sometimes I get bad thoughts
Coming up again
Talking like a friend
3am in bed kinda
Bad thoughts
Bad thoughts
Sometimes I get bad thoughts
Fading out of colour
Talking to each other
Acting like a lover
Kinda bad thoughts
Bad thoughts
Let the stings show
It's out of my control
And it's more divine than I think I know
Once the band plays
I only picture it this way
This way
Sometimes I get bad thoughts
Coming up again
Talking like a friend
3am in bed kinda
Bad thoughts
Bad thoughts
Sometimes I get bad thoughts
Fading out of colour
Talking to each other
Acting like a lover
Kinda bad thoughts
Bad thoughts
