		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I deny my eyes to the violence
To die inside with a price
Guilt weighing on my conscience 
And no restraint for the fury that rises 

Drive the nail through vacant enclosures
Forced to hide behind a fence for the damned
Feeding on toxicity, it's virulent
Consumed unconcerned, a brand so permanent

Outreached hands meant for sustenance
Are bound by apathetic offenders 
Your filthy fingernails are gripped to a chalice
Forged from the spines of the overburdened

Set ablaze, reanimate
Through suffering we will remain
Will remain

Shadowed by piercing eyes that graze across your back
So fade into a place that feeds your emptiness 
All of your intentions are burdened by riches
False divinity feasting with the wretched

Wishing for better days
Your misguided eyes are blinded by the shine
Washed up and sent away
You felt more alive when you died on the inside

Set ablaze, reanimate
Through suffering, we will remain
This is all that it takes
Set ablaze when you're too close to the flame
Barely breathing
Set ablaze, reanimate

Forged inside the flames 
You placed the blame and hid your shame
Cover your face
Remember what you stood for
Became erased, you've been betrayed and led astray
Embrace the end of your false divinity

I am the idling violence
I am the fear in your silence
