		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was bruised and battered 
I couldn't tell what I felt
I was unrecognizable to myself
Saw my reflection in a window 
And didn't know my own face
Oh brother are you gonna leave me wastin' away
On the streets of Philadelphia?

I walked the avenue, 'til my legs felt like stone
I heard the voices of friends vanished and gone
At night I could hear the blood in my veins
Just as black and whispering as the rain
On the streets of Philadelphia

Ain't no angel gonna greet me
It's just you and I my friend
And my clothes don't fit me no more, I walk
Thousand miles just to slip this skin

Night has fallen, I'm lyin' awake
I can feel myself fading away
So receive me brother with your faithless kiss
Or will we leave each other alone like this
On the streets of Philadelphia?
