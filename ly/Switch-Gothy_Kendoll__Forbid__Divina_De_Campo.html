		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Switch it up, switch it up
Switch it up, switch it up
Switch it up, switch it up
Switch it up, switch it up
 Boy I gotta do it right, nice and tight
Latex whip all night,
All your senses ignite, excite
Ain’t gonna be polite -
Body palace gold versailles, oh my
A shrine, worship, divine,
Gotcha feeling so alive, a sign
I’m gonna make you mine 

Got you down, by the throat
Slap your ass, make you choke
Do you hard, on the bed
Make your body shiver, yeah 
Got you down, by the throat
Slap your ass, make you choke
Do you hard, on the bed
Make your body tingle, yeah 

Got you down, by the throat
Slap your ass, make you choke
Do you hard, on the bed
Make your body shiver, yeah 
Got you down, by the throat
Slap your ass, make you choke
Do you hard, on the bed
Make your body tingle, yeah 

Make you wanna break a vow, taste it now,
Flawless, take a bow
Sweat dripping of your brow, go down
You better show me how,
Mad that you had to wait, hesitate
Boy make no mistake, 
Body filling up with hate, you ache
Feeling intoxicated

Down, by the throat
Slap your ass, make you choke
Do you hard, on the bed
Make your body shiver, yeah 
Got you down, by the throat
Slap your ass, make you choke
Do you hard, on the bed
Make your body tingle, yeah 

I told you how I like it, now I want it like this
Im calling all the shots, I employ and dismiss
Just stimulate my senses, that’s your one and only mission
Now follow my command, it’s time to switch up the position

I told you how I like it, now I want it like this
Im calling all the shots, I employ and dismiss
Just stimulate my senses, that’s your one and only mission
Just got one question, can you switch it up?

Boy you wanna flip the roles, own my soul
Yeah you on a roll,
Gonna do as I’m told, I’m gold
Yeah now you in control 
Make me wanna feel your pain, no shame
Boy this is just a game,
Imma let you take the reigns, in chains
My whole body in flames (or) whole body in flames 

(Now) Do me hard, on the bed
Make my body shiver, yeah
Got me down, by the throat
Slap my ass, make me choke
Do me hard, on the bed
Make my body tingle, yeah

Got me down, by the throat
Slap my ass, make me choke
Do me hard, on the bed
Make my body shiver, yeah
Got me down, by the throat
Slap my ass, make me choke
Do me hard, on the bed
Make my body tingle, yeah
