		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm always screamin' my lungs out 'til my head starts spinnin'
Playin' my songs is the way I cope with life
Won't keep my voice down
Know the words I speak are the thoughts I think out loud
I like to keep things honest
I'm a safe bet like your life's staked on it, for real
I'd hate to keep you all wonderin'
I'm constant like the seasons, I will never be forgotten, man

Let's leave no words unspoken
And save regrets for the broken
Will you even look back when you think of me?

All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know
To keep your hopes up high and your head down low
Keep your hopes up high and your head down low

Still got something left to prove, it tends to keep things movin'
While everyone around me says my last days are looming overhead
But just what the hell do they think they know?
My head's above the water while they drown in the undertow

Let's leave no words unspoken
And save regrets for the broken
Will you even look back when you think of me?

All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know
To keep your hopes up high and your head down low
All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know
To keep your hopes up high and your head down low

If you take it from me
Live your life for yourself
'Cause when it's all said and done
You don't need anyone else, come on

So let's get back to when everything seemed perfect
Not a worry in the world, tell me, was it all worth it?
I get what I want, so everyone's always judgin' me
Not afraid of anything, I've got the whole world in front of me

All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know
To keep your hopes up high and your head down low
All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know
To keep your hopes up high and your head down low

Keep your head down low
Keep your head down low
Keep your hopes up high and your head down low
