		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sixteen and a son of a bitch
Got a gun and a strychnine twist
Little girl on the graveyard shift
Out of control and doesn't give a shit

I don't wanna go down. I don't wanna go down.
I don't wanna go down. I don't wanna go down.

Gonna lose control!
So stop, drop, and roll.

So, baby-doll, don't you lose your touch.
You take it all cause it's never gonna take too much.

Dirty mouth and the look of death.
My tequila coming' from your breath.
Your lips are like a cherry bomb with teeth
Losing control, break my sanity.

I don't wanna go down. I don't wanna go down.
I don't wanna go down. I don't wanna go down.

Gonna lose control!
So stop, drop, and roll.

So, baby-doll, don't you lose your touch.
You take it all cause it's never gonna take too much.

I don't wanna go down. I don't wanna go down.
I don't wanna go down. I don't wanna go down.

Gonna lose control!
So stop, drop, and roll.

Alright!

So, baby-doll, don't you lose your touch.
You take it all cause it's never gonna take too much.

So, baby-doll, don't you lose your touch.
You take it all cause it's never gonna take too much.
