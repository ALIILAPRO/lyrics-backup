		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Welcome to your office settle down and take a seat
Please pay no attention to the terrifying screams
You should heed the warnings of the voice that's on the phone
Tonight you might be by yourself but you are not alone

The masks that we wear
Pretend they aren't there
But you can only hide for so long

Why don't you
Spend the night
Then you'll find
There's evil that waits inside
Spend the night
Then you'll find
There's evil that waits inside
Spend the night
Then you'll find
There's evil that waits inside
Spend the night
Then you'll find
There's evil that waits inside

It's me
Me me me me me me me me
Me me me me me me me me

There's evil that waits inside
It's me

Though we tried our best you seem to have beginner's luck
We came so close but we just couldn't make you one of us
Congratulations are deserved it's 6 AM you win
We'll see you here tomorrow night and do it all again

The masks that we wear
Pretend they aren't there
But you can only hide for so long (So long)

Why don't you
Spend the night
Then you'll find
There's evil that waits inside
Spend the night
Then you'll find
There's evil that waits inside
Spend the night
Then you'll find
There's evil that waits inside
Spend the night
Then you'll find
There's evil that waits inside

It's me
Me me me me me me me me
Me me me me me me me me

There's evil that waits inside
It's me
