		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  on the last weekend before the fall, down at the beach carnival, spinning slowly with the carousel. your gold hoop earrings go so well with the little yellow lights, shining on a foggy day, painting you a pretty shade like you were a girl in a watercolor. i could try but i can't explain how i do, i just know it's something supernatural and i'm feeling super natural. i don't know how but i can say that i found my religion when nothing was ahead of us that week in california. hold on, won't the water be too cold? out of your mind and you're still so photogenic. i like the lighting on you right at sundown. we've done too much to ever go back to the way it was. maybe i imagined it being so good. man, it seems like everything i remember doing we were in a cloud and i can't tell if it was in my head or in san francisco.Â
