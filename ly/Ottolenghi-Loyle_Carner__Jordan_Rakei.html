		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was sat up on the train
Staring out the window at the rain (aye)
I heard this little lady must've felt the pain
Ask her mum if the blazing sun'll ever shine again
I felt ashamed, feel the same not her mother, though
Nah, started to laugh got her son involved (aye)
Mention the past like a running joke
And told her without all the rain there's no stuntin' growth
Close, ah, to everything and nothing, picture past the honeymoon and bluffing
Where the wooden spoon is only cuffing
Shorter the discussion but the roots can't manoeuvre out of nothing
I've been suffering these dreamy days (ah)
Remedy and lust don't hold any memories of us
Rather hold you everyday until the memories are dust
Yo, we only caught the train cause you know I hate the bus
Never get enough

Born and raised
Made attempts to crawl away
Find a way to exist and hide your face, some relate
Leave everything in yesterday

They ask about the bible I was reading
Told them that the title was misleading, labelled it jerusalem
But really it's for cooking middle eastern
I could see your mind was changing with the seasons, shady for a reason (ah)
They will start decreasing, leaving like the orange in the evening
It was creeping through the clouds but now I'm proud to see the images releasing
I just wish the little lady could've seen it but she was dreaming (ah)
Reckon she's standing with her mum, saying to her
"Look, mother, here's the sun", rooted in the moment 'til the memories are done
So I sit and start to wonder on the woman she'll become
Wonder if I'll have a son or a daughter
Ones that I brought up never strong, never telling me to run
Never tried to find a sum, tryna get it done
Yo, I wonder if she'll ever be as clever as her mum, one

Born and raised
Made attempts to crawl away
Find a way to exist and hide your face, some relate
Leave everything in yesterday
Born and raised
Made attempts to crawl away
Find a way to exist and hide your face, some relate
Leave everything in yesterday

"Man, we can turn back in a second
So remember what I'm tryna show you
This life can be good one minute
And next minute it can turn bad
So don't look down on nobody
'Cause that's how life can turn for everybody
So remember it's love, everybody
And I'm gonna look for life, for my time
Thank you"
