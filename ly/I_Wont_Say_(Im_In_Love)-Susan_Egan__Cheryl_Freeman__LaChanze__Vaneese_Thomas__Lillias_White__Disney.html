		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If there's a prize for rotten judgement
I guess I've already won that
No man is worth the aggravation
That's ancient history, been there, done that

Who d'you think you're kidding?
He's the earth and heaven to you
Try to keep it hidden
Honey, we can see right through you
Girl, you can't conceal it
We know how you're feeling
Who you thinking of

No chance, no way, I won't say it, no, no
(You swoon, you sigh ,why deny it? Oh-oh)
It's too cliche, I won't say I'm in love
I thought my heart had learned its lesson
It feels so good when you start out
My head is screaming, "Get a grip, girl"
Unless you're dying to cry your heart out

Girl, you can't deny it
Who you are is how you're feeling
Baby, we're not buying
Hon, we saw you hit the ceiling
Face it like a grown-up
When you gonna own up that you got, got, got, it bad?

No chance, no way, I won't say it, no, no
(Give up, give in, check the grin, you're in love)
This scene won't play, I won't say I'm in love
(We'll do it until you admit you're in love)
You're way off base, I won't say it
Get off my case, I won't say it
(Girl, don't be proud, it's okay, you're in love)
At least out loud, I won't say I'm in love
