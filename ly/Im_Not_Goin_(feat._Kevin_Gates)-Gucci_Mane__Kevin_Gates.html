		  Drop top, huh
Burr
Evil Knievel
I ain't really finna tell y'all how to get away with murder and shit

They told me, "Stop buying all these fancy cars" 
They told me, "Please take all your diamonds off"
I'm getting too rich to fly commercial flights
They wanna lock me up like Suge Knight
I know that bitch want me to go for that (but I don't wanna)
But I'm too rich to put my dick in that (bitch, I'm not gonna, no)
I hit that bitch way back, I gave her back ('cause I don't want her)
They love my drip, you know I'm stating facts (I'm not going)

I'm a CEO, I keep it cordial with an artist, I just don't politic
These women been giving me compliments
Focused, I can't acknowledge this
Astonishment, ugh, look at how the game transformed overnight
Felt like I was just getting read my rights
Look at how the ice sitting under them lights
Married to the game
We ain't throwing no rice
All grey sweats, with the white G-Nikes
Ain't too much changed, got too much change
Come to think about it, I was looking at life
Stack, invest, nigga don't just rap
Talking 'bout dap, nigga can't do 'dat
Fetch me the keys, I mean remote
Car got a button, I'm 'bout to float
I'm organized, it looking organized
'Cause the front of house looks like a parking lot
Take off the shirt, check out the work
Body scribbled like a mark a lot
Bandana Louis, no vest and a fully
Buying dogs, I'm investing in bully's
I came from that, I perfected my jooging
Diamond teeth, got a watch full of boogers
Got a chef, vegetarian cooking
Camera man, get professional footage

They told me, "Stop buying all these fancy cars" (but I don't wanna)
They told me, "Please take all your diamonds off" (but I'm not gonna)
I'm getting too rich to fly commercial flights ('cause I don't wanna)
They wanna lock me up like Suge Knight (but I'm not gonna)
I know that bitch want me to go for that (but I don't wanna)
But I'm too rich to put my dick in that (bitch, I'm not gonna)
I hit that bitch way back, I gave her back ('cause I don't want her)
They love my drip, you know I'm stating facts (I'm not going)

The world's most hate-able, currently unavailable
Solo roof from hater proof
Pull up, watch what the haters do
Gucci's anti-social, bi-polar, he's unrelatable
Heard he wrote a novel, got labels, but you can't label him
Independent labels, they model him and they study him
Hood rich lingo, he model, but he not stunting them
Northern people come 'round me, flex, start talking Southern now
Moving like the government
Fuck it, bitch I'm the governor
I'm the new Puffy, fuck it, the new 50
I'm the new Baby (bling)
Fuck it, the new Jimmy
Big rock frigid (yeah)
Fucking up hoes vision
Coupe, no ceiling, ceiling has gone missing

They told me, "Stop buying all these fancy cars" (but I don't wanna)
They told me, "Please take all your diamonds off" (but I'm not gonna)
I'm getting too rich to fly commercial flights ('cause I don't wanna)
They wanna lock me up like Suge Knight (but I'm not gonna)
I know that bitch want me to go for that (but I don't wanna)
But I'm too rich to put my dick in that (bitch, I'm not gonna, no)
I hit that bitch way back, I gave her back ('cause I don't want her)
They love my drip, you know I'm stating facts (I'm not going)
