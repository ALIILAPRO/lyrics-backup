		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I chased my dreams and I chased the highs (chased the highs)
(It's YouNotUs)

I've had enough of these city lights
I crave the birds and the trees tonight
I'm on the road, yeah I'll be alright
I'm coming home, I'm coming home

I've had enough of these city lights
I crave the birds and the trees tonight
I'm on the road, yeah I'll be alright
I'm coming home, I'm coming home

I had a love, didn't get it right
Chased my dreams and I chased the highs
But they ain't gonna hold me tight
I'm coming home, I'm coming home

I chased my dreams and I chased the highs
I chased the highs
I chased my dreams and I chased the highs
I chased the highs

Done with the streets and the boulevards
All the lights blocking out the stars
In my mind I'm in a speeding car
I'm coming home, I'm coming home

I've had enough of these city lights
I crave the birds and the trees tonight
I'm on the road, yeah I'll be alright
I'm coming home, I'm coming home

I had a love, didn't get it right
Chased my dreams and I chased the highs
But they ain't gonna hold me tight
I'm coming home, I'm coming home

I chased my dreams and I chased the highs
I chased the highs
I chased my dreams and I chased the highs
I chased the highs
