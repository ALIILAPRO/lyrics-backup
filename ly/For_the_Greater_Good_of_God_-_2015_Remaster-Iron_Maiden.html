		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you a man of peace
Or a man of holy war?
Too many sides to you
Don't know which anymore
So many full of life
But also filled with pain
Don't know just how many
Will live to breathe again

A life that's made to breathe
Destruction or defense
A mind that's vain corruption
Bad or good intent
A wolf in sheep's clothing
Or saintly or sinner
Or some that would believe
A holy war winner

They fire off many shots
And many parting blows
Their actions beyond a reasoning
Only God would know
And as he lies in heaven
Or it could be in hell
I feel he's somewhere here
Or looking from below
But I don't know, I don't know

Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is

More pain and misery in the history of mankind
Sometimes it seems more like
The blind leading the blind
It brings upon us more of famine, death and war
You know religion has a lot to answer for

Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is

And as they search to find 
The bodies in the sand
They find its ashes that are
Scattered across the land
And as the spirits seem to whistle on the wind
A shot is fired somewhere another war begins

And all because of it 
You'd think that we would learn
But still the body count the city fires burn
Somewhere there's someone dying
In a foreign land
Meanwhile the world is crying 
Stupidity of man
Tell me why?
Tell me why?

Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is

Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is

For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God

Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is

Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is

For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God

He gave his life for us
He fell upon the cross
To die for all of those
Who never mourn his loss
It wasn't meant for us
To feel the pain again
Tell me why?
Tell me why?
