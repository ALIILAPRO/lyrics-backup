		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're tellin' me the world
Does not even spin around?
You're tryna say the car we're sittin' in
Don't belong to gravity?

You keep sayin' I don't care
'Cause I won't join you goin' there
So I go flex like it's better than there
Both of us human in a way
We're good and bad within a day
Is there nothin' but to carry on?

We didn't make it to the moon
It doesn't matter if it's true
Darling, it's always me and you
It's still a Friday afternoon
Don't have to make it to the moon

Paper planes takin' flight
But don't you like that mystery?
Fireflies a thousand times
How could we misjudge a thing?

You keep sayin' I don't care
'Cause I won't join you goin' there
So I go flex like it's better than there
And we're just human in a way
We're good and bad within a day
Is there nothin' but to carry on?

We didn't make it to the moon
It doesn't matter if it's true
Darling, it's always me and you
It's still a Friday afternoon
Don't have to make it to the moon
We didn't make it to the moon

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

We didn't make it to the moon (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
It doesn't matter if it's true (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Darling, it's always me and you (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
It's still a Friday afternoon (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Don't have to make it to the moon (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
