		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh ooh, don't let it slip away
Ooh Ooh, don't let it get away

Can you hear me right now
I got your number and I'm callin' you out
With liquid courage, I can beat all my doubt
There's not another, so I'm chasin' you down
Chasin' you down

Can you see me right now
I'm comin' closer think I figured you out
Not like the others
You don't blend with the crowd
I've blown your cover, now I'm takin' you down
Takin' you down

Can you hear me right now
I got your number and I'm callin' you out
With liquid courage, I can beat all my doubt
There's not another, so I'm chasin' you down
Chasin' you down

Ooh ooh, don't let it get away
Ooh ooh, don't let it slip away

Can you see me right now
I'm comin' closer think I figured you out
Not like the others
You don't blend with the crowd
I've blown your cover, now I'm takin' you down
Takin' you down

Can you hear me right now
I got your number and I'm callin' you out
With liquid courage, I can beat all my doubt
There's not another, so I'm chasin' you down
Chasin' you down

Can you see me right now
I'm comin' closer think I figured you out
Not like the others
You don't blend with the crowd
I've blown your cover, now I'm takin' you down
Takin' you down

Ooh Ooh
Don't let it slip away
Ooh Ooh
Don't let it get away
Ooh Ooh
Don't let it get away
Ooh Ooh
Won't let you slip away

Can you hear me right now
I got your number and I'm callin' you out
With liquid courage, I can beat all my doubt
There's not another, so I'm chasin' you down
Chasin' you down
