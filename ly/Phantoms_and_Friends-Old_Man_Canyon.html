		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I awoke I felt the call to go
Those places that I never thought I'd go
I spent the time to see which way to walk
But now that road just crumbles as I talk

Don't let the ones that want to steal your dreams
They'll steal your dreams away
Just laugh and let it go
Don't let the ones that want to steal your dreams
They'll steal your dreams away
Just laugh and let it go

So you've tried to pass along your doubt
Oh you need somebody's ears to hear you shout
All your wasted days and twisted ways are up
So now its time to see the cards you're dealt

Don't let the ones that want to steal your dreams
They'll steal your dreams away
Just laugh and let it go

I know all your names
Pointing different ways
Let me out
I came up I saw you there
Now I know
Now I know
I rose up my fear was gone
Now I know
Now I know

Don't let the ones that want to steal your dreams
They'll steal your dreams away
Just laugh and let it go
Don't let the ones that want to steal your dreams
They'll steal your dreams away
Just laugh and let it go
