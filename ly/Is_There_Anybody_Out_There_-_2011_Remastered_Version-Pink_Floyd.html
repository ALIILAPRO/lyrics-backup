		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "Well, only got an hour of daylight left. Better get started"
"Isn't it unsafe to travel at night?"
"It'll be a lot less safe to stay here, your father's gunna pick up our trail before long"
"Can Loca ride?"
"Yeah, I can ride, Margaret, time to go! Maigret, thank you for everything"
"Goodbye Chenga"
"Goodbye miss"
"I'll be back"

Is there anybody out there?
