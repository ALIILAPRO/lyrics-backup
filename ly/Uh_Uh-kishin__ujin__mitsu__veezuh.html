		  Uh, Uh
Uh, Uh
Uh, Uh
I'm the one
Moving different but I'm still the same
If I say it then you can get stained
Not my bitch, no you cannot come stay
Nuh Uh
I got sons
Think they different but they sound the same
I can never hang around no lame
Got a bitch in every other state
Uh huh
Gotta count up
No, I can't go broke
She on her knees
Got my dick in her throat
Smoking exotic and it got me slow
Never catch me sad over any ho
Bank account, and I fill it with O's
I be selling what they cook in stoves
I got money, but, I want some more
Never stopping, that shit don't get old
Damn
Took a lot to get to where I'm at
I feel like the Margiela man
Stupid bitch said she wanna hold my hand
But I'm counting bands up in Yen
Going up that's a knack
F&N make his ass go splat
Japanese thot told that bitch don't gag
She wanna ride with the crew
All of my bills they blue
Keeping my shit, aloof
All of my sons they start to hate on me like that's they job
Can't be showing no love cuz I know they gon' be taking it up
They ass, but I don't wanna speak too much
Cause I don't wanna bore my lungs
My bitch got out last week
She my lil plug but she a neek tho
Had to run up like three folds
Guess she proud of me
She wanna come over
Told that bitch laylow
Fuck it my hoodie
You know that shit Chrome
Talking my shit cause you know I'm the goat
Too many sons and they all tryna clone
Got too many clones, got too many clothes
My name in your mouth better keep that shit closed
I keep to myself, I dnd my phone, go
I got a red eye to catch
I don't give a fuck bout my ex's
She askin me, mitsu what's next
I get a bag bigger than Texas
I stay whippin in an AMG
No S class or that Lexus
They say mitsu your flow is infectious
Like oh
I can tell she wanna say the L word
But I told that bitch to save it
And I put that shit on God
Put that on my life like David
Can't love ho's, they way too basic
I run it up, bitch I run it like asic
She doin tricks on the dick
Halfway through she tell me
That she wanna tape it, uh
They wanna eat my dick
Bitch I feel like a mf cater
She got a fat ass
But she want it fatter than
Bitch I might just cake it
Ain't talkin league when I say u a faker
Bitch I been runnin up, runnin up paper
I'm not a super hero, I can't save her
This shit so effortless
I make a master piece
All of these bitches come after me
Bih, after me
