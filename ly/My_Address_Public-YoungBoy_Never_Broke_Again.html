		  Come on, hmm
Come on, hmm
Come on, mmm
Come on, come on
Lil Top, nigga (D-Roc)

Woke up in the mornin', smoke my Newport like a camel, I need answers
I'm fucked up and I been contemplatin' 'bout blammin' 'em and slammin' 'em
Tryna stick you out your cannon, bitch, then lay you on a canvas
All this money layin' 'round this bitch, I'm long ways from sadly
I'm a savage like my daddy, I get active, yeah, you heard me
Tote .223s in my 23s, bitch, make me pop out that 'Burban
Pussy niggas wan' swerve me, she heard about it, she worried
Pull on side me, open fire, I'm tryna do a bitch dirty

Ooh, ballin'
Put her in that Cullinan, tell 'em that I'm slime
Say ooh, I'm thuggin'
Tell him that I'm on 'em, my address public
'Cause I got a chopper 'round this motherfucker
I got my Glock out, tryna blow at something
She was on my dick and you know I fucked her
Over a million dollars layin' on the table
I got my cutter, nigga

Yeah, bitch, come and fuck with me
Two-four-seven gettin' it, I been tryna make a way
I, I been grindin', tryna make a livin'
Baby girl, you the sickest, why you hidin'?
I fly you private, come fuck with me, yeah
Yeah, fly you to my city, yeah
Salt Lake, this my business, bitch
Pressed, why you up in it? Yeah
I'm Kentrell, yeah, you see me winnin'
I'm the one who split him when I got fresh out of prison
Pour up on that keke, I'm YB, you know me
Poured up off that codeine, I'm strapped, I'm movin' slowly
I'm so fuckin' lonely, I been needin' her for to hold me
But once I put it on her, she want money, get from 'round me
I'm a fuckin' gunner, still that same way that they found me
At the celebrity ball game, diamonds runnin' through my teeth
Friends posted some years later, I'm happy who ain't fuck with me
And bitch, you better not fuck with me, you know I got this gun on me, hmm

Ballin'
Put her in that Cullinan, tell 'em that I'm slime
Say, ooh, I'm thuggin'
Tell him that I'm on 'em, my address public
'Cause I got a chopper 'round this motherfucker
I got my Glock out, tryna blow at something
She was on my dick and you know I fucked her
Over a million dollars layin' on the table
I got my cutter, nigga

Pour up on that keke, I'm YB, you know me
Poured up off that codeine, I'm strapped, I'm movin' slowly
I'm so fuckin' lonely, I been needin' her for to hold me
But once I put it on her, she want money, get from 'round me
I'm a fuckin' gunner, still that same way that they found me
At the celebrity ball game, diamonds runnin' through my teeth
Friends posted some years later, I'm happy who ain't fuck with me
And bitch, you better not fuck with me, you know I got this gun on me
