		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wham, re-bop-boom-bam
I can sing and I can jam

Wham, re-bop-boom-bam
I'm a killer-diller, yes, I am

Wham, re-bop-boom-bam
Romp it, stomp it, ride it too

Wham, re-bop-boom-bam
Jam it, jump it, jive it through

Some folks say that Swing won't stay
And it's dying out
But I can prove it's in the groove
And they don't know what they're talking 'bout
Wham, re-bop-boom-bam
Easy to do like the Suzie Q
Wham, re-bop-boom-bam
If I can do it, you can too

The wham, re-bop-boom-bam
I can sing and I can jam

Wham, re-bop-boom-bam
I'm a killer-diller, yes, I am

Some folks say that Swing won't stay
And it's dying out
But I can prove it's in the groove
And they don't know what they're talking 'bout
Wham, re-bop-boom-bam
Easy to do like the Suzie Q
Wham, re-bop-boom-bam
Ridge, if you can do it, I can too

Wham, re-bop-boom-bam
And she's a killer-diller
Truly am
