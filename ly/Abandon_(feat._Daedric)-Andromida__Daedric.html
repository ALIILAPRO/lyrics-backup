		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I abandon hope)
(I abandon hope)

I conjure the phantom of another hollow you
Then drag it to the bottom
Pretending in a cycle I find sacred
But I mean nothing to you
Just a piece of the pattern in your ruse
I spiral into chaos riptides

I abandon hope
Believing we'd survive this
While sinking in a crisis
That's drowning only me
Tried to follow ghosts
I'm grasping for the shadows
As if it ever mattered
I'm unseen

I'm drifting in water that will overtake my thoughts
And pull me to the bottom
Descending in a matrix
I am a foolish whimper
Disappearing with no echo and
I spiral into chaos riptides

I abandon hope
Believing we'd survive this
While sinking in a crisis
That's drowning only me
Tried to follow ghosts
I'm grasping for the shadows
As if it ever mattered
I'm unseen

The pressure crushes my chest
(The pressure)
(The pressure)
(The pressure crushes my chest)
The pressure crushes my chest
The anchor on my heart

(The pressure crushes my chest)
(But feels gentle compared to the anchor on my heart)

(I abandon, abandon hope)

I abandon hope
Believing we'd survive this
While sinking in a crisis
That's drowning only me

I abandon hope
Tried to follow ghosts
I'm unseen

I abandon hope
Believing we'd survive this
(I abandon hope)
While sinking in a crisis
That's drowning only me

(I abandon hope)
(I abandon hope)
