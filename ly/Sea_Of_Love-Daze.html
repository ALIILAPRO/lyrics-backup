		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't you never let me go
Don't you ever let it show
I will cry in the Sea Of Love
The stars will always shine
And I'm gonna make you mine, tonight
Tonight (repeat x2)
I belive in rainy weather, some days (haaaah)
But when I'm down and feeling blue,
you come and say:
Have you ever really seen the rainbow
Have you ever really touched the blue blue sky
Have you ever really seen a falling star
Here me cry tonight
(ref:)
Don't you never let me go
Don't you ever let it show
I will cry in the Sea Of Love
The stars will always shine
And I'm gonna make you mine tonight
Tonight
I want you, I need you
And my heart is beating softly baby
If you leave me, desieve me
I will never see the sun rise again
Never fear what love can do
To you
'Cause I belive we'll find a way
This I say to you:
Have you ever really seen the rainbow
Have you ever really touched the blue blue sky
Have you ever really seen a falling star
Here me cry tonight
(ref:)
Don't you never let me go
Don't you ever let it show
I will cry in the Sea Of Love
The stars will always shine
And I'm gonna make you mine tonight
Tonight
I want you, I need you
And my heart is beating softly baby
If you leave me, desieve me
I will never see the sun rise again
(Sea Of Love) x 2
Have you ever really seen the rainbow
Have you ever really touched the blue blue sky
Have you ever really seen a falling star
Here me cry tonight
Don't you never let me go
Don't you ever let it show
I will cry in the Sea Of Love
The stars will always shine
And I'm gonna make you mine tonight
Tonight
I want you, I need you
And my heart is beating softly baby
If you leave me, desieve me
I will never see the sun rise again
