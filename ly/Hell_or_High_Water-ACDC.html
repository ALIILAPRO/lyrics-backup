		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get out my way
D'you hear what I say? Get out the way

Everybody, you don't have to choose
You don't have to prove
It's only rock 'n' roll

Mama done told me
Papa done scold me

Superstition, black cat in the cradle
Dancing on the table
Don't you sing on me

Mama done told me
Daddy done scold me
Told me, shown me
You know that he showed me

Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water

Blood money, lying through your back teeth
Fighting on the main street
Breathe your last breath on me

Mama done told me
"Poor boy, get home"

Hot living, trigger-happy feeling
Touch him up and tease him
You know it's so bad

Mama done told me
Papa done scold me
Told me, shown me
Rock 'n' rolled me

Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water

Come Hell
Hell, Hell, Hell
Give it Hell

Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water

Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na

Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water

Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water
I tell ya come Hell
Come Hell
Come Hell
Come on Hell, yeah
