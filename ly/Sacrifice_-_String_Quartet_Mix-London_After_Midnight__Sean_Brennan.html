		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And here we go to again 
we taken it to the end 
we every walkin moment 
we face the silent torment 

i`d sacrifise 
i`d sacrifise myself to you 
right here tonight 
because you know that i love you 

darkness, is all i want to see 
never put in to words 
what it is you mean to me 

i`d sacrifise 
i`d sacrifise myself to you 
right here tonight 
because you know that i love you 

the candle burning lower 
at the window to my soul 
the reapter is my door now 
he is come to take me home 

i`d sacrifise 
i`d sacrifise myself to you 
right here tonight 
because you know that i love you
