		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, make you wanna, uh
Yeah, yeah
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay

Now have you ever been with a player?
Take you downtown where they treat me like the mayor
Take you to the crib, we can take it upstairs (what's upstairs?) 
Shit, I'ma show you later
Don't need a spatula, everything catered
Extra flavor, go 'head
Sprinkle some truffle on your mashed potatoes
I'm tryna love, is you gon' love me back?
You only get what you give, ain't you heard of that?

Look here
I don't ask for much
You know what I want
I just want what's fair (huh)
I'll bring that fire and desire, baby
All you gotta do is meet me halfway there, uh

I deserve to be 
With somebody as fly as me
Somebody this fly
And you deserve to be seen 
With somebody as fly as me
Somebody this fly

Oh, don't let 'em trick you with the jibb talk (ow)

Uh, okay, now Silk Sonic smooth like a mack
Float like a butterfly on every single track
And the only language that I speak, girl, is facts
So once I give this game to you, I can't take it back
Hollerin' at you from a 1977 Monte Carlo
Hard act to follow, it's showtime
Tryna boo you up like it's the Apollo
Your walk is viscous, let's get down to business
You and me together, woo, that's somethin' different

Ooh, come on
I don't ask for much
I really don't, girl
I just want what's fair 
Ha, look here
I'll bring that fire and desire, baby
All you gotta do is this
All you gotta do is meet me halfway there (uh)

I deserve to be 
With somebody as fly as me
Somebody this fly
And you deserve to be seen
With somebody as fly as me
Somebody this fly

Nah, for real, I'ma need y'all to understand
Let's get it

If you don't know what we talkin' 'bout
I'ma have the whole band help me spell it out
Yeah, if you don't know what we talkin' 'bout
Class in session, here's your lesson, help me spell it out
F (F), L (L), Y (Y)
You ain't never seen nobody this fly
It's like we back in school again
Now come on children, now spell it
F (F), L (L), Y (Y)
You ain't never seen nobody this fly, ow
And I'm gone, uh

I deserve to be
With somebody as fly as me
Somebody this fly (fly)
And you deserve to be seen (you deserve to be seen)
With somebody as fly as me
Somebody this fly (ow, oh)

In the back
Somebody this fly
Yeah, and I'm looking for somebody this fly
Mmh, I can't help it, I want it all
Silk Sonic, let me get the three-piece and a biscuit, uh
