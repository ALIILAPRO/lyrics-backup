		  Break 'em off and cut 'em up, like
Break 'em off and cut 'em up, like
Break 'em off and cut 'em up, like
Break 'em off and cut 'em up, like
Break 'em off and cut 'em up, like
Break 'em off and cut 'em up, like
Break 'em off and cut 'em up, like
Break 'em off and cut 'em up, like

Uhh (Uhh)
It's the grey player, I'm a dame slayer
Playing games, ho's peelin' off my layers
Fuck a hater, I'ma blame it on the Navigator
Never gettin' paper, but I got a pair
Of boots that was made from alligator, uh
Fuckboy, see you later, keep your mouth shut
I don't fuck with traitors
Gotta make a dent in this world
Gotta find a flavor cherry marmalade, bitch
I spread it on my bread like a baker
Bitch, I'm fuckin' sunk like an anchor
Let me sink down, I don't need a lifesaver
Bitch i made a fucking promise to the devil
That I'd trade my fuckin' soul
So I settle with the motherfucking razor, uh!

Break 'em off and cut 'em up, like
Break 'em off and cut 'em up, like
Break 'em off and cut 'em up, like
Break 'em off and cut 'em up, like
Break 'em off and cut 'em up, like

Walk into the mind of a $uicide God
Chalk drawn lines with a body inside
Ride with the blade, or the MAC, or the gauge
Lil Gauge in the back make the blunt rotate
No fucking role model, I'll die before forty
Got Xans on me, now I pop more in the morning
Bitches be snappin' they tit's
But it's boring
Rather that hydro-codeine that I'm pouring
That codeine too weak for a
Fiend with a tolerance
Strip her down, fuck her once
Then I go rob the bitch!
Grey in my eyes and my
Heart don't feel nothin'
My fuckin' drug use never up for discussion
Forever-ever, pour yella, yella
Tombstone header readin', "Triple six"
And that's forever-ever
