		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's the hard-knock life for us
It's the hard-knock life for us
'Stead of treated 
We get tricked
'Stead of kisses 
We get kicked
It's the hard-knock life

Don't if feel like the wind is always howl'n? 
Don't it seem like there's never any light?
Once a day, don't you wanna throw the towel in? 
It's easier than puttin' up a fight

No one's there when your dreams at night get creepy
No one cares if you grow or if you shrink

Empty belly life
Rotten smelly life
Full of sorrow life
No tomorrow life

Santa Claus we never see 
Santa Claus, what's that? 
Who's he? 
No one cares for you a bit
When you're a foster kid 
It's the hard-knock life 

Make my bathroom shine
But don't touch my medicine cabinet

It's the hard-knock life for us (yank the whiskers from her chin)
It's the hard-knock life for us (jab her with a safety pin)
'Stead of treated 
We get tricked (send her to the looney bin)
'Stead of kisses 
We get kicked

It's the hard-knock life for us (yank the whiskers from her chin)
It's the hard-knock life for us (jab her with a safety pin)
No one cares for you a bit (send her to the looney bin)
When you're a foster kid 
It's the hard-knock life

It's the hard-knock life
