		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You shoulda heard me in the lounger
Telling people what they was
Spitting out all types of sugar
Just dying for a cause
Cause, cause

A smiler slithered to my corner
On a face so true
My word is always in the ready
And I'll attribute that to you

I don't belong to anyone
I don't belong to anyone
I don't belong to anyone
I don't wanna belong to anyone

You shoulda heard him in the bowery
Learning people with a tongue
Cut from second-hand cloth
Make the women feel young

I heard him serving as a soldier
In the annex of the earth
Threw himself before a bullet
And threw the metal to the dirt
Hear the man's word

I don't belong to anyone
I don't belong to anyone
I don't belong to anyone
I don't wanna belong to anyone

I don't belong to anyone
I don't belong to anyone
I don't belong to anyone
I don't wanna belong to anyone

I don't belong to anyone
I don't belong to anyone
I don't belong to anyone
I don't wanna belong to anyone
