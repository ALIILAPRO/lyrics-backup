		  Instructions
Won't be a path for me to walk
Streamlined
A given role to live apart
Release me
I try to move don't hold me back
Allegiance
To no one else but me

No one's seen what I have seen
No one's been where I have been
No, I wasn't born to follow
You can't train me

If you know me who I am
Got the knowledge of where I stand
A million ways to put me down
You can't train me

Can't touch me (You can't touch me)
Can't hurt me (You can't hurt me)
Can't frame me (You can't frame me)
Cut off my tongue, my mind still speaks


Please control yourself
Cultured? Society strikes and yet
He knows no bounds
They have committed acts
Against father nature
Acts define their mere existence
And make any decent person recoil
With disgust 

Silence
Instead of confrontation
New lies
To cover up the old
I want chaos
Destroy in order to create
Violence
I can't expose my name

No one's seen what I have seen
No one's been where I have been
No, I wasn't born to follow
You can't train me

Can't touch me
If you know me who I am
Can't hurt me
Got the knowledge of where I stand
Can't frame me
A million ways to put me down, you can't break me

Can't touch me (You can't touch me)
Can't hurt me (You can't hurt me)
Can't frame me (You can't frame me)
Cut off my tongue, my mind still speaks

Can't touch me
Can't frame me
No

No one's seen what I have seen
No one's been where I have been
No, I wasn't born to follow
You can't train me

Can't touch me
If you know me who I am
Can't hurt me
Got the knowledge of where I stand
Can't frame me
A million ways to put me down
You can't break me

Can't touch me (You can't touch me)
Can't hurt me (You can't hurt me)
Can't frame me (You can't frame me)
Cut off my tongue, my mind still speaks

Can't touch me
Can't hurt me
Can't frame me
My mind still speaks

Can't touch me
Can't hurt me
Can't frame me
My mind still speaks
