		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're perfect
(Oh, perfect)

I just can't control myself
I can't be with no one else
It seems I'm addicted
To the way you like to touch me

I don't think they understand
Why I love at your command
From the words you speak so deep
Our bodies meet, I have to have you

I love you, you're perfect
A manifestation of my dreams
You make my body feel
About a million different things

I think God made you for me
A mix of passion and fidelity
Baby, you're so complete

I write this song to let you know
That you will always be
To me, my lust, my love, my man
My child, my friend and my king

I love you, you're perfect
A manifestation of my dreams
You make my body feel
About a million different things

There's no way I'd leave you
It's just not a reality
Sometimes I feel like I'm
Living in a fantasy
