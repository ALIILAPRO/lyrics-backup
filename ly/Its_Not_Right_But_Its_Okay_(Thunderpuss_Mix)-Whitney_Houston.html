		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Friday night, you and your boys went out to eat, uh
Then they hung out, but you came home around three, yes, you did
If six of y'all went out, uh, then four of you were really cheap, yeah
'Cause only two of you had dinner, I found your credit card receipt

It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
And don't you dare come runnin' back to me
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you, leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy, yeah

Uh, uh
Uh, oh, uh

I'm packin' bags so you can leave town for a week, yes, I am
The phone rings, and then you look at me
You said it was one of your friends down on 54th Street, boy
So why did 213 show up on your caller ID? Oh

It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
And don't you dare come runnin' back to me
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you, leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy, yeah

(I've been through all of this before) I've been through all this before
(So how could you think) don't think about it, don't think about it
(That I would stand around and take some more) get gone, get gone
(Things are gonna change) things are gonna change, baby
('Cause I won't be your fool anymore) you don't stand no chance, boy
(That's why you have to leave) I said, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(So don't turn around to see my face) don't you turn around
There's no more tears left here for you to see

Was it really worth you goin' out like that? Tell me, boy
Was it really worth you goin' out like that?
See, I'm movin' on, and I refuse to turn back, yeah
See, all of this time, I thought I had somebody down for Whitney
It turns out, you were makin' a fool of me, oh

It's not right, but it's okay (it's not right, it's okay)
I'm gonna make it anyway (I'm gonna, I'm gonna, ah)
Pack your bags up and leave (close the door and leave your key)
And don't you dare come runnin' back to me (rather be alone than unhappy, oh)
It's not right, but it's okay (it's not right, it's okay, baby)
I'm gonna make it anyway (I can pay my own rent)
Close the door behind you, leave your key (pay my light bill, take care of my babies)
I'd rather be alone than unhappy (oh, oh, oh-whoa)
