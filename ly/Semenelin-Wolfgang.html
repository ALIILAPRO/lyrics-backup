		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On an uncharted isle
a group of ground diggers toil
to try to find what remains are lying
beneath the darkened soil

With their axes constantly pounding
and their shovels breaking through the ground
it was about daybreak when someone shouted
he had heard an awkward sound

Oh my! Here we've found something
what could it be
oh my, I can hear my heart pounding
it's the Nobel Prize for me

All went close to pay attention
to what it was that made them run
a piece of metal shone in the opening
with the rising sun

From under the ground
they saw it rise
no one knew what was coming
an ancient machine stood
before their eyes
if they only knew what they were doing

Tatooed across the monsters back
was one word written down in black
from origins unknown
where did it begin
the mighty behemoth

Semenelin...

At once, the military came
they were there to investigate
they sent soldiers in
to see what they could locate
hands quickly started to pry
levers were pulled, God knows why
turbines began to hum
the machine was on

It tore the ground beneath them
and created lava pools
an excellent burial
for this ship of sinking fools

Someone built it up to hold a mighty reign
over his steadfast domain
the world now shudders
in it's bulk
to the rotting hulk

As payment for our sins
to the mighty monarch

Semenelin..
