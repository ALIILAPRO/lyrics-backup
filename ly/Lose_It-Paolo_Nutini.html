		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take that wild rose thorn
In those steel crosshairs
That big fat bag
That's been sitting over there
Take those blue, blue memories
That you carry like a child
Take those heavy, heavy enemies
And just lose it for a little while

Lose it, lose it for a little while
Lose it, lose it for a little while
Lose it, lose it for a little while

I could not seem to find
A way out of my worried mind
Feeling I'd been left behind
Was bringing me down, down
January, made me shiver
Another year here to deliver
Another teardrop in the river
Was bringing me down, down, down
Since 179
Rolling
From you I get such a big, big feel
Such a big, big power
I kiss like I like green
Ready to rewind
Need to meet you now, shakin' hands
Makin' folly, making friends
On the path down from the sky
And just lose it for a little while

Lose it, lose it for a little while (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Lose it, lose it for a little while (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Lose it, lose it for a little while (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Lose it, lose it for a little while

I could not seem to find
A way out of my worried mind
Feeling I'd been left behind
Was bringing me down, down
January, made me shiver
Another year here to deliver
Another teardrop in the river
Was trickling down, down, down

Lose it, lose it for a little while
Lose it, lose it for a little while
Lose it, lose it for a little while
Lose it

Lose it for a little while

I could not seem to find
A way out of my worried mind
Feeling I'd been left behind
They were bringing me down, down, down
January, made me shiver
Another year here to deliver
But this year I'm going to be a forgiver
And I'm getting around, 'round, 'round

Lose it for a little while, lose it
Lose it for a little while, lose it
Let's just lose it for a little while (lose it)
Lose it for a little while
Lose it
Lose it (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Lose it for a little while, lose it (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Lose it
Lose it (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Lose it for a little while (yeah, yeah, yeah)

(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
