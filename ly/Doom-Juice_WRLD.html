		  (Daytrip took it to ten, hey)

No, I can't be fooled
I ain't playin' by your rules
I'm known to lose my cool, but that's cool
'Cause I'm known to be too cool
There's a room full of toxic people
But it feels like it's just me and her in the room
I'd rather me die before she
So I mix drugs up tryna find my doom

Tryna find my doom
Doom, doom
Tryna find my doom
Tryna find my doom
Doom, doom, doom

I have a lot of troubles
I admit I'm running from 'em
Walking through Hollywood
I admit, I'm astonished
So much has happened in the last few months
From broke to rich to finding love again
I said so much has happened in the last three months
More drugs to mix, so high I don't pick up the phone no mo'
New phone, who is this? Uh-oh
You got some nerve, dumb ho
Where were you before
I could pay your mortgage
Now all my shoes cost your car
Karma's a ugly bride
Yeah, she'll leave her scars

No, I can't be fooled
I ain't playin' by your rules
I'm known to lose my cool, but that's cool
'Cause I'm known to be too cool
There's a room full of toxic people
But it feels like it's just me and her in the room
I'd rather me die before she
So I mix drugs up tryna find my doom

Tryna find my doom
Doom, doom
Tryna find my doom
Tryna find my doom
Doom, doom, doom

Tryna find my tomb, ended up finding you
I assumed that you were gonna leave me overconsumed
Consumed, consumed, consumed
Yeah, I'm fucked up, yeah, but you already knew
What's your favorite color besides blue? You're always blue
You always been the one for me, you knew that too
Uh, fucked up, drunk driving on the avenue
Wrist hanging out the window, let the Rollie do what it do
Keep a all black four-nickel on me too
Fucked up, drunk driving on the avenue
Wrist hanging out the window, let the Rollie do what it do
Keep a all black four-nickel on me too, on me too

No, I can't be fooled
I ain't playing by your rules
I'm known to lose my cool, but that's cool
'Cause I'm known to be too cool
There's a room full of toxic people
But it feels like it's just me and her in the room
I'd rather me die before she
So I mix drugs up tryna find my doom

Tryna find my doom
Doom, doom (Daytrip took it to ten, hey)
Tryna find my doom
Tryna find my doom
Doom, doom, doom
