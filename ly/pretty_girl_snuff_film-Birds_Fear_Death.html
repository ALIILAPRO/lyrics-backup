		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They're laughing in the halls
Whispering behind the stage
There lays my body
Staring you in the face
Don't blush when I rip apart my skin
You know I look better
When you have full view of my ribs
I don't deserve to want to die
Sympathy's not for girls with cut up thighs
Spread my legs and tear open my chest
I don't want to be recognized
I write my note
We're not alone
Go out come home
And they all say
Kill yourself
