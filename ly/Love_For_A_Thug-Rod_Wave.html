		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is anybody out there? Uh (tell me)
Is anybody out there?
Look, look, look, uh

It's like I gave it all I got, but it it still wasn't enough
At times I sit and wonder, is it love for a thug?
Me and my partner poppin' Percocets, we'll trade 'em for a hug
A dosage of your love is all it takes to give it up
I made mistakes in my relationship, I admit I wasn't strong
But how another nigga bitch gon' tell me where I'm goin' wrong?
Your nigga sound like me and I sound like your nigga
So tell me what's the issue? Why you ain't in bed at home?
The stories that you tell about your lover sound too familiar
If he know what you did on your finsta, he'd try and kill you
Girl, I'm a real gangster, I ain't goin' for shit
Either we get it right or we can call it quits

Uh, and I know what I'm goin' through mean nothin' to you
I would've did it all for your love, but my all ain't enough
It's safe to say, but I'm givin' up
Is it anybody out there that got love for a thug?
Is it love for a thug?
Is it anybody out there that got love for a thug?
It's no love for a thug
Is it anybody out there that got love for a thug?
Tell me, is it love for a thug?
Is it anybody out there that got love for a thug?
It's no love for a thug
For a thug, yeah (you feel me?)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Is it anybody out there? (I need that old thing back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That thug love, that thug passion, you know what I'm saying?
That right or wrong, you know, forever rollin' and shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
Is it love for a thug? Is it love for a thug? (Always by my side)
Even though I'm a thug, baby, I need love
Is it anybody out there?

Grrah
