		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Shane:]
Took my hand
Touched my heart
Held me close
You were always there

By my side
Night and day
Through it all
Maybe come what may

Swept away on a wave of emotion
Overcaught in the eye of the storm
And whenever you smile
I can hardly believe that you´re mine
Believe that you´re mine

[All:]
This love is 
It´s unmistakeable
And each time I look in your eyes
I know why
This love is untouchable
I feel that my heart just can´t deny
Each time I look in your eyes
Oh baby, I know why
This love is unbreakable

[Bryan:]
Shared the laughter
Shared the tears
We both know
We´ll go on from here

Cause together we are strong
In my arms
That´s where you belong

I´ve been touched by the hands of an angel
I´ve been blessed by the power of love
And whenever you smile
I can hardly believe that you´re mine

[All:]
This love is unbreakable
It´s unmistakable
Each time I look in your eyes
I know why
This love is untouchable
I feel that my heart just can´t deny
Each time you whisper my name
Oh baby, I know why

[Mark:]
This love is unbreakable
Through fire and flame
When all this over
Our love still remains

[All:]
This love is unbreakable
It´s unmistakable
And each time I look in your eyes
I know why
This love is untouchable
I feel that my heart just can´t deny
Each time you whisper my name
Oh baby, I know why
Cause each time I look in your eyes
Oh baby, I know why

[Shane:]
This love is unbreakable
