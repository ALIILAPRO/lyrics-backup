		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I fear there's something wrong
I think I've seen this all before
The people here aren't sentient
On knees, they beg for more
Their hearts are tantalized
So is mine, without control
I say, just go ahead and pull me below
Go ahead and pull me below

I'm dancing on my own
I think I spun into your throne
Take me to my knees again
Corrupt my feeble soul
Your hands are kryptonite
Intertwined, without control
I say, just go ahead and pull me below
I said, go ahead and pull me below

I said, go ahead and pull me below
I said, go ahead and pull me below

I said, go ahead and pull me below
I said, go ahead and pull me below

I've never felt so powerless
In awe, girl you're sanctified
cdrenaline, and semen
Coursing through my body, I testify
My muscles, paralyzed
Regressed, I guess it sufficed
Though you never asked for the throne
Now we're peering up from below

I said, we're peering up from below

My heaven, I atone
There's a secret in your reservoir
It's something you're concealing
That my brazen base chose to ignore
But my weight has been stabilized
But soon I'll be galvanized
You never asked for the throne
But I said, go ahead and pull me below

I said, go ahead and pull me below
I said, go ahead and pull me below

I'm still the same, but I'm not who I was
Take what I am, and bestow me above
Let me invade your palace as I want
c cyclical being, a regression will come

With no roots to hold I've become so dependent
On the waters within your ravine
I felt complete
It recedes, but I felt complete

I step back towards the soil
Because I lost it all again
The surface of me
The surface of me
The surface of me
