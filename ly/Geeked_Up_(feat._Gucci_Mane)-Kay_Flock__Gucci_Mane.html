		  (OPM made a hit, nigga)
(Ayy, I pour me a six, now I'm geeked up, like)
(My shooters pull up in them Jeep trucks)
(We shoot at your gang, switch up, two lanes)
(Trackhawk, it can't keep up)
(We shoot at your gang, switch up, two lanes)
(Trackhawk, it can't keep up)

Ayy, I pour me a six, now I'm geeked up, like
My shooters pull up in them Jeep trucks
We shoot at your gang, switch up, two lanes
Trackhawk, it can not keep up
We shoot at your gang, switch up, two lanes
Trackhawk, it can not keep up
Ayy, I pour me a six, now I'm geeked up, like
My shooters pull up in them Jeep trucks
We shoot at your gang, switch up, two lanes
Trackhawk, it can not keep up
We shoot at your gang, switch up, two lanes
Trackhawk, it can not keep up

XD wit' the stick, attached to the beam, so I know I won't miss
Let him run, he get left like he Rick, bullets burn him, watch him twitch
Fuck a cab, he got left in a Lyft, how y'all all linkin' up for a hit?
And the Dub's and the T's to my dick, I'm tryna spin through, hangout the whip
Tryna hit a goofy in his shit, one got hit in his back and he tripped
And the other one almost went out like a bitch
I was prayin ' to God, make him slip
I'm tryna slide on the Stoley
Let him run, I'ma give him this, brodie
Don't even show, I could do this shit dollie
Fuck if I'm rich, I'ma still take his rolly
Rip Naz', yeah, I blaze with a croney
He get got, he get killed what he owe me
He get shot, give a fuck what he told me
Shoot like I'm Curry, I know they can't hold me

Ayy, I pour me a six, now I'm geeked up, like
My shooters pull up in them Jeep trucks
We shoot at your gang, switch up, two lanes
Trackhawk, it can not keep up
We shoot at your gang, switch up, two lanes
Trackhawk, it can not keep up
Ayy, I pour me a six, now I'm geeked up, like
My shooters pull up in them Jeep trucks
We shoot at your gang, switch up, two lanes
Trackhawk, it can not keep up (it's Gucci)
We shoot at your gang, switch up, two lanes
Trackhawk, it can't keep up (go)

NYC to the A, niggas get shot everyday (baow, baow)
They find out where you stay and they gon' come where you lay (come to the crib)
Me and my gang don't play, got soldiers on watch with the K
You pussies better watch what you say and snitches better stay out the way (stay out my face)
I put an opp in his place, like botox, shot in the face (got shot in the what?)
Thought he was runnin' the race, but now he just runnin' in place (can't even run)
I got bodies like a drill rapper, I ain't cappin', I'm a real rapper
Even before I had a deal, ask 'em, Gucci labeled as a real trapper ('Wop)
Gucci and Kay Flock, leavin' it cold
But the Glock on my hip, yeah, it stay hot (brr)
Try to put the Wraith out, but he got the race shot
And 12 on my block tryna stakeout (damn)
Let my nigga shake out, got him on max
And I know he gettin' mad, wanna break out (damn)
Walkin' with a shake out, blow up your tank-top
Stay out the top, knock your brains out (ugh)
Money all I think of, but a nigga dream 'bout
Went from a jail to a dream house
Started from the trap house AKA the scrap house
I was so many Ps, it's a green house
AKA the codeine house
Hundred pints in, so we called it the lean house (lean)
Gucci Mane, yeah, I'm the king now
Used to be the plug, but now he just a fiend now (Gucci)

Ayy, I pour me a six, now I'm geeked up, like
My shooters pull up in them Jeep trucks
We shoot at your gang, switch up, two lanes
Trackhawk, it can not keep up
We shoot at your gang, switch up, two lanes
Trackhawk, it can't keep up
