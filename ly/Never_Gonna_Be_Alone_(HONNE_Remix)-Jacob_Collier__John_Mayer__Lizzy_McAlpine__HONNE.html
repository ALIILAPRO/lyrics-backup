		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a patch of sunlight in my room
On the carpet where I held you for a moment in June
There was something so sweet about it, never been so unguarded
And it made me fall for you

There's a tree that looks up at the moon
In the garden, where I held you for a moment in the gloom
There was something so sweet about it, I'm holding onto this moment
'Cause it made me fall for you
Made me fall for you

Take me back to the window, take me back to the door
You'll be right where I left you sittin' on the floor
Now I'm never gonna be alone, mm, mm
Take me back to the window, take me back to the door
You'll be right where I left you sittin' on the floor
Now I'm never gonna be alone

And I know, I know
There's so much I want to say to you
Even though I know
Nothing's gonna change
But I'll always find my way back here to you

Take me back to the window, take me back to the door
You'll be right where I left you sittin' on the floor
Now I'm never gonna be alone
(Never gonna be alone, never gonna be alone, be alone, be alone)
Take me back to the window, take me back to the door
You'll be right where I left you sittin' on the floor
Now I'm never gonna be alone (be alone)

There's a patch of sunlight in my room
On the carpet where I held you for a moment
