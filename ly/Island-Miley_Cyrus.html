		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm on an island, dirty dancing in the sun
So close to heaven but so far from everyone
Yeah, I've got treasures buried underneath the sand
But I'm still wishing for the love that I don't have

Mama told me, "Girl, smoke 'em if you got 'em"
Left my lighter back at home with all my problems
So I'm sitting here, wondering all day long

Am I stranded on an island?
Or have I landed in paradise?
Am I stranded on an island?
Or have I landed in paradise?

I can paint my toenails while I'm soaking up the sea
The only thing that's missing here is you and our TV
And I won't lie, it sure gets lonely here at night
But no one here needs nothing from me and it's kind of nice

Mama told me, "Girl, smoke 'em if you got 'em"
Left my lighter back at home with all my problems
So I'm sitting here, wondering all day long

Am I stranded on an island?
Or have I landed in paradise?
Am I stranded on an island?
Or have I landed in paradise?

I hear your voice like a song on the radio
All day long 'cause, boy, I be missing ya
I hear your voice like a song on the radio, ah
I hear your voice like a song on the radio (paradise)
All day long 'cause, boy, I be missing ya
I hear your voice like a song on the radio, ah (paradise)

Am I stranded on an island?
Or have I landed in paradise?
Am I stranded on an island?
Or have I landed in paradise?

Am I stranded on an island? (I hear your voice like a song on the radio)
(All day long 'cause, boy, I be missing you)
Or have I landed in paradise? (I hear your voice like a song on the radio, ah)

Am I stranded on an island? (I hear your voice like a song on the radio)
(All day long 'cause, boy, I be missing you)
Or have I landed in paradise? (I hear your voice like a song on the radio, ah)

Am I stranded on an island? (I hear your voice like a song on the radio)
(All day long 'cause, boy, I be missing you)
Or have I landed in paradise? (I hear your voice like a song on the radio, ah)

Am I stranded on an island?
Or have I landed-
