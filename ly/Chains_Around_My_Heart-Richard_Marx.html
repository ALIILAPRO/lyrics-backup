		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Out of my sight
But the vision is still the same
Out of my mind
But the memory remains unchanged
Stones thrown in anger hold twice the hurt
Return to sender could only make things worse

[Chorus]
Girl, you've got to break these chains around my heart
Cause I've been lonely too long
You've got to break these chains around my heart
So I can finally get on with my life

Don't ask me why
Why I've lived with this all alone
Locked up inside
And it's cutting me to the bone
Love is a stranger avoiding me
Beware of danger's the only sign I see

[Chorus]

Are you listening
Is there something that you'd like to say
Am I getting through
Are you just gonna leave me this way

Girl you've got to break these chains around my heart
Before it tears me in two
You've got to break these chains around my heart
That's all I am asking of you
You've got to break these chains around my heart
Cause I've been lonely too long
You've got to break these chains around my heart
So I can finally get on with my life
