		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah I know, whoa
You be posted up from Sunday to Saturday night
Started hanging with the members then you blew a few pipes
And you gon' do the dash if you see them blue lights
A lot of people doubtin' and it's a chance that you might
You got God on your side but it's hard to do right
Don't pay them haters no mind, you can be what you like
Tryna leave this in the past grinding for a new life

Hard headed I grew up resilient
It wasn't no hero so we look up to the villains
For generations bitch my side of town been drilling
We been at war ever since them red buildings
It's hard to make peace once blood get to spilling aye
Lil wooski get to shooting like he filming
Yeah my friends died too I know that feeling
I'm popping ecstasy to help me with the healing
Leah and lil baby my younger siblings
I really love them so I treat em' like my children
Laylani told me stack them bands to the ceiling
I switch my swag up can't you tell the difference
I'm finna feed the whole gang with these millions
I'm finna buy my whole hood with these millions
Girl if I give you my time that's a prilvage
But I can only give my heart to the realest

Yeah I know, whoa
You be posted up from Sunday to Saturday night
Started hanging with the members then you blew a few pipes
And you gon' do the dash if you see them blue lights
A lot of people doubtin' and it's a chance that you might
You got God on your side but it's hard to do right
Don't pay them haters no mind, you can be what you like
Tryna leave this in the past, grinding for a new life

Lately I've been feeling like fuck the street this shit a scam
These days if it ain't 'bout money I don't give a damn
I'm just gone get rich and fuck them plastic hoes on instagram
Still with the gang tho one false move them killers blam
Still on that same block for those who say that look for me
I ain't sacrifice the shit I lost it was took from me
Almost went insane, went insane, went insane, from all this pain, all this pain, all this pain
Turned that pain into passion and made it happen
Shout out to the ones who doubted me, they keep me laughing
Sippin' on this codeine got me relaxing
She say she like how I be swaggin' she love my fashion
Vvs my diamonds my jewelry flashin' drip so hard I make puddles, bitch, my Gucci splashin'
Fresh the death like my closet in a casket
Fresh the death like my closet in a casket

Yeah I know, whoa
You be posted up from Sunday to Saturday night
Started hanging with the members then you blew a few pipes
And you gon' do the dash if you see them blue lights
A lot of people doubtin' and it's a chance that you might
You got God on your side but it's hard to do right
Don't pay them haters no mind, you can be what you like
Tryna leave this in the past, grinding for a new life
Ay, grinding for a new life, grinding for a new life
Grinding for a new life, ay
