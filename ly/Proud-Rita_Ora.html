		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Roomie, feelin' so free
Scream it from the top of your lungs, lungs
They acceptin', it's a blessin'
It feels so right can never be wrong, wrong, oh
You're walking tall and now you found your freedom
Don't break your spirit now you've got that feeling
Stand up to the whole world
Feeling like you finally found home

Can't be quiet, no
Can't deny, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

You make me proud
I wanna tell the world about you now
You know it's you that I love, you that I love, oh
So let me say it loud, loud
No I swear I'll never let them bring you down
You know it's you that I love, you that I love, oh

Stand out in the whole crowd
Shinin' now you found your true glow, glow, oh
No doubt, do your mama proud
Now you're finally taking control, -trol, oh
Not afraid to celebrate who we are
Got what it takes, they'll never break you down, na, na
No doubt, baby, stand proud
Now you're finally taking control, oh yeah

Can't be quiet, no
Can't deny, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

You make me proud
I wanna tell the world about you now
You know it's you that I love, you that I love, oh
So let me say it loud, loud
No I swear never let them bring you down
You know it's you that I love, you that I love, oh

Boy, you're beautiful, you're looking so good, so good
Kisses to your haters like you love them so good
In your own lane, baby, focus, all good, yeah
Go ahead beautiful, you're looking so good, so good
Kisses to your haters like you love them so good
In your own lane, it's time to get 'em
Pedal to the floor, it's time to get 'em
They never take your shine so don't you let 'em
No, no, no, no, no, no

You make me proud
I wanna tell the world about you now
You know it's you that I love, you that I love, oh
So let me say it loud, loud
No I swear I'll never let them bring you down
You know it's you that I love, you that I love, oh
