		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hard to take.
The day you just can catch a break.
When it brings me down, I get right back up.
'Cause I'm powerful.
Incredible.
Independent girl ready for the world, world, world.

Come on.
Tonight I'm unstoppable.
Incredibly strong.
Tonight I'm unstoppable.
The world is calling me out, out, out.
Don't wanna whisper.
Wanna shout, shout.
Come on.
You know I'm unstoppable.

Get out. Get out.
Get out of your head.
Get out. Get out.
And live instead.
Get out. Get out.
Get out alright.

Come on.
Tonight I'm unstoppable.
Incredibly strong.
Tonight I'm unstoppable.
The world is calling me out, out, out.
Don't wanna whisper.
Wanna shout, shout.
Come on.
You know I'm unstoppable.
