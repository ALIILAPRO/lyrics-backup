		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't get me mad
I'm lucid dreaming everything I've never had
Guess who
I’m scheming scheming
Don’t get me mad
I’m lucid dreaming everything I’ve never had
All I do is win and give them heart attacks
Every girl I wanted always want me back
Oh me oh my
I feel alive up in the suicide
Need I remind them to find the time to put in the grind
I swear these bitches could swallow pills but can’t swallow pride
Red Rover NoVA they over there on the other side
Left, right
Checks pile now
Upset
Why they always
Try to reconcile and make
Amends
I can not pretend
And I ain’t down to make new friends
I think I’d rather pull up in the Benz
My shooting stars turned out to be crashing planes
Yeah
They want you to grow just to say that you’ve changed
Changed
That’s why I’m always
Scheming scheming (with my homies)
Don’t get me mad (you don't know me)
I’m lucid dreaming everything I’ve never had (never never)
All I do is win and give them heart attacks (heart attacks)
And every girl I wanted always want me back (want me back)
I don’t make assumptions
I just do my thing and I could give a fuck about opinions
(Fuck 'em fuck 'em yeah)
Hamash sare karam tarafdaram daram
[I’m always at work and I have fans now]
Now it’s feeling like my time is imminent
(Blowing up)
Shorty hit my line I hit decline and then she text me
Asking why we’re never intimate
(Show no love)
Money on my mind
That’s why I never sit reclined
When all these problems always coming from the
Left, right
Checks pile now
Upset
Why they always try to reconcile
And make amends
I can not pretend and I ain’t down to make new friends
I think I’d rather pull up in the Benz
With my homies
You don’t know me
Never never
Ramtin
That’s why I’m always
Scheming scheming
Don’t get me mad
I’m lucid dreaming everything I’ve never had (never never)
All I do is win and give them heart attacks (heart attacks)
And every girl I wanted always want me back
