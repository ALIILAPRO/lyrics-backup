		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We were talkin' without words and turnin' red
All tangled up in knots
And I got lost in the thoughts that I had 
While I'm lyin' in this bed
And I don't wanna leave
You look so lovely runnin' through my head
I know I came undone a bit
My tongue, it went numb
And I choked when I should've spoke instead
I tell myself

Believe me, you're not in love
Been lookin' for a reason but there isn't one
Go easy, it's like a drug
Oh, I'm high off your love

Starin' at the ceiling and I'm burnin' up
Lookin' for a reason you ain't good enough
Now I'm in a feelin' and it's like a drug
Oh, I'm high off your love
Starin' at the ceiling and I'm givin' up
You're the missing pieces I've been dreamin' of
Now I'm in a feelin' and it's like a drug
Oh, I'm high off your love

I won't trip out on the past because it's gone
It's just that this is new and yeah, it's true
Only knew 'I love you's when I heard 'em in a song
I tell myself

Believe me, you're not in love
Been lookin' for a reason but there isn't one
Go easy, it's like a drug
Oh, I'm high off your love

Starin' at the ceiling and I'm burnin' up
Lookin' for a reason you ain't good enough
Now I'm in a feelin' and it's like a drug
Oh, I'm high off your love
Starin' at the ceiling and I'm givin' up
You're the missing pieces I've been dreamin' of
Now I'm in a feelin' and it's like a drug (like a drug)
Oh, I'm high off your love

Believe me, you're not in love
Been lookin' for a reason but there isn't one
Go easy, it's like a drug
Oh, I'm high off your love

Starin' at the ceiling and I'm burnin' up
I'm lookin' for a reason you ain't good enough
Now I'm in a feelin' and it's like a drug (like a drug, like a drug)
Oh, I'm high off your love
Starin' at the ceiling and I'm givin' up (I'm givin' up)
You're the missing pieces I've been dreamin' of
Now I'm in a feelin' and it's like a drug (it's like a drug)
Oh, I'm high off your love
Oh, I'm high off your love
