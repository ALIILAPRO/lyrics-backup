		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm lost in a world that rattles my brain
I'm cleaning up my life from the mess you made
Oh o, Woah oh-oh o
My soul's in dept but my bills are payed
I'd give anything just to make an escape
Oh-oh o, Woah oh-oh o

So you can keep knockin', knockin', knockin'
Baby you're knockin'
But there ain't no way I'm ever letting you in
Not again
So keep on knockin', knockin', knockin'
But baby you're better off walking
'Cause I ain't gonna let you in
Never again, no not again

So, so long honey there's no debate
We lived in a dream then faced to fate
Oh o, Woah oh-oh o
And I'm scared to engage so I stare at the stage
And poor out my heart to the blank of a page
Oh o, Woah oh-oh o

Ah ah ah

So you can keep knockin', knockin', knockin'
Baby you're knockin'
But there ain't no way I'm ever letting you in
Not again
So keep on knockin', knockin', knockin'
But baby you're better off walking
'Cause I ain't gonna let you in
Never again, no not again

I went out on a limb again
I guess I had to lose to win
I was too confused to know which way to turn
And she could be a millionare
Be a model I don't care
'Cause baby there's nobody home
Nobody's home, yeah

So you can keep knockin', knockin', knockin'
Baby you're knockin'
But there ain't no way I'm ever letting you in
Not again
So keep on knockin', knockin', knockin'
But baby you're better off walking
'Cause I ain't gonna let you in
Never again, no not again
