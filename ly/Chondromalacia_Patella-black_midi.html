		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Losing grip
Another drip
A new cold

Air passing through a new hole 
On the white rocks of the pink mould
Air passing through a new hole 
On the white rocks of the pink mould

No strength left
To pull the cord
Of the morning bell

A million diamonds sing inside an empty shell
A million diamonds sing
A million diamonds

I don't know why I thought so

Always crashing, screaming
Relentlessly bashing
Incessant, repulsive, backtracking hypotheses

And the seldom finished
Oh, the beasts of the nighttime
Canfrenkin borentis a sotzkee, potzkee borree

My fingertips folding
Deep in their burrows black creatures make nests 
No needle can rupture

My fingertips folding
Deep in their burrows black creatures make nests 
No needle can rupture
