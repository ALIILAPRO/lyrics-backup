		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In your eyes
I see the hurt that you're not telling me tonight
And you're not sure if you still have the fight
To make it through this darkness
To heal this broken heart
That keeps you far from home

Let me save you, let me take you
To a place where you can breathe again
A place where you can smile
Let me save you, let me take you
To a place where all the tears will end
And you won't have to hide

When the waves start crashing down
And the world just gets too loud
When you're reaching out
I'll never let you drown
When the storms don't seem to end
I'll be there to pull you in
When you're reaching out
I'll never let you drown

I'll never let you drown

When you're reaching out
I'll never let you drown
I'll never let you drown

Call my name
When you feel lost or just too far away
Hold on tight, in my arms you'll be safe
Until the blue sky's breaking
And all of your hurt starts fading
I'm not letting go

Let me save you, let me take you
To a place where you can breathe again
A place where you can smile
Let me save you, let me take you
To a place where all the tears will end
And you won't have to hide

When the waves start crashing down
And the world just gets too loud
When you're reaching out
I'll never let you drown
When the storms don't seem to end
I'll be there to pull you in
When you're reaching out
I'll never let you drown

Oh, oh
When you're reaching out
I'll never let you drown
Oh, oh
When you're reaching out
I won't let you drown
I won't let you drown
When you're reaching out
I'll never let you drown

(I'll never let you drown)
