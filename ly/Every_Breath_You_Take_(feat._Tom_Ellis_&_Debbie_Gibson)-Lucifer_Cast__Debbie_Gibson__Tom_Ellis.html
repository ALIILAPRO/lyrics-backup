		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every breath you take
And every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take
I'll be watching you

Every single day
And every word I say
Every game I play
Every night I stay
He'll be watching me

Oh can't you see
You belong to me?
How my poor heart aches 
With every step you take

Every move you make (every move I make)
Every vow you break (every vow I break)
Every smile I fake
Every claim I stake
He'll be watching you (I'll be watching you)

Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night, I can only see your face
I look around but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold, and I long for your embrace
I keep crying baby, baby, please

I'll be watching you

Every breath I take
Every move I make
Every bond I break
Every step I take (I'll be watching you)

Every single day
Every word I say
Every game I play
Every night I stay (I'll be watching you)

Every single day
Every word I say
Every game I play
He'll be watching me
