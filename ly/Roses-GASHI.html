		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, ooh, oh
Yeah

She's like a renegade in my head, that what she is
And she's sleeping all in my bed, that where she left
She likes fighting with the gloves off
Every single night, she only fuck me with the right song
She's like a melody in my head, that's what she is

I know I lie, yes, I know I lie
I saw you cry, I just wanna die
I'll make it right, yes, I'll make it right
With tulips 'cause she don't like roses

Feeling like I'm running in my head
But she don't like roses

I got a girl up in Palisades, that where she lives
And she hit me up like everyday, she know what it is
She likes to love with the lights on
And when I leave her in the morning
I regret it, it feels so wrong
'Cause I got you all in my head, that's where you live

I know I lie, yes, I know I lie
I saw you cry, I just wanna die (die)
I'll make it right, yes, I'll make it right
With tulips 'cause she don't like roses

Feeling like I'm running in my head
'Cause she don't like roses
Driving down Malibu
I remember picking you up from school
We were just teens, everything was cool
Yeah, I miss that (yeah)

Oops, I did it again
I just fucked on your friend in the back of my Benz
Oops, I did it again
Use tulips to make amends
'Cause she don't like roses (yeah)

Feeling like I'm running in my head (she don't like it)
She don't like roses
Driving down Malibu
I remember picking you up from school
We were just teens, everything was cool
Yeah, I miss that (yeah)
But she don't like roses
