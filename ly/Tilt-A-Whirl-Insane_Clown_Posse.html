		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Welcome to the tilt-a-whirl 
All you mutha fuckas are gonna die 

Everybody! You're dying everyday, constantly 
I'll kill myself right mutha fuckin' now 
And still won't die (try me) 
Wicked clowns never (never) die, whut 

Oh my goody look a chicken 
Keep your money here's a ticket 
Hold up keep your kids out here 
They too young to play in there 
Step right up now strap 'em in 
Lock it tight under his chin 
Clamp his arms up to his side 
It's gon' be a helly ride 
Now if you misplace an item 
Psychopathic straight up find 'em 
If you lose your nugget yo 
Hatchet ain't responsible 
Look and wonder if you will 
'Cause we about to rip and kill 
Think about your every sin 
As our tilt-a-whirly spins 

[Chorus: x2] 
They all die die 

Looky look a fancy fuck 
With his wallet up his butt 
Give the wealthy what they want 
Fuck the line put him up front 
Welcome to our spectacle 
Carny rides eccentrical 
Hope you like it even though 
Hafta mingle with the poor 
Here you go sir have a seat 
You've got to take this ride, it's neat 
Tell ya now the ride is fast 
Might want me to hold your cash 
We gonna spin until your soul 
Leaves your body dead and cold 
Tilt-a-whirly sprayin' blood 
All over the neighborhood 

[Chorus: x2] 

Get up on it get up on it get up on it, get on 
Get up on it get up on it get up on it, wheee 
Get up on it get up on it get up on it, get on 
Get up on it get up on it get up on it, ride 
Get up on it get up on it get up on it, get on 
Get up on it get up on it get up on it, *squeak* 
Get up on it get up on it get up on it, ride 

(Violent J, and Shaggy 2 Dope) 
Welcome buddy, what you did 
Like to punch up on your kids 
Scoot all them dead bodies down 
We can go another round 
Excuse us while we clean up here 
Pile them up on over there 
Strap 'em up then start the show 
This time speed it up some more 
Tell me any last requests 
Before your guts rip out your chest 
Fuck all that don't give 'em nothin' 
Slap his ass and press the button 
Fair enough now another down 
Carnival don't fuck around 
Fire up the tilt-a-whirl 
And we'll see you all in hell 

[Chorus: x2] 

Round and round and round you go 

Yo, the dark carnival will never die. 
I mean that's all we do is think about dyin'. 
We wish we die, we hope we die. 
The only problem is, 
We ain't never ever ever gonna die motherfucker! 

[Chorus]
