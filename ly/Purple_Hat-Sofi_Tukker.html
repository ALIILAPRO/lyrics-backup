		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Purple hat, cheetah print
Dancing on the people
Rolled up at the after joint
Dancing, dancing on the people, people
Dancing on the people
I got people on the people, people
Dancing on the people
With the people on the people
Smoking co2
See me see you dancing on the people
Climb up on the booth
Hanging from the people on the people
My head hits the roof
Dancing on the ceiling on the people
I got people on the people
Dancing, dancing on the people

I got purple hat, cheetah print
Dancing on the people
Rolled up at the after joint
Dancing, dancing on the people, people
Dancing on the people
I got people on the people, people
Dancing on the people
With the people on the people
Smoking co2
See me see you dancing on the people
Climb up on the booth
Hanging from the people on the people
My head hits the roof
Dancing on the ceiling on the people
I got people on the (oh)
Dancing on the people
I got people

People
People
People, people
Dancing on the people
I got

Everybody in the booth
Can tell myself apart from you (dancing on the people)
Now that we're dancing people (I got people, people)
Dancing people (people)
Dancing people (people, people)
Dancing people

Well I got purple hat, cheetah print
Dancing on the people
Rolled up at the after joint
Dancing, dancing on the people, people
Dancing on the people
I got people on the people, people
Dancing on the people
With the people on the people
Smoking co2
See me see you dancing on the people
Climb up on the booth
Hanging from the people on the people
My head hits the roof
Dancing on the ceiling on the people
I got people on the people
Dancing, dancing on the people
I got

Dancing people
I got people
People, people
Dancing, dancing on me

Everybody in the booth
Can tell myself apart from you
Now that we're dancing people
Dancing people
Dancing people
Dancing people (dancing on the people, I got)
Dancing people
Dancing people
Dancing people
Dancing people (dancing on the people, I got)

Purple hat, cheetah print
Dancing on the people
Rolled up at the after joint
Dancing, dancing on the people, people
Dancing on the people
I got people on the people, people
Dancing on the people
With the people on the (woo)
