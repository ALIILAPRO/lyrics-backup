		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fellow armsmen, I ask you
Will you follow me tonight to break their spine
And reclaim what once was mine?
Those cravens

Backstabbed me, deceived me
Never shall I tolerate their crimes again
Now let the hunt begin

7000 souls, scared and daunted, such tale of woe
Not too long ago, this village was a golden scene of hope

Call down the reckoning
To bring back hope and peace
Restore our gloria
To live forever

Bring down the dark regime
I know how to unleash eternal power
Lead us to order
I am the lightbringer
I am the lightbringer

Now listen, fellow warriors, I ask you
Should my campaign come to an end?
There's way more to avenge

15 million souls
Living in this realm without much hope
Not too long ago, this kingdom was a golden state of hope

Call down the reckoning
To bring back hope and peace
Restore our gloria
To live forever

Bring down the dark regime
I know how to unleash eternal power
Lead us to order
I am the lightbringer

Call down the reckoning
Bring back hope and peace
Restore our gloria
To live forever

Call down the reckoning
To bring back hope and peace
Restore our gloria
To live forever

Bring down the dark regime
I know how to unleash eternal power
Lead us to order
I am the lightbringer
