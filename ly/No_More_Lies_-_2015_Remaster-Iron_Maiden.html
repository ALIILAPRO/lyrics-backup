		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a darkening sky before me 
There's no time to prepare 
Salvage a last horizon 
But no regrets from me 

Maybe I'll be back some other day 
To live again just who can say 
In what shape or form that I might be 
Just another chance for me 

A hurried time, no disgrace 
Instead of racing to conclusion 
Wishing all my life away 
No one can stop me now 

Time is up, it couldn't last 
But there's more things I'd like to do 
I'm coming back to try again 
Someday maybe I'll wait 'til then 

No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies

They're all sitting at my table 
Talking tall and drinking wine 
Their time is up just like me 
But they just don't know it yet 

So just a word of warning 
When you're in your deepest dreams
There's nothing you can hide from 
I've got my eye on you 

The clock is fast, the hour is near 
Eventful past is ever clear 
My life is set, the time is here 
I think I'm coming home 

No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies

A hurried time, no disgrace 
Instead of racing to conclusions 
Wishing all your life away 
No one can stop me now 

Time is up, it couldn't last 
But there's more things I have to do 
I'm coming back to try again 
Don't tell me that this is the end

No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
