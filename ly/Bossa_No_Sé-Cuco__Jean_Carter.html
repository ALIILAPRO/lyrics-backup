		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't play with me 
You broke my heart 
But I'm also so obsessed with you 
I don't know if I love you 
I don't know if I hate you 
Baby it's time to 
Get out my way 
Get out my life 
I'm so sick of you just playing games 
I'm pretty sure I hate you 
I'm pretty sure I love you 

After all of this commotion and the bullshit that you did 
Cut my body in to pieces and just throw me off a bridge 
I think its fair to say 
That I'm going insane 
More broken day by day 
Why won't you go away 
You say you hate me but you stay banging my line 
Why do you want to break my heart and love me at the same time 
Stupid bitch you came from hell and made me lose my fucking mind 
What did I do to deserve this you just gave me a hard time

They hit me up and told me 
That you were with my homie 
How could you ever help me 
I never been so lonely 
Can't take you back oh no no 
Think that it's time to go go 
You left me all on my own 

Don't play with me 
You broke my heart 
But I'm also so obsessed with you 
I don't know if I love you 
I don't know if I hate you 
Baby it's time to 
Get out my way 
Get out my life 
I'm so sick of you just playing games 
I'm pretty sure I hate you 
I'm pretty sure I love you 

You gon' make me take my passion put it to the side 
You was a lady I loved but you ruined my life 
But you was so pretty that I'd even put up a fight 
But you was so petty and I just knew it weren't right 
I been seeing shit in HD 
All of this shit it just ain't me 
You been saying that you hate me 
Then taking it back and can't face me 
I roll a blunt just to face it 
And put the bullshit at the side 
Made a rollercoaster out my mattress 
How you take a nigga for a fuckin' ride? 
For tryna' put it in the past saying it's old news 
Can't stand the thought of your ass 
Deleted your old nudes 
Made sure you was all where you want to be when the cold bloom 
I think of the time that we spent it leave me feeling so foolish, so foolish

For tryna' put it in the past saying that it's old news 
Can't stand the thought of your ass 
Deleted your old nudes 
Made sure you was all where you want to be when the cold bloom 
I think of the time that we spent it leave me feeling so foolish, so foolish 

Don't play with me 
You broke my heart 
But I'm also so obsessed with you 
I don't know if I love you 
I don't know if I hate you 
Baby it's time to 
Get out my way 
Get out my life 
I'm so sick of you just playing games 
I'm pretty sure I hate you 
I'm pretty sure I love you
