		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know where I'm at
I'm standing at the back
And I'm tired of waiting
Waiting here in line
Hoping that I'll find what I've been chasing

I shot for the sky
I'm stuck on the ground
So why do I try, I know I'm gonna to fall down
I thought I could fly, so why did I drown?
Never know why it's coming down, down, down

Not ready to let go
'Cause then I'd never know
What I could be missing
But I'm missing way too much
So when do I give up what I've been wishing for?

I shot for the sky
I'm stuck on the ground
So why do I try, I know I'm gonna to fall down
I thought I could fly, so why did I drown?
Never know why it's coming down, down, down
Oh I am going down, down, down
Can't find another way around
And I don't want to hear the sound
Of losing what I never found

I shot for the sky
I'm stuck on the ground
So why do I try, I know I'm gonna to fall down
I thought I could fly, so why did I drown?
I never know why it's coming down, down, down

I shot for the sky
I'm stuck on the ground
So why do I try, I know I'm gonna to fall down
I thought I could fly, so why did I drown?
Oh it's coming down, down, down
