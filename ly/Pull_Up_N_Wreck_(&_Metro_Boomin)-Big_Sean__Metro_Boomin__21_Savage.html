		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Southside
Pull up and wreck (yeah), pull up and
If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you

Pull up with the spark, hit you in the dark (Woah)
Tear your ass apart when you swim with sharks
I'm in the car like Tony Starks 'cause I'm that smart (Skrrt)
Doing 106 then Park like I'm in my yard (Sideways)
And motherfuck the camera time, I need family time (Yeah)
I need "go see Uncle John in Atlanta" time (John)
I'll probably never get it, but it's cool to fantasize (It's cool)
Just like I do by old girl and these hands of mine (Woah)
Gripping on the titties, ass, and her thighs (Oh yeah)
Honestly, I'm over her and her lies
Cartier over my eyes while I analyze (I put the work in, they can't take that away)
Ok, me and Lil' Metro, rockin' new retros
Take off your dress, that's the new dress code
Too blessed to stress, that's my manifesto (Bless)
Fuck the professor, I'm too professional

I know some East Side niggas and they love to bang
Know some West Side niggas like to do the same thing
And they pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck yeah
Pull up and wreck yeah, pull up and wreck
I know some East Side niggas and they love to bang
Know some West Side niggas like to the same thing
Like, pull up and wreck yeah, pull up and wreck yeah
Pull up and wreck, we take no disrespect

I ain't taking disrespect, lil' nigga (Straight up)
Put a couple holes in your neck, lil' nigga (God)
Fuck a diss song, get you stretched, lil' nigga (21)
Got a shoe string 'round my TEC, lil' nigga (Facts)
Got a Mulsanne and a Vet, lil' nigga (21)
Brand new Carbon one-five and it's red, dawg (21)
I ain't tryna fuck you, I just want some head, dawg (Ye)
Straight up out the Six and we don't shoot at legs, dawg (Ay)
Zone 6 niggas love to see the white meat (21)
I put Codeine all in my ice tea (Red)
Take a nigga bitch and then I make her wifey (Ye)
Take a nigga bitch and then we do the nasty (Yeah)
All these diamonds dripping, now she wanna bite me (Facts)
She broke up with that nigga now he wanna fight me (Ha)
Fox 5 Gang, we don't do no fighting (Gang)
This Glock gon' knock a nigga down like Tyson (Gang, gang)

I know some East Side niggas and they love to bang
Know some West Side niggas like to do the same thing
And they pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck yeah
Pull up and wreck yeah, pull up and wreck
I know some East Side niggas and they love to bang
Know some West Side niggas like to the same thing
Like, pull up and wreck yeah, pull up and wreck yeah
Pull up and wreck, we take no disrespect (Disrespect)

How a nigga changed and still stayed a hundred? (Huh)
I ran towards change while y'all ran from it (Woh)
Y'all wanna ball, I'm Stan Van Gundy
She wanna hang with me and 'Ye, she know that's good company
I like my skies Carolina blue and white
True one, false move and that could paralyze your life (Brr)
So understand, I'm the overanalyzing type (Type)
Panoramic views while I'm panning out my life (Look up, look up)
And I grew up playing GoldenEye (Damn)
So I'm used to sticking to the mission while they taking shots
When you this high, you disconnect a lot (Yeah)
Sometimes I separate myself to connect the dots (I do)
Only way I'm back is going back home (Home)
I don't drink tap water, but got tap phones (Brr)
Dior on my suit, I'm a troop
Money come around, I'm never out the loop (Loop)
Kiss the bottom of my boot (Yeah, yeah)

I know some East Side niggas and they love to bang
Know some West Side niggas like to do the same thing
And they pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck yeah
Pull up and wreck yeah, pull up and wreck
I know some East Side niggas and they love to bang
Know some West Side niggas like to the same thing
Like, pull up and wreck yeah, pull up and wreck yeah
Pull up and wreck, we take no disrespect

I'm talking FN's and TEC's
Rollies, Pateks
I heard that you snitch
You got police on text
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
Pull up and wreck, we take no disrespect
Southside
If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you
