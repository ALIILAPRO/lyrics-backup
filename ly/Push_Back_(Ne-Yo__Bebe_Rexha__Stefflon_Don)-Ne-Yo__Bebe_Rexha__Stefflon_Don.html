		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say mi whine up the ting 'til it pile up
Big bumper, girl, just a whine and it wile up
Dem a squad, me never stop 'til it pile up
Mind enough so it might

You dance like you mean it, yeah
Dance like you on fire and ya want me to know
You move like you mean it, shawty, see the look on your face
You either wanna fight or wanna make love, maybe both, oh

You got me looking at you, looking at you, watching
The way you wind it and pop it
One more time, girl, wind and pop it, yeah, yeah
Oh, but that drink got me feeling alright
Pretty little thing, I could watch it all night
Pull up on that bumper, girl, I just might
Pull up on that bumper, girl, I just might

Baby, push back when I jump behind it, when I jump behind it
So when I jump behind it, push back on me
So baby, push back when I jump behind it
Baby, let me know you like it
Tonight, let's give 'em something to see

Everybody singing, oh, oh, oh, oh (ayy)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (now)
Everybody singing, oh, oh, oh, oh (ayy)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (now)

Said, I want you to mean it, yeah
You got me on fire, baby, I smell the smoke
Come on, grab me by the waist and love me real hard
Baby, looking at me crazy, take me to the bar
Couple shots, no chaser
My booty amazing
Come on, baby, chase it
Back to the flock, give her space and

You're looking at me, looking at me, watching
The way I wind it and pop it
One more time, I wind it and pop it, yeah
Baby, that drink got me feeling alright
Pretty little thing, you can watch me all night
Pull up on this bumper, boy, I don't mind
Pull up on this bumper, boy, I don't mind

Baby, push back when I jump behind it, when I jump behind it
So when I jump behind it, push back on me
So baby, push back when I jump behind it
Oh, baby, let me know you like it
Tonight, let's give 'em something to see

Everybody singing, oh, oh, oh, oh (ayy)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (now)
Everybody singing, oh, oh, oh, oh (ayy)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (now)

Yo, push back while mi push back on di ting
Put it pon you one time, mi phone nuh stop ring (hello?)
Manna ring off my cellular
Nuff chat but tell mi what you tellin' her
Jump up, make it 'bout to jump, 'til it crack your brump
My girl, mi no say nuh', when you crack it up
Rough it up, pon it, Jessica, we no need bed
Mi a done every man, haffi do what mi say (hello?)
I want it, love when you wind up on it
Bi-big bumper, don't stall it
All in the mornin'

Baby, push back when I jump behind it, when I jump behind it
So when I jump behind it, push back on me
So baby, push back when I jump behind it
Oh, baby, let me know you like it
Tonight, let's give 'em something to see

Everybody singing, oh, oh, oh, oh (ayy)
Everybody singing, oh, oh, oh, oh (now)

Say mi whine up the ting 'til it pile up
Big bumper, girl, just a whine and it wile up
Dem a squad, me never stop 'til it pile up
Mind enough so it might (everybody singing)
