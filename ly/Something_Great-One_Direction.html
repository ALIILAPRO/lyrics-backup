		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One day you'll come into my world and say it all
You say we'll be together even when you're lost
One day you'll say these words
I thought you'll never say
You say we're better off together in our bed

I want you here with me
Like how I pictured it
So I don't have to keep imagining

Come on, jump out at me
Come on, bring everything
Is it too much to ask for something great?

The script was written and I could not change a thing
I want to rip it all to shreds and start again
One day I'll come into your world and get it right
I'll say we're better off together here tonight

I want you here with me
Like how I pictured it
So I don't have to keep imagining

Come on, jump out at me
Come on, bring everything
Is it too much to ask for something great?

I want you here with me
Like how I pictured it
So I don't have to keep imagining

Come on, jump out at me
Come on, bring everything
Is it too much to ask for something great?

I want you here with me
Like how I pictured it
Is it too much to ask for something great?

You're all I want
So much it's hurting
You're all I want
So much it's hurting
