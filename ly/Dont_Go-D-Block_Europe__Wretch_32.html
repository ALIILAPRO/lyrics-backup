		  Mm, mm (Nathaniel London)
Mm, mm, mm, mm

Yeah, I sip champagne in the coupe (yeah, yeah)
Girl, I know you love me too (mm-hmm)
But we be arguing like enemies
Hope we ain't never through
Hope you feel the same 'bout me (uh-huh)
How a nigga feel 'bout you (on God)
And that's my lady so it's thousands on her bags and on her shoes
My darg a shooter like he Snoop (yeah, yeah)
Honestly, you're really out my league
But I'm a bando boy, nigga's will vouch for me (yeah)
The way you never sip no alcohol or never smoke no weed
You just remind me, you're so pure, I gotta treat you like a queen (yeah, yeah)
And when I eat, I'm on my knees (yeah, yeah)
We should take a trip to Greece
We should take a trip, no socials and focus on you and me (yeah, yeah)
She like Rapunzel, don't need weave
Pussy been the best I seen (yeah, yeah)
Pussy been the best I touched, my dick so big, it's like a bus
I'm three strokes in, I wanna bust (yeah)
Love your moan, love when you cum
You just taught me 'bout real love
We're toxic but you're number one, yeah
Would you believe I'll sacrifice to see the happy you?
Would you believe I really prayed to Allah to marry you? (On God)
I said, darlin', if I'm bein' real (yeah)
Would you believe your love hit harder than a fuckin' pill?
Lower my gaze when I see women, I can't see them, still (uh, uh)
It's so deep, I love the smell of you, I swear I'm ill

Ain't sorry what you caused over fallouts
It's the rain, it's 'bout to storm, it's a poor world
I'm in the coupe, it's got two doors, that's some pure leather
I know exactly where I belong, you're so cute and you're so strong

So, don't go (don't go)
Don't leave (I told you, don't leave)
Please stay with me (stay with me)
It's so deep, I love the smell of you, I swear I'm ill
Don't go (I told you, don't go)
Don't leave (I told you, don't leave)
Please stay with me (stay with me)

Yeah, I'm mesmerized, I see my future in your eyes
This life decision took one second to decide
And when I thought I lost you, I lost my pride
Was singin' "Don't go" for a second time
The best advice, my better half, my peace of mind
Forget the price, you never ask, just get it twice
Protect your heart with this armor I provide
'Cause you're my queen, I Alexandered your design
I'm lovin' the way you're up, babe
I'm busy tryna give you the whole thing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sleep is the cousin of death, it's all relative
Bread, cheese, dough, and baguettes, that's how I get it in
I feel like we're gettin' close, now we set the mode
Vogue if you ever post, that's from head-to-toe
A fan like I'm at your show, can I get up close?
The roads know you're with the goat, they already know
I'm back kway, make me eat it up tonight
Upgrade, happen right before your eyes
One day, I'ma turn you inna bride, bride

Ain't sorry what you caused over fallouts
It's the rain, it's 'bout to storm, it's a poor world
I'm in the coupe, it's got two doors, that's some pure leather
I know exactly where I belong, you're so cute and you're so strong

So, don't go (don't go)
Don't leave (I told you, don't leave)
Please stay with me (stay with me)
It's so deep, I love the smell of you, I swear I'm ill
Don't go (I told you, don't go)
Don't leave (I told you, don't leave)
Please stay with me (stay with me)

(Nathaniel London)
