		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I'm building a highway back,
Back to the heart of things
No love left to walk back,
Back to the heart of things

So, I'm building above and back
All our city gone red
When I get a call from you,
I'm gonna bid it all true, true

It's so cold when I say goodbye
People holding a meaning, why?
But you never let the car get in
Howling on the sound of swim

Did you want a wind and a
sail it would take a boat
All of infinitive rope
Say what you want, don't bring
Anything back to me

'Cause I'm old, I will say goodbye
Hoping to run out of my lie
If I get a lot from you
I'll make it all come true
