Why does your love hurt so much?
Why?
Why does you love hurt so much?
Don't know why

You know I loved you baby
But all the while you just betrayed me
In the warmth of our bed
All the things that you said were

Ladidadida
Ladidadida
Ladidadida
Ladidadida

Why does your love hurt so much?
Why?
Why does your love hurt so much?
Don't know why

You said our love was sacred
But you left me alone to make it
You want to come back again someday
But darling here's what I say

Ladidadida
Ladidadida
Ladidadida
Ladidadida

Why does your love hurt so much?
Why?
Why does your love hurt so much?

Ladidadida
Ladidadida
Ladidadida
Ladidadida

Why does your love hurt so much?
Tell me why

You say you come back again someday
But darling here's what I say

Ladidadida
Ladidadida

Why does your love hurt so much?
Don't know why
Why does your love hurt so much?
Tell me why
