		  (Great John on the beat, by the way)
Hol' on, huh, look, huh
She like, look, huh

"Lemme see your chain, lemme kiss ya neck," hol' on
"Baby what's your name? We could play a game, lemme be ya rag," wait, huh
She like, "Lemme take a pic, lemme suck ya uh," hol' on
Put it on her lip, take her on a trip, we can't take no flicks, hol' on

Bousin, "Why you trippin'?"
I got thirty-three, no Scottie Pippen
I got that, walk up on 'em, have 'em dippin'
Got that machinery, no planet fitness
Hol' on, huh, hol' on, huh
You could play the dummy, act like you don't know
Get these bands stackin' from the floor
He disrespect, leave him on the floor
Hol' on, huh, hol' on, huh
Nigga who said we don't send shots at niggas?
Like we don't bend blocks on niggas
Come through, gang clearin' them blocks on niggas
Hol' on, huh
She keep tryna hit my jack though
Ass fat, get ya back broke
But no, I don't cuff, baby that's a joke
Hol' on, huh, hol' on, huh
She like, "Sheff, you movin' too reckless"
Not your man, baby why you stressin'?
I only make her pull up for the neckin'
Hol' on, huh, hol' on, huh
Bitches love me, know that I'm a goon
Used to dub a nigga up in school
Now I bet she let me scoop it like a spoon
Hol' on, huh, hol' on, huh
He was flexin' on us, now we smokin' on 'em
Said he miss his homie, then we send him to 'em
He don't think we jokin', now we jokin' on 'em, like
Hol' on, huh
Me and bro, that's too much shots
Me and gang, that's too much Glocks
Niggas lyin', they spin no blocks, hol' on

She like
"Lemme see your chain, lemme kiss ya neck," hol' on
"Baby what's your name? We could play a game, lemme be ya rag," wait, huh
She like, "Lemme take a pic, lemme suck ya uh," hol' on
Put it on her lip, take her on a trip, we can't take no flicks, hol' on

Ha
She like, "lemme touch ya chain, lemme kiss ya neck"
I'm like, "baby, baby what's your name? lemme catch a text"
She like, "Maybe, only if you ballin' and you catchin' checks" (ha)
Put her baddies on a jet (a jet)
Brand new titties to invest
Purple Corvette, she want the flooded Patek
She wanna do the relaxin', do nothin' less
She wanna lay up and sex, I gotta get to a check
Get to finesse, I make a mess when I step
Fifteen hundred just to step, Louis the step
No, you can't step with vest
Anybody wanna bet, it's me, Fivi', Sheff
No I ain't count it the best, but I swear to God we the best
Please do not test
You and your bro can get stretched
You and your bro can get left right 'round your steps
Like, like, we don't run down on niggas
Put a pound on niggas (grrt)
Put the money on a house on a nigga (Fivi', uh)
Reroute then I'm out on niggas (uh, yeah, uh) (skrrt)

She thought she took me on her 
I took the cookies, I'ma cookie monster
She like, "Fivio come, lemme put it on ya" (come lemme put it on ya)
Huh, swerve (swerve)
Hittin' bitches with the curve (uh)
She hit me back with the, uh 
So I know I hit a nerve (uh, uh, uh)
Look, Fivi' Foreign with the A
She listen to every single thing I say
When she link me, she just wanna get laid
When she go link you, she always wanna get paid (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Huh, yeah, son of a (son of a)
She like Fivi' (I'm like what?)
Huh, "Why you don't move like you one of them?" (Uh, yeah)
Yeah (yeah)
Like, "Why you not there when I pull up on son and 'em?" (Yeah, uh)
'Cause they wasn't there when I was comin' up 
Let me get a, huh
You can't get a, nah
Huh, look 
I got a Spanish mami from the Bronx
She with her friends, so that's a Nicki Minaj, uh

Look, huh

She like, look, huh
"Lemme see your chain, lemme kiss ya neck," hol' on
"Baby what's your name? We could play a game, lemme be ya rag," wait, huh
She like, "Lemme take a pic, lemme suck ya uh," hol' on
Put it on her lip, take her on a trip, we can't take no flicks, hol' on
