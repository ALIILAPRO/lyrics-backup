		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Knew I had to bite you, baby, when I first laid eyes on you
That moment turned me on, I can't believe it's true
And I like to watch your body sway
I got no choice, I'm gonna twist your tail
Love me like a reptile, love me like a reptile
I gotta sink my fangs in you

Thunder lizard, stoney eye, you got me hypnotized
Hot tongue breaks in and out and I can't believe my eyes
And your soft white belly, next to mine
Scaly baby, see you shine
Love me like a reptile, love me like a reptile
You're a murderer in disguise
Black mamba, murderer disguise

Baby, you're a rattlesnake, you know the way I feel
Feel you crawling up my back, you've got no love to steal
You know I've got my eyes on you
You're petrified, gonna stick like glue
Love me like a reptile, love me like a reptile
Shock you like an electric eel
Shock you like electric eel, oh
