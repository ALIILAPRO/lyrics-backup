		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby one time
Baby one time babe
Baby one time
Baby one more babe

Baby one time
Baby one time babe
Baby one time
Baby one more babe

You gonna be my man
You know it babe
You gonna be my friend
Oooh babe
So darling take my hand
Don't leave me waitin'
*Don't wanna lose my friend*
No no no no babe

Why don't you understand
And just say 'maybe'
My heart is in your hand
Oooh babe
Don't make me wait too long
Don't make me craze
Don't wanna be alone
No no no no

Make me feel
Make me feel, babe
Make me feel
Make me feel

Make me feel
Make me feel
Make me feel

This one's a funny game
It's so amazen
And never be the same
Oooh babe
You really turn me on
You know I'm ready
You make me lose control
No no no no babe

Now won't you let me say
And be your lady
'cause you can luck my way
Oooh babe
You really make me strong
The feeling's fadeing
I know we can't be wrong
No no no no

Make me feel
Make me feel, babe
Make me feel
Make me feel, babe
Make me feel

Make me feel
Make me feel
Make me feel
