		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Taken with the maritime
Thrown asunder with the waves
I've been set adrift
Thrown beneath the ship
What's in the water
Left beneath the piercing blue
And I didn't even take my last breath
Now I'm left here with my useless lungs
What's in the water
I'm so afraid
Swim or it'll catch up
I'm done
I hate the ocean
I'm not okay
It's endless why am I
In this
The albatross is wrapped around my neck
That's how I know I
Got my wings
Please caress my soul until I can't
Restless nights
And broken dreams
I will fight
In my sleep
Swim or it'll catch up
I'm done
