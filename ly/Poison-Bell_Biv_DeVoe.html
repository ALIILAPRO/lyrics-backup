		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, Spyderman and Freeze in full effect
Uh-huh
You ready, Ron?
I'm ready
You ready, Biv?
I'm ready, Slick, are you?
Oh, yeah, break it down

Girl I must warn you
I sense something strange in my mind
(Yeah) Yo, situation is serious
Let's cure it 'cause we're running out of time
(Tell 'em Rick) It's all so beautiful

Relationships they seem from the start
Yeah, it's all so deadly
When love is not together from the heart
Check it out

It's driving me out of my mind
That's why it's hard for me to find
Can't get it outta my head
Miss her, kiss her, love her (wrong move you're dead)

That girl is poison
Never trust a big butt and smile
That girl is poison (poison)

If I were you I'd take precaution
Before I step to meet a fly girl
You know 'cause in some portions
You'll think she's the best thing in the world

She's so fly, she'll drive you right out of your mind
Steal your heart when you're blind
Beware she's schemin', she'll make you think you're dreamin'
You'll fall in love and you'll be screamin' demon, ooh

Poison deadly moving it slow
Looking for a mellow fellow like DeVoe
Getting paid laid so better lay low
Schemin' on house, money, and the whole show

The low pro hoe she'll be cut like an afro
See what you sayin' huh?
She's a winner to you but I know she's a loser
How do you know? Me and the crew used to do her

Poison, poison, poison, (poison) poison

(Poison, poison, poison, p-poison)
(Poison, poison, poison, p-poison, poison)
(Poison, poison, poison, p-poison)
(Poison, poison, poison, p-poison, poison)

I was at the park shake, bakin', takin' 'em off
And that night I played the wall
Checkin' out the fellas the highs and lows
Keepin' one eye open still clockin' the hoes
There was one particular girl that stood out from the rest
Poison as can be, the high power chest
Michael Bivins here and I'm runnin' the show
Bell, Biv DeVoe
Now you know, yo, Slick, blow

It's driving me out of my mind
That's why it's hard for me to find
Can't get it outta my head
Miss her, kiss her, love her (wrong move, you're dead)

That girl is poison (poison, poison)
Never trust a big butt and smile (poison)
Poison (poison, poison)
She's dangerous (poison)

Oh yeah (poison) oh yeah (poison, poison)
(Poison) Yeah fellas, that was another dope one
You know what I'm sayin', Mike?
Yeah, B.B.D. In full effect
Yo', wassup to Ralph T and Johnny G
And I can't forget about my boy, B. Brown
And the whole NE crew
(Poison)

Ah-ooh
