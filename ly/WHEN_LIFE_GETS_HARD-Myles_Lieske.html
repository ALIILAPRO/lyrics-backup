		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When we're in the dark, and we're all alone, no doubt, I can share my love with you, oh darlin
When we're in the dark, and we're all alone, no doubt', I can share my love with you, oh darlin
When I'm in the dark, you know I can feel it, you know that I have some sort of feeling
And it's not one that I wanna keep, yeah, life be hard so I be lonely, yeah
How do I say it? How do I say it? Really goin' crazy
Can I make it? Can I make it? Don't even know if I can take it
I say I'm waitin', I'm waitin', am I okay? Is that what I'm sayin'?
Is that what I'm sayin'? I wish I was playin
I'm feelin' kinda low, don't really know how this would go
Takin' things slow, runnin' through though, tryin' to keep up, starin' window
I wanna be big, I wanna be huge, I wanna be the one to make it big too
I wanna chase the dreams I have, they're new, I wanna find somethin' great to do
But if this is it, will I make it
Make a hit, I'll take this
If this is it, will I make it? Will I make a hit or will I take this
Cause I might be feelin' low, but I am and I know where to go
I look at myself and then I know, maybe somethin' will come and go
But right now I'm head with the flow, when the time comes I'll have somethin' to show
Cause when I'm in the dark and I'm all alone, no doubt
I will change my life for you, yeah
When life gets hard and I'm all alone
Cause when I'm in the dark and I'm all alone, no doubt
I will change my life for you
When life gets hard and I'm all alone, no doubt
I will change my life for you
