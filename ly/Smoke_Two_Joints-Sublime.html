		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (She was living in a single room with three other individuals 
One of them was a male, and the other two 
Well, the other two were females 
God only knows what they were up to in there
And furthermore Susan I wouldn't be 
The least bit surprised to learn that all four of them 
Habitually smoked marijuana cigarettes, reefers)

I smoke two joints in the morning
I smoke two joint at night
I smoke two joint in the afternoon
It makes me feel alright

I smoke two joints in time of peace
And two in time of war
I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints
And then I smoke two more

(Smoke cigarettes 'til the day she dies!
Toke a big spliff of some good sensimillia
Smoke cigarettes 'til the day she dies!
Toke a big spliff of some good sensamill
Eazy-E were ya ever caught slippin'? Hell nah!)

Daddy he once told me
"Son, you be hard workin' man"
And momma she once told me
"Son, you do the best you can"
Then one day I met a man
He came to me and said
"Hard work good and hard work fine
But first take care of head"

Whoa rock me to the night
Jah say oh oh oh oh oh
