		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're tired of hanging around
Waiting for life to come to you
So tired, it's getting you down
Miss the fun that used to be in you
I know that most of it is probably not your fault
But, I ain't giving up, no way
No, I ain't giving up, no way, no way

Oh, oh, it's a beautiful day
Oh, oh, don't let it slip away
Time wish you'd walk out that door
Tell me what you waiting for
Oh, oh, it's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
Oh, yeah

I know there's gonna be days
When it's gonna be hard for you
Let's go, 'cause I know a place
That I really wanna show you
You say you just won't run
And I'm wasting my time
But, I ain't giving up, no way
No, I ain't giving up, no way, no way

Oh, oh, it's a beautiful day
Oh, oh, don't let it slip away
Time wish you'd walk out that door
Tell me what you waiting for
Oh, oh, it's a beautiful day
A beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
A beautiful day

And when you give in, let it shine
And don't you let them change our story
Can you see it? I'm here for you
If I fall, I will fall 
pick you up from the ground, and I say

Oh, oh
Oh, oh, it's a beautiful day
Oh, oh, don't let it slip away
Time wish you'd walk out that door
Tell me what you waiting for

Oh, oh
It's a beautiful day
Oh, yeah
A beautiful day
Nah, nah, nah, nah
No, no, no, no
Nah, nah, nah, nah
It's a beautiful, beautiful day
Beautiful day
