		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish it would stay the same 
like the smell of summer rain
but it doesn't
no it doesn't

We filled these shoes so fast 
and I thought that they would last
but they didn't
no they didn't

Times will change and so will we 
I guess we're older now it seams

I'd give it all for one
just one more chance to run
feel everything once more
 feel it like before
like the first time

We used our fake IDs
made love or tried at least
always wanting more
but we had it all the first time

I'll keep the memories 
and accept it will never be
How we left it
 but we left it 

We spent so many nights
dreaming of a perfect life 
Will we make it
Have we made it?

I guess that life has changed and so have we
cause we are older now, it seams 

I'd give it all for one
just one more chance to run
feel everything once more
feel it like before
like the first time

we used our fake IDs
made love or tried at least
always wanting more
but we had it all the first time

Ooh
The First Time

Ooh 
Remember the first time

Ooh 
Remember the first time 

Aah

I'd give it all for one
just one more chance to run
feel everything once more
 feel it like before

I'd give it all for one
just one more chance to run
feel everything once more
feel it like before
like the first time

we used our fake IDs
made love or tried at least
always wanting more
but we had it all the first time

Ohh 
The first time 

Ooh 
Like the first time
