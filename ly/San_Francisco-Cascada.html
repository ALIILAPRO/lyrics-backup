		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll take you back to nineteen sixty nine
Let's hit the city of freedom, like old times
It's getting dirty
Underneath the blue sky
Imagine you and me countin' the butterflies

One, two, three
Let's bring it on
Keep on dancing in the streets of love
French kissing on JFK drive
Till we crash at the beach
Where we watch the sun rise

Tell me what you're waiting for

We're crossing the golden gate
Party at the Frisco bay

Wake me up in San Francisco
(When you got power in your head girl, party everywhere girl)
Wake me up in San Francisco
(Where the love is in the air, all the people stop and stare)
Baby take me back to the city of love
To the place that I've been dreaming of
San Francisco
Wake me up in San Francisco

It's ten pm
Getting ready for the night
Wanna be a hippie when the city's getting high
I'm cruising down Broadway, you on my side
Pulling over my pink rover at the hungry eye

One, two, three
Let's bring it on
DJ play my favorite beats
All night long
Poppin' some bottles, champagne, red wine
And we both giddy up on the rooftop
And watch the city lights

Tell me what you waiting for

We're crossing the golden gate
Party at the Frisco bay

Wake me up in San Francisco
(When you got power in your head girl, party everywhere girl)
Wake me up in San Francisco
(Where the love is in the air, all the people stop and stare)
Baby take me back to the city of love
To the place that I've been dreaming of
San Francisco
Wake me up in San Francisco

We're playing songs of life
Like it's sixty nine
We sing and dance, under the sun of San Francisco
Stars shine so bright on the city tonight

We're crossing the golden gate
Party at the Frisco bay

Wake me up in San Francisco
(When you got power in your head girl, party everywhere girl)
Wake me up in San Francisco
(Where the love is in the air, all the people stop and stare)
Baby take me back to the city of love
To the place that I've been dreaming of
San Francisco
Wake me up in San Francisco

C'mon take me back to the city of love
To the place that I've been dreaming of

So wake me up in San Francisco
