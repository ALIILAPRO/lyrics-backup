		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hush now, my baby
Be still love, don't cry.
Sleep like you're rocked by the stream.
Sleep and remember
my lullaby.
And I'll be with you when you dream.

Drift on a river
that flows through my arms.
Drift as I'm singing to you.
I see you smiling
so peaceful and calm.
And holding you, I'm smiling too.
Here in my arms
safe from all harm.
Holding you, I'm smiling too.

Hush now, my baby
Be still love, don't cry.
Sleep like you're rocked by the stream.
Sleep and remember this river lullaby.
And I'll be with you when you dream.
I'll be with you when you dream.
