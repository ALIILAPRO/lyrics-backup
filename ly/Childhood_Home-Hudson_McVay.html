		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You haven't traveled this road alone
(Without the love, without the love)
Without the love of an
Old familiar voice on the phone
But are you really
Counting on the flare
Of a hopeless prayer
To take you home
The road is wide and soaks up the plain
As every haunting memory remains
Now your mountains won't climb
Your rivers won't run
They're pulling at your eyes 'cause you loved someone
And you left someone
When he didn't seem to care at all
(He loves demerol)
Do you remember playing in the shed
And cauliflower skies
You're swinging on the porch
Every time you close your eyes
But if you went back now
Would it even pass the test
Is there someone left
For you to call
Though you know it's always
Ringing in your ear
As it draws you near
Your childhood home
