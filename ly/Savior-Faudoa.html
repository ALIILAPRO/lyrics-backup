		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders 
Let me walk upon the waters 
Wherever you would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wonder
And my faith will be made stronger 
In the presence of my savior
Wait right here and don't let go of my lost soul and
Dont you know i cant control it
You've left me now im falling
Let me go and can't you see you've hurt my feels
I won't take this any longer
Somebody come and save me
In too deep
And my head's just another ocean
I could almost feel the tension
You're broken now im falling
Take me deeper than my thought could ever go on 
And my faith will be made stronger in the presence of my savior
