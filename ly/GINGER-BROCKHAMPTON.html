		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Know you got your own shit, and all of it together
And you know you got your own space, right here forever, baby
Know you got your own, know you got your own
Know you got your own, know you, know you got your own
Know you got your own shit, and all of it together
And you know you got your own space, right here forever, baby
Know you got your own, know you got your own
Know you got your own, know you, know you got your own
Know you got your own shit, and all of it together
And you know you got your own space, right here forever, babe
Know you got your own, know you got your own
Know you got your own, know you, know you got your own

Ay, stay sound when you not around
Mood is always better whenever you not around
Fuckin' up the weather, and you're fuckin' up my town
Fuckin' up a sweater, and I'm fuckin' up a gown
Look at how I'm shinin' though
Look at how I'm smilin' though
Look at how I'm smilin'
Look at how I'm wildin', and I'm still broke
You still think I'm a joke, I still think I'm a joke
I still think it ain't gon' work out
Nigga that shit is broke, broke, broke, broke

Tell me, goddamn, what God made me for?
I don't even love no more
I don't even trust no more
I don't need to clutch no more
Some things outside of my contro-ol
I need some space, I need to gro-ow
So I go (ooh), plague my soul
Say I won't (ooh)
I never tried to let you go so deep, deep, deep

Know you got your own shit, and all of it together
And you know you got your own space, right here forever, baby
Know you got your own, know you got your own
Know you got your own, know you, know you got your own
Know you got your own shit, and all of it together
And you know you got your own space, right here forever, baby
Know you got your own, know you got your own
Know you got your own, know you, know you got your own

But I couldn't lie, you swear and you cry
Your teeth rotting while they fall onto mine
Pouring bleach on the white, won't bring them to life
Pliers twist to the right, pull out your mind
But I couldn't lie, you swear and you cry
Your teeth rotting while they fall onto mine
Pouring bleach on the white, won't bring them to life
Pliers twist to the right, pull out your mind

I don't wanna take this ride
I don't wanna take this ride
(Pouring bleach on the white, pouring bleach on the white, white, white)
I don't wanna take this ride
Pouring bleach on the white, pouring bleach on the white, white, white)
I don't wanna take this ride
Pouring bleach on the white, pouring bleach on the white, white, white)
Pull out your mind

Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
