		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Data under scrutiny
doesn’t lie.
As time is running out,
no one wants to die.

If we’re able to engage
on this careful plan,
You have my word to
save whatever we can.

All decisions coalesce,
everything is under fire,
Risk and reward are equal partners here
fueling our truest desires.

And our success may leave a few behind,
the greater good worth several lives.
Precision now so nothing is in vain,
All signs are go. Target acquired.

Quietly you dream as we
scope the night.
Execute the mission
when our pulse is high.

Doing the right thing should be
tactical and easy.
Not when what is at stake
is all of humanity.

All decisions coalesce,
everything is under fire,
Risk and reward are equal partners here
fueling our truest desires.

And our success may leave a few behind,
the greater good worth several lives.
Precision now so nothing is in vain,
All signs are go. Target acquired.

All signs are go. Target acquired.
(Target acquired.)
