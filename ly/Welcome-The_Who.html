		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come to my house
Be one of the comfortable people
Lovely bright home
We're drinking all night
Never sleeping

Milkman come in!
And you baker
Little old lady welcome
And you shoe maker

Come to this house!
Into this house

Come to this house
Be one of us
Make this your house
Be one of us

You can help
To collect some more in
Young and old people
Lets get them all in!

Come to this house!
Into this house
 
Ask along that man who's wearing a carnation
Bring every single person
From Victoria Station
Go into that hospital
And bring nurses and patients
Everyone go home and fetch their relations!

Come to this house
Be one of the comfortable people
Lovely bright home
Drinking all night never sleeping

Excuse me sir, there's more at the door
There's more at the door
There's more at the door
There's more at the door
There's more at the door
There's more at the door
There's more at the door
There's more at the door
There's more

We need more room
Build an extension
A colorful palace
Spare no expense now

Come to this house
Be one of us
Come into this house
Be one of us

Come to this house
Into this house

Welcome
