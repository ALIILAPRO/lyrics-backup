And pump it (louder)
Pump it (louder)

Niggas wanna hate on us (who)
Niggas be envious (who)
I know why they hatin' on us (why)
'Cause that's so fabulous (what)
I'm a be real on us (c'mon)
Nobody got nuttin' on us (no)
Girls be all on us, from London back down to the US (S, S)

We rockin', it's contagious
Monkey business outrageous
Just confess, your girl admits that we the shit

Dude wanna hate on us (dude)
Dude needa ease on up (dude)
Dude wanna act on up
But dude get shut like Flava shut (shut 'em down)
Chicks say, she ain't down
But chick backstage when we in town (ha)
She like man on drunk (fool)
She wanna hit n' run (errr)
Yeah, that's the speed
That's what we do
That's who we be
B-L-A-C-K-E-Y-E-D-P to the E, then the A to the S
When we play you shake your ass
Shake it, shake it, shake it girl
Make sure you don't break it, girl
'Cause we gonna

Turn it up (turn it up)
Turn it up (turn it up)
Turn it up

C'mon baby, just

Pump it (louder)

Apl.de.ap from the Philippines
Live and direct, rocking this scene
Breakin' on down for the B-boys
And B-girls waitin' to do their thing
Pump it, louder come on
Don't stop, and keep it goin'
Do it, lets get it on
Move it

Come on, baby, do it

La-da-di-da-da di da
On the stereo
Let those speakers blow your mind
(Blow my mind, baby)
Just let it go, let it go
Here we go
La-da-di-da-da di da (c'mon, we're there)
On the radio
The system's gonna feel so fine

Pump it (louder)
Pump it (louder)
Pump it (louder)
Pump it (louder)
Pump it (louder)
Pump it (louder)

And say, oh oh oh oh
Say, oh oh oh oh
Yo, yo
Turn up the radio
Blast your stereo
Right now
This joint is fizzlin'
It's sizzlin'
Right
