		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She can't help it, the girl can't help it (oh, baby)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (oh, baby)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (oh, baby)
She can't help it

First time that I saw your eyes
Boy, you looked right through me, mmm, mmm
Played it cool, but I knew you knew
That Cupid hit me, mmm, mmm

You got me trippin' (oh), stumblin' (oh), flippin' (oh), fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (in love)
You got me slippin' (oh), tumblin' (oh), sinkin' (oh), crumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (in love)
So in love with you

She can't help it, the girl can't help it (oh, baby)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (oh, no)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (no how)
She can't help it

Can't breathe, when you touch my sleeve
Butterflies so crazy, mmm, mmm
Whoa now, think I'm goin' down
Friends don't know what's with me, mmm, mmm

You got me trippin' (oh), stumblin' (oh), flippin' (oh), fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (in love)
You got me slippin' (oh), tumblin' (oh), sinkin' (oh), crumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (in love)
So in love with you

She can't help it, the girl can't help it (oh, no)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (oh please)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (oh, no)
She can't help it

You know, this ain't the first time this has happened to me
This "love sick" thing
I like serious relationships and, uh
A girl like me don't stay single for long
'Cause every time a boyfriend and I break up
My world is crushed and I'm all alone
The love bug crawls right back up and bites me
And I'm back

She can't help it, the girl can't help it (in love)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (oh, God)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (I'm back in love)
She can't help it (woo)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (I'm back in love now)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (I'm back in love now, baby)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (I'm back in love now)
She can't help it (and now you got me)

You got me trippin' (oh), stumblin' (oh), flippin' (oh), fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (in love)
You got me slippin' (oh), tumblin' (oh), sinkin' (oh), crumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (in love)
So in love with you
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (in love)
You got me slippin' (oh), tumblin' (oh), sinkin' (oh), crumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (in love)

So in love with you
So in love with you
So in love with you
