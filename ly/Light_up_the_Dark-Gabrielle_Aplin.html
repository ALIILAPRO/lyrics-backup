		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't have to mention that I saw you today
I shone the sun into your eyes
And you don't always have to question why there's pleasure and pain
'Cause there's no truth for you to find

I'm drawing perfect circles 'round the life that we could share
And what is ours, is ours to keep
I know the thing you want the most, you hide it over there
Safe at the dark end of the street

When the devil's waiting
Down by the river calling out
I wanna be the one to light up the dark in you
And when the flood is over and all the love is pouring out
I wanna be the one to light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you
Oh, light up the dark in you

There's so little I'm afraid of when it comes to an end
But I can't leave you on your own
When your chaos turns to silence and your enemies your friends
I will run away the storm

When the devil's waiting
Down by the river calling out
I wanna be the one to light up the dark in you
And when the flood is over and all the love is pouring out
I wanna be the one to light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you
Light, light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you
Light, light up the dark in you

When the devil's waiting
Down by the river calling out
I wanna be the one to light up the dark in you
And when the flood is over and all the love is pouring out
I wanna be the one to light up the dark in you
And when the devil's waiting
Down by the river calling out
I wanna be the one to light up the dark in you
And when the flood is over and all the love is pouring out
I wanna be the one to light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you
Light, light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you
