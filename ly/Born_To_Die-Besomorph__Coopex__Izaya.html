		  ‘Born To Die’ Lyrics
Written by Ethan Uno-Portillo
Verse 1
(Baby you and I were born to die)
Your empty words and countless lies
Never left my satisfied
Drew me in then terrorized
Baby you’re a nightmare in disguise
Feed my desire a thousand times
But never left my satisfied
Hid your soul beneath the lies
Couldn’t tell the truth even if you tried
Pre Chorus
No reason for us to hide
There is no future for you and I
Took time to realize that our connection was born to die
Refrain
Our connection was born to die
You and I were born to die
Verse 2
(Baby you and I were born to die)
I’ve seen deception in your eyes
Need confession to all the lies
Gave you chances you know I’ve tried
It’s hard to put your past aside
Your empty words and countless lies
Never left me satisfied
And all the pain you’ve kept inside
Has left its scares inside my mind
Pre Chorus 2
No reason for us to hide
There is no future for you and I
Took time to realize that our connection was born to die
Refrain 2
Our connection was born to die
Baby you and I were born to die
