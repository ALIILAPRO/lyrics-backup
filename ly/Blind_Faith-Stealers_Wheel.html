		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you remember back in '64?
You came a-knockin', knockin' on my door,
Yeah, you really got me going, but you kept me on ice,
I didn't care where I was going, no I didn't think twice.

I was just a young boy, yeah, I was so green,
You were so experienced, you know what I mean,
Still you really got me going, but you kept me on ice,
I didn't care where I was going, no I didn't think twice.

[Chorus]
Blind faith was all we had,
Looking back it all seems kind of sad,
We just sat around and watched it all go bad.

I said I never thanked you for everything you'd done,
I had to do a lot of walking before I could run.
Still you really got me going, but you kept me on ice,
I didn't care where I was going, no I didn't think twice.

[Chorus: Repeats]
