		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was blinded by the power
Climbing up the ladder
Even pushed away my father
I was caught up in the rat race
Living in a dark place
Man, I wish I never bothered

In the end when all is said and done
In the end we learn to overcome
In the end we'll sing our final song
We forgive, we forget and move on

I was standing there in silence
In a church somewhere in Ireland
It was there I was reminded
The mistakes that I collected
And the people I affected
They're the ones that I respected

In the end when all is said and done
In the end we learn to overcome
In the end we'll sing our final song
We forgive, we forget and move on

And move on
And move on

We forgive
We forget 
And move on
