		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your old house, it feels smaller
Will it fade out if we wait longer?
Quick trip down, just up and by
I'm late now, but sometimes

I wanna be
Sixteen at the park, parked in your dad's car
Dreamin', gonna grow up, be a big star
Best friends wanna get drunk in a backyard
So cool hangin' out in the backyard
Girl talk, talk about boys like it's business
Mom's mad, gotta get home this instant
Sixteen, bittersweet, oh, so innocent
I guess, I guess I'm missin' it

(Ooh) I guess I'm missin' it
(Ooh) I guess I'm missin'

Your old room, these walls look different
Nothin's new, just days and distance
And I'm freaked out the more I realize
It's gone now, but sometimes

I wanna be
Sixteen at the park, parked in your dad's car
Dreamin', gonna grow up, be a big star
Best friends wanna get drunk in a backyard
So cool hangin' out in the backyard
Girl talk, talk about boys like it's business
Mom's mad, gotta get home this instant
Sixteen, bittersweet, oh, so innocent
I guess, I guess I'm missin' it
I guess I'm missin' it

(Ooh) Bein' na√Øve, little less behind me
(Ooh) I didn't know, I didn't know a thing at

Sixteen
I wanna be sixteen
I wanna be sixteen
I wanna be, I wanna be
