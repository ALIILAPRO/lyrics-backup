		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come on!

I can see her now
Dancing around, her drink in hand
All her baggage in tow
I just want to forget and let go
Of all the joy, all of the pain
I took your guilt and placed it into me
And now I kiss it goodbye
Our last dance ended fatally

Who's sleeping on my side of the bed tonight?
Have you ever cried so hard?
Baby you just died (you just died)
Who's sleeping on my side of the bed tonight?
Have you ever cried so hard?
Have you ever cried so hard?

There she goes again
Another masquerade in false circumstance
She'll fuck you just for the taste
I just wish I could replace all the memories
Of what makes my blood run cold
And as your blood flows through me
I say goodbye to what we had

Who's sleeping on my side of the bed tonight?
Have you ever cried so hard?
Baby you just died (you just died)
Who's sleeping on my side of the bed tonight?
Have you ever cried so hard?
Have you ever cried so hard?

She came and went
I gnawed through my lip
Makeup smeared in her eyes
Each sob's a reason to say goodbye
Sometimes when you're holding on
You'll never see the light

With flowers in her hair
I gazed upon with dead lovers eyes
She never looked so good
And I never felt so right
With flowers in her hair
I gazed upon with dead lovers eyes
She never looked so good
And I never felt so right
I never felt so right,
I never felt so right!

With flowers in her hair
I gazed upon with dead lovers eyes
She never looked so good
And I never felt so right

Who's sleeping on my side of the bed tonight?
Have you ever cried so hard?
Baby you just died (you just died)
Who's sleeping on my side of the bed tonight?
Have you ever cried so hard?
Have you ever cried so hard? 
you just died!
