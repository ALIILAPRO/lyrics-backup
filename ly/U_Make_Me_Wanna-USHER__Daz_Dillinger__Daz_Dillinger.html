		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is what you do
This is what you do
This is what you do
This is what you do

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (ooh yeah)
Start a new relationship with you 
This is what you do (ooh baby)
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me (you make me)
You make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you (ohh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
This is what you do (yeah, yeah)
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me
You make me

Before anything began between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to
When me and my girl was having problems (that's right)
You used to say it'll be ok
Suggest little nice things I should do (uh-huh)
And when I go home at night and lay my head down
All I seem to think about was you
And how

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (ooh yeah)
Start a new relationship with you 
This is what you do (oh yeah)
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me 
You make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you (ooh, baby)
This is what you do (come on, come on, come on, come on)
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me (you make me)
You make me

Now what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should have been you
What's sad is that I love her but I'm falling for you (uh-huh)
What should I do?
Should I tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I do exactly what I feel inside?
'Cause, I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (oh, ooh, baby)
Start a new relationship with you 
This is what you do (say, what you do)
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with (oh, yeah)
You make me 
You make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you (ooh, baby)
This is what you do (come on, come on, come on, come on)
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me
You make me

At this point the situation's out of control (say what?)
I never meant to hurt her
But I gotta let her go (gotta let her go)
And she may not understand it
While all of this is going on
I tried, I tried to fight it
But the feeling's just too strong

You make, make, make me (you make me wanna, wanna)
You make me wanna (ayy)
You make me wanna (oh)
Oh, you make, make, me, me
You make me wanna

You make me wanna (ooh, oh babe)
You make me wanna (gon' baby, do your thing)
You make me wanna (ooh, ooh-ooh yeah)
Come along wit' it
You makin' me, you makin' me

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (oh, ooh, baby)
Start a new relationship with you 
This is what you do (say, what you do)
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with (oh, yeah)
You make me 
You make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you (ooh, baby)
This is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with (ayy)
You make me
You make me (you makin' me)

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (leave the one I'm with)
Start a new relationship with you (ooh, you makin' me, you makin' me, you makin' me)
This is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with (ohh)
You make me 
You make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (wanna leave the one I'm with)
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
