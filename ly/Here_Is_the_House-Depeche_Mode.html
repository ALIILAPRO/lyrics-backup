		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here is the house where it all happens
Those tender moments, under this roof
Body and soul come together
As we come closer together
And is it happens, it happens here in this house

And I feel your warmth and it feels like home
And there's someone calling on the telephone
Let's stay home, it's cold outside
And I have so much to confide to you

With or without words I'll confide everything

Here is the house where it all happens
Those tender moments, under this roof
Body and soul come together
As we come closer together
As it happens, it happens here in this house

So we stay at home and I'm by your side
And you know what's going on inside
Inside my heart, inside this house
And I just want to let it out for you

And I feel your warmth and it feels like home
And I feel your warmth and it feels like home

Home
Home

Here is the house where it all happens (here is the house)
Those tender moments, under this roof
Body and soul come together
As we come closer together

Here is the house where it all happens (here is the house)
Those tender moments, under this roof
Body and soul come together
As we come closer together

Here is the house where it all happens (here is the house)
Those tender moments, under this roof
Body and soul come together
As we come closer together
Home
Home
Home
