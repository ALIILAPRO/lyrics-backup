		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a lot of bad habits
I tried to quit but I'm so bad at it
They did me dirty I ain't havin' it
Now I got issues with abandonment
Cause I've been down bad so bad
I had to leave 'em in the past so you know that
Things change and it wont last
I think I came too far to even go back
Cause I ain't even trying to put the blame on you
But I don't know if I could do the same to you
People change and then they wanna see some change from you
But trust me homie I won't ever be the same as you
That's why I ain't tryin' to get attached
I been holdin' back emotions drinking liquor out the glass
I been goin thru the motions pray to God that it'll pass
Roll the pressure up and then I get the bag and do the dash off
Blast off careful what you ask for
I got too many problems I don't need to have more
It be ya own ones who be sneakin' thru the back door
So I don't even know what I should ask for
I got a lot of bad habits
I tried to quit but I'm so bad at it
They did me dirty I ain't havin' it
Now I got issues with abandonment
Cause I've been down bad so bad
I had to leave 'em in the past so you know that
Things change and it wont last
I think I came too far to even go back
That's just how it is that's the way it go
And if you pay no mind it's your funeral
Give ya boy a bottle like a give and go
And you know I got your back like it's a pick 'n roll
I swear too many tried to ride my wave
But it's ok cuz we are not the same
I told her she should come and slide my way
I'm in the city but I'm on my way
I got a lot of bad habits
I tried to quit but I'm so bad at it
They did me dirty I ain't havin' it
Now I got issues with abandonment
Cause I've been down bad so bad
