		  Came alone but you yeah
Oh there's something to ya see ya Moving Hallelujah come on come on
Hot just like a pool yeah
Let me dive in to ya
Close your eyes and hallelujah come on come on
Came alone but you yeah
Oh there's something to ya see ya Moving Hallelujah come on come on
Hot just like a pool yeah
Let me dive in to ya
Close your eyes and hallelujah come on come on come on
Come on over Give me something Come on over
I'll be waiting Come on over Give me something Gimme love

And she's looking like model Drinking right from the bottle
And she's looking like a model
but she's stubborn like ya daughter Looking like model
Drinking right from the bottle Looking like a model

Came alone but you yeah
Oh there's something to ya see ya Moving Hallelujah come on come on
Hot just like a pool yeah
Let me dive in to ya
Close your eyes and hallelujah come on come on come on
 
 Come on over Gimme something Come on over

Cus i need it
You where
And she's looking like model Drinking right from the bottle
And she's looking like a model
but she's stubborn like ya daughter Looking like model
Drinking right from the bottle Looking like a model
but she's stubborn like ya daughter
Come on Come on Come on
And she's looking like model Drinking right from the bottle
And she's looking like a model
but she's stubborn like ya daughter Looking like model
Drinking right from the bottle
And she's looking like a model
but she's stubborn like ya daughter
Come on Come on
