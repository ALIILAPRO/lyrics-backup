		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh, oh
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so

I never been awake
I never seen a day break
Leaning on my pillow in the morning
A lazy day in bed
Music in my head
And crazy music playing in the morning light

Oh, oh, oh
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so

I love a sunny day
And dream of far away
Dreaming on my pillow in the morning
I never been awake
I never seen a day break
Leaning on my pillow in the morning light

Oh, oh, oh
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so

Oh, oh, oh
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so

Never believe
