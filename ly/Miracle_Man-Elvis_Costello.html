		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You never asked me what I wanted
You only asked me why
I never thought that so much trouble
Was restin' on my reply

I could tell by the nights when I was lonely
And you were the only one who'd come
I could tell you that I like your sensitivity
When you know it's the way that you walk

Why do you have to say there there's always someone
Who can do it better than I can?
But don't you think that I know that walking on the water
Won't make me a miracle man?

Baby's gotta have the things she wants
You know she's gotta have the things she loves
She's got a ten-inch bamboo cigarette holder
And her black patent leather gloves

And I'm doing everything just tryin' to please her
Even crawling around on all fours
Oh, I thought by now that it was gonna be easy
But she still seems to want for more

Why do you have to say there there's always someone
Who can do it better than I can?
But don't you think that I know that walking on the water
Won't make me a miracle man?
Oh yeah

Never given you a bad reputation
Just because you've never been denied
You try to say you've done it all before
Baby, you know that you just get tired

Yet everybody loves you so much, girl
I just don't know how you stand the strain
Oh I-I'm the one who's here tonight
And I don't want to do it all in vain

Why do you have to say there there's always someone
Who can do it better than I can?
But don't you think that I know that walking on the water
Won't make me a miracle man?
Oh yeah

A miracle man
A miracle man
A miracle man
A miracle man
A miracle man
A miracle man
A miracle man
A miracle man
A miracle man
