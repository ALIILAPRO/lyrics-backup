		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wake up to face another day of
Madness, the modern world at play.
Corruption, from white and blue alike,
Serenity is jeopardised.

Envoys are delt their hands.
Barter with their deadly plans for
Power they deal and trade
Compare the guns they made - big gun.

Secrets held from humanity.
Errors kept under lock and key
Mistrust, another people lost.
Red atomic double cross - twisted cross.

Famine, plagues the lands they rape,
As they spoon feed tv tape.
Bustling nations horde their rotting wheat,
Bloated tribesmen wither in the heat.

Spotlight on the innocent,
Kiddnapping extortion oil money spent.
Justice bent the eastern way,
Stand up for freedom with your life you'll pay.

Hijackers, terror in the sky
Crackpot colonel spits it in your eye.
Shiite dies to pick a fight,
New mercedes packed with dynamite.

Torture from the hooded nations
Heads of state decapitation.
Control is their ultra plan,
Sacred blood spills upon their hands

Madman don't waste any time,
Murder inside david's shrine.
Bullets riddle wailing wall,
On bloody broken knees they crawl.

chorus: 
Hooded madmen make your move,
Tell me something, what you're trying to prove?
Why won't you let me see your face?
My fire's bigger, I'll put you in your place.

Third world, deep freeze hostage plot,
Pray to your God you get caught.
All the world will hear your name,
As you proudly claim your blame.

Struggle behind the murky face,
Panic fronts the world wide race.
At random choose the blood they smear,
Thermo global fear.

Blindman leading the blind,
Mercy gets left behind.
Hopeless victims beg and plead,
Peace is what you need.

My patience is tried and worn,
The number of the flags you've torn.
I've delt with your many threats,
Faceless creature, I'll get you yet.

(repeat chorus)
