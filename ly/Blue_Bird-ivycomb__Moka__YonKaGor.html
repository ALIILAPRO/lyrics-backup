		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm so done with being a little possessed
But your love is just so fresh it's intoxicating
I just scroll around, I like and I laugh
But it's time for me to go, can't keep my friends awaiting

Oh look, I got a new notification
I'll check at the station
It's not urgent, I need to go
Oh look, I got a new notification
Update on the nation
I'll take one quick look at my phone

I'm so done with being a little possessed
But your love is just so fresh it's intoxicating
I'm not done with being your friend on a streak
But your touch is just so real it's intoxicating
I'm so done with being a little possessed
But your love is just so fresh it's intoxicating
I'm not done with being your friend on a streak
But your touch is just so real it's intoxicating

It's been a while since we've hung out again
I'm not really in the mood I've been distracted again
I just need a bit of time to finish up these posts
If you just wait a while I promise that I won't ghost

Oh look, I got a new notification
They want me at the station
It's not urgent, Don't want to go
Oh look, I got a new notification
It's from the PlayStation
I'll keep looking right at my phone

I'm so done with being a little possessed
But your love is just so fresh it's intoxicating
I just scroll around, I like and I laugh
But it's time for me to go, can't keep my friends awaiting

Hey look I know it's been a long time, but you're not around with us over here anymore and I'm
So sick of feeling like you're just a ghost, missing on our toast, this party is a banger
I'm so done with you being so possessed
Cause this ship is sinking with you toxic ghost parading
I'm so done with you, you're just so possessed
But your mind is just so shot you're intoxicated

I'm so done with being a little possessed
But your love is just so fresh it's intoxicating
I'm not done with being your friend on a streak
But your touch is just so real it's intoxicating
I'm so done with being a little possessed
But your love is just so fresh it's intoxicating
I'm not done with being your friend on a streak
But your touch is just so real it's intoxicating
I'm so done with being a little possessed
But your love is just so fresh it's intoxicating
I'm not done with being your friend on a streak
But your touch is just so real it's intoxicating
I'm so done with being a little possessed
But your love is just so fresh it's intoxicating
I'm not done with being your friend on a streak
But your touch is just so real it's intoxicating
