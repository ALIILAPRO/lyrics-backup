		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love you, baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you, baby
To warm these lonely nights
I love you, baby
Trust in me when I say

I love you, baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you, baby
To warm these lonely nights
I love you, baby
Trust in me when I say

I love you
I love you

I love you, baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you, baby
To warm these lonely nights
I love you, baby
Trust in me when I say

I love you, baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you, baby
To warm these lonely nights
I love you, baby
Trust in me when I say

I love you

I love you, baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you, baby
To warm these lonely nights
I love you, baby
Trust in me when I say

I love you
I love you

I love you, baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you, baby
To warm these lonely nights
I love you, baby
Trust in me when I say

I love you, baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you, baby
To warm these lonely nights
I love you, baby
Trust in me when I say
