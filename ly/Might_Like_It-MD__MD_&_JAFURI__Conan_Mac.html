		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Verse 1:
I don't trust no I don't trust anybody
When I play best I can't see my cards
You don't want no don't just want anybody
But when did waiting ever get you far?
 
Pre-Chorus:
We're playing through
And mixing the wrong up with the right
Who knew it's you that I wanted?
 
Had to give it a try just one night
Who knew who knew we might
Might like it
 
Drop:
Da da da da daaa daaaaa
Might might we might like it
Da da da da daaa daaaaa
Who knew that we might
Da da da da daaa daaaaa
Who knew that we might
 
 
Verse 2:
We don't think no we don't think twice about it
Opposite minds attract every time
You go I go we go crash every party
Who knows if we'll make it through the night
 
Pre-Chorus:
We're playing through
And mixing the wrong up with the right
Who knew it's you that I wanted?
 
Had to give it a try just one night
Who knew who knew we might
We might like it
 
Drop:
Da da da da daaa daaaaa
Might might we might like it
Da da da da daaa daaaaa
Who knew that we might
Da da da da daaa daaaaa
Who knew that we might
 
Bridge:
A bit of wrong with a bit of right
It's you I wanted
A bit of wrong with a bit of right
Who knew we might
We might like it
 
Drop:
Mmmm mmmm mmmmm
Might might we might like it
Mmmm mmmm mmmmm
Who knew that we might
