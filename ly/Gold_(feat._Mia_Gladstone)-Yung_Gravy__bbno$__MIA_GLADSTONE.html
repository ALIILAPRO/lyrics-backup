		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Gravy Train) uh, bbno$
Yo, Yung Gravy ​bbno$

Finessin' yo' mommy when I'm in the kitchen
Speedin' my whippin' whippin' the lyrical
Gravy fall out of this chicken
Why is he bitchin'? Really about business
Pushin' 'bout couple of digit's
Stussy boy standin' the corner, yeah
Spinnin' that fidget
Thought he lookin' like a midget
Put you on grill, I put you on skillet

Gold bitch, gold wrist
Gold bitch, gold wrist
Gold bitch, gold wrist
Don't play with no brass
Gold bitch, gold wrist
Gold bitch, gold wrist
Gold bitch, gold wrist
Don't play with no brass
Golden, golden, golden
Golden, gold, yeah yeah yeah
Ice cold and gold in the summer
I flex on another, froze

Gold things got me blindsided
I'm switchin' for the gas, I'm a hybrid
Four ladies for the two boys
Baby Gravy, I divide it
Ladies like our tracks more than yours
Gentle woman, why she took my drawers?
Middle of the summer, neck be cold
Baby Gravy, truth be told
Fake gold but I still wear it
Take a flight, please declare it
Run up on you with my nerf like a sheriff
Lady, stop starin' 你好，再見
這是另一天 ten hoes on me like Ben
Yung Baby, Yung Gravy we did it again

Finessin' yo' mommy when I'm in the kitchen
Speedin' my whippin' whippin' the lyrical
Gravy fall out of this chicken
Why is he bitchin'? Really about business
Pushin' 'bout couple of digit's
Stussy boy standin' the corner, yeah
Spinnin' that fidget
Thought he lookin' like a midget
Put you on grill, I put you on skillet

Gold bitch, gold wrist
Gold bitch, gold wrist
Gold bitch, gold wrist
Don't play with no brass
Gold bitch, gold wrist
Gold bitch, gold wrist
Gold bitch, gold wrist
Don't play with no brass

Golden, golden, golden
Golden, gold, yeah yeah yeah
Ice cold and gold in the summer
I flex on another, froze

Got a bitch named Becky and
A bitch named Necky
Pull up in the club, pocket full of Dos Equis
Roundhouse kick motherfucker, don't test me
Bakin' this bread with
My motherfuckin' bestie
Yeah, that's cute and we gettin' that loot
Gravy train comin' through bitch, toot toot
Took yo' bitch and you thought it was a fluke
But I did that shit again
In a brand new coupe
That's crazy, brazy, do this shit daily
Gravy witcha' lady in the
Back of the Mercedes say goodbye to Katy
Posted up with Baby it's easy, motherfucker
Make a bitch feel wavy wavy like a lake
Hunnids need a rake bitch that I take on
Get a nice steak
Trade a little gravy for a little bit of cake
Every single day for goodness sake

Finessin' yo' mommy when I'm in the kitchen
Speedin' my whippin' whippin' the lyrical
Gravy fall out of this chicken
Why is he bitchin'? Really about business
Pushin' 'bout couple of digit's
Stussy boy standin' the corner, yeah
Spinnin' that fidget
Thought he lookin' like a midget
Put you on grill, I put you on skillet

Gold bitch, gold wrist
Gold bitch, gold wrist
Gold bitch, gold wrist
Don't play with no brass
Gold bitch, gold wrist
Gold bitch, gold wrist
Gold bitch, gold wrist
Don't play with no brass
