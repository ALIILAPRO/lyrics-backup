		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What are you gonna tell her this time
When you slip away tonight
When you start lyin'
I end up cryin'
It keeps reminding me that this ain't right

What's she thinkin' when she calls you
And there's no answer once again
It makes me so blue
Wish I didn't love you
I wish that I could only be your friend

It's a liar's game
When we have to worry
I don't know where to place the blame
When we turn out the light
Pretend that it's alright
There's no denying it's a liar's game

Every night you make the same plan
You lie to her and come to me
When you start lyin'
There's no denyin'
It's finally time to set you free

It's a liar's game
When we have to worry
I don't know where to place the blame
When we turn out the light
Pretend that it's alright
There's no denying it's a liar's game

There's no denying it's a liar's game
