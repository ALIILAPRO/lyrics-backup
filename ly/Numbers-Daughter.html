		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take the worst situations
Make a worse situation
Follow me home, pretend you
Found somebody to mend you

I feel numb
I feel numb in this kingdom
I feel numb
I feel numb in this kingdom

Can you clean lace faces?
Black out nights and tight spaces?
We'll feel distant embraces
Scratching hands 'round my waist, yeah
I wish my mouth would still taste you

I feel numb
I feel numb in this kingdom
I feel numb
I feel numb in this kingdom

I feel numb
I feel numb in this kingdom
I feel numb
I feel numb in this kingdom

You better, you better, you better
You better make me
Me better, me better
You better make me better

You better, you better, you better
You better make me
Me better, me better
You better make me better

You better, you better, you better
You better make me
Me better, me better
You better make me better

You better, you better, you better
You better make me
Me better, me better
You better make me better

I feel numb, make me better
I feel numb in this kingdom
I feel numb, make me better
I feel numb in this kingdom

I feel numb in this kingdom
I feel numb in this kingdom
I feel numb in this kingdom
I feel numb in this kingdom
