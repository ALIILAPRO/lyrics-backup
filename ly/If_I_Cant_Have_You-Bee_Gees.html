		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't know why
I'm surviving every lonely day
When there's got to be
No chance for me

My life would end
And it don't matter how I cry
My tears of love
Are a waste of time
If I turn away

Am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do

If I can't have you
I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, oh oh oh

Can't let go
And it doesn't matter how I try
I gave it all so easily
To you my love

To dreams that never will come true
Am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do

If I can't have you
I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, oh oh oh

If I can't have you
I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, oh oh oh

If I can't have you
I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, oh oh oh

If I can't have you
I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, oh oh oh
