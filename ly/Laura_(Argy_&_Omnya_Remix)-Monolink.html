		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Laura's alone 
Out in the yard
Waiting for someone to play
With her broken heart
But the others inside
They're all still asleep
She's got plenty to hide
She's got nothing to keep

So take me down your haunted path
And lead me into the dark
You've got no way to tear my heart apart
But sure you've got a way to make it start.
