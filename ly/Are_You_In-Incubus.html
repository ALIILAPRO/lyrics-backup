		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  It's so much better
When everyone is in
Are you in?
It's so much better
When everyone is in
Are you in?

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Are you in?
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Are you in?

It's so much better
When everyone is in
Are you in?
It's so much easier
When seafoam green is in fashion

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Are you in?
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Are you in?

Are you, are you, are you, are you
Are you, are you, are you, are you
Are you, are you, are you, are you
Are you, are you, are you, are you

Oh-oh-oh (are you, are you, are you, are you)
Oh-oh-oh (are you, are you, are you, are you)
Oh-oh-oh (are you, are you, are you, are you)
Oh no, oh-oh, no

Are-are you in
Are-are, are
You, you, i-i-in

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Are you in?
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
