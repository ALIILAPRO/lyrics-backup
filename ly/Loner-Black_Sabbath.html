		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He's just a loner
He never says hello
A friend to no one
He's got no place to go

He don't look happy
He look through furtive eyes
He ain't got nothing
No one to sympathize
Alright now

He hides himself away
His secrets not revealed
As life just passes by he keeps himself concealed

A solitary man
An enigmatic child
A riddle never solved
A prisoner exiled
Alright now

I wonder if the loner can assimilate
A life less lived alone plays devil's advocate
C'mon now

Has he ever tried to be happy?
Reached out from inside
Someone on who he can depend
It's getting to late to recover
He won't stand a chance and into his own hell he'll descend
Don't descend
Don't descend
Don't descend
Don't descend

No understanding of things we already know
He has to live his life and just learn how to let go
Alright yeah

Communication's an impossibility
His own best friend but he's his own worst enemy
The secrets of his past locked deep inside his head
I wonder if he will be happy when he's dead
C'mon yeah
