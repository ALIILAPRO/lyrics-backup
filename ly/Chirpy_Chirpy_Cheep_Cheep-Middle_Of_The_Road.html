		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where's your mama gone? 
(Where's your mama gone?)
Little baby Don 
(Little baby Don)
Where's your mama gone? 
(Where's your mama gone?)
Far, far away

Where's your papa gone? 
(Where's your papa gone?)
Little baby Don 
(Little baby Don)
Where's your papa gone? 
(Where's your papa gone?)
Far, far away
Far, far away

Last night, I heard my mama singing a song
Ooh-we, chirpy, chirpy, cheep, cheep
Woke up this morning and my mama was gone
Ooh-we, chirpy, chirpy, cheep, cheep
Chirpy, chirpy, cheep, cheep, chirp

Where's your mama gone? 
(Where's your mama gone?)
Little baby Don 
(Little baby Don)
Where's your mama gone? 
(Where's your mama gone?)
Far, far away

Where's your papa gone? 
(Where's your papa gone?)
Little baby Don 
(Little baby Don)
Where's your papa gone?
(Where's your papa gone?)
Far, far away
Far, far away

Last night, I heard my mama singing a song
Ooh-we, chirpy, chirpy, cheep, cheep
Woke up this morning and my mama was gone
Ooh-we, chirpy, chirpy, cheep, cheep
Chirpy, chirpy, cheep, cheep, chirp

Let's go now

Last night, I heard my mama singing a song
Ooh-we, chirpy, chirpy, cheep, cheep
Woke up this morning and my mama was gone
Ooh-we, chirpy, chirpy, cheep, cheep
Chirpy, chirpy, cheep, cheep, chirp

Altogether now

Last night, I heard my mama singing a song
Ooh-we, chirpy, chirpy, cheep, cheep
Woke up this morning and my mama was gone
Ooh-we, chirpy, chirpy, cheep, cheep
Chirpy, chirpy, cheep, cheep, chirp

One more time now
Last night, I heard my mama singing a song
Ooh-we, chirpy, chirpy, cheep, cheep
Woke up this morning and my mama was gone
Ooh-we, chirpy, chirpy, cheep, cheep
Chirpy, chirpy, cheep, cheep, chirp

Let me hear y'all sing it now

Last night, I heard my mama singing a song
Ooh-we, chirpy, chirpy, cheep, cheep
Woke up this morning and my mama
