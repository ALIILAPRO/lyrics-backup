		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You came into my life without a single thing
I gave into your ways which left me with nothing
I've given into smiles, I fell for all your games
I wish so bad right now, I hadn't let you in

Won't you get the fuck out of my face now?
Won't you get the fuck out of my face now?

The sea of life, you're just a minnow
Live your life insecure
Feel the pain of your needles
As they shit into my brain

I scream without a sound, how could you take away
Everything that I was? Made me a fucking slave
Your face that I despise, your heart inside that's gray
I came today to say, "You're fucked in every way"

Won't you get the fuck out of my face now?
Won't you get the fuck out of my face now?

The sea of life, you're just a minnow
Live your life insecure
Feel the pain of your needles
As they shit into my mind
You stole my life
Without a sign
You sucked me dry

Won't you get the fuck out of my face now?
Won't you get the fuck out of my face now?
Won't you get the fuck out of my face now?
Won't you get the fuck out of my face now?

Won't you get the fuck out of my face now?
Won't you get the fuck out of my face now?
Won't you get the fuck out of my face now?
Won't you get the fuck out of my face now?

The sea of life, you're just a minnow
Live your life insecure
Feel the pain of your needles
As they shit into my mind
You stole my life
Without a sign
You sucked me dry
