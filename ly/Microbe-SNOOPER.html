		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't get off my cell phone 
And I just bought a drone
Don't want to get too hurt 
Stay home on high alert
Guess my best friends a clone 
Were in the danger zone 
Better stay inside my room 
And wait for the sonic boom
 
Get out and drive your car 
Cant get very far 
Nothing in the world to do 
But stay inside and think of you
 
Tv makes me panic 
Whole city is volcanic 
Tell me I have to stay 
 
At home in my bathroom
Scared of a microbe 
Listen to the research 
 
Get out and drive your car 
Can't go very far 
Nothing in the world to do 
But stay inside and think of you 
 
Tired of video games 
Starting to go insane 
Stuck in the danger zone 
 
Please use good protection 
Bad time for infection 
Wonder what will happen 
 
Get out and drive your car 
Cant go very far 
Nothing in the world to do 
But stay inside and think of you
