		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can catch me in the cherry red 150
Got the Glizzy locked in the stizzy
Pop the clizzy, goin' 60 down the one-wizzy
Drunk pissy, tryin' to cruise through the avenue
While my peoples is poppin' bottles up in Sue's Rendevous
Fuck that, spun a U-ey, lost a hubcap
It's back to the shack, came back in a, "What's that?"
Straight from Paris, checkin' Gaby's new baby carriage
Perry Ellis (nice), auburn cherry reddish
Fresh out the dealer, got the TEC for the squealers
Wear a vest for the killers, nothin' less 'cause it's realer
In the Big Apple, where it's quick to get your shit tackled
Enemies spit at you, best friends kidnap you
Trust no one (uh-uh), got beef? Bust your gun (yeah)
You don't need no one (nope) talkin' 'bout that you owe him
I'm a go for dolo, Scarface without Manolo
One deep I be solo, bustin' heat throwin' bolos, it's hard

And it's so hard (it's hard work, baby)
Yeah (I just lost a hundred pounds, I'm tryin' to live, I ain't goin' nowhere)
Niggas wanna be like Pun (I'm stayin' alive, baby)
But they don't bust they guns
And it's so hard (that's my wife, I paid for them titties)
(Get your own, your own, ya heard?)
Niggas wanna fuck my wife
Niggas wanna take my life
But it's so hard

Rollin' with the squad, we like Gods
Catch us at the bar-de-bar-de-bars, strip bars in Miami
Almost came home with the Grammy
Next year, bringin' home three for the family
Watch me, you can catch it live on Hitachi
Poppin' shit like a Nazi, iced out like DeBiase
Fuck that, Liberace
4X Versace, somebody stop me
Never that (skee-yu), where my niggas at?
Uptown, uptown, you know you feelin' that
Cash rule, hardcore you can dance to
That old Biggie give me (one more chance)
Take a glance then I'm off with yours
With both hands take off my drawers and jerk me like the Source Awards
I love hip hop
I ain't even probably the best lyricist alive
Terror Squad, nigga stop sleepin'

What you say your name was again?
And I know you from where? Elementary school?
Niggas wanna be like Pun (I don't know you, man)
But they don't bust they guns
And it's so hard (money, not you again, go that way)
Niggas wanna fuck my wife (loser)
Niggas wanna take my life
But it's so hard

Ooh, yeah
You ain't fuckin' my wife, takin' my life
And if you just hating, just walk on by
All you haters, just walk on by
