		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Words like violence
Break the silence
Come crashing in
Into my little world
Painful to me
Pierce right through me
Can't you understand?
Oh, my little one

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Vows are spoken to be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
