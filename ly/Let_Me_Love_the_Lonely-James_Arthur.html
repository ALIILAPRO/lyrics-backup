		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You laugh at all the jokes
Even the ones you know
Funny I'm doing that, too
Alone in a crowded room
The one string that's out of tune
Trust me, I feel like that, too

Let me love the lonely out of you
Let me love the pain you're going through
I think I'll save myself by saving you
Let me love the lonely out of you

Lighthouse without the lights
You smile without your eyes
I know, 'cause I do that too
Your own worst enemy
You think that no one sees
I do, 'cause I'm like that too

Let me love the lonely out of you
Let me love the pain you're going through
I think I'll save myself by saving you
Let me love the lonely out of you

Oh, we can light a fire to warm our bones, yeah
This world is much too cold to sleep alone

Let me love the lonely out of you
Let me love the pain you're going through
I think I'll save myself by saving you
Let me love the lonely out of you

Let me love the lonely out of you
Let me love the pain you're going through
Think I'll save myself by saving you
Let me love the lonely out of you
