		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't need to know what you're happens
Baby when you're never on the time, no no no
You just sit there feeling sorry for yourself
On the phone

You wanna love me nobody else but
You wanna love me nobody else like
But I know deep down that
You really feel the same yeah, yeah
But I know that I'm never gonna see the day

Stop, hold bring me a little closer, baby
I'm hot, cold
Don't you miss us kissing, baby? I get old
All the days you're missing
You won't get me giving my heart

Nobody else like you nobody else like you
Nobody else like you nobody else like you

I don't think you baby
Definitely not anymore, no no
Imagination part of what a simple past
I bet you wish I never asked

You wanna love me nobody else but
You wanna love me nobody else like
But I know deep down that
You really feel the same yeah, yeah
But I know that I'm never gonna see the day

Stop, hold bring me a little closer, baby
I'm hot, cold
Don't you miss us kissing, baby? I get old
All the days you're missing
You won't get me giving my heart

Nobody else like you nobody else like you
Nobody else like you nobody else like you

Nobody else like you

Stop, hold bring it a little closer, baby
I'm hot, cold
Don't you miss us kissing, baby? I get old
All the days you're missing
You won't get me giving my heart

Nobody else like you nobody else like you
Nobody else like you nobody else like you
Nobody else like you nobody else like you
Nobody else like you
