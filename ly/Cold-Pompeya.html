		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If only I could find myself
One more time with you
You
I’m sending out messages
Long time overdue
To you
Traveling the cities
Going places
Alone
But I won’t need it
When I’ll find my place
To call
A home

So how do you feel?
How is your day?
How was the trip?
What was on your way?

If only I could prove myself
As a decent man
Man
I may deviate
But then I’ll start it again
Again
Why don’t you wanna
Be my lover
And friend?
I kissed you once
I wanna do it again

So how do you feel?
How is your day?
How was the trip?
What was on your way?

What’s on your mind?
Who do you love?
What do you need?
Why is the cold?

Somewhat sorry for what you did
Somewhat sorry for what you did
Somewhat sorry for what you did
Somewhat sorry for what you did
