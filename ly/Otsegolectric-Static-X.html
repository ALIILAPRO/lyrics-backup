		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You sold yourself
You sold yourself
You sold your soul
You make your hell
Cross this line, you waste away
Steal and cheat, all day

Otsegolectric

What is mine, I'm electric
Face staring, back at me
Cross this line, you are sick
You are sick, I know it

Otsegolectric

Screaming, scratching
Pounding
Giving, getting
Through me
Crawling, balling
Falling
Giving into
Sinning

Take all day, suck all day
Worm away, turn away
You are sick, I know it
You are sick, you are sick
