		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feel the pressure rise
Hear the whistle blow
Bought a ticket of her own accord
To, I don't know

Packed your heart in a travellin' bag
And never said bye bye
Something missing in the neighborhood
Of her cryin' eyes

I stirred my coffee with the same spoon
Knew her favorite tune
Gone shootin'
My baby's gone shootin'

Wrapped herself around
Like a second skin
Backed her favorite nag
But she could never win
I took an offer in another town
She took another pill
She was runnin' in an overdrive
A victim of overkill

She never made it past the bedroom door
What was she aiming for?

Gone shootin'
She's gone
Gone, gone, gone

Gone shootin'
My baby's gone shootin'
Look out, woo
(Gone shootin') How am I gonna get her down?
(Gone shootin') Ow, look out, look out, look out
(Gone shootin') I shouldn't get in her way
(Gone shootin') Ah, she sure is loaded
(Gone shootin') She's gone, gone, gone, gone, she's gone
(Gone shootin')

I used to love her so
