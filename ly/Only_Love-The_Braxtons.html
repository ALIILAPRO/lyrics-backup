		  Chorus

                  I'm over you somehow
                  Only love knows how
                  I have the strength to move on again
                  The more you put me down
                  "Cause love knows how
                  It gave me the strength to move on

                  Verse I

                  Spent so many days wondering what's
                  my chances
                  I never thought I'd be alone
                  When all I really needed was anwers
                  For the love that you've given to me
                  (the love you give to me)
                  I was in need
                  Where we are where we're at
                  Boy I could not see
                  Every night (every night)
                  That I cry (that I cry)
                  I needed you here by my side
                  But now I'm over you

                  Chorus

                  Verse 2

                  Had to use my mind
                  Couldn't use my heart
                  I didn't want to see us apart
                  This vision is so clear to me
                  That we were not meant to be
                  (that we were not meant to be)
                  I couldn't see
                  The desire inside wouldn't let me be
                  Every night (every night)
                  That I cry (that I cry)
                  I needed you here by my side
                  But now I'm over you

                  Chorus

                  Bridge

                  Life goes on until the new beginning
                  (ooh ahh ahh)
                  Set me free from all of these feelings
                  Now I can see that love's no guarantee
                  (ooh ahh ahh)
                  That's why I hold it all inside of me

                  Chorus

                  Only love knows how (knows how)
                  Knows how
                  Only love knows how (knows how)
                  Knows how
