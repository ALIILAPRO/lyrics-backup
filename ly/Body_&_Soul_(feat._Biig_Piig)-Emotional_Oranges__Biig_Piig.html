		<p>
		  Yeah, let me tell you 'bout this fireplace
That we're gonna lay in front of
And roast marshmallows and orange and shit

I got questions
What's your motive?
Let me prove to you (talk your shit)
I can take it
Never folding
All I want's the truth (okay)
You can keep on playing games
You'll realize too soon (hahaha)
There's no love like me, baby (woo)

I can see you're ready to hold (yeah)
(Girl, I'll tell you what it is)
Tell me if you wanna let go, baby (yeah)
It's the way you make me feel so
(Yeah, I think I'll let you in)
Wanna see what you've got to show, baby (you, you, you, you)

Take you back to my place
Love you by the fireplace (you, you, you, you)
Girl, what you want from me? (So what you want from me? Huh?)
Your body and soul
I just need that one thing
Hold me down with your embrace
Like it's supposed to be (you, you, you, you)
Your body and soul

Oh-oh, oh
Ah-ah, ah
And I want your body and soul

Pass that blunt, let shit burn
You gotta grab on what you want
Hit and run, when we gon' learn? (yeah)
Make him wait this time, yeah
Before things fall apart
Just guard your broken heart
Get what you need
Fuck the other shit 
He can beg for it, yeah

I can see you're ready to go
(Girl, I'll tell you what it is)
Tell me if you want me to come over
Just the way you make me feel so
(Yeah, I think I'll let you in)
Wanna see what you got to show, baby (yeah)

Take you back to my place
Love you by the fireplace (you, you, you, you)
Girl, what you want from me? (So what you want from me? Huh?)
Your body and soul
I just need that one thing
Hold me down with your embrace
Like it's supposed to be (you, you, you, you)
Your body and soul

You know
It's a real cold night in Los Angeles (you, you, you, you)
So I'ma need you to make me a warm dinner (and I want your body and soul)
Set that lighting real nice
Light up your fireplace and you know (you, you, you, you)
Maybe I'll give you what you want (and I want your body and soul)
