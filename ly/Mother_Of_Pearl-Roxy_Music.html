		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Turn the lights down (way down low)
Turn up the music (hi as fi can go)
All the gang's here (everyone you know)
It's a crazy scene (hey there just look over your shoulder)
Get the picture?

No no no no (Yes)
Walk a tightrope (your life-sign-line)
Such a bright hope (right place, right time)
What's your number?(never you mind)

Take a powder (but hang on a minute what's coming round the corner?)
Have you a future?
No no no no (yes)

Well I've been up all night again
Party-time wasting is too much fun
Then I step back thinking
Of life's inner meaning
And my latest fling
It's the same old story
All love and glory
It's a pantomime

If you're looking for love
In a looking glass world
It's pretty hard to find
Oh mother of pearl
I wouldn't trade you
For another girl
Divine intervention
Always my intention
So I take my time

I've been looking for something
I've always wanted
But was never mine
But now I've seen that something
Just out of reach, glowing 
Very Holy grail
Oh mother of pearl
Lustrous lady
Of a sacred world

Thus, even Zarathustra
Another-time-loser
Could believe in you
With every goddess a let down
Every idol a bring down
It gets you down
But the search for perfection
Your own predilection
Goes on and on and on and on
Canadian Club love
A place in the Country
Everyone's ideal

But you are my favorita
And a place in your heart dear
Makes me feel more real
Oh mother of pearl
I wouldn't change you
For the whole world
You're highbrow, holy
With lots of soul

Melancholy shimmering
Serpentine sleekness
Was always my weakness
Like a simple tune
But no dilettante
Filigree fancy

Beats the plastic you
Career girl cover
Exposed and another
Slips right into-view
Oh looking for love
In a looking glass world
Is pretty hard for you
Few throwaway kisses
The boomerang misses
Spin round and round
Fall on featherbed quilted
Faced with silk

Softly stuffed eider down
Take refuge in pleasure
Just give me your future
We'll forget your past
Oh mother of pearl
Submarine lover

In a shrinking world
Oh lonely dreamer
Your choker provokes
A picture cameo
Oh mother of pearl
So so semi-precious
In your detached world
Oh mother of pearl
I wouldn't trade you
For another girl

Oh mother of pearl
I wouldn't trade you
For another girl

Oh mother of pearl
I wouldn't trade you
For another girl

Oh mother of pearl
I wouldn't trade you
For another girl

Oh mother of pearl
I wouldn't trade you
For another girl

Oh mother of pearl
I wouldn't trade you
For another girl
