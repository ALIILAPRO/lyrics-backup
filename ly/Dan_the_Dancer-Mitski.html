		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dan had very long limbs
From leading day to day
Hanging onto a cliff
That stretched him everyday
And when she'd ask to hold hands
He would smile and
Let one of his hands go
His whole life in one hand
His whole life

And when he'd say goodnight and
Leave her doorstep
He'd use his last strength
To wave back
And once back in his room
Once back in his room
He'd return his waving hand
Back to its cliff
He liked her more than life itself
I'm sure

'Cause Dan had never danced outside of his room
When no one was home and he would start to hear the door
So when he moved with you
And felt his body let go
Of course you couldn't know
It was you and you alone
That he had shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
And he would never tell you that it was his first time
