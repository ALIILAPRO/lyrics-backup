		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Perhaps you've not known before
To need someone and not be needed anymore
I know nobody's to blame
My tongue's still papercut speaking your name

Perhaps you don't understand
When I want you to care but now my world's in your hands
What am I supposed to do
Pretend I'm happy for you?

Waited all day to cry
Now I'm here my eyes are dry
Couldn't help you in the end
Don't know what I was looking to mend

Perhaps you've not sung a song
Of seeing yourself to every way come up wrong
The world can't hurt me no more
When I'm the very best at making myself sore
