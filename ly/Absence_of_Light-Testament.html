		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Life, as we know
Is full of gloom
Oppress the masses
We'll lead to our doom
We want the right
To live or die
Can't take away
What we feel inside

Like empty shadows
Afflict our brains
Envision dreams
Just to ease the pain
There's more to life
Than to satisfy
I ask myself
For the reason why

If it were my way
I'd deliver us from this hell
If it were my way

If ever there comes a day
Renovations blown away
Is there no end
To this endless war
The fear of man
Is now what's in store
We look at life as a memory
Long live the dreams
That they took from me

If it were my way
I'd deliver us from this hell
If it were my way
