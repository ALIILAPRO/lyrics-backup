		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Betwixt and between the fantasy dream and the fear
Do you wonder where she is this afternoon?
And does it get on your nerves, make it slightly perturbed
That there's things that you don't know about her
And even the places that she's never been with you
Seem awful empty without her

You can look into those eyes
Down no telephone line
What if you were right the first time?

You can look into those eyes
Down no telephone line
What if you were right the first time?

Betwixt and between the fantasy dream and the fear
Do you wonder where she is this afternoon?
And with the needle in groove, is there all to prove
And tell me are your feet still tapping?
I know there's a first for a trip over the water
What is the worst that could happen?

You can look into those eyes
Down no telephone line
What if you were right the first time?
