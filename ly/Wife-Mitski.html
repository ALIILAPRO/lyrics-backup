		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're home, you're home, you're home to me
So leave me, leave me, leave me a map
I'm here at my cliff looking down

I cannot bear you a son
But I will try
For if I am not yours, what am I?
I daydream I'd give one a name of my own
For I, even I, even I am on loan

I have, I have, I watch a dream breaking
Breaking, breaking, breaking me
Away from my cliff, I am looking down from

I cannot bear you a son
I have tried
But if I am not yours, what am I?
I daydream I'd give him a name of my own
For I, even mine, even mine is unknown

So let me go towards the morning star
With hope it won't disappear
