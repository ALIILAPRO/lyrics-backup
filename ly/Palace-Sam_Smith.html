		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My head is filled with ruins
Most of them are built with you
Now the dust no longer moves
Don't disturb the ghost of you
Mmm

They are empty, they are worn
Tell me what we built this for
On my way to something more
You're that one I can't ignore
Mmm

I'm gonna miss you
I still care
Sometimes I wish we never built this palace
But real love is never a waste of time
Mmm

Yeah I know just what you're saying
And I regret ever complaining
About this heart and all its breaking
It was beauty we were making
Mmm

And I know we'll both move on
You'll forgive what I did wrong
They will love the better you
But I still own the ghost of you
Mmm

I'm gonna miss you
I'm still there
Sometimes I wish we never built this palace
But real love is never a waste of time

I'm gonna miss you
I'm still there
Sometimes I wish we never built this palace
But real love is never a waste of time
But real love is never a waste of time
