		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Aye
Riding thru the city Ion ever give a fuck doin coke 
Right right off her titties mane I'm finna roll a blunt 
Money stacked up the ceiling i can't even see yo bluff 
Boy you acting outta pocket might just have to sew you up

Fuck that just run it back catching dough like a running back
Flow sick fuck heaven sent ima cut up yo reverend
Face itchy I can't stop fucking w all this medicine
Fuck hoes I DONT need a bitch I need me more Benjamin's

Yeah I need to smoke before I eat or else I'm sick asf
Ain't no fucking w the enemy you dead to me that tough
No designer on my body All my money covered up
All you rappers ain't about it you just makin the same song

I been stepping over grass can't be fucking w no snake

Aye lil shawty think she bad
I ain't eating no used plate

Yea I'm always fucking mad
And I hate see your face

I ain't running thru yo bag I'm just tryna stack my cake

Yeah it's wave bitch
Fuck the strap get clapped with my blade bitch
Aim the holo lose my morals
Let that bitch go ape shit
Fafafa my bullets bouta eat a fuckin eat racist
Fuck yo beef we gonna catch yo body beat the cases
Bumboi killed this shit and I walked up and bodied too
Pull up to your mom crib like shawdy what it fuckin do
Kickin it back sippin on lemonade
My ops fucking mad that i get steady paid
