		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name

And do I dream again?
For now I find
The phantom of the opera
Is there inside my mind

Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you
Grows stronger yet

And though you turn from me
To glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera
Is there inside your mind

Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear
It's me they hear
Your spirit and my voice (my spirit and your voice)
In one combined
The Phantom of the Opera
Is there inside my mind (your mind)

He's there, the Phantom of the Opera
He's there, the Phantom of the Opera

Sing, my angel of music
Sing, my angel
Sing for me
Sing
Sing, my angel
Sing forme
