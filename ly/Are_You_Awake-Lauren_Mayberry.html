		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you awake? I've been thinkin' through some things
Been countin' their babies and their diamond wedding rings
Are you awake? I feel a sadness in my skin
It happens sometimes now
Are you awake? I don't remember when we last spoke
I probably overshared or made some tasteless joke
Are you awake? I miss the streetlights and the smoke
It happens sometimes now

Please, give me a sign
Give me a Hollywood line
Some feelings don't fade away with space and time
It's a state of mind
It's just a state of mind

Hometown hero is a poisoned chalice choice
If they don't love you you're just destined to disappoint
Are you awake? I miss the texture of your voice
It happens more often now

Please, give me a sign
Give me a Hollywood line
Some feelings don't fade away with space and time
It's a state of mind
It's just a state of mind

Some of the feelings fade with space and time
It's a state of mind
It's just a state of mind
It's just a state of mind
