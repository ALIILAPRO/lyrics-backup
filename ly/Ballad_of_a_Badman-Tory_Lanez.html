		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, you got me
Ooh, you got me
Ooh, you got me
Ooh, you got me

You have to leave, just stay for a while
The longer you stay, the better the time
You listen to your friends, they lie
I don't mind, I don't mind
Feelin's get caught up in the mind
A shootin' star pass by my eye
When I don't know just what to do
She won't blow my high

Don't you stop turnin' me on (ooh, you got me)
I wanna feel like this all night long (ooh, you got me)
Don't you stop turnin' me on (don't you stop turnin' me on)
I wanna feel like this all night long (feel like this all night long, yeah)

Turnin' me on
All night, night, long (oh yeah)

You wanna stay, just stay for long
'Cause you got the sweetest touch I know
You might just dance with them other guys
But I don't mind, I know you're mine
I don't care just what they say
Lovin' you long takes the pain away
So when you look me in my eyes
Will you take some time?

Don't you stop turnin' me on (ooh, you got me)
I wanna feel like this all night long (ooh, you got me)
Don't you stop turnin' me on (don't you stop turnin' me on)
I wanna feel like this all night long (feel like this all night long)

Turnin' me on

It's just, I can't fight this feelin' (all night, night, long)
Woah, oh-oh, ooh-woah, yeah
Ooh-woah, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah
I can't fight this feelin'
Woah, ooh-woah, oh, woah, ooh, yeah
Don't fight this feelin'
Don't fight this feelin'
ooh-woah, ooh-ooh, woah, oh

Don't you stop turnin' me on (don't you stop turnin' me on, ooh, you got me)
I wanna feel like this all night long (like this for oh, like this for oh so long)
Don't you stop turnin' me on (don't you stop turnin' me on)
I wanna feel like this all night long (feel like this all night long)
Don't you stop turnin' me on (turnin' me on)
I wanna feel like this all night long (all night, night long)
Don't you stop turnin' me on (ooh, you got me)
I wanna feel like this all night long (ooh, you got me)
Don't you stop turnin' me on (don't you stop turnin' me on, ooh, you got me)
I wanna feel like this all night long (all night, night long, ooh, you got me)

Don't you stop turnin' me on (ooh, you got me)
Feel like this all night long (ooh, you got me)
Don't you stop turnin' me on (ooh, you got me)
Feel like this all night long (ooh, you got me)
