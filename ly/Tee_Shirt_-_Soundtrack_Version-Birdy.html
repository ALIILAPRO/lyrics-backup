		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the morning when you wake up
I like to believe you are thinking of me
And when the sun comes through your window
I like to believe you've been dreaming of me

Dreaming

I know
'Cause I'd spend half this morning
Thinking about the t-shirt you sleep in

I should know
'Cause I'd spend all the whole day
Listening to your message I'm keeping
And never deleting

When I saw you
Everyone knew
I liked the effect that you had on my eyes

But no one else heard
The weight of your words
Or felt the effect that they have on my mind

Falling

I know
'Cause I'd spend half this morning
Thinking about the t-shirt you sleep in

I should know
'Cause I'd spend all the whole day
Listening to your message I'm keeping
And never deleting
