		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No love for my love 
No glance to steal
No thrill from my touch
It kills me to feel the ghost 
Of what we once embraced

There's no tell in your face, although I can tell
There's no talk on your lips, just the taste of his
And the gall it took to boast while you burned our bridges down

I know how all of this goes before the words come tumbling out
I've felt the pain that you gave in spades
But I'll go to the end of the earth if it means I end up with you
I'll cross the distance you aim to create

No love from your love
No kiss and tell
No fucks to give, love
Just one last farewell in the form of a fragile poem
That promptly turns to dust

I know how all of this goes before the words come tumbling out
I've felt the pain that you give in spades
But I'll go to the end of the earth if it means I end up with you
I'll cross the distance you aim to create
Framed as last goodbyes

24/7, 24/7, 24/7, I hate my love for you
24/7, 24/7, 24/7, I hate my love for you
24/7, 24/7, 24/7, I hate my love for you
24/7, 24/7, 24/7, 24/7

I know how all of this goes before the words come tumbling out
I've felt the pain that you give in spades
But I'll go to the end of the earth if it means I end up with you
I'll cross the distance you aim to create framed as a last goodbye
