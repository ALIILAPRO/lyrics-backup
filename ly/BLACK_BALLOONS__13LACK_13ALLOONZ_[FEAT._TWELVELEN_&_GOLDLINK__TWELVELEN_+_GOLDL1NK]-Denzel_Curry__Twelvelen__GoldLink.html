		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hot pink, Valentine red
Black balloons, over my head
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me

Inside this paper plane
Note my words are Navy sealed so here and I quote
Taboo and I are in the same boat
What's said from Pennywise, I guess we all float
Sky is the limit, I could die in a minute
Got my mind in a skillet, suicide not the mission
See the vibe very timid, I'm timid and very sad
Translated my thoughts and feelings I pivot into the pad
Rapers turn to landscapers when they use hoes
Hoes turn to housewives when they see gold
Ice Cube with activator when I'm aggravated
Or decapitated when I lose my head since life is overrated
Ten thousand feet, a thousand steps
I let it all sink to a thousand depths
Soon black balloons pop
That'll be the day the pain stops

Hot pink, Valentine red
Black balloons, over my head
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Hot pink, Valentine red
Black balloons, over my head
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me

Heaven or Hell, huh, which one prevails, huh?
We gotta go and figure it out
I ain't tryna tell you that this life isn't it
And I just wanna be the rightest I could be
Show my son to think so he could fly as high could be
Always show examples how they kill niggas like me
Thinking as straight as me, but call me crazy
Sign is my attitude, so I'm cool like JAY-Z
Andele, andele, my intelligence for threes
Cancel me like I ain't the King of D.C
Cancel me like I ain't the number one G
Cancel me like you don't like "Dance On Me"
Quickly they forget how you changed on these lies
You flashing on these lights and you savin' these kids life
And they hate you 'cause you're right, give me hell then, shit
Take your turn and fire with a pitchfork, bitch

Hot pink, Valentine red
Black balloons, over my head
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Hot pink, Valentine red
Black balloons, over my head
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me

Tonight on 102.1, it's Denny Cascade and the gang and
Denzel, are you really like Kenobal?
I'm telling you, eventually, they're gonna catch up to your game
We're running out of time!
What exactly are you trying to hide, Mr. Curry?
