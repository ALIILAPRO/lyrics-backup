		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  From a little light of love,
I was born and then my cry,
My cry was a little light of love
For the honoring of life.
And the pharaohs of my soul
Is this light of love.
Precious little light of love.

There's a candle burning on
In the breezy shades of night.
I keep up my faith
And understand my whole
To call the love of light.
A treasure, your shaman,
In the middle of the shady day that
Brings on a field of light
In a light of love.
There a light of love.

Only one religion
Will lead us to the love
We aim for.
Over the dark illusions
Of the warring nations.

And when a figure leads the power,
The destruction glorified.
And when the war is nearly over,
How come the leader's held in high honors?
"Won't you die for their lie?"
The greedy hunter cried.
"We rely on your light,
And leave your love behind."

A little life, so religious.
Will lead a light of love.
A little love, so for freedom.
Just a little light of love.
A little life, so religious
Take this little light of love.
A little love, no more freedom.
Take me.
A little life, so religious.
A little love, so for freedom.
A little life, so religious.
A little life, no more freedom.

A little life, so religious.
A little love, so for freedom.
A little life, so religious.
A little life, no more freedom.

A little life, so religious.
A little love, so for freedom.
A little life, so religious.
A little life, no more freedom.
