		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need, I need
I need, I need
I need, I need
I need, I need
I need, I need

Love, love, love, love
'Long as we got
Love, love, love, oh
'Long as we got

Done with these niggas
I don't love these niggas
I dust off these niggas
Do it for fun
Don't take it personal
Personally, I'm surprised you
Called me after the things I said
Skrrt, skrrt on niggas (yeah)
Skrrt up on niggas 
Skrrt down, you acting like me
Acting like we
Wasn't more than a summer fling
I said farewell
You took it well
Promise I won't cry over spilled milk
(Ooh no, I won't)
Gimme a paper towel
Gimme another Valium
Gimme another hour or two
Hour with you

Why you bother me when you know you don't want me? (Yeah)
Why you bother me when you know you got a woman? (Yeah)
Why you hit me when you know you know better?
Know you know better
Know your crew better than you do
Call me looking for ya (yeah)
I be looking for ya (yeah)
Got me looking forward to weekends
With you, baby
With you, baby
With you, baby
With you

We do whatever we want
Go wherever we want
Love however we want
It don't matter
You'll do whatever I want
Get whatever I want
Get whatever I need
It's about

Love, love, love, love
'Long as we got
Love, love, love
'Long as we got

Should've never gave you my number
I did it with you (ooh)
Should've never let you hit it
I split it with you
I regret it
You gots a fetish
You gots a problem
Now it's a problem, oh no
Skrrt, skrrt on bitches (yeah)
I don't know these bitches (yeah)
Dig dirt on bitches
Do it for fun
Don't take it personal, baby
Love on my ladies
Luh-love to my ladies
Uh, dated a few (straight up)

Why you bother me?
Why you bother me?
Why you bother me? (Why you bother me? Yeah)
Last time I checked you were the one that left (the one)
Me in a wreck, me in a mess (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You all I rep, like my side I rep (yeah, side)
That's that Mo city
That side that you can't come 'round at night, yeah (it's lit)
You like to get me high
You don't want no one beside ya
You like when I make fire
You say, "La Flame, keep makin' fire" (keep makin' fire)
Let me cum inside ya
Let me plant that seed inside ya
Ass and titties, titties
The only thing that stuck with me, with me
Only thing that was real
Only thing I could feel, you feel me? (Feel me)
So why you bother me, why you bother me? (with you, baby)
Tryna catch a P.O.V, yeah (with you, baby, with you)

Love, love, love, love
'Long as we got
Love, love, love
'Long as we got

Ooh, I came to your city
Lookin' for lovin' and licky
'Cause you promised to put it down
All up in your city, lookin' for you
Searchin' for your light, oh
Only thing keeping me from droppin' you right now
Right now, love
Only thing keepin' me by your side
Only thing keepin' me by your side now

But see Sol√°na, if you don't say something
Speak up for yourself
They think you stupid
You know what I'm saying?
