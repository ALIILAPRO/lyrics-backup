		  (Mo)

She gon' spark a blunt and get high like me
Bet your boyfriend ain't fly like me
Pop a Percocet, float to the sky like me
And the bullshit really so beyond me
Yeah, this shit lit, lit, lit, lit, lit, lit (lit)
Lit, lit, lit, lit, lit, lit (lit shit)
Lit, lit, lit, lit, lit, lit
Lit, lit, lit, lit, lit, lit (yeah)
Lit, lit, lit, lit, lit, lit
Lit, lit, lit, lit, lit, lit (yeah)
Lit, lit, lit, lit, lit, lit (yeah), yeah
Bitch, we keepin' shit lit, that's for sure
If you talk down, we gon' come and kick down your door
Pillow talkin' pussy nigga, you know you a ho, yeah
Big 14, no rookie, nigga, keep a beam don't need a scope (yeah)
Say you street, you want a cookie, nigga?
Off a bean and you broke, askin' for lean, can't pour no four
That boy off that good dope, he got lost, no hope
I got lost with your hoe, she said she in love, she don't wanna go home
Is it love or lust? Bae, I really don't know
Diamonds on you, different colors, bae, they speakin' Morse code
Shawty water, feel like butter, if she ride it, then I'm toast
Not to mention, not no water, bae you know I do the most
I was tired of that shit, I had to change my damn coast
Boy, I'm flier than this ship, I'm the damn hell bat
I just bought a Cullinan and I'm 'bout to buy a Hellcat
I'm addicted to the green, where the fuck the kale at?
I need to know everything, where the fuck is Yale at?
You niggas know too much, you better never tell that
I'm 1400 slime, bitch, I fuckin' yell that
And my swag grade-A, you niggas get held back

Yeah
I could feel the pain
I could feel the pain on ya (pain)
I could feel the pain on ya, open-heart
