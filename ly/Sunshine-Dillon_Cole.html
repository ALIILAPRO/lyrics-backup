		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You, feel like sunshine on my skin
Think I just might let you in
Driving eighty, down a forty five
Another summer night spent with
You, got that O2 that I need
Girl without you I can't breathe
Drive me insane, drive me crazy
That's my baby and I want
To wake up from late nights and drunk fights
To make up with "I'm wrongs" and "you're rights"
It's crazy the way we could lose sight
I don't know but won't go with no fight
Because you're perfect girl
And you're worth it girl
I made you my world
You're all I need
I guarantee
Nobody's gonna
Treat you better than
Treat you better than
You, feel like sunshine on my skin
Think I just might let you in
Driving eighty, down a forty five
Another summer night spent with
You, got that O2 that I need
Girl without you I can't breathe
Drive me insane, drive me crazy
That's my baby and I want
Patience, oh how can you say this
Ain't just no regular relationship
And low is how you left me
And now you text me and tell me I can't have you
Well I don't want you, girl I need you
You're my sunshine, you're my O2
You're the reason, I keep breathing
And I ain't leaving unless it's with you
Because you're perfect girl
And you're worth it girl
I made you my world
You're all I need
I guarantee
Nobody's gonna
Treat you better than
Treat you better than
You, feel like sunshine on my skin
Think I just might let you in
Driving eighty, down a forty five
Another summer night spent with
You, got that O2 that I need
Girl without you I can't breathe
Drive me insane, drive me crazy
That's my baby and I want
You, when it rains girl you used to be my sunshine
And when it pours maybe you could keep my head dry
Lately I've been in a storm and it feels like
I've been trying to swim to shore through a riptide
Because I know you're there, somewhere, shining on me daily
Rocking with my jukebox, shout it from the rooftops
I don't know what you've got, girl there's something about you
You're the one it's always coming back to
You, feel like sunshine on my skin
Think I just might let you in
Driving eighty, down a forty five
Another summer night spent with
You, got that O2 that I need
Girl without you I can't breathe
Drive me insane, drive me crazy
That's my baby and I want
You, feel like sunshine on my skin
Think I just might let you in
Driving eighty, down a forty five
Another summer night spent with
You, got that O2 that I need
Girl without you I can't breathe
Drive me insane, drive me crazy
That's my baby and I want
