		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't be the only one
Can't be the only one
Can't be the only one

All my glow is on
Can't the will be strong?
Can't be the only one

Can't be the only one (ah)
Can't be the only one (ah)
Can't be the only one

All my glow is on
Can my will be strong? Ah

Ah, ah

Can't be the only one
Can't be the only one
Can't be the only one

Light inside of me
Hard enough to see
What else could it mean?

Love is in the heart
It came like a dream
Loners out to roam
Sewn at the seam

Light inside of me
Hard enough to be
Locked inside my heart
Floating in the dark (floating in the dark)
