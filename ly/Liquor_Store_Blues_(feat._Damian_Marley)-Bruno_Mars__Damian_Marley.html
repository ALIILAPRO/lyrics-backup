		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now greetings to the world

Standing at this liquor store
Whiskey coming through my pores
Feeling like I run this whole block
Lotto tickets cheap beer
That's why you can catch me here
Tryna scratch my way up to the top

'Cause my job got me going nowhere
So I ain't got a thing to lose
Take me to a place where I don't care
This is me and my liquor store blues

I'll take one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be ok tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be ok tomorrow

Me and my guitar tonight
Singing to the city lights
Tryna live on more than what I got
'Cause '68 cents ain't gonna pay the rent
So I'll be out here 'til they call the cops

'Cause my job got me going nowhere
So I ain't got a thing to lose
Take me to a place where I don't care
This is me and my liquor store blues

I'll take one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be ok tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be ok tomorrow

Here comes Junior Gong, I'm flying high like Superman
And thinking that I run the whole block
I don't know if it's just because pineapple kush between my jaws
Has got me feeling like I'm on top

Give me this one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be ok tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be ok tomorrow

Now greetings to the world

You best believe
