		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I wake up, yeah I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who wakes up next to you
When I go out, yeah I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who goes along with you

And if I get drunk, yes I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who gets drunk next to you
And if I haver, whatever that means
I'm gonna be the man who's havering to you

But I would walk 500 miles
An' I would walk 500 more
To be the man who walked a thousand miles
To fall down at your door

When I'm working, yeah I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's working hard for you
And when the money comes in for the work I do
I'll pass almost every penny on to you

When I come home, yeah I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who comes back home to you
And if I grow old, well I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's growing old with you

And I would walk 500 miles
An' I would walk 500 more
To be the man who walked a thousand miles
To fall down at your door

Surrender
Surrender

When I'm lonely, yes I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's lonely without you
When I'm dreaming, yes I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna dream about the time when I'm with you

An' if I get drunk, yeah I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who gets drunk next to you
And if I haver, whatever the fuck that means!
I'm gonna be the man who havers next to you

And I would walk 500 miles
An' I would walk 500 more
To be the man who walked a thousand miles
To fall down at your door

Surrender
Surrender

When I'm lonely, yes I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's lonely without you
I'm gonna be the man who's coming home

'Cause I would walk 500 miles
An' I would walk 500 more
To be the man who walked a thousand miles
To fall down at your door

Surrender
Surrender
