		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody’s here
Everyone we love
The flowers are arranged
They’re handing out champagne
Waiting just for us

And all that I can see
As I walk into the room
Are all the smiling faces
As they take their places
Waiting just for you

And I feel kinda nervous
As the music starts the service
And I turn around

You should see the way your looking right now
As your walking down the aisle in your white gown
I can’t breath, I can’t speak, can’t believe what I’m seeing
I’m Speechless

Holding back the tears in my eyes
You look so beautiful by my side
I can’t breath, I can’t speak, can’t believe what I’m seeing
I’m Speechless

Now we’re finally here
After all that we’ve been through
So let’s raise a glass
To future and to past
Here’s to me and you

As our song starts playing
And both our hearts a racing
I spin you around

You should see the way your looking right now
As your walking down the aisle in your white gown
I can’t breath, I can’t speak, can’t believe what I’m seeing
I’m Speechless

Holding back the tears in my eyes
You look so beautiful by my side
I can’t breath, I can’t speak, can’t believe what I’m seeing
I’m Speechless
I’m Speechless
I’m Speechless

You should see the way you’re looking right now
As I stare into your eyes reading my vows
I can’t breath, I can’t speak, can’t believe what I’m seeing
I’m Speechless
