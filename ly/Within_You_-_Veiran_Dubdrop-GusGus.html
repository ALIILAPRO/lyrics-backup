		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You drain down to the gutter
So bad it bites reality
Echoing sounds of your lover
You tie down your breath for a while
May take some time, sometime

Find a dime and I shiver
Who cares where you carry your name
Tied down by your lover
Break my heart and leave you maim
That's you, that's you, that's you

(Try on)

You cannot make time go backwards
Or make it run fast forward
It will go on without you
Clear is my mind echoing throughout within you

Lay my heart down easy in your hands

Found our hearts are made to shiver
So right would you play me again
Shared by one another
The tears in our veins
Make your pause
and I'll deliver my gold, I've sold my gold

Making my heart work harder
So it can beat much faster
It will go on within me
After my time of passing through
Within you

You cannot make time go backwards
Or make it run fast forward
It will go on without you
Clear is my mind echoing throughout within you
