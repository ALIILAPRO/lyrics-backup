		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I started somethin', I got what I wanted
Did-didn't I? Can't feel nothin', superhuman
Even when I'm fuckin' Viagra poppin', every single record autotunin'
Zero emotion, muted emotion, pitch corrected, computed emotion, uh-huh
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile, ow
Stripper booty and a rack like wow, brain like Berkeley
Met her at Coachella, I went to see Jigga, she went to see Z Trip, perfect
I took a seat on the ice cold lawn, she handed me a ice blue bong, whatever
She said she wanna be a dentist really badly, she's in school payin'
For tuition doin' porn in the Valley, at least you workin'
But girl I can't feel my face, what are we smokin' anyway?
She said, "Don't let the high go to waste" 
But can you taste a little taste of

Novocaine, baby, baby, Novocaine, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none, numb, numb, numb, numb

Sink full of dishes, pacin' in the kitchen, Cocaine for breakfast, yikes
Bed full of women, flip on a tripod, little red light on shootin', I'm feelin' like
Stanley Kubrick, this is some visionary shit
Been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut but it keeps on movin'
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile
Stripper booty with the rack like wow, I'll never forget ya
You put me on a feelin' I never had (never), never had, never had (never had)
And ever since I've been tryna get it back and pick it up and put it back (back, back)
Now I'm somethin' like the chemist on campus
But there's no drug around, quite like what I found in you, you
I still can't feel my face (ohh), what am I smokin' anyway? (Ah)
She said, "Don't let the high go to waste" (ooh)
But can you taste a little taste of

Novocaine, baby, baby (oh), Novocaine, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none, numb, numb, numb, numb

Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine (ohh)
Numb the pain, numb the pain, numb the pain, numb the pain, numb the pain (ahh yeah)
Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine (ohh)
(Wooh-oo) for the pain, for the pain (ooh-oh)
Novocaine, Novocaine

Oh-oh, oh-oh, ho-ho
Oh-oh, oh-oh, ho-ho-ho
Oh-oh, oh-oh, ho-ho
Oh-oh, oh-oh, ho-ho-ho

Pretty girls involved with me
Makin' pretty love to me pretty, pity pity
All the pretty girls involved with me
Makin' pretty love to me pretty, pity pity

Ohh, I can't feel a thing
I can't feel, can't feel a thing
Can't feel a thing, can't feel, feel, feel, feel a
I can't feel, feel a, Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine
I can't feel, feel a, Novocaine, for the pain, for the pain
I can't, can't feel a (feel a)
Feel a, feel a (ohh)
Novocaine, Novocaine, 'Caine ('Caine, 'Caine, 'Caine)
