		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Free Lil Ju that's on the woops I wish they gave him bail
I woulda been grabbed him
If I'ma bitch like niggas say you shoulda been bagged me
Yuh, Avenues

I ain't goin' back to that cell
Still winning when I add up these L's
To da neck cause I won't rat on myself
It was days I was hurtin'
But my pride wouldn't let me ask you for help
High speedin' do da dash in a dell
That wasn't even our load
Since you know me, name a time when I froze
Real nigga not the one you expose
What's the price on the poles
Ring me up I plan on blessin' the hood
How you blow up and ain't check on the hood
That could neva be me
Blew Interscope check on the hood
Stuffed the opposition dead in a wood
Cause it's foreva smokey
Fun sized AR's shells hella bulky
Remove the high beams and telescopie

Yeah, I'm still in Cali I can't tell they want me
Pursuing erry lead that fell upon me
We proactive wit it
He took his scary ass to Houston when we clapped a nigga
And that's on Jakey go and ask the nigga

Hgm General
They ain't get no money niggas actin' like it's difficult
First time in Slausen blew a 50 ball wit Enphico?
You know I fuck wit Ben Ballin
The labels been callin' way before I signed wit Gotti
But they ain't get me righteous like he got me
Slidin' wit these sticks mask on game of hockey
Turnin' down the Tris preferrably fuck wit Wocki
Pour it in a blue cream frosty if you will, aye
He ain't tag his jeweler when he copped it it ain't real
Middle of that Arden Mall go we know the deal
Killas ain't gon' chill unless I tell 'em chill
It's several M's in my account amount to all them L's

The pack landed he confirmed by textin' "All is well"
And lil mama said she lookin' for a real nigga
Shouldn't be that hard to find cause they all in jail
Free Lil Ju that's on the woop I wish they gave him bail
I woulda been grabbed him

Yeah if I'ma bitch like niggas say you shoulda been bagged me

If I'ma bitch like niggas say you shoulda been bagged me
