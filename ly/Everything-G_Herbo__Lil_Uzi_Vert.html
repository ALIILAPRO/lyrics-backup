		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hit the scene, so fresh, so motherfuckin' clean
And my car so fast, it's leaving everything
I love you so momma, and thank you for everything
And you know momma, I was doing everything
Using guns, ecstasy, I'm off extra lean
In the hood I'm selling molly, raw, everything
Heroin, we crushing Tylenol, everything
Weed, soft, everything
Hit the mall, 50 G's, and I ball, everything
Plug just like Tom Brady, boy, I caught everything
My Uncle a gangster, I'm the one he taught everything
You can't be my lady, sneaky bitch, I saw everything

Herbo, what you do for fun? Bitch everything
(What you gon' do with that gun? Bitch, everything)
What kind of drugs you wanna run? Bitch, everything
If you die, what you gon' leave your mom? Bitch, everything

Everything on you phony
Niggas lie 'bout everything, put it on they homies
Hating ass nigga, you want everything on me
Swervo saucy, everything got double G's, don't it
Italian beef with everything, extra cheese on it
I done iced out everything, them VV'S on it
I done tried everything, except coke and dope
I done fired everything, .40's blow the most
Seen dead bodies, everything, so I drove the Ghost
Told that bitch take off everything, I ain't even close
Took everything in me not to close your fuckin' door
Barney's on me, everything, everything boss
Everything exhaust

Herbo, what you do for fun? Bitch everything
(What you gon' do with that gun? Bitch, everything)
What kind of drugs you wanna run? Bitch, everything
If you die, what you gon' leave your mom? Bitch, everything

Yuh, everything
My new whip, that bitch, it came with everything
I'ma turn that boy into a heavy stain
Whipping up that dope, yeah, that's that heavy cream
I been fucking on your bitch since I was 17
Even though my Glock hold 30, this a 17
Chop it, whole thing from the Medellin
My old gun, that shit was dirty, but I kept it clean
Mask off, remember me
Extra button, on the back, 'cause my uzi a lemon squeeze
Gucci, Louis, Fendi, Prada
Swag, swag, swag, that's my disease
Fuck her once, I gotta leave
Smoking dope, I'm Japanese
Fucked her in the master suite
I ball like an athlete

Herbo, what you do for fun? Bitch everything
(What you gon' do with that gun? Bitch, everything)
What kind of drugs you wanna run? Bitch, everything
If you die, what you gon' leave your mom? Bitch, everything
