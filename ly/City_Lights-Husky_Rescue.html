		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Would you take me there last one more time
Tonight, under light
Would you be my friend for a while
Would you please pretend that you don't lie 

Would you keep me warm if the sun won't shine
Tonight, under the city light
Would you be my guide if I am shy
Would you do me things that I don't mind

Would you give me ride that I can fly
Tonight, under light
Would you treat me right if I am kind
Would you like me more if I can smile

Would you set on tears if I start to cry
Would you take me there last one more time
Tonight, under light
Would you keep me warm if the sun won't shine

Tonight, under the city light
