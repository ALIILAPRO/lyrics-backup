		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Black as a beacon
In a river of shimmering fog
Yes she was

If you were heat-seeking
She was hard to ignore
Yes she was

And she snapped
Wing mirrors off of Cadillacs
The particularly pretty ones

And that
Meant she never had to strain her back
When she was putting her lippy on

Well, time tastes bland
When she's not around
And you'd sit and you'd sink and approach the brink
Before she showed you how to shake love's steady hand
That knows

And she snapped
Wing mirrors off of Cadillacs
The particularly pretty ones

And that
Meant she never had to strain her back
When she was putting her lippy on

Shake love's steady hand
Shake love's steady
She floats like a niccy rush but she stings like a B-flat
The Blond-o-Sonic Shimmer Trap

And she snapped
Wing mirrors off of Cadillacs
The particularly pretty ones

And that
Meant she never had to strain her back
When she was putting her lippy on
