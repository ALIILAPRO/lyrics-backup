		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey little girl
Why you fooling around
Why you always gotta be puttin' me down
You don't know what I'm talking about

So hey little girl better stop putting out
I've been walking in my sleep
Can you give me what I need
It's never enough just to hold you
It's never enough just to please you
Ooh baby it's never enough

You take and you take all you can
Now I need to understand
It's never enough
Baby bye bye

Hey little girl you're a heartbreaker
Why you gotta be such a dictator
You don't care about how I feel
Why you always gotta be spinning your wheels
I've been walking in my sleep
Can you give me what I need
It's never enough just to hold you
It's never enough just to please you
Ooh baby it's never enough

You take and you take all you can
Now I need to understand
It's never enough
Baby bye bye
