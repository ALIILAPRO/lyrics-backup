		<p>
		  Big headed, long stick
Fucked up, turnt too
Do it big headed, long stick
Turnt up, turnt too

Gone off the shit again, that's just how I live
Lost just like Gilligan on my own island
Gone off the shit again, lost just like Gilligan
Gone off the shit again, ay, lost just like Gilligan, ay
Gone off the shit again, yeah, ay
Lost just like Gilligan, ay, ay
Gone off the shit again, ay, lost just like Gilligan, ay
Gone off the shit again, ay, lost just like

Look, I got hella shit
Take a whip, peep these molly rocks
I got diamonds, too
Bought a few, but they still like to swipe
Bitch, don't call my bluff
If you want one, then meet me at the crib
You know what it is
Put your phone on off, give your phone to him, okay, cool
Girl, your 'fro so soft, ooh, look at your friend, tryna be rude
Get put in your place and that's out my place
So please, be nice
All this in your face, you can't get out my face
We know your type

Gone off the shit again, that's just how I live
Lost just like Gilligan on my own island
Gone off the shit again, lost just like Gilligan
Gone off the shit again, ay, lost just like Gilligan, ay
Gone off the shit again, yeah, ay
Lost just like Gilligan, ay, ay
Gone off the shit again, ay, lost just like Gilligan, ay
Gone off the shit again, ay, lost just like

I got hella racks in my safe, got stars in my Wraith
I got stripper hoes snortin' blow, dancin' at my place
I got hella pounds from the plug that I'm 'bout to face
Three Six Mafia probably fuck yo mama back in '98
Sippin' on purple rain like champagne
Niggas gon' make a toast
And that weed and shit that you passin'
If a nigga don't choke
Rolls Royce, I'm flying, sauces drippin'
Same color as the smoke
Thousand niggas with me, in the street
Nigga look like the Pope (Oh shit, nigga!)

Gone off the shit again, that's just how I live
Lost just like Gilligan on my own island
Gone off the shit again, lost just like Gilligan
Gone off the shit again, ay, lost just like Gilligan, ay
Gone off the shit again, yeah, ay
Lost just like Gilligan, ay, ay
Gone off the shit again, ay, lost just like Gilligan, ay
Gone off the shit again, ay, lost just like

Gilligan lost, turned trill again
Need a vitamin, wait a min'
Better yet, a Ritalin for my adrenaline
If I'm up in my feelings, better pay the man
Like motherfuck a middle man
Like I'm the shits with the shits
Fuck another nigga bitch again off the shits again
Island boy like I'm Dominican
On repeat like a ceiling fan
All pink like I'm Killa Cam
Palms, feet, let her feel the sand
On the beach like I'm finna tan
Black and proud like a brother man
Make it rain like the weatherman
Bust your head, fuck a settlement
Captain save and never sell again

Gone off the shit again, that's just how I live
Lost just like Gilligan on my own island
Gone off the shit again, lost just like Gilligan
Gone off the shit again, ay, lost just like Gilligan, ay
Gone off the shit again, yeah, ay
Lost just like Gilligan, ay, ay
Gone off the shit again, ay, lost just like Gilligan, ay
Gone off the shit again, ay, lost just like
