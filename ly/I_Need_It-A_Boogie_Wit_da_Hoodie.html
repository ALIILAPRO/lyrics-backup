		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah, nah-nah-nah
Nah, nah-nah-nah

I been on rich nigga shit, not that broke nigga shit
Look, my diamonds hittin' from my choker to my wrist
Look, yacht parties, I'm only bringin' baddies on the boat
Look, I'm tryna chill off the Addys, need to smoke (woo)
Oh, nah, nah, nah
I can see you lookin' at me from a side eye
Oh, nah, nah, nah
I wear Highbridge on my shoulders like designer
Oh, nah, nah, nah
Look, I could never go basic (basic)
I flew you out to different nations (woo)
And I been seein' different faces (faces)
And I been through these different phases, yeah
I'm an artist, I can paint it (yeah)
I swear these drugs got me painless (painless)

Who got the drink? Who got smoke?
I need it (I need it, yeah)
Who got smoke? Who got drink?
I need it (I need it, yeah)
Tryna stay up, yeah, I'm tryna stay focused, I need to
She a demon in disguise, I see it in her eyes, she evil
Who got drink? Who got smoke?
I need it (I need it)
I need Addys, I need love, I need it (I need it, yeah)
I'm tryna stay sober, I'm tryna stay focused, I need to (need to)
This lifestyle I chose, this lifestyle I chose, it ain't normal (yeah, yeah)

More money, less friends, I don't really give a fuck
Me and my niggas outside, lil' broski in the cut
I swear to God, if I run out of money, he gon' stick you up
I swear the double-R not low-key, they notice me
Until the AM light, we don't got to go to sleep
They on the 'Gram worried 'bout how they gon' flex still
I be focused on the next deal, next bill, next drill (what?)
When I come around, I be chillin' every time I come around town
It's a different feelin', we be ridin' in the Lamb' now
Act like she not, but she with it, I know he down, down (look)
Every weekend I hit the plug for a pound now (ooh, nah, nah)
Look, I always re-up halfway, I can never run out

Who got the drink? Who got smoke?
I need it (I need it, yeah)
Who got smoke? Who got drink?
I need it (I need it, yeah)
Tryna stay up, yeah, I'm tryna stay focused, I need to (need to)
This lifestyle I chose, this lifestyle I chose, it ain't normal (normal)
Who got drink? Who got smoke?
I need it (I need it)
I need Addys, I need love, I need it (I need it, yeah)
I'm tryna stay sober, I'm tryna stay focused, I need to (need to)
This lifestyle I chose, this lifestyle I chose, it ain't normal (ain't normal)

Yeah, yeah
Nah-nah-nah
Oh, nah
Nah-nah-nah, oh, nah-nah
Yeah, oh, nah-nah
Yeah, let's go
This lifestyle I chose
