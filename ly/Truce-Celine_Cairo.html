		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been running for the door
keys in my hand
but it's a moving target I can't focus on
something in my brain
has been pounding on the walls
and I know this drum but I don't know this song

it's something old
something new
fighting for some kind of truce
and I hope I'll make it out
in one piece as I lay down my pride

been holding down the fort
gunpowder through my veins
and now the vultures circle up above I know
I must be wearing thin
or I'd still hold the reigns
still I keep fighting with my head up high and low

it's something old
something new
fighting for some kind of truce
and I hope I'll make it out
in one piece as I lay down my pride

who knows when the morning comes
who knows when the evening falls
who breaks and pays the price in full
who fights till kingdom come

who knows when the morning comes
who knows when the evening falls
who breaks and pays the price in full
who fights till kingdom come

it's something old
something new
fighting for some kind of truce
and I hope I'll make it out
in time to make my way to paradise
in time to make my way to paradise
