		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They all say a dream is true
It is the conscious speaking through
All of the doubts, cleaning out
Slate from the sorrows it's all about
Rejuvenation, killing the pain
Survival instincts, keeping it sane
But my dreams make me scream
They live forever as it may seem
So I'm searching for the light
As I drown in my insides
When I wake up, here I am
In another dream where I can't
Even see signs of the sun
Every time I come undone
So help me come alive
Cause I'm living in a bad dream
I'm living in a bad dream
Vivid beings, vivid scenes
Cannot escape with rigid wings
The more I try, the more I die
I drown in my river, but it feels dry
Alienation is a sign
Illumination in my mind
In my dreams, it extremes
My irritations as it seems
So I'm searching for the light
As I drown in my insides
When I wake up, here I am
In another dream where I can't
Even see signs of the sun
Every time I come undone
So help me come alive
Cause I'm living in a bad dream
I'm living in a bad dream
I'm living in a bad dream
I'm living in a bad dream
My roof is on fire I gotta wake up
My roof is on fire My roof is on fire
I gotta wake up
