		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's no days off (it's no days off)
Take no breaks (take no breaks)
You in my lane (get out my lane)
You in my way (get out my way)
You crossed that line (crossed that line)
It ain't yo' day (it ain't yo' day)
I lost my mind (I lost my mind)
I need my space

Get out my way (yeah)
Get out my way (yeah)
Get out my way (woo)
Get out my way (ugh)
Get out my way (move)
Get out my way (yeah, skrrt, skrrt)
Get out my way (woo)
Get out my way (well)
I ain't never been safe

Move
Black Forgiatos on the tires got me sitting high like a gladiator
Life on the line, cross the state line, straight face when I navigate it (skrrt)
You don't know about the fast life
I got scars from my last fight
Ice water in my bloodstream from some old things in my past life
This is not what you wanted, you hunt or be hunted, no turning back and running from it
It's one and done, you better run it (run it)
You taste defeat or overcome it (yeah)
Y'all can't tell me nothing, I spent seven summers running through the jungle
Everyday a struggle
People throwing stones and tryna make us stumble
Rose up out the rubble, tell 'em they could crumble

So all y'all back up (back up, back up)
Or go call backup (or go call backup)
I just got knocked down (yeah, uh)
I still got back up (still got back up)
It's no days off, boy (it's no days off)
I take no breaks (I take no breaks)
I lost my mind
I need my space

Get out my way (yeah)
Get out my way (yeah)
Get out my way (woo)
Get out my way (ugh)
Get out my way (move)
Get out my way (yeah, skrrt, skrrt)
Get out my way (woo)
Get out my way (well)
I ain't never been safe

Ain't nobody blocking, they can't stop me, I'm on ten
Ain't no other option, they just copy what I did
Get out my way (move)
Get out my way (yeah, skrrt, skrrt)
Get out my way (woo)
Get out my way (well)
I ain't never been safe

Never fold when you face pain and they take aim like a movie shoot
No vest when they draw lines, I be offsides feeling bulletproof
Use my past like a flashback
Overcome, moving past that
Moving on, let the Audi run on the Autobahn, where the gas at?
Gettin' to it, yeah, I'm gettin' to it
Took a lot of hits, but I'm gettin' through it
You could make it or could make excuses
Choice is yours, I can't make you choose it
Came from nothing, but I got adopted
Treat this expedition like a Maserati
All up in the zone, it's like it's out of body
Yeah, they got a wave, but my splash tsunami, ah
I just know go, I don't know chill, say what I want
That's how I feel, I'm 'bout that funk, I keep it trill, this be that glow
Shine be too real, they wanted smoke until they breathing mine
Second-hand smoke, I defunct, I get down
I'm showing proof to give people a sign
I keep on running 'til the clocks say it's time

It's no days off (no days off)
I take no breaks (take no breaks)
You in my lane (in my lane)
Get out my way (get out my way)
Crossed that line (crossed that line)
It ain't yo' day (it ain't yo' day)
I lost my mind (I lost my mind)
I need my space

Get out my way (yeah)
Get out my way (yeah)
Get out my way (woo)
Get out my way (ugh)
Get out my way (move)
Get out my way (yeah, skrrt, skrrt)
Get out my way (woo)
Get out my way (well)
I ain't never been safe

Ain't nobody blocking, they can't stop me, I'm on ten
Ain't no other option, they just copy what I did
Get out my way (move)
Get out my way (yeah, skrrt, skrrt)
Get out my way (woo)
Get out my way (well)
I ain't never been safe (woo)
