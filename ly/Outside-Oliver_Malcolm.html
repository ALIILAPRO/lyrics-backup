		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, it may seem cool from the outside
But this a crazy life
All my favorite entertainers
Got famous and then they died
So it may seem cool from the outside
But trust me, you don't want this life
Ain’t no one there to cheer you on
When you're alone at night

So mama, I'll be coming home
But won’t be long
'Cause I thought this life was for me
But it might not be after all i'm hopeless
Hopeless i'm hopeless
Hopeless

So it may seem cool from the outside
But inside, I'm tired
Rolling 'round my streets at night
Missing them younger timеs
So it may seem cool from the outside
But trust me, you don't want this lifе
Ain't no one there to cheer you on
Just you and your twisted mind

So mama, I’ll be coming home
But won’t be long
'Cause I thought this life was for me
But it might not be after al i’m hopeless
Hopeless hopeless
Hopeless
