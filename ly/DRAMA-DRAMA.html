		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They like yo drama where you been at
Hold up I ain't gonna steal your flow
But I'm chilling with all my bros
And I'm killing mics all these shows
Still I stay myself cause I make myself
Fuck a hater I hate myself
I don't really fuck with authority
you ask me
Bitch I raised myself
After that I raised some hell
Did some shit won't never tell
I don't buy no fuckin drugs that I know won't ever sell
I like only light green THC with pressure smell
Mister put the team on my back coach I handle pressure well
They like yo drama where you been at
I been around
Smoking that shit from the ground
Toking a spliff out the pound
No smoking ditch in my town
Take a hit pass it around
I was right here when your asses was down
I'm still right here and I'm laughing at clowns
It's my career and the name is TF
dripping in gold and we holding the crown
Who that?
Ouu pockets too fat
Woo feel like new jack
True shows be too packed
Who the fuck do you think you are we all know all you do cap
That right there a true fact
Oh watch me and my rude ass
They like yo drama where you been at
Hold up I ain't gonna steal your flow
But I'm chilling with all my bros
And I'm killing mics all these shows
Still I stay myself cause I make myself
Fuck a hater I hate myself
I don't really fuck with authority
you ask me
Bitch I raised myself
After that I raised some hell
Did some shit won't never tell
I don't buy no fuckin drugs that I know won't ever sell
I like only light green THC with pressure smell
Mister put the team on my back coach I handle pressure well
Big dick energy from NEB
Kill any beat
Boy scout shit ready for everything
and anything
Hennessy shots I'm drinking spirits I'm an entity
I'm the sickness and the remedy
I'm smoking something heavenly
Got tendencies
A Titan but I'm not from Tennessee
Killing all my enemies
Popping off like oxy
Making fire with acetylene
They want me dead like Kennedys For words inside my melodies
How the hell did he
Escape to make a legacy
They like yo drama where you been at
Hold up I ain't gonna steal your flow
But I'm chilling with all my bros
And I'm killing mics all these shows
Still I stay myself cause I make myself
Fuck a hater I hate myself
I don't really fuck with authority
you ask me
Bitch I raised myself
After that I raised some hell
Did some shit won't never tell
I don't buy no fuckin drugs that I know won't ever sell
I like only light green THC with pressure smell
Mister put the team on my back coach I handle pressure well
