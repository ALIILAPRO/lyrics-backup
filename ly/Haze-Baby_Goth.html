		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lost in this haze
I don't wanna feel this pain anymore
All the doors are locked
I'm stumbling through this maze
Can't escape
Can't explain
Trapped, I'm floating in the same
Is this real?
Feels so strange
Running in slow motion through my phase

You can't see me
Passing me up like a ghost
Got low energy
All my time spent doing the most
Shadows in my sleep
I been sleep walking down the coast
Come and find me getting lost off in the smoke
Breathing slow so I cannot go
Lights low in my Lambo

Lost in this haze
I don't wanna feel this pain anymore
All the doors are locked
I'm stumbling through this maze
Can't escape
Can't explain
Trapped, I'm floating in the same
Is this real?
Feels so strange
Running in slow motion through my phase

Lost in this haze
I don't wanna feel this pain anymore
All the doors are locked
I'm stumbling through this maze
Can't escape
Can't explain
Trapped, I'm floating in the same
Is this real?
Feels so strange
Running in slow motion through my phase
