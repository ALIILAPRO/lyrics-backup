		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was alright for a while
I could smile for a while
But I saw you last night, you held my hand so tight
As you stopped to say, "Hello"
Oh, you wished me well, you couldn't tell

That I'd been crying over you
Crying over you
Then you said, "So long"
Left me standing all alone
Alone and crying
Crying
Crying
Crying
It's hard to understand
But the touch of your hand
Can start me crying

I thought that I was over you
But it's true, so true
I love you even more than I did before
But darling, what can I do?
For you don't love me
And I'll always be

Crying over you
Crying over you
Yes, now you're gone
And from this moment on
I'll be crying
Crying
Crying
Crying
Yeah, crying
Crying
Over you
