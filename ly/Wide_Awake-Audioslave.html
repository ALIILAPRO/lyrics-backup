		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can look a hurricane right in the eye 
Twelve hundred people dead or left to die 
Follow the leaders 
Were it an eye for an eye 
We'd all be blind, deaf or murdered 
This I'm sure 
In this uncertain time 

So come pull a sheet over my eyes 
So I can sleep tonight 
Despite what I've seen today 
I find you guilty of the crime 
Of sleeping in a time when you should have been wide awake 

Down on the road the world is floating by 
The poor and undefended left behind 
While you're somewhere trading lives for oil 
As if the whole world were blind 

So come pull a sheet over my eyes 
So I can sleep tonight 
Despite what I've seen today 
I've found you guilty of the crime 
Of sleeping in a time when you should have been wide awake 
Come pull this sheet over my eyes 
So I can sleep tonight 
Despite what I've seen today 

I found you guilty of the crime 
Of sleeping in a time when you should have been wide awake 

Wide awake 
Wide awake 
Wide awake 
Wide awake
