		  (Have you ever been to London?)
(DMac got me too bangin')

Pretty brown eyes, legs, hips and thighs
Just the right size, girl, you made just for me
Pretty brown eyes, way more than a vibe
Coke bottle design, girl, you made for a G

I'm only in town for the night, bad lil' bitch on ice, yeah (ice, yeah)
Shake that shit, like dice, drop that shit, like prices (prices)
Pull up on the kid, I won't think twice (think twice)
Love you like my city, might make you my wife (might make you wifey)
I put the karats on 'em, she got a BBL
The natural weight, put ass and titties on her
She like to fuck on top of the Bentley, I pull her hair and she want it
VV's on her, choke her, body Coca-Cola, love to stroke her
CC's when I post a foreign, not a local
My bitch global, yeah, she glow up

She want rich sex (she want rich sex)
She want yellow ice (she want yellow ice), like a piss test
Half a ticket on that Phantom, that's a big flex
Cuban link sit on her breast, I wanna undress

Pretty brown eyes, legs, hips and thighs
Just the right size, girl, you made just for me
Pretty brown eyes, way more than a vibe
Coke bottle design, girl, you made for a G
Pretty brown eyes, legs, hips and thighs
Just the right size, girl, you made just for me
Pretty brown eyes, way more than a vibe
Coke bottle design, girl, you made for a G

You've been on my mind, I can't get you off (can't get you off it)
Dive right in your ocean, I can be your dolphin (I can be your dolphin)
Fell asleep and let you put me in a coffin (put me in a coffin)
Like, ooh, child, can we do this often? (Do this often)
Don't start nothin' with me that you can't finish, alright? (That you can't finish)
'Cause once you get me there, you finna get it all night
I can't hit and quit it, I'm addicted, oh, my
Raise the roof when I'm in it, no ceilings, no skies

She want rich sex (she want rich sex)
She want yellow ice (she want yellow ice), like a piss test
Half a ticket on that Phantom, that's a big flex
Cuban link sit on her breast, I wanna undress

Pretty brown eyes, legs, hips and thighs
Just the right size, girl, you made just for me
Pretty brown eyes, way more than a vibe
Coke bottle design, girl, you made for a G
Pretty brown eyes, legs, hips and thighs
Just the right size, girl, you made just for me
Pretty brown eyes, way more than a vibe
Coke bottle design, girl, you made for a G

Just you and my lips, you and my lips
When I hit, it grips, love when I'm dickin' you
I won't call you a Lyft, chauffeur or my whip
Catch my drift, oh, yeah

Pretty brown eyes, legs, hips and thighs
Just the right size, girl, you made just for me
Pretty brown eyes, way more than a vibe
Coke bottle design, girl, you made for a G
Pretty brown eyes, legs, hips and thighs
Just the right size, girl, you made just for me
Pretty brown eyes, way more than a vibe
Coke bottle design, girl, you made for a G
