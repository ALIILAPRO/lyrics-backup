		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Inundated
by you
Inundated
by you
So here I am
Bathed in darkness
Right here it’s still
In the eye of the storm
I had the burden
Of thinking ahead
I had to bear the weight
Of the future
Inundated
by you
You could be playing me
Cause I’m a fool
Inundated
by you
You could be playing me
Cause I’m a fool
We’re on the edge of a mountainside
Over a cliff
We built together in our mind
Over our fears
I call your bluff
You’re scared of love
Inundated
by you
Inundated
by you
So there I was
Bathed in darkness
But not for long cause
Cause I stepped into the light
I had the burden
Of thinking ahead
I had to bear the weight
Of the future
Inundated
by you
You could be playing me
Cause I’m a fool
Inundated
by you
You could be playing me
Cause I’m a fool
