		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am out of sight, out of mind
Open up, I’ll crawl inside
Lay my anchor down, the second vessel in this ground
Confusion surrounds
Another swing of the hammer, but still the mirror reflects
It’s the sickness inside you, open your eyes
What you see is what you despise

I wrap my head around this
To know that you exist
Vanishing mind limits the time that we have
We levitate to find bliss
Outside of this abyss
Delicate mind limits the time that we have left

Follow the past into the eye of the present
Reclaim your independence
You are released from the prison that holds you now
But not forever
Levitate
To defy this affliction that grips your fate
Resuscitate

I’ll search for you in the guts of the lost world

The mind fades in a growing mist
This affliction we can’t reverse
Now in my head I’m screaming
Levitate
