		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here we are, far beyond the distant sky
Seen all the world and how the story will be over
Through the snow and tainted mountains we have climbed
Now we have found the light that guides us over
Through the falling rain we travelled far and wide
And through the blackest darkness, stars above shining bright

Through the sun and winter rain will fall
All our lives we all were waiting for a sign to call
We're walking hand in hand in dreams of endless time
How do we know when we will leave this life behind?

Stare at life through eyes of mine
The hate, the fear and the pain
There's a feeling held deep inside
When life you live is in vain

Fly away down the lonely roads of yesterday
We close our eyes to see the light of brigther days
And all alone we'll be where time can never heal
With the trail of broken hearts flying free

Once again we walk this lonley road
There are times that we were wading through the rain and cold
We're lost in memories of what we left behind
Relive the dreams, the endless screams of pain inside

Lives are filled with emptiness
The fear returns once again
Searching endlessly, now we will see
Drown your mind in the pain

Fly away down the lonely roads of yesterday
We close our eyes to see the light of brigther days
And all alone we'll be where time can never heal
With the trail of broken hearts flying free

The last temptation will be all that's left for me
When I see those tears you cried
When I hear those lies you lied
When I feel all creation now falling down on me
Is this the reason to be?

Fly away down the lonely roads of yesterday
We close our eyes to see the light of brighter days
And all alone we'll be where time can never heal
With the trail of broken hearts flying free
