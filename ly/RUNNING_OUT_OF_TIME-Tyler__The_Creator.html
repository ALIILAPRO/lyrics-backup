		  Runnin' out of time, runnin' out of time, runnin' out of time
Runnin' out of time to make you love me
Runnin' out of time, runnin' out of time
To make you love me

Secrets, oh, you spin my head around (oh, you spin my head around)
I been lookin' for it (For it, for it)
I been runnin' out of spells (yeah)
To make you love me
Secrets (run)
(Run, run)
(Keep it up) to make you love me (ah)
Wade in your water (wade in your water)
And waves wash over me
I drift to the deep end
Don't save, don't save, don't save
It's a low tide (I'll be fine)
I found peace in drownin'

Runnin' out of time, runnin' out of time, runnin' out of time
Runnin' out of time (run)
To make you love me

(Run) livin' in pretend
Keep it a buck fifty fuck, oh
Livin' in pretend
Are you

(Run)
(Run)
(Run)

So take your mask off
I need her out the picture (wade in your water)
Take your mask off (yeah)
Stop lyin' for these niggas
Stop lyin' to yourself
I know the real you (don't save, don't save, don't save)
Halloween ain't for a minute, lose the costume
You need to chill, okay (run)
Been runnin' from the targets and 'em back in the day
And now they working their all, another track at the DAW
Actin' a fool, actin' a ball, we packin' the park, yeah
But I'm still runnin' (run)
Out of time (of time, of time)

Runnin' outta (of time)
Still runnin' outta (of time)
Still runnin' outta time, yeah

(Run, run, run)
