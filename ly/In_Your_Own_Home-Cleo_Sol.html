		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't you ever be afraid
In your own home
Oh
We're together, but I could cry
Even when I'm alone
Home, home, home, home
Home

I know rise is never afraid
In his own home
'Cause we are trying
God bless us please
No, no

We climb mountains
As a family
Home, home, home, home
We're all alive
And free
Free, free, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Just love
Good enough for me
Good enough
I have a blessing
And I'm reminded
Of all of my lovin' (all of my lovin')
That I have saved for you (that I have saved for you)
It's a journey, it's a journey

Time to let God in (time to let God in)
Time to let God in (time to let God in)
All of the people (people)
All of the people (beautiful God)

So love in your own home (in your own home)
It is a blessing (never be afraid)
You'll never be lonely (never be afraid)
Even on your on
Needed all of your patience (never be afraid)
Never be afraid (never be, never be)

Don't you ever be afraid
In your own home (in your own home)
Home
Never ever be afraid
You're not alone
No, no, no
You're not alone

Please, don't ever be afraid
'Cause you're not alone
In your own home
Home
No, no, no, no, no
Don't you ever be afraid
In your own home
