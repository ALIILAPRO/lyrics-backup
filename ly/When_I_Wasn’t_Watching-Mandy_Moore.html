		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where was I when this was going down?
Maybe sleeping in, maybe outta town?
I spent my whole life waiting patiently
Convinced it all would come to me
My favorite version of me disappeared
Through longer days and shorter years
So where was I when this was going down?
Assumed the world would come around

To who we are
When no one is looking
When nobody's looking
What I became
When I wasn't watching
When I wasn't watching

A little lost, a little rough
I asked myself, "Have ya had enough?"
How do I start to retrace the steps
I haven't even taken yet
The fear of what I'm facing in the mirror
Stops me cold and leaves me here
A little lost, a little rough
The lack of answers all led up

To who we are
When no one is looking
Nobody's looking
What I became
When I wasn't watching
When I wasn't watching

Who we are
When no one is looking
Nobody's looking
What I became
When I wasn't watching
When I wasn't watching
When I wasn't watching
When I wasn't watching
