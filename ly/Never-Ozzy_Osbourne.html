		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it the voice of your laughter
That echoes in vain
In the vessel of your sorrow
And pain
It is the beat of a heart that
You hear in your mind
Something's missing but you
Cannot explain

You've searched your soul for
Feeling
Over and over now over and
Over now
There is no use in dreaming
Over and over now over and
Over now

It is the chain that you're
Dragging
That was once your relief
That's like everything that's
Born to die
And the birth of a doubt that
Was once your belief
Is drowning in the tears that
You cry

It all remains a mystery
For ever and ever now
Ever and ever now
The things that were are
History
Forever and ever now
Ever and never now

It's never too later to cry
It's never too late for
Goodbyes
It's never too later to cry
You know you were born to die

If the messiah is coming
Will he be too late
To reconcile our tears with
Our hate
And the memory of freedom
That imprisons our heart
And we're greeted by the cold
Hand of fate

It's never too later to cry
It's never too late for
Goodbyes
It's never too later to cry
You know you were born to die
