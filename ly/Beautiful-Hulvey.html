		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He's been so-, our God has been (He been so, He been so good, good)
He's been so good (He's been so, so good)
He's been so good (He been so good, He been so good, He been so good to me)
Our God has been, He's been so good (He been so good, whoa)
You are so beautiful
Here in Your holiness
Lord, I want nothing less
So I let my heart confess (He's been so-)
You are so beautiful
Before Your majesty
You showed me love when all I felt was tragedy
And that's why I'm glad to sing (He's been so-)
You are so beautiful
Everything You do is so unusual (our God has been-)
You snatched me straight out that funeral, oh, oh
I can't wait to see Your eyes one day, I been thinkin' 'bout it
And it's a blessin' just to think that I can think about it (our God has been)
I know some people been searchin', and so they drink about it
But from the cup I drink from will never run dry
This what life on (He's been so-)
Asked for a life vest, He said, "Son, this is lifelong" (our God has been)
Holy Spirit-driven, had to learn to keep the brights on
Puttin' God in a box is like seein' Shaq with some tights on (He's been so good)
Boy, I been loosened by the grip of the python
I shed skin, new hems, I got Christ on
Here in Your holiness (our God has been)
Lord, I want nothing less
So I let my heart confess (He's been so-)
You are so beautiful
Before Your majesty
You showed me love when all I felt was tragedy
And that's why I'm glad to sing (He's been so-)
As I'm sittin' on this plane could be my last breath (He's been so-)
But I ain't scared of death 'cause I got my God in me (our God has been)
And if I die today, I know He did His job with me (He's been so good)
And I still lift up Your Name 'cause
You are so beautiful
Here in Your holiness
Lord, I want nothing less
So I let my heart confess (He's been so-)
You are so beautiful
Before Your majesty
You showed me love when all I felt was tragedy
And that's why I'm glad to sing (He's been so-)
Here in Your holiness
Lord, I want nothing less
So I let my heart confess
You are so beautiful
Before Your majesty
You showed me love when all I felt was tragedy
And that's why I'm glad to sing
He's been so-, our God has been, He's been so good
