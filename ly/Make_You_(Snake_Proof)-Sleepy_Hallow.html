		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo, you started? Alright
How the pain go, woah-woah-woah
How the pain go, woah-woah-woah
How the pain go, woah-woah-woah
(Great John on the beat, by the way) 
Look

Make the money, never let the money make you, huh
Real nigga never fake you
Cut the grass, know you gotta stay snake-proof
All these drugs got me feelin' unstable, uh
How the pain go, woah-woah-woah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
How the pain go, woah-woah-woah (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I be feelin' lonely in the crowd
If I hold you up, you better hold that shit down
Sometimes I cry, no one's around
But laugh and joke when guns around
I know I be flexin' like I never had none
But nigga, we ain't never had none
I ran me up a pack, used to shop at PacSun
Now we main it rain, we don't ever see the sun
I had to leave her, I know she probably the one
But it's that or treating her like she nun
And I don't do the fake, you a bait
They gon' call you everythin' but great
Ocean on my neck and on my wrist, I got a lake
Brand new AP, I just took it to switch the face
Two gun charges, I'm just prayin' I beat the case
I paid my lawyer, I'm just waitin' on court day, so

Make the money, never let the money make you, huh
Real nigga never fake you
Cut the grass, know you gotta stay snake-proof
All these drugs got me feelin' unstable, uh
How the pain go, woah-woah-woah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
How the pain go, woah-woah-woah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
