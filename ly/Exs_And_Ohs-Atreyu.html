		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You took me home
I drank too much
'Cause of you my liver turned to dust
Cold rust taste
A cruel creeping cold pain
Do you understand what I mean?
When you feel your soul drop to the floor
Like a hole, like an open bleeding sore
Then you'll have bled like I bled
And you'll have wept as I've wept

Suck me down, it's time to rock and roll
Let's hit the bar, let's lose control
One false move, you took me home
One false move, you're all alone

But it looks so good and it feels so nice
I paid the price
I'll cut you out just to hear you scream
Get away from, get away from me

And I can feel my heartbeat racing
As I realize what I must do
Get away from
Get away from
Get away from you

I should have turned and ran like hell
Last time I got the taste of you
I should have turned and ran like hell
And I'll see we're through
I should have turned and ran like hell
Last time I got the taste of you
I should have turned and ran like hell
And I'll see we're through
And I'll see we're through

You fell upon me like a plague
Weakness, sweet weakness
But I digress after all this
You're just like all the rest

Suck me down, it's time to rock and roll
Let's hit the bar, let's lose control
One false move, you took me home
One false move, you're all alone
