		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walking slowly tryna find a place to go
You begin to talk about your ex
And the way that he would lose control
And all your friends are trying to throw me
They are asking questions I don't know
But baby I would buy you drinks too
But I don't think you need no more

Then you said, "I need nothing from nobody"
I can see it on your face you're hurting
Grab a hold of me
I said, "Baby, can't you see?
That your past is your past
Oh babe, you've got a hold of me"
You've got a hold of me
'Cause your past is your past
Oh babe, you've got a hold of me

I'm tryna figure you out as you're starin' straight back at me
And you tell me you don't like your father
'Cause he would never let you be
And now you're standing beside the window
You're covered in the light from the street
And I say that it gets cold here in winter
"Do you want my coat? You'll freeze"

Then you said, "I need nothing from nobody"
I can see it on your face you're hurting
Grab a hold of me
Oh, baby, can't you see?
That your past is your past
Oh babe, you've got a hold of me
You've got a hold of me
'Cause your past is your past
Oh babe, you've got a hold of me

You've been holding on so long
You keep pushing me out
You don't know where you belong

So you say to me now
"I need nothing from nobody"
But I can see it on your face you're hurting
Grab a hold of me
I said, "Baby, can't you see?
That your past is your past
Oh babe, you've got a hold of me"
You've got a hold of me
'Cause your past is your past
Oh babe, you've got a hold of me
