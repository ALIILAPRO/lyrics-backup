		  Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye, my love

I can't hide
Can't hide
Can't hide what has come
I have to go, I have to go, I have to go
And leave you alone

But always know, always know, always know
That I love you so
I love you so
I love you so, oh

Goodbye, brown eyes
Goodbye for now
Goodbye, sunshine
Take care of yourself

I have to go, I have to go, I have to go
And leave you alone
But always know, always know, always know
That I love you so,
I love you so, oh
I love you so, oh

La lullaby
Distract me with your eyes
La lullaby
la lullaby
Help me sleep tonight

La lullaby (la lullaby, la lullaby)
I have to go
I have to go
I have to go
And leave you alone

But always know, always know, always know
That I love you so
I love you so
(Goodbye)
(Lullaby)

I love you so
(Goodbye)
(Lullaby)
I love you so
(Goodbye)
(Lullaby)

I love you so
(Goodbye)
(Lullaby)
I love you so
I love you so
I love you so

Goodbye, brown eyes
Goodbye my love
