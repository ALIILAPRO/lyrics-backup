		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let go of that bottle and get off the floor I ainʼt leaving and I wonʼt be quiet till you answer the door Come hang by the fire kill the light on the porch There ainʼt no one coming back home to leave it on for 

Listen my friend you gotta bury that dream Sheʼs lying in another mans arms and wearing his ring Itʼs been the end and you know that itʼs true 

You better get on with your life 
Before life 
Gets on without you 

Youʼve been praying for death Putting hope on a shelf Well the world today needs a man praying for more than himself I know what youʼre feeling but you gotta move on Cause the place that youʼre headed is far worse than being alone
 
Listen my friend you gotta bury that dream Sheʼs lying in another mans arms and wearing his ring 
Itʼs been the end and you know that itʼs true 

You better get on with your life 
Before life 
Gets on without you 

Oh youʼve broken the mirror and now you canʼt look at yourself But if you could you could see me and Iʼm asking for help 

Listen my friend you gotta bury that dream Sheʼs lying in another mans arms and wearing his ring 
Itʼs been the end and you know that itʼs true 

You better get on with your life 
Before life
 Gets on without you
