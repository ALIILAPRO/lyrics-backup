		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I look out my window and watch her as she passes by
I said to myself I'm such a lucky guy
To have a girl like her it's a dream come true
And of all the girls in New York she loves me true

It was just my imagination, once again
Running away with me
It was just my imagination
Running away with me

Soon you and me will be married and raise a family
Two boys for you, what about two girls for me
I tell you that I, I am just a fellow with a one track mind
Whatever it is I want baby I seek and I shall find
I'll tell ya

It was just my imagination, once again
Running away with me
It was just my imagination
Running away with me

Every night I hope and pray
Dear Lord, hear my plea
Don't ever let another take her love from me
Or I will surely die

Her love is ecstasy
When her arms enfold me
I hear her tender rhapsody
But in reality, she doesn't even know me

It was just my imagination
Running away with me
It was just my imagination
Running away with me

It was just my imagination, once again
Running away with me
It was just my imagination
Running away with me

It was just my imagination, once again
Running away with me
It was just my imagination
Running away with me
