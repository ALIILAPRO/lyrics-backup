		  Yeah
Oh oh oh oh (This mister steal your girl)
Oh oh oh oh (This mister steal your girl)
Oh oh oh (Aye girl, aye girl, aye girl, aye girl)
Oh oh oh (Aye girl, aye girl, aye girl, aye girl, let go)

Bottoms up, bottoms up (up)
Aye, what's in ya cup
Got a couple bottles but a couple ain't enough
Bottoms up, bottoms up (up)
Throw ya hands up
Tell security we 'bout to tear this club up
Bottoms up, bottoms up (up)
Pocket full of green
Girl, you know I love the way you shake it in them jeans
Bottoms up, bottoms up (up)
Throw yo hands up
Bottoms up (up), bottoms up (up)
Bottoms up (up), up (up) up bottoms

You know what it is, girl we back up in this thang (thang)
Money stay in my pocket, girl I'm like a walkin' bank (bank)
Tell me what you drank (drank), tell me what you thank (thank)
If I go get these bottles we go alcohol insane (insane)

Callin' all the girls (girls)
Do you hear me?
All around the world (world) 
City to city (city)

Cheers to the girls, throw deuce to the guys
Now I got a chicken and a goose in the ride
Gettin' loose in the ride
Hatin' ass nigga, you can move to the, move to the, move to the side

Bottoms up, bottoms up (up)
Aye, what's in ya cup
Got a couple bottles but a couple ain't enough
Bottoms up, bottoms up (up)
Throw ya hands up
Tell security we 'bout to tear this club up
Bottoms up, bottoms up (up)
Pocket full of green
Girl, you know I love the way you shake it in them jeans
Bottoms up, bottoms up (up)
Throw yo hands up
Bottoms up (up), bottoms up (up)
Bottoms up (up), up (up) up bottoms

My visions blurred (com'ere)
My words slur (com'ere)
It's jam packed (yea)
A million girls (aye)
And I ain't trynna leave though
We drunk so let me be yo alcohol hero

Callin' all the girls (girls)
Do you hear me? (Girl)
All around the world (world)
City to city (yeah)

Cheers to the girls, throw deuce to the guys
Now I got a chicken and a goose in the ride
Gettin' loose in the ride
Hatin' ass nigga, you can move to the, move to the, move to the side

Bottoms up, bottoms up (up)
Aye, what's in ya cup
Got a couple bottles but a couple ain't enough
Bottoms up, bottoms up (up)
Throw ya hands up
Tell security we 'bout to tear this club up
Bottoms up, bottoms up (up)
Pocket full of green
Girl, you know I love the way you shake it in them jeans
Bottoms up, bottoms up (up)
Throw yo hands up
Bottoms up (up), bottoms up (up)
Bottoms up (up), up (up) up bottoms

Can I get that Tron, can I get that Remmy
Can I get that Coke, can I get that Henny
Can I get that margarita on the rock, rock, rock
Can I get salt all around that rim, rim, rim, rim
Trey, I was like yo Trey?
Do you think you can buy me a bottle of Rose√©?
Okay let's get it now
I'm wit' a bad bitch, he's wit' his friends
I don't say I hi, I say keys to the Benz
Keys to the Benz, keys to the Benz
Mu'fuckin' rite yea V to the 10
If a bitch try to get cute I'm a stomp her
Throw alotta money at her then yell fuck her
Fuck her, fuck her, then yell fuck her
Then I'm go and get my Louisville slugger
Excuse me I'm sorry, I'm really such a lady
I rep Young Money
You know Slim, Baby
And we be doin' donuts while we wave in the 3-80
We give a lot of money to the babies out in Haiti
Yellin' all around the world
Do you hear me? Do you like my body Anna Nicki?
Rest in peace to Ana Nicole Smith
Yes my dear your so explosive
Say hi to Mary, Mary and Joseph
Now bottoms up and double my dosage

Bottoms up, bottoms up (up)
Aye, what's in ya cup
Got a couple bottles but a couple ain't enough
Bottoms up, bottoms up (up)
Throw ya hands up
Tell security we 'bout to tear this club up
Bottoms up, bottoms up (up)
Pocket full of green
Girl, you know I love the way you shake it in them jeans
Bottoms up, bottoms up (up)
Throw yo hands up
Bottoms up (up), bottoms up (up)
Bottoms up (up), up (up) up bottoms
Bottoms up (Com 'ere)

Bottoms up (up) 
Bottoms up (up)
Bottoms up (up) 
Bottoms up (up)
