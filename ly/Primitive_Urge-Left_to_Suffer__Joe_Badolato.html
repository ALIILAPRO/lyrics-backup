		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’m sitting while spinning in silence 
I’m suffocating on the air we breathe 
Rebuild, repent 
The thoughts in my head are a fucking disease 

And now they’re absent 
I hear the disembodied voices screaming at me in the past tense 
Slowly losing control 
And now I know that I am all alone 

Slowly counting down 
While I’m losing my head with my feet on the ground 
Fell in love with what it is 
Silently judging me but you don’t know how to live 
Now die 
Cause I’m feeling alive 
And manipulating others is just part of your time 
And now you’re dead set, on trying to justify 
The only form of self punishment is on the inside 

So sick of people trying to tell me how to live 
And I can’t decipher what box I’m fucking in 
Makes it hard breathe 
Even harder to believe 
And my feet are tired from walking through hell
NOW REST 

No one can save me 
From the mess I’ve made 
Burn my corpse and defile my grave 
Becoming manic 
And I think it’s time for us to panic 

It’s coming to life 

I can’t sleep with the thoughts that are locked inside of me 
Paralyzed in the lies that are locked in agony 
dance with the dead 
I chose suffering instead 
The only way out is to cut off my head 

We watched the galaxies burn 
And chose to suffer and die 
To see through the light of day 
I pray he blind both my eyes 

Blind both my eyes 

We can’t stay this fucked up forever 
Slowly pushing through it now we’re in this together 
Rise over malice, grow only through pain 
Wait for waves to waves to wash away.
