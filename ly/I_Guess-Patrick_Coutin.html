		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I guess
I guess 
You will walk away slowly
Out of my life

I guess
I guess
There will be a smile like always
On your lips

I guess
I guess
You will take you time 
To disappear from my heart

You know I know the rules of love
You know I know you have to go
They were no promises and no words
The game of life has rolled the dice
cin't it's time to say good bye?

The ocean is cool and so quiet today
cnd the sun is bright over the clouds
I can imagine you walking down the road 
Going up your way, seems to aim so far, so far away

cin't it's time to say good bye ?
Bye bye Love

I guess
I guess
Day after day I will have to live
With the taste of your skin   

I guess
I guess
Your eyes are so clear
I saw some paradise inside
