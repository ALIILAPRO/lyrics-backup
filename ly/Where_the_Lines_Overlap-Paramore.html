		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give me attention
I need it now
Too much distance
To measure it out, out loud
Chasing patterns across a personal map
And making pictures where the line overlap
Where the lines overlap

No one is as lucky as us
We're not at the end yet but we already won
No one is as lucky as us
Is as lucky as us

Call me over, and tell me how
Well you got so far
Never making a single sound
I'm not used to it
But I can learn
There's nothing to it
I've never been happier
Never been happier

No one is as lucky as us
We're not at the end yet but we already won
No one is as lucky as us
Is as lucky as us

Now I've got a feeling if I sing this loud enough
You would sing it back to me
I've got a feeling if I sing this loud enough
You would sing it back to me

I've got a feeling
I've got a feeling
That you would sing it back to me
That you would sing it back to me

No one is as lucky as us
We're not at the end yet but we already won
Oh, no, no one is as lucky as us
Is as lucky as us
Is as lucky as us
