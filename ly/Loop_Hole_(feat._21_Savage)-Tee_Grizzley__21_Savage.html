		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
(Hitmaka)
(Yo, Nick Papz, make it slap) 
Oh yeah (brrt)
Oh yeah
These people done turnt us into bosses, nigga
That's my new shit
Oh, yeah

Ayy, I found a loophole (I found one)
Been trappin' since a youngster (yeah)
Fully automatic, we can't let no nigga punk us (oh yeah)
Fuck about no bitch, I treat a model like a runner (fuck her)
Bitch, free YSL, I know thugs, I know gunners (slatt)
I was raised to get some money, flip that shit like ten ways (yeah)
In the trap, I'm money hungry, stack that shit for ninety days (oh yeah)
Naked bitches in a room, they fuckin' like they gettin' paid (oh yeah)
Rolls-Royces in the trenches, parked in front of Section 8

I'm on a strict diet, hibachi and exotic pop
You know how I rock, I pass the Glock, don't ask if one up top
We at the Angelino, at the top, vacuum sealin' za
If I don't introduce the bitch
she goin', go 'head and shoot your shot (go 'head)
I throw the Lamb' in course (course)
I'm on dude's block with Horse (oh yeah)
He run shit down for sport (deuce)
We shoot shit off the court (G7)
They hatin', that's of course (oh yeah)
Them bum-ass niggas poor (fuck)
Ain't sponsorin' no whore (at all)
Got money, we want more, nigga (bitch)

Ayy, I found a loophole (I found one)
Been trappin' since a youngster (yeah)
Fully automatic, we can't let no nigga punk us (oh yeah)
Fuck about no bitch, I treat a model like a runner (fuck her)
Bitch, free YSL, I know thugs, I know gunners (slatt)
I was raised to get some money, flip that shit like ten ways (yeah)
In the trap, I'm money hungry, stack that shit for ninety days (oh yeah)
Naked bitches in a room, they fuckin' like they gettin' paid (oh yeah)
Rolls-Royces in the trenches, parked in front of Section 8

Yeah, park Ferraris in the ghetto (21)
Real trapper, used to re-up with them depos (on God)
Mix 'em with the indo, 'bout my dollar like I'm Creflo (21)
Say you pushin' P then when I hit her, why you care for?
Spin a nigga block, that's easy (21, 21)
Y'all be eatin' noodles, we sit down and eat sashimi (facts)
You say you a gangster, just be like that when you see me (pussy)
You can ask the opps, we known for giving niggas freebies (21)

Ayy, I found a loophole (I found one)
Been trappin' since a youngster (yeah)
Fully automatic, we can't let no nigga punk us (oh yeah)
Fuck about no bitch, I treat a model like a runner (fuck her)
Bitch, free YSL, I know thugs, I know gunners (slatt)
I was raised to get some money, flip that shit like ten ways (yeah)
In the trap, I'm money hungry, stack that shit for ninety days (oh yeah)
Naked bitches in a room, they fuckin' like they gettin' paid (oh yeah)
Rolls-Royces in the trenches, parked in front of Section 8
