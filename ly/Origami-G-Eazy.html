		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Yeah
Haha
Yeah

I treat the gang like one of my phones
You can't get in without knowin' the code
Call and collect for all that I'm owed
This ain't origami, I'm never gon' fold
Saint Laurent coat
Oh, shit
My dog 40 Water, I tell him to go
Take what I'm owed
Oh, shit
This ain't origami, I'm never gon' fold (ayy)

One in a million (ayy)
Why would I take your opinion?
You probably would fold in the shit that I been in
Made it out, ooh, what a feelin'
Look how they done turned the hero to a villain (villain)
Notice we callin' them opps
I might send a shot from the top of the buildin' (pew)
Never take me for no industry plant
We can't do all that linkin' and buildin'
Fuck do y'all take me for?
Gassed up, the tank is on F, I fuck her the best
You know I ain't kissin' no whore
GPS, look at 'em lost, he ain't got the sauce
He ain't got the vision no more
I used to point at the guards to give 'em a play
But fuck, I ain't dishin' no more
Louis V all on my glasses, Saint Laurent jacket
Yeah, but the denim's Dior
Money fall like origami, fuck am I talkin' 'bout?
My shit can't fold anymore
She used to give me cold shoulders, I heat it up
Her shit ain't cold anymore (no)
Only few places I go anymore (haha)
Trunk in the front with the vertical doors (woo)

I treat the gang like one of my phones
You can't get in without knowin' the code
Call and collect for all that I'm owed
This ain't origami, I'm never gon' fold
Saint Laurent coat
Oh, shit
My dog 40 Water, I tell him to go
Take what I'm owed
Oh, shit
This ain't origami, I'm never gon' fold

You know, I say I'm up and that's still bein' generous (generous)
Could give all my doubters a stimulus
I ain't got no time to reminisce
Only attachment I want is a message with videos, images
Please don't act innocent (you know what time it is)
I got so used to me winnin' shit
Won't even suit up for scrimmages (no)
I turned a deal to a dealership
We used to drive out of state with the pack
Put trees in the boot like a Timberland, ooh
My bitch and my ex back and forth with the racket
I feel like I'm at the Wimbledon, ooh
I get to wake up a CEO
Shit, she say I'm lucky
But she get to wake up and see me though
Shit, so who really lucky?
Mister Celine
I put the D on her, bring her 'round primetime, I had to D on her
She brought her friend, she look like Rihanna
One had the molly, won't have the C on her
Let's have a threesome if we agree on her
I feel like Klay, I hit the three-pointer
You know she mine, you see the G on her
Seen her with me, now they tryna be on her, ayy

I treat the gang like one of my phones
You can't get in without knowin' the code
Call and collect for all that I'm owed
This ain't origami, I'm never gon' fold
Saint Laurent coat
Oh, shit
My dog 40 Water, I tell him to go
Take what I'm owed
Oh, shit
This ain't origami, I'm never gon' fold

Yeah
You know what it is
