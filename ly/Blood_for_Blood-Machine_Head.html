		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I bite the hand 'cause this hands feeds off me
Devoid of emotion, it lives to cheat
Ignorance is bliss, and respect I gave you
Friend you did claim this
Too bad you can't speak the truth

Give respect
'Cause the rule is blood for blood

Beatings are what you'll inherit this time
Fist bait, your new name
Your pain is my shrine
Pulverize and break
Determination
Pleasure I negate
Your pain brings me salvation

Give respect
'Cause the rule is blood for blood

I was born to tension
Anger came from frustration
I can't back down from aggression
Some hard knocks taught me this lesson

Give respect
'Cause the rule is blood for blood

Give respect
'Cause the rule is blood for blood
