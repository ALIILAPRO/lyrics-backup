		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I pop me a Perc and I smoke me some loud
I pop me a Perc and I smoke me some loud
I pop me a Perc and I smoke me some loud, yeah
I pop me a Perc and I smoke me some loud

Oh my God, I'm gettin' personal now
All I can see is the purplest clouds
Oh my God, I'm gettin' virtual now
I'm 'bout to sip on this syrup 'til I drown
Oh my God, I'm gettin' thirstier now
I'm ballin' way too hard on these clowns
They 'bout to give me a personal foul

I'ma thank God for my existence
I'ma thank God for my charisma
I'ma thank God that I'm in the business
And I'ma thank God I'm not in the system
I'ma thank God for the pots I had to piss in
I'ma thank God for the times I done risked it
I'ma thank God for workin' out the logistics
I'ma thank God that I'm not a statistic
All of my jewelry is fuckin' ridiculous
I cannot really be seriously serious
All of my goons take everything serious
Run in the building and kill your superiors
Killin' the staff and kill the affiliates
Smokin' this gas just like it's some helium
I see y'all ass all in my peripheral
Hop in that, hop in that like an amphibian

She workin' that ass, continuous
I'm workin' my plans, ingenuous
I'm talkin' 'bout mags and millions
Mags and millions, man, ask Eminem
I got a monogamous smile
I do not know how I do how
I give all of my daughter's no doubt
It's been all about now until now
I've been keepin' it quiet but loud
I've been keepin' it private but proud
I've been treatin' the fire like flowers
I've been keepin' it silent but, "Pow"
And she 'bout to twerk on the ground
Oh my God, she gettin' personal now
Oh my God, I'm 'bout to skirt on her blouse
Oh my God, she 'bout to slurp up a child
Yeah, she 'bout to twerk on the ground
Oh my God, she gettin' personal now
Oh my God, she threw her shirt in the crowd
Oh my God, she 'bout to surf on the crowd
Pop me a Perc, and I smoke me some loud
Oh my God, I'm gettin' personal now
Call up my phone, and my service was down
Sorry, I ain't been on Earth in a while

Pop me a Perc, and I smoke me some loud
Oh my God, I'm gettin' personal now
Call up my phone, and my service was down
Sorry, I ain't been on Earth in a while
I'm 'bout to sip on this syrup 'til I drown
Oh my God, I'm gettin' thirstier now
I'm ballin' way too hard on these clowns
They 'bout to give me a personal foul
Damn

Ayy, tell you what you should do, son

Uh, let's get personal
Percocet got me vertical
Them Uzis get so surgical
Shooters, they shoot like Türkoğlu
We murder you, then bury you
Dig a hole and throw dirt at you
You disappear like abracadabra
Magic like 32
It is my time, and, when it is, you on timeout
I'm on Cloud 9, and, nigga, you just on iCloud
I'm an icon, I shine and burn your eyes out
You on the sideline, my side bitch got a side bitch
Gotta sip slow 'case I die quick, I'm alive, bitch
Born piss poor, I'ma die rich full of my shit
Bust up in your house on some mob shit, leave no hostage
Leave you lookin' like January 2nd, July 5th
Y'all are witnesses to my battle, I shall fight
Been through a whole lotta bullshit, still smell nice
Poverty to penitentiary, straight to paradise
Took a few L's, without 'em, I couldn't spell, "Life"
Airtight, vagina tight, and it better smell right
Banana clip dick banana up in her tailpipe
Big fish, nigga, killer whale, kill a bitch nigga
I'ma snap and send a pic, nigga, flick flick, nigga
Tunchi, I pop me a Perc and I smoke me some loud
Oh my God, I'm gettin' personal now
All I can see is the purplest clouds
Oh my God, we gettin' virtual now
I'm 'bout to sip on this syrup 'til I drown
Oh my God, I'm gettin' thirstier now
I'm ballin' way too hard on these clowns
They 'bout to give me a personal foul
