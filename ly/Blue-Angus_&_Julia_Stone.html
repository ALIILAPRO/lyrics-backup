		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were all that remained
Everything else, it slowly fades away
You were the one who forgave
You met me on the corner down Main Street

Whatever happened to those lights we stole?
Whatever happened to those roads as you draw for me?
Whatever happened to those stories you told me
For falling asleep?
For falling asleep

Tell me there's no need to be scared
Tell me that you'll always be there
Tell me that you mean what you said
And you'll be there
I'll be there

You made this place here my home
That feeling like I'm not alone
There's time now for us to grow
You met me on the corner down Main Street

Whatever happened to those lights we stole?
Whatever happened to those roads as you draw for me?
Whatever happened to those stories you told me
For falling asleep?
For falling asleep

Tell me there's no need to be scared
Tell me that you'll always be there
Tell me that you mean what you said
And you'll be there
I'll be there
