		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You’re whining bitching all day long
You don’t connect you don’t belong
When you wanna ‘fess up and you wanna come clean
It’s like taking a kick in the spleen

Could you dial back just a notch I’m asking…
Will you won’t you do you don’t you
With the insecurities that you’re masking
Not that I would do but could you

You wear things out like the air we breathe
You care about things like what’s underneath
You rant about shit and nobody cares
Take a tumble down in a flight of stairs

Could you dial back just a notch I’m asking…
Will you won’t you do you don’t you
With the insecurities that you’re masking
Not that I would do but could you

Your sob stories are the oldest ones in the book
Will you won’t you do you don’t you
That’s what we call a storm in a tea cup
Not that I would do but could you

So could you dial back a notch I’m asking..
Will you won’t you do you don’t you
With the insecurities you’re masking
Not that I would do but could you

Your sob stories are the oldest ones in the book
Will you won’t you do you don’t you
That’s what we call a storm in a tea cup
Not that I would do but could you
