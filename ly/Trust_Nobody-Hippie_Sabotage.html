		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't trust nobody
I don't even trust my mind
I'm losin' everybody
They can never take the grind
People always switchin' sides
People always hit my line
Never ask me how I'm doin'
They just wanna waste my time
So I don't hate nobody
Just stay up out my life
And I won't hurt nobody
So just stay up out my sights
People always hold me down
They just told me that I'd drown
When you livin' how I'm livin'
All these leeches come around

'Cause we don't trust nobody
We don't even trust our minds
Losin' everybody
From them drugs to suicide
I was always gettin' high
Never took a look outside
I was livin' in the dark
Thinkin' I would never shine

Now I got everybody
If I want it then it's mine
I help everybody
I'm thinkin' back when it was time
I was broken, I was down
I was lost but now I'm found
I was fightin' in the trenches
With no one ever around
So fuck everybody
If you want it come and get it
I won't hurt nobody
I'm a motherfuckin' menace
I was showerin' at the school
I was sleepin' out the Civic
I was sleepin' on my meals
I was reachin' all my lyrics

I don't trust nobody
I don't even trust my mind
I'm losin' everybody
They can never take the grind
People always switchin' sides
People always hit my line
Never ask me how I'm doin'
They just wanna waste my time
So I don't hate nobody
Just stay up out my life
And I won't hurt nobody
So just stay up out my sights
People always hold me down
They just told me that I'd drown
When you livin' how I'm livin'
All these leeches come around

'Cause they robbed all my money
And I'll never get it back
I don't fault nobody
'Cause I'm comin' fuckin' back
I just listen to my loyals
But they just don't listen back
See they got this full disclosure
And they comin' for my neck
They don't know shit about me
So just give me my respect
All the music that I've made
I ain't never got a check

I been doin' all this shit
With like two hands behind my back
I just focus on my shows
'Cause that's the only thing that's left
You don't know shit about me
That's the reason why you don't come around me
You're scared of me cause I'm talkin' loudly
You can blow that smoke
Won't come around me
You can talk that shit but don't know about it
I see that shit don't talk about it
But I will spray no silver at it
'Cause it's five years
I don't own shit and I'm still drivin'

Like fuck
