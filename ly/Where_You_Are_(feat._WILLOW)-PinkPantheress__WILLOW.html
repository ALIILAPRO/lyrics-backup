		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I suffer in silence, I still don't know why I guess
I move for another (another)
A flower, I'm growing, wilted, today I chose it
To leave you tonight, you don't want it, do you?

ohh, ohh
I don't know what to do
I wish that I never met you, no

This last year I've been through
Several feelings that you
Didn't once let me choose (you turned on me)

I now look back when we yelled
it's reminiscent, I held
The hope to find someone else

So, please tell me where you are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are
Now my life's a downward spiral
Got my broken heart recycled
Please tell me where you are, are, are, are, are, are
I've lost sight of what to do
Don't spend one day in my shoes
Now tell me where you are (are, are, are, are, are)

You tell me it will be okay 
but I know it will never be the same (this feeling)
I know that I can't work with maybe
Please tell me that you want to meet again

I never thought I'd want to just jump right out my head
Never really thought I'd ever question what you said
In my bed, in my room, I can't forget
So many hopes, so many dreams
Know it isn't what it fucking seems

I don't know what to do
I wish that I never met you, no
I don't know what to do
I wish that I never met you, no

So, please tell me where you are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are
Now my life's a downward spiral
Got my broken heart recycled
Please tell me where you are, are, are, are, are, are
I've lost sight of what to do
Don't spend one day in my shoes
Now tell me where you are (are, are, are, are, are)

You tell me it will be okay 
but I know it will never be the same (this feeling)
I know that I can't work with maybe
Please tell me that you want to meet again
