		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He came and met me in the bathroom
A little like a younger Jeff Goldblum
About to take my heart and break it pretty soon

Oh, Oh, hey, hey, what else was I supposed to do?
Oh, hey, hey, I'd give it all away for you
Oh, hey, hey, what else was I supposed to do?
Oh, hey, hey, I'd give it all away for you

I didn't take the time to listen to his name
So just for now, I'll call him Ichabod Crane
My Sleepy Hollow baby standing in the rain

Oh, hey, hey, what else was I supposed to do?
Oh, hey, hey, I'd give it all away for you
Oh, hey, hey, what else was I supposed to do?
Oh, hey, hey, I'd give it all away for you 

Now I'ma cruisin' for a bruisin'
Tired of pickin' and choosin'
It's got me losing sight of everythin' I'm doing

Oh, hey, hey, what else was I supposed to do?
Oh, hey, hey, I'd give it all away for you
Oh, hey, hey, what else was I supposed to do?
Oh, hey, hey, I'd give it all away for you
