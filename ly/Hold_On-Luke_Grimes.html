		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hold me but I don't recommend that you adore me
If you do, don't say I didn't warn you
Trust me, I know how to start a fire from a flame

Oh, I always
Leave before the curtain hits the floorboard 
When I hear you talking like you know me 
You don't know me, you don't know me

Wish that I could not go crazy
Wish that I could make you hate me
Maybe I should change my name and run
So I don't have to hold on

Maybe you and I would make it
It ain't the kind of risk I'm taking
Maybe I should change my name and run, run, run 
So I don't have to hold on
Hold on, hold on

I'm only human and I get a little lonely
But I don't wanna hit you while I'm falling 
While I'm falling, while I'm falling

Wish that I could not go crazy
Wish that I could make you hate me
Maybe I should change my name and run
So I don't have to hold on

Maybe you and I would make it
It ain't the kind of risk I'm taking
Maybe I should change my name and run, run, run 
So I don't have to hold on
Hold on, hold on

Wish that I could not go crazy
I wish that I could make you hate me 
Maybe I should change my name and run 
So I don't have to hold on

Maybe you and I would make it
It ain't the kind of risk I'm taking
Maybe I should change my name and run, run, run 
So I don't have to hold on
Hold on, hold on
