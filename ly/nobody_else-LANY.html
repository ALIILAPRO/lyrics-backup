		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  California sunshine
But sometimes it's gonna rain
I wish it was always blue skies
But they can turn to gray
Work yourself to the bone
But sometimes you just can't win
Life ain't about what you do
It's who you do it with

So let me know

Would ya lend a hand to me if I needed help?
Would ya keep me company when I'm by myself?
And if heaven doesn't want us
Would you go with me to hell?
Hope you know I don't want nobody else

There's just no way around it
One day we're gonna die
If we can't live forever
Let's laugh until we cry
We can go to Paris, go to bed
It's all a crazy trip
But life ain't about what you do
It's who you do it with

So let me know

Would ya lend a hand to me if I needed help?
Would ya keep me company when I'm by myself?
And if heaven doesn't want us
Would you go with me to hell?
Hope you know I don't want nobody else

Would ya lend a hand to me if I needed help?
Would ya keep me company when I'm by myself?
And if heaven doesn't want us
Would ya go with me to hell?
Hope you know I don't want nobody else

Would ya call me back in the middle of the night?
Would ya kiss and make up after a stupid fight?
If I share my darkest secrets
Would you promise not to tell?
Hope you know I'd do these things as well
Hope you know I don't want nobody else
