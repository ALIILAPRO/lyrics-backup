		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got somethin' to say, please, don't stop me 'til I'm done
This isn't me bein' dramatic, God knows this part isn't fun
I didn't drive two full hours just to mess with your head
Listen to me closely, this is our love's dyin' breath

Oh, I tried to be someone else for this love, but oh, does it feel so strange
'Cause I know my mind won't change

I miss the old you but that ain't the whole truth
'Cause baby, you changed and so have I
You miss the old me, so young, dumb and happy
But that girl is gone and now it's time
Oh, to kiss me goodbye

Every room you walked in, effortlessly you'd shine
I was happy just to be there, watching from the sideline
And this room is on fire, but we're dancing real slow
Can't pretend anymore, even my dad knows

Oh, I tried to be someone else for this love, but oh, does it feel so strange
'Cause I know my mind won't change

I miss the old you but that ain't the whole truth
'Cause baby, you changed and so have I (so have I, so have I, so have I)
You miss the old me, so young, dumb and happy
But that girl is gone and now it's time
Oh, to kiss me goodbye

Bye, bye
Bye, bye
Bye, bye
Bye
So kiss me goodbye
