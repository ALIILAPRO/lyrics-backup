		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Close your eyes and rise as oceans
Breathin' floatin' across tha way
Underneath you all sorts and motions
As this blue horizons calls

And no God no man can control where you roam
As the current serves my motor
I'm pushing on now awake
Like the ocean fells your waves

Tentacles to crush rocks on shores
Tides devoid of emotion 
All your wonderful dreams washed away
As I stand on the sand being dragged by your hand

Like an anchor that's bringing me down
Below the water, cause man
He can he can control where you roam
Now rest as oceans 

Be still, yet always in constant motion
Quiet yet never afraid
Silent yet always awake
And no God or mar can dictate where you stand

No boundaries cast, forever you last
As the ocean calls your name
