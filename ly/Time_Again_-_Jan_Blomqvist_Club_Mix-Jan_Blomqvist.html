		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dawn came at ten
You left at eight
Time, time again
I came too late

Realize that things just weren't workin'
Pretending that we were both blind
A billboard with couple hang frozen
Lunch on the terrace, like the dead we dine
When I wanna sleep, you're just wakin'
I set a fire, you complain 'bout the cold
Just like our sunny occasions
Stunning pictures, they'll stay on the roll

Through love 'til hate
Goes round again
Wake up too late
No sense or plan
Shirtless and weak
Comfortably numb
Words wouldn't speak
Don't leave my tongue

Finger rests over the button
Blank looks whiter than white
When you said it all, you said nothing
The end comes without a fight (fight)
We're close at the start without thinking
Caught up after one Berlin night
Then red flags and warning lights blinkin'
To cut the ties, time was just never right

Dawn came at ten
You left at eight
Time, time again
I came too late
You left at eight
I came at ten
You didn't wait
Time and time again

Obviously
We weren't great
But you are
You're brilliant though
You thought you'd know
But you are
We weren't enough
But you should know
You are
It wasn't right
It's never, but
You are
You are
Yes, you are

Dawn came at ten
You left at eight
Time, time again
I came too late
You left at eight
I came at ten
You didn't wait
Time and time again

Dawn came at ten
You left at eight
Time, time again
I came too late
