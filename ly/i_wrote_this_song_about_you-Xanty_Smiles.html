		  Don't call me
Don't call me
Don't call me
Don't call me
Don't call me
150 on the dashboard
I might fucking crash though
Saw her interest peak when talking bout my cash flow
I cant make it back
No
She breaking her back though
White powder be stuck
In the cracks of her iPhone
150 on the dashboard
I might fucking crash though
Saw her interest peak when talking bout my cash flow
I cant make it back
No
She breaking her back though
White powder be stuck
In the cracks of her iPhone
And don't you fucking say that you forgot me
I remember you looked pissed off when you saw me
At that party
Do you remember?
I know you remember
In the bathtub of your friends house
And I forgot what you where talking about
My eyes meet your lips
And then you turned me down
Fuck
Violet was violent
Take back what you said
Get the fuck out my head
Violet was violent
Take back what you said
Get the fuck out my head
150 on the dashboard
I might fucking crash though
Saw her interest peak when talking bout my cash flow
I cant make it back
No
She breaking her back though
White powder be stuck
In the cracks of her iPhone
150 on the dashboard
I might fucking crash though
Saw her interest peak when talking bout my cash flow
I cant make it back
No
She breaking her back though
White powder be stuck
In the cracks of her iPhone
