Four, five, six, ten ratchets on 'em
Ten niggas with 'em, ten clappin' on 'em
Dead niggas with 'em, dead niggas, get 'em
Four-five rip 'em, four-five zip 'em
You talk money, young niggas with 'em
Young niggas get 'em, beluga, beluga, beluga
I fell in love with the Ruger
I fell in love with my jeweler
I fell in love with the mula
Banana clips is going through ya
It's all about the rule, it's all about the move, all about the rules
