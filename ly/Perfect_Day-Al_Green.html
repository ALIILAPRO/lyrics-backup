		<p>
		  Just a perfect day, drink wine in the park
Then later, when it gets dark, we go home
Just a perfect day, feed animals in the zoo
Then later, a movie too and we go home

Oh, just a perfect day
I'm glad I spent it with you
Such a perfect day
You just keep me hanging on
You just keep me hanging on, oh yeah

Just a perfect day, problems all left alone
Weekends on our own, it's such fun, oh, oh
Just a perfect day, you made me forget myself
I thought I was someone else, even someone good

Just a perfect day
I'm glad I spent it with you
Mmm, such a perfect day
You just keep me hanging on, yeah
You just keep me hanging on, hey, hey

You're going to reap just what you sow, don't you know, hey, hey
You're going to reap just what you sow, hey, hey, don't you know, oh
You're going to reap just what you sow, oh, be glad to know, hey, hey, ah
You're going to reap just what you sow, don't you know (slow down baby, slow down baby)

You're going to reap just what you sow (oh, I love you, I love you)
You're going to reap just what you sow, what you sow
