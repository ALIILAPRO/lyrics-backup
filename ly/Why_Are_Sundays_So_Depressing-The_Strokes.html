		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I sing a song
I paint a picture
My baby's gone
I don't miss her
Like a swan
I don't miss swimmin'
All my friends left
And they don't miss me

Can't take it, babe
Your body talks to me
Like in a movie, babe
I let it resonate, yeah

I want your time (time)
Don't ask me questions (questions)
That you don't want (want)
The answers to (to)

I love you in the morning, so you know it's no lie
You're hidin' in the background, but you wanna be found
You've got me on my back and now I've gotta think fast
You're hidin' in the background, but you wanna be found

Life, take it easy, babe, I
I get down, it's automatic, uh
I've come to believin' that
A-too much time is evil

Transition in
I'm making your body wait
Like on an aeroplane
Please baby, take me away, yeah

I want your time (time)
Don't ask me questions (questions)
That you don't want (want)
The answer to (to)

(I know)
(I know)
(I know)
(I know)

I kinda miss the nine-to-five, yeah
Do those things that you can't hide
I scramble, fight just like a child
Hey, ah, na-na-na-na, ah-ah
I'm stayin' hungry, I'm stayin' hungry
I'm stayin' hungry, I'm stayin' hungry
Not gettin' angry, I'm stayin' hungry
Not gettin' angry, still stayin' hungry
Yeah

(Hold on, hold on)
The click was always in you, Fab
(It was never on)
It was never on
