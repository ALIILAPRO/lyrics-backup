		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Believing that he's animal he thinks he has the right to)

I been on the bottom feeling nothing but ambitious
I been on my grind for that number one position
Said that I should get a label but it's under some conditions
Tell 'em , "Suck a dick and mind your motherfucking business"
I'm the trillest, yo
Knee deep in the game and invested
Ain't nobody want it, but I came and I blessed it
Yeah, came with a bang and I wreck shit
Y'all just rap for the fame and affection
Put 'em on their back like violent shooters
Wanna be the boss, better find consumers
Spread your lies and rumors, I'ma still be winning, hallelujah
Why'd he have to go be this savage?
I've been dope, but I seen Y'all having
Rhyme the most, he got lethal talent
Adios, he gon' shoot, he can't vanish
Yeah, come in and killin' the business
Spit and deliver the sickness
Killin' by fillin' prescriptions
Y'all have been living a bitter existence
Follow my lead, come ride with the beast
When I get in my zone, no stopping the heat
Y'all finna get burned, don't bother, capiche?
Don't ride your waves, tsunami to be
Brush it off but no dust homie
Want smoke? You better puff slowly
I'm in the gym like a young Kobe
'Til I'm on the map, and Y'all fucking know me
Let's go

Hey, I been on the way
Fuck with me, I got plenty to say
I'll shut 'em down
Hey, I'm ready to go
Fuck with me, I got plenty to blow

I've got a lot of goals, I keep writing on the walls
I am making sure you ain't deciding if I fall
Higher than I've ever been, I'm sober though, I'm past that
I'm after some Benjamins, you're focused on your Snapchat, tap that
Fuck a broad, I'm going abroad, don't need none of Y'all
Underdog, we could run the yard, I don't wanna dog ya
I don't need to be abrasive
But I am fully evasive
Do what I wanna do and make it beautiful and full of human, outrageous
They don't really wanna play, they don't really wanna go
They just wanna catch a wave, internet is full of broads
Throwing the shade, sonning them all though, I've got bad seeds
What can I say though? Mistakes happen in the back seats
I wanna drive, you wanna car pool
I wanna dive in, I wanna swerve, curve, and hit the dirt first
I wanna learn from the inamatus
Oh yeah yeah, revamp it
I'm gonna leave that nail in the coffin
And baby b-bone, I'm in the zone, oh no
Let's get this poppin', poppin'
Yeah

Hey, I been on the way
Fuck with me, I got plenty to say
I'll shut 'em down
Hey, I'm ready to go
Fuck with me, I got plenty to blow
I'll shut 'em down
Hey, I been on the way
Fuck with me, I got plenty to say
I'll shut 'em down
Hey, I'm ready to go
Fuck with me, I got plenty to blow
I'll shut 'em down
I'll shut 'em down
I'll shut 'em down
