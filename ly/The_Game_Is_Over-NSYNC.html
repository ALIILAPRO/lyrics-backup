		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The game is over
Ah yeah
Ah yeah

Invincible
Is what you think you are
But you're just so typical
Though you think that you're a star
You act like
Everyone revolves around you
Baby you dropped the ball
And now the game is through

'Cause you tried to play both sides
You got caught up in your lies
And now you're running
You're running out of time

[Chorus]
You played yourself (Game over, game)
But did you, did you think
That you could really find love from someone else
You're making moves,
You're gonna lose, you know
You played yourself (Game over, game)
And now you're thinkin', thinkin' you can get one by me
But you'll never win, but you'll never win
Try again,
'cause the game is over

Take it personal
'Cause I did
When you cheated on me
You may be beautiful
But there's more
That the eye can see
You're so predictable
The way you calculate each move
Heads I win
Tails you lose
Because you don't have
The right to choose

'Cause you tried to play both sides
You got caught up in your lies
And now you're running
You're running out of time

[Chorus]

Yeah
Woo

How could you think that
You could do me like that?
Running behind my back
How could you do me like that?
Now the game is over,
How could you think that you could do me like that?
And now you want me back
How could you do me like that?
Now the game is over,
How could you think that you could do me like that?
Do me like that, do me like that?

[Chorus: x2]
