		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This, I wanna tell you, is the Trenchtown experience
All the way from Trenchtown, Jamaica
Bob Marley and the Wailers, come on!

One good thing about music, when it hits you feel no pain
One good thing about music, when it hits you feel no pain
So hit me with music, hit me with music now, yeah
Hit me with music, hit me with music now, got to say

(Trenchtown rock) I say don't watch that
(Trenchtown rock) big fish or sprat
(Trenchtown rock) you reap what you sow
(Trenchtown rock) and everyone know now
(Trenchtown rock) don't turn your back
(Trenchtown rock) give the slum a try
(Trenchtown rock) never let the children cry
(Trenchtown rock) 'cause you got to tell Jah-Jah why you're

(Grooving) Kingston 12
(Grooving) Kingston 12
(Grooving) whoa, whoa, whoa, it's Kingston 12
(Grooving) it's Kingston 12
No want you fe galang so
No want you fe galang so
You want come cold I up
But you can't come cold I up
'Cause I'm grooving, yes I'm grooving

I say one good thing, one good thing
When it hits you feel no pain
One good thing about music
When it hits you feel no pain
So hit me with music
Hit me with music now
Hit me with music, hit me with music, now look at that

(Trenchtown rock) I say don't watch that
(Trenchtown rock) if you big fish or sprat
(Trenchtown rock) you reap what you sow
(Trenchtown rock) and everyone know now
(Trenchtown rock) don't turn your back
(Trenchtown rock) give the slum a try
(Trenchtown rock) never let the children cry
(Trenchtown rock) 'cause you got to tell Jah-Jah why you're

(Grooving, grooving)
(Grooving, grooving)

No want you fe galang so
No want you fe galang so
Want come cold I up
But you can't come cold I up
'Cause I'm grooving, lord, I'm grooving

I say one good thing, one good thing
When it hits you feel no pain
One good thing about music
When it hits you feel no pain
So hit me with music
Hit me with music now
Hit me with music
Brutalize me with music

It's Trenchtown rock
It's Trenchtown rock
It's Trenchtown rock
It's Trenchtown rock
It's Trenchtown rock
It's Trenchtown rock
It's Trenchtown rock
It's Trenchtown rock
