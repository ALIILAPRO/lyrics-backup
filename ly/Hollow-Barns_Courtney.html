		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Usually, it wouldn't mean shit
But you're alright
With eyes like lasers through the mist
Burning souls alive
With one shut eye untouched
By the brighter light
You could be denser than some
With 20/20 sight

You could burn up like kinder flay
Could plug up to razor blade
Or you could just throw me away
Because I'm hollow
Fire flint sparks off in the dark
Tear up boys and call it art
Oh you can hollow out your heart
So we can be hollow

Fill me up and I'll follow
Cause pride's hard to swallow
Times like these make us hollow
Hollow, hollow
Fill me up and I'll follow
Cuz pride's hard to swallow
Times like these make us hollow
Hollow, hollow

Good optics see through my words
On my bakelite
Crawl down and see what they heard
The underground's alive
My mind is getting kinda dumb
Hollow out the sides
Then bring the shooting squad and some
And leave my heart behind

You could burn up like kinder flay
Could plug up to razor blade
Or you could just throw me away
Because I'm hollow
Fire flint sparks off in the dark
Tear up boys and call it art
Oh you can hollow out your heart
So we can be hollow

Fill me up and I'll follow
Cause pride's hard to swallow
Times like these make us hollow
Hollow, hollow
Fill me up and I'll follow
Cause pride's hard to swallow
Times like these make us hollow
Hollow, hollow

Oh, down the mountain runs
We're the hollow ones
Forever
Oh, not the underground
Or the overproud
Forever
Hollow, hollow

Fill me up and I'll follow
Cause pride's hard to swallow
Times like these make us hollow
Hollow, hollow
Fill me up and I'll follow
Cause pride's hard to swallow
Times like these make us hollow
Hollow, hollow
