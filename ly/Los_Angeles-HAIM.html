		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Los Angeles
Give me a miracle, I just want out from this
I've done my share of helpin' with your defense
But now I can't dismiss
It's killin' me
Hometown of mine
Just got back from the boulevard, can't stop cryin'
The guy at the corner shop gave me a line and a smile
I know he was tryin'
But a lie is a lie

Oh, these days, these days, I can't win
These days I can't see no visions
I'm breakin', losin' faith
These days, these days
(These days, these days)
These days, these days
(These days, these days)

New York is cold
I tried the winter there once, nope
Clearly the greatest city in the world
But it was not my home
I felt more alone

These days, these days, I can't win
These days I can't see no visions
I'm breakin', losin' faith
These days, these days
(These days, these days)
I'm thinkin' 'bout leavin'

Sometimes I speed down Crescent Heights
Can't hardly feel it running every light
But I wasn't fazed, 'cause it wasn't mine
Was I just dreaming?

And every time I think I might (send my love, send my tears)
Leave this city for the first time (wavin' back to my fears)
(City of mine)
I wake up on the other side (send my love, send my tears)
Wondering, "Was I just dreamin'?" (Wavin' back to my fears)
(City of mine)
Was I just dreamin'?

(Send my love, send my tears)
(Wavin' back to my fears)
(City of mine)
Was I just dreamin'?
