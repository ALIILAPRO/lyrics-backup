		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every day our lives are just in between, incomplete
So tell me
Why we live in a cage when we want to be free, what else do we need?

Just tell me
Why do we fake ourselves just to succeed, to hear "repeat"?
Please tell me
Every day our lives are just in between
So will you take my

Take my hands
We are the wave from the new revolution
Take my hands
We are, we are, we are the wave

We will climb up a tree without planting a seed, can you see?
So tell me
How we long to trust in what the leaders preach, misery
Just tell me
Why do we lie to ourselves to justify our needs, to hear "repeat"?
Please tell me
Every change once started out is a dream

Take my hands
We are the wave from the new evolution
Take my hands
We are, we are, we are the wave
You will need us, we won't give up
So take my hands
We are, we are, we are the wave

This is a new age
We're running out of time
Save me from myself

We are, we are
We are, we are
We are the wave from the new revolution
We are, we are
We are, we are
We are the wave from the new revolution
You will need us, we won't give up
So take my hands
We are the wave from the new revolution
