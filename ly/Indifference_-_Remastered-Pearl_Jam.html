		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will light the match this morning so I won't be alone
Watch as she lies silent
For soon light will be gone
Oh I will stand arms outstretched pretend I'm free to roam
Oh I will make my way through one more day in hell
How much difference does it make?
How much difference does it make yeah

I will hold the candle till it burns up my arm
Oh I'll keep takin' punches until their will grows tired
Oh I will stare the sun down until my eyes go blind
Hey, I won't change direction
And I won't change my mind

How much difference does it make?
How much difference does it make?

I'll swallow poison, until I grow immune
I will scream my lungs out till it fills this room

How much difference?
How much difference?
How much difference does it make?
How much difference does it make?
