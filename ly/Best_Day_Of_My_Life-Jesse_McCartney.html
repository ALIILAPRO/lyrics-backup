		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woke up around a half past ten
Can't believe that I'm late again
Put down about a quart of caffeine
To start my pulse and then
I grabbed my jeans off the floor
Then I hit the door
Just the same old same

It goes to show
You never know
When everything's about to change

[Chorus]
Just another day
It started out like any other
Just another girl who took my breath away
Then she turned around
She took me down
Just another day that I had the best day of my life

Can't say exactly what it was 
She's not the usual type
She wore a cowboy hat with her red Prada boots
And a Gwen Stefani smile
Then pulled out a pen
And surprised me when
She wrote her number on my hand

Then she was gone
But from now on I'm gonna be a different man

[Chorus]

I guess it goes to show
You never know when everything's about to change

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
