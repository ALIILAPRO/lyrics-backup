		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As I walk through the valley
Of the shadow of death
I see the friends I thought I had
That fled the battle and left i stand alone
Broken armor hides the scars on my chest
I should have known, here we go
I'm good for one last breath
So meet me in the fuckin' middle, bitch
We'll see who dies first
Yeah, you talk a lot of shit
But I know how your mind works
Yeah, you're just like me
You're always searching for a purpose
Better tread lightly
'cause I can see right through the curtains
Oh my God, fool me once
You know that this means war
Feel the panic runnin' rampant
Can you give me more?
I can't wait to watch you suffer
Watch me take another step
Two can play this little game of
Reign until there's nothing left

Into the fray you cross, follow me
Bow down to the hollow king

As I swing the glaive to your face
I can see the regret
But it's too late, better pray
Hope you're ready for death
Another head up on my mantle
Never thought it'd be you
Let's start a vigil
Light a candle for the you that I knew
I love revenge, nothing like it
Tendencies are awfully violent
I won't bother checking vitals
Throw you off into the fire
Watch you burn, that's what happens, yeah
You're such a fucking rat
Now you've learned, when you cross me
You ain't ever coming back

Now look who's laughing
Stab me in the back
What you think was gonna happen?
Better be fast when you make your casket
Permanent sleep, turn you to ashes
Fucking with me
It's such a shame you make me sick
Now say my name, the game begins
I'm taking my time, been waiting for this
Better make up your mind
How you want it to end?
Bitch, you can't walk where I walk
You can't talk how I talk
You can't run, you can't hide
Nowhere safe, don't waste my time
You signed a line and sealed your fate
Look in your eyes, I see disgrace
Bring down the skies with death's embrace
You're shaking
I can't fucking wait to make you pay

Into the fray
You better wait to hear your tragedy
Such a shame
You'll probably turn into a casualty
