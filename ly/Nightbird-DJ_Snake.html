		  My girl is a nightbird, she put in all that night work
Mornings you can't find her, but night go down she flies
My girl is a night bird, she puts in all that night work
Friends don't call her nice words, but she pay them no mind

My girl is a nightbird, she put in all that night work
Mornings you can't find her, but night go down she flies
My girl is a night bird, she puts in all that night work
Friends don't call her nice words, but she pay them no mind

My girl is a nightbird, she put in all that night work
Mornings you can't find her, but night go down she flies
My girl is a night bird, she puts in all that night work
Friends don't call her nice words, but she pay them no mind

Work
Work
My girl is a
Work
Work

Work
Work
My girl is a
Work
Work

Monday she's at 1OAK
And Wednesday she's at Bellows
AP on her elbow
And she can't tell time
Everybody know, know
But she don't do no promo
She cool with the owner
So she don't wait in line

Night time she flies
Night time she flies
Night time she flies
Night time she flies

Night time she flies
Night time she flies
Night time she flies
Night time she flies

My girl is a nightbird, she put in all that night work
Mornings you can't find her, but night go down she flies
My girl is a night bird, she puts in all that night work
Friends don't call her nice words, but she pay them no mind

Work
Work
My girl is a
Work
Work

Work
Work
My girl
Work
Work
