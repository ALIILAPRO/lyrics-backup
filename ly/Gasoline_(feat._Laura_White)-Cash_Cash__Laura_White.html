		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Crash into me like a car
Hit me with adrenaline
I know that we shouldn't stop
Turning up the heat again
Oh, no

Don't love anyone else
Don't let any air in
Don't need anyone else
Wearing what your wearin'
Ain't no way to say no
Caught up in attachment
You got my attention

There's no end to you and me
It's like putting out, fire with gasoline
And when we got so close, it's hard to breathe
It's like putting out, fire with gasoline (gasoline, gasoline)
With gasoline
With gasoline
There's no end to you and me
It's like putting out, fire with gasoline

(Gasoline)

Why do I come when you call?
We don't even get along, oh, nah
Chemically our chemicals are dangerously beautiful
Alright

Don't love anyone else
Don't let any air in
Don't need anyone else
Wearing what your wearin'
Ain't no way to say no
Caught up in attachment
You got my attention

There's no end to you and me
It's like putting out, fire with gasoline
And when we got so close, it's hard to breathe
It's like putting out, fire with gasoline (gasoline, gasoline)
With gasoline
Fire with gasoline

(Gasoline)

Crash into me like a car
Hit me with adrenaline, yeah
I know that we shouldn't stop
Turning up the heat again, oh, nah
Fire
It's hard to breathe
Fire (yeah)

There's no end to you and me
It's like putting out, fire with gasoline (it's hard to breathe)
And when we got so close, it's hard to breathe
It's like putting out, fire with gasoline (gasoline, gasoline)
With gasoline
With, with gasoline
With gasoline
(Gasoline)
