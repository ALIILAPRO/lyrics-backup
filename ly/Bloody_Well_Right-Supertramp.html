		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So you think your schooling's phony
I guess it's hard not to agree
You say it all depends on money
And who is in your family tree

Right (right), you're bloody well right
You got a bloody right to say
Right, you're bloody well right
You know you got a right to say

Ha, ha, you're bloody well right
You know you're right to say
Yeah, yeah, you're bloody well right
You know you're right to say
Me, I don't care anyway

Write your problems down in detail
Take them to a higher place
You've had your cry, no, I shouldn't say wail
In the meantime hush your face
Right (quite right) you're bloody well right

You got a bloody right to say
Right, you're bloody well right
You know you got a right to say

Ha, ha, you're bloody well right
You know you're right to say
Yeah, yeah, you're bloody well right
You know you got a right to say

You got a bloody right to say
You got a bloody right to say
You got a bloody right to say
You got a bloody right to say, yeah
