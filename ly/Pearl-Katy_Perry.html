		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She is a pyramid
But with him she's just a grain of sand
This love's too strong like Mice and Men
Squeezing out the life that should be let in

She was a hurricane-cane-cane-cane
But now she's just a gust of wind
She used to set the sails of a thousand ships
Was a force to be reckoned with

She could be a Statue of Liberty
She could be a Joan of Arc
But he's scared of the light that's inside of her
So he keeps her in the dark

Oh, she used to be a pearl, oh
Yeah, she used to rule the world, oh
Can't believe she's become a shell of herself
'Cause she used to be a pearl

She was unstoppable
Moved fast as light, like an avalanche
But now she's stuck deep in cement
Wishing that they'd never ever met

She could be a Statue of Liberty
She could be a Joan of Arc
But he's scared of the light that's inside of her
So he keeps her in the dark

Oh, she used to be a pearl, oh
Yeah, she used to rule the world, oh
Can't believe she's become a shell of herself
'Cause she used to be a

Do you know that there's a way out,
There's a way out
There's a way out
There's a way out

You don't have to be held down,
Be held down
Be held down
Be held down

'Cause I used to be a shell
Yeah, I let him rule my world
My world, oh, yeah

But I woke up and grew strong
And I can still go on
And no one can take my pearl

You don't have to be shell, no
You're the one that rules your world, oh
You are strong and you'll learn
That you can still go on

And you'll always be a pearl

She is unstoppable
