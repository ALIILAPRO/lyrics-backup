		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What if, what if we run away?
What if, what if we left today?
What if we said goodbye to safe and sound? (And sound)
What if, what if we're hard to find?
What if, what if we lost our minds?
What if we let them fall behind and the're never found? (Never found)

And when the lights start flashin' like a photo booth
And the stars exploding, we'll be fireproof

My youth
My youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth
My youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth
My youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours

What if, what if we start to drive?
(What if) what if we close our eyes?
(What if) we're speeding through red lights into paradise? (Paradise)
'Cause we've no time for getting old
Mortal body, timeless souls
Cross your fingers, here we go
Oh, oh, oh

And when the lights start flashin' like a photo booth
And the stars exploding, we'll be fireproof

My youth
My youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth
My youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth
My youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours

My youth is yours

My youth
My youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth
My youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth
My youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours

Oh, oh, oh
My youth is yours
Oh, oh, oh
My youth is yours
