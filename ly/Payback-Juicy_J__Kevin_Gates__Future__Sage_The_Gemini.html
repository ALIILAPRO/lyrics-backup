		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know something you don't that's me coming for you
You want war, we got war, we just wanna warn you

I know something you don't that's me coming for you
You want war, we got war, we just wanna warn you

War for war, bodies that hit the ground
You ready for us, 'cause its about to go down
Push 'em to the left, push 'em to the right
Load them choppers up, hit 'em on sight
Never turning back, I've done been in hell and back
Me running out of guns, nah never heard of that
I ain't never ran from a gunfight
This is you and me Mano Y Mano your damn right

Don't act like you don't know
Know what I came for
Too late to turn back
This is the payback
You take one, I take one
You can't hide you can't run
Too late to turn back
This is the payback

Respiratory begging for relief, I don't let 'em breathe
Going hard I'm my own boss, many ain't believe it,
A feeling not an item, appearing up out of thin air
Conquer everything that's in front of me, now they under me
Rush to lead and respond, they strayed away how a tunnel be
Took a leap of faith bungee cord about to give out
Nowadays whatever you say you gotta live out
Altitude have a parachute failure we got a problem
Grow a set of wings or die when you hit the bottom
Never prayed to god, but never too late to try him
Shots fired, Allen Iverson in the league
They say I ball hog and I'm not a part of the team
Breadwinner with these winners, built the regime
Taliban weapon in hand, kill everything
Amphetamines alter the state of a better means
I'm beautiful but known for the dope like Medellin

Don't act like you don't know
Know what I came for
Too late to turn back
This is the payback
You take one, I take one
You can't hide you can't run
Too late to turn back
This is the payback

Don't act like you don't know
Know what I came for
Too late to turn back
This is the payback
You take one, I take one
You can't hide you can't run
Too late to turn back
This is the payback

Dressing all black like a funeral
Murder, homicide wanna ride get residuals
Living on fire for residuals
365 when I grind for residuals
45 magnum in the van with 'em
Ratta tatta tat I let the blam hit 'em
I scream fuck the whole world and put a bomb in it
Finger on the trigger tryna put my whole arm in it
I just want revenge
I just want revenge
We get it poppin' everyday
They took away my happiness, they try to take my head away

Don't act like you don't know
Know what I came for
Too late to turn back
This is the payback
You take one, I take one
You can't hide you can't run
Too late to turn back
This is the payback

Don't act like you don't know
Know what I came for
Too late to turn back
This is the payback
You take one, I take one
You can't hide you can't run
Too late to turn back
This is the payback
