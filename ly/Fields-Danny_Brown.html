		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Money talk only broke people listen
Ain't gotta pot to piss in can't afford to pay attention
These unfamiliar niggas be expecting recognition
Respect the intellect let me continue on the mission
I used to walk through alleys, paths in the field
You know that one house where Kenneth and 'em use to live
Now it's just another shortcut to the store
The TV in the window drew the line of what was rich and poor
Mommy gave me food stamps told me buy wonder bread
On the way these niggas jumped me, left me wit' knots on my head
Went to school yesterday and to had leave early
'Cause niggas said they was gon' jump me at 3:30
All because I lived in the hood who they had beef with
And I ain't tell em, dog, I kept that shit a secret
But I can't really trip, niggas looked out for me
Them same niggas played me ain't around to tell the story
I'm just young nigga on the D.O.t
With my headphones on and sack full of weed
Rhymes in my head thought nobody wanted to hear em
So I had the fiends hitting rocks like the Pilgrims

And where I lived
It was house, field, field
Field field, house
Abandoned house, field, field

And where I lived
It was house, field, field
Field field, house
Abandoned house, field, field

That nigga much sicker
That's why he pop them pills, sip lean, smoke swishers
Yea I'm doing drugs thought I never ever try
That had my eyes so dry, dog I wish I could cry
I'm fucking bad foreign bitches while you in the hood
Smoking on some dirt weed smelling like some fire wood
Sitting on porches of abandoned houses
Or sitting in the field on bed bug ridden couches
It's like they all forgot man nobody care about us
That why we all ways end up in prison instead of college
Living in the system working kitchen for chump change
Lost in the streets niggas playing that gun game
Where nobody wins just a bunch of mommas losing
Dead body in the field, nobody heard the shooting
We living in the streets where the options is limited
Because its burnt building instead of jobs and businesses

And where I lived
It was house, field, field
Field field, house
Abandoned house, field, field

And where I lived
It was house, field, field
Field field, house
Abandoned house, field, field
