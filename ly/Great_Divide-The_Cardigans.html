		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a monster growing in our heads 
Raised up on the wicked things we've said 
A great divide between us now 
Something we should know 

There's something to remember 
And something to forget 
As long as we remember 
There's something to regret 

Something we should know 
There's a mountain higher than we knew 
It's high but such a bitter view 
A great divide between us now 

Something we should know 
A great divide between us now 
On different sides of a great divide
