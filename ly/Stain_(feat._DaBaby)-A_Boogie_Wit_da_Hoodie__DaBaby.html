		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Pooh, you a fool for this one)
(Go Grizz)
Put a stain on a nigga if he
(Squat made the beat)
Yeah

Put a stain on a nigga if he touch me, yeah
Two hunnid on my neck, ain't gotta tuck it, yeah
They just hatin' 'cause I'm up and bitches love me, yeah
Remember when we used to wear the Polo rugby
I'm just sayin', "Why you actin like a ho?" yeah
Get the Draco and the drum and it's a go, yeah
All I needed was some paper and some 'to, yeah
All it take to get a nigga smoked, yeah

I get money and you don't, I just did like five platinums in a row
I'm that nigga, no cappin', I'm a GOAT
All these niggas flow jackin' and I know
And your bitch layin', yeah, she wanna kick it
YSL wearin' ass nigga in a Benzy
And your girlfriend keep plottin' on my wishlist
Have her stalkin', yeah, I just left her in a frenzy

Ooh, she love it, fuckin' and suckin' dick, yeah
Now she trippin', talkin' 'bout she wanna kiss me
I was busy, I was tryna bum giffies
Split it fifty-fifty with my (yeah, whoa)

Put a stain on a nigga if he touch me, yeah (whoa)
Two hunnid on my neck, ain't gotta tuck it, yeah (whoa)
They just hatin' 'cause I'm up and bitches love me, yeah
Remember when we used to wear the Polo rugby
I'm just sayin', "Why you actin like a ho?" Yeah (whoa)
Get the Draco and the drum and it's a go, yeah
All I needed was some paper and some 'to, yeah
All it take to get a nigga

Yeah, you know that's all it take to get a nigga smoked and that's a fact
I be nuttin' quick like I'm a virgin, when we fuck, her ass too fat
I had to fly into New Jersey 'cause New York don't like the strap
We make the nigga front us thirty and we ran off with the sack (nah, keep going, keep going)
Lil' nigga, you asked to get it (ha)
Bitch, I've been the best since a kid in the neighborhood, when playin' tag was lit (let's go)
I used to hit licks in my whip, had to switch up the plates so the tags was different (yeah, bitch)
And I used to fuck on them sixes and sevens
Now we fuck the baddest bitches (ten)
I'ma go get the bag, I ain't trippin', I ain't into goin' outside with niggas (uh, uh)
And I ain't goin' sad 'bout a bitch
I got hoes on my dick, that be tryna harass a nigga (yeah)
That lil' nigga ain't goin' for shit, they gon' come with them sticks
We gon' pull up and smash on niggas (bitch)
See the look on my face, they gon' laugh at niggas
Last nigga to play know what happened, nigga?
They know I

Put a stain on a nigga if he touch me, yeah
Two hunnid on my neck, ain't gotta tuck it, yeah
They just hatin' 'cause I'm up and bitches love me, yeah
Remember when we used to wear the Polo rugby
I'm just sayin', "Why you actin like a ho?" Yeah
Get the Draco and the drum and it's a go, yeah
All I needed was some paper and some 'to, yeah
All it take to get a nigga smoked, yeah
