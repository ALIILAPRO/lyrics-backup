		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You love to be a troublemaker
Leave me now, then fuck me later
It's always later, later, later
And I let you come back 'cause sticking 'round is in my nature
And tolerating bad behavior
You know that I do that
You love that I do that

You, you know my weaknesses
You banking I break all my rules
Yes, you take advantage, know how to manage my whole fucking planet

You've been playing wicked games
You know what you do to me
I tried to stay steady in my lane
But you try to make me misbehave
Fucking up my energy
One day I'll be over all them wicked games, yeah

Always show up when I'm fiending
And in the moment it's appealing
But you so good disappearing
And I'm just so bad at the truth

You, you know my weaknesses
You banking I break all my rules
Yes, you take advantage, know how to manage my whole fucking planet

You've been playing wicked games
You know what you do to me
I tried to stay steady in my lane
But you try to make me misbehave
Fucking up my energy
One day I'll be over all them wicked games, yeah yeah

I keep holding on
I keep holding on
Wonder who you are without all the games, yeah, yeah
I keep holding on (you been playing games)
I keep holding on (I'm making mistakes)
Wonder who you are without all them games, yeah (please don't do that, yeah)
I keep holding on (you been playing games)
I keep holding on (I'm making mistakes)
Wonder who you are without all them games, yeah (please don't do that, don't do that)
I keep holding on (I keep holding on)
I keep holding on
Wonder who you are without all them games, yeah

You've been playing wicked games
And you know what you do to me, yeah
I tried to stay steady in my lane
But you try to make me misbehave
Fucking up my energy
One day I'll be over all them wicked games, yeah, yeah
