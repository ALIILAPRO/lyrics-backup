		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You really like my limousine
You like the way the wheels roll
You like my seven-inch leather heels
And going to all of the shows, but

Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Really love me?

You like the credit cards and private planes
Money can really take you far
You like the hotels and fancy clothes
And the sound of Adzy's guitar but

Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Really love me?

You really like rock and roll
All of the fame and the masquerade
You like the concerts and studios
And all of the money, honey, that I make, but

Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Really love me?

Your backstage pass and your black sunglasses
Make you look just like a queen
Even the fans all know your face
From all of the magazines, oh

Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Really love me?
Do you love me? (Do you love me?)
Do you love me? (Do you love me?)
Do you love me? (Do you love me?)
Really love me? (Really love me?)

Yeah
Do you love me? (Do you love me?)
Oi love, do you love me? (Do you love me?)
You over there, do you love me? (Do you love me?)
You, you, and you, do you love me? (Do you love me?)
Oh, hello sugar, do you love me? (Do you love me?)
Ayy, do you love me? (Do you love me?)
Everybody, do you love me? (Do you love me?)
Woo
Hahaha
