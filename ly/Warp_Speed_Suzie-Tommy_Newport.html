		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  With eyes glazed over again 
I'm Impatient 
Now my hearts racing 
Leaving this station 
As the night comes close to an end 
She’s leaving 
But I’m still needing some more 
Of these feelings 
Do you even want to need me
And would you even let me know
Do you even want to see me
I'm sick of always watching you go

Warp Speed Suzie 
Where did you go 
The speed you're moving 
How would I know 
Warp Speed Suzie 
Warp Speed Suzie 
Won’t you wait up for me
Warp speed Suzie 
Where did you go 
The speed you're moving 
How would I know 
Warp Speed Suzie 
Warp Speed Suzie 
Won’t you wait up for me

And now I’m standing alone 
For a minute 
I swear that we were in it 
For just just a little snippet 
But I guess that I’ll never know 
Cuz like lightning 
She never strikes twice 
But the light is still nice
Do you even want to need me
And would you even let me know
Do you even want to see me
I'm sick of always watching you go

Warp Speed Suzie 
Where did you go 
The speed you're moving 
How would I know 
Warp Speed Suzie 
Warp Speed Suzie 
Won’t you wait up for me
Warp Speed Suzie 
Where did you go 
The speed you're moving 
How would I know 
Warp Speed Suzie 
Warp Speed Suzie 
Won’t you wait up for me

Warp Speed Suzie 
Where did you go 
The speed you're moving 
How would I know 
Warp Speed Suzie 
Warp Speed Suzie 
Won’t you wait up for me
