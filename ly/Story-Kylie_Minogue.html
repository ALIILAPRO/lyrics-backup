		  (You're part of my story)
(You're part of my story)

I had a secret that I kept to myself, yeah
I had a one way ticket that was going nowhere

You could be the one
You could be my sun
Everything is fun 'til the walls come close and
Take away the light
Run into the night
Everything'll be alright
You said

Turn another page
Baby, take the stage
You know the stars are coming out for ya
Ebb and then they flow
Baby, feel the glow
You know, you know, you know

You were the one putting out that fire
And when the rain came down I couldn't get much higher
Yeah

You could be the one
You could be my sun
Everything is fun 'til the walls come close and
Take away the light
Run into the night
Everything'll be alright
You said

Turn another page
Baby, take the stage
You know the stars are coming out for ya (you said)
Ebb and then they flow
Baby, feel the glow
You know, you know, you know (you said)

Turn another page
Baby, take the stage
You know the stars are coming out for ya
Ebb and then they flow
Baby, feel the glow
You know, you know, you know

I didn't walk on the wild side
Or fall in the night sky
I didn't let the world know I, I
I was fighting a big fight
Fighting a dark light
Raging hard on the inside
Hard on the inside

You said
Turn another page
Baby, take the stage
You know the stars are coming out for ya (you said)
Ebb and then they flow
Baby, feel the glow
You know, you know, you know (you said)

Turn another page
Baby, take the stage
You know the stars are coming out for ya
Ebb and then they flow
Baby, feel the glow
You know, you know, you know

You're part of my story
Mm
You're part of my story
(Story, story)
You're part of my story
Mm
You're part of my story
(Story, story, story)
