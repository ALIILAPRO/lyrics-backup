		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You hear me? Go get a calculator, nigga
Ya dig?
Yeah (Krazy Mob)

Broke niggas make me sick
Broke niggas make me sick (yeah)
Broke niggas make me sick (pussy)
Broke niggas make me sick (let's go)
A million worth of ice and cars, I'm a walkin' lick (lick)
I jugg for everything I got, nigga, I wasn't born rich (jugg)
Broke hoes make me sick (sick)
Broke hoes make me sick (yeah)
Broke hoes make me sick
Broke hoes make me sick (broke hoes make me sick)
In the club every night, but the bitch can't pay her rent
Salute to all the hustlers, but a broke bitch make me sick (yeah)

For ghetto birthday, I might buy him a trap house up in london
Broke niggas make me sick and I see money when I vomit
Hope shorty never know I fucked her friend the same way
Long live Wop, he get the load and it be gone the same day
Pull up, bust down AP, this ho probably rape me 'fore we make it home
We gon' spray his mama's spot, it's his fault she ain't safe at home
All this jewelry on my neck, nigga, I wasn't born shinin'
Feds wanna lock me 'cause I ball, I feel like Brittney Griner
Hold up, pointers in my ear, it's kind of hard to hear
Uh, two Lambos in a year, I do this shit for real
Steer that 'Cat, no fear, it's heaven or it's hell
You ain't really got it so just watch that shit you poppin', nigga

Broke niggas make me sick
Broke niggas make me sick (yeah)
Broke niggas make me sick (pussy)
Broke niggas make me sick (let's go)
A million worth of ice and cars, I'm a walkin' lick (lick)
I jugg for everything I got, nigga, I wasn't born rich (jugg)
Broke hoes make me sick (sick)
Broke hoes make me sick (yeah)
Broke hoes make me sick
Broke hoes make me sick (broke hoes make me sick)
In the club every night, but the bitch can't pay her rent
Salute to all the hustlers, but a broke bitch make me sick (yeah)

She got every purse it is, but she ain't got no way to live
Flexin' for the 'Gram, broke as hell, that's just how it is
Fuckin' up a check all these years, I probably blew three M's
Grow it, ship it, get it to the hood, I be gettin' it in
Triple A deps for a stack, get you ten for ten
Every verse, I'm rappin' for the trap, countin', juggin'
Blow a high bag for five racks, that's what we smokin'
Don't call my phone, you know where I'm at when the pack in
Broke niggas make me sick, I hate when a real nigga snitch
She's just for the night, I know that's your bitch
My neck, my wrist got ice, every day, I'm lit
Street smart, I started sellin' bricks, the weed legit

Broke niggas make me sick
Broke niggas make me sick (yeah)
Broke niggas make me sick (pussy)
Broke niggas make me sick (let's go)
A million worth of ice and cars, I'm a walkin' lick (lick)
I jugg for everything I got, nigga, I wasn't born rich (jugg)
Broke hoes make me sick (sick)
Broke hoes make me sick (yeah)
Broke hoes make me sick
Broke hoes make me sick (broke hoes make me sick)
In the club every night, but the bitch can't pay her rent
Salute to all the hustlers, but a broke bitch make me sick (yeah)
