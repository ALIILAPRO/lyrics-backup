		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here comes the dawn, 
im running, 
running to her 
Where is my lover,
Im lost,
Losing desire


Here comes the goddess of my dreams,
Just like a shadow
of a powerful flame,
Can see how naked the night will be ,
feeding desires 
beautiful dreams


Lights out When you show up,
the fire is stronger than ever,  
Hold my hands like the first time,
I beg you to play with fire 


All this time I've been awake,
Yet It felt like a dream,
got a taste of your skin,

 
Under the stars
The summer heat,
Let me lay you down,
And I will lead,
Middle of the night
Just what we need,
My lips on your lips
And we begin

Here comes the goddess of my dreams
Just like a shadow
of a powerful flame
Can see how naked the night will be 
feeding desires
beautiful dreams


Lights out When you show up
the fire is stronger than ever  
Hold my hands like the first time
I beg you to play with fire
