		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  While he was schemin'
I was beamin' in the Beamer, just beamin'
Can't believe that I caught my man cheatin'
So I found another way to make him pay for it all
So I went
To Neiman-Marcus on a shopping spree-ah
And on the way I grabbed Sole and Mia
And as the cash box rang, I thought everything away

(Oops) there goes the dreams we used to say
(Oops) there goes the time we spent away
(Oops) there goes the love I had 
But you cheated on me and that's for that now

(Oops) there goes the house we made a home
(Oops) there goes "You'll never leave me alone"
(Oops) for all the lies you told 
This is what you're owed

Hey ladies
When your man wanna get buck-wild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get your hands on his cash and 
Spend it to the last dime
For all the hard times
Oh, when you go then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let him know that 
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up

While he was braggin'
I was comin' down the hill just draggin'
All his pictures and his clothes in a bag and
Sold everything else 'til there was just nothin' left
And I paid
All the bills about a month too late
It's a shame we have to play these games
The love we had just fades away, away

(Oops) there goes the dreams we used to say
(Oops) there goes the time we spent away
(Oops) there goes the love I had 
But you cheated on me and that's for that now

(Oops) there goes the house we made a home
(Oops) there goes "You'll never leave me alone"
(Oops) for all the lies you told 
This is what you're owed

Hey ladies (hey ladies)
When your man wanna get buck-wild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get your hands on his cash and 
Spend it to the last dime
For all the hard times
Oh (oh), when you go then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let him know that 
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up

Hey ladies (ladies)
When your man wanna get buck-wild (oh)
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get your hands on his cash and 
Spend it to the last dime
For all the hard times
Oh (oh), when you go then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let him know that 
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up

All of the dreams you sold
Left me out in the cold
What happened to the days 
When we used to trust each other?
And all of the things I sold
Will take you until you get old
To get 'em back without me
'Cause revenge is just better than money, you'll see

Hey ladies 
When your man wanna get buck-wild 
Just go back and hit 'em up style (hit 'em up style)
Get your hands on his cash and (oh, yeah)
Oh, when you go then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes (crib to the ride and the clothes, yeah)
So you better let him know that 
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up

(Hey ladies)
Hey ladies
Hey ladies
Hey ladies, yeah
Woah
(Oh)
Oh, oh
Oh no, yeah
Oh

If he messed up you gotta hit 'em up (hit 'em up)
Hey ladies (yeah)
When your man wanna get buck-wild
Just go back and hit 'em up style (oh)
Put your hands on his cash and (da-da-duh-dum, da-duh-dum)
Oh, when you go then everything goes (everything goes)
From the crib to the ride and the clothes (everything goes)
So you better let him know that 
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up
