		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Welcome to my nightmare
I think you're gonna like it
I think you're gonna feel
You belong

A nocturnal vacation
Unnecessary sedation
You want to feel at home
Cause you belong

Welcome to my nightmare, yeah
Welcome to my breakdown
I hope I didn't scare you
That's just the way we are
When we come down

We sweat and laugh and scream here
Cause life is just a dream here
You know inside you feel
Right at home here

Welcome to my breakdown, whoa
You're welcome to my nightmare, yeah

Welcome to my nightmare
I know you're gonna like it
I think you're gonna feel
You belong

We sweat, laugh and scream here
Cause life is just a dream here
You know inside you feel
Right at home here
Welcome to my nightmare, whoa
Welcome to my breakdown

Welcome to my breakdown, whoa
Welcome to my nightmare, yeah
