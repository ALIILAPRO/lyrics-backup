		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I like to wear my human skin outside in disguise
I contort my body into something that you like
Have to sew my innards up, stitch 'em tight, I'm so shy
Hide my ten-foot tongue behind my Hollywood smile
I'm an entity, an apparition looking for a host
I'm darkness's scary sister, dissipate like smoke
I'm freaky, I'm a fetishist, I really like the toes
I unhinge my jaw to swallow you, I don't want to choke

Okay, cool, it's a party with my ghouls
We go "boo," I'm mixing mushies in my juice
Okay, rude, you're drippin' blood on my shoes
I love it when it ooze, I go, "oohie-oohie-ooh"

Crimson swimmin' in the drains
Zipper down the side of my face
Spider eggs in my brain
Aye, aye, aye
Three times, say my name
Can't escape my cold embrace
Drag you to the bottom of the lake
Be my friend

I like to wear my human skin outside in disguise
I contort my body into something that you like
Have to sew my innards up, stitch 'em tight, I'm so shy
Hide my ten-foot tongue behind my Hollywood smile
I'm an entity, an apparition looking for a host
I'm darkness's scary sister, dissipate like smoke
I'm freaky, I'm a fetishist, I really like the toes
I unhinge my jaw to swallow you, I don't want to choke

Okay demons, outside to get me
Your mama wants to party
Something sweet to sink my teeth in
My incisors love a softie
I love homo sapiens, I start my hellos with a hex
I can't seem to make a friend
Like flies on sticky paper, dead

Crimson swimmin' in the drains
Zipper down the side of my face
Spider eggs in my brain
Aye, aye, aye
Three times, say my name
Can't escape my cold embrace
Drag you to the bottom of the lake
Be my friend

I like to wear my human skin outside in disguise
I contort my body into something that you like
Have to sew my innards up, stitch 'em tight, I'm so shy
Hide my ten-foot tongue behind my Hollywood smile
I'm an entity, an apparition looking for a host
I'm darkness's scary sister, dissipate like smoke
I'm freaky, I'm a fetishist, I really like the toes
I unhinge my jaw to swallow you, I don't want to choke

I'm on fire (ooh, ooh)
I like death (ooh, ooh)
I'm a liar (ooh, ooh)
I'm a mess (ooh, ooh)
