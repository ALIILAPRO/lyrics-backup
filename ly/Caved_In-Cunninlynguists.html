		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't hold on, I can't hold on
But I just hold on, I just hold on

Lord why's everybody's puzzle missing pieces
Struggling, grinding, greaseless
No rhyme or reason in sight
I'm seeing the pain off their eyes
I'm seeing that often we lie, lost in our cries
I'm seeing, impatient parents
Blaming unsuspecting children
I'm seeing in patients, critical
Streets are dead from the killings
I'm like damn, block's hot, not from the ozone
Through camera's cops watch these lil boys hold chrome
Stuck, teenagers, foxes and pups
On blocks rocks in they chucks, choppers watchin above
They need love, not snug cuffs, federally fucked
Tis all orchestration Hanz Zimmer couldn't conduct
But whattawedo, most problems dun been discussed
But talk bout actions on the backend, and hush
I guess most of y'all must listen to Rush
Long as you all good, then erebody under you flush

Every time I try and help myself
Reaching out and finding no one else
I can't hold on
So anytime you feel your soul's in need
Realize you can depend on me
And let's just hold on

We slippin far under the ghoul yard
In grim tooms we some dim stars, batteries full barred
At birth, but it's hard to stay charged on earth
Cause world wide like girth, the wise are in the dirt
Grandmama's used to bus us to church
Humming hymms
Strech out a fat meal on the table from something slim
Now we starving, faith on the back of a carton
To find it, follow tracks down arms
And boulevards in the south, park
Watch as mouth art paints audio visuals
Call it rhythmical miracles
And parts what your eyes red see
Throwing change ups in your medley through headpiece
Still Judge, but don't Dredd each day, instead feast
Life's and unfed beast that eats bread and meat
That's, either your cash or your corpse
So I just pray that the Lord helps me last through these wars
Ya know?

Every time I try and help myself
Reaching out and finding no one else
I can't hold on
So anytime you feel your soul's in need
Realize you can depend on me
And let's just hold on

I can't hold on, I can't hold on
But I just hold on, I just hold on
