		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna climb, I wanna dive into the deep blue
I wanna run, I wanna fly but doing it with you
Finding a love, building it up like a cathedral
I wanna see the rest of the world the same way that you do
I wanna be the home that you leave and you return to
I wanna stay here in your arms as long as I can do

The silver hair and golden years
That seem so far until they're near
There's so much left to do down here, I know

All anyone wants is just
More time, more life, more healing
More love, more us, more feeling, yeah
Oh, I just need, I'm just needing
More you, more nights for dreaming
These days go by so fast and I
Oh, I just need, I'm just needing more, oh yeah

(More) oh, I just need, I'm just needing
(More) oh, I just need, I'm just needing
(More) yeah, I just need, I'm just needing more
More, ooh

I want you to see the sun coming up over the pyramids
I wanna give you everything that you've ever wanted
Oh, but I just need, I just need more time, oh

The silver hair and golden years
That seem so far until they're near
There's so much left to do down here, I know

All anyone wants is just
More time, more life, more healing
More love, more us, more feeling, yeah
Oh, I just need, I'm just needing
More you, more nights for dreaming
These days go by so fast and I
Oh, I just need, I'm just needing more
Oh yeah

(More) oh, I just need, I'm just needing
(More) oh, I just need, I'm just needing
(More) yeah, I just need, I'm just needing more
Oh yeah, yeah
(More) oh, I just need, I'm just needing
(More) oh, I just need, I'm just needing
(More) yeah, I just need, I'm just needing more (oh yeah)

There's not enough time in one life
For you and I, there's not enough time
Whoa, there's not enough time in one life (oh there's not enough)
For you and I, there's not enough time (no there's not enough)
Oh yeah, yeah
