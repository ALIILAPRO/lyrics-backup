		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please excuse me but I got to ask
Are you only being nice
Because you want something? 
My fairytale arrow pierces
Be careful how you respond
Because you'd not end up in this song
I never gave you an encouragement
And it's doing me in
Doing me in
Doing me in
Doing me in
Doing me in

The more you try to erase me
The more, the more
The more that I appear
The more, the more
The more you try the eraser
The more, the more
The more that you appear

You know the answer so why do you ask? 
I am only being nice
Because I want someone, something
You're like a kitten with a ball of yarn
And it is doing me in
Doing me in
Doing me in
Doing me in
Doing me in

The more you try to erase me
The more, the more
The more that I appear
The more, the more
The more I try to erase you
The more, the more
The more that you appear 

No, you're wrong, you're wrong 
You're wrong, you're wrong
You're wrong, you're wrong
You're wrong
