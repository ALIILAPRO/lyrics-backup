		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mama been laid off
Papa been laid off
My brother's been laid off
For more than two years now
Ooh can't get a job
Billy can't get a job
Ooh they gotta listen to the blues

Help them to strive
Help them to move on
Help them to have some future
Help them to live long
Help them to live life
Help them to smile
Don't let them stay home and listen to the blues

Papa been laid off
Mama been laid off
Billy can't get a job
For too long, too long
Don't let them lose
We gotta give them a chance
It's gonna come back on everyone
If you don't make them dance
Don't let them stay home, and listen to the blues

There's nothing sacred (why, why, why)
Breathing hatred
We have to face it (why, why, why)
No one can take it
And feel no pain

Mama been laid off
Papa been laid off
My brother's been laid off
For more than two years now
Ooh can't get a job
Billy can't get a job
Ooh they gotta listen to the blues

Help them to strive
Help them to move on
Help them to have some future
Help them to live long
Help them to live life
Help them to smile
Don't let them stay home and listen to the blues

One day we're gonna wake up
And the ghetto's all around
All over my friend
Have you ever seen a man break down

Do you know how that feels
To walk the street with your head held high
Why, why, why
Oh Lord have mercy
Did you ever see a man break down

There's nothing sacred
Breathing hatred
We have to face it
No one can take it
And feel no pain

Oh, did you ever see a man break down
