		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Check, check)

Unending, desolate
It lurks in the nothingness
In the dark I whisper
Knowing that it listens
And from the void it speaks

"Run and don't look back"
"Run and don't look back"

Stay close to the fire
Steady your breath and aim
Ready your warpaint
Just keep your eyes open
And try to stay awake
Ready your warpaint

Go
(Ready your warpaint)

Starve the revenant
Scorched Earth to cover up the tracks
In the dark I scream
Knowing that it hears me
"I am not afraid"
"Come and look me in my fucking face, liar"

Stay close to the fire
Steady your breath and aim
Ready your warpaint
Just keep your eyes open
And try to stay awake
Ready your warpaint
(Ready your warpaint)
(Ready your warpaint)
(Ready your warpaint)
(Ready your warpaint)

I refuse to snuff my light
I refuse to run and hide
I won't let it drag me off into the night
No, not without a fight
Not without a fight
Not without a fight
Ready your warpaint

Ready your warpaint
