		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you hit my line, I'm just gon' decline
Baby guess that you a waste of time
I'm just tryna shine
Baby, all you ever do is lie
I ain't down for lies
Baby, any time you tell the truth
I feel so surprised
Baby, yeah

If you hit my line, I'm just gon' decline
Baby, guess that you a waste of time
I'm just tryna shine
Baby, all you ever do is lie
I ain't down for lies
Baby, any time you tell the truth
I feel so surprised
Baby, yeah

I feel so surprised
All you ever do is lie
You been running on my mind
Yeah our memories rewind

Baby why you gotta lie?
Yeah you never tell the truth
And I see you tryna hide
That's the only thing you do (yeah)
You never face the consequences for your actions
You thought I'd let it slide 'cause you're so attractive
Girl I got a lot of dimes and a lot of practice
I ain't dealing with no lies 
I don't fuck with that shit

If you thought that you could play me 
Let me tell you that you're wrong
How you play a player?
You could never play a boss
I ain't fallen for your games 
I ain't tryna get involved
If you thought that you could play me
That's the dumbest thing you thought, yeah

If you hit my line, I'm just gon' decline
Baby guess that you a waste of time
I'm just tryna shine
Baby, all you ever do is lie
I ain't down for lies
Baby, any time you tell the truth
I feel so surprised
Baby, yeah

If you hit my line, I'm just gon' decline
Baby, guess that you a waste of time
I'm just tryna shine
Baby, all you ever do is lie
I ain't down for lies
Baby, any time you tell the truth
I feel so surprised
Baby, yeah

Yeah you tried to play me 
You was thinking I'ma fool
Wanted you to win 
But you still wanted me lose
I don't understand 
Why you gotta be so rude
Now I understand why you was feelin' blue
I can't believe you 
Even when your telling me the truth
All you do is lie 
Girl that's what you do
I told you just be honest
And that's my only rule
I cannot believe you 
'Cause I know the way you move

If you thought that you could play me 
Let me tell you that you're wrong
How you play a player?
You could never play a boss
I ain't fallen for your games 
I ain't tryna get involved
If you thought that you could play me
That's the dumbest thing you thought

If you hit my line, I'm just gon' decline
Baby guess that you a waste of time
I'm just tryna shine
Baby, all you ever do is lie
I ain't down for lies
Baby, any time you tell the truth
I feel so surprised
Baby, yeah

If you hit my line, I'm just gon' decline
Baby, guess that you a waste of time
I'm just tryna shine
Baby, all you ever do is lie
I ain't down for lies
Baby, any time you tell the truth
I feel so surprised
Baby, yeah

(I feel so surprised)
(I feel so surprised)
(All you ever do is lie)
(Baby why you lie?)
(All you ever do is lie, baby)
(Why you gotta lie?)
