		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I grab my chain, that bitch go ding-a-ling
She wanna grab my ding-a-ling
Look at that bitch, it bling-bling
High as hell, I cannot see
YSL, Lil Keed
R.I.P, Lil Keed
Shades on, Lil Keed
Diamonds on, Lil Keed

She wanna look for me
I put her on her knees, oh
I had to quit the lean
You can't get high as me, oh
Pull up in a AMG, made they ass clear the street, oh
I ain't mean to get green, that's why they mad at me, oh
You know I be so mean, so
Evisu, Evisu, Evisu, ho
My VV's in water like Nemo
In a coupe, I do not freeload
I crack his head then reload
On vacay', we up in Rio (Rio)
I sing my song like Ne-Yo (Ne-Yo)
Too much money on me, I think I got cheat codes (cheat codes)

When I grab my chain, that bitch go ding-a-ling
She wanna grab my ding-a-ling
Look at that bitch, it bling-bling
High as hell, I cannot see
YSL, Lil Keed
R.I.P, Lil Keed
Shades on, Lil Keed
Diamonds on, Lil Keed
When I grab my chain, that bitch go, "Ding-a-ling"
She wanna grab my ding-a-ling
Look at that bitch, it bling-bling
High as hell, I cannot see
YSL, Lil Keed
R.I.P, Lil Keed
Shades on, Lil Keed
Diamonds on, Lil Keed
