		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  September 9, 2001
Gary and I were skating at a hospital 
On top of a huge hill overlooking a valley
An ambulance came in and took out a dead woman 
Gary asked me why she wasn't moving or blinking 
They hadn't closed her eyes yet

She must have died on the way 
A car full of family and friends came in with the ambulance
They were all crying and hugging each other 
One woman screamed hysterically 
And grabbed at the woman's body asking her to wake up

I had to tell Gary that her soul went to Heaven 
I didn't believe a word of it
But I knew it'd be easier for him to understand
Two days from now, at 9 AM
Two planes will hit the World Trade Center
Killing over 3,000 people
I will tell Gary that there is no God
And all of this is meaningless
But today, there is a God, and he has a plan for him

He doesn't know it, but a year from now, our family will be torn apart 
And I will move far away and won't see or talk to him for five years
And as we sit on the hood of our car
The sun goes down and he asks me what I want out of my life
I tell him I don't know

On and on we run away
From the things we are afraid of
On and on we run away
From the things we are afraid of
On and on we run away
From the things we are afraid

I don't tell him about the dream I had the night before
Where I'm riding in a car full of strangers 
And singing to some song I've never heard 
And smoking a cigarette and we swerve off the road and hit a tree
I go through the windshield and hit the edge of a fence
Dislocating my jaw and flipping me into a wall
Where my neck is broken, and my skull is fractured
I bleed to death in excruciating pain

I will have this dream periodically 
Until I meet all of the strangers one by one 
Introducing them all to each other 
Until we are a close group of friends 
I will set these events in motion, and I will die

But today in the warm light of the sunset, I don't see it 
I just see the sunset
I smile back and shake my head
I have absolutely no idea
I am afraid
