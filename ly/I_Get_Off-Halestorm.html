		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't know that I know,
You watch me every night
And I just can't resist the urge
To stand here in the light
You're greedy eyes upon me
And then I come undone
And I could close the curtains
But this too much fun

I get off on you
Getting off on me
I give you what you want
But nothing is for free
It's a give and take
Kinda life we make
When your line is crossed
I get off
I get off

So much left unspoken
Between the two of us
It's so much more exciting
To look when you can touch
You could say I am different
And maybe I'm a freak
But I know how to twist ya
To bring you to your knees

I get off on you
Getting off on me
I give you what you want
But nothing is for free
It's a give and take
Kinda life we make
When your line is crossed
I get off
I get off

But you don't know
But you can't see
It's what you forgive
Out here for me

I get off on you
Getting off on me
I give you what you want
Yeah

I get off on you
Getting off on me
I give you what you want
But nothing is for free
It's a give and take
Kinda life we make
When your line is crossed
I get off
I get off

Yea, I get off
Yea, I get off
I get off
