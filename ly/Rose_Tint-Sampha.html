		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We should do this more often
Dancing and laughter
More fuel for the camera
Everybody gather 'round 
(Everybody, everybody, everybody)
Gonna this picture now
(Gonna take this, gonna take this, gonna take this)
Everybody speakin' loud
(Everybody, everybody, everybody)
Everybody in one house

Circuit gremlins, will have me fade to ghost
Inclination compass, I found this stretch of coast
Golden waters, twilight zone
I needed nature, I needed scope 
Enduring present pains (enduring present pains)
In aid of future hopes
Climbin' mountains high, slidin' down the slopes
My heart glows like TV (my heart)
I'm needy, don't you know?
But the fam beside me is what I needed most

It's been a lifetime (since we seen you)
It's been a lifetime (know you're busy)
It's been a lifetime (you've been hiding)
It's been a lifetime (tried to call you)
It's been a lifetime (could you call back)
It's been a lifetime (when you have time?)
It's been a lifetime (when you have time)
It's been a lifetime (when you have time)

Lost in my own world
Preoccupied with my own hurt
Lost the art of connection
Smilin' in (smilin' in) 
The face of (the face of)
The adversities (the adversity) 
That we take on (that we take on)
My fuel for (my fuel for)
The camera (the camera)

Everybody gather 'round
(Everybody, everybody, everybody)
Gonna take this picture now
(Gonna take this, gonna take this, gonna take this)
Everybody speakin' loud
(Everybody, everybody, everybody)
Everybody in one house
