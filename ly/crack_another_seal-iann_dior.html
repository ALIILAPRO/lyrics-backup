		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, I think I'ma crack another seal, count another bill
Everybody fake, I can't tell who real
Rich like every day, damn, I need to chill
I fuck up a hunnid bands, then make back a mil'

Ayy, I think I'ma crack another seal, count another bill
Everybody fake, I can't tell who real
Rich like every day, damn, I need to chill
I fuck up a hunnid bands, then make back a mil'
It's a reason, shawty even know who I am
I been rollin' loud with the gang, we ain't leaving
You know that I got it like that
We don't, we don't, know you 'round here

We don't, we don't, know you 'round here
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Rockstar, heavy metal
And I'm high as fuck, come get on my level
Spending day with my girl, she know I love her
Yeah, without her, prolly be rotting in hell
Bad bitch, make her throw it back then I never call
Throw it all, racks up in the air, watch the money fall
She say that she want a star player, I know how to ball
Niggas hate, no, I do not care, long as my money long
Niggas hate, but it's all good if I don't get involved
I know niggas hate, but it's all good 'cause it's all talk
I'ma watch 'em all fall

Ayy, I think I'ma crack another seal, count another bill
Everybody fake, I can't tell who real
Rich like every day, damn, I need to chill
I fuck up a hunnid bands, then make back a mil'
It's a reason, shawty even know who I am
I been rollin' loud with the gang, we ain't leaving
You know that I got it like that
We don't, we don't, know you 'round here
