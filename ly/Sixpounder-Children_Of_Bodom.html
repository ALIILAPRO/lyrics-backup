		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you say what you can't do
In darkness of the eyes
The wrecking voice stain mirror
Awaiting the first sixpounder

I'm gonna show you battle
That's how the pain really is
A little piss to free you down
Like a spark resist you
Pounder!

War!
I refuse to be brought down by you
Praise is far away from what you do
Not only are you cranking up my brain
I'm meant to blow you away...666 (...pounder)

Hey, what you said, that darkest time
I try to live all right
Little bits away for you
That you try to persuade me by

Louder sixpounder!

Can you say what you can't do?
In darkness of the eyes
A little piss, to free you down
Like a spark resist you
Pounder!

War!
War!
I refuse to be brought down by you
Praise is far away from what you do
Not only are you cranking up my brain
I'm meant to blow you away...666
