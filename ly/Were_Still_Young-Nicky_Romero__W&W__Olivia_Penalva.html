		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You and me, we have our demons
We both have our reasons
Maybe we should leave them
Why don't we just go
Grab our bags and put the key in
Start up our dreaming
We don't need permission
Let's just hit the road

It's okay if we get lost driving nowhere in the dark
Find our way under the stars
Got a ticket in my head
Living life without a plan 'til we find tomorrowland

We're still young, wild, and free
We make our own rules, so just let us be
Let's be dumb, get things wrong
We won't say sorry when tomorrow comes
Can't find yourself without the waves
Just gotta ride 'em, take 'em day by day
We don't take shit from anyone
'Cause we ain't done
We're still young

We're still young
We're still young

We could fly out to Ibiza
Dance until our feet hurt
Make it our own secret
No one has to know
We could throw a party
Pass out on Bacardi
We don't need nobody
To tell us where to go

Light a fire in the dark, you and I can be the spark
Find our way under the stars
Raise a red cup in your hand
Living life without a plan 'til we find our wonderland

We're still young, wild, and free
We make our own rules, so just let us be
We're still young, let's get dumn
We'll face tomorrow when the morning comes
Can't find yourself without the waves
Just gotta ride 'em, take 'em day by day
We don't take shit from anyone
'Cause we ain't done
We're still young

We're still young
We're still young
