		  Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
All my favorite conversations
Always made in the A.M.
Yeah, yeah

Feels like this could be forever tonight
Break these clocks, forget about time
There could be a World War Three goin' on outside
You and me were raised in the same part of town
Got these scars on the same ground
Remember how we used to kick around just wastin' time?

Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
All my favorite conversations
Always made in the A.M.
'Cause we don't know what we're sayin'
We're just swimmin' 'round in our glasses
And talkin' out of our asses
Like we're all gonna make it
Yeah, yeah

Feels like this could be forever right now
Don't wanna sleep 'cause we're dreamin' out loud
Tryin' to behave but you know that we never learn how
You and me were raised in the same part of town
Got these scars on the same ground
Remember how we used to kick around just wastin' time?

Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
All my favorite conversations
Always made in the A.M.
'Cause we don't know what we're sayin'
We're just swimmin' 'round in our glasses
And talkin' out of our asses
Like we're all gonna make it
Yeah, yeah

Ooh
You know I'm always comin' back to this place
Ooh
You know
And I'll say
Ooh
You know I'm always gonna look for your face
Ooh
You know

Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
All my favorite conversations
Always made in the A.M.
'Cause we don't know what we're sayin'
We're just swimmin' 'round in our glasses
And talkin' out of our asses
Like we're all gonna make it
Yeah, yeah

Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
You know I'm always comin' back to this place
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.? Yeah, yeah
You know
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
You know I'm always gonna look for your face
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
Yeah, yeah
