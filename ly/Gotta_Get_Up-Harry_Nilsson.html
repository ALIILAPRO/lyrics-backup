		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gotta get up, gotta get out
Gotta get home before the mornin' comes
What if I'm late, got a big day
Gotta get home before the sun comes up

Up and away, got a big day
Sorry, can't stay, I gotta run, run, yeah
Gotta get home, pick up the phone
Gotta let the people know I'm gonna be late

There was a time when we could dance until a quarter to ten
We never thought it would end then
We never thought it would end
We used to carry on and drink and do the rock and roll
We never thought we'd get older
We never thought it'd grow cold, but now

Gotta get up, gotta get out
Gotta get home before the mornin' comes
What if I'm late? Got a big day
Gotta get home before the sun comes up
Up and away, got a big day
Sorry can't stay, I gotta run, run, yeah
Gotta get home, pick up the phone
Gotta let the people know I'm gonna be late

Down by the sea, she knew a sailor who had been to war
She never even knew a sailor before
She never even knew his name
He'd come to town and he would pound her for a couple of days
And then he'd sail across the bubbling waves
And those were happier days, but now

Gotta get up, gotta get out
Gotta get home before the mornin' comes
What if I'm late? Got a big day
Gotta get home before the sun comes up
Up and away, got a big day
Sorry can't stay, I gotta run, run yeah
Gotta get home, pick up the phone
Gotta let the people know I'm gonna be late
