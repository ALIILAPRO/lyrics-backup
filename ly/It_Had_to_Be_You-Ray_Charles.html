		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey everybody,
Let's have fun
You only live for once
And when you're dead you're done

You beta let the good time roll baby,
Woah, let's get it on mama
And I don't care if you're old now,
Get yourself together, let the good times roll

Don't sit there mumbling
Talkin' trash
If you want to have a ball,
You got to go out and spend some cash

And let the good times roll baby,
Woah baby, Oh baby
And I don't care if you're old now,
Get yourself together, let the good times roll

Hey y'all tell everybody, Ray Charles in town,
Got a dollar and a quarter and I'm just riding the cloud,
Don't let no body, play me cheap,
I got fifty cents more than I'm gonna keep.

I'm goin' let the good times roll,
Woah baby, Oh baby
And I don't care if you're old, 
Get yourself together, let the good times roll

Hey no matter whether, rainy weather,
If you want to have a ball, you got to get yourself together,
Oh, get yourself under control, woah,
