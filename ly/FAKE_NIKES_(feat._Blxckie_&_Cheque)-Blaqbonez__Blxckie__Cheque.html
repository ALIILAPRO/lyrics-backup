		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You don't know what love is)
(If you don't put up a fight)
(And you don't know what love is) and we're back
With more messages from
(If you don't put up a fight) the Young Preacher

Young nigga, I still fake Nikes
If you gat a problem pull up and fight me
'Cause if I go broke buying real Nikes
Half of y'all niggas gon' still spite me
Young nigga, I still fake Nikes
If you gat a problem pull up and fight me
'Cause if I go broke buying real Nikes
Half of y'all niggas gon' still spite me

What I really blame is the currency
Heard it's like two mil' for a white tee
I ain't buying that shit for the hype G
What the fuck niggas telling me I'm that rich
I'd rather put that two mil' in a safe please
Rather put that two mil' into crypto
At least ama know where that shit go
Name brand don't guarantee drip though
Half y'all look stupid in Gucci
I look hard as fuck, bruh, I'm Gucci
I just buy what I want no pressure
I just pull up and I leave no impression
Wait, go broke for a twitter impression
Show me one of the niggas I'm impressing
Is it you? Is it you? Is it you?
Is it that lame nigga that can't dress shit?
Let him talk when I'm in a GLE
And his shawty wanna put that thing on me
'Cause I got a big Benz and a big crib
I don't pay rent and that shit ain't even lease
Let him talk when my mum pushing a V6
Car too fast to not pass the speed limit 
When I tick all the boxes
I'd worry 'bout nigga talking about my Nikes for now

Young nigga, I still fake Nikes (Nikes)
If you gat a problem pull up and fight me (fight me)
'Cause if I go broke buying real Nikes (Nikes)
Half of y'all niggas gon' still spite me (spite me)
Young nigga, I still fake Nikes (Nikes)
If you gat a problem pull up and fight me (fight me)
'Cause if I go broke buying real Nikes (Nikes)
Half of y'all niggas gon' still spite me (spite me)

Mm, yeah, yeah, yeah, ay
Pull up and flex on the mall
I go to the mall, I get what I want
You niggas facetime the 'Gram
I Facetime my mom, she got what she want
Ay, got it out from the mud
I know that shit ain't easy
Mama called, she said that she ain't see me
Told her, "Damn, you should put on the TV," ay
Feel like I got my cooler vibe
My bro got me a Gucci bag
I ain't trippin', I'm cool with that
Busy stackin' the benzis and racks
I ran up to the friend from the back
The city got me, got it all on my back (ay)
Diamonds, Azul dey change like that
Can't really vibe, it's just you and myself in the Riley
Call me when you're up, call me when you're down
I'll always stay up, I'll always be down for you
And I let you know I want you, da-da-da, oh-oh 
(Let me put some hot sauce on that there real quick)

I still rock fake Nikes (Nikes)
If you got a problem, pull up and fight me (fight me)
'Cause if I go broke buyin' real Nikes (Nikes)
Half of y'all niggas gon' still spite me (spite me)
Young nigga, I still rock fake Nikes (Nikes)
If you got a problem, pull up and fight me (fight me)
'Cause if I go broke buyin' real Nikes (Nikes)
Half of y'all niggas gon' still spite me (they spite me)

Flatter day but I never go broke
Never see me, they call me the ghost
Baddest bitch askin' me to be loyal
Why you buy it when you can't afford it?
Oh, don't stress me on no Fashion Nova
If you broke, they gon' leave you, way goin' now
You got power, oh, now you wan ghost me, huh?
I'm just tellin' you niggas ain't worth all of that
What, she yellin' at my Tuxo
Telling him, "How far?"
Hennessy XO
