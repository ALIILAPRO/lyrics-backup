Say baby, no, no, no, no, no
You know my loving ain't free, babe
Won't make you do what you don't wanna do
What you don't wanna do, no that ain't me, babe
Said, baby, nah nah nah, I ain't with the drama that ain't what I need
I need your ten heart now I need your ten toes down, baby

Said if you ride, baby, ride up
Pull up from behind, baby, wine up
And you and me, we can shine up
So, baby, come make your mind up
Said if you ride, baby, ride up
Pull up from behind, baby, wine up
And you and me, we can shine up
So, baby, come make your mind up

Baby, babe, I need you to skrt on me, babe
Drop down, look suh you know I need to know
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe
But if you with it, wine up on me
'Cause the hips don't lie, baby
Drop down, look suh you know I need to know
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe

Said, baby, I-I-I got so used to it being on a creep, babe
Yeah maybe I-I-I got so used to just giving you the least babe
But nowadays, I need more from ya
I need something I can keep
Said nowadays, I need real, I need you to take the lead

Said if you ride, baby, ride up
Pull up from behind, baby, wine up
And you and me, we can shine up
So, baby, come make your mind up
Said if you ride, baby, ride up
Pull up from behind, baby, wine up
And you and me, we can shine up
So, baby, come make your mind up

Baby, babe, I need you to skrt on me, babe
Drop down, look suh you know I need to know
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe
But if you with it, wine up on me
'Cause the hips don't lie, baby
Drop down, look suh you know I need to know
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe

Hey y'all bring in the blunt, Emily Blunt
Platinum back, ice bling in the front
I'mma lay in the junt, Yao Ming in the dunk
And I'm playing the field, Brad Wing in the punt
I'mma tell him I love him in a foreign and cuff him
Whips and immigration, everything on him, it's custom
Now they calling me Billy, I'm the goat no Achilles heels since I left Philly
Countin' them millies to babies
Beep beep beep beep, put the hurt on me
Yeah, I'm wearing jeans, but he put the skirt on me
Rode him to sleep, then I put his shirt on me
Pussy clean, these niggas ain't got no dirt on me
Gotta play it by my rules, so I swerve on him
Got my cash money, you can ask Bird or Slim
Took him to my Paradise, so ribbon my linen
Now we got a big thing for Caribbean women

Baby, babe, I need you to skrt on me, babe
Drop down, look suh you know I need to know
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe
But if you with it, wine up on me
'Cause the hips don't lie, baby
Drop down, look suh you know I need to know
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe
Baby, babe, I need you to skrt on me, babe
Drop down, look suh you know I need to know
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe
But if you with it, wine up on me
'Cause the hips don't lie, baby
Drop down, look suh you know I need to know
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe
