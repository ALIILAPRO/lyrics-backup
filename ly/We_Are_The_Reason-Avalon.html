		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As little children we would dream of Christmas morn
Of all the gifts and toys we knew we'd find
But we never realized a baby born one blessed night
Gave us the greatest gift of our lives

We were the reason that He gave His life
We were the reason that He suffered and died
To a world that was lost, He gave all He could give
To show us the reason to live

As the years went by we learned more about gifts
The giving of ourselves and what that means
On a dark and cloudy day, a man hung crying in the rain
All because of love, all because of love

Oh and we were the reason that He gave His life
We were the reason that He suffered and died
To a world that was lost, He gave all He could give
To show us the reason to live

I've finally found the reason for living
It's in giving every part of my heart to Him
In all that I do, every word that I say
I'll be giving my all just for Him, for Him

And we are the reason that He gave His life
We are the reason that He suffered and died
To a world that was lost, He gave all He could give
To show us the reason to live
He is our reason to live

Don't You know that you are the reason
That He came oh, He came to save us
When He gave His life for us, He suffered and died

To a world that was lost He gave
Everything that He had He gave (everything)
To show us the reason to live

Don't you know that you are the reason
That He came oh He came to save us (He gave his life)
When He gave His life for us, He suffered and died 

(I want to know how I can thank you Jesus) to a world that was lost He gave
Everything that He had He gave
To show us the reason to live

Don't you know that you are the reason
That He came oh He came to save us (He gave his life)
When He gave His life for us, He suffered and died

For a world that was lost He gave
Everything that He had He gave
To show us the reason to live
