		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't care
Where I go
When I die
I'm still alive
Oh, I've seen you this way before
Nothing ever changes

I want satisfaction
I want satisfaction
And I lover as my longest day
It's a sick attraction
It's a sick attraction
And I'm never gonna end it now
It's too late to leave and baby
I'm too dead to love you
Too dead to love you, dandelion
Too dead to love you, dandelion

No forbidden pleasure
I come unhinged
And play before your pale eyes
And suck you in
To make me feel everything
And I know the door will close at night

Too dead to love you
Too dead to love you
Too dead to love you, dandelion
Too dead to love you, dandelion
Too dead to love you, dandelion
