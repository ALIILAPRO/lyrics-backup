		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is all hands on deck
Calling out to lost boys and girls
I'm gettin' tired of the disrespect
We won't stop 'til we rule the world
It's our time, we up next (next, next)
Our sail's about to be set (set, set)
They ain't seen nothing yet
Tell 'em who's in charge so they don't forget

What's my name, what's my name? (Uma)
Say it louder
What's my name, what's my name? (Uma)
Feel the power
No one's gonna stop us soon the world will be ours
What's my name, what's my name?
What's it, what's it, say it, say it loud
(Uma, Uma)

All eyes on me, let me see 'em (Uma, Uma)
What's it, what's it, say it, say it 
(Uma, ah ah)

(Uma, Uma, la la Um-)
(Uma, Uma, la la Uma)
(Uma, Uma, la la Um-)
(Uma, Uma, la la Um-)
Uma

I'm the queen of this town 
I call the shots, you know who I am
I don't need to wear no fake crown
Stand up to me, you don't stand a chance
It's our time, we up next (next, next)
My crew's as real as it gets (gets, gets)
The worst is now the best
And leaving us here will be their last regret

What's my name, what's my name? (Uma)
Say it louder
What's my name, what's my name? (Uma)
Feel the power (whoa)
No one's gonna stop us soon the world will be ours (yeah)
What's my name, what's my name?
What's it, what's it, say it, say it 

You know what they say bad girls have all the fun
Never learned how to count 'cause I'm number one
Ready here, we come, we always get our way
It's a pirate's life, every single day (hey)
She's the captain, I'm the first mate
Enemies seasick, can't see straight
Call 'em fish bait, throw 'em on a hook
Uma's so hot they get burned if they look (ah)

It's all eyes on me, let me see 'em
I see your eyes on me boys, hey
You know what my name is
Say it, say it louder

Hook me (ha, ha)
Ho, whoa
Come on

What's my name, what's my name? (Uma)
Say it louder (hey)
What's my name, what's my name? (Uma)
Feel the power (ooh whoa-ooh)
No one's gonna stop us soon the world will be ours (no one's gonna stop us, no, no-no)
What's my name, what's my name?
What's it, what's it, say it, say it 
(Uma, Uma)

All eyes on me, let me see 'em (Uma)
What's it, what's it, say it, say it (Uma)
Ooh, say it louder (Uma, Uma)
Ooh, say it louder (Uma, Uma)
What's it, what's it, say it, say it 

(Uma, Uma, la la Um-)
(Uma, Uma, la la Uma)
(Uma, Uma, la la Um-)
(Uma, Uma, la la Uma)
Uma
