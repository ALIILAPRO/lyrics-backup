		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you're in love
Cah me have di MAC with di extension
And me have di money fi ya extensions
Cah me like your hair longer than my gun, ooh
Now we have di guns and girls, haffi keep di balance
And up in my world, we nuh sleep enuh, man?
Anytime it could go down, she won't hold out
She let it all out, pow-pow-pow, pow

My favorite girl had the French braids
I had a crush on her since back-a-day
She said her 'usna needs a bandage
After I come 'round and gave her the 12-gauge
You tried call my phone, but it was engaged
I was with my lil' mama, she was honey glazed
I've been crushin' on her since back then
Just the other day I gave her the MAC-10
I don't want just any girl, 'cause I'm a little choosy
But I swear I'm a sucker for a lil' cutie
I had a skin fade like Lil Boosie
And then I went and give lil' mama the lil' uzi
'Cause you got a body shape that I can't forget
The way I make you drip when I'm talkin' slick
I'm ashamed 'cause when I came, I was bustin' quick
That's why this time I came with the banana clip

I know you're in love
Cah me have di MAC with di extension
And me have di money fi ya extensions
Cah me like your hair longer than my gun, ooh
Now we have di guns and girls, haffi keep di balance
And up in my world, we nuh sleep enuh, man?
Anytime it could go down, she won't hold out
She let it all out, pow-pow-pow, pow

Only God can judge me, but my friend's a lifer
My life is too fast, so I can never wife her
I'm from the East Coast but she's a Westsider
I scoped her from far 'cause I'm the best sniper
Said she had the melons, so I go and get 'em
Spray with my AK-47
The way she keeps me guessin', she is a blessin'
But she only loves me for my 357
I think she was Bajan or maybe Trini
Every time I linked her, I had a nine mili'
I had to link a cougar with a Luger
But the next time, I bring out the big bazooka
It's the return of the mack, call it the sequel
I'm known as the Mack like Beanie Sigel
Before she got undressed, she was already see-through
Then she fell in love with my Desert Eagle

I know you're in love
Cah me have di MAC with di extension
And me have di money fi ya extensions
Cah me like your hair longer than my gun, ooh-ooh-ooh
Know we have di guns and girls, haffi keep di balance
And up in my world, we nuh sleep enuh, man
Anytime it could go down, she won't hold out
She let it all out, pow-pow-pow, pow-pow

She love me for my gunplay
From Monday to Monday (Monday to Sunday)
I keep a girl up on the runway
She love me for my gunplay
But if it wasn't for my gunplay
Then she really wouldn't love me
She love me for my gunplay
From Monday to Monday (Monday to Sunday)
I keep a girl up on the runway
She love me for my gunplay
But if it wasn't for my gunplay
Then she really wouldn't love me
