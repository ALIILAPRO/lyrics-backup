		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was idolizing you for so long
Just to be so fucking wrong
All these illusions play in my head
I don't know why I
Held you so high
Just to watch you turn away
All my life
I was led astray
You're just a human like the rest
Sub human at best
You're only flesh and blood
But we don't bleed the same
I would of killed to be you
But now you're dead to me
I'm over seeing you as a god
I don't know why I
Held you so high
Just to watch you turn away
All my life
I was led astray
I used to see you for so much more
A fall from grace, from heavens gates
To the depths of hell, glory to disgrace
How the mighty have fallen
From hero to zero
