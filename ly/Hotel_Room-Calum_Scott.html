		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's on your mind?
'Cause I've been thinking about last night
What's the time?

Feels like I've sat here all my life
Your ship rolls in, I'm here waiting
I don't know why, I'm paralysed
Oh what I'd do to be with you
Oh what I'd give

To hear you say that I love you
But say it the way I do
There's nowhere to run tonight
It's just you and I, in this hotel room
Say that I miss you, but say it the way I do
There's nowhere to hide tonight
My eyes can't lie, the way I feel for you
Just give me a moment, it's all I ask of you
While I'm dying in this hotel room

Couldn't work out, why you gave me all those signs
Tell me now, before I lose my mind

Your ship sails in, I ain't waiting
You stand close by, and watch me cry
Oh what I'd do to be with you
Oh what I'd give

To hear you say that I love you
But say it the way I do
There's nowhere to run tonight
It's just you and I, in this hotel room
And say that I miss you, but say it the way I do
There's nowhere to hide tonight
My eyes can't lie, the way I feel for you
Just give me a moment, it's all I ask of you
While I'm dying in this hotel room

Hold out your hand
Give me a light in the dark
You know that I'm broken
Don't leave me hear broken

To hear you say that I love you
But hear it the way I do
There's nowhere to run tonight
It's just you and I, in this hotel room
And say that I miss you, but say it the way I do
There's nowhere to hide tonight
My eyes can't lie, the way I feel for you
Just give me a moment, it's all I ask of you
Oh give me a moment, it's all I ask of you
While I'm dying in this hotel room
