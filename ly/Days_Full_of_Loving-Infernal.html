		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've had days full of loving
Days of hope, days with faith
Days where I was believing you'd be mine and you'd stay
I've had days where I'd miss you
I've had days of despair
But could I ever leave you? I don't know if I'd dare
I grow weak when you're near me
I go numb when you speak
I lose my breath when you're breathing
Right next to me

But my heart seems to tremble
Just a little too soon
When you're gone without calling
Through the night 'till it's noon

'Cause every night and every day
I'm wasting time when you're away
I wish I was stronger
But a life without you 
I cannot believe
I cannot believe in
And I don't know how to let go

So much hurt in my loving
So much pain everywhere
You said you'd learn but you didn't
Don't know why I still care

And I don't know how to leave you
How to really let you go
How to close the door behind you
How to hang on to a no

[CHORUS]

But I've had days full of loving
Maybe a few, but they are there
You give me days of believing
I guess that's why I'm here.
