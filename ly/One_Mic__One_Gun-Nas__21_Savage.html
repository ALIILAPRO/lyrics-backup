		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ain't no back and forth, ain't no left or right (21, 21)
I got King's Disease but I move like a knight (21, 21)
Rappers bandwagon tryna get some likes (21, 21)
I do it for the fam', never for the hype (21, 21)
When you turn to legend, no such thing as relevance (21, 21)
They must've forgot that I'm a new rapper that got integrity (21, 21)
All in the media and blogs, that's just a place I don't care to be (21, 21)
Most of these niggas wouldn't say shit if they was ahead of me (Hit-Boy)

No back and forth, I did it back then, I do it right now (woo)
I opened a lane for my era, I'm goated, they gave me the crown
G.O.A.T. with all the success, the negative press, I'm watchin' it pile (uh)
They sayin' that black music dyin', I'm sayin', "They wipin' us out"
But look at me now, damn, y'all, look at me now
Whatever I do is N.Y., I'm keepin' it Queens 'cause that's my side (what up?)
I shook up the town, I shook up the city, I shook up the state
I'm with 21 on my second run, this shit come with age

It's a conversation (woo), it's determination (yeah)
Your interpretation, I just shocked the nation (oh)
Did my tour with The Wu', I came back and I set the pace (whoa)
They just ran in one of my cribs and took what? I replaced it (haha)
Two Caucasians up out of their faces
Most of y'all assumed that they was black, it's exploitation (Black Caesar)
They ain't know that I see everything, invest in the Ring
It's cool to be mainstream, I'd rather be timeless
That's if we keepin' it P, 21 (21, 21)

I'm on that same trajectory
Bullet wounds and jail cells couldn't stop me, this my destiny
Never controversial, I'm mad the fans expected less from me
Nigga sneezed around me, wipe his nose, won't get no bless from me
Fuck the jewelry, I rather buy land and invest successfully
I got all type of stocks and bonds, Kehinde Wiley on my wall
And I'ma pass it to my son
If Savage like the capo that mean Escobar the don, one mic', one gun
My net worth like eight figures, I'm workin' on gettin' me nine
You know that I'm one of them niggas, I ain't doin' no cappin' or lyin'
You rappers be chasin' the hype, I do it and I don't be tryin'
I ain't goin' against no legend, nigga, I'm tryna be next in line
They actin' like I just popped, I was platinum before I signed
I went platinum without no features, I put platinum on your mind
This Glock I got two-tone, and this bitch don't bust no rhyme
They wanna see me fucked so they could deport me like I'm Shyne

No back and forth, I did it back then, I do it right now (woo)
They tellin' me that I'm the G-O-A-T, I been here for a while (while)
G.O.A.T., love me today, hate me tomorrow, no switchin' my style (style)
21, Yak, y'all get together, be big for the South (the globe)
But look at me now, damn, y'all, look at me now (uh)
Whatever I do is New York, you hear that shit all in my vowels (grrt)
I shook up the town, I shook up the city, I shook up the state
I'm one of them ones, on my second run, I'm on a new wave

Two kings
We're sendin' love to the whole culture
21, Esco, Mass Appeal, Slaughter Gang
This shit too easy, king
