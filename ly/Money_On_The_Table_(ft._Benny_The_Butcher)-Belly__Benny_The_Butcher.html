		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nearly half the record amount of cocaine seized last year 
Came in one operation which ended on the tenth of November
Eight hundred kilograms of cocaine were discovered 
And six people charged

I play to win, my old foes tryna make amends (who?)
Just 'cause we got the same enemies, that don't make us friends
Nothing's makin' sense, I'm watchin' angels sin
I'm seein' demons repent, for now I play the fence
When I got nothin' left to give, that's when they take offense
Life through these black shaded tints, Maybach Mercedes-Benz
They came and went like pretend friends in the latest trends (underdog)
Fuck an under card, I'm the main event, uh
My body covered in tattoos and battle scars
Made it through the dark, I guess the sky was out of stars
Late night so high
We don't say, "Hi", we say, "Safe flight"
My energy big, I feel like Frank White (uh)

Money on the table like the poker stars (wow)
I send your bitch to Vegas where they overcharge (bitch)
Uh, in the kitchen with the culinary (Griselda)
(Ah) I smoke so much I'm fuckin' up my pulmonary (what?)

I got two bitches one a ratchet and one my wife (my wife)
One I cock before bed, the other I kiss good night (good night)
I know that money made y'all soft (uh-uh), not us, we still hungry (still hungry)
Y'all make enough just to pay bills monthly and feel comfy (what?)
Any bitch I bought a bag for trust me she carried yay (facts)
I use to rarely play now every day it's Perrier
I stood on East ferry late, I was trappin' but barely ate
Now it's water in my jewelry case like Erie lake, yeah
You know it's money on the table like the poker stars (like the poker stars)
Nigga, and I can make you famous when the coke dissolve
It's hard to trust niggas, they only begin off loyal
So the best advice somebody can give you is get a lawyer, motherfucker

Too much stress, I was playin' chess with the Reaper
Million dollar man puttin' rappers in the sleeper
I mean this shit is crazy, they say I'm actin' different lately
Fools gold, I swear to God this shit fugazy
In the kitchen, chickens on me whippin' gravy
And life's a bitch, but, baby, that's the bitch that raised me
Life's a bitch, but, baby, that's the bitch that raised me
Life's a bitch, but, baby, that's the bitch that raised me
