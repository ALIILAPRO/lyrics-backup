		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I climb, hand over hand, closing my eyes
Too scared to look down 
I climb, hand over hand
Putting distance between I and I and the ground

I get to the top
I stand on the edge
I look to the sky, and say all my prayers

[Chorus]
What could be better than a swan dive into the asphalt
I don't know, nothing can be better than a swan dive into the asphalt

You should ask somebody, 'Cause I've got nothing to lose tonight
I misplaced my life tonight, chased all my friends away tonight
I don't say the right things
I don't look the right way
That's just not me
I listen to my music too loud, a watch too much damn TV

Tell me, who can control the flood?
No one
Where are the angels?
Nowhere

Where's the compassion?
Nowhere
Who knows the truth?
No one

Who will believe in me?
No one
Who will stand by me?
No one

Who will fly with me?
No one

I climb, hand over hand, closing my eyes
Too scared to look down 
I climb, hand over hand
Putting distance between I and I and the ground

I get to the top, stand on the edge, look to the sky
There's nothing left for me.
