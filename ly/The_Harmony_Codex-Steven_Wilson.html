		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It seems I'm miles above the surface of the earth
I can see across the whole of London and beyond
Lights from a thousand cities
Towering buildings in far off places
Ships and thunderstorms at sea and beyond
A trillion stars in a billion galaxies
I gaze out across the millennia 
It took the lights from these stars to reach the earth
I close my eyes
And breathe

I came here searching for something
I don't remember what that thing is anymore
Did I dream you?
Or are you dreaming me now?
As your waking thoughts gradually take over
As all dreams are ultimately forgotten
And lost
