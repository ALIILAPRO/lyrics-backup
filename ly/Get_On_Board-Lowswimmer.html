		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I felt bad for vanishing
But I kicked myself for griefing
I was just inanimate
Didn't know what was happening

Get on board now

If you had my back, then I was in
A middleman to reckon with
The blood thinners started kicking in
And I was where you live when you

Get on board now

I went there and back again
It bled me dry of innocence
If I stand by will you begin?
I'm on board now
