		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and fallin' out of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure

My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight day-to-day it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded, too

But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh, you love me, you love me
Why the hell d'you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself

Baby, the best part of me is you
Lately, everything's makin' sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you

I overthink and still forgive
I lose my phone and place my bets
And I never catch the train on time, always thirty minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet

But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah, yeah
He loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me how to love myself

'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you
Whoa, lately, everything's makin' sense, too
Baby, I'm so in love with you
With you

Baby, the best part of me is you
Whoa, lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you, oh
Baby, I'm so in love with you, yeah, yeah
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you
