		<p>
		  Yea
Enter Circles
Where I’m the best one there 
social got me underground 
Check how this train stare
I stay low 
Submarine ugh 
here there
Let’s make this shit clear 
Tourist in a Taurus
Different places
Proving this world 
It Ain’t for us
My skin color tell it all 
it’s not important 
Trynna chase a Fortune
Cleaning up distortion 
Watch me torch them
Trips to the bodega
Picking up a quarter water 
I made the trip
Daily
I was diggin 
Papi’s daughter 
In 5th grade
I got suspended 8 times
3 times in 2 weeks 
That should tell you
I ain’t  follow orders
I got a small shortage 
Don’t cross my borders 
Same my name 3 times 
And Im coming for ya
Yea
What I represent 
Never hesitant 
Henny and the funky scent
Leave me hella bent
It’s Supa 

Diesel haze when I bring the funk 
You get smoked yo
Yea yea yea 
You get smoked yo
Diesel Haze when I bring the ugh ugh

Wake up and get straight to it
I don’t even eat breakfast 
Thinking straight movements
Looking at myself 
Like you the truest
Yea Telling myself homie 
you can do it 

(Bridge Supa talking)

My stomach growles
From different hunger pains 
Yea it’s Peter gainst 
The world 
I Guest it’s  hunger games
I got my
Back against the wall
With myself to blame 
I Made the choice
Gotta live with it
Im chasing fame 
Gotta deal with others 
Always Trynna block the lane 
Good friends turn to depends
Conversations 
that I’m diving off The deep end
That’s a slim chance
As my circle slims
roll the funk up
As I never ugh

Diesel haze when I bring the funk 
You get smoked yo
Yea yea yea 
You get smoked yo
Diesel Haze when I bring the ugh ugh
When I...
