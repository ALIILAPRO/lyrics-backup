		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Face, ace, sake, place, base damn
I think I'm crazed
Terrors the error, no errors within my terror
Are you scared of six double
Six? Demonically elegant elements
A manic-depressive aggressiveness, stress me
Bitch and you will feel the strength
Of my weapons kit, trick
Face, ace, sake, place, base damn
I think I'm crazed
Terrors the error, no errors within my terror
Are you scared of six double
Six? Demonically elegant elements
A manic-depressive aggressiveness, stress me
Bitch and you will feel the strength
Of my weapons kit, trick

$carecrow rising, while devising
(My master plan to move in silence)
Live through violence
Blood flow drivin' me to
Kill a fuckboy hidin'
Manic schizo, life dejected
(Don't think I'm soft, 'cause I'm depressed
Bitch) just infected, just neglected
Always rejected, but respected
Lucifer's first-born of the fallen
Triple 6 screams, bodies calling
I've evolved into revolving my
Own way of problem-solving
Murder, murder, druggie, junky
Body burnin' if I'm lucky
Flames of hell that burn my flesh, $uicide
I scream 'till then

Face, ace, sake, place, base damn
I think I'm crazed
A manic-depressive aggressiveness, stress me
Bitch and you will feel the strength
Of my weapons kit, trick

Fuckboy wanna talk shit? Put the
MAC-10 in his mouth, just the tip
Zip up my brain, six
Hundred and sixty stitches, i feel the pain
No shame, just sayin' big bang, I'm a Saiyan
Who knew Yung Plague wouldn't freeze
In the tundra? It's true
Hot as a block, when the cops know the spot
Cop a rock and then crack in his top
Leave him blue now your skull got a big
Crater, see you later, alligator
Bring the bodies to the swamp
Leave 'em as bait for the chomp and I'm gone

Face, ace, sake, place, base damn
I think I'm crazed
