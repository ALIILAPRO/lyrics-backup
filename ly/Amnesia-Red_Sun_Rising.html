		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everyday is the same but I complain about it
But I'm alright
Blue to grey it's mundane 
But there's something strange about it
But I got the right
And I'm not sick like you
I'm not burdened by the truth

This is it
Your only one moment in time
Don't be afraid to ever love
Lest the roses it the stone

This is it
Your only one moment in time
Release your grip
Don't roll your eyes
Take a breath
Life should be touched not choked to death

Slide the X through the square 
So I won't forget about it
Tomorrow's come (Tomorrow's come)
Am I the only one that thinks 
The trouble with nothing is that it's fun

But I'm not sick as you
I'll never see the shit you do
I'm not burdened by the truth

This is it
Your only one moment in time
Don't be afraid to ever love
Lest the roses it the stone

This is it
Your only one moment in time
Release your grip
Don't roll your eyes
Take a breath
Life should be touched not choked to death

Time said I won't forget it
Time said it, so admit it
Time said I won't forget it
Won't forget it
Won't forget it
Won't forget it

This is it
Your only one moment in time
Don't be afraid to ever love
Lest the roses it the stone

This is it
Your only one moment in time
Release your grip
Don't roll your eyes
Take a breath
Life should be touched not choked to death
