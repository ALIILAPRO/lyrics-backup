		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

They come to see 
the fire burning In your heart
They want to witness
This love from the start

They hear you when you cry
This love is far and wide
When you smile the stars align
Flower of the universe
And child of mine

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

When you sleep softly the angels come
Like diamonds, like my love
They want to know it's true
There's someone in the world, lovely as you

They hear you when you cry
This love is far and wide
When you smile the stars align
Flower of the universe
And child of mine
