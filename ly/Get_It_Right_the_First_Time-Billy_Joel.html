		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't believe in first impressions
For just this once I hope that looks don't deceive
I ain't got time for true confessions
I've got to make the move right now
Got to meet that girl somehow
I've gotta get it right the first time
That's the main thing, oohh oohh
I can't afford to let it pass
You get it right the next time that's not the same thing, ooh ooh
Gonna have to make the first time last
La, la, la, la, la (Repeat)

I'm not much good at conversation
I was never to smooth at comin' on real strong
If all it takes is inspiration
Then I might have just what it takes
If I don't make no bad mistakes and I get it right the first time
That's the main thing
Can't afford to let it pass
You get it right the next time that's not the same thing
Have to make the first time last
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (Repeat)

I might find the courage, yeah
I might get up the nerve
But if my timing ain't just right
What purpose would it serve?
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know how to say those first few words
If I want to put myself in touch
The first few moments mean so much

So I suppose it's now or never
Before that woman walks right out of my life
Just let me pull myself together
I've got to give it one good try
Gotta take my chance tonight
I've gotta get it right the first time
That's the main thing
I can't afford to let it pass
You get it right the next time it's not the same thing
Gonna have to make the first time last
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (Repeat)
