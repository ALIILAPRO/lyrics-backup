		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why do you feel for me
You never cared much Why do I seem lonely
Will it ever be enough?

Well I tried to make you happy fix it all up I was tied around your finger, ya I
lingered
will it ever be enough

Why does it feel like the feelings gone
the hurt is still here all along Why does it feel like I'm in the wrong
will it ever be enough

I couldnt feel more helpless and insecure You could've laid it out for me
I'd have been so sure
Could you see me a new light
or would it wear off even if I change the tide Will it ever be enough

Why does it feel like the feelings gone
the hurt is still here all along Why does it feel like I'm in the wrong
will it ever be Enough
Why do I feel for you Why do I lose sleep Well I know theres a distance between us
I'm still shuffling my feet
and even on this venture
Tumble in the rough well I know for sure, deep down
It'll never be enough
