		  Go

Shawty, I'ma only tell you this once, you the illest
(Ba, ba-da, da, doh)
And for your lovin', I'ma Die Hard like Bruce Willis
(Ba, ba-da, da, doh)
You got spark, you, you got spunk
You, you got somethin' all the girls want
You're like a candy store and I'm a toddler
You got me wantin' more and m-m-more of

Your love, your love (yeah)
Your love, your love (yeah)
Your love, your love (yeah)
Your love, your love (yeah)
Your love, your love
Your love, your love
Your love, your love
Your love, your love (mm, uh, yo)

He the type to pop tags and be cockin' the brim
Might breeze through the Ave, might stop at the gym
And he keep a du rag, keep the wave on swim
W-W-Waves on swim so they hate on him
Anyway, I think I met him sometime before
In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree
'S' on my chest 'cause I'm ready to save him
Ready to get buck on anybody that plays him
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him
When he call me mama, lil' mama, I call him, baby

Shawty, I'ma only tell you this once, you the illest
(Ba, ba-da, da, doh)
And for your lovin', I'ma Die Hard like Bruce Willis
(Ba, ba-da, da, doh)
You got spark, you, you got spunk
You, you got somethin' all the girls want
You're like a candy store and I'm a toddler
You got me wantin' more and m-m-more of

Your love, your love (yeah)
Your love, your love (yeah)
Your love, your love (yeah)
Your love, your love (yeah)
Your love, your love
Your love, your love
Your love, your love
Your love (yeah), your love (yeah)

He the type to keep a couple hundred grand in the rubber band
Just left Money Gram in the lemon Lamb'
Hot damn, make me scream like Summer Jam
I mean that nigga must be from the motherland
Anyway, I think I met him in the sky
When I was a geisha, he was a samurai
Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly
'S' on my chest, lemme get my cape on
He's so thugged out, Ghostface and Raekwon
Convict, just like Akon
'Cause you know snitches be puttin' the jake on

Shawty, I'ma only tell you this once, you the illest
(Ba, ba-da, da, doh)
And for your lovin', I'ma Die Hard like Bruce Willis
(Ba, ba-da, da, doh)
You got spark, you, you got spunk
You, you got somethin' all the girls want
You're like a candy store and I'm a toddler
You got me wantin' more and m-m-more of

Your love, your love (yeah)
Your love, your love (yeah)
Your love, your love (yeah)
Your love, your love (yeah)
Your love, your love
Your love, your love
Your love, your love
Your love, your love

Find me in the dark
I'll be in the stars
Find me in your heart
I'm in need of your love
Your love, your love
Your love
Baby, you the illest
Your love
Your love
