		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's the time of the season
When the love runs high
In this time, give it to me easy
And let me try with pleasured hands

To take you and the sun
To Promised lands
To show you every one
It's the time of the season for loving

What's your name?
(What's your name?)
Who's your daddy?
(Who's your daddy? He rich?)
Is he rich like me?

Has he taken
(Has he taken)
Any time
(Any time to show)
To show you what you need to live?

Tell it to me slowly
Tell you what?
I really want to know
It's the time of the season for loving

What's your name?
(What's your name?)
Who's your daddy?
(Who's your daddy? He rich?)
Is he rich like me?

Has he taken
(Has he taken)
Any time
(Any time to show)
To show you what you need to live?

Tell it to me slowly
Tell you what?
I really want to know
It's the time of the season for loving

To show you what you need to live?
Tell it to me slowly
Tell you what?
I really want to know
It's the time of the season for loving
