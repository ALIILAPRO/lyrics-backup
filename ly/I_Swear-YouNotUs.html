		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (It's YouNotus)

You see, I want it
I got your body on my mind
In this moment all the time, oh no

I'm broken-hearted
I lay awake all through the night
Wishing you were by my side, oh no

I'm sick of all this heartache
I'm sick of all this pain
I'm sick of all this waiting and wasting away
So I'm going out now, I'm out of this place
Please don't annoy me until better days

I swear, I swear
I'm out of this
I'm gonna dance, dance you out of my head
I swear, I swear
I'm out of this
I'm gonna dance, dance you out of my head
I swear (I swear)
I'm out of this (I'm out of this)
I'm gonna dance, dance you out of my head
I swear, I swear (oh-oh)
I'm out of this (I'm out of this)
I'm gonna dance, dance you out of my head (out of my head, yeah)

It should be easy
I mean, I know just what to do
To forget all about you, oh-oh

Baby, believe me
After this moonlit night is through
I'll be over you for good, oh-oh

I'm sick of all this heartache
I'm sick of all this pain
I'm sick of all this waiting and wasting away
So I'm going out now, I'm out of this place
Please don't annoy me until better days

I swear, I swear
I'm out of this
I'm gonna dance, dance you out of my head
I swear, I swear
I'm out of this
I'm gonna dance, dance you out of my head
I swear I swear (swear)
I'm out of this (I'm out of this)
I'm gonna dance, dance you out of my head
I swear, I swear (oh-oh)
I'm out of this (I'm out of this)
I'm gonna dance, dance you out of my head (hey)
I swear, I swear
