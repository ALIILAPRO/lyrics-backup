		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where you gonna go when the rave's out?
Trapped in your mind in a haze now
Blowing up my phone on a comedown
Dark thoughts on your mind now the lights out
Where you gonna go when the rave's out? 
(Rave's out, rave's out, rave's out, rave's out)
(Rave's out, rave's out, rave's out)

Where you gonna go when the rave's out?
Trapped in your mind in a haze now
Blowing up my phone on a comedown
Dark thoughts on your mind now the lights out

Where you gonna go when the rave's out? (Rave's out)
Trapped in your mind in a haze now
Blowing up my phone on a comedown
Dark thoughts on your mind now the lights out

Where you gonna go when the rave's out?
Darling, on your own now
Who you gonna call?
Who you gonna call?
Who you gonna call?
Where you gonna go when the rave's out? (Rave's out)

Blowing up my phone on a comedown
Dark thoughts on your mind now the lights out
Where you gonna go when the rave's out?
(Rave's out, rave's out, rave's out)
(Rave's out, rave's out, rave's out)

Where you gonna go when the rave's out?
Trapped in your mind in a haze now
Blowing up my phone on a comedown
Dark thoughts on your mind now the lights out

Where you gonna go when the rave's out? (Rave's out)
Trapped in your mind in a haze now
Blowing up my phone on a comedown
Dark thoughts on your mind now the lights out

Where you gonna go when the rave's out?
Darling, on your own now
Who you gonna call?
Who you gonna call?
Who you gonna call?
Where you gonna go when the (rave's out?)
(Rave's out, rave's out, rave's out) 
(Rave's out, rave's out, rave's out, rave out)
