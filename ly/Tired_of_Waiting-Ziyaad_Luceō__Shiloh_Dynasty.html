		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me why I'm waiting for someone (someone)
That couldn't give a fuck about me 
Oh, oh you wouldn't
Tell me why I'm waiting for someone (someone)
That couldn't give a fuck about me 
Oh, oh you wouldn't
Tell me why I'm waiting for someone (someone)
That couldn't give a fuck about me (about me)
Oh, oh you wouldn't
Tell me why I'm waiting for someone (someone)
That couldn't give a fuck about me (about me)
Oh, oh you wouldn't
Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
Oh, oh you wouldn't
Tell me why I'm waiting for someone 
That couldn't give a fuck about me 
Oh, oh you wouldn't
Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
Oh, oh you wouldn't
