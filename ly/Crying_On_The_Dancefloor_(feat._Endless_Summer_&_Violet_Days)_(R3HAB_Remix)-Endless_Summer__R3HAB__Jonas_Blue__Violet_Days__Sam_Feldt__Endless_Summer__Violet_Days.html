		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tonight I won't be crying on the dancefloor
I ain't got no time for no more sad songs
So let's raise a glass to all the past ones
But I won't be crying on the dancefloor

Tonight I won't be crying on the dancefloor
I ain't got no time for no more sad songs
So let's raise a glass to all the past ones
But I won't be crying on the dancefloor

Tonight I won't be crying on the dancefloor
I ain't got no time for no more sad songs
So let's raise a glass to all the past ones
But I won't be crying on the dancefloor

You think I'm alone with tears in my bed
Reliving all of the things that you said
But now that you're gone, I'll be okay
I'm gonna drink all my sadness away

Tonight I won't be crying on the dancefloor
I ain't got no time for no more sad songs
So let's raise a glass to all the past ones
But I won't be crying on the dancefloor

Tonight I won't be crying on the dancefloor
I ain't got no time for no more sad songs
So let's raise a glass to all the past ones
But I won't be crying on the dancefloor

(Three, two, one, let's go)
