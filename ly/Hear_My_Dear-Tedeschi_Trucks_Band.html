		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As we watch the world go by
There's so much we search to find
Holding on to memories gone ablaze

Knowing there's so much more to say
The world keeps on turning
And spinning that's the way it goes

Hear, my dear, is your melody
So sorry it took so long
I was lost in the wilderness
And that's where I heard our song

All the times I made you cry
And the dreams we left behind
Let's make the future ours to hold
And I'll be there as we grow old

Believe in our song
I believed all along the way
The world keeps on turning and turning
'Round and 'round it goes

Hear, my dear, is your melody
So sorry it took so long
I was lost in the wilderness
And that's where I heard our song

Hear, my dear, is your melody
So sorry it took so long
I was lost in the wilderness
Oh, and that's where I heard our song

Hear, my dear, is your melody
I'm so sorry it took so long
I was lost in the wilderness
Oh, and that's where I heard our song

Hear, my dear, is your melody
So sorry it took so long
I was lost in the wilderness
And that's where I heard our song

Hear, my dear, is your melody
So sorry it took so long
I was lost in the wilderness
Ooh, that's where I heard our song
