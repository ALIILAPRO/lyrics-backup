		<p>
		  Yeah
Racks, yeah (ayy)
Racks, uh (ayy)
Racks, yeah (all I did was count all my racks, I ain't switch)
Racks, uh 
Racks, yeah (they tried to stab my back, so I had to go get back, back)
Racks, uh
Racks, yeah

All I did was count all my racks, I ain't switch
They tried to stab my back
So I had to go get back, that's what I did
Fuck my feelings, nigga, I just talk facts though I ain't shit
She need healing, I don't got time for a story, what is the gist?
Oh-oh, yeah, gist
She wanna fuck, so I did
You too much, so I dipped
This shit ain't none, my life too lit
Oh-oh, yeah, gist
She wanna fuck, so I did
You too much, so I dipped
This shit ain't none, my life too lit

When shit get dark, ayy, everything gon' get back, ayy
I got a call from my bro, he said, "You goin' off track"
I take it slow now, but I got no reason to slow down
Ridin' in foreigns like, "Autobots, roll out"
Now you a dub, should have never showed out
I see a new nigga stealin' swag
You and your new life kinda mad
Yeah, I'm that nigga that she wish she had
Still in my phone like, "Who that?"
Talkin' the breesh, yeah, I do that
They puttin' me on, how you knew that?
Nowadays, I been movin' too tact'
See shit, I don't say it, keep track, yeah
All these chops lookin' like a loadout
I'm off the gas, you could say I'm zoned out
Oh, you ain't know, you could say you know now
I got the control now, nobody gon' hold you down
I know we grown now, yeah, but everything goes around

All I did was count all my racks, I ain't switch
They tried to stab my back
So I had to go get back, that's what I did
Fuck my feelings, nigga, I just talk facts though I ain't shit
She need healing, I don't got time for a story, what is the gist?
Oh-oh, yeah, gist
She wanna fuck, so I did
You too much, so I dipped
This shit ain't none, my life too lit
Oh-oh, yeah, gist
She wanna fuck, so I did
You too much, so I dipped
This shit ain't none, my life too lit

Uh, uh (let's go)
Yeah, uh, uh
Yeah, uh, uh
Yeah, uh, uh
