		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What does that wispy little brat have
That you don't have double?
She can't hold a candle
To the beauty of your smile

How about a pulse?

Overrated by a mile
Overvalued, overblown
If he only knew
The you that we do

And that silly little creature
Isn't wearing his ring
And she doesn't play piano
Or dance, or sing
No she doesn't compare

But she still breaths air

Who cares?
Unimportant, overrated
Overblown, if only he could see
How special you can be
If he only knew the you that we do

If I touch a burning candle
I can feel no pain
If you cut me with a knife
It's still the same

And I know her heart is beating
And I know that I am dead
Yet the pain here that I feel
Try and tell me it's not real
And it seems I still have a tear to shed

The sole redeeming feature
From that little creature
Is that she's alive, overrated
Overblown, everybody knows
That's just a temporary state
Which is cured very quickly
When we meet our fate

Who cares?
Unimportant, overrated
Overblown, if only he could see
How special you can be
If he only knew the you that we do

If I touch a burning candle
I can feel no pain
In the ice or in the sun
It's all the same

Yet I feel my heart is aching
Thou it doesn't beat, it's breaking
And the pain here that I feel
Try and tell me it's not real
I know that I am dead
Yet it seems I still have
Some tears to shed
