		  Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on

Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on

In violent times
You shouldn't have to sell your soul
In black and white
They really really ought to know
Those one-track minds
That took you for a working boy
Kiss them goodbye
You shouldn't have to jump for joy
You shouldn't have to jump for joy

Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on

They gave you life
And in return you gave them hell
As cold as ice
I hope we live to tell the tale
I hope we live to tell the tale

Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on

Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on

Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on

And when you've taken down your guard
If I could change your mind
I'd really love to break your heart
I'd really love to break your heart

Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without (break your heart)
Come on (really love to break your heart)
I'm talking to you
Come on

Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
So come on

Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on

Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you (they really really ought to know)
Come on

Shout
Shout
Let it all out (I'd really love to break your heart)
These are the things I can do without
(I'd really love to break your heart)
Come on 
I'm talking to you
So come on

Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
