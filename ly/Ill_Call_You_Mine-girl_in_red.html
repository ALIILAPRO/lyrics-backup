		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sitting in the backseat
We're driving so fast
Hands out the window
We're not going back

Summer on a green hill
Laughing so loud
Taking my body
And you're taking it down

Break me down
And I'll call you mine
And I know I've been around
And I'll call you mine and I'll

Break me down
And I'll call you mine
And I know I've been around

Sitting in the backseat
We're driving so fast
Living in a daydream
It's too good to last

Rainy days and bad luck
Coming my way
I look for you when I am lost
So I don't go insane

Break me down
And I'll call you mine
And I know I've been around
And I'll call you mine, so I'll

Break me down
And I'll call you mine
And I know I've been around

Show me that you really care
That you're really here
Show me that you're gonna stay
On my worst days
Hold me like you'll never leave
Like you'll never leave
Like you'll never leave

Break me down
And I'll call you mine
And I know I've been around

Break me down
And I'll call you mine
And I know I've been around
And I'll call you mine and I'll

Break me down
And I'll call you mine
And I know I've been around
