		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You walked into the world
As a super human boy and girl (ooh)
In the blinking of your eyes
I was born and sold
By your manifesto

It's a cruel world for small things
But with lies and luxuries
In the in-between
You can be happy

You put me in a cage
In the daily maze of flesh and rage (ooh)
That I will follow every truth
I won't let you go
I want every tomorrow

It's a cruel world for small things
But with lies and luxuries
In the in-between
You can totally be happy

And now I am afraid
You will blossom soon
And grow and change
There is so much I can't take
But I will understand
I will open my hand

You can be happy
You can be happy
You can be happy
You can be happy (it's a cruel world for small things)
You can be happy (but with the lies and luxuries)
You can be happy (in the in-between)
You can be happy (you can be happy)

You can be happy 
You can be happy 
You can be happy 
You can be happy (ooh)

There's an open window
And I can go through
Into the life of others
There's nothing I can't do

There's an open window
And I can go through
Into the life of others
There's nothing I can't do (fight)

There's an open window (fight)
And if I can go through (fight)
Into the life of others (fight)
There's nothing I can't do (fight)

There's an open window (fight you can be happy)
And I can go through (fight you can be happy)
Into the life of others (fight you can be happy)
There's nothing I can't do (fight you can be happy)

(Fight) you can be happy
(Fight) you can be happy
(Fight) you can be happy
You can be happy (ooh)
