		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're too young for this road that we built to be crumblin'
If we run from this feelin', it's all been for nothin', been for nothin'

Not gonna lie to you, lie to you, lie to you
There's gonna be hard times under these dark skies
Not gonna lie to you, lie to you, lie to you
But if you're by my side, it's gonna be alright

I won't let you go even if the whole world's on fire, world's on fire
Promise I'ma stay with you through the flames, hold you tighter
Let 'em burn 'cause we'll burn brighter
Even if the world's on fire
Even if the world's on fire

Take my hand when they tell us that we should know better (we should know better)
They don't understand, when the smoke clears, we'll still be together, together

Not gonna lie to you, lie to you, lie to you
There's gonna be hard times under these dark skies
Not gonna lie to you, lie to you, lie to you
But if you're by my side, it's gonna be alright

I won't let you go even if the whole world's on fire, world's on fire
Promise I'ma stay with you through the flames, hold you tighter
Let 'em burn 'cause we'll burn brighter
Even if the world's on fire
Even if the world's on fire

Even if the world's on fire
