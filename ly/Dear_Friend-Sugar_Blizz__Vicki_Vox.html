		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My dear friend where have you been?
Where have you gone? What did you win?
Someone there? Are you listening?
Is it too late? My dear friend

We felt the sunshine we found the gold
We thought we'd be forever young
But now I know we can't keep floating
We have to fold
This is the beat of broken hearts
Is it all lost?

We can go on again
'Cause you seem like you want it bad
My head is spinning off the edgе
And I'm giving in way too fast, way too fast

My dear friend you know I'd give in
Been waiting so long to feel it
All of thеse years i've been listening
Are you also numb? Do you still pretend?

We felt the sunshine we found the gold
We thought we'd be forever young
But now I know we can't keep floating
We have to fold
This is the beat of broken hearts
Is it all lost?

We can go on again
'Cause you seem like you want it bad
My head is spinning off the edgе
And I'm giving in way too fast, way too fast

We can go on again
'Cause you seem like you want it bad
My head is spinning off the edge
And I'm giving in way too fast, way too fast

Caught up in the flashing lights
Keep sedating my mind
Leading me on, like it's whatever
We could go on but we should know better

We can go on again
'Cause you seem like you want it bad
My head is spinning off the edgе
And I'm giving in way too fast, way too fast

We can go on again
'Cause you seem like you want it bad
My head is spinning off the edge
And I'm giving in way too fast, way too fast

We can go on again
'Cause you seem like you want it bad
My head is spinning off the edge
And I'm giving in way too fast, way too fast
