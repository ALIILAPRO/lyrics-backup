		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The road to glory isn't always paved with gold
We gave it everything we got but lost control
Does it end with all guns blazing?
This is where the final curtain
Cuts short the show!
Cuts short the show!
How did it come down to this moment?
The stars aligned and worked us over
Was the outcome)
Ever in much doubt
What have we done?
We're heading home
One last ride, one last road
We're coming home
Say goodbye to the show
The chase is on! gotta get moving
There's nothing left back there but ruins
Yes, we started out with nothing, but
I believed that we could make this real
Make it real for us
Too much rage and too much damage
Tried to tame her - couldn't manage
I can't take it
I can't take it
I can't take it anymore
Was the outcome
Ever in much doubt
What have we done?
You can't outrun
All of the ghosts
They're bound to catch you up
We're heading home
One last ride, one last road
We're coming home
Say goodbye to the show
We lost control
Went too far down this road
Dreaming of home
It's so hard letting go
Was the outcome
Was the outcome
Ever in much doubt
What have we done?
You can't outrun
You can't outrun
All of the ghosts
They're bound to catch you up
I'm heading home
One last ride, one last road
I'm coming home
Say goodbye to the show
I lost control
Went too far down this road
Time to go home
Heal the scars, cleanse the soul
