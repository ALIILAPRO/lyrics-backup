		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight.
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight.

I'm a poor man's son, from across the railroad tracks,
The only shirt I own is hangin' on my back,
But I'm the envy of every single guy
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye.
Think about stepping on the town for a while
But money's low and my suit's out of style,

But it's all right if my clothes aren't new
Out of sight because my heart is true.
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, out of sight.
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight.

She's a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say,
I guess her folks brought her up that way,
The right side of the tracks, she was born and raised
In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids.
She says no one is better than I, I know I'm just an average guy,

No football hero or smooth Don Juan,
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poorman's son.
Can't give her the things that money can buy
But I'll never, never, never make my baby cry,

And it's all right, what I can't do,
Out of sight because my heart is true,
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight.
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, way out of sight.
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, way out of sight.
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, way out of sight.
Baby, yeah, uptight,
