		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road
I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one, who feels
The way I do

I'm alone, on my own
And that's all I know,
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl
Trying to find a place in this world

Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need?
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
But that's okay

I'm alone, on my own
And that's all I know,
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl
Trying to find a place in this world

Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
But I'm ready to fly

I'm alone, on my own
And that's all I know
Oh, I'll be strong, I'll be wrong
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm alone, on my own
And that's all I know
Oh, I'm just a girl
Trying to find a place in this world

Oh, I'm just a girl
Oh, I'm just a girl, oh, oh
Oh, I'm just a girl
