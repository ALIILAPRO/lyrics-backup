		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I sit reflecting 
I feel the end has begun 
It seems my days now mirror the setting sun 
So many places that I have been 
This ride that was long seems so short in terms of now and then

For All that has been 
And All that is 
All that's to be 
Lord, I'm just killing time 
And time's killing me

Dead man breathing, just taking up space 
Calloused and weathered like the lines on one's face 
Dead man breathing, my conscience is bare 
The lining of my soul is torn yet I no longer care

For All that has been 
And All that is 
All that's to be 
Lord, I'm just killing time 
And time's killing me
