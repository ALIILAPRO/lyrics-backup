		  Internet money, bitch
(Hahahaha, Nick, you're stupid)

I wish that you would love me (love me)
I wish that you would love me more
Nobody else but me (but me)
Like, shawty, what you asking for? (Yeah)
And lil' bitch, I'm right here, ayy
Like, shawty, what you looking for? Yay, yay
I ain't goin', uh, I ain't goin' away
Like, shawty, right there, right there, ayy (yeah)
Nobody can compare, can compare
I know it ain't fair (ain't fair), ain't fair (yeah)
All mine (yeah), all (yeah, huh)

You're all mine (you're all mine), all of mine (all of mine, yeah)
Callin' and brawlin' all the time (all the time, yeah)
Fallin' in love when it all ain't right (all ain't right, yeah)
Crawlin' in my arms when you cry (when you cry)
I don't wanna love, I don't wanna fuck with you
Shawty, keep my love, shawty, keep my love with you (yeah)
I know that I'm stuck, I know that I'm stuck with you (yeah)
Yeah, and I know that's the issue, oh

I wish that you would love me (love me)
I wish that you would love me more
Nobody else but me (but me)
Like, shawty, what you asking for? (Yeah)
And lil' bitch, I'm right here, ayy
Like, shawty, what you looking for? Yay, yay
I ain't goin', uh, I ain't goin' away
Like, shawty, right there, right there, ayy (yeah)
Nobody can compare, can compare
I know it ain't fair (ain't fair), ain't fair (yeah)
All mine, all

I don't wanna love, I don't wanna fuck with you
Shawty, keep my love, shawty, keep my love with you (yeah)
I know that I'm stuck, I know that I'm stuck with you (yeah)
Yeah, and I know that's the issue, oh
