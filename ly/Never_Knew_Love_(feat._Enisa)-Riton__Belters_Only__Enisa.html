		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All these broken pieces inside my body
Never share my secrets with anybody
So afraid to fall, paranoid to risk it all
There's no way of being sure when you're blinded

'Cause if you never knew love, if you never knew love, then you never know
'Cause if you never knew love, if you never knew love, then you never know
'Cause if you never knew love, if you never knew love, then you never know
'Cause if you never knew love, if you never knew love, then you never know
'Cause if you never knew love, never knew love, never knew love, then you never know
Never knew love, never knew love, never knew love, then you never know
Never knew love, never knew love, never knew love, then you never know
Never knew love, never knew love, never knew love
Then you never know

All these broken pieces inside my body
Never share my secrets with anybody
So afraid to fall, paranoid to risk it all
There's no way of being sure when you're blinded

'Cause if you never knew love, if you never knew love, then you never know
'Cause if you never knew love, if you never knew love, then you never know
'Cause if you never knew love, never knew love, never knew love, then you never know
Never knew love, never knew love, never knew love
Then you never know

All these broken pieces, all these broken
All these broken, broken pieces, pieces
There's no way of being sure
There's no way of being sure when you're blind-blind-blinded

'Cause if you never knew love, if you never knew love, then you never know
'Cause if you never knew love, if you never knew love, then you never know
'Cause if you never knew love, if you never knew love, then you never know
'Cause if you never knew love, if you never knew love, then you never know
'Cause if you never knew love, never knew love, never knew love, then you never know
Never knew love, never knew love, never knew love, then you never know
Never knew love, never knew love, never knew love, then you never know
Never knew love, never knew love, never knew love
Then you never know
