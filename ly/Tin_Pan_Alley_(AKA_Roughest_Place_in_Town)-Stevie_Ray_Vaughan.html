		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Went down to tin pan Alley, see what was going on
Things was too hot down there, couldn't stay very long
Hey hey hey hey, Alley's the roughest place I've ever been
All the people down there, livin' for their whiskey, wine, and gin

I heard a woman scream, yeah and I peeped through the door
Some cat was workin' on Annie with a, Lord with a two-by-four
Hey hey hey hey, Alley's the roughest place I've ever been
All the people down there, livin' for their whiskey, wine, and gin

I heard a pistol shoot, yeah and it was a .44
Somebody killed a crap shooter 'cause he didn't, shake, rattle, and roll
Hey hey hey hey, Alley's the roughest place I've ever been
All the people down there, killin' for their whiskey, wine, and gin

I saw a cop standin', with his hand on his gun
Said "this is a raid boys now, Lord nobody run"
Hey, hey, hey, Alley's the roughest place I've ever been
Yeah they took me away from that Alley
Lord and took me right back, to the pen
