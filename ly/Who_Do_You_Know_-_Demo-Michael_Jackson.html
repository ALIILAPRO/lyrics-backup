		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've lost my baby, two years ago
Have you seen her?
She seems to be on a mission
Wound up in a smile
Did you notice her? All gone
She was only playin', with love
Gonna get you this, all gone
Well, she seemed to up and left me
What an awful blow
Can you tell me which way did she go? Oh
(Alright)

Tell me, who do you know? Who do you know?
Who do you know? Who do you know?

She was only playin', with this guy
Did you notice this? All gone
She seemed to be on a mission
Bound up in his smile
Did you notice this? Oh lord
She was just missin', lovin' this guy
Gonna get you this, oh man (Ooh, ooh)
But she seemed to up and left me
What an awful blow
Can you tell me which way did she go? Oh

Tell me, who do you know? (Oh)
Who do you know? (I lost my baby)
Who do you know? Who do you know? (O oh)

'Cause she said that she was
Leavin' on a midnight train
Did you notice that, she wasn't dreaming?
Ooh ooh she said that she was grievin'
Who would only notice?
Oh, that message in her smile
(In her smile, hee) alright (Alright)
But I'm only human too, human too

I've lost my baby two years ago
Have you seen her? (Alright, yeah)
Oh, she seemed to up and left me
What an awful blow
Can you tell me which way did she go? Oh
(Ooh, girl)

Tell me, who do you know?
Who do you know? (I lost my baby)
Who do you know? Who do you know?
(Can you tell me which way did she go?)
Who do you know? (Hoo hoo hoo hoo)
Who do you know? (I lost my baby)
Who do you know? (yeah) who do you know?
(Can you tell me which way did she go?)
Who do you know? (Hoo hoo hoo hoo)
Who do you know? (I gotta find her)
Who do you know? (yeah)
Who do you know? (Tell me which way)
Who do you know? (Ah yeah, hoo hoo)
Who do you know?
Can you tell me which way did she go?

Ahh doo doo
(Alright, Hahaha)
