		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No other love can warm my heart
Now that I've known the comfort of your arms
No other love.
Oh the sweet contentment that I find with you every time
Every time.
No other lips could want you more 
For I was born to glory in your kiss.
Forever yours
I was blessed with love to love you 
Til the stars burn out above you
Til the moon is but a silver shell
No other love, let no other love
Know the wonder of your spell
