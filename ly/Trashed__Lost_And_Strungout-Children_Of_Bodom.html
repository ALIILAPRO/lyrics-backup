		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What you mean for the?
Question of you
Trying to be kicking ass to help me?
After you know I never to go
Before I go high,
I'm very down
You know I'm strong enough to get it again
You try to be on the way,
Not be trashed, lost and strungout
When together try something drug and you question me what's to coming out
Before I go high,
I'm very down
You know I'm strong enough to get it again

Come on!

Maybe I ? fucking more, I turn to you
And trashed people asking my?
Tell me where to fuck to go

Whatever getting to the point where cracking it you, nothing hard trying to be some out of you
Let me down where you down below, to the?
You may go
Well, let me in, I raise my slavery well,
For the not by your reflection
Forever I saw kiss you goodbye,
So kill my soul and diction

Before I blow my needle ground
You me poor, I never return
Up and next you tell me what to go
And you know I'm strong enough to get it again

Whatever getting to the point where cracking it you, nothing hard trying to be some out of you
Let me down where you down below,
To the? you may go
Well, let me in, I raise my slavery well,
For the not by your reflection
Forever I saw kiss you goodbye,
So kill my soul and diction
