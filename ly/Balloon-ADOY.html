		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She was at the red light, she seemed far away
Quiet like a bonsai on a sunny day
In his mind, he was hers
In her blue room in Jericho
She was a new yellow balloon
He was a boy out there
Just a boy out there
He was a boy out there
Just a boy out there
In his mind, he was hers
In her blue room in Jericho
She was a new yellow balloon
She was a new yellow balloon
He was a boy out there
Just a boy out there
He was a boy out there
Just a boy out there
He was a boy out there
Just a boy out there
He was a boy out there
Just a boy out there
