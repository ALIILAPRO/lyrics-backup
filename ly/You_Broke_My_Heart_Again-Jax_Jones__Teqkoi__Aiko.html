		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think you broke my heart again
Please don't leave, and take my hand
Drowning inside these walls of fear
Take my hand, and stay with me, my dear

I think you, I think you, I think you, I think you
Broke again
Bro-broke again (baby, on the inside)
Bro-broke again
Bro-broke again (baby, on the inside)

I think you broke my heart again
Please don't leave, and take my hand
Drowning inside these walls of fear
Take my hand, and stay with me, my dear

Take my hand
(The inside)

I think you broke my heart again
Please don't leave, and take my hand
Drowning inside these walls of fear
Take my hand, and stay with me, my dear

I think you, I think you, I think you, I think you
Broke again
Bro-broke again (baby, on the inside)
Bro-broke again
Bro-broke again (baby, on the inside)

I think you broke my heart again
Please don't leave, and take my hand
Drowning inside these walls of fear
Take my hand, and stay with me, my dear

(Inside)
Broke again, take my hand
(Inside)
Broke again
