		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Said she tired of lil' money, need a big boy
Pull up 20 inch blades like I'm Lil Troy
Now it's everybody flockin', need a decoy
Shawty mixing up the vodka with the LaCroix, yeah
G-Wagon, G-Wagon, G-Wagon, G-Wagon
All the housewives pullin' up (up, up)
I got a lot of toys
720S, bumpin' Fall Out Boy
You was talkin' shit in the beginning (mm)
Back when I was feelin' more forgivin' (more forgivin')
I know it piss you off to see me winnin' (see me winnin')
See the igloo in my mouth when I be grinnin' (I be grinnin'), yeah

Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me
Hunnid deep when I roll like the army
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "wow" (wow, wow)
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me (on me)
Yeah, your grandmama probably know me (know me)
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "wow" (wow, wow)

Bustin' out my jeans, I got big racks (hey)
We gon' pull up in the Cullinan in double G (wow)
I keep a ticket on me, nigga, ain't nothin' to me
I'm draped down in Givenchy
I just put blue guts in the 'Rari
Rich niggas on the intersection, I'm sorry
Bust down watch and shades by Bvlgari
I'm smokin' on jet fuel like Bob Marley
I spent a hunnid thousand on my necklace, check
Real street nigga from the set, mmh, check
I was in the projects, now I'm on the jet
I ain't even tryna talk if it ain't about a check, yeah

Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me
Hunnid deep when I roll like the army
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "wow"
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me (on me)
Yeah, your grandmama probably know me (hey)
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "wow"

Uh
Brand new everything, yeah
Tell your friend to stop it, come here (wow)
No drinks in the Rolls Royce, just got it (yeah)
She wanna bounce on my dick, tell her friend 'bout it (hah)
And the party ain't a party 'til I'm inside it (nope)
If they lick it up, then they invited (wow)
Mighty Duck ice challenge
And I'm looking for a freak with no mileage
I'm back on my shit, fuck how you feel about it (fuck)
Big diamonds on my neck, can't even hide it (no)
Shake that ass tho
Shake that ass tho (wow)
In the bathroom, in a bathrobe
In the front seat of the Lambo'
Bad bitches on the West Coast
Got 'em sayin', "wow" (ha)

Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me (Yeah)
Hunnid deep when I roll like the army (Yeah, yeah)
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "wow" (wow, wow, wow)
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, your grandmama probably know me (yeah, yeah)
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "wow"
(Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow)
