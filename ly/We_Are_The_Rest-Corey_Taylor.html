		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No way to beat me, no way to win
No way to beat me, no way to win
No way to beat me, no way to win
No way to beat me, no way to win

What's the matter with the matter of opinion
Burning at the stakes as one?
Cum and shit satisfying all the minions
Showing on yourself like what are you?

No way to beat me, no way to win
No way to beat me, no way to win

You built shit with the butt of cigarettes
With a one, two, one, two, three

We are the rest, the ones left over
We are the past but the past disowned us
We are the rats 'cause the bats get left behind
We are the rest and we remember
When everybody is a weak pretender
We are the rest when the rest of you are lies

Bury your sick shits, tie it to the tree
Like a dog, like a dog, like a motherfucking dog
Do it on, twist it, lie to believe
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a motherfucking dog

What's the difference, it's a difference of opinion
Even in a different you
Never mind and you've been doing me a favor
Tell me all about it then where do you go?

No way to beat me, no way to win
No way to beat me, no way to win
No way to beat me, no way to win
No way to beat me, no way to win

We are the rest, the ones left over
We are the past but the past disowned us
We are the rats 'cause the bats get left behind
We are the rest and we remember
When everybody is a weak pretender
We are the rest when the rest of you are lies

No way to beat me, no way to win
No way to beat me, no way to win
No way to beat me, no way to win
No way to beat me, no way to win
