		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can dance through the night
Rock 'n roll music itching to fight
Makin' love, drunk or stoned
Lookin' for dollars
Get broken-boned
It's a game, too tough to tame
Ends up the same
Sweatin' out the rain

I was trapped, like a fly on the wall
I was caged, like a zoo animal
No escape, from the fate that you make
You're a snake, I've had all I can take
Watch out, there's a fly on the wall

Take a chance, take a bite
Ooh, rock 'n roll devil, take me tonight
Like a bitch makin' heat
Beatin' on my chest
Lickin' at my feet
It's a game, too tough to tame
Ending up the same
Sweatin' in the rain
So watch out, there's a fly on the wall

I was trapped, like a fly on the wall
I was caged, like a zoo animal
No escape, from the fate that you make
You're a snake, I've had all I can take

I was trapped, like a fly on the wall
I was caged, like a zoo animal
No escape, from the fate that you make
You're a snake, I've had all I can take

I was trapped, like a fly on the wall
I was caged, like a zoo animal
Enraged, by the fate that you make
You're a snake, and I've had all I can take

There's a fly on the wall
