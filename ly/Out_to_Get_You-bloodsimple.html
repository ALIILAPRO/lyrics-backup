		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am addicted to how you make love
So unexplainable when we touch
You ain't never gotta worry about me leaving
What you give me is never too much
There is so much to this is physical
It's like a carnival and I am ready now to go for a ride

I don't I be with you
I don't know why
This love is jumping
I am so into you, I could stay up with you
All night
Don't know why
I am so into you
So into you

When we kissing I just lose my mind
You do something to me every time
And you always say the right thing to me
That's why I don't mind be anything you need me to be
He ain't got to talk say nothing I am content
Being alone with you, I love it you should stay all night

All night
Don't know why
I am so into you, I could stay up with you
All night
Don't know why
I am so into you

I have never had this feeling boy
I should open wide
You opened the door
Never believed this could exist
I don't mind fallin', never gona go back
Because now I know about this

I'm so into you
Into you
I don't wanna be with nobody else but you

All night
Don't know why
I am so into you

I could stay up all night
I don't know why
I'm so into you
So into you
