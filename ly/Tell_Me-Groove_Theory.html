		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, ooh, ooh, yeah

I've been doing my own thing
Love has always had a way of having bad timing
But to my great surprise
Ever since I looked in your eyes
I had one question for you

Tell me if you want me to
Give you all my time
I wanna make it good for you
'Cause you blow my mind
I promise, boy, that I'll be true
You're the perfect find
So tell me if you want me to
Yeah

If you thought I'd sleep on this
Boy, you're wrong 'cause all I dream about is our first kiss
And you're the first one to make me feel like this
And this is one opportunity that I can't miss, no, no
Boy, you wanna know the deal
You are wondering if the words I'm saying are for real
'Cause you got more appeal
Than any man in this whole world
And baby, I got to know how you feel, yeah

Tell me if you want me to
Give you all my time
I wanna make it good for you
'Cause you blow my mind
I promise, boy, that I'll be true
You're the perfect find
So tell me if you want me to, ooh-ooh

Sweetheart (uh-huh)
Now it's time I let you know (let you know, yeah)
I don't want to rush (ooh, baby)
We should take it slow (take it slow, yeah)
Boy, I can love you, can you help me grow?
Give me a new beginning (and I'll give you a happy ending)
Tell me if you want me to (oh my love, please tell me if you want me to)
I wanna make it good for you (I want you to, I want you to)
I wanna make it good, I wanna make it good for you, baby (yes, I do)
I promise, girl, that I'll be true
So tell me if you want me to (so won't you tell me, tell me? Whoa-oh-oh, yeah)
Tell me if you want me to (ooh-ooh, baby)
I wanna make it good for you (ah-ah-ah-ah)
I promise, girl, that I'll be true (oh, oh)
So tell me if you want me to (tell me, baby, hey)

Tell me if you want me to
Wanna make it good for you
Promise, girl, that I'll be true
Tell me if you want me to
Tell me if you want me to (tell me if you want to, I can make it good for you)
I wanna make it good for you (I promise that I'll be true)
I promise, girl, that I'll be true (I really, really want to)
So tell me if you want me to
