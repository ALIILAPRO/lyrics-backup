		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wasn't like me to fall in love
That's just the way that I was
But now when I feel you holding me
Something inside just tells me you've gotten to
This heart of mine
And I know it's true 'cause, darlin', I'm
Darlin', I'm starting to find

I'm getting used to you
Ooh, and I'm loving every single thing about you
I'm getting used to you
And I could never get used to living without you

Didn't think that a love could mean that much
But you sure changed my mind with your touch
Never knew that my heart could need you so
Now I know that these arms can't let you go
No they wouldn't even try
'Cause I'm sure that you're the one that I
Oh, one that I need in my life

I'm getting used to you
Ooh, and I'm loving every single thing about you
I'm getting used to you
And I could never get used to living without you, oh

You've gotten to this heart of mine
And I know its true 'cause, darlin', I
Oh, darlin', I'm starting to find
You're the one I need in my life

I'm getting used to you
Ooh, and I'm loving every single thing about you
I'm getting used to you
And I could never get used to living without you
Ain't no living without loving you

(I'm getting used to you) ooh, getting used to you, ah
(I'm getting used to you)
(I'm getting used to you) getting used to you, ah, yeah
(I'm getting used to you) darlin', darlin'
(I'm getting used to you) getting used to you, baby
(I'm getting used to you)
(I'm getting used to you)
