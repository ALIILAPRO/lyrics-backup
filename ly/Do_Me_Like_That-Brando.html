		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, I’ve just landed in Ibiza for the day,
And I’m wondering if you’re coming out to play,
I’ve got a bottle in my room 423,
With your name,

When you do me like that,
The best I ever had,
I’m caught up in your trap,
And I bet you know,
So good it’s so bad,
You got me running back,
This love will never last,
And I bet you know,
When you do me like that,
Like that,
When you do me like that,
Like that,

Hey, the way you do me I just cannot get enough,
And I apologize if I’m asking too much,
Love Your body is a fire hot to touch,
So Burn me up.
When you do me like that,
The best I ever had,
I’m caught up in your trap,
And I bet you know,
So good it’s so bad,
You got me running back,
This love will never last,
And I bet you know,
When you do me like that,
Like that,
When you do me like that,
Like that, (repeat)
