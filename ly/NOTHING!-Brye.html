		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some middle-aged gym bro
With nothing else to do
Is typing in all caps
Saying I should lose a few
And I'm planning my reply
Wasting my energy
On some unimportant guy
Only trying to bait me

And the more time that I spend on him
The less I spend on me
And the less I spend on me
The less that I'm recovering
I'm drafting up responses
Trying to say the perfect thing
When the only thing I should be saying is
Nothing

I'm squeezing into jeans
'Cause they don't carry my size
And they don't really make clothes for
Bodies that look like mine
And Grace won't stop complaining
About how fat she feels
While I'm in the other changing room
Wishing I could disappear

And the more that I dwell on this
The more that I hate me
And the more that I hate me
The less that I'm recovering
Wishing I could rapidly change everything about me
When the only thing I should be changing is
Nothing
The only thing I should be changing is
Nothing

When my thoughts get mean, what should I do?
(Disengage)
When I feel shame about eating food
(Eat it anyway)
When I gain weight, what should I do?
(Throw the scale away)
The only thing I should be doing is
Nothing
