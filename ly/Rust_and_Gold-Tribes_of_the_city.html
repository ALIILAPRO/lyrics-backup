		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If only you saw what I've seen

What we call the present
Is just a state
Of floating in between
Two golden gates
Of memories and hopes
And disappointment
Dreaming of escape
We are similar
There might be many ways
You know that time is endless

Red rust and gold
Red rust and gold

If only you saw what I've seen
If only you went to where I've been

We're sinking in the grass
As the planes are landing
This moment now pretends
To be expanding
There might be many ways
As the time is endless

If only you saw what I've seen
If only you went to where I've been
