		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stairways

Taking me further

I'm not a sinner

I'm not a saint

These days

Everyone's mad love

Turns into dust and

Hides in the shame

You made me to believe in lies

Baby you know you can't deny

It was a lullaby

Now bye

Bam bam bam bye boy

Bam bam bam bye boy

Stairways

Taking me further

I'm not a sinner

I'm not a saint

These days

Everyone's mad love

Turns into dust and

Hides in the shame

You made me to believe in lies

Baby you know you can't deny

It was a lullaby

Bam bam bam bye boy

Let’s go, yeah

Bam bam bam bye boy

Say I was over you

Don’t know what I should do

Cause everytime we meet

I’m lost again

Don’t know what I should do

I keep on singing you

Don’t wanna play

No, don’t wanna play

You lost yourself

In your own lies

Baby please oh Tell me Why

It was a lullaby

You made me to believe in lies

Baby you know you can't deny

It was a lullaby

Let’s go yeah

Bam bam bam bye boy
