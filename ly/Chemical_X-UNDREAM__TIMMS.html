		  Chemical X

Come out, come out and play with me
I wanna experiment
Get into your biology
And mess with your common sense

You got an appetite
But don’t you get tired of sweet
It’s fun on the darker side
I make it so easy just

Taste it on my lips
Fall in love with unpredictable
Kinda makes you sick
But the buzz is irresistible
Such a pretty poison, take caution if you please, (Cuz ya)
Never know what’s next
When a little you meets chemical X

So pour me out like whiskey neat
And make it a double with that
Superpower energy
That gets you in trouble, yuh

You got an appetite
But don’t you get tired of sweet
It’s fun on the darker side
I make it so easy just

Taste it on my lips
Fall in love with unpredictable
Kinda makes you sick
But the buzz is irresistible
Such a pretty poison, take caution if you please, (Cuz ya)
Never know what’s next
When a little you meets chemical X

So pour me out like whiskey neat
And make it a double with that
Superpower energy
That gets you in trouble, yuh

You got an appetite
But don’t you get tired of sweet
It’s fun on the darker side
I make it so easy so

Taste it on my lips
Fall in love with unpredictable
Kinda makes you sick
But the buzz is irresistible
Such a pretty poison, take caution if you please, (Cuz ya)
Never know what’s next
When a little you meets chemical X
