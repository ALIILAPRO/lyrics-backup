		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't sit and wait, just stare at the door
Take the risk, it's worth getting caught
One day I'll hear the final call, but that won't shake me
I'm going out standing tall, won't let them break me

Moments of sheer delight
Looking back at the times we were fearless

Tell me what you're waiting for, why you're not trying
I can't wait around anymore, I can't keep hiding
They want me to fall, they want you to fall
Tell me what you're waiting for
(Tell me what you're waiting for, tell me what you're waiting for)

No one knows who's really to blame
You have no choice, just do as they say
Answers going 'round your head, but you're not talking
Just going with the flow instead, the fear of falling

Moments of sheer delight
Looking back at the times we were fearless (yeah)
I can't tell what was right
Looking back on my life for my heroes

Tell me what you're waiting for, why you're not trying
I can't wait around anymore, I can't keep hiding
They want me to fall, they want you to fall
Yeah, they want us to fall
(Tell me what you're waiting for, tell me what you're waiting for)
(Tell me what you're waiting for, tell me what you're waiting for)

(Tell me what you're waiting for, tell me what you're waiting for)
Seen it all before
(Tell me what you're waiting for, tell me what you're waiting for)
Staring at the door
(Tell me what you're waiting for, tell me what you're waiting for)
Seen it all before
(Tell me what you're waiting for, tell me what you're waiting for)

Tell me what you're waiting for, why you're not trying
I can't wait around anymore, I can't keep hiding
They want me to fall, they want you to fall
Yeah, they want us to fall
