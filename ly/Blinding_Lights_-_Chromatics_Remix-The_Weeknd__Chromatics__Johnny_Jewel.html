		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (oh)
No one's around to judge me (oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey

I've been tryna call (yeah)
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh

The city's cold and empty (oh)
No one's around to judge me (oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

I'm just coming back to let you know (back to let you know)
I could never say it on the phone (say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (ooh)

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
Hey

Oh-oh
I said, oh-oh
I said, oh-oh
I said, oh-oh

"Hey, it's me
I know it's been a while, but
I was just thinking about you, and
I'm sorry about everything
I miss you"

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

The city's cold and empty
No one's around to judge me
I can't see clearly when you're gone

(I said)
The city's cold and empty
No one's around to judge me
I can't see clearly when you're gone
