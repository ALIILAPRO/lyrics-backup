		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's always staring at the stars
Been tracing constellations up and down her scars
That girl is somewhere on Mars
And she won't come down
Lights only burn up in the dark
Like polaris in a solar flare, falling apart
As rocket engines start
There's a whisper in the dark
Take me to the otherside
Take me to the neon sky
Cause I ain't afraid of the takeoff or fading through space and time
Take me to the other side
Light years and life forms between us
Black holes and soundwaves to lead us
Through the night
Take me to the otherside
But now the engine's burning up
And you swore to me that we could touch the face of god
But you were wrong
Take me to the other side
Take me to the neon sky
Cause I ain't afraid of the takeoff or fading through space and time
Take me to the other side
