		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You shout it loud
But I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud not saying much
I'm criticized but all your bullets ricochet
You shot me down, but I get up

I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
Shot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
Shot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium

Cut me down
But it's you who'll have further to fall
Ghost town, haunted love
Raise your voice, but sticks and stones may break my bones
I'm talking loud not saying much

I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, take your aim
Fire away, fire away
Shot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
Shot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
I am titanium
I am titanium

Stone-hard, machine gun
Firing at the ones who run
Stone-hard as bulletproof vest

You shot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
Shot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
Shot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
Shot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
