		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you, body and soul

I spend my days in longin'
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you, body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you turn away romance, oh

Are you pretending?
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have one more chance to prove it, dear

My life, a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you, body and soul

Are you pretending?
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have one more chance to prove, dear

My life, a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you, body and soul
