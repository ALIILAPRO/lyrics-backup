		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm in a skip divided, malfunction
I flap around and dive bomb
Frantically around your lie
Enveloped in a sad distraction
I've got your voice repeating endlessly
Could you guide me in
Could you smother me

I'd swoop around your head
But I never hit
I'm blinded by your daylight
Electric veins passed through me
I thought there was this big connection
I only got my name and I got this situation

I just need a number and location
Without appropriate papers or permissions
I'm no to buy tight situation
And then I head into your french windows
I thought there was this big connection
I only got my name
I only got my situation

I just need my number and location
The wall keeps telling me
Hey Hey, Hey Hey
Hey Hey, The devil may
Hey Hey, Hey Hey, Hey Hey

Yeah, you are a fool, you are a fool
For sticking round, for sticking round

Yeah, you are a fool, you are a fool
For sticking round, for sticking round

I've done every trick in the book
I tried to look at you
Every trick in the book
How come I look?

No more common dress or elliptical caress
Don't look into your eyes cause you're desperately in love, in love, in love

When you walk in a room everything disappears
When you walk in a room it's a terrible mess
When you walk in a room I start to melt
When you walk in a room I follow you 'round
Like a dog I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a lapdog
I'm your lapdog, yeah

I just got my number and location
I just need my number and location
