		  (Great John on the beat, by the way)
Hold on, huh
I make this shit look
Hold on, hold on, look, huh

I make this shit look good, uh
Flexin' on 'em 'cause I could 
Run up on me, wish you would, look
Turn the bad into good 
And I'm still up in the hood, huh
Ask about me, boy, I'm good, look

Homie just threw me a pack, look, no, he ain't gettin' it back
Niggas ain't real, man, I know they cap
Said it twice 'cause I know that's facts
Hold on, course he's a bitch, want beef, he season shit
Frost all of that demon shit, free Fresh, he leavin' shit, wait
She wanna fuck today, but I'm gettin' bucks today
Chopper on me, you get brushed today
Guess you outta luck today, wait
Better not up them rates
Hold on, huh, better not up them rates
Better not up them rates

Look, you will get touched, no base, huh, look
Stay with a brush, no toothpaste
You would get baked, no soufflé, look, look
Really send shots, no 2K, you will get hit, no touché, yeah
Lay down on the back, if you put up a front, shit get lit, call it dynamite, huh
Know that we run the city like Dunkin'
But you know a donut could die tonight, huh, look
We don't call bluffs like poker
Move funny, that shit'll get crazy
Pop me a Perc', I was feelin' too lazy, ayy
Know I be saucin', gravy, huh
I be like, "Fuck you, pay me"
Know I got drip, my shit too wavy
Cop packs like crack in the '80s
You will get stretched like doubts, don't play me
Straps up like we don't want babies, ayy
And we give no fucks today, huh
Send this bitch up today
Run up on me, test your luck today
Yellow tape, they gon' investigate, ayy

I make this shit look good, uh
Flexin' on 'em 'cause I could 
Run up on me, wish you would, look
Turn the bad into good 
And I'm still up in the hood, huh
Ask about me, boy, I'm good, huh

Too good, we make this shit look too easy
Ride around town, just me, Sleepy
You'll get wet up, no squeegee
Ayy, uh, move sneaky
Bad bitch with me, shit too beefy
K to the L, we too greasy
I just came back from a money meetin'
Ayy, huh, gang tweakin'
He tried to run up, now he bleedin'
Fuck up a check like I don't need it
Now we eat good, no cold pizza

Ayy, ayy, now we eat good, that's all seasons
Ayy, wait, she wanna take pics like Mon' Lisa, ayy
