		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hail to the new leader now
Ruler of this land,
With plans that follow
To demonstrate
Fear the blackened band
So horrid
And deathly true
Dishonest and powermad
Unspoken, sealed fate
Bursting to desolate

His love to hate
He'll murder souls like me and you
But along the way
He'll have to dwell
In his own hell

Clear the streets
See them marching
While columns take a stand
Time provoked, their mirror of hatred
With dark uncanny plans
To take out
And follow through
Just following their orders
With death rates
And death's roll
Those poor unfortunate souls

His love to hate
He'll murder souls like me and you
But along the way
He'll have to dwell
In his own hell

Twisting and turning
Through the mazes in your head
But in a time like this
You're better off dead

The time has come now
Put up or shut down
The feelings that you have
Were lost and never found

His love to hate
He'll murder souls like me and you
But along the way
He'll have to dwell
In his own hell
