		  Adult, adult, 
Adult 
Education

Afternoon in the homeroom, they're about to let you go
And the locker slams on the plans you had tonight
You've been messing around with your boyfriend, maybe better left alone
There's a wise guy that you know who could put you right

In the lot, the boy that's idling by doesn't rev your heart
'Cause it's only lonely spots he shares with you
And the long halls and the gray walls are gonna split apart
Believe it or not there's life after high school
And that's why

The student body's got a bad reputation (oh yeah, oh yeah)
What they need is adult education
You go back to school, it's a bad situation (oh yeah, oh yeah)
What you want is an adult 
Education
Oh yeah

The teacher don't know about how to deal with the student body
And the underclassmen are flashing hot and cool
All your girlfriends care about the watch you wear and talkin' about it
Believe it or not there's life after high school
That's why

The student body's got a bad reputation (oh yeah, oh yeah)
What they need is adult education
You go back to school, is a bad situation (oh yeah, oh yeah)
What you want is an adult 
Education
Oh yeah

They're calling it a preparation
You're waiting for a separation
You're nothing but another odd number
Memories that you won't remember

So you got a little education
And a lot of dedication
But you want a little night school
Maybe some of it will rub off on you

The boys are busy in the mirrors
Trying to imitate their heroes
You make it with a false surrender
More memories you won't remember

The senior with the junior Miss
I wonder what the junior wishes
That she could graduate to adult
That she could graduate to adult kisses

Adult education
Adult education
Adult education it's a bad situation
Adult education

Adult, adult, educate, educate, education
Adult, adult, adult, educate, educate, education
Adult, adult
