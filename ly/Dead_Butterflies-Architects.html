		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna bother God
I wanna feel the ground beneath my feet
But I've got a smile full of broken teeth

Goodbye, all the doves have flown away
I must've lost myself, lost myself, lost myself

I know it's not enough
Why does defeat always taste so bittersweet?
I just wanna live and die in peace

The flower that never blossoms is quickly forgotten
It must be gold if it's glistening
I must've lost myself, lost myself, lost myself

Goodbye, all the doves have flown away
I must've lost myself, lost myself, lost myself
Fly high 'cause the ravens are here to stay
I must've lost myself, lost myself, lost myself in a cloud of

Dead butterflies, dead butterflies, dead butterflies, dead butter
Dead butterflies, dead butterflies, dead butterflies

The flower that never blossoms is quickly forgotten
It must be gold if it's glistening
I must've lost myself, lost myself, lost myself

Goodbye, all the doves have flown away
I must've lost myself, lost myself, lost myself in a cloud of

Dead butterflies, dead butterflies, dead butterflies, dead butterflies
Fly high 'cause the ravens are here to stay
I must've lost myself, lost myself, lost myself in a cloud of
Dead butterflies, dead butterflies, dead butterflies
