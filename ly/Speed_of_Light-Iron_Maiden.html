		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another time, another place
A hollow universe in space
I took a trip to see the sights
That will be black over a night
One way ticket now returned
My shootin' stars are vastly burnt
On the edge that we can't see
Let's shot the moon, you and me
And that particular you'll see
A just too lonesome galaxy

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light
Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
We slip into the night

I'll say a mass for you and wave
Shootin' plasma from my grave
Event horizon lost in space
Runnin' in a human race
I don't know where I don't know why
But somehow back in time again
I'm on the edge you can't see
Another take your love at night
A single party call on me
You won't be trackin' me by sight

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light
Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
We slip into the night

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light
Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light
Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light

We slip into the night
