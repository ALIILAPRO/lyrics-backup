		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So hot, don't know what to do
'Cause I'm so shy, I'm fucking with you

I know what I want now, no shade no hatin'
But if that's your date then you need a replacement
No shade no hatin', no lines no waitin'
Loud body language, no conversations
Just meet me in the back of the room
When I found out that you're here
I wanted to do it here, I think we should vacay
You can be my souvenir

Yeah, 'cause kissin' you was very nice
The rest of you is paradise
Got me shakin' like a pair of dice
Body rollin' like a pair of dice
I be fuckin' with him every night
Fuckin' with him every night

I know what I want now
No wait, no patience
Don't trip, won't say shit
Private location
No shade, no hatin'
Your girl can't say shit
Loud body language, no conversations
Just let me do whatever with you
Give me some I'm not scared
Give it back, yea I'll share
Vacation at my place
I can be your souvenir

Yeah, 'cause kissin' you was very nice
The rest of you is paradise

I walked in through the back
Can't go through the front my engine go in the back
Trunk go in the front
She was givin' me brains while I was rollin' one up
When I shoot it I score
When I hit it she jump
Don't see no keys when I'm pullin' up Keys
When I'm folding up, peace, let it roll about Wiz
Started going over seas and rolling up trees
I'm buying it all, I don't like to tease her
Oh you ain't heard?
I'm in the game
And I ain't on stage darling but scream my name
So the next step's we go get a plane
Then we fly a place where don't nobody know us
Then I'm gonna wait to say what you want
Then I'm going in for a taste, especially below your waist
I got a plan for the place, I got a band for the case
You tell me play my cards right
I got a hand full of aces
Fucking with you every night
Body looking very tight
And um

The rest of you is paradise
Got me shaking like a pair of dice
Body rollin' like a pair of dice
I be fuckin' with him every night
Fuckin' with him every night

The rest of you is paradise
