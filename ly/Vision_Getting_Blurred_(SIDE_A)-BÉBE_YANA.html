		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (Where's the love?)
(Lo-lo-love)

(Where's the love?)
(Lo-lo-love)

I've been lucid dreaming, welcome to our final fantasy
아직 헷갈려도 baby tell me what's reality
어지러운 crystal light
몸은 마치 paralyzed

I got glitter in my body and my vision getting blurred
Vision getting blurred
V-vision getting blurred

I got glitter in my body and my vision getting blurred
Vision getting blurred
V-vision getting blurred

I got glitter in my body and my vision getting blurred

Flashing pink blue lights
Boys being jealous all night (n-n-n-night)
Can you keep the secret?
Sneaky in the back room you and I

You and I 
Wake up in the morning just you and I 
See, you'll come around me boy
We're not in the black room, shadows flying to the moon (flying to the moon)

You've been
So good
So sweet to me all this time

You won't
Be here but I just wanna be your

I've been lucid dreaming, welcome to our final fantasy
아직 헷갈려도 baby tell me what's reality
어지러운 crystal light
몸은 마치 paralyzed

I got glitter in my body and my vision getting blurred
Vision getting blurred
V-vision getting blurred (oh)

I got glitter in my body and my vision getting blurred (call me babe)
Vision getting blurred
V-V-vision getting blurred

I got glitter in my body and my vision getting blurred

(Ah)
Where's the love?
Lo-lo-love (locked to you)
(Call me babe)
(Ah)
Where's the love?
Lo-lo-love 
(Call me babe)
(locked to you)

(Ah)
Is this a deja-vu?
I only see this with you
No more air inside the room
I can't escape I'm locked to you
(Where's the love? Lo-lo-love)

(Ah)
Is this a deja-vu?
I only see this with you
No more air inside the room
I can't escape I'm locked to you
(Where's the love? Lo-lo-love)

I've been lucid dreaming, welcome to our final fantasy
아직 헷갈려도 baby tell me what's reality (what's reality)
어지러운 crystal light
몸은 마치 paralyzed (oh)

I got glitter in my body and my vision getting blurred (where's the love?)
Vision getting blurred (woah)
V-vision getting blurred

I got glitter in my body and my vision getting blurred (oh)
Vision getting blurred (oh)
V-V-vision getting blurred

I got glitter in my body and my vision getting blurred 
(Where's the love? Lo-lo-love)
