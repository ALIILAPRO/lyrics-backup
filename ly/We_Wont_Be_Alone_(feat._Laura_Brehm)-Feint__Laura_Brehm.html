		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You paint a picture in my mind
You want to leave it all behind
In a world that's turning all the time
Nothing could stop me longing for your eyes

I won't let it die
I can feel you when you're not around
When the night gets cold
I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't be alone

We won't be alone
(We won't, we won't)
(We won't, we won't)
(We won't, we won't)
(We won't be alone)

(We won't be alone)

This lake of fire burns my skin
How could love wear so thin
I'm sinking in the hollow ground
Nothing can stop me wanting you somehow

I won't let it die
I can feel you when you're not around
When the night gets cold
I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't be alone

We won't be alone
(We won't, we won't)
(We won't, we won't)
(We won't be alone)
(We won't, we won't)
(We won't, we won't)
(We won't be alone)

(We won't be alone)

I won't let it die
I can feel you when you're not around
When the night gets cold
We won't be alone
