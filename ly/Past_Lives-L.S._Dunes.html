		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drained, fountains
Counting footsteps out of sync 
Truth, running bow line
Out a sheep shank
Tied two tin cans together

I hear the whistle blowing Mississippi one and two
I got the comment section grammar correction blues 
I hear the numbers calling Mississippi three and four
Reject the influence 
Reject the influenza 

I'm not all my mistakes
No matter what they say about it 
(I can't shake it now) there's no use giving up
(I can't shake it now) I know we can get well
Know we can get well

Faced, outlined 
Covered thumbprints under dust
I fear some indecisions 
Exercise my lazy eye 
You'll burn the comment section grammar correction bile
We count the scalp coming in dissection of the trial 
Reject the influence 
Reject the influenzas 

I'm not all my mistakes
No matter what they say about it 
(I can't shake it now) there's no use giving up
(Oh, I can't shake it now) I know we can get well
Know we can get well

What difference would it make?
Outlining the rest, just to see how long it last 
You're afraid, yeah

Bury me in the comment section 
I belong to this 
I hope that you will never have to feel the scissor ocular's command
What difference would it make?

I'm not all my mistakes
No matter what they say about it 
There's no use giving up
I know we can get well
I know we can get well
(I can't shake it now) I'm not my mistakes
(No, no, I can't shake it now) no matter what they say about it 
I can't take it back
(I can't shake it now)
I know we can get well
