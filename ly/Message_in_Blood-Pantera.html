		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a place that I keep deep inside me 
It can trigger my mind 
All along I knew it has been with me 
Since I was just a child 

I just summon power within my soul 
It has given me life, beyond life 
I take blame for my murderous problem 
My signature always reminds 

It's a message in blood 
It's your cryptic warning 
Within the message in blood 
Marks the years of pain
And your godforsaken ending to life 

I'm provoked into sick confrontations
Brutal time after time
Bed of nails, suffocation, life's ending
Slay in different designs 
One man's misery is another man's mystery 
No one cares to understand my demented means 
Sticks and stones can break all your brittle bones
Epitaph written at your feet 

It's a message in blood 
It's your cryptic warning 
Within the message in blood 
Marks the years of pain
And your godforsaken ending to life

It's a message in blood 
It's your cryptic warning 
Within the message in blood 
Marks the years of pain
And your godforsaken ending to life

Message in blood, message in blood 
Message in blood, message in blood
