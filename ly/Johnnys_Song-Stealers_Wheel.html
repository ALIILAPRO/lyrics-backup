		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Looking for something, looking for one thing
Trying to find anything that makes you feel
Gotta keep goin', don't let it get you down
You've been taking it so hard, taking it on the head
Don't you know life's as good as being dead?
Gotta keep movin', don't let it get you down
Now you've got nothing to lose
When everyone around you tells you you're doin' fine
They're gonna drive you crazy
So don't close your eyes and swallow all those lies
Don't believe what you've been told
'Cause you'll wake up one day knowing nothing they say
Can satisfy your soul
Gotta keep movin', don't let it get you down
Now you've got nothing to lose
When everyone around you tells you you're doin' fine
They're gonna drive you crazy
So don't close your eyes and swallow all those lies
Don't believe what you've been told
'Cause you'll wake up one day knowing nothing they say
Can satisfy your soul
(repeat first verse)
