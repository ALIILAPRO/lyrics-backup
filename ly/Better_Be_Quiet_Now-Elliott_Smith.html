		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wish you gave me your number
Wish I could call you today, just to hear a voice
I got a long way to go
I'm getting further away

If I didn't know the difference living alone'd probably be ok
It wouldn't be lonely
I got a long way to go
I'm getting further away

A lot of hours to occupy, it was easy when I didn't know you yet 
Things I have to forget
But I better be quiet now
I'm tired of wasting my breath
Carrying on and getting upset

Maybe IÃ‚ got a problem, but that's not what I wanted to say
I'd prefer to say nothing.
I got a long way to go
I'm getting further away.

Had a dream as an army man with an order just to march in my place
While a dead enemy screams in my face
But I better be quiet now 
I'm tired of wasting my breath
Carrying on, not over it yet

Wish I knew what you're doing
And why you want to do it this way, so I can't go the distance
I got a long way to go 
I'm getting further away
I got a long way to go
I'm getting further away
