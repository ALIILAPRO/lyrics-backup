		  Got you
Got you
Got you
Got you

This, ready or not
Tell 'em here I come
That girl approach me or not
I bet that chick gon' come

This, ready or not
Tell 'em here I come
That girl approach me or not
I bet that chick gon' come

Bunch of red cups
And some bad chicks
What I got up in these pants, you can have this
But if you catch me on a spliff
I won't pass shit
I only gets down with a chick 
If she a bad bitch
Ha, so come push my buttons
I only hit it once
I don't call for nothing
You got a glass
I'll bring bottles by the dozen
Ain't shit to tell
Your chick I does

(Got you) Ready or not
(Got you) Tell 'em here I come
(Got you) That girl approach me or not
(Got you) I bet that chick gon' come

(Got you) Ready or not
(Got you) Tell 'em here I come
(Got you) That girl approach me or not
(Got you) I bet that chick gon' come

I got your girl yelling Mr. Roboto
I got your girl yelling Mr. Roboto
I got your girl yelling Mr. Roboto
I got your girl yelling Mr. Roboto

(Got you) Ready or not
(Got you) Tell 'em here I come
(Got you) That girl approach me or not
(Got you) I bet that chick gon' come

Got you
Got you
Got you
Got you
Got you
Got you
Got you
Got you
Got you
Got you
Got you
Got you
Got you

Bunch of red cups
And some bad chicks
What I got up in these pants, you can have this
But if you catch me on a spliff
I won't pass shit
I only gets down with a chick 
If she a bad bitch
Ha, so come push my buttons
I only hit it once
I don't call for nothing
You got a glass
I'll bring bottles by the dozen
Ain't shit to tell
Your chick I does

(Got you) Ready or not
(Got you) Tell 'em here I come
(Got you) That girl approach me or not
(Got you) I bet that chick gon' come

(Got you) Ready or not
(Got you) Tell 'em here I come
(Got you) That girl approach me or not
(Got you) I bet that chick gon' come

Got you
Got you
Got you
Got you

I got your girl yelling Mr. Roboto
I got your girl yelling Mr. Roboto
I got your girl yelling Mr. Roboto
I got your girl yelling Mr. Roboto

I bet that chick gon' come

Got you
Got you
Got you
Got you
Got you
Got you
Got you
Got you
