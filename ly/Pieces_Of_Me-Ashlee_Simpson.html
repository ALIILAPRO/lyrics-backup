		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On a Monday, I am waiting
Tuesday, I am fading
And by Wednesday, I can't sleep
Then the phone rings, I hear you
And the darkness is a clear view
'Cause you've come to rescue me

Fall, with you I fall so fast
I can hardly catch my breath
I hope it lasts

Oh, it seems like I can finally
Rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
Oh, it's as if you know me better
Than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me

I am moody and messy
I get restless and it's senseless
How you never seem to care

When I'm angry, you listen
Make me happy, it's your mission
And you won't stop 'til I'm there

Fall, sometimes I fall so fast
When I hit that bottom crash
You're all I have

Oh, it seems like I can finally
Rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
Oh, it's as if you know me better
Than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me

How do you know?
Everything I'm about to say
Am I that obvious?
And if it's written on my face
I hope it never goes away
Yeah

On a Monday, I am waiting
And by Tuesday, I am fading
Into your arms
So I can breathe

Oh, it seems like I can finally
Rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
Oh, it's as if you know me better
Than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
Oh, I love how you can tell
Oh, I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
