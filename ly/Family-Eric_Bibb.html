		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Won´t waste your time tryin’ to sell my point of view
I’ll just tell you, so you’ll know who
Who I am 
Just a wee bit more
Gettin’ to know each other
That’s what life is for

I am like you
Woman born
I am like you
A child of God
You are like me
Here to learn from history
You are like me
Family

Let’s open our eyes, call a spade a spade
Someone makin’ money by keeping us afraid
Afraid of each other
Back in time we might have been
Brothers from a different mother
They called it a sin

I am like you
Woman born
I am like you
A child of God
You are like me
Here to learn from history
You are like me
Family

I am like you
Woman born
I am like you
A child of God
You are like me
Here to learn from history
You are like me
Family

Family…
