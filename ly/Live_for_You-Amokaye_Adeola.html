		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lord in you I don't wanna fail 
Cos I know my strength can faint
Even though the earth fade away
You'll remain the same
Lord in you I chose to remain
Cos I know my faith can shake
Even when the earth fade away
I'll still remain

When at that edge when things now work for me
I won't forget all that you want me be 
In my mistake your grace will make me strong
My heart is settled to
clways live for you.

I wanna live my life 
Live my life for you

Lord I'll rest in your sustaining grace 
Your word is my food everyday
Beyond flesh I'll live by faith
In your name

When I'm at that edge when things now work for me
I won't forget all that you want me be 
In my mistake your grace will make me strong
My heart is settled to
clways live for you.

I wanna live my life 
Live my life for you
