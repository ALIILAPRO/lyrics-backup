		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rolling round in my sheets
Oh no I can’t get to sleep
Cos you’re still at the front of my mind
I’m not used to the truth
And that’s all because of you
Cos you wrapped me up in all of your lies

I don’t wanna come back
I don’t miss you like that but I’m thinking bout the things you said
Wish it was a bad dream I could wake up and leave but I’m regretting what I never said

Oh I’m learning how to live without ya
Turning pages that are not about ya
Crazy after everything we’ve been through
You’re still stuck in my head
Wish it was somebody else instead

You’re still stuck in my head
Wish it was somebody else instead

Couple months down the line
And you know I’m doing fine
But nobody looks the same in my bed
Wish I could leave us behind and then move on with my nights
But I can’t help myself that I care

I don’t wanna come back
I don’t miss you like that but I’m thinking bout the things you said
Wish it was a bad dream I could wake up and leave but I’m regretting what I never said

Oh I’m learning how to live without ya
Turning pages that are not about ya
Crazy after everything we’ve been through
You’re still stuck in my head
Wish it was somebody else instead

You’re still stuck in my head
Wish it was somebody else instead

You’re still stuck in my head
Wish it was somebody else instead

You’re still stuck in my head
Wish it was somebody else instead
