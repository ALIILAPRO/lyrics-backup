		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say you're still her; the woman you were, and you haven't turned into
Someone who never could love me again
'Cause you never broke my heart, no, you fixed it, and now it works
But only enough just to suffer that hurt

What can I say to convince you to slip back into my arms again?
I won't do you no harm again, lemme tell you that I'm sorry and that

I'm just a little bit crazy about you
Just a little bit out of my mind
Just a little insane without you
Please come back and be just a little bit mine
Just a little bit mine

I never thought, and if I did, I forgot while blacked out in-love
That's what's only starting would come to an end
But now I'm hungover and hung out to dry, and I'm giving it time
Does not knowing the truth turn my words into lies?

What can I say to convince you or do to make you agree with me?
I don't need you to be with me, just try to remember what you'd see in me

I'm just a little bit crazy about you
Just a little bit out of my mind
Just a little insane without you
Please come back and be just a little bit mine
Just a little bit mine

I'll be here singing til our heartbeats might slip back into that rhythm again
Whether it is or isn't the end, who cares? God knows that I could use a friend

I'm just a little bit crazy about you
Just a little bit out of my mind
Just a little insane without you
Please come back and be just a little
I'm just a little bit crazy about you
Just a little bit out of my mind
Just a little insane without you
Please come back and be just a little bit mine
â€‹Just a little bit mine
