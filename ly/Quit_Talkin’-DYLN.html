		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Two eyes two ears
They for something two legs
But your mouth keep on runnin'
You must really love the sound of your voice
Cause every time I hear it
Yeah it sounds like noise
Peeling all the layers back like an onion
You've been talking ears off
With your opinion
Is you an alien? You ain't even human
Slow it down now shut up!
Quit talkin what you say?
I don't hear nothin shut up!
Quit talkin what you say?
I don't hear nothin baby I know you
This ain't nothing new
Bet you think it's fun
But you're looking real dumb
Yeah you got a lotta tongue now shhhhhhh

Shut up i don't wanna hear another
Word out your mouth
If you keep on talkin' then
Imma drown you out blah blah blah
You're boring!
Think that you some type of genius
Look at you, Ain't that convenient
Hate to tell you but the truth is
You're full of shit

Shut up! Quit talkin
What you say? I don't hear nothin
Shut up! Quit talkin'
What you say? I don't hear nothin
Baby I know you this ain't nothing new
Bet you think it's fun
But you're looking real dumb
Yeah you got a lotta tongue now shhhhhhh
