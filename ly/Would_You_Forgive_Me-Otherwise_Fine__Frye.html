		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Would you forgive me?
If I told you that I'll try
Run away into the night
Just to find you
Would you forgive me?
If I sang the perfect line
The only song that's on my mind
Is you
I never thought
We would play
We would fall
I lost my head
In the game
It's not your fault
Would you forgive me?
If I told you that I love you before
Would you forgive me?
For the way I made you fight
for me when honestly I
I was broken
Hope you believe me
When I say that I need time
You have my heart but should be mine
To use
I never thought
You would stay
You would fall
I lost my head
In the game
It's all my fault
Would you forgive me
If I told you that I loved you
Before
If I told you that I loved
If I told you that I loved you
If I told you that I loved
If I told
If I told you that I loved
If I told you that I loved you
If I told you that I loved
If I told
If I told you that I loved you before
