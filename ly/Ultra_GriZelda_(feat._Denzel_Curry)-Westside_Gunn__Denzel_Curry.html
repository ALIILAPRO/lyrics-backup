Griselda
Ayy

My pockets supper, your pockets suffer
Sharp as a razor when I bring the ruckus
Don't want your girl 'cause she built like a trucker
My bitches thick like they been eating Smucker's
Got her undercover but I won't cuff her
Old chain with the new Gucci puffer
Skinny jeans, but I need to get buffer
Hatin'-ass nigga, why you look flustered, huh?
You should be embarrassed
Bitch, we at fashion week, we out in Paris
Dripped out in Kiko that's freshly produced
If we talkin' 'bout gold, then it's two different karats
Bugs Bunny-ass nigga, hop off my dick
'Cause I'm tryna make hits like a John Wick flick
Stack up, put it on my firstborn jit
Stack up, put it on my firstborn jit

Westside, run it up (ayo, ayo)
My side, run it up (boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom)
Westside, run it up (ayo, ayo, ayo)
My side, run it up (boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom, doot-doot-doot)

Ayo, you was all in love (Love), I was sellin' drugs (ah)
R.i.p. Vino, I was sellin' him guns (ah)
I was wearin' red monkeys, I was on the run (I was on the run)
Watchin' junkies fall out, I was havin' fun (I was havin' fun)
Hit him with the drum (Grrt), put it on the hood (uh)
Angel on the hood, envy's your fresh good (mmh)
Niggas thought Suge came home, so many bloods (ah)
You ain't never took 20 kilos on a bus (ah)

Westside, run it up (ayo, ayo)
My side, run it up (boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom)
Westside, run it up (ayo, ayo, ayo)
My side, run it up (boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom, doot-doot-doot)
Westside, run it up (ayo, ayo)
My side, run it up (boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom)
Westside, run it up (ayo, ayo, ayo)
My side, run it up (boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom, doot-doot-doot, doot-doot-doot, doot-doot-doot)
