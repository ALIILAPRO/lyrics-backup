		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hear the sound, all bow down, show your loyalty
You are advised to just comply, and don't you hesitate
Do you remember the time from before?
When we questioned everything and thought we owned the world?

We gather round and say farewell
While we embrace our prescribed humanity

So step into a world where no one dies
It's time to let go and free your mind
Listen to the sound of the voice inside you
This is the masquerade where we disobey, yeah, yeah

The masquerade

They infect, no consent, watch us all degrade
All of our minds are in decline, so we medicate
This was the plan right from the start
Self-destruction by design while we just play along

Burn it to the ground, we’re so compelled
To entertain this cauterized insanity

So step into a world where no one dies
It's time to let go and free your mind
Listen to the sound of the voice inside you
This is the masquerade where we disobey

We are the ones who went down the rabbit hole
And came out on the other side
So step into a world where no one dies
This is the masquerade where we disobey, yeah, yeah

Come inside, redefine, this is the new domain
Wake up call, the pressure’s on, and it’s your final warning

Round and round to the sound of their tyranny
Do they think they can decide in our name?
Feel the weight of these chains lift away
Once we have gone to the other side

So step into a world where no one dies
It's time to let go and free your mind
Listen to the sound of the voice inside you
This is the masquerade where we disobey

We are the ones who went down the rabbit hole
And came out on the other side
So step into a world where no one dies
This is the masquerade where we disobey, yeah, yeah

(This is the masquerade where we disobey)
(This is the masquerade where we disobey)
