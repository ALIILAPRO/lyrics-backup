		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He said, "Baby, how was your day?
Did you call your mama, is she okay?
Are you thinkin' whiskey or cabernet?
Let me get it, let's get drunk on a weekday"
He said, "I know I don't say it enough
But I swear I love you ain't just from the buzz"
He said, "I don't know what I'd do if I didn't have you"
I said, "I think about that too"

Every night and every morning
I fall all over again and again and you don't even know it
Baby, if you're wonderin' when you hold me
If I still feel forever, only
Every night and every morning

I can see us in fifty years
Rockin' pointed west, rocking chairs
'Cause, baby, some love never fades
And some things never change

Every night and every morning
I fall all over again and again and you don't even know it
Baby, if you're wonderin' when you hold me
If I still feel forever, only
Every night and every morning

He said, "I know I don't say it enough
But, I swear I love you ain't just from the buzz"
He said, "I don't know what I'd do if I didn't have you
If I didn't have you"

Every night and every morning
I fall all over again and again and you don't even know it
Baby, if you're wonderin' when you hold me
If I still feel forever, only
Every night and every morning

Every night and every morning
Every night, every morning
Baby, yeah
