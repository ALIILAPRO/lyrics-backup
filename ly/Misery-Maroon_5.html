		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh yeah
Oh yeah
So scared of breaking it
That you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters
I will never send
Sometimes these cuts are so much
Deeper than they seem
You'd rather cover up
I'd rather let them bleed
So let me be
And I'll set you free (oh yeah)

I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me, oh yeah
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me, oh yeah
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back, yeah

Your salty skin and how
It mixes in with mine
The way it feels to be
Completely intertwined
Not that I didn't care
It's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel
It's what I didn't show
So let me be
And I'll set you free

I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me, oh yeah
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me, oh yeah
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
And now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back, yeah

You say your faith is shaken
And you may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and
Waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused
So far away from you
And I'm getting there
I don't care where I have to run

Why do you do what you do to me? Yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me? Yeah
Why do you do what you do to me? Yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me? Yeah

I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me, oh yeah
Why won't you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me, oh yeah
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
And now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back (come on)

Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

(Girl, you really got me bad)
(You really got me bad)
(Now I'm gonna get you back)
(I'm gonna get you back)
(Girl, you really got me bad)
(You really got me bad)
(Now I'm gonna get you back)
(I'm gonna get you back)
