		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who was I to deserve such a love?
Who was I to have her holding me up?
If there's some kind of sign in the stars, it wasn't revealed
I talk about light in the dark, but it hasn't come here
I can't explain all the doubt that's within
I can't erase memories, places we've been
If the world ever fucked with my heart, she always stepped in
There's a version of life I want, but it wasn't like this

The party's over, she's not coming back
I'd give up all the world for just one Sunday that we had
In time, I will heal
The moonlight's on the open road, tonight, it's not so bad
So bad

Used to try write it down in a word
But no phrase could come close to her worth
To witness the way that she moved and how she stayed still
Was a beauty I haven't seen since, and I never will

The party's over, she's not coming back
I'd give up all the world for just one Sunday that we had
In time, I will heal
The moonlight's on the open road, tonight, it's not so bad

Who am I to curse the past
Just 'cause magic didn't last?
You're one of few, boy
Who can safely say they had
Somebody truly love them back?

The party's over, she's not coming back
I'd give up all the world for just one Sunday that we had
In time, I will heal
The moonlight's on the open road, tonight, it's not so bad
So bad
