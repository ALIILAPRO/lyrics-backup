		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Evenin', every night you come and find me
Must you always come and remind me that my gal has gone
Mmhm, early evenin', can't you see I'm deep in your power
Every minute just like an hour, since my gal is gone

Shadows fall on the wall 
That's the time I miss you most of all
Even though I try, how can I go on, girl? 

Take me evenin' 
Let me sleep 'til grey dawn is breakin'
And you know what, I don't care if I don't awaken, no
Since my gal is gone
(Me too, eh, Ray?)
(Alright now)
Since my gal is gone

(Ah, play that piano)

Shadows fall, said now, on the wall 
That's the time I miss her most of all
Even though I try, how can I go on?

Well, take me evein', take me evein'
Let me sleep 'til great dawn is breakin', yeah
(Yeah, me too) I don't care if I don't awaken (mm-mm)
Since my gal is gone
I know how you feel, since my gal is gone

Since my gal is gone 
(Okay, uncle Tony?)
(Yeah)
