		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I, I am confused, fighting myself
Wantin' to give in, needin' your help
Skin cold with fear, feel it when we touch
Outside, don't know you, but inside, I'm fucked

Can you see it in me? Skin cold from touch
Each day, confronted with what I have done
You pull me closer, I push you away
You tell me it's okay, I can't help but feel the pain

I hate you
Why are you taken?
I love you
Why do I feel so helpless?

Why is it you?
Ripping my insides each time I'm here with you
Why do I cry?
Why do I really need to?

Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Fuck you, bitch

Need to
Need to
Need to
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck

I hate you
Why are you taken?
I loved you
I feel so helpless

Why is it you?
Ripping my insides each time I'm here with you
Why do I try?
Why do I fucking need to?

Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
Slut
