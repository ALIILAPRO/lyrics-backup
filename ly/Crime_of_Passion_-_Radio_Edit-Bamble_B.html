		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On a bright day she passed away in the morning 
It's a cruel way to take her away with no warning
He took her hand through every midnight hour
And then he saw her fading away like a spring shower
I can see a complete life's time
Pictures and posters of times and fashion
Nineteen years with no reason or rhyme
Taken away in a crime of passion

Oohh passion livin' the night
Oohh passion livin' the night
Oohh passion livin' the night
Oohh passion livin' the night

He stood to see if he could catch her breathing
But it was no good he understood she was leaving
He looked outside the frosty window pane
And then he saw her moving away Elizabeth Jane
I can see a complete life's time
Pictures and posters of times and fashion
Nineteen years with no reason or rhyme
Taken away in a crime of passion

Oohh passion livin' the night
Oohh passion livin' the night
Oohh passion livin' the night
Oohh passion livin' the night
