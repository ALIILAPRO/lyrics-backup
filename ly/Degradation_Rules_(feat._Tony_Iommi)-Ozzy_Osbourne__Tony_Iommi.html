		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Twisted little fantasy
Gambling with tragedy and doom, and doom
Addicted to debauchery
Staring at the ceiling in his room, in his room

Asphyxiation, masturbation
Degradation rules

Pulling on his memories
He's ready for the pearl to hit the sky, the sky
Used up all his energy
He wakes up with a twinkle in his eye, in his eye

Asphyxiation, masturbation
Degradation rules
Degradation rules
Join the other fools

Sticky little magazines
He locks the door and goes into his mind, in his mind
Stuck inside a dirty dream
The hand that feeds you also turns you blind, turns you blind

Asphyxiation, masturbation
Degradation rules
Degradation rules
Beating on your jewels

Asphyxiation, masturbation
Degradation rules
Degradation rules
Masturbating fools
Watching RedTube rules

(Hahaha, hahaha)

Ooh, I've cum
