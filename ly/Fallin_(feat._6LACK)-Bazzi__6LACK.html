		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been hoping, I been praying
Someone else could feel this pain and
Save me from the fear, it linger
Only has me falling quicker
Look me in my eye, tell me that we fine (ah, ah)
'Cause right now I feel like I'm stuck up in the fire (ah, ah)
Fading slowly, falling faster (yeah, yeah)
Falling faster (yeah, yeah)

Three days out the week, I don't even sleep
Thoughts runnin' so deep, take control of me
Crashin' in at once, don't know what it's from
Breakin' me to crumbs, I'm tryin' to run
All these drugs takin' all control of me, ooh
Fuckin' with my energy, ooh
Pullin' and it's holdin' me, ooh
Alternate reality, reality

I been hoping, I been praying
Someone else could feel this pain and
Save me from the fear, it linger
Only has me falling quicker
Look me in my eye, tell me that we fine (ah, ah)
'Cause right now I feel like I'm stuck up in the fire (ah, ah)
Fading slowly, falling faster
Falling faster

I can't even eat, I might need some tree
Insecurity got a hold of me
Yeah, I been feelin' down, guess I'll smoke a blunt
Look up to the sky, pray for what I want
But I know that I gotta get back to me (ay)
Recenter and actually (yeah)
Catch myself midair (yeah), then start to floatin' up ('in up)
Sometimes I hate my choices, but I can't hold no grudge (yeah)

I been hoping, I been praying
Someone else could feel this pain and
Save me from the fear, it linger
Only has me falling quicker
Look me in my eye, tell me that we fine (ah, ah)
'Cause right now I feel like I'm stuck up in the fire (ah, ah)
Fading slowly, falling faster
Falling faster
