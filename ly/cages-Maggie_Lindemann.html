		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your condescending undertones
So overplayed, leave me alone
You hate me, but you watch my shit
Say my music sucks, then copy it
I wanna wear the things I wanna wear
Without your comments in my ear
All the whispering is loud as fuck
But who are you to even judge?

Don't ask if I'm okay
'Cause I'm never gonna change

I don't live for you, I live for me
Can't shut me up, you'll hear me scream
Whoa, lions aren't meant for cages
Let me live my life
Don't need approval, not from you
Don't need your take on what I do
Whoa, lions aren't meant for cages
Let me live my life (let me live my life, let me live my life)

I'm gonna crash my car into the wall
Just to see who cares at all
I'll take a one way ticket out of here
And if I want I'll fucking disappear

Don't ask if I'm okay
'Cause I'm never gonna change

I don't live for you, I live for me
Can't shut me up, you'll hear me scream
Whoa, lions aren't meant for cages
Let me live my life
Don't need approval, not from you
Don't need your take on what I do
Whoa, lions aren't meant for cages
Let me live my life

They say I've gone crazy
They say I've gone downhill
I'm still the same, baby
But I'm just way more real
Real

I don't live for you, I live for me
Can't shut me up, you'll hear me scream (hear me scream)
Whoa, lions aren't meant for cages
Let me live my life
Don't need approval, not from you
Don't need your take on what I do
Whoa, lions aren't meant for cages
Let me live my life
