		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In my room I hear you call my name
Your perfume inside my pillow case
I feel you and your fingers' trace
But I know you haven't been here in days

I have a video that I watch in my bed
It replays in my head

You say, you love me
We, we lay together every night
You touch me
I, I, I'm losing track of time
You kiss me
I, I, I look into your eyes

But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind

Honestly, I only think of you, see your face
Alone in a crowded room, hallucinate
That is the one where you lay, but I know
You haven't been here in days

I have a video that I watch in my bed
It replays in my head

You say, you love me
We, we lay together every night
You touch me
I, I, I'm losing track of time
You kiss me
I, I, I look into your eyes

But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind

You say, you love me
We, we lay together every night
You touch me
I, I, I'm losing track of time
You kiss me
I, I, I look into your eyes

But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
But it's only in my mind
