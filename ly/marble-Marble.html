		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Silent like strangers
We're proud in torrid salty seas
We've passed the better waters
Where forgiveness is
I can't help myself
From stopping all these
Words from spilling out
And the bleached walls we've been living in
With our holy oath
Are falling down
It's like weight, weight on the water
Float, float like a marble
The evidence of broken beds
And weight that's placed on words that I have thrown
I can't string them together right
You won't look at me like you did before
Keep holding my head down
And i might learn to let it go
It's like weight, weight on the water
Float, float like a marble
Weight, weight on the water
Float, float like a marble
