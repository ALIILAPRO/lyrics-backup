		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A just the sweet sweet sensi
Yuh know
Yeh I, yeh I
Nah, nah, nah, nah, now (so wha?)

Finally the herbs come around
The high grade weh mi ah look for
Mi get it by the pound, yeah
Sweet sensi a come around
Mi ah take a likkle draw and pass it around, so
Finally the herbs come around
The high grade weh man ah look for
Mi stock it by the pound, yeah
When babylon a come around
Ask them, "Weh dem a go search for?"

Ever since the herbs slow down
Police and rude boy dem inna showdown
Them a search 'round the compound
Yuh kno, man a no weed clown
Find a likkle piece of land and a plant mi home grown, so
Tell the youth them nah fi take pill
Too much crack and cocaine a make the world a feel ill, yuh kno
Nuff ganja, nuff spliff a build
Only thing we ah mek man feel chill
Weh mi say

Finally the herbs come around
The high grade when mi ah look for
Mi get it by the pound, yeah
When Collie Budd come around
A pure ganja man tune
Just a lick from the sound, yeah
Finally the herbs come around
The high grade weh man a look for
Mi stock it by the pound yeah
When babylon a come around
Ask them, "W dem a go search for?"

There's nothing like the sweet sweet sensi
The first time mi tek a draw was in elementary
Reach high school and get the herb in plenty
Like Scare Dem dub for Soul Jah One or Lenky, yeah
Me stash box never empty
The fifty dollar bag, we call that half century
Mi start mi own herb documentary
Bermy man a call that film 4:20, yeah
Weh mi say?

Finally the herbs come around
The high grade weh mi ah look for
Mi get it by the pound, yeah
Sweet sensi a come around
Mi ah take a likkle draw and pass it go round, so
Finally the herbs come around
The high grade that man a look for
Mi stock it by the pound, yeah
When babylon a come around
Ask them, "Weh dem a guh search for?"

Nah, nah, nah, nah, now
Yeh I, yeh I
Nah, nah, now
Yo

When dem abguh realize?
Good works man a advertize
When dem abguh legalize?
The farmer man a beg a little bligh
When den a guh realize?
Government dem a terrorize
Corporation dem a capitalize
While the farmer man nuh beg a little bligh, ayy yo

Finally the herbs come around
The high grade weh mi ah look for
Mi get it by the pound, yeah
When Collie Budd come around
A pure ganja man tune
Just a lick from the sound, yeah

Finally the herbs come around
The high grade weh man ah look for
Mi stock it by the pound yeah
When babylon a come around
Ask them, "Weh dem a guh search for?"

Yeh I
Yeh I
Come around
