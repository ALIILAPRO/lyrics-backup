		  (What you, what you gon' do?)

Baby, if we only got tonight
Then I wanna spend it by your side
If you wanna give love one last try
Just put your hand on your heart and whistle

Baby, if we only got tonight
Then I wanna spend it by your side
If you wanna give love one last try (try, try)
Just put your hand on your heart and whistle
And I'll come back to you

Whistle
Whistle
Just put your hand on your heart and whistle

Make it right, can I change your mind?
I'll do anything, give me one more try
I'll be there if you want me to
Give me one last chance to be there for you

Baby, if we only got tonight (tonight)
Then I wanna spend it by your side (by your side)
If you wanna give love one last try
Just put your hand on your heart and whistle
And I'll come back to you

Whistle
Whistle
Just put your hand on your heart and whistle
And I'll come back to you (just put your hand on your)
Hand on your heart, hand on your heart (whistle)
Hand on your, hand on your heart
Hand on your heart (whistle)
Hand on your, hand on your heart
Hand on your heart
Just put your hand on your heart and whistle

If you call me up, now, now, I'm runnin' back to you
If you want me now, now, now, I'll be there for you
If you call me up, now, now, runnin' back to you
If you want me now, now, now, I'll be there for you

Whistle
Whistle
Whistle
Just put your hand on your heart and whistle

Baby, if we only got tonight (tonight)
Then I wanna spend it by your side (by your side)
If you wanna give love one last try (one last try)
Just put your hand on your heart and whistle
And I'll come back to you

(Put your hand on your, hand on your, hand on your heart)
Just put your hand on your heart and whistle
(Hand on your heart) whistle, oh-yeah
(Hand on your, hand on your, hand on your heart)
Just put your hand on your heart and whistle
And I'll come back to you
