		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's dark, and hell is hot

Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on, 'cause when it's on
You niggas know to be gone, every time, 'cause we don't play

"Who turned out the lights?" is what niggas be sayin'
Now you don't wanna fight, but y'all niggas be playin'
Thinkin' it's alright, keep playin' with that role
And you gonna know the night when you layin' in that hole
Dirt gettin' tossed in your grave, now it's all over
Preacher said you was brave, but now it's all over
You just one of the many plenty I done gave it to
Ain't no savin' you
No matter how many tears your moms cried
Ain't gon' bring your ass back, plus in hell you gon' fry
Why? But now the only two relative questions
Is "do we bury him or burn him? Any suggestions?"
Either way, you up out of here for good
Now when niggas mention your name, they knockin' on wood (aight)
Did I get my point across?
Another body on the shottie, another joint I toss

Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on, 'cause when it's on
You niggas know to be gone every time, 'cause we don't play

Every time, 'cause we don't play
Every time, 'cause we don't play

It ain't no sunshine when the dark man comes out
And I want mine, so I plan to keep my gun out
We got four nines, so niggas run in and run out
But I bust mine, 'cause I'd like to hear some shouts
Get at me dog, niggas know how it's goin' dizzy
When it comes to that flow, I gets busy
Who is he? Dark man of the unknown (rrr, arf)
One dog, one bone
Now who ain't goin' home? Looks like you
You hit strike one, talkin' shit, strike two
Won't be a strike three, 'cause I don't play fair
I'ma look you in your eye while he hit you from the rear
Be like, yeah, holdin' you up 'cause you fallin' (what?)
The Lord ain't comin', so nigga, stop callin'
You was ballin' a minute ago, in it for dough
'Til it was, "yo, I swear to God, I didn't know"

Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on, 'cause when it's on
You niggas know to be gone, every time, 'cause we don't play

Every time, 'cause we don't play
Every time, 'cause we don't play

And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
What you think you gon' get, fuck around with my dough
Just so it ain't no mistakes, this is my show
One (one) two (two) three, here I go
Your shit is quick, and your shit is slick, but this shit is thick
Ain't you hear this shit? Damn right, I can finish shit
If you caught that verse without a rewind, you can see mine
But you'd be blind, I'll do it 360 and come up from behind
Tap you on your shoulder, have you turnin' around
Hit you with somethin' that'll have you burnin' the ground
Be like, "damn, ain't nothin' left of money but a pile of ash"
Life is good, so please enjoy it while it lasts
'Cause you know ain't got much longer to go
The quicker you go depends on the stronger the flow
Well, niggas know, I don't give a fuck, right or wrong
But ain't no sunshine when it's on

Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on, 'cause when it's on
You niggas know to be gone every time, 'cause we don't play

Every time, 'cause we don't play
Every time, 'cause we don't play
