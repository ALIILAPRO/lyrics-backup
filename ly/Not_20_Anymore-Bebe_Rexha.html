		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No, I'm not twenty anymore
Don't try to make me feel insecure
'Cause if one thing's for sure
I don't wanna be

I feel so good in my skin (skin)
Should I let you go or should I let you in?
Oh, baby, don't need no one to show me what to do, yeah

Beauty's more than a number
When I was younger, I didn't know that
And if you gave me the chance, I wouldn't go back (back, back)

No, I'm not twenty anymore (twenty anymore)
Don't try to make me feel insecure
'Cause I'm aging like wine
I get better with time, yes, I do (yes, I do)
And, oh, I'm not twenty anymore (twenty anymore)
The lines on my face, they weren't there before
But I'm wiser, I'm stronger 
From all of the life I've been through (I've been through)
Oh, and if one thing's for sure
I don't wanna be twenty anymore

Why lie 'bout how old I am? (I am, am)
When I'm a better lover than I was in 2010?
Oh, baby, let me show you all the things my body do, yeah

Beauty's more than a number
When I was younger, I wish I knew that
And now, I'm not afraid, won't hold myself back (back, back)

No, I'm not twenty anymore (twenty anymore)
Don't try to make me feel insecure
'Cause I'm aging like wine
I get better with time, yes, I do (yes, I do)
And, oh, I'm not twenty anymore (twenty anymore)
The lines on my face, they weren't there before
But I'm wiser, I'm stronger 
From all of the life I've been through (I've been through)
Oh, and if one thing's for sure
I don't want to be twenty anymore

Oh, ah, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
