		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She was a ballerina on a subway train
Stiletto heels and a candy cane
Looked like a number on a station wall
Hot on the tail of a social call
I wet my lips I thought I had it made
Like Valentino with a hand grenade
I made my move with my libido on
And she circled once, then she dropped the bomb

She got the big guns, pointed at my heart
Bang, bang, shooting like a firing squad
Big guns, she blew me away
And I went down in flames

I met a sidewalk preacher on a roller skate
He said he had the key to heaven's gate
Wait for the movie 'cause I been there before
I learned that life is a battle and love is war

She got the big guns, pointed at my heart
Bang, bang, shooting like a firing squad
Big guns, it took me by surprise
She got my lovin' reachin' for the sky

She got the big guns, pointed at my heart
Bang, bang, shooting like a firing squad
Big guns, she blew me away
And I went down in flames

I'm doing time as a backseat Romeo
Play solitaire with my hands in the air
Another night and no bullets to spare

She got the big guns, pointed at my heart
Bang, bang, shooting like a firing squad
Big guns, she blew me away
And I went down, down, down in flames
Big guns (big guns)
Look at me, I'm big guns (big guns)
Yeah (big guns)
Big guns
She really, really got the big guns
She shot me, and I went down in flames
