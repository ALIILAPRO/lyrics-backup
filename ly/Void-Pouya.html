		  MTM, hit 'em with the heat!

Alive, but not living
I'm tryna get with it
The size of my dick is not rising
I'm thinking of finding new women
The void that I'm fillin'
That gaps that I'm bridgin'
The pistol I'm gripping
Got me thinking 'bout the old times (old times)
How many rappers need a cosign (cosign)
24/7 I was always on the frontline
Underground underdog cannot be confined
Alive but not living
I'm tryna get with it
The size of my dick is not rising
I'm thinking of finding new women
The void that I'm fillin'
That gaps that I'm bridgin'
The pistol I'm gripping
Got me thinking 'bout the old times (old times)
How many rappers need a cosign (cosign)
24/7 I was always on the frontline
Underground underdog cannot be confined

Sit back, relax in the black Cadillac
On them 22s screaming, "Fuck you," out the window
To the people I don't fuck with
The same hoes I grew up with
That never wanted to suck dick
Now they want me To cuff 'em
Stuff 'em with a combustion
Back in the day, hoe, you was so reluctant
Now you looking at me like you looking at your husband, yeah
Why you switching up? You said you was never the one for me
Had me running in circles and chasing the cat
I see how the tables have turned, now I got that cat on my lap
Hate me love me don't say you know me
The money make me feel less lonely
The women make me feel so phony
My own homies wanna buss my dome piece

Alive, but not living
I'm tryna get with it
The size of my dick is not rising
I'm thinking of finding new women
The void that I'm fillin'
That gaps that I'm bridgin'
The pistol I'm gripping
Got me thinking 'bout the old times (old times)
How many rappers need a cosign (cosign)
24/7 I was always on the frontline
Underground underdog cannot be confined
Alive but not living
I'm tryna get with it
The size of my dick is not rising
I'm thinking of finding new women
The void that I'm fillin'
That gaps that I'm bridgin'
The pistol I'm gripping
Got me thinking 'bout the old times (old times)
How many rappers need a cosign (cosign)
24/7 I was always on the frontline
Underground underdog cannot be confined

I know you maintaining baby
You run around and drive me crazy
Late night you my chelsea lately
Never will I bend, never will you break me
And the Smith and Wesson always stainless
One shot and I'll fall to pavement
Let my brain fall flat by the bay side
Homicide won't find me til the daylight
When the right time comes, grab me from behind
I hope I fucking struggle while you sucking out the life from me
Is this what you wanted when I'm finally gone from this moment
Will you become proud of me?

'Cause I can't be myself if you don't want me to be
And I can't stand myself if you can't understand me

Alive, but not living
I'm tryna get with it
The size of my dick is not rising
I'm thinking of finding new women
The void that I'm fillin'
That gaps that I'm bridgin'
The pistol I'm gripping
Got me thinking 'bout the old times (old times)
How many rappers need a cosign (cosign)
24/7 I was always on the frontline
Underground underdog cannot be confined
Alive but not living
I'm tryna get with it
The size of my dick is not rising
I'm thinking of finding new women
The void that I'm fillin'
That gaps that I'm bridgin'
The pistol I'm gripping
Got me thinking 'bout the old times (old times)
How many rappers need a cosign (cosign)
24/7 I was always on the frontline
Underground underdog cannot be confined (bitch)
