		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I used to love these sheets
Dark hair against the white
I missed watching you get dressed in our hazy bedroom light
It took a couple weeks
Last night I finally cried
I remembered us in London, your chocolate covered eyes

Sick of staring up at the ceiling
How'd you change your mind just like that?
The only way to get past this feeling
Is to tell myself you're not coming back

I don't wanna love you anymore
I don't wanna love you anymore
From the start, I never thought, I'd say this before
But I don't wanna love you anymore

You got that letter framed
Is it still up on that shelf?
It's the one I left on our bed
When you were out of town

Sick of staring up at the ceiling
How'd you change your mind just like that?
The only way to get past this feeling
Is to tell myself you're not coming back

I don't wanna love you anymore
I don't wanna love you anymore
From the start, I never thought, I'd say this before
But I don't wanna love you anymore
I don't wanna love you anymore
I don't wanna love you anymore
I can't forget, the way it felt, when you walked out the door
So I don't wanna love you anymore

Sometimes I just wanna talk for a minute
But I can't bring myself to call
Because I know that your heart's not really in it
And whatever we had is gone
Sometimes I just wanna talk for a minute
But I can't bring myself to call
Because I know that your heart's not really in it
And whatever we had is gone

I don't wanna love you anymore
I don't wanna love you anymore
From the start, I never thought, I'd say this before
But I don't wanna love you anymore
I don't wanna love you anymore (talk for a minute)
I don't wanna love you anymore
I can't forget, the way it felt, when you walked out the door
So I don't wanna love you anymore
