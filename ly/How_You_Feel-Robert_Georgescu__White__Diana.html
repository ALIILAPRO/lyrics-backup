		<p>
		  Show me what you feel
Tell me what you need
Show me how you feel

Show me what you feel
Tell me what you need
Show me how you feel
Tell me, tell me
"It's not a lonely way to live"

It's not a lonely way to live

Show me what you feel
Tell me what you need
Show me how you feel (yeah)
Tell me, tell me
"It's not a lonely way to live"

Doesn't feel so real
Tell me, tell me

Show me what you feel
(Show me what you feel)
Tell me what you need
(Tell me what you need)
Show me how you feel
Doesn't feel so real
Show me how you feel
It's not a lonely way to live

Show me what you feel
Tell me what you need

Show me how you feel
Doesn't feel so real
Show me how you feel
It's not a lonely way to live

It's not a lonely way to live

Doesn't feel so real
It's not a lonely way to live
