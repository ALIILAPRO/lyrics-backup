		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Three sides to the story
Yours and mine and the goddamn truth, girl
Two lies that you told me
Say you love me then you hate me, I don't know what to do, girl
One thing's for sure
You can back that ass up and, baby, I want more
But I need to know
Can you make me a promise to always be honest?

Fucked up, you put my heart in a headlock
Usually it's me that only wanna make the bed rock
Stuck up like a robbery with red dots
Really no surprise you tellin' lies to make my head hot

You know what they say
Every dog has his day
Every bitch wanna play with me
You should be ashamed
'Cause I would feel the same
If I did what you did to me

Three sides to the story
Yours and mine and the goddamn truth, girl
Two lies that you told me
Say you love me then you hate me, I don't know what to do, girl
One thing's for sure
You can back that ass up and, baby, I want more
But I need to know
Can you make me a promise to always be honest?

Started with a kiss
Ended with a dub
Better if you leave 'cause I feel better when you gone
Diamonds on my wrist
Feelings getting numb
Thought you knew it all so, baby, why you playing dumb?

You know what they say
Every dog has his day
Every bitch wanna play with me
You should be ashamed
'Cause I would feel the same
If I did what you did to me

Three sides to the story
Yours and mine and the goddamn truth, girl
Two lies that you told me
Say you love me then you hate me, I don't know what to do, girl
One thing's for sure
You can back that ass up and, baby, I want more
But I need to know
Can you make me a promise to always be honest?
