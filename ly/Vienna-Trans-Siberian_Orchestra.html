		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Since I was a child
I've seen her in a dream
A captured fairy tale
That echoes cross my life

And though I've courted her
She's always stayed unseen
Now all at once she
Glitters in the night

But that was yesterday
And that all was before
When she was far away
A silhouette of dreams

But others whispered
That she was so much more
And suddenly I now
Know what they mean

Dreams change
Years strain
Lost illusions
Last stands
God's hand
Absolution
Found

Fairy tale sins
Visions by grimm
All forgiven
Lives spent in vain
Never reclaimed
Take their final bows

Pictures and words
Visions absurd
Maddened poets
All within sight

Failures in life
Who'll never know it
Lazarus cries
There in his eyes

Hope has risen
Depth and facade
All before me now
