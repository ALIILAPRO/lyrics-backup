		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sitting, looking up from the bottom
Wishing I had their pretty problems
I try to give a smile but I got none
I got none, got none

Hope my eyes don't open after I lay down to sleep
Praying to a god that has never shown up for me

Another day of play pretend, I'm stumblin, Ah
I toss and turn, on red alert, I watch it burn
They tell me I should end it

Evil whispers in my mi-i-ind
Promisin a paradi-i-ise
Away from all the sounds
Six feet underground
I'm falling for their lies so

Promising me peace of mind
Maybe I should
Take me to a paradise
Maybe I should
Promising me peace of mind
Maybe I should, Maybe I should
Maybe I should end it

I can bare my teeth when I need to
You have taught me not to need you, I
Hate that in me I can see you
Don't wanna see you, see you, I'm

Carving you out of my veins to save a part of me
Cursing out a god that I now know to not believe

Another day of play pretend, I'm stumblin, Ah
I toss and turn, on red alert, I watch it burn
They tell me I should end it

Evil whispers in my mi-i-ind
Promisin a paradi-i-ise
Away from all the sounds
Six feet underground
I'm falling for their lies so

Promising me peace of mind
Maybe I should
Take me to a paradise
Maybe I should
Promising me peace of mind
Maybe I should, Maybe I should
Maybe I should end it

Now I lay me down, lay me down to sleep
I pray to thee, pray my soul to keep
If I should die, die before I wake
I pray to thee, pray my soul to take

Now I lay me down, lay me down to sleep
I pray to thee, pray my soul to keep
If I should live, live another day
My demons say
Maybe I should end it

Evil whispers in my mi-i-ind
Promisin a paradi-i-ise
Away, from all the sounds
Six feet underground
I'm falling for their lies so

Promising me peace of mind
Maybe I should
Take me to a paradise
Maybe I should
Promising me peace of mind
Maybe I should, Maybe I should
Maybe I should end it
