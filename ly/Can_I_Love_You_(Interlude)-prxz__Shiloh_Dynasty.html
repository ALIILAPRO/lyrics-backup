		<p>
		  Can I, can I, can I
Love you the way I want to?
Can I, can I, can I
Love you the way I want to?

Hello? Hey, yeah, I know
I've been meaning to call but
I've met someone else and
I, I love him goodbye

Can I, can I, can I
Love you the way I want to?
Can I, can I, can I, love you, love you?
Can I, can I, can I
Love you the way I want to?
Can I, can I, can I, love you, love you?
(Goodbye) can I, can I, can I
Love you the way I want to?
Can I, can I, can I, love you, love you?
Can I, can I, can I
Love you the way I want to?
Can I, can I, can I, love you, love you?
(Goodbye) can I, can I, can I
Love you the way I want to?
Can I, can I, can I, love you, love you?
Can I, can I, can I
Love you the way I want to?
Can I, can I, can I, love you, love you?
Can I, can I, can I
Love you the way I want to?
Can I, can I, can I, love you, love you?
Can I, can I, can I
Love you the way I want to?
Can I, can I, can I, love you, love you?
Can I, can I, can I
Love you the way I want to?
Can I, can I, can I, love you, love you?
Can I, can I, can I
Love you the way I want to?
Can I, can I, can I, love you, love you?
