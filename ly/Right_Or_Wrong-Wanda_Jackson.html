		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Right or wrong I'll be with you
I'll do what you ask me to
For I believe that I belong
By your side, right or wrong

Right or wrong it's got to be
Always you, always me
Won't you take me along
To be with you right or wrong?

If it's right for me to love you
It can't be wrong for me to care
If you will say you love me
My life with you I'll share

Right or wrong, day by day
All my love, all the way
For I believe that I belong
By your side, right or wrong

If it's right for me to love you
It can't be wrong for me to care
If you will say you love me
My life with you I'll share

Right or wrong, day by day
All my love, all the way
For I believe that I belong
By your side, right or wrong
