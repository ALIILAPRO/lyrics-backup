		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't want to close the door
Don't want to give up on it
Don't want to fight no more
We'll find a way around it
Where's the love we had
We can make it last

Tell me what I gotta be
Tell me what you want to do
'Cause I can't live my life
The way you want me to
You know I can't go on
Livin' like we do
Do I have to cry for you
Do I have to cry for you

So tell me what it's for
If there's no winner in it
Nobody's keepin' score
Let's start from the beginning
Can we make it last?
With the love we had

Tell me what I gotta be
Tell me what you want to do
'Cause I can't live my life
The way you want me to
You know I can't go on
Livin' like we do
Do I have to cry for you
Do I have to cry for you

Do I gotta stand in the cold dark night till the morning light, yeah
Do I have to say 'I won't let you get away'

What do I gotta be?
Tell me what you want to do?
I can't live my life, the way you want me to
You know I can't go on, living like we do?
Do I have to cry for you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah hold on
You know I can't go on, living like we do
Do I have to cry for you?
Do I have to cry for you?
