		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wide eyed
I'm terrified
I tell myself I'm fine

I turned all the mirrors around
Is this the ceiling or the floor?
I feel all the walls surround me
Get out, you're not welcome no more

I need you to give back my mind
You know it's not yours anymore
You keep playing tricks on my eyes
Now I'm ready to settle the score

Wide eyed
I'm terrified
I tell myself I'm fine
Do you trust me
Or do you think I'm out of my mind?

Where can I go?
I think I lost control
As above, so below
Where can I go?
Who the hell is in control?
As above, so below

You said my grip is slipping
But how can I lose
Something that was never mine
If I keep sipping on your poison
Then I'll keep on believing your lies

Wide eyed
I'm terrified
I tell myself I'm fine
Do you trust me
Or do you think I'm out of my mind?

Where can I go?
I think I lost control
As above, so below
Where can I go?
Who the hell is in control?
As above, so below

Get out of my head and leave me alone
I'm not myself and now everyone knows
Hear all my thoughts echo again
Feeling my body start to ascend
Left all alone in my personal hell
Just leave me here, and save yourself
