		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wake up
And the day feels broken
I tilt my head
I'm trying to get an angle

'Cause the evening
I've always longed for
It could still happen

How do I master
The perfect day
Six glasses of water
Seven phone calls

If you leave it alone
It might just happen
Anyway

It's not up to you
Oh, it never really was
It's not up to you
Oh, it never really was
It's not up to you
Well, it never really was
It's not up to you

If you wake up
And the day feels a-broken
Just lean into the crack
And it will tremble ever so nicely
Notice
How it sparkles
Down there

I can decide what I give
But it's not up to me
What I get given

Unthinkable surprises
About to happen
But what they are

It's not up to you
Well, it never really was
It's not up to you
Oh, it never really was
It's not up to you
Oh, it never really was
It's not up to you
It's not up to you
It's not up to you
It's not up to you
It's not up to you

There is too much
Clinging
To peak
There is too much
Pressure
