		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’m asking you to stay, 
between all these whispers that wont go away, 
it’s been a while since you and i woke up, 
we drift in and out, we’re up and down on luck. 
 
I’ll look the other way, 
i won’t be tempted by people that lead me astray, 
cos its been a while since you and i woke up. 
Do i settle down and shut you out for good? 
 
I’m asking you to stay, stay please babe. 
I’m just asking you to stay. 
 
I’m asking you to wait, 
Between all the secrets that won’t go away, 
cos its been a while since you and i woke up, 
do we fall in love and fuck it up for good? 
 
I’m asking you to stay. 
Stay please babe.
