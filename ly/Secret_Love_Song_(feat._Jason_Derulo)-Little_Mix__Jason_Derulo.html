		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you hold me in the street and you kiss me on the dance floor
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't it be like that?
'Cause I'm yours

We keep behind closed doors
Every time I see you, I die a little more
Stolen moments that we steal as the curtain falls
It'll never be enough
It's obvious you're meant for me
Every piece of you, it just fits perfectly
Every second, every thought, I'm in so deep
But I'll never show it on my face

But we know this, we got a love that is hopeless

Why can't you hold me in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't we be like that?
'Cause I'm yours

When you're with him, do you call his name
Like you do when you're with me? Does it feel the same?
Would you leave if I was ready to settle down?
Or would you play it safe and stay?

Girl, you know this, we got a love that is hopeless

Why can't you hold me in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor? (I wish)
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't we be like that?
'Cause I'm yours

And nobody knows I'm in love with someone's baby
I don't wanna hide us away
Tell the world about the love we making
I'm living for that day
Someday

Why can't I hold you in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that we could be like that
Why can't we be like that?
'Cause I'm yours, I'm yours

Oh, why can't you hold me in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that it could be like that (I wish)
Why can't it be like that? (I wish)
'Cause I'm yours ('cause I'm yours)
Why can't I say that I'm in love?
I wanna shout it from the rooftops
I wish that it could be like that (I wish)
Why can't we be like that?
'Cause I'm yours

Why can't we be like that?
Wish we could be like that
