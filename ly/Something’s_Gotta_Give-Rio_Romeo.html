		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something's gotta give
Something's gotta give
Something's gotta give

When an irresistible force such as you
Meets an old immovable object like me
You can bet as sure as you live
Something's gotta give
Something's gotta give
Something's gotta give

When an irrepressible smile such as yours
Warms an old implacable heart such as mine
Don't say no because I insist
Somewhere, somehow
Someone's gonna be kissed

So en garde
Who knows what the fates have in store
From their vast mysterious sky
I'll try hard ignoring those lips I adore
But how long can anyone try?

Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight it with all of our might
Chances are some heavenly star spangled night
We'll find out as sure as we live
Something's gotta give, something's gotta give
Something's gotta give

Fight, fight, fight it with all of our might
Chances are some heavenly star spangled night
We'll find out as sure as we live
Something's gotta give, something's gotta give
Something's gotta give
Something's gotta, oh, something's gotta give
