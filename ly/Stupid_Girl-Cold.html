		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Want to love ya
Want to bug ya
Want to squeeze ya
Stupid girl

Want to touch ya
Want to take ya
Want to shut ya
Stupid girl

I can't take this
Born to break this

She's going away, she's going away
What's wrong with my life today?
She's going away, she's going away
What's wrong with my life today?

Stupid girl, stupid girl

I'm a loner, I'm a loser
I'm a winner, in my mind

I'm a bad one, I'm a good one
I'm a sick one with a smile

I can't take this
Born to break this

She's going away, she's going away
What's wrong with my life today?
She's going away, she's going away
What's wrong with my life today?
What's wrong with my life today?

She's going away, she's going away
What's wrong with my life today?

Stupid girl, stupid girl
Stupid girl, stupid girl

She's going away, she's going away
What's wrong with my life today?
She's going away, she's going away
What's wrong with my life today?
What's wrong with my life today?

She's going away, she's going away
What's wrong with my life today?

Stupid girl, stupid girl
Stupid girl, stupid girl
