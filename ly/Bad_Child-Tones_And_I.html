		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My family always said I was the bad child
Throwin' me away into the bad pile
All my life been puttin' on a fake smile
Sittin' on my own, feel like I'm exiled
Feelin' like I always do the wrong things
Tellin' all their friends that I'm the bad kid
Now I'm on my own, I lost my magic
Dealin' with your bullshit now I'm over it

And you took a part of me
Left me with the memories, oh
We were never a family
Now you're standin' in front of my door-or-or
Like none of this happened at all-all-all

I guess I'm always gonna be the bad child
I guess I'm always gonna be the mad child
'Cause you will never understand my weird mind
My weird mind
And to every single person here that doubts me
Tellin' me that they could live without me
'Cause they will never understand my weird mind
My weird mind

I've never really been the one to reach out
Actin' like my life was squeaky clean now
Like everythin' I do is just a letdown
Feelin' like I always do the wrong things
Tellin' all their friends that I'm the bad kid
Now I'm on my own, I lost my magic
Dealin' with your bullshit now I'm over it

And you took a part of me
Left me with the memories, oh
We were never a family
Now you're standin' in front of my door-or-or
Like none of this happened at all-all-all

I guess I'm always gonna be the bad child
I guess I'm always gonna be the mad child
'Cause you will never understand my weird mind
My weird mind
And to every single person here that doubts me
Tellin' me that they could live without me
'Cause they will never understand my weird mind
My weird mind

They say I've lost my mind
They I'll never find it
I think they're kind of right
In fact, I kind of like it
They say I've lost my mind
They I'll never find it
I think they're kind of right

I guess I'm always gonna be the bad child
I guess I'm always gonna be the mad child
'Cause you will never understand my weird mind
My weird mind
And to every single person here that doubts me
Tellin' me that they could live without me
'Cause they will never understand my weird mind
My weird mind

My family always said I was the bad child
