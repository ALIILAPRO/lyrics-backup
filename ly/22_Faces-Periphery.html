		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Staring at the hourglass, my life, it feels like a machine
Running with no direction
Watching time as it draws a perception obscene,
From a resurrection
Choking on reality, the walls of my insides, they bleed
From the excess incisions
Drawn and quartered by the monster who pulls on the strings
From the core of me

Whoa, yeah I'm dying to see,
What it is that is eating away at me
Now the stars are deciding my world,
They burn from the inside out

Lies told and the flames burning all around
So blind to the beauty, you slave
But it feels like the walls are melting, facing into me
Have I lost track of time?
Yeah!
Why can't I feel the burn?

Staring at the hourglass, my life, it feels like a machine
Running with no direction
Drawn and quartered by the monster who pulls on the strings
In my resurrection

(Yeah!) Whoa, yeah I'm dying to see,
What it is that is eating away at me
Now the stars are deciding my world,
They burn from the inside out
Whoa, yeah I'm dying to see,
What it is that is eating away at me
Now the stars are deciding my world,
They burn from the inside out (inside out)

When the frustration makes a move,
The second hand will swallow you
Tearing a hole inside,
I'll bury your life

The smell of flesh is seeping into my rage,
Thrashing open for a better way
The push, the pull,
It's tearing apart my will to thrive in the day
Pins and needles jabbing into my veins,
On the verge of losing sanity,
The beast tears and I can't do a thing about it

Whoa, yeah I'm dying to see,
What it is that is eating away at me,
Now the stars are deciding my world,
They burn from the inside out
Fuck me I am dying for sleep,
What exactly is eating away at me?
Now the stars are deciding my world,
They burn from the inside out
