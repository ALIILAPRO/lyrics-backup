		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Away she goes dancing 
In her red and green bow . 
It always stops my heart .
Like reindeer she's prancing in white winter snow 
It always stops my heart 
We're moving further apart . 

Is she getting me a paperback book 
On how to have a better outlook and ways for moving on from the part of me that she took ? 

I wonder if she really knows just what I want for Christmas. 
If she does will it scare her off ?
If she runs away this year just like before she'll miss us . 
The girl who stole my heart . 

I told Santa I need you I guess Santa forgot .
I'll just sit here waiting with all these gifts for you I bought .
A boy can keep dreaming like Christmas lights gleaming . 
But this year has meaning cus you're all I want . 

Is she getting me a paperback book 
On how to have a better outlook and  ways for moving on from the part of me that she took ?  

I wonder if she really knows just what I want for Christmas. 
If she does will it scare her off ?
If she runs away this year just like before she'll miss us . 
The girl who stole my heart . 

I wonder if she really knows just what I want for Christmas. 
If she does will it scare her off ?
If she runs away this year just like before she'll miss us . 
The girl who stole my heart . 

All I want 
All I want 
Let me be the one 
Let me be the one 
To hold you and never run 

All I want 
All I want 
Let me be the one 
Let me be the one 
To hold you and never run 

I wonder if she really knows just what I want for Christmas. 
If she does will it scare her off ?
If she runs away this year just like before she'll miss us . 
The girl who stole my heart . 

I wonder if she really knows just what I want for Christmas. 
If she does will it scare her off ?
If she runs away this year just like before she'll miss us . 
The girl who stole my heart .
