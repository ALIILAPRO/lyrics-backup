		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your heart was black and blue
The night I jumped into you
I nursed you to health, I wanted to help
But broke myself fixing you

Two sides to every story
One part that you left out
You gave me all your hurting
And all your love to someone else

'Cause I found you low with your face in the dirt
And, darling, I swore I'd be there at your worst
Now you're moving on and the tables have turned
And I'm just as broken as you were at first
So when was the moment that the roles reversed?
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh) so when was the moment that the roles

Changed almost overnight
Oh, what made you change your mind?
Do you kiss her lips
To help you forget
That I brought you back to life?

Two sides to every story
One part that you left out
You gave me all your hurting
And all your love to someone else

'Cause I found you low with your face in the dirt
And, darling, I swore I'd be there at your worst
Now you're moving on and the tables have turned
And I'm just as broken as you were at first
So when was the moment that the roles reversed?
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh) so when was the moment that the roles reversed?

You got her and I got hurt
Don't forget who loved you first
You start fires and let them burn
Don't forget who loved you first

'Cause I found you low with your face in the dirt (oh)
And, darling, I swore I'd be there at your worst
Now you're moving on and the tables have turned
And I'm just as broken as you were at first
So when was the moment that the roles reversed?
(Ooh) oh, the roles reversed
(Ooh) ooh
(Ooh) so when was the moment that the roles
