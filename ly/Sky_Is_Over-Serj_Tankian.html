		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh (ooh)

Everybody knows
Everybody knows
That you cradle the sun, sun
(There's not life again)
Living in remorse
Sky is over

Don't you want to hold me, baby?
Disappointed, going crazy

Even though we can't afford
The sky is over
Even though we can't afford
The sky is over
I don't want to see you go
The sky is over
Even though we can't afford
The sky is over

Behind closed eyes lie
The mind's ready to awaken you
Are you at war with land
And all of its creatures?
Your not-so-gentle persuasion
Has been known to wreck economies
Of countries, of empires, the sky is over

Don't you want to hold me, baby?
Disappointed, going crazy

La, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

Not even from the sun
(La, la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
(La-la-la-la-la-la)
Not even from the sun
(La, la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
(La-la-la-la-la-la)
Not even from the sun
Don't you want me to run?

Even though we can't afford
The sky is over
Even though we can't afford
The sky is over
I don't want to see you go
The sky is over
Even though we can't afford
The sky is over
Even though we can't afford
The sky is over
Even though we can't afford
The sky is over
I don't want to see you go
The sky is over
Even though we can't afford
The sky is over

The sky is over us
