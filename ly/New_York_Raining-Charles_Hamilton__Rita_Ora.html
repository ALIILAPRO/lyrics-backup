		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Miles from home, my style has grown
Sick of getting played like a xylophone
My instrument is me with thousands of bones
Wilin', I just wanna zone
My mama knows
I need a chick to be kinda dope
Smile a lot, give a lot of (dome)
Only to me, spoil me with your bad (ass)
You're like royalty, baby, catch that
See the rain is makin' me feel painless
This relationship is so dangerous
If they find out, what will they make of it
So I say that every kiss like a sanction
You ain't missin' a thing
With other niggas who sing
I need cash just to give you a ring
Love at first sight, but it was blocked by pain
So for you, I'll exceed the top 5 in the game

In the city lights
I swear I hear you call my name (call my name)
There's nothing right
I'm stuck here while you're miles away (miles away)
In New York raining
In New York raining
It's too much my babe I need you
It's too much my babe I need you

Red wine and cheese before bed time
You and I fell in love is the headline
Instead of whinin' about what I've been findin'
I stay silent and let you chime in
You want me to talk?, fine then
Someone broke your heart?
Let me find them
But I hate fights and now I got stage fright
Until I'm at your place at the late night
You make me smile, stop doing that
A lot is on my mind when I rap, in fact
You are a lot, I guess I rap for you
Needless to say, the (sex) is magical
After you, chivalry I have to do
I love it when you catch an attitude
I want to tease you just to laugh at you
So that make up (sex) could be a faster move
C'mon!

In the city lights
I swear I hear you call my name (call my name)
There's nothing right
I'm stuck here while you're miles away (miles away)
In New York raining
In New York raining
It's too much my babe I need you
It's too much my babe I need you

When the rain falls down, the pain is all out
My brain, you call out my name and that's fame
I'm looking great but I still feel shame
For real it's the game
I feel insane
But when I'm with you, my feelings change
I love you, I really hope you feel the same
You know what I am, you're holdin' my hand
No one else can so I'm your man
Your palm reads bliss
What are we miss?
You are what I miss and we all need this
Love and affection is all we miss
From the world but with each other
That's all we get
I wanna hear you out, talk to me, miss
I hardly wanna slip the awesomest kiss
Call me whenever, call me forever
As long as I can call us together
I love you

In the city lights
I swear I hear you call my name (call my name)
There's nothing right
I'm stuck here while you're miles away (miles away)
In New York raining
In New York raining there's too much
My babe, I need you
There's too much, my babe I need you
