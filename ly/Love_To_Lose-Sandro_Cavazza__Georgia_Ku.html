		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some days I really wanna hate you
'Cause you always know just what to say
By now I know the words to break you
And you know what breaks me too

When things get heated
We say things we don't mean and
Though we know they ain't true
Say you're leaving
Get careless with our feelings
What's the worst we can do?

I didn't tell you all my secrets just to pull my heart out
I didn't take you to my family just to show you the house
I didn't work this hard to get this far then leave it so soon
I didn't love to lose somebody like you
(Love to lose somebody like you)

Some nights we're closer than ever
Sometimes we're running out of space
When we're high it can't get any better
Until we come down again

Things get heated
We say things we don't mean and
Though we know they ain't true
Say you're leaving
Get careless with our feelings
What's the worst we can do?

I didn't tell you all my secrets just to pull my heart out
I didn't take you to my family just to show you the house
I didn't work this hard to get this far then leave it so soon
I didn't love to lose somebody like you
Somebody like you

(Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh)
Somebody like you
(Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh)

Things get heated
We say things we don't mean and
Though we know they ain't true

I didn't tell you all my secrets just to pull my heart out
I didn't take you to my family just to show you the house
I didn't work this hard to get this far then leave it so soon
I didn't love to lose somebody like you
Somebody like you

(Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh)
Somebody, somebody like you
(Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh)
Somebody like you
(Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh) 
Somebody, somebody like you

I didn't love to lose somebody like you
Somebody like you
