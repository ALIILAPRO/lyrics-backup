		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  'Twas a long time ago,
Longer now than it seems
In a place that perhaps
You've seen in your dreams
For the story that you are about to be told
Began with the holiday worlds of old
Now, you've probably wondered
Where holidays come from.
If you haven't I'd say
It's time you begun.
For the holidays are the result of much fuss
And hard work from the worlds that create them us
Well you see now, quite simply
That's all that they do,
Making one unique holiday
Especially for you
But once, a calamity ever so great
Occured when two holidays met by mistake
