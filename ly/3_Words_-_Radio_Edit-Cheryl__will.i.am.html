		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I met a guy at the club,
I let him know I'm in love,

I met a girl at the bar,
I let her know who you are.

I told her you are the love of my life and,
One day your gonna be my wife.
And we are gonna have some babies together.

I told him you are the man of my dreams,
You saved me from drowning in the streams
And I know were really gonna last forever. (and ever)

It was those 3 words that saved my life.
It wasn't complicated, wasn't premeditated.
It wasn't under-rated, boy I'm so glad you stayed and

It was those 3 words that saved my life.
It wasn't complicated, wasn't premeditated.
To you I'm dedicated.
Lets go ahead and say it

I love you
I love you
I love you
You are the love of my life (my life)

I love you
I love you
I love you
You are the love of my life (my life )

You know your holdin' my heart,
Can't nothing tear us apart.

You know I'm so in love with you,
Can't nothing tear us apart (OH)

I said I-L-O-V-E-Y-O-U I'm so into you girl,

I said M-E-T-O-O,
Its obvious I'm so into you boy,
So why don't we, (we)
Hold (hold) on (on) for the (love).

Through the ups and downs.
Never let go.
Holdin' on forever never let go.
And I'm so into it

There are 3 words that saved my life.
It wasn't complicated, It wasn't complicated, It wasn't complicated, It wasn't complicated

Baby its 3 words that saved my life

I love you
I love you
I love you
You are the love of my life (my life )

I love you
I love you
I love you
You are the love of my life (my life )
