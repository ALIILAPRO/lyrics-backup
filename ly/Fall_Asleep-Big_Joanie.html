		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I ever fall asleep now, would you
Wake me from the dream that's kept me
Crying now for weeks? That's kept me
Crying now for weeks?
If I ever fall asleep now, would you
Wake me from the dream that's left me
Shaking now for weeks? That's left me
Shaking now for weeks?

Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah

If I ever fall asleep now, would you
(I want to get down with you)
Wake me from the dream that's left me
(I want to get down with you)
Aching now for weeks, that's left me
(I want to get down with you)
Aching now for weeks (I want to)
If I ever fall asleep now, would you
(I want to get down with you)
Wake me from the dream that's kept me
(I want to get down with you)
Way down on my knees, that's kept me
(I want to get down with you)
Way down on my knees (I want to)

Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah

(I want to get down with you) I'm tired
(I want to get down with you)
Come and wake me up
(I want to get down with you) I'm tired
(I want to) Come and wake me up
(I want to get down with you) I'm tired
(I want to get down with you)
Come and wake me up
(I want to get down with you) I'm tired
(I want to) Come and wake me up
