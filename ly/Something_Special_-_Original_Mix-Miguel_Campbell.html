		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something special, sexy, wonderful
Something special, sexy, wonderful
Something special, sexy, wonderful
Something special, sexy, wonderful

Something special, sexy, wonderful
Something special, sexy, wonderful
Something special, sexy, wonderful
Something special, sexy, wonderful

Saw you standing there, I wanted you to be my baby
Saw you standing there, I can't believe the way you managed to phase me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
There's a look that's in your eyes,
Could only be described, so amazing
And a sweetness in your smile, could only be defined,
Something, special, sexy, wonderful

Something special, sexy, wonderful
Something special, sexy, wonderful
Something special, sexy, wonderful
Something special, sexy, wonderful

Something special, sexy, wonderful
Something special, sexy, wonderful
Something special, sexy, wonderful
Something special, sexy, wonderful

Something special, sexy, wonderful
Something special, sexy, wonderful
Something special, sexy, wonderful
Something special, sexy, wonderful

Saw you standing there, I wanted you to be my baby
Saw you standing there, I can't believe the way you managed to phase me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
There's a look that's in your eyes,
Could only be described, so amazing
(It's so amazing baby)
And a sweetness in your smile, could only be defined,
Something special, sexy, wonderful

Something special, sexy, wonderful
Something special, sexy, wonderful
Something special, sexy, wonderful
Something special, sexy, wonderful

Something special, sexy, wonderful (repeated)
