		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Believe the sea high waves upon our coming storm
Hear the roaring tide as we name a dawn
See the ice in which we craft our souls
Earth's frozen cries the dark benight your kind

Monstrously the seas rage afar as if to hide from that which nears
Skyward from the sea salt air our vision knew a giant fall
See the ice in which we craft our souls
Life's frozen cries the dark benight your kind

A place of utterness beyond the wilderness
Through a darkened terrain that fades in emptiness
Walkers of the dust survivors of the blast
Slowly they move but far behind all time into the solar fall

Believe the sea high waves upon our coming storm
Hear the roaring tide as we name a dawn
Monstrously the seas rage afar as if to hide from what which nears
Skyward from the sea salt air our vision knew a giant fall
See the ice in which we craft our souls
All frozen cries the dark benight your kind
The last sunset flame dust of ice drifts the earth
Lightning plays in depths of no rebirth
