		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dog day Tuesday
Hope that girl she come today
Hard life it's a city life
Sweat keep pourin' down
I've got my feet up like to love
Through the dawn till I've blown
All I want's her lovin' down
Love the way she move around
Need no excuse 
To let it all hang loose
My body's blown a fuse
Rising power
We'll raise the night
Rising power
Rising power
We'll wake the dead
Rising power

You've got a love life up all night
Darkest hour at the dead of night
Seen her walkin' down the street
The kind of woman that brings on heat
Loved her dusk till dawn
Come the morning she was gone
Took me out to my surprise
Money's gone left high and dry
Need no excuse 
To let it all hang loose
My body's blown a fuse
Rising power
We'll raise the night
Rising power
Rising power
We'll wake the dead
Rising power
You'll end up torn to shreds

Don't need no excuse 
My body's blown a fuse
Rising power
We'll raise the night
Rising power
Rising power
We'll wake the dead
Rising power
You'll end up torn to shreds

Rise
Rise
Rise
Rising power
The power rise 
From you
