		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I look into your eyes
There's nothing there to see
Nothing but my own mistakes
Staring back at me


Everything has to end, you'll soon find, we're outta time, left to watch it all unwhind
Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down
Everything has to end, you'll soon find, we're outta time, left to watch it all unwhind
Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down

I've lied
To you
This is the last smile
That I'll fake for the sake of being with you
(Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down)
(Everything has to end, you'll soon find, we're outta time, left to watch it all unwhind)
For sake of being with you
(Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down)
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I stayed with you
Just push away
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me


I've tried
Like you
To do everything you wanted to
This is the last time
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you
(Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down)
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(Everything has to end, you'll soon find, we're outta time, left to watch it all unwind)
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I stayed with you
Just push away
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me

Reverse phsycology's failing miserably
It's so hard to be, left all alone
Telling you is the only chance for me
there's nothing left but, to turn and face you
When I look into your eyes, there's nothing there to see
Nothing but my own mistakes staring back at me
Asking why...
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie (why)
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I stayed with you
Just push away
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me
Why I stayed with you
Just push away
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me
