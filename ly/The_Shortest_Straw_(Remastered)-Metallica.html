		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Suspicion is your name 
Your honesty to blame 
Put dignity to shame dishonor 
Witch hunt modern day 
Determining decay 
The blatter and disarray disfigure 
The public eyes disgrace 
Defying common place 
Unending paper chase unending 
Deafening 
Painstaking 
Reckoning 
This vertigo it doth bring 

Shortest straw challenge liberty 
Downed by law 
Live in infamy 
Rub you raw 
Witch hunt riding through shortest straw 
This shortest straw has been pulled for you 

Pulled for you (shortest straw)
Shortest straw has been pulled for you 

The accusations fly discrimination, why? 
Your inner self to die intruding 
Doubt sunk itself in you 
It's teeth and talons through
Your living catch twenty two deluding
A mass hysteria a megalomania 
Reveal dementia, reveal 
Secretly, silently, certainly 
In vertigo you will be 

Shortest straw 
Challenge liberty 
Downed by law 
Live in infamy 
Rub you raw 
Witch hunt riding through shortest straw 
This shortest straw has been pulled for you 

Pulled for you (shortest straw)
Shortest straw has been pulled for you 
Pulled for you (shortest straw)
Shortest straw has been pulled for you 

Behind you, hands are tied 
Your being, ostracized 
Your hell is multiplied upending 
The fallout has begun 
Oppressive damage done 
Your many turned to none to nothing 
You're reaching your nadir 
Your will has disappeared 
The lie is crystal clear defending 
Channels red 
One word said 
Blacklisted with vertigo make you dead 

Shortest straw 
Challenge liberty 
Downed by law 
Live in infamy 
Rub you raw 
Witch hunt riding through 
Shortest straw 
This shortest straw has been pulled for you 
Pulled for you
