		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lady, where has your love gone?
I was looking but can't find it anywhere
They always offer when there's loads of love around
But when you're short of some, it's nowhere to be found

Well, I know your game, you told him yesterday
"No chance, you'll get nothing from me"
But now she's there, you're there and everybody's there
He's in turmoil, as puzzled as can be, just like me

Let's go down, down, low down
Where I know I should not go
Oh, and she, you think she's the one
But she's just one in twenty-four
And just 'cause everybody's doing it
Does that mean that I can too?

Lady, where has your love gone?
It was the antiseptic to the sore
To hold you by the hand, must you first be in demand?
How he longs for you to long for him once more, just once more

Let's go down, down, low down
Where I know I should not go
Oh, and she, you think she's the one
But she's just one in twenty-four
And just 'cause everybody's doing it
Does that mean that I can too?

Oh, her eyes went down and cut you up
And there's nothing like a dirty look from
The one you want or the one you've lost

An ache in your soul, it's everybody's goal
To get what they can't have
That's why you're after her and that's why she's after him
But saying it won't change a thing
And they'll realize that it won't change a thing
Realize that it won't change a thing
