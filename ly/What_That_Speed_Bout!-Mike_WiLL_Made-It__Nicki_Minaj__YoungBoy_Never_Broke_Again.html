It's the motherfucking queen (30, you a fool for this one)
NBA YoungBoy, let's go

Oh, oh (Mike WiLL, Mike WiLL)

Came through buying all the bottles, what you can't do
'Posed to be shining, but she notice that my chain do
Late night sex, I wanna see what that mouth do
Yeah, bounce that ass, do it how ya momma taught you
Real made nigga from the trenches, do no pimpin'
I got seven figures bouncin' in the car, it look like switches, uh
Let's have a drink out, after that we can leave out
I leave the club, driving fast, baby, what that speed 'bout?

If you keep it real, say your needs, I'll pay the cost
Ten thousand for her to go shopping
Ain't nothing to worry 'bout
If it's a problem, get it poppin', blow the curb out
I spend the whole day with you layin' in the loft
Not one, not two, girl, you, I wanna see you take it off
Yeah, I'm everything you heard about
Tryna see what your world about, word of mouth

Came through buying all the bottles, what you can't do
'Posed to be shining, but she notice that my chain do
Late night sex, I wanna see what that mouth do
Yeah, bounce that ass, do it how ya momma taught you
Real made nigga from the trenches, do no pimpin'
I got seven figures bouncin' in the car, it look like switches, uh
Let's have a drink out, after that we can leave out
I leave the club, driving fast, baby, what that speed 'bout?

Ayo, throw that bag, I'm a bad lil' bitch, nigga
Got every ex nigga mad and they big bitter
Diamonds on my chain, blingin' off my tits, nigga
I hit his phone, he gon' curve her like a pitch, nigga (Oop)
Word to me, pussy good, so he been hooked (Mmm)
If he got seen out with me, it's a big look
Word to Pop, body smokin' like a big blunt
Some big dick, only thing that a bitch want
Left the lot, with a big body, thick thot

All my niggas in the spot, you could get got
This that forty vaccine, you could get shot
Since you wanna be stuntin' like a big shot (Brr)
This that pretty little joint from the southside (Side)
Fuck a quarantine, all my niggas outside (Side)
If I'm sittin' on your face keep your mouth wide
Nigga go hard, but be gentle with my chocha

Came through buying all the bottles, what you can't do
'Posed to be shining, but she notice that my chain do
Late night sex, I wanna see what that mouth do
Yeah, bounce that ass, do it how ya momma taught you
Real made nigga from the trenches, do no pimpin'
I got seven figures bouncin' in the car, it look like switches, uh
Let's have a drink out, after that we can leave out
I leave the club, driving fast, baby, what that speed 'bout?

Skrrt, vroom
She tell me "face it," I face it
I say, "this metal that you ridin', please cherish, don't break it"
You wanna be my girl? Be real, you get put in that placement
I'm here with my boy, Mike WiLL
I meant to say that's who made it (Mike Will Made-It)
Uh, ooh, came through swervin' through in a brand new coupe, with some Forgiato shoes
Real nigga, Blues Clues, if you sleep on that money, then you lose
I don't snooze, you a fool, I'm the truth

Came through buying all the bottles, what you can't do
'Posed to be shining, but she notice that my chain do
Late night sex, I wanna see what that mouth do
Yeah, bounce that ass, do it how ya momma taught you
Real made nigga from the trenches, do no pimpin'
I got seven figures bouncin' in the car, it look like switches, uh
Let's have a drink out, after that we can leave out
I leave the club, driving fast, baby, what that speed 'bout?
