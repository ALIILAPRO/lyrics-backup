		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Someone to hold me tight
That would be very nice
Someone to love me right
That would be very nice
Someone to understand each little dream in me
Someone to take my hand and be a team with me
So nice life would be so nice
If one day I find
Someone who would take my hand and samba through life with me

Someone to cling to me stay with me right or wrong
Someone to sing to me some little samba song
Someone to take my heart and give his heart to me
Someone who's ready to give love a start with me
Oh yes that would be so nice, nice
Should it be you and me
I could see it would be nice

Someone to cling to me stay with me right or wrong
Someone to sing to me some little samba song
Someone to take my heart and give his heart to me
Someone who's ready to give love a start with me
Oh yes, life would be so nice, nice
Should it be you and me
I could see it would nice
