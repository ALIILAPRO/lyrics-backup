		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If sincerity was on your mind
A couple of showers wouldn't kilter my balance
Memories fall like drops of rain
Pours in the summer and freezes me by the end

Oh the fragility my valentine 
Has opened up new doors, trajected a new course
Happiness grows like ivy walls
Ink on the paper, oh he just gives me more

Speaking of the end 
I'm running a new race
Speaking of the end
I've sculpted a new face

Oh the fragility my valentine
Oh the fragility my valentine
Speaking of the end

There's a graph I read inside my head
Peaks and the furrows, direction of arrows
And your line is fading into air 
Now I've found a mountain, a solid incline

And he guides me up the rock face
Feet in his footsteps, my hand in his palm
And I see color in the art again 
Different perspective
Different perspective 

Speaking of the end 
I'm running a new race
Speaking of the end
I've sculpted a new face

Oh the fragility my valentine
Oh the fragility my valentine
Speaking of the end

Speaking of the end
I'm running a new race
Speaking of the end
I've sculpted a new face

Oh the fragility my valentine
Oh the fragility my valentine
Speaking of the end
