		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's go to the rendez vous
Of the past, me and you
Dj plays deja vu
As we were in 82

I see your face fade to grey
Just wait for the blue monday
Imagine you're dancing
you're a robot, man machine

I just can't get enough
I don't want a tainted love
I want something from above
But don't go
Just play me moscow discow

Let's go to the rendez vous
Of the past, me and you
Dj plays deja vu
As we were in 82
