		  (Step up, step up) step up
(Step up, step up) step up
(Step up, step up, step up)

Fall back
Take a look at me
And you'll see I'm for real
I feel what only I can feel
And if that don't appeal to you
Let me know
And I'll go
'Cause I flow
Better when my colors show
And that's the way it has to be
Honestly
'Cause creativity could never bloom
In my room
I'd throw it all away before I lie
So don't call me with a compromise
Hang up the phone
I've got a backbone stronger than yours

La, la, la, la, la (step up, step up)
La, la, la, la, la (step up, step up)
La, la, la, la, la, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

If you're trying to turn me into someone else
It's easy to see I'm not down with that
I'm not nobody's fool (I'm not nobody's fool)
If you're trying to turn me into something else
I've seen enough and I'm over that
I'm not nobody's fool (I'm not nobody's fool)
If you want to bring me down
Go ahead and try
Go ahead and try

You don't know
You think you know me like yourself
But I fear
That you're only telling me what I want to hear
But do you give a damn?
Understand
That I can't not be what I am
I'm not the milk and cheerios in your spoon
It's not a simple, "here we go," not so soon
I might have fallen for that when I was fourteen
And a little more green
But it's amazing what a couple of years can mean

La, la, la, la, la (step up, step up)
La, la, la, la, la (step up, step up)
La, la, la, la, la, yeah, yeah,yeah

If you're trying to turn me into someone else
It's easy to see I'm not down with that
I'm not nobody's fool (I'm not nobody's fool)
If you're trying to turn me into something else
I've seen enough and I'm over that
I'm not nobody's fool (I'm not nobody's fool)
If you want to bring me down
Go ahead and try
Go ahead and try

Go ahead and try
Try to look me in the eye
But you'll never see inside
Until you realize, realize

Things are trying to settle down
Just try to figure out
Exactly what I'm about
If it's with or without you
I don't need you doubting me

If you're trying to turn me into someone else
It's easy to see I'm not down with that
I'm not nobody's fool (I'm not nobody's fool)
If you're trying to turn me into something else
I've seen enough and I'm over that
I'm not nobody's fool (I'm not nobody's fool, I'm not nobody's fool)
If you want to bring me down
Go ahead and try, try

La, la, la, la, la, yeah, yeah
La, la, la, la, la, yeah, yeah
La, la, la, la, la, ah
La, la, la, la, la

Would you be laughing out loud? (la, la, la, la)
If I played to my own crowd (la, la, la, la)
Try (go ahead and try)
