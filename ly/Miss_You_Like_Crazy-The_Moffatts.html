		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I used to call you my girl
I used to call you my friend
I used to call you the love
The love that I never had

When I think of you
I don't know what to do
When will I see you again?

I miss you like crazy
Even more than words can say
I miss you like crazy
Every minute of everyday
Girl, I'm so down when you're love's not around
I miss you, miss you, miss you
I miss you like crazy

You're all that I want
You're all that I need,(you're all that I need)
Can't you see how I feel?
Can't you see that my pain's so real?

When I think of you
I don't know what to do
When will I see you again?

I miss you like crazy
Even more than words can say
I miss you like crazy
Every minute of everyday
Girl, I'm so down when you're love's not around
I miss you, miss you, miss you
I miss you like crazy

Girl, I'm so down when you're love's not around
I miss you, miss you, miss you
I miss you like crazy
Even more than words can say
I miss you like crazy
Every minute of everyday
Girl, I'm so down when you're love's not around
I miss you, miss you, miss you

I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy
I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy
