		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah (come on), yeah, ooh
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah, ooh
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah, ooh
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah

I do this shit early from Monday to Sunday
I'm still with the gang, nigga, if it's sunny
I said I'll be rich and I did that shit one day
Goin' up, one way, this ain't the runway
Pull up with Dior, I call up Rico
I got the key to the game, cheat code
On the real, we not the same, yeah
I can't let 'em play with my name, yeah

You know what they sayin' around, yeah
Don't know what they sayin' about you
My guala gon' wish y'all the best for me
But I know these niggas, they doubt you
My bitch doin' voodoo
Every time I got a new coupe, watchers surround us
When we at the top, lil' nigga, we just want the guap and not the medallions
Never care who see I'm up, you won't get the last of me
All this glamor, shit hysteric, all my hoes, they Japanese
Too much sauce, shit ain't free, he said, "Why you taxin' me?"
Yeah, I'm Tec, like SMG, vintage like the GAT would be

Yeah, you never know, oh
Life might show you places that you ain't even plan on goin'
Yeah, you know that I make action nigga, not no codin'
You know that I may stress but, nigga, I ain't foldin'

I do this shit early from Monday to Sunday
I'm still with the gang, nigga, if it's sunny
I said I'll be rich and I did that shit one day
Goin' up, one way, this ain't the runway
Pull up with Dior, I call up Rico
I got the key to the game, cheat code
On the real, we not the same, yeah
I can't let 'em play with my name

You dress to impress 
You dress like you might see your ex
I dress like I just seen a check 
I think I got some cash to collect
I'm a young nigga, but I'm a vet
They didn't think that I still would be here
Niggas lookin' at me for what's fire
Tryna see who to sign, I swear, yeah
I had to hide what I like
They told me labels goin' through my likes
I know I'm the first to always get it right
Come fuck with Tec, go up overnight
I see the labels never do it right
This year alone, I spent twenty thousand on white tee's
Another hundred on the flights
This year alone, I went crazy like a hundred times
But it took one to get it right

I do this shit early from Monday to Sunday
I'm still with the gang, nigga, if it's sunny
I said I'll be rich and I did that shit one day
Goin' up, one way, this ain't the runway
Pull up with Dior, I call up Rico
I got the key to the game, cheat code
On the real, we not the same, yeah
I can't let 'em play with my name, yeah
I do this shit early from Monday to Sunday
I'm still with the gang, nigga, if it's sunny
I said I'll be rich and I did that shit one day
Goin' up, one way, this ain't the runway
Pull up with Dior, I call up Rico
I got the key to the game, cheat code
On the real, we not the same, yeah
I can't let 'em play with my name

I do this shit early from Monday to Sunday
I'm still with the gang, nigga, if it's sunny
I do this shit early from Monday to Sunday
I'm still with the gang, nigga, if it's sunny
I do this shit early from Monday to Sunday
I'm still with the gang, nigga, if it's sunny
I do this shit early from Monday to Sunday
I'm still with the gang, nigga, if it's sunny
