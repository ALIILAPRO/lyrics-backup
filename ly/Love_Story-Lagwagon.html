		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe it's not funny but it's true
No one here's surprised but you
Embellish it, the truth is your a slave
Addicted to it's escalating

And your love story's bad
Drama makes you livid 
And the nervous always laugh
I'm fresh out of advice

And sick of standing in this harms way
Interstate, indebate,
An impasse
Driving out the hope and gas

Arriving at the same mute conclusion
This destination failure
This going, going
Nowhere slow

Drama is exhausting 
And I'd rather be alone
I want better friends
I'm sick of giving in to harms way

And so are they
Sick of being around something 
That's destined to fail
And the sume of its parts cannot see

They make me hate life, hate
Friends, hate being there
I know that it's not funny but it's true
No one gives a shit but you

Maybe I'll just swallow all these thoughts
Maybe someday you'll stop
