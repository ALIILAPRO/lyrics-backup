		<p>
		  Can you hear me?
I am numb but I can still feel you 
Sometimes I'm blind but I see you 
You are here but so far away 

The times when you wanna I'm missing you 
Makes me feel like I'm spinning 
Sometimes you get what you gain 

I'm on a coaster-collision 
Am not about to give in 
Can't explain my position or the condition that I'm in

Where I am is no limit, no walls, no ceilings 
No intermission, so let 
Let the party begin 

Hey, hey, all the way 
DJ let it play
Hey hey can you hear me? 
Ooow 

Hey, hey, all the way 
DJ let it play
Hey hey can you hear me? 
Ooow 

Can you hear me? 
Can you hear me? 
Can you hear me? 
Can you hear me? Ooow 

Don't you mean that you're my vision 
I gotta make a decision 
Do I go, do I stay? 

You've gotten into my system 
You are in control of my mental 
I mean are you for a stay?

I'm on a coaster-collision 
Am not about to give in 
Can't explain my position or the condition that I'm in 

Where I am is no limit, no walls, no ceilings 
No intermission, so let 
Let the party begin 

Hey, hey, hey all the way 
DJ let it play
Hey hey can you hear me? (Can you hear me?)

Hey, hey, hey all the way 
DJ let it play
Hey hey can you hear me? 
Ooow 

Ooow Ooow Ooow Ooow Ooow Ooow 
Can you hear me? (Ooow)
Can you hear me? (Ooow)
Can you hear me? (Ooow)
Can you hear me? (Ooow)
Can you hear me?

Hey, hey, hey all the way 
DJ let it play
Hey hey can you hear me? (Can you hear me?)

Hey, hey, hey all the way 
DJ let it play
Hey hey can you hear me? (Can you hear me?) ooow

Hey, hey, hey all the way 
DJ let it play
Hey hey can you hear me?

Hey, hey, hey all the way 
DJ let it play
Hey hey can you hear me? (Can you hear me?) ooow

Hey, hey, hey all the way 
DJ let it play
Hey hey can you hear me? (Can you hear me?) ooow

Hey, hey, hey all the way 
DJ let it play
Hey hey can you hear me? (Can you hear me?)
