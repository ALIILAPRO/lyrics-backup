		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can see it in my mind
I can see them get in line
Like a dream about to bloom
We are going to the moon

I can see it in my mind
I can see them get in line
Like a dream about to bloom
We are going to the moon

Like a dream about to bloom
We are going to the moon

Like a dream about to bloom
We are going to the moon

Like a dream about to bloom
We are going to the moon
