		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Inside my cage, I watch the clouds
Getting angry, turning dark and raining down
I let my fingers run
I want to turn my brain off, want to turn my shame to dust
Nobody hears me now
I'm talking to myself, I'm talking to god or something
I don't want anything to do with magic

And back then, I had it
Forgiving and sacred

You ask me what I think about this
Is there's even a reason for it?
I don't have answers, no one does
I've been finding comfort in that
There's only love
There's only moving through and trying your best
Sometimes it's not enough
Who gives a fuck? All of this will end

Don't forget
All of this will end

I'm out of body
I am idle in the kitchen, biting on my fingernails
Keeping from calling
Feeling scared of everyone I thought I knew
I'm only loving
Only moving through and trying my best
Sometimes it's not enough
But I'm still real, and I forgive
