		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see thru your smile I know you're dead inside
Sorry if I don't answer, I'm too busy trying not to
Die
I
Won't
Break
I wasn't enough for you then
Darling, you ain't nothing to break me
Broke now, can't fix
Ripper put me down to sleep
Take me, slit my wrist
Dug my grave, Now I'll rest in peace
Blacked out, I'm numb now
I can't wait to go down
Can't think, it's so deep
Hope my sins will go with me
I don't regret what I did
Anxiety made me what I am
I can't go back now
My demons are all around
Scars tatted on my skin
I was blind but now I'm free
So I can be a better me without you
Die
I
Won't
Break
I wasn't enough for you then
Darling, you ain't nothing to break me
But now I know what's hurting
This time it won't consume me
Just let it go, you'll never break me down
I just need to dig
So I can find a better me
So I can be a better me without you
Taken
Die
I
Won't
Break
I wasn't enough for you then
Darling, you ain't nothing to break me
But now I know what's hurting
This time it won't consume me
Just let it go, you'll never break me down
I see thru your smile I know you're dead inside
Sorry if I don't answer I'm too busy trying not to
I see thru your smile I know you're dead inside
Sorry if I don't answer I'm too busy trying not to
Die
But now I know what's hurting
This time it won't consume me
Just let it go, you'll never break me down
But now I know what's hurting
This time it won't consume me
Just let it go, you'll never break me down
But now I know what's hurting
This time it won't
Just let it go, you'll never break me down
