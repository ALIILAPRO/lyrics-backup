		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mmm, watch me
Hey, woo
One, two, three
Watch me

I walked over, got this sunlight
Ain't got time to listen to any shade
Yeah
The wind on my pony, top-down, alright
Ain't got time to let them darken my day
That's right
So light the fireworks
Sing like no one's heard
Dance, it's us against the world

Oh, oh, oh
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know about us
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know about what we do
That it's true
Thinking of all this but I'm good, if I've got you
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know about us

Mmm, listen! (watch me)
You wait so long to catch that feeling
So hold on to it for as long as you can
We could run away
To only where we know
Boy, I've got plans, hey

So light the fireworks
Sing like no one's heard
Let's dance, it's us against the world

Oh, oh, oh
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know about us
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know about what we do
That it's true
Thinking of all this but I'm good, if I've got you
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know about us

They don't know about, they don't know about 'bout 'bout 'bout us
Light the fireworks, let it catch fire, we gon' dance dance till it burns
Pull me in close, we've got to let them know know who's your girl

So put your hand on my hand, it's you and me, it's us against the world
Sing it to me one more time, it's you and me, it's us against the world
Sing it to me one more time, it's you and me, it's us against the world

Oh, oh, oh
I'm tryin' to tell you honey
It's us against the world

Oh, oh, oh
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know about us
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know about what we do
That it's true
Thinking of all this but I'm good, if I've got you
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know about us
I walked over in the sunlight
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know about us
The wind on my pony, top-down, alright
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know about what we do
That it's true
Thinking of all this but I'm good, if I've got you
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know, they don't know about us
