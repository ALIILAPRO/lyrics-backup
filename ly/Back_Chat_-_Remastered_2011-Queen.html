		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Get back get back
Back chat back chat
You burn all my energy
Back chat back chat
Criticizing all you see
Back chat, back chat
Analyzing what I say
Back chat, back chat
And you always get your way

Oh yeah! See what you've done to me
Back chat, back chat
It's driving me insane
Survival to the end
Knock you down, you come again
Talk back, talk back
You've got me on the wrack
Twisting ev'ry word I say
Wind me up and get your way
Fat chance I have of making a romance
If I'm ever goin' to win
Have to get the last word in
Take it from there

Twisting ev'ry word I say, Huh!
Wind me up and let me play
Back chat, back chat
You burn all my energy
Back chat, back chat
Criticizing all you see
Back chat, back chat
Analyzing what I say
Back chat, back chat
And you always get your way

Come on now
Wake up, stand up
And drag yourself on out
Get down, get ready
Scream and shout

Back off me, be cool
And learn to change your ways
'Cause you're talking in your sleep
And you're walking in a daze
Don't push your luck
I'm ready to attack
'Cause when I'm trying to talk to you 
All you do is just talk back
You stand so tall you don't frighten me at all
Don't talk back, don't talk back
Don't talk back just leave me alone

Back chat, back chat
You burn all my energy
Back chat, back chat
Criticizing all you see
Back chat, back chat
Analyzing what I say
Back chat, back chat
And you always get your way

Yes you do
Yes you do baby
Come on back chat, back chat
Back chat, back chat
Back chat, back chat
Go for it, go for it, go for it baby
Back chat, back chat
You're giving me the runaround
Criticizing (oh yeah), analyzing (oh yeah)
Yeah merci beaucoup
Get on down
