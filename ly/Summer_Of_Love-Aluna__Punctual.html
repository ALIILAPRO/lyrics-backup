		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Right about now I can see they wanna fight
Never back down 'cause I know I'm gonna get my dues
Baby, it's true, baby, let's do this
I'ma get bruised
Baby, let's do this, I'ma get bruised
We wanted to feel it was our time
The summer we were all knocked down
The summer of love

Take my hand so we don't have to run
And even when they come for us
Hold me close, so close I'm overcome
The only thing I need's your love

Feed my love
Give me all my power
It's too much
The summer of love

So close, so close I'm overcome
The only thing I need's your love

On my mind, all my days, all my nights
Work ain't done and you know I'm gonna get my dues
Baby, it's true, I'ma get through this
I'ma get bruised
Baby, let's do this, I'ma get bruised
We wanted to feel it was our time
The summer we were all knocked down
The summer of love

Take my hand so we don't have to run
And even when they come for us
Hold me close, so close I'm overcome
The only thing I need's your love

Feed my love
Give me all my power
It's too much
The summer of love

So close, so close I'm overcome
The only thing I need's your love

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Summer of love, yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
It's the summer of love, ayy-ayy
Ayy-ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy-ayy
Ayy-ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
The summer of love, yeah, ayy-ayy
Ayy-ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
The summer of love, yeah, ayy-ayy
Ayy-ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
The summer of love, yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
It's the summer of love, ayy-ayy
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
It's the summer of love, ayy-ayy
