		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't matter what you look like
Don't matter what you wear
How many rings you got on your finger
We don't care, no, we don't care

Don't matter where you come from
Don't even matter what you are
A dog, a pig, a cow, a goat
Had 'em all in here (we had 'em all in here)

And they all knew what they wanted
What they wanted me to do
I told 'em what they needed
Just like I be telling you

You gotta dig a little deeper
Find out who you are
You gotta dig a little deeper
It really ain't that far

When you find out who you are
You'll find out what you need
Blue skies and sun shine
Guaranteed

You gotta dig (dig)
You gotta dig (dig)

Prince Froggy is a rich little boy
You wanna be rich again
That ain't gonna make you happy now
Did it make you happy then? No

Money ain't got no soul
Money ain't got no heart
All you need is some self-control
Make yourself a brand new start

You gotta dig a little deeper
Don't have far to go
You gotta dig a little deeper
Tell the people mama told you so

Can't tell you what you'll find
Maybe love will grant you a peace of mind
Dig a little deeper and you'll know

Miss Froggy, might I have a word?
You's a hard one, that's what I heard

Your daddy was a loving man
Family through and through
You your daddy's daughter
What he had in him you got in you

You gotta dig a little deeper
For you it's gonna be tough
You gotta dig a little deeper
You ain't dug this far enough

Dig down deep inside yourself
You'll findd out what you need
Blue skies and sunshine
Guaranteed

Open up the window
Let in the light, dearie

Blue skies and sunshine
Blue skies and sunshine
Blue skies and sunshine
Guaranteed
