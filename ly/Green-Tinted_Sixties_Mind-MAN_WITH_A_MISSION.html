		  Groovy
Look so good in those sixties movies
Sure we know hero little legend baby
Could've made it girl, if you tried
Knowing the force, its easy as a horse to ride
Where the dreams are hanging out with Janis
Recalling scences of movin' to Atlantis
Tell the press you died, try your best to hide
With the green tinted sixties mind

Sheesh
She just woke up but shes still tired
The phone rings but seems like shes wide
Same old curtains can't hold back the light
Reaching into her dreams she kept to fight
Could've made it lady if you tried enough
You know little legend baby
You'll never be able to let it go
You can't hold girl, here we go again
(Down down down in her heart, it'd be tear tear tearing it apart)
Tell the press you died, try your best to hide
With the green tinted sixties mind

You be lookin' groovy
In a sixties movie
Maybe tell the press you died
Little legend baby
Try your very best to hide
A green-tinted sixties mind

Keep some memories locked in away
But each day that passed they always escape
Try to remember, try some neglect
You know it wont work, it will never make them fade away
Could've made it lady if you tried enough
You know little legend baby
You'll never be able to let it go
You can't hold lady, here we go again
(Down, down, down in her heart, it tears, tears, tears me apart, apart)
Clear the fog inside, all you seem to find
That's a green tinted sixties mind

Gotta face the day
There is no other way
To clear the fog inside your mind
Fill it up with dreams
But all that you can seem to find
A green-tinted sixties mind

Hangin' out with Janis
Movin' to Atlantis
Could've made it if you tried
What's the point of force
It's easy as a horse to ride
A green-tinted sixties mind

You be looking groovy
In a sixties movie
Maybe tell the press you died
Little legend baby
Try your very best to hide
A green-tinted sixties mind

(Try your very best to hide, a green tinted sixties mind)
