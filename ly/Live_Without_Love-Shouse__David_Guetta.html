		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And if you're feeling like there's no one else
If you search around to find yourself
Say, "I don't wanna live without love"
"I don't wanna live without love"

We're all reaching for a better day
When you're down, I wanna hear you say
"I don't wanna live without love"
"I don't wanna live without love"

You can feel safer on your own
But no one can dance alone
Even if it takes some time
You need to step outside
And if you're feeling like there's no one else
If you search around to find yourself
Say, "I don't wanna live without love"
"I don't wanna live without love"

(Live without love)

And if you're feeling like there's no one else
If you search around to find yourself
Say, "I don't wanna live without love"
"I don't wanna live without love"
We're all reaching for a better day
When you're down, I wanna hear you say
"I don't wanna live without love"
"I don't wanna live without love"
(Live without love)

(Live without love)

You can feel safer on your own
(Live without love)
But no one can dance alone
(Live without love)
Even if it takes some time
(Live without love)
You need to step outside
(Live without love)
And if you're feeling like there's no one else
(Live without love)
If you search around and find yourself
(Live without love)
I don't wanna live without love
I don't wanna live without love
