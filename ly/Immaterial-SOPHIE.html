		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Immaterial girls, immaterial boys
Immaterial girls, immaterial boys

Immaterial girls, immaterial boys
Immaterial girls, immaterial boys
Immaterial girls, immaterial boys

Immaterial girls, immaterial boys
Immaterial girls, immaterial boys
Immaterial girls, immaterial

Im-ma-ma-material, immaterial
Immaterial boys, immaterial girls
Im-ma-ma-material, immaterial

We're just
Im-ma-ma-material, immaterial
Could be anything I want
Immaterial boys, immaterial girls
Anyhow, anywhere, any place, anyone that I want
Im-ma-ma-material, immaterial
We're just

You could be me and I could be you
Always the same and never the same
Day by day, life after life
Without my legs or my hair
Without my genes or my blood
With no name and with no type of story
Where do I live?
Tell me, where do I exist?
We're just

Im-ma-ma-material, immaterial
Immaterial boys, immaterial girls
Im-ma-ma-material, immaterial
We're just
Im-ma-ma-material, immaterial
Could be anything I want
Immaterial boys, immaterial girls
Anyhow, anywhere, any place, anyone that I want
Im-ma-ma-material, immaterial
We're just

I was just a lonely girl
In the eyes of my inner child
I could be anything I want
And no matter where I go
You'll always be here in my heart
Here in my heart, here in my heart
I don't even have to explain
Just leave me alone now
I can't be held down
I can't be held down

Immaterial girls, immaterial boys
I could be anything I want
Immaterial girls, immaterial boys
I could be anything I want
Immaterial girls, immaterial boys
Anyhow, any place, anywhere, anyone
Any form, any shape, anyway (immaterial girls)
Anything, anything I want (immaterial boys)

Im-ma-ma-material, immaterial
Immaterial boys, immaterial girls
Im-ma-ma-material, immaterial
We're just

Im-ma-ma-material, immaterial
Could be anything I want
Immaterial boys, immaterial girls
Im-ma-ma-material, immaterial
We're just

Im-ma-ma-material, immaterial
Could be anything I want
Immaterial boys, immaterial girls
Im-ma-ma-material, immaterial
We're just

Immaterial girls, immaterial boys
Immaterial girls, immaterial boys
Immaterial girls, immaterial boys
Immaterial girls, immaterial boys
Immaterial girls, immaterial boys
Immaterial girls, immaterial boys
Immaterial girls, immaterial boys
Immaterial girls, immaterial boys
