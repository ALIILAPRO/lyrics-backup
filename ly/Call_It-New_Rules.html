		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't wanna come across crazy
Scared to tell you what's in my brain
It's like I think of you daily
But I don't wanna chase you away

So we can call it whatever you wanna call it
Maybe we should talk about it in the morning
And if you're staying then baby let's get to playing
I think you know what I'm saying, I could be falling
You got me running and running my mind's running
At what we could be becoming in the bedroom
Already I don't wanna lose ya
Not something that I'm used to

Call it fun, call it fake
Call it just another drunken dumb mistake
Call it us, call it a phase
Call me up when lonely nights don't feel the same

When your friends ask about it
I don't care what you gonna say
If it was me I would shout it
But I don't wanna risk throwing what we got away

Call it fun, call it fake
Call it just another drunken dumb mistake
Call it us, call it a phase
Call me up when lonely nights don't feel the same
We don't have to call it love
No we don't, we don't, we don't
We don't have to call it love

No we don't, we don't, we don't
So we can call it whatever you wanna call it
Maybe we should talk about it in the morning
Already I don't wanna lose ya
It's not something that I'm used to

Call it fun, call it fake,
Call it just another drunken dumb mistake
Call it us, call it a phase
Call me up when lonely nights don't feel the same
We don't have to call it love
No we don't, we don't, we don't
We don't have to call it love
No we don't, we don't, we don't
We don't have to say the words
No we don't, we don't, we don't
We don't have to call it love
We don't have to call it love
