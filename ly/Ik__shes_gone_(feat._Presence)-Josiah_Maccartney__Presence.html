		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "I really do like CJ"
"Duh you do"
"I'm just afraid of what will happen because.."
"Part of me is still waiting for Margaret to come back"
"What? Still? She's not coming back dude, she's gone"
"Look, Ik alright! Ik. It's just, I mean..."
"I don't still have feelings for her, but I do in a way"
"It's like this thing that's inside of me
And it's always just sorta sitting there waiting around"
"And sometimes I'll see something, or I'll smell something..."
"And it makes me think of her even though I don't want to"
"Is it fair for me to go out with her if I still think about Margaret sometimes?"

Is it wrong that I still never doubt you? 
Is it wrong that I still think about you?
And I can't help myself, don't need no one else
When the worst comes to worst, and the love turns to hurt
cause I still have these memories, I still think about the days... 
And I know that you don't
And I still hear your voice cause you're sitting right beside me
I hate it that we talk, every little thing reminds me...
We coulda made it back but you messed up all the timing
I don't feel a thing but the memories still haunt me

"I really like CJ she's amazing... but"
"Is it fair for me to go out with her if I still think about Margaret sometimes?"
"Dude CJ's way cooler than Margaret"
"But... but..."

But I still think of you, even when I don't mean to
The sunlight and the moon, and the smell of her perfume...
It all reminds me, It all reminds me, It all reminds me of you
And the things that the two of us would do
Now I don't know what to feel anymore
Cause my head says her, but my heart says yours
And it's not far to her, that I'm so unsure
But she cares for me the way I care for you if not more

Is it wrong that I still never doubt you? 
Is it wrong that I still think about you? 
And I can't help myself, don't need no one else...
