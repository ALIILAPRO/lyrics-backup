		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I only smoke weed when I need to
And I need to get some rest
Yo, where's my sense?
I confess, I burned the hole in your mattress
Yes, yes, it was me, I plead guilty

And at the count of three I pulled back my duvet
I make my way to the refrigerator
One dry potato inside, no lie
Not even bread
Jam, when the light above my head went bam
I can't sleep, something's all over me, greasy
Insomnia, please release me and let me dream
About making mad love on the heath
Tearing off tights with my teeth

I only smoke weed when I need to
And I need to get some rest
Yo, where's my sense?
I confess, I burned the hole in your mattress
Yes, yes, it was me, I plead guilty
And at the-

Creaking noises make my skin creep
I need to get some sleep
I can't get no sleep

I only smoke weed when I need to
And I need to get some rest
Yo, where's my sense?
I confess, I burned the hole in your mattress
Yes, yes, it was me, I plead guilty
And at the

Oh, if I could only get some sleep
Creaking noises make my skin creep
I need to get some sleep
I can't get no sleep

I can't get no sleep
