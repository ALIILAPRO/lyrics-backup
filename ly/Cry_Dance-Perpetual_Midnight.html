		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Empty I am empty
Hopeless and insane are you to blame
A drink amongst the crowd as the song that plays
reminding me of what you have become

Anger is my friend
Sadness that never ends
Together they sing to me and to you

Crazy is what you said I was
Hopeless and in vein are you to blame
A tear drops to the floor as the song that plays
Reminding me of what you truly are

Anger is my friend
Sadness that never ends
Together they sing to me and to you

Empty, I am empty as you live in joy
