		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Get away from me)
(Get away from me)
Everything that I cannot afford
Everything that I cannot afford
Everything that I cannot afford
Everything that I cannot afford
Everything that I cannot afford became just a chaos that I would die for

And there is no place left to hide
(Get away from me)
You will never bring me down
And there is no place left to hide
(Get away from me)
I will never stop to fight

So deep inside
I can feel the regret
For many things I did
Will this voice in my head
Forever blame me
Get rid of this shit
Just get over it
You loose yourself
When you trust in faith

Pray pray
There's nothing that will set you free
Pray pray
You can't escape your banshee
Pray pray
I will infect your heart with hate
Let me be your breath
When you're drowning in yourself

And there is no place left to hide
(Get away from me)
You will never bring me down
And there is no place left to hide
(Get away from me)
I will never stop to fight

With every step
I'm moving backwards
Feels like I'm loosing grip
Put the weight on me, pull me down
To keep me grounded
Get rid of this shit
Just get over it
You cannot kill
What is dead inside

Pray pray
There's nothing that will set you free
Pray pray
You can't escape your banshee
Pray pray
I will infect your heart with hate
Let me be your breath
When you're drowning in yourself

And there is no place left to hide
(Get away from me)
You will never bring me down
And there is no place left to hide
(Get away from me)
I will never stop to fight

And you won't bring me down
(Get away from me)
'Cause I'm standing my ground
I'm standing my ground
Bring me down
(Get away from me)
'Cause I'm standing my ground
I'm standing my ground again

Everything that I cannot afford
Everything that I cannot afford
Everything that I cannot afford
Everything that I cannot afford
Everything that I cannot afford became just a chaos that I would die for

Save me father
Save me father
I cannot escape it
