		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I understand why you
Close your eyes, why you
Deaf your ears, oh, I realize now
You wanna feel nothing
Just like I was, a coward in the shadows
No view from above

Now I'm alive, it's hard to explain
It took this much time, and took this much pain
You can get here if you're willing
Let go of yourself for a new beginning

It was easier to sing, than stand for myself
It was easy to give in, than stand for myself

I know why you
Hide away, why you
Keep so quiet, mind what you say now
You think you're too much, too hard to handle
You're stronger than anyone that's still so fragile

It was easier to sing, than stand for myself
It was easy to give in, than stand for myself

It was hard enough to go and live on
I was so tired, trying to belong
I was lost in the city, you could see it in my eyes
But I was still a dreamer in the middle of the night

I'm alive, alive, I'm alive
I used to be nothing like you
I used to feel nothing like you
Now I'm alive, alive, I'm alive
I used to be nothing like you
I used to feel nothing like you
Now I'm alive, alive, I'm alive
I used to be nothing like you
I used to feel good just like you
Now I'm alive, alive, I'm alive, ooh-ooh
Yeah, ooh, ooh, oh, ooh
