		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Watch as I wait
As it's never too late
Yeah right I'm a fool
Celebrating 22
Cause I've always been superclean
And I mean whatever I mean
If I don't then I'm a psycho
Cause everything I've seen you do
Is everything I need from you
Tell me again
Why you always need a friend
Or a date to the gym
Like you've never even been
Cause I've always been superclean
And I mean whatever I mean
If I don't then I'm a psycho
Cause everything I've seen you do
Is everything I need from you
Yeah I've always been superclean
Motivated by a magazine
Just another clever psycho
Cause everything I've seen you do
Is everything I need from you
