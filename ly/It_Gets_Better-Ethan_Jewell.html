		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This week I cried until I couldn't see
And this week I rotted out all of my teeth
And this week I learned with my eyes and my ears
That I might not be ready to properly sing
To a crowd full of people, they're cheering for me
But my mouth is glued shut and my lips can't be freed
And I'm gasping for air, underwater alone
And this is why I do not answer my phone
This week my life really lost all its meaning
And this week I cried until I was left screaming
And this week I forgot why I am still going
And this week I stopped talking to all my friends
And this week I think that I finally lost it
And this week my brain turned off, and I got numb
And this week I'm hurting, I'm hurting so bad
And this week I'm writhing in pain from my head
But it's not from a headache, it's from scars and wounds
That haven't been healed yet because I assumed
I was okay without pills or therapy
But I need someone now, and I need someone, please
And this week I prayed for a fast remedy
That I know wouldn't come and I see in my dreams
And my dad he is there and he said, "Son, I'm proud of who you're going to be"
And I said, "I will be no one, I'm covered in dirt
And I think that I might give in to this hurt"
And he looked at me gently, and his eyes filled tears
And I was quickly overcome by all my worst fears
And the wind started howling, it brushed through my hair
And I looked for someone, but there was no one there
And the ground dropped beneath me, and my heart left my chest
And I screamed with no sound, and I screamed far too loud
And I screamed as I smashed into rock, into ground
And my body was broken and I thought I was finally free
And the silence without my heartbeat was deafening
And a face appeared from thin air in front of me
And I said, "Is this the end?", almost like a plea
And the mouth spoke and said, "You came here too quick
You had much to do, but you were just sick
You had people to love and you were somebody's somebody
But your heart was hurting, and your brain started rotting"
I regretted it instantly, and I wished for it back
Before I was falling and it all turned black
And they tell you that your life flashes before your eyes
But they don't tell you how it feels when you realize
And they don't tell you what the view is like from halfway down
And they don't tell you the horrible deafening sound
And they don't tell you their reaction to reading your letter
And they don't tell you that no matter what, it always gets better
So please
Please stay
Because it gets better
It gets better
Please stay
It gets better
