		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see myself
Walking life by your side
Safe and sound
But life is a mystery
Taken by surprise
When you left me
You will never see me rise
You will never see it in my eyes
Haunted by the shadows
That you left behind
Pieces of you in me
That still harmonize
Let me have this dance
Let me say goodbye
Let me hold your hand
Give me one last dance
I never felt
So embraced
By the moonlight
Til you became it
And I wait for you each night
Waiting for you
To come embrace me
You will never see me rise
You will never see it in my eyes
Haunted by the shadows
That you left behind
The pieces of you in me
That still harmonize
Let me have this dance
Let me say goodbye
Let me hold your hand
Give me one last dance
You will never see me rise
You will never see it in my eyes
Let me have this dance
Let me say goodbye
