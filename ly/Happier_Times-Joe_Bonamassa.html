		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The shape that I'm in
Never let her down a day in my life
Tree's all around me
As I see the time pass me by
Never trade you for the world
Never do the things I used to
I guess it's not good enough 
This I see
But I'll remember happier times
Life it hits me
Comes faster now day by day
Places that I've been
Are not the place I wanna be
Never trade you for the world
Never do the things I used to
I guess it's not good enough 
This I see
And I'll remember happier times
Friday comes and goes
I guess I won't talk to you anymore
So many things unsaid
So many things I wanna say
Never trade you for the world
Never do the things I used to
I guess it's not good enough 
This I see
But I'll remember happier times
And Now remember happier times
