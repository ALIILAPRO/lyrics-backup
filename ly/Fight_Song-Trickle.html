		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This game of life's a fight, I'm on the board and I can't rest until I make it alive
I wish that I could find a way to ease the pain that eats away at me every night
They take and take until they get their heyday
Can't say a thing, unless you want a mayday
And nothing will ever change
My thoughts fade to a ra-ta-ta-ta-ta

But if all of the nonsense you've been promising 
Is a lie to cheat me out of my dreams
I swear that I won't sleep until you've tasted the rage 
That I've caged and carried inside of me
Living life at your side, come lean on me when you like
In the dark of the night, I hear a call in my mind
And no matter what I try
I'm haunted by the life I left behind 

While the night is still faint, let's dream of the future we'll make

The fight is on, let's dance
Tonight's our second chance
We're facing death still standing
We're the ones who write our ending
Feel the beat that's in my chest
Cuz the boy I've become is living
Moving on but not forgetting
It's our beginning

Come tonight, we'll touch the sky
Let's make a scene, it's alright
Be a rebel till the sunrise
Don't close your eyes, just lose your mind and watch the world shine
No time to think, just jump into the ring
The crowd is cheering on and on, it's our fight song

Came back from the brink of death
Never going down easy, we're swinging on as long as we live
No pain, no gain, that's the game and that's way we play
So take my hand and we'll take it away
Can't help the way I raise trouble each day
Living on the edge, but really what can I say
I'll still be a dead man someday
But the grave's gonna have to fight for me

I locked my heart away
So I could keep it safe from love and pain, but something has changed 
Looks like it's showtime, hey?
I've got nothing to lose, so I'll swing away with all of my rage
In the cage, I fight for meaningless praise
I'm at the top, so let me hear you say yay
I wanna be free, I pray
But in the end, it's all the same thing

Gloves are off, eyes are burning
So let's go, I'll give you a show

While the night is still faint, let's dream of the future we'll make
The fight is on, let's dance
Tonight's our second chance
We're facing death still standing
We're the ones who write our ending
Feel the beat that's in my chest
Cuz the boy I've become is living
Moving on but not forgetting
It's our beginning

Come tonight, we'll touch the sky
Let's make a scene, it's alright
Be a rebel till the sunrise
Don't close your eyes, just lose your mind and watch the world shine
No time to think, just jump into the ring
The crowd is cheering on and on, it's our fight song
