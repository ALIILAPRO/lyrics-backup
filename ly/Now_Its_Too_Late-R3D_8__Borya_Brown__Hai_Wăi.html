		<p>
		  Dont know what you want i need to know
Dont pick up the phone when i try to call
Tell what is wrong or what is right
I can see the shadows look like you
I got to forget find some one new
There no going back for you and i (you and i)

Cause now its to late
Na na na to late
Na na na to late
Na na na to late
Now its to late
Na na na to late
Na na na to late
Na na na to late

Dont know what you want i need to know
Dont pick up the phone when i try to call
Tell what is wrong or what is right
I can see the shadows look like you
I got to forget find some one new
There no going back for you and i (you and i)

Cause now its to late
Na na na to late
Na na na to late
Na na na to late
Now its to late
Na na na to late
Na na na to late
Na na na to late
