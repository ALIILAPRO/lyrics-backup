		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time to go and get our kicks
Dropping out and getting in the mix now
Whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey
In the backroom, nothing to do
We're not bored, we're just sick of you, yeah (whoa)
Yeah, sick of you (hey, hey, hey, hey)

Breakdown, takedown
Now it's on
A sold out, blowout
Donkey Kong
Well no, hell no
What you gonna do
When they keep coming for you?

See the shadows marching on
Yesterday's dreams are dead and gone (whoa)
Dead and gone (hey, hey, hey, hey)
Hear the cheering up above
Down below it's push and shove (whoa)
Yeah, push and shove (hey, hey, hey, hey)

Breakdown, takedown
Now it's on
A sold out blowout
Donkey Kong
Well no, hell no
What you gonna do
When they keep coming for you?

Bet some, get some
Knock you down
A lowdown showdown
Kiss the ground
Well no, hell no
What you gonna do?
Lights out, permanent snooze
They'll be coming for you

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

What's up?
Fuck you up

Breakdown, takedown
Now it's on
A sold out blow out
Donkey Kong
Well no, hell no
What you gonna do?
They just keep coming for you

Bet some, get some
Knock you down
A lowdown showdown
Kiss the ground
Well no, hell no
What you gonna do?
Lights out, permanent snooze
They'll be coming for you

They'll be coming for you
They'll be coming for you
