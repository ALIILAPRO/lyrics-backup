		  PTX Productions, baby!

Ah! Yeah! Come on, bitch
Let's Go!

Let's go to the beach, each
Let's go get away
They say, what they gonna say?
Have a drink, clink, found the bud light
Bad bitches like me, is hard to come by
The patron own, let's go get it on
The zone own, yes, I'm in the zone
Is it two, three? Leave a good tip
I'ma blow off my money and don't give two shits

I'm on the floor, floor
I love to dance
So give me more, more, 'till I can't stand
Get on the floor, floor
Like it's your last chance
If you want more, more
Then here I am

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up, and touch the sky
Can't stop, 'cause we're so high
Let's do this one more time

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up, and touch the sky
Let's do this one last time
Can't Stop

(We're higher than a motherfucker)

Jump in my hoopty hoopty hoop, I own that
And I ain't paying my rent this month, I owe that
But be who you want, and be who you like
Dance our life, there's no end in sight
Twinkle, twinkle little star

Now everybody let me hear you say ray-ray-ray
Now spend all your money 'cause they pay-pay-pay
And if you're a G, you a G-G-G
My name is Kirsten, you can call me Kirstie

Come On!

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up, and touch the sky
Let's do this one last time
Can't stop

(We're higher than a motherfucker)

Get on the floor, floor
If-f-f you love to dance
Meant to fly
Drink, Clink

Let's do this one last time
I'm in the zone, yes, I'm in the zone
Let's go get it on

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up, and touch the sky
Can't stop, 'cause we're so high
Let's do this
One more time

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up, and touch the sky
Can't stop, 'cause we're so high
Let's do this one last time

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up, and touch the sky
Let's do this, do this one last time

Hands up 'cause
(We're higher than a motherfucker)
