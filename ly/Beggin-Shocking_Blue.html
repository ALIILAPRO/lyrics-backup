		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mmh
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
I'm beggin'

(Beggin') beggin' (ooh)
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
(Beggin') beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, baby

Ridin' high when I was king
Played it hard and fast 'cause I had everything
Walked away, wonderin' then
But easy come and easy go and it would end

(Beggin') I'm beggin' you
Won't you give your hand out, baby?
(Beggin') beggin' (ooh)
Put your lovin' hand out, baby

I need you to understand
That I tried so hard to be a man
The kind of man you'd want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again

An empty shell I used to be
Shadow of my life is hangin' over me
A broken man that I don't know
Don't even stand a devil's chance to win my soul

(Beggin') beggin' you
Won't you give your hand out, baby?
(Beggin') beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, baby

I'm fightin' hard to hold my own
No, I just can't make it all alone
I'm holdin' on, I can't fall back
Now that big brass ring is a shade of black

(Beggin') I'm beggin' you
Won't you give your hand out, baby?
(Beggin') beggin' (ooh)
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
(Beggin') beggin' you
Won't you give your hand out, baby?
