		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My life is a movie
And everyone's watchin'
So let's get to the good part
And past all the nonsense

Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurtin'

'Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
But there's one thing that I know for sure

I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you

I gotta learn things
Learn them the hard way
Gotta see what it feels like
No matter what they say

Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurtin'

'Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
You act like you know me, but you never will
But there's one thing that I know for sure

I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you

'Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
You act like you know me, but you never will
But there's one thing that I know for sure

I'll show you
I'll show you
