		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been a while since we've been alone
So turn off the world and the telephone
I need to tell you you're beautiful
'Cause it's been a while and I apologize
I just get caught up in the rat race I'm running
Chasing a moment I'm hoping is coming
If I stopped and took a look around
It's in front of my eyes, eyes

Baby, let's slow down time
Maybe just press rewind
Darling, that dress reminds
Me of the first time

And I wanna love tonight
One on one, by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives
Living fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion

It's been a while since it was you and me
Too many friends, too many evening drinks
Yeah, we commit to so many things
But not to ourselves and I apologize
Sometimes you're sad and you tell me it's nothing
And I brush it off because there's always something
But I need to change my perspective and prioritize-ize

There's one thing I know, it's this
Every moment missed
Can be restored with your lips
It only takes one kiss

And I wanna love tonight
One on one, by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives
Living fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Love tonight
One on one, by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives
Living fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion

Wanna love tonight
One on one, by the candlelight
Over and over we spend our lives
Living fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion
In slow motion
In slow motion
