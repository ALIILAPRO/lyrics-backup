		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You, you always said
That I'm better when I'm not trapped in my head
And you tried to explain
But forgiveness feels much better than the pain

Here and now
After everything we thought we knew
Broken lies and shattered truths
Lost and found
Every memory that's bleeding through
They all just seem to lead me back to you

And I can finally see
The mistakes I made are glaring back at me
For all I've done, for all I've lost
'Cause the "in the moment" wasn't worth the cost

Here and now
After everything we thought we knew
Broken lies and shattered truths
Lost and found
Every memory that's bleeding through
They all just seem to lead me back to you
They lead me back to you

Here and now
After everything we thought we knew
Broken lies and shattered truths
Lost and found
Every memory that's bleeding through
They all just seem to lead me back to

Here and now
After everything we thought we knew
Broken lies and shattered truths
Lost and found
Every memory that's bleeding through
They all just seem to lead me back
They all just seem to lead me back
They all just seem to lead me back to you
