		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No one knows permanence quite like you.
There's a ruthlessness in all that you do.
This is not about what we deserve.
There's no bias in the misery served.
C.A.N.C.E.R

So watch the sun sink into the sea.
There is a perfect peace, but don't wait up for me.

And when we all fade away,
And this world can't bare another day,
There will be no fight in broken bliss.
Respected will we be at the end of this.

I feel it now more than ever.
A reaper's watch. My life is ready to sever.

Your name carries more than disease.
A symbol of man brought to his knees.
This is not about what we deserve.
There's no bias in the misery served.
C.A.N.C.E.R

And when we all fade away,
And this world can't bare another day,
There will be no fight in broken bliss.

Find a little light and hold it close.
Don't lose sight, don't lose sight of what matters most.
Find a little light and hold it close.
Don't lose sight, don't lose sight of what matters most.

This is the burden we all carry together.
Waiting in the wings, so we never say never.

And when we all fade away,
And this world can't bare another day,
There will be no fight in broken bliss.
Respected will we be at the end of this.

So watch the sun sink into the sea.
There is a perfect peace, but don't wait up for me.

C.A.N.C.E.R
C.A.N.C.E.R
This is the burden we all carry together.
Waiting in the wings, so we never say never.
