		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So, tell me, what did I do to deserve you killin' me this way?
I can't lose my life like this, I'm still fighting
If I die, please, let them find me
Because my lungs aren't workin'
Liquid fills the inside of them, stops me talkin'
You can see me underwater
As I descend, I see my life flash again (I see my life flash again)

Got a message tellin' me that I should come 'round to yours now
(Come 'round to yours now, come 'round to yours now)
I can't believe the fear in me when I had knocked on your door now
(Knocked on your door now, your door now, your door now)
And when I went inside and realized I'm the only one that arrived
(The only one that arrived, that arrived, that arrived)
I wish I stayed at home in bed 'cause then I might have survived 
(Might have survived, might have survived, might have survived)

You're not sorry
And no one else has had this effect on me
Now I'm here, but, your neighbors will hear me screamin' until they find me here

So tell me, what did I do to deserve you killin' me this way?
I can't lose my life like this, I'm still fighting
And if I die, please, let them find me
Because my lungs aren't workin'
Liquid fills the inside of them, stops me talkin'
You can see me underwater
As I descend, I see my life flash again

There's somebody shakin' me on the floor now (floor now, floor now, floor now)
I can't believe I'm still alive, but I don't know if I'm sure now (sure now, sure now, sure now)
And when I looked ahead, I saw somebody with familiar eyes (your eyes, your eyes, your eyes)
It's you above me, 'cause you wanna double check that I died

Life flash again, life flash again
And I see my life flash again
Life flash again, life flash again
And I- my life flash again
I see my life flash again, life flash again
I see my life flash again
You can see me underwater
You can see me underwater
You can see me underwater
I'm dead, I can't see
I'm dead, I can't see
I'm dead, I can't see
