		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel alive
Am in love
With my time
Here on earth
And I don't need anymore
Reminders
Of our mortality

Let me prove that I
Lost my blues and I
Can smile for miles

Let me prove that my
Heart is a moving I
Will dry my eyes

I believe that you are
The angels above that glimmer
Believe that you are
My guardians when I wither

And I believe that you are
The angels above that shimmer
Believe that you are
The ones who have saved my brother

I feel so high
And so low
At same time
I just don't
Where my mind
Will draw the line

Let me prove that I
Lost my blues and I
Can smile for miles

Let me prove that my
Heart is a moving I
Will dry my eyes

I believe that you are
The angels above that glimmer
Believe that you are
My guardians when I wither

And I believe that you are
The angels above that shimmer
Believe that you are
The ones who have saved my brother

I believe that you are
The angels above that glimmer
Believe that you are
My guardians when I wither

And I believe that you are
The angels above that shimmer
Believe that you are
The ones who have saved my brother

I believe that you are
The angels above that glimmer
Believe that you are
My guardians when I wither

And I believe that you are
The angels above that shimmer
Believe that you are
The ones who have saved my brother
