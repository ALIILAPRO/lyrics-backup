		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Could you tell where my head was at when you found me?
Me and you went to hell and back just to find peace
Man, I thought I had everything, I was lonely
Now you're my everything, now it's on me

I mixed a lot of love with a lot of drugs, then I found you
She liked petty crimes, she had green eyes like Mountain Dew
And where she go, I'll never know her friends bounce to
I guess it's their loss 'cause they'll never know what we'll amount to
And would you be my light, be my yellow?
P.Y.T. walking down Portobello
Put a smile on this face at the end of the day
MDMA helped us fly away
Who'd have known, who'd have known you would save my life?
Who'd have known, who'd have known you would fly my kite?
Could you tell, could you tell?
Could you tell, tell?

Could you tell where my head was at when you found me?
Me and you went to hell and back just to find peace
Man, I thought I had everything, I was lonely
Now you're my everything, now it's on me

I could you tell where your head was at when I found you (when I found you)
You know I fixed things that are broken, tore, I was bound to (bound to)
Fake his smile before me, you didn't know how to
Oh, but I'm here now, baby
No life been lifin' lately, so I save you if you save me
I was over love, that I had enough, then I found you (oh)
I was no doubt, stressed out without you
All we got is us, when nobody does, I got you
For your sanity and my mentality

Could you tell where my head was at when you found me?
Me and you went to hell and back just to find peace
Man, I thought I had everything, I was lonely (you was lonely)
Now you're my everything, now it's on me (everything)

Yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah (yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah)
Yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah (oh, yeah, yeah)
