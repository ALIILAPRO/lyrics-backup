		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't even smoke weed
But I feel high
When I'm next to you bae
Used to be my girl
Used to be my boo thang
Now I'm telling everybody
You my boo thang
You my boo thang
I don't even smoke weed
But I feel high
When I'm next to you bae
Used to be my girl
Used to be my boo thang
Now I'm telling everybody
You my boo thang
You my boo thang
Bad to the bone
I can't leave you alone
Asking questions
Steady playing games on my phone
You the only one
That can get in my zone
You know what I'm on
Yeah
Loving you is a habit
I can take it
I can grab it
I've been loving you since we was young
Ain't no way I can trash it
Every day
Every single night
I just wanna treat you right
I would never do you wrong
So I had to write this song
Sing along
If you wanna
You know I ain't with
All that drama
Know I gotta go ahead
Meet your momma
Ain't no problem
No need for solving
You know what I need baby
What I want
I ain't tryna stunt baby
Or front
If you my girl
I'ma show you off
To the whole world
I ain't gone act like
You ain't the one for me
I want you
You want me
I want you
You want me
I feel high
I feel high
I feel high
I feel high
I don't even smoke weed
But I feel high
When I'm next to you bae
Used to be my girl
Used to be my boo thang
Now I'm telling everybody
You my boo thang
You my boo thang
I don't even smoke weed
But I feel high
When I'm next to you bae
Used to be my girl
Used to be my boo thang
Now I'm telling everybody
You my boo thang
You my boo thang
I don't even smoke no weed
I don't even smoke no weed
I don't even smoke no weed
But I feel high next to you bae
I don't even smoke no weed
I don't even smoke no weed
I don't even smoke no weed
But I feel high next to you bae
Yeah I do
Yeah I do girl
I want you
You want me
I want you
You want me
I feel high
I feel high
I feel high
I feel high
I don't even smoke weed
But I feel high
When I'm next to you bae
Used to be my girl
Used to be my boo thang
Now I'm telling everybody
You my boo thang
You my boo thang
I don't even smoke weed
But I feel high
When I'm next to you bae
Used to be my girl
Used to be my boo thang
Now I'm telling everybody
You my boo thang
You my boo thang
I don't even smoke weed
But I feel high
When I'm next to you bae
Used to be my girl
Used to be my boo thang
Now I'm telling everybody
You my boo thang
You my boo thang
I don't even smoke weed
But I feel high
When I'm next to you bae
Used to be my girl
Used to be my boo thang
Now I'm telling everybody
You my boo thang
