		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Aren't you tired?
I know I am
Do you still want me here?
In the space between you and your hands
We shrank the summer down
To twenty-four miles
I can still hear the sound
Of you laughing all the way down

We built a tower
Out of water and sand
Make you taller than both of us
And we tear it apart with our hands
Look at us carefree
As we destroy what we made
I love you carefully
And I act like I'm dumb for my age

And I know we're older
She still makes you cry
And just because she told you so
It doesn't mean that she's right
And it still gets ugly
And you still bite your tongue
But you still have more fight in you
Than you ever really did when you were young

Give it up for plain Jane
There isn't really much to say
She's faster than a bullet train
And what you tell her she will take to her grave
Can you see the laugh lines?
She holds her face in the mirror
She says it like nothing's wrong
But I can hear her disappointment from here

You think you look older
I think you look alive
You were right before when you
Told me, "Living takes more than to just survive"
What's a word for lonely
That doesn't mean alone
And what's that thing you told me?
Something I would understand when I was grown

I don't know what I heard
Or what it takes to forgive
You were mad at the whole world
You were angry, I didn't stop when you did
I am building something else
It's not something I will tear down
I will make it myself
And I'm too proud to break that promise
I'd do anything but ask for your help
