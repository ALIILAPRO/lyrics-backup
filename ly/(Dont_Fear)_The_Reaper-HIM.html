		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All our times have come
Here but now they're gone
Seasons don't fear the reaper
Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain
We can be like they are

Come on baby, don't fear the reaper
Baby take my hand, don't fear the reaper
We'll be able to fly, don't fear the reaper
Baby I'm your man

Valentine is done
Here but now they're gone
Romeo and Juliet
Are together in eternity
Romeo and Juliet

Forty thousand men and women everyday, like romeo and Juliet
Forty thousand men and women everyday, redefine happiness
Another forty thousand coming everyday, we can be like
They are

Come on baby, don't fear the reaper
Baby take my hand, don't fear the reaper
We'll be able to fly, don't fear the reaper
Baby I'm your man, love of two is one 
Here but now they're gone 
Came the last night of sadness 
And it was clear we couldn't go on 
Then the door was opened and the wind appeared 
The candles blew then disappeared 
The curtains flew then he appeared 
Saying don't be afraid 

Come on baby,and we had no fear 
And we ran to him, and we started to fly 
We looked backward and said goodbye 
We had become like they are 
We had taken his hand 
We had become like they are 

Come on baby, don't fear the reaper
