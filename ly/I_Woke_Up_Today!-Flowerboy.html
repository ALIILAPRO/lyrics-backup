		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been looking at the stars I woke up today
Take a moment wipe your tears away
I been looking at the stars I woke up today
I'm in motion I can't step out the light
Under your covers when it's time to say goodnight
I went to hell and back you taught me how to fly
But I was just tripping 'cause you gave me alibis
I'll make the same mistakes I'm dumb with it
Don't act too serious have fun with it
I let the feeling pass I know I did
I got some stitches when I fumbled it
'Cause I do this for you
And I'm kissing on you again
Take a moment wipe your tears away
We don't need to act different when we feel the same
'Cause I do this for you
And I'm kissing on you again
You been running circles in my head
I been looking at the stars I woke up today
I'm alive so I'll run another mile
(I won't stop 'til I'm dead baby turn me up)
And you got too lonely so you told me to stay a while
(When you f**k me in the morning that's real love)
But no matter where you go I want to say you're mine
So I was just tripping when you gave me alibis
I'll make the same mistakes I'm dumb with it
Don't act too serious have fun with it
I let the feeling pass I know I did
I got some stitches when I fumbled it
'Cause I do this for you
And I'm kissing on you again
Take a moment wipe your tears away
We don't need to act different when we feel the same
'Cause I do this for you
And I'm kissing on you again
You been running circles in my head
I been looking at the stars I woke up today
I been looking at the stars I woke up today
Take a moment wipe your tears away
I been looking at the stars I woke up today
