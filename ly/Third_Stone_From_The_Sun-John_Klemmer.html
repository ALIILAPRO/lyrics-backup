		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  {intro slowed down talking begins}
Star fleet to scout ship, please give your position. Over.
I'm in orbit around the third planet from the star called the sun. Over.
You mean it's the Earth? Over.
Positive. It is known to have some form of intelligent species. Over.
I think we should take a look.

{intro slowwed down talking ends}
Strange beautiful grass of green,
With your majestic silver seas
Your mysterious mountains I wish to see closer
May I land my kinky machine?
{start slowed down}

Strange beautiful, grass of green
With your majestic silver seas
Your mysterious mountains I wish to see closer
May I land my kinky machine?
{end slowed down}

Although your world wonders me,
With your majestic and superior cackling hen
Your people I do not understand,
So to you I shall put an end
And you'll never hear surf music again
{start slowed down...rough guess at lyrics}
Secret
Oh, secret
Oh
Shhhh...
{end slowed down}
