		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Her laughter's for another
Her motions are disguised
Her makeup doesn't cover
What I see behind her eyes
Yes, I know that nothing's wrong
But what's the harm in asking, "Why?"
I know that you're not tired
Where the fuck were you tonight?

Baby, let me be
Take my noose and set me free
Light my home on fire
Take me higher than I wanna be
Baby, on my knees
Beggin' for the sweet release
Let me hear the choir full of liars
Tell 'em I want peace

I wish I wasn't problematic
I'm semi-automatic
I'm trying not to panic, panic
I'm burning bridges into ashes
Light them up like matches
How could you understand it, stand it?

This morning she skipped breakfast
Said, she was running late
Her actions turning reckless
She began making mistakes
Then, I noticed something awful
'Bout her cadence yesterday
She didn't even notice
That she called me by his name

Baby, let me be
Take my noose and set me free
Light my home on fire
Take me higher than I wanna be
Baby, on my knees
Beggin' for the sweet release
Let me hear the choir full of liars
Tell 'em I want peace

I wish I wasn't problematic
I'm semi-automatic
I'm trying not to panic, panic
I'm burning bridges into ashes
Light them up like matches
How could you understand it, stand it?
I wish I wasn't problematic
I'm semi-automatic
I'm trying not to panic, panic
I'm burning bridges into ashes
Light them up like matches
How could you understand it, stand it

Why did you love me so?
Watch me as I let you go
Told you that I'm better off alone
Without you in my home
I let you in my heart
Let you back into my arms
Fool for thinking we could make it
Faking every single part
I thought that maybe you could be
The final fucking remedy
The one to pull me out
If I were ever stuck inside a dream
I'm looking back at times we had
The things we did and things we can't
How could you stab me in the back?
I thought you were better than that

I wish I wasn't problematic
I'm semi-automatic
I'm trying not to panic, panic
I'm burning bridges into ashes
Light them up like matches
How could you understand it, stand it?
I wish I wasn't problematic
I'm semi-automatic
I'm trying not to panic, panic
I'm burning bridges into ashes
Light them up like matches
How could you understand it, stand it?
