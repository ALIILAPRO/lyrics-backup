		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't give a fuck
I just want a girl
Who will tell me I'm enough
But I just wanna uh uh
Don't tell me what it is
What isn't
Had a long night
But I hope we're still good
Setting out the truth let lies prevail
Open up your heart
That you keep sealed
You keep sealed
Oh
The night gets cold in the 514
Yeah, the women come out won't hide
Yeah, running from the back
With their nose on tap
Bleeding from all the lines
Yeah
Tell me who you're supposed to be
Broken by all means
Ok
Oh no
La sensualité de ton regard
La fragilité de ton corps
Je brise ta pureté
Deux âmes s'emmelent pour l'éternité
Done
Done with all the lies
That you portray
Endless amount of drugs, to numb your face
Numb your face
Numb your pain
Numb your face
Face, Face, Face, Face
Face, Face, Face, Face
Face, Face, Face, Face
Face
(ohh ou ohh)
I don't give a fuck
I just want a girl
Who will tell me I'm enough
But I just wanna uh uh
Don't tell me what it is
What isn't
Had a long night
But I hope we're still good
Setting out the truth let lies prevail
Open up your heart
That you keep sealed
You keep sealed
Oh
Faded away
Running away
In your arms
Your arms
