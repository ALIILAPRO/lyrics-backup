		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One more time like I did before
All my friends let me hit the floor
Wrecked my life even up the score
Escape the reality I pay for

Hey, you're criminal
Hey, you're cynical
Hey, you're miserable
But I'm the same so buckle up for more
Hey, I'm addicted to madness
And I don't know why, why

I'm addicted to toxic people in my life, my life
The more I try to escape them
More they tell me I need them in my life

My life, my life
My life, my life

Watch your back, they wanna drag you more
Tie you up and they all control
We play the game to lose and come back for more

No one leaves here anymore
Doomed and gloomed with a poison core
I don't wanna be free but you're empty without me
I'm addicted to madness
And I don't know why, why

I'm addicted to toxic people in my life, my life
The more I try to escape them
More they tell me I need them in my life

My life, my life
My life, my life

It's hard to see what's feared and loved
It's hard to see what's feared and loved
What they don't see is that I will self destruct
Drop your poison in the sea let it swallow me up and leave
And I don't see the toxic people

I'm addicted to toxic people in my life, my life
The more I try to escape them
More they tell me I need them in my life

My life, my life
My life, my life
