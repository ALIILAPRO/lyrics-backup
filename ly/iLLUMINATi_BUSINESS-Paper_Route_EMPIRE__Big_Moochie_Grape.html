		  (Who made this beat?)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey, hey

Woo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, gigantic, ha-ha
Yeah, yeah, the biggest (The biggest)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Big Moochie

Brand new gun, came with automatic switches (Brand new gun)
Carbon one-five, call this bitch a RipStik (Carbon one-five)
Hating-ass nigga gon' die with the bitch shit (Hating-ass nigga)
Hating-ass ho, bye-bye, eat a sick dick (Bye-bye)
Surgeon with the chopper, fuck around, get a facelift
Post in East Haiti, you know it's not safe here (East Haiti)
Trap house on, ayy, B, we get a lot of cake here
Serving good green and we got that white shit like venereal (Yessir)
Yeah, sipping codeine, not no beers (Codeine)
Uh, shoot his ass down like a deer (Shoot him down)
Uh, hold on, lil' mama, come here (Hold up)
Yeah, I jumped in the streets with nobody, just me
And, yeah, I faced all my fears (On God)
Yeah, mama told me to watch who I'm around (She did)
Yeah, so I cut off my peers (Yeah, I cut me some niggas off)
Yeah, fuck all that shit, want your life, gotta give it here (Fuck all that shit)
Post in the trap, nothing but dope and the dealers here (Trap, trap)
Truckload, dope sold, yeah, we gon' get it here (Trap, trap)
Quit moving slow with the dope, get the shit in here (Hurry up)
Fuck all that shit, want your life, gotta give it here (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Post in the trap, nothing but dope and the dealers here
Truckload, dope sold, yeah, we gon' get it here (Truckload, dope sold)
Quit moving slow with the dope, get the shit in here (Nigga, hurry up)
Burn your whole head in the Scat Pack, yeah (Skrrt, skrrt)
Got heavy artillery, back that, yeah (Back that)
Trap house going hard, drop it to the max (Yeah)
Then I sit in this bitch with some Cris' and some thrax (It's 'bout to get crazy)
Stay down like four flats on the Cadillac (Four flat)
And I'm not with the runaround, Moochie not having that (Uh-uh)
Pull up in the Hellcat playing with her kitty cat (Playing with her kitty cat)
Break me a nigga in half like a Kit Kat (Break him in half)
Big money shit, bitch, I'm not with the chit-chat (Big money)
Don't get close to me, lil' cause, push your shit back
I'm tryin' to see where the bales and the bricks at (Bales and the bricks at)
I used to be broke 'til a nigga went and fixed that (I went and fixed that)
Ice on me cold, this shit cost me a ransom (Ice, ice)
Extravagant lifestyle, I'm living it random (Extravagant)
Nigga play guns, then the egg can get scrambled (Egg can get scrambled)
Put this shit all on my back like I'm David Banner (I put this shit all on my back)

Yeah, huh, yeah, huh
Yeah, huh, yeah, huh
Yeah, huh, yeah, huh
Yeah, huh, Big Moochie (Big Moochie, bitch, bitch)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Illuminati business, yeah, yeah, yeah
Bitch, it's the Illuminati business, look, uh, uh, uh, uh
