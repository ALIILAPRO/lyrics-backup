		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In a city of ice, there are burning cathedrals
Turning the skies into glass
And the echoing futures are the beckoning sutures
That hold shut the wounds of the past

So won't you fall for me, won't you fall for me?
Through a fractured existence, won't you fall for me?
Won't you fall for me, from reality?
To the rhythm of eternity, won't you fall for me?

My insecurities surround me like lions in the den
And I feel like I'm losing touch with what I am again
And slowly I remember why I cannot pretend
That I never think of you and all this screaming silence

(Oh God, I wish you were here)

So won't you fall for me, won't you fall for me?
Through a fractured existence, won't you fall for me?
Won't you fall for me, from reality
To the rhythm of eternity, won't you fall for me? (Oh God, I wish you were here)

Won't you fall for me, won't you fall for me?
With my love as your garden, won't you fall for me?
Won't you fall for me, from reality
I am yours in the end, so won't you fall for me?
