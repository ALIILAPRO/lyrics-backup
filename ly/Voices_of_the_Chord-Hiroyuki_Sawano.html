		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hunger for the sleep I know will never come
Crowded is the space but don't have anyone
I could read the bible to drown out the hum
Avoid the voices of the chord

All the roads inside my head loop back to you
I've done many things I'd thought I'd never do
It's you that I can feel
But I keep my hands
Upon the wheel

I turn the page to drown you out
You are the only thing that I still care about
If I can heal the conflict that's within
I'll know the war has reached its bitter end

Ocean, you are calling me
A place with no memory
You'll see
I burned the blood
I passed the test
And now my love is laid to rest
Our names aren't written on the list

I turn the page to drown you out
You are the only thing that I still care about
If I can heal the conflict that's within
I'll know the war has reached its bitter end

Ocean, you are calling me
A place with no memory
You'll see
I burned the blood
I passed the test
And now my love is laid to rest
Our names aren't written on the list
But you and I know we exist
