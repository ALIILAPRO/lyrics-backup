		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lover, will you look at me now?
I'm already dead to you
But I'm inclined to explain
To you what I could not before
Whatever you didn't do, what you couldn't say
I am sorry that the worst has arrived
For I deserve more.
For at least I deserve the respect of a kiss goodbye

Tell me, do you think of me now
As I think of you?
For I could not have shaken the touch of your breath on my arm
For it has stayed in me as an epithet
I am sorry the worst has arrived
For I'm on the floor
In the room where we made it our last touch of the night

I walked, 'cause you walked
But I won't probably get very far
Sensation to what you said
But I'm not about to expect something more
I would not have run off
But I couldn't bear that it's me
It's my fault
I should not be so lost
But I've got nothing left to love

Lover, will you look from me now
I'm already dead
But I've come to explain
Why I left such a mess on the floor
For when you went away
I went crazy. I was wild with the breast of a dog
I ran through the night
With the knife in my chest
With the lust of your loveless life

I walked, 'cause you walked
But I won't probably get very far
Sensation to what you said
But I'm not about to expect something more
I would not have run off
But I couldn't bear that it's me
It's my fault
I should not be so lost
But I've got nothing left to love

I walked, 'cause you walked
I walked, 'cause you walked
I walked, 'cause you walked
I walked, 'cause you walked
