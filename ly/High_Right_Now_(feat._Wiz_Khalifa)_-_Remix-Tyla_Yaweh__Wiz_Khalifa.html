		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  'Cause I'm so high right now
I don't think that I'll ever come down
'Cause this feels better to me
Than anybody reality

I'm floating in the air like I'm weightless
Flying on a Cocaine spaceship
'Cause I'm so high right now
I don't think that I'll ever come down

I don't know 
What I took
All I know 
Is that I'm hooked
Twenty-four hours got me seeing blue dragons
Molly and the Henny got me speaking different language
Thinking 'bout the world now my mind go tragic
Thinking 'bout the world now my mind go tragic

'Cause I'm so high right now
I don't think that I'll ever come down
'Cause this feels better to me
Than anybody reality

I'm floating in the air like I'm weightless
Flying on a Cocaine spaceship
'Cause I'm so high right now
I don't think that I'll ever come down

I board a private plane
That's the only flight I've ever known
I roll up to the face
Sometimes I don't share, I smoke alone
Khalifa, man, rollin' them pounds up
And one day, I'm smokin' the ounce up
In the 'Burgh, we smoke the best
Kk smoke all in my chest
I don't go on missions, I don't ask permission
I keep it at my crib, come smoke some pack with Wiz
Some fools be sober but I'm higher than a eagle is
And I ain't worried 'bout the police
'Cause it's legal, bitch
And it's so strong 
That you can smell it when I'm passin' through
And if I can't smoke, then these edibles will have to do

'Cause I'm so high right now (yup)
I don't think that I'll ever come down (KK only though)
'Cause this feels better to me (And you know it's paper planes)
Than anybody reality (we don't do no Backwoods or none of that shit, no)

I'm floating in the air like I'm weightless (look, it's Taylor Gang)
Flying on a cocaine Spaceship (and y'all know I'm high as fuck)
'Cause I'm so high right now
I don't think that I'll ever come down

Yeah, I don't think I'll ever come down
Yeah, I don't think I'll ever come down, yeah
Yeah, I don't think I'll ever come down
I don't think I'll ever come down
