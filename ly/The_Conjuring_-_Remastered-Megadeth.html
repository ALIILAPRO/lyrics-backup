		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Welcome to our sanguinary sect or worship
Feel at home in our black conventicle
As we anathmastise
All those who oppose us.
Don't summon the devil,
Don't call the priests
If you need the strength,
The conjuring, obey!
Behold! the flames rise
From the compass' cardinal points
Burn the sacred oil,
And with the ashes you'll annoint
Arrange the symbols
Of the wizard and magician.
Light the candles,
Place the parchment paper in position
Between its leaves place
The lash from a black cat's eye,
A straw of a broom,
Fold, burn and centralize.
Don't summon the devil,
Don't call the priests
If you need the strength,
The conjuring.
I am the devil's advocate
A salesman, if you will.
You know my name.
I met your father years ago
Gave him what he'd please.
He called my name, you'll do the same.
I'm claiming what is mine by right
It's time to close the deal.
You're bought and sold, bought and sold.
Come join me in my infernal depths,
Mephisto's Hall of Fame
I've got your soul, I've got your soul.
The conjuring. Obey!
