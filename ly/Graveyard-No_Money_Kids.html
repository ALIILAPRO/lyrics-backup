		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My baby wants to hang me
Right to her door
She’s waiting for love
She wants more
She’s one of the dolls
I came to earth to please you
She’s outside the law
« now man you will do what I wanna do
Cause I want some blood »

Hey baby, do this up and down
And the graveyard’s still alive
Come on do this up and down
And the graveyard’s still alive

Hey baby, be the one now
Tonight I want more
I’ve never known how to do it
Let me open the door, girl
Sweet and pure and lonely
My heart just can’t beat
Without your skin upon me
I want some blood

Hey baby, do this up and down
And the graveyard’s still alive
Red leaves and dirty ground
And the graveyard ’s still alive
Come on do this up and down
And the graveyard’s still alive

Shaking by your hands
I need it
Shaking by your hands
I want it

Hey baby, do this up and down
And the graveyard’s still alive
Come on do this up and down
And the graveyard’s still alive
Red leaves and dirty ground
