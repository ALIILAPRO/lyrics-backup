		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stare
Neither wait for your arrival
Chastise, in the weight of your approval

Tongue-tied, never rest
Buried in your favorite dress

I don't want to be alone like this
Why don't you make it want you want to be?
I don't want to be the victim here
Another victim here

False alarm, defeat
The way I pick
The night fades
Apostles of deceit, and instant facts
The night shakes

All around us
Everything starts to beat

I don't wanna take the long way home
But I don't wanna find another way
Don't need to know what your opinion is (what your opinion is)
I don't wanna be alone like this (I'm afraid to stay shut)
Why don't you make it want you want it to be?
I don't want to be a victim here (sleeping through the operation)
Another victim here 

When I go
I'm out along the nightshade

Tongue-tied in distress
Buried in your favorite dress

I'm afraid to stay shut (why don't you call it what it is?)
Sleeping through the operation
No one wants to be wrong (why don't you make it what you want it to be?)
Long before the vaccination
