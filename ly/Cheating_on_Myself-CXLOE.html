		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't tell
Was it really worth all the hurt and hell?
Realized I've been wasting all my time on someone else
Cheating on myself, cheating on myself

Yes man, how'd I go and turn into a yes-man?
Showing up for everybody else, yeah
Only way I've ever known (only way I've ever known)
Twenty-four everyone around me always needing more
Now I still get uncomfortable on the dance floor
I swore I would let it go

Could have been the one
Middle fingers up
Oh, my god, what have I done?

I can't tell
Was it really worth all the hurt and hell?
Realized I've been wasting all my time on someone else
Cheating on myself, cheating on myself

I can't tell
Was it really worth all the lonely nights?
Feel like I've been wasting all my life on someone else
Cheating on myself, cheating on myself

Alone
Lately I've been going through my own phone
No one ever ever noticed I was so low (so low)
Lying with a happy face, oh

Could have been the one
Middle fingers up
Oh, my god, what have I done

I can't tell
Was it really worth all the hurt and hell?
Realized I've been wasting all my time on someone else
Cheating on myself, cheating on myself

I can't tell
Was it really worth all the lonely nights?
Feel like I've been wasting all my life on someone else
Cheating on myself, cheating on myself

Cheating on myself, cheating on myself
Cheating on myself, cheating on myself

I can't tell
Was it really worth all the hurt and hell?
Realized I've been wasting all my time on someone else
(Someone else, someone else)

I can't tell
Was it really worth all the hurt and hell?
Realized I've been wasting all my time on someone else
Cheating on myself, cheating on myself

I can't tell
Was it really worth all the lonely nights?
Feel like I've been wasting all my life on someone else
Cheating on myself, cheating on myself
