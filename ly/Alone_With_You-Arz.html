		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want to be alone
Alone with you, does that make sense?
I want to steal your soul
And hide you in my treasure chest
(Ayy, yo, Pluto, you goin' brazy)
I don't know what to do
To do with your kiss on my neck
Yo, yo, yo

I ain't never had a girl like this 
Real to the core, it's real
And I can't talk 'bout sex every day on the track
So I talk 'bout the shit I feel
I might give you flowers and kisses 
Not just dick, and this shit is real
I might pull up on a late night one
Like slap on a movie and come, let's chill
I remember the day that I met you 
No way could I ever forget that
I would go back home on the DLR train 
Just missin' the fact you left, man

I'm textin' bro like, "Yo"
Eman text me back like, "Wagwan?"
I said, "Bro, after all the ho stages I'm ready, I found the one"
Fake accounts gonna talk their shit, why? 
Both of us be lit
And I don't really give a fuck 'bout that
As long as our relationship is bliss
And I know that my baby humble 
But I know that your temper's short
And I know that I hurt you one time 
If I do that again then I'm a fool

And I know that the love runs deep 
Trust me, you know I know
And I know that you really do got me
Trust me, I know, I know
Winter time is cold, it's cold 
And I find it hard to express
So I'm writin' this shit on notes
I just put my feelings into the music
That's the way that man know

(I wanna steal your soul)
I wanna steal your soul now, what?
I wanna steal your soul
(And hide you in my treasure chest)
I'ma hide you, huh, trust me, they can't find you
(I don't know what to do)
And I don't know what to do now, nah 
Nah, man, I don't know what to do
(To do with your kiss on my neck) Mmm
Hold on, let me talk star signs, hear what I'm sayin'

Yo, yo, I'm glad that I got me a Pisces
With water you put me out and I keep you grounded
That's light, B 
I'm so glad that your mum do like me
Got the old school love like '90s
And god forbid, if I ever go jail 
Then I know that my babe will write me
And I know it's your b-day soon
I got you and your b-day, boo
I know when you're upset 
Trust me, man, I see straight through
We're havin' a minor dispute 
You walk out the room, man, that shit's so rude
But you know that we're stuck like glue 
4L 'cause the girl my boo, Arz

I don't know what to do
To do with your kiss on my neck
I want to be alone
Alone with you, does that make sense?
I want to steal your soul
And hide you in my treasure chest
I don't know what to do
To do with your kiss on my neck
