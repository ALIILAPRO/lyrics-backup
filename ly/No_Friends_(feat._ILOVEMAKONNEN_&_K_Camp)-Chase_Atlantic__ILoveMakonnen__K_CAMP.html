		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are listening to Chase Atlantic, yeah

I ain't got no friends in this
Please just stay away, I feel aggressive
I know I asked politely but I'm anxious
And I don't need you preaching 'bout whatever
I might lose my shit and leave forever

I ain't got no friends on the guest list, nah
I ain't got no friends on my mattress, nah
I ain't got no friends, oh, you an actress?
Act this
Walk the fuck away and don't look back, bitch
No friends, no friends, no friends
No friends, no friends, no friends
Please don't be so upset
No friends, no friends, no friends

No, no friends
Can't trust nobody, no, no (Nah, nah)
I win (Skrrt)
I can't pretend, watch me jump out this photo
Shawty in love with the coco (Coco)
These internet niggas free promo (Promo)
Got hoes in New York like LOSO
Can't trust these niggas, they so-so
Why you all in my face for a photo?
(For a photo?)
When I know you been hating on the low-low
(On the low-low)
These niggas too lame, they bozos (What?)
$100K for a show, that's more dough

I ain't got no friends on the guest list, nah
I ain't got no friends on my mattress, nah
I ain't got no friends, oh, you an actress?
Act this
Walk the fuck away and don't look back, bitch
No friends, no friends, no friends
No friends, no friends, no friends
Please don't be so upset
No friends, no friends, no friends

Ayy, I just went back home
So many did me wrong (no friends)
Smiling in my face, tryna sing my song
(no friends)
Play me like a fool, saying that we cool
(no friends, no friends)
Had to leave them fakes
Got rid of the snakes
Ayy, yes, the boy got jealous of the man
(damn, damn)
Super chef, had to teach me once again (yeah)
Money back feelin' romantic (uh)
Chase across the Atlantic (yeah)
Work to bad that's why I whip it (whip)
I'm out here lookin' terrific (uh)
I can take your broad
Whole team is some frauds (yeah)
I'll keep doing me, y'all keep doing y'all
(all, all)
Do not hit my line, do not think to call
(nah, nah) i ain't got no time cause
I ain't got no friends (woo)

I ain't got no friends, fuck a guest list
Yeah
I ain't got no friends on my mattress, no way
I ain't got no friends, oh, you an actress?
Act this
Walk the fuck away and don't look back, bitch
No friends, no friends, no friends
No friends, no friends, no friends
Please don't be so upset
No friends, no friends, no friends

No friends no friends
(Please don't be so upset)
No friends, no friends
(No friends, no friends, no friends)
