		<p>
		  THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES:
 
I’m like an addict
Oooh I gotta have it
I ain’t even playing got a really bad habit
If it moves gotta grab it
Fuse like a magnet
Lose won’t have it
Till I’m doomed in a casket
 
I ain’t playing got a weird mind
If you work 8 hours, imma work 9
If the shit tastes sour, you should taste mine
Imma stay in power for a long time
 
Get up
Nah I ain’t a quitter
Toss me the ball I’m a really big hitta
Big picture
I’m a straight killa
Ry send this song to the highest bidder
Got juice, got gas, imma move fast
New shoes, new tracks, like who’s that?
I’m new comeback better than last
Yeah it’s a new me, never gonna look back
 
CHORUS:
I’m never gonna look back
Cuz damn I was built to last
You move slow and I move fast
And that’s facts
Only I can make a change
Slowly take a step today
I will never be the same
Cuz that’s what it takes
 
I take shots to the top I’ll get it
I got one life, ima do all to win it
I do what’s right, pushin till I fall I’m slipping
Then get back up, always stand tall I’m grinning
I got cuts real deep, been bruised and scarred
I had to learn how to think with my head not heart
I've been chewed, up spit out, torn apart
But pickin up all the pieces is a form of art

CHORUS:
I’m never gonna look back
Cuz damn I was built to last
You move slow and I move fast
And that’s facts
Only I can make a change
Slowly take a step today
I will never be the same
Cuz that’s what it takes
