		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jim Carrey, will you marry me?

Call me when you get this
I've been thinkin' a little recklessly
Checking off a hit list
Actin' like I'm headless
I don't wanna let this be
And I've been runnin' endlessly
Misguided by my jealousy

It's like my dreams are turning on me
I'm my worst enemy
This may be the end of me
I got so many personalities
Jim Carrey, will you marry me?
Jim Carrey, will you marry me?
Marry me, yeah

Goodbye, my worthless ego
Without you I'm finally free, oh
Goodbye, my worthless ego
Without you I'm finally free, oh

Never thought I'd say this
But everything I thought was me
Was just another daydream
Runnin' through the daisies
Felt like it was meant to be
But I was fallin' helplessly
Blindsided by my vanity

It's like my dreams are turning on me
I'm my worst enemy
This may be the end of me
I got so many personalities
Jim Carrey, will you marry me?
Jim Carrey, will you marry me?
Marry me, yeah

Goodbye, my worthless ego
Without you I'm finally free, oh
Goodbye, my worthless ego
Without you I'm finally free, oh

Jim Carrey, will you marry me?
It's like my dreams are turning on me
I'm my worst enemy
This may be the end of me
I got so many personalities
Jim Carrey, will you marry me?
Jim Carrey, will you marry me?
Marry me, yeah

Goodbye, my worthless ego
Without you I'm finally free, oh
Goodbye, my worthless ego
Without you I'm finally free, oh
Goodbye, my worthless ego
Without you I'm finally free, oh
Goodbye, my worthless ego
Without you I'm finally free, oh
