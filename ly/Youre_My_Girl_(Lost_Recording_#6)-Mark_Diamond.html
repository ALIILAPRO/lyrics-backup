		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me does he know your
You're laying here with me cause
You're heart's inside my hand but
You're too afraid to leap

Tell me does he know the way you look at me, no
And she said

I, oh I've gotta let you go
I, oh I've gotta let you go

Tell me does he write you
A song called you're my girl
Or sing about you every night
All around this world

Tell me does he hold you
The way I use to
Oh no

I, oh I've gotta let you go
I, oh I've gotta let you go

When it's late and you can't fall asleep
And you've had a little too much to drink
You give me a call
You say I just wanna hear your voice
Please don't hang up the phone

You whisper I might've wrong
I said darling I'm already gone

I, oh I've gotta let you go
I, oh I've gotta let you go
I, oh I've gotta let you go
