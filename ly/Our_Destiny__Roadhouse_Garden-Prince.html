		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The moment you came to town
My life sings all around
Twenty quarters to your name
Five George Washingtons
No one to blame

Oh, look, it's written in the sky above
Our destiny is to fall in love
Don't fight it 'cause it's stronger than us
Our destiny is to fall in love
I fell in love

I knew when I saw you walk
I had to talk to you
I didn't know what to say
I wanted your love anyways

Oh, look, it's written in the sky above
Our destiny is to fall in love
Don't fight it 'cause it's stronger than us
Our destiny is to fall in love
I fell in love

Look, I'm not sayin' let's get married or nothing
I'm not ready to settle down
And I don't wanna have your baby
But you gotta be the finest specimen I've ever seen

Our destiny is to fall in love
I fell in love
I fell in love
I fell in love

I'm smitten with that kiss that you steal
Babe, I would never treat you like this
I have passions, tingle
Let's find a room
Do you want me?
I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you

This is the road that leads to where I live
See the house, open the door
It's alright, it's alright

This is the house where we used to play
We're open nights, we're open days
It's alright, it's alright

This is the garden where emotions grow
Twenty-four feelings all in a row
It's alright, yeah, it's alright

Talkin' about the roadhouse garden
Oh, the roadhouse garden

This is the place where evil died
See the door, come inside
It's alright, it's alright

This is the house where life's the play
Don't let the color scare you away
It's alright, it's alright

This is the garden where emotions grow
Give 'em love, open your soul
It's alright, yeah, it's alright now

I'm talkin' about the roadhouse garden
Yeah, the roadhouse garden
Oh, come on in and let's groove

I'm talkin' about the roadhouse garden
The road, the road, roadhouse garden
Oh, the roadhouse garden, garden
The roadhouse garden, oh
Oh, oh
