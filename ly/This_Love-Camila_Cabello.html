		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No, no, no

Know you just how to make me miss ya
When I'm feeling sentimental
Going in our separate ways
But when I'm back here in the middle
Losing you, I couldn't face
But to love you is worse
Waiting for ya just in case
One day it doesn't hurt, nah, nah, nah

Said it's the last time, but, "Nah, nah, nah, nah"
Just like the last time, yeah, "Nah, nah, nah, nah"
Tired of building up my walls, yeah
Just to watch them fall again

So fuck this love
Calling my name
Get out of my veins
If you need your space
Then just walk away
You know how to fuck me up
Then make it okay
I guess that's your just game
And I'm the one who gets played
Again, and again, and again, and again

Maybe you should set me free
Maybe I don't really want you to
Maybe I just wanna be
Be the person that you just can't lose
If you're gonna leave, then go
If you need me, let me know
Love me or just or just let me go
But no, nah, nah, nah

Said it's the last time, but, "Nah, nah, nah, nah"
Just like the last time, yeah, "Nah, nah, nah, nah"
Tired of building up my walls, yeah, yeah
Just to watch them fall again

Fuck this love
Calling my name
Get out of my veins
If you need your space
Then just walk away
You know how to fuck me up
Then make it okay
I guess that's your just game
And I'm the one who gets played
Again, and again, and again, and again

Maybe you should set me free
Maybe I don't really want you to
Maybe I just wanna be
Be the person that you just can't lose
No
There I go and fall again

Fuck this love
Yeah, yeah, calling my name
Get out of my veins (get out of my veins)
If you need your space
Then just walk away
You know how to fuck me up
Then make it okay
I guess that's just your game (that's just your game)
And I'm the one who gets played
Again, and again, and again, and again, and again

(Ooh)
Oh, again
Oh, no
Here I go again
