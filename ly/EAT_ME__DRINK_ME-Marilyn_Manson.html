		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the wasteland on the way to the Red Queen 
It's no wonder our stage clothes have dreams to be famous
The trees in the courtyard are painted in blood, so I've heard
She hangs the headless upside down to drain

Eat me, drink me
Eat me, drink me
This is only a game
This is only a game

I was invited to a beheading today
I thought I was a butterfly next to your flame
A rush of panic and the lock has been raped
This is only a game
This is only a game

But then our star rushes in, feeling like a child and looking like a woman
She's been forecast with an attempt to kill herself
But the ending didn't test well

I was invited to a beheading today
I thought I was a butterfly next to your flame
A rush of panic and the lock has been raped
This is only a game
This is only a game

But then our star rushes in, feeling like a child and looking like a woman
She's been forecast with an attempt to kill herself
But the ending didn't test well

Eat me, drink me
This is only a game
This is only a game
Eat me, drink me
This is only a game
This is only a game

And now I'm picking my skin and my scales
I see my horror mirrored in your sundown of a blank stare
I see my horror mirrored in your sundown of a blank stare

Then our star rushes in, feeling like a child and looking like a woman
She's been forecast with an attempt to kill herself
But the ending didn't test well
She's been forecast with an attempt to kill herself
But the ending didn't test well
She's been forecast with an attempt to kill herself
But the ending didn't test well
She's been forecast with an attempt to kill herself
But the ending didn't test well
