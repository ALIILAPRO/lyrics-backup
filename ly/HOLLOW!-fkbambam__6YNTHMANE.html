		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Imma win it like it is the lotto do it with bravado
Riding passenger but we drifting full throttle
My driver is a model the paparazzi follow
All these superficial things make my head hollow
Hollow
Hollow
Hollow
Yeah they make my head hollow
Hollow
Hollow
Hollow

Drinking right down to the bottom of the bottle
Just to try and drown out any of my sorrow
Drinking right down to the bottom of the bottle
Just to try and drown out any of my sorrow
Go, try again tomorrow
Had to go and get it nothing ever was borrowed
If at first you don't succeed just try again tomorrow
Had to go and get it nothing ever was borrowed 

Clubbing in your head like I'm out here playing golf
Try me catch a body do my dance like Travis Rudolph 

Gotta hella calf muscle
I'm the sandman
Bitch it's Bambam out here running in these badlands
Bambam with the choppa guess you can call me blam blam 
Got her in position sucking dick doing a handstand
Never woulda thought I'd make a living off of bandlab
Crazy going stupid guess I'm living like a mad lad 
Crazy going stupid guess I'm living like a mad lad 
Crazy going stupid guess I'm living like a mad lad 
Crazy going stupid guess I'm living like a mad lad 
Crazy going stupid guess I'm living like a mad lad

Imma win it like it is the lotto do it with bravado
Riding passenger but we drifting full throttle
My driver is a model the paparazzi follow
All these superficial things make my head hollow
Hollow
Hollow
Hollow
Yeah they make my head hollow
Hollow
Hollow
Hollow

Drinking right down to the bottom of the bottle
Just to try and drown out any of my sorrow
Drinking right down to the bottom of the bottle
Just to try and drown out any of my sorrow
Go, try again tomorrow
Had to go and get it nothing ever was borrowed
If at first you don't succeed just try again tomorrow
Had to go and get it nothing ever was borrowed
