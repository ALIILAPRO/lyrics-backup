		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come on!

We used to meet
Walk down the streets
With all the kids from the backseats
Turn back the clock
Come back to me

Converse and jeans
Bob Marley tees
We dyed our hair blue and bright green
We owned the block
Come back to me

Time after time, I close my eyes
And I remember the feeling
Time after time, I close my eyes
And everything has no meaning

I know I never say but
You know, you know you're all that I need, oh oh
I know I never say but
You know, you know you're all that I dream
You're all that I dream about, yeah

Now times have changed
We're not the same
You've got a house and a baby
No time for you
No time for me

Gone are the days we used to save
Our summer wage to get wasted
Long live the youth
Come back to me, huh

Night after night
I wonder why we couldn't hold on for longer
Night after night
I wonder why, guess we were just growing older

I know I never say but
You know, you know you're all that I need, oh oh
I know I never say but
You know, you know you're all that I dream
You're all that I dream about, yeah
You're all that I dream about, yeah
You're all that I dream about

Time after time, I close my eyes
And I remember the feeling
Time after time, I close my eyes
And wish that I wasn't dreaming

I know I never say but
You know, you know you're all that I need, oh oh
I know I never say but
You know you know you're all that I dream
You're all that I dream about, yeah

We used to meet
Walk down the streets
With all the kids from the backseats
Turn back the clock
Come back to me, oh

Converse and jeans
Bob Marley tees
We dyed our hair blue and bright green
Owned the block
Come back to me
Yeah

You're special to me
