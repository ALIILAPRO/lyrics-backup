		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Angels fall to the floor
Like they would if I was Captain
Silver children, she roared
I'm not the son of God
Somebody help me sing
Can anybody hear me?
Liars and lovers combine tonight
We're gonna make a scene

Somebody help me sing, whoa
Somebody help me sing, whoa

Help me Captain of our crippled disguises
I won't show what's underneath
It's time for surprises
I can't climb up your ladder
I cannot ride your horse
I've swallowed half an hourglass
So now the landscape is swollen up

I gave birth to a fire
It's like it's features were burning
I'm in control
I am the son of God
Somebody help me sing
Can anybody hear me?
Line up your soldiers on final time
We're gonna have a ball

Somebody help me sing, whoa
Somebody help me sing, whoa

Help me Captain of our crippled disguises
I won't show what's underneath
It's time for surprises
I can't climb up your ladder
I cannot ride your horse
I've swallowed half an hourglass
So now the landscape is swollen up

Let's lock death away
