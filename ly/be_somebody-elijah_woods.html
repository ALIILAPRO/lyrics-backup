		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Without a doubt
The way that you make me feel just slows me down
Time and time again I keep on
Coming back to you all the same
Just like that I be yours again
It started with you then it started with me
I don't know what to do but I know I should leave
'Cause we're living a lie and it's slipping away
Holding on to goodbyes but baby I'm done trying
To be somebody
To be somebody
Somebody you love
Be somebody
To be somebody
Somebody you love
Be somebody
To be somebody
Somebody you love
Somebody you love
Somebody you love
It isn't right
The truth is that your love is just a lie
But time and time again I keep on
Coming back to you all the same
Have you changed?
I know we'll never be the same
It started with you then it started with me
I don't know what to do but I know I should leave
'Cause we're living a lie and it's slipping away
Holding on to goodbyes but baby I'm done trying
To be somebody
To be somebody
Somebody you love
Be somebody
To be somebody
Somebody you love
Be somebody
To be somebody
Somebody you love
Somebody you love
Somebody you love
Stay with me
Say you won't leave
Stay with me
Say you won't leave
Stay with me ('Cause we're only gonna burn brighter)
Say you won't leave ('Cause your love is like wildfire)
