		<p>
		  Yeah
Welcome
Welcome you
Hey
I am your big brother,
What do I have to say to the kids?
Let go, life does get tough
No need to stress,
Hold you back too much,
Let's go I heard they found a solution
Where will you be for the revolution?

Wake up, things might get rough
No need to stress, keeps you down too much
Wake up, I heard they found a solution
Where will you be for the revolution?

I'm so high up, so high up and I like it, hey
I'm so higher, so higher and I like it, hey
I am happy today,
This not like other days,
Some how I feel okay,
Some how I feel okay,
Whoa,
Yeah whoa whoa,
Yeah whoa whoa,
Yeah whoa whoa

Let go, life does get tough
No need to stress,
Hold you back too much,
Lets go I heard they found a solution
Where will you be for the revolution?
Where will you be for the revolution?
Where will you be for the revolution?
