It's okay girl, to be impatient
'Cause I know you been waitin'
You just filled with a lot of frustration
But I know you're okay
Gotta stay focused, don't let temptation's
Get back in the way of happiness bae
Workin' overtime, girl, you know you lookin' fine
But you ain't gotta cry, girl, you beautiful inside
And you ain't gotta chase, girl, 'cause you know you the prize
Yes you do, yes you do, yes you do

It's okay girl, to be impatient
'Cause I know you been waitin'
You just filled with a lot of frustration
But I know you're okay
Gotta stay focused, don't let temptation's
Get back in the way of happiness baby

Come through now, you know I need it
Michael Jackson, how I beat it
Confident, but not conceited
Open up and let me eat it
You don't want nobody that gon' take your love for granted
Fell in love once, it didn't work, so you panicked
Life got tough, but you strong, so you managed
And you're love was automatic so these niggas take advantage
Yeah, these niggas take advantage of you
I'm the only nigga that can really brighten your mood
Teach you things that you ain't never learn in school
I'm just tired of these niggas that be hurting you, ooh
You just need a real nigga
Stay at home, chill nigga
A don't worry baby, I'll pay the bills nigga
A don't cheat, 'cause I care how she feels nigga, oh

It's okay girl, to be impatient
'Cause I know you been waitin'
You just filled with a lot of frustration
But I know you're okay
Gotta stay focused, don't let temptation's
Get back in the way of happiness baby
Workin' overtime, girl, you know you lookin' fine
But you ain't gotta cry, girl, you beautiful inside
And you ain't gotta chase, girl, 'cause you know you the prize
Yes you do, yes you do, yes you do

Yeah, I ain't gonna play with you
Too busy on the road, I'm just tryna lay with you
Tryna run up all these bands, stack cake with you
Take a private to the island, get away with you
I'ma pull up on the sauce, switch lanes with you
And I better never see you with that bitch, I'm catchin' fades with you
Hit the bank with you, I'm just tryna get paid with you (paid, yeah)
Hit the bang with you, I'm just tryna spend the day with you (yeah, let's go)
(Stick, stick-stick)
We gon move, move (move, move)
'Fore you drop top, what you do is, okay (ooh)
Watch out for the opps, gotta look both ways (ooh)
Yeah, show me where they go, okay
Stick, stick, make it move
Yeah, show me what a real nigga do
You like, you like, you like when I say it's your's
And I put it on you

It's okay girl, to be impatient
'Cause I know you been waitin'
You just filled with a lot of frustration
But I know you're okay
Gotta stay focused, don't let temptation's
Get back in the way of happiness baby
Workin' overtime, girl, you know you lookin' fine
But you ain't gotta cry, girl, you beautiful inside
And you ain't gotta chase, girl, 'cause you know you the prize
Yes you do, yes you do, yes you do

It's okay girl, to be impatient
'Cause I know you been waitin'
You just filled with a lot of frustration
But I know you're okay
Gotta stay focused, don't let temptation's
Get back in the way of happiness baby
