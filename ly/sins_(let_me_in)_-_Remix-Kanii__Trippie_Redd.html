		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say that you need me (need me, need me)
But I don't feel needed at all (at all)
Girl, I've been through your hardest
And you broke me regardless
Catch me before I fall down (ah, ah)
Girl, I've been through everything, woah

So let me in, don't give in (ooh, woah)
Trust me, girl, take all your sins (oh, yeah)
So let me in, don't give in (ooh, woah)
Trust me, girl, take all your sins (oh, yeah)
So let me in, don't give in (ooh, woah)
Trust me, girl, take all your sins (oh, yeah)
So let me in, don't give in (ooh, woah)
Trust me, girl, take all your sins (oh, yeah)
So let, so let me girl, take all your sins
So let, so let me girl, take all, take all
So let, so let me girl, take all your sins
So let, so let me girl, take all your sins
So let, so let me girl, take all your sins
So let, so let me girl, take all, take all
(So let me in)

'Cause I can change your life (oh, yeah)
I can give you everything you've wanted
So keep me in your mind, girl, and everything is fine
'Cause we've been through everything, woah

You don't know exactly what you want from me
And I know exactly what turns you on and that's me
And I can't love again, oh-oh, oh-oh
Too much passion, love action on mattress, we love
Tired of goin' through the pain with you
Tired of goin' through the rain with you
Go ahead and tat' my name on you
The world cold, got that flame on you
That love choppa, let it bang on you, girl
Hit my phone, I can make you touch your toes

So let me in, don't give in (ooh, woah)
Trust me, girl, take all your sins (oh, yeah)
So let me in, don't give in (ooh, woah)
Trust me, girl, take all your sins (oh, yeah)
So let me in, don't give in (ooh, woah)
Trust me, girl, take all your sins (oh, yeah)
So let me in, don't give in (ooh, woah)
Trust me, girl, take all your sins (oh, yeah)
Trust me, girl, take all your sins (oh, yeah)
So trust me, girl, take all your sins (ooh, woah)
So trust me, girl, take all your sins (oh, yeah)
So trust me, girl, take all your sins
(So let me in)

Oh, yeah
Uh-huh
