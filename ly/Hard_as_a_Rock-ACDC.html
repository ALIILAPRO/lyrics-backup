		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A rollin' rock, electric shocks
She gives a lickin' that don't stop
She line 'em up, push you 'round
Smokin' rings goin' 'round and 'round

Her hot potatoes
Will elevate you
Her bad behavior
Will leave you standin' proud
Hard as a rock

Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock

The lightnin' rod, strike it hot
It's gonna hit you like the Rushmore rock
No nicotine, and no pipe dreams
So low and dirty, it's downright mean

Hell elevator
Yeah, I'll see you later
No, I ain't gonna take it
Listen, I'm bustin' out
Hard as a rock

Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Yes, it's harder than a rock, yeah

Hard as a rock
Harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Yeah
I'm gettin' harder

Harder than a rock

Well, I'm harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Babe, I'm harder than a rock, yeah

Hard as a rock
Ooh, it's harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Yeah, it's harder than a rock, yeah

Hard as a rock
Well, I'm harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Guess I'm harder, harder, harder
Harder than a rock
