		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I rest my case sophisticated
Reckless like I promised
And I had it, then I vanished
And you talked me through it, baby, do it
Well, you saved me then you made me
Rich and famous, living legend
Lies and games, I died in vain
Blowin' my own ashes in the wind

Tell me what you want me to do
I'll do it for you
I'll do it for anyone who loves me
Tell me what you want me to be
I'll do it for free
I'll do it for anyone who loves me

We're not your fancy dolls
You better set us free, or else we'll fuck you up
We'll fuck you up
We're not your fancy dolls
You better set us free, or else we'll fuck you up
We'll fuck you up

I rest my case, domesticated
Bitches in Adidas
And I hired guns, I hired some
To fake it 'til I make it, baby
Well, you saved me then you made me
Rich and famous, kissin' babies
Lies and games, I died in vain
Blowin' my own ashes in the wind

Tell me what you want me to do
I'll do it for you
I'll do it for anyone who loves me
Tell me what you want me to be
I'll do it for free
I'll do it for anyone who loves me

We're not your fancy dolls
You better set us free, or else we'll fuck you up
We'll fuck you up
We're not your fancy dolls
You better set us free, or else we'll fuck you up
We'll fuck you up

Doesn't matter, baby
'Cause the sky is a lonely place to be
Oh, it doesn't matter anyways
'Cause the sky is a lonely place
The sky is a lonely place
Tell me what you want me to
I'll do what you want me to

Tell me what you want me to do
I'll do it for you
I'll do it for anyone who loves me
Tell me what you want me to be
I'll do it for free
I'll do it for anyone who loves me

We're not your fancy dolls
You better set us free, or else we'll fuck you up
We'll fuck you up
We're not your fancy dolls
You better set us free, or else we'll fuck you up
We'll fuck you up
