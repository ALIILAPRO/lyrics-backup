		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We started out as friends in the Lower East
Did a couple drugs at the house parties
Late nights in taxi cabs
Wish I could have 'em back
'Cause there's a lot of things that I never said
Now you're with somebody else in a different bed
You're happy, I could see
And that's so hard for me

When you walk in the bar with someone holding hands
Introduce me to her, say I'm just an old friend
And you ask how I've been
I say I'm doing fine but I'm lying

I take another shot, need the Novocaine
Wish it would numb my heart, way it numbs my brain
But it's all love
I don't feel it, but it's all love
The way you kiss on her neck
With that look in your eyes
Do it right in front of me
Kinda makes me wanna die
But it's all love
I hate the feeling, but it's all love

Should we forget about the past, is that how you cope?
Should we drink a little more of that rum and coke?
I don't know how to be
When she looks a bit like me

When you walk in the bar with someone holding hands
Introduce me to her, say I'm just an old friend
And you ask how I've been
I say I'm doing fine but I'm fucking lying

I take another shot, need the Novocaine
Wish it would numb my heart, way it numbs my brain
But it's all love
I don't feel it, but it's all love
The way you kiss on her neck
With that look in your eyes
Do it right in front of me
Kinda makes me wanna die
But it's all love
Hate the feeling, but it's all love

So I take another shot, Novocaine
Wish it would numb my heart, numb my brain
But it's all love
The way you kiss on her neck
With that look in your eyes
Do it right in front of me
Kinda makes me wanna die
But it's all love
I hate the feeling, but it's all love
Oh no, no, no, no, no
It's all love, baby
You know it's all love (it's all love)
It's all love
It's all love, it's all love
