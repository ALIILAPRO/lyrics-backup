		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I could speak I'd tell you all my fears and deprivations
If I could feel I'd take away your pain
If I could bleed I'd show you all my scars and imperfections
If I could breed I'd hold you in my veins

You've got me feeling like an animal
Beat down and feeling paralyzed
You've got me feeling like I have no other hand to hold
In this assisted suicide

So say something beautiful
Say what you're keeping inside
This anticipation
I will only let you down
Say something meaningful
Say what you're trying to hide
This anticipation
I will only let you down

If I could breathe I'd show you all my infantile obsessions
If I could sleep I'd hold you in my head
If I was strong I'd keep you close and render you defenseless
If I was gone I'd hope you take my place

You've got me feeling like an animal
Beat down and feeling paralyzed
You've got me feeling like I have no other hand to hold
In this assisted suicide

So say something beautiful
Say what you're keeping inside
This anticipation
I will only let you down
Say something meaningful
Say what you're trying to hide
This anticipation
I will only let you down

So say something beautiful
Say what you're keeping inside
This anticipation
I will only let you down
Say something meaningful
Say what you're trying to hide
This anticipation
I will only let you down
