		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Know we keep the best of green
So you know I'm smoking
Know we keep the, know we keep the
Know we keep the
Know we keep the best of green
So you know I'm smoking
Know we keep the best of green
So you know I'm smoking
Know we keep the best of green
So you know I'm smoking
Know we keep the best of green
So you know I'm smoking
Know we keep the best of green
So you know I'm smoking
Know we keep the, know we keep the
Know we keep the

Bitch, I feel like tungsten
Lungs itch from crumbling piff
A dozen blunts lit stuck on my lips
I summon something bloodless from the
Fucking pit's of hell, yeah
I got fungus growing in my stomach because
I'm chugging wishes from the wishing well
Watch me swell from ingesting
Infectious hopes and dreams
You will never perfect them
Smoking weed while I'm textin' affections
To your ho named Alexis
Added her to my collection, told her
"pull up to the 7th"
I got one zip of that dumb shit
But no protection now the blunt's lit
She's a punk bitch to my recollection
Pussy like a dungeon, got me mumbling
Now I'm flexing at the function
G59 we run shit

Know we keep the best of green
So you know I'm smoking
Know we keep the, know we keep the
Know we keep the

Ran up on 'em with the terror squad
I swear to god up north
I'm off the snow with a bad lil' hoe
My woes with me on that Rambo flow
Kick down the door, we don't knock
We send shots touchdown, I got the pack
Roll that, sit back, no lack
Trusty burner relax on my lap
I got yo bitch on my dick
Audemars wrist so slick
Drippin' all wet on my shit, wish a
Nigga would come claim his bitch
I got flame for that shit
Respect ain't shit, y'all niggas ain't shit
This shit is sickening
Never stopping, DN$ the
Limitless, runnin', rulin', i need infinite
Aw shit, roll my dope, bang hoes with my bros
Roll that motherfucking ghetty green
A nigga tryna smoke

Know we keep the best of green
So you know I'm smoking
(Lil Remains gon' make a stain)
Know we keep the, know we keep the
(Lil Remains gon') know we keep the

Seven grams in the Raw Cone
Fuckboy, it's my dick, you can jump off
Oh lord, just popped me a xan bar
Hold court when I ride with the pistol grip
Talk shit to a fat bitch
Make her feel average
Bet Sensei one stack if he smashed it
Woke up in the AM, I heard that he passed it
Migo and Meth and Lil Germ hit her backwards
Dat way
Northside Shawty got the forty with the gaudy
Purgatory where I reside
East side of Highway 59
Westside, that M-Icrooked letter
Crooked letter IP-P-I
We don't see time, we don't decline, but we
But we stay high
Shadows under them street lights
Keep hoes out of my sight
Germ said he got that potent
Ruby told Meth to roll it
Know we keep the best of green
So you know I'm smokin'
Know we keep the, know we keep the
Know we keep the
