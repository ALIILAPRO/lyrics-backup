		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nope
Another day, another train
Another delay
What the hell
Nope
A little bit
Not too much
Took too much
Now you're dead
Nope
Still awake
But you're wasted
Eyes opened
But you're lifeless
Nope
Not gonna do it today
Nope
Not gonna do it the next day
Hey there
You're kind of dead there
From night to morning
And you aint reacting
On my way
To bring you the dopamine
Now sit up
Gonna put this one into your-
Ah
Maybe a little bit more
Maybe life wasn't that bad
But just don't do it too much
I mean I'm virtual, virtual, ah
How long you gonna stare at me
I'm virtual, virtual, ah
Just one of your fantasies
I'm virtual, virtual, ah
Can't take your eyes of me, yeah
You know you won't live forever
Still you stay by my side
Nope
Another day
What a waste of time
From eight to five
Oh my oh my
Gonna get some pizza, no sauce
Two liters of soda
Now you're broke
Hey there
You're missing something there
Why don't you take this
And put it in your-
Ah
Maybe a little bit more
Maybe life wasn't that bad
But just don't do it too much
I mean I'm virtual, virtual, ah
How long you gonna stare at me
I'm virtual, virtual, ah
Just one of your fantasies
I'm virtual, virtual, ah
Can't take your eyes of me, yeah
You know you won't live forever
Still you stay by my side
Virtual, virtual, ah
How long you gonna stare at me
I'm virtual, virtual, ah
Just one of your fantasies
I'm virtual, virtual, ah
Can't take your eyes of me, yeah
You know you won't live forever
Still you stay by my side
I mean I'm virtual, virtual, ah
How long you gonna stare at me
I'm virtual, virtual, ah
Just one of your fantasies
I'm virtual, virtual, ah
Can't take your eyes of me, yeah
You know you won't live forever
Still you stay by my side
Virtual, virtual, ah
How long you gonna stare at me
I'm virtual, virtual, ah
Just one of your fantasies
I'm virtual, virtual, ah
Can't take your eyes of me, yeah
You know you won't live forever
Still you stay by my side
Still you stay by my side
Still you stay by my side
You know you won't live forever
Still you stay by my side
