		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Met you at the mall
Didn't know how far I would fall
My friends said I was a fool (you're a fool) (shut up)
'Cause you were older and all kicked out of school (you were so rad)
Together we were gonna travel the globe
From Alberta to Ontario

But now I'm building

Sandcastles in the sand (sandcastles in the sand)
Thought I could fly when you held my hand (thought I could fly) (but now)
Eternity turns to black and white
It was the greatest week and a half of my life

We used to go to the beach
Back when happiness was in our reach (so close)
On our favorite bench
We'd sit and talk and you taught me to french
You're good at pull-ups and have radical hair
I hate my dad, he's so unfair (you don't understand our love)

But now I'm building

Sandcastles in the sand (sandcastles in the sand)
Thought I could fly when I held your hand (I was wrong)
Eternity turns to black and white
It was the greatest week and a half of my

Life is crazy, no one gets me
Castles wash away
Come back, please, I've changed my mind
Let's go all the way (I'm ready, let's do it)
(I miss you)

Sandcastles in the sand (sandcastles in the sand) (ohh, I miss your hair)
Thought I could fly when I held your hand (I thought you were the one)
Sandcastles wash away (I'm ready, let's do it)
And all that's left is some sand the next day (sand the next day)
Sandcastles may be cute (I'm on the pill now)
But now all they do is remind me of you (let's go all the way, you said it'd be okay, I'm sorry)
Sandcastles wash away
