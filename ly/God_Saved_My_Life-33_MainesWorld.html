		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He Saved me from myself
Rescued me from eternal hell
When I really needed help
Struggling with mental health
Nobody else around me
And I couldn't help myself
He saved me from being a thug
He saved me from dealing them drugs
Deliver me from that geezer who wanted to chef me up
Save me from the police
Save me from the judge
Saving me from my trophies
Saving me from my lusts
Saved me from being pushed
Wanting to kill myself
Saved me from suicide
Still Saving me from myself
He saved me from the bloodshed
He saved me with his blood
He saved me in his love yeah
Cause he Saved me with his son
Still amen if y'disagree
Waved my debt when he paid that fee
The Wages of sin is death
But the truth will set you free
Listen what he did for me
Come hear of my Saviours love
Now I'm finally Brave enough
to even say this stuff
