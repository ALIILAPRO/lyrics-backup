		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love me, love me. Say you do.
Let me fly away with you.
We are creatures of the wind,
Wild is the wind.
Give me more than one caress,
Satisfy this hungriness.
We are creatures of the wind,
Wild is the wind.
You touched me, I hear the sound
Of mandolins. You kissed me,
With your kiss my life begins.
Like a leaf clings to a tree,
Baby, please, cling to me.
We are creatures of the wind,
Wild is the wind.
You touched me, I hear the sound
Of mandolins. And you kissed me,
With your kiss my life begins.
Love me, love me. Say you do.
Let me fly away with you.
