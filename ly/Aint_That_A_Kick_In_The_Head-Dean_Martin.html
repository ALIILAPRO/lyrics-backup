		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How lucky can one guy be?
I kissed her and she kissed me
Like the fella once said
"Ain't that a kick in the head?"

The room was completely black
I hugged her and she hugged back
Like the sailor said, quote
"Ain't that a hole in a boat?"

My head keeps spinnin'
I go to sleep and keep grinnin'
If this is just the beginnin'
My life is gonna be beautiful

I've sunshine enough to spread
It's just like the fella said
Tell me quick, ain't love a kick in the head?

Like the fella once said
"Ain't that a kick in the head?"

Like the sailor said, quote
"Ain't that a hole in a boat?"

My head keeps spinnin'
I go to sleep and keep grinnin'
If this is just the beginnin'
My life is gonna be beautiful

She's tellin' me we'll be wed
She's picked out a king-size bed
I couldn't feel any better or I'd be sick
Tell me quick, oh, ain't love a kick?
Tell me quick, ain't love a kick in the head?
