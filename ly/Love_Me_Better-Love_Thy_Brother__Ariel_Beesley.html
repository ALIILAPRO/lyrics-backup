		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your hands brush past mine in electric light
You're dancing like you're mine
Can't keep this inside don't pretend you're blind
It's time to cross the line

I know you walk to hide
But I won't let that slide
Don't protect your pride

Don't leave me without saying something
Don't make this about to be nothing

I miss you when you're not here
And I don't know if I have the right
To wish that you would come
Just take me where home is tonight

And love me better, better, better
Love me better, better, better
I don't know if I have the right
Just take me where home is tonight

Can't be insincere, you know what we have here
I think it's pretty clear, not afraid to say
That I don't want to play, I'm tired of this game

Don't leave me without saying something
Don't make this about to be nothing

I miss you when you're not here
And I don't know if I have the right
To wish that you would come
Just take me where home is tonight

And love me better, better, better
Love me better, better, better
I don't know if I have the right
Just take me where home is tonight

The sun is coming up tonight
I see the look in your eyes
I don't wanna waste my time

Let's not take this for granted
You know where I stand
So just do what you want
It's your last chance before I leave

I miss you when you're not here
And I don't know if I have the right
To wish that you would come
Just take me where home is tonight

And love me better, better, better
Love me better, better, better
I don't know if I have the right
Just take me where home is tonight
