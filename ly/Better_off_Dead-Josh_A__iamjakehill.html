		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you don't work then
You're better off dead put you in the dirt
Bitch it's off with your head
I'm always workin', you know I don't rest
Bitch we don't play
You should really be stressed
If you don't work then
You're better off dead put you in the dirt
Bitch it's off with your head
I'm always workin', you know I don't rest
Bitch we don't play, you should

If you don't work then
You're better off dead put you in the dirt
Bitch it's off with your head
I'm always lurkin', you know I don't rest
Bitch we don't play
You should really be stressed bitch I be 24
7 never endin' descending
Into another dimension
I feel the walls cavin' in cavin' in
I guess I prepare for the end

Ghost inside my home
Feel like I'm too weak to fight them
I know I'm not alone
I did not invite them they just
Walk right in, with a grin
I hear them screamin', I'm feenin'
And lower, and lower, I go
From under the grave come the snakes
In the falls rise into the shape of saviors
And rain on the horror disregard your faith
There's no saving the lost ones
When you see the face it's too late
You'll be all gone

If you don't work then
You're better off dead put you in the dirt
Bitch it's off with your head
I'm always workin', you know I don't rest
Bitch we don't play
You should really be stressed

If you don't work then
You're better off dead put you in the dirt
Bitch it's off with your head
I'm always lurkin', you know I don't rest
Bitch we don't play
You should really be stressed bitch I be 24
7 never endin' descending
Into another dimension
I feel the walls cavin' in cavin' in
I guess I prepare for the end

Young Josh A with the beats i'm a freak
Never sleep put the money in the bag
And I'm out
Put you in the hearse, I'm cursed
In my verses
These idiots wanna see me in the ground
Think I'm going insane
Think I'm rottin' my brain
Staying inside everyday on the low
Sleeping in the cemetery late at night
You know
All my evil shit, trying out a new flow
4 In the morning I'm making new hit's
You know I never quit
Talking about how I work
Cause I want my fans who im drivin and they
Don't they might as well be in the dirt

If you don't work then
You're better off dead put you in the dirt
Bitch it's off with your head
I'm always workin', you know I don't rest
Bitch we don't play
You should really be stressed

If you don't work then
You're better off dead put you in the dirt
Bitch it's off with your head
I'm always lurkin', you know I don't rest
Bitch we don't play
You should really be stressed bitch I be 24
7 never endin' descending
Into another dimension
I feel the walls cavin' in cavin' in
I guess I prepare for the end

(Muffled) if you don't work then
You're better off dead put you in the dirt
Bitch it's off with your head
I'm always workin', you know I don't rest
Bitch we don't play
You should really be stressed
