		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Back my blade, let him have it
Watch them run off and vanish
Dip up your chest, turn cabbage
(Hargo Production)
Big boy you know you can't manage
Step 'round there for your captain
They see me in the field, they panic
Dip up your chest, turn cabbage
Swing with force, I'm a savage
I turned your chest to damage
Big boy, you know you can't

Step 'round there for your captain
Back my blade, let him have it (woi)
They see me in the field, they panic
Watch them run off and vanish (mhm)
Dip up your chest, turn cabbage
Swing with force, I'm a savage
I turned your chest to damage
Big boy you know you can't manage (grrt-bow)
Step 'round there for your captain
Back my blade, let him have it (woi)
They see me in the field, they panic
Watch them run off and vanish (mhm)
Dip up your chest, turn cabbage
Swing with force, I'm a savage
I turned your chest to damage
Big boy you know you can't manage (grrt-bow)

Birdseye view when I hit it with the mash
But I ain't tryna free the villains
Three, two, one, hop out the whip now watch them run
They panic when they see me in person like, "Yo he's coming"
You know that I love you bro
But I ain't tryna hold you on it (no way)
Cock-a-doodle doo
Excuse me miss come ride this broom
Early morning settin'
The dick in my pants is calling you (mhm)
Wet her up in front of my paintbrush
I'll show you 'bout art attack (splash)
I'm gonna spank her bum 'til it's black and blue
She loves it when it gets like that
Deepthroat with her lips on my whistle
Come gimme a tune (blow that)
Deepthroat when she blows on my flute
Deepthroat with her lips on my whistle (blow that)
Come gimme a tune
Deepthroat when she blows on my flute

Step 'round there for your captain
Back my blade, let him have it (woi)
They see me in the field, they panic
Watch them run off and vanish (mhm)
Dip up your chest, turn cabbage
Swing with force, I'm a savage
I turned your chest to damage
Big boy you know you can't manage (grrt-bow)
Step 'round there for your captain
Back my blade, let him have it (woi)
They see me in the field, they panic
Watch them run off and vanish (mhm)
Dip up your chest, turn cabbage
Swing with force, I'm a savage
I turned your chest to damage
Big boy you know you can't manage (grrt-bow)

The way that she threw it back
I nearly lost my breath
Bend it over start twerking
Now clap for the NHS (clap that)
And again, and again
How do man like this skeng?
If I'm doing you up and your kids starts screwing
I'm kicking it right out the pram (yes, I am)
Oh damn
And I don't give a toss about civilians
I'll also do up your nan
If I swing this wap like Orangutan
Suttin's getting dropped or blammed
What, what, what the hell are you thinking?
I get real close efficient
Serious damage, ruthless dippings
Anytime I back this kitchen
I told my young g's step on the glide
Swing that blade and dip him
If I lift this mash ima drop him
Don't think you're the undertaker
You won't rise back from the coffin

Step 'round there for your captain
Back my blade, let him have it (woi)
They see me in the field, they panic
Watch them run off and vanish (mhm)
Dip up your chest, turn cabbage
Swing with force, I'm a savage
I turned your chest to damage (Hargo Production)
Big boy you know you can't manage (grrt-bow)
Step 'round there for your captain
Back my blade, let him have it (woi)
They see me in the field, they panic
Watch them run off and vanish (mhm)
Dip up your chest, turn cabbage
Swing with force, I'm a savage
I turned your chest to damage
Big boy you know you can't manage (grrt-bow)
