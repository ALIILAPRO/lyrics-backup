		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dear Haley, can you save me from
The borrowed cloud I'm on?
All you gotta do is try
Pray you're just getting by
Hey wait, I thought you made it
How'd your bottled crown fall off
Tell me how'd you get so tired
Faded down to the wire

Try livin' a lie
And kickin' out the same old guise
Wastin' time

So very ordinary
Wait until my bomb goes off
See the actors run and hide
Fake it all in stride
One day we all can say we're gone
And haunt the ground we're from
Everything's so open wide
Here within the divide

Try livin' a lie
And kickin' out the same old guise
Wastin' time

Ain't it the life? Ain't it the life?
Ain't it the life? Got no crime
Just sail on by
Sail on by
Ain't it the life? Ain't it the life?
Ain't it the life? Got no crime
Just sail on by
Sail on by
Ain't it the life?
Just sail on by

Try livin' a lie
And kickin' out the same old guise
Wastin' time

Ain't it the life? Ain't it the life?
Ain't it the life? Got no crime
Just sail on by
Sail on by
Ain't it the life? Ain't it the life?
Ain't it the life? Got no crime
Just sail on by
Sail on by
Ain't it the life?
Ain't it the life?
