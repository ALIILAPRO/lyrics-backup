		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have you ever been to Heaven at night, night?
Have you ever been to Heaven at night?

Heaven at night
Have you ever been to Heaven at night?
Closing your eyes the feeling so right
At first you might see this one bright beam of light
Clutching your soul to the toll of the bright
Happy unites and feelings take flight
Blinds of the evils you give them no sight
Focus on floating, your focus is tight
Like you re-wrote an essay for a class
You pass in the night
Have you ever seen an image so nice?
You feel so free like you're high as a kite
Like how you feel if you drink some Bud Light
Followed by Jag
Models will smile then tilt their heads back
These are a few of the visions I like
Mixed in with light
These are my favorites to dream in the night
This is my Heaven at night

Have you (have you)
Ever been to Heaven at night? (Ever been to Heaven at night?)
Heaven at night (Heaven at night)
Oh, have you (have you)
Ever been to Heaven at night? (Ever been to Heaven at night?)
Heaven at night (Heaven at night)

Man, oh (man)
I need what the world can't give me (can't give me)
Can't give me
Man, oh (man)
I see what the world can't show me (can't show me)
Can't show me
Dawg, oh (dawg)
I like what the world can't give me (can't give me)
Can't give me
Dawg, oh (dawg)
I sing it but the world can't hear me (can't hear me)
Can't hear me (can't hear me)

(Heaven at night)
(Heaven at night)

Have you (have you)
Ever been to Heaven at night? (Ever been to Heaven at night?)
Heaven at night (Heaven at night)
Oh, have you (have you)
Ever been to Heaven at night? (Ever been to Heaven at night?)
Heaven at night (Heaven at night)
