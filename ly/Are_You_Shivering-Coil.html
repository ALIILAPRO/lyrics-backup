		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you shivering? Are you cold?
Are you bathed in silver or drowned in gold?
This dream's a vitality
With filaments as fine as a spider's web
Pour through your mouth
That pour through your mouth
O river of silver, O river of flowers
I lie down and shiver in your silver river
Out drips the last drop of this vital fluid
Our life has grown weary
The stars have grown old
Are you still shivering?
Are you still cold?
Are you loathsome tonight?
Does your madness shine bright?
Are you loathsome tonight?
In the oceans of the moon
Swimming squidlike and squalid
This bright moon is a liquid
The dark earth is a solid
This is moon music in the light of the moon
