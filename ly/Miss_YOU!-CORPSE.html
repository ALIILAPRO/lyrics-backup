		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna look like this, fuck
I don't wanna feel like this, fuck
Wish I didn't miss her so much
Knew that this would happen, fuck love

Break a mirror, yeah, fuckin' break a mirror
Glass shatter, gums bleed, off the fuckin' Everclear
Eyes red, mind race, fuckin' wish that you were here
I was really fucking hopin' it'd be different this year, uh

She optimistic, not me (don't come back)
No quiero estar aqu√≠
Woe is me, l'appel du vide
She still want me, c'est la vie
I can't even leave my place without hidin' my face
Just a glamorized desk job rottin' away
I ain't even got friends, feel like everyone's fake
Really prayin' for the day the reaper take me away

Break a mirror, yeah, fuckin' break a mirror
Glass shatter, gums bleed, off the fuckin' Everclear
Eyes red, mind race, fuckin' wish that you were here
I was really fucking hopin' it'd be different this year, uh

I don't wanna look like this, fuck
I don't wanna feel like this, fuck
Wish I didn't miss her so much
Knew that this would happen, fuck love
(Knew that this would happen, fuck love)
