		  Louis Therroux
Duke & Jones
Jiggle, jiggle

My money don't jiggle, jiggle, it folds
I like to see you wiggle, wiggle, for sure
It makes me want to dribble, dribble, you know
Riding in my Fiat, you really have to see it
Six feet two in a compact, no slack
But luckily the seats go back
I got a knack to relax in my mind
Sipping some red, red wine

Shephard's bush, my compact push
Notting Hill gate, my Fiat skates
With a crate of cabernet, but not today
Because I gotta drive, I wanna stay alive
Not 'cause it's illicit, do I have to get explicit?
As a matter of fact, I sip on the 'Yac
With Big and Reece, 200 diamonds in their piece
I'm trying to get mine, so I can shine

Jiggle, jiggle
I like to see you wiggle, wiggle
Jiggle, jiggle
I like to see you wiggle, wiggle

My money don't jiggle, jiggle, it folds
I like to see you wiggle, wiggle, for sure
It makes me want to dribble, dribble, you know
Riding in my Fiat, you really have to see it
Six feet two in a compact, no slack
But luckily the seats go back
I got a knack to relax in my mind
Sipping some red, red wine

I think that went really well, don't you?
I enjoyed it, nice being in the booth
So, unless you have anything else, that's a wrap
(Jiggle, jiggle, I like to see you wiggle, wiggle)
(Jiggle, jiggle, I like to see you wiggle, wiggle)
