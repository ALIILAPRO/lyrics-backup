		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never thought I'd ever need you around
It's hard enough to be me only
Never thought I'd die for a sound
Hype it up but make it lonely

What about you?
What about you?
Bout you? 'Bout you? 'Bout you?
Makes me less miserable
What about you?
'Bout you? 'Bout you?
'Bout you? Yeah

'Cause I don't want to be alone tonight
Then nobody ever does
I don't want to think I missed a party
Then I go and I hate everyone
So find somebody, and love somebody
Kill somebody, start again
I don't want to be alone tonight

I figured out that I can drive on my knee
Everything's about the timing
Always thought I'd get to the sea
Drown myself but make it violent

What about me?
What about me?
'Bout me? 'Bout me? 'Bout me?
Is something you wanna keep
What about me?
'Bout me? 'Bout me?
'Bout me? Yeah

'Cause I don't want to be alone tonight
Then nobody ever does
I don't want to think I missed a party
Then I go and I hate everyone
So find somebody, and love somebody
Kill somebody, start again
I don't want to be alone tonight

Hearts were breaking
Earth was shaking
I was thinking, I should go
Earth was shaking
Hearts were breaking
I was thinking
