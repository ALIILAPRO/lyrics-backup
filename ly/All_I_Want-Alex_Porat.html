		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All I want is nothing more
To hear you knocking at my door
'Cause if I could see your face once more
I could die a happy man, I'm sure

When you said your last goodbye
I died a little bit inside
I lay in tears in bed all night
Alone without you by my side

But If you loved me
Why'd you leave me?

Take my body
Take my body
All I want is
And all I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody
Like you
Ooh oh
Ooh oh
Ooh oh

So you brought out the best in me
A part of me I've never seen
You took my soul and wiped it clean
Our love was made for movie screens

But if you loved me
Why'd you leave me?
Take my body
Take my body
All I want is
And all I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody
Like you
Ooh oh
Ooh oh
Ooh oh
