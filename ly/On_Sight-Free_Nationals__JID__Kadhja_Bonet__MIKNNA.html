		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know it's fade on sight
If you don't come right
You know it's fade on sight
If you don't come right

Baby come over, this shit ain't over
Baby I want your love you know I need it (know I need it)
Baby come over, this shit ain't over
Baby I want your love you know I need it (know I need it)

Could it be
Nobody knows you baby (ahhh ooh)
Not before, but now I want more
Yeah I want you baby
Could it feel the same
Though if I know a sacred thing
'Cause we can't take it back no more
Never the same, but we can go on
'Cause I just want to be your baby

Baby come over, this shit ain't over
Baby I want your love you know I need it (know I need it)
Baby come over, this shit ain't over
Baby I want your love you know I need it (know I need it)

You know it's fade on sight
If you don't come right
Gonna catch this flight
It was love at first sight

Uh, yeah, uh look
Well I get nervous anytime I see you babe
It really hurts me every time you go
I think your perfect 
But you won't believe me if I said it to the world
Would you let everybody know
I was just getting worried
That maybe you feel the way I do
Maybe you don't, lately I've been on the move
And it feel likes an episode 
From a show where I don't really know who's the leading role
But rolling with a leader
Isn't easy just believe me
On God I can see it 
Hope you send me a preist to exercise my demons
Maybe a shrink will probably get 
A blink of what I'm thinking
I've been smoking, I've been drinking
And I'm hoping you can see me
If you saw me tell me if you see him
I really need her, I've only got a two-seater
My car don't go in reverse, don't wanna leave her
Never see her, if I don't heart stinger
Steve Irwin, she hurt me, E.R.

Baby come over, this shit ain't over
Baby I want your love you know I need it (know I need it)
Baby come over, this shit ain't over
Baby I want your love you know I need it (know I need it)

You know it's fade on sight
If you don't come right
You know it's fade on sight
If you don't come right

You know it's fade on sight
If you don't come right
Gonna catch this flight
It was love at first sight

You know it's fade on sight
If you don't come right
Gonna catch this flight
