		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In life nothing's certain
You'll never know when it'll happen
Some burn out while some fade away
It doesn't matter we're heading that way

If I had the time
I'll spend it with you

Time gets you old and weary
Like a lifeless ordinary
Some burn out while some fade away
I don't want you to go I want you to stay

If I could turn back the time
I'd spend it with you

CHORUS:
I want you to know even though you're gone
That I'm drowning in tears
I wish you were here and hear me say
Believe me, I'm sorry

Feels like everything is undone
Peace of mind still I haven't found
And time will heal those broken mends
I know it will come but when will it end

If I could turn back the time
I'd spend it with you

CHORUS

I want you to know, I want you to know
I want you to know

If I could turn back the time
I'd spend it with you

CHORUS 2x
