		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tho' the days are long, 
Twilight sings a song, 
Of the happiness that used to be; 
Soon my eyes will close, 
Soon I'll find repose, 
And in dreams you're always near to me. 
 
[Chorus]
I'll See You In My Dreams 
Hold you in my dreams, 
Someone took you out of my arms, 
Still I feel the thrill of your charms, 
Lips that once were mine, 
Tender eyes that shine, 
They will light my way tonight, 
I'll See You In My Dreams.
