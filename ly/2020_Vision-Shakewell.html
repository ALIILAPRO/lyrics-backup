		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just got some Cartiers, I don't need prescriptions
Slidin' off a Perky, still got 20/20 vision
I ain't even need those, did it for the fuck of it
Big Juice off a 30, how he never mumblin'
Function was a day ago, I'm still faded
Made that track a year ago, it still pay me
I'ma pour the whole thing, lean got me lazy
I'ma use the same bar, lean got me lazy

Shorty trappin' off the premium, how else she gon' eat?
Told me I should go and "at" her, said for daddy it's free
I can never save a ho, no that shit ain't for me
Said I'm tryna see you shine, got her new Louboutin, oh my god
Shake off the Percs so I'm breakin' her jaw
LAPD, swear I'm breakin' the law (oh no)
District attorney want see me in bars (they do)
Pay off my lawyer, I'm prayin' to God
She might not talk back now, fuck around and black out
Get a bad batch and nod
Grab the Glock and spazz out, cappin' in my trap house
Turn this shit to Vietnam

I just got some Cartiers, I don't need prescriptions
Slidin' off a Perky, still got 20/20 vision
I ain't even need those, did it for the fuck of it
Big Juice off a 30, how he never mumblin'
Function was a day ago, I'm still faded
Made that track a year ago, it still pay me
I'ma pour the whole thing, lean got me lazy
I'ma use the same bar, lean got me lazy
