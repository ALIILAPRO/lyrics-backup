		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come they told me pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
A newborn king to see pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
Our finest gifts we bring pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum

Peace on Earth, can it be? (Come they told me pa-rum-pum-pum-pum)
Years from now, perhaps we'll see? (A newborn king to see pa-rum-pum-pum-pum)
See the day of glory (our finest gift we bring pa-rum-pum-pum-pum)
See the day, when men of good will (to lay before the king pa-rum-pum-pum-pum)
Live in peace, live in peace again (rum-pum-pum-pum)
Peace on Earth (so to honor him pa-rum-pum-pum-pum)
Can it be (when we come)

Every child must be made aware
Every child must be made to care
Care enough for his fellow man
To give all the love that he can

I pray my wish will come true (little baby pa-rum-pum-pum-pum)
For my child and your child too (I stood beside him there pa-rum-pum-pum-pum)
He'll see the day of glory (I played my drum for him pa-rum-pum-pum-pum)
See the day when men of good will (I played my best for him pa-rum-pum-pum-pum)
Live in peace, live in peace again (rum-pum-pum-pum)
Peace on Earth (then he smiled at me pa-rum-pum-pum-pum)
Can it be (me and my drum)

Can it be
