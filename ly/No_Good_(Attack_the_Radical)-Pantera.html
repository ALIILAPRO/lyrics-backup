		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the states there's a problem with race 
Because of ignorant past burned fires 
From evolution we've been killing each other 
I figure man should have it down to a science 

No chance 
Not for a minute 
Not for a second 
I won't be defensive 
I'm straight out in my opinion 
You'd better listen to a man who knows what he is saying 
I've seen your side 
You run and hide for the mere fact that you feel inferior 
Be superior 
And know your interior 

Race, pride, prejudice 
Black man, white man 
No stand 
Live in the past 
We make it last 
A hated mass 
No solution 
Mind pollution 
For revolution 

So low behold my eyes 
This land of fools will rise 
No good 
For no one
You're no good 
For no one

You blame oppression and play the role of criminals 
To rape and burn show progress is minimal 
White hoods and militants you know it's such a pity 
Living, breathing 
Violence in your city 

If one man 
Had one home 
In one world 
Held live alone without variety 
Full of anxiety 
No one to point at, question 
Or even talk to in his private grave 
No matter what color 
He wouldn't be saved from hell 
He dwells 
A closed mind playing the part of prison cells 

Race, pride, prejudice 
Black man, white man 
No stand 
Live in the past 
We make it last 
A hated mass 
No solution 
Mind pollution 
For revolution 

So low behold my eyes 
This land of fools will rise 
No good 
For no one
You're no good 
For no one

So low behold your eyes 
This land of fools will rise 
No good 
For no one
You're no good 
For no one
Ooh
