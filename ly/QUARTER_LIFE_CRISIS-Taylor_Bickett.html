		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm terrified of rejection
But I get high off attention
I drink my coffee light 'cause I'm not fucking pretentious
Say that I read for fun
But haven't read in months
Say that I'm settling down
But I blacked out at brunch

I swear sixteen was yesterday
But now I'm closer to twenty-eight
I'm focusing all of my energy on just staying awake

Oh, I don't need to keep
Making it about me
Everybody feels like this at twenty-three
I know I'm not unique
But I'm a drama queen
I don't why I'm surprised
It's just a quarter life crisis

I'm constantly symptomatic
Mom says it's psychosomatic
That I'm the girl that cried headache
I'm melodramatic as hell
Where's all the talent that I had last decade
Another gifted kid that burned out in the tenth grade

Swear that feels like yesterday
I'm just a tired old clich√©
I'm focusing all of my energy on just being okay

Oh, I don't need to keep
Making it about me
Everybody feels like this at twenty-three
I know I'm not unique
But I'm a drama queen
I don't why I'm surprised
It's just a quarter life crisis
Oh, oh-oh
It's just a quarter life crisis

And I just found out
That someone from my high school is dead
And another one is married with a kid
And the rest are all lying on the internet
I fall for it every time
It feels like that falling behind

I don't need to keep
Making it about me
Everybody feels like this at twenty-three
I know I'm not unique
But I'm a drama queen
Oh-oh
I don't need to keep
Making it about me
Everybody feels like this at twenty-three
I know I'm not unique
But I'm a drama queen
I don't why I'm surprised
It's just a quarter life
Everybody feels like this
It's a quarter life
I don't why I'm surprised
It's just a quarter life crisis
