		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm still checking your location
Imagine our bed with you and her
Still look at pictures when we dated
Now I see a girl that's at her worst

My head is under water
Drowning in my panic attacks
I'm sick of suffocating in my tears

One day, I'll be stronger
Through all the self-sabotage
Suffering through my toxic thoughts that I let carry on
But in this moment
God, this really hurts like hell
But I know I'll thank these lonesome nights that led
Led me to myself

I finally threw away your sweaters (sweaters)
I'm going out and moving on (on)
In fact, I haven't cried about you in forever
Yeah, forever's but a week of being strong

I'm running through the darkness
Trying to get my old self back
I'm sick of suffocating in my tears

One day, I'll be stronger
Through all the self-sabotage
Suffering through my toxic thoughts that I let carry on
But in this moment
God, this really hurts like hell
But I know I'll thank these lonesome nights that led
Led me to myself

Led me to myself
Led me to myself

'Cause I make myself stronger
Through all the self-sabotage
Suffering through my toxic thoughts that I let carry on
But in this moment
God, this really hurts like hell
But I know I'll thank these lonesome nights that led
Led me to myself
