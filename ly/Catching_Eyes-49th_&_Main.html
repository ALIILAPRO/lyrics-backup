		  ‘Catching Eyes’ – Lyrics
Verse 1
The night is young, but so am I
Ain’t gone be here too long, best enjoy the ride
Gonna bust my moves, see what I find
Gonna get my drinks in now, lose track of time
Pre-chorus
‘Cus when you move like that it ain’t easy
I can’t keep up now take it slow
And back and forth through the dancefloor got hazy
And just before I let go, yeah she say
Chorus
If catching eyes is foreplay
Then we done fucked around
And maybe it’s the DJ 
Addicted to the sound
And she say
Verse 2
Attraction growing deeper
Yeah damn this girl is fine
And we don’t have to say words
Yeah just keep that in mind
Pre-chorus
‘Cus when you move like that it ain’t easy
I can’t keep up now take it slow
And back and forth through the dancefloor got hazy
And just before I let go, yeah she say


Chorus
If catching eyes is foreplay
Then we done fucked around
And maybe it’s the DJ 
Addicted to the sound
And she say
Pre-chorus
‘Cus when you move like that it ain’t easy
I can’t keep up now take it slow
And back and forth through the dancefloor got hazy
And just before I let go, yeah she say
Chorus
If catching eyes is foreplay
Then we done fucked around
And maybe it’s the DJ 
Addicted to the sound
And she say
