		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tay Keith, this too hard (Tay Keith, this too hard)
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up!)

I don't got a heart, but fuck it, I'm paid
Lil A beat a body he fresh out the cage
I'm still the same nigga from minimum wage
They tryna keep up so they stalkin' my page
They do what I say, they tryna get saved
They line up for me like they coppin the J's
I told her get right, start actin' your age
Can't believe you tried it

Bitch, you played
Wanted a diamond choker soon as her time was over
Bitch, you played
She wanna ride the Rover, told her her Uber was closer
Bitch, you crazy
She tried to show out in public, I cut the bitch off like it's nothin'
Bitch, you played
She must've thought I was stupid, I knew she was fuckin' my cousin (ooh)

I don't got a cold, I'm sippin' on Hi-Tek
A deuce of that yellow, I'm straight out the projects
The first nigga play with me, he got shot at
A hunnid some shots flipped the car, that's a car wreck
I really don't need to be speakin' on that
But fuck it, you know how it be when I get (what?)
How high off the mothafuckin' medicals (up there)
Get in the booth and go federal (federal)
They copied my style, I had to go get that (gimme that)
Like boy gimme my mothafuckin' shit back
She wanna chill but this ain't no kick back
Pass her to my teammate, I assist that
Straight to the jet then I'm gone (gone)
Land in a new time zone (outta there)
All the hoes pressed, niggas lookin' stressed
They can't accept that I'm on (ha)

I don't got a heart, but fuck it, I'm paid
Lil A beat a body he fresh out the cage
I'm still the same nigga from minimum wage
They tryna keep up so they stalkin' my page
They do what I say, they tryna get saved
They line up for me like they coppin the J's
I told her get right, start actin' your age
Can't believe you tried it

Bitch, you played
Wanted a diamond choker soon as her time was over
Bitch, you played
She wanna ride the Rover, told her her Uber was closer
Bitch, you crazy (crazy)
She tried to show out in public, I cut the bitch off like it's nothin'
Bitch, you played (yeah)
She must've thought I was stupid, I knew she was fuckin' my cousin
Bitch, you played

She out here wildin'
Tellin' her friends I'm buyin' her, flyin' her
Bitch, you childish
I never mind 'em, I'm gettin' mine
I'm one of the flyest, got no stylist
Pop my shit, Rolls Truck my driveway
Racks like books, I ain't been to no college
VS my teeth I come through smilin'
Brand new Lamb' we come through wilin'
Couldn't get it up, now this shit jus' pilin'
Everybody drip, turn the hood to a island
Last name Rich first name not Roddy
That ain't my hit, can't claim that body
That ain't my ho, damn sure ain't my side bitch
Wish I would take the lil' ho shoppin'
Soon as I do it, this foreign I'm coppin'
Still in the hood, I could never get cocky

I don't got a heart, but fuck it, I'm paid
Lil A beat a body he fresh out the cage
I'm still the same nigga from minimum wage
They tryna keep up so they stalkin' my page
They do what I say, they tryna get saved
They line up for me like they coppin the J's
I told her get right, start actin' your age
Can't believe you tried it

Bitch, you played
Wanted a diamond choker soon as her time was over
Bitch, you played
She wanna ride the Rover, told her her Uber was closer
Bitch, you crazy
She tried to show out in public, I cut the bitch off like it's nothin'
Bitch, you played
She must've thought I was stupid, I knew she was fuckin' my cousin
Bitch, you played
