		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was just another day
It was just another fight
It was words strung into sentences
It was doomed to not be right
There is something wrong with me
There is something wrong with you
There is nothing left of us
There is one thing I can do
Lying on your bed, examining my head
This is the part of me that hates
Paybacks are a bitch, I throw the switch
Somewhere the electric chair awaits

Hey! this was my life
Hey! this was my fate

This was the wrong thing to do
This was the wrong one to be doing
This was the road to destiny
This was the road to my ruin
Now there's motives for the suspect
Now there's nothing left to say
Now there's method to the madness
Now there's society to pay

Lying on your bed, examining my head
This is the part of me that hates
Paybacks are a bitch, I throw the switch
Somewhere the electric chair awaits

Hey! this was my life
Hey! this was my fate

In our life there's if
In our beliefs there's lie
In our business there's sin
In our bodies there's die
This was my life
This was my fate

This was my life
This was my fate
