		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On a hot summer night
Would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?
Will he offer me his mouth?

Yes

Will he offer me his teeth?

Yes

Will he offer me his jaws?

Yes

Will he offer me his hunger?

Yes

Again, will he offer me his hunger?

Yes!

And will he starve without me?

Yes!

And does he love me?

Yes

Yes

On a hot summer night
Would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?

Yes

I bet you to say that to all the boys.

It was a hot summer night and the beach was burning
There was fog crawling over the sand
And when I listened to your heart I hear the whole world turning
I see the shooting stars, falling through your trembling hands

While you were licking your lips and your lipstick shining
And I was dying just to ask for a taste
Oh we were lying together in a silver lining
By the light of the moon you know there's not another moment
Not another moment
Not another moment to waste

Oh will you hold me so close that my knees grow weak.
But my soul is flying high above the ground.
I'm trying to speak but no matter what I do
I just can't seem to make any sound.

And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh and I swear it's true, I was just about to say I love you.

(Love you)

And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh and I swear it's true, I was just about to say I love you.

Now my body is shaking like a wave on the water
And I guess that I'm beginning to grin.
Oh we're finally alone and we can do what we want
Oh the night is young and ain't no-one gonna know where you
No-one gonna know where you
No-one's gonna know where you've been.
You were licking your lips and your lipstick shining.
I was dying just to ask for a taste.
We were lying together in a silver lining
By the the light of the moon,
You know there's not another moment to waste

And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh and I swear it's true, I was just about to say I love you

(Love you)

And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh and I swear it's true, I was just about to say I love you.

(Love you)

And then you took the words right out of my mouth oh
(It must have been while you were kissing)

You took the words right out of my mouth oh
(It must have been while you were kissing)

You took the words right out of my mouth oh
(It must have been while you were kissing)

You took the words right out of my mouth oh
(It must have been while you were kissing)

You took the words right out of my mouth oh
(It must have been while you were kissing)

You took the words right out of my mouth oh
You took the words right out of my mouth oh
You took the words right out of my mouth
Whoa it must have been while you were kissing me

You took the words right out of my mouth
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me

You took the words right out of my mouth
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me

You took the words right out of my mouth
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me
