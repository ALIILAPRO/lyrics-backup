		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eyes flash in the dark
Can I give you a hit for your pinball heart?
It's not heaven, but it's a start
So lightly we tread
You were callin' me up from your hospital bed
Now we're doing it all, again

It's the beat in your chest
It's the smoke on your breath

As the dopamine begins to light your eyes
There's nothing but the dust and dirt to keep us up tonight
And my heart is singing, screaming, "I'm alive"
Oh, darling, if we end it all at least you're by my side
But we can never die

But we can never die
But we can never die
But we can never die

You dance sugar sweet
Wearing nothing but furs and the shoes on your feet
Who knows when we'll meet, again
And it's always the same
See, the drink couldn't wash out the taste of your name
Please tell me it's not the end

It's the beat in you chest
It's the smoke on your breath

As the dopamine begins to light your eyes
There's nothing but the dust and dirt to keep us up tonight
And my heart is singing, screaming, "I'm alive"
Oh, darling, if we end it all at least you're by my side
But we can never die
But we can never die

But we can never die
But we can never die
But we can never die

But we can never die
