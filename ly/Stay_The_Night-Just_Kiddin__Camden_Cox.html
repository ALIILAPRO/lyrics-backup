		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I like your face, so baby why don't you come around?
It's getting rainy, maybe we could sleep on the couch
Let's order something that can fulfill your appetite
Stay the night

Then in the morning we can listen to pillow talk
When we get lazy, I'll take you to the carnival
Just don't go home, oh baby, I'll be your alibi
Stay the night

Just gtay the ni-i-ight
Ni-ight
Just stay the ni-i-ight
Ni-ight
(Just stay the night, oh baby)
(Just stay the night, oh baby)
(Just stay the night, oh baby)
(Just stay the night, oh baby)
(Stay the night)

I like your face, so baby why don't you come around?
It's getting rainy, maybe we could sleep on the couch
Just don't go home, oh baby, I'll be your alibi
Stay the night

Just gtay the ni-i-ight
Ni-ight
Just stay the ni-i-ight
Ni-ight
(Stay the night)

(Stay the night)
(Stay the night)
Just stay the
(Stay the night)
(Stay the night)
Stay the night

Then in the morning we can listen to pillow talk
When we get lazy, I'll take you to the carnival
Just don't go home, oh baby, I'll be your alibi
Stay the night

Just gtay the ni-i-ight
Ni-ight
Just stay the ni-i-ight
Ni-ight
(Just stay the night, oh baby)
(Just stay the night, oh baby)
(Just stay the night, oh baby)
(Just stay the night, oh baby)
(Stay the night)
