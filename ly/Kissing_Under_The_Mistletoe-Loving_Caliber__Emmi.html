		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's go outside, the snow is falling down
And every child is having so much fun
The snowman is twice the size as me
And with the smile as quirky as mine
We're holding hands to keep each other warm
While we stand and watch the choir performing
And all the Christmas songs that we love
Yeah, all the Christmas songs that we love

And in a while we're gonna go inside
And drink hot chocolate by the fire
'Cause all I want is to spend this day with you

Let me give you a Christmas
Moment we'll fill with love and joy
Mm, mm, so beautiful kissing under mistletoes, baby, with you (woo-hoo)
I don't need any presents
As long as I spend this day with you
Mm, mm, so beautiful kissing under mistletoes, baby, with you, woo-hoo

We're making plans and what we're gonna do
I feel so blessed that I can be with you
'Cause God knows that I've been longing for
Yeah, I just wanna hold you close
You know the stars are shining just for you
Let's take a walk and we can follow the moon
Until we reach the place we could stay
Maybe kiss a bit and dream away

And in a while we're gonna go inside
And drink hot chocolate by the fire
'Cause all I want is to spend this day with you

Let me give you a Christmas
Moment we'll fill with love and joy
Mm, mm, so beautiful kissing under mistletoes, baby, with you (woo-hoo)
I don't need any presents
As long as I spend this day with you
Mm, mm, so beautiful kissing under mistletoes, baby, with you, woo-hoo

Woo, hoo, woo
Woo, ooh, hoo
Ooh-hoo

And in a while we're gonna go inside
And drink hot chocolate by the fire
'Cause all I want is to spend this day with you

Let me give you a Christmas
Moment we'll fill with love and joy (fill with love and joy)
Mm, mm, so beautiful kissing under mistletoes, baby, with you (with you, woo-hoo)
I don't need any presents
As long as I spend this day with you (with you)
Mm, mm, so beautiful kissing under mistletoes, baby, with you, woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
