		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So you think you got me figured out
Why don't you go ahead and tell me what I'm all about
You know I'm dying to hear it
I'm getting sick of all the sticks and stones you throw
Now it feels like it's an opinion overload
I can take it but but I'd rather leave it

Get out of my face
Quit bringing' me down
I don't care what you say

So part of that about that don't you understand?
Hey!
I'm doing things exactly like I want to
What part of that that don't understand?
Hey!
And I don't give a damn if you don't approve
What part of that that don't you understand?
Hey!

You're so tough, you throw punches with your words
You think you're clever, let me tell you you're not the first
Say something I haven't heard yet
You're disrespectful, always quick to judge
I'm kinda wondering if you're doing it just because
It must be nice being perfect

Get out of my face
Quit bringing me down
I don't care what you say

So part of that about that don't you understand?
Hey!
I'm doing things exactly like I want to
What part of that that don't understand?
Hey!
And I don't give a damn if you don't approve
What part of that that don't you understand?
Hey!

I won't apologize
For what I feel inside
I won't be pushed around
I won't be backing down
Not doing what you say
I'll never change my ways
Get out of my face

Hey!
I'm doing things exactly like I want to
What part of that that don't understand?
Hey!
And I don't give a damn if you don't approve
What part of that that don't you understand?
Hey!

(I won't apologize for what I feel inside)
What part of that that don't you understand?
Hey!
(Not doing what you say, I'll never change my ways)
What part of that that don't you understand?
