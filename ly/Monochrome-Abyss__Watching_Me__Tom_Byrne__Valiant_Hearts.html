		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The noose is getting tight around your neck
And every day's the same
Stuck, you're suffocating in your sleep
And there's no miracle to come
As you're embracing your demise

A piece of paper on the counter
Only ten or fifteen words
To express the desperation
And remind them who you were

First you take a breath
You take a step
Are you sure you can take it no more?

Watch the sun from the shadows
Ghostly reach, it's so
Distant, yet so close
Watch the sun from the shadows
The rendered picture's so bleak
So monochrome

The choice is made
Getting ready to execute yourself
But these questions still remain

Why am I stuck here waiting?
Why do I expect something more?
And is there more at all?

So you took a breath
You made that step
You are sure you can take it no more

Watch the sun from the shadows
Ghostly reach, it's so
Distant, yet so close
Watch the sun from the shadows
The rendered picture's so bleak
So monochrome

Your arms are broken branches
Your heart - a dying coal
A single tear in the corner of your eye
But why? But why?
Life was just around the corner
There to pay you a surprise
Time would change it for the better
If you only had the time

Watch the sun from the shadows
Ghostly reach, it's so
Distant, yet so close
Watch the sun from the shadows
The rendered picture's so bleak
So monochrome
