		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (What they do)

(They smilin' in your face)
All the time they want to take your place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)
(They smilin' in your face)
All the time, they want to take your place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)

All you fellas who have someone and you really care, yeah, yeah
Then it's all of you fellas who better beware, yeah, yeah

Somebody's out to get your lady
A few of your buddies, they sure look shady
The blades are long, clenched tight in their fists
Aimin' straight at your back
And I don't think they'll miss

(What they do)

(They smilin' in your face)
All the time, they want to take your place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)
I keep gettin' all these visits from my friends, yeah
what they doin' to me?
They come to my house again and again and again and again, yeah
So are they there to see my woman?
I don't even be home but they just keep on comin'
What can I do to get on the right track?
I wish they'd take some of these knives out my b-b-b-back

(What they do)

(They smilin' in your face)
All the time, they want to take your place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)
Ha, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, low down, dirty

(What they do)

(They smilin' in your face)
Smilin' faces, smilin' faces sometimes (back stabbers)
tell lies
(They smilin' in your face)
I don't need low down, dirty bastards (back stabbers)

down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Might be your neighbors (they smilin' in your face) 
Your next door neighbor, yeah
They smilin' in your face
