		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I heard she sang a good song
I heard she had a style
And so I came to see her
To listen for a while

And there she was this young girl
A stranger to my eyes

Strummin' my pain with her fingers
Singin' my life with her words
Killing me softly with her song
Killing me softly, with her song
Telling my whole life with her words
Killing me softly, with her song

I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt she found my letters
And read each one aloud

I prayed that she would finish
But she just kept right on

Strummin' my pain with her fingers
Singin' my life with her words
Killing me softly with her song
Killing me softly, with her song
Telling my whole life with her words
Killing me softly, with her song

She sang as if she knew me
In all my dark despair
And then she looked right through me
As if I wasn't there

But she was there, this stranger
Singing clear and strong

Strummin' my pain with her fingers
Singin' my life with her words
Killing me softly with her song
Killing me softly, with her song
Telling my whole life with her words
Killing me softly, with her song

Killing me softly, with her song
