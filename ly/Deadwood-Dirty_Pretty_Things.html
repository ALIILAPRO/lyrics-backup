		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You got the world boy 

This all you make it? 
You had the choice lad 
You wouldnt take it 
The oldest charm 

Only the best for you 

And the years of my life, 
Some they were so good, 
But now and again I feel 
I was a coward 
Are the holes in my soul 
In tatters for all these tears 
Well you dont see it that way 

A way, a way 

We'lll have it today 

The dancing ones they really mean it 

But something boy, 
somethings gonna change 

A way, a way 

Youve got it they say 
How do they know 
When theyve never seen it? 

And what will you do 
When they forget your name? 

Well you'll up and get another one 

Don't give me that face 
I know when I should live in disgrace 
Not dig up the deadwood 
I knew this place was never the place for me 

And of the years that rolled by 
Yeah some were so good 
But now I know that 
You were the coward 
The holes in your soul 
In tatters for all these years 

But you cant see it that way 

A way, a way 

Well have it today 
The dancing ones they really mean it 
And mark my words 
Something's gonna change 

A way, a way 
Youve got it they say 
But how do they know 
When theyve never seen it? 
And what will you do 
When they forget your name? 

Well you'll up and get another one 

A way, a way 
We'll have it today 
The dancing ones they really mean it 
But something boy 
somethings gonna change 

A way, a way 
Youve got it today 
But how do they know 
When theyve never seen it? 
And what will you do 
When they forget your name? 

Well you'll up and get another one
