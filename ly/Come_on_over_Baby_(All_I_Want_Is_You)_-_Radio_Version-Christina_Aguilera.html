		  Come on over, come on over, baby
Come on over, come on over, baby (here we go, uh, uh)
Come on over, come on over, baby (that's right)
Come on over (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Come on over, baby

Hey, boy, don't you know
I got something going on (yeah, come on)
I got an invitation
Don't you keep me waiting all night long (yeah)

I know, you know (you know)
So baby, don't
Pretend you won't (pretend you won't)
Keep me guessing with ya
You will or you won't
Don't want to play that game with ya, baby
So listen to me

(All I want is you)
Come over here, baby
(All I want is you)
You know you make me go crazy
(All I want is you)
Now baby, don't be shy
You better cross the line
I'm gonna love you right 'cause
All I want is you

Come on over (that's right)
Come on over, baby (oh, yeah, yeah)
Come on over, come on over, baby

I'm not just talking about your sexuality
(Your sexuality)
But I can't help myself
When you put your hands on me, oh, oh
(When you put your hands on me)

It's paradise (it's paradise)
When you and I
Get close, skin tight (uh, uh, uh)
When I want, I wanna
Go on all night (all night)
I want to play that game with ya, baby (oh yeah)
Listen to me

(All I want is you)
Come over here, baby
(All I want is you)
You know you make me go crazy (so crazy)
(All I want is you)
Now baby, don't be shy
You better cross the line
I'm gonna love you right 'cause
All I want is you

Come on over, come on over, baby (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Come on over, come on over, baby

Don't you want to be the one tonight?
We can do exactly what you like
Don't you want to be just you and me
We can do what comes so naturally
I gotta a thing for you
Got my mind made up (yeah)
And I'm serious, never been more, baby
Don't show it, but it's real (so sure)
And it's right here (come on)

Come on, come on, come on over (oh, yeah yeah yeah)
Come on, come on, come on over
Come on, come on, come on over
Come on, come on, come on over (hey, yeah)
Come on, come on, come on over
Come on, come on, come on over (you give me)

What a girl feels, what a girl likes
What a girl needs, what a girl wants

All I, All I want is you
Whoa, oh baby
(All I want is you)
Oh, you make me go crazy
(All I want is you)
Now baby, don't be shy
You better cross the line
I'm gonna love you right 'cause
All I want is you

(All I want is you)
Ooh, yeah, oh
(All I want is you)
Oh, you make me go crazy, ooh
(All I want is you)
Now baby, don't be shy
You better cross the line
I'm gonna love you right
'Cause all I want is you
