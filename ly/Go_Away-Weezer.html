		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cold hearted girl
Don't hurt me like this anymore
I'm waiting by outside your door
Saying, "Baby, can we talk?"

Stupid boy, you keep on begging but I won't let you in
You keep on crying but you know what you did
I'll never let you back in

You say, "Go away, go away"
Go away, go away, go away
Go away, go away, go away
Don't come back here anymore
Go away

I was wrong, I hurt your feelings when I did what I did
I learned my lesson I'll stop acting like a kid
Can you give me one more chance?

So I ask, what did she have that I don't have?
You said you'd stay but then you went away
That's why I'm telling you to go away

You say, "Go away, go away
Go away, go away, go away
Go away, go away, go away
Don't come back here anymore
Go away"

But my life is incomplete without you
And you miss the little things that I do
You do, won't you take me back
That was your last chance

Go away, go away
Go away, go away, go away
Go away, go away, go away
Don't come back here anymore
Go away
