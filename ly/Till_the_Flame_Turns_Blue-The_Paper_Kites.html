		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want to get back to you, baby
I want to get back to those times
When we used to go downtown and just
And we'd burn until the flame turned blue

So put on your dress and your makeup
We're gonna go out tonight
'Cause I've been thinking it's been a while
And why, oh, why, oh, why
We shouldn't just go out and
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) we could burn until the flame turns blue

I want to make you feel it one more time now
We could burn until the flame turns blue
Go ahead and burn now

(Ooh, ooh, ooh) we could burn until the flame turns blue

I know the seasons, they change
And you know what I mean
But we were born in the moonlight, baby
In the fire of a silver stream
So maybe we could just
We could burn until the flame turns blue

And I want to take you down that old street now, honey
And I want to make it just the same
'Cause we both know if we're still trying
We could burn until the flame turns blue
Go on and burn now, baby

(Ooh, ooh, ooh) we could burn, we could burn until that flame turns blue

'Til the flame turns blue
