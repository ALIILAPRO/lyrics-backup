		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Of all the money that e'er I spent
I spent it in good company
And of all the harm that e'er I've done
Alas, it was to none but me
For all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall

So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all

Oh, if I had money enough to spend
And leisure time to sit awhile
There is a fair maid in this town
Who surely has my heart beguiled
Her rosy cheeks and ruby lips
I own, she has my heart enthralled

So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all

Of all the comrades that e'er I've had
They are sorry for my going away
And of all the sweethearts that e'er I've had
Would wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call

Good night and joy be with you all
Good night and joy be with you all
