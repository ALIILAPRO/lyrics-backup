		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I drink 'til it's lost
Drinking words within
That spin down Pentecost
Kiss me with the fire of gods
Just say what you want
Say it out within
Without that funny little cough
Simple minded, simple talk

Don't start with your camouflage
Spurning from within, jump in
My red little fox
Rivers running through it all
So kiss me, as I am lost
Kiss me from within, jump in
My red little fox

Yellow paper folded off
My love, my queen
My broken dreams
Come save me

Kiss me like the wind
Now I sing it, won't you kiss me from within?
Now I sing it, won't you kiss me like the wind
That flows within your veins?

Let's not be for want
Wanting is a sin
I don't want anything at all

Yellow fever folded off
Let's drink 'til it's Pentecost
Drink unto the wind, jump in
My red little fox
Kiss me with the fire of gods
Let's scream 'til it's all forgot
Screaming words within that spin
Without any cost
Kiss me with the fire of gods

My love, my queen
My spoken dreams
Come save me

Kiss me like the wind
Now I sing it, won't you kiss me from within?
Now I sing it, won't you kiss me like the wind
That flows within your veins?
