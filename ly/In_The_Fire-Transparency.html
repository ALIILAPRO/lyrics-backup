		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I took a walk out of the grave
That's when You had called my name
And I stood still and I prayed
I know You have paved the way
It was then that I came alive
All my bones weren't dry
And I could sit here and cry at Your throne
I knew You were calling me home
Calling me home

You led me to the fire
The fire in your eyes
So keep me in the fire
The fire till I come alive
You led me to the fire
Where hearts are redesigned
So keep me in the fire
So I can be refined
In the fire of Your eyes

I took a stroll down memory lane
I saw Your hand in everything
And I stood still and I prayed
Take my life Lord have Your way
It was then that I came alive
I can see clearly through the lies
And I could sit here at your throne
I know God has called me His own
And He's calling me home

You brought me to the fire
So keep me in the fire
The fire till I come alive
You brought me to the fire
Where hearts are redesigned
So keep me in the fire
So I can be refined
In the fire of Your eyes

I'm falling for Your peace got me chasing You in my dreams, in my dreams
My heart's in full surrender
I can finally see all of Your peace
It's all around me, all around me

You led me to the fire
The fire in Your eyes
So keep me in the fire
The fire till I come alive
You led me to the fire so I can be refined
You brought me to the fire where hearts are redesigned
So keep me in the fire
The fire in Your eyes
So keep in the fire
Till I am redesigned
In the fire of Your eyes
