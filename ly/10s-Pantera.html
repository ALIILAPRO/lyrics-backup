		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My skin is cold
Transfusion with somebody
Morose and old
Drop into fruitless dying

It was tempting and bared
The whoring angel rising
Now burning prayers
My silent time of losing

My foes, they can't destroy my body
Colliding slow, like life itself

Long for the blur
We cannot dry much longer
Cement to dirt
Disgusted with my cheapness

My foes they can't destroy my body
Colliding slow, like life itself
My foes, my foes they can't destroy my body
Colliding slow, like life itself

My foes they can't destroy my body
Colliding slow, like life itself

My foes, my foes they can't destroy my body
Colliding slow, like life itself, like life itself
