		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you leave for certain
Will I know just when?
'Cos standing in theÂ crossroad seems like end of the affair
You said you were happy
I could have been a friend
The milky way was changing but the town remained the same
So wait
Wait
The minute that you walked away
I swear that I was moved by your charade
Hey
And now I know just what it feels
To get a taste of something that is real
If you would feel lonely
Write yourself a song
I mean you'll be on the East Coast so I'm sure it won't be long
Think about what's funny
Think about the high
When we shared different small talk on iconic pizza night
Wait
Wait
The minute that you walked away
I swear that I was moved by your charade
Hey
And now I know just what it feels
To get a taste of something that is real
Picturing the good life
Two days out of what
You gave me lots to think about
No longer can I die
So if you saw me walking
If you saw me cry
To be honest I'm just happy darling you were passing by
Yes
Yes
The minute that I tried to speak
I stuttered and I fell back into peace
If you know me
No I would never open up
To someone that just doesn't give a fuck
