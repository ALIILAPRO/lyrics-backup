		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Check this out

Tricky little Vicky walks along South Street
She learned her French from the boys that she'd meet, yeah
I gotta laugh when I hear them say
She's a sweet little cheese when the cat's away

I know what you been trying
But what you got ain't worth buying
Can't make living working door to door

Shake, shake, shake it like a rattlesnake
Boom, boom, baby, out go the lights
Shake, shake, shake it like a rattlesnake
Staying up late doing the rattlesnake shake

Juicy Miss Lucy always diggin' on junk
She's on the corner talkin' trash with the punks, yeah
Her buried treasure is so easy to see
'Cause talk is cheap and so is she

You're lost in search of passion
But Prince Charming ain't in fashion
So let it bleed if you wanna stay

Shake, shake, shake it like a rattlesnake
Boom, boom, baby, out go the lights
Shake, shake, shake it like a rattlesnake
Staying up late doing the rattlesnake shake
Whoa, shake it

Ooh, you make my rattlesnake shake when you do that shake, baby
Ooh, haha, I got a friend I wanna introduce you, yes, I do
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Shake, shake, shake it like a rattlesnake
Boom, boom, baby, out go the lights
Shake, shake, shake it like a rattlesnake
Staying up late doing the rattlesnake shake

Shake, shake, shake it like a rattlesnake
Boom, boom, baby, out go the lights
Shake, shake, shake it like a rattlesnake
Staying up late doing the rattlesnake shake
