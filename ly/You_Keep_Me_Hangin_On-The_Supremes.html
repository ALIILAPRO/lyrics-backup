		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Set me free why don't cha babe
Get out my life why don't cha babe
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
You don't really need me
But you keep me hangin' on

Why do you keep a comin' around playing with my heart?
Why don't cha get out of my life and let me make a new start?
Let me get over you the way you gotten over me, yeah

Set me free why don't cha babe
Let me be why don't you babe
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
No, you don't really want me
You just keep me hangin' on

You say although we broke up you still wanna be just friends
But how can we still be friends when seeing you only breaks my heart again
(And there ain't nothing I can do about it)

Whoa, ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa
Set me free why don't you babe
Get out, get out of my life
Why don't you babe
Set me free why don't you babe
Get out of my life
Why don't you babe

You claim you still care for me but your heart and soul needs to be free
And now that you've got your freedom you wanna still hold on to me
You don't want me for yourself so let me find somebody else

Why don't cha be a man about it and set me free
Now you don't care a thing about me
You're just using me

Go home, get out, get out of my life
And let me sleep at night
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on

You don't really need me
