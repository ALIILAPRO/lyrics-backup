		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's nobody here
There's nobody near
I try not to care
Dead eyes always stare

Let these matters be
(Don't trust what you see)
Take hold of your time
(Step into the line)

There's innocence torn from its maker
Stillborn, the trust in you
This failure has made the creator
So would you tell him what to do? 
(Would you?)

Leave your mark upon 
The head of someone
Who'll cry for his state
We know it's too late

I turn round to see 
(What was meant to be)
Faint movement release 
(To rid the disease)

There's innocence torn from its maker
Stillborn, the trust in you
(I have lost all trust I had in you)
This failure has made the creator
So would you tell him what to do?

(I have lost all trust I had in you)
