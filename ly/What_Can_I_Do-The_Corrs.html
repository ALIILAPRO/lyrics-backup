		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I haven't slept at all in days
It's been so long since we've talked
And I have been here many times
I just don't know what I'm doing wrong

What can I do to make you love me?
What can I do to make you care?
What can I say to make you feel this?
What can I do to get you there?

There's only so much I can take
And I just got to let it go
And who knows, I might feel better, yeah
If I don't try and I don't hope

What can I do to make you love me?
What can I do to make you care?
What can I say to make you feel this?
What can I do to get you there?

No more waiting, no more aching
No more fighting, no more trying

Maybe there's nothing more to say
And in a funny way, I'm calm
Because the power is not mine
I'm just going to let it fly

What can I do to make you love me? (What can I do to make you love me?)
What can I do to make you care? (What can I do to make you care?)
What can I say to make you feel this? (What can I do to make you love me?)
What can I do to get you there? (What can I do to make you care?)

What can I do to make you love me? (What can I do to make you love me?)
What can I do to make you care? (What can I do to make you care?)
What can I change to make you feel this? (What can I do to make you love me?)
What can I do to get you there? (What can I do to make you care?)

And love me
Love me, love me (love me, love me)
Love me, love me (love me, love me)
Love me, love me (love me, love me)
Love me, love me (love me, love me)
Love me, love me (love me, love me)
