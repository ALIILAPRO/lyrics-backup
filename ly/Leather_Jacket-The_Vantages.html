		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna be the secret you need to keep
The mistake that you can't help but to repeat
I wanna be the teardrop on your cheek
The one that dives down to kiss your lips when it gets bleak, so bleak
Grab my leather jacket tight when we ride baby
You can count on me when it gets crazy
And take my keys away if we get faded
She's saying
Keep the leather jacket on when you do me baby
I know you don't like playing nice
But if you're playing for keeps
You can skip the tricks on me
You and me we fit so tight
You've got me pinned by your skin
Oh you make me lose my mind
Hearts shaking in place
If you've got the rattle baby I've got the roll
We could make such a stunning disgrace
Would you kiss goodbye to all control?
Grab my leather jacket tight when we ride baby
You can count on me when it gets crazy
And take my keys away if we get faded
She's saying
Keep the leather jacket on when you do me baby
Grab my leather jacket tight when we ride baby
You can count on me when it gets crazy
And take my keys away if we get faded
She's saying
Keep the leather jacket on when you do me baby
Grab my leather jacket tight when we ride baby
You can count on me when it gets crazy
And take my keys away if we get faded
She's saying
Keep the leather jacket on when you do me baby
