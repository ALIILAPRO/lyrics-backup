		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dream it, repeat it, if I couldn't be there
Thieve it, believe it, so I wouldn't need it
Be it naive, if I couldn't see it
Leave it, repeat it

If I could be fearless now
I've fallen for it
It's foreign, the feeling's ours
And I've fallen for it, I've fallen for it somehow
Fallen for it, fallen for it somehow
Fallen for it, fallen for it somehow
Fallen for it, fallen for it somehow

Time won't make it right, I know that
I can't make it mine, I know that
Time won't make it right, I know that
I can't make it mine, I know that
Time won't make it right, I know that
I can't make it mine, I'm over
Time won't make it right, I know that
I can't make it right, I'm over
