		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know, it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know, it's really serious

There were times when I could
Have murdered her
But you know, I would hate
Anything to happen to her

No, I don't want to see her

Do you really think
She'll pull through
Do you really think
She'll pull through
Do ooh ooh ooh

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know, it's serious
My, my, my, my, my, my baby, goodbye

There were times when I could
Have strangled her
But you know, I would hate
Anything to happen to her
Would you please
Let me see her

Do you really think
She'll pull through
Do you really think
She'll pull through
Do ooh ooh ooh
Let me whisper my last goodbyes
I know, it's serious
