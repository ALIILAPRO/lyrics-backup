		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pretty boys, they didn't teach me things I didn't know
They don't have the thing that I need, but they don't know they don't
You got that old thing about ya, and I can't hide my feels
Pretty girls, they always die out, need another sex appeal

I said come on, zero fucks about it
Come on, I know I'm gonna get hurt
Come on, zero fucks about it
Come on

Keep playing my heartstrings faster and faster
You can be just what I want, my true disaster
Keep playing my heartstrings faster and faster
You can be just what I want, my true disaster

Pretty girls, they like it fancy but you don't keep it clean
We get dirty and we go hard, some things we don't mean
Tell me no one's gonna get ya, I'm just straight up mad
A fool in love rolled up beside me and you're just as bad

I said come on, zero fucks about it
Come on, I know I'm gonna get hurt
Come on, zero fucks about it
Come on

Keep playing my heartstrings faster and faster
You can be just what I want, my true disaster
Keep playing my heartstrings faster and faster
You can be just what I want, my true disaster

Keep playing it like
Keep playing it like
You keep playing it like (keep playing it like)
Keep playing it like
You keep playing it like
I'm gonna get hurt
I'm gonna get hurt
Ah, come on

Keep playing my heartstrings faster and faster
You can be just what I want, my true disaster
Keep playing my heartstrings faster and faster (true disaster)
You can be just what I want, my true disaster

Keep playing it like
Keep playing it like (you keep, you keep, you keep playing it like)
You keep playing it like
Keep playing it like
You keep playing it like
