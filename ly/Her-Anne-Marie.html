		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I think of my mother
No one compares to her
A love like no other
She puts everyone else first
And when I was younger
I treated her the worst
Never known someone stronger
'Cause damn it must've hurt

I don't see you as much as I used to
But if I did, I know what I would do

I'd tell you I love you a million times
Say that I'm sorry if I made you cry
Could never be half the woman even if I tried
But I'll try, I swear I'll try
If someone puts me down, yeah, I know my worth
All thanks to you, the lessons that I've learnt
If I had to put it into words
I think of an angel and all I see is her
Hmm ooh
All I see is her

Uh uh hmm

Your voice in my head and
It tells me I'm beautiful
And when I have children
I'll pass on the things I was told

I don't see you as much as I used to
But if I did, I know what I would do

I'd tell you I love you a million times
Say that I'm sorry if I made you cry
Could never be half the woman even if I tried
But I'll try, I swear I'll try
If someone puts me down, yeah, I know my worth
It's all thanks to you, the lessons that I've learnt
If I had to put it into words
I think of an angel and all I see is her
Hmm ooh
All I see is her
Uh uh hmm
All I see is her
