		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm lucky if I ever see the light of day again
My sin is choking me, my crude built walls are closing in
This cell is filled with claw marks easing me, their teasing me, 
They told me so I didn't know the fall would be this easy

How long until I find the strength to stand
I wait for mercy in your bleeding hand
I know they'll come with what I'm owed-guilty as charged
My enemies belittle me reminding me the penalty 
Of all my deeds despite my pleas is death

Don't let go 'cause I don't wanna be this, I don't wanna be this
Death is mine I know
Don't let go, don't let go
Save your own 'cause I don't wanna be this, I don't wanna be this
Death is mine I know
Don't let go, don't let go, savior

Your way to life has only showed me what a fool I am
It serves the purpose of confirming I remain condemned
And I will ever linger on the edge
Unless you hear me
