		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a million lightyears away from you
Saved a million dried tears just for you

My heart so bittersweet
It's coming alive 'cause it's so alive to pain
For good I'll let it bleed
Knowing that somewhere in time you'll feel the same

But should it bleed in vain
Shall all of my sadness be what I am to face
Until the end of days

I'm a million lightyears away from you
Saved a million dried tears just for you
How I only wished that you could hear
My rhapsody in blue
I'm a million lightyears away from you

Ohh, ohh, oh (I'm hearing you crying my name)
Ohh, ohh, oh (Can you take the sorrow from me)
Ohh, ohh, oh (Or will it be all we're to see)
I'm a million lightyears away from you

A prayer into the night
Arising from out of the void you left in me
A song across the sky
May you be carried, my little melody

And should I chant in vain
I'm willing to take all the woe and carry on
Until another dawn

I'm a million lightyears away from you
Saved a million dried tears just for you
How I only wished that you could hear
My rhapsody in blue
I'm a million lightyears away from you

I'm a million lightyears away from you
Saved a million dried tears just for you
How I only wished that you could hear
My rhapsody in blue
I'm a million lightyears away from you

Ohh, ohh, oh (I'm hearing you crying my name)
Ohh, ohh, oh (Can you take the sorrow from me)
Ohh, ohh, oh (Or will it be all we're to see)
I'm a million lightyears away from you
