		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuck what you told me
I really just need you to hold me
I need you to reach deep inside of my heart, show me the part that had sold me
That beated the moment I met you
That fucking won’t let me forget you
That despite all the hurt and the pain still battles my brain to tell me I love you
Tell me that some things are real
Tell me there’s something to feel
Tell me there’s something or someone else waiting
So I can stop drowning in all of the liquor and pills
But still, I’m counting the days on my wall 'til you come back
Next to the pictures we hung on some thumb tacks
I’m craving a way to get through to you
Baby, I really just need you to hold me
I’m missing the old me
With you in my story
Nobody knows me
Not like the way that you know me
You know, it was all cause of you
You made me a person
You made it stop hurting
You opened my curtains
Girl I was certain
My world became open
You made me feel special, you made me feel chosen
Found from the lost, you ain’t see me as broken
Honestly thought that you must’ve misspoken
When you said that you loved me
And you said I could have you
A beautiful message I knew
Destined to fail and too good to be true
Like a soft pillow in a bed of lies
You had my ego so incentivized
How was I to know it’d be my demise
You got me in the gutter like I’m pennywise
And I’m craving a way to get out
Fuck it a way to get in
I think that we could workout
I promise i’ve changed baby lets try it again
I know we’ll figure it out
I’m not deranged, why am I crying again
I’m not the person you want, I put on a face and I go and I try to pretend,
Again and again
And it’s taking apart all the fight and the pride in me
Now my own heart won’t even confide in me
I’m falling ill to anxiety, I hate you’re seeing this side of me
Baby just lie to me
Fuck what you told me
I really just need you to hold me
I need you to reach deep inside of my heart, show me the part that had sold me
That beated the moment I met you
That fucking won’t let me forget you
That despite all the hurt and the pain still battles my brain to tell me I love you
Tell me that some things are real
Tell me there’s something to feel
Tell me there’s something or someone else waiting
So I can stop drowning in all of the liquor and pills
But still, I’m counting the days on my wall 'til you come back
Next to the pictures we hung on some thumb tacks
I’m craving a way to get through to you
Baby, I really just need you to hold me
