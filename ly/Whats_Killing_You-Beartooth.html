		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Life's not fair
Let's stay unaware
It's not worth living if we're living scared
Time won't wait
Give it all today
Tomorrow isn't always there
Fuck 'em up, oh

I wanna be in the moment but the moment's passed
I try to make it forever but it never lasts
Remember all the stories but they're fading fast
And now I can't stop staring at the photographs

Try to suppress the feeling
Put a void inside my mind
Hopelessly pretending
I always have more time

Oh, don't know how to feel
Nothing I can do
It's killing me seeing what's killing you
Don't know what to think
Can't believe it's true
It's killing me seeing what's killing you
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
It's killing me seeing what's killing you
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
It's killing me seeing what's killing you

I know how I can be when I'm stuck in my head
Disappear into the night where I try to repent
I'm sorry for all the time that I never spent
In the world instead of laying face down in bed

Try to find out the ending
While the journey's left behind
Hopelessly pretending
I always have more time

Oh, don't know how to feel
Nothing I can do
It's killing me seeing what's killing you
Don't know what to think
Can't believe it's true
It's killing me seeing what's killing you
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
It's killing me seeing what's killing you
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
It's killing me seeing what's killing you

Life's not fair
Let's stay unaware
It's not worth living if we're living scared
Time won't wait
Give it all today
Tomorrow isn't always there

Don't know how to feel
Nothing I can do
It's killing me seeing what's killing you
Don't know what to think
Can't believe it's true
It's killing me seeing what's killing you
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
It's killing me seeing what's killing you
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
It's killing me seeing what's killing you
