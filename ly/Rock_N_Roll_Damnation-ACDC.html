		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say that you play too loud
Well, baby, that's tough
They say that you've got too much
Can't get enough
They tell you that you look a fool
Or maybe I'm a fool for you
State that your mind's diseased
Shakey stuff

And it's a rock 'n' roll damnation
Ma's own whipping boy
Rock 'n' roll damnation
Take your chance, while you still got the choice

You say that you want respect
Honey, for what?
For everything that you done for me
Well, uh, thanks a lot
Come on
Get up off your bended knees
You can set your mind at ease
My temperature's runnin' hot
Oh, I been waiting all night for a bite of what you got

And it's a rock 'n' roll damnation
Ma's own whipping boy
Rock 'n' roll damnation
Take a chance while you still got the choice

Oh, it's a hard life
(Damnation) They're putting you down
(Damnation) All over town
(Damnation) 'Cause you're way out of reach
Livin' on the street, you got to practice what you preach

And it's a rock 'n' roll damnation
Ma's own whipping boy
Rock 'n' roll damnation
Take your chance while you still got the choice

(Damnation) You left a happy home
(Damnation) To live on your own
(Damnation) You want to live in sin
(Damnation) It's a rock 'n' roll
(Damnation) Just too fond of the joy
(Damnation) You're a toy for a boy
(Damnation) You got dollars in your eyes
(Damnation) Always chasing the pie in the sky
(Damnation)
Rock 'n' roll (damnation)
