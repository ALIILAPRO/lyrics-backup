		  The Documentary 2
Damn it I done did it again
Game still in Cali
Game still in Cali eatin' off the Documentary
The Documentary 2
Damn it I done did it again

So, what it do blood? Talk of the town
Premo, Doc Dre still holding it down
Aftermath do the math nigga you know the sound
Doc 2 thought you knew still holding the crown
Yo, what it do blood? Talk of the town
Premo, Doc Dre still holding it down
Aftermath do the math nigga you know the sound
Doc 2 thought you knew still holding the crown

Last ten been all ten
Make it look easy, my pen been on Ren
My niggas been on kush, my bitches been on X
King of California give a fuck who got next
I'm right now
Bump your gums and the ratchet'll shoot ya
Send your ass back to the future
No Delorean
Aventador and shit, bumpin' Future
Why your girl pullin' on my hookah
Money stretch like Kama Sutra
Started with the roosters
Then I start spittin' clean the money like a loofah
6'5, tall like a hooper, ball like a hooper on the floor like a hooper
So I must be Clay with the .38, Thompson with the Thompson
Everything about me Compton, I mean everything about me Bompton
I ain't never had shit, I grew up like Magic Johnson

So, what it do blood? Talk of the town
Premo, Doc Dre still holding it down
Aftermath do the math nigga you know the sound
Doc 2 thought you knew still holding the crown
Yo, what it do blood? Talk of the town
Premo, Doc Dre still holding it down
Aftermath do the math nigga you know the sound
Doc 2 thought you knew still holding the crown

I taught myself how to spit from listening to It Was Written
My first bars wasn't dope but I had that in the kitchen
Suge wouldn't listen, Irv wouldn't listen
So I ran around with Diddy, Aftermath in the Mission
I would never ask another man for permission I do me
Fuck the Illuminati I'd rather ride around in hoopties
But now it's the Ghost, my gold D's is two threes
Still hop in the freestyle, kick it like two Bruce Lee's
Cut open the noose leaves
Foreign on the hill like it's Lauryn
Smoking la la like the Fugees
Thinking to myself, is it God or Lucy?
Prada or Gucci, popping Cris, Rihanna, Karrueche
Homie I ain't gotta gas I'm so ahead of you fags
The shit I spit off Premo tracks burn confederate flags
Take the roof off roof, gimme Proof back and 2Pac
Westside, but you already knew that

So, what it do blood? Talk of the town
Premo, Doc Dre still holding it down
Aftermath do the math nigga you know the sound
Doc 2 thought you knew still holding the crown
Yo, what it do blood? Talk of the town
Premo, Doc Dre still holding it down
Aftermath do the math nigga you know the sound
Doc 2 thought you knew still holding the crown

I've been rapping for 12 years, 6 months, 16 days
Now I'm a veteran, spit a 16 sixteen ways
Sixteen in a clip, spit it 16 ways
I know six teens, pull up to a sweet sixteen and spray
I'm like sixteen Jay's but the beat I can manage
So every sweet 16 is like Duke and Kansas
You bout to lose advantage, I will come through crews and (Bandage?)
Bruise and damage, fuck you rules and manners
I kick back, click clack, bump the Wu in Phantoms
Fuck rap, I only respect Ja Rule and Hammer
Maybe the old Em, I'm slim and I'm shady
Maybe the old him or Rakim, you niggas keep bullshittin' like Joakim
You so him, I'm so not, you so bitch, I sold rock
My four-four cocked, I been a Top Dawg, I know Dot
Back in '06 I pulled up in that gold drop
Five million sold livin' in the dope spot
Back when my first album was the...

So, what it do blood? Talk of the town
Premo, Doc Dre still holding it down
Aftermath do the math nigga you know the sound
Doc 2 thought you knew still holding the crown
Yo, what it do blood? Talk of the town
Premo, Doc Dre still holding it down
Aftermath do the math nigga you know the sound
Doc 2 thought you knew still holding the crown

The Documentary 2
Damn it I done did it again
Game still in
Game still in Cali eatin' off the Documentary
The Documentary 2
Damn it I done did it again
