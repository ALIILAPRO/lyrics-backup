		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She gave me the queen
She gave me the king
She was wheelin' and dealin'
Just doin' her thing
She was holdin' a pair
But I had to try
Her deuce was wild
But my ace was high
But how was I to know
That she'd been dealt with before
Said she'd never had a full house
But I should have known
From the tattoo on her left leg
And the garter on her right
She'd have the card to bring me down
If she played it right

She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack
She's got the jack

Poker face was her name
Poker face was her nature
Poker straight was a game
If she knew she could get you
She played 'em fast
And she played 'em hard
She could close her eyes
And feel every card
But how was I to know
That she'd been shuffled before
Said she'd never had a royal flush
But I should have known
That all the cards were comin'
From the bottom of the pack
And if I'd known what she was dealin' out
I'd have dealt it back

She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, and who knows what else?
She's got the jack, yeah, yeah
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack
She's got the jack

She's got the jack, she's got the jack,
Oh, it was a bad deal, (jack)
She gave me the (jack), hey
She's got the (jack), she's got the (jack)
She's got the (jack), ooh can't you tell
She's got the (jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack)
(she's got the jack, she's got the jack)
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, you never know
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack
She's got the jack, and it hurts!
(she's got the jack)
She's got the jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack
She's got the jack
Aaaaaah
Oooooh
Thank you, thank you, thank you people, thank you, thank you
I'm glad you like the show, yes, thank you very much folks
Goodnight and god bless
