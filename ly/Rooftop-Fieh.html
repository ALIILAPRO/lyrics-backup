		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  passin the parents of every former class mate
walking in I'm the worlds largest alien
long time no see
yep I'll have to agree
ten years
says she heard about me
some girl said 
thought you're not from here
considering my large eyes green head
I guess its not that weird 

seems like its snowing through the rooftop

and today I took the bus
on the ice
was some guy all alone
and I thought that could be you
all alone 
but you use drugs
and I think I know why
cause I read thru everything a million times

seems like its snowing through the rooftop

belong here
hate it here
escape here
it's me here

snowing here
love it here
escape here
it's me here
