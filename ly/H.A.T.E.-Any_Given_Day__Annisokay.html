		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A split sense of myself
I feel like somebody else
It’s both heaven and hell
I’m breaking, I’m breaking away

My mind is at war
A battle for my soul
I’m free, but lost you know
There’s no way out, no way to go

I am the hate
I am the fear
I am the voice that you can't hear
I am the end that's always near

H. A. T. E.
Having anger towards everything
H. A. T. E.
Having anger towards everything

My past buried inside
feels like I’m buried alive
I can’t open my eyes
Who am I

I’m drawn and split up in two
But I know which way to go
I will pick up my cross
To save my soul

I am the hate
I am the fear
I am the voice that you can't hear
I am the end that's always near

H. A. T. E.
Having anger towards everything
H. A. T. E.
Having anger towards everything

You've been a monster
And I can see
You're just an empty shell
A shadow of me

My mind is at war with myself
It feels like somebody else
Those demons I cannot deny
Cause my mind is nothing but hell

I am the hate
I am the fear
I am the voice that you can't hear
I am the end that's always near

I am the hate
I am the fear
I am the pain that you hold dear
I am the end of all your dreams

H. A. T. E.
Having anger towards everything
H. A. T. E.
Having anger towards everything
