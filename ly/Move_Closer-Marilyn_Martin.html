		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When we're together
Touching each other
And the bodies do what we feel
When we're dancing, ooh
Kissing and swaying
To the love songs softly playing

Move closer
Move your body real close 
Until we feel like we're really making love
Until we feel like we're really making love

So when I say: "Sugar..."
and I whisper I love you, well...
I know you're gonna answer in the sweetest way
of saying: "My pretty baby I love you too" 

There's much room for passion
There's no room for feelings
When could love flows smoothly between us
Body heat, oh

Move closer
Move your body real close 
Until we feel like we're really making love
Until we feel like we're really making love
Until we feel like we're really making love
