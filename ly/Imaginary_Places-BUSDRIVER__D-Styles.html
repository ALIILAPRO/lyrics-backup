[Busdriver]
I'm just here to hold your hand when you die
and to show you around Imaginary Places
Putting many lumps on my bloody stump
Edible habits so I bit the perfect circle
Die in your sleep with the sky at your feet
I'll shoot you when your happy on the day that you will find peace
How did you do it? I don't know, I'm OK!
Every person I know is a secret sorta agent
'cause I'm accused of lewd conducts
All prove hard to rate the prompts(?)
Any kind of rumor for em, may they rest to put me in a loony bin
A funny farm a coo-coo but they need a villain

I'm just here to hold your hand when you die
There is not a sicker person that can do it better
No need to skip it in my eco system
But in the audience of me being evil Christian
H.M. know how I hate him so
But he charged me for a halo
But I'm on a scavenger hunt for a map with a chunk
of a sky mirror I'll go crazy with a mud pie
I play dead songs on the sill screen
Iron my shirt it is a chill dream
It is on to lead away to the stair well till we gut him in it
straight up from the center finally fair-well

I'm just here to hold your hand when you die
and to give your assault rifle a banana clip
Flow in the dark when I stroll in the park
giving everybody informative pamphlets
No sign of life for as far as I can see
Everybody's just charred meat up in the car seat
"Eat shit and die" to the secret spy
'cause I have this funny feeling that I'm being watched
24-hour surveillance
Money or power or ailments
Why'd they send the medical that he shimmered me the hammer
it was way too much you coulda went and had 200?

I'm just here to hold your hand when you die
Psycho better cause trouble runnin for your soft spot
Late market closed, and the irk on her nose
Turned into a deadly gas flowin through the air ducts
She's had no love for the thought that she was
She doesn't love me 'cause I don't have the right hair cut
I'm miss-understood, I just face it, I'm no good!
But I will not apologize for anything that I say
My name is Mr. Busdriver
This is the producer, Paris
We did not embarrass to admit that we were purchasing a bit
of our own Imaginary Place!!

Kids...if you want to piss off your parents
show interest in the arts..

Kids...if you REALLY want to piss off your parents
buy real estate in an Imaginary Place...oh yes..

OK, OK, alright!
Yea...now...move!

(DJ cuts and scratches)

Guess I gotta do my shout outs now..
(Peace to...)

I'm just here to hold your hand when you die
Paris and Daddy care, they'll also be there too
I'm just here to hold your hand when you die
Unless you get the ?senamums? to her we'll help you
I'm just here to hold your hand when you die
Feel the fellowship announced everyone will help you
I'm just here to hold your hand when you die
Shoulda been an empire Hip-Hop clan too

I'm just here to hold your hand to die
I'm just here to hold your hand when you
Just here to hold your hand..
when you die..
