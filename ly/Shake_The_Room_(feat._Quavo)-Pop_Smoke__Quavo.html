		  (Trap House Mob)
Oh, oh (woo)
Oh (woo), oh (woo)
(This is a Melo beat)
It's Big 092MLBOA

I bet I shake the room (ay, woo, woo, woo)
Swerve (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Go 'head, shake the room, yeah
Go 'head, shake the room (shake it)
I bet I shake the room
Wait
(Go) Swerve (skrrt, skrrt)
Go 'head, shake the room, yeah
Go 'head, shake the room (shake it)
I bet I shake the room

Uh, Quavo
How 'bout I shake the room? (shake it)
Chopper gon' sweep the broom
Everybody runnin' and duckin', I'm clearing the room
Shoot one time, seeing double time, like you on shrooms (shoot, shoot)
On the other line, it's a Facetime, say a nigga on the news (brrrrt)
We 'bout to shake in this bitch (shake)
Frosted Flakes on the wrist (ice)
The gang ain't playin' and shit (woo)
In New York I gotta shake in this bitch
Shake, shake, shake, shake (shake it up)
Peel back ya toup√©e (peel it back)
Money move the conversate (money)
Put 'em up on the plate (put 'em up)
Baby shakin' in the waist (she shakin')
Hit the flashlight to see her face (flash)
And she lookin' like a snack (cutie)
Birkin bag on the way (woo)

I bet I shake the room (ay, woo, woo, woo)
Swerve (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Go 'head, shake the room, yeah
Go 'head, shake the room (shake it)
I bet I shake the room
Wait
(Go) Swerve (skrrt, skrrt)
Go 'head, shake the room, yeah
Go 'head, shake the room (shake it)
I bet I shake the room

Baby, baby
Shake it, shake it
I pop a Perc, feel amazing
Straight Henny, no chaser
Niggas be talkin' hot 'til they get burned (woo)
I don't fuck with niggas, 'cause these niggas be shermed
Lil' nigga, stay in your place, wait for your turn
Respect ain't given, nigga, it's earned
In the Bugatti (woo) 5719 with baguettes, flag in the air
Hold on, ref (ref), ref (ref)
In a LaFerrari, can't rent this (nah)
With a brown lil' thing, Reese's (Reese's)
Steven Victor in the Pista (Pista)
Dior got no creases (creases)
Art gallery (art gallery)
6.1 for the painting (painting)
George Condos (George Condos)
Cost more than your condo (uh)
Wait

I bet I shake the room (ay, woo, woo, woo)
Swerve (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Go 'head, shake the room, yeah
Go 'head, shake the room (shake it)
I bet I shake the room
Wait
(Go) Swerve (skrrt, skrrt)
Go 'head, shake the room, yeah
Go 'head, shake the room (shake it)
I bet I shake the room
