		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Suicidal in the club on a Friday
Baby, I'm looking around for somebody
Haven't done this shit in way too long
And baby, this tastes too strong
But I need it
Used to do this all the time, every weekend
Used to show up at the club when you needed
Girl, I saved everything you deleted
Too much shit on my mind
Don't hesitate, I'm inside
Don't hesitate, I'm waiting
For you to ruin my life
Too much hurts deep inside
That I cannot hide
I know we needed
We needed some time
Some time
Some time
Some time
We needed some time
Some time
Some time
Some time
We needed some time
We needed some time
It was all good till I lost my mind
You stole my heart, you committed the crime
I lost you right when I needed to find
Now I'm in the club and I'm drinking shots, lonely
One step at a time, tryna take this shit slowly
I thought I was dead now I'm feelin' so ghostly
I thought you were my only
Too much shit on my mind
Don't hesitate, I'm inside
Don't hesitate, I'm waiting
For you to ruin my life
Too much hurts deep inside
That I cannot hide
I know we needed
We needed some time
Some time
Some time
Some time
We needed some time
Some time
Some time
Some time
We needed some time
We needed some time
Some time
Some time
Some time
We needed some time
