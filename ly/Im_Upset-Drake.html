		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
(I'm workin' on dyin')

I'm upset
Fifty thousand on my head, is disrespect
So offended that I had to double check
I'ma always take the money over sex
That's why they need me out the way
What you expect?

Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no hoe
Every month, I'm supposed to pay her bills
And get her what she want
I still got like seven years of doin' what I want
My dad still got child support from 1991 (one, one, one)
Outta town (town), people love to pop a lot of shit then come around
Word to Flacko Jodye, he done seen us put it down
Niggas askin' if I'm cool

I'm upset ('set, 'set)
Hunnid thousand on my head, is disrespect (disrespect)
So offended that I had to double check

You tryna check?
This is real life, niggas think we playin' chess
So what's next?
Jump up out the bed like I'm possessed
I go out on tour and I say I'm drinkin' less
End up gettin' loose and gettin' pictures from my ex (ex, ex, ex, ex)
SMS, triple X
That's the only time I ever shoot below the neck (grrt)
Why you keep on shootin' if you know that nigga dead? (Grrt)
That's the only kind of shit that gets you some respect

Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul (for my soul)
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho (ayy, ayy)
Every month, she don't even love me, she just puttin' on a front (front)
She gon' try and settle outta court and make a run
Then gon' ask me how I'm doin'?

I'm upset ('set, 'set)
Half a million on my head I can't accept, yeah
'Least it make me feel like someone tried they best, yeah
Want to waste a half a million, be my guest
Made me wanna buy a vest and a TEC (grrt)
But I'm blessed, I just checked (checked, checked)
Hate me, never met me in the flesh (flesh)
Say she got some things she gotta come here and collect
That shit is in a box to the left, to the left (left, left, left)

Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul (for my soul)
Thankful for the women that I know (that I know)
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho
