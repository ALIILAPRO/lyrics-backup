		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been roaming around, always looking down at all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers under cover of the street
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

Someone like you, oh
Someone like you
Like you

Off in the night, while you live it up, I'm off to sleep
And I'm waging wars to shape the poet and the beat, yeah
I hope it's gonna make you notice
I hope it's gonna make you no-, make you notice

Someone like me
Someone like me, oh
Somebody like me, someone like me
Someone like me
Somebody
Somebody, somebody

That can make you say, oh
Sex is on fire
And oh
Sex is on fire, fire
Oh, oh, sex is on
What you want, babe?
Sex is on, sex is on
Sex is on fire, on fire
I feel it
I feel it
I feel it
I feel it
I feel it
I feel it
