		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It takes one to know one
And I know that I've been had again
It takes one to know one
And I know that I've been frayed
And you say you're sorry
That someone came and stole your bike
And I said don't worry
But don't you go and take a hike
It takes one to know one
There's always someone on the prowl
It takes one to know one

And you say you're sorry
That we're all mindless animals
And I said don't worry
I have already read the bible

So stay with me
Just stay with me
So stay with me
'Til tomorrow

It takes one to know one
The week is long inside his arms
It takes one to know one
The love is filtered for the ashes of the shroud
And you say you're sorry
That someone came and stole your pride
And I said don't worry
We'll draw a shape side by side

So stay with me
Just stay with me
So stay with me
'Til tomorrow

There is nothing more to say
We will burn the paper bride today
There is nothing more to say
We will burn the paper bride today
There is nothing more to say
We will burn the paper bride today
