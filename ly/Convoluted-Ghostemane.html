		  Somebody give me a truth i kid, I kid
I know it's just too much to trust, ain't it?
I'll take it, I'll- take all of it all
Everyone else's shame
Blame and all their pain

Is there anybody and I really mean
It anybody headed this way?
If so then we better get goin'
Then goin' then gone i'll explain on the way

Runnin' runnin' away again a maniac
No Magee vagabond to the end (The end)

(Lock me up, And throw away the key)
Out!

Somebody give me a truth i kid, I kid
I know it's just too much to trust, ain't it?
I'll take it, I'll- take all of it all
Everyone еlse's shame
Blame and all thеir pain

(Lock me up and throw away the key)
(Well, lock me up and throw away the key)
(Lock me up and throw away the key)
(Lock me up, throw away the key)
(Lock me up, Lock me up
And throw away the key)
(And throw away the key, Lock me up
And throw away)
(Lock me up, They silently looking at
Me now, I'm really sad
Throw away the key if you're
Literally the real key)
(And throw away the key
They silently looking
At me now, I'm really sad
Throw away the key if you're
Literally the real key)
(Lock me up, They know my ignorance
So watch out on me, never fuck with anybody
If I stupidly can't, so lock)
(And throw away the key
They know my ignorance, so watch out
On me, never fuck with anybody
If I stupidly can't, just lock)
(Lock me up, They know my ignorance
So watch out on me, never fuck with anybody
If I stupidly can't, so lock)
(And throw away the key
They know my ignorance, so watch out
On me, never fuck with anybody
If I stupidly can't, lock)
