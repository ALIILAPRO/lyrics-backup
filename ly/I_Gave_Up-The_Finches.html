		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm the one who lost her mind
Who had to try twice as hard
Who's being called so blind, just 'cause I don't know how to walk
The one you passed by, without looking in her eyes
The one who passed your mind but not enough to give a try
The one you didn't mind to kick right where it hurt
The one who's so careful not to kick you back instead
The one that you murdered, to raise your self-esteem
The one who never cries 'cause you've put it out of my scheme

I'm the one who broke a leg, trying to run so hard
Trying to run away from all the pain that's built up
The one who always fails in all the thing in life
The one who's always at least a hundred miles behind
The one who's so afraid of being called a fraud
That's why I'm always staying away from the crowd
The one who doesn't dream, 'cause she doesn't dare to
The one who gave up, who gave up just because of you

I'm the one who gave up, the one who gave up, the one who gave up
I'm the one who gave up, the one who gave up, the one who gave up
I'm the one who gave up, the one who gave up, the one who gave up
I'm the one who gave up, the one who gave up, the one who gave up
I'm the one who gave up, the one who gave up, the one who gave up
