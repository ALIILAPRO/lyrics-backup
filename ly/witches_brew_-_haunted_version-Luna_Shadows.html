		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Back in the day,
They would've made an incision,
Cut out my brain,
Wouldn't have been my decision. 
Earlier on,
Would've been one of those women
Burnt at the stake,
Not a chance for forgiveness
Not a chance for forgiveness. 

(But I hate myself, myself)

Get a chemical break,
Spend it all in my bedroom  
I'm such a waste,
And I'd stay, if they'd let you
Lay there for days,
See who's payin' attention
Mother calls in  
She's an honorable mention,
she's an honorable mention.

But I hate myself for what I did to you
I'm lyin', hiding from the full moon.
I can't take myself for not forgiving you, 
I'm cryin', hiding from the full moon. 

Now there's nothing to take
But preventative measures
It's a skip in the tape,
won't be like this forever.
At least that's what they say,
It's just unwanted weather,
By tomorrow morning,
I'll be light as a feather,
Light as a feather

(But I hate myself, myself)
But I hate myself for what I did to you
I'm lyin', hiding from the full moon.
I can blame myself for not forgiving you,
I'm cryin', hiding from the full moon.
Fucking hate myself for what I did to you
I'm lyin', hiding from the full moon.
I'll erase myself for not forgiving you,
I'm cryin', hiding from the full moon.
