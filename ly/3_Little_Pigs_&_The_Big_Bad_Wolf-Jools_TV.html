		  Who's afraid of the big bad wolf Not me
Not me
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf Not me
Not me
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf Not me
Not me
Not me
What's poppin, what's shakin Man I'm in the mood for bacon Everyone run for cover
Mmm don't make me break in Don't be scared
You don't have to hide
You don't have to fight
The more you run
The bigger you make my appetite
Your house is made of hay
I'lI blow that down in a major way
It's lunch time, and I ain't came to play
When I huff and puff its gone fade away
(Poof be gone)
I'm gone make this quick so I don't need a countdown (Won't take me long)
As I huff and puff and I blow your house down
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf Not me
Not me
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf Not me
Not me
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf Not me
Not me
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf

Not me Not me Not me
Hmm what's this
A house that's made of real sticks
Ima blow this thing down real quick
Cuz I'm a bad boy like Will Smith
Yeah I'm the big bad wolf
You just a scared little piglet
Open up and let me in
Cuz I'm in the mood for some rib tips
Or some roast beef or some hammocks
Brussel sprouts with some porkchops
Mac and cheese with some french fries
Then wash it down with some orange pop
Man I'm starved and this doors locked
Ima make this quick so I don't need a countdown As I huff and puff and I blow your house down
What's poppin, what's shakin Man I'm in the mood for bacon Everyone run for cover
Mmm don't make me break in Don't be scared
You don't have to hide
You don't have to fight
The more you run
The bigger you make my appetite
I got all 3 of y'all
Let's see what's poppin now
I know this house legit
And its made of bricks
But I'm still gone knock it down
I ain't playing around
When it comes to my pork chops
Even though I got the doors locked
I be holding the crown
When it comes to blowing it down
But this house was built like its fort Knox (WHEW)
I can blow a little faster but
If I did then I'd probably need my asthma pump

I'm comin in your time is up
When I huff and puff then I'm gone turn this house to dust Got me using all my energy
I think its time that I find a new remedy
I'm a dangerous man
But a change of plans
But this time I'm gone climb through the chimney
Boy that's hot
I got burned by a boiling pot
I tried to break in and get some pigskin
And I failed, and boy I'm shocked
That's it, I'm leaving I think I'm going vegan
I learned a valuable lesson today
That looks can be deceiving
I blew down the one with the sticks
(Sticks)
I blew down the one with the hay
(Hay)
Couldn't blow down the one with the bricks
(Bricks)
I guess this just isn't my day
What can I say
I usually slay
But I guess I'm not as bad as I look
This ones for the books
That's when they started to sing who's afraid of the big bad wolf
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf Not me
Not me
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf Not me
Not me
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf Not me
Not me
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf Not me
Not me
Not me
