		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll be coming home soon baby please
Be waiting outside your door
I'll be coming home soon baby please
Be waiting outside your door
When I get back with you baby you know
I ain't going to leave any more

When I get on that train baby
You'll know it won't be long
When I get on that train baby
You'll know it won't be long
I'll give you all the love
Little darling I've had
In store for you since I've been gone

I ain't going to leave no more little girl
This time I'm coming home to stay
I ain't going to leave no more little girl
This time I'm coming home to stay
I'm going to give you a no good
Mother every night and every day
