		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know I told you to go
And I want you to be happy
And she seems incredible
But I hope not as special as me

17 hours, a dancing queen
You were mine, mi-mi-mine remedy, clarity
Even when we said goodbye

You won't forget about me, right?
Even though I'm out of your life
You won't forget about me, right?
Even if it's over sometime
I know you'll move on and so will I
Let's not let the good times die
You won't forget about me, right? Right?

I saw you the other night
But you were just a faded memory
And it almost made me cry
I wish you were here to remind me

17 hours, a dancing queen
You were mine, mi-mi-mine remedy, clarity
Even when we said goodbye

You won't forget about me, right?
Even though I'm out of your life
You won't forget about me, right?
Even if it's over sometime
I know you'll move on and so will I
Let's not let the good times die
You won't forget about me, right? Right?

In a year or two or maybe three
I hope you'll still have memories
In a week or a month or next century
I hope you still know me

You won't forget about me, right?
Even though I'm out of your life
You won't forget about me, right?
Even if it's over sometime
I know you'll move on and so will I
Let's not let the good times die
You won't forget about me, right? Right?
