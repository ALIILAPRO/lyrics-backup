		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cannabis Sativa, haha
Or in the heart of LA known as the chronic
Not to be confused with the bionic
Even though it does cost six million dollars
Man, understand, haha
Now we working with some new improved shit on this track
Nevertheless not no stress
Sucker-ass niggas
So now we gonna move on and uh
Light a big fat one up for the world
And hit this
Once or twice and you'll be twice as nice, get it
This is The Chronic hahahaha (well blaze that motherfucker up then, nigga)

Make my bud the chronic
I wants to get fucked up
Make my shit the chronic
I gots to fire it up
I want the bomb, I want the chronic
I gots to get fucked up
Make my bud the chronic
Before I take it home

Damn, my last joint
Don't fuck with me, fool (pass the bud)
Who got the dub sacks? (I got it)
Ooh wee
This shorter than a motherfucker man (you can take it or leave it, nigga)
But I need a spliff right now (roll this shit up then nigga, and pass it)
And I don't want no cess, brother (fucked up)
It's got to be the chronic, know what I mean, nigga?
Yeah, that's the chronic, that's the chronic (Goddamn, sure is)
That's the bomb bud (you ain't never lyin')
Now get me a motherfucking Zig-Zag and we straight (here nigga I got some)
Or better yet, a motherfucking blunt (I got that shit)
A Philly blunt that is (here ya go)

Make my bud the chronic
I wants to get fucked up
Make my shit the chronic
I gots to fire it up
I want the bomb, I want the chronic
I gots to get fucked up
Make my bud the chronic
Before I take it home

Make my bud the chronic
I wants to get fucked up
Make my shit the chronic
I gots to fire it up
I want the bomb, I want the chronic
I gots to get fucked up
Make my bud the chronic
Before I take it home

Goddamn, I'm fucked up (you ain't lyin', I'm fucked up to, God)
That shit ain't no joke, ooh shit (ain't no joke, fuck)
Nah, I don't want no more, I don't want shit (what I wanna know is what I'm gonna-)
Just leave me alone 
Just let me, just chill out and listen to this shit
(What you wanna do then, nigga? You can't hang? What the fuck's wrong?)
I'm high, I'm fucked up, damn

Make my bud the chronic
I wants to get fucked up (they put in this weed?)
Make my shit the chronic (that's why they call this shit chronic)
I gots to fire it up (your ass still high) (mh)
I want the bomb, I want the chronic (damn)
I gots to get fucked up (damn, shit)
Make my bud the chronic
Before I take it home (fucked up, fucked up)

Make my bud the chronic (fuck, crazy, I'm fucked up)
I wants to get fucked up (really)
Make my shit the chronic (really though)
I gots to fire it up (nah, I'm cooler than a motherfucker)
I want the bomb, I want the chronic (that shit, that shit's)
I gots to get fucked up (that shit's crazy)
Make my bud the chronic (I'm high)
Before I take it home (damn)

Ooh, I ready to fuck some shit up now baby
(That nigga Dre serving some shit now)
(Hell, you can come on and fuck me up)
Mhm (uh-huh), triple cheeseburger (Oh, you talking about some food, I got some)
Some fries, some motherfucking couple sodas and shit
And hot apple turnover and all that old shit, nigga
(How 'bout some seafood, then?)
Ooh, I'm ready to get my munch on (me too)
That bud smell good than a motherfucker too
I don't wanna hit no more of that ol' shit, that shits nots to be fucked with
Not to be fucked with (nigga would you shut up?)
I'm high, ooh nigga, you pass that to somebody else
Nigga, I'm through for the night
Really though, really though nigga
Let's go get some food
Let's get up out this motherfucker 
(We better go back over there with Dre, young nigga, what's up?)
Nah, nigga don't be trying to pass me that shit, man(for real, you ain't never lyin')
I told you I'm cool (I'll smoke with my motherfuckin' self then)
I don't want nothing else (fuck it then, I'm outtie)
