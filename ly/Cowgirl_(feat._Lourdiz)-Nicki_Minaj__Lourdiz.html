		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just wanna get drunk tonight
Then I'ma ride him cowgirl, cowgirl
He's gon' look me in the eyes
And I'ma ride him cowgirl, cowgirl

Ayo
Who the fuck is this? I think I might know his bitch
Ice on his wrist, pullin' up in the six
Talkin' 'bout he packin' like a flight for a trip
Said he don't drink but he might take a sip
Be on point when you come through to see me
He know all these other bitches really wanna be me
I know how to make a nigga dick get creamy
Pussy dreamy, ayo
One, two, check, one, it's one, two
I get it done too, forty inch my frontal
I get a three, four, yup, yup
I'm 'bout to ride him like a seesaw
Is that C. Dior?
Do you see? Is she gon' give you head when you pull up in the V?
Is she gon' bust it open on islands, by the sea?
K-i-s-s-i-n-g while you all in a tree
Rude boy, you nah pree?

Just wanna get drunk tonight
Then I'ma ride him cowgirl, cowgirl
He's gon' look me in the eyes
And I'ma ride him cowgirl, cowgirl
Just wanna get drunk tonight
Then I'ma ride him cowgirl, cowgirl
He's gon' look me in the eyes
And I'ma ride him cowgirl, cowgirl

Ayo
Welcome to the show, yeah, this the rodeo
The bull I ride is not mechanical
Peak under my dress, Marilyn Monroe
I got a cowboy, the boy is gung ho
Better than me? Oh, no, not one ho
Big buckle on, his cowboy hat low
Nigga said he pack and I said, "Pack more"
Copycats crunchy like an apple
Excuse me, what I gotta do to show these bitches they amuse me?
Prada, Milan, Italy, yeah, that is where my shoes be
I'ma keep it real with you, so please do not accuse me
If you can't do it three times a night you're gonna lose me
Yo, babe, pass me the two-piece
The colorful one must be the Pucci, ooh, see
I know the p- is well juicy
Spark shades, sip C, cock the Uzi

Just wanna get drunk tonight
Then I'ma ride him cowgirl, cowgirl
He's gon' look me in the eyes
And I'ma ride him cowgirl, cowgirl
Just wanna get drunk tonight
Then I'ma ride him cowgirl, cowgirl
He's gon' look me in the eyes
And I'ma ride him cowgirl, cowgirl

Cowgirl
Cowgirl
I'ma ride him
Cowgirl
Cowgirl

Boy, they could never be you
None of them could ever be this cute
Bo-boy, they could never be you
Can't fight, they can't ever beat you

Just wanna get drunk tonight
Then I'ma ride him cowgirl, cowgirl
He's gon' look me in the eyes
And I'ma ride him cowgirl, cowgirl
Just wanna get drunk tonight
Then I'ma ride him cowgirl, cowgirl
He's gon' look me in the eyes
And I'ma ride him cowgirl, cowgirl
