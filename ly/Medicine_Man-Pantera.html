		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Many distant miles away 
Past the shores of ever dark 
There stays a magic man 
Who bears an evil mark 
He helps all concerned 
Those who come again return 
Injecting lies while fires burn 
The devil's heart 
With angel's words 

Have you wondered what heaven's like? 
She can show you in one night 
Overwhelming with euphoric lift 
To lure you to steal your gift 

Intoxication 
Seeping down to the bone 
And there's no question 
To where you have to go 

Understand, just take his hand 
He's the medicine man 

Understand, just take his hand 
He's the medicine man 

Once proud and fearless men 
With desire in their eyes 
Lost strong and fruitful lives 
To self-indulgent ties 
Their souls were dipped in venom 
Then put into a box 
Then placed upon a crowded shelf 
Where countless souls now rot 

Have you ever wondered what hell's like? 
He can take you there 
Just one taste and you'll be back 
And by the high you'll swear 

Intoxication 
Seeping down to the bone 
And there's no question 
To where you have to go 

Understand just take his hand 
He's the medicine man

Understand just take his hand 
He's the medicine man, oh

Understand just take his hand 
He's the medicine man

Understand just take his hand 
He's the medicine man
