		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Depression)
(Teenage suicidal)
(Why girls?)
(Emotional)
(Social anxiety)

Pretty face with pretty bad dreams
No one knows I cry in my sleep
Waking up feeling like shit
It's a normal thing to feel like this

I don't care, I'm feeling down
I wanna stay home, never go outside
Summer depression comes every year
I just want to disappear (depression)

Summer depression
There's so much time to question my life
Summer depression
It's my summer depression

My worst habit
Is my own sadness
So I stay up all night, wondering why
I'm so tired all the time

All my friends are doing things
It's good for them, but I'm nothing
Summer depression comes every year
I just want to disappear (depression)

Summer depression (why?)
There's so much time to question my life
Summer depression
It's my summer depression

(Teenage suicidal)
(Why girls?)
(Emotional)
(Social anxiety)
(Depression)

Summer depression
There's so much time to question my life
Summer depression
It's my summer depression

(Depression)
