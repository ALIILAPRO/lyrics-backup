		<p>
		  Lazer, Lazer

I'll replay this moment for months
Alone in my head, waitin' for it to come
I wrote all your lines in the scripts in my mind, and
I hope that you follow it for once

I imagine myself in satin, the room was platinum and gold
I'd dance and catch your eye, you'll be mesmerized, oh
We'd find a corner, then your hands in my hair
Finally we're here, so, why
Are you sayin' you got a flight, need an early night?
No, don't go yet

Oh, yeah, don't go yet, don't go yet
Oh, yeah, don't go yet, don't go yet
Oh, yeah, don't go yet, don't go yet
What you leavin' for, when my night is yours?
Just a little more, don't go yet

Don't go yet, don't go yet
Don't go yet, don't go yet
Don't go yet, don't go yet
Don't go yet, don't go yet

Baby, don't go yet, 'cause I wore this dress for a lil' drama
And I bet, I bet that you think that you know, but you don't
Baby, come to mama
I get, I get what I want when I want
And I get it how I wanna, wanna
And I want you baby, gotta get you, baby

We'd find a corner, then your hands in my hair
Finally we're here, so, why
Are you sayin' you got a flight, need an early night?
No, don't go yet

Don't go yet (no), don't go yet (no)
Don't go yet (no), don't go yet (no)
Don't go yet (no), don't go yet (no)
Don't go yet (no), don't go yet

Oh, yeah, don't go yet, don't go yet
Oh, yeah, don't go yet, don't go yet
Oh, yeah, don't go yet, don't go yet
What you leavin' for, when my night is yours?
Just a little more, don't go yet

Dámelo

(oh-no-no, don't leave yet)
(No te vayas, quédate) dale
(oh-no-no, don't leave yet)
(No te vayas, quédate)
(oh-no-no, don't leave yet) stay a little longer
(No te vayas, quédate) Know you really wanna
(oh-no-no, don't leave yet) stay a little longer
(No te vayas, quédate) oh

Oh, yeah, don't go yet, don't go yet (oh)
Oh, yeah, don't go yet, don't go yet (oh, don't go yet)
Oh, yeah, don't go yet, don't go yet (oh)
What you leavin' for, when my night is yours?
Just a little more

Don't go yet, don't go yet
Don't go yet, don't go yet (just a little more, don't go yet)
Don't go yet, don't go yet
What you leavin' for, when my night is yours?
Just a little more, don't go yet
