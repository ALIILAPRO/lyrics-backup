		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The world was on fire
No one could save me but you
Strange what desire would make foolish people do
I've never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
I've never dreamed that I'd loose somebody like you

But I don't want to fall in love
No I don't want to fall in love
I never wanna fall in love with you
With you
What a wicked game to play
To make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do
To make me dream of you

What a wicked thing to say
You've never felt this way
What a wicked thing to do
To let me dream of you
I don't want to fall in love
no I don't want to fall in love
I never wanna fall in love with you
With you

What a wicked game to play
To make me feel this way
What a wicked game to play
