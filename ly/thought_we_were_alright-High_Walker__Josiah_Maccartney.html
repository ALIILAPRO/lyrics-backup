		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought we were alright
I thought we were okay
I thought I didn't need
To worry bout the coming days
I thought that we'd be fine
Oh I didn't know
Why you'd give up a whole life
Thinking about you eats my mind

Yeah I thought that we were okay
Thought that we were doin fine
You was like my Tina fey
Steve Carrel on date night
Then the devil used magic
Turned your heart into a witch
I mean that so literally
I done dated all the mix
I can see just what you feeling
Till I find out how you
Really feeling
Healing in reverse
I'm a card you did the dealing
Gave me all the wrong hands
Maybe I'm a cry baby
Lately I don't mean a thing to you
And scars shape daily
Baby I'm not safe with you
Like I'm falling off the railing
Couldn't save me from the truth
Had to hear that you've been railing
Every person you can find 
Definition of us failing
Heavy eyes you did the crime 
Wanna cry... now I'm wailing
I done gave you everything 
I just wish I didn't stay
You just love to bring the pain
Bring the drama I'm so used to getting stained
Getting paid
Now you call me phone can I get away

Were gonna do great things Brodie
I promise you that
You're gonna do great things
Like... really great things
I see it, I see it
Sadsky

Yeah I thought that we were okay
Thought that we were doin fine
Till you stabbed me in the back
Making me regret the times
When my friends break the news
Feeling paralyzed
You've been lying to my face
Seeing other guys
Always breaking the conversation
What you afraid of?
Maybe telling the truth will be too hard
Is that too scary for ya?
But nah it's always my fault
its always paranoia
While the world is screaming no
I care too much for ya
So I shoulda spent more money
On things that mattered
Instead of all these stupid dates and wasted flowers
Im crying in bed
Bet you know how that feels
We'll never understand why
Your scars didn't heal...
