		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lookin' back, lookin' back at the past
And what we had, oh
And I hate the fact we can't turn back
'Cause what I did
It hurt you bad, oh

And I know that I did you wrong
Know that I led you on
Know that I did you wrong
(Did you wrong, did you wrong)
But I was running blind
And I wish I took the time
To really ask you how you feel
So tell me now

How will I know if you really love me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
How will I know?
How will I know?

Oh-oh-oh-oh
How will I know?
Oh-oh-oh-oh
How will I know?
Oh-oh-oh-oh
How will I know?
Oh-oh-oh-oh
How will I know?

Every night, I'm running wild to heal the scars
And clear my mind, oh yeah
But it's hard to find the space I need to contemplate
That you're not mine anymore

And I know that I did you wrong
Know that I led you on
Know that I did you wrong
(Did you wrong, did you wrong)
But I was running blind
And I wish I took the time
To really ask you how you feel
So tell me now

How will I know if you really love me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
How will I know? (How will I know?)
How will I know?

Oh-oh-oh-oh
How will I know?
Oh-oh-oh-oh
How will I know?
Oh-oh-oh-oh
How will I know?
Oh-oh-oh-oh
How will I know?

Oh, can you tell me?
I need to know, I need to know
How will I know if you really love me?
How will I know?
How will I know?

How will I know if you really love me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet (oh yeah)
How will I know? (How will I know?)
How will I know?
How will I know if you really love me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
How will I know? (How will I know?)
How will I know?
