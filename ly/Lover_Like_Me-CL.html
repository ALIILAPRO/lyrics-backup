		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember the last time you called me Chae Lin
Can't remember the last time you called me that name
You always said that I would be the main thing
And now, you gonna switch lanes

Caught you out there, honey, you so so funny
You come back running, running
Yeah, you miss my love and you miss my money
And I tell you something, something

I just got to let you know
If you're gonna let me go
You will never ever find another lover like me 
No lover like me
(Like me, me, lover like, lover like me, lover like me, lover like me, lover like)
You will never ever find another
(Lover like me, lover like me, lover)
(Lover like me, lover like me, lover like me, lover like me, lover)
You will never ever find another

Now you got some time riding solo
Trying to get me back on a low, low
Baby let me tell you it's a no, no
I think that you should go home

Caught you out there, honey, you so so funny
You come back running, running
Yeah, you miss my love and you miss my money
And I tell you something, something

I just got to let you know
If you're gonna let me go
You will never ever find another lover like me 
No lover like me
(Like me, me, lover like, lover like me, lover like me, lover like me, lover like)
You will never ever find another
(Lover like me, lover like me, lover)
(Lover like me, lover like me, lover like me, lover like me, lover)
You will never ever find another

No, I don't like 한눈 파는 그런 type 
This one for my bad
우린 원해 good life 
Cherry lemonade 섞어서 everyday
빠져 내 매력에 매일마다 새롭네 whoa!

백이면 백 내가 하면 잘돼
나의 기지배들 놀때가됐어 다 함께
난 오늘 날씨처럼 매일마다 정말 핫해 
마셔 pour it up 
넌 you missed your only chance 
Bye 관심없어
(Like me, me, lover like, lover like me, lover like me, lover like me, lover like)
You will never ever find another
(Lover like me, lover like me, lover)
(Lover like me, lover like me, lover like me, lover like me, lover)
You will never ever find another
