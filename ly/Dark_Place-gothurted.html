		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am in a dark place, can you save me?
I am all on my own, can you blame me?
I am falling apart, can you heal me?
I am screaming so loud, can you hear me?
All the thoughts in my mind are blending together
I can't sort anything that is in my head
Feels like I'm somewhere that I can never
Escape from I guess I'm better off dead
Nobody even tries, everybody lies
Drowning in the cries, I just wanna die
I'm in a roller coaster I'm going down
Crashing to the floor you can hear the sound
Leaving no memories with my lost
Killed myself to keep you alive at all costs
Killed myself to keep you alive at all costs

I've been so stupid trusting you
I knew nobody is ever honest
I think i'll keep on avoiding you
I'm just a lonewolf inside this forest
Living my life like I've always done and
Living my life all alone
I swear that I'm so sorry mother
But your son now is gone
But your son now is gone

I am in a dark place, can you save me?
I am all on my own, can you blame me?
I am falling apart, can you heal me?
I am screaming so loud, can you hear me?
All the thoughts in my mind are blending together
I can't sort anything that is in my head
Feels like I'm somewhere that I can never
Escape from I guess I'm better off dead
Nobody even tries, everybody lies
Drowning in the cries, I just wanna die
I'm in a roller coaster I'm going down
Crashing to the floor you can hear the sound
Leaving no memories with my lost
Killed myself to keep you alive at all costs
Killed myself to keep you alive at all costs
