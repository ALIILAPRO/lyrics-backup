		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have you ever felt like nobody was there?
Have you ever felt forgotten in the middle of nowhere?
Have you ever felt like you could disappear?
Like you could fall, and no one would hear?

Well, let that lonely feeling wash away
Maybe there's a reason to believe you'll be okay
'Cause when you don't feel strong enough to stand
You can reach, reach out your hand

And oh, someone will coming running
And I know, they'll take you home

Even when the dark comes crashing through
When you need a friend to carry you
And when you're broken on the ground
You will be found

So let the sun come streaming in
'Cause you'll reach up and you'll rise again
Lift your head and look around
You will be found
You will be found
You will be found
You will be found
You will be found

Have you seen this? Someone put a video of your speech online

My speech?

People started sharing it, I guess, and now, I mean
Connor is everywhere (Your speech is everywhere)
This morning The Connor Project page, it only had fifty-six people following it

Well, how many does it have now?

Four thousand five-hundred eighty-two (Sixteen thousand two-hundred and thirty-nine)

I don't understand, what happened?

You did!

There's a place where we don't have to feel unknown (Oh my god) (Everybody needs to see this)
And every time that you call out 
You're a little less alone (I can't stop watching this video
If you only say the word (Seventeen years old)
Take five minutes (This will make your day)
From across the silence
Your voice is heard 

Share it with the people you love (Repost)
The world needs to hear this
A beautiful tribute (Favorite)
I know someone who really needed to hear this today,
So thank you Evan Hansen, for doing what you're doing
I never met you Connor, but coming on here, reading everyone's posts
It's so easy to feel alone, but Evan is exactly right, we're not alone, none of us
We're not alone, none of us, none of us
None of us are alone (Like) (Forward)
Especially now, with everything that you hear in the news (Like) (Share) (Repost) (Forward)
Thank you Evan Hansen, for giving us a space to remember Connor
To be together, to find each other
Sending prayers from Michigan
Vermont, Tampa, Sacramento
Thank you, Evan Hansen (Repost)

Even when the dark comes crashing through
When you need a friend to carry you
When you're broken on the ground
You will be found

So let the sun come streaming in
'Cause you'll reach up and you'll rise again
If you only look around
You will be found (You will be found)
You will be found (You will be found)
You will be found

Out of the shadows
The morning is breaking
And all is new, all is new
It's filling up the empty
And suddenly I see that
All is new, all is new
You are not alone
You are not alone
You are not alone
You are not alone
You are not alone (You are not alone)
You are not alone (You are not alone)
You are not
You are not alone (You are not alone)

Even when the dark comes crashin' through
When you need someone to carry you
When you're broken on the ground

You will be found!

So when the sun comes streaming in
'Cause you'll reach up and you'll rise again
If you only look around
You will be found

Even when the dark comes crashin' through
You will be found
When you need someone to carry you
You will be found
You will be found
You will be found
