		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm sorry 4 the wait I had to get my payment
But in the meantime niggas hoes my calls been vacant
No time to argue broke boys really get no say man
It's a 2 man game it's Kobe shaq but we armed and dangerous
He ain't holding shit my nigga you know that he loud for the crowd
They all gon fake kick holding envy around
So I stay by my lonely got sticks for each round
Got sum shit that need closure so I'm on the prowl
I know where you at boy you never skipped town
When I'm in the city I'm lurking for miles
Glocky don't miss n my window stay down
These niggas kd how they jumpin around
Just to your roots look how shit panning out
You hopped off the ship and you sinking on down
No time to swim up in a instant you drowned
The way they turn bitch got me wondering how
Can't trust a soul they gon leach till they out
He talk like he got you till you not around
Then he got mind control Debo now
Then he turn bird chirpin real loud
Then he got stories how you lamed out
Dirt on your name really make him feel proud
Kicked that deadweight get the fuck from around
Cutting it off if you hold ya hand out
They talk like they got it but sleep on the couch
shit ain't what it seems eyes don't match they mouth
Never one for the team niggas had it planned out
