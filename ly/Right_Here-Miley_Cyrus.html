		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll be right here where you need me
Anytime just keep believin'
And I'll be right here

If you ever need a friend
Someone to care and understand
I'll be right here

All you have to do is call my name
No matter how close or far away
Ask me once and I'll come, I'll come runnin'

And when I can't be with you dream me near
Keep me in your heart and I'll appear
All you gotta do is turn around
Close your eyes, look inside
I'm right here

Isn't it great that you know that
I'm ready to go wherever you're at
Anywhere I'll be there

All you have to do is call my name
No matter how close or far away
Ask me once and I'll come, I'll come runnin'

And when I can't be with you dream me near
Keep me in your heart and I'll appear
All you gotta do is turn around
Close your eyes, look inside
I'm right here

Whenever you need me
There's no need to worry
You know that I'm gonna be
Right here!

Ask me once and I'll come, I'll come runnin'

And when I can't be with you dream me near
Keep me in your heart and I'll appear
All you gotta do is turn around
Close your eyes, look inside
I'm right here, oh yeah yeah, I'm right here
