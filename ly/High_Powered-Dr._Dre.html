		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo, yo, what's up?
Yo man, give me some of that ol' gangsta ass shit
You know what I'm sayin'?
Some shit I can just kick back, smoke a fat ass joint to
You know what I'm sayin'?

Hell yeah, you know what I'm talkin' about?
I like that ol' gangsta shit
'Cause you know it's a lot of niggas out there
Woofin' all that bullshit talkin' 'bout they got this and got that
Talkin' louder than a motherfucker but ain't sayin' shit
You know what I'm sayin'?"
Yeah, nigga, I see your lips quiverin'
But you ain't sayin' a motherfuckin' thing
For my niggas, I got my niggas in the motherfuckin' house
And they gon' tell you what's really goin' on
Got my motherfuckin' nigga RBX, definitely in this motherfucker
I got my nigga Daz in this motherfucker ready to kick some real shit
You know what I'm sayin'?
And that lil' shit ya hear in the background, that's my home girl Rage
So RBX kick this shit

Seven execution style murders
I have no remorse 'cause I'm the fuckin' murderer
Haven't you ever heard of a killer?
I drop bombs like Hiroshima
So now I walk around strapped
One-time bust they caps and watch niggas collapse
Snap, adapt to this but you need no adapter
This is just the first chapter
In a book from a crook
You get caught slippin' yo' ass gots to die
Nigga, tell me what the fuck you figure?
Trigger, happy RBX to cap ya
Pop, pop, and I can't wait to bust a round
Pop, pop, my hollow point smacks the clown
'Cause what I said split his head
And now they got me runnin' from the feds
But I refuse to go alive
It's kill or be killed, that's how real niggas survive
I'm high powered

Yeah
It's Daz that mass-murderin' motherfucker
So what, you feel like you wanna get caught up?
Fool, you better recognize
Death Row came to chastise
So if you cross the Row
Remember the first name is Death
No love for the other side
