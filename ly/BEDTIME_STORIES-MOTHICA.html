		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just a little girl from Oklahoma
Reading Juliet & Romeo, yeah
Didn't think love could exist
If they don't die in the end

So I settled down with Jack and soda
Turned myself into a Casanova
Black out, end with a kiss
Add another one to the list

I still sleep with all the lights on
Wait until it goes wrong
Never thought I'd write another love song
Monsters creeping into my head
Say I don't deserve this
Grew up so afraid of all these bedtime stories
Read them like a warning
Forever wasn't for me 'til I met you

Never worn a dress like Cinderella
Locked in a tower all by myself, yeah
Wasn't looking to be saved
But damn I'm in love with your face

Guess I'm afraid of falling right out
Way up here, it's a long way down
I don't wanna let you down, let you down, let me down

I still sleep with all the lights on
Wait until it goes wrong
Never thought I'd write another love song
Monsters creeping into my head
Say I don't deserve this
Grew up so afraid of all these bedtime stories
Read them like a warning
Forever wasn't for me 'til I met you
