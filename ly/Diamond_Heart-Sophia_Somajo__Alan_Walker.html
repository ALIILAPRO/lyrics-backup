		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hello, sweet grief
I know you will be the death of me
Feel like the morning after ecstasy
I am drowning in an endless sea
Hello, old friend
Here's the misery that knows no end
So I'm doing everything I can
To make sure I never love again

I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone
Yeah, if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue
If I was solid like a jewel

If I had a diamond heart
Oh oh
I'd give you all my love
If I was unbreakable
If I had a diamond heart
Oh oh
You could shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable

I'd walk straight through the bullet
Bend like a tulip
Blue-eyed and foolish
Never mind the bruises
Into the fire
Breakin' through the wires
Give you all I've got
If I had a diamond heart
I'd walk straight through the dagger
Never break the pattern
Diamonds don't shatter
Beautiful and battered
Into the poison
Cry you an ocean
Give you all I've got

Goodbye, so long
I don't know if this is right or wrong
Am I giving up where I belong?
'Cause every station's playing our song
Goodbye, my love
You are everything my dreams made of
You'll be Prince and I'm the crying dove
If I only were unbreakable

I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone
Yeah, if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue
If I was solid like a jewel

If I had a diamond heart
Oh oh
I'd give you all my love
If I was unbreakable
If I had a diamond heart
Oh oh
You could shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable

I'd walk straight through the bullet
Bend like a tulip
Blue-eyed and foolish
Never mind the bruises
Into the fire
Breakin' through the wires
Give you all I've got
If I had a diamond heart
I'd walk straight through the dagger
Never break the pattern
Diamonds don't shatter
Beautiful and battered
Into the poison
Cry you an ocean
Give you all I've got

La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
This is the story (la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la)
I'd give you all my love (I'd give you)
If I was unbreakable (the story, la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la)
You could shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable

I'd walk straight through the bullet
Bend like a tulip
Blue-eyed and foolish
Never mind the bruises
Into the fire
Breakin' through the wires
Give you all I've got
I'd walk straight through the dagger
Never break the pattern
Diamonds don't shatter
Beautiful and battered
Into the poison
Cry you an ocean
Give you all I've got
