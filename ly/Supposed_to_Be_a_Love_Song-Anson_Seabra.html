		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eightam we left your place 
Bound for Paris on a runaway train  
Walking down the Champs-Élysées
Pray this feeling never goes away

And I remember thinking 
Oo-ooo it was a little to-
A little too good to be 
True
It was too good to be true 

The city's never seen a love like ours
We were teenage dreams we were movie stars 
And now it's pitch black dark and you're gone
Where did we go wrong  
This was supposed to be a love song 
Fallin' too hard we burned too fast 
Now there's no way out and there's no way back
And now it's pitch black dark and you're gone
Where did we go wrong  
This was supposed to be a love song 

The night we met
I still replay
Lost in Amsterdam, I saw your face
We were staying up and sleeping late
Two hopeless strangers in a love-drunk haze

And I remember thinking 
Oo-ooo it was a little too
A little too good to be 
True
It was too good to be true 

The city's never seen a love like ours
We were teenage dreams we were movie stars 
And now it's pitch black dark and you're gone
Where did we go wrong  
This was supposed to be a love song 
Fallin' too hard we burned too fast 
Now there's no way out and there's no way back
And now it's pitch black dark and you're gone
Where did we go wrong  
This was supposed to be a love song 

But that's okay
Too many love songs anyway
And they all kinda sound the same
So it's better off this way

The city's never seen a love like ours
We were teenage dreams we were movie stars 
And now it's pitch black dark and you're gone
Where did we go wrong  
This was supposed to be a love song 
Fallin' too hard we burned too fast 
Now there's no way out and there's no way back
And now it's pitch black dark and you're gone
Where did we go wrong  
This was supposed to be a love song
