		  Lightbringer 

(Feat. Casey Lee Williams)

Blood red lips like she wants a bite
Don't hold your breath, his hands are tied
Show me what you want and I'll
Meet you on the Great Divide

She begs for death a second time
Six feet under these covers like
Three-part polyphonic lovers like
Oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh...

Goin' down, down, down, to a heaven underground
Where two's a party and three's a crowd
You want it, you'll find it if you open your mind
Time to sin til you win, let your demons out!
Goin' down, down, down, where the demons hang around
Where souls are sold and the music's loud
He's sweet, she's vicious, this love's fictitious 
So sin til you win, let your demons out!

Lady Lightbringer

Straight out the grave, they're coming
I can't feel my face, stutter my name
Love the taste of suffering
You take my breath away
