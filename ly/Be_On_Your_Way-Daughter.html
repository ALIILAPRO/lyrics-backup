		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I won't hold you back
Time throws us along
And there is never just one human that the heart should lone belong

And you won't hold me back
We cannot quiet fade beneath the center of the stage
So I'll meet you on another planet if the plans change

Be on your way
Be on your way
Be on your way
Be on your way

And if I make it back
To this blue and pink ceiling
Will I have ever seen such beautiful midsummers?

I will try and find you
Maybe we could reconstruct the scene
I have a feeling that we'll repeat this evening

So be on your way
Be on your way
Be on your way
Be on your way

I won't hold you back
Time throws us around
And there is never just one future plan
Our lifetime dreams aren't bound

And you won't hold me back
Won't keep ourselves awake
Believe me, friend, my soul estranged

I will meet you on another planet if the plans change
I have a feeling that we'll repeat this evening

So be on your way
Be on your way
