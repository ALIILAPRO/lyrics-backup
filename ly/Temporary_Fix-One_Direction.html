		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Saw your body language and I know how you're feeling
And you look like the kind of girl who's tired of speaking
Standing with somebody but he doesn't know what you like

You caught my attention, you were looking at me first
Saw that I can teach you, waking up in my t-shirt
If you're not hooked to anything right now I can be your vice

All you need to know is

You can call me
When you're lonely
When you can't sleep
I'll be your temporary fix
You control me
Even if it's just tonight

You can call me
When you feel like
I'm your good time
I'll be your temporary fix
You can call me
I'm always what you like

Let me be your good night

Tonight is on your lips and I feel like I'm locked in
There's a million eyes, I don't care if they're watching
Your body is saying everything, I don't have to read your mind

Feel you on my neck while I'm calling a taxi
Climbing over me while I climb in the backseat
Now we're taking off, now we're taking it off tonight

All you need to know is

You can call me
When you're lonely
When you can't sleep
I'll be your temporary fix
You control me
Even if it's just tonight

You can call me
When you feel like
Having a good time
I'll be your temporary fix
You can call me
I'm always what you like

Let me be your good night

We can roll in the darkness
Let me touch you where your heart aches
And if you're feeling the weakness
Well, I told you, baby, that you can call me
I'll be your temporary fix
You can call me

You can call me
When you're lonely
When you can't sleep
I'll be your temporary fix
You control me
Even if it's just tonight

You can call me
When you feel like
Having a good time
I'll be your temporary fix
You can call me
I'm always what you like
Let me be your good night
