		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I found out what I've been missing
Always on the run
I've been looking for someone

Now you're here like you've been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see

That you give good love to me, baby
So good, take this heart of mine into your hands
You give good love to me (you give good love to me)
It's never too much (never too much, will never be)
Baby, you give good love (ah)

Never stopping, I was always searching
For that perfect love
The kind that girls like me dream of

Now you're here like you've been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see

That you give good love to me, baby
It's so good, take this heart of mine into your hands
You give good love to me (you give good love to me)
It's never too much (never too much, will never be) 
Baby, you give good love, ooh

Now I, I can't stop looking around
It's not what this love's all about
Our love is here to stay, to stay
Baby, you give good love

(You give good love to me) you give
(Never too much, will never be)
So good
Take this heart of mine
Into your hands
You give good love to me (you give good love to me)
Never, never too much (never too much, will never be)
No, no, no, no, no
You give good love to me (you give good love to me)
So good, so good (you give good love, baby)

(You give good love, darlin')
(You give, you give, give me)
(You give good love, honey)
(You give good love, baby)
(You give good love, darlin')
(You give, you give, give me)
(You give good love to me)

You give me good love (you give good love, baby)
Good love, good love (you give good love, darlin')
Yeah, you do
You know what I need (You give, you give, give me)

(You give good love to me) (you give good love, honey)
(Never too much, will never be) (You give, you give, give me)
(You give good love, darlin')
(You give, you give, give me)
(You give good love to me)
