		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I am the Astro-Creep
A demolition style hell
American freak, yeah
I am the crawling dead
A phantom in a box
Shadow in your head, say
Acid suicide
Freedom of the blast read the fucking lies, yeah
Scratch off the broken skin
Tear into my heart, make me do it again, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

More human than human
More human than human
More human than human

More human than human
More human than human
More human than human

Yeah, I am the jigsaw man
I turn the world around with a skeleton hand
Say, I am electric head
A cannibal core, a television said, yeah
Do not victimize
Read the motherfucker psychoholic lies, yeah
Into a psychic war
I tear my soul apart
And I eat it some more, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

More human than human
More human than human
More human than human

More human than human
More human than human
More human than human

Yeah, I am the ripper man 
A locomotion mind, love American style, yeah
I am the Nexus-One
I want more life, fucker
I ain't done yet

More human than human
More human than human
More human than human
More human than human

More human than human
More human than human
More human than human
More human than human
