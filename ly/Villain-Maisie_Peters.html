		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were sitting right there on the fire escape
And you look into her eyes
Said, "I think it's gonna rain", and I
I feel like screaming

Remember calling me the one
And saying, "Don't freak out"
Now you're kissing that girl I shouldn't worry about
How do you think I'm dealing?

Of course I wanted you to stay
But you didn't, no, you didn't, no, you didn't
Of course I want you anyway
'Course I do, yeah, I do

Now you're in her room, getting undressed
I curse you on the front of the steps
I'll burn this house, I mean it
If she's the girl of your dreams
The best thing you've ever seen
Well, what does that make me then?
I'm your villain

Oh way na-na, oh way, I know, I'm your villain
Oh way na-na, oh way, I know

Now I'm drunk and I'm mean outside your house
And you said, "This is getting ridiculous now"
Please I don't need reminding

So I call you selfish, you call someone to get me
Saying, "Jesus Christ, just move on already"
Oh, don't you think I'm trying?

Of course I wanted you to change
But you didn't, no, you didn't, no, you didn't
Of course I want you anyway
'Course I do, yeah, I do

Now you're in her room, getting undressed
I curse you on the front of the steps
I'll burn this house, I mean it
If she's the girl of your dreams
The best thing you've ever seen
Well, what does that make me then?
I'm your villain

Oh way na-na, oh way, I know, I'm your villain
Oh way na-na, oh way, I know

Blacked out, babe, and I can't shut up
Whole town's gonna hear how you messed me up
You don't wanna know, well, that's too bad
Oh, I'm out my mind and I said some shit
But I miss you more than I meant any of it
Whoa, and isn't that just sad?

Now you're in her room, getting undressed
I curse you on the front of the steps
I'll burn this house, I mean it
If she's the girl of your dreams
You love her, everyone sees
Well, what does that make me then?
I'm your villain
Oh way na-na, oh way, I know, I'm your villain
Oh way na-na, oh way, I know, I'm your villain
I'm your villain
