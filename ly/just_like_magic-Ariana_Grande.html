		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, yeah

Wake up in my bed 
I just wanna have a good day 
Think it in my head 
Then it happens how it should, ayy
Twelve o'clock, I got a team meeting 
Then a meditation at like one thirty
Then I ride to the studio 
Listenin' to some shit I wrote

Good karma, my aesthetic (aesthetic)
Keep my conscience clear, that's why I'm so magnetic 
Manifest it (yeah), I finessed it (I finessed it)
Take my pen and write some love letters to heaven

Just like magic (baby)
Just like magic (oh, yeah)
Middle finger to my thumb and then I snap it 
Just like magic (yeah)
I'm attractive (oh, yeah)
I get everything I want 'cause I attract it (oh)

Say, lookin' at my phone
But I'm tryna disconnect it (oh, yeah)
Read a fuckin' book
I be tryna stay connected (yeah)
Say it's tricky at the top
Gotta keep a slim ego for a thick wallet
Losing friends left and right
But I just send 'em love and light (oh, whoa)

Good karma, my aesthetic (my aesthetic)
Keep my conscience clear, that's why I'm so magnetic 
Manifest it (ooh), I finessed it (ooh)
Take my pen and write some love letters to heaven

Just like magic 
Just like magic 
Middle finger to my thumb and then I snap it, ayy
Just like magic 
I'm attractive 
I get everything I want 'cause I attract it

Say, I don't wanna waste your time on some dumb shit 
Password to your phone, you can miss me with that shit
Redesign your brain, we gon' make some new habits 
Just like magic (just like magic)
Just like magic 

Just like magic (baby)
Just like magic (oh)
Middle finger to my thumb and then I snap it 
Just like magic (oh)
I'm attractive (uh)
I get everything I want 'cause I attract it 
('Cause I attract it, babe)
(Mm, mm)
(Mm, babe, yeah, mm)
