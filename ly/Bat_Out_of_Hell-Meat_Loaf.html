		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The sirens are screaming, and the fires are howling
Way down in the valley tonight
There's a man in the shadows with a gun in his eye 
And a blade shining oh so bright
There's evil in the air and there's thunder in the sky
And a killer's on the bloodshot streets
And down in the tunnels where the deadly are rising
Oh, I swear I saw a young boy down in the gutter
He was starting to foam in the heat

Oh, baby you're the only thing in this whole world
That's pure and good and right
And wherever you are and wherever you go
There's always gonna be some light
But I gotta get out, I gotta break it out now
Before the final crack of dawn
So we gotta make the most of our one night together
When it's over, you know
We'll both be so alone

Like a bat out of hell, I'll be gone when the morning comes
When the night is over, like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone, gone, gone
Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone when the morning comes
But when the day is done
And the sun goes down
And the moonlight's shining through
Then like a sinner before the gates of Heaven
I'll come crawling on back to you

I'm gonna hit the highway like a battering ram
On a silver-black phantom bike
When the metal is hot, and the engine is hungry
And we're all about to see the light
Nothing ever grows in this rotting old hole
And everything is stunted and lost
And nothing really rocks, and nothing really rolls
And nothing's ever worth the cost

Well I know that I'm damned if I never get out
And maybe I'm damned if I do
But with every other beat I've got left in my heart
You know I'd rather be damned with you
Well, if I gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned
Dancing through the night with you
Well, if I gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned
Gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned
Gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned
Dancing through the night
Dancing through the night
Dancing through the night with you

Oh, baby you're the only thing in this whole world
That's pure and good and right
And wherever you are and wherever you go
There's always gonna be some light
But I gotta get out, I gotta break it out now
Before the final crack of dawn
So we gotta make the most of our one night together
When it's over, you know
We'll both be so alone

Like a bat out of hell, I'll be gone when the morning comes
When the night is over, like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone, gone, gone
Like a bat out of hell, I'll be gone when the morning comes
But when the day is done
And the sun goes down
And the moonlight's shining through
Then like a sinner before the gates of Heaven
I'll come crawling on back to you

Then like a sinner before the gates of Heaven 
I'll come crawling on back to you

Well, I can see myself tearing up the road, faster
Than any other boy has ever gone
And my skin is raw, but my soul is ripe
And no one's gonna stop me now, I'm gonna make my escape
But I can't stop thinking of you
And I never see the sudden curve 'til it's way too late
And I never see the sudden curve 'til it's way too late

Then I'm down at the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun
Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike
And I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell
And the last thing I see is my heart, still beating
Breaking out of my body and flying away
Like a bat out of hell

Then I'm down in the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun
Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike
And I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell
And the last thing I see is my heart
Still beating, still beating
Breaking out of my body and flying away

Like a bat out of hell
Oh, like a bat out of hell
Oh, like a bat out of hell
Oh, like a bat out of hell (I'll be gone when the morning comes)
Oh, like a bat out of hell (I'll be gone when the morning comes)
Oh, like a bat out of hell
