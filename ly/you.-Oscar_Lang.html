		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Years spent alone
I thought that I was happy on my own
Then you came along
Made me realize that I was wrong

It's you
It's you
It's you
It's you

I don't think you know
You came and found me when I was at my low
Time's moving slow
Yeah, it's time for us to give it a go

It's you
It's you
It's you
It's you
