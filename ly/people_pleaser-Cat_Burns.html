		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hate confrontation
It makes me uncomfortable
My brain goes hazy, racin'
My mind get vulnerable

It's a lose-lose situation (delayin')
Communication (just makes it worse)
I wish I could just say it straight away

Oh, I hate bein' this way
Learnt it from such a young age
My needs and wants ain't important anyway

When you say something's wrong
I just wanna make it better
Oh, but I realize that you just wanted me to listen
But listen, when I see you cry
I can't stand what I feel inside
Oh, I just wanna fix you (fix you)
Guess I'm what they call a people, people, people pleaser
Pleaser, pleaser, guess I'm what they call a people, people, people

I put my comfort behind everyone else all my life
Find it so hard to describe, unless you do it too (I know)

It's a lose-lose situation (delayin')
Communication (just makes it worse)
I wish I could just say it straight away

Oh, I hate bein' this way
Learnt it from such a young age
My needs and wants ain't important anyway

When you say something's wrong
I just wanna make it better
Oh, but I realize that you just wanted me to listen
But listen, when I see you cry
I can't stand what I feel inside
Oh, I just wanna fix you (fix you)
Guess I'm what they call a people, people, people pleaser
Pleaser, pleaser, guess I'm what they call a people, people, people

Pleaser, pleaser, pleaser
Guess I'm what they call a people, people, people pleaser
Pleaser, pleaser
Guess I'm what they call a people, people, people pleaser
