		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When we talk my mind goes black
Take so much I can't take back
Did you know it'd get this bad
Not like you'd understand

All my friends think I'm so weak
I can't stand on my two feet
Can't they see I'm trying to breathe
I can't feel, I can't speak

Got home late yesterday
It always goes your way
I don't know what to say
I'm so sorry

I'm stuck in a losing game
You never take the blame
You promise that you'd change
Isn't that a shame

Aren't you glad I can't fight back
Break me down till I break down
Losing hope that I'll get out
Bet they'll know when I'm found

And I love the way you care for me
And I'll be happy when you bury me
And I can't wait to see you cry for me
And I hope that you know it's all your fault

Got home late yesterday
It always goes your way
I don't know what to say
I'm so sorry

I'm stuck in a losing game
You never take the blame
You promise that you'd change
Isn't that a shame
