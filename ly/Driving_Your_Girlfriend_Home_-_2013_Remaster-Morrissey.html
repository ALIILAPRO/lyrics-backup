		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm driving 
Your girlfriend home 
And she's saying 
How she never chose you 
"Turn left", she says 
I turn left 
And she says 
"So how did I end up 
So deeply involved in 
The very existence 
I planned on avoiding?"
And I can't answer 

I'm driving 
Your girlfriend home 
And she's laughing 
To stop herself crying 
"Drive on", she says 
I drive on 
And she says 
"So how did I end up 
Attached to this person 
When his sense of humor 
Gets gradually worser ?" 
And I can't tell her 

I'm parking 
Outside her home 
And we're shaking hands 
Goodnight, so politely
