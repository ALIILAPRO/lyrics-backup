		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was going through my call log
The other day and all I saw was your name
I was thinking what I'm thinking
This girl got me feeling some kinda way

'Cause baby I never thought I wold be the one who's so caught up
But now I see, you differently, like maybe this is some kind of love ooh

Giving me cute names, yeah like that, ayye
If there call trouble, call her right back
Showing PDA in every way eh
I never pictured me doing this saying

Hey girl I wanna give you a round of applause
You deserve a standing ovation
'cause you got me falling in love, with all the things you do
Hey girl I wanna give you a round of applause
You deserve a standing ovation

'Cause you got me falling in love, and I'm your biggest fan, baby
I cant believe how, you got me open, that there's 25 hours in a day,
Is it voodoo? that you use, that's got my tongue tied with no words to say
'Cause lately, we've been spending time and baby I don't care
I don't, I don't
I'm in to this, whatever this is, and I'm not tryna share, no no

Giving me cute names, yeah like that, aye
If there call trouble, call her right back
Showing PDA in every way eh
I never pictured me doing this saying

Hey girl I wanna give you a round of applause
You deserve a standing ovation
'Cause you got me falling in love, with all the things you do
Hey girl I wanna give you a round of applause
You deserve a standing ovation
'Cause you got me falling in love, with all the things you do

I never thought this
Could be what it's
Become were the
Young and that it's
Turned into love

And I can't go on without you!

So here we are on the bridge
Be more than just a big
Mommy's girl
And fall in love

It's a story of us!

Hey girl I wanna give you a round of applause
You deserve a standing ovation
'Cause you got me falling in love, with all the things you do
Hey girl I wanna give you a round of applause
You deserve a standing ovation
'Cause you got me falling in love, with all the things you do
