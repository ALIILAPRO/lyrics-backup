		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you ready? It's time for war
We'll break down these fucking doors
Smash the windows, tear down the walls
We won't stop 'til it's all destroyed

Let it out, just let it show
We'll burn it down and we'll lose control
Set the fires, can you feel the heat?
Tonight we're alive, there's no time to sleep

Whoa, riot
Whoa, riot
Whoa, here come the sirens, here comes the law
Whoa, run from the sirens, run from the law
Whoa

Round two, are you feeling alive?
We'll overcome, we'll fucking survive
Smash the boundaries, breaking the law
We can't stop till it's all destroyed

Let it out, just let it go
We'll burn it down, we'll lose control
Set the fires, can you feel the heat?
Tonight we're alive, there's no time to sleep

Whoa, riot
Whoa, riot
Whoa, here come the sirens, here comes the law
Whoa, run from the sirens, run from the law
Whoa
It's time to tear it all

Riot
Whoa, riot
Whoa, here come the sirens, here comes the law
Whoa, run from the sirens, run from the law
Whoa, whoa, riot
