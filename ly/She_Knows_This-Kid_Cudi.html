		  Scott, let it go
Don't give 'em the satisfaction
What if I want the satisfaction?

(Hmm-hmm-hmm) Yeah, and she see me, she knows this
(Hmm-hmm-hmm) Yeah, and she screamin', she knows this
(Hmm-hmm-hmm) Yeah, and she see me, she knows this, yeah, hmm

(Hmm-hmm-hmm) Yeah, and she see me, she knows this
(Hmm-hmm-hmm) Yeah, and she screamin', she knows this
(Hmm-hmm-hmm) Yeah, and she see me, she knows this, yeah, hmm-hmm

Here we go, step in (yeah, yeah)
And we gon' tear shit up (uh)
Yeah, they got double cups, so me and my boo got two fat blunts (yeah)
Roll it up (gang)
Ooh, talk about dude, I give two fucks (fuck)
But we know (ooh), truth 
Duck all the ho shit, burnin' the burnt clips
Now listen, wow, baby, let me set it off
In your itty-bitty 'kini, such a vision, oh
You my fix, you's a hit in forever long
Workin' it, your sweaty body, love to see it go
Take a ride if you like and see
Do whatever you like and we (yeah)
On a mission tonight, ooh-ooh
Live a hell of a life (yeah)
Someone say they saw that man, ayy
And they say, "no, ain't no controllin' him," ayy
Yeah, it's a myth, up in this bitch
No takin' flicks, climbed out the treacherous, bottomless pit
Yeah, I'm reborn and my life is the shit, heaven (go)

(Hmm-hmm-hmm) Yeah, and she see me, she knows this
(Hmm-hmm-hmm) Yeah, and she screamin', she knows this
(Hmm-hmm-hmm) Yeah, and she see me, she knows this, yeah, hmm

(Hmm-hmm-hmm) Yeah, and she see me, she knows this
(Hmm-hmm-hmm) Yeah, and she screamin', she knows this
(Hmm-hmm-hmm) Yeah, and she see me, she knows this, yeah, hmm-hmm

Yeah, gangs of women givin' love and easy sinnin'
Suppose you got two hoes, that go both ways, don't know my limit
Know what it is, fall into the void, this how I'm livin'
Can't ask for better options, it's the captain of the ship, isn't it?
Yo, yo, this for my sanity
Some play some days into the night
I say you can't judge me, babe, I'm twisted in the brain, know why (yeah)
See I can't be stressin' (no, no, I can't stress)
I just need my medicine (yeah, baby, I need it)
Baby, come and learn these lessons (come, baby, and see 'em)
Been around and around again (boom, boom, boom, boom)
Cuttin' loose with the troops, and no, we ain't lie
This the move, come and tell your crew, get inside the groove
We at trippy house, show me how you do
Live a hell of a life

(Hmm-hmm-hmm) Yeah, and she see me, she knows this
(Hmm-hmm-hmm) Yeah, and she screamin', she knows this
(Hmm-hmm-hmm) Yeah, and she see me, she knows this, yeah, hmm (hmm-hmm)

(Hmm-hmm-hmm) Yeah, and she see me, she knows this
(Hmm-hmm-hmm) Yeah, and she screamin', she knows this
(Hmm-hmm-hmm) Yeah, and she see me, she knows this, yeah, hmm-hmm (hmm-hmm)

Yeah, yeah
Gettin', gettin', gettin' crazy
Hmm-hmm
