		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

I wanna live life fast, I don't know how to slow down
Wanna get high, I don't know how to come down
Help me now, I'm runnin' on empty
And I don't wanna be a memory

Am I the only one that's comin' unglued?
Emotions buildin' up, they start to run you
Bottles on the shelf I'm 'bout to run through
Doin' everything I wish that I can undo, ayy
I'm by myself
And why won't no one help?
I know this can't be healthy
So I'm lookin' for a way out

I wanna live life fast, I don't know how to slow down
Wanna get high, I don't know how to come down
Help me now, I'm runnin' on empty
And I don't wanna be a memory
Live life fast, I don't know how to slow down
Wanna get high, I don't know how to come down
Help me now, I'm runnin' on empty
And I don't wanna be a memory
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
And I don't wanna be a memory
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

(Talk to me, blackbear)
Tryna find the beauty in the let down, goin' through my texts now
Tryna find the things I never said to prove a point
I'ma roll my feelings in a joint
Pieces of the story that got left out, I checked out
Wish it was, I wish it was, I wish it was a phase
Nothing you can do and there's nothing you can say
Runnin' from the, runnin' from the, runnin' from the pain
I gotta get away
(I gotta get away, gotta get away, gotta get away)

I wanna live life fast, I don't know how to slow down
Wanna get high, I don't know how to come down
Help me now, I'm runnin' on empty
And I don't wanna be a memory
Live life fast, I don't know how to slow down
Wanna get high, I don't know how to come down
Help me now, I'm runnin' on empty
And I don't wanna be a memory

Am I the only one that's comin' unglued?
(And I don't wanna be a memory)
These bottles on the shelf I'm 'bout to run through
(And I don't wanna be a memory)
I'm by myself and why won't no one help?
(And I don't wanna be a memory)
I know this can't be healthy so I'm lookin' for a way out
(And I don't wanna be a memory)
