		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't wait to see you in the mornin' (mornin')
Since I saw you, I been on it (on it)
And I can't get you off my mind (I can't get you off my mind)
How 'bout I come through tonight? (I come through tonight)
I told her, "I'll be there in five"
Don't fall asleep, I know you're tired (tired)
Open the window, kill the lights (kill the lights)
We gon' risk it all tonight

Girl, sneak me in your crib
You know what it is
I know that we just kids
But we still gotta live ('ta live)
Need you by my side
You're my favorite vibe
Promise, I'ma do you right
This time, baby, this time

Told everybody that we picture perfect, they don't see the frame is broken
Get around you and get nervous, it's been a while since we've spoken
Know that we just kids, but you been actin' crazy, what you smokin'?
Do me wrong, once, alright, but never twice, need you to focus
You know what it is, wanna feel a vibe
You know that it's here, I could change your life
Not dealin' with games, when I make the call
Baby, this time, promise you won't drop the ball, oh-ooh-woah, oh, oh

Girl, sneak me in your crib
You know what it is (hey, yeah)
I know that we just kids (now I know that we just kids)
But we still gotta live ('ta live)
Need you by my side
You're my favorite vibe
Promise, I'ma do you right
This time, baby, this time (this time)

This
Time, baby
This
Time, baby
