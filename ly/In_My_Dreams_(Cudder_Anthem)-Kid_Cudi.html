		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yea
Yea
What up

What up, you're in my dreams
I can have anything and everything I ever wanted
Yea

I can think of anything and everything I ever needed
Right here in my dreams
Everything is a-okay

I don't worry 'bout anything
'Cause every day, every day, every day is sunny
Here in my dreams now

Welcome
Yea
Welcome
You're in my dreams

This is a dream come true
Finding the perfect words to sing to you
Here in my dreams
Everything plays out exactly how I want them to
Everything turns out dope
Right here in my dreams

Welcome
Yea
Welcome
You're in my dreams now

Long before we know ourselves,
Our paths are already set in stone.
Some may never figure out their purpose in life,
And some will.
There are a lot of us who are caught up in this hell we all live in,
Content with being blinded by rules and judgment.
We live in a world where it's more okay to follow than to lead.
In this world being a leader is trouble for the system we are all accustomed to.
Being a leader in this day and age is being a threat.
Not many people stood up against the system we all call life,
But toward the end of our first ten years into the millennium we heard a voice.
A voice who was speaking to us from the underground for some time.
A voice who spoke of vulnerabilities and other human emotions
And issues never before heard so vividly and honest.
This is the story of a young man who not only believed in himself,
But his dreams too.
This is the story of The Man On The Moon.
