		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hold up
It's the motherfuckin' concrete, suicidal nightshift
Loaded with a vice grip, poppin' all you copies who keep waterin' down shit
Thinking you can rap with that artificial outfit
Your baggy pants and your bottle of crack hits

Fuck all of that shit
Fuck all you posers, let go of the mic, kid
And step into a world that you never seen
When I'm fiendin' for a microphone, I'm a microphone fiend

Bring on the motherfuckin' cutthroat, territorial piss off
Spit the deadly and ready for lift-off
Who's getting their shit tossed?
Is it the one kid running his mouth that he's sucking his thumb with?

You're damn straight I'll put it right in 'em
No anti-venom for the buck-buck
See a world that you never seen
When I'm fiendin' for a microphone, I'm a microphone fiend

Gimme a motherfuckin' mic, y'all, gimme a mic, y'all
Gimme a mic so I can rock it right, y'all
I'm out of sight, y'all, I'm out of sight, y'all
I'm out of sight when I'm blowin' up the mic, y'all
You know it
You know it

Hold up
Check out the motherfuckin' TV
The same songs, same bands everyday, fuck that
I'll blow those motherfuckers away
You wantin' to hear some 
Heavy ass metal that can penetrate deep into your ear drums?

Turn it up, motherfucker 
Turn it up, motherfucker 
Turn it up
And step into a world that you never seen
When I'm fiendin' for a microphone, I'm a microphone fiend

Gimme a motherfuckin' mic, y'all, gimme a mic, y'all
Gimme a mic so I can rock it right, y'all
I'm out of sight, y'all, I'm out of sight, y'all
I'm out of sight when I'm blowin' up the mic, y'all
You know it
You know it

It's a crazy, crazy world playin' crazy, crazy shit
On this crazy radio, I'm really sick of it
I'm a crazy, crazy man with a crazy, crazy plan
To destroy all you crazy ass wannabe ba-ba-ba-bands, ha-ha

Gimme a motherfuckin' mic, y'all, gimme a mic, y'all
Gimme a mic so I can rock it right, y'all
I'm out of sight, y'all, I'm out of sight, y'all
I'm out of sight when I'm blowin' up the mic, y'all

Gimme a mic, y'all (yeah), gimme a mic, y'all (yeah)
Gimme a mic so I can rock it right, y'all (yeah)
I'm out of sight, y'all (What?), I'm out of sight, y'all (What?)
I'm out of sight when I'm blowin' up the mic, y'all
You know it
