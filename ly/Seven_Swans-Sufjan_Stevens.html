		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We didn't sleep too late.
There was a fire in the yard.
All of the tress were in light.
They had no faces to show.
I saw a sign in the sky:
Seven swans, seven swans, seven swans.
I heard a voice in my mind:
"I will try, I will try, I will try.
I will try, I will try, I will try."

We saw the dragon move down.
My father burned into coal.
My mother saw it from far.
She took her purse to the bed.
I saw a sign in the sky:
Seven horns, seven horns, seven horns.
I heard a voice in my mind:
"I am Lord, I am Lord, I am Lord."
He said: "I am Lord, I am Lord, I am Lord."
He said: "I am Lord, I am Lord, I am Lord."

He will take you. If you run,
He will chase you. 
He will take you. If you run,
He will chase you. 
Cause he is the Lord.
