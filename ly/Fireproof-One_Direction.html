		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I'm gonna lose my mind
Somethin' deep inside me, I can't give up
I think I'm gonna lose my mind
I roll and I roll 'til I'm out of luck
Yeah, I roll and I roll 'til I'm out of luck

I'm feelin' somethin' deep inside
Hotter than a jet stream burnin' up
I got a feelin' deep inside
It's takin', it's takin' all I've got
Yeah, it's takin', it's takin' all I got

'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do
And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do
It's been so long, it's been so long
Maybe you are fireproof
'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do

I think I'm gonna win this time
Ridin' on the wind and I won't give up
I think I'm gonna win this time
I roll and I roll 'til I change my luck
Yeah, I roll and I roll 'til I change my luck

'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do
And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do
It's been so long, it's been so long
You must be fireproof
'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do

'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do
And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do
It's been so long, it's been so long
Maybe you are fireproof
'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do
