		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you remember where we started?
Before we lost our innocence
Never thought about tomorrow
On the run, chasing the sun
I never thought it could be over
So many things I never said
Another day, another sorrow
I'm okay

But I, I just wish that you were here right now
Yeah, I, I just wish that you would know by now
How much you mean to me
In a moment under all our tears and all our memories
So I just wish that you were here right now
To make me whole again

To make me whole again
Make me whole again
Make me whole again
So I just wish that you were here right now
To make me whole again

No, I don't know how it happened
I woke up and you were gone
I wondered, was it all a dream?
You and I, chasing the sun
And now I'm feeling California
While I'm tripping in the dark
Another night, I still miss ya
It's alright

But I, I just wish that you were here right now
Yeah, I, I just wish that you would know by now
How much you mean to me
In a moment under all our tears and all our memories
So I just wish that you were here right now
To make me whole again

So I just wish that you were here right now
To make me whole again
Make me whole again
Make me whole again
So I just wish that you were here right now
To make me whole again
