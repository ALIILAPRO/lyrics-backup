		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I like the way you breathe
Yeah you look good on me
I give you everything
Without the guarantees

Sometimes I want to lie
Then you make me crack
Hold my face
And say I made you laugh

I feel like I'm a part of something
That's gonna last for the rest of my life
I'm coming out of the darkness running
I'm stumbling into the light

You're free like the ocean
You're deep like the sea
You're wild like a river
Running through me

She said
Hold me closer
The nights get colder
Come a little closer
You feel so good
You make me feel so good

You're free like the ocean
You're deep like the sea
You're wild like a river
You feel so good
You make me feel so good

It's like a fantasy
I thought it'd never be
I counted one, two, three
But you held on to me
Like you're a natural
I never saw you try
And when my world falls down
You always make it right

I feel like I'm a part of something
That's gonna last for the rest of my life
I'm coming out of the darkness running
I'm stumbling into the light

You're free like the ocean
You're deep like the sea
You're wild like a river
Running through me

She said
Hold me closer
The nights get colder
Come a little closer
You feel so good
You make me feel so good

You're free like the ocean
You're deep like the sea
You're wild like a river
You feel so good
You make me feel so good

Free like the ocean
Deep like the sea
Wild like a river

You feel so good
You make me feel so good

You feel so good
You make me feel so good

You feel so good
You make me feel so good
