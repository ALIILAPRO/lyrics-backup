		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's time to bring together
Time for a brand new start
We gonna put it in motion
Break down what keeps us apart
No more, no division we down
New team, got the vision, unite
So we stand, now we living marching

In the light, one two, one two like
I see you (you see me)
Imperfect (perfectly)
Face to face 
We can see clearly our similarities like
Day and night, wrong or right
We come together for a good time

We're gonna break this down
We're gonna rock the town
Everyone all around
Let's be whoever like this
Stronger together like this

Believing in second chances
And we're all starting today
Marching on in a new land
Our world's a better, a better place
Welcome, the addition new love
Unity, new beginning for us
Harmony that's the mission marching

In the light, one two, one two like
I see you (you see me)
Imperfect (perfectly)
Face to face 
We can see clearly our similarities like
Day and night, wrong or right
We come together for a good time

We're gonna break this down
We're gonna rock the town
Everyone all around
Just be whoever like this
Stronger together like this
We reunited like this

Bringing it, bringing it, b-b-b-bringing it down
Bringing it, bringing it, b-b-b-bringing it down
Bringing it, bringing it, b-b-b-bringing it down
Bringing it, bringing it, b-b-b-bringing it down (down)

We're gonna break this down (break this down)
We're gonna rock the town (oh, we're gonna rock this town)
Everyone all around (oh, around)
Just be whoever like this (come on)
Stronger together like this (uh)
We be united like this

We're gonna break this down (come on, we're gonna break this down)
We're gonna rock the town (come on, everybody on the isle gonna like this)
Everyone all around (oh, around)
Just be whoever like this
Stronger together like this (stronger together like this)
We reunited like this (hey)

Bringing it, bringing it, b-b-bringing it down
