		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The struggle every day 
The shadow and the stain 
Look for a place to to stay 
So get out 
The silence seems so loud 
When darkness clouds my mind 
I listen for the whisper 
But can't hear past the screaming inside 
There's sorrow and there's pain 
There's shame and theres regret 
It seems that nothing can remove 
The shadow and the stain 

I reach for you  
And wonder if you try to hide 
I know you're near  
But I feel like your locked inside 
When will redemption come 
When will the day pass by 
When will the noise inside 
Lose the the will to fight 

Thoughts race around my mind 
There's many restless nights 

As soon as quiet comes 
I get startled by the sight 
Of haunting memories 
That just won't go away 
I Try to tell myself 
That everything will be ok 
There's sorrow and there's pain 
There's shame and theres regret 
It seems that nothing can remove 
The shadow and the stain 

I reach for you  
And wonder if you try to hide 
I know you're near  
But I feel like your locked inside 
When will redemption come 
When will the day pass by 
When will the noise inside 
Lose the the will to fight 

Shatters echo through the dark 
Of the void that lives inside 
Lips are moving  
Words won't come out 
I wait for you  
I watch for you 
I know your here but  
I can't hear the voice  
When will redemption come 
Will you still hide you face 
When will the day Pass by 
(Through the noise) 
When will the noise inside 
When will redemption come 
When will the day Pass by 
When will the noise  
Lose the Fight
