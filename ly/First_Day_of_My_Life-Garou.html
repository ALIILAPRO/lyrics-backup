		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So I found a reason to stay alive
To try a little harder see the other side
Talking to myself too many sleepless nights
Tryna find a reason to this stupid life

I don't want your sympathy
Sometimes I don't know who to be

Hey, what you looking for?
No one knows the answer they just want more
Hey, who's gonna make it right?
This could be the first day of my life

So I found a reason to let it go
Tell you that I'm smiling
But I still need to grow
Will I find salvation in the arms of love?
Will it stop me searching?
Will it be enough?

Mmm, I don't want your sympathy
Sometimes I don't know who to be

Hey, what you looking for?
No one knows the answer
But you just want more
Hey, who's gonna make it right?
This could be the first day of my life

The first time to really feel alive
The first time to break the chain
The first time to walk away from pain

Hey, what you looking for?
No one has the answer you just want more
Hey, who's gonna make it right
This could be the first day of my life
Oh, hey what you looking for?
No one has the answer they just want more
Hey, who's gonna shine a light?
This could be the first day of my life
