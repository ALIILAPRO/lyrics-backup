		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody knows him he is a pleaser
Nothing else than just a teaser
Teaser of his own faint smile

Yes and how he is so amusing
Smiling can be so consuming
And so strange to explain

Oh I know how I think I might
Have known of you somehow and
What your name was

Like another man in many ways he is not
Like life itself a mystery or two
Hey Mr. Pleaser can you smile for me

Yes and how many times he hasn't
Spoken just to please not to displease
Please her if you please

Oh I know how his life resembles
Yours and you somehow are like him.
I see I have been too good for you
You know he is like me
Pleasing you and now, and now all
You do is wish I was more and more like him
If so would you consider keeping me
closer I know, I know if I was

He turns his head and doesn't see you
But when he does he looks and greets you
how are you and good luck!!

And so I call myself a pleaser
This time sitting on a secret
One secret now everybody knows
