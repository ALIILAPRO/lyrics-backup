		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So what's the plan, man
What's the dream
We get a bed two baths 
A kitchen and a TV room
And we spawn a couple kids
Tie up all the cash
And everybody's stuck there 
When the marriage turns to trash 
I want a dumpster
Clean it up put up some lights 
I won't get stuck there 
I'll only really need it at night
And if you trap me in a house 
I'll be your Sylvia Plath but 
An apartment might be alright

I don't know how this deal's gonna go
Sometimes it's so so fast sometimes so slow
But what I know about you 
Is that if we're gonna do this 
We've gotta be able to move

God damn I want a truck bed 
Clean it out put in some blankets
We'll have fun we'll run 
If the bank tries to take it
If you keep me in one place I'll be your Sylvia Plath
But just a little while would be okay
As long as we can still run away
