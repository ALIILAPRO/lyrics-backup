		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What good this deafness
That my whole life I have dread
What good this deafness
With these voices in my head

What good this deafness
If this prattle I must hear
If I were blind I'm sure they wouldn't disappear

Did you really want to believe what you're saying
Did you really want to be here alone
Have I interrupted a moment of praying
While your life's decaying
Your sins are they weighing
While you've been carving your stone
All on your own

Did you really want to sit here in silence
Could it be that brooding is part of your art
Is it an extension of artistic license
A moody defiance
Of all of life's tyrants
While you've been searching your heart
Alone with us in the dark
