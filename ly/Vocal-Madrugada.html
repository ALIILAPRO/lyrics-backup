		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You'd better run, you'd better run
You'd better not wait too long
You'd better run, you'd better run
You'd better run before you have a heart
So let's start, so let's start, so let's start tear it all apart
You'd better run, you'd better run, 
You'd better run before you have a heart

Well, oh well, oh, you know it is only so much I can take
I buried my head in that pillow for a million days, oh
Oh well, I'm sorry, but I do not care to wait
Dare not walk through the light
Dare not walk through the light

Your visions travelled far today
So why don't you run away?
Your visions travelled far today
Like in the times when you say
I haven't cried, I haven't cried
And I will not be contained
I haven't cried, I haven't cried
and I will not be contained, no.

Well, oh well, oh, you know it is only so much I can take
I buried my head in that pillow for a million days, oh
Oh well, I'm sorry, but I do not care to wait
Dare not walk through the light
Dare not walk through the light

(Hoaw!)

Dare not walk through the light
Dare not walk through the light
