		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Live from the funk
It's hotter than texas
Right from the jump, yeah
You got my attention
You give me that stuff
And it's such a blessin'
You and I get the light
Alone in this heaven

Ah baby, ah ah baby
Say you will, say you might
If this is wrong then nothin's right
Ah baby, ah ah baby
See yourself like I do
Oh, tonight looks good on you

Hey, mysterious
We don't have to act so serious
Be like nobody's watchin'
Only us
Baby, if it feels good then it must be
Bad how much I want you
Baby, if it feels good then it must be
Bad how much I want you

More than I choose to
I'm falling in love
And love, I ain't used to it
You give me that stuff
No I can't refuse you
If you and I in the light
It's alright, yeah

Ah baby, ah ah baby
Say you will, say you might
If this is wrong then nothin's right
Ah baby, ah ah baby
See yourself like I do
Oh, tonight looks good on you

Hey mysterious
We don't have to act so serious
Be like nobody's watchin'
Only us
Baby, if it feels good then it must be
Bad how much I want you
Baby, if it feels good then it must be, ooh

Want you bad
More than bad
Want you bad
Want you bad
More than bad, yeah
So rock with me, girl

Oh, rock with me, girl
Hey mysterious
We don't have to act so serious
Be like nobody's watchin'
Only us
Baby, if it feels good then it must be
Bad how much I want you
Baby, if it feels good then it must be
Bad how much I want you
Baby, if it feels good then it must be
Yeah
