		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know the house you grew up in
All of the names of your best friends
I know the way you feel about your dad
I spent the summer on your couch
You fell in love with someone else
You came to me the times that it went bad

I'm something so familiar
That you don't even notice
The way I wanna love ya
It's time that you should know this, know this

I'll catch a flight, go to the moon
Lay on the floor of your livin' room
And talk about the things that make you cry (cry)
I'll sell my soul, sell my guitar
Sleep in the back of a beat up car
Girl, just tell me what I have to do
I'll do anything for you

You know the house we grew up in
You wouldn't knock, you'd just walk in
Stay up for hours talkin' to my mom

I'm something so familiar
That you don't even notice
The way I wanna love ya
It's time that you should know this, know this

I'll catch a flight, go to the moon
Lay on the floor of your livin' room
And talk about the things that make you cry (cry)
I'll sell my soul, sell my guitar
Sleep in the back of a beat up car
Girl, just tell me what I have to do

If you say, "I wanna leave this town tonight"
Then let's do it
If we're halfway there and then you change your mind
There's nothing to it
If it takes the rest of my whole life
To prove it

I'll catch a flight, go to the moon
Lay on the floor of your livin' room
And talk about the things that make you cry (cry)
I'll never walk into another bar
I'll burn these tattoos off my arms
I'll go to hell and back if I have to
I'll do anything for you
I'll do anything for you
I'll do anything for you
