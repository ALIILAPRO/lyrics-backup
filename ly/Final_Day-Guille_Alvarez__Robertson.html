		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lost out
I've been lost out 

Remember how you would say 
live in love
live today
darling it's the final day 

and the lights go low 
and time moves slower where is home
i need to know
let me go 

Fool its the other way 
Fool its the final day 
Fool its the other way 
Fool its another day 

You're just like the lighting 
Burning my soul up 
Burning my soul upâ€¨
Let it go 

Remember how we would say 
live in love
live today
darling it's the final day 

and the lights go low 
and time moves slower where is home
i need to know
let me go 

Fool its the other way 
Fool its the final day
Fool its the other way 
Fool its another day
