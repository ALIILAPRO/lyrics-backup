		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Niggas gon' die they come with a diss
For that weed she sucking dick
Catch a murder, self defense
Free my dogs behind the fence

You around me nigga don't post no pic
They don't say his name but I know they sick
Fuck what you is we go out Saks
That new trike hawk I got it matte

Your dog had told that shit attack
He pillow talking that's a tech
Known in the net nigga where you at
He gon' get caught they put up a check

Watch how you talk when you talking them racks
We don't tolerate no disrespect
I was in that field I was off that Dex
They'll take you out for a pint of red

I know old heads that still the feds
We want the savages out the clan
Nooski died that wasn't the plan
All that talk but I know they fans

Where the thanks y'all ain't happy that we made y'all famous
We smoking tookah don't use roofs I think these Glocks more dangerous
Most of the opps they really strangers swear to god can't name em
They must've grew up in the burbs you know that's out our range

And all them niggas told on Rage I'm like this shit outrageous
Little bro ain't know where he was going shit he was just a baby
See where I'm from they pass out guns and they don't pass out bundles
And where I'm from you got that sack you better run don't fumble

The first nigga that I popped was tall like Mutombo
Even though I know how to box this ain't no royal rumble
Call his homie yea it's John Cena he thought I didn't see him
I up this Glock then rock this boat now RIP Aaliyah

A faithful man but all these prints I'm looking like a cheetah
I'm up to bet, can't bond out next I think I'm Derek Jeter
You miss your homie talking crazy well you finna meet him
The jeweler man a stupid man I put him in a reep

Credit cards and Visa, uhh
Swipe soon as I meet her, uhh
Ape shit Ceaser, uhh
Hot 4 beater, uhh

Late night creeping
Crump pack stinking
What was he thinking
Police chase leave em
(Vroom)
