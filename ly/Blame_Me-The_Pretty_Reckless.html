		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sitting in the back, baby park it or drive
Breathing out the cracks just to stay alive
Earthquake, body shake, joke is all on me
I remember when, I remember the time
Didn't have to take just to feel alive
Eyes black, head back, joke is all on me

Blame all your life on me
Blame all your life on me
I give it all for free
Blame all your life on me
On me, oh

Everything I wanted was in my hand
I gave it all up for a better man
Beat me down but on the ground I stand
Sitting in the back, baby how do you lie?
If I'm about to crack, keep the pedal in drive
All this time the joke was all on me

Blame all your life on me
Just blame all your life on me
I give it all for free
Blame all your life on me

Hear me with the wind again
Hear me with the wind I hope
I have lost a friend again
I have lost a friend I hope, how the story goes

Blame all your life on me
You blame all your life on me
Because I give it all for free
So blame all your life on me
All on me, oh
