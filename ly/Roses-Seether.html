		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You feed this disease
Which you shelter underneath the scars
And dream of bitter themes
Rendered helpless by those wicked charms,
But please don't believe when I say its hard to breathe

Save me even as you break me
Every time you rape me
Leave me coming all undone
Praise me turn your back and hate me
Every time you waste me
Keep me underneath your thumb

You bleed on the sheets
Whisper softly how you love the stars
Then plead on your knees
Pledge your promises to do no harm,
But please just let me be
I still find it hard to breathe

Save me even as you break me
Every time you rape me
Leave me coming all undone
Praise me turn your back and hate me
Every time you waste me
Keep me underneath your thumb

Save me even as you break me
Every time you rape me
Leave me coming all undone
Praise me turn your back and hate me
Every time you waste me
Keep me underneath your thumb

Save me don't turn your back and break me
Every time you rape me
Leave me coming all undone
