		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I change my clothes ten times before I take you on a date
I'm in a cold sweat, I panic, it makes me late
I know you never asked for this
I know
My shots will always miss, I know
My shots will always miss

Does everyone stare this way at you?
I only look this way at you

I change my clothes ten times before I take you on a date
I get the heebie-jeebies, and my panic makes me late
I break into a cold sweat reaching for the phone
I let it ring twice before I chicken out and decide you're not at home

Does everyone stare the way I do?
I only stare this way at you

I never noticed the size of my feet
Until I kicked you in the shins
Will you ever forgive me
For the shape I'm in
For the shape I'm in

Does everyone stare the way I do?
I only stare this way at you

I'm gonna write you a sonnet but I don't know where to start
I'm so used to laughing at the things in my heart
Last of all I'm sorry, 'cause you never asked for this
I can see I'm not your type and my shot will always miss
Always miss

Does everyone stare the way I do?
I only stare this way at you

Does everyone stare the way I do?
I only stare this way at you

Does everyone stare the way I do?
I only stare this way at you

Does everyone stare the way I do?
I only stare this way at you

Does everyone stare the way I do?
I only stare this way at you

Does everyone stare the way I do?
I only stare this way at you

Does everyone stare the way I do?
I only stare this way at you

Does everyone stare the way I do?
