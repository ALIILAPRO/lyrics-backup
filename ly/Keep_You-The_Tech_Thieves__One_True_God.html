		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dark shades, dark eyes
You're the heart of darkness in disguise
On my midnight drive
You're the moonlight keeping me alive
When the lights go out we break free
And there is nothing in this world we can't be
When the lights go out inside of me
And there is nothing in this world to keep you from me
Keep you from me
When the lights go out we break free
And there is nothing in this world we can't be
When the lights go out inside of me
And there is nothing in this world to keep you from me
Caught me by surprise
She's the one who makes me feel sublime
On my midnight drive
Nothing in this world can keep you from me
Keep you from me
When the lights go out we break free
And there is nothing in this world we can't be
When the lights go out inside of me
And there is nothing in this world to keep you from me
