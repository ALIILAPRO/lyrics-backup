		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a lovely day today
So whatever you've got to do
You've got a lovely day to do it in, that's true

And I hope whatever you've got to do
Is something that can be done by two
For I'd really like to stay

It's a lovely day today
And whatever you've got to do
I'd be so happy to be doing it with you

But if you've got something that must be done
And it can only be done by one
There is nothing more to say
Except it's a lovely day for saying
It's a lovely day

[2]

It's a lovely day today
And whatever I've got to do
I've got a lovely day to do it in, that's true

But perhaps whatever I've got to do
Is something that can be done by two
If it is then you could stay

It's a lovely day today
But you're probably busy too
So I suppose there's nothing we can do

For if you've got something that must be done
And it can only be done by one
There is nothing more to say
Except it's a lovely day for saying
It's a lovely day

[3]

It's a lovely day today
If you've something that must get done
Now don't forget two heads are better than just one

And besides I'm certain if you knew me
You'd find I'm very good company
Won't you kindly let me stay?

[4]

It's a lovely day today
And whatever we've got to do
We've got a lovely day to do it in, that's true

And I know whatever we've got to do
Is something that can be done by two

I'll say it's a lovely day for saying
It's a lovely day
