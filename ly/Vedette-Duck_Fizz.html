		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stuck in a rustic way
Still lost by my blindness
Always to try to change
Sorry for my hardness

Between the laughter and tears
Sorry for my baby
Alice really means
Everything to me

So many times wants a cigarette
You know your smoke
Baby puts me down
Around the clock like as a fuck vedette
Every day want to spend with a crown

That you wanna? You are lazy
Shallow lady change so crazy
That you wanna? You are lazy
Shallow lady change 
That you wanna? You are lazy
Shallow lady change so crazy

Between the laughter and tears
Sorry for my baby
Alice really means
Everything to me

Stuck in my hollow thoughts
Almost insecure
Now I've to go through this shit by my own

So many times wants a cigarette
You know your smoke
Baby puts me down
Around the clock like as a fuck vedette
Every day want to spend with a crown

That you wanna? You are lazy
Shallow lady change so crazy
That you wanna? You are lazy
Shallow lady change 
That you wanna? You are lazy
Shallow lady change so crazy

It may sounds complicate
But I'm going through a hell
Of all your lies, and your demons and your soft regrets 
(Sorry for my baby)

It may sounds complicate
But I'm going through a hell
(Sorry for my baby)

It may sounds complicate
But I'm going through a hell
Of all your lies, and your demons and your soft regrets 

It may sounds complicate
But I'm going through a hell
