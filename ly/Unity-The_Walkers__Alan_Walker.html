		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the dark of night
The stars light up the sky
We see them flying free
That's just like you and me

Everyone is lonely sometimes
But I would walk a thousand miles
To see your eyes
You are not alone, we are family
Hold me, let's escape all this reality

You are my symphony
By your side, we are unity
You are my energy
My guiding light, we are unity
(We are, we are) we are unity
(We are, we are) we are unity

Although the rain might pour
A thunder starts to roar
The lightning wakes the waves
But through it we are brave

Everyone is lonely sometimes
But I would walk a thousand miles
To see your eyes
You are not alone, we are family
Hold me, let's escape all this reality

You are my symphony
By your side, we are unity
You are my energy
My guiding light, we are unity
(We are, we are) we are unity
(We are, we are) we are unity

We are unity
You are my symphony (we are)
By your side (we are) we are unity
You are my energy (we are)
My guiding light (we are)
We are unity

We are unity, we are unity
