		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I miss the ways you would say you wanted me
Call me over, pull me closer
And kiss me like you and I were seventeen
Why does it seem like you don't remember?

You'd call me when you're coming down
Say you'd never let me down
Those nights you'd try to calm me down
Even though I know you're just saying that
Those are words you can't take back

This is for the hearts on fire, outta control
Boy, you gotta let 'em know
This is for the hearts on fire, singing alone
There's only one way to know
I wish you could read my mind or gimme a sign
Or tell me you wanted to be mine
This is for the hearts on fire, singing alone
There's only one we know, ha

I wish you could read my mind or gimme a sign
Tell me you wanted to be mine
This is for the hearts on fire, singing alone
There's only one we know, ha

I miss the days you would ask me anything
Say you know me, do you want me?
But now you got me looking back and wondering
Maybe I act like it's nothing to me

You'd call me when you're coming down
Say you'd never let me down
Those nights you'd try to calm me down
Even though I know you're just saying that
Those are words you can't take back

This is for the hearts on fire, outta control
Boy, you gotta let 'em know
This is for the hearts on fire, singing alone
There's only one way to know
I wish you could read my mind or gimme a sign
Tell me you wanted to be mine
This is for the hearts on fire, singing alone
Only one we know, ha

I wish you could read my mind or gimme a sign
Tell me you wanted to be mine
This is for the hearts on fire, singing alone
There's only one we know, ha
