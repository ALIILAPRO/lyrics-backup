		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  These are the eyes that can't see me
These are the hands that drop your trust
These are the boots that kick you around
This is the tongue that speaks on the inside
These are the ears that ring with hate
This is the face that I'll never change
This is the fist that grinds you down
This is the voice of silence no more

These are the legs in circles run
This is the beating you'll never know
These are the lips that taste no freedom
This is the feel that's not so safe
This is the face you'll never change
This is the god that ain't so pure
This is the god that is that pure
This is the voice of silence no more

We the people
Are we the people?
We the people
Are we the people?

Some kind of monster
Some kind of monster
Some kind of monster
This monster lives

This is the face that stones you cold
This is the moment that needs to breathe
These are the claws that scratch these wounds
This is the pain that never leaves
This is the tongue that whips you down
This is the burden of every man
These are the screams that pierce your skin
This is the voice of silence no more

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

This is the test of flesh and soul
This is the trap that smells so good
This is the flood that drains these eyes
These are the looks that chill to the bone
These are the fears that swing over head
These are the weights that hold you down
This is the end that will never end
This is the voice of silence no more

We the people
Are we the people?
We the people
Are we the people?

Some kind of monster
Some kind of monster
Some kind of monster
This monster lives

This is the cloud that swallows trust
This is the black that uncolors us
This is the face that you hide from
This is the mask that comes undone

Ominous, I'm in us
Ominous, I'm in us
Ominous, I'm in us
Ominous, I'm in us

This is the cloud that swallows trust
This is the black that uncolors us
This is the face that you hide from
This is the mask that comes undone

Ominous, I'm in us
Ominous, I'm in us
Ominous, I'm in us
Ominous, I'm in us

Are we the people?

Some kind of monster
Some kind of monster
Some kind of monster
This monster lives
