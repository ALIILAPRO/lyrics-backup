		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't cope

Make it end

Your wings make me feel like a dead weight
Fuck your stories
They're all the same
You were my satellite
A fucking parasite feeding on my grave

Gravity designs
A fatal sign for a love dancing with death

Falling from the sky
Your words are digging deeper into my brain

So strange
You know it's so strange
When your words

Crash down on my face
Don't feel ashamed
To spit your hate

I don't play your game
So I remain
Alone in the rain

Crash Down on my face
Another day
To sharp the blades

Don't stop
Till we break
Come to an end
In any fucking way

Make it end

Kill it

Your wings make me feel like a dead weight

You bring me so close to death
I still hear the echo of what we were back then

Shut it down

Forever

Get it out of my fucking head

Forever

Crash down on my face
Don't feel ashamed
To spit your hate

I don't play your game
So I remain
Alone in the rain

Crash Down on my face
Another way
To sharp the blades

Don't stop
Till we break
Come to an end
In any fucking way

Shut it down
The echo
Make it stop
