		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got to rip up the road
I got two nights in a row
Oh, we gon' put on a show
With the black bull in tow
I'm in a Holy Ghost zone
I got a trunk full of gold
Don't look at me like that
Don't look at me like this

Uh
Ooh

Can you remember my name?
I swear you're all just the same
Oh tu parlais Anglais?
Can of Stella fish fillet?
In a foreshortened future
I saw you drink your kombucha
And it really don't suit ya
And I'm not the waiter

Uh
Ooh
We not playing around
I got a black bull in town

Oh
Down

I call a wolf a wolf
This is for real, ain't no spoof
I'm breaking bones on the roof
Who me? I'm not aloof
Forsooth, for shame
I done conquered where I came
And I'm a world away
'Cause I'm a man of today

Ooh
We not playing around
The black bull's in town
The black bull's in town
We not playing around
Ooh
