		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Goin' nuts, hearing voices all night
(Voices)
Goin' nuts, hearing voices all night
(Voices)
Goin' nuts, hearing voices all night
(Voices)
Grab the AK and I'm loading up a Bakelite
(Bakelite)
Hackledown got thirty rounds and no sights
(Uh) two AKs, Redwoods matchin' bakelites
Got a Bakelite, got a Bakelite (HDOE)
In the Butcher House, loadin' them Bakelites
(Bakelite)
Got a Bakelite (HDOE) , got a Bakelite (HDOE)
We goin' nuts, we hearin' voices all night
(HDOE) hauntaholics, real Haunted Mound
Hackle Down On 'Em, HDOE, HDOE, HDOE
You ain't never been to the Haunted Mound
Got a Bakelite
(A-A-Anvil) , hear 'em all night
Goin' nuts, hearing voices all night
Grab the AK and I'm loading up a Bakelite
(H-H-H-Hauntaholics)
Hackledown got thirty rounds and no sights
(Real Haunted Mound) hackle Down On 'Em

Goin' nuts, hearing voices all night
(Voices)
Grab the AK and I'm loading up a Bakelite
(A Bakelite)
Hackledown got thirty rounds and no sights
Two AKs, Redwoods matchin' Bakelite
Got a Bakelite (HDOE) , got a Bakelite (HDOE)
In the Butcher House, loadin' them Bakelites
(The Bakelite) got a Bakelite
(HDOE) , got a Bakelite (H-H-H-Hauntaholics)
We goin' nuts, we hearin' voices all night
(HDOE)

We goin' nuts, we hearin' voices all night
(What?)
Redwood AK, with a matchin' Bakelite
(A Bakelite)
My plug from Poland, send 'em overnight
Clip hold thirty, but it only take one to die
Hackle with two K's at the same time (HDOE)
Fill you up with lead
Now you really wanna win the fight (Huh?)
Wipin' blood off just so I
Can see the red shine (HDOE)
Catch me droolin' at my AK like, "Damn
That's mine" (Bah)
Big gun, big 'K, flexin' (Flexin')
Come into the Butcher House
You gonna see some action (See some action)
Big gun, big 'K, it's shinin'
Come to the Butcher House
I need some target practice
(Grrah, grrah, grrah)

Goin' nuts, hearing voices all night
(Voices)
Grab the AK and I'm loading up a Bakelite
(A Bakelite)
Hackledown got thirty rounds and no sights
Two AKs
(HDOE) , Redwoods matchin' Bakelite (HDOE)
Got a Bakelite (HDOE) , got a Bakelite (HDOE)
In the Butcher House, loadin' them Bakelites
(A Bakelite)
Got a Bakelite (HDOE) , got a Bakelite (HDOE)
We goin' nuts, we hearin' voices all night
(H-H-H-Hauntaholics)
