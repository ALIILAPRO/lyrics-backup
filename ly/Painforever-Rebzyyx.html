		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dying on the cold floor
You just left me right there
I thought that I knew you
But that doesn't seem true
Let me kill myself now
I've been feeling stressed out
Losing all my friends now
I don't need no friends now
Cleaning up the blood stains
You make me love pain
Cutting myself every day with no shame
She said she was a scene girl
And I fucking need her
And I fucking need her

Now you're gone
What went wrong
Gonna sell my soul for fun
Die so slow
In the cold
I know where I'm gonna go
Losing hope
In your face
All you ever do is hate
Every day is a waste
Every day I lose my place
Now you're gone
What went wrong
Gonna sell my soul for fun
Die so slow
In the cold
I know where I'm gonna go
Losing hope
In your face
All you ever do is hate
Every day is a waste
Every day I lose my place

She wants to fuck me
But she don't wanna love me
She gonna harm me
I know she's gonna harm me
No respect for myself anymore
I'm not gonna help myself anymore
Empty cans all over my room
I get sad when I think of you
I need to get better but I don't care
I would get better if you were here

Now you're gone
What went wrong
Gonna sell my soul for fun
Die so slow
In the cold
I know where I'm gonna go
Losing hope
In your face
All you ever do is hate
Every day is a waste
Every day I lose my place
Now you're gone
What went wrong
Gonna sell my soul for fun
Die so slow
In the cold
I know where I'm gonna go
Losing hope
In your face
All you ever do is hate
Every day is a waste
Every day I lose my place
