		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got that feeling, that bad feeling that you don't know
I don't even know her but I hope that she comforts you tonight

Nobody here that keeps you in the shade and ever owned you
Some sentimental tears or someone else's girl that drips away

But I somehow slowly love you
And wanna keep you the same
Well, I somehow slowly know you
And wanna keep you away

I got that feeling, that bad feeling that you don't know
I don't even know her but I hope that she comforts you tonight

And I somehow slowly love you
And wanna keep you this way
Well, I somehow slowly know you
And wanna keep you away, away

And I somehow slowly love you
And wanna keep you this way
Well, I somehow slowly know you
And wanna keep you

But I somehow slowly love you
And wanna keep you the same
Well, I somehow slowly know you
And wanna keep you away
