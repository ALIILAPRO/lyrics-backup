		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In a cave beyond the light
In a cage of shadows
Questioning always what is right
And which path to follow
When a whisper calls my name
Things will never be the same

I stand to face the shadow
And hear the hollow cries
Feel the fear and wonder how
Long must they echo in the night
When a light from the crack
Of the cavern calls me back

And the angels singing choir
To all creatures great and small
Perched upon their hallowed spire
Sounding the wonder of it all
They pierce my breast and flood my mind
The Light Eternal leaves me blind

And struck dumb at the cross
Of space and time down on my knee
All is Love and all is Loss
In everything that is to be
I set a candle in the night
Keep safe the flickering light
