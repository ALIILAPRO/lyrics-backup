		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's late at night and I'm feeling down
There are couples standing on the street
Sharing summer kisses and silly sounds

So I step inside, pour a glass of wine
With a full glass and an empty heart
I search for something to occupy my mind

'Cause you are in my head, swimming forever in my head
Tangled in my dreams, swimming forever

So I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
And all the songs we used to know (we listened to)
So I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
Remember where we used to go?

Now it's morning light and it's cold outside
Caught up in a distant dream
I turn and think that you are by my side

So I leave my bed and I try to dress (I try to dress)
Wondering why my mind plays tricks
And fools me into thinking you are there

But you're still in my head
Swimming forever in my head
Not lying in my bed, just swimming forever

So I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
And all the songs we used to know (we listened to)
So I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
Remember where we used to go?

So I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
And all the songs we used to know (we listened to)
So I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
Remember where we used to go?

You are in my head, swimming forever

So I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
And all the songs we used to know (we listened to)
So I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
Remember where we used to go?

I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
To all the songs we used to know (we listened to)
I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
To all the songs, all the songs we used to know

Yeah (listen to the radio)
Oh, the songs we used to know, yeah (listen to the)
(Listen to the radio)
All the songs we used to know
