		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's two o'clock on the dot
And I haven't slept in weeks
I drink a lot, it never fails me
And so, I think, die, love six feet under
And you can't hear my voice
Call after call,  after call, after call
Twice today and ten tomorrow oh no
But you never answer

Calls endless, endless, endless, endless
Calls endless, endless, endless, endless
Calls endless, endless, endless, endless
Calls, oh endless, endlеss calls

I'll be way out of town
Where no onе's near to find me
Though no one's ever lookin' lately
I've been lucid dreamin' of you

But call after call, after call, after call
And wonderin' where you are
Hope you're not at someone's house
Please, hold on to me hold on, please
Hold on endless, endless, endless, endless
Endless, endless

Face sinks, heart swollen
Bury you, down below taste thinks guts, boy
Bury you, down below
They see your heart's pourin'
Bury you, down below
Face sinks, heart swollen
Bury you, down below taste thinks guts, boy
Bury you, down below
They see your heart's pourin'
Bury you, down below

Endless, endless, endless, endless
Endless, endless, endless, endless
