		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  as the night is closing in
unresolved and undefined
denies the need and challenges necessity
deprivation in a chaos of words
the hours break the sinews of resistance
the endline blurs
where the impossible and outsized
never learn to coexist

not for meaning
not for need
not for want alone
how can we silence
what is never said
how can we scream
away the noise

it's burning from the inside out
the restless tries not to remember
this useless insight
that sheds more light on the pain

must remain in the unbroken dark

in stages of infinite time
it lies and it waits
the nerve endings touch
the surface of my dreams
and what seems like life
stretches out eternally
i took on too much
the hours fled
and i was left here
stranded in doubt

not for meaning
not for need
not for want alone
how can we kill
what is never given
how can we scream
away the night

it burns on the inside
as i try to not remember

these endless, useless insights
not for meaning
not for need
not for want alone
how can we keep what is never spoken
here in the unbroken dark
