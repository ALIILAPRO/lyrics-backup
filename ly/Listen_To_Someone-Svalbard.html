		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Days without eating
Days without sleeping
Days without speaking

The nights are the hardest
When the voices are the loudest

Days without eating
Days without sleeping
Days without speaking

Don't tell me it's 'okay to not be okay'
then wince at everything I say

Don't act like a confidant
if you're just going to get impatient
and make patronizing suggestions
It's not my life that's the problem
It's me.

Days without eating
Days without sleeping
Days without speaking

If I could fix it like a broken limb, I would.
If I could stop these thoughts and start again, I would.
I would leap at the chance
But the chance: it does not exist
Some illnesses  they just have no fix.
Listen to someone without judgment.
