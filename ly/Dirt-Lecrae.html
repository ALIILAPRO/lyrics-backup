		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, momma told my uncle he gon' end up on a shirt
Took me on a mission, showed me how to put in work
They say when you see the opps, you squeeze until it hurt
Get me off the block before they put me in the dirt, yeah
Dirt, yeah, dirt, yeah, dirt, yeah, dirt, yeah
Only God can save me, tell my granny, "Read a verse"
Verse, verse, verse, verse
Only God can judge me, when He do it might be worse

Four G's on my hearse (my hearse)
Tell mama don't cry 'cause I'ma get up out the dirt (that's right)
We was on the county, now it's seafood out in Turks (eat)
You can keep the crystals, I like prayer that really works (yeah)
Sipping on some sizzurp
Running through the streets, that's why I barely went to chizurch (yeah)
When it's demon time, I hope you standin' on your wizard (yeah)
They might eat your lunch and send your body home for dessert (for real)
They might eat your lunch and send your body home for, woo

Momma told my uncle he gon' end up on a shirt
Took me on a mission, showed me how to put in work
They say when you see the opps, you squeeze until it hurt
Get me off the block before they put me in the dirt, yeah
Dirt, yeah, dirt, yeah, dirt, yeah, dirt, yeah
Only God can save me, tell my granny, "Read a verse"
Verse, verse, verse, verse
Only God can judge me, when He do it might be worse (yeah)

Put in work
You don't know God, you don't know your worth
My daddy left like it never hurt
I got adopted by King of earth (God)
I got arrested, was immature
Police ask questions, I never chirped (chirp)
Inside the system, they couldn't stand me
Back to the block, like I won a Grammy
Really and truly I fail (yeah)
Back how they made me, a slave in a cell
Not 'cause my momma ain't send me no mail
Got in them yard and they making them tails
Woo, yeah, huh
Welcome to hell
They give you ten if you making a sale
Tell them my mental ain't doing too well
They talking Jesus, I'm listenin' now (paid attention)

momma told my uncle he gon' end up on a shirt
Took me on a mission, showed me how to put in work
They say when you see the opps, you squeeze until it hurt
Get me off the block before they put me in the dirt, yeah
Dirt, yeah, dirt, yeah, dirt, yeah, dirt, yeah
Only God can save me, tell my granny, "Read a verse"
Verse, verse, verse, verse
Only God can judge me, when He do it might be worse
