		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Only in my darkest moments can I see the light
I think I'm prone to getting blinded when it's bright
Well, this December, I'll remember
Want you to see it when I do, ooh-ooh-ooh
God knows I do

Only in my darkest moments can I see the light
I think I'm prone to getting blinded when it's bright
Oh well, this December, I'll remember
Want you to see it when I do, ooh-ooh-ooh
God knows I do

I'm alright if you're alright
And I'm okay if you're okay
It's this state, in this state I'm living in
It's just a little bit, it's just a little bit
Lonely in this home
It's always colder on your own
My darlin', I
I let the season change my mind
Hey

Only in my darkest moments
I wanna see you with your head wide open
Empty in the ground, gone without a sound
Just another white elm growing at the end of town
Well, this December, I'll remember
Want you to see it when I do, ooh-ooh-ooh
God knows I do

Well, I'm alright if you're alright
And I'm okay if you're okay
It's this state, in this state I'm living in
It's just a little bit, it's just a little bit
Lonely in this home
It's always colder on your own
My darlin', I
I let the season change my mind

I'm alright if you're alright
I'm okay if you're okay
It's this state, in this state I'm living in
It's just a little bit, it's just a bit
Maybe, this December, I'll remember
Want you to see it when I do, ooh-ooh-ooh
God knows I do
