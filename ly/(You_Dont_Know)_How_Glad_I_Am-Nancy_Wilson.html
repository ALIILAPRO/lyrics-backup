		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My love has no beginning, my love has no end
No front no back, my love won't bend
I'm in the middle, lost in a spin
Loving you
And you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know
How glad I am

My love has no bottom, my love has no top
My love won't rise, my love won't drop
I'm in the middle and I can't stop
Loving you
And you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know
How glad I am

I wish I were a poet so that I could express
What I, what I like to say
I wish I were an artist, so that I could paint a picture
Of how I feel, how I feel today

My love has no walls on either side,
That makes my love wider than wide,
I'm in the middle and no and I can't hide
Loving you
And you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know
How glad I am

And you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know
How glad I am
How glad I am
How glad I am
How glad I am
How glad I am
