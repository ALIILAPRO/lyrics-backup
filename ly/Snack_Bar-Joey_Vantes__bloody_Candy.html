		<p>
		  Oouu
Bitch you know I’m causin static
Bouta turna Apple watch into a Patek
And you know I stay on top like the attic
I’m addicted to this Guap like a mofuckin addict like Oouu
Bitch you know I’m causin static
Bouta turna Apple Watch into a Patek
And you know I stay on top like the attic
I’m addicted to this Guap like a mofuckin addict like Oouu
120 on the dash
Fuck ah drip bitch I got this shit on splash
Ima keep it real if you ain’t talking cash then Jimmy Neutron
Bitch you know I gotta blast like Oouu
Yeah I got it on me
Michael Jackson when I Moon walk on the beat
First I gotta make sure all my niggas eat
And My pockets gettin thick and yo pockets stay petite
Like Oouu
Oouu
Bitch you know I’m causin static
Bouta turna Apple watch into a Patek
And you know I stay on top like the attic
I’m addicted to this Guap like a mofuckin addict like Oouu
Bitch you know I’m causin static
Bouta turna Apple Watch into a Patek
And you know I stay on top like the attic
I’m addicted to this Guap like a mofuckin addict like Oouu
Bitch look how I do
Same team, same squad, same crew
I’m not a ghost, but you know I keep a boo
And she bouta bless me
Like A nigga said achoo
Like Oouu
Everything a nigga say is facts
Bitch I’m gettin guap and I ain’t even trap
If I sell my Percs you know I gotta tax
Cause I gotta get money bitch I gotta make it back
Bank account gettin fat yeah it's outta shape
Lame O that’s a cold ting shouts out Drizzy Drake
Now these hoes in my DMs always actin fake
These bitches must be Australian they just wanna mate
Boy you claimin you da best hold up you a liar
City on my back I’m bouta Carey like Mariah
And you know I’m on fire, Ghost Rider
Yeah I do it by myself I don’t need a ghost writer like
Bitch you know I’m causin static
Bouta turna Apple watch into a Patek
And you know I stay on top like the attic
I’m addicted to this Guap like a mofuckin addict like
Bitch you know I’m causin static
Bouta turna Apple Watch into a Patek
And you know I stay on top like the attic
I’m addicted to this Guap like a mofuckin addict like Oouu
