		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When we started out I never believed it
I was so hopeless when it hit
I couldn't keep up with you
I don't wanna lose you
I don't wanna lose you
Wanna lose you
(I don't wanna lose you)

When we started out I never believed it
I was so hopeless when it hit
I couldn't keep up with you
When we were trying aimlessly to always achieve it
Not working out
But when we started out I could not conceive it
But I toughed up myself now
Kicked down the heartache
'Cause when we started
I don't wanna lose you (I don't wanna lose you)
Be wicked and bold now
Tough up yourself now
Don't be going off the rails now
Kick down the heartache
'Cause when we started

We are wicked young fools so behave now
Back in the arms of somebody who saved us
We are wicked young fools so behave now
Back in the arms of somebody who saved us
We are wicked young fools so behave now
Back in the arms of somebody who saved us

We are wicked and bold
We are wicked and bold
We are wicked and bold
We are wicked and bold

We are wicked young fools so behave now
Back in the arms of somebody who saved us
We are wicked young fools so behave now
Back in the arms of somebody who saved us
We are wicked young fools so behave now
Back in the arms of somebody who saved us

We are wicked and bold
We are wicked and bold
We are wicked and bold
We are wicked and bold

(I don't wanna lose you)
(Wanna lose you)

From when we started out I never believed it
Believed it
I was so hopeless when it hit
I couldn't keep up with you, you

(I don't wanna lose you)
Then we were trying aimlessly to always achieve it (achieve it)
It's not working out
But when we started out I could never conceive it
But I toughed up myself now, kicked down the heartache
'Cause when we started 
But when we started out I never believed it
Believed it
