		  Don't upset the rhythm though
Don't upset the rhythm
Don't upset the rhythm though
Don't upset the rhythm

The time is right
Th' sun is sleeping in the sky
Free your mind
You never know what you might find
What's your vice?
You know we won't compromise
So let me show you
Something super beautiful
Lets rock the boat
The magic is unstoppable
For on the floor
It's the rhythm you've been waiting for
Pure delight
Kick, snare, hat-ride!

It's all up to you
And whatever you do
Don't cut into my action
Four three two one

(go baby, go baby go!)
Don't upset the rhythm though
(go baby, go baby go!)
Don't upset the rhythm
(go baby, go baby go!)
Don't upset the rhythm, don't you dare
(go baby, go baby go!)
Don't upset the rhythm

Skin and bone
And a baton microphone
Can't get home
You can use my dog and bone
We'll crank that stereo
Even when the speakers blow
D-I-Y
Just meet me up in paradise

What-ever it takes
To carry you away
It all comes down to actions
Four three two one

(go baby, go baby go!)
Don't upset the rhythm though
(go baby, go baby go!)
Don't upset the rhythm
(go baby, go baby go!)
Don't upset the rhythm, don't you dare
(go baby, go baby go!)
Don't upset the rhythm

(go baby, go baby go)
(go baby, go baby go)
This time I like it
(go baby, go baby go)
Now don't you dare
Don't upset the rhythm

Don't upset the rhythm though
(go, go, go!)
Don't upset the rhythm 
(go, go, go!)
Don't upset the rhythm don't you dare
I told you
Don't upset the rhythm

(go baby, go baby go!)
Don't upset the rhythm though
(go baby, go baby go!)
Don't upset the rhythm
(go baby, go baby go!)
Don't upset the rhythm, don't you dare

Don't upset the rhythm
(go baby, go baby go!)
Don't upset the rhythm though
(go baby, go baby go!)
Don't upset the rhythm
(go baby, go baby go!)
Don't upset the rhythm, don't you dare
Hey!

(go baby, go baby go!)
Don't upset the rhythm though
(go baby, go baby go!)
Don't upset the rhythm
(go baby, go baby go!)
Don't upset the rhythm, don't you dare
Don't upset the rhythm
