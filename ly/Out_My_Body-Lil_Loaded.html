		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Asthesia, you a rockstar)

Pop me a X, two Percocets
Bitch, I'm out my body
Glock too stressed, aimed at his neck
I'm finna catch a body
Pop me a X, two Percocets
Bitch, I'm out my body
Glock too stressed, aimed at his neck
I'm finna catch a body

He got to die if I pop me a X
Won't give him no warnin', just put him to rest
We don't aim for no chest so boy, put down that vest
Oh, that boy hidin'? We shootin' through bricks
I went got a new Glock and extended the clip
I'm whackin' his partner, his mama, his cousin 
His auntie, and whoever else sheddin' tears
Two Percocets, I ain't feelin' no fear
Shootin' it out, it ain't safe in these years
They beat the cases just so we could be clear
A real young smacker, I do it for real
Callin' Lil Loaded, you go on that drill
I pop me an X, now I wanna kill
Keep whackin' niggas, I love how it feel
Speak on my name when I'm off of that pill
He gotta die, magician, O'Neal (Asthesia, you a rockstar)

Pop me a X, two Percocets
Bitch, I'm out my body
Glock too stressed, aimed at his neck
I'm finna catch a body
Pop me a X, two Percocets
Bitch, I'm out my body
Glock too stressed, aimed at his neck
I'm finna catch a body

The beat on fire, smokin' and shit
Diamonds the only thing cold in this bitch
I'm smokin' gas so I'm gone in this bih
She got me stuck, movin' slow in this bih
Beam on his body gon' glow in this bih
Fifty-round drum, let it blow in this bih
I'm lettin' her go if she hoein' and shit
Pop me a X and forget about love
Turn to the Devil, a handful of slugs
Throwin' up C's like I play for the Cubs
Took too many L's, I'm due for a dub
Now I'm takin' off, I'll remember the mud
Fresh as some soap but I look like some suds
Illegal money when I'm in the hood
Go get a pack and go serve all the junkies (Asthesia, you a rockstar)
I'm chasin' the money 

Pop me a X, two Percocets
Bitch, I'm out my body
Glock too stressed, aimed at his neck
I'm finna catch a body
Pop me a X, two Percocets
Bitch, I'm out my body
Glock too stressed, aimed at his neck
I'm finna catch a body
