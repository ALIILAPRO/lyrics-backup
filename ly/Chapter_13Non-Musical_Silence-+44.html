		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And we both take our revenge
But we still don't feel any better
And we'll both take our revenge
But we still won't feel any better

My heart aches from this news
Like your footsteps in crowded rooms
Feel the sweet scents of autumn blooms
Is it what you imagined?

Caught your glimpse from an empty stare
Hidden eyes behind your auburn hair
Catch my breath for the smoke to clear
And its just as it should be

We'll build and break your armor
Guilty hands
Tear my whole world apart
My minds racing
She's softly dreaming
She's scraped and sober
But there's no one listening

We'll wake up in vacant rooms
Pull you close to my aching skin
Broken glass on the porcelain
Is it what you imagined

We'll forget what we used to say
And our lives won't mean anything
Pull me close as I drift away
And its just as it should be

We'll build and break your armor
Guilty hands
Tear my whole world apart
My minds racing
She's softly dreaming
She's scraped and sober
But there's no one listening

And we both take our revenge
But we still don't feel any better
And we'll both take our revenge
But we still won't feel any better

I'm scraped and sober but there's no one listening

I'm scraped and sober but there's no on listening to me at all
