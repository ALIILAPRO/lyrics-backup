		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Will the soundtrack kindly produce a sound?
Go on, don't be nervous, go ahead, any sound
Well, that isn't quite what I had in mind

Oh my God, there's nobody who can set me right
I've been sent to torch the palace down in broad daylight

I wanna know who you told 'til they're all laying on the floor
Frozen to the core
I wanna know who you told 'til it's nobody anymore
Nobody anymore

Oh my God, I'm a giant with an appetite
Pushing people to the ground and running 'round the halls at night

I wanna know who you told 'til they're all laying on the floor
Frozen to the core
I wanna know who you told 'til it's nobody anymore
Nobody anymore

Creeping 'round, I saw a little thing I didn't like
You tried to hide
I've been creeping 'round, I saw a little thing I didn't like
You tried to hide from me

I wanna know who you told 'til there's nobody any

Nobody anymore
Nobody anymore
