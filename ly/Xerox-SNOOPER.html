		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cut, copy, paste, erase 
Look yourself right in the face 
Feeling like your first place
The winner of the human race 

Who's that over there? 
Acting like they don't care 
They're a Xerox candy bar 
Pulled up in a hot car 

Home grown, human clone 
Did it all 
On your own 

Delete, repeat x2 

Talk, talk, talk, talk


Listen to yourself speak 
Feeling like you're so unique 
Talk until you turn blue
All about nothing new 

Easy to compare
When you're full of hot air 
You're a Xerox candy bar
Pulled up in a hot car 


Home grown, human clone 
Did it all 
On your own 

Delete, repeat x2 

Talk, talk, talk, talk
