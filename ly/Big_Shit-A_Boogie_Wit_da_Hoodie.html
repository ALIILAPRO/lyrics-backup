		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Murda on the beat, so it's not nice)

Money out the ass, nigga, big shit, big rich
Milli' on my wrist, he lookin' like a big lick, lick
If I say it's lit, then it's lit, lit
Try to line me, chick-chick, boom, nigga, get hit
Told my nigga, you catch a body, just don't spit, mmh
Don't you throw up on that crime scene, they might get you
My nigga, I know you used to wildin', but one thing
If they catch you, nigga, move in silence, don't say shit, mmh

Shh, shh
Nigga, silence, nigga, shh, shh

Talkin' on the phone, that's a dub, they listening, mmh
Fuck it, I get the bag, wear Hermes like it's cheap, mmh
Big face Richie on my wrist, he shimmering, ooh
Big face Richie on my wrist, he shimmering, ooh
Big shit, talkin' out your ass like you the shit, ooh
I make 'em mad 'cause my swag so official
I get the bag, wear Hermes like it's cheap, ooh
And yeah, I know many men
Wish death upon me like I'm 50 Cent
I am the boogie man
Yeah, I pulled up in my hoodie, man
And you know what's goodie, man
Yeah, yeah, and she know what's goodie, yeah
Pick out all of her purses, I make her feel as if she was a kid again
And I don't deserve this, I am not a regular civilian
A regular person, for a song with me, I need like a million
And bitches be lurkin'
In traffic, caught you whippin' on your lil' Benz, I'm in the big body version
My Nina sing a tune like Usher on 'em, let it burn, let it burn, yeah
And don't you give my pussy away, girl, 'cause I hit it first, yeah
My baby told me that she was insecure, I had to tell her, "You're perfect"
Lamborghini mines, Aventador, then for hers, the Urus

Money out the ass, nigga, big shit, big rich
Milli' on my wrist, he lookin' like a big lick, lick
If I say it's lit, then it's lit, lit
Try to line me, chick-chick, boom, nigga, get hit
Told my nigga, you catch a body, just don't spit, mmh
Don't you throw up on that crime scene, they might get you
My nigga, I know you used to wildin', but one thing
If they catch you, nigga, move in silence, don't say shit, mmh

Shh, shh
Nigga, silence, nigga, shh, shh
