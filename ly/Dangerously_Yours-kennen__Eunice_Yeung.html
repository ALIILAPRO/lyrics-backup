		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm dangerously yours
You got me needing more
All options out the door
Eyes only for you

I'm dangerously caught
In this tale, hope I got
The lover in your plot         
Praying I don't lose

Am I rushing?
Only fools would rush in
That's what they all say, but if they knew him, they'd stop judging
Nothing, nobody else could ever fill the void
The part I hate is how I don't have a choice

Cause I'm so lost in your eyes
Can we skip to the day I call you mine?
Oh, I'm

I'm dangerously yours
You got me needing more
All options out the door
Eyes only for you

I'm dangerously caught
In this tale, hope I got
The lover in your plot         
Praying I don't lose

Oh, oh, oh my god
How can I keep up this facade
I wanna keep it cool but you got me melting
Stop myself before I go all-in 

But it's harder when you're texting me good morning
(And goodnight)
Remember my boba order 
(Fifty percent sugar, less ice)
Put our playlist on 
(You know my favorite songs)
Come on, come on

Cause I'm so lost in your eyes
Can we skip to the day I call you mine?
Oh, I'm

I'm dangerously yours
You got me needing more
All options out the door
Eyes only for you

I'm dangerously caught
In this tale, hope I got
The lover in your plot         
Praying I don't lose
