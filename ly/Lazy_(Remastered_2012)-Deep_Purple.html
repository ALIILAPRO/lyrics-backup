		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're lazy, you just stay in bed
You're lazy, you just stay in bed
You don't want no money, you don't want no bread

If you're drowning you don't clutch no straw, no, no
If you're drowning you don't clutch no straw
You don't want to live, you don't want to cry no more

Well my trying ain't done no good
I said, my trying ain't done no good
You don't make no effort, no, not like you should

Lazy, you just stay in bed
Lazy, you just stay in bed
You don't want no money, you don't want no bread
