		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They see me weak
But I greet all mankind
They love to feel
Pet my skin with their hands
I see them come and they go
And they come and I show them the way
I run to them and they pet and they talk
I don't know what to say
Yes, I do hate
When they touch all my senses
It's rough and quick
Yet they can walk around
I know
But yet they come and they go
And I'm here with the swimmer
Bored all the way
I keep it clean, keep it tidy
Ready to let them stay

They're all coming in my room, they say it's so much fun
Coming for a visit, all of the time
It's everyday, it's okay, I keep up, I feel loved and amazed
Yet I don't want them to pet me, nor judge me, or care
Them to feel me, nor lust me, or care or whatsoever

No, no, no, it tickles
When they touch all my senses
It itches, it itches, it itches
Yet they can walk around
I know, no, no, it tickles, it tickles, it tickles
Yet they touch all my senses
It itches, it does
Yet they can walk around

But they got plenty of time
They got plenty of time
They got plenty of time
They got plenty of time
But they got plenty of
Time, time, time
With the time, time, time
Within the time, the time
The time, time, time
Within the time, time, time
With the time, time, time
Within the time, the time, the time

They're all coming in my room, they say it's so much fun
Coming for a visit, all of the time
It's everyday, it's okay, I keep up, I feel loved and amazed
Yet I don't want them to pet me, nor judge me, or care
Them to feel me, nor lust me, or care or whatsoever

They're all coming in my room, they say it's so much fun
Coming for a visit, all of the time
It's everyday, it's okay, I keep up, I feel loved and amazed
Yet I don't want them to pet me, nor judge me, or care
Them to feel me, nor lust me, or care or whatsoever

Strolling in the house, swimming inside the pool
It's a nice place, it's all cozy and safe
Not so long ago, I had no one to know
Now it's everyday a show, I greet all them and I let go
