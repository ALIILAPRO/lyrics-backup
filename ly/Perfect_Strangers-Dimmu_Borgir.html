		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you remember, remember my name?
(As I flow through your life)
A thousand oceans I have flown
Cold spirit's of ice (all my life)

I am the echo of your past
I am returning the echo of a point in time
(Distant faces shine)
(A thousand warriors I have known)
Oh, we're laughing as the spirits appear

All my life
Shadows of another day
And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand we must remain
Perfect Strangers

(I know I must remain)
(I know I must remain) 
(I know I must remain)
(I know I must remain)
I know I must remain inside
This silent well of sorrow

A strand of silver hanging from the sky
(Touching more than you see)
The voice of ages in your mind (mind)
Is aching (with the dead of the night)
(Precious life) your tears are lost in falling rain

And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand we must remain
Perfect Strangers 

(I know I must remain)
(I know I must remain) 
(I know I must remain)
(I know I must remain)
(I know I must remain)
(I know I must remain)
(I know I must remain)
(I know I must remain)
