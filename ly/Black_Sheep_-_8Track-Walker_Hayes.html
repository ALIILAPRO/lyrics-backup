		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Chevrolet Blazer, square body
Back in the day, y'all, everybody down
Old Shell Road felt me thumping
Four twelves in the back
 let 'em know I was coming
White dice, black ice, freshener
All I cared about was impressing her
Had that rear-view lean on her lipstick
Thank God she had a thing for misfit's

Black sheep, black Chevy
Mobile, wasn't ready
Bump, bumping the six-disc changer
Bass kicking like Texas Ranger
She liked the way it shook
I liked the way she looked
Backseat, going far as she'd let me
So now that I'm a dad
I feel bad for her daddy
Black sheep, black Chevy

Chrome bullet-hole rims on Bridgestones
Mean limousine, tinted windows
Like a pimp pulling up at her house
Her daddy in the yard yelling
"Turn that shit down"
Truck train to the party
Back it up, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony
Mamma praying for the day I was baptized
Cops had my plate memorized

Black sheep, black Chevy
Mobile, wasn't ready
Bump, bumping the six-disc changer
Bass kicking like Texas Ranger
She liked the way it shook
I liked the way she looked
Backseat, going far as she'd let me
So now that I'm a dad
I feel bad for her daddy
Black sheep, black Chevy

Black sheep, black Chevy
So now that I'm a dad
I feel bad for her daddy
