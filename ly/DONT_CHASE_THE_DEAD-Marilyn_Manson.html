		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Angels in exile
Here lies the dead
An ice cream truck in your inferno

Don't chase the dead
Or they'll end up chasing you
Don't chase the dead
Or they'll end up chasing you

If tonight lasts forever
It won't matter if there's no tomorrow
If tonight lasts forever
It won't matter if there's no tomorrow
No tomorrow

I got my tickets to Hell
I know you so well
And I know you wanna be there too

If tonight lasts forever
It won't matter if there's no tomorrow
If tonight lasts forever
It won't matter if there's no tomorrow
No tomorrow

Don't chase the dead
Or they'll end up chasing you
Don't chase the dead
Or they'll end up chasing you
Don't chase the dead
Or they'll end up chasing you

If tonight lasts forever
It won't matter if there's no tomorrow
If tonight lasts forever
It won't matter if there's no tomorrow

Don't chase the dead
Or they'll end up chasing you
Don't chase the dead
Or they'll end up chasing you
