		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've seen your face in every place that I'll be goin'
I read your words like black hungry birds read every song

Rise and fall
Spin and call
And my name
Is carnival

Sad music in the night
Sings a scream of light out of chorus
And voices you might hear appear and disappear

In the forest
Short and tall throw the ball
And my name is carnival

Strings of yellow tears
Drip from black wire fears
In the meadow
And their white halos spin
With an anger that is thin
And turns to sorrow

King of all 
Hear me call 
Hear my name
Carnival

Here there is no law
But the arcade's penny claw 
Hanging empty
The painted laughing smile
And the turning of the style
Do not envy

And the small 
Can steal the ball
To touch the face
Of carnival

The fat woman frowns 
At screaming frightened clowns 
That move enchanted
And a shadow lie and waits
Outside your iron gates
With one wish granted

Colors fall
Throw the ball
Play the game 
Of carnival

Without a thought of size 
You come to hypnotize 
The danger
The world that comes apart
Has no single heart
When life is stranger

Wheel and call
Clawed dreams all
In the name
Of carnival

Wheel and call
Clawed dreams all
In the name
Of carnival
