		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I grew up on a tree-lined street
Parents loved me, guess I'm lucky
God knows how I learned how to cut so deep
All the things that I said last night
Did I hurt you, didn't mean to
Truth is I just wanna be right
I would change it if I could
I would, turn the darkness into good
For good

We're broken humans
There's a world we all deserve
Buried underneath the hurt
Of being human
I want to love you when I don't
I want to love you even though
We're broken humans humans
We're broken humans humans

Can't pretend that I'll ever know
The world you live in
A day in your skin
While the pain won't let you go
I would change it if I could
I would, turn your darkness into good
For good

We're broken humans
There's a world we all deserve
Buried underneath the hurt
Of being human
I want to love you when I don't
I want to love you even though
We're broken humans humans
We're broken humans humans

But the brokenness and pain
Is the reason we're the same
It's the reason we're the same

We're broken humans
There's a world we all deserve
Buried underneath the hurt
Of being human
I want to love you when I don't
I want to love you even though
We're broken humans humans
We're broken humans humans
We're broken humans humans
We're broken humans humans
