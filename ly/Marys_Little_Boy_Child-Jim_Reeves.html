		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Long time ago in Bethlehem so the Holy Bible say
Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day

Hark now hear the angels sing, new King's born today
And man will live forevermore because of Christmas Day
Trumpets sound and angels sing, listen what they say
That man will live forevermore because of Christmas Day

While Shepherds watched their flock by night they see a bright new star
Then hear a choir of angels sing music seems to come from afar
Now Joseph and his wife Mary come to Bethlehem that night
They find no place to lay the child not a single room was in sight

Hark now hear the angels sing, new King's born today
And man will live forevermore because of Christmas Day
Trumpets sound and angels sing, listen what they say
That man will live forevermore because of Christmas Day

By and by they find a little nook in a stable so forlorn
In a manger there so cold and dark, Mary's little boy was born

Hark now hear the angels sing, new King's born today
And man will live forevermore because of Christmas Day
Trumpets sound and angels sing, listen what they say
That man will live forevermore because of Christmas Day
