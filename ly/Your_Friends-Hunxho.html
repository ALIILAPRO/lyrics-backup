		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Huh, what you doing?
Where you been?
Where you going, you with your friends?
I don't like them, I'm just saying
They ain't right and I can see it
Nan' one of them gotta man
Nan' one of them gotta plan
Nan' one of them fuckin with you
Nan' one of them drive a Benz
Every one of them tried to fuck me
But I can't let you be embarrassed
Why the hell you at the club with them when we can be in Paris?
Why the hell you go outside I'm tryna fuck girl start a family
You can be with me while I'm locked in here tryna make this Grammy

Oh yeah, baby I'm the man, you know that
The bitches with you meh, you know that
Come be with your man, don't go back
They're fucking up our plans, shit
We can be in Paris, shit
Hoes they come in pairs and shit
Them hoes some embarrassments
It's a supercharged Grand Cherokee
That nigga drive a Nissan, come and get you, I embarrassed him
I've been in the lab tryna get us in, don't ask me where I've been
They ain't ready for this life we live, girl, I can't let 'em in
Girl, you match my fly, this ain't designer, you got letterman
I let you go away with them every time but, baby, never again
I can open you up restaurants, Jamaican, Mexican
I don't need you hanging out with bitches that you better than
And I don't need you hanging out at all that's something you better than
I'm serious
I ain't hating on no bitch that's something I never did
I'm curious
Why they got you outside hanging with them water men?
I'm furious
If I ask you, girl, don't tell me that's your brother dem
Like period
If I ask you girl don't tell me that you got

What you doing?
Where you been?
Where you going, you with your friends?
I don't like them, I'm just saying
They ain't right and I can see it
Nan' one of them gotta man
Nan' one of them gotta plan
Nan' one of them fuckin with you
Nan' one of them drive a Benz
Every one of them tried to fuck me
But I can't let you be embarrassed
Why the hell you at the club with them when we can be in Paris?
Why the hell you go outside, I'm tryna fuck, girl, start a family
You can be with me while I'm locked in here tryna make this Grammy
