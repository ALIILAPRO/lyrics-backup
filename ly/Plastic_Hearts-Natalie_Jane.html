		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah!
Hello
The sunny place for shady people
A crowded room where nobody goes
You can be whoever you wanna be here
And oh, I've been livin' at the Chateau
Shouldn't drive, but I should really go home
I don't even know 'em, but they won't leave here
Frightened by my own reflection
Desperate for a new connection
Pull you in, but don't you get too close
Love you now, but not tomorrow
Wrong to steal, but not to borrow
Pull you in, but don't you get too close
I've been California dreamin'
Plastic hearts are bleedin'
Keep me up all night (Keep me up)
Keep me up all night (All night)
Lost in black hole conversation
Sunrise suffocation
Keep me up all night (Keep me up)
Keep me up all night
I just wanna feel (Feel)
I just wanna feel somethin' (Feel somethin' now)
But I keep feeling nothin' all night long
All night long
All night long
All night long
Hello (Hello)
I'll tell you all the people I know (I know)
Sell you somethin' that you already own (You own)
I can be whoever you want me to be
Love me now, but not tomorrow
Fill me up, but leave me hollow
Pull me in, but don't you get too close (Oh)
I've been California dreamin'
Plastic hearts are bleedin'
Keep me up all night (Keep me up)
Keep me up all night (All night)
Lost in black hole conversations
Sunrise suffocation
Keep me up all night (Keep me up)
Keep me up all night
I just wanna feel (Feel)
I just wanna feel somethin' (Feel somethin' now)
But I keep feelin' nothin' all night long
All night long
All night long
All night long
All night long
I've been California dreamin' (Dreamin')
Plastic hearts are bleedin' (Are bleedin')
Keep me up all night (Keep me up)
Keep me up all night (All night)
Lost in black hole conversations
Sunrise suffocation
Keep me up all night (Keep me up, oh yeah)
Keep me up all night
I just wanna feel (Feel)
I just wanna feel somethin' (Feel somethin' now)
But I keep feelin' nothin' all night long
