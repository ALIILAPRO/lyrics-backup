		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well it's a cold world
And I'm in the middle
Caught in the in-between

I don't belong here
So I'm writing to you
It's wrong here
Where I'm sending you some

Letters from earth, yeah

Well it's a new world
And now I'm a stranger
Stranger than you know

I don't belong here
And I'm writing to you
With blood on my hands

What if I send you madness
What if I send you pain
And letters from earth, ooh
All right

Come on it's another game
But you gotta play on
Cause they say it's just pretend
Ask them why they say you'll never, never die
Come on the game is called the end

Well it's a cold world
And I'm in the middle
Caught in the in-between

I don't belong here
So I'm writing to you
Hey let me explain

What if I send you confusion
What is the time and the pain worth
Oh no no
I'm only sending
Letters from the earth

Letters from earth
