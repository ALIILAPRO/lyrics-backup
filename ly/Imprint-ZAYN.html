		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We can leave an imprint
'Cause this minute that I'm in
'Cause this minute's where I live with you
Where I stay with you
If you wanna stay up late

Girl we'd still make it
If the planets all faded away
And I think I'm crazy
But I know you're my baby anyway

Girl you took two minutes out of my life
Yeah who told ya I am with it, I need ya
I don't want 'em back
I just want you back in my bed
I don't want 'em back
I just want you back in my bed

You can take it all off
'Cause this love ain't got no cost
No excuses I'll be cursed for you
It's just something that I say to you
If you want it I can change

Girl we'd still make it
If the planets all faded away
And I think I'm crazy
But I know you're my baby anyway

Girl you took two minutes out of my life
Yeah who told ya I am with it, I need ya
I don't want 'em back
I just want you back in my bed
I don't want 'em back
I just want you back in my bed

I never told you sorry, oh
They say this building's from Victorian times
I guess we all got a story, oh
Just tellin' mine
Change the scenario
Jumpin' like Mario
Gotta give it all a go
Don't lose a life

Girl you took two minutes out of my life
Yeah who told ya I am with it, I need ya
I don't want 'em back
I just want you back in my bed
I don't want 'em back
I just want you back in my bed
Girl you took two minutes out of my life
Yeah who told ya I am with it, I need ya
I don't want 'em back
I just want you back in my bed
I don't want 'em back
I just want you back in my bed
