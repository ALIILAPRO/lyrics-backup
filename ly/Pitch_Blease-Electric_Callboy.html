		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I'll fuck you to death, stupid bitch!)

I call my homies, call my hoes
'Cause that's the only way it goes
I know that party's gonna be just fine
I'm coming!
Tonight we're dancing to the beat
I move my hips for you
So baby can you feel the heat?
Let's do it one more time
We're getting fucking hammered, we're getting fucking drunk!
Tonight we're gonna party, tonight I'll spread my spunk

We're getting fucking hammered, we're getting fucking drunk!
Tonight we're gonna party, tonight I'll spread my spunk

Have you seen the girl that rocks to the beat?
Everything she's got is all that I need
Have you seen the girl that rocks to the beat?
Party all night long!
Party all night long!

And that's the way it goes, you are all that I need
My party overdose, all night long (Night long)

And that's the way it goes, you are all that I need
My party overdose, all night long (Night long)

Let's party, get naughty! So baby rock your body!
Let's party, get naughty! And that's the way it goes

Let's party, get naughty! So baby rock your body!
Let's party, get naughty! And that's the way it goes

(Do you like this?)

So raise your middle fingers up to show that we don't give a fuck!
And all the single ladies wait in line
I'm cumming!
I share the liquor with my friends, I know this party never ends
And all my people scream out loud
'Cause now it's time to break the rules
Now it's time to break the rules
Just hit it!

And that's the way it goes
And that's the way it goes

Have you seen the girl that rocks to the beat?
Everything she's got is all that I need
Have you seen the girl that rocks to the beat?
Party all night long!
Party all night long!

And that's the way it goes, you are all that I need
My party overdose, all night long. (Night long)

And that's the way it goes, you are all that I need
My party overdose, all night long (Night long)

Let's party, get naughty! So baby rock your body!
Let's party, get naughty! And that's the way it goes

Let's party, get naughty! So baby rock your body!
Let's party, get naughty! And that's the way it goes

You are all that I need, you're all that I need
I wanna confess myself tonight
You are all that I need, you're all that I need
Until the end of the night
Look me in the eyes while I rip you apart
I need a hole from your cunt to your heart
