		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Even out in the open I-
Even out in the open I wanna sail a-, sail a-, sail away
Walking into a foreign life, walking out, looking all around
Been pulling my strings, shovelling my way

Ooo, I wanna feel everything, every silence
Ooo, I'm stuck in my own shadow even when I'm shining

Every morning I feel like running away
Every morning I feel like running away, away
Every morning I feel like running away
Every morning I feel like running away, away

I'm going back to the firm rigid
I'm taking back everything I said
I'm loaded on a four year loaded binge
I push it to the edge and say I jumped in
Get up when I land, do it over again
It's all in my head most of the time anyway

Ooo, it's so uninspired
Ooo, it's washing out my deepest desires

Every morning I feel like running away
Every morning I feel like running away, away
Every morning I feel like running away
Every morning I feel like running away, away

Ooo, I'm deep in it now
I wear it so well so I hear
Ooo, I'm feeling it now
I'm changing myself so I see
So I see, so I see, so I see better
So I see, so I see better
So I see, so I see better
So I see, so I see better
So I see, so I see better
So I see, so I see better
So I see, so I see better, ooo

Every morning I feel like running away
Every morning I feel like running away, running away
Every morning I feel like running away
Every morning I feel like running away, running away
Every morning I feel like running away
Every morning I feel like running away, running away
Every morning I feel like running away
Every morning I feel like running away, running away
Every morning I feel like running away
Every morning I feel like running away, running away
