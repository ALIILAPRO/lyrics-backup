		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If your child ain't all he should be now
This girl could put him right
I'll show him what he could be now
Just give me one night

I'm the Gypsy
The acid Queen
Pay before we start
The Gypsy
I'm guaranteed
To tear your soul apart

Give us a room and close the door
Leave us for a while
Your boy won't be a boy no more
Young, but not a child

I'm the Gypsy
The acid Queen
Pay before we start
The Gypsy
I'm guaranteed
To tear your soul apart
 
Gather your wits and hold on fast
Your mind must learn to roam
Just as the Gypsy Queen must do
You're gonna hit the road

My work is done now look at him
He's never been more alive
His head it shakes his fingers clutch
Watch his body writhe

I'm the Gypsy
The acid Queen
Pay before we start
The Gypsy
I'm guaranteed
To break your little heart

If your child ain't all he should be now
This girl will put him right
I'll show him what he could be now
Just give me one night

I'm the Gypsy
The acid Queen
Pay before we start
The Gypsy
I'm guaranteed
To tear your soul apart
