		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lookin' for another reason
Lookin' for a little bit of anything
Give me something to believe in
A little nothing just to get me by now

Hey, baby
Your eyes will always give it away
Yeah, baby
I'll carry you to another day

We're on the right track now
You're every sight and sound
A kiss, a casket, and all our rights and wrongs
We're gonna take it back somehow

Now we're all alone
Through blood and bone
You're all I want somehow
But now it's all our own
So don't lose hope
I think it's time we take the throne

I think we made another mistake
How many more can we take?
Hear what you're saying but it's fake
I had it coming it was written there all over your face

Hey, baby
Your life will always follow in tow
Yeah, baby
You know it's just another celebration at the end of the world

We're on the right track now
You're every sight and sound
A kiss, a casket, and all our rights and wrongs
We're gonna take it back somehow

Now we're all alone
Through blood and bone
You're all I want somehow
But now it's all our own
So don't lose hope
I think it's time we take the

Hey now, shout it back to me
Hey now, shout it back to me
Hey now, shout it back to me
Let me breathe

Hey now, shout it back to me
Hey now, shout it back to me
Hey now, shout it back to me
Let me breathe

Now we're all alone
Through blood and bone
You're all I want somehow
But now it's all our own
So don't lose hope
I think it's time we take the throne
