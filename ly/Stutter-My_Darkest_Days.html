		<p>
		  My dear my dear my dear did you not know me 
But I know you very well
Let me tell you that I
Let me tell you that I

Talk to me and tell me where you were (late last night)
You just told me you're with your friends hanging out (late last night)
You are lying , 'cause you're stuttering
Now where were you' (late last night)
Stop lyin' me about where you've been 'cause you're tickin' me off
(t-t-t-tickin' me off)

I can see you're lyin', guessin' you'll be cryin'
Stutter stutter
Stutter stutter
Stutter stutter
Stutter stutter
Stutter stutter

I smell cologne, damn it's strong
How'd you get it on'
The mess of your hair, make it stay everywhere
Uh yea (I'm not done)
You crying cuz you're lying
You my babe (I'm not done)
Stop lyin' me about where you've been 'cause you're tickin' me off
(t-t-t-tickin' me off)

I can see you're lyin', guessin' you'll be cryin'
Stutter stutter
Stutter stutter
Stutter stutter
Stutter stutter
Stutter stutter
Stutter stutter

My dear my dear my dear did you not know me 
But I know you very well
Let me tell you that I
Let me tell you that I

I can see you're lyin', guessin' you'll be cryin'
Stutter stutter
Stutter stutter
Stutter stutter
Stutter stutter
Stutter stutter
Stutter stutter
