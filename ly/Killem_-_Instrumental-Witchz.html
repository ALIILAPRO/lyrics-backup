		  Killem gotta killem
Killem gotta killem
Killem gotta killem
Killem gotta killem
Killem gotta killem
Killem gotta killem
You know they're the villains
And you know we gotta killem

Sellin lies
With the hope in our eyes
Evil minds
Now their souls gonna fly
Their confined
Agonize agonize ha
You know they're the villains
And you know we gotta killem

While
Heaven sighs
Cus it's about to feel the
Hate inside of me
Fuck their lives
Ill eat their hearts
The only things
That Brings me peace

Killem gotta killem
Killem gotta killem
Killem gotta killem
Killem gotta killem
Killem gotta killem
Killem gotta killem

Fantasize of their eyes as their tied up
Their demise
Got 'em crying
Got 'em crying ha
Load the 9
It's an eye for an eye ha
You know they're the villains
And you know we gotta killem

While
Heaven sighs
Cus it's about to feel the
Hate inside of me
Fuck their lives
Ill eat their hearts
The only things
That Brings me peace

Killem gotta killem
Killem gotta killem
Killem gotta killem
Killem gotta killem
Killem gotta killem
Killem gotta killem
