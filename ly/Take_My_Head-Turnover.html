		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Its the worst in the summer
Those happy songs on the radio
And all the pretty girls and perfect weather
All make me want to know who really cares

Cut my brain into hemispheres
I want to smash my face until it's nothing but ears
I want to paint my drain with a little red stain tonight
Take my head because it's what I want
I want to fall asleep with the tv on
And let the house burn down until it's gone with me inside

Rest my head just a little longer
I don't care what time it is
And I don't want to have to feel so badly
For all the things I said and never did

Cut my brain into hemispheres
I want to smash my face until it's nothing but ears
I want to paint my drain with a little red stain tonight
Take my head because it's what I want
I want to fall asleep with the tv on
And let the house burn down until it's gone with me inside
