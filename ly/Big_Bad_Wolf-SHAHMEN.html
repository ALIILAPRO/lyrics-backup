		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who's afraid of the big bad wolf
My heart's got a zig zag
Pulse until it even out
Marching every road back to Rome
Without a single doubt we be the story all
Our grandchildren read about
In case of Armageddon let's just read it now
Tell your fam' about the Torrent
How you slowly floated off the ground
The crowd had smoked the whole pound
There's something different in the song now
Listen to the sound of the
Letters that I'm flowing
The side that be hidden from
The world starts to open
Even if only for a moment, let it go then
'Cause tomorrow you never know
Found Bowie in the jungle down in Mexico
He followed me home, I never ever let him go

The ordeal will verse you what is ugly
Do what it must be, it does read
Keep, keep, keep striving
It's time to take a deep dive in
Alright is everything that see the moment
So we all in, for the calling, amen
We ridin', keep striving
It's time to take a deep dive in
Alright is everything that see the moment
So we all in, for the calling, amen

Word, outward, communicate with our words
It's like birds side swerve on outskirts
And offer that we explore
Open up the next door
Pockets full of export, Shahmen
And we set course directly to the
Coordinates were down south
Now we steady north
Had to pull my shit back to get it catapulted
Guess the evil manifest if
You ain't never struggling
Blood, sweat and tears
And there were times I fell
In love with the Jezebel
Maybe thought about giving up
But I never will
Keep on treasure hunting circulating at grid
Hide the Ferris wheel, paradox or parallel
Jetting still that's until I complete
My end of the deal
'Till sailors and sirens, many thrills
Broken promises
Same as silence: no record deals
From the block where it don't take
Much to get you killed
Crow feeding caterpillars but
Butterflies rarely gotten out the bucket
In the house and eat a man's justice
The ordeal will verse you what is ugly
Do what it must be it does read

Keep, keep, keep striving
Yeah, keep striving
It's time to take a deep dive in
Alright is everything that see the moment
So we all in, for the calling, amen
We ridin', keep striving
It's time to take a deep dive in
Alright is everything that see the moment
So we all in, for the calling, amen
