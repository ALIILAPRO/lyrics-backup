		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  she was a
little girl in a
big world with a
big smile and bright blue eyes
being told she could be whatever she longed to be

all is shining
so exciting
kinda nervous
but inviting
so she ran barefeet in a world shot down in flames

we’ll give her some time
to realize
and say

I don’t know what I want
there’s so much I could want
now all my dreams are haunting me

I don’t know what to say
there’s so much I could say
but nothing really bothers me

she was searching
for a purpose
but she kept running in circles
little twitch in her smile is she gonna lose her mind?

do this and a bit of that
not too much, that will make you sad
cross the line but don’t be too bad
how’s that?

so close to the ground
you’ll hear her shout
and say

I don’t know what I want
there’s so much I could want
now all my dreams are haunting me

I don’t know what to say
there’s so much I could say
but nothing really bothers me

so tune in
if you want to know if
she will get
to play the main role
or if she
purposely forgets to
not drive straight ahead oh no

so tune in
if you want to know if
she will get
to play the main role
or if she
purposely forgets to
not drive straight ahead
leave a note instead, saying

I don’t know what I want
there’s so much I could want
now all my dreams are haunting me

I don’t know what to say
there’s so much I could say
but nothing really bothers me

…so I let it be
