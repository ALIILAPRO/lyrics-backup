		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Palaces of silver and gold
Cannot be designed overnight
It's like the saying I've often been told
"No matter the cost, do things right"
You have to be careful, you have to be diligent
Planning and measuring every detail
Creating is drawing, erasing, and drawing again
And I've never been in it for fame or attention
I only work hard so the structures won't fail
But seeing it finished is worth every Mora I spend
Within every building made with pride
The architect lives on inside
Shining paint, a marble heart
That's what makes a work of art
We build and we play
Sculpting dreams out of clay
With the hope that our towers don't fall
That we won't have to see the writing on the wall
The more you work, the higher the stakes
And the bigger the sorrows to drown
'Cause one mistake is all that it takes
For the walls to come crumbling down
You have to ignore them, the echoing voices
That cackle and curse as you toil away
Cover your ears and focus on boxes and lines
And the shadowy figures, they're nothing but shadows
Like ink on a page, they have nothing to say
But maybe, just maybe, they're trying to give me a sign (a signâ€¦)
That in every building made with pride
The architect remains inside
Peeling paint, a heavy heart
That's what makes a work of art
We scream and we pray
Sculpting dreams out of clay
As we try not to look at the scrawl
The message of doom, the writing on the wall
Every day, we play this game of chance
Whirling through a desperate dance
Sketching visions in our heads
Just to see them ripped to shreds
This road that we share
Doesn't lead anywhere
But there's nothing an artist can do
When you swing your brush, you have to follow through
Within every building made with pride
The architect is trapped inside
Bleeding paint, a shattered heart
That's what makes a work of art
I'll fight for control
But the "right way" takes a toll
And still, at the end of it all
I can't escape my fate
The writing's on the wall
