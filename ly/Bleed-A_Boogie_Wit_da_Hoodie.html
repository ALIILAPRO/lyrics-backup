		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't need love, that shit is so, so petty
Don't you go tweet about it, we could speak about it
If you really, really with me

Growin' up bein' in the gas stations, in the CVSs, gettin' gifies
Yeah, and if you really my nigga
Word to mother, we gon' split it fifty-fifty
Yeah, they call me a SoundCloud boy
They stealin' my sound now, boy
I feel like I'm really the king of my city
I got the crown now, boy
Two .38's on the side of me, lookin' like a cowboy, yeah
Niggas be actin' like bitches, I might as well just call you tomboys
Don't play with me, .38 on me and I'm feelin' so, so special
Niggas is lucky I'm busy gettin' money
'Cause I really could've left you
Pull up in my hoodie on the scene, so, so scary
I prolly got more Mike Amiri jeans than Mike Amiri
Yeah, beasties, they lurk in the bushes
Now when I open my eyes, I look in the sky
Hopin' I make it to heaven
You can have family ties, the rest gotta die
You can still be a dub if you tellin'
And even if it was my cousin, it is a dub
Fuck it, just knock off his melon

I swear I don't need love, that shit is so, so petty
Don't you go tweet about it, we could speak about it
If you really, really with me
Pull up in my hoodie on the scene, so, so scary
I prolly got more Mike Amiri jeans than Mike Amiri

Heard they wanna catch me lackin', oh, please (oh, please)
Yeah, they don't know I'm really OD
Niggas rattin', eatin' on cheese
Just free the real until they all free
Hoodie on, rockin' long sleeves, uh, uh
Richard Mille made my wrist bleed, mm-mm
Lamborghini car keys, vroom, vroom
I don't know why they actin' like they G'd up, hm-mm
Wipe a nigga nose like he sneeze, uh-huh-uh
Go to Elliot for Aquafina, huh-uh
Chain lookin' like a hockey puck, huh
Like a freezer, huh

You told me never say never
Then you told me you would never get me set up (yeah)
But love is a set up already
Should've said, "I love you," to a Bentley
All them niggas that ain't even graduate
Can't leave the country, they feeling so ready
But fuck it, at least they know better
Any nigga could tell 'em, no tellin'
I done seen niggas tell on they brother
Them niggas was there for you when you were strugglin'
I done seen niggas love on they bitch
And go kiss her and hug her right after she suckin' dick
And you gotta watch out for niggas that's watchin' your money
Watch who you get money with
And don't you compete with your own gang
No, don't you go be on no funny shit
'Cause niggas will tell on they whole gang
'Cause they was jealous, so jealous, yeah
I was addicted to Balmain, I did every Amiri denim (yeah)
I'm not a regular person, I threw away all my Margielas
Got a closet with nothing but fly shit
Trendsetter from my hat to my sweater, yeah, yeah

I swear I don't need love, that shit is so, so petty
Don't you go tweet about it we could speak about it
If you really, really with me
Pull up in my hoodie on the scene, so, so scary
I prolly got more Mike Amiri jeans than Mike Amiri

Hoodie on, rockin' long sleeves, uh, uh
Richard Mille made my wrist bleed, mm-mm
Lamborghini car keys, vroom vroom
