		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll always wait for you
With the chains plug in my heart
And the pain that you couldn't be, but I do
Drowning with what you say
And putting me under your spell
I can't do much anything 'cause

I'll always wait for you
With the chains plug in my heart
And the pain that you couldn't be, but I do
Drowning with what you say
And putting me under your spell
I can't do much anything 'cause

(I'll always wait for you
With the chains plug in my heart
And the pain that you couldn't be, but I do)
Drowning with what you say
And putting me under your spell
I can't do much anything 'cause

I'll always wait for you
With the chains plug in my heart
And the pain that you couldn't be, but I do
Drowning with what you say
And putting me under your spell
I can't do much anything 'cause

I'll always wait for you
With the chains plug in my heart
And the pain that you couldn't be, but I do
Drowning with what you say
And putting me under your spell
I can't do much anything 'cause

(I'll always wait for you
With the chains plug in my heart
And the pain that you couldn't be, but I do)
