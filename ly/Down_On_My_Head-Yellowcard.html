		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I work all night
For one more day that I can say I'm all alone, alone
I just need time
And I will say what I believe and I'll come home, home
And all I know

I never thought I would wake up in bed
Watching the world coming down on my head
I'd sleep like a dog if you would never had said
This is the world coming down on your head

As life flies by
I'm not sure how I'm gonna do this all again, again
So write my line
I write this down and I'm just trying to find the end, the end
And all I know

I never thought I would wake up in bed
Watching the world coming down on my head
I'd sleep like a dog if you would never had said
This is the world coming down on your head

You gave it to me
I remember it well
You got the world coming down on your head
There's nothing to fight for, it's already dead
And this is the world coming down on my head

I never thought I would wake up in bed
Watching the world coming down on my head
I'd sleep like a dog if you would never had said
This is the world coming down on your head

I'm not gonna swallow now that I'm fed
'cause I want the world coming down on my head
I'm just gonna find out you're already dead
And that was the world coming down on your head
