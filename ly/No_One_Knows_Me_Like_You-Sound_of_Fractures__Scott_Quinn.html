		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never wanted you to see me like this
You look into my eyes and something just clicks
You see me like nobody else
When I feel like someone else

I never wanted you to hurt like this
I guess you never do but that’s the way it is
You see right through me love
You make me vulnerable

No one knows me like you

You became a light in darker places
You took the weight off i was bout to cave in
You helped me more than you know
You helped me more than you should

You taught me how to love and stop the hiding
I hope that I’m enough i’m still deciding
I just don’t want you to go
Cause no one knows me like you

No one knows me like you
