		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh
You knocked the wind outta me
Your hands are making me act up
Your lips could make a girl shut up
You
You knocked me off of my feet
And I've forgotten how to get up
Baby, you got me like a gut punch

It started out with a slip
'Til I was losing my step
Then I started to trip
Now I'm kind of obsessed
Thought I was falling
But I didn't just fall I face planted on to the floor
Never felt this feeling before
Oh God, I-I-I'm down bad for you
I didn't just fall I face planted outta my dress
Head first nose dive into your bed
Oh God, I-I-I'm down bad for you
I didn't just fall, I- uh

The way you hit so good
It's kinda making me freak out
You're making my knees weak now

It started out with a slip
'Til I was losing my step
Then I started to trip
Now I'm kind of obsessed
Thought I was falling
But I didn't just fall I face planted on to the floor
Never felt this feeling before
Oh God, I-I-I'm down bad for you
I didn't just fall I face planted outta my dress
Head first nose dive into your bed
Oh God, I-I-I'm down bad for you

I didn't just fall I face planted
I didn't just fall I face planted

I didn't just fall I face planted on to the floor
Never felt this feeling before
Oh God, I-I-I'm down bad for you
I didn't just fall I face planted outta my dress
Head first nose dive into your bed
Oh God, I-I-I'm down bad for you

I didn't just fall I face planted
I didn't just fall I face planted
