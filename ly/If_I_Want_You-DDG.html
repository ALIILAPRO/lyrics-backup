		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sliding down Doheny staying lowkey
Didn't know you was in town you should've told me
We was talkin' everyday without a cold feet
You hate me how I am, you miss the old me
Been in and out the city makin' plays
So busy losing track of time and mixing up my days
I call you when I'm lonely I come over, never stay
You sellin' me intention, but I'm cheap I never pay

You know what it is
Bills, trips, tips if I want you, yeah
Baby, don't tease, slidin', deep, between if I want you, yeah
Eighty degrees in the fall, still your heart froze
You so out of reach, now you doing the most
You know what it is
Bills, trips, tips if I want you, yeah
Yeah-yeah

I still haven't found one girl that I need
I wanna take it slow but all she wanna do is speed
She want a follow back, I told her no, I like to lead
I'm touchin' you in person, I don't need you on my feed
Childish, you so childish
I like wild shit
I like hot girls, I don't want no mild shit
From the highlight room to my houses

You know what it is
Bills, trips, tips if I want you, yeah (if I want you)
Baby, don't tease, slidin', deep, between if I want you, yeah (if I want you)
Eighty degrees in the fall, still your heart froze
You so out of reach, now you doing the most
You know what it is
Bills, trips, tips if I want you, yeah
Yeah-yeah

Yeah, long nights all alone I've been drowning in the smoke
Took a 30 way too strong
I can't feel my face no more
I got options on my phone
I don't know which girl I want

Yeah, long nights all alone I've been drowning in the smoke
Took a 30 way too strong
I can't feel my face no more
I got options on my phone
I don't know which girl I want

You know what it is
Bills, trips, tips if I want you, yeah
Baby, don't tease, slidin', deep, between if I want you, yeah
Eighty degrees in the fall, still your heart froze
You so out of reach, now you doing the most (most)
You know what it is
Bills, trips, tips if I want you, yeah
Yeah-yeah
