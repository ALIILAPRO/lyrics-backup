		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This might sound O-T-T, oh, but you plus me
Equals a feeling that I just cannot explain
Hey, BRB, oh, and a min or three
I need a minute to myself to comprehend
Why did I just see to my eyes for me?
'Cause I can't believe (she's talking to me)
And I'm sat here, just hoping my dream's come true
So are you, just dance

Wrap both your arms around my body
And dance like you are with nobody
I could not care what anyone thinks
Definitely not after those drinks
I have found my weakness in the shape of you
There's a kind of sweetness oozing out of you

What is going on? It's tricky
Giving the impression that this isn't a dead end
How did this come on so quickly?
Give me a sec 'cause I should check and seal her friends
Wait, where have they gone?
Have they upped and left?
How long have I been here? My time is a mess
And I'm sat here, just hoping my dream's come true

But I was afraid this would happen
That this would happen
And that I only came for a quick one
And now I'm on one
Just dance

Wrap both your arms around my body
And dance like you are with nobody
I could not care what anyone thinks
Definitely not after those drinks
I have found my weakness in the shape of you
There's a kind of sweetness oozing out of you

Just dance
Just dance
Just dance
Just dance
Just dance
Just dance
