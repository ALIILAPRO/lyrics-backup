		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shame on you
Blue-eyed fox
Shame on you
Blowing horns
Making holes
Shame on you

Flying south (sitting on his hands)
For the sun
In a while (sitting on his hands)
Crocodile
Shame on you (plotting his way down)
Blue-eyed fox
Slipping shroud (blaming everybody else)
Way up loud
Blowing horns (plotting his way down)
Making holes
Truly seen (blaming everybody else)
Truly you
Flying south (slipping shroud)
For the sun
In a while (way up loud)
Crocodile

Gone soft now
Gone soft now
And pull me apart
Open my eyes
Open my eyes
And pull me apart

Look at all the pretty lights
Look at all the pretty lights
Look at all the pretty lights
Look at all the pretty lights (it takes me time to get somewhere)
Look at all the pretty lights
Look at all the pretty lights (it takes me time)
Look at all the pretty lights
Look at all the pretty lights (it takes me time to get somewhere)
Look at all the pretty lights
Look at all the pretty lights (it takes me time)
Look at all the pretty lights
Look at all the pretty lights (it takes me time to get somewhere)
Look at all the pretty lights
Look at all the pretty lights (it takes me time)
Look at all the pretty lights
Look at all the pretty lights
