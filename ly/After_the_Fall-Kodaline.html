		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  People keep talking
But I can't hear a word they say
Life just keeps moving
The world gets stranger every day

And, yeah, "Time is on your side"
That's what people tell you
But I got to let you go

My head is saying that this is for the better
I just want you to know
I can't hold on forever
When all I wanna do is let go
All I wanna do is let go

Sirens are screaming
But I can't hear a single sound
And I'm feeling uneasy
And I wait, and I wait for a change to come around

I get the feeling that this is for the better
And I just want you to know
I can't hold on forever
When all I wanna do is let go (Yeah)
All I wanna do is let go

Are you searching for an answer
Or just peace of mind?
When your life has lost its meaning
Maybe you need a little time

Are you searching for an answer
Or just peace of mind?
When your life has lost its meaning
Maybe you need a little time
