		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pretty pretty pretty boy
Pretty city must destroy
Die a thousand times to hear your voice
Pretty pretty pretty boy
Pretty city must destroy
Die a thousand times to hear your voice
It feels like a thousand miles away
Everything in my mind yeah it always replays
Yeah you left me without even leaving a trace
Now I never ever want to see your face
It feels like a thousand miles away
Everything in my mind yeah it always replays
Yeah you left me without even leaving a trace
Now I never ever ever wanna see your face
Yeah I'm in the club rolling blunts now
Off a fuckin bean in the back of the club now
Yeah, and she really wanna fuck now
Yeah, taking xans just to slow me down
And I wish you were here right now
Just to see me drop a tear right now
And I wish you were here right now
Just to see me drop a tear right now
Pretty pretty pretty boy
Pretty city must destroy
Die a thousand times to hear your voice
Pretty pretty pretty boy
Pretty city must destroy
Die a thousand times to hear your voice
It feels like a thousand miles away
Everything in my mind mind always replays
Yeah you left me without leaving a trace
Now I never ever ever wanna wanna wanna
I'm in the club rolling blunts now
Off a fuckin bean in the back of the club now
Yeah, and she really wanna fuck now
Yeah, taking xans just to slow me down
And I wish you were here right now
Just to see me drop a tear right now
And I wish you were here right now
Just to see me drop a tear right now
Pretty pretty pretty boy
Pretty city must destroy
Die a thousand times to hear your voice
Pretty pretty pretty boy
Pretty city must destroy
Die a thousand times to hear your voice
It feels like a thousand miles away
Everything in my mind mind always replays
Yeah you left me without leaving a trace
Now I never ever ever wanna see your face
