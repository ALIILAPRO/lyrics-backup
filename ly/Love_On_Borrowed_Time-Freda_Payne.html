		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I was younger, ah-ah,
living confusion and deep despair.
When I was younger, ah-ah,
living illusion of freedom and power.

When I was younger, ah-ah,
full of ideals and broken dreams, my friend.
When I was younger, ah-ah,
everything simple but not so clear.

Living on borrowed time,
without a thought for tomorrow.
Living on borrowed time,
without a thought for tomorrow.

Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba,
ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba - mm - ba-ba-ba-ba.

Now I am older, uh-huh,
the more I see the less I know for sure.
Now I am older, ah-ah,
the future is brighter and now is the hour.

Living on borrowed time,
without a thought for tomorrow.
Living on borrowed time,
without a thought for tomorrow.

Good to be older, uh-huh,
would not exchange a singe day or year.
Good to be older, ah-ah, (mm, babe!)
Less complications, everything clear.

Living on borrowed time,
without a thought for tomorrow.
Living on borrowed time,
without a thought for tomorrow.

"Oh yes, it all seemed so bloody easier then.
You know, like what to wear, very serious like,
you know, am I gonna get the little pimples? 
Does she really love me, all that crap.
But now I don't bother about that shit no more,
I know she loves me! All I gotta bother about is standing up."

Uh-doo-doo-doo-doo-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah...

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-uh,
"alright, you can get out of that now."

Uh-uh-uh-uh.
