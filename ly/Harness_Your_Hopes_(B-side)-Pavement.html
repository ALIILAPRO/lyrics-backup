		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Harness your hopes
On just one person
Because you know a harness 
Was only made for one

Don't telegraph your passes
You'll end up with molasses
Cauterized in syrup
And syrup and molasses

And I'm checking out the asses
The assets that attract us
To anything that moves
We're deep inside the grooves

And it's time to shake the rations
'Cause someone's gonna cash in
The plot it turns again
The reference starts at ten

Well, show me
A word that rhymes with Pavement
And I won't kill your parents
And roast them on a spit

And a-don't you try to etch it
Or permanently sketch it
Or you're gonna catch a bad bad cold

And the freaks have stormed the White House
I moved into a lighthouse
It's on a scenic quay
It's oh so far away

Far away from the beginning
The shroud is made of linen
The yearling took your purse
The goth kid has a hearse

Heart-breaking
Earth-quaking
Kiwis they are home baking
Minds wide open truly

Leisure
A leisure suit is nothing
It's nothing to be proud of
In this late century

And I'm asking you to hold me
Just like the morning paper
Pinched between your pointer
Your index and your thumb

It's a semi-automatic
Believers are ecstatic
You see the way they cling
The cold metallic sting

And I'm living in a coma
For Donna de Varona
The harness made of hopes
The lovers on the ropes

Nun is to church
As the parrot is to perch
And my heart's
Wide open truly
