		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The chest and the head divided by a white laser
A pattern of mad strobes, you're going haywire
In your eyes, night cold, I see the end of us
You're playing your best role but the mask shatters

Where are you going, boy?
When did you get so lost?
How could you be so blind?
How could you be so blind?

A sustained heart pain and a dark fever
How did I get fooled by such a savage curse?
The more I forgive you, the more it backfires
Now you're dancing through the smoke, like nothing else matters

Where are you going, boy?
When did you get so lost?
How could you be so blind?
How could you be so blind?
