		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is the thing about people
You never really know what's inside
Somewhere in the soul, there's a secret
Hysteria grows where it was invited
This is the thing about fiction
How everything feeds on its paranoia
Wrapping it all up in tradition
Now fill up the cup, go and drink your poison

My love is a witness for the loss of your innocence
So give it all up, give it distance
Live it up for the path of resistance

This is the thing about confusion
You never really know what you'll find
You tell me what it means to be human
The freedom you seek is to free your mind

My love is a witness for the loss of your innocence
So give it all up, give it distance
Live it up for the path of resistance

This is the thing about evil
You never really know where it's hiding
Find your phantom in the cathedral
The more you search for it, the less you'll find
My love is a witness for the loss of your innocence
So give it all up, give it distance
Live it up, for the path of resistance

My love (my love) is a witness (is a witness) 
For the loss (for the loss) of your innocence
So give it all up (give it up)
Give it distance (give it distance)
Live it up (live it up)
For the path of resistance
