		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What can happen will
And I've fallen again
Too afraid to pull the plug
But sick of waiting for the end

And I've never been more concerned
With the things that I'm told to say
I try to force emotion
But my feelings waste away
So I'm stuck alone in this world
Uncomfortable in my skin
Shattered glass cannot be fixed
I will never be normal again

Laughing at my pain
No footprint
No stamp
No voice
Nothing to say
Laughing at my pain
No footprint
No stamp
I waste away

You were given the choice
To be a face but never a voice
To put everything you have
Into something they will never grasp

I destroy myself
In one ear and out the other
No room for my real mistakes
Nothing meaningful to blow my cover

All together now
All together now

Forget my words
Fall back in line
Do what you're told

Fall in line
Erase my soul
