		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got skeletons in my closet, ayy
I might just die in the mosh pit, ayy
I'm think I'm done with your nonsense, ayy
I got mob ties in the projects, yeah

Who finna stop me? Good luck, okay
Cross me, then you bound to get touched, okay
Hitman in the cut with a hammer, ayy
I feel like Tony Montana, ayy
Wake up, get the bread, 25/8
Ten bands in the bed just to keep it safe
I don't like people, everybody fake
Stay with my day ones, that'll never change
I'll never buy drip for retail, ayy
I'd rather get credit card details, yeah
Y'all spend too much on a female
I could make five bands with an email
I like cash blue, like Ã‰vian
Jit mad, I don't know what the hell he on
When it bust, he gon' run like marathons
Yup, I'ma see 'em at the Chevron

I got skeletons in my closet, ayy
I might just die in the mosh pit, ayy
I'm think I'm done with your nonsense, ayy
I got mob ties in the projects, yeah
I got skeletons in my closet, ayy
I might just die in the mosh pit, ayy
I'm think I'm done with your nonsense, ayy
I got mob ties in the projects, yeah
