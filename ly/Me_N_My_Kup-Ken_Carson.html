		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (8-808)
You ain't ever play with me, I'm on some other shit, like
(Star made the beat, I just took it out the oven)
Some whole other shit, like

Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
It's just me and my cup in this bitch
DRKSHDW all on my Rick
VVS all on my wrist
I bought an Uzi today, and it's already hot and it come with a cooling kit
She ain't fuck with me back then, but wanna fuck with me now, huh, I'm cool, lil' bitch
Huh, let's go hit a lick
Huh, let's go do a drill
I heard he got a mill' in his crib, and he stay up in the hills (8-808)
We don't give a fuck who you is, we don't give a fuck how you feel
We don't give a fuck how you feel, we don't give no fucks

I copped a Mercedes, I ditched that AMG, I'm ridin' a G-Wagon Truck
I just might go buy the SVJ, 'cause I like how the doors go up
My boy he be catchin' them bodies, he catchin' them bodies, I'm watching the scores go up
Yo' gang probably caught a few bodies, but I ain't worried about it, 'cause we droppin' more than them
Step on shit like Timbs, pull up with a FN Five-seveN, that bih' take off limbs
I just popped a private jet G6, I'm 'bout to take off, yeah
They like, "Hold up, hold up, hold up, you boutta take off right here"
I'm boutta take off
Niggas ain't fuckin' with me when it come to swag, huh, I'm passin' it out
Shawty got no respect when it come to that ass, huh, she passin' it out
I be VET-VET-VET-VETEMENTS from head to toe, even the sock
I got every Balenciaga boots, except for the Crocs
Rick Owens all over my, Rick Owens all over me
Maison Francis cologne, got this hoe all over me
I pulled up to my show, rock out this bitch, then I leave
I don't fuck with these niggas, like they got a disease
Trapper wrap around, huh-huh, I got what you need
I got this bitch, her name Chanel, and all she rocks is Double C
I got this bitch named Gabrielle and all she rocks Double G
I took my other bitch to Louis Vuitton and bought everything, yeah
If it's up then it's stuck, leave it in the air
Missionary, her legs up, I got them in the air
This bitch a freak, this bitch let me fuck her anywhere
She tryna whip it out in front of my partner, she don't even care
I'm elite with these hoes
I put a bitch in her place, I tell a bitch where to go
If I tell that lil' bitch to dance, she gon' tango
If I tell her to paint me a picture, she gon' Van Gogh
She insane with the throat
She insane with-
I tell her she's insane if she don't let the gang hit
I pass her to the gang, yeah, just like James, nigga
I be killin' that pussy, now I'm killin that pussy, feel like John Wayne, nigga
Nigga talkin that, huh, and all he heard was a bang, nigga
Give a fuck who you fuck with, as long as you don't fuck with my gang, nigga
Give a fuck who you fuck with, as long as you don't fuck with my gang, nigga

Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
It's just me and my cup in this bitch
DRKSHDW all on my Rick
VVS all on my wrist
I bought an Uzi today, and it's already hot and it come with a cooling kit
She ain't fuck with me back then, but wanna fuck with me now, huh, I'm cool, lil' bitch
Huh, let's go hit a lick
Huh, let's go do a drill
I heard he got a mill' in his crib, and he stay up in the hills
We don't give a fuck who you is, we don't give a fuck how you feel
We don't give a fuck how you feel, we don't give no fucks
