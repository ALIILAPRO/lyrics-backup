		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well the boy in the barber
Still talks about you
Crows like he knew you so well
You kissed him so dizzy
He fell on the floor
Landed right under your spell
And you live in an old blue camaro
That your dad used to drive
On the town
It's sure seen a lot more
Than he ever did
Still runs like hell on the ground

Rolling on easy
Rolling on through
Leaving this strange town
Memories of you
Rolling on easy
Rolling on through
It's easy to say
Harder to stay
Tell me what's calling you

Well you talk about places
And people you know
Fancy and free just like you
You worked as a fan
Of a travelling band
And sure learnt a thing or two
These days yeah you always
Keep moving around
From the back streets
Down to the shore
You say it's a whole lot of world
For a whole lot of girl
And the road doesn't ask me for more
