Can we at least talk about it?

Come here, sit down, let's get into this (come here)
Is it true you and that bitch been intimate? (Oh)
Are you listenin'?
Said you cut her off, and now you switchin' it up
Switchin' it up (switchin', switchin')
Got me doin' way too much (way too much)
Was it worth our love? (Switchin', switchin')
Tell me, was it worth our love?

So did you cut her off or nah? (Nah)
Or better off, just why? (Why?)
Why have you promised her the world you told me that was mine? (Mine)
Like why out here havin' fun? (Fun)
Why you got me lookin' dumb? (Dumb)
You fuckin' them, I'm tellin' niggas you the one, that I'm committed
And now that you did it, I can't ignore (I can't ignore)
I saved you, I made you withstand the fall (I saved you) 
I raised you, I made you the man you are
You expect me for me to see the next woman and hand you off?
Are you crazy?

Come here, sit down, let's get into this (unbelievable)
Is it true you and that bitch been intimate? (Hello? Hello?)
Are you listenin'?
Said you cut her off, and now you switchin' it up
Switchin' it up (switchin', switchin')
Got me doin' way too much (way too much)
Was it worth our love? (Switchin', switchin', was it worth it?)
Tell me, was it worth our love?

Yo, do you fuck her like you fuck me? (Fuck her)
You love her how you love me? (Love her)
You touch her? Do you really kiss and hug her like you hug me (wow)
What, you flooded up her busty? (Jewellery) 
You helpin' her with bills? (Yeah)
I made you who you are and now you helpin' her to build? (Wow) no way
No, this can't be the day, that you announce (no)
That it's me, that's been pavin' the way for someone else
And what's worse is that she knows, how she came to have this role
I'm sick of nurturin' the souls I'll never get to have and hold (you are bold)

Come here, sit down, let's get into this (you're so bold)
Is it true you and that bitch been intimate? (Oh my God)
Are you listenin'?
Said you cut her off, and now you switchin' it up (you fuckin' serious?)
Switchin' it up (switchin', switchin')
Got me doin' way too much (you are worse than me)
Was it worth our love? (Switchin', switchin')
Tell me, was it worth our love?

A Pisces love is like is a vice 
Like it's a piece of life
But shit, I know I have to leave to be alright
Don't wanna leave you, but why would I agree to be your wife
When in life, just to be with me, it won't suffice?
A Pisces love is like is a vice 
Like it's a piece of life
I have to leave to be alright
Don't wanna leave you, but why would I agree to be your wife
When in life, just to be with me, it won't suffice?
