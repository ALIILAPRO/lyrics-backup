		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stormy night under jet black skies
Billy pulls into town.
Thunder rolled and the lightnin' bolts
Come crashin' to the ground
Cold as ice, hard as stone
As he walks into the room,
With another man who was feelin' the same way
All hell's breakin' loose

Bang bang, shoot'em up
Bang bang, blow you away

It's a showdown, in a no-man's land
For the cowboy of the modern day.
Come on, sundown, don't be hangin' 'round,
'Cause the cowboy will blow you away

Al Capone and A Bad Boy Jones
On the wrong side of the law.
Johnny D and his company,
Always first to the draw.
Gangster lean, feelin' so mean,
Tryin' to take more than their share.
'Cause all they saw was ruling it all.
The seed of blood was in the air.

Bang bang, shoot'em up.
Bang bang, blow you away.

It's a showdown, in a no-man's land
For a cowboy of the modern day.
Come on, sundown, don't be hangin' 'round,
'Cause the cowboy will blow you away

Here we are and we've come this far,
But it's only getting worse.
The foreign lands with their terrorist demands,
Only 'cause the good to hurt.

The USA the USSR, with their six guns to their sides.
I see the message written on the wall,
Too much anger deep inside.

Bang bang, shoot'em up
Bang bang, blow you away.

It's a showdown, in a no-man's land
For the cowboy of the modern day.
Come on, sundown, don't be hangin' 'round,
'Cause the cowboy will blow you away

It's a showdown
