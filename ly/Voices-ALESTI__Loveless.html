		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This story is getting old
Turn a blind eye while it unfolds
Why do i feel so cold?
It was somewhere along the way
All my colours turned into gray and I felt it
Why am I to stay?
Something's wrong it's controlling my mind
Makes me numb and it turns me blind
I'm losing it
I'm losing it
The scene has changed the dark takes hold
Need to stop from caving in
Can't catch my breath cause I feel so cold
Silence the voices from within
Silence the voices from within
A chill running down my spine
It's trying to tell me to fold my hand and quit
I'm out of time
Something's wrong it's controlling my mind
Makes me numb and it turns me blind
Please show me why
I have to stay
The scene has changed the dark takes hold
Need to stop from caving in
Can't catch my breath cause I feel so cold
Silence the voices from within
A scar from a past I can't erase
A hole in my chest I can't replace
But I can feel it in my bones
I still feel it beneath the skin
Feel it beneath my skin
I try to run away but it grabs hold of me
I feel myself decay it takes me under
And I can't breathe
No I can't breathe
I'm losing it
But I don't want to disappear
To disappear
The scene has changed the dark takes hold
Need to stop from caving in
Can't catch my breath cause I feel so cold
Silence the voices from within
A scar from a past I can't erase
A hole in my chest I can't replace
But I can feel it in my bones
I still feel it beneath the skin
