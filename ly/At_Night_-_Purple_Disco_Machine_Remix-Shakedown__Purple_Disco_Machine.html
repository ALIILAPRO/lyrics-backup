		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I feel at night)
It seems I can't deny
Some days just don't seem right
I think I feel, I feel much better
At night

Sometimes I can't deny
Some days just don't seem right
I think I feel, I feel much better
At night

Sometimes I can't deny
Some days just pass me by
You know I feel, I feel much better
At night

(I feel)
Seems I can't deny
Some days just don't seem right
I think I feel, I feel much better
At night

Sometimes I can't deny
Some days just pass me by
You know I feel, I feel much better
At night

Yeah
