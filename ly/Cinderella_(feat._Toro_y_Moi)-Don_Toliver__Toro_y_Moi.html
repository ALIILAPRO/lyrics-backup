		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a love letter
It's some things that I do but I won't say I do
You should get to know me better
But it's way too many things that I put you through
She left her heels at my house, she thinks she's Cinderella
She braid my hair, rub my back and roll my cigarillo
And she don't know about that pain so I can never fail her
I let that Codeine, sit in rain until I hit that pillow

Lord, Jesus, I got a new thesis
To go and get that bag and stay back all season
I asked men like the red-eyed demon
I'm gettin' too amazed, know the hell, I'm speedin'
I missed your call like, "What you doin' this evenin'?"
No lease or get back to blood and I'm bleedin'
I guess your learned for those times I gave you lessons
I'ma keep you in my life and I'ma treat you like a blessing

It's a love letter
It's some things that I do but I won't say I do
You should get to know me better
But it's way too many things that I put you through
She left her heels at my house, she thinks she's Cinderella
She braid my hair, rub my back and roll my cigarillo
And she don't know about that pain so I can never fail her
I let that Codeine, sit in rain until I hit that pillow

Lord, Jesus, I got a new thesis
To go and get that bag and stay back all season
I asked men like the red-eyed demon
I'm gettin' too amazed, know the hell, I'm speedin'
I missed your call like, "What you doin' this evenin'?"
No lease or get back to blood and I'm bleedin'
I guess your learned for those times I gave you lessons
I'ma keep you in my life and I'ma treat you like a blessing

Poppin' XO, shawty get her roll on
I wanna take your panties off and get in your zone
I went and got in deep but I had all my clothes on
Shawty gettin' low, oh-oh, oh-woah, girl, hold on
It's four ounces to the head tonight (It's four ounces to the head)
It don't be no secrets in my bed tonight (It don't be no secrets in my bed)
'Cause you the one that I been askin' for
Don't be afraid to ask me for somethin'

It's a love letter
It's some things that I do but I won't say I do
You should get to know me better
But it's way too many things that I put you through
She left her heels at my house, she thinks she's Cinderella
She braid my hair, rub my back and roll my cigarillo
And she don't know about that pain so I can never fail her
I let that Codeine, sit in rain until I hit that pillow

Why you tryna send me pictures?
Got me feelin', feelin' all twisted
Baby, let's take it home
Baby, let's go the distance
Do you in the master bed 
I want your whole affection
I want satisfaction
You and me come with traction
