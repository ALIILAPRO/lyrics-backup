		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayo 
You don't have to love me 
You don't even have to like me 
But you will respect me
You know why? 'Cause I'm a boss

Uh, uh, uh (watch the beat go)
Uh, uh, watch that thing go (watch the beat go, Bangladesh)
Uh, uh, uh (watch the beat go)
Uh, uh, watch that thing go

I'm bossy
I'm the first girl to scream on a track
I switched up the beat of the drum
That's right, I brought all the boys to the yard
And that's right, I'm the one that's tattooed on his arm
I'm bossy
I'm the bitch y'all love to hate
I'm the chick that's raisin' stakes
I told Young Stunna he should switch to BAPEs
I'm back with an 808, 'cause I'm bossy

Ooh, let me slow it down so you can catch the flow (catch the flow)
Screw it up, make it go extra slow (extra slow)
Real girls get down on the flo' (on the flo', get down on the flo')
Ooh, if I gave you a taste, you want some more
Touch down on me, throw it up like a pro
I ride the beat like a bicycle, I'm icy cold
Ooh, from the 6-4 hoppers up in Crenshaw
The money makin' players up in Harlem
Don't want no problems
We gon' keep it pumpin' while the 808 is jumpin'

Diamonds on my neck, di-diamonds on my grill
Diamonds on my neck, di-diamonds on my grill

I'm bossy
I'm the first girl to scream on a track
I switched up the beat of the drum
That's right, I brought all the boys to the yard
And that's right, I'm the one that's tattooed on his arm
I'm bossy
I'm the bitch y'all love to hate
I'm the chick that's raisin' stakes
I told Young Stunna he should switch to BAPEs
I'm back with an 808, 'cause I'm bossy

Ooh (I bet, I bet, I bet) 
I bet you never heard it like this before (this before)
My baby be closin' them Phantom doors (Phantom doors)
At the bar poppin' ish that you can't afford (can't afford)
Ooh, I'm drinkin', lost in the clouds, it's all smokin'
All the while I'm all open
Me and my girls, we stay fly and I love to stay high
Ooh, from the 6-4 hoppers up in Crenshaw
To the money makin' playas up in Harlem
Don't want no problems
We gon' keep it pumpin' while the 808 is jumpin'

Diamonds on my neck, di-diamonds on my grill
Diamonds on my neck, di-diamonds on my grill

I'm bossy
I'm the first girl to scream on a track
I switched up the beat of the drum
That's right, I brought all the boys to the yard
And that's right, I'm the one that's tattooed on his arm
I'm bossy
I'm the bitch y'all love to hate
I'm the chick that's raisin' stakes
I told Young Stunna he should switch to BAPEs
I'm back with an 808, 'cause I'm bossy

It's 'bout time that she get with me
Can't stop starin', she's fine and she's pretty
Damn girl, don't hurt 'em
If niggas don't bag back, you gon' work 'em
Put your mack down, I know your background
What you want, girl? You gettin' that now
That's how you do it, huh? Well, I'm the coolest one
Them bad bitches in the back, bring 'em to the front
Bitch, tell that man you's a boss bitch
Make some noise, raise your hand if you's a boss bitch
I don't think he understand you's a boss bitch
Get some help if you can 'cause he lost it
Ain't no refunds, she spent the cash, mane
In your Benz with her friends in the fast lane
Flossin', you said, "How much it cost me?"
About a million dollars player, she's bossy

I'm bossy
I'm the first girl to scream on a track
I switched up the beat of the drum
That's right, I brought all the boys to the yard
And that's right, I'm the one that's tattooed on his arm
I'm bossy
I'm the bitch y'all love to hate
I'm the chick that's raisin' stakes
I told Young Stunna he should switch to BAPEs
I'm back with an 808, 'cause I'm bossy

Uh, uh, uh (watch the beat go)
Uh, uh, watch that thing go (watch the beat go)
Uh, uh, uh (watch the beat go)
Uh, uh, watch that thing go (watch the beat go)
Uh, uh, uh (watch the beat go)
Uh, uh, watch that thing go (watch the beat go)
Uh, uh, uh (watch the beat go)
Uh, uh, watch that thing go (watch the beat go)
Uh, uh
