		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thank you mom, I still love you
Your memories in a plastic case
That's stays deep inside
my heart
But I've never seen his face
I wish you could rest in peace
so long
You left me alone in this world
Say good bye
Stop crying now
We are a part of war
in this deep world so
Say good bye
Now I must go
How can we stop war?
I can't see any more
in this sad place

Thank you mom I want to hug you
If you were still by my side so
That stays deep in side of
my heart
But I've never seen your smile
I wish for them....
they could rest in peace
That you gave me life
in this world
Say good bye
Stop crying now
We are a part of war
in this deep world so
Say good bye
Now I must go
How can we stop war?
I can't see any more
in this sad place

Say good bye
Don't fear hell
We are a part of war
in this deep world so
Say good bye
Now I have to go
How can it be?
I can't speak no more
Say good bye
Stop crying now
We are a part of war
in this deep world so
Say good bye
Now I must go
How can we stop war?
I can't see any more
in thisã€€sad place
