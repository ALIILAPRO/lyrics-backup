		  (Great John on the beat by the way)

For no back whens, look
Miss me once I'm gone, ain't for no back whens, nah, nah
Uh, uh, in my feelings

Know they gon' miss me when I'm gone, ain't for no back-whens, look
(They gon' lie, they gon' lie)
Miss me once I'm gone, they put on accident, huh, look
(They gon' lie, they gon' lie)
Feeling supoosed to numb, but I'm still feelin' (mm)
I hope all my dawgs, go out, go drillin' if they kill me, nigga
(That's shooter gang-gang-gang-gang)

Look, look, I don't really want nobody near me
Look, look, really thinkin' that nobody hears me
Look, look, never feelin' that I'm not aware
Of little effort like I'm not prepared
Got dreams that dyin', it does not aware me
But it's rainin' on me, look
Why they still hatin' on me? Look
Demons be callin' my name important, huh
Like they waitin' on me (hit you)
I'll make your name important (huh)
Nigga, I'll make your name important
'Cause I'll really, really, really fuck around, knock your head off
Hit blocks, on blocks, then sped off
No roadblock, your block get shut off
Act tough and I'm movin' you up
Hands down, I ain't stickin' you up
Skrrt off the scene, all you see is the dust
Could be grimy, you stink like a musk, no nigga

Know they gon' miss me when I'm gone, ain't for no back-whens, look
(They gon' lie, they gon' lie)
Miss me once I'm gone, they put on accident, huh, look
(They gon' lie, they gon' lie)
Feeling supoosed to numb, but I'm still feelin' (mm)
I hope all my dawgs, go out, go drillin' if they kill me, nigga
(That's shooter gang-gang-gang-gang)

Huh, gang, gang (gang, gang)
Scream out, "Gang, gang" (gang, gang)
If they kill me, know my guns rain (with the boom-boom-boon)
Know my, huh, know my name too official
Life or death, I'm still with you
Disrespect, you know somebody got hurt
Hop out, blaster, hit him again, nigga
They say I'm promotin' the violence
I guess it is what it is, nigga
They say I've been movin' too solid
I'm whisperin' to my dead friends
But they in my pocket
I ain't nice, I'm violent (gang)
Huh, I ain't tryna keep a clean nose
Ignorant wherever we go
Glocks on me, we really keep those, I need those
Huh, did a lot, I never spoke on nothin'
Never spoke or nothin', did a lot, I never spoke on nothin
(Yeah, yeah)

Know they gon' miss me when I'm gone, ain't for no back-whens, look
(They gon' lie, they gon' lie)
Miss me once I'm gone, they put on accident, huh, look
(They gon' lie, they gon' lie)
Feeling supoosed to numb, but I'm still feelin' (mm)
I hope all my dawgs, go out, go drillin' if they kill me, nigga
(That's shooter gang-gang-gang-gang)
