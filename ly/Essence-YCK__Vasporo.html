		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Industries are dying change is coming your replacement
Is a robot that's been coded and set up for automation
Everybody's out here doing it but careful when you come aboard
Chips inserted can't be pried up taken from the motherboard
AI brought up to speed we taught a rock to think
Stage fright now it's defunct then watch the carbon sink
Been installed up in the molecules and having struggles breathing
So we wipe away the cause observing how the puddle deepens
Coastal attack hurricanes come
And if I was in charge I was certain they'd done
Anything to get me out of that position governing
The LZ's hot and the engine in it's sputtering
Aircraft's fragile the Tower of Babel
Transported to the tree watching the apple
Aura seductive my core I'm destructive
You don't see half of what it is that I'm stuck with

Inhale the particles
Exhale how far it goes
Voice is gone my drunken rambles
And how I've aged and come to gamble
Behind my eyes inside my skull
Between my ears the sound is dulled
Will you keep the spirits high
And hold the essence here alive
Below my skin beneath the pores
Before I search for something more
Will I have my answer then
To throw my goals and shatter them

Market's free innovation we're not like the other guys
Money doesn't mean a thing the government had subsidized
Fuel and water fool the spotter AA aimed at atmosphere
Then spread the documents and circulate the blueprints dragged in here
Preach read revelations the apocalypse is nigh
Maybe new beginnings and the teachings are objectified
Circuitry wrong and deservedly brought
Us a wrath we can't imagine
Certainly not just a curse that we got
It's one we can't examine
Thunder's bringing waves of heat and
What food we're eating hormonal treatments
Artificial cybernetic find it I exist
And we're dimming and we're waning that don't take a scientist
Unplugged pulled from the grid and the framework
Crazed and distraught bring the act to the state first
Many been unworthy there ain't many designated
Pick an alternate decision when it's all premeditated

Inhale the particles
Exhale how far it goes
Voice is gone my drunken rambles
And how I've aged and come to gamble
Behind my eyes inside my skull
Between my ears the sound is dulled
Will you keep the spirits high
And hold the essence here alive
Below my skin beneath the pores
Before I search for something more
Will I have my answer then
To throw my goals and shatter them
