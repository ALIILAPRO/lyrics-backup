		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I) I am the one
(The one) Who lost control
(Control) But in the end I'd be the
Last Man Standing

(I) I am the one
(The one) Who sold his soul
(His soul) Forever gone to be the
Last Man Standing

Glorious
Noble in my mind
Everything a fight to win
Taking all and giving
Whatever my pride would let me
Not backing down, not giving in
I wouldn't lose, I couldn't

(I) I am the one
(The one) Who lost control
(Control) But in the end I'd be the
Last Man Standing

(I) I am the one
(The one) Who sold his soul
(His soul) Forever gone to be the
Last Man Standing

I walk alone
With my head held high
Never felt that I belonged
Stand my ground at all costs
Running through life with blindfolds
Just for the right - right to be wrong

Nothing would rule my world but-

(I) I am the one
(The one) Who lost control
(Control) But in the end I'd be the
Last Man Standing

(I) I am the one
(The one) Who sold his soul
(His soul) Forever gone to be the
Last Man Standing

Nothing would rule my world but-

(I) I am the one
(The one) Who lost control
(Control) But in the end I'd be the
Last Man Standing

(I) I am the one
(The one) Who sold his soul
(His soul) Forever gone to be the
Last Man Standing

(I) I am the one
(The one) Who lost control
(Control) But in the end I'd be the
Last Man Standing

(I) I am the one
(The one) Who sold his soul
(His soul) Forever gone to be the
Last Man Standing

Seeing clearer what I've done
I'd refuse to let things go
I could never once admit I'm wrong
And what do I have to show?

Seeing clearer what's at stake
And the things I have to change
I just hope I can, it's not too late
To get a chance to end this pain
