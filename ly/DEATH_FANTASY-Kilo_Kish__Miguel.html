		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have a death fantasy
Death of my aesthetics
This false, a fiction
Carved in my way

Death of my image
Of my intellect
My all is okay

Death of my prettying, my cozying
My craft and my grace
Cannot keep rushing the gate

The death fantasy, rejected spaces
In your frameworks
They do not go to me

To fit inside your empty visions
Livid bird in a cage

Death of my hustle, my trajectory
My style and my lane
That flagrant look on your face

I have the death fantasy
Yeah, yeah
Ha-ha-la-la-lujah I'm free

Yeah, yeah, yeah
A charming death fantasy
Ha-ha-la-la-lujah I'm free
Now keep your hands off of me

What's to be said of your stage?
Have changed the title
But have yet to write
A single new page (page)

Privilege is cheap
If you can't be free
So I said
Seems like it only repeats
I have the death fantasy
