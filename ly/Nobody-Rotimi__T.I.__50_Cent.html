		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You just be fucking for free
You just be fucking to fuck
You might end up in the sheets
But you never end up in love

She like to twerk and sweep it up (sweep it up)
Your honey's just a bunch of ones (yeah)
She quick to take her panties off (splat)
You rich, you might be on to sum
She be non stop lookin' for a baller
Wanna kinda spend this money on her (whoo)
Tryna fuck a million to a Porsche
Girls it's a shame, girl it's a shame

How you got all these bodies
Still ain't got nobody
How you got all these bodies
Still ain't got nobody
How you got all these bodies
Still ain't got nobody
You out here livin' like a thottie
That's why you ain't got nobody, nobody no

You just be fucking for free
You just be fucking to fuck
You might end up in the sheets
But you never end up in love

That's why you got all these bodies
Still ain't got nobody
How you got all these bodies
Still ain't got nobody
Nobody, yeah

Hard nigga, you call a fan
Screw currency, will blur all your principles
Suck a dick for some, fuck a bitch for some
All this money here shawty go on get you some
I tell 'em fuck 'em, if you fuck make 'em pay for it
Have you ride through Atlanta in a Wraith for it
You ain't even have to trick to get a blow job
And still all in a hurry wanna taste shawty
Okay, she ridin' the dick like a skateboard
Now Mr Pussy-mo nigga have to pay for it
Remember ridin' 85 in a hotbox
With some dick all in her face like botox
Okay I skeet on her buttock
Convertible, what-not
See me doin' donuts, in front of the bus stop
You try to get cussed out or worse get bust on
See why she don't claim you as the dick she fucked on

How you got all these bodies
Still ain't got nobody
How you got all these bodies
Still ain't got nobody
How you got all these bodies
Still ain't got nobody
You out here livin' like a thottie
That's why you ain't got nobody, nobody no

You just be fucking for free
You just be fucking to fuck
You might end up in the sheets
But you never end up in love

That's why you got all these bodies
Still ain't got nobody
How you got all these bodies
Still ain't got nobody
Nobody, yeah

Look what you done
How you can look so exotic and still be alone
Nigga just hit it and leave
It ain't no different wit' me
No, it ain't no feelin's wit' me
But she gon' still let me beat
She gon' do that anyway

First she only fuckin' wit' ya if ya got a check, then she wanna be broke up
So every single time she get to talkin' 'bout relationships, that's when I doze off
You been out here runnin' game for so long
So girl it's a shame, girl it's a shame

How you got all these bodies
Still ain't got nobody
How you got all these bodies
Still ain't got nobody
How you got all these bodies
Still ain't got nobody
You out here livin' like a thottie
That's why you ain't got nobody, nobody no

You just be fucking for free
You just be fucking to fuck
You might end up in the sheets
But you never end up in love

That's why you got all these bodies
Still ain't got nobody
How you got all these bodies
Still ain't got nobody
Nobody, yeah

Baby why you always trippin'
Why you say you niggas trippin'
Real niggas only be tippin'
Real niggas only be tippin'

Baby why you always trippin'
Why you say you niggas trippin'
Real niggas only be tippin'
Real niggas only be tippin'

Baby why you always trippin'
Why you say you niggas trippin'
Real niggas only be tippin'
Real niggas only be tippin'

Baby why you always trippin'
Why you say you niggas trippin'
Real niggas only be tippin'
Real niggas only be tippin'
