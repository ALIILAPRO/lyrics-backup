		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Call my mom
She said darling just hold on
You will mend you heart
And you'll be where you belong
And it'll take some time
But your heart will realign
Cause sometimes love isn't black and white
And that's alright
And I'm going off the deep
Cause my tears they're drownin' me
Send a boat come and rescue me
Mama please
Cause no I'm not alright
My heart hurts a little
Can someone bring me to life
She said son you'll see
Outside the lines what's meant to be
Take the seeds and plant a tree
Darling please
I said mom I'm afraid
What's on the other side of this pain
Does the sunshine come after the rain
Or does it stay
Cause no I'm not alright
My heart hurts a little
Can someone bring me to life
I know that lovin' can hurt
But sometimes you'll find
That in the end it'll work out
It'll be alright
When life knocks you down
You just get up and try
Until then
Oh until then
I'll call my mom
She'll say
Darling just be strong
Don't you worry
You'll be right where you belong
