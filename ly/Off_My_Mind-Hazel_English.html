		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got me so afraid
To tell you how I really feel but
I'm caught in a moment in-between
I keep it all at bay
But underneath I'm hesitating
Caught in a moment in-between
I'm caught in a distant dream

If I wait
Another day
Will I waste, waste away?
I can't get you off my mind

Take away my thoughts, they hold me back
Time to make a move to take a step
I don't wanna watch my life just pass me by
I can't get you off my mind

The way you're treating me
I know that it's not okay but
I'm caught in a moment in-between
And every time we talk
I just don't know what to say 'cause
I'm caught in a moment in-between
I'm caught in a distant dream

If I wait
Another day
Will I waste, waste away?
I can't get you off my mind

Take away my thoughts, they hold me back
Time to make a move to take a step
I don't wanna watch my life just pass me by
Drift in and out of consciousness
Gotta find a way out of this mess
I don't wanna let my life just pass me by

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
I can't get you off my mind

Take away my thoughts, they hold me back
Time to make a move to take a step
I don't wanna watch my life just pass me by
Drift in and out of consciousness
Gotta find a way out of this mess
I don't wanna let my life just pass me by
I can't get you off my mind
