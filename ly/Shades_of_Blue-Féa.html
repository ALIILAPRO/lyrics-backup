		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wake up in the night, And I don't feel you. Have you lost your mind In those shades of blue? You've drown your love In the ocean's waves, And you still hope that
I will miss you back.
Another love,
Another lie to me,
Another fight with yourself, Another sleepless night, Another broken heart, Ooo baby, ooo baby. Another love,
Another lie to me,
Another fight with yourself, Another sleepless night, Another broken heart, Ooo baby, ooo baby.
Lalalala, lalalalalala, lalalala, lalalalalalala, lalalalalalala, ooo.
I wonder if I was
The reason for your loss. We can't turn back the time. The clock is stuck for us.
I lost all my trust.
Take your pack of lies.
Our days are gone.
Another love,
Another lie to me,
Another fight with yourself, Another sleepless night, Another broken heart, Ooo baby, ooo baby. Another love,
Another lie to me,
Another fight with yourself, Another sleepless night, Another broken heart, Ooo baby, ooo baby.
Lalalala, lalalalalala, lalalala, lalalalalalala, lalalalalalala, ooo.
Oh, baby, I'm moving on.
No more tears, no more pain. Ooo baby, ooo.
Another love,
Another lie to me,
Another fight with yourself, Another sleepless night, Another broken heart, Ooo baby, ooo baby.
Lalalala, lalalalalala, lalalala, lalalalalalala, lalalalalalala, ooo.
