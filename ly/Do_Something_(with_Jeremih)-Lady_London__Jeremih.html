		  (Hitmaka)

I might do somethin' to you (hol' up)
I might do somethin' to you
I might do somethin' to you
Oh baby, oh
I might do somethin' to you
I might do somethin' to you
I might do somethin' to you
Oh baby, oh

I like the finer things in life, designer and the flights
I got Gabbana on an island with a bottle in the ice (woo)
I swear to God it's been a night, my heart and mind is in a fight
But if the cards could get aligned, I wouldn't mind to be your wife
I gotta advise so that it's not a surprise
I know you like me 'cause you swipe up and send me the eyes
You probably a nice dude but tryna entice who?
With flowers that never die and some overpriced fruit? Ha (Edible Arrangements)
I think you cappin', I need action (I need action)
Look, fuck all the yappin', I need passion (I need passion)
You really don't get it or understand?
Keep sayin' you'll spend a band
Okay pa', and?
What, what you gon' do? How you gon' move?
You say you that dude but now you mute
Send me some loot, you hit the Zelle?
I might climb the top of Clase Azul 'til I hit the bell

I might do somethin' to you
I might do somethin' to you
I might do somethin' to you
Oh baby, oh
I might do somethin' to you
I might do somethin' to you
I might do somethin' to you
Oh baby, oh

Look
I might do somethin' to you too, it's hardly been the same
And since we've been together it's the calm within the rain
I know my sign is water so a solid and a steam
I could give you ice cold or be the smoke within the flame
I'm a Cancer (Cancer)
So romantic is my standard (my standard)
But there ain't a Cancer that's not damaged (not damaged)
I need passion to keep me from backtrackin'
My ex's got a bad habit of knowin' my sex patterns
Come and do it to me
Prove it, show it, I wanna believe it
Make a movie for me (make a movie)
On your story, so I can see it
I like privacy on both ends
Emoji over your face, in close friends
I'm more private than a G5, I'm private as a lear (lear)
Private as an island where the population's zero
I'm silent, I like shopping, I like vibin' when I chill
Niggas link me and they get to postin' comments on my reels

I might let (oh, boy) (let)
You think of me (boy, you so loud) (me)
In the late night (night)
Leave you tongue tied (tied)
Energized (what?)
In a room (hello?)
Yeah, got me hypnotized
Oh baby, oh

I might do somethin' to you
I might do somethin' to you
I might do somethin' to you
Oh baby, oh
I might do somethin' to you
I might do somethin' to you
I might do somethin' to you
Oh baby, oh

I might let
