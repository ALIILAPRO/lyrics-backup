		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe he's right
Maybe I'm wrong
Maybe what I'm saying is the way it should be
Nobody knows when the truth goes by
But everyone tells me that he's happy

Maybe he's gone and found some love
I want to see it for myself
Everyone says just to let him alone
But I can't even sleep no more it worries me so

Why
Why

Maybe I'm right
Maybe he's wrong
And maybe what he's saying is the way it should be
Somebody tried to explain it to me
But they couldn't tell me if he's happy
And I just want to know if he's still happy
