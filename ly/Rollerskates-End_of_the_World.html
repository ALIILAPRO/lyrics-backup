		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, the night's got a hold of me
A cold sweat running down my cheeks

I know that you're still awake
From the text saying "Go and grab your skates"

Maybe we all need to feel a little lonely
To get a grasp on what we really need
Without the feeling that we may be alone
Just how could we understand this love?

Roller skating the night away
We don't need the light of day
'Cause I've got the starlight and you

Close my eyes I can't fall asleep
The night we had was it all a dream?
Factories at the edge of town
You took me to that quiet place you found

Maybe we all need to feel a little lonely
To get a grasp on what we really need
Without the feeling that we may be alone
Just how could we understand this love?

Roller skating the night away
We don't need the light of day
'Cause I've got the starlight and you

We hit the road, the loud echoes
We didn't see the flashing lights as they approach
So we hide as the sirens ring
All the while I'm looking at your smile

Could we understand this love?

Roller skating the night away
We don't need the light of day
'Cause I've got the starlight and you
