		<p>
		  Guwop! Wiz!
Taylor Gang, 1-0-1-7

Ridin' around, blowin' so much dope
But I'm always handlin' business
Way too high don't pick up my phone
If I do, I'm like, "Who is this?"
I ain't got time for a girlfriend
Tell that bitch I ain't got no feelings
Young nigga straight from the bottom
Now my car ain't got no ceilings
Young nigga stackin up millions
Y'all niggas actin' like children
Ouu, nigga used to can't get in, 
now I'm ownin' the building
Brought the bitch to my crib, 
said she felt like she went on a field trip
Nigga like me gon' always stack, when I'm older I'ma probably gon' still get

Baby I'm a rich ass nigga, never said I was gon' be easy to deal with it (me too)
But I be on some real shit, but I be on some real shit
Baby I'm a rich ass nigga, never said I was gon' be easy to deal with it
But I be on some real shit, but I be on some real shit

I'm a country ass Beverly hill-billy
Eat it up bitch, I'm a meal ticket
Flush it down concert like fuck a ticket
Rich ass, crazy ass, super picky
Want a rich dick say I'm bucket listed
I don't fuck broke I got a boujee dick
First round draft, I'm a lottery pick
Pepped up East Atlanta vitamins shit
Solites glarin,' big stone like Sharon
Superstar, Ed Sheeran, bitches love my earrings
Know she fucked wit 'em, I still fucked her, fuck that nigga, he a real sucka
It's the Wiz and the Wizop, I baguetted my watch wit' real boogers

Baby I'm a rich ass nigga, never said I was gon' be easy to deal with it
But I be on some real shit, but I be on some real shit (me too)
Baby I'm a rich ass nigga, never said I was gon' be easy to deal with it
But I be on some real shit, but I be on some real shit
