		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sitting, waiting in the falling rain
Getting ready to begin again
Wounded, lying, crying bodies moving, dying
All around there is the smell of death and fire
Here the planes are coming
Hear the soldiers running
Killing on a scale to comprehend

Why are we here? 
In this place, here to kill
Please God, forgive us for what we have done

I always thought I was doing right
As of now, I'm not feeling so sure
I'm at a place of where I give no grace
I'm a soldier of war

I sit waiting for my darkest hour to come
I cannot think of about the things that I have done
It shouldn't take a fool to see that I believe
Accept the consequence, repent for what I've done

You tell me what is certain but I'll tell you what is true
You tell me what is honesty when all around is death and cruelty
I'm making out, my mind is vile, I'm giving in to our desires
Within the truth that lies within the only thing

Mother of mercy, angel of death desire
Mother of mercy taking my last breath of fire
Mother of mercy, angel of pain
Mother of mercy taking my last breath

Some say you are a lost cause, some say you're a saint
Just being here's and act of suffering and restraint
Walked down a long dark road to ruin and panic not
I'll die a lonely death, of that I'm certain of

Rivers flow with blood, there's nowhere left to hide
It's hard to comprehend there's anyone left alive
Sick of all the killing and the reek of death
Will God tell me what religion is to man?

I don't hold with bad religion, understand what's underneath it
Now I come to think of it, I just don't hold at all, you know it
You say you are a holy man but what is it you do?
From where I stand there's nothing but a hollow man I see

Mother of mercy, angel of death desire
Mother of mercy taking my last breath of fire
Mother of mercy, angel of pain
Mother of mercy taking my last breath

Mother of mercy, angel of death desire
Mother of mercy taking my last breath of fire
Mother of mercy, angel of pain
Mother of mercy drawing my last breath

I'm just a lonely soldier fighting in a bloody hopeless war
Don't know what I'm fighting, who it is, or what I'm fighting for
Thought it was for money, made my fortune, now I'm not so sure
Seemed to just have lost my way
