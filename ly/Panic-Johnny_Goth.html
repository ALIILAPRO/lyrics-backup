		<p>
		  Get me out of here, get me away

We're all for the panic we're all for the shame
I'm back from the depths of the bed I laid 
I'd do anything to get you into my arms and the scars reming me
It's true I just wanna show you, baby I've been gone for a while
But I don't think that I should die alone
But it don't seem to bad now that I know
The whole world dies alone
And all I wanna do is be with you but I feel I can't touch anything without
Burning up in flames, I'll learn to love the pain
But I know this is what I need and I'd do anything for you
Cuz my love runs deep like the bloody seas i know
It's your soul to keep but in this valley they'll eat you whole

We're all for the panic we're all for the pain
I'm back from the depths of the bed I laid
I'd do anything to get you into my arms and the scars remind me
We're all tryina get it we're all in the haze 
I'll burn all of the bodies and feel no shame
Get me out of here, get me away
