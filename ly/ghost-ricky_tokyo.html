		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eyes real tired from the blue light
Gotta go walk get my mind right
Cross the street I ain't look twice
Ain't coming back til the sunrise
Felt a vibration from my phone
Mama text me "where did you go"
I text back "just wait, coming home"
You know me I'm bouta go ghost
Chief on the joint then I float
Fuck around with me I'm the goat
Try not to brag but I'll gloat
Glitter nail polish on my toes
I'm gon step on a bitch like a roach
You thought you had a chance
Lil bitch hell no
You ain't shit but a bug to a toad
You know me I'm bouta go
Ghost
Imma go ghost
Imma go ghost
Imma go ghost
Never talking to a soul
Never talking to a soul
Imma go ghost
Imma go ghost
Never talking to a soul
Pillow on top of me for artificial body heat
I took it for granted, the warmth that you provided me
You're electricity that powered up my circuitry
Made up of angelic chords that create perfect harmony
You gave me the power I needed, my conduit
I'll try to be happy again, put my mind to it
Psychedelic on the tongue keeps my mind lucid
Keeps my mind rooted and stops me from goin ghost
I couldn't see myself grow old without you
You're the rainbow baby
I'm just blue
No I didn't expect you to leave soon
Please come back again and ring the bell too
You're my home
My safe place
Tell me when you're ready
I'll be there the same day
I'll be there the same day
Until then, I have to go
Ghost
Imma go ghost
Imma go ghost
Imma go ghost
Never talking to a soul
Never talking to a
soul
Imma go ghost
Imma go ghost
Never talking to a soul
Never talking to a soul
Imma go ghost
Imma go ghost
