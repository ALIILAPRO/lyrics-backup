		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No greater mood,
Than when I can't move at all,
When tied by you,
Your servitude sets me free

Dressed in Blue baby you make me sweater than,
Your hand is still on my back,
Dressed in Blue baby you give me more than I,
I've never known love like that

No one knows how it goes but I know when you,
Come around I've got to give in
When it gloes and it flows and your fire breaks through,
My every moan is for you

I know its crazy, but it feels so right
When I surrender my love,
You leave me longing for another night,
All my desire is for you

What can I do?, I'll leave it all up to you,
And it's so coool, make me obay every rule

Dressed in Blue baby you make me sweater than,
Your hand is still on my back,
Dressed in Blue baby you give me more than I,
I've never known love like that

No one knows how it goes but I know when you,
Come around I've got to give in
When it gloes and it flows and your fire breaks through,
My every moan is for you

I know its crazy, but it feels so right
When I surrender my love,
You leave me longing for another night,
All my desire is for you

Infernal Dressed in Blue [x8]

La la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la [x2]

Dressed in Blue baby you make me sweater than,
Your hand is still on my back,
When we're through baby you give me more than I,
I've never known love like that

And no one knows how it goes but I know when you,
Come around I have got to give in
When it flows and your fire breaks through,
My every moan is for you
