		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'ma tell you to your face, boy
Your mom a cougar
Shawty serve me up, now I feel like I'm at Hooters (baby)
I scoop then I dip, I be movin' like an Uber
Fresh out the clink cookin' up, Martha Stewart

Martha Stewart (ayy), Martha Stewart (ayy)
Make maneuvers (yeah), think I'm Martha Stewart (woah)
Martha Stewart (ayy), with some cougars (baby)
Gravy with your mama in the kitchen, Martha Stewart 
It's Martha Stewart (Martha Stewart), I had to do her (Martha Stewart)
I keep a cougar (Martha Stewart)
I think I'm Martha Stewart (it's Martha Stewart)
Martha Stewart, I keep a cougar (Martha Stewart)
Gravy with your mama in the kitchen, Martha Stewart

Ayy, slim thick ho, that's my honey (yeah, yeah)
Get the bread, get the stacks, get the money
Shawty got the ass goin' dummy (yeah, yeah)
Get the bread, get the stacks, get the money
Ayy, I'ma write a book, how to cook, like I'm Martha
I just got the mink, all pink on the parka
Copped the plain jane and I turned it to a sparkler
Took yo main thang, ghost ride and I parked her
Yuh, ayy, ooh, gravy on me makin' hymns
Thirty-thousand on my limbs
Treat you like a pair of Timbs, you get scuffed (woah)
Get that coochie on a whim
Give that girl the stuff, like I'm Shaq jumpin' out the gym
Ooh, ayy, I fucked my tutor, yeah, I'm flexed up
Sit behind your bitch on her scooter
I don't hit no groupies, baby, only fuck with cougars
I'm a blond ho, self-made, call me Martha Stewart

Martha Stewart (ayy), Martha Stewart (ayy)
Make maneuvers (yeah), think I'm Martha Stewart (woah)
Martha Stewart (ayy), with some cougars (baby)
Gravy with your mama in the kitchen, Martha Stewart 
It's Martha Stewart (Martha Stewart), I had to do her (Martha Stewart)
I keep a cougar (Martha Stewart)
I think I'm Martha Stewart (it's Martha Stewart)
Martha Stewart, I keep a cougar (Martha Stewart)
Ayy, Gravy with your mama in the kitchen, Martha Stewart

I'm like Martha Stewart (ooh), you like Stuart Little (ayy)
Gravy gon' serenade your sister on the fiddle (pussy)
Look down at my wrist, it's a high chance of drizzle (pussy)
Your whole gang hooked like the motherfuckin' Wiggles (pussy)
I'll be iced out, you can call me Kris Kringle (ho)
Can't nobody reach me, I'm the bottom of the Pringles
Olive Garden hit me up to make they ass a jingle
'Til I found out the president of marketing was single
(And I fucked)

Ayy, ayy (yo mom a cougar), ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy (feel like I'm at Hooters), ayy, ayy (baby)
Ayy, ayy (movin' like an Uber)
Ayy (fresh out the clink cookin' up, Martha Stewart), ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy 

Martha Stewart (ayy), Martha Stewart (ayy)
Make maneuvers (yeah), think I'm Martha Stewart (woah)
Martha Stewart (ayy), with some cougars (baby)
Gravy with your mama in the kitchen, Martha Stewart 
It's Martha Stewart (Martha Stewart), I had to do her (Martha Stewart)
I keep a cougar (Martha Stewart)
I think I'm Martha Stewart (it's Martha Stewart)
Martha Stewart, I keep a cougar (Martha Stewart)
Gravy with your mama in the kitchen, Martha Stewart, ayy 

It's Martha Stewart (Martha Stewart), I had to do her (Martha Stewart)
I keep a cougar (Martha Stewart), ayy
I think I'm Martha Stewart (it's Martha Stewart)
Martha Stewart, I keep a cougar (Martha Stewart), ayy
Gravy with your mama in the kitchen, Martha Stewart, ayy
