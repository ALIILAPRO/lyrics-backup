		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh yeah
If I could go back
Just for a night
I would see the future
And I'd make it alright
Oh darling if life was a movie
I'd hit rewind
Imagine if I knew how to turn back time

Imagine if I never messed up
Imagine if we never even broke up
Imagine if I had the power to control the voices in my head
And I could tell them all to shut the fuck up

Imagine if I never told a lie
Imagine if I knew how to always get it right
Imagine if I wasn't such a coward
And I had the courage hidden somewhere in my heart 
To look you in the eye, yeah, yeah

If I could go back (go back)
Just for a night (yeah)
I would see the future
And I'd make it alright
Oh darling if life was a movie
I'd hit rewind (yeah)
Imagine if I knew how to turn back time
I was thinkin' like

Aye-oh aye-oh aye okay
Lost our love in the mess we made
Aye-oh aye-oh aye okay
If tomorrow was yesterday

I wonder if I saw your face again
Would you be a stranger or would we be more than friends?
Would this be the beginning
Or the long and winding road that takes us all 
The way around until the very bitter end?

Imagine if we never felt fear
Imagine we were brave enough to never hide the tears
Imagine if I didn't have to worry about everything around me
And my sanity was actually here (yeah)

I just got so caught up in the moment
Didn't even realize we were broken

If I could go back
Just for a night
I would see the future
And I'd make it alright
Oh darling if life was a movie
I'd hit rewind, yeah
Imagine if I knew how to turn back time
I was thinkin' like

Aye-oh aye-oh aye okay
Lost our love in the mess we made
Aye-oh aye-oh aye okay
If tomorrow was yesterday

I was thinkin' like

Aye-oh aye-oh aye okay
Lost our love in the mess we made
Aye-oh aye-oh aye okay

Imagine what the world be like
If everybody stayed in love
If everybody stayed offline
Imagine what the world be like
Imagine what the world be like

Yeah

Imagine what the world be like
If everybody stayed in love
If everybody stayed offline
Imagine what the world be like
Imagine what the world be like

But until then

If I could go back
Just for a night
I would see the future
And I'd make it alright
Oh darling if life was a movie
I'd hit rewind
Imagine if I knew how to turn back time
