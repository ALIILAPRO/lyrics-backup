		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The beauty spot was borrowed and 
Now my sweet knife rusts tomorrow. 
I'm a confession that is waiting to be heard. 
Burn your empty rain down on me 
Whisper your death beat so softly 
We bend our knees 
At the altar of my ego 
You drained my heart 
And made a spade 
But there's still traces of me 
in your veins 
You drained my heart 
And made a spade 
But there's still traces of me 
in your veins 
All my lilies' mouths are open 
Like they're begging for dope 
And hoping 
Their bitter petal chant, 
"We can kick , you won't be back." 
I'm a diamond that is tired 
Of all the faces I've acquired 
We must secure the shadow 
Ere the substance fades 
You drained my heart 
And made a spade 
But there's still traces of me 
in your veins 
You drained my heart 
And made a spade 
But there's still traces of me 
in your veins 
And we said 'til we die 
And we said 'til we die
