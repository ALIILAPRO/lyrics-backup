		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You and me were always with each other
Before we knew the others was ever there
You and me we belong together
Just like a breath needs the air
I told you if you called I would come runnin'
Across the highs the lows and the in between
You and me we've got two minds that think as one
And our hearts march to the same beat
They say everything it happens for a reason
You can be flawed enough but perfect for a person
Someone who will be there for you when you fall apart
Guiding your direction when you're riding through the dark,
Oh that's you and me

You and me we're searching' for the same light
Desperate for a cure to this disease
Well some days are better than others,
But I fear no thing as long as you're with me
They say everything' it happens for a reason
You can be flawed enough but perfect for a person
Someone who will be there for you when you fall apart
Guiding your direction when you're riding through the dark

And they say, everything it happens for a reason
You can be flawed enough but perfect for a person
Someone who will be there for you when you start to fall apart,
Guiding your direction when you're riding through the dark

Oh that's you and me
That's you and me
