		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought I felt your shape but I was wrong 
Really all I felt was falsely strong 
I held on tight and closed my eyes 
It was dumb I had no sense of your size 

It was dumb to hold so tight 
But last night 
On the birthday in the kitchen 
My grip was loose my eyes were open 

I felt your shape and heard you breathing 
I felt the rise and fall of your chest 
I felt your fall 
Your winter snows 
Your gusty blow 
Your lava flow 
I felt it all 
Your starry night 
Your lack of light 
With limp arms I can feel most of you 

I hung around your neck independently 
And my loss was overwhelmed 
By this new depth I don't think I ever felt 

But I don't know 
The nights are cold 
And I remember warmth 
I could have sworn I wasn't alone
