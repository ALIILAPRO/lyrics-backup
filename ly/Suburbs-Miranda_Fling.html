		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say something rational
You're my realist, I'm your dreamer
I've never minded though
You're my opposite, I'll be your mirror
Honey believe me there's no rush
I can love you twice as much
Someday it will be enough
For the both of us

I don't wanna live in the suburbs 
Save up for a trip in the summer
To know contentment and never wonder
But I swear to God that I don't want any other

You said something cynical
Like every slow song is a sad one
I can forget it though
Play your music, I'm sitting shot gun
Honey I'm really sorry to push
Feels like I love you twice as much
Do you promise I'm enough 
For the both of us

It don't seem so bad in the suburbs
We can save for a trip in the summer
No resentment, I'll never wonder 
I swear to God that I don't want any other

If you live and die in the suburbs
In the arms of a blue eyed lover
Just a question, would you ever wonder
Cuz you sweared to God that you wanted another
