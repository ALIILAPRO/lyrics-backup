		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not gonna brave the winter
And wear us thin to say we did
(We did, we did)
But I don't wanna push a splinter into your skin
So I'll leave it (leave it, leave it)

I didn't mean to wear us all out
Grinding my teeth, there's dust in my mouth
Digging my fingers into the couch (into)

I didn't mean to wear us all out
Grinding my teeth, there's dust in my mouth
Digging my fingers into the couch

Why go call out the number
Even though that it shows?
Offer the other cheek to soften my own
Blow to the bumper
Don't call out the number
And call out the number, I won't

I'd bend barriers and virtue
To feel how I used to
But it all stays in my head for now
And I'll silently stare at the back of your hair
And I'll drive us to your house but it won't settle in since

I didn't mean to wear us all out
Grinding my teeth 'til there's dust in my mouth
Digging my fingers into your couch

I didn't mean to wear us all out
Grinding my teeth 'til there's dust in my mouth
Digging my fingers into your couch

Why go call out the number
Even though that it shows?
Offer the other cheek to soften my own
Blow to the bumper don't call out the number
And call out the number, I won't

Why go call out the number
Even though that it shows?
Offer the other cheek to soften my own
Blow to the bumper, don't call out the number
And call out the number, I won't
