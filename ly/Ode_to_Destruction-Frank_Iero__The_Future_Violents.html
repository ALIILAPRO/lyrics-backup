		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've thought enough for both of us, but I barely said a word
Been back and forth a thousand times hoping not to lose
And I know I should take it slow
But I've never followed suit
And this ache you gave, it dies with me
This time I'm finally through
I wish it wasn't true

And so it goes
I may wish I'd disappear
Let the record slow
As the distance grows, it's like I always feared
I never gave enough and I never wanted to but still I think of you

Would you waste some time on me?
Am I a waste of time?

If you're around next year, even for a day
Would you show your face?
And lay those eyes on me
'Cause I'm a sight to see
I survived so much on my own
That you'll bite your tongue

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

We're deaf to those that tell us truths
That we don't wanna hear
So here's to those that wish us well
The rest can go to hell
Life's a waste without you and me
Life's a waste without you and me

I don't wanna be
Yeah, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be that way
Never gettin' rid
No, you're never gettin' rid
Never gettin' rid of me
And so it goes
