		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Show me a sign, get back in line
Show me all the tricks that you have learned
Show me some spite and if you do it right
I will show you how to kill and burn

Down in the maze every single day
Fighting and biting and this is our trade
Down in the flood we mean you no good
Fight (fight), fight (fight), we fight alright
We are the ones to kiss you goodnight
Die (die), die (die), time goes by
We will shoot out all of your lights

Show me a clue, maybe give me two
Give me everything that I deserve
Show me some hate, before it's too late
And I will show you how to keep your nerve

Down in our holes we burn like coals
Eating the fear of death in your souls
Down in our caves no one is saved
Fight (fight), fight (fight), we fight all right
We are the ones to kiss you goodnight
Die, die, time goes by
We will shoot out all of your lights

Tell me the news, something I can use
Something red-hot to light my fuse
Show me some teeth, sometime next week
I will show you all kinds of abuse

Down here in hell, under our spell
Burning and screaming and laughing as well
Here in the dark, we swim with the sharks
Fight (fight), fight (fight), we fight alright
We are the ones to kiss you goodnight
Die (die), die (die), time goes by
We will shoot out all of your lights
Smite (smite), smite (smite), shine your lights
We are the ones to give you a fright
Die (die), die (die), time goes by
We shoot out all of your lights
