		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitch, I did it, I made it, I'm loved and I'm hated
I started from the bottom, now my neighborhood is gated
They say, "Drink to your accomplishments," so every night I'm faded
Feel like every other day, me and somebody new related
You're my sister, cousin, brother from the other side? (The other side)
I don't know who told you that (my mama)
Well, she fucking lied
Ayy, wake up, wake up, get your cake up
Cut it up like it's cocaine, shake up
All the streets with all these beats
I body beats, I'm not discreet (per-per-perfect)
This is how I feel on the inside
All you non-talent rappin' motherfuckers better run and hide
You worthless, you have no purpose, fuckin' imposter
You gots to get it through your head
You won't ever get no handout
Fuckin' with your ass, it'd be like throwing a band out (per-per-perfect)
My flow increased, my dough increased
You know I leave 'em all deceased
I am a fucking beast, I'm from the East
I keep the peace, don't need a piece
But I keep a piece, got it capiche?
That boy gon' eat, this is a feast
Once I release, I'm smokin' trees
I bought my shit, I don't need no lease
So fuck you up like Master P (perfect)
This shit right here a masterpiece, I'm comin' in hot like the police
Shooting my shot like the police
All on the block like the policemen, who gon' (stop, stop)
The police from leaving bodies in the motherfuckin streets man? (Fire)

Man, fuck the police when it comes to my peeps
He put the hole in his cheek (yeah)
Gold in my teeth, and my pockets obese
Like I got the get money disease (right)
I want my beats, I got more with the heat
When I speak I put rappers to sleep (yeah)
When I get geek, I go black on the beat
And peeling them off of my cleats
Don't stand in my way (hope you offended today), okay
I got some Hannibal ways, and I treat them like dinner today (no way)
I get to feelin' the bass, and I'm saying my grace
And I fuck around bite off your face
Glock is not tucked on the waist, I just spit a 16
And watch everyone duck in the place, perfect
Got a bad bitch that's perfect
Just bought a new crib that's perfect
Vvs in my Jib that's perfect
Got a billion streams that's perfect
And a couple billboards I'm perfect
See clowns in the game, circus
Red dot on the nose I merk 'em, burn 'em
Washin' them all detergent
Me and Nicki gotta couple bitches twerking
Gotta come to a city full a Persians
And we gotta tour bus full of virgins
Swervin' mercy hit the curb and
Why you dumb rappers ain't learnin'? (Yeah)
Make it look good but ain't earning (right)
All of your jewelry turning (yeah)
I'm startin' to get the concerning (right)
I burn up the track like a furnace (alright, that's right)
Been floating so long I'm a star in the sky
And I start to forget what the earth is (fire)

Uh, I quarantine with a foreign ting
Gucci sweats with the drawstrings
Eating X like soy beans (per-per-perfect)
Smiling like I'm Paul Wall
Sippin' all this Pauline
She got a body like an RR
I sleep inside her like an RV
Give me Adderall, give me perc
Fuck it, I'm still on full alert
I eat every pussy on earth, and still have room for dessert
I got porn stars on call
I got Warhol on the wall
Point this sawed-off at your skull
Baow, skull all on the wall
Catch your guard dogs off guard
Get too fuckin' high, never fall hard
Cut the lights off in the RR
She look at the roof and see the Star Wars
And these diamonds got no flaws, that's flawless
All wins, no loses, perfecto
That's foreign, Tunechi, de nada
