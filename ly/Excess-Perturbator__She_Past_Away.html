		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One more night
For me, to bleed
Into the dawn
Breathe the smoke in
Spend the money before you die

One more try
To be free, alone
Into the darkness
Breathe the smoke in
Empty the bottle before you die

Terrible visions in my sleep
I can see your face again
Terrible visions and I'm awake
I can't get away
Terrible visions as you speak
I can see you lying there dead

I didn't do it
I didn't do it for love
What did I do it for?
Did I do it for?

One more trial
To scream, to plead
Into the void
This is the last kiss
Empty the vials before you die

One more child
To lead, alone
Into the cold
Breathe the smoke in
Spend the money before you die

Terrible visions in my sleep
I can see your face again
Terrible visions and I'm awake
I can't get away
Terrible visions as you speak
I can see you lying there dead
I can see you lying there

I didn't do it
I didn't do it for love
I didn't do it
I didn't do it for us

Why did I do it?
What did I do it for?
Did I do it?
Did I do it for-

Excess, excess
Excess, for excess
