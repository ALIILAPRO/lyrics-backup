		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everyday I wake up and I fall from grace
Every move I make has got me stuck in the darkest place
I pray for mercy but I love the fear
I should’ve listened while the angels were living here

I’m sick to my soul
I can’t be controlled
It feels I’m hanging at the end of my rope
I wanna believe that there is still hope
Now I’m hanging in the balance alone
Heaven better tell me where the hell did the angels go

Everyday I ask myself if this is real
I only hurt myself to show you that I can feel
Are you the cancer that I can’t survive
I should’ve listened when the angels were still alive

I’m sick to my soul
I can’t be controlled
It feels I’m hanging at the end of my rope
I wanna believe that there is still hope
Now I’m hanging in the balance alone
I don’t wanna be the last to know
Maybe I should breathe and let it go
Heaven better tell me where the hell did the angels go

My demons are stronger than ever
This lifetime is harder than ever
To become somebody better
Somebody better

I’m sick to my soul
I can’t be controlled
It feels I’m hanging at the end of my rope
I wanna believe that there is still hope
Now I’m hanging in the balance alone
I don’t wanna be the last to know
Maybe I should breathe and let it go
Heaven better tell me where the hell did the angels go

Where did the angels go
Where did the angels go
