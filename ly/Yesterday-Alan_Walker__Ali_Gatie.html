		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Held your hand in a dream I had in New York
But I never turned around to see your face
Two drunk kids on a boulevard, you faded
Woke up to another empty bed

Now I'm choking
No one knows how I feel
Now you're gone
I don't know what's real

I close my eyes and make tomorrow yesterday
I miss your smile like the deserts miss the rain
Ten thousand tears, but you would dry them all away
If I could make tomorrow yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
Tomorrow yesterday
Tomorrow yesterday

We'd head west in a car we can't afford, yeah
Flaming lips looking at the stars just friends
I watch the moonlight dancin' on, on the water
'Cause I see your face in everything

Now I'm choking
No one knows how I feel
Now you're gone
I don't know what's real

I close my eyes and make tomorrow yesterday
I miss your smile like the deserts miss the rain
Ten thousand tears, but you would dry them all away
If I could make tomorrow yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
Tomorrow yesterday
Tomorrow yesterday

Now I'm choking
No one knows how I feel
Now you're gone
I don't know what's real
