		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Someone's always comin' around here, trailin' some new kill
Says, "I've seen your picture on a hundred dollar bill"
What's a game of chance to you, to him is one of real skill
So glad to meet you, Angeles

Pickin' up the ticket shows there's money to be made
Go on, lose the gamble, that's the history of the trade
Did you add up all the cards left to play to zero
And sign up with evil, Angeles?

Don't start me tryin' now
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
'Cause I'm all over it, Angeles

I can make you satisfied in everything you do
All your secret wishes could right now be coming true
And be forever with my poison arms around you
No one's gonna fool around with us
No one's gonna fool around with us
So glad to meet you, Angeles
