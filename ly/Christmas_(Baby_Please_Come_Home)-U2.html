		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's Christmas, baby, please come home

The snow's comin' down (Christmas)
I'm watchin' it fall (Christmas)
Lots of people around (Christmas)
Baby, please come home

The church bells in town (Christmas)
They're ringin' a song (Christmas)
What a happy sound (Christmas)
Baby, please come home

They're singin' "Deck The Halls"
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

Pretty lights on the tree (Christmas)
I'm watchin' 'em shine (Christmas)
You should be here with me (Christmas)
Baby, please come home
Baby, please come home
Baby, please come home

They're singin' "Deck The Halls"
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

If there was a way (Christmas)
I'd hold back these tears (Christmas)
But it's Christmas day (Christmas)
Baby, please come home (Christmas)
Home (Christmas)
Baby, please come home
Baby, please come home
Baby, please come home
Baby, please come home
