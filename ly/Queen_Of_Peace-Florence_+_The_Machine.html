		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, the king
Gone mad within his suffering
Called out for relief
Someone cure him of his grief

His only son
Cut down, but the battle won
Oh, what is it worth?
When all that's left is hurt

Like the stars chase the sun
Over the glowing hill, I will conquer
Blood is running deep
Some things never sleep

Suddenly I'm overcome
Dissolving like the setting sun
Like a boat into oblivion
'Cause you're driving me away

Now you have me on the run
The damage is already done
Come on, is this what you want?
'Cause you're driving me away

Oh, the queen of peace
Always does her best to please
Is it any use?
Somebody's gotta lose

Like a long stream
I'll bear all this echoing
Oh, what is it worth?
All that's left is hurt

Like the stars chase the sun
Over the glowing hill, I will conquer
Blood is running deep
Some things never sleep

Suddenly I'm overcome
Dissolving like the setting sun
Like a boat into oblivion
'Cause you're driving me away

Now you have me on the run
The damage is already done
Come on, is this what you want?
'Cause you're driving me away

And my love is no good
Against the fortress that it made of you
Blood is running deep
Sorrow that you keep

Suddenly I'm overcome (overcome)
Dissolving like the setting sun (setting)
Like a boat into oblivion
'Cause you're driving me away

Now you have me on the run (on the run)
The damage is already done (already done)
Come on, is this what you want?
'Cause you're driving me away
