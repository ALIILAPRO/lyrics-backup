		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Am I looking older?
'Cause, girl, you look the same
Did I see a sadness
Written on your face?

One life
Did I leave it too late?
Realised that I didn't say the words like I should have done
I never felt this way for anyone

There's something I forgot to tell you
Something only I knew
All the love that I ever needed, I got it from you

I know it's hard to believe it
With all the shit that I do
But all the love that I ever needed, I got it from you

Did I give you pleasure
Or did I give you pain?
Did I leave you sleepless
Thinkin' I won't change?

One life
Did I leave it too late?
Realised that I didn't say the words like I should have done
I never felt this way for anyone

There's something I forgot to tell you
Something only I knew
All the love that I ever needed, I got it from you

I know it's hard to believe it
With all the shit that I do
But all the love that I ever needed, I got it from you

It took some time to realise
That every day you saved my life (you saved my life)
And all the love that I could find, I got it from you 
(I got it from you)

There's something I forgot to tell you
Something only I knew
All the love that I ever needed, I got it from you
