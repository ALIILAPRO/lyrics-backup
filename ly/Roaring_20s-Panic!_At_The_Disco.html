		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Broadway is black like a sinkhole
Everyone raced to the suburbs
And I'm on the rooftop with curious strangers
This is the oddest of summers
Maybe I'll medicate, maybe inebriate
Strange situations, I get anxious
Maybe I'll smile a bit, maybe the opposite
But pray that they don't call me thankless

My tell-tale heart's a hammer in my chest
Cut me a silk-tied tourniquet

This is my roaring, roaring 20's
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt, 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt, 'cause I wanna go home
My roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt, 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt, 'cause I want, I wanna go home

Oscars and Emmy's and Grammy's
Everyone here is a trophy
And I'm sipping bourbon
The future's uncertain
The past on the pavement below me
Maybe I'll elevate, maybe I'm second rate
So unaware of my status
Maybe I'm overjoyed, maybe I'm paranoid
Designer me up in straight jackets

My tell-tale heart's a hammer in my chest
Cut me a silk-tied tourniquet

This is my roaring, roaring 20's
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt, 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt, 'cause I wanna go home
My roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt, 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt, 'cause I want, I wanna go home

Hallucinations only mean that your brain is on fire
If it's Lord of the Flies in my mind tonight
I don't know if I will survive
Lighters up if you're feelin' me
Fade to black if you're not mine
'Cause I just need a sign, or a signal inside

This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me a, roll me a blunt

This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I want, I wanna go home

I wanna go home
