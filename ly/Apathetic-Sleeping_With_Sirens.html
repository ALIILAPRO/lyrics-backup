		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I keep digging up graves
No hope to be saved, I start to decay
I cut off both my wings and now I'm falling from grace
(I'm falling from grace)

How did we get to this place?
I'm out of my mind, a hopeless case
Cut off both my wings, I'm falling
Right back on my knees, I'm crawling

No hope (no hope), no wishing (no wishing)
Just give me something to believe in

'Cause we're lost and apathetic
As we stare into the world unknown
Say we don't get it
Maybe it's better if we let this go
Don't tell me to forget it
Think it's time that I let you know
No, we won't regret it
Don't wanna hear you sayin' that I told you so

I've been out on my own
Face down in the dirt I wait by the phone
I'm hoping for a call, but there is
Nobody there, you don't care at all

'Cause we're lost and apathetic
As we stare into the world unknown
Say we don't get it
Maybe it's better if we let this go
Don't tell me to forget it
I think it's time that I let you know
No, we won't regret it
Don't wanna hear you sayin' that I told you so
Don't wanna hear you sayin' that I told you so

Been staring down the barrel of a loaded gun
Finger on the trigger, nowhere left to run

Staring down the barrel of a loaded gun
Finger on the trigger, nowhere left to run

'Cause we're lost and apathetic
As we stare into the world unknown
Say we don't get it
Maybe it's better if we let this go

'Cause we're lost and apathetic
As we stare into the world unknown
Say we don't get it
Maybe it's better if we let this go
Don't tell me to forget it (don't forget it)
I think it's time that I let you know
No, we won't regret it
Don't wanna hear you sayin' that I told you so
Don't wanna hear you sayin' that I told you so

(Don't wanna hear you sayin' that I told you so)
(Don't wanna hear you sayin' that I told you so)
