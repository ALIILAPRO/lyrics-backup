		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Quick two-hour flight, touched down in Atlanta
You better be on time, I want you to take it off, it off
I don't stress 'cause he the pilot, only finest dinin'
Can't nobody sit with us, it's a two-seater recliner
Kiss me on my mouth, kiss me in a mood
He say, "On the way," he know just what to do

When I'm in town, he know it's on
Out of office, we on road
Put the Tesla on airplane mode
That's all that I want, yeah
Turn the lights off, turn me on
When I fall back, he take control
What we do next? I don't know

Show me you ride for me (yeah)
Yeah, yeah (yeah)
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, show me you ride for me (yeah)
Yeah, yeah (yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Show me you ride for me

Baby mama drama, we don't do it
He got what I want, I pursue it
Tried to cut me off, couldn't do it
I knew it (ha-ha), I knew it
Be the one to call when I need it
Sign the NDA's, don't repeat it
Just need you do it, no Adidas, I did it

Say you a winner, winner, well, I finish first
Get it wetter, wetter, I will fill the thirst
You know better, better than to fuck with her
Don't kill the messenger, oh, oh, oh

When I'm in town, he know it's on
Out of office, 'cause we on road
Put the Tesla on airplane mode
That's all that I want, yeah
Turn the lights off, turn me on
When I fall back, take control
What we do next? I don't know

Show me you ride for me (yeah)
Yeah, yeah (yeah)
Yeah, yeah (yeah)
Yeah, show me you ride for me
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Show me you ride for me
