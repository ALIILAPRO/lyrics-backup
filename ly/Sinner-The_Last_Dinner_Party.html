		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish I knew you
Back when we were both small
I wish I knew you
But I have gotten too tall
I wish I knew you
When touch was innocent
I wish I knew you
Before it felt like a sin

Felt like a sin
Before it felt like a sin
Felt like a sin
Before it felt like a sin

There's nothing for me
Here, where the world is small
But how you touch me
For that, I'd leave it all
Back in the city
Cold eyes and lips of dust
So turn and face me
Turn to the altar of lust

Felt like a sin
Before it felt like a sin
(Pray for me on your knees)
(Pray for me on your knees)
(Pray for me on your knees)
Before it felt like a sin
Felt like a sin
Before it felt like a sin
(Pray for me on your knees)
(Pray for me on your knees)
(Pray for me on your knees)
Before it felt like a sin

Stay through the night
I'd spend the mornings by your side
(Pray for me on your knees)
Time slips away (pray for me on your knees)
(Pray for me on your knees)
Before the hillside turns to grey

Pray for me, kneel with me
Soak in the crystal stream
Wash the sin from your back
Cleanse my soul, make me whole
Dance in the morning glow
Hold me, we can't go back
Before it felt like a sin

Felt like a sin
Before it felt like a sin
(Pray for me on your knees)
(Pray for me on your knees)
(Pray for me on your knees)
Before it felt like a sin
Felt like a sin
Before it felt like a sin
