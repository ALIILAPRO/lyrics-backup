		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  These niggas ligthweight and we heavyweight
Roli me a blunt, I sit back and meditate
Been a long time, but it's time to celebrate

I put that white Cartier on my wrist
But just know Black Lives Matter (black Lives)
She told me when she get hit from the back
She noticed her ass get fatter (hit it)
Came from the bottom, not talkin' the grass
I came from the dirt of the gravel (dirt)
Pull up, hop out with a stallion (hop out)
She got a Chrome Heart saddle (chrome)
I made a M today, thank God, it's time to celebrate (thank God)
I'm talkin' to heavyweight, can't fuck with niggas, they featherweight
She keep tryna play Patty Cake
I told the ho, "Look at my Patek face" (look at my Patek face)
Nigga don't get no handshake, get hot shells fuckin' with the gang, okay

Patty Cake like it's third grade
I went and bulletproofed the Escalade (skrr)
Mask on me like a masquerade
I shoot him like a clipper, fuck a fade (baow)
Me and Take pop up like a date (take)
'Cause we go together anyway
Unc' and 'phew stickin' like glue ('Phew)
It's some dogs runnin' on the loose (ruff)
Niggas sweet, sugar shane
No, I won't tell another nigga name (hey, Take)
Who you buddy? Want a name? Huh
No, he not part of the game (nah)
My young niggas out catchin' stains (stains)
And no we not leavin' no stains (no)
Quavo like Steph with the three (splash)
Huncho like Dirk in the paint (Dirk)

You feel like dirt in the pain, nah
I fill the cup up with drank (Drank)
Put this shit down, I can't
Maybe one day but today not the day (no)
We got pounds to break
Backend comin' in all kind of ways (yeah)
I'ma stack it up then throw it in a safe (throw it)
Can't dismiss, can't get my cake

I put that white Cartier on my wrist
But just know Black Lives Matter (black Lives)
She told me when she get hit from the back
She noticed her ass get fatter (hit it)
Came from the bottom, not talkin' the grass
I came from the dirt of the gravel (dirt)
Pull up, hop out with a stallion (hop out)
She got a Chrome Heart saddle (chrome)
I made a M today, thank God, it's time to celebrate (thank God)
I'm talkin' to heavyweight, can't fuck with niggas, they featherweight
She keep tryna play Patty Cake
I told the ho, "Look at my Patek face" (look at my Patek face)
Nigga don't get no handshake, get hot just fuckin' with the gang, okay

You know who made the beat
