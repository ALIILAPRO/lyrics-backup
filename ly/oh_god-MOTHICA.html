		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh god
What did I do
I’m out of control again 
Woke up
Blacker then blue 
Probably lost a friend 

My throats so fucking dry from saying sorry 
Wake up a different person in the morning
Forget every lesson daddy taught me
I never learn, I just make it worse

Oh god 
What have I done 
What did I say last night 
Did I play the fool
Did I make you believe 
I was having a good time 
Cause i’ve been drinking all of my emotions 
Until i’m sick until i’m broken 
Oh god 
What have I done?
What have I done?

Oh no
Shoulda stayed home
But it’s hard to be alone sometimes
Dark thoughts
Got me so low
I’d do anything to clear my mind

Oh god 
What have I done 
What did I say last night 
Did I play the fool
Did I make you believe 
I was having a good time 
Cause i’ve been drinking all of my emotions 
Until i’m sick until i’m broken 
Oh god 
What have I done?
What have I done?

Wasted, all the nights I missed
Poison on my lips, all alone
I'm done, i’m done hiding it
I'm done fighting it on my own
