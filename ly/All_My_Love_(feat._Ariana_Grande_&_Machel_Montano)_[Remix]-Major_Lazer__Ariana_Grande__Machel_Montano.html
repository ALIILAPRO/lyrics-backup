		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All I want yeah, only love yeah, all I say yeah
All I want yeah, only love yeah, yo Major Lazer

Hey DJ, bust a tune then pull it up
If your cup's empty, fill it up
Spend more love, cause we can't get enough
Baby girl, just bad wind it up
If the party a nice then we a go
Just drop to the bass and the piano
We'll fly to vacation in Cilago
Listen to the scenario
We doing it larger than life, larger than life
Spread up and then let it fly
Raise it up, higher than high, yeah
And put your hands in the sky, hands in the sky
Major Lazer and intensify
Raise it up, higher than high, yeah
So stop, turn it up

Only love will make us ache (turn it up)
Only love is worth the chase (let's turn it up)
All my love, I know we're waiting for this
On the rocks upon the mountain tops

Turn it up and show them, show them, all my love
Turn it up and show them, show them, all my love
Turn it up and show them, show them, all my love
Turn it up and show them, show them, up on the mountain top

Ariana let's go

All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say
We're just a mess of broken people but we love the game
I would do anything for us, it's worth the pain
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say

Only love will make us ache (turn it up)
Only love is worth the chase (let's turn it up)
All my love, I know we're waiting for this
On the rocks upon the mountain tops

Turn it up and show them, show them, all my love
Turn it up and show them, show them, all my love
Turn it up and show them, show them, all my love
Turn it up and show them, show them, up on the mountain top
All my love
All my love
All my love
Up on the mountain top

You're always on my mind, oh, there'll come a day
Day where we can fly, reach the glory haze, oh, hey
High up in the sun in the brightest sky
Sun in the brightest sky

Only love will make us ache (turn it up)
Only love is worth the chase (let's turn it up)
All my love, I know we're waiting for this
On the rocks upon the mountain tops

My love is larger than life, larger than life, all my love
Is larger than life, larger than life, all my love
Larger than life, larger than life, all my love
Is larger than life, larger than life, up on the mountain top
All my love
All my love
All my love
Up on the mountain top
