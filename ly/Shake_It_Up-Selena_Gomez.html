		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't like waiting
Don't like waiting
Lets go right now!
Gotta' hit the ground
Dancing before the music
Slows down

What I'm sayin'
What I'm sayin'
If there's something to fix
Take it to another level,
This is the remix

Everybody, everybody
Get out on the floor
It can get a little crazy
When the kick hits the floor

Make a scene
Make a scene
Nobody can ignore
Don't knock it, til you rock it
We can't take it no more

Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Dust yourself off,
Shake it up!
Shake it up!
DJ set it off!
Take it up a notch
All together now!
Shake it up!
Shake it up!

Shake it up!
Break it down
Break it down
I've got something to say
When you're dancin' with me,
It's like we go MIA

Make a scene
Make a scene
Nobody can ignore
Don't knock it, til you rock it
We can't take it no more

Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Dust yourself off,
Shake it up
Shake it up
DJ set it off
Take it up a notch
All together now
Shake it up
Shake it up

Sh-sh-sh-shake it up,
You gotta change it up
And if the days not right?
Just brush it off tonight
Put on the attitude
Your in my pocket mood
And when you've had enough,
Sh-sh-sh-shake it up

Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Dust yourself off,
Shake it up
Shake it up
DJ set it off
Take it up a notch
All together now
Shake it up
Shake it up

Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Dust yourself off,
Shake it up
Shake it up
DJ set it off
Take it up a notch
All together now
Shake it up
Shake it up
