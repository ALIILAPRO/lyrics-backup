		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This hotel bar is full of people,
The piano man is really laying it down,
The old bartender is as high as a steeple, 
So why tonight should I wear a frown? 

The joint is jumpin' all around me,
And my mood is really not in style,
Right now the blues flock to surround me,
But I'll break out after a while.

Yes I'm a million miles away,
I'm a million miles away,
I'm sailing like a driftwood,
On a windy bay,
On a windy bay.

I'm a million miles away,
I'm a million miles away,
But I'm sailing like a driftwood,
On a windy bay,
On a windy bay.

Why ask how I feel,
Well, how does it look to you?
I fell hook, line and sinker, 
Lost my captain and my crew.

I'm standing on the landing, 
There's no one there but me,
That's where you'll find me,
Looking out on the deep blue sea.

There's a song on the lips of everybody, 
There's a smile all around the room,
There's conversation overflowing, 
But I sit here with the blues.

This hotel bar has lost all its people, 
The piano man has caught the last bus home,
The old bartender just collapsed in the corner, 
Why I'm still here, I just don't know,
I don't know.

I'm a million miles away,
A million miles away,
I'm sailing like a driftwood on a windy bay,
On a windy bay.

I'm a million miles away,
A million miles away,
I'm sailing like a driftwood on a windy bay,
Send me away...
