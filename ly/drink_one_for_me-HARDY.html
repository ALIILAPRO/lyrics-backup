		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hope that you hear this
When you're fishing off the pier
Or listening to Skynyrd jacked up at the skinning rack
Caping out a ten point deer
And I know that you got some
In a beat up blue ice chest
Just know I'm sorry I couldn't make it to the party
Could you do me a cold one request?

Drink one for me
Drink one for me
Just know I'd be there holding one in the air
If I didn't have somewhere to be
When you hit that 7-11
Get a little more than you think you need
I hate to tell you but they ain't got beer in Heaven
So boys when you drink one
Drink one for me
Drink one for me

I guess God forgave me
For every one too many buzz
'Cause I'm up here now
Smiling, looking down at all of y'all catching one
So if you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
Getting a little more drunk

Drink one for me
Drink one for me
Just know I'd be there holding one in the air
If I didn't have somewhere to be
When you hit that 7-11
Get a little more than you think you need
I hate to tell you but they ain't got beer in Heaven
So boys when you drink one
Drink one for me

And I begged Jesus when I got here
To send me back for just one night
'Cause I didn't know that last beer
Was the last beer of my life
He said, "They'll be fine without you"
"Just give them a couple years"
But if there's one way to keep my memory alive
'Til the day y'all meet me here it's

Drink one for me
Drink one for me
Just know I'd be there holding one in the air
If I didn't have somewhere to be
When you hit that 7-11
Get a little more than you think you need
I hate to tell you but they ain't got beer in Heaven
So boys when you drink one
Drink one for me
Drink one for me, yeah

I hope that you hear this
When you're fishing off the pier
Or listening to Skynyrd, jacked up at the skinning rack
Caping out a ten point deer
