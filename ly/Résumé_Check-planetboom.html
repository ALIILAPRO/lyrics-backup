		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Humble as a lamb but as strong as a lion
He is God in the highest
And there ain't nothing higher
He can walk on the water
He can talk in the fire
He's the hope of the nations
When it's down to the wire

It's the feeding the thousands
It's the mending the broken
It's the healing the sick
It's the nothing to something
It's the hope for the hopeless
It's the life-changing moments
It's the way that You walk
And You talk and You're alive

Résumé chеck, Ancient of Days
Lamb that was slain, breaker of chains
Résumé chеck, beginning and end
Saviour of men, killer of death
Résumé check, way truth life
God most high, all creation bows it's knee
To the holy King of kings
God of Heaven and beneath
Lemme tell ya 'bout Him jesus is His name

Alpha and omega resurrected Saviour
He's the Author of life
He's the universe maker
The almighty creator the OG planet-shaker
He's who was and He is
And He'll be there forever
Lemme tell ya 'bout Him
But, man, how do you put God into words?

It's the feeding the thousands
It's the mending the broken
It's the healing the sick
It's the nothing to something
It's the hope for the hopeless
It's the life-changing moments
It's the way that You walk
And You talk and You're alive

Résumé check, Ancient of Days
Lamb that was slain, breaker of chains
Résumé check, beginning and end
Saviour of men, killer of death
Résumé check, way truth life
God most high, all creation bows it's knee
To the holy King of kings
God of Heaven and beneath
Lemme tell ya 'bout Him jesus is His name

He accepted His death
But He wasn't defeated
He took hold of the keys
And He unlocked the kingdom
Yeah, He switched 'em for freedom
Even death couldn't beat Him
Now He's living and breathing
There ain't nothing can beat Him, Ha
Now, He's alive and He's living in me, Ha
He changed my life
Now I'm living and free, Ha jesus is king
Yeah, that's what I believe, Ha
He is the Lord and He's reigning supreme

Résumé check, Ancient of Days
Lamb that was slain, breaker of chains
Résumé check, beginning and end
Saviour of men, killer of death
Résumé check, way truth life
God most high, all creation bows it's knee
To the holy King of kings
God of Heaven and beneath
Lemme tell ya 'bout Him jesus is His name
