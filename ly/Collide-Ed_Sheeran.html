		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh yeah, we've been in the rain
Been on the rocks, but we found our way
We've ordered pizza to an aeroplane
Slept on the beach like we were castaways
We've been a storm
Been to an Irish bar in central Rome
Driven to hospitals with broken bones
Shared a toothbrush and shared our home

We've seen the moon reflect on the rolling tide
Been up at 5 AM, watching the sunrise
Because the world looks better when I'm by your side
Oh I, oh I, oh I

When you and I collide
You bring me to life
Yeah, you bring me to life
You bring me to life
When you and I collide
You bring me to life
Yeah, you bring me to life
You bring me to life

We've been on the road
We've watched the blossom fall to earth like snow
Fumbled in cubicles in Tokyo
And been to funerals in rented clothes

Mmm, we drank your father's whiskey when your grandma died
You brought me to the morning through my darkest night
Yeah, the world hurts less when I'm by your side
Oh I, oh I, oh I

When you and I collide
You bring me to life
You bring me to life
You bring me to life
When you and I collide
You bring me to life
Yeah, you bring me to life
Yeah, you bring me to life

Head first, colliding
Dreamers, colliding
Universe, colliding
Your love let the light in
Head first, colliding
Dreamers, colliding
Universe, colliding

We made love in the sky
Overslept and missed the Northern Lights
You lost your wedding ring but I didn't mind
'Cause I got a feeling, baby, we'll be fine
