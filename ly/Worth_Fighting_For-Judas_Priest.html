		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You said I could never find
A way to ease your mind
That where I'd go you'd wind up in the dust

I tried so hard to have you reach
Another side of me
Instead you went to nowhere and forgot

So I wander on
Asking where you might have gone
From what I knew before
Some things are worth fighting for

Desert heat can wear you down
But still I'm rollin' through
Did I see your figure in the haze

I am driven by a thirst
To quench myself of love
The sun beats on me for the price I've paid

So I wander on
Asking where you might have gone
From what I knew before
Some things are worth fighting for

Night road leads me to a town of ghosts
Beckoned by the glow of kerosene and tumbleweed
They're calling out (They're calling out)
Forevermore (Forevermore)
Worth fighting for

I'm leaning in the wind
Head bowed down from what I saw
My shadow for a friend
Still some things are worth fighting for

So I'm moving on
Asking where you might have gone
From what I knew before
Some things are worth fighting for
Yeah !

Worth fighting for!
