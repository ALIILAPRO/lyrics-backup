		  Fireball 3:36

I’ve got a girl who won’t hold my hand
won’t let me down, she won’t let me in
‘cause she’s so damn mean
and oh, I love her so

I’ve got a girl with a black Cadillac
Won’t let me drive nor ride in the back
‘cause she hates me
And I can’t say I blame her one bit

She run around with a switchblade
So damn tough
She stays drunk all the time
Fireball

Oh I love her and I can’t let her go
Oh I love her and I want her to know

I’ve got a girl who won’t meet my dad
Says it will only make her sad and I know it
‘cause she don’t know a love like we have
I got a girl who wants me at home
When I’m there I feel so alone and I hate it
She knows exactly how I stay


She run around with a switchblade
So damn tough
She stays drunk all the time
Fireball

She run around with a switchblade
So damn tough
She stays drunk all the time
Fireball
