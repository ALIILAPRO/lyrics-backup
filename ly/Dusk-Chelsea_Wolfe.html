		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Watch this empire as it burns and dissipates
Haunted, on fire, on the wings that we create
Angels (angels), vampires (vampires)
One breathes life unto the other
Branded (branded), baptized (baptized)
By your love and by your hunger
And I would give you my life
One sin leads to another
And I would go through fire to get to you

In these confines, true love's shadow still awaits
Cracked and (cracked and) fractured (fractured)
Held anew and whole again
Can you contain my love? Call me back together
'Cause I will run through the fire to get to you

Don't give me hope
Don't make me call
Don't give me hope
Don't make me call

And I will go through the fire
And I will go through the fire
And I will go through the fire
And I will
