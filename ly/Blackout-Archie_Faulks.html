		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'd like to be wherever you are,
I hate this distance.
Guess I'll keep loving you from a far
With your nation's assistance.
It's taking me a couple' years to realise
Now it's happening like a chain reaction
It's your face when all the lights around me die, so l'll them all.
'Cause when I blackout, I'm with you
When I black out, I'm with you.
In the night and in my daydreams too.
Yeah there really isn't anything that I'd rather do than blackout.

I felt the coming in my car, we drove to Scotland.
Now I'm thinking about driving very fast just in case you forgot 'em.
It's taken me a couple' years to realize
Now it's happening like a chain reaction
It's your face when all the lights
Around me die, so I'll kill them all.
'Cause when I blackout I'm with you.
'Cause when I blackout I'm alone with you.
In the night and in my daydreams too.
'Cause right now there really isn't
Anything that I'd rather do than blackout.
Than blackout, than blackout with you.
So, look at me in this terrace,
It's so near the truth i can't bear it.
I want to be someone to you.
'Cause right now there isn't
Anything that I'd rather do than blackout.
