		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know I want it
I don't wanna hide
Pretending I don't want it
'Cause I deserve it deserve it
I'm not worried
What you'll think of me
When you see what's inside me
'Cause I know you (I know you)

Don't look away, look in my eyes (hey)
Show me your heart, do not disguise (hey)
You can run but you cannot hide, no, no
Even if you tell me goodbye (hey)
Whenever you open your eyes (hey)
You'll think of me, you're hypnotized
(Yeah, yeah)

You're gonna say more, more, more, more, more and more
Can't help but say more, more, more and more 
'Cause you can't get enough
I wanna have more, more, more, more, more and more
And you will say more, more, more and more 
'Cause it's never enough (more)

You'll be begging for more
(More and more)
'Cause you can't get enough (love)
You'll be craving for more
(More and more)
'Cause it's never enough

Do you feel me?
Or do you still not understand
How much you love me?
Boy, you need me, you want me
Stop pretending, I can see it in your eyes
You're already mine
'Cause I know you, I know you

Even if you cover your ears
Push me away for years and years
In your heart I won't disappear 
(Be right there) no, no

If I ever call out your name
Your heart will feel just like the same
You are gonna be mine again 
And once again

You're gonna say more, more, more, more, more and more
Can't help but say more, more, more and more 
'Cause you can't get enough
I wanna have more, more, more, more, more and more
And you will say more, more, more and more 
'Cause it's never enough (more)

You'll be begging for more
(More and more)
'Cause you can't get enough, 'nough
You'll be craving for more
(More and more)
'Cause it's never enough (more)

I'm a greedy girl
Sorry, if you didn't know
Take my apology
Because I want you more and more
Gonna steal your heart
Own it and won't let it go
By then, you'll understand
You can't say no, no
I'll be sneaking in you heart like a stray cat
Conquer it, and put my mark on it like a tat
My love, so sweet, the plan will never fall flat
And once again (more)

You'll be begging for more (you're gonna say)
(More and more) 
'Cause you can't get enough ('cause it's never enough)
You'll be craving for more (more and more)
(More and more)
'Cause it's never enough (more)
