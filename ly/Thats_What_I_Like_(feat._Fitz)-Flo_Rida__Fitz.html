		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I said hey, that's what I like, I like about you!
The way you do what you do, how you do, I like about you!
Come on now, hey, that's what I like, I like about you!
The way you do what you do, how you do, I like about you!
I said hey, hey, hey, hey!

They call me Ali Bomaye, M.I.A. to [?], baby
I go hard, so don't come lazy, come lazy
This is my party, don't be late
And how much fun can one man take?
You walk past and I go crazy
Oh my, my, my, my
Like it, like it, checkmate yeah
I'm movin' up, up, shut 'em all down
I like it, like it, I get bread
I got a tour, a black Ferrari, zoom on it
Hop in and let's get it started
My party, you got in
And that's why I said

I said hey, that's what I like, I like about you!
The way you do what you do, how you do, I like about you!
Come on now, hey, that's what I like, I like about you!
The way you do what you do, how you do, I like about you!
I said hey, hey, hey, hey!

My mama ain't raise no fool or no failure
Only go first place, let me upgrade yah
Ol√©, red flag I'm wavin'
Your way, drop down, I'm chasin'
Oh my, my, my you look
Look so bad, bad like good
Good times, all the time I'm havin'
Tonight and I don't mind braggin'
Give me one for the treble, I need two for the bass
I spend my three wishes on you, that's just my generous ways
Throw it back like history, I work the play
A little harder than the rest like Dr. J
I'm an all time great, you twerk the same like
Oh my, my, my, my

One, two, one two three four

I said hey, that's what I like, I like about you!
The way you do what you do, how you do, I like about you!
Come on now, hey, that's what I like, I like about you!
The way you do what you do, how you do, I like about you!
I said hey, hey, hey, hey!
