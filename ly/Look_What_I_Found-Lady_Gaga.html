		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (One, two, three)

I'm alone in my house
I'm out on the town
I'm at the bottom of the bottle
I've been knockin' them down

I can't get back up on my feet
See the lights all on the streetlight stars

But look what I found
Look what I found
Another piece of my heart
Just layin' on the ground

Another foggy day
I'm looking for a light
And my only prayer
Is working tonight

I can't get myself out of bed
Hear these voices in my head like a song

But look what I found
Somebody who loves me
Look what I found
Somebody who carry
'Round a piece of my heart
Just layin' on the ground

When I met you I was blown to pieces
Heart all over the floor
Ever since you put me back together
I can't believe it, can't believe it, uh!

Look what you found, yeah, baby
Look what I found
Someone who carry 'round a piece of my heart
Look what I found, woo, c'mon
Look what I found
Somebody who loves me
Look what we found
Someone who carry 'round a piece of my heart, heart
Just layin' on the ground
