		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, you really wanna be somebody
You really wanna be
Oh, you really wanna be somebody
Now go and drop the beat, yeah

He tryna get it with that lowkey no heat
I'm all venom with the cash and the flow sweet
The look flames and lash looking smokey
I got a top body, every mans tryna go see

Money on the regiment
Ain't never worried 'bout a nigga with no sentiment
Read about it, take a picture of the Vetements
Don't get twisted, when I step
Move aside, bye why my effect

When I hit the club like "hi hi, your blessed"
Tip the bar give fly, eyes
And talks on the minimum, clinks on the max
Got them caught in their feelings from keeping it stacked

The pitch and the catch, don't sleep on the facts
I could leave you on read, can't you see that it's snatch
Leave me to be, no keeping the pact
Cause I'm married to the money, lil rat

Oh, you really wanna be somebody
You really wanna be
Oh, you really wanna be somebody
Now go and drop the beat, yeah

Yeah, I'm the topic that you know you wanna tag
You see it from the front, it's even better from the back
Last time I checked I'm the bag
Last guy I left want it bad

Balance on the mind, I'm meditating don't approach me
No, I don't need nobody to coach me
Hit 'em wit' the stunt, clutch
Drive by in the Louis pumps, yesh

It's not on me, that you're complicated
You're messy, you keep losing your head
Wait, ah hah hah hah

Hair, back, wind it up
Stay breaking necks so you better come correct
And no flex, boy your time is up
Threw your shit outside the door
To the left, to the left

Oh, you really wanna be somebody
You really wanna be
Oh, you really wanna be somebody
Now go and drop the beat, yeah

Oh, you really wanna be somebody
You really wanna be
Oh, you really wanna be somebody
Now go and drop the beat, yeah

Now go and drop the beat, yeah
