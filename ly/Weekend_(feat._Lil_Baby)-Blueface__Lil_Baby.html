		  (Shout my nigga Cinco)

When you rich, every day is the weekend (weekend)
Bougie bitch put her feet in, bad bitches in the deep end (in the deep end)
Party on the weekend (party, party)
Keep my bitch in good condition like some leave-in (ooh)
When you rich, every day is the weekend (weekend)
Bougie bitch put her feet in, bad bitches in the deep end (in the deep end)
Party on the weekend (party, party)
Keep my bitch in good condition like some leave-in (ooh)

Keep my bitch in good condition like some leave-in
Every couple weeks she need a new weave and
If she can't suck, she is not succeedin'
I'm really mean 'cause they all know the meanin'
No I in team but there's a I in teamin'
Linkin' up, teamin' up just to get a nut
Too many bills, the money counter jammin' up
My last bitch left the internet in a rush
I'm not crazy, I just don't really give a fuck
If they pay me, I go to Milwaukee for the buck
You niggas posted for the 'Gram, I'm really posted up
If your watch cost a house, nigga hold it up

When you rich, every day is the weekend (weekend)
Bougie bitch put her feet in, bad bitches in the deep end (in the deep end)
Party on the weekend (party, party)
Keep my bitch in good condition like some leave-in (ooh)
When you rich, every day is the weekend (weekend)
Bougie bitch put her feet in, bad bitches in the deep end (in the deep end)
Party on the weekend (party, party)
Keep my bitch in good condition like some leave-in (ooh)

B-b-baby
Every day the weekend (weekend)
I don't have to pretend
When she let me hit it, I go deep in
I was in the trenches playin' defense
Pull up in a big Crip blue Benz
Yeah, I'm just vibin', won't come through
And Blueface in the cut so your friends could come too (yeah aight)
Yeah aight, I get money on sight
Every day a holiday, I swear I'm lovin' my life
Five foot, fat ass, she just might be my type (ooh)
Fucked around and rushed her, she thought that I was bullshittin'
Everything you do on the weekend, daily I'm joinin'
That's your best friend? Go and influence her, doin' ruin it (yeah)

When you rich, every day is the weekend (weekend)
Bougie bitch put her feet in, bad bitches in the deep end (in the deep end)
Party on the weekend (party, party)
Keep my bitch in good condition like some leave-in (ooh)
When you rich, every day is the weekend (weekend)
Bougie bitch put her feet in, bad bitches in the deep end (in the deep end)
Party on the weekend (party, party)
Keep my bitch in good condition like some leave-in (ooh)

Nails done, hair did every weekend
Keep my birds and lay the season like some chicken
I get paid to go in club you couldn't get in
I just hit a bitch another nigga missin'
Hit from the back, you niggas here missin'
When you rich, every day is the weekend (weekend)
Wake up every day at noon in good condition (good condition)
And I ain't even have to call her for the leave in
Have you ever made a hunnid in a weekend? (In a weekend)
She call me talkin' 'bout a meeting, I put the meat in
I see the birds, pick up and I speak in
You can't name a bitch that wasn't in my DM

When you rich, every day is the weekend (weekend)
Bougie bitch put her feet in, bad bitches in the deep end (in the deep end)
Party on the weekend (party, party)
Keep my bitch in good condition like some leave-in (ooh)
When you rich, every day is the weekend (weekend)
Bougie bitch put her feet in, bad bitches in the deep end (in the deep end)
Party on the weekend (party, party)
Keep my bitch in good condition like some leave-in (ooh)
