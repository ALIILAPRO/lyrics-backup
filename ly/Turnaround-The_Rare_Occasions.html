		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We all wait for the turnaround
The fall of our despair
For this shrine is sure to drown
As the embers fill the air

Try to find some meaning in the mess
And came up dry but even though this world is bleak
You'll always be the waves upon the shore

They pulverize that common ground
When it's cracked beneath their feet
We all wait for the turnaround
Just a hopeless fantasy

Try to find some meaning in the mess
And came up dry but even though this world is bleak
I'll always be the waxwing at your door

Try to find some meaning in the mess
And came up dry but even though this world is bleak
You'll always be the one who I adore
Who I adore, I adore
