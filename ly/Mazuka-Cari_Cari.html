		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Colours of Timbuktu
In dry season without rain
No matter where you look to
By giants led astray

She tries to keep her pace
But where does it lead? nowhere.
Just keep on moving fast
In the night, push through

Covered in royal blue
Rambling on for days
No water where they took you
By bad crooks led astray

You try to get away
Didn't believe me babe
Just keep on moving fast
Into the black, push through - yeah

How does it feel?
Baby it is real
Seconds on the streets
Baby it is real

How does it feel?
Baby it is real
Seconds on the streets
Baby it is real
