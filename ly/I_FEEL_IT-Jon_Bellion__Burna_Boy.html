		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel it
You ain't got to say one word to me
One word, because I feel it
I feel it
I f-f-f-f-feel it

I feel it in your energy
When did my close friend just become an enemy?
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa
I feel it
I feel the heavy all around
If you feel it right there, maybe you should air that out
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa

We were young, now bliss doesn't come around
This is a way I feel and my heart, it can't take no more
'Cause all that I know is

I feel it
You ain't got to say one word to me
One word, because I feel it
I feel it
I f-f-f-f-feel it

You ain't got to say one word to me
One word, because I feel it
I feel it
I feel it
I feel it
I feel it

I feel the change in your energy
I see you got a lot of feelings that you're never telling me
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa
I feel it
So I guess it's silly me
I really thought we could be something
We could never, ever be
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa

We were young, now bliss doesn't come around
This is a way I feel and my heart, it can't take no more
'Cause all that I know is

I feel it
You ain't got to say one word to me
One word, because I feel it
I feel it
I f-f-f-f-feel it

You ain't got to say one word to me
One word, because I feel it
I feel it
I feel it
I feel it
I feel it (whoa, whoa, whoa)
I feel it (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
I feel it

I feel it
(I feel it, ooh, I feel it)
(Ooh, I feel it, ooh, I feel it) I feel it
Oh, I feel it

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 
I feel it
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Oh, I feel it
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 
I feel it
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 
I feel it
