		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They wish they had a love like this
Really wish they had a girl who they could fuck like this
Say they bout it but I really would'nt trust that shit
Get yourself someone who you can love like this
You can't trust a bitch no
You love me but it's complicated now
I've tried to keep you out of my mind
But everytime I see you we get loud
I only wanna see you all the time
We argue but we know were on the same side
I love you but I hate you at the same time
You know that you're my best friend when the suns out
But we go crazy when we're fucking in the moonlight
They wish they had a love like this
Really wish they had a girl who they could fuck like this
Say they bout it but I really would'nt trust that shit
Get yourself someone who you can love like this
You can't trust a bitch no
On another vibe living in a different time
Never doubted you even though I know it's different now
Fucking with my feelings they don't want me on the same side
Know you understand me we almost have the same mind
Always on the grind writing on another rhyme
Know you see me shining when they see me in a different light
Can't make sense of my own mind
But when I'm with you it feels right
They wish they had a love like this
Really wish they had a girl who they could fuck like this
Say they bout it but I really would'nt trust that shit
Get yourself someone who you can love like this
You can't trust a bitch no
They wish they had a love like this
Really wish they had a girl who they could fuck like this
Say they bout it but I really would'nt trust that shit
Get yourself someone who you can love like this
You can't trust a bitch no
