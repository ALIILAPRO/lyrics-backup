		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And when October goes
The snow begins to fly
Above the smoky roofs
I watch the planes go by

The children running home beneath
A twilight sky
Oh, for the fun of them
When I was one of them

And when October goes
The same old dream appears
And you are in my arms
To share the happy years
I turn my head away to hide 
The helpless tears
Oh, how I hate to see October go

And when October goes
The same old dream appears
And you are in my arms
To share the happy years
I turn my head away to hide 
The helpless tears
Oh, how I hate to see October go

I should be over it now, I know
It doesn't matter much how old I grow
I hate to see October go
