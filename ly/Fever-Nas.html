		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Early on the wake up
Cunning as the father of the twelve sons of Jacob
Shake up the world, cake crumbs
Cover my gold teeth, cufflinks, waiters
Lobster sauce on aprons
Pardon, that's the chef
Burgundy on the breath
Uncertainty when I step
Dancin' to every song like it's a contest
Singin' to Stevie Wonder Happy Birthday
Celebratin' years of flows and crazy wordplay
Season, I'm leaving my 40's, I'm a griot
Deep as Deepak Chopra
Dress socks and loafers
Family only, I'm holdin' hands with a cold piece
Bow to the old me, I'm officially OG
Might throw a roast me, wonder what will the jokes be
Watchin' 'em imitate my crude demeanor
It's a new decade, I'm in a whole new arena
Roll the dice in this life and I hit the fever
Get it

Wolf out of NYC
This is prophecy
Know this is meant to be
Evolve constantly
Half a century
Put your glasses up
Represent for me
Represent, represent
Represent for me
Represent, represent
Represent for me
Fly from infancy to half a century
Ah-ha, represent

Cryin' faces for the double agents watchin' my every move
Go tell em I can't sit still, I never do
Let them think of all the places I led them
Go look at it through an all age spectrum
Still winnin', never a better move
Who they claim to be today?
Man, they can never choose
We all got a set of tools we gotta use to push through
Like I did, and Esco is my nom de plume
Party in the penthouse, live
Fill all the rooms with beautiful vibes
That's the way to calm the goons
Champagne flutes, my cigars pop balloons
Bowties get untied when the clock hit 2
A '73 baby
I say a speech maybe
Besides the Littles and Joneses, hip-hop made me
Born in New York, I hope the most high keeps you
I wish at least fifty on all my good people
Fever

Wolf out of NYC
This is prophecy
Know this is meant to be
Evolve constantly
Half a century
Put your glasses up
Represent for me
Represent, represent
Represent for me
Represent, represent
Represent for me
Fly from infancy to half a century
Ah-ha, represent
