		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sun dims low the night crawls in
Something's in the air carried by the wind
Never fear but take my word
Listen to the screak of the mocking birds
Turmoil's in the air
Hold your breath be deadly calm
Make a final prayer
Don't forget what you have done

Run! Carried by the stroke of eagle wings
Run! Brave and reckless through the winter winds
Run! Straight ahead into the raging storm
Run away from dusk till dawn

Come to rest and cross your heart
Spirits of the past hiding in the dark
Scarlet skies obsess your path
Once you've gone away you can not come back
Turmoil's in the air
Hold your breath be deadly calm
Make a final prayer
Don't forget what you have done

Run! Carried by the stroke of eagle wings
Run! Brave and reckless through the winter winds
Run! Straight ahead into the raging storm
Run away from dusk till dawn

Look up to the sky
Save your breath and calm your heart
Clouds are passing by
For this is a world apart

Rush get away don't hunker down in silence
Panic boils the blood in your veins
Sound of the drums arising from the distance
Sudden angst takes over your brain
Rush get away the crimson moon will guide you
Evil cries pierce marrow and bone
Rage getting strong make haste for they will find you
Don't resign our time will come

Run! Carried by the stroke of eagle wings
Run! Brave and reckless through the winter winds
Run! Straight ahead into the raging storm
Run away from dusk till dawn

Run! Like a thunder roaring through the trees
Run! Bold and fearless to the stormy seas
Run! With the heavy rain upon your skin
Run away for life and limb
Look up to the sky
Save your breath and calm your heart
Clouds are passing by
For this is a world apart
