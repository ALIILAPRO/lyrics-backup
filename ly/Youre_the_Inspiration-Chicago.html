		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know our love was meant to be
The kind of love to last forever
And I want you here with me
From tonight until the end of time

You should know 
Everywhere I go
Always on my mind
In my heart, in my soul
Baby

You're the meaning in my life
You're the inspiration
You bring feeling to my life
You're the inspiration
Want to have you near me
I want to have you hear me saying
no one needs you more than I need you

And I know (and I know)
Yes I know that it's plain to see
So in love when we're together
now I know (now I know)
That I need you here with me
From tonight until the end of time

You should know (yes, you need to know)
Everywhere I go
Always on my mind
You're in my heart, in my soul

You're the meaning in my life
You're the inspiration
You bring feeling to my life
You're the inspiration
Want to have you near me
I want to have you hear me saying
no one needs you more than I need you (no one needs you more than I)

Want to have you near me
I want to have you hear me saying
no one needs you more than I need you (no one needs you more)

You're the meaning in my life
You're the inspiration
You bring feeling to my life
You're the inspiration

When you love somebody
'Til the end of time
When you love somebody
Always on my mind (no one needs you more than I)
When you love somebody
'Til the end of time
When you love somebody
Always on my mind (no on needs you more than I)
When you love somebody
'Til the end of time
When you love somebody
Always on my mind (no one needs you more than I)
