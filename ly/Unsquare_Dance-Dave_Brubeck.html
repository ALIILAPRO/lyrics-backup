		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Breaking rocks out here on the chain gang
Breaking rocks and serving my time
Breaking rocks out here on the chain gang
Because they done convicted me of crime

[Chorus]
Hold it steady right there while I hit it
Well, reckon that ought to get it
Been working and working
But I still got so terribly far to go

I committed crime, Lord, I needed
Crime of being hungry and poor
I left the grocery store man bleeding
When they caught me robbing his store

[Chorus]

I heard the judge say five years
On chain-gang you gonna go
I heard the judge say five years labor
I heard my old man scream "Lordy, no!"

[Chorus]

Gonna see my sweet honey bee
Gonna break this chain off to run
Gonna lay down somewhere shady
Lord, I sure am hot in the sun

Hold it right there while I hit it
Well reckon that ought to get it
Been workin' and workin'
Been workin' and slavin'
And workin' and workin'
But I still got so terribly far to go
