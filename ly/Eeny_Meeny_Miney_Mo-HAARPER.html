		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Man down, man down, man down hoe
Call an ambulance too late too slow
Tell me who next eeny meeny miney mo
Like
Man down, man down, man down hoe
Call an ambulance too late too slow
Gotcha girl in my ride and off we go 

Smash on a bish, she back on my dome
Gimme good head, we smash in ya home
Makin money bags, got the eyes of a crow
Go and fuck with the clique
Any luck Bitch? No
Everybody wanna go and get a feature
But I be striving on my own a different creature
Half breed, Urameshi fuck the teacher
Ms. Lee givin sucky during leisure
God damn bish
She put me in a coffin
Jerkin me off like girl are you amish? 
Take her to the barn, with the giddy up harness
I done seen the drapes but I felt no carpet
Smooth like butter; for the night she a queen
But when I get my nut I'm going back to the green
Back to the lab, going back to the scene 
Turn ya back to the team and getcha back to the beam

Man down, man down, man down hoe
Call an ambulance too late too slow
Tell me who next eeny meeny miney mo
Like
Man down, man down, man down hoe
Call an ambulance too late too slow
Gotcha girl in my ride and off we go
