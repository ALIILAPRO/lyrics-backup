		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One eye goes laughing
One eye goes crying
Through the trials and trying of one life
One hand is tied
One step gets behind
In one breath we're dying
Ah

I've been waiting for the sun to come up
Waiting for the showers to stop
Waiting for the penny to drop
One time

And I've been standing in a cloud of plans
Standing on the shifting sands
Hoping for an open hand
One time

One eye goes laughing
One eye goes crying
Through the trials and trying of one life
One hand is tied
One step gets behind
In one breath we're dying
Ah

I've been waiting for the sun to come up
Waiting for the showers to stop
Waiting for the penny to drop
One time

And I've been standing in a cloud of plans
Standing on the shifting sands
Hoping for an open hand
One time
