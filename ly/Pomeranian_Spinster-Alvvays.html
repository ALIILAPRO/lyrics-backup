		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't want to be nice
I don't wanna be nice
I don't want your advice
On the run in my tights
I wanna get what I want
I don't care who it hurts
Took the lessons that I've learnt
Once shy, twice burned

Don't wanna belong
I'm not nodding along
I don't care if you liked me
Please don't invite me

Hummingbird get what you want
And flutter off for a little while
Weight settled out on my doorstep
You took the four steps

Mine, should've been mine
Had I just said something
If I wasn't polite
Stuck out my hand grabbed it and ran
And you wouldn't have accosted
All according to the plan

Don't wanna belong
I'm not nodding along
I don't care if I'm wrong, you unfortunate boy
You've gone AWOL

Hummingbird get what you want
And flutter off to a different flower
Wait's up and the light's out
You took that ride out

Mine, should have been mine
Had I just said nothing
If I wasn't polite
Stuck out my hand, grabbed it and ran
And you're looking that forward
When you're looking to the plan

Woke up in the rain
Woke up in a sweat
Now you're living in a condo and you wanna forget

There was a time
When someone could've said
You can't recreate
All the things that are read

Pomeranian spinster
Glass slipper never fit
It took a while but I'm trying to get over it
Presbyterian ministers
Travel in packs and never split
They deviate in the tiniest concepts (la la la)

I heard you ask me to smile
Detour right off of the road
Don't ever ask me to smile
Which dress is she going to wear?
What's to be done with her hair?
Don't ever ask me to smile

You'll spend the rest of your days
Taking your foot off the brake
Foot on the brake foot on the
