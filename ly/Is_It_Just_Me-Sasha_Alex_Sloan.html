		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it just me?
Is it just me?

I hate holding babies
And people tryna save me
Think religion is a business
Where you pay for God's forgiveness
Modern art is boring
Politicians are annoying
I don't think love lasts forever
And old music was better

Am I just high or am I kinda right?

Is it just me or does anybody
Feel the way that I feel?
They're just not being real
Tell me, is it just me or is anybody
Thinking all the same shit?
They're just not saying it
Or is it just me?

(Is it just me?)
Is it just me?
(Is it just me?)

Weddings are outdated
The show Friends was overrated
I think rich kids have it easy
And PDA is creepy
The Internet's obnoxious
People my age make me nauseous
I think marijuana's classy
And doing coke is trashy

Am I just high or am I kinda right?

Is it just me or does anybody
Feel the way that I feel?
They're just not being real
Tell me, is it just me or is anybody
Thinking all the same shit?
They're just not saying it
Or is it just me?

(Is it just me?)
Is it just me?
(Is it just me?)

I should probably bite my tongue, but
I can't be the only one, yeah
I should probably bite my tongue, but
I can't be the only one

Oh, is it just me or does anybody
Feel the way that I feel?
They're just not being real
Tell me, is it just me or is anybody
Thinking all the same shit?
They're just not saying it
Or is it just me?

(Is it just me?)
Is it just me?
(Is it just me?)

I should probably bite my tongue, but
I can't be the only one, yeah
I should probably bite my tongue, but
I can't be the only one
