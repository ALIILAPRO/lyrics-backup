		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just a thought
To add suspense
To all the games
Of discontent

Fear is real
But not self-taught
You let others
Be the cause

There we go racing towards the sun
Ignoring all the noise
Striving for the grace of man
People play this great charade
And always miss the point
Never fall for prophecies

You say it draws near
That it will be clear
You act so convinced
A fortress you've built
Remember the doubt
By which I now stand
You write the book
On the way it all ends

Tear down
Those mighty walls
Reinvent
The way you talk

Look ahead
Not down below
Or high above
Where angels flow

There we go racing towards the sun
Ignoring all the noise
Striving for the grace of man
People play this great charade
And always miss the point
Never fall for prophecies

Waiting to see
Our kind disagree
You draw the line
And stick to your pride
Remember the doubt
By which I now stand
You write the book
On the wayâ€¦

It ends

(Solo: Kragen)
(Solo: Vince)
(Solo: Kragen)

You say it draws near
That it will be clear
You act so convinced
A fortress you've built
Remember the doubt
By which I now stand
You wrote the book
On the way it all ends

It ends
