		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, help me Dr. Buzz
I'm gonna mend the world tonight
'Til it's shining bright
Ooh, I can't take it Dr. Buzz
I'm caught up in catastrophe
Tell me why it hurts so much

Maybe the flowers laying in the street
And of the sisters weeping at your feet
Shutdown, it's a sure sign of the times
You have to wonder where the money's gone
It all depends what side of town you're from
Cut down, baby, we're cut down in out prime

Ooh, help me Dr. Buzz
I'm gonna mend the world tonight
'Til it's shining bright
Ooh, I can't take it Dr. Buzz
I'm caught up in catastrophe
Tell me why it hurts so much

It's like a scene from A Few Dollars More
There's more to this than settling a score
Annie, go get your gun, it's getting wild
And in the jungles of America
Another sheriff with a lone star
Can't seem to remember I'm just a child
Man, the west is getting so wild

Ooh, I can't take it Dr. Buzz
The street, it's got a hold on me
Tell me why it hurts so much

If you cross my street, I'll tell you, there'll be hell to pay
Can't you see the colours painted on the wall?
Don't you recognize me baby, in my mercury
You're the problem that I've really got to solve
I took 'em down now

Now you're happy that you're meeting Dr. Buzz again
He'll help you take your head to somewhere else
All you ever do when you get home is cry alone
Dr. Buzz can help you try to help yourself self, self, self, self, self, self, self, self, self, self

Can you feel me?
Can you feel me?
Can you feel me?
Can you feel me?
Can you feel me?
Can you feel me?
This drink got a hold on me
Can you feel me?
Can you feel me?
Oh, can you feel me?
This drink got a hold on me
'Cause it's hands up, don't shoot
Hands up, don't shoot
