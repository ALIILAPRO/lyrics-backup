		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every day I wake and
Everything is broken
Turnin' off my phone just to get out of bed
Get home every evening
And history's repeating
Turning off my phone 'cause it's hurting my chest
Aye

And heaven knows I'm not helpless, yeah
But what can I do?
I can't see the use in me crying
If I'm not even tryna make the change I wanna see

I can't sit and hope, I
Can't just sit and pray, that
I can find a love, when
All I see is pain
Falling to my knees
And though I do believe
I can't just preach, baby, preach
Whoa, oh
I can't just preach, baby, preach

All I hear is voices
Everybody's talking
Nothing real is happening, 'cause nothing is new
Now when all is tragic
And I just feel sedated
Why do I feel numb? Is that all I can do? Yeah

And heaven knows I'm not helpless, yeah
But I'm only human
I can't see the use in me crying
If I'm not even tryna make the change I wanna see

I can't sit and hope, I
Can't just sit and pray, that
I can find a love, when
All I see is pain
Falling to my knees
And though I do believe (though I do believe)
I can't just preach, baby, preach
Whoa, oh
I can't just preach, baby, preach

And heaven knows I'm not helpless
But what can I do? Yea
Can't see the use in me crying
If I'm not even tryna make the change I wanna see

I can't sit and hope, I
Can't just sit and pray, that
I can find a love, when
All I see is pain
I try to do the things, I
Say that I believe (I do believe)
I can't just preach, baby, preach
Whoa, oh
I can't just preach, baby, preach
Whoa, oh
I can't just preach, baby, preach

Fallin' to my knees
And though I do believe
I can't just preach, baby, preach
