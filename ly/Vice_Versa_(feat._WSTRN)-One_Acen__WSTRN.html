		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pretty girl, Lord have mercy
She said she with her friend Kirsty
Hypnotised me, yeah she cursed me
Dem no like me 'cause they thirsty
And she know what is mine is hersa, vice versa
And she know what is mine is hersa, vice versa

Yeah
You're my fire, hold him tighter
What is mine is hersa, vice versa
I believe, I believe you're the only one for me
I believe, I believe

Hey, dem way there
I ain't gonna stop on the M way there
Cut through the lane when the M ways clear
Would you do the same? Babe please say yeah
On my grind, a lot of money on my mind
And I got a bag girls on my line
But I told them other hoes boom bye bye

'Cause my love for you is timeless
Precious items
Diamonds don't compare

You're my fire, hold him tighter
What is mine is hersa, vice versa
I believe, I believe you're the only one for me
I believe, I believe

Yo, check me?
I believe, I believe, I believe
Big chefers ain't the only thing I've got up my sleeve
Mama mi, mama mi, mami mi
She said me too and backed out a rabbit
Stop ramping with me, I believe
Come hop on the saddle, buckle up please
Andale, undisputed truth I'm what you need
Follow me, follow me, follow me
Follow my lead
Girl do you believe that my love for you is timeless?
You're fine yeah, I might just apply pressure
You a diamond, so shine gal you're the brightest

You're my fire, hold him tighter
What is mine is hersa, vice versa
I believe, I believe you're the only one for me
I believe, I believe

Pretty girl, Lord have mercy
She said she with her friend Kirsty
Hypnotised me, yeah she cursed me
Dem no like me 'cause they thirsty
And she know what is mine is hersa, vice versa
She ride, she surfer
She like me versa
She cruise in my Mercedes
Whine one time for me baby

You're my fire, hold him tighter
What is mine is hersa, vice versa
I believe, I believe you're the only one for me
I believe, I believe

How many are cattin' to take my place if I disrespected you?
I guess we'll never know
'Cause my love for you is timeless
Precious items
Diamonds don't compare
