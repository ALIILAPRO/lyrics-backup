		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a time, to remember
It's a time, we have to believe
It's a time, to surrender
To someone that your heart really needs.

I need you
I need you
I really need you
I need you
I need you

It's the season to wonder
Wonder why time has turned to move on
As my love grows stronger
I hope it's strong enough just to go

I love you
I need you
Along to you
I need you
You uh

Now along to you  
I need you
Get along to you
I need you
Get along to you
I need you
Get along to you
I need you.
