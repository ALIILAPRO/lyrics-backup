		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I'm feelin' blue
All I have to do is take a look at you
Then I'm not so blue
When you're close to me
I can feel you heart beat
I can hear you breathing in my ear

Wouldn't you agree
Baby, you and me got a groovy kind of love

Any time you want to
You can turn me on to
Anything you want to
Any time at all
When I kiss your lips
Oh, I start to shiver
Can't control the quivering inside

Wouldn't you agree
Baby, you and me got a groovy kind of love

When I'm feelin' blue
All I have to do is take a look at you
Then I'm not so blue
When I'm in your arms
Nothing seems to matter
My whole world could shatter, I don't care

Wouldn't you agree
Baby, you and me got a groovy kind of love
We got a groovy kind of love
We got a groovy kind of love, oh wow
We got a groovy kind of love
