		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (w/ Cliff Richard)

I've had many times, I can tell you
Times when innocence I'd trade for company
And children saw me crying
I thought I'd had my share of that
But these miss you nights
Are the longest

Midnight diamonds (midnight diamonds)
Stud my heaven (stud my heaven)
Southward burning
Lie the jewels that eye my place
And the warm winds (and the warm winds)
That embrace me (that embrace me)
Just as surely kissed your face
Yeah these miss you nights
They're the longest

(How I missed you) How I missed you
I'm not likely to tell
I'm a man
And cold day light buys the pride I'd rather sell
(All my secrets) All my secrets
Are a wasted affair
You know them well

Thinking of my going
How to cut the thread
And leave it all behind
Looking windward for my compass
I take each day as it arrives
But these miss you nights
Are the longest

(Lay down) Lay down all thoughts of your surrender
It's only me who's killing time
(Lay down) Lay down all dreams and themes once remembered
It's just the same
This miss you game

Yeah these miss you nights
