		  [Intro]
Today we get to wrestle with another really serious question
If someone commits suicide
Is it true that they will not make it to heaven?
*laughing*, Original God

[Chorus]
In the distance I hear a cry for help
Can I still go to heaven if I kill myself?
'Cause surely nobody wants to go to hell
But the closer I get the less I hear the yells
The sweet aroma of death is his favorite smell
Would it make a difference if I had a soul to sell?
Too many questions and no time to dwell
Can I still go to heaven if I kill myself?
In the distance I hear a cry for help
Can I still go to heaven if I kill myself?
'Cause surely nobody wants to go to hell
But the closer I get the less I hear the yells
The sweet aroma of death is his favorite smell
Would it make a difference if I had a soul to sell?
Too many questions and no time to dwell
Can I still go to heaven if I kill myself?

[Bridge]
God has his headphones too loud
The life of a dog or an entire crowd
I was told sinners were not even allowed
Even allowed
Even allowed
Even allowed
Is food nothing more than slaughtered cows ?
Is it still my life if the point is to make another proud?
Before I make this choice, please tell me where art thou?
Tell me where art thou?
Tell me where art thou?
Tell me where art thou?

[Chorus]
In the distance I hear a cry for help
Can I still go to heaven if I kill myself?
'Cause surely nobody wants to go to hell
But the closer I get the less I hear the yells
The sweet aroma of death is his favorite smell
Would it make a difference if I had a soul to sell?
Too many questions and no time to dwell
Can I still go to heaven if I kill myself?

[Outro]
If I kill myself
If I fucking kill
Death
