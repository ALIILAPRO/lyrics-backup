		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

Here she comes again
She's feeling like she's already won
I believe it's gonna end again, all for naught

My philosophy is things are just as wrong as they seem
I believe it's gonna end this way, atrocity
Do you believe in love
Like I believe in pain
Nobody died for you, somebody pray for me

When you see me cut me down
And I will force it underground
There's no-one left to hurt but me
And it's because of me, right?

There he walks away
He's feeling like he's having them on
I believe he's gonna bend again
And all for naught

My philosophy is things are just as wrong as they seem
Gotta get you off, off of me, it's such an oddity
Do you believe in love
Like I believe in pain
Nobody died for you, somebody pray for me

When you see me cut me down
And I will force it underground
There's no-one left to hurt but me
And it's because of me, right?

I want to see you suffer

Suffer

When you see me cut me down
And I will force it underground
There's no-one left to hurt but me
And it's because of me, right?

When you see me cut me down
And when you see me cut me down
And when you see me cut me down
And it's because of me

Suffer
