		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm independent to a fault
I know this well
But I finally found love
Without losing myself
I'm so much happier sharing my life
All of the good things and bad things alike
I'm not afraid of the truth
I'm not me without you

Because of you I'm me
All of sudden I'm something I wasn't
Because of you I see
Everything I can be, lonely as history
I know that I'm better when we're together
Because of you I'm me

Well, there's nothing wrong with the world
Oh, when you smile
The most beautiful sound I've ever heard
Is you breathing at night
When you're sleeping don't know I can hear
Sounds like an angel whispering in my ear
I don't know what I would do, if it wasn't for you

Because of you I'm me
All of sudden I'm something I wasn't
Because of you I see
Everything I can be, lonely as history 
I know I'm better when we're together
Because of you I'm me

I don't need you the way a child needs a home
Is more like I am free to
Admit I'm not too proud to say out loud
I'm who I am 'cause you're part of me now

Because of you I'm me
All of sudden I'm something I wasn't
Because of you I see
Everything I can be, lonely as history
I know that I'm better when we're together
Because of you I'm me
Oh, because of you I'm me
