		  (Control with us)
Let's roll

Do we control?
Can we control?
'Cause where we come through you're gonna fall
Let's roll
Can we control?
Control
Trust your life trust yourself
Trust your life trust yourself
Trust your life within move your life within
Change your life when we take control

Do we control?
Can we control?
'Cause where you come through you're gonna fall
Do we control?
Can we control?

'Cause where we come through you're gonna fall
'Cause where we come through you're gonna fall
'Cause where we come through you're gonna fall
Let's roll

Can we control?
Can we control?
He said control with us he said control with us
Let's roll

Do we control?
Can we control?
'Cause where we come through you're gonna fall
Do we control?
Can we control?
'Cause where we come through we're gonna fall
'Cause where we come through you're gonna fall
'Cause where we come through you're gonna fall
