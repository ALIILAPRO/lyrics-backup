		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If we run away
We could get lost
If we do escape
Before were caught

We should run now, baby, run
Run, run (run, run)
Run, run (run, run)
We should run now, baby, run
Run, run
Run
We should run now, baby, run

Don't look back
We should run now, baby, run
Don't look back
We should run now, baby, run

We should run now, baby, run
We should run now, baby, run

Don't look back
We should run now, baby, run
Don't look back
We should run now, baby, run

Just run (just run)
Keep running (just run)
Keep running (just run)
Just run (just run)
Keep running (just run)
Keep running (just run)

Ooh yeah, hmm

(Run, run)
Run
(Run, run)
Run
Ah

Don't look back
We should run now, baby, run
Don't look back
We should run now, baby, run

Run

Don't look back
We should run now, baby, run
Don't look back
We should run now, baby, run

Don't look back
Don't
Don't look back
Don't
We should run now, baby, run
