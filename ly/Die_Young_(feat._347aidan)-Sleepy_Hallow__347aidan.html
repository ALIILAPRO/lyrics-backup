		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lookin' through my memories, fallin' into jealousy
How can I miss you? You're really just my enemy
Breakin' apart, but I gotta hold my legacy
And I don't wanna die- (Great John on the beat by the way)
I don't-I don't wanna die young and-

Ayy, I don't wanna die young, so I stay with a stick
Still on that shit, fuck two times six
Forgot who I was, let me talk my shit, like
Sturdiana
Buss a move when I get up behind ya
Shorty bad, she get it from her mama
I do what I do and she do what she wanna
That's a fact, ain't no cap
Me and Sheff had to run up them racks
If you miss then we doublin' back
2018, I was stuck in the trap
Fell in love and I got too attached
Heart got broke, it ain't no comin' back
If you up it, ain't no comin' back
Fuck with my opps, it ain't no comin' back
Is you with it?
If you up it, I up it, let's get it
Sleepy ain't feel no love in a minute
But fuck it 'cause I ain't been broke in a minute
And your bitch hit me up said she just wanna fuck
'Cause she ain't feel the strokes in a minute
You know me, I be hittin' it different
So you can't get her back when I'm finished
So you can't get her-
When I'm cookin,' I'm not in the kitchen
I'm probably somewhere outta town doin' business
So, I'm sorry if I couldn't kick it
I got attached, so I had to go missin'
Said she love me that's part of my mission
Niggas be fake, gotta keep 'em at distance
Baby stop all that trippin', you should just listen
Three words, my body different

So I'm lookin' through my memories, fallin' into jealousy
How can I miss you? You're really just my enemy (ayy)
Breakin' apart, but I gotta hold my legacy
And I don't wanna die-
I don't-I don't wanna die young and-

I don't wanna die young that might make mama crazy
No ocean, I'm too wavy
No therapy could save me
Took L's, been winnin' lately
Locked in ain't no escapin'
Sometimes I get impatient
Mask on, no face no, cases
Yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fall back, baby, I gotta breath
Fear nobody, I'm ready to bleed
And she for the streets, she not for me
From a place where they never believe
In the hood, thought I never would leave
Like, what would you do if you run into me?
Grab the choppa and you better squeeze
Had no knockers, he bob and he weave
If I go better follow my lead
I still make it hot, like a hunnid degrees
Show no love 'cause it's hard to receive
You seen what I seen then you'd probably agree
Cops and robbers, I'm playin' the thief
And mama told me not to play in these streets
It's too late 'cause I'm playin' for keeps

So I'm lookin' through my memories, fallin' into jealousy
How can I miss you? You're really just my enemy 
Breakin' apart, but I gotta hold my legacy (I don't wanna die young)
And I don't wanna die
I don't-I don't wanna die young and- (I don't wanna die young) 

So I'm lookin' through my memories, fallin' into jealousy
How can I miss you? You're really just my enemy 
Breakin' apart, but I gotta hold my legacy (I don't wanna die young)
And I don't wanna die
I don't-I don't wanna die young and-

Damn
So I'm-
Damn
I don't wanna die young and-
So I'm-
