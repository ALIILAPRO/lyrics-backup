		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So leave your taxi waiting
And turn and close my door
And sit back down where you were sitting
A little closer than before

And when you look that serious
It just makes me want you more
And I've been meaning to tell you

The closer you get, the better I feel
The closer you are, the more I see
Why everyone says that I look happier when you're around
The closer you get, the better I feel

And yes I know you're nervous
Never seen you so unsure
You haven't touched your food, tonight
And you're drinking more and more

And there's no need to hurry
Take your time I'll still be here
And I've been meaning to tell you

The closer you get, the better I feel
The closer you are, the more I see
Why everyone says that I look happier when you're around
The better I feel

The closer you get, the better you see
The closer you are, the more I see
Why everyone says that I look happier when you're around
The closer you get, the better I feel
The better I feel

We've been circling for time baby
We're coming down to land tonight
The wait is over and now it's easy
Everything's fine

The closer you get, the better I feel
The closer you are, the more I see
Why everyone says that I look happier
When you're around, the better I feel

The closer you get, the better you see
The closer you are, the more I see
Why everyone says that I look happier when you're around
The closer you get, the better I feel
