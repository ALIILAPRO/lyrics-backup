		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "This is for any of you who knows anyone whose lost anyone.  
This is a song about Wendy by a friend of ours named Andy Prieboy
Of all the voodoo
This is a song about a woman with AIDS,
Which someone in this room has, A few of these people in this room has.
And you'll go through it and you'll know and we should stop it
This is for Wendy"

It is complete now
2 ends of time are neatly tied
A one way street
She's walking to the end of the line
And there she meets
Faces she see's in her heart and mind
They say,
Good Try
Tomorrow Wendy is going to die.
Tomorrow Wendy is going to die.

Underneath the chilly gray November sky
We can make believe that Kennedy is
Still alive and
We're shooting for the moon and 
Smiling Jackies drivin' by
They say,
Good Try
Tomorrow Wendy is going to die.
Tomorrow Wendy is going to die.

I told the priest
Don't count on any second coming
God got his ass kicked the first time
He came down here slumming.
He had the balls to come
The gall to die and then forgive us
No I don't wonder why I wonder what
He thought it would get us
Yeah, goodbye tomorrow Wendy is going to die.

Only God says jump
But I set the time
'cause if he ever saw it
It  was through these eyes of mine
And if he ever suffered 
It was me who did his crying
Yeah goodbye
Tomorrow Wendy is going to die.
