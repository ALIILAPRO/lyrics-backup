		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hangin' 'round downtown by myself
And I had so much time to sit and think about myself
And then there she was, like double cherry pie
Yeah, there she was
Like disco super-fly

I smell sex and candy here, mmm
Who's that lounging in my chair? Mmm
Who's that casting devious stares in my direction?
Mama, this surely is a dream, yeah
Yeah, mama, this surely is a dream, dig it

Hangin' 'round downtown by myself
And I've had too much caffeine, and I was thinkin' 'bout myself
And then there she was, in platform double suede
Yeah, there she was
Like disco lemonade

I smell sex and candy here, mmm
Who's that lounging in my chair? Mmm
Who's that casting devious stares in my direction?
Mama, this surely is a dream, yeah
Yeah, mama, this surely is a dream, dig it
Yeah, mama, this surely is a dream, yeah

I smell sex and candy here, mmm
Who's that lounging in my chair? Mmm
Who's that casting devious stares in my direction?
Mama, this surely is a dream, yeah
Yeah, mama, this surely is a dream, dig it
Yeah, mama, this surely is a dream, yeah
Yeah, mama, this must be my dream
