		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have a memory
Of a time and place where history resigned
Now my apology
All the light came in to fulminate my mind

Reach out, reach out
To all the ones who came before you
Ponder what is right
You and I, in defiance
Speak out, speak out
The conversation may afford you
Wisdom of the wise
You and I, in defiance

And I come from conscience where there is no conjugation
I would rather be a flower than the ocean
And I held myself as something of an innovation
I would rather be devoured than be broken

All my life, I tried so hard
To separate myself from all
That is and was and will be torn apart
You were running unafraid
I know you, but I've changed my way
You know I take it all to heart

Home is where you've called my name
I've gone as far as the eye can blame
You said love may have lost its way

Now my life has been erased
And what I gave, I gave for you
And for myself and for the holy name
You were running unashamed
And yours is mine and all remains
As nothing ever stays the same

Reach out, reach out to all the ones who came before you
Reach out, reach out to all the ones who came before you
Reach out, reach out, and all at once, the pain restores you
Reach out, reach out, and all at once, the pain restores you
All at once, the pain restores you

I have a memory of a time and place where history resigned
Now in my reverie
For the guiding light that opened up my mind
