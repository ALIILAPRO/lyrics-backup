		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wishing away all the days 'til I see you again
I don't wanna wait, feels like it'll never end

I miss the way your voice goes up and down
There's something about you I like being around

Don't wanna waste
My time
Just wanna spend
My time right
Don't wanna waste
My time
Since you've been on my mind

(I just wanna)
I just wanna 
(I just wanna)
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna

Wishing away all the days until we reach the end
I don't wanna wait, I just wanna start over again

I miss the way I felt when you were gone
(I miss the way that I felt when you were gone)
There's something about this that's gone on too long

Don't wanna waste
My time
I just wanna spend
My time right
Don't wanna waste
My time
Since you've been on my mind

(I just wanna)
(I just wanna)
(I just wanna)
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna 
(I just wanna)
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna 
(I just wanna)

Wishing away all the days 'til I see you again
I just wanna 
(I just wanna)
I don't wanna wait, I just wanna start over again
I just wanna
(I just wanna)
I just wanna
(I just wanna)
I just wanna 
(I just wanna)
