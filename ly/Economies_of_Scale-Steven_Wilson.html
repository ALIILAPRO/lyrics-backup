		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Black freighter regale
Is lost in fog
Moving testament
To all that's lost

And I try to close my palm

Don't stumble (don't stumble)
Don't idle (don't idle)
God willing we'll get through this
Just more things that won't be missed

(Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)
(Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)
(Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)
(Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)
(Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)

Economy
Economy of scale led to (economy of scale led to)
Economy
Economy of scale led to (economy of scale led to)
Economy
Economy of scale led to (economy of scale led to)
Economy
Economy of scale led to (economy of scale led to)
Economy
Economy of scale led to (economy of scale led to)
Economy
Economy of scale led to (economy of scale led to)
Economy
Economy of scale led to (economy of scale led to)
Economy
Economy of scale led to (economy of scale led to)
Economy (uh-uh-uh)

(Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)
(Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)

An evening in decline
A cigarette unwinds (unwinds)
One moment just passes through
All time leaves is me and you
