		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want you so hard
I want you so good
But can you trust me?
Yes, you know you could
My friends are talkin'
And they're tellin' you

Don't waste your time 'cause the boy's bad news

My friends are talkin'
And they're tellin' you

Just leave him alone 'cause the boy's bad news

I want you so hard
I want you so good
Now take a chance, momma
You know you should
Trust your instincts and let me in
Just be my ride and I'll be my friend
My friends are talkin'
And they're tellin' you

You're wastin' your time, the boy's bad news

My friends are talkin'
And they're tellin' you

Leave him alone, 'cause it's just bad news

I want you so hard
I want you so good
But can you trust me?
Yes, you know you could
Trust your instincts and let me in
Just be my ride and I'll be my friend
My friends are talkin'
And they're tellin' you

Don't waste your time 'cause the boy's bad news

My friends are talkin'
And they're tellin' you

Just leave him alone 'cause the boy's bad news

Bad news
Ooh, the boy's bad news
Ooh, the boy's bad news
Ooh, the boy's bad news
Ooh, the boy's bad news
Ooh, the boy's bad news
Ooh, the boy's bad news
Ooh, the boy's bad news
Ooh, the boy's bad news
Ooh, the boy's bad news
Ooh, the boy's bad news
Ooh, the boy's bad news
Ooh, the boy's bad news
Ooh, the boy's bad news
