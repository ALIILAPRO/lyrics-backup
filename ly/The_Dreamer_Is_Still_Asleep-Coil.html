		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hush, may I ask you all for silence?
The dreamer is still asleep
May the goddess keep us from single vision
And Newton's sleep

The dreamer is still asleep
The dreamer is still asleep
He's inventing landscapes in their magnetic field
Working out a means of escape
We'll cut across the crop circles

The seer says no
Not much time left for these escape attempts
Look at it this way
In ten years' time
Who'll care? Who'll even remember?
One dies like that, deep within it
Almost inside it
It's there for a reason

I'll give you my old address
And take that little book
To tear and cut the paper

The beginning is also the end
Time defines it, time defines it
It will end
Like close friendship
Nothing could be further
We forget the space between people and things
Is empty
We forget, and don't notice the loss

Pressing into venerable degeneration
Such radiant pollution
The god with the silver hand surveys this vast contamination
The dreamer is still dreaming
The dreamer is still dreaming

In the heart of your heart
Your eye remains
Is that hurt you? Is that blister you call loveless?
Your whole life is a cold slow shock
Your whole life is a cold slow shock

Take all your time
Track the shabby shadow down
Through hissing mists of history

The dreamer is still dreaming
The dreamer is still dreaming

Hush, may I ask you all for silence?
Will he wake in time to catch the sunset?
Hush, may I ask you all for silent?
May I ask you all for silent?
