		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Chew me up then spit me out
Then leave me lyin' on the ground
A low-blow even for you
Paranoid, you're in my head
You're in my blood and when I'm dead
You'll probably dig my grave up too

My stupid heart was in your hands
You used me like your cigarettes
Then you stomped me out in your checkered Vans
Damn, what the hell happened?

I'd say I should've known, I should've known better
That you're a backstabber
But how could I have known?
Behind your grey coat your words were made of daggers
And cherry lip smacker, lip smacker (mwah)

I'm just gonna hold my breath
'Cause all you do is make me sick
You even ruined air for me
You ruined parking lots and movie snacks
And photo booths, imagine that
I guess no more souvenirs from parties

My stupid heart was in your hands
You used me like your cigarettes
Then you stomped me out in your checkered Vans
Damn, what the hell happened?

I'd say I should've known, I should've known better
That you're a backstabber
But how could I have known?
Behind your grey coat your words were made of daggers
And cherry lip smacker, lip smacker (mwah)

I swear you exist just to spite me
I'm your cigarette, so gaslight me
In your checkered Vans straight out the 90s
Really put me out, really put me out, put me

I swear you exist just to spite me
I'm your cigarette, so gaslight me
In your checkered Vans straight out the 90s
Really put me out, really put me out, put me

My stupid heart was in your hands
You used me like your cigarettes
Then you stomped me out in your checkered Vans
Damn, what the hell happened?

I'd say I should've known, I should've known better
That you're a backstabber
But how could I have known?
Behind your grey coat your words were made of daggers
And cherry lip smacker
