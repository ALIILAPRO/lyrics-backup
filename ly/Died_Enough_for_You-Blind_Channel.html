		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (This is where we fall apart)
(This is where I'm giving up)

From a kiss
To the lips
To a razor to the wrist
I need a fix
Old dogs don't learn new tricks
I get fucked up and I trip
I find hope in the abyss
Don't cry for this
It's just apocalypse
Ay

You bring your issues
I bring the tissues
You bring your bad news
I bring the booze
You're self-destructive
I'm not in the mood
I'm saying, "Fuck this, I've died enough for you"
I've died enough for you

I've died enough for you
This is where we fall apart
This is where I'm giving up
I'm getting out, I'm signing off
I'm done with you
So go and mend your broken heart
'Cause this is where I'm giving up
I'm getting out, I'm signing off
I've died enough for you

To the moon and back
Then you stabbed me in the back
And it's you who's sad
See the irony in that
I'm waving a white flag
I see red, then I see black
No, don't be sad
Forever never lasts

Treat me like a game
I show you how it's played
Go tell your mama, "All men are the same"
I was addicted but here comes the truth
I'm not a quitter but I've died enough for you

This is where we fall apart
This is where I'm giving up
I'm getting out, I'm signing off
I'm done with you
So go and mend your broken heart
'Cause this is where I'm giving up
I'm getting out, I'm signing off
I've died enough for you
I've died enough for you

I've died enough for you

This is where we fall apart
This is where I'm giving up

You bring your issues
I bring the tissues
You bring your bad news
This is where we fall apart
You're self-destructive
I'm not in the mood
I'm saying, "Fuck this, I've died enough for you"

This is where we fall apart
This is where I'm giving up
I'm getting out, I'm signing off
I'm done with you
So go and mend your broken heart
'Cause this is where I'm giving up
I'm getting out, I'm signing off
I've died enough for you
