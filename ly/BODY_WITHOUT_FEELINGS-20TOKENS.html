		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm just a body without feelings
Crash crash crash crash crash my being
Things get worse, like endless sickness
Fuck fuck fuck it seems I'm sleeping

I'm just a body without feelings
Crash crash crash crash my existence
Things get worse, like endless sickness
Fuck fuck fuck it seems I'm sleeping

Take all my reasons to live
Turn all my dreams to nightmares
I don't feel anything real
Life has become one big snare

And if u heard something bad
Something bad about me, for sure
Just believe in this shit and
Leave me alone

I'm just a body without feelings
Crash crash crash crash crash my being
Things get worse, like endless sickness
Fuck fuck fuck it seems I'm sleeping

I'm just a body without feelings
Crash crash crash crash my existence
Things get worse, like endless sickness
Fuck fuck fuck it seems I'm sleeping

Nothingness is my best friend
Close my curtains
Before I fail everything again

I'm just a body without feelings
Crash crash crash crash crash my being
Things get worse, like endless sickness
Fuck fuck fuck it seems I'm sleeping

I'm just a body without feelings
Crash crash crash crash my existence
Things get worse, like endless sickness
Fuck fuck fuck it seems I'm sleeping
