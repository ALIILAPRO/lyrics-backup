		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh

Well, your daddy don't care
He just wants to see you happy, yeah
And your sister don't mind 
Kind of think she even likes me, yeah
And to me it's so important
Your family supports our love
'Cause I kind of plan on starting a family of our own

But your mama don't like me much
I wish she wouldn't judge
This book by its cover
That's covered in dust
'Cause in between the pages
Is a tale of love so true
That my evil past has faded
And when it comes to you

I'm just an angel with tattoos
I'm an angel with tattoos

I would never do you wrong
Even though I've done wrong before
And I don't blame her for trying to protect her baby boy
At least we got that much in common
We're always gonna put you first
You're the apple of her eye
You're the center of my universe

But your mama don't like me much
I wish she wouldn't judge
This book by its cover
That's covered in dust
'Cause in between the pages
Is a tale of love so true
That my evil past has faded
And when it comes to you

I'm just an angel with tattoos
Ah, oh, oh
Ah

Feels like I'm born again
Feels like I'm born again

But your mama don't like me much
I wish she wouldn't judge
This book by its cover
That's covered in dust
'Cause in between the pages
Is a tale of love so true
That my evil past has faded
And when it comes to you

I'm just an angel with tattoos
Oh, I'm an angel with tattoos
(I don't know)
