		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Swim laps 'round my swimming pool and
The water holds me just like you do
No white noise when I go under
I think I'm starting to feel better

I've got one more day
Driving 'round LA
Miss you when I'm done
You're my favorite sun

I wish I knew you before I knew you
Nobody loves me the way that you do
Wish we were friends when we were kids
I think it'd still feel just like this

I just can't stop missing you
When it gets late in my hotel room
Tell me what time you're coming through
Why did I get so hooked on you
Just can't stop missing you
When it gets late in my hotel room
Tell me what time you're coming through
Why did I get so hooked on you

Big blue house with a yellow door and
We can stay inside until we get bored
You hate everyone as much as I do
I think that's why I like you

I've got one more night
Leave me high and dry
Wherever you go
I'm already home

I wish I knew you before I knew you
Nobody loves me the way that you do
Wish we were friends when we were kids
I think it'd still feel just like this

I just can't stop missing you
When it gets late in my hotel room
Tell me what time you're coming through
Why did I get so hooked on you
Just can't stop missing you
When it gets late in my hotel room
Tell me what time you're coming through
Why did I get so hooked on you

Every time I'm going out
Doesn't matter who's around
I'm just looking for you now
Every time I take a breath
It's like a knife inside my chest
Still I love you to death

I wish I knew you before I knew you
Nobody loves me the way that you do
Wish we were friends when we were kids
I think it'd still feel just like this

I just can't stop missing you
When it gets late in my hotel room
Tell me what time you're coming through
Why did I get so hooked on you
Just can't stop missing you
When it gets late in my hotel room
Tell me what time you're coming through
Why did I get so hooked on you
