		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I navigate the dark
I bow before the flame I have deserted
Step off the map and let it go
Then focus on the fade

Stillness of the day
Renewal was the death of my ambition

To get higher
I have to go so low

Sold my worth
Made time for it
While I waited for something lasting
Until you would come running my way
To stay
But what does it matter now
It's the winter of our passing
Sold my trust
And my love too

Disregard the soul
Heart is made of mist
And still it's thinning
Bad news for you is we are fucked
And you don't know where we're heading next

The feeling that did remain
If we take some time to remember it
The feeling of what was good
Do you recall it at all
