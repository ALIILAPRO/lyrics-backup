		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I knew this would never work
Thought about it in New York
I was lyin' on the bedroom floor
Think I just can't do this anymore (oh-oh)
We tried our best to make it through (oh-oh-oh)
But my eyes are black, my lips are blue
And there's this heaviness when I move (oh-oh)
And that's 'cause everything belongs to you

Everything belongs to you (oh-oh-oh)
Everything belongs to you (oh-oh-oh)
Everything belongs to you (oh-oh-oh)
Everything belongs to you

I do too
(I do too)
