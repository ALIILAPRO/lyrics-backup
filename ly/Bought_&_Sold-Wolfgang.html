		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the family of the free but the freedom drags a bitter taste
Amidst all it's harmony look deep inside comfort and
Security breed sick infected minds who feed on lust and
Ecstasy battered bodies shattered dreams lining the
Streets no end to the means crippled corpses vandalized
Souls degraded penetrated beaten down bought and sold

Pied piping foreigners arrive each day ti blindly lead the
Innocent toward their indecent ways branded children who
Only see the money and toys supposedly given for free
Outlined bodies littered dreams lining the streets no end
To the means riddled corpses violated souls when you're
Degraded penetrated beaten down bought and sold

Oh my brother how do you explain being tied to yourself
No longer my brother what pleasures are left to gain look
Deep inside yourself wrapped in bundles of pain
Into everyday blindly we see the  power of the dollar and
The other currencies is the money they make worth the
Price that they pay it doesn't really matter when there's

One born everyday battered bodies shattered dreams
Lining the streets no end to the means crippled corpses
Vandalized souls degraded penetrated beaten down bought
And sold once again the night arrives as I bleed the tears of
Sorrow this can't be all to expect from life I'll pray for
Better things tomorrow
