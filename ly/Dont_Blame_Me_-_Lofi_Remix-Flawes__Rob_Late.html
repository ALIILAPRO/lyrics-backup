		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm going in circles driving me insane

I lose my focus when you say my name

I know you want to be the one who saves

But I'm probably always gonna be this way

Slamming the door

Pumping the brakes yeah

Pulling you close

Then pushing away

If you get burned it's your mistake

Don't blame me

And just consider this your warning

Coz honestly

Yeah if you're really going for it

I don't know if we'll get that far

If this ends and I break your heart

If I couldn't be the guy you wanted me to be

Well don't blame me

Don't blame me

No I don't mind you in my bed with me

But just know forever, ain't no guarantee

And I don't know for certain you wont walk away hurting

Won't break under pressure

You deserve so much better than

You make me feel like hope is gone, you're wrong, it's never.
