		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Chorus
Jump, jump, jump, freeze
Jump, jump, jump, freeze
Jump, jump, jump, freeze
Jump, jump
Give me room to breathe
Jump, jump, jump, freeze
Jump, jump, jump, freeze
Jump, jump, jump, freeze
Jump, jump
Give me room to breathe

HAHA, HAHA
HAHA, HAHA
Give me room to breathe
Give me room to breathe
Can't handle the pressure
HAHA, HAHA
Can't handle the truth
HAHA, HAHA
Can't handle the pressure
Give me room to breathe
Can't handle the truth
Give me room to breathe

If I was your last breath left, I would suck it in
If you were claustrophobic, I'd be your last bit of oxygen
If I was a mic, I'd give you feed back believe that
Somebody give me room to breathe, so ease back
If I was your number one fan, I'd be the kind that stalks you
If I was a stranger, I'd be the kind you shouldn't talk to
Listen, nobody can match this
‘Cause I make crowds do back flips
Come on

Chorus

If I was your last breath, I would hold it in
If I was religion, I'd be the seven deadly sins
If I was a stage, I'd make the crowd flip
I'm the first kid alive that was born inside a mosh pit
If I was time, then I would stand still
If I was the press, I'd be the type that makes a man kill
‘Cause I will, Yas drops the anvil
You come around showing no skills
Come on

Chorus (2X)

Get up, so I got to rock the place
Stand up, so I got to rock the place (6X)

Chorus (1X)

Can't handle the pressure
HAHA, HAHA
Can't handle the truth
HAHA, HAHA
Can't handle the pressure
Give me room to breathe
Can't handle the truth
Give me room to breathe
Jump, jump, you got to give me room to breathe
Jump, jump, somebody give me room to breathe
Jump, jump, you got to give me room to breathe
Jump, jump, somebody give me room to breathe
