		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, Julian
I hope when I grow up I'm like you
Oh, Julian
Coolest motherfucker in the room

Ditch the band, let's go get stoned
You don't even have to walk me home
Just teach me everything you know

Teleport to New York on Tuesday night
Wanna see how the city looks through your eyes
You and your leather jacket
You're the king of Manhattan
Wanna walk in your shoes, wanna share your mind
Dive bar, bum a smoke, if you need a light
I always got some matches
Ain't rock 'n roll romantic?

Oh, Julian
I get lonely sometimes just like you
Oh, Julian
They don't understand you like I do

Ditch your plans, let's see the Mets
Don't like the sports but I'll pretend
I'm just happy that were friends

Teleport to New York on Tuesday night
Wanna see how the city looks through your eyes
You and your leather jacket
You're the king of Manhattan
Wanna walk in your shoes, wanna share your mind
Dive bar, bum a smoke, if you need a light
I always got some matches
Ain't rock 'n roll romantic?

Mm
Ain't rock 'n roll romantic?
Julian you're selfish
