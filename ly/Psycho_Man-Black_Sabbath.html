		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The midnight hour approaches
The killing chill takes over him
His victims will not know when he appears 
The lust of Death's possession
Will overtake his psycho mind
He won't be happy 'till he smells their fear 
He's the Angel of Death
Psycho Man
Psycho Man
(Angel of Death)
Looking for a victim wherever he can
He's the Angel of Death
Psycho Man
Psycho Man
(Angel of Death)
He's a killer 
Addicted to their madness
The taste of death that lives within
He loves it when he tastes their final breath 
Stalking gives him pleasure
Killing is the final act
He takes no pity with his lust for death 
He's the Angel of Death
Psycho Man
Psycho Man
(Angel of Death)
Looking for a victim wherever he can
He's the Angel of Death
Psycho Man
Psycho Man
(Angel of Death)
He's a killer 
Playing in his twilight zone
He knows that he's the best
Creeping through the streets alone 'till he finds his
victim's (ex/next)
Killing gives him pleasure
Sleeping gives him pain
The only time he's feeling good is when he'd killed and killed again
When he's killed again
When he's killed again
When he's killed again
When he's killed again 
When he's killed again
When he's killed again... 
Watch out! 
He's the Angel of Death
Angel of Death
He's the Angel of Death
Angel of Death
He's the Angel of Death
Psycho Man
Psycho Man
(Angel of Death)
Looking for a victim wherever he can
He's the Angel of Death
Psycho Man
Psycho Man
(Angel of Death)
He's a killer 
He's the Angel of Death
Psycho Man
Psycho Man
(Angel of Death)
Looking for a victim wherever he can
He's the Angel of Death
Psycho Man
Psycho Man
(Angel of Death)
He's a killer 
He's the Angel of Death
Psycho Man
Psycho Man
(Angel of Death)
Looking for a victim wherever he can
He's the Angel of Death
Psycho Man
Psycho Man
(Angel of Death)
He's a killer
