		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So many times we rise and fall
After awhile it's good and all together
Together
So many times we rise and fall
Wondering if we'll find it all together
Together

Baby, but all the nights and days we spent together
(Together)
It's so easy to forget how to surrender
But nothing's ever stopped

Music and lines
Rhythm and melodies
(Take us to the top)
So many nights
So many memories
Music and lines
Rhythm and melodies
(But nothing's ever stopped)
So many nights
So many memories

So many times we rise and fall
After awhile it's good and all together
Together
So many ways to lose it all
Livin' with future, we won't have to give up
Together

Baby, but all the nights and days we spent together
Together
It's so easy to forget how to surrender
But nothing's ever stopped

Music and lines
Rhythm and melodies
(Take us to the top)
So many nights
So many memories
Music and lines
Rhythm and melodies
(But nothing's ever stopped)
So many nights
So many memories

But nothing's ever stopped
Take us to the top
But nothing's ever stopped

Music and lines
Rhythm and melodies
(Take us to the top)
So many nights
So many memories
Music and lines
Rhythm and melodies
(But nothing's ever stopped)
So many nights
So many memories
Music and lines
Rhythm and melodies
(Take us to the top)
So many nights
So many memories
Music and lines
Rhythm and melodies
(But nothing's ever stopped)
So many nights
So many memories
