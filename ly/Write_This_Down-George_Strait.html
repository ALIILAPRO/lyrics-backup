		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never saw the end in sight 
Fools are kind of blind
Thought everything was going alright 
But I was running out of time
'Cause you had one foot out the door 
I swear I didn't see
But if you're really going away
Here's some final words from me

Baby, write this down
Take a little note to remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go
Write this down
Take my words and read 'em every day, keep 'em close by 
Don't you let 'em fade away
So you'll remember what I forgot to say
Write this down

I'll sign it at the bottom of the page
I'll swear under oath
'Cause every single word is true 
And I think you need to know
So use it as a bookmark, stick it on your 'frigerator door
Hang it in a picture frame up above the mantel 
Where you'll see it for sure

Baby, write this down
Take a little note to remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go
Write this down
Take my words and read 'em every day, keep 'em close by 
Don't you let 'em fade away
So you'll remember what I forgot to say
Write this down

You can find a chisel, I can find a stone
Folks will be reading these words 
Long after we're gone

Baby, write this down
Take a little note to remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go 
Write this down
Take my words and read 'em every day, keep 'em close by
Don't you let 'em fade away
So you'll remember what I forgot to say 
Write this down

Oh I love you and I don't want you to go 
Baby write this down
