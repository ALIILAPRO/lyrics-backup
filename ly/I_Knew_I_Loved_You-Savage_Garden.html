		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe it's intuition
But some things you just don't question
Like in your eyes, I see my future in an instant
And there it goes
I think I found my best friend
I know that it might sound
More than a little crazy but I believe

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

There's just no rhyme or reason
Only the sense of completion
And in your eyes
I see the missing pieces I'm searching for
I think I've found my way home
I know that it might sound
More than a little crazy but I believe

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life
Ooh, ooh, ooh

A thousand angels dance around you
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I am complete now that I've found you

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

I knew I loved you before I met you (ooh, ooh, ooh)
I knew I loved you
I knew I loved you before I met you (ooh, ooh, ooh)
I knew I loved you

I knew I loved you before I met you (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I knew I loved you before I met you (yeah)
I knew I loved you
