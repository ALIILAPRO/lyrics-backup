		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Two, three, four
Come and behold it's a mystery
We've become one with the King of Kings
Like life brand new
Have you heard the news?
Come and behold our identity
Born as slaves now we're royalty
I've told a friend or two
Have you heard the news?
I am hidden in the one who has overcome
I am hidden in the center of His love
Fear and doubt have to bow their knee
Now that I am hidden in perfect peace
I am hidden in the one who has overcome
Come and behold there's a faith that grows
By the power of the Holy Ghost
It's a weapon you use
Have you heard the news?
Come and behold our authority
That's breakin' through with a melody
'Cuz once you know the truth
You gotta share the news
I am hidden in the one who has overcome
I am hidden in the center of His love
Fear and doubt have to bow their knee
Now that I am hidden in perfect peace
I am hidden in the one who has overcome
Like children dancing on the grave
Dancing on the grave of timidity
We're marchin' bold and unafraid
Bold and unafraid with hearts set free
I am hidden in the one who has overcome
I am hidden in the center of His love
Fear and doubt have to bow their knee
Now that I am hidden in perfect peace
I am hidden in the one who has overcome
