		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Put your money on her
Put your money on her
Mm, mm, animal

Soft to touch, she got her eyes on us
She's out of luck on love, she's into darker stuff
She's looking left and right, she knows she's cold as ice
She's out of luck on love, she's into darker stuff

'Cause she's an animal, animal
She's an animal, animal
Animal

'Cause she's an animal, animal
She gon' eat you up tonight (animal, animal, animal)
You gon' need her love for life (animal, animal, animal)

Ani-, ani-, ani-, animal, she gon' give it to ya
Ani-, ani-, ani-, animal, let's go wild at night
Ani-, ani-, ani-, animal, if you're coming home with her
'Bout to make a grown man purr, ow

You know she don't play nice, she got an appetite
She comes alive at night, she got a hazel eye
She had to pay the price to live the life she needs
But little did you know, that girl is me

Bitch, I'm an animal, animal
I'm an animal, animal
Animal

'Cause she's an animal, animal
She gon' eat you up tonight (animal, animal, animal)
You gon' need her love for life (animal, animal, animal)

Ani-, ani-, ani-, animal, she gon' give it to ya
Ani-, ani-, ani-, animal, let's go wild at night
Ani-, ani-, ani-, animal, if you're coming home with her
'Bout to make a grown man purr, ow

She gon' eat you up tonight (yeah)
You gon' need her love for life

'Cause she's an animal, animal
She gon' eat you up tonight (animal, animal, animal)
You gon' need her love for life (animal, animal, animal)

Ani-, ani-, ani-, animal, she gon' give it to ya
Ani-, ani-, ani-, animal, let's go wild at night
Ani-, ani-, ani-, animal, if you're coming home with her
'Bout to make a grown man purr, ow
