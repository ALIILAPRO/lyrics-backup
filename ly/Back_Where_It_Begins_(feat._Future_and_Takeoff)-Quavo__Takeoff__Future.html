		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't like it if it ain't mixed (you got this, Nejdos)
Yeah (a tsunami warning has been)

Goin' shoppin' on space coupes, yeah
It's more than this money can make you, yeah
Nine figures, don't let it change you, yeah
Real nigga, so they gon' blame you, yeah
Stack it up, stack it through the ceilin', yeah
Ain't no need if you tryna blend in, yeah
Motivate 'em, they need to see it
I just ordered two Europeans
I'm goin' to park 'em in the trenches
I don't rock it if it ain't vintage
Load the .40, I'm on a mission
No matter how far you go, no matter how far you go
You gotta take it back where it begins

Yeah, yeah
I want all of my chains tennis (yeah)
It was losses before the winnings (yeah)
I put crosses all in my denim (yeah)
Before the privates had to sin 'em (yeah)
Sticks in the sprinter on the freeway (yeah)
Fuckin' up the bag, ain't a cheapskate (yeah)
That boy got gangster shit on replay (Suu)
No matter how far you go, girl, no matter how far you go
You gotta take it back where it begins (yeah)
Blood didn't wash away my sins (yeah)
Bro got locked down doin' ten (yeah)
Don't care 'bout the racks you fold
Don't care 'bout the pack you sold
You know that dope came with a lens (yeah)
Don't go lookin' for no new friends (yeah)

Goin' shoppin' on space coupes, yeah
It's more than this money can make you, yeah
Nine figures, don't let it change you, yeah
Real nigga, so they gon' blame you, yeah
Stack it up, stack it through the ceilin', yeah
Ain't no need if you tryna blend in, yeah
Motivate 'em, they need to see it
I just ordered two Europeans
I'm goin' to park 'em in the trenches
I don't rock it if it ain't vintage
Load the .40, I'm on a mission
No matter how far you go, no matter how far you go
You gotta take it back where it begins

Never forget (yeah, yeah)
Takeoff, I got two Twin F&Ns
Body count, he got 'bout ten (frrp)
Ain't seen him in a minute, where he been?
He put his trust inside the gang, he all in (all)
I feel like if I win, then we all win (for real)
Pray for forgiveness 'cause I know we all sin
Instead of the bank, they'd rather see me in the pen'
I done paid my dues and ran that cash up, talkin' Ms (talkin' cash)
Eliantte diamonds, they keep jumpin' out the gym
And I got your main thang in buss down on film
Droppin' like I'm Bird and we above the rim
Japan denim, you ain't seen nobody in 'em
Just my sermon in my jacket for the winter
First hunnid thousand, I cannot remember
I feel like a winner (I did)

Goin' shoppin' on space coupes, yeah
It's more than this money can make you, yeah
Nine figures, don't let it change you, yeah
Real nigga, so they gon' blame you, yeah
Stack it up, stack it through the ceilin', yeah
Ain't no need if you tryna blend in, yeah
Motivate 'em, they need to see it
I just ordered two Europeans
I'm goin' to park 'em in the trenches
I don't rock it if it ain't vintage
Load the .40, I'm on a mission
No matter how far you go, no matter how far you go
You gotta take it back where it begins
It's more than this money can make you, yeah
Real nigga, so they gon' blame you, yeah
Ain't no need if you tryna blend in, yeah
Motivate 'em, they need to see it
I just ordered two Europeans
I'm goin' to park 'em in the trenches
I don't rock it if it ain't vintage
Load the .40, I'm on a mission
No matter how far you go, no matter how far you go
You gotta take it back where it begins
