		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know all there is to know about the crying game 
I've had my share of the crying game 
First there are kisses, then there are sighs 
And then, before you know where you are, you're sayin' goodbye 

One day soon, I'm gonna tell the moon about the crying game
And if he knows, maybe he'll explain 
Why there are heartaches (heartaches), why there are tears (so sad)
And what to do to stop feeling blue when love disappears 

First there are kisses (kisses)
Then there are sighs (so sad)
And then, before you know where you are
You're sayin' goodbye

Don't want no more of the crying game (don't want no more)
I don't want no more of the crying game (don't want no more)
Don't want no more of the crying game (don't want no more)
I don't want no more of the crying game (don't want no more)
