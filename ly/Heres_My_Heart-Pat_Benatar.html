		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Our two worlds met in strange surprise
I hid my love in thin disguise
I tried to leave, how could I stay?
What if my heart gave me away?
I always thought I'd be prepared
But love just caught me unaware
You said the words and I believed
I fell so hard, I fell so deep

Love can't hide, though it tries
Hearts catch fire, so has mine
Here's My Heart

So true love triumphs once again
It always makes it in the end
And if you let the heart run free
It will return faithfully

Love can't hide, though it tries
Hearts catch fire, all the time
Helpless love walks the line
Hearts catch fire, the hour is fine
Here's My Heart

Ooh, Ooh
Love can't hide, though it tries
Hearts catch fire, all the time
Helpless love walks the line
Hearts catch fire, so has mine

Here's My Heart
Here's My Heart
Here's My Heart
Here's My Heart

Ooh... Hey, Hey, Hey
