		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was Christmas Eve again in the drunk tank
An old man said to me, "Won't see another one"
And then, he sang a song, "The Rare Old Mountain Dew"
I turned my face away and dreamed about you
Got on a lucky one, came in eighteen-to-one
I've got a feeling this year's for me and you
So Happy Christmas, I love you, brother
I can see a better time when all our dreams come true

They've got cars big as bars, they've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you, it's no place for the old
When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broad Street was waiting for me
You were handsome, you were pretty, you're the king of South Philly
When the band finished playing, they howled out for more
The Leathers were swinging, all the drunks, they were singing
We fought on a corner, then danced through the night

The sound of The Silver Ages choir all singing "Galway Bay"
And the bells were ringing out for Christmas day

You's a lush, you're a crumb bum, you smell like some old scum
Washed up from the Schuylkill and rotting away
You dirtbag, you phony, you lousy jabroni
Happy Christmas, you ass, I pray God it's our last

The sound of The Silver Ages choir still singing "Galway Bay"
And the bells were ringing out for Christmas day

I could have been someone
Well, so could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When Mom first had you
I kept them with me, Jas'
I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you

The sound of The Silver Ages choir still singing "Galway Bay"
And the bells were ringing out for Christmas day
