		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rain falling around me
Can't tell if weather is warm
Or why I am cold?
Fame falls all around me
Can't tell if I should just hide or run
Some people hold onto their misery,
A token of their lives
Painted faces, warlike, they march on
Feel the end near, blinding and screaming
For blood they'd do anything

Got two tickets to Peridon, just can't sleep
I've got no reason to worry 'cause it's just a dream
On my way to the classroom
Lit the fire
It's a burning desire
Murder
Water is needed

Hate seems always following
Can't tell if I can run, can't find my way outside
Hate seems always following
Can't tell if I should just run or hide
Some people hold onto their misery
A token of their lives
Painted faces, warlike, they march on
Feel the end near, blinding and screaming
For blood they'd do anything

Got two tickets to Peridon, just can't sleep
I've got no reason to worry 'cause it's just a dream
On my way to the classroom
Lit the fire
It's a burning desire
Murder
Water is needed
