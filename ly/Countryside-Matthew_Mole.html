		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me when you need me
Tell me when you want me
Tell me when you see me
I'll be in the countryside

Don't call it a day
I love you the same
There's nothing that I'll stand in my way
'Cos I'll be where you need me
I'll be where you want me

Don't wait
I'll do my best to see you today
And I won't rest
I'm well on my way
No second guess
Trust me when I say
My love, that

I don't wanna
I don't wanna be here tonight
Oh, I know what I
I know I need you by my side
I want you to fill the world around me
Oh, I know what I
I know I need you by my side
So don't give it up

Can you see the season
Summer in December
Tell me what you're feeling
Tell me you remember when

And I know when you say
You'll show me the way
There's nobody I'd trust more any day
'Cos anywhere is better
Whenever we're together

Don't wait
I'll do my best to see you today
And I won't rest
I'm well on my way
No second guess
Trust me when I say
My love, that

I don't wanna
I don't wanna be here tonight
Oh, I know what I
I know I need you by my side
I want you to fill the world around me
Oh, I know what I
I know I need you by my side
So don't give it up

Tell me what you're feeling
There's a reason we're away from home
I know we'll see another season
Every day is one
You tell me the best is yet to come
And I want to be there with you

Tell me what you're feeling
There's a reason we're away from home
I know we'll see another season
Every day is one
You tell me the best is yet to come
And I want to be there with you

I don't wanna
I don't wanna be here tonight
Oh, I know what I
I know I need you by my side
I want you to fill the world around me
Oh, I know what I
I know I need you by my side
So don't give it up
