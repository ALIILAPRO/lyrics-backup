		  Keep on moving
Keep on moving
Keep on moving
Keep on moving

Oh, when you do me, boy, you can't satisfy me
The love you give to me, it just ain't enough
You don't know how to do me, boy, you drive me crazy
I'm here to tell you, boy, that this is real, yeah

You can't get enough
I can't feel, no
You can't get enough, baby

Keep on moving
Keep on moving
Keep on moving
You can't get enough

I know you think you do is something to me, baby
So when you finish, boy, just leave me here, yeah
The little teeny weenie things you do, oh, baby
You can't satisfy me if you choose, yeah, ooh

You can't get enough
I can't feel, no
You can't get enough

You mean got no

You can't enough
I can't feel, no
You can't get enough, baby

Keep on moving
Keep on moving
Keep on moving
You can't get enough

You can't get enough

Keep on moving
Keep on moving
Keep on moving
Keep on moving

Keep on moving
Keep on moving
Keep on moving

You can't get enough
