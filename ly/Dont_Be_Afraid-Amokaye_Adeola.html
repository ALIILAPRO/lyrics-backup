		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've been bothered about tomorrow 
You've got more questions about today
You're still regretting your yesterday 
Everything seems blurry,  and you cannot see
You've been bothered about your tomorrow 
You've got more questions about today
You're still regretting your yesterday 
Everything seems blurry, you cannot see
If you dont know
I will do everything to keep you going 
It doesn't matter, what you think
But my thought will supersede
ct the follow of my lead 
I will take you to many places
I'll fulfill my promises to you 

No! Don't be cfraid 
I am your God, don't be dismayed 
I paid your price, dont you worry about a thing 
I am your God, don't be cfraid 


You feel the pains of yesterday 
When you remember what your been through
You just want to give up, cos you are afraid 
The world says, this is where you belong
But right in your heart, you know you worth more
Everybody say, please dont give up
But no one is ready, willing to lift you up
It's crazy! It's crazy!
Instead of trying, why dont I give up.
It's crazy! Its crazy!
How long will I do this without result?

No! Don't be cfraid 
I am your God, don't be dismayed 
I paid your price, dont you worry about a thing 
I am your God, don't be cfraid 

Follow my lead, would you follow my lead?
I'll take you to the place where you belong
I'll follow your lead, Lord I'll follow your lead
You'll take me to the place where I belong

I'll follow your lead, Lord I'll follow your lead?
You'll take me to the place where I belong

I go follow follow
I go follow follow you
I go follow follow
To the place where I belong
