		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Close my eyes starting dreaming
See a vision filled with wings
Head my way
Feel the presence of unknown power
Telling me to come
This is the only way

It's dream within dream
Lost and lonely
Don't get pulled by the devil's hand

Silent screamer filled with fear
As the night time shapes a face
Then disappears
Scared forever into believing
That your mind has met the
Prince of whom you see

It's dream within dream
Lost and lonely
Don't get fooled by the
Devil's hand

It's dream within dream
Fool forever, don't get fooled
Forever
Don't get fooled, be the devil

In your eyes
The evil spirit rises
Blinded by the dark
You fall into shame
As the reaper takes you
Down the spiral stairway
You share the evil pit
With Satan's name

Nightmare it's got me runnin'
Nightmare it's calling you
Nightmare it's got me runnin'
Nightmare it's calling you

It's dream within a dream
Lost and lonely
Don't get fooled, be the devil

It's dream within a dream
Lost forever
Don't get fooled

It's got me running
It's just a nightmare
It's got me running
It's got me running
