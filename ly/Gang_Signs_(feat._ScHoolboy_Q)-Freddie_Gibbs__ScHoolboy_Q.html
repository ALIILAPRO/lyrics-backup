		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, uh, a-nigga, yeah-yeah
I've been ridin' in the 'Dor with the dope shit
Ridin' in the Volvo with the dope shit
Yeah-yeah (yeah, yeah) Volvo with the dope shit (yeah)

Every day I need a dope flip
I was on some broke shit, a nigga was a po' pimp, do or die
Nigga play me on some mo' shit
A nigga might as well kill his motherfuckin' self, that's a suicide
Got a Draco, let it rip, nigga hopped up quick
So I had to double back, hit him two times
I ain't new to this shit, bitch, I'm true to this shit
And every mornin', I wake up and throw a gang sign

Yeah, I just wanna be legit
Fuck a bad Insta bitch, Bunny Rabbit off the rip
Bunny Rabbit wrist is lit, 'Mighty-'Mighty know it's lit
All is well in this bitch
Hundred shells in this bitch, fifty shells in this bitch
Never tell in this bitch, fuck 12, suck a dick, fuck 12, suck a dick
Cutlass, all talk with the top off
Hit Diego, he gon' hit me with the drop-off
Tryna floss in the town get you knocked off
Take your chain and your rings and your watch off
Yeah, I just wanna be legit
Fuck a bad Insta bitch, Bunny Rabbit off the rip
Bunny Rabbit wrist is lit, Freddie Corleone, fuck 12, suck a dick

Every day I need a dope flip
I was on some broke shit, a nigga was a po' pimp, do or die
Nigga play me on some mo' shit
A nigga might as well kill his motherfuckin' self, that's a suicide
Got a Draco, let it rip, nigga hopped up quick
So I had to double back, hit him two times
I ain't new to this shit, bitch, I'm true to this shit
And every mornin', I wake up and throw a gang sign

Uh, uh (yeah, ayy)
What it takes, sold that, ayy
What he rap, been that, hey
At the Grammy's still strapped, ayy
I'm glowin' 'cause a nigga straight
I'm happier than yesterday, we 'bout to beat the homie case
Tears on his daughter's face, just tryna help with what I make, ayy
Is it just feelings or rap lines?
Can't get wetty and baptized, no white man gon' save mine
A belt won't help my waistline, still gon' die for my group line
God damn right, it's fuck one time
Way too Crip to go live, you take one, we take nine
We don't stop at stop signs
Might get fifty and that's fine, I just might pop, I keep tryin'

Every day I need a dope flip
I was on some broke shit, a nigga was a po' pimp, do or die
Nigga play me on some mo' shit
A nigga might as well kill his motherfuckin' self, that's a suicide
Got a Draco, let it rip, nigga hopped up quick
So I had to double back, hit him two times
I ain't new to this shit, bitch, I'm true to this shit
And every mornin', I wake up and throw a gang sign (yeah)

Yeah, nigga, yeah-yeah
I ain't new to this shit (yeah)
Every mornin' I wake up and throw a gang sign
Yeah, uh, nigga, yeah-yeah
I ain't new to this shit (yeah)
Every mornin' I wake up and throw a gang sign
