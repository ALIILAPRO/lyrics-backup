		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey hey, my my
Rock and roll can never die
There's more to the picture
Than meets the eye
Hey hey, my my

Out of the blue and into the black
You pay for this, and they give you that
And once you're gone, you can't come back
You're out of the blue and into the black

The king is gone he's not forgotten
Is this the tale of Johnny Rotten
It's better to burn out than to fade away
The king is gone he's not forgotten

Hey hey, my my
Rock and roll can never die
There's more to the picture
Than meets the eye
Hey hey, my my
