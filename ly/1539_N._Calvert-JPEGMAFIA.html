Yeah (she wanna sit on my lap)
Yeah, she wanna sit on my lap

I need all my bitches same color as Drake
If they not, then they gettin' rocked
Put that Pyrex in the pot 
I don't give a fuck if you out there in the six (turn around)
Suck a dick, pussy boy you gettin' hit with the (woo, uh, uh, uh)
And I'm really with the shits, so you not gon' take my hits
Break my heart while I break yo' bitch (right)
Two black cards, let me cloak my wrist (okay)
Fuck a diss, boy, I'm draggin' bodies like it's Metal Gear
I don't care 'bout your fuckin' status, Peggy got no fur, yeah (okay)
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, yeah
Jugg and I come with them bands, ayy
Gun do not come with no plan, ayy (okay)
Keep a Kimber at the pad, ayy
Crackers never get a pass, wait (turn around)
Credit like my name was Chad, ayy
Watch who you fuckin' tag, babe (alright)
Okay, get yo' demo out my face
Shawty, tryna give that dick to Kelly Conway
Pull my case, boy (okay), I beat that shit like Lennon beat his bae
Young O'Shea (young Ice Cube on the map, motherfucker, turn around)
I need a bitch with long hair like Myke C-Town (yeah)
You talking shit (look), I'm talking shit, you catch a beat down (yeah, okay)
I know you never in the hood or in the streets now (hey, turn around)
And still, I'm hearin' that you really want some beef now? (Uh, uh, uh, alright)
Bruh, take your tree out my Backwood
Made the beat 'cause I'm that good (damn)
Got your girl on her hands (eugh), Johnny 5 with the cans (okay)
Fuck a blog, fuck a fan, hope my record get panned (look)
'Least I made you niggas dance
Fuck 12, nigga, stamp

Oh, your body, oh, you got it
On my body, my body, on my body
Oh, your body, oh, you got it
