		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wonder if every body hope that this song is not depressing as the last one was
Heaven smelled like Nag Champas
Come here darling, ash my blunt (Smoke)
Waiting on hallucination, ain't a single fact I trust (No)
Dear family, my sanity go down when my cash go up
Rap too much, how the fuck get through the verse
I came from house parties, find a bitch and go through her purse
All I need is a little good pussy and whole lot universe
I met God before I ever stepped into a church and that motherfucker still owe me money
I need a religion to follow
I swear to God that I got more problems than there is bitches in Carlo
Lord have Murci√©lago, yeah
And I don't know how the fuck I'm supposed
To look into my parents eyes when I'm scared to die
My eyes same color as a cherry pie
Woah, see I'm terrified
Crucifix heavy, who gon' carry mine?
Yeah, what's with all this talk about Hell and Satan
And sleep deprevation
If this is planet Earth, than my hell's a basement

Ascension
A brand new me
Yeah, yeah
Why you wanna do me like that, Miss Conception?
Between heaven and hell
What's between heaven and hell
A brand new me, oh it's the brand new me

Okay, fucking tell these kids one thing, just make sure handle your business
A criminal leave no witness, and don't ever trust these bitches
What happened to your life when your house become a home
Where your children at? Where your children at?
You got two sons, all they do is fight
You up through the night like gimme-gimme-gimme dat
Yeah, nice titties, got a pic, go and send me that
Send that books can you give her that?
Fuck rap, make a million off a shitty app
Yeah, smoke trees in the cab
Pittsburgh, show you where the city at
And don't forget that H, get you smacked in your face
Got so many sons, I was young, now they half my age
90K out in Portugal, smile on my face, backlit stage
My shit bad, shit crazy and that shit fascinates me
On my tongue where the tab is and it burn like battery acid
I was in the backs of my classes by the kids having asthma attacks
Cause he panicked every single time he sat on his glasses
Every Wonderland have a Alice
But I'm a king God can I have a chalice
I'm demanding the truth, put your hands to the roof
Be a man, that's a challenge

Ascension
(Challenge, are you up for that challenge)
A brand new me
(Yeah, everybody got to have balance)
Why you wanna do me like that, Miss Conception?
Between heaven and hell
(Salvation, and the underworld [?] gotta keep that bitch waiting
(Fascinating)
A brand new me, oh it's the brand new me
(And that's fascinating, please be a little patient)

I ain't a doctor, could be a little patient
Yeah, be a little patient
Everything will be okay then, be a little patient
One world, one nation, done waiting
Yeah, yeah
Now I'm still sipping moonshine
We discovered a new high, me and Jerm done this a few times
Yeah, but who's high now
Talk a lot of shit but will you die now
What you gonna do when everybody just go die out
Let's ride out
