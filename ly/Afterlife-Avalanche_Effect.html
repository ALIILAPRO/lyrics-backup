		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the city of circuitry and neon lights
Where shadows dance amidst the electric heights
A world entwined with wires, future's disguise
 
Welcome to the neon age
Where dreams and machines engage
In the city's heart, a new frontier
Where humanity's essence disappears
 
We will suffer til we break the walls again
No more limits, let the sacrifices end
Tear up the roots of domination
This is the task of our generation
Here we are, welcome to the neon age
Data streams and virtual realms
 
The city breathes with a thousand minds
Yearning for connection, longing to regain
 
In the fog of this urban maze
shadows whisper in encrypted ways
A connection evolved, destined to grow
as a thought is rising from below  
Beneath these flickering signs
lie broken souls trying to survive
 
One soul uprooted, two bodies intertwined
In a digital world, a life undefined
 
We will suffer til we break the walls again
No more limits, let the sacrifices end
Tear up the roots of domination
This is the task of our generation
 
A ghost trapped in an artificial body
There's a line between life and death
Or is it true, that it makes me addicted
It is a type of immortality
 
Fiction of a fragile mind
No longer restrained insanity 
The city breathes with a thousand minds
Weaving tales of a better life, where hope collides
Lie broken souls we'll meet in the afterlife
 
In the fog of this urban maze
Shadows whisper in encrypted ways
A connection evolved, destined to grow
As a thought is rising from below  
Beneath these flickering signs
Lie broken souls trying to survive
 
In the fog of this urban maze
Shadows whisper in encrypted ways
A connection evolved, destined to grow
As a thought is rising from below  
Beneath these flickering signs
Lie broken souls we'll meet in the afterlife
