		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Okay
(So)

Running like a dog
Fighting like a bitch too much
And you just can't stand it, baby
Even when I fall
You don't seem to give two shits
'Cause you're just too cool, baby
We could have it all
Neither one of us would budge
'Cause we can't be wrong, baby
Folding up your arms, closing up your heart

I know, I know, I know you think it's me, 'cause I want it all
I know, I know, I know, I know you see, do we gotta talk
No, you know, you know we must believe or fall apart

I feel like our ship's going down tonight
But it's always darkest before the light
And that's enough for me to try
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Whatever you do, ah-ah-ah
Even if I say that it's over now
Even if we want to move on somehow
And just like that we come alive
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Whatever you do, ah-ah-ah

Tryna to get a breath
Thinkin' 'bout the time you said that I was your heart, baby
Tryna understand how a grown man goes on without a body part, baby
I could walk away
I could always cash my chips and I'd be okay, baby
I would be okay, and you might be okay

Oh, I know, I know, I know you think it's me 'cause you want it all
I know, I know, I know, I know you see, do we gotta talk
No, you know, you know we must believe
You're enough for me

I feel like our ship's going down tonight
But it's always darkest before the light
And that's enough for me to try
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Whatever you do, ah-ah-ah
Even if I say that it's over now
Even if we want to move on somehow
And just like that we come alive
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Whatever you do

Whoever said that love was sweet
(Drank a little too much whiskey, baby)
Whoever said that life was easy
(Never lived anywhere near me)
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause you're the one I wanna sink with

I feel like our ship's going down tonight
But it's always darkest before the light
And that's enough
Even if I say that it's over now
Even if we want to move on somehow
And just like that we come alive
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Whatever you do, ah-ah-ah
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Whatever you do, oh-oh-oh
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Whatever you do, ah-ah-ah
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Whatever you do, oh-oh-oh
