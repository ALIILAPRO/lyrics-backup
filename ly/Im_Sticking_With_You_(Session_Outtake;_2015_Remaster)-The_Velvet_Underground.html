		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm sticking with you
'Cause I'm made out of glue
Anything that you might do
I'm gonna do too

You held up a stage coach in the rain
And I'm doing the same
Saw you hanging from a tree
And I made believe it was me

I'm sticking with you
'Cause I'm made out of glue
Anything that you might do
I'm gonna do too

Some people go
Into the stratosphere
Soldiers fighting
With the Cong

But with you by my side
I can do anything
When we swing
We hang past right and wrong

I'll do anything for you
Anything you want me too
I'll do anything for you
Oh, oh, I'm sticking with you
Oh, oh, I'm sticking with you
Oh, oh, I'm sticking with you
Oh, oh, I'm sticking with you
Oh, oh, I'm sticking with you
Oh, oh, I'm sticking with you
Oh, oh, I'm sticking with you
Oh, oh, I'm sticking with you
