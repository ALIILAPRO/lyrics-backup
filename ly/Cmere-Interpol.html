		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's way too late
To be this locked inside ourselves
The trouble is
That you're in love with someone else
It should be me
Oh, it should be me

Sacred parts
Your getaways
You come along
On summer days
Tenderly
Tastefully

And so may
We make time
Try and find somebody else
This place is mine

Set the date
You know exactly how I feel
I had my doubts, little girl
I'm in love with something real
It could be me
That's changing

And so may
We make time
To try and find somebody else
Who has aligned

Now seasoned with health
Two lovers walk a lakeside mile
Try pleasing with stealth, rodeo
See what stands long, ending fast

Oh, how I love you
Oh, in the evenings
When we are sleeping
We are sleeping
Oh, we are sleeping

And so may
We make time
We try and find somebody else
Who has aligned

Now seasoned with health
Two lovers walk a lakeside mile
Try pleasing with stealth, rodeo
See what stands long, oh, ending fast
