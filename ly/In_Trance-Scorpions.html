		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wake up in the morning
And the sun begins to shine
The day did sneak up on the night
I see your face and I see myself
And I get a little taste of life
I try to stand it for a while

But I'm in a trance
Hey baby, tell me, can't you hear me calling?
I'm in a trance
I take too much in the Saturday night 
Hey, hey
Hey baby, tell, me can't you hear me calling?
I'm in a trance
I want to try to stop this life

I feel so sad I'm feeling down
On the radio the music plays
I'm in love with her and I feel fine 
I close my eyes, I think today is getting better with a sip of wine
And I can stand it for a while

When I'm in a trance
Hey baby tell me can't you hear me calling
I'm in a trance
I take too much in the Saturday night
Hey, hey
Hey baby tell me can't you hear me calling
I'm in a trance
I want to try to stop this life

I'm in a trance
Hey baby tell me can't you hear me calling
I'm in a trance
I take too much in the Saturday night
Hey, hey
Hey baby tell me can't you hear me calling
I'm in a trance
I want to try to stop this life
