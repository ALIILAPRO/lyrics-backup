		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments, I'm way too numb, yeah
Feels way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, when you're not around (straight up)
When you throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah

713 through the 281, yeah I'm riding
Why they on me?
Why they on me? I'm flying, sippin' low-key
I'm sipping low-key in Onyx, rider, rider

I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments, I'm way too numb, yeah
Feels way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, when you're not around (straight up)
When you throw that to the side, yeah

When I'm pullin' up right beside ya
Pop star, lil' Mariah
When I text a cute game, wildness
Throw a stack on the Bible
Never Snapchat or took molly
She fall through plenty, her and all her ginnies, yeah
We at the top floor, right there off Doheny, yeah
Oh no, I can't fuck with y'all, yeah
When I'm with my squad I cannot do no wrong, yeah
Saucin' in the city, don't get misinformed, yeah
They gon' pull up on you (brr, brr, brr)
Yeah, we gon' do some things, some things you can't relate, yeah
'Cause we from a place, a place you cannot stay
Oh, you can't go, oh I don't know
Oh, back the fuck up-

I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments, I'm way too numb, yeah
Feels way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, when you're not around (straight up)
When you throw that to the side, yeah

I get those goosebumps every-
