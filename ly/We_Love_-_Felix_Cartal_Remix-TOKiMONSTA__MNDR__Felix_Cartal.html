		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We love, we love, we love
We love, we love, we love

Every day we levitate
Every day we fly a little higher off the ground
Thirty thousand feet away
Thirty thousand feet away from ever coming down

Always doing better, even under pressure
Higher than a satellite
Never gonna come now, never gonna turn round
Us against the world for life

We love, we love, we love, we love
We love, we love, we love
We love, we love, we love, we love
Like nobody does

We love, we love, we love, we love
We love, we love, we love
We love, we love, we love, we love
Like nobody does
Like nobody does

Keep me high on Summer days
In your aether, I don't ever wanna live without
Take me into outer space
I can't feel, my heart is beating at the speed of sound

Always doing better, even under pressure
Higher than a satellite
Never gonna come now, never gonna turn round
Us against the world for life

We love, we love, we love, we love
We love, we love, we love
We love, we love, we love, we love
Like nobody does

We love, we love, we love, we love
We love, we love, we love
We love, we love, we love, we love
Like nobody does

They can't test us, no, they can't test us
Our love's the best, there's no better
They can't test us, no, they can't test us
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Can't test us, no one can test us
Our love's the best, there's no better
They can't test us, no, they can't test us
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody

We love, we love, we love, we love
We love, we love, we love
We love, we love, we love, we love
Like nobody does

We love, we love, we love, we love
We love, we love, we love
We love, we love, we love, we love
Like nobody does

Little man can't test me
Like nobody does
Little man can't test me
Like nobody
Little man can't test me
Like nobody does
Little man can't test me
Like nobody
