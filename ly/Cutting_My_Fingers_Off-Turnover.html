		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I found a picture that we took when brought in the new year
It's hard to see but I remember
You wore a cocktail dress ignored the goosebumps on your neck
The name sake of your outfit to keep you warm
You always said that every thought I had was geometric
I couldn't think outside my own lines
I hope you're alright, and I'm sorry that I wasted your time
Never had the intention to make you go
To make you go
To make you go, to make you go, I never wanted to make you go
You might be a stranger now and I just wanted to let you know
That I meant what I said
And every dream I've ever had has been of myself
And every dream I've ever had's been of 
Better view with a ten month summer
Losing you is like cutting my fingers off
And even with that summer
Without you I'd rather cut my fingers off
