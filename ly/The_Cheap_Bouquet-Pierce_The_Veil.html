		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stay young
And at the top of our lungs
Our hands are free
Our lives have just begun
It's getting dark we should go back
But what's the use if what you love is what you have
And I could die right now
For something beautiful to take me somewhere else

Oh, I try
But I can't calm down
As I drag myself along these severed hands
Are doing the very best they can
I'm gonna buy a cheap bouquet
Before it dies on the display

Gonna break down
Break down the better side of me
The better side of me
Well I know, I know
If I die young

Then we can wake up screaming in your bed
And our lungs are begging us to calm down
And I scare myself with all that talk of severing
Doing the best or so it seems
You've been mistaken

Your finger is on the scale
Burn like you never have before
Stop, drop and roll don't work in hell
So what if I forget regret
So what if I
So what if I forget regret
I want you to know that I
That I've wrote this line a thousand times Forget regret
This must be the way it ends
Calm down

As I drag myself along these severed hands
Are doing the very best they can
As I drive my car into the sea
I taste you like a hammer through my teeth
Will someone tell me what it means

To be alive
It feels just like the feeling when you die
Oh, alright
I'm dead and I don't care if it's cold outside anymore
So come on
Let's have some fun
