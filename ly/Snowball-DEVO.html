		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My baby took our love 
And then she rolled it up 
Rolled it up a hill 
Like a ball of snow 
Like a snowball grows 
Until it gets too big 
Until she lost control 
And it rolled back down [Repeat: x3]

She took a tiny bit 
And rolled it up again 
Slower than before 
She went a step too far 
She had to let it go 
I saw it go straight down 
My baby turned around 
Started up again [Repeat: x3]

Eyes were made for looking' 
Hands were made for holdin' 
Hearts were made for lovin' 
Lips were made for kissin' 
Legs were made for walkin' 
Tracks were made to follow 
That's what I'm gonna do 

Two tracks 
In the snow 
Two tracks 
Up that hill 
My heart broke 
When my baby left 
Two tracks behind
