		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In our diabolical rapture we live on and on
And death keeps knocking at our door
So we open the door and we die a bit more
We`re in love with with death and we die on and on 

Won`t you close our eyes
We`ll be by your side 

In your heavenly rapture we die on and on
And you keep waiting at our door
Yes - we open the door
Let us die a bit more
Because we`re in love with you and we die on and on 

Won`t you close our eyes, eyes
We`ll be by your side 

Your love is the only thing I live for in this world 
Oh how I wait for the day your heart burns 
In these heavenly flames I`ve already scorched in 
I just want you to know I`ll always be waiting 

Your love is the only thing I live for in this world
Oh how I wait for the day your heart burns
In these heavenly flames I`ve already scorched in
I just want you to know I`ll always be waiting
