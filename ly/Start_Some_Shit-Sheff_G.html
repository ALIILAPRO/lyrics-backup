		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (Great John on the beat, by the way)

Look, look, I'm a young nigga
Boss winnin', pockets full of rubber bands
Bitches see me, get to forgettin' that they got a man
Heartbreaker, Glock on my hip, don't make me up again
Glock on my hip, don't make me, look, huh
Flexin', why you flexin', nigga? Huh
Bitch, this chopper on my hip turn you dyslexic, nigga, huh
I ain't playin', think I'm playin'? Get to wettin' shit up
I'ma chill, I see some ladies that might have my baby, huh
Bitch, huh, spent a hunnid on my necklace, nigga
You reach for it, you gon' die, bitch, come and test me, nigga, huh
Yeah, we ballin', we been ballin' all on freaky hoes, huh
Shawty nasty when she suck me, make me curl my toes, huh
Look, I ain't no salty nigga, I know she gon' choose, huh
But catch you with my bitch, look, you better move, huh
Yeah, I like to knuckle up but bro-bro love to shoot
Every day the first of April 'cause we gon' act a fool, huh
Said this shit before, I'll say this shit again, huh
Bitch, we makin' money, don't need to make no friends
It's just me and my dawgs, we will send this bitch up
Please don't flex, I'll make a call and they will bend this bitch up

Look, better not start some shit, look, better not start some shit
Came here to get lit, don't make me up my stick, look
Better not start some shit, look, came here to get lit
Came here to get lit, nigga, don't make me up my stick

Look, tell all them dark skins, brown skins and light skins, "I love 'em," ooh
Look, she got a man but say she love me too, huh
Shorty got that bomb, look
We gon' hit the mall after, get her what she want
Then I'm in the box like FedEx, done made her take my pinky ring
Supposed to be a player, I done fell in love with my sneaky link
Happens to the best of us, a nigga fucked my bitch
At the time I had like four of 'em, just scratch one off my list, look
I done bent a few blocks, I just bought some new chops
I just spent two-fifty up in jewels, I call it moon rocks
I can't fuck with yes men copyin' the next man
This lil' bitch so pretty, I might have to pick a best man
Niggas gettin' smoked for this shit, hol' on, toast for this shit, huh
Shots hit up his back, watch him roll over and shit
Look, they thought that I switched 'cause I got famous and rich
Look, 'member I got cut, the opps was all in a spliff
Look, toke a body, toke a body, huh
Not fuckin' with the talkin', if we catch him, we white chalkin'
Bodies have them niggas cryin', look, give that boy a hug, look
Ain't gon' be no diss tracks, come get it back in blood, huh

Better not start some shit, look, better not start some shit
Came here to get lit, don't make me up my stick, look
Better not start some shit, look, came here to get lit
Came here to get lit, nigga, don't make me up my stick
