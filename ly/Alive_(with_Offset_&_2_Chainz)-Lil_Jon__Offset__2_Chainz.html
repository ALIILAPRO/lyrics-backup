		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wake up in the morning feeling live
God must be really on my side
Got the baddest bitch up by my side
Cash make the pussy come alive
Everybody know I set the vibe
Bet I steal ya bitch like it's a crime
All my niggas come from doing time
Hands in the air, we just so fly

Thank God that I'm alive! (woo)
I been poppin' all my life (woo)
It's like my birthday every night (woo)
I been poppin' all my life (woo)
Thank God that I'm alive! (woo)
I been poppin' all my life (woo)
It's like my birthday every night (woo)
I been poppin' all my life (woo)
Thank God that I'm alive!

Offset!
Ooh, thankin' the Lord I'm alive (God)
Your diamonds not lookin' alive (dead)
Bentley truck swervin', it's wide (skrrt)
Heard you be talkin' to 12 (who?)
But I do not fuck with them guys (no)
First time I seen me a bale (bale)
I thought it was gold in my eyes (yes)
The coupe all red inside (ooh)
Duplex, shawty outside (ooh)
We not feelin' your vibe (yeah)
Nigga played out, retired (retired)
Niggas out here ain't true (nah)
Two-door coupe, no roof (skrrt, skrrt)
Spikes on the back of my shoe (spikes)
You got more money than who? (Who?)
Christian Dior on my boo (Dior)
Real niggas gon' salute (salute)
Drippin' in, I got the juice (drip)
Molly with the Henny boost (ooh)
You're lookin' at the biggest group (who?)
I'm lookin' at the biggest boobs (boobs)
Lookin' at the biggest diamonds
That I put up in my mama's hula hoops (boogers)
You niggas really out of style now (style)
Bitches really need to bow down (bow down)
Migo Gang is a cash cow
Lay down the track, get the bags out (woo)
Handguns and the mags out
It's time for the birds, take a bath now (brrr)
Smokin' cookie, 'bout to pass out (cookie)
Come to the Nawf, got the bags out

Thank God that I'm alive! (whew)
I been poppin' all my life (whew)
It's like my birthday every night (whew)
I been poppin' all my life (whew)
Thank God that I'm alive! (whew)
I been poppin' all my life (whew)
It's like my birthday every night (whew)
I been poppin' all my life (whew)
Thank God that I'm alive!

Rick James, show your titties, it's a celebration
Stuntin', I wore a mink to my graduation (yeah)
F-f-fuck the world, I think it's ovulatin' (okay)
If you ain't gettin' money, what's your occupation? (Tell 'em)
Check my DNA, the A and K'll wet ya, boy
Woo! I think I'm kin to Nature Boy
A lot of flavor, boy, I'm all about my paper, boy (paper)
Went to L.A. and tried to smoke an acre, boy (loud)
I can't relate to noise, bumpin' like a canker sore (bump)
I told her, "Go to Hell, leave your shoes at the door" (damn)
Yeah (yeah,) this the life I chose (chose)
Nigga, look at me, I look right on hoes

Thank God that I'm alive (woo)
I've been poppin' all my life (woo)
It's like my birthday every night (woo)
I've been poppin' all my life (woo)
Thank God that I'm alive

I am so grateful
I am so grateful
I'm in da club vibin'
And I'm so thankful
I got them bands on me
She got her hands on me
She did a dance on me
She put that thang on me
Shawty you wild than a mufucka
Damn.. I ain't nothing but one thang to say

Thank God that I'm alive
Yah, thank God
Thank God, thank God
Thank God, thank God
Yah, yah
Thank God that I'm alive
