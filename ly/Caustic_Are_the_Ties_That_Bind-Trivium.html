		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's we the people
Who spawned this rage
The violent people
Who dawned this age

Who dawned this age

Convulse and kill
Tremble, blood spills
Ruination
Our divination

Caustic are the ties that bind
Like barbed wire, taut and fine
Tied around the wrists that
Plead
Crimson for the dark to feed

Why can't we see
What's come to be
We broke the lifeblood
We're drowned in death's flood
We're drowned in death's flood

Convulse and kill
Tremble, blood spills
Ruination
Our divination

Caustic are the ties that bind
Like barbed wire, taut and fine
Tied around the wrists that
Plead
Crimson for the dark to feed

Caustic are the ties that bind

It surges through us all
A lack of self-control
A sighing, vacant soul

Plunged headfirst in the deep
Nothing for us to keep
Only sounding a weep

Can you help me find my way?
