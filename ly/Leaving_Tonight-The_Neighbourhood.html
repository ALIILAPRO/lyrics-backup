		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You fooled me from the start
When you let me start to love you
It's like a bunch of broken picture frames
But the photo still remains the same

And I, and I
I thought it'd be easy to run but my legs are broken

All alone
All we know
Is haunting me
Making it harder to breathe, harder to breathe, oh

I'm leaving tonight
I'm leaving tonight
I'm leaving tonight, yeah

I'm leaving tonight
I'm leaving tonight
I'll be gone in the morning

I saw it from afar
But my eyes have always fooled me
It looked to me like all the sidewalks started walking
I swear to God the voices wouldn't shut up, oh

And I, I figured it all to be love
But this isn't lovely

All alone
All we know
Is haunting me
Making it harder to breathe, harder to breathe, oh

I'm leaving tonight
I'm leaving tonight
I'm leaving tonight, yeah

I'm leaving tonight
I'm leaving tonight
I'll be gone in the morning

All alone
All we know
Is haunting me
Making it harder to breathe, harder to breathe, oh

I'm leaving tonight
I'm leaving tonight
I'm leaving tonight, yeah

I'm leaving tonight
I'm leaving tonight
I'll be gone in the morning
