		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am a magnet for broken pieces
I am attracted to broken people
I pick 'em up and now my fingers are bleeding
And it looks like I'm
And it looks like I'm caught red-handed

Hit over the head, epiphany
Over my head, repeatedly
Thick skull never did
Nothing for me
Same lesson again?
Come on, give it to me

Only I know where all the bodies are buried
Thought by now I'd find 'em just a little less scary
Might be easier but you don't get used to it
Keep on autopilot, hey
What's the body count up to now, captain?

Hit over the head, epiphany
Over my head, repeatedly
Thick skull never did
Nothing for me
Same lesson again?
Come on, give it to me

I pick 'em up and now my fingers are bleeding
And it looks like I'm caught red-handed

Come on out with your hands up
Come on out with your hands up
I'm coming out with my hands up
Coming out with your hands up

Hit over the head, epiphany
Over my head, repeatedly
Thick skull never did
Nothing for me
The same lesson again?
Come on, give it to me
