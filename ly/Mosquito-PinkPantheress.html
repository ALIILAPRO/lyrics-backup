		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On a Monday, can I see you?
Can I check my numbers? 'Cause I want to
I know it's annoying, how much I do
Spendin' you the day that I want, the day that I want
Another day then, maybe Tuesday?
Can I spend a fortune? 'Cause I want to
I know it's apallin', how I lose you
Spendin' every day that I want, the day that I want
What happened to me?

'Cause I just had a dream I was dead
And I only cared 'cause I was taken from you
You're the only thing that I own
I hear my bell ring, I'd only answer for you

I had prayed out loud 
And, Lord, you answered me too early
I was too young startin' out 
Now I'm too scared that you might leave me
I feel like I'm still a child 
Because I always cross my fingers
Now you're sittin' in accounts
'Cause I'm too scared to take you out
Now save me

'Cause I just had a dream I was dead
And I only cared 'cause I was taken from you
You're the only thing that I own
I hear my bell ring, I'd only answer for you

On a Monday, can I see you?
Can I check my-? 'Cause I want to
I know it's annoying, how much I do
Spendin' you the day that I want, the day that I want
Another day then, maybe Tuesday?
Can I spend a fortune? 'Cause I want to
I know it's apallin'
Spendin' every day that I want, the day that I want
What happened to me?

'Cause I just had a dream I was dead
And I only cared 'cause I was taken from you
You're the only thing that I own
I hear my bell ring, I'd only answer for you
