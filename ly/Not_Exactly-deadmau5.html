		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody hearin' the sound of my voice raise your hands and believe in love,
If you believe,
I need you to believe in love right now!
Raise your hands up high,
Feel the love generation
Cover the world, with love
Come on!

Listen children,
I wanna tell ya somethin' real quick and real fast,
I need you to understand that sometimes 
We're separated because of the color of our skin,
Or were we grew up from,
But I want you to understand somethin',
That we need to embrace the word love 
Because love can bring all generations of people together,
All colors and creeds together,
In peace and harmony,
I want you to feel the love generation!

I need all my believers that are listening to what I'm saying right now,
If it had not been for love, 
Everything that is in this world would not exist,
We need to understand right now that because of love, 
Things happen in a way where people just don't seem to understand,
Love is something that does not, does not compromise itself,
Love is something that we'll sacrifice for everything that goes on,
If you believe!

If you believe,
I need you to believe in Love right now,
Raise your hands up high,
Feel the love generation
Cover the world with love, come on!
