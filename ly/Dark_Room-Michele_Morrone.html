		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel the mess bubbling through me
But I don't care if it touches me now
She wanna dance until she's worn out
Baby, my mind isn't ready now
Baby, my mind isn't ready now
Baby, my mind isn't ready now

Let it tell me something 'cause I need somebody
Treat me as you would treat a little child
Love me, love me, love me now
Touch me, touch me, touch me now
Let me check inside of you (ooh)
Yeah

The radio, the radio is about to explode now
Baby, don't waste your time on lies
The radio, the radio is about to explode
I have to have my dose now or I'll die

God sweet lady (oh, look up in my eyes)
God sweet lady (oh, look up in my eyes)
God sweet lady (oh, look up in my eyes)
God sweet lady (oh, look up in my eyes)

The radio, the radio is about to explode now
Baby, don't waste your time on lies
The radio, the radio is about to explode
I have to have my dose now or I'll die

Living in the dark room
Yes, I'm living in the dark room
'Cause I'm living in the dark room
Save me from this fucking dark room, yeah

Ooh, yeah
Whoa oh, yeah

Let it tell me something 'cause I need somebody
Treat me as you would treat a little child
Let it tell me something 'cause I need somebody
Treat me as you would treat a little child

Living in the dark room
Yes, I'm living in the dark room
'Cause I'm living in the dark room
Save me from this fucking dark room, yeah
Living in the dark room
Yes, I'm living in the dark room
'Cause I'm living in the dark room
Save me from this fucking dark room
