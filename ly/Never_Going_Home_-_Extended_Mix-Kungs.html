		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Music (we can do it)
We're only human (I can feel it)
Music (got me, hit it)
Yeah, let's repeat it (can you feel it?)

If you wanna ride, come ride with me
Take me by the hand, feel the chemistry
Losing track of time in the ecstasy
It's getting out of hand, it's just you and me

And we are never going home, oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Let's go dancin' 'til the morning, oh-whoa, oh-whoa
And we are never going home, oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Let's go dancin' 'til the morning

Music (we can do it)
We're only human (I can feel it)
Music (got me, hit it)
Yeah, let's repeat it (can you feel it?)

If you wanna fly, come fly with me
We'll go anywhere that you wanna be
If you're feeling down, here's the remedy
Losing track of time, it's just you and me

And we are never going home, oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Let's go dancin' 'til the morning, oh-whoa, oh-whoa
And we are never going home, oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Let's go dancin' 'til the morning

Music
And we can do this
Music (never going, never going, never going, never going)
I know we hear it (never going, never going, never going, never going)
We can do it
Oh, I can feel it
We can do it
Oh, I can feel it

And we are never going home, oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Let's go dancin' 'til the morning, oh-whoa, oh-whoa
And we are never going home, oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Let's go dancin' 'til the morning

Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
