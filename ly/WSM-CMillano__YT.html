		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  M's on me like Wall Street
M's on me like Wall Street Maf
Got a bad bih dressed in all black
Leading the team I ain't stuck in the back
Need Floors on Floors
Remember we used to live up in that Council Flat
Just looked at the contract
Now I gotta send that back

Shawty wan play she a centre back
Barclays centre giving out racks
Just linked bro for the Zanta pack
Sipping on Fanta'd yak in the mo
Took a night bus back home from the show
Next year Maybach maybe a rolls
Guess it's the life I chose gotta stay lit till the curtains close

This ain't the life I chose cause baby this life chose me
She want me to focus on her im focused on money and getting degrees
Aye can tell that she liking my steez
She said that I call the rider "pre's"
And I got a band and a half in my jeans
That's why I'm all circumspect on the street
Yeah I'm sipping Captain Morgans with a b
I mix it with coke but she sipping it neat
And she took a picture I told her delete
And I got the white babe I send memes
And I got the black girl I send leaks
Was an ASOS girl when I met her
Now she rock Arc'teryx and alyx

Me 'n' her Tweakin Together
Fuck her old man cause her new one's better
Don't know if my new ones better
Miss my old one think I might text her
Two wheels up no Vespa
Shawty, I don't wanna hear that lecture
My pocket my wallet Bottega Venetta
Don't need a pedometer know I'm a stepper
Tryna get cheques like Petr
Stepped in the Mo now they call me Baretta
Friday turn up I feel like Rebecca
American jawn said I sound like Skepta
She belling my phone like Hector
Ding! ding! ding! like a metal detector
God gave me a gift so I'm applying the pressure
But I can't die young like Roddy or Kesha

M's on me like Wall Street
M's on me like Wall Street Maf
Got a bad bitch dressed in all black
Leading the team I ain't stuck in the back
Need Floors on Floors
Remember we used to live up in that Council Flat
Just looked at the contract
Now I gotta send that back

M's on me like Wall Street
M's on me like Wall Street Maf
Got a bad bitch dressed in all black
Leading the team I ain't stuck in the back
Need Floors on Floors
Remember we used to live up in that Council Flat
Just looked at the contract
Now I gotta send that back

M's on me like Wall Street
M's on me like Wall Street Maf
Got a bad bitch dressed in all black
Leading the team I ain't stuck in the back
Need Floors on Floors
Remember we used to live up in that Council Flat
Just looked at the contract
Now I gotta send that back
