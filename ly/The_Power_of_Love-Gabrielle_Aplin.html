		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Aye, hmm

Dreams are like angels, they keep bad at bay
Love is the light scaring darkness away
I'm so in love with you
Make love your goal

The power of love
A force from above
Cleaning my soul
Flame on, burn desire
Love with tongues of fire
Purge the soul
Make love your goal

I'll protect you from the hooded claw
Keep the vampires from your door
When the chips are down, I'll be around
With my undying death-defying love for you
Envy will hurt itself
Let yourself be beautiful
Sparkling light, flowers and pearls and pretty girls
Love is like an energy
Rushing in, rushing inside of me, hmm

The power of love
A force from above
Cleaning my soul
Flame on, burn desire
Love with tongues of fire
Purge the soul
Make love your goal

This time, we go sublime
Lovers entwined, divine, divine
Love is danger, love is pleasure
Love is pure, the only treasure
I'm so in love with you
Make love your goal

The power of love
A force from above
Cleaning my soul
The power of love
A force from above
A sky scraping dove
Flame on, burn desire
Love with tongues of fire
Purge the soul
Make love your goal

Make love your goal
