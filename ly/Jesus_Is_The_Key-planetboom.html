		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are, You are, You are
You are the highest priority
You are, You are, You are
The most important thing to me

Nothing else compares
No one else is even on Your level
You are all in all
Jesus, You are all that matters now

Woah, Jesus is the key,  the only one for me
High and lifted up, the son of God
Woah, Jesus is the key, with all authority
High and lifted up, the son of God, woah

You are, You are, You are
The headline for all of eternity
You are, You are, You are
You are the centre of everything, yeah

And nothing else compares
No one else is even on Your level
You are all in all
Jesus, You are all that matters now

Woah, Jesus is the key, the open door for me
High and lifted up, the son of God
Woah, Jesus is the key, with all authority
High and lifted up, the son of God, yeah

Something happens when I lift up Jesus
Everything begins to change
Something happens as I worship Jesus
Everything falls into place
'Cause You hold it all, You're in control
And what You open, nobody can close
Something happens when I'm in Your presence
King Jesus, oh
Something happens when I lift up Jesus
Everything begins to change
Something happens as I worship Jesus
Everything falls into place
And You hold it all, You're in control
And what You open, nobody can close
Something happens when I'm in Your presence
King Jesus

Woah, Jesus is the key, the final word for me
High and lifted up, the son of God
Woah, Jesus is the key, with all authority
High and lifted up, the son of God, mm-mm-mm

Jesus (Nothing else compares) , Jesus (To being in Your presence)
