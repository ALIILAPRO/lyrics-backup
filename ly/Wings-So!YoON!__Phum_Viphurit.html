		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I had wings I would fly to you
Even if it doesn't make sense at all
If I lose my tongue then I'll be dancing for you
Even when I can not find a place to do
Ooh ooh ooh

Yeah I fell in love come kiss me wake me up
I hope you wish me luck even when I'm down on my knees
Yeah I fell in love come kiss me wake me up
I hope you wish me luck even when I'm down on my knees

Yeah I fell in love come kiss me wake me up
Only you
Only you can wake me up
Yeah I fell in love come kiss me wake me up
Only you
Only you can wake me up

If I had fins I would swim to you
Even if it doesn't make sense at all
If I lose my feet then I'll be singing for you
Even when I can not find a place to do
Ooh ooh ooh

Yeah I fell in love come kiss me wake me up
I hope you wish me luck even when I'm down on my knees
Yeah I fell in love come kiss me wake me up
I hope you wish me luck even when I'm down on my knees

Yeah I fell in love come kiss me wake me up
Only you
Only you can wake me up
Yeah I fell in love come kiss me wake me up
Only you
Only you
Only you can wake me up

Yeah I fell in love come kiss me wake me up
Only you
Only you
Only you can wake me up
Ooh ooh ooh
