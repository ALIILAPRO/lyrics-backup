		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alone in my car, I'm in a parking lot, darkest spot in my mind
My tongue is dry, why do I crumble quickly, stumble swiftly?
Cursing myself, I burned the furniture a million times in my head
I'm feeling low, got nowhere to go, but back up again

You gotta get bruised before you get mad
You gotta fall down before you fight back
Was feeling so weak but baby, I'm strong
Little did I know, I'm a champion

I'm a champion, on
Oh, oh
I'm a champion, on
Oh, oh
I'm a champion

Nobody said it'd be an easy ride, obstacles in my way
Scars never change, why do I crumble quickly, stumble swiftly?
Cursing the world, I burn the songs I wrote a billion times in my head
I'm feeling low, got nowhere to go but back up again

You gotta get bruised before you get mad
You gotta fall down before you fight back
Was feeling so weak but baby I'm strong
Little did I know, I'm a champion

I'm a champion, on
Oh, oh
I'm a champion, on (ooh, ooh)
Oh, oh
I'm a champion

(Mm, mm)
You gotta get bruised before you get mad (mm)
You gotta fall down before you fight back (mm)
Was feeling so weak but baby, I'm strong (mm)
Little did I know I'm a champion
(I'm a champion, I'm a champion)

I'm a champion, on (I'm a champion)
Oh, oh
I'm a champion, on (ooh, ooh)
Oh, oh
I'm a champion, on (I'm a champion now)
Oh, oh
I'm a champion, on (ooh, I'm a champion)
Oh, oh (yeah, hey)
I'm a champion
