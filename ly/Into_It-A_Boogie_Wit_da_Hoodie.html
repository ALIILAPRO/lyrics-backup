		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (It's JoeFromYO)
(DLo on the beat)

They listenin'
What the fuck is they whisperin'? (Fuck is they whisperin'?)
My baguettes is so icy, yeah, yeah
They got me shiverin' (my baguettes is so icy, so icy)
I am the Boogieman (I am the Boogieman)
I don't wanna kill again (don't want to kill again)
But I got my hoodie on, yeah
We'll shoot a civilian (shoot at him, bap)

I'm innocent (innocent)
I am a gentleman (huh?)
Okay, I'm a savage, yeah, yeah
But I could be a gentleman (okay, let's get into it)
I get straight into it (into it)
Okay, let's get into it
Pulled up with my hoodie on, yeah
And I'm looking for Zimmerman (shoot at him, bap)

My nigga I'm sick with it (nigga, I'm sick with it)
I got addictions, yeah
I need some medicine, yeah
Adderall like a vitamin
That's gon' rush my adrenaline
Niggas be rattin' and whistling, yeah
You gotta watch what you say, nigga, it be a lot of them, hah
Don't kill a snake, 'til a snake kill a damn rat
Wait when a snake kill a rat, hit the snake, brap
Shoot his back pockets just for talking out his ass
Gotta keep a pocket rocket just in case it get bad
And I swear to God its getting hard
She called me a heartless nigga, she cried a river
The river was big enough for a boat
And I ain't a swimmer, yeah
And it's a man down, but it wasn't even me that him 'em
Baby, I'm innocent
And when it rain now, it be pouring, my hoodie ain't big enough
It's raining hard, my nigga

They listenin'
What the fuck is they whisperin'? (Fuck is they whisperin'?)
My baguettes is so icy, yeah, yeah
They got me shiverin' (my baguettes is so icy, so icy)
I am the Boogieman (I am the Boogieman)
I don't wanna kill again (don't want to kill again)
But I got my hoodie on, yeah
We'll shoot a civilian (shoot at him, bap)

I'm innocent (innocent)
I am a gentleman (huh?)
Okay, I'm a savage, yeah, yeah
But I could be a gentleman (okay, let's get into it)
I get straight into it (into it)
Okay, let's get into it
Pulled up with my hoodie on, yeah
And I'm looking for Zimmerman (shoot at him, bap)
