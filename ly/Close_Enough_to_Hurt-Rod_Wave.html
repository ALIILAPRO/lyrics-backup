		  (Drum Dummie)
(Drum Dummie made the beat and I'm gon' kill it)

In this life I've been scarred
So I walk around with my guard
And they quick to say Lil Nuni trippin' 
I think about my past and get in my feelings (okay)
I think about the people who desert me (okay)
I think about the ones who didn't deserve me (okay)
Think about the ones who did me dirty (okay)
I won't let you close enough to hurt me (okay)

And I've been stayin' to myself, I've been movin' low-key
'Cause I don't know you, and nigga, you don't know me
I don't need no new homeboys, nigga, I'm straight
You can keep your handshakes, these niggas snakes, I play it safe
And sometimes I wish bae could understand (okay)
That I am not your average man (okay)
Ain't insecure, I'm just hurtin'
Tryna find out is you worth it?
Openin' up make me worried
And new faces make me nervous (who that?)
Like where these niggas was when we was slidin' in my Acura?
Now they wanna pop ou 'cause them R's is in the back of us
And we be state to state, promoters always got them racks for us
New niggas come 'round, I disappear like Perry the Platypus

In this life I've been scarred
So I walk around with my guard
And they quick to say Lil Nuni trippin' 
I think about my past and get in my feelings (okay)
I think about the people who desert me (okay)
I think about the ones who didn't deserve me (okay)
Think about the ones who did me dirty (okay)
I won't let you close enough to hurt me (okay)
