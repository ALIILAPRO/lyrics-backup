		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And i don't wanna talk about love anymore, cause it's getting too much for me 
All i do's waste and decline, waiting for that age of my life 
When i'm old and love is all that i'll need

Swaying in the lamplight in my mother's white gown
Holding out like a dog they've yet to put down
I whore out my tears and just keep wasting the best of my years
Like a beauty queen with eyes bleared

Got what i wanted but it's never enough 
For me
Darling, don't you see
I'm so beautiful and it's wasted on me 
Because the taste reminds me
I hate what love's turned out to be

I don't wanna be in my house anymore cause it just makes me sad
Letting in the wild with every man who brings a world of hurt with him 
Every time he falls in my bed

Do you just want my blood
Am i just that damn hard to love
Cause it feels like all i have is still just not enough
I guess that i'll just go outside and watch the fire and fields of gold 
Fly farther away from me

Got what i wanted but it's never enough 
For me
Darling, don't you see
I'm so beautiful and it's wasted on me 
Because the taste reminds me
I hate what love's turned out to be

But one of these days it'll come right back
I'll get over myself and i'll tell myself that
I don't have to wait to be happy when i'm old
And that one of these days i'll find a way
To fight the waves, embrace the pain
And paint the ages a hundred shades of gold

And i have found a way, i'd forgot the way, but i'm on my way, i'm on my way
Don't wait too long, i don't want you to get tired of me, but i'll be coming along
I'm coming along, i'll be coming along, i'll be coming along, i'll be coming along
I'll be coming, i'm coming for you
