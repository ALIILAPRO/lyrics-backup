		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your messiah was never mine
Your messiah was never mine
Your messiah was never mine
Your messiah was never mine
Your messiah was never mine
Your messiah was never mine
Your messiah was never mine
Your messiah was never mine
Your messiah was never mine
Your messiah was never mine
Hypocrites

Weeping rose of Jeremiah
Drops of blood drip off your petals
Representing all our tears
In a ring of burning metal
How you gonna be, what you gonna say, it
Doesn't bother me, who you gonna pay?

Sorcerers and sadists come
To define the what and why
People travel 'cross this earth
Over water, land, and sky
How you gonna be, what you gonna say, it
Doesn't bother me, who you gonna pay?

Pay the ferryman, pay the fucking driver
Pay the preachers and pay the fucking liars
Pay the bitches, they're charging all their dates, stand by
I'm not gonna pay, it's already mine

Hypocrites, I'm gonna do it blind
Hypocrites, I'm gonna do it blind
Hypocrites, I'm gonna do it blind
Hypocrites (your messiah was never mine)

Weeping rose of Jeremiah
Purity unlike no other
Offers hope to those who need it
Don't forget care to the brother
How you gonna be, what you gonna say, it
Doesn't bother me, who you gonna pay?

Little old lady at home
Writing out a check to send
It's all the money that she owns
She believes the world might end
How you gonna be, what you gonna say, it
Doesn't bother me, who you gonna pay?

Pay the ferryman, pay the fucking driver
Pay the preachers and pay the fucking liars
Pay the bitches, they're charging all their dates, stand by
I'm not gonna pay, it's already mine

Hypocrites, I'm gonna do it blind
Hypocrites, I'm gonna do it blind
Hypocrites, I'm gonna do it blind
Hypocrites (your messiah was never mine)

Hypocrites

Pay the ferryman, pay the fucking driver
Pay the preachers and pay the fucking liars
Pay the bitches, they're charging all their dates, stand by
I'm not gonna pay, it's already mine

Hypocrites, I'm gonna do it blind
Hypocrites, I'm gonna do it blind
Hypocrites, I'm gonna do it blind
Hypocrites

Hypocrites
Hypocrites
Hypocrites
