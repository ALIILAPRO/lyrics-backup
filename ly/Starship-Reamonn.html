		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Step into my Starship
Let's go for a ride
Step into this moment
We'll fly through the night
And when the fools are making wars
We'll be up here among the stars
Step into my Starship
Just you and I
I'm looking through a keyhole
At the deep blue sky
I'm searching for a future
For you and I
And when the sun begins to shine
Well the fools be going blind
Looking through a keyhole
Of the deep blue sky
Well you think you got something to say
So stand up something to say
You turn on your radio
And the big man's coming your way
And still you want to run
And still you want to hide
And still you think your Starship's
Waiting outside
You think that you can run
You think that you can hide
You think that you've been living
Such a beautiful life
But there is no place to run
No there's no place to hide
You think that you can
Disappear from this world
I'm looking in your eyes
See that you're surprised
Well baby there's no Starship
Waiting outside
For you and me
Cruising in a Starship
High and free
When the fools are making war
We'll be out there among the stars
Cruising in a Starship
Just you and me
Living in a Starship
Living in a Starship
Cruising in a Starship
I'm living in a Starship
