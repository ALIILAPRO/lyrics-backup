		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Hey god) why are you doing this to me?
Am I not living up to what I'm supposed to be?
Why am I seething with this animosity?
(Hey god) I think you owe me a great big apology

Terrible lie
Terrible lie
Terrible lie
Terrible lie

(Hey god) I really don't know what you mean
Seems like salvation comes only in our dreams
I feel my hatred grow all the more extreme
(Hey god) can this world really be as sad as it seems?

Terrible lie
Terrible lie
Terrible lie
Terrible lie

Don't take it away from me, I need you to hold on to
Don't take it away from me, I need you to hold on to
Don't take it away from me, I need you to hold on to
Don't take it away from me, I need someone to hold on to
Don't tear it away from me, I need you to hold on to
Don't tear it away from me, I need you to someone on to
Don't tear it away from me, I need you to hold on to
Don't tear it, don't tear it, don't tear it, don't tear it, don't

(Hey god) there's nothing left for me to hide
I lost my ignorance, security and pride
I'm all alone in a world you must despise
(Hey god) I believed the promises, your promises and lies

Terrible lie
Terrible lie
Terrible lie
Terrible lie
Terrible lie

You made me throw it all away
My morals left to decay (terrible lie)
How many you betray you've taken everything (terrible lie)
My head is filled with disease
My skin is begging you please (terrible lie)
I'm on my hands and knees, I want so much to believe

(I give you everything)
(My sweet everything)
(I need someone to hold on to)
(I need someone to hold on to)
(I need someone to hold on to)
(I need someone to hold on to)
(I need someone to hold on to)
(I need someone to hold on to)
(I need someone to hold on to)
(I need someone to hold on to) 

(I need someone to hold on to)
(I need someone to hold on to)
(I need someone to hold on to)
(I need someone to hold on to)
(I need someone to hold on to)
(I need someone to hold on to)
(I need someone to hold on to)
(I need someone to hold on to)
(I need someone to hold on to)
