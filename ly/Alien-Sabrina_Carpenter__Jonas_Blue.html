		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This feeling's so alien
Need to know if you're just a friend
Are you a secret I'm holding in
So leave it on my brain if you feel the same
Light, but I notice it
Don't know the rules but I got to win
The paranoia is sinking in
So leave it on my brain if you feel the same

Ooh, let me discover all of your colors
If you love me let me know
No, no, let me discover all of your colors
If you love me let me know

Don't let me leave when I'm standing at your door
Don't make me stop when you're really wanting more
If you show me what you're thinking of
Let me get inside your mind
If you show me love it'll be enough
It'll be a better night

If you love me let me know
If you love me let me know
If you love me let me know
It'll be a better night
If you love me let me know
If you love me let me know
If you love me let me know
It'll be a better night

I alienated them
Right about when our love begin
Emotions are moving in
Gettin' in my space, living in my place
When did these games begin?
I'm overthinking my thoughts again
No we don't break, but we're bound to bend
Gettin' in my space, living in my place

Ooh, let me discover all of your colors
If you love me let me know
No, no, let me discover all of your colors
If you love me let me know

Don't let me leave when I'm standing at your door (Baby no, don't let me)
Don't make me stop when you're really wanting more ('Cause I know you're wanting more)
If you show me what you're thinking of
Let me get inside your mind
If you show me love it'll be enough
It'll be a better night

If you love me let me know
If you love me let me know
If you love me let me know
It'll be a better night (Be a better night)
If you love me let me know
If you love me let me know
If you love me let me know
It'll be a better night (No, no, no)
If you love me let me know
If you love me let me know
If you love me let me know
It'll be a better night
If you love me let me know
If you love me let me know
If you love me let me know
It'll be a better night
A better night, yeah
