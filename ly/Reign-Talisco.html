		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Down in a hole, the reign is coming
This is the line, sing the words

Down in the rain , the feeling is coming
Come around me, here’s a sign

Out of the reign
I took a chance
The only chance

I see the game
Out of the reign
And there's no change

I'll offer you up a dream
I'll offer you up the reign

No bloods on you
The reign is come
The only chance

Down in a hole, the reign is coming
This is the line, sing the words

Down in the rain , the feeling is coming
Come around me, here’s a sign

Here’s a sign
Here’s a sign
Here’s a sign
Here’s a sign

Out of the reign
I took a chance
The only chance

I see the game
Out of the reign
And there's no change

I'll offer you up a dream
I'll offer you up the reign

No bloods on you
The reign is come
The only chance

Down in a hole, the reign is coming
This is the line, sing the words

Down in the rain , the feeling is coming
Come around me, here’s a sign

Here’s a sign
Here’s a sign
Here’s a sign
Here’s a sign
I see the reign, its coming
The reign, its coming
I see the reign, its coming
The reign, its coming
I take a look around you,
I see the way the wind blow
I take a look around you,
I see the way the wind blow
Here’s a sign
Here’s a sign
Here’s a sign
Here’s a sign
