		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I still have your faded Nike sweatshirt
So when you coming back home
To the city, streetlights, mayhem
I know you're missing that, oh
I've almost had enough
Of just your face on my phone
It's old news but I miss you

Counting down the days
Every minute every hour
Got me going insane
While the leaves fall off your flowers
I'm wishing you were closer
Your coffee's getting colder
Can't you see I'm waking up
Without the piece of me I love

Wondering if it's all worth it
But I know in my heart it's right
Cause I

I still have your faded Nike sweatshirt
So when you coming back home
To the city, streetlights, mayhem
I know you're missing that, oh
I've almost had enough
Of just your face on my phone
It's old news but I miss you

You always make it easy
Every time that we're together
But I never realized how the list
Goes on and on forever
The way you lean in for a kiss
And how we sang along to Taylor swift
You're kindly conscious of all my nonsense
Oh it's the little things I miss

Wondering if it's all worth it
But I know in my heart it's right
Cause I

I still have your faded Nike sweatshirt
So when you coming back home
To the city, streetlights, mayhem
I know you're missing that, oh
I've almost had enough
Of just your face on my phone
It's old news but I miss you

It's old news but I miss you
