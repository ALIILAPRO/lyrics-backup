		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Close your eyes and sleep
Ignore all the burdens that you keep 
Come whatever may
They could never harm you anyway
 Stirrings in the wind resonates a whisper from within  Warnings from afar 

Telling you to heed the morning star
  Waking from the dream 
Witnessing the smoke that's rolling in  
The end is what you fear

 The scent of embers lingers in the air  It's like a web there is no escape from
 It's got you trapped and you long for freedom  
Every wish every dream was granted
 Never knowing what they demanded 
You see the wall how it's getting higher 

You want to fight but you're all divided
 It's not a world anyone could thrive in
 Is this the world we were meant to grow in?  
Somebody tell me where are we going?
  A brave new world will rise if we do not act upon its lies Hold your tongues no more 
Learn from all the ones who came before
  Catch the wind and fight the storm  
Through the fury we're holding on  
Take your time but not too long  
Make it worth the time you own  
You woke a fire inside of me
 Fanned the flame and made it breath  
You woke a fire inside of me Inside of me 
Inside of me
