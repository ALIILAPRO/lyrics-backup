		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody?s looking at me
(That?s how you get 'um, girl)
They like the way I turn up the heat
(That?s how you get 'um, girl)

Walk ?em, get out off my beat
(That?s how you get it, girl)
That's how I get it, girl
Kisses down south

This journey keep look sun of me
We cannot unnotice, you've been the love for me
Let me be, let me be boy, get up all for me
The way I drop my arms and make them mush all over me

You wanna pick my puakenikeni
Don't you wanna pick my puakenikeni?
Don't you wanna kiss me in my red bikini?
Nothing?s sweeter than my puakenikeni

that's how you get 'um, girl
That's how you get 'um, girl
That's how you get 'um, girl
This is how you get 'um, girl
Kisses down south

Everybody?s looking at me
(That?s how you get a girl)
They like the way I turn up the heat
(That?s how you get a girl)

Walk ?em straight, get out off my beat
(That?s how you get a girl)
That's how I get it, girl
Kisses done south

Put ?em up then, put ?em up then, [unverified] wants to know it
Put ?em up then, put ?em up then, Money wants to know it
It?s Brick and Lace and we call up ?em at the party
And when we on we down south, get ?em roudy

haven't said that woman do a keni when it?s weak
We get the ?something? from the puakeni tree
I'm the evening, the darling, I can sense it, the evest
My love?s at his work and you don't want to believe him

don't you wanna pick my puakenikeni?
Don't you wanna pick my puakenikeni?
Would you wanna kiss me in my red bikini?
Nothing?s sweeter than my puakenikeni

that's how you get 'um, girl
That's how you get 'um, girl
That's how you get 'um, girl
This is how you get it, girl
Kisses down south

Everybody?s looking at me
(That?s how you get a girl)
They like the way I turn up the heat
(That?s how you get a girl)

Walk ?em straight, get out off my feet
(That?s how you get it, girl)
That's how I get it, girl
Kisses down south

don't you wanna pick my puakenikeni?
Don't you wanna pick my puakenikeni?
Would you wanna kiss me in my red bikini?
That's how I get it, girl
Kisses down south
