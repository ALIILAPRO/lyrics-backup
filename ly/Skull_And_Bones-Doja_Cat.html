		  It's cold
I mean really cold
But my blood is warm (blood is warm)
What's inside of me but skull and bones?
Ask the Lord
There's a price for yours (price for yours)
What's inside of me now but my soul?

Yeah, said
The only thing I sold was a record
The only thing I folded under was pressure
Can I say, I digress? You the aggressor
Now y'all say, y'all impressed, I'm the successor
I don't need no intervention or one ya lectures
What's so hard to believe? What is the message?
Talented and I'm driven like you ain't ever seen
And that's why God blessed me you, should respect Him
You need to mind your business, Helga Pataki
'Cause I'ma do something devilish if you at me
I might hit Woo for the kudu and get a back piece
You too high off that booboo to unpack me (ah)
When I arrive on set there ain't no holy water
But when I grind my set make sure to throw me waters
I'ma make it through twenty-seven, y'all superstitious
I'ma say jinx on my twenty-eighth when you owe me sodas

It's cold (yeah)
I mean really cold
But my blood is warm (blood is warm) (come on, let's go)
What's inside of me but skull and bones? (Let's go, yeah)
Ask the Lord (ask the Lord)
There's a price for yours ('cause there's a price for yours)
What's inside of me now but my soul? (Uh-huh)

Yeah, yeah
Y'all been pushin', "Satan this" and "Satan that"
My fans is yellin', "'Least she rich," you need that pact
Lookin' like I got some things you hate I have
And trust me, baby, God don't play with hate like that
So you gon' be real upset when he pick Cat
To be the one up on them charts, all over the map
And you could keep on tellin' yourself it's all in my tats
And you could keep on addin' the numbers and doin' the math (yeah)
I see y'all prepping for Doomsday, but that ain't San Andreas' fault
And this ain't a movie
But I know y'all been livin' life like this is a school play
How red is them rubies? You chokin', it's too late
I turn 'em to blue face, I run on a full tank
Can't nobody move me
Bitches cryin' with full face, that's animal cruelty
And I don't need to say it to 'em
I'ma let the paper talk, gotta elevate the bar
The world's losin' faith 'cause

It's cold (yeah)
I mean really cold (I mean)
But my blood is warm (blood is warm) (come on, come on, let's go, let's go)
What's inside of me but skull and bones? (Let's go, yeah)
Ask the Lord (ask the Lord)
There's a price for yours ('cause there's a price for yours)
What's inside of me now but my soul? (Uh-huh)
