		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a strand in the DNA
There's a part that's still untamed
That only comes out when it's make or break
Feel your back up against the wall we are animals after all
You can't keep us caged

So bite the hand til it bleeds take whatever you need Addicted to the violence We are all savages
That prey
Prey upon the weak 
Bringing out the worst of us 
We are all savages
Savages

There's a flame running through our veins 
There's a hate that just won't fade
That only comes out when we go insane
Feel your sanity start to break 
Forget the lies that We're all saints 
We're swimming in rage
I'm thinking it's all burning
The tables turnin'
And they don't have to play the game 
But they're losing all the same

So bite the hand til it bleeds take whatever you need Addicted to the violence We are all savages
That prey
Prey upon the weak 
Bringing out the worst of us 
We are all savages
Savages

I think I know
There's something to this struggle 
Trapping our hope
This wasn't our fault
No
Nothing seems to change 
When we're counting our stains 
Placing all the blame
On each other
