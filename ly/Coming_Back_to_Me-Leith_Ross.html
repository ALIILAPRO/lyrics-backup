		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I used to wake to the morning and feel like the world was created for me I used to wait for the morning so eagerly, sometimes I just couldn't sleep
It might have started the first time I got really sick and my mum wasn't there Three years of college and I had forgotten that I used to find living rare
But it's all coming back to me now It's all coming back to me now
It's all coming back to me now
Last week I wondered if dying would feel like the stories the catholic church told But I used to talk to my mother about how I just couldn't wait to get old
And it's all coming back to me now It's all coming back to me now
It's all coming back to me now
I used to wake to the morning and feel like the world was created for me
