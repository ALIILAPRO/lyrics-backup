		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I always hope that you remember 
We'll never really learn the meaning of it all
What we have is strong and tender
So hold on

In the middle of the madness
When the time is running out and you're left alone
All I want is you to know that
It's strong still
Can't pull us apart

Nothing (can come)
Can come (nothing can come)
Between us (nothing can come)
Nothing (between us)
Can pull us apart (yeah baby)
(Nothing can come)
Can come (nothing can come)
Between us
(Nothing can come between us)

I always hope that you remember 
What we have is strong and tender
In the middle of the madness
Hold on

So it truly is a good thing
And I always wanted you to know
There is always this and this is everlasting
Hold on

It's about faith
It's about trust, yeah, yeah
It's about faith
It's about trust

Nothing can come
Nothing can come
Nothing can come between us (yeah baby)
Nothing can come
Nothing can come
Nothing can come between us

Can come (nothing can come, nothing can come)
Can tear (nothing can come between us, yeah baby)
Can pull (nothing can come, nothing can come)
Us apart (nothing can come between us)

Can come (nothing can come, nothing can come)
Can tear (nothing can come between us, yeah baby)
Can pull (nothing can come, nothing can come)
Us apart (nothing can come between us)

Can come (nothing can come, nothing can come)
Can tear (nothing can come between us, yeah baby)
Can pull (nothing can come, nothing can come)
Us apart (nothing can come between us)
