		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah

If the heart is always searching
Can you ever find a home?
I've been looking for that someone
I'll never make it on my own
Dreams can't take the place of loving you
There's gotta be a million reasons why it's true

When you look me in the eyes
And tell me that you love me
Everything's alright
When you're right here by my side
When you look me in the eyes
I catch a glimpse of heaven
I find my paradise
When you look me in the eyes

How long will I be waiting
To be with you again?
Gonna tell you that I love you
In the best way that I can
I can't take a day without you here
You're the light that makes my darkness disappear

When you look me in the eyes
And tell me that you love me
Everything's alright
When you're right here by my side
When you look me in the eyes
I catch a glimpse of heaven
I find my paradise
When you look me in the eyes

More and more, I start to realize
I can reach my tomorrow
I can hold my head high
And it's all because you're by my side

When you look me in the eyes
You tell me that you love me
Everything's alright
When you're right here by my side
When I hold you in my arms
I know that it's forever
I just gotta let you know
I never want to let you go

'Cause when you look me in the eyes (yeah)
And tell me that you love me
Everything's alright (it's alright)
When you're right here by my side (by my side)
When you look me in the eyes
I catch a glimpse of heaven, oh
I find my paradise
When you look me in the eyes

Oh, oh, yeah
Ah, ahh, ah
Whoa, yeah, ah
