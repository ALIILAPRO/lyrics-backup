		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You and I, stand with our heads held up high
Me and you, together whatever we do
You and I, stand with our heads held up high
Me and you, together whatever we do

All the love - you've given me, I cherish, babe, so
Tenderly
All the times - I've spent with you, I treasure girl, you
Know I do
Everything I possess is down to you more or less
Anything that you say, I'm for you all the way
All the joy that you bring makes my heart wanna sing
Really forever this way

You and I, stand with our heads held up high
Me and you, together whatever we do... 

On the day - I met you girl, I found myself a better
World
On the night - when first we kissed, I realized how much
I missed
Felt the fun when you came, didn't you feel the same
Reaching out for your hand, hoping you understand
Now we know where we stand, and we're both certain that
We'll live forever this way

You and I, stand with our heads held up high
Me and you, together whatever we do
