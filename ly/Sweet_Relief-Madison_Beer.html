		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please leave, Godspeed
I can't be around you right now, don't speak
It's a problem, it's addictive, I need
You to listen to me, baby, listen to me

Take me high (take me high)
Lay me down (lay me down)
It's so reckless of me but this feeling is deeply profound

It's just something only we know
Baby, I can't help myself
I'm seeing you everywhere I go
I don't dream of anyone else
All I need, sweet relief
It's just something only we know
Something only we know

Can't eat, can't sleep
No, you're not making this easy on me
It's a problem that we're choosing to be
No, we won't let 'em see (no, we won't let 'em see)

Take me high (high)
Lay me down (lay me down)
It's so reckless of me but this feeling is deeply profound

It's just something only we know (we know)
Baby, I can't help myself
I'm seeing you everywhere I go
I don't dream of anyone else
All I need, sweet relief
It's just something only we know
Something only we know

Oh
Something only we know
Oh-oh-oh
Something only we know

All I need, sweet relief
It's just something only we know
Something only we know
