		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Thought I'd never be waking on the kitchen floor
But here I lie, not the first time
Now my morning has broken, and it brings the fear
My mind's falling, falling

Then I feel my pulse quickening
But regrets can't change anything
Yeah, I feel my pulse quickening
When your name lights up the screen

Oh joy, when you call me
I was giving up, oh, I was giving in
Joy, set my mind free
I was giving up, oh, I was giving in

How'd you always know when I'm down?
How'd you always know when I'm down?

Take a walk through the wreckage, clearing out my head
I hear your eyes roll right down the phone
I'm your walking disaster, keep on dragging me
From self-pity, poor me

Then I feel my pulse quickening
But I wouldn't change a thing

Oh joy, when you call me
I was giving up, oh, I was giving in
Joy, set my mind free
I was giving up, oh, I was giving in

How'd you always know when I'm down?
How'd you always know when I'm down?

As the night dissolves into this final frame
You're a sweet relief, you saved me from my brain
From my brain, from my brain, from my brain (brain, brain, brain, brain)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa (brain, brain, brain, brain)

Oh joy, when you call me
I was giving up, oh, I was giving in
Joy, set my mind free
I was giving up, oh, I was giving in

How'd you always know when I'm down?
How'd you always know when I'm down?

I feel joy when you call me
I feel joy when you call me (I-I-I feel joy)
I feel joy when you call me
I feel joy when you call me
How'd you always know when I'm down?
How'd you always know when I'm down?
