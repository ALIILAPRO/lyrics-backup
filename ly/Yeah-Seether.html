		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can’t remember a better day
One without giving up
The shine has worn off the things you say
It’s just not good enough
I need to take this back and slow it down, shine your crown
I can’t pretend that I feel the same
My skin’s not thick enough

There’s no comfort in song
I find it hard to believe

Don’t go gently into the night
But keep on fighting as the light dies
A wise man knows that the dark’s right
But will keep on coming, keep on coming on
Some will tell you that it’s all right
The sun is burning in a dead sky
But you can’t keep living in a broke mind
So keep on running, keep on coming on

There is nothing that you can say
To bring me running back
My mind is reeling but its ok
The storm is pushing back
Another open mouth to cut me down, let me drown
I can’t remember a better day
But I’m not coming back

There’s no comfort in song
I find it hard to believe

So don’t go gently into the night
But keep on fighting as the light dies
A wise man knows that the dark’s right
But will keep on coming, keep on coming on
Some will tell you that it’s all right
The sun is burning in a dead sky
But you can’t keep living in a broke mind
So keep on running, keep on coming on

So don’t go gently into the night
But keep on fighting as the light dies
A wise man knows that the dark’s right
But will keep on coming, keep on coming on
Some will tell you that it’s all right
But the sun is burning in a dead sky
But you can’t keep living in a broke mind
So keep on running, keep on coming on

Keep on coming, keep on coming on
Some will tell you that it’s all right
That the sun is burning in a dead sky
But you can’t keep living in a broke mind
So keep on running, keep on coming on
