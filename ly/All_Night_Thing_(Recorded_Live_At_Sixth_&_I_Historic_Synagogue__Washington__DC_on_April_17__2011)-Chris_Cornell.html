		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She motioned to me
That she wanted to leave
And go somewhere warm
Where we'd be alone

Well, I do not know what's going on
Yeah, but I'm guessing
I'm guessing it's an all night thing
Yeah, it's an all night thing

If it's an all night thing
Nobody's gonna make it end
And if it don't begin, no
Don't worry that I'll take offence

If it's an all night thing
And we fall like a tear falling to the ground
I'll never come around
You'll never hear a word from me, yeah
If it's an all night thing

Well, I walked along
I was feeling at ease
And falling like rain
Ooh, into her scheme

She won't let on what that'll be, yeah
Oh, but I'm guessing
I'm guessing it's an all night thing, yeah
Oh, it's an all night thing

If it's an all night thing
Nobody's gonna make it end
And if it don't begin, no
Don't worry that I'll take offence

Hey, if it's an all night thing
And we fall like a tear falling to the ground
I'll never come around
And you'll never hear a word from me, yeah
If it's an all night thing

If it's an all night thing
If it's an all night thing
Yeah, if it's an all night thing, oh

Thank you
