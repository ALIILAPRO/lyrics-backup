		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Across the ocean, seen a thousand shores
Always searching for a soul like yours
There's no limit to the light you bring
Came with nothing, leave with everything

You give me that
You give me that sunlight, moonlight, just one night
You give me that
You give me that sunlight, moonlight, I know this time

For once in my life, I've got nothing to lose
I've got rips in my jeans, I got holes in my shoes
For once in my life, there's a moment of truth
Under the skyline tonight, yeah, I found it with you

Across the ocean, seen a thousand shores
Always searching for a soul like yours
There's no limit to the light you bring
Came with nothing, leave with everything, ah, ah

You give me that sunlight, moonlight, just one night 
You give me that sunlight, moonlight, I know this time

For once in my life, I've got nothing to lose
I've got rips in my jeans, I got holes in my shoes
For once in my life, there's a moment of truth
Under the skyline tonight, yeah, I found it with you

For once in my life, I've got nothing to lose
I've got rips in my jeans, I got holes in my shoes
For once in my life, there's a moment of truth
Under the skyline tonight, yeah, I found it with you
