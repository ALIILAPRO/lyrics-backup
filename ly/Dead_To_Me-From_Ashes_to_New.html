		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We've been headed for a breakdown
Stranded in a toxic state of mind
And I've been burning for a way out
I'll strike a match and then I'll say goodbye

When I see your face, I wanna get away
And just the thought of the pain makes me suffocate
You're everything I hate and nothing I need
You're dead to me

Never again
No, you can't pretend
The blood on your hands will wash away
You fucked with my head
Ripped my heart from my chest
Now nothing is left, you're dead to me

Never again
You're dead to me

You never recognize your issues
But you're the center of my misery
And after everything we've been through
I like you better in my history

You became the life I wish I never had
You tried to sell me a lie, that you're my better half
And now you live in a past I wanna delete
You're dead to me

Never again
No, you can't pretend
The blood on your hands will wash away
You fucked with my head
Ripped my heart from my chest
Now nothing is left, you're dead to me

Never again
You're dead to me
You're dead to me inside
So get the fuck out of my life

You don't have to die
To be dead to me inside
It's time for you to walk away
Get the fuck out of my life
'Cause I've given up, I've had enough
You're dead to me inside
I've given up, I've had enough
Get the fuck out of my life

Never again
No, you can't pretend
The blood on your hands will wash away
You fucked with my head
Ripped my heart from my chest
Now nothing is left, you're dead to me
Never again
You're dead to me
