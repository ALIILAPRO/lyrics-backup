		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah, shit, I'm just workin' in the studio
Ah, okay
You miss me?
Papa
Callin' me "Papa"?
I want you, Papa
Aight (you always talking about it), I'll call you right back

You always talkin' about it, uh
You never makin' no profit, uh
I treat my hoes like a option
If she talkin' and get out of pocket, ooh
I'm livin' life like a rockstar
Pullin' up, stretch limousines
To look at me, that cost a fee
Them double C's all on my feet
You always talkin' about it, yeah
You always talkin' about it
You say that you rappin' in private, yeah
But I see that you cap about it
Livin' life like a rockstar
Pullin' up, stretch limousines
To look at me, that cost a fee
Them double C's all on my feet

I changed my color to Nipsey blue
Your racks, it get small, that shit pitiful
If you tryna get so physical
That .45 will make you invisible
I'm livin' my life like a criminal
I call this shit First 48
We quiet, there's no one to blame, yeah
My lawyer said we beat the case
I'm livin' my life, celebration
I'm thankin' the Lord, I got patience
I'm lovin' the way that she take it
I bend it, I fold it, I flip it
She bringin' it back just to prove it
I'm givin' her work just to move it, yeah
I'm livin' the life that I'm choosin', yeah
I'm gettin' these racks, gettin' stupid, yeah

You always talkin' about it, uh
You never makin' no profit, uh
I treat my hoes like a option
If she talkin' and get out of pocket, ooh
I'm livin' life like a rockstar
Pullin' up, stretch limousines
To look at me, that cost a fee
Them double C's all on my feet
You always talkin' about it, yeah
You always talkin' about it
You say that you rappin' in private, yeah
But I see that you cap about it
Livin' life like a rockstar
Pullin' up, stretch limousines
To look at me, that cost a fee
Them double C's all on my feet

Pull up with the drum like I'm Tommy Lee 
Yaweh got a stick, came to rock with me (pew, pew, pew, pew, pew-pew)
Milli' on wrist, ain't no rocks on me
I'm pretty as fuck, wanna copy me (rocks on me, rocks on me)
I heard you was mad 'cause I'm poppin' as shit (wow)
I'm poppin' the 'pagne and I'm poppin' that bitch (wow)
I hop out a plane and went straight to the whip (ooh)
I know they can see, I think that's pretty cool if you askin' me
Bugatti, no body roll, curtains in back of the candy Rolls
I love when my lawyer calls, I hate when I run out of smoke
Pull up to the party, oh, and we like to party, oh
I finish the bottle, dawg, get this bitch jumpin', no Mario

You always talkin' about it, uh
You never makin' no profit, uh
I treat my hoes like a option
If she talkin' and get out of pocket, ooh
I'm livin' life like a rockstar
Pullin' up, stretch limousines
To look at me, that cost a fee
Them double C's all on my feet
You always talkin' about it, yeah
You always talkin' about it
You say that you rappin' in private, yeah
But I see that you cap about it
Livin' life like a rockstar
Pullin' up, stretch limousines
To look at me, that cost a fee
Them double C's all on my feet

Pull up with the drum like I'm Tommy Lee (still shit so)
Yaweh got a stick, came to rock with me (hard, cigarettes)
Milli' on wrist, ain't no rocks on me (cars, bedroom)
I'm pretty as fuck, wanna copy me (star, rocks on me)
Please don't save my life, oh

Pull up with the drum like I'm Tommy Lee (pew, pew, pew)
Yaweh got a stick, came to rock with me (pew, pew, pew)
Pull up with the drum like I'm Tommy Lee (pew, pew, pew)
