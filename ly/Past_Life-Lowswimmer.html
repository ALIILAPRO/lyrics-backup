		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It gets you bad
It gets you to pine for what you felt
Summer fell left a new line across my brow

Can't you tell?
Been circling signs along the belt
Me as well?
Auditioning time to call myself out

It pulls me aside
Tells me that I'm a coward too
A steeper incline to what I had
It'll take a long while yet
Before I was happy too
But I'm giving it time to kill it'self

I guess it's sad
It settled in stripes along my chest
What's next?
Live a long life, be someone else's

Yeah, I'm giving it time to hollow out
The brittle inside, the blackened shell
It hit's me all the time, I know it well
