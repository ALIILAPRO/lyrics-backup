		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's get this straight
To throw cost away
It only makes things worse
They try to take my life
And drag me down
The wanna be crucified
Bury it down when they realize
It doesn't justify
Their actions when everything falls from the sky
And I know it hurts (I know it hurts)
But it feels so good
Everyday I'm face with a new adversity
I tried my best to accept the fact
That you struck the match just to watch me burn
Swarming from the edge of my mind
Locked in the casket
Can't find my way out
Oh the deceivers
Now I'm left to find my peace
They seem to define my days
Can't find me
Consumed by fate
And it tastes so sweet
To know, my feet are under me
But I guess it's just the price to pay
When I close my eyes
And hold my breathe and pray that I don't suffocate
In the ghost of the day
Please make it go away
I paid the price of my body
If I fall please do not resuscitate me
D.N.R
One by one
We keep dropping like flies
Searching for something we will never find
Accepting submission
Just make the decision
We rise
Among the ashes
Undefiant
Rise from the ashes
We feed all as one
Locked in a hyper sense
We hunt to weed out the weak
As it's written
D.N.R
D.N.R
We hunt to weed out the weak
