		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Always over hill and dale
A wanderer walking in strides
Restlessly hitting the trail
On the dark or the sunny side

Keeping on a steady pace
Without leaving any trace
Used to nature of progress
A lot of well directed steps

Haunting the fields and the woods
Rather than the doors of men
Attending to his own moods
As a wilderness denizen

With a feeling soon renewed
Kind of withered over time
A severed stem far from its roots
Though blooming during his climb

Creeping in, the cold
Invades his inner stronghold

The icy quiver running through his bones
Reminds him suddenly that he was gone
For way too long
Too far, alone

Wherever this one is traveling
Welcomed, expected or despised
By a fireside or a chilling wind
Even-tempered, such is the wise

Not a beggar, to stay when spurned
He can't be drawn in any strife
And never got his fingers burned
By possessions, such is his life

Good-natured like the stray cat
A sense of gratitude for his beloved independence
When done with society, he's taking a step back
Just goes off quietly somewhere by himself

Surveyor of human soul
Monarch of lands that lies fallow
Honored of all he must not do against his will
And rich with all that he can afford to drop out of his hands

Most rewards are expensively sold
For attendance, curtsies and praise
Most properties are not worth this pile of gold
Gauged in time, measured in precious days

Growing, the annoyance
Abrades his inner balance

The many frictions disturbing his mind
Weaken his detachment, strengthen his view
To stay aloof
From humankind

Wherever this one is traveling
Welcomed, expected or despised
By a fireside or a chilling wind
Even-tempered, such is the wise

Not a beggar, to stay when spurned
He can't be drawn in any strife
And never got his fingers burned
By possessions, such is his life

Good-natured like the stray cat
A sense of gratitude for his beloved independence
When done with society, he's taking a step back
Just goes off quietly somewhere by himself
