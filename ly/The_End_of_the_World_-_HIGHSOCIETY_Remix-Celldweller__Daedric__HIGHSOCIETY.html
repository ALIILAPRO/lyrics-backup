(I believe in a dream)
(Is anyone out there?)

Watch as we spit in the face of fire
Everyone, everywhere, we’re all liars
I’m the only one who’s so sick and tired
I’m the only one who’s so sick and tired

So sick, so tired
Watch as we spit in the face of fire
So sick, so tired
Everyone, everywhere, we’re all liars
So sick, so tired
I’m the only one who’s so sick and tired
So sick, so tired

I don’t believe it’s the end of the world
The end of the world
It’s the end of the world
The end of the world

Is there anybody else out there?
Is there anybody else out there?
("Watch me rock like this")

Sold on a dream
Of a future serene
Hopes in a dream
Are not what they seem

It’s the end of the world
It’s the end of the world
It’s the end of the world
It’s the end of the world

And now it feels like the end of the world

Sold on a dream
Of a future serene
Why does this feel like the end of the world?
Hopes in a dream
are not what they seem
And now it feels like the end of the world
(The end of the world)
(End of the world)
I can’t believe it’s the end of the world
(I believe)
I won’t believe it’s the end of the world
(In a dream)
I don’t believe it’s the end of the world
(Is anyone out there?)

Hopes in a dream are not what they seem
(As it burns to the ground they smile)
And now it feels like the end of the world
(Everyone, everywhere, all liars)
I won't believe it's the end of the world
(As it burns to the ground they smile)
(I believe in a dream)
I don't believe it's the end of the world
(Everyone, everywhere, all liars)

Try to remember if I’ve ever felt things were so dire
Do I feed into the need to be reconciled?
As it burns to the ground they smile
"Attention all survivors"
Is there anybody else out there?
"If you can hear this message, please make your way to our location-"

Sold on a dream
Of a future serene
Hopes in a dream
Are not what they seem

End of the world
("Bring it!")
("Watch me rock like this")
End of the world
("Let's go!")
("Watch me rock like this")

Sold on a dream
Of a future serene
Hopes in a dream
Are not what they seem

End of the world
