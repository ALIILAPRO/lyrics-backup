		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't need to listen to what they say
In a confused world of constant frights
Nothing to expect from what they've made
You just have to drive your inner light
Come now
They don't care about you and I
Come now
It doesn't matter what they think about
Walled in by the rules they've created
Ravenous scavengers in distress
An insatiable appetite to fill
Now we have to enter resilience
Come now
They don't care about you and I
Come now
It doesn't matter what they think about
