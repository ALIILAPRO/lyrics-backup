		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me tell you a story about these two guys
That eventually became brothers
You got this kid named Tune
Tunechi, some shit like that
Straight out of 17th of New Orleans
Been rich since he was like thirteen, fourteen years old
He came with his own style
They tried to steal his shit
He ended up puttin' the whole game on his back
Had clientele for years and always had good product
And then you got Slim from the Southside of Atlanta
Loved playin' basketball, he a real mama's boy
And that's how he got the name Tity Boi
Slicker than a spill of oil
Soon as he got his hands on his first pack and flipped that
He never looked back
And when they met up and devised a plan
On how to take over the land
Kinda went like this
Welcome 2 Collegrove
