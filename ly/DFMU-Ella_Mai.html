		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like a glimpse from the past, you conceal the dark
In a frame, you're the poster up on the wall
In my dreams, you the prince and I'm at the ball
Fairytales, I'm not used to them at all

You got me questioning, "What have you done to me?"
Used to be out of reach
Feel like you're testin' me, you're the necessity
Full court press on me

Don't fuck me up, don't let me down
You know I wanna be around
You tuggin', warrin' with my heart
Didn't think it'd ever be so hard
Crazy, I'm lettin' down my guard
Don't fuck me up, don't let me down
'Cause if it's love, I wanna drown
I need to hear it from your mouth
Can't wait no longer, tell me now
Don't fuck me up, don't let me down

Such a risk, but I'm willin' to take a chance
What you think with my heart sittin' in your hand?
Gotta learn how to let someone in to hold
It take time, gotta trust who I let control

Got me questioning, "What have you done to me?"
Used to be out of reach
Feel like you're testin' me, you're the necessity
Full court press on me (oh)

Don't fuck me up, don't let me down
You know I wanna be around
You tuggin', warrin' with my heart
Didn't think it'd ever be so hard
Crazy I'm lettin' down my guard
Don't fuck me up, don't let me down
'Cause if it's love I wanna drown
I need to hear it from your mouth
Can't wait no longer, tell me now
Don't fuck me up, don't let me down

If you really care for me
Just make sure you're there for me
Feel I'm fallin' in too deep
That's okay, just rescue me
Let me know what you want from me
Open up, let me in and see, boy
Yeah, I know where I wanna be (wanna be)
Just wanna know what your lovin' means, oh (oh-ooh, yeah)

Don't fuck me up, don't let me down
You know I wanna be around
You tuggin', warrin' with my heart (my heart)
Didn't think it'd ever be so hard (it'd ever be so hard)
Crazy, I'm lettin' down my guard (oh, yeah)
Don't fuck me up, don't let me down (don't fuck me up, don't let me down)
'Cause if it's love, I wanna drown (I wanna drown, oh)
I need to hear it from your mouth
Can't wait no longer, tell me now
Don't fuck me up, don't let me down

Don't let me down, don't let me down, let me down
Hey-yeah
Don't fuck me up, up
Don't let me down, down
Don't fuck me up, don't let me down
