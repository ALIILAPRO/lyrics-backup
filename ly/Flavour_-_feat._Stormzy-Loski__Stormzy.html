Okay miss, what's your flavor?
Do me a favor
Do not do me any favors
Okay miss, what's your flavor?
Do me a favor
Do not do me any favors

Okay miss, what's your flavor?
I can't really focus since you popped up on my radar
All those dirty texts you were sending on my iPhone
I might have to punish you for all that misbehavior, flavor
Yo little miss, what's the chances?
Niggas get excited when you see the way she dances
Told her don't compare me to these guys, I am the king here
All these little rappers spending all of their advances, aw shit
Yo pretty woman, what's your game like?
Pull up to your crib, and then I fix you like a brake light
I can your boyfriend doesn't give you what you ask for
You can write a little list of things that I should make right (shape right)
Ay Stormz, she look better without makeup
That's just my opinion, cute little slim ting
You know that I'm the in ting, both of us are win-win
Throw it or a quinting, save it for later, aya

Okay miss, what's your flavor?
Do me a favor
Do not do me any favors
Okay miss, what's your flavor?
Do me a favor
Do not do me any favors
Okay miss, what's your flavor?
Do me a favor
Do not do me any favors
Okay miss, what's your flavor?
Do me a favor
Do not do me any favors

Ooh baby, tell me what's the drama?
Kisses on your neck a bit of Louis, bit of Prada
Late-night joking, giving it the haha
Rocking with a G, B I grew up in the Gaza wagwan
They are out of tune and I love that
I ain't into games, if you leave you can't come back
Texting on her iPhone, she say that I like hoes
I'll be like "Slow down, baby, no palava" uh uh
Ooh baby tell me what's the drama?
Saw her get excited when she found out I'm from Ghana
I can't really figure out her flavor but she's fruity
Do it like I'm belly squad and give her the banana, ana
Tell me little miss, how's you're day been?
Sorry, I no answerin' these questions, must be drainin'
I could be the sweet boy, street boy, punching out his teeth boy
And everybody love me like I'm Raymond
(Cold)

Okay miss, what's your flavor?
Do me a favor
Do not do me any favors
Okay miss, what's your flavor?
Do me a favor
Do not do me any favors
Okay miss, what's your flavor?
Do me a favor
Do not do me any favors
Okay miss, what's your flavor?
Do me a favor
Do not do me any favors

Now I'm with the stars, it's like constellation
If I put your name in my songs, you'll be famous
When I'm not around, you just put me onto your playlist
Bankroll baby, I ball like the Lakers
Champagne faded smoking on the flavors
I got haters, fuck it, I get paper
Word to J. Cole, she a ho, I can't save her
Keep switching beats but really the drill savior later
Can't talk now, baby, later
From 13 with the hunnas like major
It's, bummy cah it got what I asked for
Tellin' me you love me, do you put me in your prayer-ayer?
And ooh girl, tell me would you pray for me? stay for me?
Had a really really long day, bill a J for me
I need my lady and my plug look
Stiff chocolate, I'm still the flavor of the month, sure

Okay miss, what's your flavor?
Do me a favor
Do not do me any favors
Okay miss, what's your flavor?
Do me a favor
Do not do me any favors
Okay miss, what's your flavor?
Do me a favor
Do not do me any favors
Okay miss, what's your flavor?
Do me a favor
Do not do me any favors
Okay miss, what's your flavor?
Do me a favor
Do not do me any favors
Okay miss, what's your flavor?
Do me a favor
Do not do me any favors
