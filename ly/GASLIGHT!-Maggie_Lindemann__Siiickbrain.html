		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, turn down the volume or we're all gonna go deaf

Gaslight, joyride, landslide, fuck life
Twist the knife, broken heart and paralyzed
Gaslight, joyride, landslide, fuck life
Watch your back, lead me to a homicide

Where do you think
Where do you think you're goin'?
Baby, are you lost
Or just lost in the moment?
Baby, are you lonely
Or just lonely for me?
Where do you think
Where do you think you're goin'?

Come and find me in the lost and found
Baby, listen, can you hear me out?
I'm only in pain when you're not around
Come and find me in the lost and found
Kissing on her neck when you're not around
Shouldn't love a girl just to tear her down

Gaslight, joyride, landslide, fuck life
Twist the knife, broken heart and paralyzed
Gaslight, joyride, landslide, fuck life
Watch your back, lead me to a homicide

Where do you think
Where do you think you're goin'?
Baby, are you lost
Or just lost in the moment?
Baby, are you lonely
Or just lonely for me?
Where do you think
Where do you think you're goin'?

Tell me before it's too late
Your words will dig your own grave
It's time to choose your own fate
Leave me lonely or kill you slowly

Gaslight, joyride, landslide, fuck life
Twist the knife, broken heart and paralyzed
Gaslight, joyride, landslide, fuck life
Watch your back, lead me to a homicide

Where do you think
Where do you think you're goin'?
Baby, are you lost
Or just lost in the moment?
Baby, are you lonely
Or just lonely for me?
Where do you think
Where do you think you're goin'?
