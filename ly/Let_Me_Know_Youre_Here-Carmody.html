		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Told myself that I'm not going out of my mind.
That there's no constant, a different blue in each turning tide. 
Wonder what you'd think of this world you can't see.
Ten thousand phones lighting up on the Common as they weep.
And oh call me when you're home, let me know so I can get some sleep. 
And oh call me when you're home, let me know so I can get some sleep. 

So hold me let me know you're 
hold me let me know you're here
let me know you're here 

They told me that I'd feel you
told me we don't disappear 
can't just disappear 

Told myself that I'll try and make sense of it all
That I'll find a way out all the sadness, look up each time you call.
Turn my palms to the sky as if I could feel that there's something beyond all the sadness and I could learn to heal.

And oh call me when you're home, let me know so I can get some sleep. 
And oh call me when you're home, let me know so I can get some sleep. 

So hold me let me know you're 
hold me let me know you're here
let me know you're here 

They told me that I'd feel you
told me we don't disappear 
can't just disappear 

To all I can't change, still unfolding 
To all I couldn't name when he told me 
Though all's been unmade I'm still hoping 

So hold me let me know you're 
hold me let me know you're here
let me know you're here 

They told me that I'd feel you
told me we don't disappear 
can't just disappear
