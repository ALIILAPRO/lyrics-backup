		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It might look good on paper
But it's a nightmare in the flesh
Put your happy ending on hold
It's not happening just yet
She's an authentic replica
A killjoy all the same
Peer pressure complexion
Her reputation's a trainwreck
Oh, your waters, they run deep
Had me jamming on repeat
Before I ever met you
I used to be happy

Oh, after love in the after hours
I buried what I thought about you

Baby's got a gun, got a gun to my head now
Cutting me off from my family and friends
And I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here
Baby's got a gun, got a gun to my head now
Knows what to say to keep me in a cage
And I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here

I trusted you like a newborn
Deception was your a-art form
To faze you I'm in the right
You used to love to fuck me up
Why don't you crack me open?
Empty what spills out
I let you have your moment
'Cause it's all you care about

After love in the after hours
I buried what I thought about you

Baby's got a gun, got a gun to my head now
Cutting me off from my family and friends
And I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here
Baby's got a gun, got a gun to my head now
Knows what to say to keep me in a cage
And I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here

Going 'round and 'round in circles
Need to break this cycle
You acted so entitled
Checking all my vitals
You made me want to die
Fill my heart with lies
Got away with that a thousand times
The worst days of my life
I know I'm far from perfect
But I believed in myself at times
(I buried what I thought about you)

Baby's got a gun, got a gun to my head now
Cutting me off from my family and friends
And I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here
Baby's got a gun, got a gun to my head now
Knows what to say to keep me in a cage
And I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here

After love in the after hours
I buried what I thought about you
And baby's got a gun, got a gun to my head
Baby's got a gun, got a gun to my head
Baby's got a gun, got a gun to my head
Baby's got a gun, got a gun to my head
