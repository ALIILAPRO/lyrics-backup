		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hear your voice
But it never quite fills the void
Thought that we were two for good
But love is never like it should
I can arrange meeting a stranger, forget you a day
But I can't imagine what even happens beyond the pain (mmm)

See the sun leading us
To the land of the lost and the reasonless
Hear the drum beating us
I forever surrender

I don't wanna live
A meaningless
I don't wanna live
A meaningless
Life without you (oh-oh)
Life without you (oh-oh)

I'm tired of good boys sleepin' on my chest
You wanna rip my heart out, baby, be my guest
I hope you hear this song and reminisce
'Cause without me, your whole life is fuckin' meaningless

See the sun leading us
To the land of the lost and the reasonless
Hear the drum beating us
I forever surrender, the rest is meaningless
Meaningless

I don't wanna live
A meaningless
I don't wanna live
A meaningless
Oh, I've been wasting my twenties
Filling glasses half empty
I don't wanna live
A meaningless
Life without you

You've seen me down, you've seen me high
You've seen me dancing in the night
Now that you're gone, you leave me cryin'
Alone in this meaningless life
You've seen me down, you've seen me high
You've seen me dancing in the night
Now that you're gone, you leave me cryin'
Alone in this meaningless life
You've seen me down, you've seen me high
You've seen me dancing in the night
Now that you're gone, you leave me cryin'
Alone in this meaningless life

See the sun leading us
To the land of the lost and the reasonless
Hear the drum beating us
I forever surrender, the rest is meaningless
