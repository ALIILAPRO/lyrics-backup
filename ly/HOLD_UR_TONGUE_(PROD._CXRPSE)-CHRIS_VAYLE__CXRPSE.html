		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "She rides my dick till it's
Soft" I love you, chris Vayle
It is about that motherfuckin' time, aye

Wreck ya' whole city cause you shitty
Fuck a face card
Say you making penny? Boy, you petty
That's a day job
Fuck her 'til she dumbfounded
Like "What you say, huh?"
All you niggas jokers
Always choking when we play cards
Baby, you so sloppy
Give me toppy in the back room
Ex-nigga bending over backwards like
A back do
Claiming that you hate me when you see me
Boy you act new always smell like piss
Got that bag and I'm trash too
You can't keep the pace, bitch
I'm speeding while you run
Why you always tripping? I can
Fix it just for fun
Black boot stomp your face
Same color as my lungs
If she a pretty bitch
She skinny dip in my cum
Always run your mouth, keep it
Down, hold your tongue, ayy
Always stand out, Vayle baby, one of one, ayy
Always hands out, you can't
Pick through my funds, ayy
Always in deep splash, pussy like a pond, ayy

Oh my fucking god, okay, okay

Watch your mouth, ayy, hold your tongue, ayy
Always quiet on the side that you on, ayy
Watch your mouth, ayy, hold your tongue, ayy
Always quiet on the side that you on, ayy
Watch your mouth, ayy, hold your tongue, ayy
Always quiet on the side that you on, ayy
Watch your mouth, ayy, hold your tongue, ayy
Always quiet on the side that you on, ayy
Watch your mouth, ayy, hold your tongue, ayy
Always quiet on the side that you on, ayy
Watch your mouth, ayy, hold your tongue, ayy
Always quiet on the side that you on, ayy
Always quiet on the side that you on, ayy
Always quiet on the side that you on, ayy
Watch your mouth, watch your
Mouth, watch your mouth, ayy
Always quiet on the side that you on, ayy
