		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time keeps, time keeps drippin' away
Bettin' days, it's a dangerous game that we play
We all get tired of the stories that come with our names
We're all still tryin' to figure it out anyway, mh

Do you look outside the window
When the sun goes down?
Do you hide yourself in the shadows
Of a lonely town?
Do you still dream of tomorrow
Bein' so much more?
Did you lose yourself in the universe
Wanderer?

Wanderer, oh

Silhouettes in the headlights on the street
Extras in a movie that we'll never see
Oh, we're all so scared of the things that we might never be
Ooh, spend our lives with our eyes wide open, asleep, oh

Do you look outside the window
When the sun goes down?
Do you hide yourself in the shadows
Of a lonely town?
Do you still dream of tomorrow
Bein' so much more?
Did you lose yourself in the universe
Wanderer?

Wanderer, oh
Wanderer, oh
