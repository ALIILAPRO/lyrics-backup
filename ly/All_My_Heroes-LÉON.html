		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Saturday night at the arcade
Silver coins in my hand
Ready to cause some damage
Saturday night at the arcade
Silver coins in his hand
Ready to cause some damage

He wakes up, he gets drunk
And he hides at this den
And always seems so alone
And I think I'm the same

All my heroes are dead and I don't believe in God
Who will save me from myself?
My heroes are dead and I don't believe in God
Who will save me from myself?
My heroes, all my heroes are dead

Saturday night, back at his place
Far away from the crowds
Where nobody can see us
I know that he's bringing me down
But I feel so alive
With his hands in my denim

He wakes up, he gets drunk
And he hides at this den
Always seem so alone
And I think we're the same
But he doesn't want me to change

All my heroes are dead and I don't believe in God
Who will save me from myself?
My heroes are dead and I don't believe in God
Who will save me from myself?
My heroes, all my heroes are dead
My heroes, all my heroes are dead

All my heroes are dead
All my heroes are dead
Who's gonna save my from myself?
