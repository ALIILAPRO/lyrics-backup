		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When she told me I’m a boss
'Cause I never take a loss
I’m the one
The one who set the beats on fire
Oh

Told her I am not a man
I don’t think you understand
That I’m the one
The one who get these bitches feeling higher
Oh

Yeah, yeah

Just a young pharaoh with Gucci apparel
I’m the one
The one who make these rappers wan’ retire
Oh

Yeezy taught me now I level up
Bass and treble up
I’m the one
The one who tryna make it through the wire
Oh

Told her little mama I got needs of my own
But she only need the keys to my Rover
Cop a couple Bentleys and a Rolls
Maybe I could drive em when I’m sober
Cop a couple chains on the low low low
And then she put one on like a choker
Diamonds in her spades at the club
But I know that in her heart she’s a joker

I don’t see no glitches
When it pop up with the digits on my phone
I’m just tryna make these riches
Ain’t nobody finna switch I’m on my own

That’s when she told me I’m a boss
'Cause I never take a loss
I’m the one
The one who set the beats on fire
Oh

Told her I am not a man
I don’t think you understand
That I’m the one
The one who get these bitches feeling higher
Oh

Yeah, yeah

Just a young pharaoh with Gucci apparel
I’m the one
The one who make these rappers wan’ retire
Oh

Yeezy taught me now I level up
Bass and treble up
I’m the one
The one who tryna make it through the wire
Oh
