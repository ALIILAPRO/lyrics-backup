		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was alright for a while, I could smile for a while
Then I saw you last night, you held my hand so tight
When you stopped to say, "Hello"
You wished me well, you couldn't tell

That I'd been crying over you
Crying over you then you said, "So long"
Left me standing all alone
Alone and crying, 

Crying, crying, crying
It's hard to understand
That the touch of your hand
Can start me crying

I thought that I was over you
But it's true, so true
I love you even more than I did before
But darling what can I do?
For you don't love me and I'll always be

Crying over you
Crying over you
Yes, now you're gone
And from this moment on
I'll be crying, crying, crying, crying,
Crying, crying, over you
