		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Dee, you poppin' your shit, nigga)
(G, I think we got one)
Only love I ever felt was from my mama, on my mama
Miss my grandma, miss my uncle
Rest in peace Neff and Rece
Cash out, thick bitch from the Westside
Cashed out, no, this is not a S-Class
Maybach, I been turnin' up for my city
I been turnin' up for my city

Richie Rich, fuck her, then I leave, bitch, ain't no, "Give me kiss"
All or nothin', freak bitch call me Dugg and I don't call her number
She finessin', baby, I need a dime 
Baby, I need a, yeah, leave a message
Dawg, you known for doggin' hoes
Bae, I can't fuck all them hoes
Take her shoppin', she be fly
Hermes, Chanel, and Prada
Gucci coat matchin' my mama's
'21, brand new, no mileage
Fuck a nigga 'fore I start wildin'
Calm me down
Sixes, brown, tickin' bomb
Sippin' Dom Pérignon
Bitches fine, glizzy, nine
Play and get shot
I'm still missin' my pops
When is you gettin' out?
I been turnin' up for my city (turn me up)
I been turnin' up for my city

Tell Dess make me some noodles
Turn my young bitch to a shooter
Damn, I miss OG Double, taught me how to pimp and hustle
I go and hit a lick, you can go and ask Bubba
Uh, big blocks, totin' real choppers
Whole lotta shooters, you don't want no problems
R.I.P. Junebug, taught me in the broad day
Tryna pay this lawyer for my lil' ones, gon' be a cold case
Magic City, I'm the owner
Tell Steve Harvey I don't want her
One thing I never seen was a bitch that leave
Every time I crank the car, I don't use a key
Push-start, foreign whip
Two glizzies, extended clips
I don't go a day bein' sober
Pour a lotta dope in my soda
Magic City, I'm the owner
Tell Steve Harvey I don't want her
Sixes brown, tickin' bomb, sippin' Dom Pérignon
Big ridin', really, I'm a don
Made these bitches wait in line
I done came out the muddy
I done put the most white diamonds on the blackest hoes

I'm just turnin' up for my city (turn me up)
I'm just turnin' up for my city
I'm just turnin' up for my city (turn me up)
I been turnin' up for my city
Grandma, daddy, mama, sister, I been through so much lately
Run it up and stash it, damn near two million on that mattress
CMG, that's who I signed to, but I like my pockets full
I got my game from the streets, I barely went to school
I know nine Dugg, slow down, shawty
Four times, I don't really like to squash 
On my daddy, on my mama
I don't really like to squash
