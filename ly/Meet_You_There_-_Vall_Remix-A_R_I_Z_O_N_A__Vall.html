		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where the road ends and the wilderness begins
When the dam breaks and the water's pourin' in
When your voice cracks and no words can fill the space
In the middle of the night, no hope, no love, no faith
Won't have to be alone, waitin' there for long

'Cause I will meet you there
I will meet you there
No, you're not lost
You're right where you're supposed to be
So just keep breathin'
And I will meet you there

When you lose the sun and your compass starts to spin
It's gettin' dark now and the fear is settin' in
Neck-high in the muddy water's the deepest you'll ever be
In the middle of the night, no hope, no rest, no peace
Oh, but you won't have to be alone, waitin' there for long

'Cause I will meet you there
I will meet you there
No, you're not lost
You're right where you're supposed to be
So just keep breathin'
Whoa, and I will meet you there
Whoa, I will meet you there
I will meet you there
I will meet you there

And when the winds the change, you'll be headed home at last
Steady on now, 'fore you know it, you'll be back
And I will meet you there
And I will meet you there
