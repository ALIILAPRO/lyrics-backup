		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, I've been driving all over the town
On my cellphone wearin' it out
And I finally tracked you down

Hey, everybody says you're the man
The final piece to my master plan
You got my world in the palm of your hand

Well I know that you got it
Come on and just sell it
Got the cash up in my pocket
You know I gotta get it

Hey mister won't you sell me a fake ID
There's a band in the bar that I'm dying to see
I got my money and you got what I need
Hey mister won't you sell me a fake ID

Hey, don't even think about tellin' me no
It's only twenty minutes 'till the show
Hey mister turn it over let's go

No, I ain't gonna need a receipt
Just make sure that it looks like me
So the bouncer don't call the police

And don't tell my daddy
Stole the keys to his caddy
Don't dilly dally
I gotta get the hell out of this alley

Hey mister won't you sell me a fake ID
There's a band in the bar that I'm dying to see
I got my money and you got what I need
Hey mister won't you sell me a fake ID

Here's my money, now get out of my way
Gonna push my luck right up to the stage

Hey mister won't you sell me a fake ID
There's a band in the bar that I'm dying to see
I got my money and you got what I need
Hey mister, hey mister

Hey mister won't you sell me a fake ID
There's a band in the bar that I'm dying to see
I got my money and you got what I need
Hey mister won't you sell me a fake ID

Hey mister won't you sell me a fake ID
There's a band in the bar that I'm dying to see
I got my money and you got what I need
Hey mister won't you sell me a fake ID
Hey mister, hey mister
