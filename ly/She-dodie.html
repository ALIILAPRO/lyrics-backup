		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Am I allowed to look at her like that
Could it be wrong when she's just so nice to look at
 
And she smells like lemongrass and sleep
She tastes like apple juice and peach
Oh, you would find her in a polaroid picture
And she means everything to me
(Oh)
 
I'd never tell
No I'd never say a word
And oh it aches
But it feels oddly good to hurt
 
She smells like lemongrass and sleep
She tastes like apple juice and peach
Oh, you would find her in a polaroid picture
And she means everything to me
 
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
 
and I'll be okay
Admiring from afar
Cause even when she's next to me
We could not be more far apart
Cause she tastes like birthday cake, and storytime, and fall
But to her I taste of nothing at all
 
And she smells like lemongrass and sleep
She tastes like apple juice and peach
You would find her in a polaroid picture
And she means everything to me
Yes she means everything to me
She means everything to me.
