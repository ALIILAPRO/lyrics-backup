		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  release
revive
reverse
retire
the hearse
give grace
it's tough to stay in shape

regenerative medicine
we're so focused on extending our lifespan
we mustn't want everything
we mustn't want everything we can

methuselahs of depravity
obsessed with youth and longevity
we must embrace the brevity
for the only way to end eternal life is suicide

let it all begin 
just another time
sweet dreams
let it all begin again
and never ever learn from our mistakes
let it all begin

picture a world when anybody, anywhere 
anytime can rebuild an entire organ
all the way from a stem cell and regenerate
on command any metabolic process 
revert back to pluripotent cells
and halt for good the ageing process
overcome, bend the laws of nature
parabiosis 

reverse the curse of ageing
regrowing hair and youthful skin
instant rejuvenation to a younger state
parabiosis

regrowing hair and youthful skin
instant regeneration to a healthy state
ambrosia for each and for everyone of us
fix any part as often as you must
any broken part

homo deus
by removing death 
from our lives 
how different has our world become?
we stay young 'til thy kingdom come

face death, effacing death
from our every day lives, 
tell me just how clean have we become?
how safe have we become?
how bleak has it become?
how dead have we become?

this is our earthly kingdom
we've settled down here to stay
for we shall live forever and a day

replenish, recharge our batteries
eternal youth at our fingertips
we mustn't want everything
we mustn't want everything we can

the illusive promise of paradise 
representing a denial of earthly life 
is no longer projected into the heavens
it's embedded within earthly life itself
