		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby I don't sleep all night and day
I don't wanna throw this night away
I just wanna dance when you're with me
I come alive
I come alive babe
Baby I don't sleep all night and day
I don't wanna throw this night away
I just wanna dance when you're with me
I come alive
I come alive babe
Oeh Girl
When I look inside you're eyes I slowly die
I don't wanna realise that we're alive
I don't wanna break you're hearth but I'm falling
I don't wanna waste you're time to say goodbye
Oeh Girl
When I look inside you're eyes I slowly die
I don't wanna realise that we're alive
I don't wanna break you're hearth but I'm falling
I'm falling for you
Baby I don't sleep all night and day
I don't wanna throw this night away
I just wanna dance when you're with me
I come alive
I come alive babe
Baby I don't sleep all night and day
I don't wanna throw this night away
I just wanna dance when you're with me
I come alive
I come alive babe
I can't ignore the night before
You that I'll keep wondering about it
I feel like I just don't belong
I know that' I'll keep wondering about it
I just wanna dance
Moving to the beat
And you know I won't let go
Keep me company
I own a lot of things
But love is what I need
And you know I won't let go
Cause it's my remedy
Baby I don't sleep all night and day
I don't wanna throw this night away
I just wanna dance when you're with me
I come alive
I come alive babe
Baby I don't sleep all night and day
I don't wanna throw this night away
I just wanna dance when you're with me
I come alive
I come alive babe
I just wanna dance
Moving to the beat
And you know I won't let go
Keep me company
I own a lot of things
But love is what I need
And you know
I just wanna dance
Moving to the beat
I just wanna dance
And you know
