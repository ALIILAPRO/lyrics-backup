		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stakes, washed away, washed away
I'm burning down

Roll up, and I light a
Fucking match to the gas, no gas mask
Make it splash, and all of a sudden
I'm getting ashes
Lasting more than I can fathom
Mass appeal is real it seems
Mass didn't appeal to me
Six-six-six, wrists glisten 'cause of slit's
Heads missing, so I split
Driven apathy, actually traffic
No tragic car accidents happen
You're just a fucking blip
It only matters 'cause
We're matter scatterin'
Around a hole that gets blacker

Stakes, washed away, washed away
I'm burning down
Stakes, washed away, washed away
Hold up before I blow up hold up before-
I'm burning down

Hold up before I blow up
Give me one more time, I can pour up
Got the wheels spinnin'
But my blood's thinning
Oddy telling me that it's time to
Quit it but I can't, i'll faint
Just one little taste real quick
So I get straight
I'm so in debt with this shit, I can't pay
I'm so in love with this shit, I can't think
Mind gone blank
I just keep sinking, ducked out, sleeping
These drugs my weakness
Seek this money, wrist keep bleeding (Ooh)
And it's seeming that the death of
Me is gonna be these demons

Sold my soul to Satan waiting
In line at the mall
Stakes, washed away, washed away
I got six phones, I got six homes
I got a grave six feet tall i'm burning down
Stakes what do I know?
Failed chemistry washed away, washed away
Hated religion, fuck it all i'm burning down

Stakes, washed away, washed away
I'm burning down
