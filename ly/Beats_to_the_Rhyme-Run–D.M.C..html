		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  DJ's and MC's, coming up next is the one and only incredible, Jam Master
Yo, back up off the ropes, punk

Beats to the rhyme, the rhyme I just made
Party at the jammie til lights the night fade
Trooping for the feature we all get paid 
So let's go

Yo! D that's me, the King, the MC
Rhyme get mine on the t-o-p
Can another MC ever rock this beat? (Hell yeah)

It's like the A the be to the see
It's easier than (One, two, three)
(He's Jam Master Jay, I'm D.M.C.)
So here's Run
It's time for we to cease (So what?)
So rhymers speak your peace
Why? Cause you can't touch (Jam Master Jay)
Cause he's number (One, two, three, four, hit it)
Dance to the rhythm, the rhyme, the cold flow
Chance to give em is done I told yo
For these routines like 1983
It's just a little reminder
So those suckas is kinder
A little message from (Run-D.M.C.)

Cuts for days will amaze and maze
But will make you sad to tan all the dance aways
Got the mic, the man, the master plan
But the ram, the jam
(Know I am?) Goddamn!
Spins he wins, clocking MS ends
To his friends he lends, lotta joy he sends
Jay lose today, this is what I say
(Dick in your mouth all day)

My beats were played and laid rhymes made
Jay DJ'ed and I got paid
Made something out of nothing (Yo D that's true)
Yes my brother I would do it for you
I roam in the zone of the microphone
And I'm on the throne but I'm not alone
Got bones of steel and not of stone
I'm known to be prone and make your momma moan

Time for the rhyme so let the stars shine
Shame for the fame and the name combined
Run for the fun but you can gimme your ring
Show I gotta go so now a word from the King

Hardcore, rhymes galore, giving you more
And like I said before
Beats to the rhyme the name of this jam
D that's me and that's who I am
Rocking on the mic cause you know I can
You gotta understand I don't give a damn

Jay hit a play today I must say
Hooray to the way that is A-OK
As we wax the tracks all the DJ's play
With (dick in your mouth)
A little (dick in your mouth)
A big (dick in your mouth all day)
