		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Show me what you really got
Show me what you're looking for
Nothing can dare stop me now
All, for the gold nothing more, nothing less
You know me, right?

I don't give a damn about what you mean
I ain't fighting for the shit that you seek
I don't care about whatever you say
You won't make it out alive in my hand
Come closer, babe
Are you afraid?
Won't take long while
Kick'em out

Kick'em out
Let me go my way
I'll get what I've waited for
Kick'em out (everything you ever longed to be)
Kick'em out (those who're chasing their own fantasy)
Things will go my way
You'll get what you've paid for
Kick'em out

Show me what you really got
Show me what you're looking for
I only chase what pleases me most
One like cash thrilling shots, things like that
You got me, right?

I don't give a damn about what you mean
I ain't fighting for the shit that you seek
I don't care about whatever you say
You won't make it out alive in my hand
Come closer, babe
Are you afraid?
Won't take long while
Kick'em out

Kick'em out
Let me go my way
I'll get what I've waited for
Kick'em out (everything you ever longed to be)
Kick'em out (Those who're chasing their own fantasy)
Things will go my way
You'll get what you've paid for

Kick'em out
Kick'em out
Let me go my way
I'll get what I've waited for
Kick'em out (everything you ever longed to be)
Kick'em out (those who're chasing their own fantasy)
Things will go my way
You'll get what you've paid for
Kick'em out
