		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Aye aye aye
God damn I don't know where to start
Till about recently I was stuck up in the dark
Girl you just pretty and I love how you so smart
It makes so much sense why you the one that stole my heart
Spend my days wit you is all I want to do
So don't be shy baby just come thru
Always need you right here next to me
I ain't need no drug cuz you my only remedy

Whenever you're near it's more than just a feeling
Yeah I Caught a different vibe wit you from the beginning
Ay
Yuh
If this love shit was a game you know I would be winning
Kissing on yo forehead yeah whenever ur sad
You know I really fucking hate it girl whenever you're mad
Falling head over heels for you
I Break down in tears for you
Always treat you right yeah I'll always be real to you
My one and only fear I swear it gon be losing you
I never let you down
You help me turn my life around
You always on mind yeah even when you're not around
I'm with ya till the end
I'm tryna put you in that wedding gown
One more thing I need to get off my chest yeah
You my second half I just thought you should know
So baby please don't leave yeah baby please don't go

Aye aye aye
God damn I don't know where to start
Till about recently I was stuck up in the dark
Girl you just pretty and I love how you so smart
Yeah
It makes so much sense why you the one that stole my heart
Spend my days wit you is all I want to do
So don't be shy baby just come thru
Always need you right here next to me
I ain't need no drug cuz you my only remedy

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
