		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All these lights are changing
See them everywhere

In my veins like lightning 
I don't even care

And the crowd is heavy 
I don't wanna move
All these colors in me but all I see is you

And nothing else matters
You
Baby, it's you 
You
Baby, it's you
You
Baby, it's you
You
Baby, it's you 

All these painted faces singing back to me
There's an ocean here but you are all I see

And nothing else matters
You
Baby, it's you 
You
Baby, it's you
You
Baby, it's you
You
Baby, it's you 
You
Baby, it's you
You
Baby, it's you
You
Baby, it's you
Baby, it's you
Baby, it's you
