		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Guiding me all of my days
You know I'll follow Your ways
Never cease to amaze
And when it's dark You are ablaze
You're keeping me safe
You're giving me strength
You called me by name
And You'll do it again
And again and again and I

I can do anything with You
I can go anywhere with You
As long as You lead i'm gonna believe
We'll do impossible things, yeah
I got the victory
'Cause Jesus You live in me
And we're gonna win again and again

My God, my rock, my strength
My joy, my hope, my peace
That's all for me (Eyyy)
'Cause You're living in me
I'm fired up now nothing gonna stop me now
I'm fired up now nothing gonna stop me now

I've got the victory i'm unshakeable
'Cause Jesus You live in me
I'm unshakeable come on and say with me
I'm unshakeable hey, hey hey hey
I'm unshakeable

Okay, okay, okay, okay
I'll give You thanks for all You've done
And I'm never gonna stop nup, nup, nup
You strengthen me, blessing me
Holding me, moulding me, set me free
So I'll praise You again
And again and again

My God, my rock, my strength
My joy, my hope, my peace
That's all for me (Eyyy)
'Cause You're living in me
I'm fired up now nothing gonna stop me now
I'm fired up now nothing gonna stop me now

I've got the victory i'm unshakeable
'Cause Jesus You live in me
I'm unshakeable come on and say with me
I'm unshakeable hey, hey hey hey
I'm unshakeable

Okay, okay yo I've got something to say
You have set my heart ablaze
And I'll never be the same okay, okay
There's just something about Your name
And there's nothing gonna shake my faith
Hey i'm unshakeable
Okay, okay yo I've got something to say
You have set my heart ablaze
And I'll never be the same okay, okay
There's just something about His name
If you can't contain your praise
Let me see you 1, 2, 3, go!

I'm unshakeable
