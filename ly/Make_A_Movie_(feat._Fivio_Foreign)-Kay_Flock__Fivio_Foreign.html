		  (Make a movie) yeah
(Make a song, make a dance)
Huh, yeah (Elvis)
(A Lau on the beat)
(Grrah, grrah, graah)
Baow (grrah, grrah)
Yeah, uh

GBG, we been slidin' for weeks (skrrt)
Walkdown gang, face shot, no V (baow)
And bitch, is you ridin' for me?
Big EBK, who you linin' for me?
Like hop out, Dougie, he flockin' for he (yeah)
Nah, DOA, you ain't slidin' for we (nah)
Bullets punchin', no boxin' with me
(Bullets punchin', no boxin' with me) baow, baow, baow

Clip 'em (get 'em)
If he try to run up, we slide up, we hit 'em, like
We tripped him like (tripped him like)
Thottie she lined him, she got him, we blitzed 'em
Hang out the window like I'm tryna Rick 'em (Ricky, yeah)
Keep clickin', I go with the rhythm
He movin' back, I'll make sure I won't miss 'em (miss 'em)
He dead, now his homies miss 'em (he dead)
And I thought that I told y'all before
That y'all lil' nigga do not want war (y'all don't want it)
Put the K to your face when I kick down the door
Like, I'm tryna spin through the fours
Gonna put it in park, I'ma hop out and toss (like wait)
After that, get low to the floor
I do what I want, give a fuck 'bout a boss (yeah)
Lose JB, I ain't losin' no more

GBG, we been slidin' for weeks (skrrt)
Walkdown gang, face shot, no V (baow)
And bitch, is you ridin' for me?
Big EBK, who you linin' for me?
Like hop out, Dougie, he flockin' for he (yeah)
Nah, DOA, you ain't slidin' for we (nah)
Bullets punchin', no boxin' with me (yeah)
(Bullets punchin', no boxin' with me) yeah, yeah

Can't get my back, and I'll slide on a opp if I wanna, huh (skrrt)
I make it hot if I wanna, huh (baow)
He talkin' crazy all year
Niggas'll die at the top of the summer (ha, boom)
Uh, you know how I rock, you know how I come (look, comin')
He wasn't an opp, but he from that block (nah)
We don't care, we just wanted the numbers (baow)
You know how we comin' through, huh (how I'm comin' through)
Different cities we be runnin' through (baow)
You not a big homie, so how is he under you?
You say your tough, nigga, show me a gun or two
(Baow, baow, baow, baow)
Yeah, you say your tough, nigga, show me a gun or two, huh
As soon as you tell us where you at, my niggas will come at you (skrrt, baow)
Send me the addy and give me a rush (baow)
We got 'em back, but it wasn't enough
We want more, nigga is stuck
And his main bitch is givin' him up (grrt, grrt, baow)
Huh, yeah, a nigga'll die tryna get a nut
A nigga done died tryna get a nut

GBG, we been slidin' for weeks (huh)
Walkdown gang, face shot, no V (grrt, baow)
And bitch, is you ridin' for me?
Big EBK, who you linin' for me? (Baow, baow, baow)
Like hop out, Dougie, he flockin' for he
Nah, DOA, you ain't slidin' for we
Bullets punchin', no boxin' with me (nah)
(Bullets punchin', no boxin' with me)
