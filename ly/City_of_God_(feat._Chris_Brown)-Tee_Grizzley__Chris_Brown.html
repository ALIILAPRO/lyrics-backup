		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bands in the bag, I can dance for you
Turnin' your back and dance for me
There ain't nothing I can't do for you
Bad gyal, bad gyal
Movin' your back and dance for me
You want my move, I can dance for you
Jump up again, bend ya back
Yo turn up, yo, turn up

Remember livin' lights off, I got no money
I remember bein' fucked up, nights I go hungry
Since I ain't had nothin' to eat
Had to bleed the streets to feed the beast
And it can go down any minute
So you know the stick gotta sleep with me
It go down in the city of God
Goin' slidin', don't even feel nothin', no
It's a jungle, I fear nothin'
Only God, no man
It go down in the city of God
Somethin' y'all don't understand

Oh, yeah, 'member livin' like shit
I was gettin' niggas spent, now I'm rich (now I'm rich)
Still'll get a nigga spent
Ridin' with the bag, paranoid, drivin' with all this shit
'Fore I ever made a song, it was powder gettin' mixed
I was walkin' to the Coney, me and lil' brodie
Can't let you get up on me, you know I got that bitch on me
I was broke, so they hold me, now they actin' like they know me
How many niggas you know turnt they handcuffs to Rollies?
I done slept on air mattress and slept on pallets
That shit wasn't by choice, I had to 'cause we ain't have it
Couldn't do nothin' for granny, that shit turn me to a savage
You don't wake up and be rich, lil' nigga, you gotta stack it
I was lookin' for the bag, boy, I wasn't rappin'
You survive in my hood, boy, that wouldn't happen
I can't do no crime with no rapper niggas rattin'
Bet your brains on the shirt'll look like Jell-O on a napkin

Remember livin' lights off, I got no money
I remember bein' fucked up, nights I go hungry
Since I ain't had nothin' to eat
Had to bleed the streets to feed the beast
And it can go down any minute
So you know the stick gotta sleep with me
It go down in the city of God
Goin' slidin', don't even feel nothin', no
It's a jungle, I fear nothin'
Only God, no man
It go down in the city of God
Somethin' y'all don't understand
