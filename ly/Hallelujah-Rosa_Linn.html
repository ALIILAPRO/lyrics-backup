		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I floated for the longest time
I walked the fall, I walked the rise
And I was flatlined

I wasn't searching for a sign
You came and took me by surprise
Oh, what a landslide

And my arms opened wide
As the universe cried
Every word, every line of our lives
For that moment I died
Born again in your eyes
All at once, watching two worlds collide

Hallelujah, hallelujah
For a moment there I finally felt alive
Oh, Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, you just went and saved my life

Hallelujah, you just went and saved my life

I tasted happiness right then
I crave that feeling all again
True obsession

You turned the water into wine
Turned my mundane into divine
Pure perfection

And my arms opened wide
As the universe cried
Every word, every line of our lives
For that moment I died
Born again in your eyes
All at once, watching two worlds collide

Hallelujah, hallelujah
For a moment there I finally felt alive
Oh, Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, you just went and saved my life

Hallelujah, you just went and saved my life
Hallelujah, you just went and saved my life

Hallelujah
