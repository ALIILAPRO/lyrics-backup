		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I once had a girlfriend but then one day she dumped me and everywhere I go people would ask me where she was I don't want to talk about her someone always asks about her so I tell them all my girlfriends dead I say its leukemia or sometimes bulemia or a great big truck ran her over and chopped off her head I don't want to talk about her someone always asks about her so I tell them all she's dead I guess there's a part of me that lacks sympathy oh the looks on their faces when I tell them how she passed away I don't want to talk about her someone always asks about her so I tell them all she's dead [my girlfriends dead...] my girlfriends dead you see its a total lie but its easier on me than having to admit that she likes someone else [my girlfriends dead...] my girlfriends dead you know please change the subject, I'm going to go jump off a building and join her in heaven I don't want to talk about her someone always asks about her I don't want to talk about her someone alwayss asks about her so I tell them all my girlfriends dead
