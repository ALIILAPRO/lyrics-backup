		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's in your reach
Concentrate
It's in your reach
Concentrate

If you deny this
Then it's your fault
That god's in crisis
He's over

It's in your reach
Concentrate
It's in your reach
Concentrate

If you deny this
Then it's your fault
That god's in crisis
He's over

Every time I rise I see you falling
Can you find me space inside your bleeding heart
Every time I rise I see you falling
Can you find me space
Find me space

It's in your reach
Concentrate
It's in your reach
Concentrate

If you deny this
Then it's your fault
That god's in crisis
He's over

Every time I rise I see you falling
Can you find me space inside your bleeding heart
Every time I rise I see you falling
Can you find me space inside your bleeding heart
It falls apart
It falls apart
It falls apart

Every time I rise I see you falling
Can you find me space inside your bleeding heart? 
Every time I rise I see you falling
Can you find me space inside your bleeding heart? 
It falls apart
It falls apart
It falls apart
