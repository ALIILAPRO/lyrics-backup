		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Underneath the city lights
There is a world few know about
Where rules don't apply, no
And you can't keep a good girl down

She goin' through the club looking for a good time
Gonna make that, shake that money on a dime
Don't need a sugar daddy, she can work it just fine
Up on the table, she'll be dancing all night

Yeah, baby doll just comes alive
Under the spotlight, all the girls wanna fall in line
We say, hey, here come the ladies 'bout to give a little show
Hey, here come the boys, we gonna show a little more (more, more)

Hit it up, get it up, won't let you rest
Hit it up, get it up, this is not a test
Hit it up, get it up, gotta give me your best
So get your ass up, show me how you Burlesque

Hit it up, get it up, won't let you rest
Hit it up, get it up, this is not a test
Hit it up, get it up, gotta give me your best
So get your ass up, show me how you burlesque

A little bit of naughty is a little bit nice
She's a whole lot of glam, sweat, sugar, sex, spice
Just shimmy, shimmy, strut, strut, give a little what, what
Up on the tables, we'll be dancing all night

Yeah, everybody just comes to life
Under the spotlight, all the boys wanna fall behind
We say, hey, here come the ladies 'bout to give a little show
Hey, here come boys, we gonna show a little more

Hit it up, get it up, won't let you rest
Hit it up, get it up, this is not a test
Hit it up, get it up, gotta give me your best
So get your ass up, show me how you Burlesque

Hit it up, get it up, won't let you rest
Hit it up, get it up, this is not a test
Hit it up, get it up, gotta give me your best
So get your ass up, show me how you Burlesque

Okay girls, let's show 'em how it's done
It ain't over till we say and we've only just begun

Lemme hear you say, yeah
Say yeah
Say yeah
Say yeah

Hit it up, get it up, won't let you rest
Hit it up, get it up, this is not a test
Hit it up, get it up, gotta give me your best
So get your ass up, show me how you Burlesque

Hit it up, get it up, won't let you rest
Hit it up, get it up, this is not a test
Hit it up, get it up, gotta give me your best
So get your ass up, show me how you Burlesque
