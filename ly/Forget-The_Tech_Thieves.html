		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You're starin' to forget)
(You're starin' to for-)

We want it so much
We're getting in your head
Nothing can stop us
We'll make it to the end
Oh, how we envy
All those we haven't met
Look up when we rise
You'll see our silhouettes

Leave your hearts in the dust
Don't you know who we are
Take a hit, take a shot, oh yeah, hey
Leave your hearts in the dust
We ain't never giving up
Maybe you're starin' (maybe you're starin')
You're starin' to forget

We want it so much
We're getting in your head
Nothing can stop us
We'll make it to the end
Oh, how we envy
All those we haven't met
Look up when we rise
You'll see our silhouettes

Leave your hearts in the dust
Don't you know who we are
Take a hit, take a shot, oh yeah, hey
Leave your hearts in the dust
We ain't never giving up
Maybe you're starin' (maybe you're starin')
You're starin' to forget

Leave your hearts in the dust
We ain't never giving up
Maybe you're starin'
You're starin' to forget
To forget, you're starin' to forget
