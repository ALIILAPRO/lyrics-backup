		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The weather outside is getting pretty warm
But I just think it's funny how summer is so short
And it's the good times you can't ignore
I'm taking pictures of my friends from the shore
Driving down the highway sometimes the road is rough
But I got this feeling and I just can't get enough
I got a song for you that I think you'd like
We got a ways to go and we'll never run out of time
We'll never run out of time
We'll never run out of time
And we'll never run out of time
Yeah we'll never run out of
So put the troubles in the past
Drive straight and never look back
And I know that time is moving pretty fast
One day we'll talk about it and we'll laugh
So slow down
Enjoy the good times while they last
'Cause when no one is around
We'll run around and we'll dance
And we're moving to that sound
Laying in the grass
Looking up at the clouds
There's nothing more that I could ask
We'll never run out of time
We'll never run out of time
And we'll never run out of time
Yeah we'll never run out of
