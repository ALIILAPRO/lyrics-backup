		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't got no comment (whoa, ha)
(Ginseng)
I don't got no comment (whoa, ha) (Dulio, shut up)
Yeah, bitch, I be touching them bands, that broke boy quiet (shh, shh)
Yeah, they never did no drugs, not a day in they life, ha, ayy

Got 13 mil' from the deal, Percs so real (ha, ayy)
I don't be fuckin' with nobody (deep)
How you faking it that you got a song with all of these rappers? (What?)
How you faking that you got the money but you used to cap?
Yeah, called up Eliantte, flawless diamonds on the beach, watch, I'm surfin'
Yeah, they checking my Feng shui, I don't got nothing, bitch I'm off the Earth
Earth, all of my pockets they jumping, they twerk
For sure, I got another M just off the verse, yeah
Pockets swollen, run up all my bands, I got my bag
Walked inside this building, fucked this skank, I fucked this girl
I don't fuck with nobody, not no one, not two, not (yeah)
Pulled up out of Paris, Fashion Week, I'm out here (uh, uh)

One thing about me, lil' bitch, I don't care about mentions at all (Ginseng)
What the fuck my pockets on? Bitch, fuck attention (Dulio, shut up)
Paid my car off in cash 'cause I just felt like it
Pulled up to Paris for the weekend, I just felt like it
Pop a few of these (sheesh, sheesh), Percs
I don't sip, bitch, I got disease (sheesh, sheesh)
Yeah, it hurt (sheesh)
Yeah, have you fuckin' on a screen, yeah (sheesh)
Pulled up with a fuckin' wig on 'em (sheesh)
Glock got a fuckin' switch on it (Sheesh)
Got a new ceiling, 'bout to switch on 'em (sheesh)
.30 got a fuckin' clip on it (sheesh)
And my dick got your bitches lips on it (sheesh, Ginseng)
And the drum got a fuckin' stick on it (sheesh)

I don't got no comment (whoa, ha)
(Ginseng)
I don't got no comment (whoa, ha) (Dulio, shut up)
Yeah, bitch, I be touching them bands, that broke boy quiet (shh, shh)
Yeah, they never did no drugs, not a day in they life, ha, ayy

Got 13 mil' from the deal, Percs so real (ha, ayy)
I don't be fuckin' with nobody (deep)
How you faking it that you got a song with all of these rappers? (What?)
How you faking that you got the money but you used to cap?
Yeah, called up Eliantte, flawless diamonds on the beach, watch, I'm surfin'
Yeah, they checking my Feng shui, I don't got nothing, bitch I'm off the Earth
