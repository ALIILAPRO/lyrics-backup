		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I caught your eye and you caught my attention
You like my style and I love the affection
I live for the days we meet up at our hide out
Never felt so alive but we're dead if they find out

My father was never your biggest fan
Values the name more than the man
Nobody, nobody, nobody understands

But oh, you taste like wealth
Oh, I'd risk my health
For one more day with you
This is a tricky age
We're birds stuck in a cage
Wish I could fly away with you
We fit perfectly like milk and honey
But somethings don't mix like young love and old money
Oh oh old money
Oh oh old money

You right all my wrongs and make all my wrongs right
In the midst of a battle but it's worth the fight

My mother says, marry for money
A rich man's jokes are always funny
Nobody, nobody, nobody knows what I need

But oh, you taste like wealth
Oh, I'd risk my health
For one more day with you
This is a tricky age
We're birds stuck in a cage
Wish I could fly away with you
We fit perfectly like milk and honey
But somethings don't mix like young love and old money
Oh oh old money
Oh oh old money

Have you heard the news
It's in the Post
I almost called it off
Almost
Said I'd wait for you and didn't keep my promise
When I spoke the words I meant them
Honest
But I met an Ivy League man
My father offered him my hand
You know my appetite is quite expensive
And his summer home is so impressive
You and I were made for a season
Forbidden fruit that I was eating
Oh, poor thing don't look so blue
It's what I had to do but
I'll never forget you

Oh, you taste like wealth
Oh, I'd risk my health
For one more day with you
We fit perfectly like milk and honey
But somethings don't mix like young love and old money
Oh oh old money
Oh oh old money
Oh oh old money
Oh oh old money
