		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature rise
Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature rise
The temperature, temperature
Yeah I, I could feel the temperature, temperature

I pick you up in a Bently truck, I'm outside
Hit me up when you need some downtime
Damn girl, it's 'bout time
Off at 4, I want to see you around 5
Now I'm 4:45, I'll be on my way
Ya I'm on my way come outside
Baby girl, you're never that mine
I lost my watch and I still found time
Uh, girl you're hot and cold, that makes you warm
Let your ex-man stay in the storm
When you don't have to force it, it's a force
All I ever want is more

Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature rise
Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature rise
The temperature, temperature
Yeah I, I say I could get you so high
You might die if you fall, yeah

And what's left to love if I gave you all of me, be patient
And when you need space, I give you a spaceship
Take all the space you need yeah
Face your freedom with the face
You still be mine
Before we lay, we lie
I get you so wet, would you come clean, oh I

Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature rise
Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature rise
The temperature, temperature
Yeah I, I say I could get you so high
You might die if you fall, yeah

Uh, girl you're hot and cold, that makes you warm
Let your ex-man stay in the storm
When you don't have to force it, it's a force
All I ever want is more
And I cannot protect you when you flex so far away
I remember when I met you, the thought of sex was so far away
All I wanted was to talk to you
Thought it would be cool to tell you what I thought of you
You're radiant, you're vibrant
Intelligent, you know I'm not like them
I'm more like lightning, you're like fire, it's frightening

Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature rise
Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature
The temperature, temperature
Yeah I, I say I could get you so high
You might die if you fall
