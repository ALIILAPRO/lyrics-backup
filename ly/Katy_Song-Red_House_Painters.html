		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some escape some door to open
This path seems the blackest but I
Guess it's the soonest
But there in the clearing I
Know you'll be wearing
Your young aching smile and
Waving your hand
Can't go with my heart when I
Can't feel what's in it I
Thought you'd come over
But for some reason you didn't
Glass on the pavement under my shoe
Without you is all my life amounts to

A final sleep no
Words from my cutting
Mouth to your ear or
Taut wicked pinches
From my fingers to your bitter face
That I can't heal
I know tomorrow
You will be
Somewhere in London
Living with someone
You've got some kind of family
There to turn to
And that's more than I could ever give you

A chance for calm
A hope for freedom
Outlet from my cold solitary kingdom
By the forest of our spring stay
Where you walked away
And left a bleeding part of me
Empty and bothered
Watching the water
Quiet in the corner
Numb and falling through
Without you what does my life amount to
