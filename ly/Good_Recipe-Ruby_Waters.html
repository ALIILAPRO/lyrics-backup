		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I didn't know that it was possible
To feel so pleased, so at ease

Can't make this up
I am so in love

And it feels so nice, feels so nice

You got me tweakin', you got me twitchin'
Got me glitchin', you got me wishing for
The sight of you walking through my door

You electrify my body
In a way that nothing else does
In a way that makes me go ahh ahh 

My mind, my heart, my soul, my body 
I don't ever want to wake up 
From the dream that you give to me everyday
My love

If love was blind, then fuck it I'd be fine
With not seeing much, just need your touch

You hit me like a good recipe
and it tastes so nice, tastes so nice

You got me tweakin', you got me twitchin'
Got me glitchin', you got me wishing for
The sight of you walking through my door

You electrify my body
In a way that nothing else does
In a way that makes me go ahh ahh 

My mind, my heart, my soul, my body 
I don't ever want to wake up 
From the dream that you give to me everyday
My love

Running out, running out of words to say
