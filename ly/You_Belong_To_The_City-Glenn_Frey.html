		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The sun goes down 
The night rolls in 
You can feel it starting all over again 
The moon comes up 
And the music calls 
You're getting tired of staring at the same four walls 
You're out of your room 
And down on the street 
Moving through the crowds through the midnight heat 
The traffic roars 
And the sirens scream 
You look at the faces, it's just like a dream 

Nobody knows where you're going 
Nobody cares where you've been 

'Cause you belong to the city 
You belong to the night 
Living in a river of darkness, beneath the neon light 
You were born in the city 
Concrete under your feet 
It's in your moves, it's in your blood 
You're a man of the street 

When you said goodbye 
You were on the run 
Tryin' to get away from the things you'd done 
Now you're back again 
And you're feeling strange 
So much has happened, but nothing has changed 

You still don't know where you're going 
Your still just a face in the crowd 

You belong to the city
You belong to the night 
Living in a river of darkness, beneath the neon light 
You were born in the city 
Concrete under your feet 
It's in your blood, it's in your moves
You're a man of the street 

You can feel it 
You can taste it 
You can see it 
You can face it 
You can hear it 
You're getting near it 
You want to make it 
'Cause you can take it

You belong to the city
You belong to the night 
You belong to the city
You belong to the night
You belong 
You belong
