		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The weight of the world is resting on thin ice
When the surface breaks will I find paradise?
As I freeze to death, left to reflect
What a waste of time I was, in retrospect

I'd take a leap of faith, but I'd lose my nerve
In the end, I'll get the hell that I deserve

I'm always gone with the wind
Crawling in and out of my mind
God knows, I lost all my faith

A sickness with no remedy, except the ones inside of me
You ever wonder how deep you can sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate
Annihilate me

Do you remember when you said to me
"My friend, hope is a prison."
Hope is a prison

Of all the patterns that I could create, 
I built a labyrinth with no escape
To keep my 'self' under lock and key
I am my own worst enemy

I'd take a leap of faith, but I'd lose my nerve
In the end, I'll get the hell that I deserve

I'm always gone with the wind
Crawling in and out of my mind
God knows, I lost all my faith

A sickness with no remedy, except the ones inside of me
You ever wonder how deep you can sink into nothing at all? 
Disintegrate
Annihilate me
A sickness with no remedy, except the ones inside of me
You ever wonder how deep you can sink into nothing at all? 
Disintegrate
Annihilate me

If I could silence all the doubt in me
Accept that what is meant to be (Is meant to be)
You ever wonder how deep you can sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate
Annihilate me

Do you remember when you said to me
"My friend, hope is a prison."
