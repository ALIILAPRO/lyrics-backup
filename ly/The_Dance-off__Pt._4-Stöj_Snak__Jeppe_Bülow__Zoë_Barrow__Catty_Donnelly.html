		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's celebrate
Life is party, cut the breaks
Let's start today
Shake the mind out of this awful state

Move to the song
There are no rules, you can't do wrong
Come sing along
We'll make up the words as we go along

There goes sobriety / and your autonomy
No monotony / come celebrate with me
Dance like an idiot / dance like an idiot

There are no guarantees / snap out of sanity
Defy your gravity / and sing along with me
Dance like an idiot / dance like an idiot

Turn up the sound
Let's get this party off the ground
Just jump around
All amped up, we're never coming down

Oh yeah, turn up the beat / go nuts and move your feet
The way you celebrate is kind of killing me...
Dance like an idiot / dance like an idiot
No more dumb sanity / keep going at full speed
Just one more round for me / I've never felt this free
Dance like an idiot / dance like an idiot
Whoa, yeah!
Alright, alright, alright, woohoo!
