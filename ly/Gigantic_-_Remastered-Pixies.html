		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And this I know his teeth as white as snow
What a gas it was to see him
Walk her everyday into a shady place
With her lips she said

She said, "Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul
Let's have a ball
Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul
Let's have a ball
Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul
Let's have a ball"

Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
A big, big love
Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
A big, big love

Lovely legs there are
What a big black mass, what a hunk of love
He'll walk her every day into a shady place
Like the dark, but I'd want him

"Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul
Let's have a ball
Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul
Let's have a ball
Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul
Let's have a ball"

Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
A big, big love
Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
A big, big love

Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
A big, big love

Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
A big, big love
A big, big love
A big, big love
A big, big love
A big, big love
A big, big love
A big, big love
A big, big love
A big, big love
