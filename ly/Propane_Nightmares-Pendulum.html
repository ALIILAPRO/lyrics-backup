		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something's tearing me down and down
And I can't help but feel it's coming from you
She's a gunshot bride as the trigger cries
I just wonder what we've gotten ourselves into

In a trail of fire I know we will be free again
In the end we will be one
In a trail of fire I'll burn before you bury me
Set your sights for the sun

Mind is willing, soul remains
This woman cannot be saved
From the draw into the fire

Mind is willing, soul remains
This woman cannot be saved
From the draw into the fire

Anything to bring it on home
Bring it on home
Bring it on home
Bring it on home

Much to weak to jump yourself
Heal the wounds or crack the shell
Lift yourself from once below

Much to weak to jump yourself
Heal the wounds or crack the shell
Lift yourself from once below

Praise the anger bring it on home 
Bring it on home
Bring it on home 
Bring it on home

In a trail of fire I know we will be free again
In the end we will be one
In a trail of fire I'll burn before you bury me
Set your sights for the sun

Bring it on home
