		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My life's a mess 
I'm so stressed 
I feel depressed when I'm faced against my own face 
I won't become what I despise 
But I could care less 
If I break you and not care about the consequence 
But then it starts

I'm a little bit impatient at times 
Cause I feel like im wasting my time 
I'm afraid of being home all alone 
In a place where my mind gets a mind of its own
I'm a little bit lonely and scared
I'm just hoping that somebody cares 
I'm at a point where I'm so paranoid 
Im afraid to come out if there's somebody there 

I cant escape my reality 
I can't see what's in front of me 
Something gets a hold of my sanity 
I need to be alone 
Don't want to lose control

I cant escape my reality 
I can't see what's in front of me 
Something gets a hold of my sanity 
I need to be alone 
Don't want to lose control

I'm losing control 
It's taking its toll 
I'm feeling alone 
With nowhere to go 
But can't seem 
To let go 
I don't know 
Don't wanna look and see what's in front of me

I can't escape 
My own fate 
This state of mind 
Will only drive me to my own grave 
I'm sick of feeling like there's Someone at my door step 
I try to stop it but these voices Inside my head 
They won't stop  

I really hope that I can stop all the noise 
I need a way to get away from this pain
I've been going insane 
Trying to run everyday 
I'm afraid I'm not getting away 
But If I do and the voices shut up
Will they still be there when I wake up
Now it's cold i'm alone 
cnd it's dark 
I just wanna go home 
But im so paranoid 

I cant escape my reality 
I can't see what's in front of me 
Something gets a hold of my sanity 
I need to be alone 
Don't want to lose control

Chorus
I'm losing control 
It's taking its toll 
I'm feeling alone 
With nowhere to go 
But can't seem 
To let go 
I don't know 
Don't wanna look and see what's in front of me 

I always get ignored 
It's like I have no voice 
I wanna just destroy 
The things have me paranoid
To let go 
I don't know 
Don't wanna look and see what's in front of me 

I'm losing control 
It's taking its toll 
I'm feeling alone 
But can't seem 
To let go 
I don't know 
Don't wanna look and see what's in front of me 

I always get ignored 
It's like I have no voice 
I wanna just destroy 
The things have me paranoid
To let go 
I don't know 
Don't wanna look and see what's in front of me
