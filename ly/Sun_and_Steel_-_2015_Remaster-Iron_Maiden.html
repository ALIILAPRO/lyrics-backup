		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, you killed your first man at thirteen
Killer instinct, animal supreme
By sixteen you had to learn to fight
The way of the warrior, you took it as your rite

Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel

Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel

Through earth and water, fire and wind
You came at last, nothing was the end
I'll make a cut by fire and stones
Take you and your blade, break you both in two 
Break you both in two

Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel

Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel, rolling on and on

Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel

Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel

Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel

Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel
And it's rolling still
