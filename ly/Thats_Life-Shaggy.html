		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, sometimes it's up and sometimes it's down
One thing for sure is the world keeps spinning around
Di-da
Yeah
But you should know seh life's for living
And life can be so very unforgiving
But you know seh a life
Live it, how you mean?

That's life (that's life)
That's what all the people say
You're riding high in April, shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top, back on top in June

I said that's life (that's life)
As funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks, stomping on a dream
But I don't let it, let it get me down
'Cause this fine old world, keeps spinnin' around

I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet
A pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out
And I know one thing
Each time I find myself
Flat on my face
I pick myself up 
And get back in the race

That's life (that's life)
I tell you, I can't deny it
I thought of quitting, baby
But my heart just ain't gon' buy it
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try
I'd jump right on that big bird and then I'd fly

I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet
A pawn and a king
I've been up and down, over and out
And I know one thing
Each time I find myself 
Layin' flat on my face
I just pick myself up 
And get back in the race

That's life (that's life)
I can't deny it
Many times I thought of cutting out
But my heart just won't buy it
But if there's nothing shaking come this July
I'm gonna roll myself up
In a big ball and die

(Die, oh, die)
(That's life)
(Get up and try)
(That's life)
(Do it or die) na-na, ohh
(That's life)
(That's life) oh, my, oh, yeah

My, my
