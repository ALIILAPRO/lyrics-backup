		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hold up, let me get it started
B.B. with the Robin's, lookin' all retarded
B.B. saggin', fly like a dragon
Bitches suck my dick 'cause I'm fly like Aladdin
Scum Gang!

These bitches think I'm stupid, I ain't stupid
Dummy boys fall in love with it, he stupid
All these hoes on my body, cut the bullshit
All these hoes, they ain't loyal, y'all lookin' stupid
I just left Starlets and I ain't even cash out
Back out, straight to the trap house, I blow her back out
I'll pull her tracks out, got her running like it's track now
Like a Smackdown, rock bottom I'ma pin her down
Hold up, let me get it started
B.B. with the Robin's, lookin' all retarded
B.B. saggin', fly like a dragon
Bitches suck my dick 'cause I'm fly like Aladdin

Pour a semi, pull up to the cribby, uh
Licky-licky, licky on my blicky, uh
Take a flicky, make a movie with me, uh
Take a flicky, make 'em real, drippy, uh
Why you watching me?
You all on my IG
Why you stalking me?
You don't even follow me
Why you Tweet my shit?
You ain't used to read my shit
Bitch, you used to fuckin' leave me on seen and shit

Went to the Eastside, spanked out Juju
Lucky I ain't have it on me, I was gon' shoot you
Spanked him on camera, threw it on YouTube
Stupid lil' dumb nigga, now you on YouTube
If a nigga want beef, I'm the type to drag it
Shoot you while you with your bitch then it's back to mackin'
Police pull up on me, I don't know what happened
Police pull up on you, you gon' get to yappin'
We gon' get to clappin', we been on static
Semi-automatics, they gon' get to clappin'
We ain't with the chattin', you lil' niggas cappin'
If we catch you lackin', turn you into has-beens
Ran through Lust, 100 bands up
Shout out SpinKing, that's my motherfuckin' blood, nigga
Go, go, go mulignane
Go, go, mulignane

Pour a semi, pull up to the cribby, uh
Licky-licky, licky on my blicky, uh
Take a flicky, make a movie with me, uh
Take a flicky, make 'em real, drippy, uh
Why you watching me?
You all on my IG
Why you stalking me?
You don't even follow me
Why you Tweet my shit?
You ain't used to read my shit
Bitch, you used to fuckin' leave me on seen and shit
