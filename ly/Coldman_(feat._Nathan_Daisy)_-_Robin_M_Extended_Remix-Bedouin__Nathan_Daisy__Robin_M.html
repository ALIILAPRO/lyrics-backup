		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That day I hired a Coldman, I knew it was a Coldman 
A Coldman is not a soulmate, a Coldman is half of a woman 
Ready too far to take a breath, ready to go to be his friend
It was too late for me I had to taste
I was addicted, I was his slave 
x2

I won't hide from my mother, she will be mad at me
I'm so sorry my mother, don't go don't go into me?
x2
my mother, don't go don't go into me?
x2
