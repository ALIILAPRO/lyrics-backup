		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel so lost sometimes
Trying to read between the lines
I'm waiting here for you
Giving it all, try pick it through
When you're treading carefully
God in your heart, hiding for me

But I'll never know, never find who you are
If you don't open your heart to me
Let me in, let me try
Let me feel all your love
Open your heart to me

Who lives behind those eyes?
Oh, your soul, unknown at times
Over and 'round we go
You leave me here, fully exposed
Wondering how you feel
Living your life with a heart made of steel

But I'll never know, never find who you are
If you don't open your heart to me
Let me in, let me try
Let me feel all your love
Open your heart to me

You're safe with me, so let it out
Just let it out
If you trust me, I'll set you free
From all your doubts

But I'll never know, never find who you are
If you don't open your heart to me
Let me in, let me try
Let me feel all your love
Open your heart to me
I'll never know, never find who you are
If you don't open your heart to me
Let me in, let me try
Let me feel all your love
Open your heart to me
Open your heart to me
Open your heart to me
