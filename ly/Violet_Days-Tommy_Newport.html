		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know now
I was draggin' my girl
Pullin' the whole world right to the ground
I know now
I was makin' a swirl
Spinning the whole world right to the ground

She wanted love
Those violet days
But I was making it rain right from her face
She wanted fun
Those sunlit rays
But I was making it rain down on her place

She knows now
That she was draggin' my world
I was on her twirl
I stayed to the ground
She knows now
She was causing a hurt
Digging mess in the dirt
Never to be found

She wanted love
Those violet days
But I was making it rain right from her face
She wanted fun
Those sunlit rays
But I was making it rain down on her place
