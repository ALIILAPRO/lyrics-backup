		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I put my heart in my lyrics
I gave it all I could give
I made it hot at the crib
I kept that fire at the crib
Where you gon' go when you dip?
How I'ma know who for real?
I pour a four in a fifth
You already know what it is
I keep a pole in the whip
'Cause a lot of these niggas out here envy me
It ain't no ho in the clique
None of my dawgs got fuckboy tendencies
I don't even show no sympathy
Sippin' on Hennessy, got me bendin' sideways
Everything on me drippin', you niggas can't ride the wave
Nigga run around with the juice, nigga come spill your drank
I done earn my stripes now I'm tryna go get me some real rank

Readin' through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel vision
Had to open my mind, then I opened a business
It's like you gotta sell your soul for them to pay attention
Fuck all that playin', now I'm grown, I put my heart in it
I had to get down with that chrome to show them niggas I'm serious
And it's like every song I'm on, I be callin' my spirits

I put my Hublot on rocks
I put Moscato on rocks
Where I'm from we don't say opp
Shoot at an OV, shoot at a cop
Shoot at the police, shoot at your top
I made a million off socks
Free all my niggas who stuck in a box
Locked up and watchin' the clock
Locked up, they fightin' with locks
Locked up, they swingin' they knifes
I can't be livin' this life
No more Bacardi, alright
I don't want Cardi, so I'ma pour Henny on ice
My vision is vivid, told you I'm really a menace
I'll show you I'm destined to get it
I be outside with the glizzy
Totin' that fire, I be trippin'
I just might die how I'm livin'
Ain't take no bath, but I'm drippin'
Niggas ain't catchin' me slippin', ayy, yeah
I make you laugh when you with me
Know that my swag look terrific (glee, glee)
Ain't seen my dad in a minute
But I can't be mad, I got millions
I just pulled up in a lemon
Thuggin', so fuck your opinion
I'm thuggin', so fuck how you feelin'
I'm callin' my spirit

Readin' through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel vision
Had to open my mind, then I opened a business
It's like you gotta sell your soul for them to pay attention
Fuck all that playin', now I'm grown, I put my heart in it
I had to get down with that chrome to show them niggas I'm serious
And it's like every song I'm on, I be callin' my spirits
