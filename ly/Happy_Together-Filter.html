		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Imagine me and you, I do
I think about you day and night
It's only right 
To think about the girl you love 
And hold her tight 
So happy together

If I should call you up, invest a dime 
And you say you belong to me
And ease my mind 
Imagine how the world could be
So very fine 
So happy together

I can't see me lovin' nobody but you
For all my life 
When you're with me baby the skies'll be blue 
For all my life 
You and me!
(I can't see me lovin' nobody but you)
Me and you!
You and me!
(I can't see me lovin' nobody but you)
Me and you!

Me and you, and you and me
No matter how they toss the dice 
It has to be
The only one for me is you
And you for me
So happy together

I can't see me lovin' nobody but you
For all my life 
When you're with me baby the skies'll be blue 
For all my life
You and me!
Me and you!
You and me!
Me and you!
You and me!
Me and you!
You and me!
Me and you!
