		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Down fell the stars and they splashed in the sea.
"Mi nomine baphomet," come dance with me.
Sacrifice the virgins, spiritual rites.
Their master has come, the moon is full tonight.
Drinking, dancing, they worship and toast.
The Devil, who's watching, with demons remote.
Fire, rising, racing in your blood.
Possessed, naive, his service is done.
Bloody blasphemy
Sinister's the word as the demons take their fill.
An orgy's taking place, human blood will spill.
And act of worship as they conceive the ghouls.
Satan has their souls, they sing pagan tunes.
The ceremony is sure to be cursed.
They wait for his blessing but down comes the worst.
Their bodies, soulless, a corpse from the grave.
Their minds are helpless and no one can save them,
No one can save them.
