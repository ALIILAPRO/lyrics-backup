		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish I could be anyone
anyone but me
I wish that I could disappear anytime I sleep
and when I see a satellite
high above the sun
I wish I could live a better life but I find myself numb
singing

isn't that a big shame
that you promised me your heart
you hit me like a freight train
now the damage has been done

And I promised that I wouldn't cry
are you satisfied with me
now and then I get a little lost
a little harder to see
you melt me like an icecap
you're the alibi I need
trying not to let it hurt again
but it's starting to bleed

singing

isn't that a big shame
that you promised me your heart
you hit me like a freight train
now the damage has been done
I keep trying to let the blood drain
but you're coming back for more

isn't that a big shame
that you promised me your heart
you hit me like a freight train
now the damage has been done
I keep trying to let the blood drain
but you're coming back for more
