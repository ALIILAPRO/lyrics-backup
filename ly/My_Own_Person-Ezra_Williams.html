		  My Own Person by Smoothboi Ezra

Been rotating the same two outfits for three years now
Waiting for some kind of inspiration to make me feel like I’m my own person
But buying new clothes just makes me feel down
Having new style would cause me more attention and I don’t feel like I’m my own person
I just feel like some other version of me

Been talking about the same problems for years now
But nothing I do seems to make things happen I try to hard I guess I gota to keep searching
Can’t help but think I just stand out
No matter what I do it’s bad it’s hurting and I don’t feel like I my own person
I just feel like some other version of me

I wanna blend into the background, I wanna be nobody and never make a sound
But I wanna start feeling that I can be myself
Oh wherever I go bad thoughts are lurking, I try and I try but I’m not my own person

I need new shoes these ones are worn out, I’ll buy the same pair just a different version ‘cause God forbid I put some effort in 
It would be nice if I wasn’t filled with doubt
Oh I can’t help feel that I’ve got some kind of curse and I don’t feel like I’m my own person 
I just feel like some other version of me

I wanna blend into the background, I wanna be nobody and never make a sound
But I wanna start feeling that I can be myself
Oh wherever I go bad thoughts are lurking, I try and I try but I’m not my own person
I wanna be buried in the ground and I don’t want anyone to ever dig me out
And I’ve never had a sense of self 
Oh the longer I stay here the more things worsen I’ll never be my own person 
I wanna blend into the background, I wanna be nobody and never make a sound
But I wanna start feeling like I can be my self
Oh wherever I go bad thoughts are lurking, I try and I try but I’m not my own person
I wanna be buried in the ground and I don’t want anyone to ever dig me out
And I’ve never had a sense of self 
Oh the longer I stay here the more things worsen and I’ll never be my own person
