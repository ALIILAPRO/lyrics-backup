		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Race through the valley of the stars
Run like a river through the heart
Why can't I feel it when I fall
Scream drive faster
Push my body against the wall
Hot like fever in the fall
Bloom like a flower in the spring
Scream drive faster
Moving fast to nowhere, nowhere
Clouds pass days last forever
The sun fades drive into the ocean
I'm right out here in a blue, blue sea
Easy, ready to love
Right I say
Easy, ready to love

I don't wanna feel it always running away
I don't really need it go on take it away
Take it all, take it all
I don't wanna feel it always running away
I don't really need it go on take it away
Take it all, take it all

Run like a killer in the wind
Rage like a rebel wunderkind
Touching the city after dark
Scream drive faster
Smoke like a summer in the sun
Sweet like the thunder on my tongue
Sweat out a fever in the night
Scream drive faster
Moving fast to nowhere, nowhere
Clouds pass, days last forever
The sun fades drive into the ocean
I'm right out here in a blue, blue sea
Easy, ready to love
Right I say
Easy, ready to love

I don't wanna feel it always running away
I don't really need it go on take it away
Take it all, take it all
I don't wanna feel it always running away
I don't really need it go on take it away
Take it all, take it all

Take it all, take it all

Take it all, take it all
