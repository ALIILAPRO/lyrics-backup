		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Choking on the dirt that I've been force fed
The population is bleeding me dry
Swallow myprideas I watchthe moon light
Seep into my pores,I only fear the end
It happens over and over again
Separation, it fucks with my head
Bullshit I am constantly fed
Autophobia, I wish I was dead
Fuck

I try to hide the shame away
On the edge of the precipice
Never to see the light of day
Cursed to be a nihilist
Endless pits of fucking madness and I'm so afraid
The spiraling entity stuck in my brain
Crafted an outward persona
Threatening to tear me apart

Feels like I've been sleeping
Locked away from the world I've known
Feels like the glass is breaking
I'm set free as you lose control

Choking on the dirt that I've been force fed
The population is bleeding me dry
Swallow my pride as I watch the moon light
Seep into my pores, I only fear the end
It happens over and over again
Separation, it fucks with my head
Bullshit I am constantly fed
Autophobia, I wish I was dead

Helpless against the ever growing darkness
Hopeless, I can never escape
It's out of my hands
Not even screams can break this silence

I can't stand myself
Breathe
I try to hide the shame away
On the edge of the precipice
Never to see the light of day
Cursed to be a nihilist
