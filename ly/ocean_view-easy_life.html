		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought you said you loved the ocean
When we were standing at the shore
You didn't even dip your toes in
I can't believe I just took you home

I thought you said you loved the ocean
When we were standing at the shore
You didn't even dip your toes in
I can't believe I just took you home

You and me by the sea, working on our tan lines
Tangerine dream, I watch you swim, I watch you dive
We could pretend it's always like this
Let's pretend it's always like this
Let's get rich, live like kings, let's get red like lobsters
Factor 50 on my skin, fighting off the monsters
Let's pretend it's always like this
And let's collect some pretty pictures, yeah

I thought you said you loved the ocean
When we were standing at the shore
You didn't even dip your toes in
I can't believe I just took you home

I'm roasting, just coasting, good mood
Your skin on my skin, posing in a photo booth
The scent of vanilla from your shampoo
And we move only when we have to
We're fresher than daisies, driving me crazy, driving at high speeds
Hit me like Tyson, when pillow fighting up in the en-suite
You float like a butterfly, sting like a bee, gave me a nosebleed
Life's a beach, I'm a sexy beast

I thought you said you loved the ocean
When we were standing at the shore
You didn't even dip your toes in
I can't believe I just took you home
I thought you said you loved the ocean
When we were standing at the shore
You didn't even dip your toes in
I can't believe I just took you home

Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da-da

I thought you said you loved the ocean
When we were standing at the shore
You didn't even dip your toes in
I can't believe I just took you home

I thought you said you loved the ocean
