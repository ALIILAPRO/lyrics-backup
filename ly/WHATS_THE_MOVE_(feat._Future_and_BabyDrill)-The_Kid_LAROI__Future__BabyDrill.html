		  What's the-, what's the-, what's the-?

What's the move?
Tell me what it is (what's up?)
Pull up to the crib, walk in, I'm countin' blues up with my bitch
My baby, that's my twin, gate outside, you can't get in (get in)
Heart cold as my wrist, what I spent on that, one-sixty
I'm doin' the most, vacation off the coast
I'm at the crib, just me and my bitch, security with the pole
And actually, you're the one for me, I can't let you go
Red carpet pics, we pose, windows open, we smoke the roach down

Tell me just one more time
You put it on your life
I'm sick of wastin' time
You know I am
I need some peace of mind
I wanna leave the country
Baby, come with me, let's ride

2AM on the beachfront, smoked so much, I can't think, um
Very stressed, pop a lot of X, that's the type of shit that we on
I'm carin' less, and don't gotta guess, and she got me 'cause I know what she on
Double C's, what she wants
Walked in and bought three of 'em, I swear

Tell me just one more time
You put it on your life
I'm sick of wastin' time (yeah)
You know I am
I need some peace of mind
I wanna leave the country
Baby, come with me, let's ride (Pluto)

Freebandz, wanna join my team
Bad bitch wanna fuck again (again)
Glock on me like ID
She spin through and drop everything
What it do? What it is?
Been countin' blues up with my bitch
My lifestyle Givenchy
Know my lifestyle expensive
Girl, tell me what's on your mind (on your mind)
Purchase Chanel, you don't want one of a kind
I was thinkin' Richard Mille, but I need to take my time
Lookin' like I play the NBA, got a chain on forty points (yeah)
Lookin' like she gettin' her rent paid from the bottle park on the modern (bottle park on the modern)
Tell me what's been on your mind, give me one time, no more problems (no more problems)
Sippin' on mud, I bought you one so you can sip (yeah)
My young niggas slimin' shit up, we locked in
Yeah, you know what it is, really gang, gang, yeah

Tell me just one more time
You put it on your life
I'm sick of wastin' time
You know I am
I need some peace of mind
I wanna leave the country
Baby, come with me, let's ride

2AM on the beachfront, smoked so much, I can't think, um
Very stressed, pop a lot of X, that's the type of shit that we on
I'm carin' less, and don't gotta guess, and she got me 'cause I know what she on
Double C's, what she wants
Walked in and bought three of 'em, I swear

Tell me just one more time
You put it on your life
I'm sick of wastin' time
You know I am
I need some peace of mind
I wanna leave the country
Baby, come with me, let's ride

Baby, come be my wife (baby)
Baby, let's take a flight (let's go)
She ain't never been overseas
But we can go tonight, huh
She want Chanel, I called up Future (I got it)
She want the Balenci', I got her the boots (I got it)
You're one of a kind, ain't nothin' like you
She all about me, and I'm all about you
I'm off of these drugs, it got me floatin' out of my body (I'm off these drugs)
Ooh, been off the G6, we been fuckin' for some miles (G6)
Her neckpiece like a sixty, she only want me for my diamonds
Critical digits, if they play with you, baby, I'm spinnin' for ours (baby, I'm spinnin' for ours)
