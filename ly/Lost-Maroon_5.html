		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Had no connection, no faith or direction, no
Searching and searching for someone to save my soul, ooh

Ooh, ooh
I was swept up in a wave, swept up in a wave
Ooh, ooh
Then I heard you say my name
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

Lost, I was lost, I was lost 'til you loved me
Now I'm found, now I'm found, now I'm found
Yeah, you took me to a place
It was safe, it was sound (sound, sound, sound)
Lost, I was lost, now I'm found

Lost, I was lost, I was lost 'til you loved me
Now I'm found, now I'm found, now I'm found
Yeah, you took me to a place
It was safe, it was sound (sound, sound, sound)
Lost, I was lost, now I'm found

I was so broken, my heart was an empty space (oh)
Life was a joke 'til the moment I saw your face
Saw your face, saw your face

Ooh, ooh
I was swept up in a wave, swept up in a wave
Ooh, ooh
Then I heard you say my name
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah

Lost, I was lost, I was lost 'til you loved me
Now I'm found, now I'm found, now I'm found
Yeah, you took me to a place
It was safe, it was sound (sound, sound, sound)
Lost, I was lost, now I'm found

Lost, I was lost, I was lost 'til you loved me
Now I'm found, now I'm found, now I'm found
Yeah, you took me to a place
It was safe, it was sound (sound, sound, sound)
Lost, I was lost, now I'm found

Ooh, again (ah)
Ooh, again, yeah
Ooh, again (ah)
Ooh, again, yeah

Ooh, ooh
I was swept up in a wave, swept up in a wave
Ooh, ooh
I was stranded when you came
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Lost, I was lost, I was lost 'til you loved me (I was lost, lost)
Now I'm found, now I'm found, now I'm found (now I'm found, found, found)
Yeah, you took me to a place, it was safe, it was sound (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Lost, I was lost, now I'm found (oh yeah)
Lost, I was lost, I was lost 'til you loved me (I was lost, lost)
Now I'm found, now I'm found, now I'm found (now I'm found, found, found)
Yeah, you took me to a place, it was safe, it was sound (ooh, yeah, yeah)
Lost, I was lost, now I'm found
