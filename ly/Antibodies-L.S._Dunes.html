		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  From underneath this surface patch
You'll beg and writhe
And a longing, it could take the same amount
Might have missed it in my count

Mandatory spaces, stand in line
Through the television static, we divide
Come hold my throat to remind me what I am

You have the most material, oddest select
I never said I liked the side effect
I never meant it like I wished you well

Ativan, Ativan, gotta disconnect
Ativan, gotta disconnect

At the bottom, it's recorded
Every word that wouldn't pass
Opposite of everything you meant
I know it's a lot to ask, but I'm desperate
Do the silent treatment twist

You have the most material, oddest select
I never said I liked the side effect
I never meant it like I wished you well

I would never punish anyone to live like this
It is your choice alone
Whatever happens, don't let anybody see my face
Don't let anybody see my face

And if I'm wrong
I'll never try and change your mind again

What will make this last?
Kill me again
Tell it to stop finding excuses
Why the passion you insisted on feels dead

You have the most material, oddest select
I never said I liked the side effect
I never meant it like I wished you well

And I would never punish anyone to live like this
It is your choice alone
Whatever happens, don't let anybody see my face
Don't let anybody see my face
