		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I fall over and over and over
Over, over on you
I get ill, I get ill, I get ill
You're the only one I'm into

You and me fit so tight

I go lower and lower and lower
Lower, living easy
I don't know, I don't know
That I got till it's over

You and me fit so tight

Can you do it again?
Do it again? Do it again?
Can you do it again?
Hey, hey, hey

All the way, all the way, all the way
There's nowhere left we can meet (Oh)
I'm into what you do but I leave you nowhere

You and me (Hey) Fit so tight (Hey)
All we need (Hey) Is one more time (Hey)

Can you do it again?
Do it again? Do it again?
Can you do it again?
Do it again? Do it again?
Can you do it again?

I only get to live one life
Won't pretend you're only mine
Where will you go?
Where we all find the way

To do it again?
Do it again? Do it again?
Do it again? (hey, hey)
Do it again? (hey, hey)
Do it again? (hey, hey)

This is Tom Sherman, 
down here In Banning College, we're, uh 
We're promoting a blood dri-
Oh, shit

Welcome to the South of America
you're listening to AM580
lay back
sheep, little lamb, little lamb, little lamb

He told me so to my base
(Follow me and I will)
Good to know that he's walking with me
(Big rock is a weapon
The devil is a blast door)
And you have fallen into the love that needs to be designed by the Lord
Hallelujah, y'all, I wanna hear a couple 'ol Hallelujahs
