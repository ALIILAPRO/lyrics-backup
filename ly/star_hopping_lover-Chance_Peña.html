		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Brace for the stars
Fly away in floating cars
Recreate who you are
Change your name, it's a fresh start

Count down the days
And prepare for your great escape
Set to seamlessly integrate into the lost band of others
The star hopping lover

No I don't want the world
'Cause it'll never last
And when it starts to fall
I won't be looking back 

I don't wanna fall
(Please just let me go)
I don't wanna fall
(Please just let me go)
