		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's summertime so we outside again
It's summertime so we outside again
Summertime so we outside again
Outside outside

Life gone throw some punches guess sometimes you gotta roll with it
Hope you flexible just in case you gotta go with it
Think I'm master P feelin like I got no limits
Shawty touched my heart she know how to keep my soul lifted
Keep my soul
Yeah yeah

It's a Sunny day out in San Fran (we don't call it that)
Be my bae, you say you got a man (wait does he know that)
Anyway do you got some plans I'm tryna schedule that

(I'm tryna see what you gettin into)
Anything you want you know I got you what's your measurements
Angel wings in Apple bottoms jeans I think you heaven sent
You love that song by Mario she telling me I'm just a friend
Aw man well

Life gone throw some punches guess sometimes you gotta roll with it
Hope you flexible just in case you gotta go with it
Think I'm master P feelin like I got no limits
Shawty touched my heart she know how to keep my soul lifted
Keep my soul

It's summertime so we outside again
It's summertime so we outside again
Summertime so we outside again
Summertime so we outside again
