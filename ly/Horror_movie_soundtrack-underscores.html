		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lay down your arms, surrender at once
Aim for the head or go with your gut
Tear through the skin, pull at the seams
I may match the symptoms, but there's nothing to treat

Send my love to the girls, I've always had it in spades
You won't get away with this
You won't get away with this

Ready your arms, fire at will
Aim at your darlings, shoot to kill
Damage the nerves, pull at the strings
The world's in my fingers and I can't feel a thing

Send my luck to the girls, I've always had it in spades
You won't get away with this
You won't get away with this

Put my stuff on the curb whether or not you sell the estate
You won't get away with this
You won't get away with this
You won't get away with this
You won't get away with this
You won't get away with this
You won't get away with this
You won't get away with this
You won't get away with this
You won't get away with this
You won't get away with this
