		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Out of all of the places
In this little town
Yeah, you had to come walkin' in here
And sit down

I'm hidin' and hopin'
My face ain't too red
Since we've been over, I've been tryin' like crazy
To get you out of my head

So, why ya wanna show up in a
Old t-shirt that I love
Why ya gotta tell me that I'm
Lookin' good, don't know what
You were thinkin' you were doin'
Movin' in for a hug
Like you don't know I'm comin' unglued
Why ya gotta, why ya wanna
Make me keep wantin' you

I wish ya had on sunglasses
To cover up those blue eyes
I wish you said somethin' mean
Made me glad that you said goodbye

Why can't you look off somewhere
You catch me starin' at you
Why can't you be cold like any old
Good ex would do

So, why ya wanna show up in a
Old t-shirt that I love
Why ya gotta tell me that I'm
Lookin' good, don't know what
You were thinkin' you were doin'
Movin' in for a hug
Like you don't know I'm comin' unglued
Why ya gotta, why ya wanna
Make me keep wantin' you

Keep wantin' you

Why, why, why
Would you tell me that you'd call me up sometime
Maybe we could get a drink and just catch up
Like that'd be enough
No, that ain't enough

Why ya gotta show up in a
Old T-shirt that I love
Why ya gotta tell me that I'm
Lookin' good, don't know what
You were thinkin', you were doin'
Movin' in for a hug
Like you don't know I'm comin' unglued
Why ya gotta, why ya wanna
Make me keep wantin' you

Why ya gotta, why ya wanna
Make me keep wantin' you

Why ya gotta, why ya wanna
Make me keep wantin' you

Out of all of the places
In this little town
Yeah, you had to come walkin' in here
And sit down
