		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I miss the summer
And running to your grandmas house
Homeade lemonade was great
Or koolaid in the microwave

I miss the gardens
Blankets and butterflies
Corner store ice-cream treats
When everything in our sight
Was new to our blue eyes

[Rxseboy:]
Skies lavender, riding in the passenger
Roses, bright red, coming home to a massacre
Cherry coated lips, when she dip, running after her
Switching like the seasons when I'm flipping through my calendar
Wet floor sign, never slip I'm the janitor
Cleaning up your messes with confessions on the banister
Always try to test me, you ain't fooling your examiner
And every planet turns, except the one inside your canister
I'm a brainiac, scratch that. Maniac
Throwback, back when mom was calling me a crazy brat
Doing backflips off of anything that looked amazing
Now I'm backtracking, wonder why you left me hanging

[Powfu:]
I miss the summer
And running to your grandmas house
Homeade lemonade was great
Or koolaid in the microwave

I miss the gardens
Blankets and butterflies
Corner store ice-cream treats
When everything in our sight
Was new to our blue eyes

[Rxseboy (Powfu):]
Hard to think that she hating me
Remember how she fantasized about how she'd be dating me? (yeah)

[Powfu:]
Thought I saw future
But she don't see it the same as me
Remember when u left
And I sat there waiting patiently?

[Rxseboy (Powfu):]
And I don't want excuses I just really want the past back. (yeah)
Tryna say I love her, then I end up getting laughed at. (aye)

[Powfu:]
You told me that were serious
It's obvious I'm hurt
Wanna live inside the past
But its buried in the dirt

[Outro:]
I miss the summer...
