		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ships go by and wave at me
I try, can't breathe
There's an ocean in between
Your heart and me

I know I hurt you and I
I don't deserve you but don't leave me, leave me
Took you for granted but don't
Don't leave me stranded here, I need ya, need ya

It's a long way down
If I fall without you
I know I hurt you and I
I don't deserve you but don't leave me
Don't leave me now

Don't leave me now
(Don't leave me, leave me)
(Don't leave me, leave me)

Stay up 'til the morning light
You're right, I'm done
I know right where I belong
I'm yours, I'm wrong, yeah

I know I hurt you and I
I don't deserve you but don't leave me, leave me
Took you for granted but don't
Don't leave me stranded here, I need ya, need ya

It's a long way down
If I fall without you
I know I hurt you and I
I don't deserve you but don't leave me
Don't leave me now

(Don't leave me, leave me)
(Don't leave me, leave me)

I'd hold back the ocean tide
If that's what I had to do
Let me spend my whole damn life
Making it up to you, yeah

I know I hurt you and I
I don't deserve you but don't leave me, leave me
Took you for granted but don't
Don't leave me stranded here, I need ya, need ya

It's a long way down
If I fall without you
I know I hurt you and I
I don't deserve you but don't leave me
Don't leave me now
