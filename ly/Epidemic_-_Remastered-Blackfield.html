		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't say everything's okay

Don't tell me that it's just a phase

It doesn't help me



All the stars are standing still

The anger and the sleeping pills

Are all that's left now



An epidemic in my heart

Takes hold and slowly poisons me

Her will won't let me breathe

It comes in waves and bleeds me dry

This love is slowly killing me

For me, there's no-one else



Jealousy just eats me up

Your knife has made the deepest cut

My heart is pumping



You say that there must be an end

But afterwards we'll still be friends

It seemed so easy



An epidemic in my heart

Takes hold and slowly poisons me

Her will won't let me breathe

It comes in waves and bleeds me dry

This love is slowly killing me

For me, there's no one else
