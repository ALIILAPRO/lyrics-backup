		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's said and done
It's been way too long, yeah
So rest your head now, darling
Until the morning sun

We don't have to put it all on the table
We can let it go until the dawn
There's no need to complicate it with a label 
So close your eyes
Daylight won't be long

Let's talk in the morning, my love
Save it till the morning
Let's talk in the morning
Make up, make love in the morning

I know I've been workin' late
Livin' by the moon
So let's just take this moment
And burn the midnight blues, oh

We don't have to put it all on the table
Tomorrow we can make it all alright
There's no need to complicate it with a label 
Let's take our time
We'll set the word at night, ooh

Let's talk in the morning, my love
Save it till the morning
Let's talk in the morning
Make up, make love in the morning

Let's talk in the morning, my love
Save it till the morning
Let's talk in the morning
Make up, make love in the morning

Let's talk in the morning, talk in the morning
Let's talk in the morning, talk in the morning
Let's talk in the morning, talk in the morning
Let's talk in the morning, talk in the morning
Let's talk in the morning, talk in the morning
Let's talk in the morning, talk in the morning
Let's talk in the morning, talk in the morning
Let's talk in the morning, talk in the morning
Let's talk in the morning
