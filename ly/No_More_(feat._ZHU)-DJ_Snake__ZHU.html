		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, I caught you lyin', lyin' to my face
Stop them tears you're cryin'
You made your bed, now lay
I don't fuck with you no more
I don't fuck with you no more
Dunno why you tryin'
Passin' on the blame
Ain't no justifyin'
It's time you take the pain
I don't fuck with you no more
I don't fuck with you no more

Watch me 
Do me
I ain't gonna hurt no more
Ain't gonna hurt no more
You cut me deep
So deep
But I ain't gonna hurt no more
Ain't gonna hurt no more, oh no

Ooh, I caught you lyin', lyin' to my face
Stop them tears you're cryin'
You made your bed, now lay
I don't fuck with you no more
I don't fuck with you no more
Dunno why you tryin'
Passin' on the blame
Ain't no justifyin'
It's time you take the pain
I don't fuck with you no more
I don't fuck with you no more

Watch me 
Do me
I ain't gonna hurt no more
Ain't gonna hurt no more
You cut me deep
So deep
But I ain't gonna hurt no more
Ain't gonna hurt no more, oh no
