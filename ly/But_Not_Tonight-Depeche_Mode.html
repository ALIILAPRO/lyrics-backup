		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh God, it's raining
But I'm not complaining
It's filling me up with new life

The stars in the sky bring tears to my eyes
They're lighting my way tonight

And I haven't felt so alive in years

Just for a day
On a day like today
I'll get away from this constant debauchery

The wind in my hair makes me so aware
How good it is to live tonight

And I haven't felt so alive in years

The moon is shining in the sky
Reminding me of so many other nights
But they're not like tonight

Oh God, it's raining and I'm not containing
My pleasure at being so wet

Here on my own
All on my own
How good it feels to be alone tonight

And I haven't felt so alive in years

The moon is shining in the sky
Reminding me of so many other nights
When my eyes have been so red
I've been mistaken for dead
But not tonight
