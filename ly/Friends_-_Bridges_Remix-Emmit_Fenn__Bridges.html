		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We made up all the songs that we used to sing
Getting drunk on the air cause we had nothing
We laughed so hard we cried
Making forts in the trees by the trampoline
Doing flips with your mom always clipped our wings
And ground us for the night
Sunsets
Late nights
Wish that I could rewind
Heartbreaks
Goodbyes
All the years that we’ve been friends
I wonder how our story ends
Sun kissed
Weekends
Driving in the deep end
No bad feelings
All the years that we’ve been friends
I wonder how our story ends
Skipping stones out of breath on Fallen Leaf Lake
Take a hike to the cliff and just jump all day
We almost touched the sky
Racing bikes through the woods till we crash again
All the scars like a map of our innocence
It’s crazy how time flies
Sunsets
Late nights
Wish that I could rewind
Heartbreaks
Goodbyes
All the years that we’ve been friends
I wonder how our story ends
Sun kissed
Weekends
Driving in the deep end
No bad feelings
All the years that we’ve been friends
I wonder how our story ends
Sunsets
Late nights
Wish that I could rewind
Sunsets
Late nights
Wish that I could rewind
Sunsets
Late nights
Wish that I could rewind
Heartbreaks
Goodbyes
All the years that we’ve been friends
I wonder how our story -
