		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lately, she's tryin' to move on with her life
She's got two grown kids always there by her side
But her happiness lives on the edge of a knife
And the sadness resides in the box in her mind

She's got too many tragedies weighing her down
But her mom's too sick and her dad's not around
Spending way too much time living under a cloud
So, she can't even see a way out

I think she knows it's not her fault
It's just how it goes, when he never calls
He promised her and gave his word
But instead he broke it, along with her world

It's the same old story
Twenty years later
She said sorry
For all that you've taken
It kills me to see it
But it's nothing new
She's blaming herself for everything that we went through
But I blame it on you

Heard that you're still living up in your castle
Trying to live your happy ever after
You won't win the war 'cause you didn't even battle
I guess that we never really mattered

I think she knows it's not her fault
It's just how it goes, when he never calls
He promised her and gave his word
But instead he broke it, along with her world

It's the same old story
Twenty years later
She said sorry
For all that you've taken
It kills me to see it
But it's nothing new
She's blaming herself for everything that we went through

So, don't you worry if you're not sorry
I'll be beside her, her shoulder to cry on
We'll blame it on you, blame it on you, blame it on you
I guess I should thank you for dragging us under
You tore us apart but we ended up stronger
And we'll blame it on you, blame it on you, blame it on you

So, she's changed her story
Twenty years later
She never says sorry
For the things that you've taken
And I love to see it
She's likes someone new
No more blaming herself for everything that she went through
She blames it on you
