		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why don't you listen when I try to talk to you?
Stop thinking of yourself for just a second, fool
Shut up, shut up, I don't wanna hear your mouth
Your mother made a monster, now get the hell out of my house

Can't stand it for another day (I ain't gonna live my life this way)
Cold sweat, my fists are clenching (stomp, stomp, stomp)
The idiot convention
Which one of these words don't you understand?
Oh, caught in a mosh
Talking to you is like clapping with one hand

What is it? Caught in a mosh
What is it? Caught in a mosh
What is it? Caught in a mosh
What is it? Caught in a mosh
Don't tell me how to do my job

There's the door, your name's on the knob
You're always in the way like a beast on my back
Were you dropped as a baby? 'Cause brains you lack

Can't stand it for another day (I ain't gonna live my life this way)
Cold sweat, my fists are clenching (stomp, stomp, stomp)
The idiot convention
Which one of these words don't you understand?
Oh, caught in a mosh
Talking to you is like clapping with one hand

What is it? Caught in a mosh
What is it? Caught in a mosh
What is it? Caught in a mosh
What is it? Caught in a mosh

Think before you speak or suffer for your words
Learn to give respect that others give to you
Oh, the best you can do

Hey man, I'm trying to reason but you don't understand
Talking in circles, we'll never get it straight
Just you and me in our theater of hate

Can't stand it for another day (I ain't gonna live my life this way)
Cold sweat, my fists are clenching (stomp, stomp, stomp)
The idiot convention
Which one of these words don't you understand?
Oh, caught in a mosh
Talking to you is like clapping with one hand

What is it? Caught in a mosh
What is it? Caught in a mosh
What is it? Caught in a mosh
What is it? Caught in a mosh
