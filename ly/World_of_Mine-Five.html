		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been trying to ease my mind.
From this life that I have been thrown into.
I no longer know who to trust.
They keep hurting me no matter what I do.
It's a big world out there.
And sometimes it can swallow you up.
But never give up yeah.

I've been tryin' to find a friend in this crazy world.
And the more that I try to find a friend in this crazy world.
I'll sail the seven seas.
I would climb a mountain high.

To get you in this world of mine.
To get you in this world of mine.
To get you in this world of mine.

I've been dying to meet someone.
Just to share all the things other people do.
Just a laugh or a cry.
Just a simple goodbye.
I will see you soon, would do.
I promise you I won't let you down.
Come to me.
I will make you see yeah.

I've been tryin' to find a friend in this crazy world.
And the more that I try to find a friend in this crazy world.
I'll sail the seven seas.
I would climb a mountain high.

To get you in this world of mine.
To get you in this world of mine.
To get you in this world of mine.
To get you in this world of mine.
To get you in this world of mine.

I've been searching for someone to care
Someone who'll always be there

To get you in this world of mine
I've been tryin' (I'm tryin') to find (I'm dying) a friend
(I'm fighting) in this crazy world (I'm fighting for you)
And the more that (I'm tryin') I try (I'm dying) to find
A friend (I'm fighting) in this crazy world
(I'm fighting for you)
I'll sail the seven seas
I would climb a mountain high

To get you in this world of mine.
To get you in this world of mine.
To get you in this world of mine.
To get you in this world of mine.
To get you in this world of mine.
To get you in this world of mine.
To get you in this world of mine.
