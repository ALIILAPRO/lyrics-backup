		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now I know your secret   
I promise that I'll keep it   
So confidentially   
Between just you and me, I'll never leak it   
  
I'm the specialist   
I know you can't resist   
I'll bypass your alarm   
No need to twist my arm, I insist   

If you're looking for a war   
There's a market for betrayal   
Don't ask me what I saw   
Ya know my secrets not for sale   
Don't ask me what I heard   
Ya know I promised not to say   
I said I'd never breathe a word   
Until my dying day   

Well seeing is believing   
No use in your deceiving   
For now I know it's true   
It's you that holds the clue, I'll be leaving   

Now I've got to say goodbye   
You understand I have to fly   
When you get the third degree   
And the truth don't set you free, You've got to lie   

If you're looking for a war   
There's a market for betrayal   
Don't ask me what I saw   
Ya know my secrets not for sale   
Don't ask me what I heard   
Ya know I promised not to say   
I said I'd never breathe a word   
Until my dying day
