		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You wanna start a fire
Build a bridge to take you higher
I'll tell you you're dreaming
Can't you see that bridge burning?

You wanna build a gun
You wanna make it fire
I'll tell you you're dreaming
Can't you see your boots are bleeding

You wanna build a home
Ooh, make it cozy and warm
Well, baby, you ain't dreaming
That home of yours is burning

London bridge is falling down
London bridge is falling
London bridge is falling down
London bridge is falling

You wanna build a tower
To see an old country view
I'll tell you you're dreaming
There's a tower growing up in front of you

Have a whiskey on the rocks
Show the people you're helping
Well, I'll tell you you're dreaming
Can't you see your rocks melting?

You wanna build a home
Oh, make it cozy and warm, baby, now
Well, baby, you ain't dreaming
That home of yours is burning (ooh)

London bridge is falling down
London bridge is falling
London bridge is falling down
London bridge is falling

I've been looking high
Oh so high, baby, yeah
In that light, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah

London bridge is falling down
London bridge is falling
London bridge is falling down
London bridge is falling

That's what a burning bridge looks like
Flames growing higher than the skyline
That's what a burning bridge looks like
Flames growing higher than the skyline
