		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say our love
Is like dynamite
Open your eyes
It's like fire and ice
Well, you're killing me
Your love's a guillotine
Why don't you just set me free?

(Too young to fall in love) I'm too young
(Too young to fall in love) I'm too young
(Too young to fall in love) too young to fall in love
But I'm too young
(Too young to fall in love) I'm too young
(Too young to fall in love) ooh, I'm too young
(Too young to fall in love) too young to fall in love

Run for the hills
We're both sinners and saints
Not a woman, but a whore
I can just taste the hate
Well, now I'm killing you
Watch your face turning blue
Not yet a man, just a punk in the street

(Too young to fall in love) I'm too young
(Too young to fall in love) I'm too young
(Too young to fall in love) to fall in love
Oh, I'm too young
(Too young to fall in love) much too young
(Too young to fall in love) I'm too young
(Too young to fall in love) too young to fall in love

You say our love
Is like dynamite
It's no surprise
you've got one-way eyes
Well, you're killing me
Your love's a guillotine
Not yet a man, just a punk in the street

(Too young to fall in love) Oh, I'm too young
(Too young to fall in love) I'm too young
(Too young to fall in love) to fall in love
Oh, I'm too young
(Too young to fall in love) much too young
(Too young to fall in love) I'm too young
(Too young to fall in love) too young to fall in love

Too young to fall in love
Too young to fall in love
Too young to fall in love

Too young to fall in love
Too young to fall in love
Too young to fall in love

Too young to fall in love
Too young to fall in love
Too young to fall in love

Too young to fall in love
