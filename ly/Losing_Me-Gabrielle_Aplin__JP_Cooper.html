		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wanna lie to you
Say I'm doing so well
Show you photos too, to prove that I've been doing so well
Wanna hide the truth
Wanna dress up hell and heaven, like we all try to do

I'm scared to call you back
I'm not good at trying
To tell you that I'm not doing okay
But I'm dying to hear you say

Just take a breath, love
Fill your lungs up
Rest your head, there's no sense in losing sleep
You can break down
Let your worst out
Lose your temper, but you're not losing me (take a breath, love)
You're not losing me (you can break down)
Oh, oh

Don't wanna cry to you
I was feeling so good
Take another sip, then hit the bottom like I knew that I would
All the things we do
When we dress up pain like heaven in a moment of truth

I wanna call you back
I'm not good at trying
To tell you that I'm not doing okay
But I'm dying to hear you say

Just take a breath, love
Fill your lungs up
Rest your head, there's no sense in losing sleep
You can break down
Let your worst out
Lose your temper, but you're not losing me (take a breath, love)
You're not losing me (you can break down)

You could be so happy, then it suddenly turns
No one can explain it and you don't have the words
I can see you're trying, I can see that it hurts
I can see you're trying, I can see that it hurts

Just take a breath, love
Fill your lungs up
Rest your head, there's no sense in losing sleep
You can break down
Let your worst out
Lose your temper, but you're not losing me
Like a bed that you could fall in when you're broken
I'm the air that's running through our window open
Take a breath, love
Fill your lungs up
Rest your head, 'cause you're not losing me (mm)
You're not losing me
