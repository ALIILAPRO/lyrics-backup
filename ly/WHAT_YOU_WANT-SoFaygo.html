		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I miss you Bryce)
(Y2, is that you?)
(2Ezzy on some other shit)

I get the racks and I'm gone (bleh)
'Member I ain't used to be on (oh)
Now everybody hittin' my phone (ooh, brr, brr)
Now you WhatsAppin' me, what do you want? (Ooh, ooh, whoa)
Y'all say what you want while I do what I do (do)
Fuck whatever they say and just believe it's true
I just been stackin' that money end up makin' a fool (ooh)
Shit be so fucked up but I just keep it cool

Just pull up, bitch I'm faster (pull up bitch I'm fast)
Livin' life like shit don't matter (we living life so fast)
I just took that girl to Saturn (I took that girl to Saturn)
I was just on my shit, 'til on my turn
Yeah, you know we play with fire, you get burned (hey)
Like when I gave that bitch my heart, she made it hurt (she made it hurt)
Like when they wanna try Lil' Go and then they learn
Baby, I got so much of money, I feel like Vert (brr)
I feel like bird, yeah (go)
Count up like a nerd, yeah (go)
In this life, do not be scared, yeah (go)
Take a flight across the world, yeah
Show you something you never had (yeah)
Everyday another hater
Hurt my pride and that's for certain
I'm still me behind the curtain (I'm still me behind the curt')
Treat this shit like this shit urgent (yeah)

I get the racks and I'm gone (bleh)
'Member I ain't used to be on (oh)
Now everybody hittin' my phone (ooh, brr, brr)
Now you WhatsAppin' me, what do you want? (Ooh, ooh, whoa)
Y'all say what you want while I do what I do (do)
Fuck whatever they say and just believe it's true
I just been stackin' that money end up makin' a fool (ooh)
Shit be so fucked up but I just keep it cool

Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
