Hm
Hm

I dream a hundred dreams a minute
And deep inside what I construct
So there's no use, don't even bother
Tonight is not the night for us
I have a million shapes a decade
I'm past the point of no return
So don't even call, don't even bother
'Cause I can't make you my concern

I'm runnin' faster than before
Beats and tunes and lovers
Cannot hold me back no more
I work alone
Is this all I'll ever know? Oh

And I remember all my childhood dreams
I find it hard to get them out of my mind
And I remember all my childhood dreams
I find it hard to get them out of my mind
And I remember all my

So as the nighttime hits my window
Sudden move to gain the lights
'Cause I'm not even close to done yet
Well, I won't leave, I'm too inspired
And when the dawn emerges slowly
I realize the night has passed
The sounds I made were visionary
Looking forward to go back

I'm runnin' faster than before
Beats and tunes and lovers
Cannot hold me back no more
I work alone
Is this all I'll ever know? Oh

And I remember all my childhood dreams
I find it hard to get them out of my mind
And I remember all my childhood dreams
I find it hard to get them out of my mind

Hm
Hm
Hm
Hm
Hm
