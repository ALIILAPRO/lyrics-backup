		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I took your heart
I did things to you only lovers would do in the dark
It made you a God
Priests, popes, and preachers would tell me I did it wrong
But, hey
You made a negro flip
What do I say
To make me exist? Oh
Stranger

Still don't know my name
You still don't know my name
And I would die your slave
Baby, right now
But you still don't know my name 
Yeah

Wish you, wish you'd come over, mm
Miss you, kiss you in make-believe
I'm dreamin' of all of the possibilities
I'm kissin' all over your body, my Nefertiti
And every time I think the planets alignin'
You're still so close, but yet so far

Still don't know my name
You still don't know my name
And I would die your slave 
Baby, right now
But you still don't know my name
Yeah
