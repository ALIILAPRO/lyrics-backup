		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Beware of the full moon
Stick to the path
Out come the creatures
A spine-chilling laugh

A-ha-ha-ha
A-ha-ha-ha
A-ha-ha-ha

There's a chill in the air (chill in the air)
You hear a creak on the stairs
(Creak on the stairs)
You gotta lock all your doors
(Lock all your doors)
Is there anybody out

They're out to get you
To capture you and make you, spellbound
Howling and prowling
You're shivering, quivering, spellbound

You cannot run
And you cannot hide
Yeah, you gotta face it, baby
Things go bump in the night
Wherever you run
And wherever you hide
Yeah, you gotta face it, baby
Things go bump, bump, bump in the night

Tell me who's spookin' who
(Who's spookin' who)
It's very Scooby Doo (Scooby Doo)
You hear a shriek in the house
(Shriek in the house)
You know it's freaking me out

They're out to get you
To capture you and make you, spellbound
Howling and prowling
You're shivering, quivering, spellbound

You cannot run
And you cannot hide
Yeah, you gotta face it, baby
Things go bump in the night
Wherever you run
And wherever you hide
Yeah, you gotta face it, baby
Things go bump, bump, bump in the night

Who's spookin' (who's spookin')
Who's spookin' (who's spookin')
Who's spookin' (who's spookin')
(A-ha-ha-ha)
Who's spookin' (who's spookin')
Who's spookin' (who's spookin')
(Things that go bump, they go bump, they go bump, they go)
Who's spookin' (who's spookin')
Who's spookin' (who's spookin')
(They go bump, they go, they go bump, they go)
Who's spookin' (who's spookin')
Baby

You cannot run
And you cannot hide
Yeah, you gotta face it, baby
Things go bump, bump, bump in the night

You cannot run
And you cannot hide (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, you gotta face it, baby (oh, yeah)
Things go bump in the night
Wherever you run (you know wherever you run)
And wherever you hide
Yeah, you gotta face it, baby
Things go bump, bump, bump in the night

You cannot run (you can't run)
And you cannot hide (can't hide)
Yeah, you gotta face it, baby (oh, yeah)
Things go bump in the night
Wherever you run (you know wherever you run)
And wherever you hide
Yeah, you gotta face it, baby
Things go bump, bump, bump in the night

(Things that go bump, bump in the night)
