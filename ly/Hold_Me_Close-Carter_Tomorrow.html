		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh wont you hold me close
Cause I've been
Smoking dro
And I don't care no more
And you can call my phone
But I'll just ignore
Go and spill my pills
All on the floor
I'm fucked up of course
Washed up on the shores
Lines of blow
Don't open up the door
All this candy on the floor
Going straight to the core
I can't feel my face
Line up another eighth
I don't even know this place
Trying to give death a taste

I pull up too late
Its time to meet my fate
I just left from here
But I can't go back
Unless I'm in all black
For my funeral here
So I can cry these tears
And I can let it out
But it won't ever change
What's happening now
So just hold me close
Cause I don't know
What you love me for
I don't care no more

Oh wont you hold me close
Cause I've been
Smoking dro
And I don't care no more
And you can call my phone
But I'll just ignore
Go and spill my pills
All on the floor
I'm fucked up of course
Washed up on the shores
Lines of blow
Don't open up the door
All this candy on the floor
Going straight to the core
I can't feel my face
Line up another eighth
I don't even know this place
Trying to give death a taste
