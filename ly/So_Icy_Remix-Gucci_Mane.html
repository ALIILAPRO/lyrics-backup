		<p>
		  I'm icy, I'm clean
I'm icy

I'm icy (I'm icy, I'm clean)
I'm clean (I'm icy, I'm clean)
I'm a bad motherfucker (I'm icy, I'm clean)
I'm mean (I'm icy)
I'm icy (I'm icy, I'm clean)
I'm clean (I'm icy, I'm clean)
I'm a bad motherfucker (I'm icy, I'm clean)
I'm mean (I'm icy, I'm clean)

I had a plot as a kid to get rich
Hah, listen, lil' bitch
Got the game in my hand like a Switch
It's just me and my clique
Rap and get money, rap and get money
Said rap and get money, motherfucker
Ain't this shit funny?
Don't do it for money, don't do it for money
But if it come down to the money
I got a lot
I got a lot, like a lot
More than I need
I got children to feed, I got places to be
I got bitches to fuck, let me see your ID
Nah, I'm just playin', I'm playin'
You know that I'm playin', don't know what I'm sayin', no
Know that we chillin', we vibin'
We smokin' and drinkin', we gettin' this money though
Follow me, follow me, follow me
All the way, all the way into my paradise
I'm so cold, I think I'm made of ice

I'm icy (I'm icy, I'm clean)
I'm clean (I'm icy, I'm clean)
I'm a bad motherfucker (I'm icy, I'm clean)
I'm mean (I'm icy)
I'm icy (I'm icy, I'm clean)
I'm clean (I'm icy, I'm clean, it's Gucci)
I'm a bad motherfucker (I'm icy, I'm clean)
I'm mean (I'm icy, I'm clean)

I'm a human glacier, wrist full of frozen water (well, damn)
Comin' live from the hood like a news reporter (6)
Bling bling, Mr. S-O-I-C-Y (Y)
All the hoes jockin' Gucci Mane and I see why (woah)
I stay freshly and clean, clean like Andr√© 3-thou' (thou')
I was a Big Boi since a kid, now the world found out (huh?)
Mom named me Radric 'cause I'm radical (yeah)
Teamed up with Logic, he threw me a lateral (dope)
Big gold solitaires, that's collateral (bling)
She a Wop stan, she so fanatical (mwah)
Fall out when they see me, they dramatical
She ain't icy enough, we're not compatible

I'm icy (I'm icy, I'm clean)
I'm clean (I'm icy, I'm clean)
I'm a bad motherfucker (I'm icy, I'm clean)
I'm mean (I'm icy)
I'm icy (I'm icy, I'm clean)
I'm clean (I'm icy, I'm clean)
I'm a bad motherfucker (I'm icy, I'm clean)
I'm mean (I'm icy, I'm clean)

I'm icy, I'm icy, I'm so cold, I'm chilly
You know I got the C-notes like I'm Eilish, I'm Billie
That boy Logic flow so cold, loco, crazy, silly
You ever gon' stop rappin'?
I'm thinkin' no, no, not really, ayy
I be quick to put an ugly bitch in her place
'Cause a beautiful woman is something to see
And she's not defined by her face
Can't fuck with no girl who be all on the 'Gram
Tryna post while I'm eatin' spaghetti
Damn, girl, can't you be normal?
I'm famous as fuck, yeah, we get it already
But who give a shit about that
I am a good man, how 'bout that?
No way in hell I'm defined by the stat
Smokin' that pack, let me get it back
Let me get up in it, let me hit it like that
If you wanna come and get it with the RattPack
Like ayy, I'ma be here forever and a day
I be at the Grammy party with Jay and Bey
Oh shit, yeah, that's me
Sellin' out NYC
That shit I can't believe

I'm icy (I'm icy, I'm clean)
I'm clean (I'm icy, I'm clean)
I'm a bad motherfucker (I'm icy, I'm clean)
I'm mean (I'm icy)
I'm icy (I'm icy, I'm clean)
I'm clean (I'm icy, I'm clean)
I'm a bad motherfucker (I'm icy, I'm clean)
I'm mean
