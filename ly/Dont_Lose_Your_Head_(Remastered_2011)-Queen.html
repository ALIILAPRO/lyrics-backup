		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't lose your head
Don't lose your head
Don't lose your head (Don't lose your head)
No don't lose your head (Don't lose your head) 
Hear what I say
Don't lose your way - yeah
Remember, love's stronger, remember love walks tall
(Don't lose your head, Don't lose your head)
Don't lose your heart (Don't lose your heart)
No don't lose your heart (Don't lose your heart)
(Hear what I say) Hear what I say - yeah
(Don't lose your way) Don't lose your way - yeah
Remember, love's stronger, remember love walks through walls

Don't drink and drive my car
Don't get breathalyzed
Don't lose your head
If you make it to the top and you wanna stay alive
Don't lose your head
Oooh (Don't lose your head)
Don't lose your head (Don't lose your head)
No don't lose your head (Don't lose your head)
(Hear what I say) Hear what I say - yeah
(Don't lose your way - hey) Don't lose your way - yeah
Remember, love's stronger, remember love conquers all
(Don't lose your head, Don't lose your head)
(Don't lose your head, Don't lose your head)
Don't lose your head
(Don't lose your head)
Don't lose your head - yeah yeah
(Don't lose your head)
Don't lose your head
(Don't lose your head, Don't lose your head)
Don't lose your head
(Don't lose your, don't lose your, don't lose your, don't lose your
Don't lose your, don't lose your, don't lose your, don't lose your head)
