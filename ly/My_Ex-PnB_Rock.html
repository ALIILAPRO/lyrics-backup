		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

Found myself reading your texts
You remind me of my ex
Remember times that we shared
Girl, you so stuck in the past
Got you retracing your steps
Wonder where you fucked up at
You call my phone, I dub that
Girl, you just need to relax

Best one, I was the best one
You thinkin' 'bout way back, you should've kept him
You always questioned all of my methods
I tried to hold you down, you always extra
All of your girlfriends tell you I'm next up
You reminiscin', it's fuckin' your head up
I don't even pay you no mind
Honestly, I don't even have the time
And it's so sad, 'cause what we had could've been special
But you couldn't stay down and you only came around when you wanted something sexual, financial
But I used to open up doors for you
And I ain't gon' lie, I still noticed you
Wish you could rewind, but you had your time
Girl you had your chance, no time for romance

Found myself reading your texts
You remind me of my ex
Remember times that we shared
Girl, you so stuck in the past
Got you retracing your steps
Wonder where you fucked up at
You call my phone, I dub that
Girl, you just need to relax

Yeah, you always tweakin'
You swore up and down that I was cheatin'
I swear that I barely gave you a reason
You listen to rumors, now we ain't speakin'
Yeah, I gave you everything except for wedding ring
You was there before the fame
And I got these racks on me, now you wanna be my main
Remember I was down and I always thought I would always be the same
You been fuckin' on bro niggas, them lame niggas, you should be ashamed
Mad you the one I claimed
But fuck it though, man, that's the game
Now I had to move on to better things, oh

Found myself reading your texts (our texts)
You remind me of my ex (my ex)
Remember times that we shared (we shared)
Girl, you so stuck in the past (past)
Got you retracing your steps (oh yeah)
Wonder where you fucked up at (yeah)
You call my phone, I dub that (oh yeah)
Girl, you just need to relax (yeah)

(Girl, you just need to relax)
(Girl, you just need to relax)
