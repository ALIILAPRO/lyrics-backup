		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  " Fake friends are enemies "
I can't hear that enough
Ain't want to talk to you
I just wanted to fuck
My brain is negative, without saying too much
I want to tell her that she's
The bang for my buck
Now we unite, in a second you fall in love
First for my natural
Then it's all in the cuff
See our discussions are never to be discussed
If you disgust me I'll leave
You here in disgust

" Fake friends are enemies "
I can't hear that enough
Ain't want to talk to you
I just wanted to fuck
My brain is negative, without saying too much
I want to tell her that
She's the bang for my verse 1:
Now you and I are from the
City of all the buzz
The music's low and the breeze
Is taking you off
You might be falling but really
For me it's lust
You said you're so wet that
Your panties keep slipping off
Fallin' fallin' fallin' for my
I don't really care
You're just like my Barbie doll
Undress you everywhere
" Sorry sorry sorry " is
My never say it prayer
I ain't giving up my cut just
Cause you're up in my hair
I'm sick, my brain is a medication for cough
You told me " Take it off "
I told you " Take it off "
Baby it's not my problem
Baby it's not my fault if
You finish before I

Now we unite, in a second you fall in love
First for my natural
Then it's all in the cuff
See our discussions are never to be discussed
If you disgust me I'll leave
You here in disgust

" Fake friends are enemies "
I can't hear that enough
Ain't want to talk to you
I just wanted to fuck
My brain is negative, without saying too much
I want to tell her that she's
The bang for my buck
Now we unite, in a second you fall in love
First for my natural
Then it's all in the cuff
See our discussions are never to be discussed
If you disgust me I'll leave
You here in disgust

She thinks it's the same shit, every night
And I don't never argue
Nobody else can do it like we used to
That's every night
And even on them rainy days
We'd take flight
You make me feel like I'm just a little boy
I want to tell you
" mama give me my toys "
I think I found the spot
That makes you make noise
So I'ma hit that sweet love, like Commodores

Said we don't ever argue the same day
If she don't want to come through
It's okay but she always see's me
From Monday through Sunday
She thinks I'm the messiah, like " Ole'
Ole' "

Said we don't ever argue the same day
If she don't want to come through
It's okay but she always see's me
From Monday through Sunday
She thinks I'm the messiah, like " Ole'
Ole' "
