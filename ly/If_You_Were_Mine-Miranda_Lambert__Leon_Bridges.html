		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're a needle in a haystack
You're so damn hard to find
Candy apple red Cadillac
You're one of a kind

He let you go like a dandelion
And you blew out with the breeze
If I ever get a hold of you
I'd never let you leave

I'd make sure your stars are shining
Sure as the Frio's winding
I'd bottle you up like lightning
I'd rope the moon for you
A million times
That's what I'd do
If you were mine

I'd drink you down like fine wine
'Til there was nothing left
Boy, it should be criminal
The way you steal my breath

I'd make sure your stars are shining
Sure as the Frio's winding
I'd bottle you up like lightning
I'd rope the moon for you
A million times
That's what I'd do
If you were mine

I'd memorize you like a scripture
Hang on every word, ooh
I'd make you my whole world
Boy, if I was her
Girl, for what it's worth

I'd make sure your stars were shining
I'd make sure your stars are shining
Sure as the Frio is winding
Sure as the Frio is winding
I'd bottle you up like lightning
Lightning
I'd rope the moon for you
For you
A million times
That's what I'd do
If you were mine

Ooh, if you were mine
Ooh-ooh, you were mine
Mmm, if you were mine
You were mine
If you were mine
All mine, mine, mm
