		<p>
		  Yeah (How to make it here, 101)
Southside (make sure everybody feel the same way you did)
Uh, ten ton
Toni

A million dollars from now, I won't remember you
A million dollars from now, I won't remember your ass (your ass)
A million dollars from now, I won't remember you (I won't remember you)
A million dollars from now, I won't remember your ass

Soon as I land, they come with a bag
Tell I just got it, they don't have a tag
I fuck with the strippers, they helpin' my brand
On Lanvins, the shoelaces look like a Crayon
Told 'em, "No biggie", I'm makin' them bands
Flight to go overseas, I take a Xan
I get a deal and then I get some equity
When I get money then I'll buy some land
Yeah, I got GOAT with me, know what I'm sayin'?
She got some good throat, you know what I'm sayin'?
Been in the kitchen, you know I ain't payin'
You can ask chef, let me know how I pan out
Garage full of food, and I'm gon' pull the Lamb' out
Mm, yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?
The handshake I gave you was my lil' handout
Mm, yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?

A million dollars from now, I won't remember you (I won't remember you)
A million dollars from now, I won't remember your ass (yeah)
A million dollars from now, I won't remember you (I won't remember you)
A million dollars from now, I won't remember your ass

A million dollars from now, I won't remember you, I done forgot
I won't forget how I got what I got
Cry me a river 'cause I'm on yacht
Stack night after night, I been countin' these dots
Remind who forgot that it's slime over thots
Don't make me Paul Castellano the opp
It's Tunechi and Tity Boi, minus the drop
Wait, a million dollars from now
I'm gon' feel like I'm a million dollars away
I done put all this ice off in this Jesus Christ
It look like it cost a million dollars to play
Lookin' like I make a million dollars a day
Fly as fuck, that's a flight with no delay
Wait, a million dollars from now, got nine hundred nine- nine million dollars to make

A million dollars from now, I won't remember you (I won't remember you)
A million dollars from now, I won't remember your ass (yeah)
A million dollars from now, I won't remember you (I won't remember you)
A million dollars from now, I won't remember your ass
