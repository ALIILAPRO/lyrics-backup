		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place
When I'm gone, you'll need love 
To light the shadows on your face

If a great wave shall fall 
And fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own?

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low 
I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe, I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you 
Through the darkest of your days

If a great wave shall fall 
And fall upon us all
Well then I hope there's someone out there 
Who can bring me back to you

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low 
I'll go wherever you will go

Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love

I know now, just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind
I'll stay with you for all of time

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

If I could turn back time
I'll go wherever you will go
If I could make you mine 
I'll go wherever you will go
I'll go wherever you will go
