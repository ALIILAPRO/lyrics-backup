		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My love, let's start over again
Say things get better in time
Each day's a little harder to pretend
'Cause more and more, I see the bullets fly

So many try, so many fall
We're not afraid to risk it all
Wish I had a line to put in a song
To keep it alive and prove them wrong

Don't say you're running out of love
Just tell me how to love you better
I'm not giving up
So tell me how to love you
So nobody else could ever come close
And out of them all, you need me the most
Don't say you're running out of love
Just tell me how to love you better

Feels like a whole new world waking up
And I'm still waiting at the finish line
The sun rises but the truth keeps sinking us
You speak of love but not the way it dies

So many try, so many fall
We're not afraid to risk it all
Wish I had a line to put in a song
To keep it alive and prove them wrong

Don't say you're running out of love
Just tell me how to love you better
I'm not giving up
So tell me how to love you
So nobody else, could ever come close
And out of them all, you need me the most
Don't say you're running out of love
Just tell me how to love you better

How to love you
How to love you
How to love you better
How to love you
How to love you
How to love you better (I can love you better)
How to love you (how to love you)
How to love you (how to love you)
How to love you better (running out, running out, running out)
How to love you (how to love you)
How to love you
How to love you better (running out, running out, running out)

Don't say you're running out of love
Just tell me how to love you better
