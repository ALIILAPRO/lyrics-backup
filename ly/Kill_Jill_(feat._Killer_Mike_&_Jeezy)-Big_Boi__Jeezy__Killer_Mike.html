		  愛してよ 私を抱いてよ ねぇ、側においでよ
私の最後の記憶に 君の愛を残したい

Polo to the floor though, you already know doe
It's Adamsville for real, you see it hoe, just take a photo
I'm reppin' as I'm fo' door with a fo'-fo' on your bro though
'Cause that dodo thought that he could rob a player for some dough tho
I (pff-pff-pff-pff) oh no, on some Allen Temple
On some England manor, I'm so Mysty' Valley
And I gotta couple pounds yesterday outta Cali
And my bad bitch from the Valley brought me brand new Bally's
And I'm playin' with a new American dream, Dusty Rhodes
Man, she been ridin' clean since her daddy rode on vogues
I done fucked her in every hotel and every hole
I ain't fucked her with my wife, but if she meet her she might be a go
Ric Flair, Ric Flair flashy, bitch, don't I look dashin'?
Bitch don't I look classy, bitch, don't act so sassy
I'm the, I'm the man boo, that's with or without you
To hell with what your mouth say, show me what that mouth do

I hear 'em talking hella reckless, I won't even stress
Just kill 'em softly with my presence, won't even address it
They say it's lonely at the top, but this the best shit ever
Hey don't you see me out here shinin'? Bitch I'm barely flexin'
I hear 'em talking hella reckless, y'all won't even stress this
Just kill 'em softly with my presence, won't even address it
They say it's lonely at the top, this the best shit ever
And even if we die today this shit gon' live forever
Live forever (yeah)

Daddy Fat Saxxx with three X's, fuck niggas hit the exit
No S is on my chest but all these diamonds got me blessed
Usually I don't do this, dumb it down, go stupid
Since 17 been countin' M's, my bank account's on Goofy
They say Cosby gave 'em roofies, now who knows what the truth is (what?)
Chicago's full of shooters, my garage is full of hoopties
Got that Southern drawl and all that
My pretty rose look like ball-bats
The South got somethin' to say
And all y'all niggas can't get y'all ball back
If I ain't a hot boy then what it is, call Sax
Daddy Fat in it y'all, never fall back
Like clocks in the wintertime
We stay eating like it's dinnertime
Been feasting and chiefing and blowing big
But it ain't no reefer round
We don't know the meaning of drought
'Cause we keep it so wet, boy swear now it's been a while
Just speaking in general
While there is no formidable
Opponent or/and nigga that want it
Pure uncut, never step on it
Line for line, dope when you want it
Mine the kind to give a nigga hope
When they down and out
Nigga dig a hole so deep, ain't no climbin' out

I hear 'em talking hella reckless, I won't even stress
Just kill 'em softly with my presence, won't even address it
They say it's lonely at the top, but this the best shit ever
Hey don't you see me out here shinin'? Bitch I'm barely flexin'
I hear 'em talking hella reckless, y'all won't even stress this
Just kill 'em softly with my presence, won't even address it
They say it's lonely at the top, this the best shit ever
And even if we die today this shit gon' live forever
Live forever

Live forever
Live forever

Yo hoe, listen, just like I turned Coco
My vision is pimpin', you already know doe
So go hoe, stroll hoe for the po-po, that's my logo
Fo' sho hoe, pogo, get-get down on the flo' hoe, flo' doe
Yo hoe, listen, just like I told Coco
My vision is pimpin', you already know doe
So go hoe, stroll hoe for the po-po, that's my logo
Fo' sho hoe, pogo, now get down on the flo' hoe, flo' doe
On the flo', get down on the flo' hoe
On the flo', on the flo', get down on the flo' hoe
On the flo', on the flo', get down on the flo' hoe
