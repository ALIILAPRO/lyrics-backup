		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say that you don't like them
But I see you all the time i peep shit
You say that you don't like them
But I see you all the time i peep shit
You say that you don't like them
But I see you all the time i peep shit
You say that you don't like them
But I see you all the time i peep shit

Real shit I would never lie to
You real shit I would
Never lie to you I’m sick and tired of all
The exclamations are untrue about me
I don’t want these things
To be said about me yuh all this shit
In my mind I get out of so easily so easily
I can not even think about this so easily so
Easily that’s trap inside a bubble
I need to pop that bubble I need to
Pop that shit immediately
Need to pop that shit I
Need to stop shit immediately
I can’t overthink this over write
This I just want
To rewrite this story like I’m
The author I just need
An author to write out this book for me
Look out I just need to
Look out for this shit
Yeah this nonsense makes no
Sense this nonsense doesn’t
Make sense to me at all doesn’t make a single
Sense to me at all I’m talking money hah

People try to end off my
Happiness I don’t want
That shit people try to end off my
Happiness I don’t like that
Shit stop trying to
Kill my vibe I don’t need y’all to
Kill me Vibe please let me live my life
I just want to enjoy what’s going on
Please let me live my own live I just
Don’t want it to be controlled I
Don’t like that shit yes stay out of it yuh
Yuh I don’t want this shit on my
Mind I don’t want to shit in my head
Get this shit out of my head
I’m going dead brain dead
All these people are
Dead to me they wanna play me there
Just dead to me I said dead to
Me I said as I bleed slowly

Real shit I would never lie to
You real shit I would
Never lie to you I’m sick and tired of all
The exclamations are untrue about me
I don’t want these things
To be said about me yuh all this shit
In my mind I get out of so easily so easily
I can not even think about this so easily so
Easily that’s trap inside a bubble
I need to pop that bubble I need to
Pop that shit immediately
Need to pop that shit I
Need to stop shit immediately
I can’t overthink this over write
This I just want
To rewrite this story like I’m
The author I just need
An author to write out this book for me
Look out I just need to
Look out for this shit
Yeah this nonsense makes no
Sense this nonsense doesn’t
Make sense to me at all doesn’t make a single
Sense to me at all I’m talking money hah
