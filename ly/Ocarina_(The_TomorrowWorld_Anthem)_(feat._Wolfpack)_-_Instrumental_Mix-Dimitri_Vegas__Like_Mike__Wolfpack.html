		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me to a place where time is frozen
You don't have to close your eyes to dream
You can find escape inside this moment
And I will follow (I will follow)
I believe our love can take us higher
Please don't ever bring me back to earth
I know I'm never lost when you are near me
We'll find tomorrow (find tomorrow)

Don't you cry, take your time
Let the world wait forever
Morning light will be our guide
As long as we stay together

We can find tomorrow
