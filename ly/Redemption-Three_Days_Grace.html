		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know sorry is not enough
To erase all the pain from when I messed up
I'm not here to overturn my conviction
These eyes are on a road
The road to redemption

Well it's only until you lose
Everything that you love that you're forced to choose
And there's nothing like a crash to get your attention
To keep you on the straight
The road to redemption

I know there's nights when it felt like living hell
All those nights when I almost killed myself
In the end you never left
When I needed your forgiveness

It's a long way down from the fall
And the terrible truths, yeah, I own them all
And I had to hit the bottom to change my direction
To find my way back
Back to redemption

I know there's nights when it felt like living hell
All those nights when I almost killed myself
In the end you never left
When I needed your forgiveness

When everyone left me for dead
You never gave up, you never quit
I remember the words you said
We can still be good again

Now I'm looking you in the eyes
My soul on my sleeve, nothing more to hide
And I'm never going back to that condition
You showed me the way to redemption

I know there's nights when it felt like living hell
All those nights when I almost killed myself
In the end, you never left when
I needed your
Needed your forgiveness
