		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got a long, longneck way to go
Well, these heartbreak beers
They go down fast
But this getting over you
Is going down slow
And it's closing in on closing time
And I ain't even close
I've got a long, longneck way to go

Keep 'em cold
Keep 'em coming
Bartender don't tell me I'm running outta time
If these tears keep falling
Well, last call just might last all night

I got a long, longneck way to go
Well, these heartbreak beers
They go down fast
But this getting over you
Sure going down slow
And it's closing in on closing time
And I ain't even close
I've got a long, longneck way to go

Well I thought a couple rounds might do the trick
But you're still on my mind
And I lost count after five or six
Now it's two AM and I'm still buying
Got a tab, keep it open
'Cause I'm still drinking and I'm still hoping
To drown your memory
Oh, but it's got a pretty tight grip on me

I got a long, longneck way to go
Well, these heartbreak beers
They go down fast
But this getting over you
Sure going down slow
And it's closing in on closing time
And I ain't even close
I've got a long, longneck way to go
Yeah sure got a long, longneck way to go
