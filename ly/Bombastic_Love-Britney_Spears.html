		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am here to testify
That you're the only one I belong to
I don't know where to start
It turned into an art
Not to show the world that it was you
Who made me realize not to compromise
The fact that you and I should need
I know we're gonna get, know we're gonna get get

Bombastic Love
So fantastic
Where I'm completley yours and you are mine
And It's gonna be exactly like in a movie
When we fall in love for the first time

Don't know why I feel so insecure
I never understood what it stood for
I gotta make sure that blindness won't stop me again
I can't sit and wait anymore
You made me realize not to compromise
The fact that you and I should need
I know we're gonna get, know we're gonna get get

Bombastic Love
So fantastic
Where I'm completley yours and you are mine
And It's gonna be exactly like in a movie
When we fall in love for the first time

It's gonna be bombastic love
Everything is gonna be alright
When I'm yours and you are mine
It's gonna be fantastic love
When I wake up everything is still the same
And you don't even know my name

(I know it's gonna be)
Bombastic Love
So fantastic
Where I'm completley yours and you are mine
And It's gonna be exactly like in a movie
When we fall in love for the first time
I know we're gonna get, know we're gonna get get

Bombastic Love
So fantastic
Where I'm completley yours and you are mine
And It's gonna be exactly like in a movie
When we fall in love for the first time
