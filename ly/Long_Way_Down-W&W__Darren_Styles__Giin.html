		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  From gumdrop bubble pop
To your bone rattling rock
Wasting away with the years
From side-eying at you, sheer curiosity to
Breathing you in like you’re air

It’s a long way down from here
Can’t look back anymore cause i’m scared
It’s a long way down from here
When all i wanted was to be right there

By you, you
By you, you

Bright nights, city lights
Knowing that someday i might
Fade into one of the crowds
Just know i need you, need you
Way more than i wanted to
More than i say it aloud

It’s a long way down from here
I’m not sorry at all but i’m scared
It’s a long way down from here
When all i wanted was to be right there

By you, you
By you, you

All i wanted was to be right there
All i wanted was to be right there

By you, you
By you, you
