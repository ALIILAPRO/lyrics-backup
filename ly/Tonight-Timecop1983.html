		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm tired of waiting here all by myself
Waiting for the future with one thing in mind
I've been waiting all by myself with my dreams in my hands
No backup plan
I decide my own life; dice, poker face, lets dance tonight

I see her shining all by herself
She's been waiting for the right touch, work of art, perfect heart
To make it work, she thinks it would
I understand now, makes perfect sense
I dream the same thing 
Move by emotion 
Honest by deception, got you right to the core
We could have been here
Should of known you would take shortcuts straight to my heart


She shines, diamonds in the sky, breaking all the rules
Roll the dice, all night, gamble with a fragile heart
This is not enough to keep us up above the water, we're fading now
Just pictures in a dusty dream, memories, save just enough to live another day
And we try


And we try, to find another way
And we try, to live another day
And we try, to never part ways 
And we try, for peace everyday
Big world, maybe wrong time
Gotta be at the right place at the right time
Been doing me every night, is that a crime?
Bandana over eyes I swear I was blind
I swear I was lost, now I'm found
Remember your touch, remember we’re blind
Remember your voice, remember the lies
I was doing to much now my hands untied


She shines, diamonds in the sky, breaking all the rules
Roll the dice, all night, gamble with a fragile heart
This is not enough to keep us up above the water, we're fading now
Just pictures in a dusty dream, memories, save just enough to live another day
And we try
