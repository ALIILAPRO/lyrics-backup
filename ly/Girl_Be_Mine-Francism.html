		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let the sun shine
Let the rivers run away
Coz it?s a beautiful day now
To play now
As I close my eyes and pray
Lord have mercy on me
?Coz I?m feeling kinda lonely
Would you be, could you be?
My one and only

Took a train at a station
And almost lost my patience coz I was waiting
Damned rain delayed the train
Now I?m waitin? in vain
Just to see your face
Is this the one that I'm supposed to be afraid of
Is this the one that I'm supposed to be ashamed of
Hard as a rock not soft like play-do
Everytime I hear a song playing on the radio

Let the wind blow
Let the wind touch my face
I wanna take a little break now
Shake now
This is what I have to say
I feel so fine?
So fine that it blows my mind
Tell the truth
When will you? be mine

And in my dream you are so real
So it seems
Inside my head a giant screen
Plays every scene
While I scream
I feel you everytime I go to sleep
Wake up in the middle of the night
And I weep
It?s gotta be mine
That girl is so fine
Girl be mine
Girl be mine
All it takes is a matter of time

And in my dream you are so real
Or so it seems
Inside my head a giant screen
Plays every scene
So you see
I feel you everytime I go to sleep
All it takes is a matter of time
Tell the truth
Will you be mine

Sunshine
Let the rivers run away
Coz it?s a beautiful day now
To play now
As I close my eyes and pray
Lord have mercy on me
You know I'm feeling kinda lonely
Could you be, would you be?

Let the wind blow
Let the wind touch my face
I wanna take a little break now
Shake now
This is what I have to say
I feel so fine?
So fine the it blows my mind
Tell the truth
When will you? be mine

Let the sun shine
Let the rivers run away
Coz it?s a beautiful day now
To play now
And as I close my eyes and pray
Lord have mercy on me
You know I'm feeling kinda lonely
Could you be, would you be
Could you be, would you be
Could you be, would you be
Be mine
