		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's on
Lately, you've been like the bullet stuffed inside my gun
The restaurant's about to close, conversation carries on
Analyzing your thoughts, tryna see what you're on
Half drunk, fully high, you're grabbin' my wand
Leave your past in the rear, it's time we overcome
Our energies align inside of your pond

We could live the dream life, wild, oh
Got me feeling like a teen again, yeah
It's feeling like it's teenage love, hmm
If you feel the same way, then say some'
Say some' 
Say something, oh
I could make it worth your while if you say some' 

Say some'
Say some'

I been trying hard not to make scenes
I just got so much passion for you
You been sending mixed signals to me
I been staying moving close to you
I get so upset I fell in love
I get so excited next to you

We should run away, forget the crowd
We should run away, just me and you
Think of all the things that we could do

We could live the dream life, wild, oh
Got me feeling like a teen again, yeah
It's feeling like it's teenage love
If you feel the same way, then say some' (say some')
Say some' 
Say something, oh (if you feel the same way, then say some')

I need your love, oh-oh (love)
I need your love, oh-oh (your love)
I need your trust, whoa-oh (trust me)
I need you here

"So, so, how you, how you, how you scoop that?"
I told the bitch, 'Baby, I'd lie for you baby, I'll die for you, baby
Baby, I'll paint the sky for you baby', just like that brother"
"Word?"
"Just like that brother" (I need to be on that)
