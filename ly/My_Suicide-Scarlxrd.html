		  [Intro]
Cyanide
Plague
(Can't break the shit that's been broken)
(You gon' die with your eyes wide open)

Can't break the shit that's been broken
You gon' die with your eyes wide open
Fuck all their questions
Need a reason to live
I'll fuck my fucking life up if I want to
I'll go down with this shit

I'll pick the place I choose to die
I'll pick the place I choose to die
I'll pick the place I choose to die
I'll pick the place I choose to die

(Can't break the shit that's been broken)
(You'll diе with your eyes wide opеn)
Can't break shit, I ain't listening
Fuck yourself, you bitch
Bring the clique, you gon' need an army just to take the limb

Control, I know I'm in control
I know I'm in control
Stay the fuck away from me
Control, I know I'm in control
I know we're in control
God, let me be free
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up
What the fuck are you waiting for?

Yeah, I'll pick the place I choose to-
I'll pick the place I choose to d-
I'll pick the place I choose-
I'll-, I'll pick the place I choose to die


Can't break the shit that's been broken (Pussy)
You gon' die with your eyes wide open
Argh, I need a reason to fucking live
Fuck all their questions
Need a reason to live
I'll fuck my fucking life up if I want to
I'll go down with this shit

I'll pick the place I choose to die
I'll pick the place I choose to die
I'll pick the place I choose to die
I'll pick the place I choose to die
I'll pick the place I choose to die
I'll pick the place I choose to die
I'll pick the place I choose to die
I'll pick the place I choose to die
