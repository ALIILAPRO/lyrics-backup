		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's hard needing you
You're here but I'm all alone
You took my breath away
And filled my lungs with smoke
When I caught on fire
Thought you'd put me out
Dropped me off
I weighed you down
But all I wanted was your touch
Was I asking for too much
Am I not good enough for you
Asked a million times to dance
Hanging with an empty hand
Are you even sorry
Call me pretty I'll beg again
I'm invisible in the end
I can't make you want me
Now I'll make you sorry
Make you sorry
Wish you could feel the way
The way you made me feel
Would you take back
What you said
That none of it was real
Would you leave me in the grass
And let me grow a flower
Leave behind your only power
Asked a million times to dance
Hanging with an empty hand
Are you even sorry
Call me pretty I'll beg again
I'm invisible in the end
I can't make you want me
Now I'll make you sorry
I can't change you
We both know that
I can't leave you I would go back
Block your number
Showed up at my door
Left you standing in the cold
I'll make you jealous
And you won't care
I don't know why I even try
When I
Asked a million times to dance
Hanging with an empty hand
You're not even sorry
Call me pretty I'll beg again
I'm invisible in the end
I can't make you want me
Now I'll make you sorry
