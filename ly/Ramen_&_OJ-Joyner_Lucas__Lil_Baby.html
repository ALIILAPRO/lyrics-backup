		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got some needs, I need the money like I need to breathe
I need the hunnids, a lotta
Tell that lil' bitch that I'm outta her league, outta her league
Yeah, Joyner
Joyner, Joyner, Joyner

I got some needs, I need the money like I need to breathe
I needs some hunnids, and I need to scheme
I need the W by any means, yadada
Yadada mean, tell that lil' bitch that I'm outta her league
Enough is enough, and I think I'm allergic to suckers
You niggas keep makin' me sneeze
If them out for blood then I'm makin' 'em bleed
You try to run and I'm breakin' your knees
I made 'em fall like I'm rakin' the leaves
You know I ball like I play for the league
I mean what I say and I say what I mean
I ain't no joke, we ain't makin' no memes
If I pull up on 'em, I'm makin' a scene
Then I'm makin' 'em scream
Straight from the bricks, I need a lick
I dreamed about it since I was a jit
Nigga, I'm lit, I cannot miss
Came from the bottom and got me a check
Bitch, I'm a threat, I gotta flex
You want the crown but don't know what it takes
I am built different, I'm not what you think
I cannot lose, I go out with a bang
I hope you never say my name in vain
I'm with whatever, just not for no games
I know they say I changed, I cannot say the same
I bet they want me shackled and locked in the chains
I guess that's just what happens with bad news
On my mama, I never been fragile
I'm the wrong one to fuck with, it's taboo
Turn you niggas to R.I.P. tattoos
Still a youngin' but feel like a OG
Can't forget all this shit that they told me
Tired of niggas thinkin' that they know me
You gon' turn me back into the old me
You gon' turn me back into a savage
I done did shit you couldn't imagine
Leveled up and then bought me a mansion
I can never go back to a has-been

I can never go back to the old days, no way
Back to walkin' to work on a cold day
Back to thinkin' my ex was my soulmate
Back to tellin' myself, "We'll be okay"
We'll be okay, was survivin' off ramen and OJ
Shorty payin' the bills, I had no say
I can never go back to the bottom, to the bottom
Sellin' drugs, never know when the cops come
Niggas jealous, they wanted to rob us
I was just tryna get me some dollars, couple dollars
Turn my pennies from hundreds to commas
I'm so happy them days are behind us

I ride by different spots, I get flashbacks
I can't get on your level, I'm past that
Watch me run that shit up, I can't go back to nothin', tryna get to the top of the world
My nigga went crazy, walked in his condo and seen someone fuckin' his girl (girl)
Fuck all that spinnin' blocks, that's that lil' boy, shit, we catch him, we rockin' his world
I let everybody have their fun with me
Never had a woman say she done with me
I was workin', now I own the company
I keep money comin' in constantly
My lil' brodie them be having Runtz for cheap
Tryna get it, I been on the run for weeks
I'on't think none of you niggas can come for me
Both of my kids got it honestly
I'm the real deal, all the way, I don't half-step
Gotta do better than last year, that's my motto
Put a switch on the blick, fully auto
Put them thangs on the paint like I'm Rylo
Proud to say that I finally changed up
Why the fuck they keep bringin' my name up? 'Cause I'm poppin'

I can never go back to the old days, no way
Back to walkin' to work on a cold day
Back to thinkin' my ex was my soulmate
Back to tellin' myself, "We'll be okay"
We'll be okay, was survivin' off of ramen and OJ
I was payin' the bills, I had no say
I can never go back to the bottom, to the bottom
Sellin' drugs, never know when the cops come
Niggas jealous, they wanted to rob us
I was just tryna get me some dollars, couple dollars
Turn my pennies from hundreds to commas
I'm so happy them days are behind us

I'm so happy them days are behind me
I'm so happy the paper done found me
I done keep some good niggas around me
I got rid of them niggas who doubt me
Keepin' good energy and I'm prayed up
Tunnel vision, ain't nothing can faze us
Once you cross me, ain't nothin' can save you
Pull that thing out, and fuck it, it's dangerous
Bitch, I'm dangerous
