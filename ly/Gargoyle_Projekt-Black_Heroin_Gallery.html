		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My cart is stacked with Burnt bodies
With eyes as blue As the sky
The smell of burning meat
Soaks sweetly through my feet

Don't remove them
They protect you
Evil that guards them and keeps you  Safe from hell
I beg you, don't remove them
Or damnation will ring
Ring its bell

I tried to tell them It was a mistake as they removed
All the gargoyles from the church tops
Even priests burnt alive
On holy ground, swim fleshless
To the Nazarene.
I despise the demonic gathering
As legions marched on the
Ruins of God's beloved house
Just a simple plague doctor
I crawled inside a hollow body to hide

Don't remove them
They protect you
Evil that guards them and keeps you
Safe from hell
I beg you, don't remove them
Or damnation will ring
Ring its bell

I've come across a Family of gargoyles
Standing with melting flesh
Their wings burn like the sails of
A Viking ship screaming across the winter seas

I realize, as I push the cart to the end of the road
That no one will whisper in
My ears about love's affair of blood and sinister craft
They don't have the tools
To sculpt heaven's fearful door
Or the knowledge to understand hell's
Tempered score

Don't remove them
