		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm in the field, we goin' up
Tell 'em to cut all the lights out
We goin' up, we smokin' somethin'
(Census, what you cookin'?)

I'm in New York, where it be cold
Look at my neck 'cause it's iced out
I'm in the field, we goin' up (yeah)
Told 'em to cut all the lights out
You want a problem?
You better think about it (oh-oh) 'cause that come with a price now
I get a go, I do not think about it, I don't go with the hype style (we love you Tecca)
Yeah, you want a problem?
Lil' bitch, I ain't involved (involved)
Everything that we talk 'bout still left unresolved (resolved)
Baby, you was just the one playin', that's how I recall it (recall)
If I look through these Cartier frames, I don't even see love

Stayin' up, I get no rest, rest, rest, rest
Don't gotta sleep, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Fuckin' with bitches the best, best, best, best, (best, best, best) 
Shawty conceited
Fuck with the gang and you dead, dead, dead, dead, (dead, dead, dead)
You should've seen this
Put some dollars on your head, head, head, head, then I repeat it (yeah)

Diamonds wet, everywhere I go my diamonds cold, yeah (yeah)
Line 'em up, we could turn them into dominos, yeah (yeah)
Ridin' in the Benz, drop the top and now my hair in the wind, yeah (whoa)
She at it again, I'm at it again, we at it again (whoa)
Real shooters, they gon' do what it takes
Ski masks, they ain't showin' a face
No FaceTime, that might come with a case
Got no time, makin' minimum wage
Goin' hard, you see me out of state
Took her home and now she wanna stay
Said she mine, for tonight it's okay
We at it again, we at it again

I'm in New York, where it be cold
Look at my neck 'cause it's iced out
I'm in the field, we goin' up
Told 'em to cut all the lights out
You want a problem?
You better think about it 'cause that come with a price now (oh)
I get a go, I do not think about it, I don't go with the hype style
Yeah, you want a problem?
Lil' bitch, I ain't involved 
Everything that we talk 'bout still left unresolved 
Baby, you was just the one playin', that's how I recall it 
If I look through these Cartier frames, I don't even see love (oh)

Stayin' up I get no rest, rest, rest, rest (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don't gotta sleep, yeah
Fuckin' with bitches the best, best, best, best (best, best, best)
Shawty conceited (whoa)
Fuck with the gang and you dead, dead, dead, dead
You should've seen this (whoa, whoa)
Put some dollars on your head, head, head, head, then I repeat it (then I repeat it)

Still eatin' I can't even spell drought (spell drought)
It's been a long time, I swear to God
I could remember when we sleep in the trap house (remember we sleep in the trap house)
We shop in New York, we shop in Miami (oh)
In Vegas, we gamble and cash out (cash out)
These rappers play tough, but we always ready
And don't really see what the cap 'bout (don't really see what the cap 'bout)
Put some money on your head, head, head, head, I feel heartless (I feel heartless)
Baguettes in the Rolex on this new bitch, oh my darlin' (oh my darlin')
Tell promoters send the check and the jet, yeah, I don't bargain (I don't bargain)
Gunna taught you how to dress, nigga, say less, drippin' out hardest

I'm in New York, where it be cold
Look at my neck 'cause it's iced out
I'm in the field, we goin' up
Told 'em to cut all the lights out
You want a problem?
You better think about it 'cause that come with a price now
I get a go, I do not think about it, I don't go with the hype style
Yeah, you want a problem?
Lil' bitch, I ain't involved 
Everything that we talk 'bout still left unresolved 
Baby, you was just the one playin', that's how I recall it 
If I look through these Cartier frames, I don't even see love (oh)

Stayin' up I get no rest, rest, rest, rest (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don't gotta sleep, yeah
Fuckin' with bitches the best, best, best, best (best, best, best)
Shawty conceited (whoa)
Fuck with the gang and you dead, dead, dead, dead
You should've seen this (whoa, whoa)
Put some dollars on your head, head, head, head, then I repeat it
