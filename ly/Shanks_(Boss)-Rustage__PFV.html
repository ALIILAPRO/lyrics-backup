		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, they calling me the boss
And they love me
Put a hole up in your stomach
Leaving One Piece
Sword up on my hip, I'm 'bout to cut free
Way up high, and ain't nobody else above me
Yeah, they calling me the boss
And they love me
Put a hole up in your stomach
Leaving One Piece
Sword up on my hip, I'm 'bout to cut free
Way up high, and ain't nobody else above me

Anybody greater than me - I'd
Like to meet 'em
Only deadbeat 'cause that's the way
That I leavе 'em
They sure do talk a lot of words
But havе no purpose for speaking
So now you wanna challenge Shanks
You better give me a reason
'Cause I got three scars, better keep calm
Baby-sweetheart
Way I leave a scene arm in arm with senoritas
Charging me for battery when they
Just need a recharge
Way I give exposure to their
Innards like it's freelance
They can't gamble with the one-armed bandit
My opps barbaric
Disconnected like they not on bandwidth
They caught red handed, I step
In to the scene
I'm causing structural damage
They all like Absalom to me
I make these pussies vanish
The swords a language
They've never spoken advantage
And Beckman's open, I'm snapping
Their necks like Bon, and they gasping
Like heavy smokers
I damage the surface until they languid
Like melanoma, your men are jokers
Black and white? I'm red all over

Yeah, they calling me the boss
And they love me
Put a hole up in your stomach
Leaving One Piece
Sword up on my hip, I'm 'bout to cut free
Way up high, and ain't nobody else above me
Yeah, they calling me the boss
And they love me
Put a hole up in your stomach
Leaving One Piece
Sword up on my hip, I'm 'bout to cut free
Way up high, and ain't nobody else above me

They coming at me with no prior knowledge
When I walk up
Then they sleeping like an idle bop it
Connect this Haki to your systems
Like it's fibre optic
Send a message to the Gorosei, I'm
Shortening their time in office
I'm the topic i be topping lists, but
You're still unimportant, lining pockets
Getting to the cake like I'm Nigela Lawson
Quite a novice looking like a villain with
Your head proportions, size is horrid
Should be asking Mihawk which of us
Would make a better swordsman
Yonkos keep on dropping so bloody
But I refuse to change
Reaper's coming knocking unlucky
So they gon' roux the day
Way I keep on chopping like Buggy
I'm known to mutilate
They hide behind a flag - the
Way they hide behind an username
Illuminate a super star
Uta with the tunes and bars
I don't care 'bout who you are
I shut 'em up like うっせぇわ
They don't see the writing 'cause the
Golden age is due to start
Trained by Pirate Kings
So they gon' know this man
Is who's in charge

Yeah, they calling me the boss
And they love me
Put a hole up in your stomach
Leaving One Piece
Sword up on my hip, I'm 'bout to cut free
Way up high, and ain't nobody else above me
Yeah, they calling me the boss
And they love me
Put a hole up in your stomach
Leaving One Piece
Sword up on my hip, I'm 'bout to cut free
Way up high, and ain't nobody else above me
