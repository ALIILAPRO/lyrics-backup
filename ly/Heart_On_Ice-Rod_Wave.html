Look, uh, look

Heart been broke so many times I
Don't know what to believe
Mama say it's my fault, it's my fault I wear my heart on my sleeve
Think it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice
'Cause I can't breathe
I'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice
It's gettin' the best of me

While in the cell with Lil' Hakeem, after I slapped him I had told him
"I don't know how you get down with them clowns but I'm a soldier"
No one could understand, I had way too much aggression
That built over the years from my abandoned adolescence
See I done been lied to, backstabbed, and heartbroken
I wanted to cry but I was too afraid to open
Prayin' one day I'd find a peace of mind by the ocean
I spent all my time committing crimes to get closer
While at my nana house I play the couch, starin' at the ceiling
Tryin' not to get in my feelings
Thinkin' of a way I could make these millions
Maybe that'll take this pain away and clear up all these rainy days

Heart been broke so many times I
Don't know what to believe
Mama say it's my fault, it's my fault I wear my heart on my sleeve
Think it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice
'Cause I can't breathe
I'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice
It's gettin' the best of me

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Brrt
