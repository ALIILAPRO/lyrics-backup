		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wassup man, what you want?
Ay, man, let me get a eighth, man
You want a eighth?
You want that fat eighth or a little eighth?
How much money you got?
Get out my pockets homie, let me just get a regular eighth
Alright well, come on in, don't touch nothin' either
Smell-smell this, I just got this right here from Cambodia, it's a Cambodia Crispy
This ain't no Cambodia Crispy
Man, okay, I'ma be honest man, that's really CBD
But just give me, just give me thirty seven dollars and you can have that

If I could fly
I would probably never come down
With all of the bullshit confusion on the ground
I wish that I was high
'Cause I can't live my life when it's loud
So I'm gonna call the bros
Tell 'em, "Roll up one, right now"
I'm tryna smoke

I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so hig
That's just how I get by-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Lift that bird to the motherfucking sky
That's that pill, that's that fire, fire (I'm tryna smoke)
Don't you cry, don't you cry, I-I-I ain't full high
I'ma ride it, I just need to put my mind at ease (yeah)
Someone tell my baby mama I'm just tryna keep the peace
I ain't here for all that drama, I'm tryna smoke

Life's no fairytale, I know all too well (well)
Gotta plant the seed sometimes
Then you let it grow
Inhale, exhale some more
Heaven in Hell
If you know, you know
That shit is beautiful
You gotta just let it go
Spark up a blunt and smoke

You better blow that shit out, man
Yeah, yeah

If I could fly (if I could fly, yeah)
I would probably never come down (yeah)
With all of the bullshit confusion on the ground
I wish that I was high
'Cause I can't live my life when it's loud (you know I can't live that way)
So I'm gonna call the bros
Tell 'em, "Roll up one, right now"
I'm tryna smoke

Tryna keep myself from looking over the edge (over the edge)
I know life's a bitch, but she could at least give me head ('least give me head)
Sometimes, I mean, is that too much to ask? (Too much to ask)
That's why lately I've been smokin' on gas (smokin' gas)
I know God is good, I know he keep me alive
I be probably talking to him most when I'm high
When I'm high, I see all this shit crystal clear
When I'm high, I see through the smoke and the mirrors

If I could fly
I would probably never come down
With all of the bullshit confusion on the ground
I wish that I was high
'Cause I can't live my life when it's loud
So I'm gonna call the bros
Tell 'em, "Roll up one, right now"
I'm tryna smoke

He's a janky dealer, why you make me drink?
What you want, bruh, what you want, man?
Smell some-smell this right here, man
Man, it's passion fruit?
Man, that's Coleslaw OG, baby
The fuck is Coleslaw OG?
Just gimme sixty-five dollars
Sixty-five dollars? You got me fucked up
Okay, well, give me forty-eight dollars man, come on man
That's a fat bag, baby
Forty-eight dollars?
That's whole ass- you can't even close the bag, man
Come on, man, goddamn man, I c- gas is goin' up
Gimme-Gimme thirty-nine dollars, damn it
