		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woo-ooh (woo-ooh)
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)

All the walls around you
They're built to keep me in
They're built to keep me out
All the nights we talked through
The stories we forgot
The treasures that we found

We're friends and we're enemies
You're always forgivin' me
So here's to the misery
The change and the liberty

Oh, love don't hate me
When I let you down
It's all I ever think, all I ever think
All I ever think about
Oh but, love don't hate me
When I let you down
You're the only one I think, only one I think
Only one I think about, yeah

Woo-ooh (woo-ooh)
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)

We could get a matching tattoo
But I want you more than that
I need you more than that
'Cause I get lost without you

I look for you in me
All the change and the liberty

Oh, love don't hate me
When I let you down
It's all I ever think, all I ever think
All I ever think about
Oh but, love don't hate me
When I let you down
You're the only one I think, only one I think
Only one I think about, yeah

Woo-ooh (woo-ooh)
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)

All the walls around you
And all the nights we talked through
I'd be lost without you
Oh, love don't hate me

Oh, love don't hate me
When I let you down
It's all I ever think, all I ever think
All I ever think about
Oh but, love don't hate me
When I let you down
You're the only one I think, only one I think
Only one I think about, yeah
Love don't hate me (oh)
When I let you down
It's all I ever think, all I ever think (oh)
All I ever think about (All I ever think about)
Oh but, love don't hate me (oh, love don't hate me)
When I let you down
You're the only one I think, only one I think
Only one I think about, yeah
