		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ""Violent bursts of rape induced frenzy another dies by these hands of mine. I feel sick of these useless lumps of flesh that stain my eyes. Faceless they're watching me it seems they know my every thought and sin. My desire for the blood that stains my soul. Tearing at her flesh to know what is behind her skin. Her legs are open wide to ram my dick in. Smash her down this bitch has gotta go I cannot bear to let her live. Then she begs so I break her fucking neck. Conflicting personalities they haunt me but I cannot see Blinded instinct forces me to kill. Tied up gagged and bound ass is up face is down. Resist sodomy virgin ass bleeds for me. Hacked up slashed up fucked up smashed up Scrape the shit out of her ass and stuff it right up her cunt. Down on her knees so I can Kick out her teeth so she can't Bite my rancid cock rape this bitch Cut her fucking throat kill. Body shaking my hands are sweating as I grasp her scrawny neck. Visions plague me as I release this beast inside my head. Savage wounds her skull is caved in Vicious wounds her ribs are smashed in Rape induced wounds her cunt is kicked in frenzied attack. Skinned and fucked. Voices inside of my head they make me kill they'll overcome. The faceless I feel them beneath my skin I will succumb. I am the faceless.""
