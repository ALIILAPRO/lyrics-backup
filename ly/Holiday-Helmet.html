		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time for your holiday serial murder
How time slips away
She was somebody's daughter
He was just a mama's boy

Dumb luck you numb fuck
Dumb bass, fuckface
Izod, dickwad
You hot rod, my God

Fa, fa, fa, fa, far away
Just another soulless cliche
You're fa, fa, fa, fa, far away
Another loser on my TV

The sun, the moon
Doom, gloom
Stars, wars
Butter, gloves
Tongue tip, you dipshit
Asshat, fuckwit

You're fa, fa, fa, fa, far away
Just another soulless cliche
You're fa, fa, fa, fa, far away
One more loser on my TV

It's time for your holiday serial murder
How time slips away
She was somebody's daughter
He was just a mama's boy
Playing the martyr

You're fa, fa, fa, fa, far away
Just another soulless cliche
You're fa, fa, fa, fa, far away
Another loser on my TV
