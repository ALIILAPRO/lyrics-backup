		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something good
Oh, something good
Oh, something good
Oh, something good tonight
Make me forget about you for now

Get high, hit the floor before you go
Matador, estocada, you're my blood sport

But something good
Oh, something good
Oh, something good
Oh, something good tonight
Make me forget about you for now

Forty-eight thousand seats 
Bleats and roars for my memories of you
Now that I'm fully clean 
The matador is no more, he's dragged from view

Get high, hit the floor before you go
Matador, estocada, you're my blood sport

Forty-eight thousand seats 
Bleats and roars for my memories of you
Now that I'm fully clean 
The matador is no more, he's dragged from view

But something good
Oh, something good
Oh, something good
Oh, something good tonight
Make me forget about you for now
