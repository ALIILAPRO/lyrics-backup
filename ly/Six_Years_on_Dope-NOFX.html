		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was a misanthrope on the end of a rope
I spent twenty years, six years on dope
Taking a piss while giving up hope
I lived a lifetime six years on dope

I was a human trash can
Shortening my life span
Live fast, die tan
I think that was the plan
Saving all my money for a one way ticket to Afghanistan
Yeah

I was ezoobeson drunk
Strung out on junk
Live fast, die punk
I thought I was sunk
From gin swilling and fish tank penicillin

I was a moron bro with impetigo
A pleased as punch Dog Patch Wino
Casual sex and herpes complex
Now I'm on Interferon and Valtrex

I was a child adult, a walking insult
Every shot got more difficult

I was a teenage trash bin
A breathing mannequin
A caustic cause
Who musta loved suffering
Do pinhole eyes romanticize heroin

I was a moron bro, a circus sideshow
A dying slow Dog Patch Wino
