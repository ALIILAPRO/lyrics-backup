		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some have fought battles in fields full of cattle
And some have waged war out at sea
Some in militias and some with malicious intent
Some men just want to be
Free from oppression and so their aggression
Is worn like a badge on their sleeve
Some have fought battles from desks in Seattle
And some have waged war on the street

Guess this is the hill I will die on
I woke up this morning, put my suit and tie on
Walked down to the bus that I ride on
The air felt so still, I guess this is the hill
I guess this is the will I will write on
The back of this bill, with my pen as my quill
And I hope you'll still love me when I'm gone
The air felt so still, I guess this is the hill I will

Mm-na
Mm-na-na-na
Mm-hm-na
Mm-na-na-na

Some fight with rifles and some use the Bible
And some use a shield and a knife
Some author libel which sometimes goes viral
And ruins an innocent life
Leaves an impression, teaches no lesson
And leads to regression and strife
Some fight to stifle and some 'cause it's primal
And some 'cause they're sure that they're right

Guess this is the hill I will die on
I woke up this morning, put my suit and tie on
Walked down to the bus that I ride on
The air felt so still, I guess this is the hill
I guess this is the will I will write on
The back of this bill, with my pen as my quill
And I hope you'll still love me when I'm gone
The air felt so still, I guess this is the hill I will die on

Mm-na
Mm-na-na-na
Mm-hm-na
Mm-na-na-na
Die on
Mm-na
Mm-na-na-na
Mm-hm-na
Mm-na-na-na

Some fight with rifles and some use the Bible
And some use a shield and a knife

Guess this is the hill I will die on
I woke up this morning, put my suit and tie on
Walked down to the bus that I ride on
The air felt so still, I guess this is the hill
I guess this is the will I will write on
The back of this bill, with my pen as my quill
And I hope you'll still love me when I'm gone
The air felt so still, I guess this is the hill I will die on

Mm-na
Mm-na-na-na
Mm-hm-na
Mm-na-na-na
Die on
Mm-na
Mm-na-na-na
Mm-hm-na
Mm-na-na-na
