		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been spendin' time, time after time
Tryna get my mind right but I just find I been lyin'
Lyin' to myself, I don't need your help
I been just fine on my own, baby, I could handle mine
I could multiply, I could satisfy
Anybody tryna see me shine, man, that's just the way I grind
I been on my grind, you been on my line
That's the reason why I been workin' hard, you could stand aside

I could never die, I got too much pride
That's why she always cryin' to me, I'll live forever through my vibe
I can never die, I got too much pride
That's why she always cryin' to me, I'll live forever through my vibe

That's why she always cryin' to me, I'll live forever through my vibe

That's why she always cryin' to me, I'll live forever through my vibe
