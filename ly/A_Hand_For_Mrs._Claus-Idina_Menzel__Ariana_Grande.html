		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every December, we always remember
To celebrate the fella in the suit
We see the promos for reindeer and his glow nose
Believe me, I think Rudolph's nose is cute
Now I'm a fan of Frosty, I go ga-ga for The Grinch
But beneath the hype, are they the type you'd turn to in a pinch?
There's someone more deserving of applause
How 'bout a hand for Mrs. Claus?

I'm not complaining, I'm sure it's very draining
Pulling off a Christmas Eve world tour
My point in this is it's his marvelous missus
Who gets it done the other three-six-four
Who's really checkin' all those lists
And fillin' all them shelves?
She's a master multitasker who works faster than the elves
Who keeps the North Pole hot 'til winter thaws?
The answer's clear, it's Mrs. Claus

She reads every Christmas letter
Fills out a Christmas sweater
Better than old Santa any day
She runs the operation
With no appreciation
Send a little Christmas love her way
Oh, oh yeah

She just gets no respect
She works so hard

Now I'll sing a fa-la-la
And I'll shout a ho-ho-ho
But I'm bouncin' out this ballad for the gal who runs the show
Join me in this very worthy cause
How 'bout a hand for? (ohh yeah)
Let's make it grand for (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Everybody stand for Mrs. Claus
