		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Done made it out this shit
Oh yeah

I had to get it out the mud, had to turn up, nigga, no sleep (sleep)
I used to want a hunnid bands, now I make a hunnid bands in a week (week)
I never really gave a fuck about 'em, they ain't never cared about me (me)
And every time you see me out, you know I keep a strap case they try to creep (brrt)
JPays and the Green Dots, do that shit every week
Niggas get killed all over screenshots, Instagram, and the tweets (tweets)
Screamin' fuck all the opps now, send the location, we can meet (meet)
Bitches fuckin' for the clout now, name bad out in these streets (streets), damn

Uh, I'm losin' my sanity
I done been fucked up all my life, this shit was planned for me (on God)
And I don't know nothin' 'bout that bitch, but she been stayin' with me
How you think I'm gon' trust that bitch? I don't trust my own family (no)
And this shit was plain to see, them niggas, they wasn't really gang with me (gang)
I ain't have nowhere to sleep, tell me who was out there in the rain with me? (Huh?)
This money controllin' me (controllin'), the streets got a hold of me (goddamn)
Lil' shawty wanna roll with me (yeah), she give her all to me
I was runnin' them racks up, had to get it, I don't waste time (bands)
I fuck up a check all on my neck, young nigga shine (ice, ice, ice)
I'm speedin', yeah, I'm racin' (skrrt) 
I'm rollin' in the matrix (the matrix)
Lil' shawty, yeah, she naked (she naked) 
Can't fuck that ho, she basic

I had to get it out the mud, had to turn up, nigga, no sleep (sleep)
I used to want a hunnid bands, now I make a hunnid bands in a week (week)
I never really gave a fuck about 'em, they ain't never cared about me (me)
And every time you see me out, you know I keep a strap case they try to creep (brrt)
JPays and the Green Dots, do that shit every week
Niggas get killed all over screenshots, Instagram, and the tweets (tweets)
Screamin' fuck all the opps now, send the location, we can meet (meet)
Bitches fuckin' for the clout now, name bad out in these streets (streets), damn

And I'm good when I hang where it's dangerous (turn up)
I mix my Perc' with my pain (on God)
JPay so you can't complain (on God)
How the fuck you broke with a name? (Yeah)
I risk my life for the gang (for the gang)
I like weed, not cocaine (cocaine)
No sneak diss, say it to your face (bitch)
My crayhead came with a K (yeah, yeah, yeah)
How you say family don't matter? Yeah
Police came and I scatter (scatter)
That Glock-30 come with a ladder, uh
Locked up, they won't let him out
Bet he come up dead for the clout (yeah)
How he shouldn't ran his mouth
How he shouldn't
Now he caught that bullet (that bullet)
Backwoods Cookie (Backwoods Cookie), uh
He a goofy (he a goofy)
Yeah, super goofy (super goofy), uh
Why the fuck they didn't believe us?
Hope them niggas never need us
And I know a whole killer
But he turned into a diva

I had to get it out the mud, had to turn up, nigga, no sleep (sleep)
I used to want a hunnid bands, now I make a hunnid bands in a week (week)
I never really gave a fuck about 'em, they ain't never cared about me (me)
And every time you see me out, you know I keep a strap case they try to creep (brrt)
JPays and the Green Dots, do that shit every week
Niggas get killed all over screenshots, Instagram, and the tweets (tweets)
Screamin' fuck all the opps now, send the location, we can meet (meet)
Bitches fuckin' for the clout now, name bad out in these streets (streets), damn
