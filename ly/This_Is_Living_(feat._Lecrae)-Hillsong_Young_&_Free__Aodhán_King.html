		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Waking up knowing there's a reason
All my dreams come alive
Life is for living with You
I've made my decision

You lift me up, fill my eyes with wonder
Forever young in Your love
This freedom's untainted with You
No moment is wasted

See the sun now bursting through the clouds
Black and white turns to colour all around
All is new, in the Savior I am found

This is living now
This is living now
This is living now

You lead the way, God You're right beside me
In Your love I'm complete
There's nothing like living with You
This life You created I choose

See the sun now bursting through the clouds
Black and white turn to color all around
All is new, in the Savior I am found

This is living now
This is living now
This is living now
You take me higher than I've been before
It's Your perfect love that sees me soar
God your freedom is an open door
You are everything I want and more

Maybe I ain't really know what living is
Is it love if it was am I living it?
Do I live in it? So astounding
Love is an ocean you can drown me
The sweet embrace the lovely taste
I taste and see I'm under Grace
The place to be
It means I don't ever need an umbrella
I'm cool in the cold and the hot weather
Whether or never I ever understand
I'm a man in the hands of great plans
I stand with faith in a life I never known or touched
It's still outside my clutch but
I'm like what's to dream of and what's to hope in
What's to die for and live to no end
This is living
The life I've been given's a gift
If I'm gonna live it I'm gonna live it to death!
So what's to dream of and what's to hope in
What's to die for and live to no end
This is living
The life I've been given's a gift
If I'm gonna live it I'm gonna live it to death!

This is living now
This is living now
This is living now

This is living now
This is living now
This is living now
You take me higher than I've been before
It's Your perfect love that sees me soar
God your freedom is an open door
You are everything I want and more
