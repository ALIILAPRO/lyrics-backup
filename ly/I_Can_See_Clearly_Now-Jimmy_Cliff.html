		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can see clearly now the rain is gone
I can see all obstacles in my way
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind

It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sunshiny day
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sunshiny day

Oh, yes I can make it now the pain is gone
All of the bad feelings have disappeared
Here is that rainbow I've been praying for

It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sunshiny day
Look all around, there's nothing but blue skies
Look straight ahead, there's nothing but blue skies

I can see clearly now the rain is gone
I can see all obstacles in my way
Here is that rainbow I've been praying for

It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sunshiny day
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sunshiny day

Bri-ri-ri-ri', bright, (bright)
Bright (bright) sunshiny day, yeah, eh
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sunshiny day

It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sunshiny day, yeah, na
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sunshiny day

Bri-ri-ri-ri', bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sunshiny day
