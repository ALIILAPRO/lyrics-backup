		  War over me

I'm standing on the front lines
I'm fighting for my soul
I've walked a self-destructive lonely road

I wrap the warning signs
But I was too blind to see
I had to feel the pain 
'Til I believed

(I have a purpose)
This is war
This is war
Since the day I was born
I will die just to live, just to bleed

I will fight for my life
Turn my darkness to light
This is war
It's a war over me
War over me
War over me

My pretty face destruction
My hunger turns to greed
But nothing ever fills this whole in me

No peace on the horizon
No peace in anything
I had to hurt myself
'Til I believed

(I have a purpose)
This is war
This is war
Since the day I was born
I will die just to live, just to bleed

I will fight for my life
Turn my darkness to light
This is war
It's a war over me

I'm caught up in the crossfire
I'm caught up in the pain
This gift of desperation
Is exactly what I need
I'm falling like an empire
I'm calling out your name
I'm locked in my own prison
Tell me help is on the way
Tell me help is on the way

I will fight for this life
Turn my darkness to light
This is war
It's a war over me

This is war
This is war
Since the day I was born
I will die just to live, just to bleed

I will fight for my life
Turn my darkness to light
This is war
It's a war over me

This is war
It's a war over me
War over me

(I have a purpose)
