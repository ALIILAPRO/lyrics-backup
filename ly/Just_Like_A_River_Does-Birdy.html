		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I always cry, on the train back home
Watchin' the world outside, I used to know
Soon as I get there
I have to go

And the years go by, don't even know where I've been
In the blink of an eye, could've all been a dream
Will I ever find somewhere
To call my home
Soon as I get there
I have to go
 
With two hands, meant to shape the land
Just like a river does, just like a river does
Another day breaks, and I have to go away
Gone like a river does
All alone like a river does
 
And the landscape has changed, since last I was here
Some people stay and some disappear
But I'll always remember
This part of me
And I can't help but wonder
How I ever leave
 
With two hands, meant to shape the land
Just like a river does, just like a river does
Another day breaks, and I have to go away
Run like a river does
All alone like a river does
 
Woah, oh oh, oh
Oh oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh ooh, woo ooh
 
With two hands, meant to shape the land
Just like a river does, just like a river does
Another day breaks, and I have to go away
Run like a river does
All alone like a river does
 
So I bottle the sound of the wind in the trees
Follow the salt in the air, down to the sea
Just like a river does
Just like a river does
