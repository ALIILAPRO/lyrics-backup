		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nobody feels the pain behind the love you show
Nobody feels the burden that is yours alone
If when the morning comes you're not with me (destiny)
I know that you'll return with destiny

Only you can truly understand
The measure of a hero is the measure of a man
(I wanna kiss it better, the measure of a man)
The measure of a man
(I wanna kiss it better, the measure of a man)

Your body bears the scars of every man I know
So softly I wanna kiss it better, the scarlet letter
To me you don't belong
If when the morning comes you're not with me (destiny)
I know that you'll return with destiny

Only you can truly understand
The measure of a hero is the measure of a man
(I wanna kiss it better, the measure of a man)
The measure of a man
(I wanna kiss it better, the measure of a man)

It's the manners that make a man
But the hammers that break a man
Damn, they wanted to see me broke
But I flipped the script and I broke the pen
Young and wealthy
Don't let it overwhelm me
I still give thanks, still can't tell me
Nothin', the system failed me, I still bounced back
I run this ting, got a lot of endurance
What you know about drastic measures?
I married the hustle
Me and the game like Harry and Meghan
Some man in my hood too jealous
Why do you think that we carry a weapon?
Take time and trust the process
Life's a game of chess, not checkers
Told bro that, "You gotta stop stressin'
Gotta stop thinkin' you won't get through it
It's all in your mind, I failed a couple of times
I got up and got back to it"

Only (only) you can (you can) truly (truly) understand
The measure (measure) of a (of a) hero is the measure of a man
The measure of a man

Only you can truly understand
The measure of a hero is the measure of a man
The measure of a man, ohh
