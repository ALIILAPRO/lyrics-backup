		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is beabadoobee
And this is my cover of Between the Bars by Elliott Smith

Drink up, baby, stay up all night
With the things you could do, you won't but you might
The potential you'll be, that you'll never see
The promises you'll only make
Drink up with me now and forget all about
The pressure of days, do what I say
And I'll make you okay and drive them away
The images stuck in your head

People you've been before
You don't want them around anymore
They push and shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still

Drink up, baby, look at the stars
I'll kiss you again, between the bars
And I seen you there, with your hands in the air
Waiting to finally be caught
Drink up one more time and I'll make you mine
I'll keep you apart, deep in my heart
Separate from the rest, where I like you the best
Keep the things you forgot

People you've been before
You don't want them around anymore
They push and shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still
