		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The sun is your enemy today
Have you heard the news that the world isn't ending
It's starting again
But all the nonbelievers they keep on pretending

The sun is your enemy today
You love to look away from the face of your vices
Embrace them instead
And welcome yourself into the new modern crisis

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, I've been waiting
Oh oh oh oh oh
Disciple in the making

Kill the system
Kill the man
Strip the power from their hands
Your eyes will bleed as you stare at the screen

You shall remain
Inside your space

2 3 Go!

The sun is my enemy today
I'm running from the misery like there's no tomorrow
Let's share it with them
And show all the world that this life isn't borrowed time

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, I've been waiting
Oh oh oh oh oh
Disciple in the making

Kill the system
Kill the man
Strip the power from their hands
Your eyes will bleed as you stare at the screen

You shall remain
Inside your space

Swimming with the fishes till they drown
Love is just another excuse we rely on
Palpable but hidden in the sound
Hate will always be a good friend when the sun goes down

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, hear my calling
Oh oh oh oh oh
Nonbelievers start running
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, I've been waiting
Oh oh oh oh oh
Disciple in the making

Kill the system
Kill the man
Strip the power from their hands
Your eyes will bleed as you stare at the screen

You shall remain
Inside your space of ignorance
