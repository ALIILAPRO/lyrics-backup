Welcome to Honcho World, the Migo Gang Dynasty (Dynasty)
Yeah, get your lil' money for my niggas, minus it (go get it, go get it)
I promise you lil' niggas don't want the violence (no smoke, no smoke)
Migos scrap, issue silence (pshew, pshew, pshew)
It's a shame, these young niggas drinkin' Wocky (Wock', Wock')

Walk it like I talk it (walk it)
All these hoes stalkin' (stalkin')
Shake these haters off me (shake it)
You got a big mouth (big mouth)
Like a gator talkin' (gator)
Then I take the pot, skrrt, skrrt
Fork it, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Gumbo, like I'm from New Orleans (skrrt, skrrt)
Lil' bitch said she hate me, fuck it, go and divorce me (fuck it)
I iced out her neck in A.P., but she won't report it (she swear she down)

Lamb talk, uh, yeah
Lamb talk, Lamborghini (woo)
