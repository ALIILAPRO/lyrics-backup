		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You acting like you hate me (hate me, yeah)
Where is your love?
You do too much complaining (complaining, yeah)
Where is your trust? (Trust, trust)

Flyin' in a Wraith, yeah
Pass by time through the day, yeah (skrrt)
Blinded with hate, yeah
I ain't got time for the chase, yeah
Just me and my bae, yeah
Wanna shop, get the racks out the safe, yeah
We gon' party 'til late, yeah
Do the dash in the whip on the jakes, yeah

Ice tray, diamonds on froze, get a migraine
Life on the edge, live it up on the high lane
Me and Trippie Redd back to back on the same thing
Late night, turnt in the club doing my thing
Sip drank, get a cup, I'ma pour the whole thing
Shawty playin' games, she don't wanna sell her soul, man
Sayin' that she love me but I'm knowing that she don't, man
Playing back and forth, probably thinking I'm dumb, man
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout a bitch, nigga, worry 'bout a check
(Worried 'bout a bitch, nigga, worry 'bout a check)
Nigga, VVS diamonds, lil' nigga had to flex
(Nigga, VVS diamonds, lil' nigga had to flex)
Nigga hoppin' out the 'Rari them I'm hoppin' in the jet
(Nigga hoppin' out the 'Rari them I'm hoppin' in the jet)
Bad little bitch all on my dick, I want the neck
Ayy, she want the dick, I don't want sex, I want the neck (I want the neck)
Ayy, me and YoungBoy tossing these hoes, we want the neck, ayy (we want the neck)
Whole full moon in the middle of the day
I done jumped out my sleep, heard the phone go ring
Back to back, we be flippin' these hoes on a train
Keep a pole, we never be playin' no games
Diamonds gon' shine, put an 8 on my chain
I done ran up the money, stay true to the gang
Diamonds, they shining, that's all through the rain
Through all the mud and through all the pain

Acting like you hate me (hate me)
Where is your love? (Where is your love?)
You do too much complaining (too much complaining)
Where is your trust? (Where's your trust? Yeah)

Flyin' in a Wraith, yeah (skrrt)
Pass by time through the day, yeah (time through the day)
Blinded with hate, yeah
I ain't got time for the chase, yeah (time for the chase)
Just me and my bae, yeah
Wanna shop, get the racks out the safe, yeah (out the safe)
We gon' party 'til late, yeah
Do the dash in the whip on the jakes, yeah
