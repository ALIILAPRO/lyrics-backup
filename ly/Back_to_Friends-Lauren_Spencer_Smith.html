		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Guess you were right to hide the way you feel
We'd keep pretending like it wasn't real
Said you need space and now I finally understand 
Why you refused to take my hand

When you're in love it's hard to hide the truth
I know you better than you think I do
Looking back I see I should've held my tongue
But I was immature and young

I miss the uncertainty 
And all the nights of losing sleep
Just two kids and make believe
Can we go back to how it used to be?

'Cause I'd die a thousand times 
Not to have you on my mind
And I wish we never met, or I hated you instead
'Cause I think we messed this up
Falling in and out of love
Wish I could pick a different end
Can we go back to being friends?

Guess I'm the right person at the wrong time
I'm the type of crazy to ignore the signs
And now I see you've got some shit to figure out
And that's the reason you can't love me now

I miss the uncertainty 
And all the nights of losing sleep
Just two kids and make believe
Can we go back to how it used to be?

'Cause I'd die a thousand times 
Not to have you on my mind
And I wish we never met, or I hated you instead
'Cause I think we messed this up
Falling in and out of love
Wish I could pick a different end
Can we go back to being friends?

Ooh-ooh-ooh 
Can we go back to being friends?
Ooh-ooh-ooh 
Can we go back to being friends?

'Cause I'd die a thousand times 
Not to have you on my mind
And I wish we never met, or I hated you instead
'Cause I think we messed this up
Falling in and out of love
If I could pick a different end
I'd go back to being friends
