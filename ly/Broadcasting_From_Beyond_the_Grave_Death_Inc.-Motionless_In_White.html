		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Good evening, you're listening to Broadcasting from Beyond the Grave
Tonight's chilling episode, Death Incorporated

Can you hear the bell toll, little scarecrow?
Radio, (you're) burnin' like a star in a black hole
Did you get the memo?
Pretty typo Romeo
Cutting you up like a Van Gogh

You're not fucking with us
We're not fucking with you
So you can fuck yourself, and your puppet suit
You're the wizard of flaws
We've got nothing to lose
So you can fuck yourself and your little dog too
Yeah, you can fuck yourself, we've got nothing to prove

We are the weirdos
In your stereo
Disco freak show
Death Incorporated

We are the weirdos
In the microphone
Supernatural
Death Incorporated

From beyond, yeah
Don't belong, yeah
Turn it on, yeah
Death Incorporated

Do you feel like a psycho?
Dirty needle rodeo
Painting your disease like a digital Picasso
Feelin' so bad that nobody's gonna need you
Spinnin' in your grave but nobody's gonna hear you

We are the weirdos
In your stereo
Disco freak show
Death Incorporated

We are the weirdos
In the microphone
Supernatural
Death Incorporated

Hush little baby, go for a ride, we'll take a little trip to the afterlife
Hush little baby, bump in the night, demon in the daylight
Shadow in the limelight

From beyond, yeah
Don't belong, yeah
Turn it on, yeah
Drop the bomb

We are the weirdos
In your stereo
Disco freak show
Death Incorporated

We are the weirdos
In the microphone
Supernatural
Death Incorporated

From beyond, yeah
Don't belong, yeah
Turn it on, yeah
Death Incorporated

From beyond, yeah
Don't belong, yeah
Turn it on, yeah
Death Incorporated
Let's go

Until next time
For more haunting tales of terror and mystery
This is Broadcasting from Beyond the Grave
Who's the boss now?
Who
