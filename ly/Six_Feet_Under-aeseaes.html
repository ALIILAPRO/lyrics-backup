		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  help, I lost myself again
but I remember you
don't come back, it won't end well
but I wish you'd tell me to

our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
if our grave was watered by the rain
would roses bloom?
could roses bloom
again

retrace my lips, erase your touch
it's all too much for me
blow away like smoke in air
how can you die carelessly

our love is six feet under
i can't help but wonder
if our grave was watered by the rain
would roses bloom
could roses bloom

they're playing our sound
laying us down tonight
and all of these clouds
crying us back to life

six feet under
i can't help but wonder
if our grave was watered by the rain
would roses bloom
could roses bloom
