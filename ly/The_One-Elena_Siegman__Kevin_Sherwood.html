		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All my life I've been debating
All the crows they sit there waiting
Wondering what I'm going to eat
Until I have it I can't breathe

I only see you on the floor
Your hearts not beating anymore
My lust for you it cannot wait
Your skin it tastes like chocolate

Staring blankly at the sun
Waiting for my time to come
Your good life it makes me sick
All the screaming sounds like music

Losing all my holy dreams
Someone tell me what they mean
There's a smell of iron blood in the air
But I can't find it anywhere

I've been waiting for someone to find me
And become a part of me (A part of...)
I've been waiting for you
To come here
And kill me
And set me free
I've been waiting for the one

Blood's flavor is so metallic
It's smell makes me go phrenetic
Textures that I find in you is a thick vicious glue
Some nights I become so clean
With all I touch and all I see
There's an iron smell of blood in the air
But now I see it everywhere

I've been waiting for someone to find me
And become a part of me (A part of me...)
I've been waiting for you
To come here
And kill me
And set me free (Oh)
I've been waiting for the one

I've been waiting for someone to find me
And become a part of me (A part of me...)
I've been waiting for you to
Come here
And kill me (Oh)
I've been waiting for the one
