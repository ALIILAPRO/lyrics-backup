		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me take you to Rio, Rio
Fly'o the ocean like an eagle
And when can chill in my gazebo, gazebo
Oh oh oh oh oh, na na na

Let me take you to Rio, Rio
Fly'o the ocean like an eagle
And when can chill in my gazebo, gazebo
Oh oh oh oh oh, na na na

All in together now, hang like the weather now
(Rio Rio oh oh, Rio Rio)
Right here, show me now
You know how to put it down
(Rio Rio oh oh, Rio Rio)
You gotta light girl, turn it on, here's mine, turn me on
(Rio Rio oh oh, Rio Rio)
You gotta wild side, let it out, ima make you bring it out
(Rio Rio oh oh, Rio na na na )

Shake it up fast, wind it up slow now
Just move your body girl
Work it to the floor
Let your body go now, now now, oh oh oh

Let me take you to Rio, Rio
Fly'o the ocean like an eagle
And when can chill in my gazebo, gazebo
Oh oh oh oh oh, na na na

Let me take you to Rio, Rio
Fly'o the ocean like an eagle
And when can chill in my gazebo, gazebo
Oh oh oh oh oh, na na na

See that you like it now
By the way you're dancing now
(Rio Rio oh oh, Rio Rio)
Go ahead and make it count
Move your body, make it count
(Rio Rio oh oh, Rio Rio)
You gotta light girl, turn it , here's mine, turn me on
(Rio Rio oh oh, Rio Rio)
You gotta wild side, let it out, ima make you bring it out
(Rio Rio oh oh, Rio na na na )

Shake it up fast, wind it up slow now
Just move your body girl
Work it to the floor
Let your body go now, now now, oh oh oh

Let me take you to Rio, Rio
Fly'o the ocean like an eagle
And when can chill in my gazebo, gazebo 
Oh oh oh oh, na na na

Let me take you to Rio, Rio
Fly'o the ocean like an eagle
And when can chill in my gazebo, gazebo 
Oh oh oh oh, na na na

Let me take you to Rio
Show you all around the Janeiro
Teach em up, now feel like a drummer
Go your light shine, girl you know you wanna
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da
Girl you know you wanna
Da-da-da-da-da, da oh oh na na na

Let me take you to Rio, Rio
Fly'o the ocean like an eagle
And when can chill in my gazebo, gazebo 
Oh oh oh oh, na na na

Let me take you to Rio, Rio
Fly'o the ocean like an eagle
And when can chill in my gazebo, gazebo
Oh oh oh oh oh, na na na

Get it one more time

Let me take you to Rio, Rio
Fly'o the ocean like an eagle
And when can chill in my gazebo, gazebo 
Oh oh oh oh, na na na

Let me take you to Rio, Rio
Fly'o the ocean like an eagle
And when can chill in my gazebo, gazebo
Oh oh oh oh oh, na na na
