Whip a Tesla, spinners lookin' kinda extra (extra)
Find me bumpin' up my fees, I'm sorry that I'm clever
Wear a cap and gown like how the hell this make me better?
Dodge my ex's texts (thot), now she sendin' letters
Hey Alexa, hey Alexa
How many bitches can we fit in the Tesla?
Told your bitch, "Nope," like I'm fuckin' Chuck Testa
Daughter gon' finesse so I'm namin' her Vanessa

I told that mom to call me never 'less we talkin' cheddar
I got my money up from where it was, my main endeavor (yup)
This money growin' faster than myself, it's hard to measure
I'm four-foot-two, my racks not pretty, girls, I love 'em never, whoa

Whip electric, pockets lookin' hectic
Butterfly doors when I let your bitch exit
Look majestic, move onto my next bitch
She look forty-two, man, I think I'm dyslexic

Whip a Tesla, spinners lookin' kinda extra (extra)
Find me bumpin' up my fees, I'm sorry that I'm clever
Wear a cap and gown like how the hell this make me better?
Dodge my ex's texts (thot), now she sendin' letters
Hey Alexa, hey Alexa
How many bitches can we fit in the Tesla?
Told your bitch, "Nope," like I'm fuckin' Chuck Testa
Daughter gon' finesse so I'm namin' her Vanessa

Pull up in that Model X with your model ex
Elon Musk how I flex, thotties in my Pokedex
Articuno on my neck, Pikachu on my Patek
Gravy gotta catch 'em all every time I get a check

Ditch school, drop cheddar
Get coupe, change weather
This lady gotta send my money, she should call me never
Brrt, brrt, brrt, please just call me never
Double bitch, double header, Prada runners with the leather

Switch lanes, get change, pull up with a thick chain
2018 world record for the dick game
Gravy Guinness, front flip the finish
That's how you doin' business when your side bitch a gymnast

Whip a Tesla (wait), spinners lookin' kinda extra (extra)
Find me bumpin' up my fees, I'm sorry that I'm clever
Wear a cap and gown like how the hell this make me better?
Dodge my ex's texts (thot), now she sendin' letters
Hey Alexa, hey Alexa
How many bitches can we fit in the Tesla?
Told your bitch, "Nope," like I'm fuckin' Chuck Testa
Daughter gon' finesse so I'm namin' her Vanessa
