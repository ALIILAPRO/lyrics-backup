		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know just what you do, you do to me 
Play my emotions like a pair of puppet strings
Did it ever occur to you my hearts more than a toy
Please go easy on my babe

Send message after message, forward my calls
Next day you hit me back like nothing happened at all
What about all the things you used to say to me
This ain't the way its supposed to be

And you know, I wouldn't do that to you
You know I wouldn't treat you that way
I've been running can't catch up
Oh love what I won't do

Oh you got me 
Chasing waterfalls
Oh you got me
Chasing waterfalls

All of the times I've been there, times I came though
I'd meet you anywhere if it brought me closer to you
Distance is killing me you make it so hard
Wont you let me love you babe

Used to be optimistic, these days I just don't know
Picket fence in the valley, a hope thats losing its hold
You know them other girls don't love you like I do
Cant afford to give up on you

And you know, I wouldn't do that to you
You know I wouldn't treat you that way no
I've been running can't catch up
Oh love what I won't do

Oh you got me 
Chasing waterfalls
Oh you got me
Chasing waterfalls

Oh oh oh you got me
Chasing waterfalls
Oh oh oh you got me
Chasing waterfalls Ohh

Oh you got me 
Chasing waterfalls
Oh you got me
Chasing waterfalls
