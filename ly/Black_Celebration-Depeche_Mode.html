		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's have a black celebration
Black celebration
Tonight

To celebrate the fact
That we've seen the back
Of another black day
Oh

I look to you
How you carry on
When all hope is gone
Can't you see?
Your optimistic eyes
Seem like paradise
To someone like me

I want to take you in my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today

Black celebration (sing out loud)
Black celebration
Tonight

To celebrate the fact
That we've seen the back
Of another black day
Oh

I look to you
And your strong belief
Me, I want relief
Tonight
Consolation
I want so much
Want to feel your touch
Tonight
Take me in your arms
Forgetting all you couldn't do today

Black celebration (sing out loud)
Black celebration
Tonight

I'll drink to that
Black celebration (over here)
Tonight

Black celebration
I'll drink to that
Tonight
Everybody
I'll drink to that
Tonight
