		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He looks as if he hasn't slept
His hair is purposely unkept
In many doorways, people wept
When you crafted your plan

Shadows underneath the eyes
And everywhere the bastard lies
My lack of proof is your disguise
You won't remember me
There's nothing really I can say
But "Sorry, mate" and walk away
I could be wrong on this, you play your game
This world is full of most unkind
And horrible is redefined
I can't imagine that you'd mind at all

You're lying again, your conscience isn't your friend
And the only thing you're sobbing at is your imagination
Lying again, your conscience isn't your friend
And the only thing you're sobbing at is your imagination
Is he really on the street?
Desperation or deceit?
And what he's wearing on his feet
Won't solve our mystery

And I am baffled by how you stand there, soaking it in
And do you hide your identity where you hide your grin?
You'd better hide your grin

Shadows underneath the eyes
And everywhere the bastard lies
My lack of proof is your disguise
You won't remember me

There's nothing really I can say
But "sorry, mate" and walk away
I could be wrong on this, you play your game
This world is full of most unkind
And horrible is redefined
I can't imagine that you'd mind at all

You're lying again, your conscience isn't your friend
And the only thing you're sobbing at is your imagination
Lying again, your conscience isn't your friend
And the only thing you're sobbing at is your imagination
