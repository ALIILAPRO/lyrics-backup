		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Brightest city buried in the dust
Lonely people stop and stare at us
Together you and me are getting lost
The sky falls

It's getting hard for me to see the truth
I lost my soul and gave myself to you
You are an angel and the devil too
A tear falls

All that I got left are my precious scars

I watch a teardrop falling from your eye
You are so perfect when you cry
In the corner all our endings lie
Alone now

All that I got left are my precious scars

It's me that you need now
It's me that you love now

All that I got left are my precious scars
(I wish I was immune then it wouldn't hurt)
