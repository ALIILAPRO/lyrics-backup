		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You and I, we were never friends in the first place
Never knew what to get you on your birthday
And all the best nights ended in the worst way, way, yeah
Apologize, if I always had to have the last word
Yeah, I was always bending over backwards
Just tryna crack your heart without a password, word

And looking back at the evidence
All we did was fight
And all we did was lie
So you and me

So thank God we never stayed together
Bought a house, had a kid, got a dog together
Thank God we never said, "Forever"
You and me, we were never meant to stay together
Thank God we never stayed together
Bought a house, had a kid, got a dog together
Thank God we never said, "Forever"
You and me, we were never meant to stay together, yeah

Mmm, I don't feel bad like I used to
Or drink every night like I used to
I'm pretty sure that I found a new you

And looking back at the evidence
All we did was fight
And all we did was lie
So you and me

So thank God we never stayed together
Bought a house, had a kid, got a dog together
Thank God we never said, "Forever"
You and me, we were never meant to stay together
Thank God we never stayed together
Bought a house, had a kid, got a dog together
Thank God we never said, "Forever"
You and me, we were never meant to stay together, yeah
