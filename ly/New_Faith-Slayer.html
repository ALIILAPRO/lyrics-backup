		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Holy man open up your eyes
To the ways of the world you've been so blind
As the walls of religion come crashing down
How's the ignorance taste the second time around 

Tell me how it feels knowing chaos will never end
Tell me what it's like when the celebration begins 

Welcome to the horror of the revelation
Tell me what you think of your savior now
I reject all the biblical views of the truth
Dismiss it as the folklore of the times
I won't be force fed prophecies
From a book of untruths for the weakest mind
Join the new faith for the celebration
Cult of new faith fuels the devastation 

Holy man come and worship me
I am all that you ever wanted to be
I'm the life of indulgence you never knew
The epitome of evil shining through 

Tell me how it feels knowing chaos will never end
Tell me what it's like when the celebration begins 

Welcome to the horror of the revelation
Tell me what you think of your savior now
I reject all the biblical views of the truth
Dismiss it as the folklore of the times
I won't be force fed prophecies
From a book of untruths for the weakest mind
I keep the bible in a pool of blood
So that none of its lies can affect me 

This is new faith
A different way of life
Witness the shame
See for yourself the lies
I'll take the fight
Bring it every time, any time
Refuse to let them win
My heresy begins 

Pray for life, wish for death
Pray for life, know in time you'll pray for death 

Tear it away
It lives inside your mind
Silence the fear
That keeps you pure inside
Now you can see
Life's atrocities endlessly
Witness the miracle
Witness the miracle 

Pray for life, wish for death
Pray for life, with every breath
You'll pray for death, you'll pray for death
Embrace new faith, embrace new faith
Yeah, new faith, yeah, new faith.
