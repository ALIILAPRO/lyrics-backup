		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm just a void in a flesh suit
Easy to bore, hard to please 
Emotions don't last a minute
I never cry, I just sneeze

But then this day on my bus route 
You sat just there, did I freeze ? 
It took me some time to compute 
I'd fallen down to my knees

I felt a heartquake 
You made my mind break 
I couldn't talk when i wanted to 
I saw your face and out of the blue
I felt a heartquake
You made my life shake
I realized that I always knew
cll of my songs were addressed to you 
I felt a heartquake 
More than I could take
But it's a nice ache 

You could be the one who's waiting for me 
I could see the clouds that started forming
You could be the come when it starts pouring
Be the pair of shoe that breaks my fall

Fue un placer conocerte
La religión que me convierte
Mi imaginación te creó a ti
Creo que ya tengo mi por fin

I felt a heartquake 
You made my mind break 
I couldn't talk when i wanted to 
I saw your face and out of the blue
I felt a heartquake
You made my life shake
I realized that I always knew
cll of my songs were addressed to you 
I felt a heartquake 
More than I could take
But it's a nice ache 

Lost in this new galaxy 
I don't know what's left of me 
cnd if I'll make it through 
But I want to live when I see you
(Cuando te veo a ti)

Lost in this new galaxy 
I don't know what's left of me 
cnd if I'll make it through 
But I want to live when I see you

I felt a heartquake 
You made my mind break 
I couldn't talk when i wanted to 
I saw your face and out of the blue
I felt a heartquake
You made my life shake
I realized that I always knew
cll of my songs were addressed to you 
I felt a heartquake 
More than I could take
But it's a nice ache
