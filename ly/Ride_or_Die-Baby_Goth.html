		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  See me looking back, oh you don't know how to act
Going through this bag, dancing, while it's raining stacks
Suicide doors on my whip, I got an MRI
And my diamonds dancing in the dark
You're my ride or die
I, ooh, I love, ooh, I love, ooh, I love
Ice blue and my bills are too

Giving your all to me, I want it all for me
Don't get close to me
When you live, both see, like Hennessy
Tell me why you want me, give you my whole body
I can open up for you, if you can open up to me
Stop your playing, b, like your designer things
We could be riding 'round town, in my new Bentley

See me looking back, oh you don't know how to act
Going through this bag, dancing, while it's raining stacks
Suicide doors on my whip, I got an MRI
And my diamonds dancing in the dark
You're my ride or die
I, ooh, I love, ooh, I love, ooh, I love
Ice blue and my bills are too

I am different, like I was dripping
I could walk into your life and you'll feel lifted
Turn the beat up, all the way up
And the way my body moving make your heart drop
I wanna feel you, show you something new
Text my best friend to go meet us in the bedroom

See me looking back, oh you don't know how to act
Going through this bag, dancing, while it's raining stacks
Suicide doors on my whip, I got an MRI
And my diamonds dancing in the dark
You're my ride or die
I, ooh, I love, ooh, I love, ooh, I love
Ice blue and my bills are too

Super soaker, drip all on me
Make you tense up when I whisper softly
Yeah you like it when I whisper softly
Fuck you with my ice, I'll leave you flossy
My tints are glossy, slipping off me
Diamonds are dripping, lick 'em off me

See me looking back, oh you don't know how to act
Going through this bag, dancing, while it's raining stacks
Suicide doors on my whip, I got an MRI
And my diamonds dancing in the dark
You're my ride or die
I, ooh, I love, ooh, I love, ooh, I love
Ice blue and my bills are too
