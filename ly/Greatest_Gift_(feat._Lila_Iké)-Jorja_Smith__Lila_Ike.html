		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're the greatest gift I found (I found)
My time with you is everything (everything)
All you do is make me proud (proud)
You've got a lot to unfold, but you never give in (never give in)

And surely this is love, you are worth it
I promise to make sure you'll never fall far from your grace
I hope that you know you are never too far from your purpose
I hope you receive it wherever you are, I'm so thankful I've got you

You got me, I'm still right
Here with the realest love
You got me, I'll still ride
Even in the, the wickedest times, yeah
Feel what you wanna feel right now
(I know how hard it feels)
You got me, I'm still right here

You're the sweetest thing I've known (I've known)
And I wish I could shield you from all of these lows in my life
But just look how far you've grown, oh no
These little wings will do more than just carry you home (carry you home) home

Surely this is love, you are worth it
I promise to make sure you'll never fall far from your grace
I hope that you know you are never too far from your purpose
I hope you receive it wherever you are, I'm so thankful I've got you

You got me, I'm still right
Here with the realest love
You got me, I'll still ride
Even in the, the wickedest times, yeah
Feel what you wanna feel right now
(I know how hard it feels)
You got me, I'm still right here

'Cause you're the greatest gift
Just know that where you are is where you're meant to be
So tap inna yourself and your identity
And tek your time
And I can tell you this
The roughest and the toughest, yeah, we've been through it
The struggles a nuh nothing, yeah, you built fi dis
Just tek your time

You got me, I'm still right
Here with the realest love
You got me, I'll still ride
Even in the, the wickedest times, yeah
Feel what you wanna feel right now
(I know how hard it feels)
You got me, I'm still right here
