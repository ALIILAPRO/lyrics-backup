		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give me something I like
Give me something so good
Raise my energy up
Make me feel like I should
Sweeter than candy cane
I want them candy stains
All over everything
That pussy's still salivating
I want that high
Baby, hop on my vibe
Singing, "Lalalala"
You want that "Lalala"
Baby, you just taste so right
You could make me spend the night
Singing, "Lalalala"
I'll sing, "Lalalala" on you
I want them sugar stains all over
Baby, your flower blooms in October
So Imma fall tonight and don't hesitate to come right on time
I love your waist, the way you taste, and I'll be for you any day
Pick up your phone I'm on my way to find you
And em' sugar stains
And those sugar stains
And those sugar stains, yeah
And those sugar stains, yeah
And those sugar stains
And those sugar stains
And those sugar stains, yeah
And those sugar stains, yeah yeah yeah
Got me licking your lips
In the midst of your hips
Put my lips on that flower
Let me give it a kiss
I want them sugar stains
Strawberry Lemonade
All over everything
That pussy's still salivating
I want that high
Baby, hop on my vibe
Singing, "Lalalala"
You want that "Lalala"
I got a sweet tooth tonight
Don't be scared I won't bite
Singing, "Lalalala"
I'll sing, "Lalalala" on you
I want them sugar stains all over
Baby, your flower blooms in October
So Imma fall tonight and don't hesitate to come right on time
I love your waist, the way you taste, and I'll be for you any day
Pick up your phone, I'm on my way to find you
And em' sugar stains
And those sugar stains
And those sugar stains, yeah
And those sugar stains, yeah
And those sugar stains
And those sugar stains
And those sugar stains, yeah
And those sugar stains, yeah yeah yeah
I'll take control of your body tonight
Don't uncover those waterproof eyes
And I want you to focus on your thighs
Baby, lose your mind
You're gonna be alright
If I let you in these thoughts of mine, yeah
I want them sugar stains all over
Baby, your flower blooms in October
So Imma fall tonight and don't hesitate to come right on time
I love your waist, the way you taste, and I'll be for you any day
Pick up your phone, I'm on my way to find you
And em' sugar stains, yeah
And those sugar stains
And those sugar stains, yeah
And those sugar stains, yeah
And those sugar stains
And those sugar stains
And those sugar stains, yeah
And those sugar stains, yeah yeah yeah
