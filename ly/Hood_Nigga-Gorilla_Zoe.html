		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the hoes jockin, beat steady knockin'
Middle of the stage got the whole club rockin'
Nigga you can hate but ya bitch steady watchin'
Bet she can do it on the dick she poppin'
We bottle poppin, you cock blockin'
Told ya girl you rap but your CD floppin'
Say you gettin money man we ain't seen nothin'
Ya girl is persistent, she ain't stoppin'

Man she say she want a (Hood nigga)
I keep the purp by the pound
The trap stay bunkin', y'all know we run the town (Hood nigga)
And I keep a bad bitch around
Thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white, red, brown (Hood nigga)
And my Chevy's sit on 24's
Flats look like flapjakes, pancakes, you ain't know (Hood nigga)
I'mma play the game how it go
They can take me out the hood
But I'mma keep it hood folk (Hood nigga)
And I dont need a scale for the work
I can eyeball purp, I am not you jerk
Hatin' on me will make your situation worse
You dont wanna take a ride in that long black hearse
All eyes on me, shawty I'm a bomb first
I'm the truth and they say the truth hurts
Hustle mean hard work, hard work
If you scared go to church
Man this rap shit is easy, every beat I get I murk

'Cause I'm a (Hood nigga)
I keep the purp by the pound
The trap stay bunkin', y'all know we run the town (Hood nigga)
And I keep a bad bitch around
Thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white, red, brown (Hood nigga)
And my Chevy's sit on 24's
Flats look like flapjakes, pancakes, you ain't know (Hood nigga)
I'mma play the game how it go
They can take me out the hood
But I'mma keep it hood folk (Hood nigga)

Get like you, naw, get like me
Evisu we don't rock white tees
Classic capris, but knicks on the feet
I count with Bathing Apes, 10 pair every week
Ménage à three, your girl suck me to sleep
Z-O-E climax to the peak
I see you, naw you see me
You'll see ICU fuckin' with me

'Cause I'm a (Hood nigga)
I keep the purp by the pound
The trap stay bunkin', y'all know we run the town (Hood nigga)
And I keep a bad bitch around
Thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white, red, brown (Hood nigga)
And my Chevy's sit on 24's
Flats look like flapjakes, pancakes, you ain't know (Hood nigga)
I'mma play the game how it go
They can take me out the hood
But I'mma keep it hood folk (Hood nigga)

Watchin' out for goldiggers like Kanye
But I will pay Beyonce
Or Ashanti
Make Kieshia Cole say she should've cheated if she eva come my way
Get some head from Fantasia on the highway
Trickin' off Magic City every Monday
It ain't trickin' if you got it dats what I say (You say?)
I say and what I say goes

'Cause I'm a (Hood nigga)
I keep the purp by the pound
The trap stay bunkin', y'all know we run the town (Hood nigga)
And I keep a bad bitch around
Thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white, red, brown (Hood nigga)
And my Chevy's sit on 24's
Flats look like flapjakes, pancakes, you ain't know (Hood nigga)
I'mma play the game how it go
They can take me out the hood
But I'mma keep it hood folk (Hood nigga)

All the hoes jockin', beat steady knockin'
Middle of the stage got the whole club rockin'
Nigga you can hate but ya bitch steady watchin'
Bet she can't do it on a dick, she poppin'
