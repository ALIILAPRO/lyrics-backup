		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I fall too often
And I love to complicate until there's nothing
My feet get cold
So no more talking
Let's just let it go the way that it's been going
You keep me close

I wanna feel like this forever
A little reckless, babe
But we can do whatever we like
Yeah, we could feel like this forever
I want you front and center
I could be your 9 to 5, ooh

Ooh, you're all I want
Give me all your love around the clock
AM, PM
Ooh, you're all I want
We're going and we're never gonna stop
AM, PM

AM, PM

No seconds wasted
And I feel the night fading
But I'm wide awake and I don't wanna go
So let's not waste this
Go ahead, take the shot, my lips will be a chaser
I ain't going home

I wanna feel like this forever
A little reckless, babe
But we can do whatever we like
Yeah, we could feel like this forever
I want you front and center
I could be your 9 to 5, ooh

Ooh, you're all I want
Give me all your love around the clock
AM, PM
Ooh, you're all I want
We're going and we're never gonna stop
AM, PM

AM, PM

I wanna feel like this forever
A little reckless, babe
But we can do whatever we like
Yeah, we could feel like this forever
I want you front and center
I could be your 9 to 5, ooh

Ooh, you're all I want
Give me all your love around the clock
AM, PM
Ooh, you're all I want
We're going and we're never gonna stop
AM, PM
AM, PM

AM, PM
