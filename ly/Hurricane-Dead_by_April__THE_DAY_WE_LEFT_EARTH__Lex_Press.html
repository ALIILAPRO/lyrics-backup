		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The sheep will follow the herd
And the blind leads the blind.

Dont act surpised when the wolf knocks on your door
I refuse to follow
You're pain
You're shallow

Just feed the addiction
Save us from ourselves
It's just another injection
Time is running out

Its gonna fall over you, like a hurricane
Incoming, brace for impact
Wave after wave, after wave, its taking over you
Welcome to our brave new world

You don't wanna live, but you don't wanna die, yeah
Chasing the next little dopamine high, yeah
The suits say serve and protect our home, to justify murdering people with drones
Let's go

It's gonna fall over you, like a fucking hurricane
Can you hear them, can you see them
Lining up for the slaughter

I know the mountain peaks
I know the valleys and creeks
But it's not home, anymore
And it breaks my soul

Lambs to the slaughter
Lining up to the altar
Theres blood in the water
Keep it up
Do you really think dopamine
Will help you find your amaranthine
It's all a smoke screen, get a fucking grip
Wake the fuck up

I want to feel again
Take me home
Take me home
