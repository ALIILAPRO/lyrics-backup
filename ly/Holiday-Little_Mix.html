		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Boy, have I told ya?
I swear you put the sun up in my sky
When it's cold, you pull me closer
So hot, it's like the middle of July (of July)

Wanna have a little taste, so let me lay you down (lay you down)
Nothing better than your skin on mine (skin on mine)
And I've been looking for the feeling, looking all my life
Boy, you give it to me every time

Can we make it all night? We don't stop
All up on my body, babe, oooh
Touch me like a summer night
You feel like a holiday, ooh
Up all night, we don't stop
Feel up on my body, babe
We're just dancing the night away
Boy, you feel like a holiday

So I'ma let go
No one else in the world
Could ever come close to you, baby (ah, ah, ah)
Close to you, baby (ah, ah, ah)
We're taking it slow
Whenever, wherever
We're lasting forever, my baby (ah, ah, ah)
You turn me on (ah, ah, ah)

Boy, have I told ya?
You give it to me like no other guy
We got that heat like the summer (Summer)
And that's why I'm so glad I made you mine

Wanna have a little taste, so let me lay you down (Lay you down)
Nothing better than your skin on mine (Skin on mine)
And I've been looking for the feeling, looking all my life
Boy, you give it to me every time

Can we make it all night? We don't stop
Feel up on my body, babe, ooh
Touch me like a summer night
You feel like a holiday, ooh (holiday, yeah)
Up all night, we don't stop
Feel up on my body, babe
We're just dancing the night away
Boy, you feel like a holiday

So I'ma let go
No one else in the world
Could ever come close to you, baby (ah, ah, ah) (close to you, baby)
Close to you, baby (ah, ah, ah) (Close to you, baby)
We're taking it slow
Whenever, wherever
We're lasting forever, my baby (ah, ah, ah)
You're turning me on (ah, ah, ah)

So put your love on me, up on me
Oh boy, I love it when you're touching me, holding me
No, ain't nobody put that thing on me, up on me
Like you do
Feel like a holiday (ah, ah, ah)
You know that I want it, babe (ah, ah, ah)

Can we make it all night? We don't stop
Feel up on my body babe, ooh
Touch me like a summer night
You feel like a holiday, ooh
Up all night, we don't stop
Feel up on my body, babe
We're just dancing the night away
Boy, you feel like a holiday

So I'ma let go
No one else in the world
Could ever come close to you, baby (ah, ah, ah)(close to you, baby)
Close to you, baby (ah, ah, ah)(close to you, baby)
We're taking it slow (slow)
Whenever, wherever
We're lasting forever, my baby (ah, ah, ah)
You're turning me on (ah, ah, ah)(turning me on, yeah)
