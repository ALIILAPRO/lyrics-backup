		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We go through the motions
We go way too deep sometimes
It's a river, it's an ocean
Always raging in my mind
We might just be broken
Hell yeah, we might just be fine
But I'd be yours for the taking
If you say you'll be mine

All this space between us
We never learned to fill
Ain't a song that they could sing us
There ain't a bridge we couldn't build

All these times between us
We stood tall and we stood still
There ain't a book that they could bring us
There ain't a heart we haven't spilled
Haven't spilled

We go through the motions
We go way too deep sometimes
It's a river, it's an ocean
Always raging in my mind
We might just be broken
Hell yeah, we might just be fine
But I'd be yours for the taking
If you say you'll be mine

We're the part you close your eyes for
We're the best there's ever been
You're the one I swore I'd die for
I'm the one who took your hand
I took your hand

We go through the motions
We go way too deep sometimes
It's a river, it's an ocean
Always raging in my mind
We might just be broken
Aw Hell, we might just be fine
But I'd be yours for the taking

I'd be yours for the taking
If you say you'll be mine
