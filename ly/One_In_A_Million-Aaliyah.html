		  Love it baby, love it baby, love it baby
Love it baby, love it baby, love it baby
Love it baby, love it baby, love it baby
Love it baby, love it baby, love it baby

Baby, you don't know what you do to me
Between me and you I feel a chemistry
I won't let no one
Come and take your place
'Cause the love you give, it can't be replaced

So, no one else love me like you do
That's why I don't mind to spend my life with you
I want to please you in any way I can
I want to share my world, don't you understand?

Your love is one in a million
It goes on and on and on
You give (you give) me a really good feeling
All day long

Your love (your love) is one in a million
It goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feeling
All day long

Turn me inside out, you make my heart speak
Need no one else, you're all I need
Personality ('ty) everything you do (do)
Makes me love everything 'bout you
Your smile, your style is so fly
I can't deny, I got a crush on you
And that is true indeed and I'm diggin' you
You make me believe that

Your love is one in a million (oh yeah)
It goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feeling (oh yeah)
All day long

Your love (your love) is one in a million (your love)
It goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feeling (oh yeah)
All day long

I'll give you, oh
Anything you want from me
Anything you want, anything you need
Anything your soul desires (ooh)

I'll give you, ohh
Anything you want from me
Anything you want, anything you need
Anything you still desire
Anything 'cause

Your love is one in a million (oh-oh-oh-oh)
It goes on and on and on (on and on)
You give me a really good feeling (you give me, baby)
All day long

Your love is one in a million (your love)
It goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feeling
All day long

Your love is one in a million
It goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feeling
All day long

Your love is one in a million
It goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feeling
All day long (baby)

Love it baby, love it baby, love it baby
Love it baby, love it baby, love it baby
Love it baby, love it baby, love it baby
Love it baby, love it baby, love it baby
Love it baby, love it baby, love it baby
Love it baby, love it baby, love it baby
Love it baby, love it baby, love it baby
Love it baby
