		  Yeah, uh

Yeah, uh
Hello, that is my bitch Shaniqua (hello)
I might dip like I'm John Cena
I got BB's on BB's on BB's (what's up?)
I got shit you can't see on TV (yeah)
I might pull up and rock out the show (uh-huh)
It's a Glock, lil' nigga, get low (that's right)
I got niggas and bitches on go (bitch)
Man, fuck your set
Fuck your clique (yeah)
Fuck your bitch (fuck)
Niggas always talking 'bout me
But won't show no face
I been creeping with this .38 (what's up?)
Rubbin' off the paint (go)
I'm a soldier, I got rank (yeah)
Smoking doja, this shit dank
I might push up in a tank

Don't you play with me, that chopper come with helicopters
Pour me the Actavis, that shit came from the doctor
I got Bottegas and this Helmut Lang, can't complain (hello)
And my bro got this new Raf and shit and he keep a flame
I got black bitches off the cocaine, white bitches off Kurt Cobain
Off the Novocain, I'm sparking shit, I'm so insane
I got North Face on my jacket, when I walk, you know I pack it
All this money, I'ma bag it, we got different tax brackets

Hello, that is my bitch Shaniqua (hello)
I might dip like I'm John Cena
I got BB's on BB's on BB's (what's up?)
I got shit you can't see on TV (yeah)
I might pull up and rock out the show (uh-huh)
It's a Glock, lil' nigga, get low (that's right)
I got niggas and bitches on go (bitch)
Man, fuck your set
Fuck your clique (yeah)
Fuck your bitch (fuck)
Niggas always talking 'bout me
But won't show no face
I been creeping with this .38 (what's up?)
Rubbin' off the paint (go)
I'm a soldier, I got rank (yeah)
Smoking doja, this shit dank
I might push up in a tank

Who that lil' nigga coming out the window?
AMG 63, all white Benzo
She don't want me, but I might fuck her friend though
I got clips, I got sticks and extendos (go)
What you mean? This a telescope, open up the door
Bro like, "Chill, let me fucking go"
Coming out the coupe, we them troops
All we do is point and they shoot at you
This a Glock and it's fucking stock
Aim it at your top (go)

Hello, that is my bitch Shaniqua (hello)
I might dip like I'm John Cena
I got BB's on BB's on BB's (what's up?)
I got shit you can't see on TV (yeah)
I might pull up and rock out the show (uh-huh)
It's a Glock, lil' nigga, get low (that's right)
I got niggas and bitches on go (bitch)
Man, fuck your set
Fuck your clique (yeah)
Fuck your bitch (fuck)
Niggas always talking 'bout me
But won't show no face
I been creeping with this .38 (what's up?)
Rubbin' off the paint (go)
I'm a soldier, I got rank (yeah)
Smoking doja, this shit dank
I might push up in a tank

Man, fuck your set, bitch
That's how you fucking do it, you can't fuck
All you niggas fucking garbage
Trash
Fuck you, bitch
Ah
(What the fuck? This nigga's crazy)
