		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pull up let it pop pop out the drop top 
Bitches moving slow 
Can't just hop out

Pull up got you sick 
Flexing on your bitch 
Eating out your chick 
Then I bust her clit
Busting at your lip 
Buzzin in your bitch 
Buzzin in your bitch

No love when they comin through 
I got problems they ain't pass and they never knew 
All this talk about the cash never living proof
I ain't speakin on my past or my daddy too

Fuck you know about the past 
Fuck you know about the past
Fuck you know about the past
Fuck you know about the past

Pull up with the cash on your bags 
Bitch I pull up and it's never that 
Pull up, fuck the commas do
Fuck around and let em through
Know these demons screaming suicide
We know you ain't leaving that alive 
MIA she don't ever stay 
Where he go, they don't ever play

Pull up let it pop pop out the drop top 
Bitches moving slow 
Can't just hop out
