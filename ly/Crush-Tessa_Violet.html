		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, alright
I can't focus on what needs to get done
I'm on notice hoping that you don't run, ah
You think I'm tepid but I'm misdiagnosed
'Cause I'm a stalker I seen all of your posts, ah-ah

And I'm just tryna play it cool now
But that's not what I wanna do now
And I'm not tryna be with you now, you now
Mhm

You make it difficult to not overthink
And when I'm with you I turn all shades of pink, ah
I wanna touch you but don't wanna be weird
It's such a rush, I'm thinking wish you were here, ah-ahh

And I'm just tryna play it cool now
But that's not what I wanna do now
And I'm not tryna be with you now, you now

But I could be your crush, like, throw you for a rush, like
Hoping you'd text me so I could tell you
I been thinking 'bout your touch like
Touch, touch, touch, touch, touch
I could be your crush, crush, crush, crush, crush
I got a fascination with your presentation
Making me feel like you're on my island
You're my permanent vacation
Touch, touch, touch, touch, touch
I could be your crush, crush, crush, crush, crush
Sorry

I fill my calendar with stuff I can do
Maybe if I'm busy it could keep me from you
And I'm pretending you ain't been on my mind
But I took an interest in the things that you like, ah-ahh

And I'm just tryna play it cool now
But that's not what I wanna do now
And I'm not tryna be with you now, you now

But I could be your crush, like, throw you for a rush, like
Hoping you'd text me so I could tell you
I been thinking 'bout your touch like
Touch, touch, touch, touch, touch
I could be your crush, crush, crush, crush, crush
I got a fascination with your presentation
Making me feel like you're on my island
You're my permanent vacation
Touch, touch, touch, touch, touch
I could be your crush, crush, crush, crush, crush

And yeah it's true that I'm a little bit intense, right
But can you blame me when you keep me on the fence, like
And I've been waiting, hoping that you'd wanna text, like
Text like
It's what I was born to do
And yeah it's true that I'm a little bit intense, right
But can you blame me when you keep me on the fence, like
And I've been waiting, hoping that you'd wanna text, like
Text like
Ugh

And I'm just tryna play it cool now
But that's not what I wanna do now
And I'm not tryna be with you now, you now

But I could be your crush, like, throw you for a rush, like
Hoping you'd text me so I could tell you
I been thinking 'bout your touch like
Touch, touch, touch, touch, touch
I could be your crush, crush, crush, crush, crush
I got a fascination with your presentation
Making me feel like you're on my island
You're my permanent vacation
Touch, touch, touch, touch, touch
I could be your crush, crush, crush, crush, crush
Sorry
