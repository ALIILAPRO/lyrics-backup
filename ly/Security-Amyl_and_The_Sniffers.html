		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Security, will you let me in your pub?
I'm not looking for trouble, I'm looking for love
I'm not looking for harm, I'm looking for love
Will you let me in your hard heart, let me in your pub?

I distracted you with all of my bullshit
I covered myself in distractions
Colors and patterns, you couldn't see the real me
I wanna deceive you, you're stupid I'm fast

Security, will you let me in your pub?
I'm not looking for trouble, I'm looking for love
I'm not looking for harm, I'm looking for love
Will you let me in your hard heart, let me in your pub?

Security, will you let me in your pub?
I'm not looking for trouble, I'm looking for love
I'm not looking for harm, I'm looking for love
Will you let me in your hard heart, let me in your pub?
You looked at normies different to me
You looked at them with trust
I looked at normies different to you
'Cause you looked at them with lust
I see them lurking from all of the angles
The egos say they can prey
You liked the colors and the patterns I'm wearing
Poison you like the exotic snake

Not looking for trouble
I'm looking for love, I'm looking for love
Will you let me in your hard heart?
Let me in your hard heart, let me in your pub
Not looking for trouble
I'm looking for love, I'm looking for love
Will you let me in your hard heart?
I swear I'm not that drunk

Security, will you let me in your pub?
I'm not looking for trouble, I'm looking for love
I'm not looking for harm, I'm looking for love
Will you let me in your hard heart, let me in your pub?
Security, will you let me in your pub?
I'm not looking for trouble, I'm looking for love
I'm not looking for harm, I'm looking for love
Will you let me in your hard heart? I'm not that drunk

I'm not looking for trouble
I'm looking for love, I'm looking for love
Will you let me in your hard heart?
Let me in your hard heart, let me in your pub
Not looking for trouble
I'm looking for love, I'm looking for love
Will you let me in your hard heart?
Let me in your hard heart, let me in your pub
I'm not that drunk
Let me into your pub
I'm not that drunk
Will you let me into your pub?

I swear I'm not that drunk
Not that drunk
Let me into your pub
Into your pub
Drunk
(I'm not that drunk)
(Let me into your pub)
Not that drunk
Just looking for love
