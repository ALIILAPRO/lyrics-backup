		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo, you started? Alright
How the pain go, woah-woah-woah
How the pain go, woah-woah-woah
How the pain go, woah-woah-woah
(Great John on the beat, by the way) 
Look

Make the money, never let the money make you, huh
Real nigga never fake you
Cut the grass, know you gotta stay snake-proof
All these drugs got me feelin' unstable, uh
How the pain go, woah-woah-woah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
How the pain go, woah-woah-woah (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I be feelin' lonely in a crowd
If I hold you up, you better hold that shit down
Sometimes I cry, no one's around
But laugh and joke when guns around
I know I be flexin' like I never had none, huh
But nigga, we ain't never had none
I ran me up a pack, used to shop at PacSun
Now we make it rain, we don't ever see the sun
I had to leave her, I know she probably the one
But this thot, I'm treatin' her like she nothin'
And I don't do the fake, you a bait
They gon' call you everythin' but great
Ocean on my neck and on my wrist, I got a lake
Brand new AP, I just took it to switch the face
Two gun charges, I'm just prayin' I beat the case
I paid my lawyer, I'm just waitin' on court dates, huh

Make the money, never let the money make you, huh
Real nigga never fake you
Cut the grass, know you gotta stay snake-proof
All these drugs got me feelin' unstable, uh
How the pain go, woah-woah-woah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
How the pain go, woah-woah-woah (yeah, yeah, yeah) 

Look, huh
In the deep end with the sharks
Ask me how I'm feelin', you don't wanna get me started
Nowadays I'm chillin', you don't wanna see me spark it
Came a long way from abandoned apartments
Now I'm in the Wraith, baby you can see the stars
This for all the times they threw me off, I'm on
No more lookin' bummy, Mike Amiri where I'm goin'
Tell your nigga get some money, you know we could put him on, huh
Yeah, say you love me, better make that shit clear
If it's up, then it's stuck, we gon' leave it in the air
Ran it up, got some bucks, I'm still here
If it's up, then it's stuck, we gon' leave it in the air
How you livin'? (Huh) money gettin' (huh)
Diamonds hittin', when you talkin' they gon' listen, uh
How you livin'? Money gettin'
Diamonds hittin', when you talkin' they gon' listen

Make the money, never let the money make you, huh
Real nigga never fake you
Cut the grass, know you gotta stay snake-proof
All these drugs got me feelin' unstable, uh
How the pain go, woah-woah-woah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
How the pain go, woah-woah-woah (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Make the money, never let the money make you, huh
Real nigga never fake you
Cut the grass, know you gotta stay snake-proof
All these drugs got me feelin' unstable, uh
How the pain go, woah-woah-woah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
How the pain go, woah-woah-woah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
