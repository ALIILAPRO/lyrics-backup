		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am Belle
Can't you tell?
You will meet my haunted friends
Or you will go to hell

Hi, my name is Annabelle
And welcome to my tea party
Boo!
Cookie?
Oh my God!

Summon the dead, spread the demons
Summon the dead, spread the demons
Summon the dead, spread the demons
Summon the dead, spread the demons

Hey, Annabelle?
Yes?
Why is my tea floating?
Whose balloon is this?
It's mine
Oh, Kenny, can you pass on the ouija board for me?
You sure?

I am Belle
Can't you tell
You will meet my haunted friends
Or you will go to hell

Oh, by the way, have you met Chuckie yet?
Yo, what's up, bro?

They call me Chuckie, chucking people's hats
Fear and relentless, the gift that I possess
The freak show I caused with my heavy wooden axe
This doll will go mental, with my psycho flex
Oh my God!

Summon the dead, spread the demons
Summon the dead, spread the demons
Summon the dead, spread the demons
Summon the dead, spread the demons
