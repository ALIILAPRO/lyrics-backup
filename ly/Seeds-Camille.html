		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Seeds of love to seeds of lettuce, seed of rust can even flower, seeds of rain 
Seeds of passion, seeds of suffering, seeds of strawberry fields forever, seeds of graves 
Seeds of peaches, seed of beacons, seeds of peace, and seeds of hope
Seeds of paste, pine, pepper, seeds of glory, seeds of gold 

How can you serve them? 
How can you spoil them? 
How can you trade them?
How can you grow, grow?

Seeds of sorrow, seeds of sterile landscapes, seeds of devastated crows, seeds of strain
Seeds of misery, seeds of mud and then color, seeds of of wooden hell and seeds of waste
Seeds of silence, seeds of slum and seeds of hunger, seeds of stone 
Seeds above and beneath the summer light and a million seeds of cold 

How can you buy them? 
How can you serve them? 
How can you trade them? 
How can you do so, ooh? 

How can you buy them 
How can you serve them 
How can you trade
How can you do so, oh?

(How can you can you buy them?) Seeds of love or seeds of happy, seeds of blue eyes, belly-button, seeds of mine (how can you can you serve them?) 
(How can you trade?) seeds of children, seeds of rosebud, only seeds of what is going to happen, seeds of change (how can you do so?)
Seeds of change 
Seeds of change
