		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go ahead, you can say it's my fault
If it still hurts at all
I thought one of these days you might call
When you were feeling small

Drowning in my thoughts
Staring at the clock
And I know I'm not on your mind

I wonder what would happen if I die
I hope all of my friends get drunk and high
Would it be too hard to say goodbye?
I hope that it's enough to make you cry
Maybe that day you won't hate me

Go ahead, you can say that I've changed
Just say it to my face
One drink and I'm back to that place
The memories won't fade

Drowning in my thoughts
Staring at the clock
And I know I'm not on your mind

I wonder what would happen if I die
I hope all of my friends get drunk and high
Would it be too hard to say goodbye?
I hope that it's enough to make you cry
Maybe that day you won't hate me

Wonder what would happen if I die
I hope all of my friends get drunk and high
Would it be too hard to say goodbye?
I hope that it's enough to make you cry
And maybe that day you won't hate me
