		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why do you lie to me?
Why would you lie to me?
Why do you lie to me, shawty?

I'm in love with your hands tonight
Ever give you this alibi
I don't know 'cause I'm lost in your eyes
I hope my heart don't break too much
When I wake from the ways you touch
I'm so weak 'cause I can't get enough

You say that you love me
Oh, I never thought we'd be like that
I've been running in a thousand tracks
You said that you love me

So, why do you lie to me?
Why do you lie to me?
Why do you lie to me?
Why do you lie to me?
Why do you lie to me?
Why do you lie to me?
Why do you lie to me?
Why do you lie to me? (You say that you love me)
Oh-oh, ooh, ooh
Oh-oh, ooh, ooh
Oh-oh, ooh, ooh (you say that you love me)
Oh-oh, ooh, ooh
Why do you lie to me?

You said it was L-O-V-E
Now we don't even speak
I know you didn't need me
What is all this about?
I didn't come for no clout
I get mines and I'm out
I'll survive any drought
Feelings are not allowed
I go all the way down, yeah
We could go somewhere where we don't get service
We can sit back and smoke weed all day shirtless
I keep on going in and out of your cervix
That would be perfect but I don't think you're worth it

You say that you love me
Oh, I never thought we'd be like that
I've been running in a thousand tracks
You say that you love me

So, why do you lie to me?
Why do you lie to me?
Why do you lie to me?
Why do you lie to me?
Why do you lie to me?
Why do you lie to me?
Why do you lie to me?
Why do you lie to me?
Why do you lie to me? (You say that you love me)
Oh-oh, ooh, ooh (oh, I never thought we'd be like that)
Oh-oh, ooh, ooh (I've been running in a thousand tracks)
Oh-oh, ooh, ooh (you say that you love me)
Oh-oh, ooh, ooh
Why do you lie to me?
