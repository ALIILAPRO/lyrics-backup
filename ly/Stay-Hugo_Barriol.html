		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you hold me and take me back home
It's getting late, I'm getting cold
I didn't see the tides come in
Don't wake me up if I dream
Feeling high with what we had
Feeling down when it's gone
And I remember what you said
You'd never go away
We'd always be the same
How our love would never change
How you'd always stay
How you'd always stay
Stay
Can you hold me and take me back home
It's getting late, I'm getting old
I didn't see the time's running
Turn off the lights if you leave
Feeling high with what we had
Feeling down when it's gone
And I remember what you said
You'd never go away
We'd always be the same
How our love would never change
How you'd always stay
How you'd always stay
Stay
You'd never go away
We'd always be the same
How our love would never change
How you'd always stay
How you'd always stay
Stay
