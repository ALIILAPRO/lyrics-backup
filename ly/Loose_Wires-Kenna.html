		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's written on your face now
You wanna be my muse
No resume necessary
You're too too too adorable not to be like all the others

Loose wires! We have a connection unlike anyone
Loose wires! Positive and negative's been undone
Run for cover! Put your hand on my hand, we'll have some fun
Loose wires! Put your hand on my hand, we'll have some fun

Isn't it electric in here?
I wanna know what it's about
Isn't it amazing in here?
I wanna know what you're about

Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a minute

All the hits that I've been missing
Been around the world once before
Upside down, rightside up, looking for that one
Riding around with glossed-over eyes, a fix

Loose wires! We have a connection unlike anyone
Loose wires! Positive and negative's been undone
Loose wires! Put your hand on my hand, we'll have some fun
Loose wires! Put your hand on my hand, we'll have some fun
Run for cover!

Isn't it electric in here?
I wanna know what it's about
Isn't it amazing in here?
I wanna know what you're about

Can't you see the episode
When renegades, with dirty ways
Dancing to the break of day
It's tension in here
Can't you see the laser pass
Right through your glass
Don't have to ask
It's green as grass
And being passed
It's so thick in here, in here
What's going in here, in here
Listen to me

Loose wires! We have a connection unlike anyone
Loose wires! Positive and negative's been undone
Loose wires! Put your hand on my hand, we'll have some fun
Loose wires! Put your hand on my hand, we'll have some fun
Run for cover!

Isn't it electric in here?
I wanna know what it's about
Isn't it amazing in here?
I wanna know what you're about
Isn't it amazing?
Isn't it amazing?
