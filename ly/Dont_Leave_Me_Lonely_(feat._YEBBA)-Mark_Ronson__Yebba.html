		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me baby what's on your heart?
'Cause I've been wandering around in your dark, yeah
('Cause I've been, 'cause I've been)
I've got way too many questions, always learning lessons
Loving too hard (loving too hard)
Give me just a second to breathe
'Cause you've been turning all the tables on me, yeah
('Cause I've been, 'cause I've been)
Whenever you would get up in your feelings, I would always listen
Now you turn around and leave (turn around and leave, turn around and leave)

Oh if we fall apart
Let's do it in the dark
Hit me in the heart this time

Don't you leave me lonely tonight
'Cause I won't forgive you (won't forgive you)
Don't you leave me lonely tonight
'Cause I can't forget you (can't forget you)
I toss and turn alone in my bed
When you should be laying here beside me instead
Oh, don't you leave me lonely tonight
'Cause I won't forgive you, forgive you, forgive you this time

Tell me if this love is a lie
'Cause the ticking time is passing me by, babe
('Cause I've been, 'cause I've been)
I'm waiting but the second hand is turnin'
Burnin' all the circles in my mind (mind, mind) yeah
Anticipating 'cause you know I'm never satisfied
And I don't wanna hear the reasons why, why, why we fight, yeah

Oh if we fall apart
Let's do it in the dark
Hit me in the heart this time

Don't you leave me lonely tonight
'Cause I won't forgive you (won't forgive you)
Don't you leave me lonely tonight
'Cause I can't forget you (can't forget you)
I toss and turn alone in my bed
When you should be laying here beside me instead
Oh, don't you leave me lonely tonight
'Cause I won't forgive you, forgive you, forgive you this time

Don't you leave me lonely tonight
'Cause I won't forgive you, oh
Don't you leave me lonely tonight
'Cause I won't forget you, oh
I toss and turn alone in my bed
When you should be laying here beside me instead
Oh, don't you leave me lonely
'Cause I won't forgive you, forgive you, forgive you this time
