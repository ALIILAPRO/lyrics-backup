		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How can I explain when there are few words I can choose
How can I explain when words get broken

Do you remember there was a time, ahaha
When people on the street
We're walking hand in hand in hand
They used to talk about the weather
Making plans together
Days would last forever

Come to me, cover me, hold me
Together we'll break these chains of love
Don't give up, don't give up
Together with me and my baby
Break the chains of love

Do you remember once upon a time, ahaha
When there were open doors
An invitation to the world
We were falling in and out with lovers
Looking out for others
Our sisters and our brothers

Come to me, cover me, hold me
Together we'll break these chains of love
Don't give up, don't give up now
Together with me and my baby
Break the chains of love
Together we'll break these chains of love

How can I explain when there are few words I can choose
How can I explain when words get broken

They used to talk about the weather
Making plans together
Days would last forever

Come to me, cover me, hold me
Together we'll break these chains of love
Don't give up, don't give up now
Together with me and my baby
Break the chains of love
Together we'll break these chains of love
Don't give up, don't give up now
Together with me and my baby
Break the chains of love
Together we'll break these chains of love
Don't give up, don't give up now
Together with me and my baby
Break the chains of love
