		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heck yeah, I breathe you
Darling, I see you
I hope you see me, too
I want to know you
Here ain't no rocky ground
Yeah, I put one million down
When you walk, I kiss the ground
Hey, hey, I love you

So what we gotta lose? What we gotta move?
I move mountains (sing)
I can see it through
I can do it, too
Like a prophet (sing, sing)
What we gotta lose? What we gotta move?
I move mountains
I'd do anything for you
Anything to move
Move mountains
Sing it!

Mountains, mountains
Mountains, mountains
Mountains, mountains
Mountains, mountains

Lord, I am so blessed
'Cause you come with interest
Fill up my pockets
I want to own you

So what we gotta lose? What we gotta move?
I move mountains (sing)
I can see it through
I can do it too
Like a prophet (sing, sing)
What we gotta lose? What we gotta move?
I move mountains (sing)
I'd do anything for you
Anything to move
Move mountains
Sing it!

Mountains, mountains
Mountains, mountains
Mountains, mountains
Mountains, mountains
