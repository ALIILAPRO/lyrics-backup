		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I, I am desperation
Made it do a better day
I, I am isolation's delicate disarray
Take this, thought I had more
Crawling out of my skin
Sickness, scarring return
Burning me again

Too far gone
Am I too far gone?
Am I too far gone to save?
Help me make it through the day, oh

I, I am tribulation
Naked down to the bone
I, I am agitation
Never leaves me alone
Keep on pushing along
Don't wanna feel this
Sinking, it's time to believe
That I don't need this

Too far gone
Am I too far gone?
Am I too far gone to save?
Help me make it through the day, oh

All away, I am desperation
All away, I am isolation
All away, I am agitation
All away

Too far gone
Never too far gone
I'm never too far gone to save
I can make it through the day
Make it through the day
Just for today
