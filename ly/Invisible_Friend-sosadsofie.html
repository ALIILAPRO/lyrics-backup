		  Invisible Friend 

My friend, 
please read me a story,
so that I can sleep without any worries

My dear, 
sing me a lullaby 
With beautiful words that stop my cry 

My mate, 
stroke my tired head,
so that I smile and don’t need to be so sad

My dear, 
won’t you stay in my room tonight?
We could build tents and nests and caves for us to hide 

Mom and Dad were fighting and I was hiding 
Mom and Dad were fighting and I was hiding under my bed 
Mom and Dad were fighting and I was hiding 
under my bed pretending to be dead 
Mom and Dad were fighting and I am hiding under my bed pretending to be dead
Mom and Dad are fighting and I keep on hiding under my bed wishing to be dead 

My dear, I wished you were real
