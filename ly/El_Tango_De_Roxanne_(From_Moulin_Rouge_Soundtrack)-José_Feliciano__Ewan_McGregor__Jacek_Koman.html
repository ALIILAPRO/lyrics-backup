		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Will drive you
Mad

Roxanne
You don't have to put on that red light
Walk the streets for money
You don't care if it's wrong or if it is right

Roxanne
You don't have to wear that dress tonight
Roxanne
You don't have to sell your body to the night

His eyes upon your face
His hand upon your hand
His lips caress your skin
It's more than I can stand

(Roxanne) Why does my heart cry?
(Roxanne) Feelings I can't fight
You're free to leave me, but just don't deceive me
And please, believe me when I say I love you

Yo que te quiero tanto, qué voy ha hacer
Me dejaste, me dejaste en un tango
En el alma se me fue
Se me fue el corazon
Ya no tengo ganas de vivir
Porque no te puedo convencer
Que no te vendas Roxanne

Roxanne (Why does my heart cry?)
You don't have to put on that red light
Feelings I can't fight (You don't have to wear that dress tonight)

(Roxanne)
You don't have to put on that red light
Roxanne
You don't have to wear that dress tonight
Roxanne

Roxanne
