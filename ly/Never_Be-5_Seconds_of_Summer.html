		  (Ohohohohohoh ohohoh ohohohohohoh)
(Ohohohohohoh ohohoh ohohohohohoh)

I need your love to light up this house
I wanna know what you're all about
I wanna feel you feel you tonight
I wanna tell you that it's alright

I need your love to guide me back home
When I'm with you I'm never alone
I need to feel you feel you tonight
I need to tell you that it's alright

We'll never be as young as we are now
It's time to leave this old black and white town
Let's seize the day, let's run away
Don't let the colors fade to gray

We'll never be as young as we are now
As young as we are now

(Ohohohohohoh ohohoh ohohohohohoh)

I've seen myself here in your eyes
I stay awake 'til the sunrise
I wanna hold you hold you all night
I wanna tell you that you're all mine

I felt our hands intertwine
I hear our hearts beating in time
I need to hold you hold you all night
I need to tell you that you're all mine

We'll never be as young as we are now
It's time to leave this old black and white town
Let's seize the day, let's run away
Don't let the colors fade to gray

We'll never be as young as we are now
As young as we are now

We won't wait for tomorrow
It's too late we don't follow
We won't wait for tomorrow
It's too late we don't follow

We'll never be as young as we are now
It's time to leave this old black and white town
Let's seize the day, let's run away
Don't let the colors fade to gray

We'll never be as young as we are now
As young as we are now

(Ohohohohohoh ohohoh ohohohohohoh)
(Ohohohohohoh ohohoh ohohohohohoh)

As young as we are now
