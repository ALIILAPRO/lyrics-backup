		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hide your heart from sight,
Lock your dreams at night,
It could happen to you.
Don't count stars
Or you might stumble,
Someone drops a sigh
And down you tumble,
Keep an eye on spring,
Run when church bells ring.
It could happen to you 
All I did was wonder 
How your arms would be
And it happened to me
