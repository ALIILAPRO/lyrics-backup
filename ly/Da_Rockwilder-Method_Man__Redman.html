		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, my God
Oh, my God
(Ow) boo
Uh, uh, yo, uh

Microphone checka, swingin' sword lecture
Closin' down the sector, supreme neck protector
Better warn 'em kid, Mr. Meth's a boiling pot
'Bout to blow his lid from the pressure, too hot for TV
Fo' sheezy, too many wanna be hard, be easy
It's all in together, going all out together
It don't take much to please me
Still homes, I'm never satisfied like the Stones
We don't condone bitin', see them skull and crossbones
Protecting what I'm writing
Don't clash with the Titan who blast with a license
To kill rap recitings
Come on, in the zone with ya nigga from the group home
Tical (fuck your lifestyle)
Put your lights out
Get the shit to crackin', got you fiendin' with your pipes out
Time for some action, surfin' the avenue
Mad at you, where I used to battle crews
Back when Antoinette had that attitude
Cover me I'm going in, walls closing in
Got us bustin' off these pistols
My niggas got issues, again (woo), same song
Armed with the mega bomb
Blow you out the frame, then I'm gone

Yo, I was going too but we roam, cellular phones
Doc, Meth back in the flesh, blood and bones
Don't condone (uh), spent bank loans on homegrown
Suckers break like Turbo and Ozone
When I grab the broom
Moon-walk platoon hawk, my goons bark
Leave you in a blue lagoon lost (true)
Three nines and a glove with Masu, D-Don and The Gov'
Right behind on a bus
Haters don't touch (what?)
Weigh us both up
Now my neighbor doped up
Got the cable hooked up, all channels
Lift my shirt all, mammal
You ship off keys and we ship Grand Pianos

Sawed off shotgun (yeah)
Hand on the pump, sippin' on a forty
Yo, smokin' on a blunt
Bust my gun off
Red and Meth didn't jump
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Yeah, come on, Red and Meth didn't jump
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
