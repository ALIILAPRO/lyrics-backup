		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jesus, he had a plan for both of us
Don't matter, I can't read
when I'm with you
Set fire to my bibles long ago
I watched as embers rose
from orange to blue
Met me through the
Silver screens
We were only in our teens
Loose black skinny jeans
baby
So tell me how you like it
Lemme see just what you got
It turns me on just thinkin' 'bout it
I'm not fakin' when I'm on it
I can't keep
My hands off
You can't keep
your pants on
And to my patron Saint I
Kneel and pray you stay
That night I swore
I'd never leave you to this day
I dream in silicone
Stay in between your home
Pull me in
Take me in stride
Feel me inside
Feel the wind
Chill down our spines
Tell me you're mine
Run your fingers
Through my hair
Make it hurt
I don't care
I'm on fire for you baby
So tell me how you want it
Cause no matter what I got it
Make me lose my breath for it
I'mma keep it wet for it
I can't keep my hands off
You can't keep your pants on
I'm so blind for you
I'll ride wild for you
Slide inside
Make me cry
Babe, I'd die for you
On my knees when you please
You're my mean butch king
You can't hide from my sighs
I know what you're thinking
Met me through the
Silver screens
We were only in our teens
Loose black skinny jeans
Run your fingers
Through my hair
Make it hurt
I don't care
I'm on fire for you baby
So tell me how you like it
Lemme see just what you got
It turns me on just thinkin' 'bout it
I'm not fakin' when I'm on it
I can't keep
My hands off
You can't keep
your pants on
And to my patron Saint I
Kneel and pray you stay
That night I swore
I'd never leave you to this day
I dream in silicone
Stay in between your home
Stay with me
Pray with me
Hold me down
You can play with me
Love me hard
For eternity
Toss your pills
'Cause I'm all you need
Pull me in
Take me in stride
Feel me inside
Feel the wind
Chill down our spines
Tell me you're mine
So tell me how you like it
Lemme see just what you got
It turns me on just thinkin' 'bout it
I'm not fakin' when I'm on it
I can't keep
My hands off
You can't keep
your pants on
And to my patron Saint I
kneel and pray you stay
That night I swore
I'd never leave you to this day
I dream in silicone
Stay in between your home
