		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're sitting in my mind and trying to forget what i left behind for anyone to find

They grip my pen and force what i cannot hide anymore
Im so scared of whats becoming of me
These fuckers keep surpressing me

Get the fuck out

The key of my agony keeps finding me in the dark depths of my sick, strange sanity

I'm being pushed six feet deep and I'm about to break
Everything you see from me is being taken away from me

(Hook)
You want us to regret it
Regret everything that we ever did
You want us to forget it
Forget everything that i will ever spit
You want me to keep facing the bone pit
While I am still struggling with all of this
You want us to regret it
I regret that i ever lived
You want us to forget it

---
Everything around is falling appart
I'm giving negative fucks I've been dead for so long
I hear the voices screaming out loud
I see these faces haunting my soul.
there are no regrets to be found
they've been dead for so long
Everytime is like I'm fading and try not to forget the pain I'm feeling from the get go
lets go!
Everything's about to break I think I'll never be the same again (but) I won't forget your face though
You want us to forget it, I won't forget you
everything around is falling appart
Everything i know is being taken away from me
---

(Hook 2)

Forget it
Forget it bitch

We are still swallowing the pain you've knit for me
The knife you stuffed down my throat gets deeper every time you laugh at me

I regret it
I regret it
Please make me stop writing the dead man's diary

I'm writing the dead man's diary

Continue to laugh at me until you take my motherfucking life
