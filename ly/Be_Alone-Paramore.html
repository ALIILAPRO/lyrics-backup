		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So what if I don't have a lot to talk about?
I shove my mouth and keep it locked until it comes
And what if I don't ever want to leave my house?
Stay on the couch while all my friends are going out

Alone
You should be alone
Yeah, you should be alone
You should be alone with me
We could be alone
Yeah, we could be alone
But never get too low on me

I make the journey down the hall back to my room
And kill more time, and let it rot inside its tomb (inside its tomb)
See I ain't want to climb some social ladder too
Some Shanghai-La's that all the cool kids will abuse

Alone
You should be alone
Yeah, you should be alone
You should be alone with me
We could be alone
Yeah, we could be alone
But never get too low on me

We could be alone together

Oh oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm loner, now I'm in love with you alone
Oh oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Come be a loner, be in love with me alone

Oh oh oh oh oh

You should be alone
Yeah, you should be alone
You should be alone with me
We could be alone
Yeah, we could be alone
But never get too low on me

You should be alone
Yeah, you should be alone
You should be alone with me
We could be alone
Yeah, we could be alone
But never get too low on me
