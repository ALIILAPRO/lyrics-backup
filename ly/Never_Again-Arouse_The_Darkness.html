		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sitting in the dark, staring at the sky
With hate in my heart
With hate in my heart
Waiting for a miracle to save our world
Speaking to your souls
Speaking to your souls

Enough! these lies
This is the end
And never again

In dead silence
Waiting for answers that will never come
In the darkness
Cursing the day everything was wasted

Drowning in nightmares between dying dreams
Looking for redemption
Looking for redemption
This war will never end, only ruins will remain
Of our existence
Of our existence

Enough! these lies
This is the end
And never again

In dead silence
Waiting for answers that will never come
In the darkness
Cursing the day everything was wasted

Lost in dreams standing on the edge
Only death will set me free
