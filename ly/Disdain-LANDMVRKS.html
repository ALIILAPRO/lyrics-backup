		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where are we supposed to go?
In a place of lies haunted by your shadow?
Everyone's trying to get out somehow
Finding blindly their path until now
And I'm asking "why?"
My heart stopped beating somehow
As if the world is going blind, bringing us down

You cannot hide the truth I know you
Will you be somewhere I can find you

And I don't know what it'll takes to bring it back
Is this what I want, is it something I'll regret
Everyone I've loved caused every pain I've known
I'll do this on my own

Look at the mirror, tell me what you see
Trying to hold this pain
You've broken my heart and now you watch it bleed
Your lips curled in disdain

This is not a curse, will you wait alone in your bed?
When everything turns to dust
You're faking your sayings, I'm watching your failures
You're giving me nothing, you've buried your feels
It goes deeper and deeper
Into the darkness of your fucking world

And it's hard to tell
You're still breathing but it's like you're dead
Will you realize that you are the ghost you're afraid of
And it's hard to tell
You're still breathing but it's like you're dead

You cannot hide the truth I know you
Will you be somewhere I can find you

No I don't feel nothing
DON'T SCORN ME
Cause you're lying to me
DON'T SCORN ME
Now you're dead to me
I don't feel nothing cause you're fucking dead to me

Look at the mirror, tell me what you see
Trying to hold this pain
You've broken my heart and now you watch it bleed
Your lips curled in disdain
