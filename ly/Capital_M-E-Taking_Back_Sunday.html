		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The nicest man I ever met
Was more malicious than malcontent
Yeah, he taught me how to hold my tongue
And wait to strike till their backs were turned
And you slither away like the snake that you are
Yeah, you slither away like the snake that you are

All I ever did was look up to you
And if all I ever did was let, let you down
Ain't nothing stopping me now

Divinities fell correctly beneath
The receding pride of his twenties
Was capital M-E
(I couldn't self describe)
Was capital M-E
(But you can't say I didn't try)

So you say what you want
(Maybe I didn't get my way)
So you say what you want
(Maybe I didn't get my way)
I got, I got away

All I ever did was look up to you
And if all I ever did was let, let you down
Ain't nothing stopping me now

Was it everything you hoped for?
Was it all that and more?
Too much, too soon
Or too good to be true
Was it everything you hoped for?
Was it all that and more?

All I ever did was look up to you
And if all I ever did was let, let you down
Ain't nothing stopping me now
All I ever did was look up to you
And if all I ever did was let, let you down
Ain't nothing stopping me now
