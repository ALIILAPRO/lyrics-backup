		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pacing aimlessly, with my mind in unrest
Unsure of what may come
What have I done to bring this down on me?
Helpless to make this undone

All in due time, see the world through different eyes
All in due time, the shadows will give way to light

How much more can I give of myself
As these walls close in on me?
As I slip down into this despair (to this despair)
There is nothing to attain

What victory? (What victory?)
When my soul is weak (is weak)
Where does my help come from?

All in due time, see the world through different eyes
I see the world through different eyes
All in due time, shadows will give way, give way to light

All that we suffer through leads to determination
The trials we all go through gives us the strength to carry on
Something within us burns, desire feeds the will to live
A reason to believe I will see redemption, yeah

All in due time, see the world through different eyes
I see the world through different eyes
All in due time, the shadows will give way to light
All in due time
