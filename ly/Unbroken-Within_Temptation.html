		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You push me away and the air now is choking
I can't believe it, I can't let it go
You tell me it's real and it feels like I'm dying
You think you save me, hurting me just more

And in the silent darkness
It's the demon whisperers
Lost yourself and take the fall

Now you're breaking the chains and the dark's getting out in the open
And you're hating yourself, 'cause you know that a world's getting broken
Always doubting yourself, gotta fight it, you don't wanna show it
You burnt it down this time your curse can't be unbroken
Unbroken
Unbroken

You think you have changed, and you can't keep on fighting
And you're not good enough for me, no more
You're breaking away and there is no denying
Don't wanna share your misery anymore

And in the silent darkness
It's the demon whisperers
Lost yourself and take the fall

Now you're breaking the chains and the dark's getting out in the open
And you're hating yourself, 'cause you know that a world's getting broken
Always doubting yourself, gotta fight it, you don't wanna show it
You burn it down, this time your curse can't be unbroken
Unbroken

You take the fall, it's forevermore
Unbroken
Can't let it go, it's forevermore
Evermore you fall
Heavy-hearted we roam
Memories can't let go
Everything's so hollow
We fear what we don't know

Heavy-hearted we roam
Memories can't let go
Everything's so hollow
We fear what we don't know
Don't know
Unbroken
Unbroken

Now you're breaking the chains and the dark's getting out in the open
And you're hating yourself, 'cause you know that a world's getting broken
Always doubting yourself, gotta fight it, you don't wanna show it
You burn it down this time, your curse can't be unbroken
Unbroken
Unbroken
