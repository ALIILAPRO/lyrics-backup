		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I step off the train
I'm walkin' down your street again
And past your door
But you don't live there anymore
It's years since you've been there
And now you've disappeared somewhere
Like outer space
You've found some better place and I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, oh
Like the deserts miss the rain

Could you be dead?
You always were two steps ahead of everyone
We'd walk behind while you would run
I look up at your house
And I can almost hear you shout
Down to me where I always used to be

And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain

Back on the train
I ask why did I come again
Can I confess
I've been hangin' 'round your old address?
And the years have proved
To offer nothin' since you moved
You're long gone but I can't move on

And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, yeah
Like the deserts miss the rain

And I miss you, I step off the train
I'm walkin' down your street again
Past your door
I guess you don't live there anymore
It's years since you've been there
And now you've disappeared somewhere
Like outer space
You've found some better place and I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, yeah
Like the deserts miss the rain

And I miss you, and I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, yeah
Like the deserts miss the rain

Deserts miss the rain
Like the deserts miss the rain (like the deserts miss the rain)
Like the deserts miss the rain
