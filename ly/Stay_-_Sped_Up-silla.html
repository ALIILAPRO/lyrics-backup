		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl I see something better for you
Than I am
Don't you understand what we have
Better run away if you can, oh
Baby, there's no point in fighting
For a love that never began
Baby don't you fall
Cos a girl like you
Deserves to know the truth
I'm no good for you
So baby don't you
Stay
Please don't stay
I'll only break your heart
I'll only leave you scarred
Tempt your fate
Take this pain
I'll only break your heart
And I'll just leave you in the dark
Girl if you made up your mind then,
Just stay
You can try persuade me
I won't change
To my past, I'm always a slave oh
Cos everytime I wanted more
My doubts, they always held me back
So it's time you let go
Cos a girl like you
Deserves to know the truth
I'm no good for you
So baby don't you
Stay
Please don't stay
I'll only break your heart
I'll only leave you scarred
Tempt your fate
Take this pain
I'll only break your heart
And I'll just leave you in the dark
Cos a girl like you
Deserves to know the truth
I'm no good for you
So baby don't you
Ooooooooh
Ooooooooh
