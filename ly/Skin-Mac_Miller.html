		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You hide your skin like you're shy or there's something wrong
You stylish when you got nothin' on, yeah
And all I do is make these fuckin' songs
So, finally, I made a fuckin' song
And now she comin' closer
Hope she crawls, she wanna jump my bones
You want it don't ya?
I was a soldier, now I'm comin' home
The war is over
Kick down the door, I hold your bends, you never break
You need to smell your sweet aroma
See I knows ya smell like cinnamon
Kissin' your lips
I lick my fingertips and get your clitoris in the mix
My dick on business trips
My tongue twistin' is ticklin' just a little bit
I'm swimmin' inside of your skin like a river
In the Caribbean

It's okay that you like it babe
(I like it baby)
And it's alright that you misbehave
It's okay to be this way (this way)
To live this, baby, baby (ooh, baby)
Chillin' with the AC

That's just the way that we are
You and me, super freaks here we are
I'm takin' care of each and every part
I opened up your legs and go straight for your heart
(The way we are, the way we are)

Said I'm too divine, too divine yeah, too divine
You are mine, baby
I'm Mr. Superfly
I'm Mr. Blew-blew your mind hot as June, July
I wanna make your water fall
Girl you my painting
You my art installation
Gonna fuck you, put you on the wall
All I wanna do is show you off
I want to put you on
Why would I ever blow you off?
Right now let's go get lost
Jedi been way too hot for way too long
I'm so exhausted
Whether that's your mind or mine we still get crossed
First your name is gone
Never understand until you have to stand alone
Can I have a mental hold
A band-aid for my damaged soul
I paint the planet gold
I swear it, Michelangelo
I don't understand you so
They didn't want a man when it was man was broke
But now they know me
And I know what I don't need
No Six, no Beamers, no Benz

That's just the way that we are
And when we swim with freaks here we are
I'm takin' care of each and every part
I opened up your legs and go straight for your heart

Voo-voo these hoes
Voo-voo these hoes
Voo-voo taste this, taste, taste this
Voo-voo these hoes
Voo-voo taste this, taste, taste this, these hoes
