		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I knew that we'd be more than friends
When I saw you shining
Somewhere in my heart, I knew
Somewhere in my heart
 
Holding on to my belief
Are you another heart thief?
Knew you'd pull my world apart
I knew it from the start
 
All of the love you gave me
You know it made me strong
Feeling alive now, back to life
I know where I belong
 
I'll never let them break me
I'll never do no wrong
We're on fire, we're on fire
And we're burning on
 
I keep looking at you and it feels like
I've been staring at the sun
Yer, you hurt my eyes
Can't look away 
Can't look away
 
We just keep on rising
Faster than the lightening
Looking down at all below
Trying to keep control
 
Now the grip is tightening
Gonna keep on fighting
Somewhere in my heart, I know
Somewhere in my heart
 
All of the love you gave me
You know it made me strong
Feeling alive now, back to life
I know where I belong
 
I'll never let them break me
I'll never do no wrong
We're on fire, we're on fire
And we're burning on
 
I keep looking at you and it feels like
I've been staring at the sun
Yer, you hurt my eyes
Can't look away 
Can't look away
 
I keep looking at you and it feels right
I've been staring at the sun
Got me hypnotized
Can't look away
Can't look away
 
I need to see it
Feel it
Breathe it
Don't let the light go, light go 
 
I need to see it
Feel it
Breathe it
Don't let the light go, light go 
 
I keep looking at you and it feels like
I've been staring at the sun
Yer, you hurt my eyes
 
I keep looking at you and it feels like
I've been staring at the sun
Yer, you hurt my eyes
Can't look away 
Can't look away
 
I keep looking at you and it feels right
I've been staring at the sun
Got me hypnotized
Can't look away
Can't look away
