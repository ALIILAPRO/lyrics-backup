		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This, this music makes me cry
It sounds just like my soul
Oh, but I'm not ready to win
Oh Lord, cause I don't wanna know what they say
'Cause I get carried away
Commodifying all the pain

The things they see in me, I cannot see myself
When you get bored of me, I'll be back on the shelf
And when the ocean rises up above the ground
Maybe I'll drown in

Cal-al-al-ah-al California
You only like me when you think I'm looking sad
Cal-al-al-ah-al California
I didn't think you'd end up treating me so bad

Oh (ah-ah-ah)
Come Monday, it's a dream (ah-ah-ah)
Broken my own heart again
Chasing something beautiful
Oh Lord, but I don't understand what they say
'Cause I get carried away
Commodifying all the pain

The things they see in me, I cannot see myself
When you get bored of me, I'll be back on the shelf
And when the ocean rises up above the ground
Maybe I'll drown in

Cal-al-al-ah-al California
You only like me when you think I'm looking sad
Cal-al-al-ah-al California
I didn't think you'd end up treating me so bad
Cal-al-al-ah-al California
You only like me when you think I'm looking sad
Cal-al-al-ah-al California
I didn't think you'd end up treating me so bad

Oh, I, ready, I
Na, na, na, ne
Oh, I, ready, I
Na, na, na, ne
