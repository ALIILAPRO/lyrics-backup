		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm the type of girl to look you dead in the eye, eye
I'm real as it comes, if you don't know why I'm fly
I seen you to try switch it up, but girl, you ain't that dope
I'm the Wonder Woman, let me go get my rope
I'm a supermodel and mommy, s√≠, mami
Amnesty International, got Bangkok to Montauk on lock
Love my ass and my abs in the video for "Promiscuous"
My style is ri-dic-dic-diculous-ulous-ulous

If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody (so give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body (so give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)

When Timbo is in the party, everybody put up they hands
I get a half a mil' for my beats, you get a couple grand
Never gon' see the day that I ain't got the upper hand
I'm respected from Californ-I-A way down to Japan
I'm a real producer, and you just a piano man
Your songs don't top the charts, I heard 'em, I'm not a fan
Niggas talkin' greasy, I'm the one that gave them they chance
Somebody need to tell 'em that they can't do it like I can

If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody (so give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body (so give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)

If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody (so give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body (so give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
