		  The D-Devils are back!

Can you hear me?
Do you know who I am?
Can you see me?
I live in the dark...
I am the Devil!
Dance with me!

You know what I can give you...
I can give you sex...
I can give you drugs...
And what I certainly can give you, is house!!!

Sex, drugs and house!!!

I can give you house...
I can give you house...
I can give you house...
I can give you house!!!

Sex & Drugs & House!

Sex & Drugs & House!

Dance with me!

You know what I can give you...
I can give you sex...
I can give you drugs...
And what I certainly can give you, is house!!!

Sex, drugs and house!!!

I can give you house...
I can give you house...
I can give you house...
I can give you house!!!

Sex & Drugs & House!
