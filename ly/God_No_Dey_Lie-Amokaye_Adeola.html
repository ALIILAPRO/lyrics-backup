		<p>
		  God no dey lie
God no dey lie
Oh oh oh oh 

The truth be say, God no dey lie
cnd everyday, His promise na for life 
The truth be say, God no dey lie
cnd everyday, His promise na for life 

You are not made to worry 
You're not made to cring o
He's glory is so real, for real
His mercy will reign 
You are great in this world
Cos your victory is so sure
Whatever the devil does, you'll overcome 
You will rule victoriously.

The truth be say, God no dey lie
cnd everyday, His promise na for life 
The truth be say, God no dey lie
cnd everyday, His promise na for life 

God no dey lie
God no dey lie
Oh oh oh oh 

I no go worry 
I no go fear 
I know who I serve 
E no dey fail 
No room for struggles
No place for tears
I know what I've got 
Yes I know, oh I know.

The truth be say, God no dey lie
cnd everyday, His promise na for life 
The truth be say, God no dey lie
cnd everyday, His promise na for life
