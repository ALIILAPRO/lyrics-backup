		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cyclops woman got one eye in her head 
Mascara clotted vision she is fed 
Cyclops woman can't see nothing at all 
She got a pin prick spiral hole 
She can't see nothing  nothing at all 
She can't see nothing  nothing at all 
Cyclops woman dying in her shell 
Guilt got her trapped in her nailed well 
Cyclops woman is the eye of the world 
Who's reflection's in the retina? 
She can't see nothing  nothing at all 
She can't see nothing, nothing at all 
Dilate, Dial-ate
