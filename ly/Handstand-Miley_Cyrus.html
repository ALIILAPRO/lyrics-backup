		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We met each other on the neon dinghy
Past the manta rays and palm trees
Glowing creatures beamed down from great heights
Electric eels and red venom
In the sky, we could see the riders on horseback, on comets
Coming toward us, kicking up with laughter
My friend Big Twitchy rode the boat into the light
Surfed the north break
We danced until there was nothing left
Just me and Twitchy 'cause that's all we knew

You're questioning the science 'cause you don't understand
How I'm doing what I'm doing in a fuckin' handstand
You found it so impressive that I do it again
My other one is busy, so I use my left hand
We took it kinda fast but you put it in slow
I see your mother's calling and you're hitting ignore
It's like you saw a unicorn, you don't understand
How I'm doing what I'm doing in a fuckin' handstand

I wish I could crawl inside your heart
Take you captive and then sail away
I wish I could know that it's forever
Take me captive and then sail away

You're questioning the science 'cause you don't understand
How I'm doing what I'm doing in a fuckin' handstand
You found it so impressive that I do it again
My other one is busy, so I use my left hand
We took it kinda fast but you put it in slow
I see your mother's calling and you're hitting ignore
It's like you saw a unicorn, you don't understand
How I'm doing what I'm doing in a fuckin' handstand
