		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuck

As it stands, a complacent fate will fall into your hands
Nowhere to turn - only the ending you deserve

And the ones you know are dust
And the ones you love are gone
Now you're fucked
And you're drowning in the desolation - tunnel vision

I can see the end at night
I can see the end at night
In the silent darkness, I reside - at the bottom of the hourglass

Forced to watch the sky fall
Bury your hand in the sand
I'm convinced that our purpose holds no meaning in their plans

Tonight will decide
If it's time to say goodbye
We all force our hopes to hold us up
As we fade to nothing
We're running out of time - where do we go when we lose the light?

I can see the end at night
I can see the end at night
In this fragile moment, I'll decide
If I've reached my ending

Halos overhead - a reminder of our deaths
We will toil our whole lives living under hollow light

Tonight will decide
If it's time to say goodbye
We all force our hopes to hold us up
As we fade to nothing
We're running out of time - where do we go when we lose the light?

There - underneath the hollow skies
We will fade into the night
These halos burn
Now the end is coming
