		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm feeling like an alien, baby
Riding around the world
I'm feeling like a stranger lately
'Round and around we go

Where did I come from? Where do I go?
I'm so far away from home
What am I going for? How can I know
What I'm fighting for?

I'm feeling like an alien, baby
Riding around the world
I'm feeling like a stranger lately
'Round and around we go and around we go
'Round and around we go and around we go

So where can I go?
A million miles from home
What am I going for? How can I know
What I'm fighting for?

I'm feeling like an alien, baby
Riding around the world
I'm feeling like a stranger lately
'Round and around we go and around we go
'Round and around we go
I'm feeling like an alien, baby
Riding around the world
I'm feeling like a stranger lately
'Round and around we go and around we go
