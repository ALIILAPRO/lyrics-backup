		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't make it easy, you never keep it straight
But you're so damn sexy, I can't keep away
I need your love, I need your skin
I need you baby to let me in

I can't get enough of you baby
I can't get enough, it's never enough
I can't get enough, I'm still hungry
Baby, give it up, cause I can't get enough (huh)

It's alright, it feels good
When I'm in your chains, it's understood
That you're my owner, my only will
Come and get me while I'm quiet and still

I can't get enough of you baby
I can't get enough, it's never enough
I can't get enough, I'm still hungry
Baby, give it up, don't you know

I can't get enough of you baby

Can't get enough of you baby
Never enough, do you want to give me some?
Can't get enough, don't keep me waiting
Never enough (hey, hey)

(Put it right here)

I can't get enough I'm still hungry

Can't get enough of you baby
Never enough, do you want to give me some?
Can't get enough, don't keep me waiting
Never enough

It's alright, it feels good
When I'm in your chains, it's understood
My soul confession, devil's due
Come and get me girl, it's up to you

I can't get enough of you baby
I can't get enough, it's never enough
I can't get enough, I'm still hungry
Baby, give it up, cause I can't get enough (huh)
