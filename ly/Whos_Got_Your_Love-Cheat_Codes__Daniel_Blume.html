		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been thinkin' bout you lately
You been on my mind
On my mind, yeah
Do you think about me baby
Maybe once or twice
Once or twice
Tell me

Who's got your love tonight?
Got, got your love tonight? Ooh-ooh (Tell me)
Who's got your love to
Got, got your love tonight? Ooh-ooh
Who's got your love to
Got, got your love tonight? Ooh-ooh
Who's got your love to
Got, got your love tonight? Ooh-ooh

Who's got your love to
Got, got your love tonight? Ooh-ooh
Who's got your love to
Got, got your love tonight? Ooh-ooh

I been thinkin' 'bout you lately
You been on my mind
On my mind, yeah
Do you think about me baby?
Maybe once or twice
Once or twice
Tell me

Do you ever think about
Hitting up my phone some night? (Ooh)
Just to talk, talk, talk
One more time, yeah (Ooh-ooh, tell me)

Who's got your love to
Got, got your love tonight? Ooh-ooh
Who's got your love to
Got, got your love tonight? Ooh-ooh

Who's got your love tonight?
Got your love tonight? Ooh-ooh
Who's got your love tonight?
Got your love tonight? Ooh-ooh

Now I'm lost in all my feelings
Is it real or am I dreaming?
Now I'm lost in all my feelings
Is it real or

Am I dreaming about you?
Dreaming about you
Dreaming about you
Dreaming about you
