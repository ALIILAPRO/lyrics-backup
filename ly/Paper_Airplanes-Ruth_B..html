		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are the song that I long to hear once more
You are the light that I keep looking for
Roses are blue if it isn't me and you
I gotta see, see this thing through

And I'll spend my lifetime
Sending paper airplanes to the moon
Praying they get to you
And I'll spend the rest of my days
Lost in this craze for you
Sending paper airplanes to the moon

Love so divine, all our memories intertwined
I found the truth in your honey eyes
And even though it's been a while
I still think about your smile
Every night before I fall asleep
I find you in my dreams
Somewhere in the trees

And I'll spend my lifetime
Sending paper airplanes to the moon
Praying they get to you
And I'll spend the rest of my days
Lost in this craze for you
Sending paper airplanes to the moon

And if the world stops spinning
Even then I'll be singing
Of you, of you
And when my heart stops beating
Even then I'll be dreaming
Of you, of you

And if the birds stop singing
And the rain stops falling
And the sun won't shine on you
Even then I won't be through
Through with loving you

And I'll spend my lifetime
Sending paper airplanes to the moon
Praying they get to you
And I'll spend the rest of my days
Lost in this craze for you
Send a paper airplane to the moon
Sending paper airplanes to the moon, moon
Sending paper airplanes to the moon
