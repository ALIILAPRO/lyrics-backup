		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stood along this lonely track
Watching the trains speed along
Weep, oh willow weep
Let me hear your song
So that my soul can be filled with joy

My heart and I
So alone in the fright I bear, so I asked
How long, how long will it take me to be your man again?
Tell me Mama
Oh how long, how long will it take me to be your man again?

As I try my best not to sigh
I still feel the tears on my face
I'm hated by you, you're loved by me
Though I can't take it, I will try not to break it

My heart and I
So alone in the fright I bear, so I asked
How long, how long will it take me to be your man again?
Oh tell me now
How long, how long will it take me to be your man again?

As I try my best not to sigh
I still feel the tears on my face
I'm hated by you, you're loved by me
Though I can't take it, I will try not to break it

My heart and I
So alone in the fright I bear, so I asked
How long, how long will it take me to be your man again?
Tell me sister

How long will it take me, will it take me
Oh so alone in the fright I bear, so I asked
How long will it take me, will it take me to be your man again?
Will it take me to be your man again
