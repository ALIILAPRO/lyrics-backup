		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  DJ on the beat so it's a banger
(It ain't over, it ain't over)
(It ain't over, it ain't over)
(It ain't over, it ain't over)
(Until your victory is won)
Yeah

Don't talk to strangers
Since a youngin' I've been totin' bangers
I might take that lil' bitch to Topanga
I said, "Stop, little bitch, you in danger"
Yeah-eah, you in danger
I might take your lil' ass to Topanga
Just don't move like no motherfuckin' stranger
Know I tote bangers, boom-boom-boom-boom
Stop, you in danger
I can take you to Topanga
Open my hand like Jesus and save ya
Know I'm known to tote bangers
Said, "Boom-boom-boom, you in danger"
Stop that now, you in danger
Stop right now, you in danger
Stop that now, you in danger
Stop right now, you in danger, yeah

Bitch, I ain't goin' for nothin'
Got this choppa on me, that I'm bustin'
If you run out on me, then I'm gunnin'
Hit you in your stomach, we tote 'em in public
I said, "We tote in public", we tote them bitches in public
Run out on me, then, bitch, well I'm gunnin'
Drop down on a fuck ass nigga, nigga, yeah
We don't click with you bitch, nigga, yeah
Pull up with the choppa, he get hit, nigga, yeah
Get off a nigga dick, nigga, yeah

Got it lit in this bitch like a Bic, nigga, yeah
Keep a Draco, bitch, it fuckin' kick, nigga, yeah
Boom-boom-boom-boom
Ain't talkin 'bout shit, nigga, yeah

Don't talk to strangers
Since a youngin' I've been totin' bangers
I might take that lil' bitch to Topanga
I said, "Stop, little bitch, you in danger"
Yeah-eah, you in danger
I might take your lil' ass to Topanga
Just don't move like no motherfuckin' stranger
Know I tote bangers, boom-boom-boom-boom
Stop, you in danger
I can take you to Topanga
Open my hands like Jesus and save ya
Know I'm known to tote bangers
Said, "Boo-boo-boom, you in danger"
Stop that now, you in danger
Stop right now, you in danger
Stop that now, you in danger
Stop right now, you in danger, yeah
