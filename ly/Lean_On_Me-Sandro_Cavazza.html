		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you're feeling down and all alone
And you got nowhere to go
Let's have a little conversation

'Cause every time I'm feeling low
I swing it up 'til I'm good to go
It don't have to be complications
If your smile had been washed away
If you cry almost every day
You'll always have a friend in me

When you're lost
When you're scared
When you're broke beyond repair
You can lean on me
You can lean on me

When you're sad and insecure
You can't take it anymore
You can lean on me
You can lean on me

If you feel like no one cares
And the winds are blowing everywhere
Like you got no destination
You know you can always be yourself
You can always call for help, yeah
And we will find your inspiration, my friend

When you're lost
When you're scared
When you're broke beyond repair
You can lean on me
You can lean on me

When you're sad and insecure
You can't take it anymore
You can lean on me
You can lean on me

Lean on me, lean on

La, la-la-la
La-la-la
La-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la, la
You can lean on me (la-la-la-la-la-la, la)

Whenever you're down on your knees and in sorrow
And thinking there ain't no tomorrow
You can lean on me
Lean on, lean on, lean on me

When you're lost (la)
When you're scared (la-la-la)
When you're broke beyond repair (la-la-la, la-la-la)
You can lean on me (la-la-la)
You can lean on me (la-la-la-la-la-la, la)

When you're sad and insecure (la, la-la-la, la-la-la)
You can't take it anymore (la-la-la)
You can lean on me (la-la-la-la-la-la, la)
You can lean on me (la-la-la-la-la-la, la)
Lean on me, lean on

La, la-la-la
La-la-la
La-la-la
(La-la-la-la-la-la, la)
You can lean on me (la-la-la-la-la-la, la)
Lean on me
(La, la-la-la)
(La-la-la)
(La-la-la)
(La-la-la-la-la-la, la)
(La-la-la-la-la-la, la)
