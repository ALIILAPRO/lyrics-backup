		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Holding hands at midnight
'Neath the starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Strollin' with the one girl
Sighin' sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?

Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
Nice work if you can get it
And if you get it
Won't you tell me how?

Just imagine someone
Waitin' at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?

Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
Nice work if you can get it
And if you get it
Won't you tell me how?
