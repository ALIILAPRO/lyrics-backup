		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Taken way too soon
I'm not at all what used to be
Shifting in a box
The past is nothing more than just a dream
Now I hear the call of evil growing once again
I'm powerless to change your fates
But in the end I'll shelter you my friends

Tonight we roam and if they listen really close
They can hear us sing our song
(La la la la)

And I can't give you back the things you had 
But you don't have to do this on your own
Even if you're never coming home 
You're not alone
You're not alone

In our own little world
Forever lost to passing time
No one knows what it's like
To wear a mask that you are trapped inside
One day the purple clouds
That hover over us will fade
Then we'll be free to cut the strings
To wipe the tears but now we walk in chains

Tonight we roam and if they listen really close
They can hear us sing our song
(La la la la)

And I can't give you back the things you had 
But you don't have to do this on your own
Even if you're never coming home 
You're not alone
You're not alone

(La la la la)
(La la la la)
