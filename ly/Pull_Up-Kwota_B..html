		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Slow it, slow it down baby
This is the vibe
Slow it, slow it down baby
This is the vibe
Slow it, slow it down baby
This is the vibe
Slow it, slow it down baby
Go ahead and lock that door girl
I can make your toes curl up
Freak, i know you like it rough
Even though we don't talk that much
I can still pull up on you
I'm in your city, i need something to do
And i just touched down, baby what's the move
I know it's been a while, i know you're in the mood
In the mood, in the mood
Slow it, slow it down baby
This is the vibe
Slow it, slow it down baby
This is the vibe
Slow it, slow it down baby
This is the vibe
Slow it, slow it down baby
