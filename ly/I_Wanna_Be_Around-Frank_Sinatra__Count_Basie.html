		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want to be around to pick up the pieces when somebody breaks your heart,
Somebody twice as smart as i.
Somebody who will swear to be true like you used to do with me,
Who'll leave you to learn that misery loves company, wait and see.

I want to be around to see how he does it when he breaks your heart to bits,
Let's see if the puzzle fits, so fine,
And that's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet,
As I sit there applauding from a front row seat,

When somebody breaks your heart like you broke mine.
That's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet,
As I sit there applauding from a front row seat,
When somebody breaks your heart like you broke mine,
Like you, like you broke mine.
