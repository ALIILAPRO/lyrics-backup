		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you're not the best with words but
You need to think before you speak
Although you're trying to be honest
You always say things you don't mean

I know you're not the best with words but (ah, ah, ah)
You need to think before you speak (oh, oh, oh)
Although you're trying to be honest
You always say things you don't mean

I know you're not the best with words but (ah, ah, ah)
You need to think before you speak (oh, oh, oh)
Although you're trying to be honest
You always say things you don't mean

Why do you always insist that I'm the cause of all your problems?
And even still you always wanna look to me to solve them
I'm really trying, but I can't see solutions
I've got my marbles, but I'm starting to lose them
I'll keep on thinking, but I know I'm running out of options
Yeah

I know you're not the best with words but (but)
You need to think before you speak
Although you're trying to be honest
You always say things you don't mean

I know you're not the best with words but
You need to think before you speak
Although you're trying to be honest
You always say things you don't mean

I think you need to use your words
I think you need to use your words
I think you need to use your words
I think you need to use your words

I know you're not the best with words but
You need to think before you speak
Although you're trying to be honest
You always say things you don't mean

I know you're not the best with words but
You need to think before you speak
Although you're trying to be honest
You always say things you don't mean
