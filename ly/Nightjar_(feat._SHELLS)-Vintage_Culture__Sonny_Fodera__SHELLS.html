		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't go wasting my time
Outta your mind, are you out of your mind?
I ain't making you mine
I wanna see you gone

Don't wanna be your nightjar, darling
Wait 'til it's good and dark
You might sing a gentle song
But you're a wolf at heart

Bye, bye, fly it on by
Find some other the girl, sigh
Bye, bye, go on and cry
I wanna see you gone

Don't wanna be your nightjar, darling
Now that we've had our fun
Don't think that I'm tripping, baby
No, you ain't my only one
Don't go wasting my time
Outta your mind, are you out of your mind?
I ain't making you mine
I wanna see you gone

Don't wanna be your nightjar, darling
Now that we've had our fun
Don't think that I'm tripping, baby
No, you ain't my only one
Don't go wasting my time
Outta your mind, are you out of your mind?
I ain't making you mine
I wanna see you gone
