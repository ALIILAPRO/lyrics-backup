		  I don't stay in the projects
I don't stay in the projects (yeah)
I-I don't stay in the projects (hey, yeah)
I don't stay in the projects (hey, ayy)

I'm still in the projects, Section 8 (yeah)
Matter fact I was just over there (yeah)
Went to my ghetto bitch spot in the back (parked)
Sat on the porch while she braid up my hair
The trap open wide everybody outside
Knock on the door twice if you wanna three-five
My nigga keep loud, but he sell it quiet
'Cause niggas be 12, that's seven plus five (ayy)
You ever sold candy to the candy lady?
Mama worked all the time, I was grandma baby (spoiled)
Jumped off the porch, picked up a .380 (baow)
It jammed a couple times, thank God I made it (amen)
Fast forward I picked up a Glock
Put one hunnid shots in my .300 chop' (blatt)
Cruisin' down Collins, my arm out the window
Sapphire Richard, you see through my watch (eat it up)

Came from nothin', no rear view gang, I'm not lookin' back (not lookin' back)
If you ever gave your word, then you must stand on that (stand on that)
I got members where I grew up, they're still flippin' packs
Just jumped off a private, took ten black trucks to the projects (go)

Came from nothin', no rear view gang, I'm not lookin' back (not lookin' back)
If you ever gave your word, then you must stand on that (stand on that)
I got members where I grew up, they're still flippin' packs
Just jumped off a private (where you at?), took ten black trucks to the projects (go)

Gotta pay what you weigh if you tryna get 'em (why?)
Comin' out the house be too expensive
Before rap it was ten mile apartment projects
Where the Bloods into it with the Hoover niggas (remember?)
Used to stay in True Religion denim
Now Amiri, these racks can't even fit up in 'em
Fuck with the lil' ho upstairs from me
She gon' get me a rental, fried chicken for dinner (ratchet)
12 hit the block, nothin' stopped, still gettin' it
But we shut down shop every Tuesday and Thursday (narc)
Slid four deep in a steamin' Suburban (what happened?)
Slam on the opp block, Julius Irving (brrt)
Them niggas trappin', but they weed ain't exotic
They boilin' the drank and they water whippin' (ah)
Turn my struggle to money I made 'em feel me
It was hard to believe now they know I'm different (go)
I come from where you can get crossed on the move (Memphis)
Back seat gon' treat 'em like Boo Boo the Fool (clown)
Riskin' my setup, put him in my casa
You gotta die too since you vouched for that dude (yeah)
'Member Hi-Tech was like forty a line (miss it)
Now it's discontinued, too hard to find (goen)
Eighteen years old, I committed that crime
Walked that shit down eleven to twenty-nine
In the projects

Came from nothin', no rear view gang, I'm not lookin' back (not lookin' back)
If you ever gave your word, then you must stand on that (stand on that)
I got members where I grew up, they're still flippin' packs
Just jumped off a private (yeah), took ten black trucks to the projects (go)

Yeah
Yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah
I don't stay in the projects (hey, ayy)
I don't stay in the projects (yeah, yeah)
I-I don't stay in the projects (hey, yeah)
I don't stay in the projects (hey)
