		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put me on top
City on lock, they like, "When he gon' drop?"
"He done shook the game up, when he gon' pop?"
"Yeah, they know the name but is he gon' stop?"
Back to back runnin', fuckin' up the whole summer
On the road, I'ma take the whole glow from 'em

We ain't had enough
Niggas speakin' down but they know who comin' up

And I'm still on my way
But the top don't look too far from me
Never caught off, not one day
And I'm still on my way (my way, my way)
Still on my way, yeah

I'm just greedy like Chubbs with a hustle like Pooh
Tryna get it out the mud, like what else I'm 'posed to do?
It was in my blood, shit, my family even knew
Twenty-two, I blew, I owe everything to Tru
Somethin' out of nothin', that's a cold situation
Know they probably hot but they froze in the faces
I didn't even rush, I was chosen but patient
Feelin' like Russ, I went gold out the basement
Get it by the cases, run the Evgle chains by the dozen
Told gang that I love 'em, it's a whole celebration
Barely gettin' started but still gotta embrace it
When it's from the bottom, it's a different foundation
Yeah, it's a different bag waitin' on the other side 
I just wanna live in salvation

We ain't had enough
Niggas speakin' down but they know who comin' up

And I'm still on my way
But the top don't look too far from me
Never caught off, not one day
And I'm still on my way (my way, my way)
Still on my way

And I'm still on my way (still on my way)
But the top don't look too far from me (no, the top don't look too far)
Never caught off, not one day (never caught off, not one day)
But I'm still on my way
