		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember the pink paint on the houses
Pastel daydream 
And the pink in our eyes
We didn't sleep that night

I remember the sand 
Was too cold to stand still
I remember the ocean 
Waved to us from the shore

Call me when you get into the city 
I can be anywhere in a 15 minute drive
So much pressure on a cup of coffee
Some things you can't leave to the sands of time

I remember the moon shone bright in the daytime
Hung over you like a halo
Those missionary eyes
Or mercenary in disguise

I remember in that moment I didn't love you
Protestant guilt drowned me
Before you could try
Before you said goodbye

Call me when you get into the city
I can be anywhere in a 15 minute drive
I want to tell you that I'll always love you
Some things you can only see in time 
Friend of mine
