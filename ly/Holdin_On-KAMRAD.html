		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alright another punch in my face
Another loss I must take
Another try to make me lose my mind (Ah ah)

Another crack in my bones
Another fight on my own now
Another crime will keep me up all night

I know I can shake it off i won't let go
Oh, I keep moving on babe i keep moving on
(Ah ah ah)

Oh baby, I love how it feels
When you hurt me the way you do
Say I'm out of my mind
I'm holding on, I'm holding on
Oh baby, I love how it feels
When you hurt me the way you do now
Say I'm out of my mind
I'm holding on, I'm holding on

I keep chasing this feeling
You'll call my name
I keep pushing my limit's, I'll go insane
I won't stop till I make it
I know I won't fail
I'm holding on, I'm holding on
I'm holding on, I'm holding on

Another stage in this game
Another wall I can't break oh
Another card you play to break my mind
(Ah ah ah)

Another scratch in my throne
Another heart made of stone now
Another scar I'll carry from this fight

I know I can shake it off i won't let go
Oh, I keep moving on babe i keep moving on
(Ah ah ah)

Oh baby, I love how it feels
When you hurt me the way you do
Say I'm out of my mind
I'm holding on, I'm holding on
Oh baby, I love how it feels
When you hurt me the way you do now
Say I'm out of my mind
I'm holding on, I'm holding on

I keep chasing this feeling
You'll call my name
I keep pushing my limit's, I'll go insane
I won't stop till I make it
I know I won't fail
I'm holding on, I'm holding on
I'm holding on, I'm holding on

I keep holding on now i keep holding on now
(I keep holding on now)
I keep holding on now (oh oh)
I keep holding on now
(I keep holding on now)

I love how it feels
When you hurt me the way you do
Say I'm out of my mind
I'm holding on, I'm holding on

I keep chasing this feeling
You'll call my name
I keep pushing my limit's, I'll go insane
I won't stop till I make it
I know I won't fail
I'm holding on, I'm holding on
I'm holding on, I'm holding on

I keep holding on now i keep holding on now
(I keep holding on now)
I keep holding on now (oh oh)
I keep holding on now
(I keep holding on now)

I keep holding on now (yeah)
I keep holding on now (alright)
(I keep holding on now)
I keep holding on now (oh oh)
I keep holding on now
