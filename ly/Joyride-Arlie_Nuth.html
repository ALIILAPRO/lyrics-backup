		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Should we have another?
Tell me how you feel
We can get to know each other
I gotta have you here
Tell me how you wanna do it
Tell me and I'm gonna do it
I don't wanna go when I know it's getting late
I just wanna see you but I don't wanna wait
I just wanna say that I need you here to stay
Where you going baby let me know baby
Let's joyride
I will do anything you like
Let's joyride
And I'll be everything you want
Cause it's your night
We can do anything tonight
That's alright
Let's joyride
Let's joyride
I will do anything you like
Let's joyride
And I'll be everything you want
Cause it's your night
We can do anything tonight
That's alright
Let's joyride
Should we have another?
Tell me what you think
Maybe something that you want it
I gotta have you here
Tell me how you wanna do it
Tell me and I'm gonna do it
