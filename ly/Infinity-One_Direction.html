		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Down to Earth
Keep on falling when I know it hurts
Going faster than a million miles an hour
Tryna catch my breath some way, somehow
Down to Earth
It's like I'm frozen but the world still turns
Stuck in motion and the wheels keep spinnin' 'round
Movin' in reverse with no way out

And now I'm one step closer to being
Two steps far from you
When everybody wants you
Everybody wants you

How many nights does it take to count the stars?
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh, baby, I was there for you
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?
Lie awake only hopin' they're okay
I never counted all of mine
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity
Infinity
Infinity
Yeah
Infinity

Eyes can't shine
Unless there's somethin' burnin' bright behind
Since you went away, there's nothin' left in mine
I feel myself runnin' out of time

And now I'm one step closer to being
Two steps far from you
When everybody wants you
Everybody wants you

How many nights does it take to count the stars?
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh, baby, I was there for you
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?
Lie awake only hopin' they're okay
I never counted all of mine
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity
Infinity
Infinity
Yeah
Infinity
Infinity
Infinity

How many nights does it take to count the stars?
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh, baby, I was there for you
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?
Lie awake only hopin' they're okay
I never counted all of mine
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity (infinity)
Infinity (infinity)
Infinity
Yeah
Infinity
