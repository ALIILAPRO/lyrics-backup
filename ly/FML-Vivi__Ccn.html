		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hope you know that I'm not good at keeping
I'm not good at keeping conversation with you anymore
Gave you my love you wanted more
You broke my heart what was it for
It's 2 AM and I'm not texting you on blacked out on the floor
Worst part I've been through this before
With you this life is like a war
And I can't tell you how I'm feeling cuz you'll go and slam the
Door in my face
I'm working so hard for change
Before you told me you love me now it's not the same
You see that look in my face
I want some jewels on my chain
These diamonds will be forever but you not the same
You slam the door in my face
I'm working so hard for change
Before you told me you love me now it's not the same
You see that look in my face
I want some jewels on my chain
These diamonds will be forever but you not the same
No I don't know where I've been and I don't know where I'm at
But now I'm focus on the money and I'm not looking back
My life is moving so quick my life is moving so fast
I need to stop and catch my breath might have a panic attack
And now I'm running to Paradise
Cuz I love my life without you
I thought I never would be all right
But know I'm just fine without you
Gave you my love you wanted more
You broke my heart what was it for
It's 2 AM and I'm not texting you on blacked out on the floor
Worst part I've been through this before
With you this life is like a war
And I can't tell you how I'm feeling cuz you'll go and slam the
Door in my face
I'm working so hard for change
Before you told me you love me now it's not the same
You see that look in my face
I want some jewels on my chain
These diamonds will be forever but you not the same
You slam the door in my face
I'm working so hard for change
Before you told me you love me now it's not the same
You see that look in my face
I want some jewels on my chain
These diamonds will be forever but you not the same
