		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What do I see
On the icy plains
The desolate one
It's my terrain
The wind it blows cold

Howling my name
I am the king
The king of this waste
Can't you see this barren land

Lain to waste
Ravaged, scorched, yet frozen
From your neglect
I am the formless one

I came to save
You are the chosen ones
You'll be my slaves
I stand on the glacier

Above it all
Watching them crumble
Watching them crawl
Iced Earth has risen

Nature will fall
Can you feel the madness here
Drawing you all too near
Earth, fire, water and air

Save yourselves from despair
We are together now
Crush the cowards, do it now
End the light, end the one

We have come to save
The young ones
So on an on
The story goes

Destroying yourselves
The pain it shows
