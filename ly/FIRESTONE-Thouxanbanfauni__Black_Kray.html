		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Wake up, F1lthy) frog eyes on my lens
Know they gone like the wind
Hanging with some dead friends
Know we all born to sin
No, they can't run in no,  they can't run in

Know they gone like the wind
Frog eyes by my lens
Steppin' like some Louboutins
Peel the coupe, dirty Hen'
See the light shine within
Hanging with some dead friends
Why they put 'em on a shirt?
Know we all came from dirt
I pray they see Heaven first
I know it all could've been worse
I know it all could've been worse
In all black like a hearse

Pull up on 'em like the first
Angel wings fly like birds
Know they gone like a jet
Shed a tear for the set
Popped a seal and Percocet
She gon' pop it for the set
Popping shit like some X
Black bandana on the TEC
Blood stains on Nike Techs
You know we runnin' up a check
Bloody seats up in the Lex
Hang with my dogs like a vet
Hang with my dogs like a vet
They gon' hate you at your best
But you gotta keep gettin' it, yeah
But you gotta keep gettin' it, yeah

Know they gone like the wind
Frog eyes by my lens
Steppin' like some Louboutins
Peel the coupe, dirty Hen'
See the light shine within
Hanging with some dead friends
Why they put 'em on a shirt?
Know we all came from dirt
I pray they see Heaven first
Know they gone like the wind
Frog-eyes by my lens
Steppin' like some Louboutins
Peel the coupe, dirty Hen'
See the light shine within
Hanging with some dead friends

Turn your Firestone to kin
Eights and the Forgi' rim
Ran up a thousand bands tTB, our money in
TTB, our money in i'm a man of my word
Actions speak way louder than 'em
Carbon fiber, three-round burst
Ammunition to stretch your denim
Grand daddy Chevrolet
Candy paint, cherry red
Shorty used to leave my ass on read
No hard feelings, upgraded instead
Knew you was a bird when
I whipped up the bread
Trying to build trust but loyalty dead
My boy got crossed out, took to the feds
Going down south, put ten in his neck

Know they gone like the wind
Frog eyes by my lens (I'm working on dying)
Steppin' like some Louboutins
Peel the coupe, dirty Hen'
See the light shine within
Hanging with some dead friends
Why they put 'em on a shirt?
Know we all came from dirt
I pray they see Heaven first
I know it all could've been worse
I know it all could've been worse
In all black like a hearse
