		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me back to the days before the war
Set me free from the pain I can't ignore
It turned for the worse
So listen to my words

Go stand your ground
And break me for this one thing I know
There's a side to it we'll never show
No matter where it ends
Never let you see
How I bleed

See I don't know if I'll be heard
I'm just a single voice, a messenger
Here's the one thing I can say
You won't see anyone of us surrendering

Take my life, I don't care anymore
Found a cause that is worth dying for
We tried so hard to fly
And prevent the fall
Has it really counted after all
We had the stars in our eyes
And our hearts of gold
That's how it's told

Stand your ground
And break me for there's one thing I know
There's a side to it we'll never show
No matter where it ends
Never let you see
How I bleed

See I don't know if I'll be heard
I'm just a single voice, a messenger
Here's the one thing I can say
You won't see anyone of us surrendering

End my story
All for the sake of glory
Spread my message
Cause we are not the same as you
Cause we are not the same as you

Take me back to the days before the war
Erase the pain and suffering
The only thing we ever know for sure

See I don't know if I'll be heard
I'm just a single voice, a messenger
Here's the one thing I can say
You won't see anyone of us surrendering

Tossing and turning
I never will let you achieve
What you dream to fulfill
Never let you see who I am
And how I bleed
