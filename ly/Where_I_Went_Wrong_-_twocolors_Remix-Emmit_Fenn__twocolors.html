		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You made a promise 
But you changed your mind and forgot it
And I tried to fix it
But you gave me nothing secrets
 
And I don’t know where I went wrong
Cause now you saying it was all my fault
I’m just glad we moved on
 
I’m just glad we moved on
 
And I’ll never forget 
Laying in bed saying this it is
And you left the front door
Tailored in bricks saying my loves gone
 
And I don’t know where I went wrong
Cause now you saying it was all my fault
I’m just glad we moved on
 
I’m just glad we moved on
