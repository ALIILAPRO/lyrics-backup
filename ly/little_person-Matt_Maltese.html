		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm just a little person one person in a sea
Of many little people
Who are not aware of me i do my little jobs
Live my little life eat my little meals
Miss my little kid and wife

And somewhere, maybe someday
Maybe somewhere far away
I’ll find a second little person
Who will look at me and say
"I know you, you're the one I've waited for
Let’s have some fun"

Life is precious, every minute
And more precious with you in it
So let's have some fun
We'll take a road trip way out west
You're the one I like the best
I'm glad I found you
I like hangin' 'round you
You're the one I like the best

Somewhere, maybe someday
Maybe somewhere far away
Somewhere, maybe someday
Maybe somewhere far away
Somewhere, maybe someday
Maybe somewhere far away
I’ll find a second little person
And we’ll go out and play
