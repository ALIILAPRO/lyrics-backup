		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Murder up in my soul, my heart is cold
Murder up in my soul, my heart is cold
Murder up in my soul, my heart is cold
Murder up in my soul, my heart is cold (woo)

Hop out the-, hop out the-, hop out the-
Hop out the van, I shoot (who shoot?)
Hop out the van, I shoot (who shoot?)
Hop out the van, I shoot (who shoot?)
Hop out the van, I shoot (who shoot?)
Hop out the van, I shoot (who shoot?)
Hop out the van, I shoot (who shoot?)
Hop out the van, I shoot (who shoot?)
Hop out the van, I shoot (who shoot?)

Like it's my birthday, I just went and I copped me a new AK
Send my dog up the road some JPay (hey)
I had two pretty hoes, the tre way (woo)
Brand new Birkin, a Kelly for baby (freaky)
Spent that money, she never gon' go away (hey)
Caught an opp, now the Glock is a throwaway (bah)
I get racks in the wall and the doorway (racks)
I'm so rich, I might have to go murder for hire (hire)
Murder for hire, murder for hire (who ready?)
You know that the murder rate high (baow, baow, baow)
Murder for hire (hey), murder for hire (ayy)
Murder for hire (hey), you know that the murder rate high (brrt)

Murder up in my soul, my heart is cold
Murder up in my soul, my heart is cold
Murder up in my soul, my heart is cold
Murder up in my soul, my heart is cold

Tell that bitch to get the drop (skrrt)
Drop (skrrt), drop (skrrt), drop (skrrt)
Get the drop (skrrt), drop (skrrt), drop (skrrt), drop (skrrt)

Hop out the-, hop out the-
Hop out the van, I shoot (who shoot?)
Hop out the van, I shoot (who shoot?)
Hop out the van, I shoot (who shoot?)
Hop out the van, I shoot (who shoot?)
Hop out the van, I shoot (who shoot?)
Hop out the van, I shoot (who shoot?)
Hop out the van, I shoot (who shoot?)
Hop out the van, I shoot (who shoot?)

Murder up in my soul, my heart is cold
Murder up in my soul, my heart is cold
Murder up in my soul, my heart is cold
Murder up in my soul, my heart is cold
