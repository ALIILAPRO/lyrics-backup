		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I bet my love you
That I can't deny
That that could be such a mistake
Never crossed my mind

Such a surprise to me
You switching sides
I don't know quite how to respond
To your change of mind

Should I feel guilty?
Should it console me?

I feel like screaming
Oh, oh, oh
I'm hurt and I'm reeling
Can't you take away this feeling?
Stop! Why are you walking away?

I don't wanna feel like screaming
Oh, oh, oh
I'm shocked and I'm reeling
Won't you take away this feeling?
Why is it them you suddenly adore?

I scowl across the room
I see you smile
I can't believe that I thought
It was metro-groom
I didn't know and now I feel so vile

I feel like screaming...
