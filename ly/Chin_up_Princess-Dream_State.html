		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A devil on the run
But always down for fun
She had it all yeah, she ruled everyone
From a pedestal
Behind a broken wall
A sorry soul just waiting for the fall
Everyone she thought she knew
And all the ones she loved
They had vanished, they had gone
Where are they now?
Anyone she held on to
would leave her black and blue
They had vanished, they had gone
Where are they now?

Chin up princess
Tomorrow is a new day
Bottle after bottle, that's what the voice inside her says

She sought perfection in them, they let her down in the end
But no one hurt her more than she could ever hurt herself
And it shows, yeah it shows, but she will never know
Wrapped up in a web of lies and all that's left are severed ties
Spiralling out of control, it's like you lost your soul
Fickle empty words, you can't take anymore
Tangled and twisted in a clever disguise
Hold your tongue my love, this is your demise

Chin up princess
Tomorrow is a new day
Bottle after bottle, that's what the voice inside her says
Picking up the pieces of her broken dreams
Wanting to be set free from the ropes of toxicity

Everyone she thought she knew
And all the ones she loved
They had vanished, they had gone
Where are they now?
Her crown shattered when it fell to the ground
her kingdom was gone

Shattered when it fell to the ground
Lies upon lies, they unfold
Lies upon lies, they unfold
So I'm told

Chin up princess
Tomorrow is a new day
Bottle after bottle, that's what the voice inside her says
Picking up the pieces of her broken dreams
Wanting to be set free from the ropes of toxicity

Lies, they, lies they unfold

Lies upon lies, they unfold
Lies upon lies, they unfold
