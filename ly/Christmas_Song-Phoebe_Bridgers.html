		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Coming back from the country
Full of good food and lousy beer
This winter's so dry, and the dirt road so dusty
At the lightest fall of rain, the bacteria bloom

You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's easy to forget
The sadness comes crashing like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no-one can fix it

Tethered to the table
With that happy holiday crowd
And it's anchors away, looks like smooth sailing
But the merest hint of waves could capsize you

You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's so easy to forget
And sadness comes crashing like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no-one can fix it

The desire for annihilation
Is as common as it is unkind
And it's hard to recognize the situation
When you're desperately trying to have a good time

You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's so easy to forget
And sadness comes crashing like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no-one can fix it
Yeah it's Christmas so no-one can fix it
