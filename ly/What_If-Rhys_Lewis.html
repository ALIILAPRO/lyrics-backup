		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you tried
To cut out the noise
To get me to hear
The love in your voice
But I was so deaf
To all but myself
So you just went silent
Stopped trying to help

It took a while to realize
But things are clearer over time
And those mistakes we made were mine

But what if, what if we'd held on for longer?
What if, what if breaking made us stronger?
Either way I'm contemplating
If there's a way to get you back
'Cause every day I'm tired of thinking
What if? What if? What if? What if?

Well I know you tried
To get me to see
Myself in the mirror
The way that you saw me
But I was so blind
And all I could do
Was think that my darkness
Was the shadow of you

But what if, what if we'd held on for longer?
Or what if, what if breaking made us stronger?
Either way I'm contemplating
If there's a way to get you back
'Cause every day I'm tired of thinking
What if? What if? What if?

Every day I learn to love you a little more
And every day I swear to give you
What I never gave before

If every day I learn to love you a little more
And every day I swear to give you
What I never gave before
What I never gave before

So, what if? What if? What if? What if? What if? What if?
What if, what if we'd held on for longer?
What if, what if breaking made us stronger?
Either way I'm contemplating
If there's a way to get you back
'Cause every day I'm tired of thinking
What if? what if? what if?

Every day I learn to love you a little more
And every day I swear to give you
What I never gave before

If every day I learn to love you a little more
And every day I swear to give you
What I never gave before
