		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feels like my life is ready to blow
Me and my love, we'll take it slow
I hope she knows that I'll love her long
I just don't know where the hell I belong (oh, no)

How optimism led me astray
Two hundred things I took the wrong way
But I saw her love gauge runnin' low
I tried to fill, but it overflowed

Feels like my life is ready to blow
Me and my love, we're takin' it slow
I hope she knows that I'll love her long
I just don't know where the hell I belong (oh, no)

She remembers my name
Could be blown way out
It's all goin' to change
She remembers my name

But she was only messing around
Please, no more playing with my heart
Ooh, go Mr. Right just for once
(Then it all just came out) ooh
No more mischief with my mind (guess I'll hold in, next time)

No more gettin' it wrong
I'll be frozen, here on
If forever, we'll see
No more guessin' for me

Ooh, I was just so sure of everything
Ooh, that's what you get for dreamin' aloud
(Then it all just came out)
(Guess I'll hold in, now on)
(If forever, we'll see)
Ooh, the day that words are clearer for me (no more guessing for me)
