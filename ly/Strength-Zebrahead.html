		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Turn the TV off
Turn me on 
Disbelief confidence is gone 
You can take all this from me 
Stands my integrity (now) 
I'm so sick of mother fuckers 
Crooked wars that they wage 

Should I sit and count the seconds till were all blown away? 
Sex, tyrants, violence on the news everyday 
Ignorance turned anger into hate 

Turn away 
Strength in diversity, unity, and evolution
Strength in diversity, unity, and evolution
Strength in diversity, unity, and evolution
Strength in diversity, unity, and evolution

Revolution 
Now you're gone and it's forever 
Nothing is the same 
Right to wrong we'll come together 
Time to make a change 

Turn the TV off
Turn me on 
Disbelief confidence is gone 
You can take all this from me 
Stands my integrity (now) 
And these wars that we wage 

Why? 
An eye for an eye 
So I lock, load, engage 
Casualty high supply 
We'll be missing all our friends who die to get us by 
Courage facing fear 
Hate increase decline 

[Chorus]

Strength in diversity, unity, and evolution
Strength in diversity, unity, and evolution
Strength in diversity, unity, and evolution
Strength in diversity, unity, and evolution

Revolution 
Turn the TV off
Turn me on 
Disbelief confidence is gone 
If you take all of this from me
Then all of you can (come together)

[Chorus]
