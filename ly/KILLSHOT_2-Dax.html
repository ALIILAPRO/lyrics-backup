		<p>
		  LexNour radical infliction
Way I rap is an addiction
Placin' words onto this paper
Was a tactical decision
I was chosen by the gods
To merge the worlds and heal the children
While maintaining my humility
And killin' off the image

Of a weak ass, punk ass‚ selfish ass
Rapper who ain't never gave
A fuck about humanity
Every single nigga talkin' down on
Me has never put a second into treating any
Fan like they family
It's fucking up my sanity
Niggas even had the audacity to speak on
Me and say I didn't defy gravity
Merge two galaxies‚ could crack
The whole code
And turn the mainstream niggas into it's Dax
This rap shit is a religion
You get hated if you do somethin' different
Everybody's faking personalities and
Differing capacities
While Iying just to elevate an image
Individuality is actually a fallacy
And niggas gettin' famous off
These motherfuckin' gimmicks
Meanwhile‚ I'm broke 'cause I
Talk about the shit
People need that'll actually make
A motherfuckin' difference
So I'm finna pivot, revisit
Rethink my whole image
Bend time and defy all the physics
Nigga this is mainstream rap
That is consciously invisible
Indicative of ancient hieroglyphics
Nigga this is vivid‚ wicked, sick
And prolific
My thoughts all belong in the clinic
Next to the doctors prescribing you pills
Who've been' sayin' you're sick when
You're really just gifted
I was inspired by the greats‚
Illuminated by the hate
I understand what is real and I
Can smell what is fake
I cut the grass in my city when
They said I wouldn't make it
Just to witness their reactions and to
See all of the snakes
I bend, don't break, I'm 98
On the Richter, I can make the earth quake
My wrist's frozen, that's frosted, no flakes
That's great, go back, nah niggas too late

So this is a killshot, killshot, killshot
Killshot every motherfucker gon' die
I can rap circles 'round
The whole rap industry
With two closed eyes, both hands hogtied
I can turn a fat bitch skinny
A broke nigga rich
And give sight to a man that's blind
Meanwhile, ask the most important
Question in the world
Are you dying to live, or you livin' to die?

God worked for six days and took
A break on the seventh
I added five more to it
And still worked the eleventh
Adam and Eve taught a nigga like
Me not to trust no
Bitch 'cause she might trick me
Right out of heaven
I had dinner with the devil
Went to lunch with a reverend
Fucked a stripper in an alley then
I took her to breakfast
Just to prove I was a savage and to
Show my ex bitch I ain't a pussy
Hell yeah I had to teach her a lesson
Realistically it's about eight months till'
Your boy finna blow
I just got off tour like fifty-five shows
Come fall, I'm about to do fifty-five more
And typically
I don't ever reply to a nigga that's broke
Pussy lil' niggas you don't want smoke
If you didn't know then now you know
Uh, facts with it, I'm mad gifted
I'm going back to back, back with it
You half-witted
You niggas sayin' I ain't mad wicked
You mad twisted
I'm rappin' words, I make 'em mad vivid
Just admit it
I got a bunch of niggas mad livid
They addicted i hit rodeo and get mad
Fitted, get mad liquid, i hit-
Man fuck it
Don't even try to say I ain't the best
I ain't phased by you niggas
Got it tatted on my neck

So this a killshot, killshot, killshot
Killshot every motherfucker gon' die
I can rap circles 'round
The whole rap industry
With two closed eyes, both hands hogtied
I can turn a fat bitch skinny
A broke nigga rich
And give sight to a man that's blind
Meanwhile, ask the most important
Question in the world
Are you dying to live, or you livin' to die?

Or you living to die? Or you living to die?
