		  Desire
A Fire
Is burning for you baby
Giuliano
Desire
A fire
Is burning for you baby
Take me higher
Like choir
You're my Muse
My Melody
You're not a liar
Or crier
A strong independent lady
Please retire
Your pride yeah
And come be my remedy yeah
Desire
A fire
Is burning for you baby
Take me higher
Like choir
You're my Muse
My Melody
You're not a liar
Or crier
A strong independent lady
Please retire
Your pride yeah
And come be my remedy oh yeah
Baby, you're so incredible
The taste of your lips feels like an edible
You're mesmerizing (mesmerizing)
Appetizing (Appetizing)
Hear the words that I'm advising
Don't be shy baby start flaunting
Sexy ma the world go run it
Your soul and body I be wantin'
Yeah touch on me, come hop up on in it
Your skin's so smooth I'm bout to lick you down
Have you begging for another round
No, I don't plan on slowing down
A Queen I can't believe I've finally found
Sweet
That's how life feels like when you're with me
Sweet
Sweet like the fruits that bear on a tree
Sweet
Addicted to the thought of what we could be
Woah, woah, woah
(Ahh)
Desire
A fire
Is burning for you baby
Take me higher
Like choir
You're my Muse
My Melody
You're not a liar
Or crier
A strong independent lady
Please retire
Your pride yeah
And come be my remedy yeah
Desire
A fire
Is burning for you baby
Take me higher
Like choir
You're my Muse
My Melody
You're not a liar
Or crier
A strong independent lady
Please retire
Your pride yeah
And come be my remedy oh yeah
Desire
A Fire
Is burning for you baby
