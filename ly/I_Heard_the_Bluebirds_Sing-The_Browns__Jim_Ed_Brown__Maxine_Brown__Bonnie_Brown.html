		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I met a girl down in the hills that gave my lonely heart a thrill
Her beauty seemed just like a breath of spring
And when I looked into her eyes I thought it blue as a summer skies
And when I held her hand in mine I heard the bluebirds sing
They sang of wondering wondering if you'll love her
Will she marry marry if you'll ask her
Will her heart be heart be true for him for then and evermore
And when she's lonely lonely is he near her
When there's sadness sadness will her cheer her
Will they always always be together until the day they part

I courted her for months on end until she promised we would wed
We planned on being married in the spring
All through the long cold winter months it seemed that spring would never come
And every gloomy winter day I heard the bluebirds sing
They sang of waiting waiting for the flowers and of counting counting every hour
Till the bluebirds till the bluebirds chirps his welcome and tips the world each morn
And though we've waiting for the sunshine we keep hating hating every storm cloud
That has gathered gathered o'er the mountains to keep us for apart

And when at last spring touched the earth we were married in the village church
Our wedding seems just like a dream come true
So many years have come and gone our love is still as true and strong
As when I found longer ago till the bluebirds sing
They sang of loving loving every hour that I'm married married to my flower
We'll be happy happy ever after as since the day we've met
And though we've older older the love is sweeter we grow fonder fonder to each other
We'll be sweethearts sweethearts close together until the day of time
