		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If life was made by design
Then we were the shining beacon of the world
Now the sky just feels like it's crying
I'm dying inside babe
From all of the lies we've told
There's no one else around round round
Who understands the sound sound sound
Of my heart
No one else will do
But I won't be a fool
Cause of nights under you
Now I'll dance
Without you
Without you
So this is the end
Tell all of your friends
That I risked it all
Gave my blood, sweat and tears
So this is goodbye
I've made up my mind
And now I must dance without you by my side
Oh
This bed was made for your body
For us to be naughty and do what lovers do
But my love to you was a hobby,
Just A lover with money
Someone you could use
There's no one else around round round
Who understands the sound sound sound
Of my heart
No one else will do
So I won't be a fool
Cause of nights under you
So I'll dance Without you
Without you
So this is the end
Tell all of your friends
That I risked it all
Gave my blood, sweat and tears
So this is goodbye
I've made up my mind
And now I must dance without you by my side
Ohhhhh
Dance, Dance
Dance, Dance
Dance, Dance
Dance
Oh
So this is the end
Tell all of your friends
That I risked it all
Gave my blood, sweat and tears
So this is goodbye
I've made up my mind
And now I must dance without you by my side
Ohhhhh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
