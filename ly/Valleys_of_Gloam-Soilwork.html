		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It sends me back in time
From all the symbols and signs to you
So I'll take down that shield again
Every thought every feeling I preciously overspent

Let me see every fire that's burning
Let me worship the days ahead
Despite a sudden change
I am bound to feel the same, the same, the same 
Until the valleys of gloam call my name

It breaks the silence of mine
Erases words between lines too soon
I would ease all those worries within a blink
Drag my faith through the waters and offer you everything

Let me see every fire that's burning
Let me worship the days ahead
Despite a sudden change
I am bound to feel the same, the same, the same

I'd run my feet to the bone on cold and cobbled streets
Anything to make you weep, to catch you in your sleep
Our world was blind, but we stood side by side
But then my soul went through all those darker times (darker times)

Let me see every fire that's burning
Let me worship the days ahead (days ahead)
Despite a sudden change
I am bound to feel the same, the same, the same
