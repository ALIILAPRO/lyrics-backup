		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Then I strangled your neck
Because I love you too much
Then I kissed your red mouth
Because I love you to death
Now mother I need you
I need your claws in my neck
Every breath that I breathe in
Feeds the life that I lack

Now right here I was born
In the place where you kneeled
In a burning white sand
In the blood that you spilled
Far far in the distance
I hear the howl of the beast
I feel his breath on my face
I feel the edge of his teeth

And I'll swallow your sorrow
And I'll inhale your fear
And I steal your tomorrows
And I'll inject your tears
So please never forgive me
Please spit on my name
But I hold on to my memory
And keep me to blame

Please need me to blame
Yeah you need me to blame
You need me to blame
