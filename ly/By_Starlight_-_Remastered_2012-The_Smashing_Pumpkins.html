		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  By starlight I'll kiss you 
And promise to be your one and only 
I'll make you feel happy 
And leave you to be lost in mine 
And where will we go 
What will we do? 
Soon said I will know 

And are you just like me? 
Dead eyes, dead eyes
Are you just like me? 
Her eyes, her eyes were as vacant as the seas, yeah
Dead eyes, dead eyes
Are you just like me?

And all along we knew we'd carry on 
Just to belong 
By starlight I know you 
As lovely as a wish granted true 
My life has been empty, my life has been untrue 
And does she really know, who I really am? 
Does she really know me at last 
And are you just like me? 

Dead eyes, dead eyes
Are you just like me?
Her eyes, her eyes were as vacant as the seas, yeah 
Dead eyes, dead eyes
Are you just like me?

And are you just like me?
And are you just like me?
And are you just like me?
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
