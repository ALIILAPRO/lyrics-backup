		  [CHORUS:]
I gotcha
Aha-ha you thought you got away from me didn't ya
Aha-ha you thought I didn't see you now didn't ya (who me)
Aha-ha you tried to sneak away from me didn't ya
Aha-ha you thought ya being' slick now didn't ya
(Ha Ha Ha) Aha-ha now give me what you promised me
Give it up see'mon I gotcha gotcha hey alright
Well you promised me today that you'd quit your boyfriend
I'd be the next one to ease on in
You promised me it'd be just us two yeah
I'd be the only man kissin' on you listen
Now kiss me hold it a long time
Hold it don't turn me loose now
Hold it a little bit longer now
Hold it see'mon hold it see'mon hold it see'mon hold it see'mon hold it see'mon
Give me what you promised now give it up ooh huh ooh
Yeah yeah I gotcha
You made me a promise and you better stick to it
You shouldn't have promised if you wasn't gonna do it
You saw me and ran in another direction
I'll teach you to play with my affection
Now here you never should have promised me
Give it here (no) don't hold back now
Give it here don't say nothing just
Give it here see'mon give it here see'mon give it here see'mon
Give it here see'mon wo wo now I gotcha oh huh
Alright now
(CHORUS)
I gotcha huh
Ha ha ha alright (ah-ha) hey
I gotcha don't run away now
Ha ha
Don't hold back now (ah-ha)
Well
I gotcha a little bit more
I gotcha a little bit longer
I gotcha a little bit more
I gotcha
I gotcha a little bit longer
I gotcha a little bit more now
You couldn't sneak away and
I'm gonna get to ya
(REPEAT AD LIB TO FADE)
