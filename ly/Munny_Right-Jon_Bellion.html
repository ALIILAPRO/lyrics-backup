		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I said wait 'til I get my money right
Then you can't tell me nothin', right?
Said wait 'til I get my money right
Then you can't tell me nothin' (Right)
Wait till I get my money right
Then you can't tell me nothin', right?
I said wait 'til I get my money right

Eighth grade, I feel depressed as shit
'Cause my heart is in the future
And I know where I belong, it just takes time
Fast forward, now I'm twenty-two
Half a million after taxes
Just to make a couple songs and I don't mind
Eighth grade, I feel depressed as shit
I'll be a fuckin' Warhol with this beat pad
Let me paint and hone my craft
It just takes time
Fast forward, now I'm twenty-two
Making artists feel self-conscious
From the honesty and soul and I don't mind

Put the pause button on the weak shit
You sound like everybody else muhfucka
Put the pause button on the weak shit
You sound like everybody else
Put the pause button on the weak shit
You sound like everybody else muhfucka
Put the pause button on the weak shit
You sound like everybody else

I said wait 'til I get my money right
Then you can't tell me nothin', right?
Said wait 'til I get my money right
Then you can't tell me nothin' (Right)
Wait till I get my money right
Then you can't tell me nothin', right?
I said wait 'til I get my money right

Nineteen, I'm feeling scared as shit
Cause I'm dropping out of college
From an album made by Ye i'm out my mind
Fast forward, now I'm twenty-two
And we just sold out SOBs
"Look, son your future came today"
As my dad cries
Nineteen, I'm feeling scared as shit
I just got fired, fuck my boss
Cause all my bills have yet been paid
I'm out my mind
Fast forward, now I'm twenty-two
Yeah, I've been working, I deserve this
Yeah, I'm not afraid to say

Put the pause button on the weak shit
You sound like everybody else muhfucka
Put the pause button on the weak shit
You sound like everybody else
Put the pause button on the weak shit
You sound like everybody else muhfucka
Put the pause button on the weak shit
You sound like everybody else
You sound like everybody else muhfucka
You sound like everybody else
