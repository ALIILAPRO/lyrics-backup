		<p>
		  The fuck am I doing?

Yeah, it's 2017, iced out, big clock
It go tick-tick-tick-tick-tick, it don't stop (uh)
What the f- you mean? Shut the f- up, pussy boy
I go bang, bang, bang, 'cause why the hell not?
Oh my God, in the park and that's a WAP
Rest in penis, sorry cock
Thirty seconds in, job's done, bags up
I went ding, ding, ding
Ain't got time to give a fuck (yeah)

I ain't just a rapper, baby, I'm more like a grocer
I got cheese, I got bread, I got honeys, all kosher (BLP)
And my main girl's titties ain't Dolby
So when they say paper or plastic, we talking diplomas
Your girl's perfume my aroma
Six foot eight so I'm safe from corona
Keep on spittin' gas, I got mesothelioma
Keep on seeing dollars, I'ma catch glaucoma
I need her thicker than tortilla
Something more like pita
Modern family latina
I see her playing follow the leader
I just hit ten milli' on Christina
Uh, yeah, that's nice but I need some more
Me and Baby off the goop, I don't Mickey Mouse
Damn, baby, why you tweaking, bro?
Your bitch caught the Gravy 'bout a week ago

Yeah, it's 2017, iced out, big clock
It go tick-tick-tick-tick-tick, it don't stop (uh)
What the f- you mean? Shut the f- up, pussy boy
I go bang, bang, bang, 'cause why the hell not?
Oh my God, in the park and that's a WAP
Rest in penis, sorry cock
Thirty seconds in, job's done, bags up
I went ding, ding, ding
Ain't got time to give a fuck (yeah)

Of course they tryna click, flip a coin that's heads of tax
Carpal tunnel wrist, bust down bitch, I'm off the rails
Guangzhou when libido was found
Call me Romeo (Romeo)
When she took my shit down (yeah)
Check it out (what?)
Confirm the zeroes on the check, please (check it out)
I'm in a Tesla with my bestie (check it out, skrrt)
I took the shirt off, way too sexy (check it out, check it out)
I told Sheila confirm the rezzy
She gon' beat up on my chest like I'm George of the Jungle
Oliver Twist, I stay finnessing, all my old friends were fumbles
On my two, she like my dick, shit got my bag up from mumblin'
Seventeen hundred on some rain boots? I can't be humbled

Yeah, it's 2017, iced out, big clock
It go tick-tick-tick-tick-tick, it don't stop (uh)
What the f- you mean? Shut the f- up, pussy boy
I go bang, bang, bang, 'cause why the hell not?
Oh my God, in the park and that's a WAP
Rest in penis, sorry cock
Thirty seconds in, job's done, bags up
I went ding, ding, ding
Ain't got time to give a fuck (uh)
