		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (We don't need) no, we don't need (no more trouble) no more trouble!
(We don't need no more trouble)

Wo! Oh-oh-oh!
(We don't need) we don't need no, no more trouble!
We don't need no trouble!

(We don't need no more trouble)
Make love and not war! 
'Cause we don't need no trouble
What we need is love (love)
To guide and protect us on (on)
If you hope good down from above (love)
Help the weak if you are strong now (strong)

We don't need no trouble
What we need is love, oh, no!
We don't need, we don't need, no more trouble!
Lord knows, we don't need no trouble!

(We don't need) we don't need trouble (no more trouble)
No more trouble, no more trouble!
Speak happiness! (Sad enough without your woes) 
Fortune, come on, you all and speak of love (sad enough without your woes) oh, yeah!

We don't need no trouble
What we need is love, now (what we need is love!)
(We don't need) oh, we don't need (no more trouble!)
We don't need, no, we don't need no trouble!
We don't (need), no, brothers and sisters (no more trouble!)

We don't need no trouble, we don't really need no trouble!
Oh! We don't need no trouble!
What we need is love!

We don't need, we don't need no more, we don't need
No more trouble, we don't need no more trouble!
Trouble we don't need, we don't need
(We don't need) Lord, knows
We don't need no more war (no more trouble)
No more trouble, we don't need no more, more trouble!
