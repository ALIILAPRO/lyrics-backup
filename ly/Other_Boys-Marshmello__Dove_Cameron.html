		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I stare at you

Summertime, East Side, New York City
It's too hot to sleep
Half alive and my mind is dripping
I'm twistin' the sheets

'Cause my heart can't be satisfied
By anyone but you tonight
And when I try, it only makes me blue

Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I stare at you
Why can't you want me, baby, what can I do?
I don't want other boys, I just want you
I don't want other boys, I just want you
I don't want other boys

Silhouettes, a city of shadows
They all take your shape
In my defense, you've got me unraveled
And I can't see straight

'Cause my heart can't be satisfied
By anyone but you tonight
And when I try, it only makes me blue (why?)

Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I stare at you
Why can't you want me, baby, what can I do?
I don't want other boys, I just want you
I don't want other boys, I just want you
I don't want other boys, I just want you
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I stare at you
Why can't you want me, baby, what can I do?
I don't want other boys, I just want you
