		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Was it a wasted couple months?
Sneakin' out of the window, spendin' nights in limbo
Was that all there was for us?
Midnight drivin', runnin' through highland
Does it make me a criminal?
That I let you go, that I broke us and left
I hate that I never know
Why you're still so caught up in my head

I know you wanted a promise
I wasn't ready, can I be honest?
Never knew what I had until I lost it

And I got this rubber band on my wrist, on my wrist
And I snap it every time that I think about your lips
Got this rubber band on my wrist, on my wrist
Almost break it every time when I'm trying to forget

I know that I have never been good at this
Love you in a second, next you know I'm checking out
Of moments I shouldn't miss
Now I'm looking through the photos, wishin' I was different

And I got this rubber band on my wrist, on my wrist
And I snap it every time that I think about your lips
Got this rubber band on my wrist, on my wrist
Almost break it every time when I'm trying to forget

Trying to forget (trying to forget)
(Trying to forget)
(Trying to forget)

I know you wanted a promise
I wasn't ready, can I be honest?
Never knew what I had until I lost it

And I got this rubber band on my wrist, on my wrist
And I snap it every time that I think about your lips
Got this rubber band on my wrist, on my wrist
Almost break it every time when I'm trying to forget

Trying to forget
(Trying to forget)
(Trying to forget)

Mm
Trying to forget (trying to forget)
(Trying to forget)
Trying to forget
