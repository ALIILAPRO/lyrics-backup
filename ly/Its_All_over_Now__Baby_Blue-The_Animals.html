		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You must leave now
Take what you need, you think will last
But whatever it is you think you need
You better grab it fast

Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun

Look out the saints are comin' through
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

The highway is for gamblers, you better use your sense
Take what ever you've gathered from coincidence
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets

The sky too now is falling upon you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue
All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
Your empty handed armies, is all going home
The lover who just walked out your door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor

The carpet too is moving under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

Leave your stepping stones behind
If someone calls for you
Forget the dead you've left behind
They will not follow you
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore

Strike another match, let's go start anew
'Cause it's all over now, Baby Blue
It's all over now, Baby Blue
It's all over, Baby Blue
It's all over, baby
Baby Blue
Baby, Baby Blue
It's all over Baby, Baby Blue
