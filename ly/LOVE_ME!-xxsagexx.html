		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say that you love me
You'll never be lonely
There's no need to worry
So don't even try

Say that you love me
And never forget me
Yeah I don't wanna go back to that life

Yeah it's a weekend
Hold my hand hold my hand
I'm a demon
Do my dance do my dance

It's a weekend
Hold my hand hold my hand
I'm a demon
I'm a demon

I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna feel surrounded
I don't like my thoughts about it
I don't

And I don't wanna go back there
I'm stuck and I'm scared
You're all that I have

And everytime I think about you
I feel like I'll lose that place in your heart

Say that you love me
You'll never be lonely
There's no need to worry
So don't even try

Say that you love me
And never forget me
Yeah I don't wanna go back to that life

Yeah it's a weekend
Hold my hand hold my hand
I'm a demon
Do my dance do my dance

It's a weekend
Hold my hand hold my hand
I'm a demon
I'm a demon

I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna feel surrounded
I don't like my thoughts about it
I don't

And I don't wanna go back there
I'm stuck and I'm scared
You're all that I have

And everytime I think about you
I feel like I'll lose that place in your heart
