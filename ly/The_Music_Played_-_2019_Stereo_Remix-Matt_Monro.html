		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  An angry silence stayed where love had been 
And in your eyes a look I've never seen 
If I had found the words you might have stayed 
But as I turned to speak the music played 

As lovers danced their way around the floor 
I suddenly watched you walk towards the door 
I heard a friend of yours suggest you stay 
And as you took his hand the music played 

Across the darkened room the fatal signs I saw 
We'd been something more than friends before 
Well, I was hurting you by clinging to my pride 
He had been waiting and I drove him to your side
 
I couldn't say the things I should have said 
Refused to let my heart control my head 
But I was made to see the price I paid 
And as he held you close 
The music played 

And as I lost your love
The music played.
