		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The devil makes work
For idle hands
To fucking break my soul
One of these days I will finally fold
Ear to ear
I'm scaring you with my teeth
Ear to ear
I'm keeping you on a leash
And why am I still here
I can't stop this
Life is endless
I can't stop this
Life is a dream
Pick up your head aren't you sick of gazing at your feet
It hurts me all the time
Everyday is like a prison in my mind
Ear to ear
I'm scaring you with my teeth
Ear to ear
I'm keeping you on a leash
And why am I still here
It's hell to let me stay
It's hell to keep me sane
It's my own hell to pay
