		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh yeah 

You are my favorite lady
And you are my favorite man, yes, you are
I know that's right
But it feels good to know that you feel the same

And forever and a day
Together we will be
Nothing on this earth could
Ever take you away from me

'Cause I've been kissed but I
(Never knew love like this)
And I've been missed but I
(Never knew love like this)
(Loved someone before but I never knew love like this)
(I've had lots of loving but I never knew love like this)

You're something special
And you know you're something special too
I love you (I love you too)
And that's all I need to hear to make my day

'Cause you're always on my mind
No matter what I do
Nothing on this earth could
Ever keep me away from you

I've been kissed but I
(Never knew love like this)
Oh, and I've been missed but I
(Never knew love like this) Never
(Loved someone before but I never knew love like this)
(I've had lots of loving but I never knew love like this)
Oh, I've been kissed
(Never knew love like this)
And I've been missed but I
(Never knew love like this)
Loved someone before but I
(Never knew love like this)
No, I never, never, never, never
(Never knew love like this)

When I'm asleep at night
When I'm asleep at night
I dream I hold you tight
Ooh, I hold you tight
I never had a better love
(Never love like this)

Oh, oh
No, I never knew love (Never knew love like this)

I've been kissed, baby, yeah
(Never knew love like this)
And I've been missed, girl
(Never knew love like this)
Never knew love, loved someone before
(Never knew love like this)
I never knew love
I never knew love
(Never knew love like this)
I never knew love like this, baby
I've been kissed, baby
(Never knew love like this)
And I've surely been missed
Let's sing it together
(Never knew love like this)
(I've been kissed)
(I've been missed)
(Never knew love like this)
I never knew love like this
I never knew love like this, girl
(Never knew love like this)

I never knew love like this
I never knew love like this
I never knew love like this
Cherrelle, let me tell you how I feel
I never knew, baby (never)
Tell me how you feel, baby
I never knew love like this, girl (never)
I've been around the world (never)
But I never knew love
(Never knew love like this)
Never knew love like this, girl
Nobody kissed me like you do
(Never knew love like this)
I never knew your love could be so good
(Never knew love like this)
Ooh wee, baby, yeah, yeah
I never knew your love, I never knew
(Never knew love like this)
I gotta, gotta have your love, girl
(Never knew love like this)
Make it good to you, baby, oh
(Never knew love like this)
Take you home late at night, woman, yeah
Ooh, yes, Alex
(Never knew love like this)
Oh, sugar, yeah, oh, baby
Got to have your love
(Never knew love like this)
In the morning time
(Never knew love like this)
(Never knew love like this)
