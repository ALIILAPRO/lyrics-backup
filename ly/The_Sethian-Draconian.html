		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Listen, listen to the weeping
of the continents,
the shifting of the elements
And an universe locked in glass
by an abject patriarch of insolence

My knees won't bend
My hands won't fold
I've sworn dissent
upon your Father
I am the Sethian

I did not fall from grace,
I'll leapt to freedom
from the black iron prison,
from depravation to revelation
I'm but a dweller on the threshold
(of paradise and Earth)

My knees won't bend
My hands won't fold
I've sworn dissent
upon your Father
I am the Sethian

And you forget your god is a demon
I bleed in the lies you are preaching

This coffin in my heart
enclosed in the deepest dark
I was brought here
by the blasphemy of God
The perisher of Thought

Our knees won't bend
Our hands won't fold
We've sworn dissent
upon your Father
I am the Sethian

And you forget your god is a demon
I bleed in the lies you are preaching

The world is dreaming
(and) Your god is a demon
And mine is a mountain
of souls' screaming
