		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is called "Poor Boy"

Me and a poor boy was travelling
Travelling a long way from home
Me and poor boy got pulled off
Got pulled off and prison-bound

My dear mother, she got worried
When we was down, out on that farm
My mother, she called that farmer
And they told her I was in prison bound

My dear mother got on the phone
She called down that little farm
My mother talked to the sergeant
He would not have mercy out on me

Well this sergeant told dear mother
He would take two hundred dollar bills
We didn't have no one 
To call out and throw us out on bail

Poor boy, he got all worried
Come walking to a great big town
I said, poor boy, don't worry
Our mother get us out of prison bound

Well, this sergeant told dear mother
He would take two hundred dollar bills
We didn't have no one
To come and get us out on bail

Oh, my mother she got worried
She couldn't get them two hundred dollar bills
So, one Sunday morning
My mother, she drove to the farm

When the sergeant met my mother
Drove on up to her at the gate
My mother, she told the sergeant
She didn't have no two hundred dollar bills

Well, my mother, she kneeled down
My mother kneeled down upon her knee
Oh, my mother pleads the seargeant
Would he please, sir, have some mercy on me?

My dear mother, she been crying
Told the seargeant, then she broke down
He said, these boys promised
They will not hobo on my train

I said, listen, brother poor boy
Don't be worried and crying
Somebody, somebody somewhere
Gonna get us out of prison bound

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
