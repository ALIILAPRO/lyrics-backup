		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love. This is getting harder,
And I can't seem to pick you out of the crowd.
But you, my dear, have been discovered a liar.
And I'm afraid that this is building up for far too long.

And this is not the time and place for us to speak like this.
If I had the thought, I'd never dream of it.
So dry your hollow eyes, and let's go down to the water.

In a different time and place the words could make more sense.
In a perfect world, the future wouldn't make a dent.
So dry your hollow eyes, and let's go down to the water,
Even though it's the last time.

Love. This is getting the best of me.
And truth be told, you were the start of it all.
Now you, my dear, might end up lonely.
Before you go, there's something you should know.

And this is not the time and place for us to speak like this.
If I had the thought, I'd never dream of it.
So dry your hollow eyes, and let's go down to the water.

In a different time and place the words could make more sense.
In a perfect world, the future wouldn't make a dent.
So dry your hollow eyes, and let's go down to the water,
Even though it's the last time.

And this is not the time and place for us to speak like this.
If I had the thought, I'd never dream of it.
So dry your hollow eyes, and let's go down to the water.

In a different time and place the words could make more sense.
In a perfect world, the future wouldn't make a dent.
So dry your hollow eyes, and let's go down to the water,
Even though it's the last time.

Please let's not speak.
Don't breathe a word,
Even though it's the last time.
