		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mm, show me
Mm

Looking for love in all the wrong places
Looking for us in all the wrong faces (faces)
I'm always looking for lust when I'm wine-drunk and faded
Looking for love, I think we should make it

'Cause I've been feeling lonely
Hold me, tell me that you think I'm pretty
Show me how to love and then
Show me how to love again, oh, mm

I was once told I'm too young to settle (no)
But age ain't a thing, I'm just too sentimental (sentimental)
Looking for someone to write all the words to my instrumental (yeah)
And if I give you my heart, promise you'll be gentle

'Cause I've been feeling lonely (lonely)
Hold me (hold me), tell me that you think I'm pretty
Show me how to love and then
Show me how to love again, oh

'Cause I've been feeling lonely, lonely (I've been lonely)
Tell me that you think I'm pretty
Show me how to love and then
Show me how to love again, oh (love me)

Love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, yeah
Love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love again
Oh, love again
