		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "All good thoughts" in spite of righteousness
is the kind of thoughts in spite of greatness.
Often now the State is advocation.
If we form a power of recognition.

Forget loss and perfect advocation.
If it drops or stays in convocation.
All we praise is all we want in commerce
All we praise is parties, foreign commerce.
Entertain ideas of great communion,
Shelter not materials in union
(All we praise is not the kind of commerce.
That's the right solution!)

"All good thoughts" is not the act of doing
What we want but what we should be proving
(Properties?), ideas, a woman's pleasure
is empowered by love, a perfect measure!
