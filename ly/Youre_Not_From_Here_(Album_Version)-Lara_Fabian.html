		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know what is going on 
You turn around and touch my heart 
A silent moment speaks the truth 
Something has happened all at once 
It should have scared me in advance 
But I was falling in those eyes of yours 
And so
Fear was gone 
I knew there was nothing else I'd ever want 

I know you 
You're not from here 
I've waited for you to appear 
To take my breath way 
And make me weep 
You're not from here 
Not from this here and now 
Just a touch of yours 
And I fly, and I fly, and I fly

I can't get used to missing you 
If this is how it's gotta be 
I need an angel to watch over me 
No one can hold the hands of time 
But I can hold you in my mind 
Over and over like a melody 

For now 
I'll stand still 
For now 
I'll be filled by the memory of your skin 

I know you 
You're not from here 
You don't belong to lies and tears 
The greatness of your soul 
Makes me weep 
You're not from here 
Not from this here and now 
Just a touch of yours 
And I fly, and I fly, and I fly

I know you 
You're not from here 
I've waited for you to appear 
To take my breath way 
And make me weep 
You're not from here 
Not from this here and now 
Just a touch of yours 
And I fly, and I fly, and I fly

I know you 
You're not from here 
I've waited for you to appear 
To take my breath way 
And make me weep 
You're not from here 
Not from this here and now 
Just a touch of yours 
And I fly, and I fly, and I fly
