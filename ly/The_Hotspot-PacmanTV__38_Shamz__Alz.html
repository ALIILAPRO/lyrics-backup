		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  MH Beats drill Kartel
Lucii mixed this baby, haha
I run shit, I kill for nothing
And I make that some money and deal with the
Business, don't bring that shit
To me, again, did you hear me?
You're now locked into PacmanTV

But why the opps so COVID? Bats, bats
That one's a throwback if you
Know then you know them times there I was
Talkin' about next man
These times here man's talkin' about Ghost
He never post in Catty
But he just post his batty for mandem woah
Don't know what happened on Saxon Road
But I know I just gave
Him a backshot, no homo
But he grabbed his throat (Kill Confirmed)
I was out on the 7, lurkin'
Me and my bros, my back, my bone
Shit got intense when we backed our cheffers
Josh got intense on toes
He must've thought he was safe in
Mac D's no happy, no, nigga, no
Count yourself lucky, no triggers blue
We can slide 'round there on a GT-R, no GTA
Get swooped
We got corn that's live, take that
Out on a drive, now, the paigon's doomed
We got 45's, take that out in a night
You're gonna hear this boom
They got porkey pies
Salty guys when they get verbal abuse

Jump out quick then finish the function
Most time, I ain't on scuffin'
Run up on me and I'm dumpin'
Run up on me and I'm dumpin', baow
I got two-nine bars, I'm hustlin' music
Got a few bad ones, lost it
Feds on me and my marjay's cussin'
And my marjay's cussin'
Fresh from cells, my hair is all picky
An opp got trippy and left him red
PTSD, cah a man get yinged up?
Dream about that and get cheffed in bed
Step in the ends like, "Who's on us?"
Big T on the bus got swept and crepped
True I see 'nough man writin' statements
I guess we both need extra lead
But in different ways
When I'm trappin', I don't use Waze
I know this strip like your bitch's face
And she's dead, so it's a shame
On the maze, just itch it, bait
Always jump out, swingin' ridiculous blades
Tryna take face off like Nicolas Cage
Tryna take face off like Nicolas Cage

Rip open his stomach, pull out his guts
You don't want war with us
019', we did it on bus
Ten man step, watch all of them dust
One got caught in the Bexley, go ask him
He said "Bus" jV the wettest one
"Free 'em up" when he's out, get bun
Anywhere man step, I'm violent
Fuck Trident, swing my shank on the mains
I don't wanna hear 'bout Bluehills
Claim that gang get dropped on CG mains
Hello? Do you get it? 15 inch man wet it
More than once this beef is way too deep
I could never try dead it

Fuck them boy there
Stop fuckin' dyin' you pussios
Lucii mixed this baby, haha
