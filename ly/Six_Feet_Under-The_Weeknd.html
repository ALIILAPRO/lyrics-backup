		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ask around about her
She don't get emotional
Kill off all her feelings
That's why she ain't approachable
She know her pussy got a fan base (no, no, no)
A couple niggas with a suitcase
Suit and tie niggas who play roleplay
When it comes to money she play no games

She lick it up just like a candy (candy)
She wanna make 'em leave their family (family)
She trying to live a life so fancy (fancy)
She wanna pull up in a Bentley
She ain't got time for lovin' (lovin')
Louis Vuitton her husband (husband)
She rather die in lustin' (lustin')
She rather die in the club, 'till she

Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper (that fucking paper)
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper (that fucking paper)
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
You know how she get down, pop it for a check now
Six feet under, six
Six feet under (that fuckin' paper)
Six feet under, six
Six feet under (get that fuckin' paper)
Six feet under she gon' kill me for that paper
Not the type to fuck around, go and turn that ass around

She don't depend on anybody
Know just what to do with her own body
Countin' all that money like a hobby (no, no)
She don't give a fuck about nobody (oh, no)
And she got her whole crew poppin'
And she bend it over like she got no back bone
Got a couple niggas blingin' up a trap phone
She don't need nobody waiting back home, she got it

She lick it up just like a candy (candy)
She wanna make 'em leave their family (family)
She trying to live a life so fancy (fancy)
She wanna pull up in a Bentley
She ain't got time for lovin' (lovin')
Louis Vuitton her husband (husband)
She rather die in lustin' (lustin')
She rather die in the club, 'till she

Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper (that fucking paper)
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper (that fucking paper)
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
You know how she get down, pop it for a check now
Six feet under, six
Six feet under (that fuckin' paper)
Six feet under, six
Six feet under (get that fuckin' paper)
Six feet under she gon' kill me for that paper
Not the type to fuck around, go and turn that ass around
Go and turn that ass around
Oh murder, oh murder
Go and turn that ass around
Oh murder, oh murder

Real love's hard to find (real love's hard to find)
So she don't waste her time (she don't waste her time)
So she don't waste her time, oh
You ain't gon' catch her cryin' (you ain't gon' catch her cryin')
She ain't gon' lose her mind (oh)
She ain't gon' lose her mind, 'till she

Six feet under she gon' kill me for that paper (till she)
Six feet under she gon' kill me for that paper (till she)
Six feet under she gon' kill me for the paper
Not the type to fuck around, go and turn that ass around
