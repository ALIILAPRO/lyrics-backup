		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Paint da lamb slime green
I need chips blue cheese
Switchin both lanez dipped in givenchy
Ion drip I ooze fit so clean
Mama aint raise no fool can't finesse on me
Ten toes down kept it solid it solid to my peeps
Smashin on deez models send em bottles on repeat
Biscotti in my lungs never runnin on e
Heard deez boys talking like they workin wit da dz
Half a ticket for da fee I aint even have to leave
Fly like a bird n I sting like a bee
458 coupe
Switch to sport feel da breeze
Blowin out a cloud got my mind on ease
Young global mogul making ems wit da ease
Park da yacht in the sea
Jet ski to beach
LV on the feet
2020 aint released
Buy stocks
Buy cribs
Buy a business n repeat
Rinse it all up
Watch the taxes decrease
Lil mans watchin like dat man is g
Buy art make art make money make beats
Young fly rocksta sippin red stackin green
Helipad on the roof on the villa overseas
Take the choppa to port 10 mins no kap
Got vibes in the jetty so ready so lit
Paint da lamb slime green
I need chips blue cheese
Switchin both lanez dipped in givenchy
Ion drip I ooze fit so clean
Mama aint raise no fool can't finesse on me
Ten toes down kept it solid it solid to my peeps
Smashin on deez models send em bottles on repeat
Biscotti in my lungs never runnin on e
Heard deez boys talking like they workin wit da dz
