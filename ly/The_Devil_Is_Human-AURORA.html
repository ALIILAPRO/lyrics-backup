		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Father, don't blame us for trying to live
For trying to love, for wanting more
Father, don't blame us for trying to bleed
Like real human beings and nothing more

Why did you dress our pleasure up as greed?
While you're limiting our love, taking sunlight from the seed?
Why did you give us hearts we don't understand
Like an apple in our hand that you'll never let us have?

And I hear you don't like it
I don't care if you don't

Father, don't blame us for trying to live
For trying to love, for wanting more
Father, don't blame us for trying to bleed
Like real human beings and nothing more

Oh, do you envy how I'm free?
How the life in me is real, running barefoot through the fields?
Oh, does it hurt how I don't look at you with fear?
Do you like to watch me kneel, 'cause the way it makes you feel?

And I hear you don't like it
I don't care if you don't

Father, don't blame us for trying to live
For trying to love, for wanting more
Father, don't blame us for trying to bleed
Like real human beings and nothing more

You can burn the skin I live in
But you cannot burn the witch away
