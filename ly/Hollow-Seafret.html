		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is our final moment
One chance to say it all
I knew this time was comin'
Chose not to hear them call
I can't imagine a world now
Without you here

You were my one and only
I couldn't love you more
Wish we could keep on runnin'
Go back to like before
When you took hold of my hand
I let go of the fear

Like tryna breathe for the first time without any air
Without you, every step I climb just leads to nowhere
I close my eyes and wish we could disappear, just run
Anywhere from here, anywhere from here

I just fall in and I fall out
Must be something that can turn this around
You keep me falling
And there's nowhere to go
'Cause a life without your love
Is hollow
Hollow

Just give me one more moment
I'll tell you everything
I'll leave my heart wide open
I swear I'll let you in
A million reasons you should stay
I'll make them clear

Like tryna breathe for the first time without any air
Without you, every step I climb just leads to nowhere
I close my eyes and wish we could disappear, just go
Anywhere from here, anywhere from here

I just fall in and I fall out
Must be something that can turn this around
You keep me falling
And there's nowhere to go
'Cause a life without your love
Is hollow
Hollow

Night after night, you know it keeps me awake
I can't believe we threw it all away
I'm scared to death there's someone else in my place
Wish I could find the words to make you stay

I know we fall in and we fall out
But there's still time, we can turn it around
You keep me falling
And there's nowhere to go
'Cause a life without your love
Is hollow
Hollow

Stay, stay 'til the morning
'Cause I couldn't want you
Any more than I do
