		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you lend me a hand?
Can you help me to see?
Can you reconcile this war inside of me?

Time is slipping away
And I don't seem to mind
I'm missing something that I can't seem to define

Remember we die
But you're still alive
So don't let go
'Cause it's the only thing you know
There's plenty of time
To see the other side

Remember we die
But until we arrive
Don't let go
Just let the light shine from your soul
Before we run out of time
Remember we die

Can you lend me your ears?
I have something to say
I want to care before it all just slips away
It's a cunning illusion that time is on my side
I want to feel before I have to say goodbye

Remember we die
But you're still alive
So don't let go
'Cause it's the only thing you know
There's plenty of time
To see the other side

Remember we die
But until we arrive
Don't let go
Just let the light shine from your soul
Before we run out of time
Remember we die

I used to beg the angels
To carry me away
But as the sand drifts by I'm begging to let me stay

Remember we die
But you're still alive
So don't let go
'Cause it's the only thing you know
There's plenty of time
To see the other side

Remember we die
But until we arrive
Don't let go
Just let the light shine from your soul
Before we run out of time
Remember we die
