		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She gets too hungry, for dinner at eight (I am starving)
She loves the theater, but she never comes late
I never bother, with people that I hate
That's why this chick is a tramp

She doesn't like crap games, with barons and earls
Won't go to Harlem, in ermines and pearls
And I definitely won't dish out dirt, with the rest of those girls (Thank-you)
That's why the lady is a tramp

I love the free, fresh wind in my hair
Life without care, oh I'm so broke, it's old
I hate California, it's crowded and damp
That's why the lady is a tramp (I am a tramp)

Sometimes I go to Coney Island, oh the beach is divine
And I love the Yankees, Jeeter's just fine
I follow Rogers and Heart, she sings every line
That's why the lady is a tramp

I love a prizefight, that isn't a fake (no fakes)
I love to row boat with you and your wife on Central Park lake
She goes to Opera and stays wide awake (yes, I do)
That's why this lady is a tramp

She likes the green (green) grass (grass) under her shoes
What can I lose, 'cause I got no dough (oh no?)
I'm all alone when I lower my lamp
That's why the lady is a tramp

Go!

I love your free fresh, I love your handkerchief in my hair
Life without care, but I am so broke, that's oak
Hates California it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp
That's why this lady is a tramp
That's why the lady is a tramp
