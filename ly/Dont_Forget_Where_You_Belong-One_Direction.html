		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been a lot of places
I've been all around the world
Seen a lot of faces
Never knowing where I was

On the horizon
Mmh, well, I know, I know, I know
I know the sun will be rising
Back home

Living out of cases
Packing up and taking off
Made a lot of changes
But not forgetting who I was

On the horizon
Oh, well, I know, I know, I know
I know the moon will be rising
Back home

Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
And the proof is in this song

I've been away for ages
But I've got everything I need
I'm flicking through the pages
I've written in my memory

I feel like I'm dreaming
Oh, so I know, I know, I know
I know that I'm never leaving
No, I won't go

Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
And the proof is in this song

Lights off when they should be on
Even stars in the skies, they're wrong
Short days when the nights are long
When I think of the days I've gone
Don't matter how far I've gone
I'm always free to run home

Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong (don't forget it), home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
Never, never, never

Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong (don't forget it), home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own (you were never)
And the proof is in this song

Home
Don't forget it
Home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own (you were never)
And the proof is in this song

Never forget it
This song
Don't forget it
No, I never forget it
This song
You were never
