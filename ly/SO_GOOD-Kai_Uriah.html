		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I were to sell my soul
For all my goals
And all these gifts play all these tricks
Then I hope you know
That I won't go cuz they consist
And contradict
All that I know and I won't hold
Yeah not one bit

Uh cuz I feel so good
I feel so good
I feel so good
I feel so

And if they come back its no good
Yeah it's no good
Yeah it's no good
Yeah it's no

Get the lies out of my face
I'm tryna have a good day aye
If I had a million cars
Million bars
Million stars
Would I be acting the same

And if I had that would I change
Uh all of the thoughts on my brain
Look at my heart I was feeling far
Had a million scars
Got rid of the pain

But I can't take all of the credit
was acting a menace
He paid it in debit
I was on the floor and I needed a medic
Now look where I'm headed
On you I'm dependent
Write this on my heart cuz you know it's embedded

It's wrong of me if I take all the credit
And act like I did it all when I pretended
You know I'm dependent
I can't comprehend it

Uh cuz I feel so good
I feel so good
I feel so good
I feel so

And if they come back its no good
Yeah it's no good
Yeah it's no good
Yeah it's no

If I were to sell my soul
For all my goals
And all these gifts play all these tricks
Then I hope you know
That I won't go cuz they consist
And contradict
All that I know and I won't hold
Yeah not one bit

Uh cuz I feel so good
I feel so good
I feel so good
I feel so

And if they come back its no good
Yeah it's no good
Yeah it's no good
Yeah it's no

Cuz I feel so good
I feel so good
I feel so good
I feel so

And if they come back its no good
Yeah it's no good
Yeah it's no good
Yeah it's no
