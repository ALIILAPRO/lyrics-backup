		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did you see any action, did you make any friends?
Would you like some affection, before I leave again?
I've been walking behind you, since you've been able to see
There's never been any reason for you to think about me.

Did you have any bad dreams, did you break any glass?
Would you be my companion, is there even a chance?
You've been talking in circles, since I've been able to cry
There's never been any reason for never telling me why yea ha

Save my life I'm going down for the last time
Woman with a sweet lovin' better than a white line
Bring a good feelin' ain't had in such a long time
Save my life I'm going down for the last time

Have you ever been lonely, do you have any fun?
Do you ever think of me, I'm just another one , yea
You never give me no answer, you never tell me the truth
There's never been any reason for me to think about you
There's never been any reason
There's never been any reason, yea haa
There's never been any reason
Save my life I'm going down for the last time.	
Woman with a sweet lovin' better than a white line
Don't you know she could bring a good feelin' ain't had in such a long time
Save my life I'm going down for the last time, woah
Save my life I'm going down for the last time
Save my life I'm going down for the last time 
Save my life I'm going down for the last time
Save my life I'm going down for the last time
Save my life I'm going down for the last time
