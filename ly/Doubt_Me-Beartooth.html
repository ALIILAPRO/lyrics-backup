		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been used by the useless
My whole body's covered in bruises
Consumed by the clueless
So full of lies and excuses

I've let you take enough from me
I'm jumping ship to watch you sink
When you look back and I'm still standing

Remember every time you doubt me
It makes me stronger than before
When you doubt me
It fuels the fire even more
So give me all you've got
I can't wait to watch you rot
If there's one thing you should learn about me
Don't ever fucking doubt me
Don't ever fucking doubt me

Now you're gone with no traces
You might as well have been faceless
Exposed all your weakness
I'm getting back to my basics
The smoke is clear I'm seeing red
I won't stop fighting till I'm dead
When you look back and I'm still standing

Remember every time you doubt me
It makes me stronger than before
When you doubt me
It fuels the fire even more
So give me all you've got
I can't wait to watch you rot
If there's one thing you should learn about me
Don't ever fucking doubt me

Now you're stuck treading water in the ocean alone
Little late for apologies
How 'bout a rope and a stone?

I've let you take enough from me
I'm jumping ship to watch you sink
When you look back and I'm still standing

Remember every time you doubt me
It makes me stronger than before
When you doubt me
It fuels the fire even more
So give me all you've got
I can't wait to watch you rot
If there's one thing you should learn about me
Don't ever fucking doubt me
Don't ever fucking doubt me
Don't ever fucking doubt me
