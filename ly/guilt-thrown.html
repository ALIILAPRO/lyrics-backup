		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can’t forgive myself for the things I’ve done
It’s like every bad decision I’ve made
has led me to this point
Guess it’s all my fault
That I’ve grown into a man I hate
and now I’m all alone
Blame it on me
This excessive guilt is making me feel sick
And I can’t seem
To escape my own reality

Give me a break

I’ve had enough of all the fucking what-ifs
And constant overthinking
’Cause I’m about to lose my mind over some stupid shit
Trying so hard to accept
My mistakes, my regrets
Yet here I am with the same thoughts
Stuck in my head

So go ahead and blame it on me
I already do anyway
It’s just who I am

I’m unable to change
The way I think
A broken record of the same old things
I’ve tried to bury
And I know it doesn’t make any sense
But I can’t forgive what I can’t forget

‘Cause of the guilt that keeps on weighing me down
It’s like my (it’s like my)
Inner voice is telling me lies
So now I’m (so now I’m)
Fighting every feeling inside
Before I spiral down to where I wanna fucking die

Always ending up in the same place
Over and over again
Damn, I just can’t believe I am
Always ending up in the same place
Over and over a-

I wish I could forget all that I’ve done wrong
It’s like every bad decision I’ve made
has led me to this point
And now I’m all alone
Without knowing what to do or say
It’s hard to explain
But it’s so easy being hard on yourself when you’re not well
And to turn to self-blame
When it’s in your DNA

Blame it on me
This excessive guilt makes me feel sick
And I can’t fucking seem
To set myself free
