		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Could you, could you come tonight?
Instead of going under
Could you, could you come tonight?
Would you think it'd be her last December?

Could it be the way she combs her hair?
It must have been the day you lost to care
What if I was the answer to your prayer?
Yeah, you need a little candor, need a little candor

What if we last 'til it's dawn like you promised me?
Who let the boys spill their entree?
Dinner is served, can't you see we're not opposites?
Are you still up thinking of me?

I take all the blame
Is it hard to understand?
When it's all the same
I've played all the games
And lost almost everything
Now I talk to myself and it's quite surprising

Roll with me
Let's roll

Could you, could you come tonight?
I'm counting from the thunder
Could you, could you come tonight?
I got a feeling that you know the number

Could I be the best to jump ahead?
Your feet are hurting less with moccasins
I never heard another comment since
You need a little splendor, need a little splendor

What if we last 'til the dawn like you promised me?
Who let the boys spill their entree?
Dinner is served, can't you see we're not opposites?
Are you still up thinking of me?

I take all the blame
Is it hard to understand?
When it's all the same
I've played all the games
And lost almost everything
Now I talk to myself and it's quite surprising

Roll with me
Let's roll with me

Talk to myself and it's quite surprising
In the middle of the night
Roll
Now I talk to myself and it's quite surprising
In the middle of a fight
Roll

Can't you see the sign up on the wall?
In the middle of the night
Roll
Can't you see the sign up on the wall?
In the middle of a fight
I talk to myself and it's quite surprising

Roll with me
Let's roll with me

I wish I could be someone like you
Wish I would dare someone else, someone like you
Wish I would be with someone else, someone like you
Be someone else, someone else, someone like you
Oh how I wish I could be someone else, someone like you
Be someone else, someone else, someone like you
