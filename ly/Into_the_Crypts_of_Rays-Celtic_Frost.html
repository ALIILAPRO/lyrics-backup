		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Years of plead, behind the walls
Chambers and vaults, scenes of fright
Unspoken words, in pain and dread
140 lives passed his hands

Gilles De Ray's the perverted son
Holy man
Into the crypts of rays
Into the crypts of rays
Into the crypts of rays

Alluring children for his masses
Robbing and buying young souls
Sacrifice to morbid demons
Satisfy his repulsive sexual lust

Gilles De Ray's the perverted son
Holy man
Into the crypts of rays
Into the crypts of rays
Into the crypts of rays

So this is for the morbid one
The braveless and sick
Shivering laughter shrilled through the tombs
Sexual offense and perverted rites
Watching them limp and die
Wizards and darkness, Gilles' dreams
Halfway came true (came true)

As a late medieval's French Marshall
Unrestrained, with endless ambitions
Personal guard for Jeanne D'Arc
Rising of his soul to God

Gilles De Ray's the perverted son
Holy man
Into the crypts of rays
Into the crypts of rays
Into the crypts of rays

Overdone Mysticism and desperate Satanism
Are just one small step apart
There's no human scheme in the beyond

Gilles De Ray's the perverted son
The holy man
Into the crypts of rays
Into the crypts of rays
Into the crypts of rays
