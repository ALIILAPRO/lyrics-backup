		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This might be what I need
A wanting in between
I’m here and I’m feeling okay
I’m here and I’m trying

Turn to the stage
I’m not afraid
I’m built to be broken
Another way
I’m working it out
I’m an understated girl
When I get my sights on I’m an unstoppable kind

I’m looked on with disdain
How could I ever explain
How I conceded

This might be what I need
A wanting in between
I’m here and I’m feeling okay
I’m here and I’m trying

Turn to the stage
I’m not afraid
I’m built to be broken
Another way
I’m working it out
I’m an understated girl
When I get my sights on I’m an unstoppable kind
I’ve worked it all out
I’m an overbearing girl
How could I have let it fall and let it wash away?
Away
I’m not okay
With playing safe

I’m looked on with disdain
How could I ever explain
I can’t help but wonder
With that thought in my mind
Is this but a calling or
Or another mistake

Can I have another day?
Can you look the other way?
Tell me!
Am I enough?
Or am I deluded?

This might be what I need
A wanting in between
I’m here and I’m feeling okay
I’m here and I’m trying
