		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Even when I'm right I'm wrong again
Even in the light the shadows win
I know what it takes for you to win the war
Cursing at the face that stares behind the door

Living proof
You'll do what's best for you

Taken all I am for granted
Waken to a dream abandoned
The more we play the part
Will you let me fall apart

Even now I know you still deceive
Even now I try to make believe
Can you be the one that I am looking for
Hell is waiting patiently behind the door

Living proof
You'll do whatâ€™s best for you

Taken all I am for granted
Waken to a dream abandoned
The more we play the part
Will you let me fall apart

You don't even know me
Is there nothing sacred
Nothing sacred at all
You don't even know me

Will you let me fall apart

Taken all I am for granted
Waken to a dream abandoned
The more we play the part
Will you let me fall apart

You don't even know me
