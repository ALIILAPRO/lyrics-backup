		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If your gonna break my heart
I'm better off
I'm better off on my own
If your gonna break my heart
I'm better off
Better off alone, better off

Don't play with my feelings
Oh no not again, no
Only say it if you mean it
Only if you mean it
Don't play with my feelings
Oh no not again, no
Only say it if you mean it
Only if you mean it

If your gonna break my heart
I'm better off
I'm better off on my own
If your gonna break my heart
I'm better off
Better off alone, better off

I don't know if your love is free so
I don't want you to wait for me
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
I don't know if your love is free so
I don't want you to wait for me
Oh yeah, yeah

I been thinking about you
I been thinking about our love
I been thinking about you
I been thinking about our love
When my waist go round, round, round
Let my waist go round, round, round
When my waist go round, round, round
â€‹When my waist go up

If your gonna break my heart
I'm better off
I'm better off on my own
If your gonna break my heart
I'm better off
Better off alone, better off

I don't know if your love is free so
I don't want you to wait for me
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
I don't know if your love is free so
I don't want you to wait for me
Oh yeah, yeah

I'm done talking about it
We should do something about it
Done talking about it
We should do something about it
Done talking about it
We should do something about it
Done talking about it
We should do something about it
