		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ants are in the sugar, muscles atrophied
We're on the other side, the screen is us, and we're TV
Spread me open, sticking to my pointy ribs
Are all your infants in abortion cribs
I was born into this, everything turns to shit
The boy that you loved is the man that you fear

Pray until your number
Asleep from all your pain
Your apple has been rotting
Tomorrow's turned up dead

I have it all and I have no choice but to
I'll make everyone pay and you will see
You can kill yourself now, because you're dead in my mind
The boy that you loved is the monster you fear

Peel off all those eyes
Crawl into the dark
You've poisoned all of your children
To camouflage your scars

Pray unto the splinters
Pray unto your fear
Pray your life was just a dream
The cut that never heals

Pray now, baby
Pray your life was just a dream

I am so tangled in my sins that I cannot escape
I am so tangled in my sins that I cannot escape

Pinch the head off, collapse me like a weed
Someone had to go this far
I was born into this, everything turns to shit
The boy that you loved is the man that you fear

Peel off all those eyes
Crawl into the dark
You've poisoned all your children
To camouflage your scars

Pray unto the splinters
Pray unto your fear
Pray your life was just a dream
The cut that never heals

Pray now, baby
Pray your life was just a dream
The world in my hands
There's no one left to hear you scream
No one left for you

When all of your wishes are granted
Many of your dreams will be destroyed
