		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me, tell me
Something that I don't know already
'Cause baby, you can talk in circles for hours
Make a good day sour
Then you look me, look me
Straight into my eyes
Say that you're sorry
How could I not believe in you?
You said it was safe to do

We both know this happens every time, every time
You tell me a lie, I'll tell you five
Uh, which one of us today is gonna cry, gonna cry?
Back and forth, we're going at it, burning it alive

You're the only one
Who can boil my blood
And make that shit cut
'Cause you know that I'm always yours
I'm so in love
It's a punch to the gut
Could never be done
Still I'm always wanting more
You say that I'm a mess
Oh, just wait 'til I make it hurt
'Cause babe, last time I checked
The two of us were messier
Were messier

Oh, why'd you say that?
Can't believe you thought it's fine to say that
Couldn't care less for one second
Now you're all possessive
So I'm walking out, saying, "I'm so done"
And you're looking like a fool in the restaurant
You're running outside
You're pulling my arm
Not sure if my mom would call this love

You're the only one
Who can boil my blood
And make that shit cut
'Cause you know that I'm always yours
I'm so in love
It's a punch to the gut
Could never be done
Still I'm always wanting more
You say that I'm a mess
Oh, just wait 'til I make it hurt
'Cause babe, last time I checked
The two of us were messier
Were messier

We're too stuck in our pride
Say the worst 'cause I'm right
There's no one else I rather lie right to
We're too stuck in our pride
Say the worst 'cause I'm right
There's no one else, I might die for you

'Cause you're the only one
Who can boil my blood
And make that shit cut
'Cause you know that I'm always yours
I'm so in love
A punch to the gut
Could never be done
Still I'm always wanting more
You say that I'm a mess
Oh, just wait 'til I make it hurt
'Cause babe, last time I checked
The two of us were messier
Were messier
Were messier

We both know this happens every time, every time
You tell me a lie, I'll tell you five
