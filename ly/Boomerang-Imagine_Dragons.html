		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How many lies do we have to tell
To keep from saying that I wish you well?
How many times said I'm moving on?
How many times that false alarm goes off? (Goes off)
Goes off (goes off)
I know I'll see you tomorrow

'Cause I'm bad to letting you go, letting you go
Letting you go, letting you go
Moving on, moving on
Moving on, moving on
I'm ready to go, ready to go
Ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boomerang, boomerang

How many tears do we have to cry?
How many sleepless, lonely nights?
To work it up, is it worth enough?
Should we go ahead or should we turn around?
I know I'll see you tomorrow

'Cause I'm bad to letting you go, letting you go
Letting you go, letting you go
Moving on, moving on
Moving on, moving on
I'm ready to go, ready to go
Ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boomerang, boomerang

Just because it isn't easy it doesn't means that it's wrong
Everything that we've been working on
Working on so long

Ooh, ooh, ooh

You're my boomerang, boomerang (ooh)
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my booma-booma-rang-rang

Letting you go, letting you go (booma-rang-rang)
Letting you go, letting you go (booma-rang-rang)
Moving on, moving on (booma-rang-rang)
Moving on, moving on (booma-rang-rang)
Ready to go, ready to go (booma-rang-rang)
Ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boomerang, boomerang

Letting you go, letting you go (booma-rang-rang)
Letting you go, letting you go (booma-rang-rang)
Moving on, moving on (booma-rang-rang)
Moving on, moving on (booma-rang-rang)
Ready to go, ready to go (booma-rang-rang)
Ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boomerang, boomerang
