		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here we come, Kage, you ready?
Ready
Hold up, here we come
One, two-

Don't blow it, Kage, don't blow it, Kage
Just play the best shit you've ever fucking played
Don't blow it, Kage, don't blow it, Kage
Just play the best shit you've ever fucking played
Alright

Jack White invited us to party
He wanted us to kick out the jams
Red light, it's time for us to party
I'm hopin' we can kick out the jams

Don't blow it, Kage, don't blow it, Kage
Just play the best shit you've ever fucking played
Don't blow it, Kage, don't blow it, Kage
Just play the best shit you've ever fucking played
Solo

That sucked, you did not fucking party
You did not fucking kick out the jams
Jack White is drinking a Bacardi
You did not fucking kick out the jams

You blew it, Kage, you blew it, Kage
You played the worst shit you've ever fucking played
You blew it, Kage, you blew it, Kage
You played the worst shit you've ever fucking played
Come on

Kage, Kage
Yes, Jack White?
That was the best guitar solo I've ever heard in my life
What? Thank you
Do you wanna start a band with me right now?
Oh, yes
Let's do this

No, don't leave me, Kage, don't leave me, Kage
You played the best shit you've ever fucking played
Don't leave me, Kage, don't leave me, Kage
You played the best shit you've ever fucking played
You played the best shit you've ever fucking played
You played the best shit you've ever fucking played
You played the best shit you've ever fucking played
