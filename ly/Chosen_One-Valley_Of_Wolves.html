		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now I've never been the one to play it safe 
I might play a little dirty some days
And I'm following fate 
They say I'm the chosen one

I know what it takes to be the king 
Be the song everybody wanna sing 
Bring harmony 
Be the chosen one 

Hey
Ain’t nothin’ gonna stop this 
Ain’t nothin’ gonna stop this fire 

I was born to be 
Making history 
Something greater 
Something higher 
Ain’t nothing gonna stop this fire
It's plain reality 
I was born to be 
Something greater 
Something higher 
Ain’t nothing gonna stop this fire

Ain’t nothing gonna stop this 
This fire, this fire 
Ain’t nothing gonna stop this 
This fire, this fire

They told me I was never getting far 
But those words couldn't take to heart 
I know the day will come 
Be the chosen one 
I never had a safe place to hide 
I’m runnin’ to the end of the tunnel to find 
A train or the shining sun and be the chosen 

Ain’t nothing gonna stop this 
Ain’t nothing gonna stop this fire

I was born to be 
Making history 
Something greater 
Something higher 
Ain’t nothing gonna stop this fire
It's plain reality 
I was born to be 
Something greater 
Something higher 
Ain’t nothing gonna stop this fire

Ain’t nothing gonna stop this 
This fire, this fire 
Ain’t nothing gonna stop this 
This fire

I was born to be 
Making history 
Something greater 
Something higher 
Ain’t nothing gonna stop this fire
It's plain reality 
I was born to be 
Something greater 
Something higher 
Ain’t nothing gonna stop this fire

I was born to be 
Making history 
Something greater 
Something higher 
Ain’t nothing gonna stop this fire
It's plain reality 
I was born to be 
Something greater 
Something higher 
Ain’t nothing gonna stop this fire

This fire, this fire 
This fire 
Oh, I’m gonna burn right now yeah
Ain’t nothing gonna stop this fire
