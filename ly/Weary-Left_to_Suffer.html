		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know this life has taken everything from me 
Go 

Left behind me such a broken past 
I’ll do anything to numb the pain and make it last 
But we’re caught in the dark at the hands of the gods 
As we’re told to forget and we live in facade. 

And I’ll do anything to make the past feel real 
Conscious not to make a brand new deal 
Count down your days 
Just a taste of the price you’ll pay

(Just a taste of the price you’ll pay)

I feel so fucking numb again 
But I guess this where I will begin 

So go ahead and take a bite of my pain 
And drag me out to the point I can’t remember my fucking name 
I can’t take another day off this 
(And I feel so fucking sick so you)
Wait for me to call your name 
As if everything felt the same 
But you beg for forgiveness 
But my consciousness is fucking late 

So please make sure to count your days 
Cause there’s no one’s here comfort me 
But my feelings are still justified 
And wrapped up in everything you forgot 

I feel like giving into submission 
There’s something inside of me 

Let’s take it from start 
Introspective with a broken heart 
Where am I? I’m lost in the fucking dark 
We have to find the middle ground 
Or we’ll never find our way back around 

Constantly in my head there’s no easy way out 
But I’m not the person to collect when I’m down 

And I’ll do anything to make the past feel real 
Conscious not to make a brand new deal 
Count down your days 
Just a taste of the price you’ll pay
We never conceded to doubt 
And thinking for yourself has it ever been aloud? 
I look silence the screams 
Cast by the ones embedded in dreams
