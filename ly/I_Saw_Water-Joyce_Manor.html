		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, was anybody here really sad that Tigers Jaw couldn't make this show?
I was too, I'm a huge Tigers Jaw fan
So uh, yeah, this one's called I Saw Water

And I saw water
I said I wanted to break my friends
But my dependency won't let me away
I'd like to think that I could work it out some
But I want to be put into the ground

Today I needed a break
My friends are up in mountains and I'm drowning in lakes
I swallowed water right in front of her face
Just to show that she had nothing to say

And I felt lighter
I impressed her

When my emotions ran unopposed
I felt just like Brian Jones
I never felt that lost before
I just don't feel incredible

But me, well of course I liked you
Have time for me, I don't expect you to
I see me become a recluse
It's very easy to seclude

And I saw water
I felt better

I woke up feeling embarrassed from
When I drowned in my swimming pool
And thought it was an accident
And I just can't get along with you

But me, well of course I liked you
But me, well of course I liked you
But me, well of course I liked you
But me, well of course I liked you
