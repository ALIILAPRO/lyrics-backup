		  (Go 'head, O)
(Danny, I see you) ayy

Left, right, left, right
I'm the reason why yo' nigga left, right? He left, right?
I told him, you my bitch, he took a step right, step right
He know that I'm that nigga, so he left, yeah, he left, yeah
He dead right, he dead right
B.B. Simon on my waist dancin', yeah, I'm a star
And I step up in the party, everybody goin' wild
And my patience made my talent, yeah, I know it took a while
Yeah, I been doin' this rapping shit, lil' bitch I did it all, yeah

Yeah, she goin', she goin', she goin' for it all
I don't ask her what she wanna' do, I know she with it all
Bitch, I'm feelin' like LaMelo, all I wanna do is ball
And you wanna talk to me, all you gotta' do is call, yeah

Left, right, left, right
I'm the reason why yo' nigga left, right? He left, right?
I told him, you my bitch, he took a step right, step right
He know that I'm that nigga, so he left, yeah, he left, yeah
He dead right, he dead right
B.B. Simon on my waist dancin', yeah, I'm a star
And I step up in the party, everybody goin' wild, yeah
And my patience made my talent, yeah, I know it took a while
Yeah, I been doin' this rapping shit, lil' bitch I did it all, yeah

Black, white, black, white, whatchu want? Yeah
You can get that TEC nigga, you can get that punch, yeah
Ray gun like Call of Duty, you get hit you done, yeah
One life, one phone call, right before lunch
You don't know me, you just know what I have done, yeah
You don't know where I'm from, you don't know where I was goin'
There's some niggas that can't leave they house without bringin' the gun
But my fans got me right, know where I belong, yeah

Left, right, left, right
I'm the reason why yo' nigga left, right? He left, right?
I told him, you my bitch, he took a step right, step right
He know that I'm that nigga, so he left, yeah, he left, yeah
He dead right, he dead right
B.B. Simon on my waist dancin', yeah, I'm a star
And I step up in the party, everybody goin' wild
And my patience made my talent, yeah, I know it took a while
Yeah, I been doin' this rapping shit, lil' bitch I did it all, yeah

Waist dancin'

Everybody goin' wild, yeah
Callin' my phone, yeah

Left, right, left, right
I'm the reason why yo' nigga left, right? He left, right?
I told him, you my bitch, he took a step right, step right
He know that I'm that nigga, so he left, yeah, he left, yeah
He dead right, he dead right
