		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What we finally found wasn't what we wanted
Wish I could have gone to where we started

Back to black I can't see what's around me
Back to black hope to gain some control

I gave up everything

I tried to have it all and I'm stuck in the middle
I couldn't have it all now I'm alone
And I've been down and out
Now I'm stuck in the middle (stuck in the middle)
I'll never get to say this is enough

Now I'm left with nothing
Now I'm left with nothing
Now I'm left with nothing now

I gotta take some time
To get this out of my way
No matter how I tried to fight it, nothings changes

Back to black I can't see what's around me
Back to black hope to gain some control

I tried to have it all and I'm stuck in the middle (stuck in the middle)
I couldn't have it all I'm alone now
And I've been down and out, now I'm stuck in the middle (stuck in the middle)
I'll never get to say this is enough

(Stuck in the middle, stuck in the middle)

Now I'm left with nothing now

Now I'm left with nothing
Now I'm left with nothing
Now I'm left with nothing
Now I'm left with nothing

I gave up everything

I tried to have it all and I'm stuck in the middle (stuck in the middle)
I couldn't have it all now I'm alone
And I've been down and out, now I'm stuck in the middle (stuck in the middle)
I'll never get to say this is enough

Now I'm left with nothing, now I'm left with nothing
Now I'm left with nothing, yeah

Now I'm left with nothing, now I'm left with nothing
Now I'm left with nothing, now I'm left with nothing
