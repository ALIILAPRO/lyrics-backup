		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was a Monday
A day like any other day
I left a small town
For the apple in decay
It was my destiny
It's what we needed to do
They were telling me
I'm telling you

I was inside looking outside
The millions of faces
But still I'm alone
Waiting, hours of waiting
Paying a penance
I was longing for home
I'm looking out for the two of us
I hope we'll be here
When they're through with us

I was inside looking outside
Oh the millions of faces
But still I'm alone
Waiting, hours of waiting
I could feel the tension
I was longing for home
I'm looking out for the two of us
And I hope we'll be here
When they're through with us
I'm a long way from home

Monday, sad, sad Monday
She's waiting for me
But I'm a long long way from home
Sad, sad Monday
She's waiting for me
But I'm a long long way from home
Sad, sad Monday
Ah she's waiting for me
But I'm a long, long way from home
