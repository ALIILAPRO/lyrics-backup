		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Even when I'm looking you right in the eye
Feels like we're not seeing things eye to eye
I won't go as far as to say I regret it
Maybe I'm just too afraid to admit it
Nevertheless, I lose myself sometimes
I'm telling you, I've only had eyes for you
Love isn't something you can just fall into
Don't you remember the life that we grew
I know I promised that I'd see it through
Nevertheless, I find it hard sometimes
I'm sorry I won't always be enough
Sometimes it might feel like we're not in love
You're still the one I want to be tethered to
Isn't it enough that I want to
Trust me when I say that we'll be alright
I know it's not right, but it's easy to be resigned
I don't wanna say that it is what it is
There will be days when we wanna give in
Nevertheless, I will be yours for life
I'm sorry I won't always be enough
Sometimes it might feel like we're not in love
You're still the one I want to be tethered to
Isn't it enough that I want to
One day when our time is finally up
You'll be who I always knew you'd become
And I'll be glad that we never gave up on us
I'm sorry I won't always be enough
Sometimes it might feel like we're not in love
You're still the one I want to be tethered to
Isn't it enough that I want to
I'm sorry I won't always understand you
After all the layers that I've tried to peel through
Even when I don't get you, I still got you
Isn't it enough that I want to
I hope it's enough that I want you
