		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Right on time, I see you're getting restless
Don't mean to criticize but what did you expect?
Sitting here in constant conversation
Just means you're desperate and you'll take what you can get

Oh, I don't know and I'll never let go
But I won't go down that road again
Oh, I don't know and I'll never let go
But I won't go down that road again

Spent my whole life waiting for the punchline
I hate to tell you but I never got the joke
Crash my car in transcendental sunshine
Don't need the oxygen, I know I'm going to choke

Oh, I don't know and I'll never let go
But I won't go down that road again
Oh, I don't know and I'll never let go
But I won't go down that road again
Don't let go

When you ask for the keys to your life
Don't be so surprised by what you might find

Don't let go, don't let go
Don't let go, don't let go

Oh, I don't know and I'll never let go
But I won't go down that road again
Oh, I don't know and I'll never let go
But I won't go down that road again

Don't let go
Don't let go
Don't let go
