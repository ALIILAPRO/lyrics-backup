		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, I thought I put you away
Put you to the side 
Thought you wouldn't wanna stay 
You still hit my line
Wonder what's it gonna take 
Seem to me just like you don't really know your place

You still can't let go
You still can't let go
You still can't let go
You still can't let go

Hey
You in love but it's all your head 
It ain't really what you telling your friends 
I see everything and leave it on read 
This right here far as you gonna get 
I see what you tryna do to impress
You don't get it you won't give it a rest
Tryna get you out the way 
You got me stuck in your mind 
I think you stuck in your ways
You don't want me you in love with the chase 
I don't want no part of running the race 
had to leave just cause I needed my space though
I might lie and say I ain't in town when I'm back home
You don't understand that I would rather be on my own 
You might make me take you're number right out my phone
Swore to you I'll never change my mind this what I chose 

Hey, I thought I put you away
Put you to the side 
Thought you wouldn't wanna stay 
You still hit my line
Wonder what's it gonna take 
Seem to me just like you don't really know your place

You still can't let go
You still can't let go
You still can't let go
You still can't let go

You still can't let go
You still can't let go
You still can't let go
You still can't let go
