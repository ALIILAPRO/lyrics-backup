		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's ok to be ok
You ain't gotta knock Heaven out everyday
Listen what the old folks say It's ok to be ok

Last night I laid my money down At the only game that came to town
I had enough left over for a couple rounds Oh I didn't win big but I found out

It's ok to be ok
You ain't gotta knock Heaven out everyday
Listen what the old folks say It's ok to be ok

Me and my baby had a little spat
But we're slowly getting back on track She ain't too happy but she ain't too sad
Somewhere in the middle is where we're at

Kinda like the forest for the trees
When the sky ain't blue but the grass is green Girl that sounds like you and me
 

But baby it's alright we can disagree

It's ok to be ok
You aint gotta knock Heaven out everyday
Listen what the old folks say It's ok to be ok

One step ahead two steps behind
Just remember God won't make a mountain Way to high to climb

It's ok to be ok
You ain't gotta knock Heaven out everyday
Listen what the old folks say It's ok to be ok

Listen what the old folks say It's ok to be ok
