		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Originally recorded by Holocaust)

Look out at the darkness, and you will see
Just call my name and I'll be there
You cannot touch me, you would not dare
I am the chill that's in the air

And I try to get through to you, in my own special way
As the barriers crumble, at the end of the day, a-ha

Dark rivers are flowing, back into the past
You are the fish for which I cast
And what of the future, what is to be
As the rivers flow into the sea

And I try to get through to you, in my own special way
As the barriers crumble, at the end of the day

Do not take for granted, powers out there
Don't step into the demon's lair
Time is an illusion, rising from time
Steep is the mountain which we climb

And I try to get through to you, in my own special way
As the barriers crumble, at the end of the day
