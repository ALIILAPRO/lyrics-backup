		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me let you in on a secret
How to treat a woman right
If you're lookin' for a place in her heart
It ain't gonna happen overnight

First you gotta learn to listen
To understand her deepest thoughts
She needs to know you can be friends
Before she'll give you all she's got

If you start from the heart
You'll see love is gonna play it's part

If you want to get to know her
Really get inside her mind
If you want to move in closer
Take it slow, yeah take your time
You must start from the heart and then
If you want to touch her
Really want to touch her
If you want to touch her, ask

A little physical attraction
Romantic, old-fashioned charm
And a lot of love and tenderness
Is gonna get you into her arms

If you start from the heart
You'll see love is gonna play it's part

If you want to get to know her
Really get inside her mind
If you want to move in closer
Take it slow, yeah take your time
You must start from the heart and then
If you want to touch her
Really want to touch her
If you want to touch her, ask

Let me let you in on a secret
How to treat a woman right
If you're lookin' for a place in her heart
It ain't gonna happen no it ain't gonna happen

If you want to get to know her
Really get inside her mind
If you want to move in closer
Take it slow, yeah take your time
If you want to get to know her
Really get inside her mind
If you want to move in closer
Take it slow, yeah take your time

If you start from the heart
You'll see love is gonna play it's part
If you want to touch her
Really want to touch her
If you want to touch her, ask
