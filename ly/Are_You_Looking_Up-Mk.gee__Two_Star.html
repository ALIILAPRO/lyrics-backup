		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Riley just waits on
Somebody to give her new light
With the heaviest weight on
A miracle to cut me slack

So are you looking up? Are you asking why?
'Cause if you wanna go then, baby, go wild
Yeah, I can shift shapes but I can't deny
Baby, we can put it all to rest just for one night

What's keeping you fenced off
And who's got the power in your mind?
How're you gonna waste it all
When somebody's playing to no one every night?

So are you looking up? Are you asking why?
'Cause if you wanna go then, baby, go wild
I can shift shapes but I can't deny
Yeah, we can put it all to rest just for one night

So are you looking up? Are you asking why?
'Cause if you wanna go then, baby, go wild
Are you looking for somebody to put out your fire?
We can put it all to rest just for one night

So are you looking up? Are you asking why?
If you wanna go then, baby, go wild
Baby, I can shift shapes but I can't deny
