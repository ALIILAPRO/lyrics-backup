		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh, yeah

I've been lookin' so long for you now
You won't get away from my grasp
You've been living so long in hiding, in hiding
Behind that false mask
And you know that I know that
You ain't got long now to last
Your looks and your feelings
Are just the remains of your past

You're standing in the wings
There you wait, for the curtain to fall
But knowing the terror and holding
You have on us all
Yeah, I know that you're gonna
Scratch me and maim me and maul
And you know I'm helpless from
Your mesmerizing catcall

Ooh

Keep your distance, walk away
Don't take his bait
Don't you stray, don't fade away
Watch your step, he's out to get you
Come what may
Don't you stray, from the narrow way

I'm running and hiding 
In my dreams, you're always there
You're the phantom of the opera
You're the devil, you're just out to scare
You damaged my mind and my soul
It just floats through the air
You haunt me, you taunt me
You torture me back at your lair

(Torture me back at your lair)
