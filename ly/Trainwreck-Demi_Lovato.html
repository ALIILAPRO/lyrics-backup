		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah,

If love were medication 'cause it only causes pain,
You won't go to the doctor cause his calling you insane,
Your lost even when your going the right way,
You mean the world to me even though you might be crazy,
And you said we wouldn't make it, but look how far we've come,
For so long my heart was breaking,
But now we're standing strong,
The things you say, made me fall harder each day.
Your a train wreck, but I wouldn't love you if you changed.

Yeah

I shook your hand and you pulled it right away,
Yeah,
You asked me to dance, instead I said no way.
Inside I was dying, to give it a try, you beg me so I stay.
I knew you were different from the way I caved;

And you said we wouldn't make it,
But look how far we've come,
For so long my heart was breaking,
But now we're standing strong,
The things you say you make me fall harder each day,
You're a trainwreck,
But I wouldn't love you if you changed!
Yeah! Oh yeah! Oh! Oh yeah!

We are so different,
But opposites attract,
So my hope kept growing,
And that I never looked back,
You're one of a kind!
No one can change this heart of mine.
Oh!

And you said we wouldn't make it,
But look how far we've come,
For so long my heart was breaking,
But now we're standing strong,
The things you say you make me fall harder each day,
You're a trainwreck,
But I wouldn't love you if you changed!
Yeah! Oh yeah! Oh! Oh yeah!

One more thing I thought I'd share with something special,
I'm falling like I've never fell before,
It's funny you said we'd never make it, and but look how far we've come,
You're a train wreck,
But with you, I'm in love.
