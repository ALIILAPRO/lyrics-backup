		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can see the light in your eyes
And it keeps on pulling me in
But my hearts a disguise
Only beats to get rid of my sins
I've done things that I don't like
Don't wanna do it over again
On this path, I might die
Unless you help me fight all my fears
(Fears, fear, fears)
In the night time, I come alive
Give you something that you won't find
Take a pill with me take you sky high
Make you feel fine
Baby make you feel fine
I'm in my head again
While she's lying in my bed
This is not comforting
I'm a mess but we do it all again
She love when I take control (take control)
Yeah it's the drugs that she feeling though (feeling though)
She's coming down she needs a little more (little more)
She wanna feel like she's invincible
Don't think, touch me, kiss me
Fuck me, make love, do bad things
Trust me, don't lie, don't fix me
I know that it's tempting
Why don't you resent me
In the night time, I come alive
Give you something that you won't find
Take a pill with me take you sky high
Make you feel fine
Baby make you feel fine
I'm in my head again
While she's lying in my bed
This is not comforting
I'm a mess but we do it all again
Do it all again yeah
Do it all again yeah
Do it all again yeah
Oh, oh, oh
I know that you'll ride for me
Baby imma set you free yeah
All this animosity
Never fall in love with me
Hands on your body, I'm exploring every part
Don't ask me to hold on cause ill tear that shit apart
(Apart, apart, apart)
In the night time (in the night time) I come alive (come alive)
Give you something that you won't find (that you won't find)
Take a pill with me take you sky high (take you sky high)
Make you feel fine
Baby make you feel fine (fine)
I'm in my head again (again)
While she's lying in my bed (in my bed)
This is not comforting
I'm a mess but we do it all again
Do it all again yeah (do it all again)
Do it all again yeah (do it all again)
Do it all again yeah (oh oh)
Do it all again yeah
Do it all again yeah
Do it all again yeah
Do it all again yeah
Do it all again yeah
