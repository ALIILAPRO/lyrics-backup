		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Standin' on the corner, I could listen to the radio
When the savior sang from the fire escape on the second floor
You were always saying we would make it to the catacombs
In the end, it came when you wrote my name on the bathroom stall

If the photograph doesn't bring you back
If the final chapter isn't ever after
Ooh

I remember wakin' up the neighbor like a stadium
Yeah, you ran upstairs, screamin' no one cared and the band played on
Even in the limo, you were feelin' like an animal
At the traffic light, when you blew your mind on a mobile phone?

Day and night, my love
You said the blood was on my hands

Long, as you run
I couldn't give you up
Forever run
I couldn't give you up

In the minivan, with your headphones in
Did you write your letters to your shitty friends?
And all this time, you said to me
"My love would never die"

Long, as you run
I couldn't give you up
Forever run
I couldn't give you up (and the daylight in my hand)
Long, as you run (and the silence on the street)
I couldn't give you up (and the long light in my hand)
Forever run (and I was incomplete)
I couldn't give you up (and the daylight in my hand)
Long, as you run (and the silence on the street)
I couldn't give you up (and the long light in my hand)
Gone, don't look back (and I was incomplete)
I couldn't give you up
