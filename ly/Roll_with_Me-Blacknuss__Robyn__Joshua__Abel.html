		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No Doubt on the real son
Yeah yeah, yeah
Nam sayin'? Josh, Abel, Robyn
No doubt yeah, yeah, yeah
Doin’ it like this no doubt

I'm on my way out tonight
The time and the mood is right
The streets are packed
Hmm what a lovely sight
Buy my sneakers on the way
My jacket 'cause it’s hot today
Mom just don't stay up, I will be late
At last, I am free
Gonna have some fun tonight
And all of my friends are with me
So it's gonna be alright
(It's gonna be alright)
Heading to the spot with a smile on my face
And smiles don't come easy these days

But I'm going to rock (yeah)
And I'm going to do it all night long
I ain't gonna stop (no)
Until the early morning
If you don’t know what I mean
Come on and roll with me (roll with me)
Tonight nothing can go wrong
We’ll stay out all night long
(all night long)

Everybody's looking for a break or open door
A single chance to get away
School and the week is stress party on the
Let the good times roll until
The break of day at last, I am free
Gonna have some fun tonight
And all of my friends are with me
So it’s gonna be alright
(it's gonna be alright) someone was downtown
Where there's nice and funky sound
So tell all your friends to come around

'Cause I’m going to rock, yeah
And I'm going to do it all night long
I ain't gonna stop (no)
Until the early morning
If you don't know what I mean
Come on and roll with me (roll with me)
Tonight nothing can go wrong
We'll stay out all night long
(all night long)

Yeah, yeah, no doubt uh, aiight
Roll with me (yeah, yeah) bluehill baby

Yo, I see that it's party
I'm chillin' with my friends
Moonshine in my face, it all makes sense
The sun sets, now replaced by us
Yo, it's happiness baby, no need for no fuss
The summer fest got be blessed
I'm relieved from all distress
I'm chillin' at the party with my people from
The sight that I see is so heavenly
So come on baby boo and roll with me

And I'm going to rock (yeah)
And I'm going to do it all night long
I ain't gonna stop (no)
Until the early morning
If you don't know what I mean
Come on and roll with me (roll with me)
Tonight nothing can go wrong
We'll stay out all night long
(all night long)
