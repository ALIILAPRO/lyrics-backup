		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time is nothing but life's decay
Pitch your reverend path
This is the path you paved
What you will find

Is life's only way
There's no looking back
There must be a better way

Lightning skies
Prayers from an open grave
A dead man's eyes
Must be a dead man's day

What you will find
Is life's only way
There's no looking back
Back to a better way

Lightning skies
Prayers from an open grave
A dead man's eyes
Must be a dead man's day
That leads to one man's fate
There ain't no better way to die

Fate, there's no compromise
Hate leads to suicide
Trapped in a crystal haze
Hail to a dead man's day

Time is but a passageway
Trying to believe
Your life was sanity
A matter of time
Is all that you need
Life's not coming back
Back to those better days

Lightning skies
Prayers from an open grave
A dead man's eyes
Must be a dead man's day
