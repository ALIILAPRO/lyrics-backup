		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This world is not my home I'm just a passing through
My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue
The angels beckon me from heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore
Oh lord you know I have no friend like you
If heaven's not my home then lord what will I do
The angels beckon me from heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore

I have a loving mother just over in gloryland
And I don't expect to stop until I shake her hand
She's waiting now for me in heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore
Oh lord you know I have no friend like you
If heaven's not my home Then lord what will I do

The angels beckon me From heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home In this world anymore

Just over in gloryland
We'll live eternally
The saints on every hand are shouting victory

Their songs of sweetest praise
Drift back from heaven's shore
And I can't feel at home In this world anymore

Oh lord, you know I have no friend like you
If heaven's not my home Then lord what will I do

The angels beckon me From heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home In this world anymore
