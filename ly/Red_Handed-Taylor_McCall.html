		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  HOTEL KEYS AND CIGARETTES 
I DON'T BUY NO MARLBORO REDS 
FOUND EM LYING UNDERNEATH YOUR DRESSER 
CHEAP COLOGNE AND EVERCLEAR  
YOU CAN'T HIDE THE TRUTH MY DEAR
 I'M NO PRIEST BUT I'LL BE YOUR CONFESSOR 

YOU GOT A MONKEY ON YOUR BACK 
BLACK CAT GOT YOUR TONGUE 
ELEPHANT IN THE LIVING ROOM 
BEATING ON A WARNING DRUM 
WHEN YOU CUT THAT GRASS 
SNAKES ARE GONNA UP AND RUN 
SLIP OUT THE BACK AND TRY TO ACT 
LIKE THE LORD WAS NEVER GONNA COME

SOMETHING DIFFERENT ON YOUR KISS 
 DIDN'T USED TO TASTE LIKE THIS 
BARELY SHY OF CATCHING YOU RED HANDED 
SLEEPING DOGS ARE GONNA LIE
 BABY I JUST CAN'T ABIDE 
THE WAY THAT YOU'VE BEEN TAKEN ME FOR GRANTED

YOU GOT A MONKEY ON YOUR BACK 
BLACK CAT GOT YOUR TONGUE 
ELEPHANT IN THE LIVING ROOM 
BEATING ON A WARNING DRUM 
WHEN YOU CUT THAT GRASS 
SNAKES ARE GONNA UP AND RUN 
SLIP OUT THE BACK AND TRY TO ACT 
LIKE THE LORD WAS NEVER GONNA COME

I'M THE MONKEY ON YOUR BACK 
BLACK CAT GOT YOUR TONGUE 
ELEPHANT IN THE LIVING ROOM 
BEATING ON A WARNING DRUM 
WHEN YOU CUT THAT GRASS 
SNAKES ARE GONNA UP AND RUN 
SLIP OUT THE BACK AND TRY TO ACT
