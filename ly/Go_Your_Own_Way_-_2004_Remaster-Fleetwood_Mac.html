		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Loving you
Isn't the right thing to do
But how can I ever change things
That I feel?

If I could
Maybe I'd give you my world
How can I
When you won't take it from me?

You can go your own way
(Go your own way)
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way
(Go your own way)

Tell me why
Everything turned around
Packing up
Shacking up's all you wanna do

If I could
Baby, I'd give you my world
Open up
Everything's waiting for you

You can go your own way
(Go your own way)
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way
(Go your own way)

You can go your own way
(Go your own way)
You can call it another lonely day
(Another lonely day)
You can go your own way
(Go your own way)
You can call it another lonely day

You can go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way
