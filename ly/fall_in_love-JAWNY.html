		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every single day as I'm waking up
The in between time when I'm missing your touch
Seven months in like a bad start-up
I think it's time that I get over it
I left my heart and my wallet
So if you see my name that's why I'm calling
Sent a sober text even when I'm drunk
Oh no

And every day is moving on
But I can't tell myself
That I don't love you anymore
And if it's love, then you let her go
Oh

She goes 'round my head like a cop car
Handcuffs on my heart, I'm a prisoner
Fall in love
I don't wanna fall in love
She goes 'round my head like a merry-go-round
I hate the fact that she'll never know
Fall in love
I don't wanna fall in love

Every single day as I'm waking up
Looking at the side of the bed that you took
Seven months in like a bad start-up, oh
I left my heart and my wallet
So if you see my name that's why I'm calling
Sent a sober text even when I'm drunk
Oh no

And every day is moving on
But I can't tell myself
That I don't love you anymore
And if it's love, then you let her go

She goes 'round my head like a cop car
Handcuffs on my heart, I'm a prisoner
Fall in love
I don't wanna fall in love
She goes 'round my head like a merry-go-round
I hate the fact that she'll never know
Fall in love
I don't wanna fall in love

So if I don't love you anymore
And if it's love, then you let her go

She goes 'round my head like a cop car
Handcuffs on my heart, I'm a prisoner
Fall in love
I don't wanna fall in love, oh

If you see my name that's why I'm calling
Sent a sober text even when I'm drunk (I'm drunk)
Oh no (oh no)
