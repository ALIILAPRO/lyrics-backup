		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let the sparks fly

There's no such thing as maybe,
Burn it like you fading,
No more hesitating
Let the sparks fly baby;
Drive it like your racing,
You can call me crazy,
I'm just tired of waiting,
Let the sparks fly baby.

Give me one if it's real
And two if you can feel it,
Give me three signs that you're awake,
It only takes one spark
For two to fall apart
And three more to blow it away

Give me one if it's real
And two if you can feel it,
Give me three signs that you're awake,
It only takes one spark
For two to fall apart
And three more to blow it away

Let me take you into the light,
There's nowhere to hide,
There's nothing but darkness left here
Shake it up and let's take a ride
'cause heaven's not far away
And I'm not gonna leave you here.

There's no such thing as maybe,
Burn it like you fading,
No more hesitating
Let the sparks fly baby;
Drive it like your racing,
You can call me crazy,
I'm just tired of waiting,
Let the sparks fly baby.

Give me one good reason
Two more to believe in
Three shots and watch your weight
'cause I got one more match,
Two strikes left
You got to three to get out of my way

Give me one if it's real
And two if you can feel it,
Give me three signs that you're awake,
It only takes one spark
For two to fall apart
And three more to blow it away

Let me take you into the light,
There's nowhere to hide,
There's nothing but darkness left here
Shake it up and let's take a ride
'cause heaven's not far away
And I'm not gonna leave you here.

There's no such thing as maybe,
Burn it like you fading,
No more hesitating
Let the sparks fly baby;
Drive it like your racing,
You can call me crazy,
I'm just tired of waiting,
Let the sparks fly baby.

Let me take you into the light,
There's nowhere to hide,
There's nothing but darkness left here
Shake it up and let's take a ride
'cause heaven's not far away
And I'm not gonna leave you here.

Let me take you into the light,
There's nowhere to hide,
There's nothing but darkness left here
Shake it up and let's take a ride
'cause heaven's not far away
And I'm not gonna leave you here.

Let me take you into the light,
There's nowhere to hide,
There's nothing but darkness left here
Shake it up and let's take a ride
'cause heaven's not far away
And I'm not gonna leave you here.

There's no such thing as maybe,
Burn it like you fading,
No more hesitating
Let the sparks fly baby;
Drive it like your racing,
You can call me crazy,
I'm just tired of waiting,
Let the sparks fly baby.
