		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ay
I was just microdosing you

Microdosing
I was just microdosing you
Microdosing
I was just microdosing you

You're so afraid to
Damage your image
Ask forgiveness 
Not for permission
You can't erase what's already written

Baby did you forget the meaning, meaning, meaning?

I wanna be your everything
'Cause I don't wanna leave you with nothing
I wanna be your everything
'Cause I don't wanna leave you with nothing

Microdosing
I was just microdosing you
Microdosing
I was just microdosing you

Just one hey, we went hey wire
Horns they stick out your halo
Get in your head sentimental
It's bye but can't see you later

Oh, oh, oh live in the present
There's magic in what you say oh
Yeah yeah, And I'm doing what I said oh
There's too much bags for me to settle

Oh, oh, oh I just want a little
Oh, oh, oh I just want a little
Oh, oh, oh I just want a little
Oh, oh, I just want a little

I was just microdosing you
Microdosing
I was just microdosing you
Microdosing
I was just microdosing you

Baby did you forget the meaning, meaning, meaning?

I wanna be your everything
'Cause I don't wanna leave you with nothing
I wanna be your everything
'Cause I don't wanna leave you with nothing
