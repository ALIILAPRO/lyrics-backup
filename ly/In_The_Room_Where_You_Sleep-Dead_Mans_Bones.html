		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw something
Sitting on your bed
I saw something
Touching your head
In the room
Where you sleep
In the room
Where you sleep
Where you sleep

You better run
You better run
You better hide
You better hide
You better run

I saw something
Sitting on your bed
I saw something
Touching your head
In the room
Where you sleep
In the room
Where you sleep
Where you sleep
Where you sleep
Where you sleep

You better run
You better run
You better hide
You better hide
You better run

(There's something in the shadows
In the corner of your room
A dark heart is beating
And waiting for you
There is no open window, but the floors still creep
In the room where you sleep
In the room where you sleep)
Where you sleep

You better run
You better run
You better hide!
You better hide!
Oh, you better, run
