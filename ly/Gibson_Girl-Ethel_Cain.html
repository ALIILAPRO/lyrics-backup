		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You wanna love me right now
You wanna get along with me
You wanna get my clothes off and hurt me
You came alone to me
From however far away
Asking me to know how I know 
You're always sad

Black leather and dark glasses 
Pour in another while I shake my ass
It's cold blooded, so it takes more time to bleed
Obsession with the money, addicted to the drugs
Says he's in love with my body
That's why he's fucking it up
And then he says to me

"Baby, if it feels good, then it can't be bad"
Well, I can be immoral in a stranger's lap
And if you want it good, down right iconic
Something they all want that only you can have

You wanna fuck me right now
You wanna see me on my knees
You wanna rip these clothes off and hurt me
And if you hate me
Please don't tell me
Just let the lights bleed all over me

And if it feels good (good), then it can't be bad 
Well, I can be immoral in a stranger's lap
And if you want it good, down right iconic
Then I would show you something (something) that you wish you had

And if it feels good (good), then it can't be bad 
Well, I can be immoral in a stranger's lap
And if you want it good, down right iconic
Then I would show you something (something) that you wish you had

You wanna love me right now
You wanna love me right now
You wanna fuck me right now
You wanna-, ooh, ooh, ooh
You wanna love me right now
You wanna love me right now
You wanna fuck me, fuck me
You wanna love me, love me
