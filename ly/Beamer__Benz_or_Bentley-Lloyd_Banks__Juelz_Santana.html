		  Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
My jeans are never empty bitch
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
This scheming don't affect me

I'm fresh I'm fly, I'm so damn high
More than five hundred horses when I roll by
I'm calm I'm cool, everything brand new
I don't hand cuff you can get the whole damn crew

Get in my Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beat it I bet she let me
She been fiending since she met me
I'm the coolest shit especially
When I throw on all my Gretzky
Got my sm-sm-smith and Wessie
To protect me so respect me
This is heavy new Bentley
Color vanilla and cherry
Andretti-O Pirelli
Make a movie out the getty
Where my ring and my confetti
I'm Kobe Bryant ready
Pink Rose and chronic smelly
While I'm stumbling out the telly
I'm so fly I'm so ferry
And the way I flow is very
Ginsu or machete,
Way my pencil move is deadly
Platinum band platinum bezzie
Make a straight girl out of lezzie
Magazine mac bezzie
Keep my windows like the prezzie
Press a button than I'm stuntin'
My roof look like its duckin
Meter go two hundred something
And my trunk do wonders bumpin'
I am not the one for jumpin'
I will ratchet out and stump him
Dump him, nigga you better off dead,
Ya money red

I'm fresh I'm fly, I'm always high
Got ya bitch waving at me when I roll by
I'm calm I'm cool everything brand new
I don't handcuff you can get the whole damn crew

Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
My jeans are never empty bitch
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
This scheming don't affect me

Whether Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
I be movin' I be movin'
Making movies Tom Cruisin'
If its action than I'm shootin'
Pockets fat, necks studded
Boy my nick name should be Ruben
My Colombian connect told me the Mexicans have moved in
And he know just how I get it so we bout to introduce him
Got a girl named cigar called her that because she Cuban
Got a black chick that be boosting
Got a white girl that be boofin'
Gotta watch her cause she use it
But she fuck me like she stupid
And she always ready
To give me that Becky
Last time it was so good I almost crashed my Bentley
Hit the club, order bottles see them sparks in the sky
Will have this whole bitch lookin' like the fourth of July
But if you pussy's get to frontin' and the pushing lead to shoving
We just bussin' and we leaving like its nothin'
If it ain't the Gucci or the Louie than its Polo or its Rugby
And this bitch I brought with me she be baggin' bitches for me

Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
My jeans are never empty bitch
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
This scheming don't affect me

I'm fresh I'm fly, I'm always high
Got ya bitch waving at me when I roll by
I'm calm I'm cool everything brand new
I don't handcuff you can get the whole damn crew

I got a girl named Kima
And Kima like Christina
Baby three don't make a crowd
It make a sex scene meaner
I just wanna get between her
Turn it over scream her
Than its one, two, and I'm through, see ya
I scoop her in my
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
My jeans are never empty bitch
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
This scheming don't affect me
