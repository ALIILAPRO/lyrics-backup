		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The writing's on the wall
There's nothing I could change or undo
But I will be there
Beside you when it rains
Beside you when it storms
Keeping you safe
So don't you ever lose your

Faith, trust that I will stay
I'll always be there
Faith, know that I have changed
I'm never leaving

It's time to face the world
To step outside the shade
To be loved
Wherever you are
I'll find your smile again
It'll lighten up your days
I'll never give in
So don't you ever lose your

Faith, trust that I will stay
I'll always be there
Faith, know that I have changed
I'm never leaving

(Always)
(Always)
(Always)

Look into my eyes
Deep into my soul
I know I let you down
But I never let you go

Deep into the fire
The sun is yet to show
Burning through the skies
I gotta let you know

Look into my eyes
Deep into my soul
As long as I'm alive
I'll never let you go

Faith, trust that I will stay
I'll always be there
Faith, know that I have changed
I'm never leaving

(Always)
(Always)
(Always)
(Always)
(Always)
(Always)
