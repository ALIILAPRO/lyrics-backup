		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Too many teardrops for one heart to be crying
Too many teardrops for one heart to carry on

You're way on top now since you left me
You're always laughing way down at me
But watch out now, I'm gonna get there
We'll be together for just a little while
And then I'm gonna put you way down here
And you'll start crying ninety-six tears
Cry, cry

And when the sun comes up, I'll be on top
You'll be right down there, looking up
And I might wave, come up here
But I don't see you waving now
I'm way down here, wondering how
I'm gonna get you but I know now
I'll just cry, cry, I'll just cry

Too many teardrops for one heart to be crying
Too many teardrops for one heart to carry on

You're gonna cry ninety-six tears
You're gonna cry ninety-six tears
You're gonna cry, cry, cry, cry now
You're gonna cry, cry, cry, cry
Ninety-six tears

Come on and let me hear you cry, now
Ninety-six tears, woo
I wanna hear you cry
Night and day, yeah, all night long

Uh, ninety-six tears, cry, cry, cry
Come on, baby, let me hear you cry now, all night long
Uh, ninety-six tears, yeah, come on now
Uh, ninety-six tears
