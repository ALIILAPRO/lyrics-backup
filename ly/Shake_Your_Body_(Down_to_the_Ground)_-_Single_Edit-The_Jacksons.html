		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know what's gonna happen to you, baby
But I do know that I love you
You walk around this town
With your head all up in the sky
And I do know that I want you

Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground

You tease me with your loving to play hard to get
'Cause you do know that I want you
You walk around this town
With your head all up in the sky
And you do know that I want you

Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground

Shake it all down
You're the spark that lit the fire inside of me
And you do know that I love it
I need to do just something to get closer to your soul
And you do know that I want you

Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground

You tease me with your loving to play hard to get
'Cause you do know that I want you
I need to do just something to get closer to your soul
And you do know that I want you

Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout
Take it over

Down, down, down, down, down
Take it over

Woo
Dance, let's shout (dance, shout)
Shake your body down to the ground
Dance (dance, shout)
Dance (dance, shout)
Dance (dance, shout)
(Dance, shout)
