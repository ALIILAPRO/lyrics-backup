		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sold the little green house
In the old neighborhood
The kids needed space
Found an acre and a half, 4 bed, 3 bath
It's pretty great

Me and mike used to run every morning
He's twice as fast, and he's 40
We'd talk about music and Jesus
He always slows down for me

I'm gonna miss this place
And all the friends we made
Always thought that I
Be glad to say goodbye

When you find a dream
Then you finally see
That it's bittersweet
Like everything

That black velvet couch from my single days
Sit down, you might never get up

If it could talk it would tell you all the girls I laid 
It would say, basically none

I know that bookshelf is cheap pine
Bought it when I was 25
It might not be worth saving
But I don't want to replace it

I'm gonna miss this place
And all the friends we made
Always thought that I
Be glad to say goodbye

When you find a dream
Then you finally see
That it's bittersweet
Like everything

I wish I could go back in time
When my dog and my dad were alive
Running through Veterans Park
I would tell my younger self
It's paradise

I still got the taste in my mouth
Of that Lagavulin shot going down
To the tears on my cheek
When I held you near me
I see it clearly now

God, I miss those days
Why'd I wish 'em away 
Why'd I close my eyes
And pray for better times 

I'm holding onto you
Keep holding onto me
The taste of bittersweet
In everything
