		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't fight this feeling in my heart
Something that I can't describe
I know that I'm falling, falling hard
You make everything alright

Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry
'Cause you mean everything
Want you here for eternity, eternity

Here with me, ooh
Here with me, ooh
For eternity, ooh
For eternity, ooh
For eternity

For eternity, ooh
For eternity
Here with me
Eternity

I can't fight this feeling in my heart
Something that I can't describe
I know that I'm falling, falling hard
You make everything alright

Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry
'Cause you mean everything
Want you here for eternity, eternity

Here with me, ooh
Here with me, ooh
For eternity, ooh
For eternity, ooh
For eternity, ooh
For eternity

For eternity, ooh
For eternity
For eternity
Here with me
For eternity
For eternity, ooh
For eternity
For eternity
Here with me
Eternity
