		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And when it rains on this side of town
It touches everything
Just say it again and mean it

We don't miss a thing
You made yourself a bed at the bottom
Of the blackest hole (blackest hole)
And convinced yourself
That it's not the reason you don't see the sun anymore

And no, oh
How could you do it?
Oh, I
I never saw it coming
No, oh
I need an ending
So why can't you stay
Just long enough to explain?

And when it rains
You always find an escape
Just running away
From all of the ones who love you
From everything
You made yourself a bed at the bottom
Of the blackest hole (blackest hole)
And you'll sleep till May
You'll say that you don't wanna see the sun anymore

And no, oh
How could you do it?
Oh, I
I never saw it coming
No, oh
I need an ending
So why can't you stay
Just long enough to explain?

(Explain your side
Take my side)
Take these chances to turn it around
Let's take these chances we'll make it somehow
And take these chances and turn it around
Just turn it around

No, how could you do it?
Oh, I, I never saw it coming

No, oh, how could you do it?
Oh, I, I never saw it coming
No, oh, how could you do it?
Oh, I, I never saw it coming
No, oh
I need an ending
So why can't you stay
Just long enough to explain?

You can take your time, take my time
