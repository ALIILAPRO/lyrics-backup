		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nobody's home
There never was
Applaud her alma mater
It is medicine
It's not your fault
No, it never would
I loved his only daughter
Like he never could

And now you're stuck
Replacing my own tongue

There's no need to talk (oh no)
I'll read your palms (they say)
You lead me on (I'll lead the way)
Lead me on
There's no need to talk (oh no)
I'll read your palms (they say)
You lead me on (I'll lead the way)
Lead me on

She is all but hope
No, there never was
A duck in open water
It is evident
It's not your fault
No, it never is
We fuck in ocean water
To repent our sins

And now you're stuck
Replacing my own tongue

There's no need to talk (oh no)
I'll read your palms (they say)
You lead me on (I'll lead the way)
Lead me on
There's no need to talk (oh no)
I'll read your palms (they say)
You lead me on (I'll lead the way)
Lead me on

I should've seen that you needed some help, love
You said, "Enough, I am done with the self love now
I have no doubts
Although my faith is besieged, see, you can release me"
I should've known that you've grown from pretending
There's nothing fault, nothing false with inventing lies
To hide your guise
Though it's not easy to see through

There's no need to talk (oh no)
I'll read your palms (they say)
You lead me on (I'll lead the way)
Lead me on
There's no need to talk (oh no)
I'll read your palms (they say)
You lead me on (I'll lead the way)
Lead me on
