		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Striking up my discordant underture
A carnal cacophony perversely penned
Transposed and decomposed
On strings fashioned from human twine
Lovingly wound and fretted upon my bow
Garishly incarcerated the dead resonate
In a final death-throe

Vibrant as I thresh
Movements scripted for the dead

Orchestral horrors I vehemently conduct
My corpus concertos cordial
Disinterred  and detuned
With six feet below
In harmony with the deceased
My inspiration your disintegration
For my latest masterpiece

My scope creeps your flesh
Notes seep from sinewy frets

But don't hold your breath
As you wait for your god or the void
Or the abyss of nothingness
Your usefulness isn't through
Your productivity I resume

My sorbid, soiled handicrafts
Will be your afterlife's handicap

My corrupt crescendos
Will leave you out on a limbo
Your disposition I unleash
You will rest in my piece

With deadly dynamics
You're dead, buried and barred
Your remains dampened and fingered
Your mortal coil is barbed
The death-bells are peeling
Ringing out as you flake
Shrieking out their recitals
A celebration of your wake

Enter my funereality
My world two metres under
A curious habitat
Your muddy trench I plunder
Pass on to ethereality
Churned out under the sextant's blade
You live your life in wretchedness
And death is no escape
