		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I get too drunk when I get nervous
But I trip over my words either way
And I never let you deeper than the surface
But I'm pretty sure I'm too insecure to make you stay

But if I had a moment
Just one chance to hold ya
It'd be worth it even if it blows up in my face
So shoutout to my ego
For always makin' me so
Prone to move in quick only for me to hesitate

So here's to being single
I guess it's by design
Cuz I just seem to get in my own way every time
But damn it you're so perfect
And I can't see the signs
Or maybe I'm too scared to be in love to make you mine
So here's to being single

Here's to being single
Oh

I'm pretty sure I don't deserve ya
I think karma would've told me otherwise
Cuz I've had a million chances that I've screwed up
And babe I suspect you'll be the next to say goodbye

But if I had a moment
Just one chance to hold ya
It'd be worth it even if it blows up in my face
So shoutout to my ego
For always makin' me so
Prone to move in quick only for me to hesitate

So here's to being single
I guess it's by design
Cuz I just seem to get in my own way every time
But damn it you're so perfect
And I can't see the signs
Or maybe I'm too scared to be in love to make you mine
So here's to being single

Here's to being single
Oh

So here's to being single
I guess it's by design
Cuz I just seem to get in my own way every time
But damn it you're so perfect
And I can't see the signs
Or maybe I'm too scared to be in love to make you mine
So here's to being single

Here's to being single
Here's to being single 
Here's to being single
Oh

So here's to being single
