		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Forcing my way out of the pack 
Losing my strength on the way 
Losing sight of you 

My place was burnt, already lost 
Nothing holds me back in there 
Nothing holds me back 

But you were mine 
And I was gone 
In the shine 
Until you drown 
You were lost, not alone 
You were lost, so typical 

Forcing my way out of the mess 
I will find somewhere to rise 
I will find someone 

But you were mine 
And I was gone 
In the shine 
Until you drown 
You were lost, not alone 
You were lost, so typical
