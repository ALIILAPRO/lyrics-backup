		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When my wife asks me for anything, 
I'm gonna head out to the store. 
I'm gonna try to make her happy, 
That's what a man is for. 

When I get out past the corner, 
I'm gonna smoke my cigarette. 
I'm still just enough a rebel, 
So don't give up on me yet. 

When my kids are doing homework, 
I'm gonna help the best I can. 
When it's bedtime I'll read stories, 
cnd sing a song when I tuck â€˜em in. 

But then I'm heading to the basement, 
To pour myself a glass a rye. 
I'm still just enough a rebel
To earn my whiskey at night. 

Well I'm just enough a rebel to keep me honest. 
But I'm good enough a man to keep me true. 
Sometimes it takes a man to do the laundry, 
But it takes just enough a rebel to be man enough for you. 

So if I stay late at the bar, 
I hope you let me reminisce. 
cnd when the ladies try to take me,
I'm gonna side step every kiss. 

Well I'm man enough to keep my word, 
cnd always hold you in my mind. 
But when you're just enough a rebel, 
You gotta shut the bar down sometimes. 

Well I'm just enough a rebel to keep me honest. 
But I'm good enough a man to keep me true. 
Sometimes it takes a man to do the laundry, 
But it takes just enough a rebel to be man enough for you. 

Well I'm just enough a rebel to keep me honest. 
But I'm good enough a man to keep me true. 
Sometimes it takes a man to do the laundry, 
But it takes just enough a rebel to be man enough for you. 
Oh it takes just enough a rebel, to be man enough for you.
