		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't see the sun, I'ma take a ecstasy
I'm a night fiend, yeah
I just popped a bean (yeah, Ayy, yo, Ian)

Yeah, I just popped a bean
(Bean) , I just got the Rolls Royce seats
Bitch, I'm in the Cullinan
Got curtains underneath
All these bitches flawless
I call this bitch a sink (Phew)
Yeah, I wake up on a Sunday for service
(yeah) if you come to us with money
We need it urgent
I've been doin' it a long time, not no virgin
(yeah) yeah, lamb chop the coupe then
Let the birds in it (yeah)

Yeah, bitch told me she love God
I'm high with the gods
Bitch, you talked to God (Hello?) , oh my God
Like somebody asks me questions
Off the opiates, i nod
In a telly overseas
I'm in France with a broad

All my clothes made, custom-built
They from Milan call my twizzy crazy
Cut the snakes up out that lawn (yeah)
My twizzy play the instrument
The mini Draco drum (Doo doo doo doo)
I just signed a deal, I'm up two milly
I think I won (Woo, woo)
I just let the top down
I just went in and the bitch
I'm with the mob now
When you get a lot of money
They start to flock around (Flock)
When you get a lot of bullshit
Come and block it out (Uh)
Yeah, these ain't five percent windows
More like fifty now
Everyday I'm gettin' lifted
It's so silly now (Ha)
They tell me, go and break the rules 'fore
I bring the ceiling down (yeah)
Yeah, and I know I'm on the X, yeah
I can feel it now (Woo)
You can tell I'm on a bootin' up (yeah)
You can tell I'm on a bootin' up (yeah)
You can tell just by the look, yeah
If they true or not (yeah)
Couple of years ago in the basement
Had a noodle pot (yeah)
I don't give a fuck
(Nah) , I don't care at all
Called up Eliantte (Brrt-brrt) 
Askin' if he done cleanin' my carats off
(Hello?) i will take Percs on a bus
I took the nearest stop (Give me them)
The money not really nothin', yeah
Ain't hearin' y'all (What?)
I be hangin' with my demon
What I look like fearin' y'all?

Yeah, I just popped a bean
Yeah, I just popped a bean
I'm the bean man, yeah, yeah
I just popped a bean, I just popped a

Yeah, I just popped a bean
(Bean) , I just got the Rolls Royce seats
Bitch, I'm in the Cullinan
Got curtains underneath
All these bitches flawless
I call this bitch a sink (Phew)
Yeah, I wake up on a Sunday for service
(yeah) if you come to us with money
We need it urgent
I've been doin' it a long time, not no virgin
(yeah) yeah, lamb chop the coupe then
Let the birds in it (yeah)

Yeah, bitch told me she love God
I'm high with the gods
Bitch, you talked to God (Hello?) , oh my God
