		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see this maga last December
He wan come closer I say what is the matter
He say na soldier say he go fire If I no give am number
He want to be my lover
I say your father I repeat am your father
Oh see me see wahala I don enter yawa
Oh oh I tell my mama my mama tell my papa
She say see me see wahala

Soldier go soldier come soldier do wetin you want
But don't fall in love with me
Soldier go soldier come soldier do wetin you want
But don't fall in love with me

Oya stand at attention
I'm talking to you you are respond
Emi okunrin mesan how can you be asking me question
You no dey look face so
It's like you don't know my name no
Mo fe ka ma date though
Eyi to pe ni boyfriend o le to na me say so
See I stand I balance You stand you balance
Because I'm a chief lieutenant I cannot be your servant
You no see my car it's German
You no see the swag gallant
See many dey claim my madam
But I no know these babes from Adam
They just want to follow the ladder
They know that nobody is badder
She say Why him dey flex like here be gym
Make he dey hope dey there dey dream
Is it by force to be with him Is this a military regime
I be soldier man I say stand at ease
Sho ri Dollar ma fi gba e leti
It's only me there is no competi
I'll make it rain like it's confetti
Sho mo Paris Sho ti lo be ri no
I will take you and your ebi oh
No mess up na wahala
I'm a Hitler I'm Abacha
You better respect I dey run the town
Even Darego no fit turn me down
See weapon wey you carry
Come and be general in my army Mummy

Soldier go soldier come soldier do wetin you want
But don't fall in love with me
Soldier go soldier come soldier do wetin you want
But don't fall in love with me

Mr Soldier
Me I dey wonder
Shey is it by force you dey form superpower
Yeah I'm super I get power
Wa gba paper wa fi shower Mo ti shower
I get babes the age of your mama
So just stop am this your drama
See this man I say your father
Oya oya repeat am your father
Oh see me see wahala
I don enter yawa oh oh
Oh yes na yawa wey you enter it's a one chance
I tell you no man over throne man from this romance
Only coup detat

Soldier go soldier come soldier do wetin you want
But don't fall in love with me
Soldier me I no dey do
Soldier find another boo just don't fall in love me
Soldier me I no dey do
Soldier me I no dey do so don't you fall in love
Mo ni don't you fall in love with me with me
Don't you fall in love don't you fall in love
Yeah yeah
