		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do-do-do-do, whoa-whoa-whoa
Do-do-do-do

As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing, will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky (always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (mm, ooh)
I said, it's gonna be always
Until the day that eight times eight (yeah, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Times eight is four (you know it's gonna be always)
Until the day that is the day that are no more

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
Her acceptance is the way we pay (mmm, baby)
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever (forever), another day
As today, I know I'm living, but tomorrow
Could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear, 'cause you're here
Now I know deep in my mind
The love of me I've felt behind
And I'll be loving you always (I'll be loving you)

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Lovin' you until the ocean covers every mountain high
Be lovin' you until the dolphins fly and parrots live at sea
Lovin' you until the dream of life and life becomes a dream
Now ain't that lovin' you 
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (I'll be loving you forever)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four (always)
Until the day that is the day that are no more

Did you know that true love asks for nothing (true love don't want a thing)
Her acceptance is the way we pay (ooh, baby)
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last forever, another day

As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Now I know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
And I'll be loving you always

Lovin' you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
I'll be lovin' you until the ocean covers every mountain high (always)
Lovin' you until the dolphins fly and parrots live at sea
Lovin' you until the dream of life and life becomes a dream
Now ain't that lovin' you, yeah
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (now ain't that lovin' you, yeah)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (I'll be lovin' you forever)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four (I'll be lovin', lovin')
Until the day that is the day that are no more (changes, I'll be lovin')

Always, always (oh, yeah), always
Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky (always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (always)

Until the day that everything changes
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin (always, always)
