		  (Guess who's back?)

Drop the drums, here it comes
Only got two minutes to bounce, and every second counts
Better press, REC on your deck, here we go, set, pass the MoÃ«t
My trickery's more slippery when wet
Wicked as I flip, don't trip, get a grip
It'll kick, if the bass line's thick, it's a hit
Everybody's got a mic now, it's like a hobby
Or more like a job, 'cause bootleggers tryna rob me
And little man wants to be a rap star
Make papes, hit skins, drive a fat car
It ain't easy, sleazy even
Deceiving those we believe in
No benefits, just tricks and chicks
Knock a pig to pick, so here's a stick to lick
I shoot a gift 'til there ain't nothin' left
And if I find that the track sound def
I catch wreck 'til I lose my breath
That's how it goes in the land of broke
I dispose of those, rock shows, and collect my dough
Now I suppose I'm a bad guy, why?
I say hi, and try to stay high
Life's a mess don't stress, test
Of giving, but be thankful that you're living blessed
Guess who's back, coming back with the track supplied?
By Special Ed and AK, coming right and exact
I'm fighting it back, now snap, where they at?
When it's time to go to combat, guess who's back?

Yes, I'm back (2Pac is back)
Yes, I'm back (2Pac is back)
Yes, I'm back (2Pac is back)
Yes, I'm back (2Pac is back)

Drop the drums, here it comes
Only got one minute to bounce, and every second counts
I went from hustling dicks, to making hits, busting flicks
Now I'm sure to be rich for '96
I pull my capes on tapes, and make papes
Trace the bass to the tape with the baddest bass to date
I try to shake it but the pace is hard to break
Good thoughts I wait, 'cause they hate my black tape
Yeah, it's on, and it's packed in the rap race
But if ya got a black face it's a rat race
I struggle to be rugged and raw, Dukes
Tryna survive in the trials and lawsuits
Everybody wants to test me, why me?
No lie, niggas fry when they try me
Giving up the roughness, justice
I'ma bust as I'm ripping up 'nough hits
And guess who's back? No longer trapped
'Cause I snapped on the ones that held me back, feel the contact
Ride the track, get I grip as I flip
Ghetto wickedness I kick, guess who's back?

Yes, I'm back (2Pac is back)
Yes, I'm back (2Pac is back)
Yes, I'm back (2Pac is back)
Yes, I'm back (2Pac is back)
Yes, I'm back (2Pac is back)
Yes, I'm back (2Pac is back)
Yes I'm back, 'cause I never did front
