		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I met you it was summer love
We were rebels living just for fun
Lie awake until the sun
Creeped into the crease of the curtains (curtains)

We go drinkin' underneath the green
And we dream of being seventeen
I remember who we were
We were looking out to the future (the future)

When we were young, we thought we knew it all
When we were strong and undefeatable
Oh, no, no, no, when we were young
Oh, no, no, no, and we were innocent

When we were young and we were innocent

When I see you now you look the same
Pretty face inside a different frame
I don't even know if you
Still listen to the tunes that we used to
(Oh, when we were young)

When we were young, we thought we knew it all
When we were strong and undefeatable
Oh, no, no, no, when we were young
Oh, no, no, no, and we were innocent

When we were young and we were innocent
When we were young and we were innocent

We've got stop
We're all grown up
We might as well
Embrace the fun
So keep your words
Give me your touch
Know that we're young
And we were innocent

And we were innocent
When we were young and we were innocent

When we were young, we thought we knew it all
Knew it all, and we were innocent
When we were young, we thought we knew it all
Knew it all, and we were innocent

When we were young, we thought we knew it all
When we were strong and undefeatable
Oh, no, no, no, when we were young
Oh, no, no, no
