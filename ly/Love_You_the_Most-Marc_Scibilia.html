		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love the way the sunlight hits your hair in the morning
when the day is forming
I love the way you wake up way too early in a bad mood
and I laugh at you
I love making you coffee
so much cream, it's almost white
love watching movies with you
even movies I don't like
I love the days and all ways we get to be together
wish it'd last forever

I have loved so many things
even more than you know
when the seasons have changed us
I searched for your ghost
every time that I found you
I have learned to let go
more than anything about you
I love you the most
I love you the most
I love you the most
I love you the most
I love you the most

I love the way you love me through my faults and imperfections
never holding them against me
I’d love to say I’d do the same for you but I’d be lying
you tell me that I’m trying
I love making you oatmeal with bananas on the side
I love your body language when I don't make it just right
I love the days and all the ways we get to be together
wish it was forever

I have loved so many things
even more than you know
when the seasons have changed us
I searched for your ghost 
every time that I found you 
I have learned to let go
more than anything about you 
I love you the most
I love you the most
I love you the most
I love you the most
I love you the most
