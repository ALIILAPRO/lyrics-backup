		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Would you believe me when I tell you
You are the king of my dreams?
Please don't deceive me when I hurt you
It just ain't the way it seems

Can't you hear my love buzz?
Can't you hear my love buzz?
Can't you hear my love buzz?

I need you like a desert needs rain
I would rather like to die
Darling, oh when I don't see you
So spread your wings and fly

Can't you hear my love buzz?
Can't you hear my love buzz?
Can't you hear my love buzz?
