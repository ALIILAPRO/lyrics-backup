		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know something you don't know
Trouble coming to your home
Wake up and you're all alone
I know something you don't know

I know why you're on the phone
Late night when you're feeling low
I know why you're in the mud
I know why it's in your blood
I know who your master is
I know when he calls it quits
You'll be in a Chinese restaurant
Over rice with the mud still dripping out

I know something you don't know
Trouble coming to your home
Wake up and you're all alone
I know something you don't know
