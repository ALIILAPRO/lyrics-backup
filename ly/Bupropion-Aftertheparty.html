		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll wrap you up like cellophane
Skin tight i want you enclosed
Friction make you lose composure
Smoke dancing in your windows

Just put me out
Put me through every emotion

Just put me out
Put me through every emotion
Haven't felt good since emulsion
Bupropion isn't working

I feel it again
I'm not really living
I'm going through motions
I'm watching your motions

So wrap me up like cellophane
I'll suffocate nothing but a smile
Keep on making me pick a side
I know you want a fuck and a fight
And i got used to being left behind
Nobody gonna get you where you wanna go
Nobody gonna tell you what they really know
Save your time on me just put me out
Save your time on me

Just put me out
Put me through every emotion
Haven't felt good since emulsion
Bupropion isn't working
