		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thinking of the right words while we
Are talking in the moonlit street
And your hand is resting on my cheek
Suddenly I feel that I can't speak
Three words echo through the night sky
The stars have never felt so alive
My mind is working in overdrive
Imagining a love I've yet to find
Im forced to fantasize
Falling for my demise
Cause I watch others find love
Am I asking for too much?
Im forced to fantasize
I know its not real life
But I'm walking happily
In my own field of dreams
Nobody wake me
Im happy in my makeshift reality
Gazing at the marigold sky
A gentle glow reflects in your eyes
And I feel that our hearts intertwine
When you talk about the things you like
I just want to love sincerely
Not some summer fling, but just simply
Someone I can trust to give all of me
But I haven't found that with somebody, so
Im forced to fantasize
Falling for my demise
Cause I watch others find love
Am I asking for too much?
Im forced to fantasize
I know its not real life
But I'm walking happily
In my own field of dreams
Nobody wake me
Im happy in my makeshift reality
And maybe we'd talk for hours
Your laughter sweet like every flower
Hungover after happy hour
Cause I was drunk on the thought of a lover
Nobody wake me
I'm happy
Im forced to fantasize
Falling for my demise
Cause I watch others find love
Am I asking for too much?
I'm forced to fantasize
I know its not real life
But I'm walking happily
In my own field of dreams
Nobody wake me
I'm happy in my makeshift reality
