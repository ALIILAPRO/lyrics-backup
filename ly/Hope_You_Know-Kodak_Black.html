		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hope you know, uh
I'll forever fuck with you
I hope you know
Ayy, ayy, yeah
I hope you know, I still ain't over you
I miss my bro, I miss my homie too
I hope you know I'm still your main man
Even though you gone, ayy, ayy, yeah

I hope you know, I still ain't over you
I miss my bro, I miss my homie too
I hope you know I'm still your main man
Even though you gone, I still ain't changin'
Even though you wrong, I'm still gon' fuck with you
Even though you told, I still got love for you
Young nigga, I'm in the deep end like I'm in the pool
If a nigga give me a reason, you know I'ma shoot

Fourteen, I'm just a teenager, and I hit the news
Mama, I'm just tryna be great, nigga, won't let me do it
Every time I walk out the door, I know you're prayin' over me
Every time need you the most, you right here where you 'posed to be
I hope you know, I'm still your woe, I'm still a good friend
I still be keepin' it real when ain't nobody lookin' at me
I let you walk all over me, left me with footprints
I wish you hit me up and check on how I'm doin' at least
I hope you know, I still ain't over you
I miss my ho, I miss my mama too
I hope you know I'm still your main man
Even though you wrong, I'm still in here
Even though you wrong, I'm still right here
And I'm cryin' so much inside, I never shed a tear
How the hell we fall out like it's nothin'? That shit weird
When we been thuggin' and we been runnin' for all these years

I hope you know, I still ain't over you
I miss my bro, I miss my homie too
I hope you know I'm still your main man
Even though you gone (ayy, ayy, yeah)
I hope you know, I still ain't over you
I miss my bro, I miss my homie too
I hope you know I'm still your main man
Even though you gone, I still ain't changin'
Even though you wrong, I'm still gon' fuck with you

Right now I'm just tryna be greater
Right now I'm tryna be greater
These niggas won't let me live better
Bae, I promise, I'ma be better

I hope you know, I'm still your woe, I'm still a good friend
I still be keepin' it real when ain't nobody lookin' at me
I let you walk all over me, left me with footprints
I wish you hit me up and check on how I'm doin' at least
I hope you know
Even though you gone
Even though you wrong
Uh, I hope you know
And, I'm just tryna be
But, these niggas won't let me be
These niggas won't let me be great
These bitches won't let me be me

And, I'm just tryna be greater
I hope you know
