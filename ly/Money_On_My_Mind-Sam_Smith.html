		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I signed my deal, I felt pressure
Don't wanna see the numbers, I wanna see heaven
You say could you write a song for me?
I say I'm sorry I won't do that happily

When I go home
I tend to close the door
I never wanted more
So sing with me
Can't you see?

I don't have money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love
I don't have money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love

I do it for the love
I do it for the love

Please don't get me wrong, I wanna keep it moving
I know what that requires, I'm not foolish
Please can you make this work for me?
'Cause I'm not a puppet, I will work against your strings

When I go home
I tend to close the door
I never wanted more
So sing with me
Can't you see?

I don't have money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love
I don't have money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love

I do it for the love
I do it for the love

When the sun will set, don't you fret
No, I have no money on my mind
No money on my mind
No money on my mind
No, I have no money on my mind
When the sun will set, don't you fret
No, I have no money on my mind
No money on my mind
No money on my mind
No, I have no money on my mind
Just love

Money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love
I don't have money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love

I do it for the love
I do it for the love
