		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can get yourself into a fight
If that's the way you wanna live your life
You can get yourself connected
To the world that we are thrown to, yeah

But all I need is somewhere to lay
Somewhere to lay my hat up
I need someone to love in the middle of the day
I want someone to be, and someone to drive around town
I need someone to love when the chips are down
Love me when the chips are down
Will you love me when the chips are down?
Love me when the chips are down
Could you love me when the world is crashing all around?

You can try and be someone you're not
If that's the river that you want to cross
You can choose the life of a bohemian
Or you can choose the material world

But all I need is somewhere to lay
Somewhere to lay my hat up
I need someone to love in the middle of the day
I need someone to be, someone to drive around town
I need someone to love when the chips are down
Oh yeah
Love me when the chips are down, oh
Love me when the chips are down
Love me when the chips are down
Could you love me when the world is crashing all around?
All around

All I need is somewhere to lay
Somewhere to lay my hat up
I need someone to love in the middle of the day
I want someone to be, and someone to drive around town
I need someone to love, one to love, one to love
Love me when the chips are down
Yeah
Will you love me when the chips are down
Oh oh
Love me when the chips are down
Can love me when the chips are down
And could you love me when the world is crashing all around?
