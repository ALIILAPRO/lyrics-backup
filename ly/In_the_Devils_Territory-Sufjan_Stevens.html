		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Be still and know your sign.
The Beast will arrive in time.
We stayed a long, long time.
We stayed a long, long time.
To see you, to beat you,
To see you at last.

I saw the dragons drying.
I saw the witches whine.
We stayed a long, long time.
But I'm not afraid to die.
To see you, to meet you,
To see you last.

I stole my father's shoes.
I pulled His pockets too.
We stayed a long, long time.
We stayed a long, long time.
To see you, to beat you,
To see you, to meet you.
To see you at last.
