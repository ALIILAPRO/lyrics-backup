		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sing your song, sing out for me
Give it everything you've got, just one more time for me
Move in from the dark

I'm all of this and nothing
I'm the dirt beneath your feet
I'm the sun that rises while you're sleeping
I'm all you need

The river's wide, too wide to see
There's a storm outside my window moving close to me
Move in from the dark

I'm all of this and nothing
I'm the dirt beneath your feet
I'm the sun that rises while you're sleeping
I'm all you need

Black water high, too high to breathe
And there's a ghost outside my window haunting me

Move in from the dark
Move in from the dark

I'm all of this and nothing
I'm the dirt beneath your feet
I'm the sun that rises while you're sleeping
I'm all you need (move in from the dark)
I'm all of this and nothing (move in from the dark)
I'm the dirt beneath your feet (move in from the dark)
I'm the sun that rises while you're sleeping (move in from the dark)
I'm all you need (move in from the dark)

Move in from the dark
Move in from the dark
