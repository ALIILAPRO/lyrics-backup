		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  took my love and i took it down
climbed a mountain and i turned around
and i saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
and the landslide brought me down

oh, mirror in the sky
what is love?
can the child within my heart rise above?
can i sail through the changin' ocean tides?
can i handle the seasons of my life?

well, i've been afraid of changin'
'cause i've built my life around you
and time makes you bolder
even children get older
and i'm getting older too

took my love and i took it down
climbed a mountain and i turned around
and i saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
till the landslide brought me down
well, the landslide bring it down

well, i've been afraid of changin'
'cause i've built my life around you
but time makes you bolder
even children get older
and i'm getting older too
oh i'm getting older
i'm getting older 
i'm getting older too
