		  I can be a freak
I can, I can be a freak
I can, I can be a freak
I can, I can be a freak
I can, I can be a freak
I can, I can be a freak
I can, I can be a freak
I can, I can be a freak
I can, I can be a freak
I can, I can be a freak
I can, I can be a freak
I can, I can be a freak
Every day of every week

This is something that I love
Listen I'm about to teach
Every single girl should embrace
Their inner freaky freak
Don't be scared, don't be shy
Yes you gotta let it be
I can give instructions if ya like to
Like to hear me speak

Let me see those hand cuffs off
Let me see that leather gear
Kiss him, slap him, pull his hair
Make him yo bitch in here
He wanna see you get down low
He wanna hear you, hear you go
I can be a freak, every day of every week

How ever do you want it (How ever)
How ever do you need it (Do you need me)
How ever do you want it (How)
How ever do you need it (Do you need me)
How ever do you want it (How ever)
How ever do you need it (Do you need me)
How ever do you want it
How ever do you
I can be a, I can be a
I can be a freak

I can, I can be a freak
I can, I can be a freak
I can, I can be a freak
I can, I can be a freak
I can, I can be a freak
I can, I can be a freak

Every day of every week
F, R, E, A, K
Let me be yo freak (OK)
Superman lover
I'll pitch yo tent with a X.L. magnum under cover
She know the deal
Ass look better in a 9 inch heel
One left in my room
Like Cinderella
Hand full of chicks
No better get ill
Freak to the bone
Even if ya mom home I'm beatin' still
Killed them chicks
When I see you in the club
Better write yo will
Approach with caution
Careful how you handle my drill
Yea, and we freakin' still
How ever do you want it (How ever)
How ever do you need it (Do you need me)
How ever do you want it (How)
How ever do you need it (Do you need me)
How ever do you want it (How ever)
How ever do you need it (Do you need me)
How ever do you want it
How ever do you

I can be a, I can be a
I can be a freak
I can, I can be a freak
I can, I can be a freak
I can, I can be a freak
I can, I can be a freak
I can, I can be a freak
I can, I can be a freak

Every day of every week
He wanna hear
You say
That,
I can be a freak, every day of every week
Ha, yes they tell you so fly
Right down, right down to the shoes
Wanna spin these fellas round
Ladies this is how you do
Whip yo hair, do yo smile
Tell him this is nothing new
Take it out the box if wanna see you in the nude
He wanna see you hand cuffed out
He wanna see yo leather gear
Kiss me, slap me, pull my hair
He wanna see me smack that their
He wanna see you get down low
He wanna hear you, hear you go
I can be freak every day of every week

How ever do you want it (How ever)
How ever do you need it (Do you need me)
How ever do you want it (How)
How ever do you need it (Do you need me)
How ever do you want it (How ever)
How ever do you need it (Do you need me)
How ever do you want it
How ever do you
I can be a, I can be a
I can be a freak

I can, I can be a freak
I can, I can be a freak
I can, I can be a freak
I can, I can be a freak
I can, I can be a freak
I can, I can be a freak

Every day of every week
