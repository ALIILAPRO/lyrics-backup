		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This young boy is a problem
You should call it in
Yeah, he's kicking down the
Doors Jim Morrison
This young boy is a problem
You should call it in
And he's kicking down the Doors Jim Morrison
Jim Morrison

Abbey Road and Blueprint playing on Vinyl
With the hippy flower princess born in Ohio
Chats with label presidents about my goals
And that's before 23, damn straight
I'm so Michael

The teachers said I'm nothing
But Kanye gave me college
And they feel me down in Brooklyn
Yeah, I'm feeling very Christopher Wallace
Roll me up that Mr marley
Take a pull and kick some knowledge
Ask my father, getting money is hereditary
Will Smith bitch, I am feeling legendary

This young boy is a problem
You should call it in
Yeah, he's kicking down the
Doors Jim Morrison
This young boy is a problem
You should call it in
And he's kicking down the Doors Jim Morrison
Jim Morrison

Brews with Chris Zarou
We at the Four Seasons
Got my mother crying for the right reasons
Cute English reporter tells me I'm steamin'
I reply that, "I'm just blessed to be eating"

The teachers said I'm nothing
But Kanye gave me college
And they feel me down in Brooklyn
Yeah, I'm feeling very Christopher Wallace
Roll me up that Mr marley
Take a pull and kick some knowledge
Ask my father, getting money is hereditary
Will Smith bitch, I am feeling legendary

This young boy is a problem
You should call it in
Yeah, he's kicking down the
Doors Jim Morrison
This young boy is a problem
You should call it in
And he's kicking down the Doors Jim Morrison
Jim Morrison
