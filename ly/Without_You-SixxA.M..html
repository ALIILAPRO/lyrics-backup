		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way this story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes the sorrow shows
Yeah, it shows

Oh, I can't forget tomorrow
'Cause I think of all the sorrow
I had you here, but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know

I can't live, if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live, if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give anymore

No, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes the sorrow shows
It shows

I can't live, if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live, if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give anymore

I can't live, if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live, if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give anymore

I can't live, yeah, if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live, if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give anymore
