		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sticks and stones in my soul 
We all know how it goes
When the demon in your head don't wanna let you go 
Now I'm here to let you know 
Imma raging on a road 
I got no impulse control 
I'm that boy who can't say can't say no 
Knocked out angel with a rope 
Tied a nooze around my Throat 
Well it's time to say goodbye 
'Cause this life's no longer mine 
Yeah this life's no longer mine

Away away away 
I just want to fade away 
Away away away 
I just want to fade away 

Secret club nine o'clock 
New faces are in shock 
No homies from my block 
'Cause they don't want to see me stop 
Misbehave around the clock 
I see smoke from a far 
Tied to fires in the bar 
Bottled feelings in my heart 
Take one step ahead 
Then back to the start 
From the good to the bad 
And then back to the dark 
With the friends that had 
That I no longer want 
With the friends that had 
That I no longer want 

Away away away 
I just want to fade away
Away away away 
I just want to fade away

I just want to fade away
I just want to fade away
I just want to fade away
I just want to fade away
I just want to fade away

Away away away 
I just want to fade away
Away away away 
I just want to fade away
