		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I couldn't have it, yes, I let it get in
The helpless hope to missing of spring
Worn out and tired and my heart never tired
And the world's bent doubled from weeping
And yet, the birds begin to sing
Ooh ooh oh

Daffodil, daffodil

I'm not bad, I'm not good
I drank every scar that I could
Made myself mythical, tried to be real
Saw the future in the face of a

Daffodil, daffodil
Daffodil, daffodil

You practice resurrection every night
Raising the dead under the moonlight
In the gloaming night, start to cry
You're a perfect pearl out in the sky

There is no bad, there is no good
I drank all the blood that I could
Made myself mythical, tried to be real
Saw the future in the face of a

Daffodil, daffodil
Daffodil, daffodil

English sun, she has come
To kiss my face and tell me I'm that chosen one
A generation soaked in grief
We're drying out and hanging on by the skin of our teeth
I never thought it would get this far
This somewhat drunken joke
Sometimes I see so much beauty
I don't think that I can cope

There is no bad, there is no good
I drank every scar that I could
Made myself mythical, tried to be real
Saw the future in the face of a

Daffodil, daffodil
Daffodil, daffodil
