		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somethin' in your eyes, makes me wanna lose myself
Makes me wanna lose myself, in your arms
There's somethin' in your voice, makes my heart beat fast
Hope this feeling lasts, the rest of my life

If you knew how lonely my life has been
And how low I've felt for so long
If you knew how I wanted someone to come along
And change my life the way you've done

Feels like home to me, feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from
Feels like home to me, feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong

A window breaks down a long dark street
And a siren wails in the night
But I'm alright, 'cause I have you here with me
And I can almost see, through the dark there's a light

If you knew how much this moment means to me
And how long (and how long) I've waited (I've waited) for your touch

Feels like home to me, feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from
Feels like home to me, feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong
