		  (Great John on the beat, by the way)

Dead broke sinnin', I was wishin'
Mama always said I'm gifted
Now I'm sittin' on some bank rolls
Ayy, even with a camera couldn't picture
Any image of my present
Now I'm sittin' on same bank rolls

I be faded out
Like a storm, had to wait it out, huh
Even the coach can't tell I was playin' out, huh
Can't believe I made it out, can't believe I made it now, huh
Remember school days I would skip class 'cause they made fun of the kid
When they see me now they be shocked, they'll see me livin' life like a king
Used to wake up and throw the same fit on, huh
I still wake up and throw the same fit on, uh-uh
Shit got worse on better days
Sometimes gotta pray
Even when shit sweet still gotta stay on point, huh
Gotta stay-
Stay vicious, nigga, demon time, huh
'Cause you slip just once can be that fatal slide, huh

Remember I was dead broke sinnin', I was wishin'
Mama always said I'm gifted
Now I'm sittin' on some bank rolls
Ayy, even with a camera couldn't picture
Any image of my present
Now I'm sittin' on same bank rolls

But they don't wanna see me winnin', huh
Took some losses but I'm back though
Metro card was always missin', huh
I remember screamin', "Back door!"
'Cause I couldn't pay for the bus, huh
God and my gun who I trust
Move with it, I'll turn you to dust
Left back but they thought I was dunce
I wasn't in special-ed but still I'ma special kid, huh-huh
Got homies takin' meds for injuries, stuck with it, huh-huh
Now how could you hate 'em, huh?
I can relate, huh
I can relate
'Cause I can relate
