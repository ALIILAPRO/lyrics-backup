		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We all yearn for happy endings
a time when smiles come easily
I, used to want and chase that blue sky
Now I'm scared I have forgotten how
to fly through darkened storm clouds

I used to live within a safe lie
Familiar darkness keeping me alive
Now my art's feels like its not mine
Do I know how to fight even with the enemy
is on my side

I love that I can finally wear white
But now I don't know how I am without the
fight
Or flight the fear of losing everything at once
Now, who am I?

I don't know how to live my life
Without breaking like a glass on
hardened floors of ice
So similar but biting cold will stop the blood
flow
Veins filled with the songs of crying
Tears of golden sorrow

I used to think it's what I wanted
being freed of all that churned inside of me
But now I wonder if this Happy end is
What I want to be the end of me

The demons see my smile and then they
leave
But they were safe inside of me for all these
years
Although it's gone I feel anxiety
When I don't know who I'm supposed to be

don't know how to live my life
Without breaking like a glass on
hardened floors of ice
So similar but biting cold will stop the blood
flow
Veins filled with the songs of crying
Tears of golden sorrow

How Do I live this life
without breaking like a glass on
Hardened floors of ice
So similar but biting cold will stop the blood
flow
Veins filled my songs of crying
Tears of golden sorrow

What do I do with life
I'm not breaking but I'm glass on
Melting floors of ice
So warm and yet it doesn't stop the blood
Filled veins not crying with the years I've
spent
With tears of golden sorrow
