		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I watch as my world's going up in flames
Through the black smoke, I can see your face
Embers, they rain as the walls come down
Where do we go when the lights go out?

I gave you my blood, my sweat, my tears
And all you ever did was leave me here
Set me on fire, 'cause you love the hurt
Set me on fire just to watch me
On my knees, my heart, it bleeds
While you pour gasoline all over me
Set me on fire, 'cause you love the hurt
Set me on fire just to watch me
Burn
Burn

What would you do if you lost control?
How would you feel if your dreams were sold?
With both your hands tied and your taped up mouth
You finally feel how I'm feeling now

I gave you my blood, my sweat, my tears
And all you ever did was leave me here
Set me on fire, 'cause you love the hurt
Set me on fire just to watch me
On my knees, my heart, it bleeds
While you pour gasoline all over me
Set me on fire, 'cause you love the hurt
Set me on fire just to watch me
Burn
Burn
