		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I mean Whatever Whatever
I'm tryna love better love better
I mean whatever whatever
I'm tryna love better love better

And All I ask is that you pray for me
I'm just saying
People call me on that nonsense no conversation
They don't understand my pain or my situation
Take my hues & replace them with affirmations

All I really need right now is Bliss (aye)
All I really need right now, all I really need right now
All I really need right now is a little bit of bliss (bliss) (aye)
All I really need right now, all I really need right now
All I really need right now is a little bit of bliss (bliss) (aye)
(Said all I really need right now is some bliss for the night) (aye)
All I really need right now, all I really need right now
All I really need right now is a little bit of

Can I get love (get love) can I get peace (get peace)
Can I get joy (get joy) I'm tryna increase (increase)
My Euphoria and feel complete
But the sorrow won't decrease
(Won't Decrease)
Novocaine on my emotions
I couldn't feel myself growing
I haven't really been too social
Eviction i know some of You noticed
Just know this... (Ah)
Lately I been a pessimist
Ain't no amount of black excellence
In my genes can attest to this
Stress I've really been tested with
This bad energy is evident
I OD'd on some Extra Bliss
This pain killing my head & sh*t
Truth be told man I'm scared of it
I took time to ration out what a nigga has left cause I know how scare it is
Bliss it comes & goes can't cherish it
I feel so alone
And happiness ain't here no more
I write my pain in all these songs & right my wrongs
Waiting for God to pull me out this sin I'm in
And send people who are genuine
I'm just tryna find bliss again
I'm just tryna find bliss again
I'm Just tryna find
I cater to people too much
Tryna serve food for thought
To these niggas
Now my heart need fixing
Broken on these records
Like I'm tryna get a Guinness
I think my depression is the #1 killer
And real niggas ain't real niggas
If they can't keep it real witcha
When that feel hit ya when you feel worthless they don't wanna deal with you
Shooting for bliss get a negative picture
Working on exchanging art
For happiness
Y'all got goals nigga mines a
Lil bigger
I gotta love for the music
I gotta love for the music
I gotta love for the music
I gotta love for influence
But if it ain't positive then Just know I'm not included
I'm feelin hypnotized striving for bliss
But I think happiness is all an illusion

I mean Whatever Whatever
I'm tryna love better love better
(I need some happiness but I can't find it now I need some help ooooh oh, ooooh oh ooooh oh yea)
I mean whatever whatever
I'm tryna love better love better

And All I ask is that you pray for me
I'm just saying
People call me on that nonsense no conversation
They don't understand my pain or my situation
Take my hues & replace them with affirmations

All I really need right now is Bliss (aye)
All I really need right now, all I really need right now
All I really need right now is a little bit of bliss (bliss) (aye)
All I really need right now, all I really need right now
All I really need right now is a little bit of bliss (bliss) (aye)
(Said all I really need right now is some bliss for the night) (aye)
All I really need right now, all I really need right now
All I really need right now is a little bit of...
