		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What a combination
You think it's forever?
No big revelation
That she ain't so clever

A generation gap
Right there in your lap
Oh and you don't cross it
You just wanna feel less bad
When you fade away
Do you think she'll stay?
Oh no, she'll be loyal 
'Till your dying day

So what you gonna do?
Mr. money, money
Tell me, tell me
Is it really love for you?
Mr. money, money
Sugar, sugar
What you wanna do?

You
Look so ecstatic
She makes you feel younger
All I see is panic
An insatiable hunger

A generation gap
Right there in your lap
Oh and you don't cross it
You just wanna feel less bad
When you fade away
Do you think she'll stay?
Oh no, she'll be loyal 
'Till your dying day

So what you gonna do?
Mr. money, money
Tell me, tell me
Is it really love for you?
Mr. money, money
Sugar, sugar
What you wanna do?

Would you like the truth?
Or why she is with you?
For your money, money
Mr. money, money
Or would you much prefer
For me to lie as her?
For your money, money
Mr. money, money...
