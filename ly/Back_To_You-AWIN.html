		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're fading out
The well is dry
The flame has gone with the winter
Your touch is cold
You don't respond
You stripped my life out of the color

I would've followed you into the ocean blue
Give my devotion to nobody but you
I would've followed you into the ocean blue
Into the ocean blue

Cause I've been losing
All the love that
That you gave me
Oh I'm sorry
It's so hard to
Love somebody
When you hate yourself too
But I hate who I am without you even more
So I'll change everything about me
If that gets me back to you

You
Back to you
You

The day I knew
That we were through
Was the day you stopped telling me I love you
Cause you always do
But we both knew
That it was over

I would've followed you into the ocean blue
Give my devotion to nobody but you
I would've followed you into the ocean blue
Into the ocean blue

Cause I've been losing
All the love that
That you gave me
Oh I'm sorry
It's so hard to
Love somebody
When you hate yourself too
But I hate who I am without you even more
So I'll change everything about me
If that gets me back to you

You
Back to you
You
