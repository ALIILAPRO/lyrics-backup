		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I die
Scatter my ashes
But not too close to the sea
Cause I can't swim

When I die
Mail all my postcards
Cause there's no address to return to
Anymore anyway

And if the world hasn't burned by then
If the sky's still blue

I will always wake
For the sunrise
Even though I'm s'pposed to sleep
For forever

And I will always wait
For the encore
Even though I'm s'pposed to
Go home

When I die
Bury my ashes
So I can grow into a tree
Maybe a redwood

When I die
Leave me a notebook
So I can write when I'm sad
Or feel a heart full of love

When I die
Buy me a house in the clouds
With extra rooms and a bar
For when my friends all arrive

When I die
Sell my piano
To someone else's little kid
So they can learn Rachmaninoff

And if the world hasn't burned by then
If the sky's still blue

I will always wake
For the sunrise
Even though I'm s'pposed to sleep
For forever

And I will always wait
For the encore
Even though I'm s'pposed to
Go home

Do we finally get signal from inside the subway?
Do we ever get tired of long summer nights?
Are they done building buildings at ungodly hours?
And when I return will you greet me with flowers?

And I will always wake
For the sunrise
Even though I'm s'pposed to sleep
For forever

And I will always wait
For the encore
Even though I'm s'pposed to
Go home
