		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’ve been thinking too much lately
Just praying you could come and save me
I feel like I am suffocating
Sinking to the bottom, don’t know if I can keep on waiting

Always running with the wrong crowd
Fake friends, bad habits, and they talk loud
Always caught up in the drama, but I never even wanna
Add to it, never hit em with the call out, yeah

I’m sick of feeling all alone
Too many people in my phone
That I don’t even really know 

I’m looking for serenity
So baby be my remedy
Too many friendly enemies
They’re taking every piece of me

I’ve been thinking too much lately
Just praying you could come and save me
I feel like I am suffocating
Sinking to the bottom, don’t know if I can keep on waiting

All these empty faces always circle me
All these crowded spaces make me sick
I go through these phases every couple weeks
Can’t even get myself out of this bed

I just wanna be alone now
Too bad, guess I gotta check the phone now
Feel like every situation is another expectation,
Fuck that, I can’t do this on my own now

I try to give my everything
To people that I’ll never meet
I feel like I can barely breathe

I’m looking for serenity
So baby be my remedy
Too many friendly enemies
They’re taking every piece of me
 
I’ve been thinking too much lately
Just praying you could come and save me
I feel like I am suffocating
Sinking to the bottom, don’t know if I can keep on waiting
