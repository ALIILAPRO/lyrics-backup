		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All of the time (you call on me)
All of the time (you needed me)
All of the time (you call on me)
All of the time

You never know
When I'm feeling low
Never talk
You're laying low
Better off
I'm beaming up

(Darling, darling)

Heaven ain't
Big enough
It's evident
I guess it's true
You never did
What you had to do

(And if you want, I'll come back and meet you there)

All of the time (keep telling me)
All of the time (you needed me)
All of the time (keep telling me)
It's all alright, it's all alright

Why don't we talk in the morning
Want you to need me my love
Could it be easy for us?

(It's all alright)

Heaven ain't
Big enough
It's evident
I guess it's true
You never did
What you had to do

(And if you want, I'll come back and meet you there)

All of the time (keep telling me)
All of the time (you needed me)
All of the time (keep telling me)
It's all alright, it's all alright

All of the time (keep pulling back)
All of the time (I'm telling the truth)
All of the time 
(I'm trying to be strong enough, not strong enough, no)

All of the time (keep telling me)
All of the time (you needed me)
All of the time 
(I'm trying to be strong enough, not strong enough, no)

All of the time (you call on me)
All of the time (you needed me)
All of the time (you call on me)
All of the time
