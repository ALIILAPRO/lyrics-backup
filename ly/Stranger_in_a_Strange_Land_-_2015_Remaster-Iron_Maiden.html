		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Was many years ago that I left home and came this way
I was a young man full of hope and dreams
But now it seems to me that all is lost and nothing gained
Sometimes things ain't what they seem

No brave new world 
No brave new world
No brave new world 
No brave new world

Night and day I scan horizon, sea and sky
My spirit wanders endlessly
Until the day will dawn and friends from home discover why
Hear me calling, rescue me

Set me free
Set me free
Lost in this place
And leave no trace

Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped into this prison, yeah
Lost and far from home

One hundred years have gone and many came
They came that way
To find the answer to the mystery
They found his body lying where it fell on that day
Preserved in time for all to see

No brave new world 
No brave new world
Lost in this place
And leave no trace

What became of a man that started?
All are gone and their souls departed
Left me here in this place
So all alone

Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home

What became of a man that started?
All are gone and their souls departed
Left me here in this place
So all alone

Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home

Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home

Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home

Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
