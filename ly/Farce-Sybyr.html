		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh
What you want?
Everything in a dunce
Everything in a blur
I barely hear words
How I want it now?
Energy a thousand
Don't plunge in the ground
Resting with no sound there
Smoking on spirits
I don't see spirits
I don't see white light
Would you rather me near it?
Yeah I like the sun
Put the night be packed up
It can go on and on
Part of me wanna wrap it up

What a farce
See the stars above these cars
Charge a fee
Get in quick
Live it large
Quite essential just to get it for tomorrow
Growin' steady
Can't be eaten by no storm
What a farce
See the stars above these cars
Charge a fee
Get in quick
Live it large
Quite essential just to get it for tomorrow
Growin' steady
Can't be eaten by no storm (By no storm)
Can't be eaten by no stooorm (By no storm)
Can't be eaten by no stoooormmm (By no storm)
Can't be eaten by no storm (By no storm)
Can't be eaten by no stooorm (By no storm)
By no storm
By no storm
By no storm
Aye
