		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Haven't they worked hard, to deserve nice places
cnd the open road, filling in the spaces
clways thought that you'd move on, but you never learned how
clways thought you would be in love by now
You could never really be
What you never really wanted to be
You never had the drive
Well you spent the week, the long overdraft
When you noticed the first, couldn't open the last
But you know what it said, you were afraid to look
You should have known better, should have had what they took

You could never really be
What you never really wanted to be
You never had the drive
