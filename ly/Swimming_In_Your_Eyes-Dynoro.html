		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your secrets and your lies
Ocean deep, blue skies
Baby, I fall deep in for ya
I'm coming for ya
So throw me overboard
I'm swimming in your eyes
Swimming in your eyes
Ooh, and baby, I fall deep in for ya
I'm coming for ya
So throw me overboard
I'm swimming in your eyes

All those nights I felt alone
You gave me somewhere, baby, I do belong
In your eyes, I pray you will let me stay
In your eyes
All those nights I felt alone
You gave me somewhere, baby, I do belong
In your eyes, I pray you will let me stay
In your eyes, eyes

In your eyes, eyes
In your eyes, eyes

Baby, our demise
Is somewhere down the line, oh 
But, baby, I fall deep in for ya
I'm on your shoulder
Your tears are golder
Than golden painted skies
Drowning in your lies, mmm, yeah
Baby, I fall deep in for ya
I'm on your shoulder
Your tears are golder
Than golden painted skies

All those nights I felt alone
You gave me somewhere, baby, I do belong
In your eyes, I pray you will let me stay
In your eyes
All those nights I felt alone
You gave me somewhere, baby, I do belong
In your eyes, I pray you will let me stay
In your eyes, eyes

In your eyes, eyes
In your eyes, eyes
