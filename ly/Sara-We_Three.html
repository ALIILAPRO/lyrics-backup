		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Little Sara, you're a diamond in the rough
And I know that you don't hear this all enough
And I'm sure that's why your wrists have tons of cuts
And I'm sure that's why you think you're not enough
On your nineteenth birthday you thought that you were done
Tons of people in your home, but it only felt like one
'Cause your brain can only think about the waiting loaded gun
But your friends are all still here, so pretend you're having fun
All your friends they wanna drink 'cause it's your birthday
But you've been drinking straight probably since last Thursday
Drinking is the only thing that makes you feel just okay
It keeps the trigger finger off the trigger and at bay
Your mind can only think about the things it shouldn't
Your brain is filled with thoughts of wishing that ya didn't
Little Sarah, perk your ears up try to listen
But she can't hear a sound because she's locked in a prison

She can barely see the pavement, she can barely read the signs
People think she's complicated but never wanna look inside
'Cause she's a little too R-rated and they're a little too damn blind
She's just looking for her angels, but they're a little hard to find

Mm, mm, mm

Little Sara, you've been skipping out in class
And any minute now your friends are gonna ask
Why the hell you're always acting sorta sad
Why the hell your weed just never seems to last
But the truth is you don't wanna let your secret out
'Cause they think it's wrong for you to take a different route
All except your mom too bad that she's just not around
And don't get me wrong those words you've tried to get them out
But their views been skewed by their plastic news from their plasma tubes 
So they won't fit in your shoes
Except for Sunday blues, but you got Monday blues
You got Tuesday blues, damn every day ya might lose
All your friends they wanna smoke 'cause it's a Friday
But you've been smoking straight probably since last Sunday
I know you know you shouldn't say that you are okay
But you still look 'em in the eye and lie then go to use your ashtray

She can barely see the pavement, she can barely read the signs
People think she's complicated but never wanna look inside
'Cause she's a little too R-rated and they're a little too damn blind
She's just looking for her angels, but they're a little hard to find

Mm, mm, mm 

Little Sarah, last night you got it bad
In that moment you could barely even add up two or three reasons why you're glad
And I guess that's why you grabbed your pen and pad
It was 6:14 and you could barely even read
All the words you'd written down of why it was time for you to leave
Your phone was on the ground and you could barely hear it ring
Couldn't even hear a sound, couldn't feel a single thing
Now, it's 6:15 and you're on your knees, blood is on your sleeves
And your lungs won't breathe, eyes are watering, body's shivering 
And you're wondering what is happening
Now, it's 6:23, and they're on their knees, begging Jesus please 
Can you make her breathe
'Cause they finally see what was happening underneath their nose 
And underneath your sleeves

Mm

She can barely see the pavement, she can barely read the signs
People think she's complicated but never wanna look inside
'Cause she's a little too R-rated and they're a little too damn blind
She's just looking for her angels, but they're a little hard to find
