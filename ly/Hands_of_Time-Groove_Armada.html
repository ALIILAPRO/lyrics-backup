		<p>
		  Keep looking through the window pane 
Just trying to see through the pouring rain
It's hearing your name, hearing your name
I never really felt quite the same, since I've lost what I had to gain

No one to blame, no one to blame
Seems to me, can't turn back the hands of time
Oh it seems to me, can't turn back the hands of time

No one to blame, no one to blame
Seems to me, can't turn back the hands of time
Oh it seems to me, can't turn back the hands of time

Seems to me, can't turn back the hands of time
Oh it seems to me, can't turn back the hands of time
Seems to me, history was left behind
