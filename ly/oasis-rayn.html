		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are my steady oasis
When all the rivers are running dry
I know were going through changes
But our love will stay the same

You are my steady oasis
When all the rivers are running dry
I know were going through changes
But our love will stay the same

You are my steady oasis
I know were going through changes
You are my steady oasis
When all the rivers are running dry
I know were going through changes
But our love will stay the same, same
Same, same
But our love will stay the same, same
Same, same
