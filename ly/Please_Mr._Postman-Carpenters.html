		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Stop)
Oh yes, wait a minute
Mr. Postman
(Wait)
Wait Mr. Postman

(Please Mr. Postman look and see)
Oh yeah
(If there's a letter in your bag for me)
Please, please, Mr. Postman
(Why's it takin' such a long time)
Oh yeah
(For me to hear from that boy of mine)

There must be some word today
From my boyfriend so far away
Please Mr. Postman look and see
If there's a letter a letter for me

I've been standin' here
Waitin' Mr. Postman so patiently
For just a card or just a letter
Sayin' he's returning' home to me

Mister Postman
(Mister Postman look and see)
Oh yeah
(If there's a letter in your bag for me)
Please, please, Mr. Postman
(Why's it takin' such a long time)
Oh yeah
(For me to hear from that boy of mine)

So many days you passed me by
See the tears standin' in my eyes
You didn't stop to make me feel better
By leavin' me a card or a letter

Mister Postman
(Mister Postman look and see)
Oh yeah
(If there's a letter in your bag for me)
Please, please, Mr. Postman
(Why's it takin' such a long time)
Why don't you check it and see one more time for me
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute Mr. Postman
Ooh Mr. Postman
(Mr. Postman look and see)
C'mon deliver the letter, the sooner, the better
Mr. Postman
Aaah
