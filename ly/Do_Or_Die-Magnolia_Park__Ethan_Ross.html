		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die young
It's a fight to survive
We're suicidal
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die young
It's a fight to survive
We're suicidal (aye, aye, hey)

I walk in the building to burn it
Setting a fire they all getting murdered
I'm feeling my demons returning
Fuck up again and I'm guess I'm not learning
Got the opposition nervous
Y'all are really only tough on the surface
I'm living through all of these curses
Bringing the pain and they know that I'm hurting
Not affectionate, my face is still expressionless
Take his head off clean
Sleepy Hollow, I'm collecting it (hell yeah)
Messing with a king, hit the dirt, you gon' rest in it
I'm meant for this
You try to take it from me blow your head to bits

It's do or die
We live to fight, so
Don't let me drown
Don't let me drown
Don't let me drown
Don't let me drown
We'll breach the skies
It's flooding in my mind
Don't let me drown
Don't let me drown
Don't let me drown

Yeah, I think I got a problem why I'm always in my head
Really going back to my old ways
Running so low on the tolerance all of the stress
I'ma go back and forth, slamming my fists
I'm losing it again
All of the hate makes it feel like love
And I can't even trust any of my friends
Damn

I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die young
It's a fight to survive
We're suicidal
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die young
It's a fight to survive
We're suicidal

(I don't wanna die)
(I don't wanna die young)

It's do or die
We live to fight, so
Don't let me drown
Don't let me drown
Don't let me drown
Don't let me drown
We'll breach the skies
It's flooding in my mind
Don't let me drown
Don't let me drown
Don't let me drown

Kill a motherfucker, burn a motherfucker, that's right
Kill a motherfucker, burn a motherfucker, that's right
Kill a motherfucker, burn a motherfucker, that's right
Kill a motherfucker, burn a motherfucker, that's right

Kill 'em
Put your motherfuckin' hands up

No remedy for all this pain
We live to fight so come try me
No remedy for all this pain
We live to fight so come try me

It's do or die
We live to fight, so
Don't let me drown
Don't let me drown
Don't let me drown
Don't let me drown
We'll breach the skies
It's flooding in my mind
Don't let me drown
Don't let me drown
Don't let me drown
