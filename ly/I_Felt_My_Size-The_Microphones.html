		<p>
		  I FELT MY SIZE

The heat from the closeness of me tilting towards the sun was storing up to ignite at night and light up the coldness of the cave. The billowy flames lit up my face and thinning smoke hung in the branches waiting for wind.
My front was warm
but cold backs of my arms
never felt the dawn
and the night was long.
When the real dawn came I saw it crawl over the hill and I felt clean and shook my hair out in the light. I looked up and hurt my eyes on the painful powerful sky, I looked down and felt motion under me churning. I looked out across the freeway at the people flying by and turned my head, I closed my eyes, I felt my size.
I recalled my fire
and my lack of dawn
my one sided warmth:
I’d just wanted more
but I’m small. I’m not a planet at all.
I’m small.
We’re all.
