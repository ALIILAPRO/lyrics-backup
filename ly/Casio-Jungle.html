		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Casio, playing on my heart just like a Casio
Breaking it apart so you can let it go
Wait another year, that's not original or cynical
Alright, let's go now

When all your dreams are gone
And you're still holding on
You waited far too long
Don't say
I know, you know it's over

Play it cool
I just want the keys back to my vehicle
They're just gonna tell you that it wasn't real
And I just wanna tell you this how I feel
I know you feel
I know you feel it 

When all your dreams are gone
And you're still holding on
You waited far too long
Don't say
I know, you know, it's over

Casio, playing on my heart just like a Casio
Breaking it apart so you can let it go
Wait another year, that's not original or cynical
Alright, let's go now

When all your dreams are gone
And you're still holding on
You waited far too long
Don't say
I know, you know, it's over

When all your dreams are gone
And you're still holding on
You waited far too long
Don't say
I know, you know, it's over

Don't think that my love is gone
It's all up in your head now
Don't think that my love is gone
It's all up in your head now
(Alright, let's go now)
Don't think that my love is gone
It's all up in your head now
(Alright, let's go now)
Don't think that my love is gone
(Casio, alright, let's go now)
It's all up in your head now

When all your dreams are gone
And you're still holding on
You waited far too long
Don't say
I know, you know it's over

When all your dreams are gone
And you're still holding on
You waited far too long
Don't say
I know, you know it's over

Don't think that my love is gone
It's all up in your head now
Don't think that my love is gone
It's all up in your head now
Don't think that my love is gone
It's all up in your head now
Don't think that my love is gone
It's all up in your head now
