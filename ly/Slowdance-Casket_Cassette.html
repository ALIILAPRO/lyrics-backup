		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something in the way
The lights hit your face
All alone and strange
Pull me close to your waist
All I need's a dance with you
It's all I really want, want to do
All I need's a dance with you
It's all I really want, want to do
Shadows start to stray
Trace the outline of my face
So much time to waste
But for now it's your embrace
All I need's a dance with you
It's all I really want, want to do
All I need's a dance with you
It's all I really want, want to do
