		  There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above, mmm-hmm
Oh, I lose control, can't seem to get enough, uh-huh
When I wake from dreaming, tell me, is it really love?

Ooh, how will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

Oh, wake me, I'm shaking
Wish I had you near me now, uh-huh
Said there's no mistaking
What I feel is really love

Ooh, tell me how will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

If he loves me
If he loves me not
If he loves me
Ooh, if he loves me not
Hey, if he loves me
If he loves me not

Oh, how will I know, how will I know?
How will I know?
Hey, how will I know?

Ooh, how will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you 'cause you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

How will I know? (How will I know?)
How will I know?
How will I know? (I say a prayer)
How will I know?
Ooh, how will I know? (I fall in love)
How will I love, hey, how will I know? (I'm asking you)
