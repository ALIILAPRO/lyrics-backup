		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me, lately
Is there something I can do?
To make you touch me
Like the way you used to

How many nights before you take me
Back to the moment where I felt your love?
You showed me the way, but baby, lately
I can't say you've been the best
I'll go get some while you take a rest

99 nights go by
How am I supposed to feel alive?
99 nights go by
Baby, that shit don't fly
99 nights go by
How am I supposed to feel alive?
99 nights go by
Baby, that shit don't fly, oh

Tell me, lately
Is there something I can do?
To make you touch me
Like the way you used to

Feels like you're away when we're together
I'm starting to pray you're not forever gone
I ask you to stay a little longer
But, babe, you never see the signs
Killing myself tryna keep your mind

99 nights go by
How am I supposed to feel alive?
99 nights go by
Baby, that shit don't fly
99 nights go by
How am I supposed to feel alive?
99 nights go by
Baby, that shit don't fly, oh

Tell me, lately
Is there something I can do?
To make you touch me
Like the way you used to

Or am I looking for something
That you could never give me at all?
So tell me, baby
Is there something I can do?
Is there something I can do?
Is there something I can do?
