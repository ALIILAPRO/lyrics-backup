		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Since you left
I give my breath to cigarettes
Since you left, I try my best to forget
I can't escape the love we made
It follows me i can't escape from your love

And I've been rolling the
Dice with Aphrodite
Spendin' my nights without you beside me
Throwin' some darts in bars with
The queen of hearts, queen of hearts

And I've been drinking with Cupid
Thinking of you, babe, thinking of you, babe
Oh how can I be so stupid?
If I didn't lose it, if I didn't lose it
Woah i've been spinning the bottle

I've been drinking with Cupid
Thinking of you, babe, thinking of you, babe
Oh dee dum dum, dee dum dum doo ooh, ooh

And sincе you left
I try my best to turn the page

I can't erase the way your
Face lit up this place
I can't escape from your face

And I've been rolling the
Dice with Aphrodite
Spendin' my nights without you beside me
Throwin' some darts in bars with
The queen of hearts, queen of hearts

And I've been drinking with Cupid
Thinking of you, babe, thinking of you, babe
Oh how can I be so stupid?
If I didn't lose it, if I didn't lose it
Woah i've been spinning the bottle

I've been drinking with Cupid
Thinking of you, babe, thinking of you, babe
Oh dee dum dum, dee dum dum doo ooh, ooh

And I've been drinking with Cupid
Thinking of you, babe, thinking of you, babe
Oh how can I be so stupid?
If I didn't lose it, if I didn't lose it
Woah i've been spinning the bottle

I've been drinking with Cupid
Thinking of you, babe, thinking of you, babe
Oh dee dum dum, dee dum dum doo ooh, ooh
Dee dum dum, dee dum dum doo ooh, ooh

And I've been drinking with Cupid
Thinking of you, babe, thinking of you, babe
Oh how can I be so stupid?
If I didn't lose it, if I didn't lose it
Woah i've been spinning the bottle

I've been drinking with Cupid
Thinking of you, babe, thinking of you, babe
Oh dee dum dum, dee dum dum doo ooh, ooh
Dee dum dum, dee dum dum doo ooh, ooh
