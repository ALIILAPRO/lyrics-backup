		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Aye, I told that bitch I count my cake, bitch get out my face
.45 on my waist, boy get out my way
Goyard on my waist, boy you ain't got taste
Now I'm getting cake, now your bitch gon' let me

Like oh goddamn, that's the bitch that I want
Oh goddamn, diamonds all in my fronts
Like 7 AM I was fucking your love
11 AM, you took that bitch right to brunch

Like oh goddamn, that's the bitch that I want
Oh goddamn, diamonds all in my fronts
Like 7 AM I was fucking your love
11 AM, you took that bitch right to brunch

Like oh goddamn, that's the bitch that I want
Oh goddamn, diamonds all in my fronts
Like 7 AM I was fucking your love
11 AM, you took that bitch right to brunch

Like I lost a lot of friends, but who give a fuck?
I got the money, now that's all that I want
She ate me for lunch, feel like 2Pac I'mma thug
Know some Crips and Bloods, Xannies, brought them drugs
Got a lot of people banking on me
Tell me why these niggas always hating on me
Coming home, they be waiting on me
Like jump off my dick, all that faking homie

Like oh goddamn, that's the bitch that I want
Oh goddamn, diamonds all in my fronts
Like 7 AM I was fucking your love
11 AM, you took that bitch right to brunch

Like oh goddamn, that's the bitch that I want
Oh goddamn, diamonds all in my fronts
Like 7 AM I was fucking your love
11 AM, you took that bitch right to brunch

Like fuck nigga, like can you leave me 'lone?
Made a million by myself, yeah that be my song
Like yeah I rock designer when I'm in my zone
Yeah I fucked your mama, I'm on my VLONE
Say I'm higher than a drone, boy you is my clone
Your mama a crackhead, I sold that bitch some stones
Now these bitches want me, I feel like I'm Mike Jones
281 330 8004
Catch me lean spilling while I'm lane switching
Drop the top, cocaine ceiling
Backwood, propane peeling
Say my name in it, now your chain missing
Had a lot of friends and a lot of homies
Now I'm higher, now they all salty
Tell them niggas get the fuck up off me
Now I'm higher, now they all salty

Like oh goddamn, that's the bitch that I want
Oh goddamn, diamonds all in my fronts
Like 7 AM I was fucking your love
11 AM, you took that bitch right to brunch

Like oh goddamn, that's the bitch that I want
Oh goddamn, diamonds all in my fronts
Like 7 AM I was fucking your love
11 AM, you took that bitch right to brunch
