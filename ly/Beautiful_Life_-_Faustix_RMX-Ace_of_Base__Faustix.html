		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can do what you want just seize the day
What you're doing tomorrow's gonna come your way
Don't you ever consider giving up
You will find, oh oh oh

It's a beautiful life, oh oh oh oh
It's a beautiful life, oh oh oh oh
It's a beautiful life, oh oh oh oh
I just want to be here beside you
And stay until the break of dawn

Take a walk in the park when you feel down
There's so many things there that's gonna lift you up
See the nature in bloom, a laughing child
Such a dream, oh oh oh

It's a beautiful life, oh oh oh oh
It's a beautiful life, oh oh oh oh
It's a beautiful life, oh oh oh oh
I just want to be here beside you
Oh yeah, oh right
I just want to be here beside you
And stay until the break of dawn

You're looking for somewhere to belong
You're standing all alone
For someone to guide you on your way
Now and forever

It's a beautiful life, oh oh oh oh
It's a beautiful life, oh oh oh oh
It's a beautiful life, oh oh oh oh
I just want to be anybody

We're living in different ways
It's a beautiful life
I'm gonna take you to a place
I've never been before oh yeah
It's a beautiful life
I'm gonna take you in my arms and fly away
With you tonight

Oh yeah, oh right
It's a beautiful life
Oh yeah, oh right
It's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life, oh oh oh oh
It's a beautiful life, oh oh oh oh
It's a beautiful life, oh oh oh oh
It's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life, oh oh oh oh
It's a beautiful life, oh oh oh oh
It's a beautiful life, oh oh oh oh
It's a beautiful life
