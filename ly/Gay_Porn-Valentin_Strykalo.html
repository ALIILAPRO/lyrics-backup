		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tears
Are falling down
And I can't run
From the feelings
Day we fell apart
Still in my heart
I was too silly
And now
You're with another guy
He seems to be better than I
These thoughts
Are still inside my head
And now everything I have is just

Gay-porn in the morning, gay-porn in the evening, gay-porn after lanch
That's how I killed my feelings
Gay-porn in the bathroom, gay-porn in the kitchen, gay-porn in the bedroom
That's how I spent my weekends
That's how I spent my weekends

Tears
Are falling down
And I can't run
From the feelings
Day we fell apart
Still in my heart
I was too silly
And now
You're with another guy
He seems to be better than I
These thoughts
Are still inside my head
And now everything I have is just

Gay-porn in the morning, gay-porn in the evening, gay-porn after lanch
That's how I killed my feelings
Gay-porn in the bathroom, gay-porn in the kitchen, gay-porn in the bedroom
That's how I spent my weekends
That's how I spent my weekends

And now
You're with another guy
He seems to be better than I
These thoughts
Are still inside my head
And now everything I have is just

Gay-porn in the morning, gay-porn in the evening, gay-porn after lanch
That's how I killed my feelings
Gay-porn in the bathroom, gay-porn in the kitchen, gay-porn in the bedroom
That's how I spent my weekends
That's how I spent my weekends
