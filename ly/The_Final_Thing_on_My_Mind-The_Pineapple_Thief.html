		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  oh this broken dawn light
when my shooting feels right
there's just one final thing on my mind

oh the mist of this dawn
the mist of a different dawn
the final thing on my mind?

every waking dawn it's you I see
coming back to me
everything you did is a part of me
ripped apart from me

how did we get to be this cold?
how did I let you get so far from me?
we got it so wrong
so wrong
how did we let it get this cold?

every waking dawn it's you I see
coming back to me
everything you did was a part of me
ripped apart from me

how did we get to be this cold?
how did I let you get so far from me?
we got it so wrong
so wrong
how did we let it get this cold?
