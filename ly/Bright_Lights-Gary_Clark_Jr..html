		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woke up, woke up in New York City
Lying on the floor
Just outside of Marcy's, West 54, wow

You gonna know my name by the end of the night, yeah
You gonna know my name by the end of the night, well

Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
I don't care no, no
'Cause you don't care, no

Start off with the bottle
End it up with the bottle
Taking shots, waiting on tomorrow
Trying to fill up, what's hollow

You gonna know my name
You gonna know my name

Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
I don't care no
'Cause you don't care, no

Get lost in this city trying to find myself
I went up a different person
Came down somebody else
I know it ain't right
But it's song in my head
Wow I'm surprised that
I'm still alive I should be dead

Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
I don't care no, no
'Cause you don't care

Well you gonna know my name
Well you gonna know my name
Well you gonna know my name
Hey! You gonna know my name by the end of the night, well
