		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give me your heart and I'll show you how to feel
Send me your soul and you'll know what it is to be free
We all need a deeper purpose One that's true and bold
The only thing that could hurt us is the curse of the fold

I once knew a man who had fire in his eyes
Bloody right hand, he had taken his enemies lives
The past was his torture
The future held his hope
Until he chose his fortune has the curse of the fold

Although you may feel like giving up, it's not the only road
The path less often traveled holds the highest, the highest of hopes

Some used to say that I'd never scale this mountain
Now that I'm close they shut their eyes and draw their curtains
Those who don't believe will always encourage defeat
They'll scream and shout and scold for the curse of the fold

Although I felt like giving up, it's not the road I chose
The path less often traveled held the highest, the highest of hopes
