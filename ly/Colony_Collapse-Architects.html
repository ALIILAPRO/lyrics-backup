		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dear, oh dear, what a sorry state we're in.
We brought the battle, we saw the signs,
We've found ourselves two steps behind.

I'm counting days like they're running out.
There's ghosts in the water, so pray for drought.
(pray for drought)

This time there's nowhere to hide.
We're facing the firing squad side by side.
1986. This is full relapse.
Our latest apocalypse. 
This is colony collapse.

Give us the rope and we'll tie our own noose.
We truly believed all we touched turned to gold.
We were warned but we wouldn't be told.

I'm counting days like they're running out.
There's ghosts in the water, so pray for drought.

This time there's nowhere to hide.
We're facing the firing squad side by side.
They said the ocean's on fire.
Say it isn't true. 
Say it isn't true.
The truth never hurt so much.
Can we start anew? Can we start anew?

1986. This is full relapse.
Our latest apocalypse. This is colony collapse.
Colony collapse.

Dear, oh dear, what a sorry state we're in.
Dear, oh dear, what a sorry state we're in.

They said the ocean's on fire.
Say it isn't true. 
Say it isn't true.
The truth never hurt so much.
Can we start anew? Can we start anew?

This time there's nowhere to hide.
We're facing the firing squad side by side.
They said the ocean's on fire.
Say it isn't true. 
Say it isn't true.
The truth never hurt so much.
Can we start anew? Can we start anew?

1986. This is full relapse.
Our latest apocalypse. 
This is colony collapse.
