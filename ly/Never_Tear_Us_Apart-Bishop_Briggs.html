		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't ask me
What you know is true
Don't have to tell you
Oh, I love your precious heart

I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never ever tear us apart, oh

And we could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears
Oh, I told you
That we could fly
'Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why

I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never ever tear us apart, oh

And they could never ever tear us apart
Oh, oh, oh

I was standing 
You were there 
Two worlds collided
And they could never ever tear us apart 
Tear us apart, ooh woah
And they could never ever tear us apart
