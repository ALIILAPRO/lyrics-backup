		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What you see 
From where you are 
Is only what you want to see 

What you feel 
Has one way out 
It is not what we are meant to be 

What you say 
Are words I deny 
Reached my walls again 
Into what end? 

What you feel 
Has one way out 
It is not what we are meant to be
