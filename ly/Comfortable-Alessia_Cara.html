		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What happens to a flame when it burns out?
What happens to a love that's not new?
What happens when I'm no longer impressive?
Or when there's nothing left to learn about you?

See I used to wonder about you
What it would be like to love you
Now I've seen every hole in your heart
I'm used to loving slowly
But this time you already know me
I hope you like all the broken parts

Oh, we can't run away from the comfortable
'Cause it's inevitable in love, in love
Oh, it's time we make way for the comfortable
'Cause it's already comfortable in us, in us

Save the honeymoon
It's just a puppet show (puppet show)
They say nobody really makes it through (makes it through)
And though a part of me wishes that this was two July's ago
The rest of me is safer, here with you

See, I used to wonder about you
What it would be like to love you
But now I know you inside and out
I'm used to loving slowly
But it took you nothing to know me
What happens when I run out of parts? Yeah

Oh, I guess you could say that it's comfortable
And it's inevitable in love, in love
Oh, it's time we make way for the comfortable
'Cause it's already comfortable in us, in us

It turns out you think my favorite song's annoying
Turns out no one makes me sensitive like you
I used to be sad that the honeymoon's behind us
Until I realized that it means we made it through (oh-oh-oh-oh-whoa)

Oh, we can't run away from the comfortable
'Cause it's inevitable in love (yeah, in love), in love (in love)
Oh, it's time we make way for the comfortable (for the comfortable)
'Cause it's already comfortable (it's already comfortable) in us (in us), in us

Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
In the comfortable with you
