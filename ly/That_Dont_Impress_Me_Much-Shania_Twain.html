		  Ow
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart
But you've got being right down to an art
You think you're a genius, you drive me up the wall
You're a regular original, a know-it-all

Oh-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you're a rocket scientist

That don't impress me much
So you got the brain, but have you got the touch?
Now, don't get me wrong, yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

I never knew a guy who carried a mirror in his pocket
And a comb up his sleeve, just in case
And all that extra hold gel in your hair oughta lock it
'Cause Heaven forbid it should fall outta place

Oh-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you're Brad Pitt

That don't impress me much (oh, oh, ooh)
So you got the looks, but have you got the touch?
Now, don't get me wrong, yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much
And yeah

You're one of those guys who likes to shine his machine
You make me take off my shoes before you let me get in
I can't believe you kiss your car good night
Now come on, baby, tell me, you must be jokin', right?

Oh-oh, you think you're something special
Oh-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you got a car

That don't impress me much (oh, oh, ooh)
So you got the moves, but have you got the touch?
Now, don't get me wrong, yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night

That don't impress me much (that don't impress me)
Oh, oh no, you think you're cool, but have you got the touch?
Now, now, don't get me wrong, yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm on the long, cold, lonely nights
That don't impress me much
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

Okay, so what do you think, you're Elvis or something?
Whatever
That don't impress me
