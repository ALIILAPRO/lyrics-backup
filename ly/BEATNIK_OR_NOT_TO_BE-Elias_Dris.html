		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Life is as sharp as the blade of a knife
Violence's everywhere down the street
Madness is a blessing
it's the impulse and the beat

If you don't understand what I'm saying
You can beat it. You can fuck it
I'm the cancer of your world
And my weapons are my words

People are trapped in buildings
Made of blind windows and stones
I played the starving game
To became an ecstasy angel

If you don't understand what I'm saying
You can beat it. You can fuck it
I'm the cancer of your world
And my weapons are my words

If you don't understand what I'm saying
You can beat it. You can fuck it
I'm the cancer of your world
And my weapons are my words
