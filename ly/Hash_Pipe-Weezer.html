		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh
I can't help my feelings
I'll go out of my mind
These players out to get me
'Cause they like my behind
I can't love my business
If I can't get a trick
Down on Santa Monica where tricks are for kids

Oh
Come on and kick me
Oh
Come on and kick me
(Whoa, whoa)
Come on and kick me
(Whoa, whoa)
You've got your problems
(Whoa, whoa)
I've got my eyes wide
(Whoa, whoa)
You got your big Gs
I've got my hash pipe

Uh
I can't help my boogies
They get out of control
I know that you don't care
But I want you to know
The knee-stocking flavor is the favorite treat
Of men that don't bother with the taste of a teat

Oh
Come on and kick me
Oh
Come on and kick me
(Whoa, whoa)
Come on and kick me
(Whoa, whoa)
You got your problems
(Whoa, whoa)
I got my eyes wide
(Whoa, whoa)
You've got your big Gs
I've got my hash pipe
Oh, I've got my hash pipe

Uh

Oh
Come on and kick me
Oh
Come on and kick me
(Whoa, whoa)
Come on and kick me
(Whoa, whoa)
You got your problems
(Whoa, whoa)
I've got my eyes wide
(Whoa, whoa)
You've got your big Gs
I've got my hash pipe
Oh, I've got my hash pipe
Uh
And I've got my hash pipe
Uh
And I've got my hash pipe
