		  ITZY
Bebe, yo

Hello, my name is Stevie
Actually, I'm lying, it's really Bebe
It's the meds, so they make me really sleepy
Klonopin, my friend, yeah, she numbs the feeling
My doctor upped my dosage
My mom felt bad, so she sent me roses
Without it, I feel really hopeless
And five point seven of Americans know it

Whoa, I'm living and I'm dreaming
Trying to stay even, oh

No, I don't need your help
To make me sick, to make me ill
I don't need anybody else
'Cause I can break my heart myself
I don't need your help
Getting off of this carousel
I don't need anybody else
'Cause I can break my heart myself

Some days feeling like a misfit
Sometimes I might make a mess, but
Okay, I'm doing my best, 'cause I still wake up every day
Might need to take a vacation
To clear my mind, see new places
Issues won't fit suitcases
So I'm gonna be okay

Whoa, I'm living and I'm dreaming
Trying to stay even, oh
Whoa, I'm draining for no reason
Apologize, no feelings, oh

No, I don't need your help
To make me sick, to make me ill
I don't need anybody else
'Cause I can break my heart myself
I don't need your help
Getting off of this carousel
I don't need anybody else
'Cause I can break my heart myself

Ooh-hoo
Ooh-hoo
Ooh-hoo-ooh
'Cause I can break my heart myself

There's a jumper on
Hollywood and the 101 and I'm scared
I could be that one, but I'm not

Sometimes I think I could use some help
Sometimes I think that I'm better than anybody else
Back and forth, in and out of my shell
'Cause I can break my heart myself

I don't need your help
To make me sick, to make me ill
I don't need anybody else
'Cause I can break my heart myself
I don't need your help
Getting off of this carousel
I don't need anybody else
'Cause I can break my heart myself
