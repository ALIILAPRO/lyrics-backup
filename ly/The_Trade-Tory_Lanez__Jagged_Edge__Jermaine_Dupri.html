		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Analyzing now
Stand clear
Check the pulse
No shock advised
Analyzing now, stand clear

Feels like forever I've been waiting
Waiting just to get you back, yeah, yeah
You've been moving stingy with your time
Knowing that I put it all on the line
And all them fucking secrets
Girl they're working for me
Like I know you got that clean 
But you get dirty for me
(If no pulse, start CPR)
Never felt like I feel
And I'll fuck you right I will
You're fucking right, I will
I'll make it so no one could ever fuck you like I will
I know your type for real
I know you like to feel
All of the things I said I won't do, but tonight I will
All this Hennessy and more weezy get me right for real
Know I said it was easy to feel how you like to feel
Well, I'm your type for real
You know the hype is real
You know my situation
You got these bitches hating 
(Hating, hating, hating)
You just tell me, say when
Jumping through these obstacles to find my way in
And it ain't no Usher, but I'm a superstar
Now come get this and I'll show you who you are

When we take our time
'Cause I can't wait, no baby
Let me make your mind
'Cause I can't wait, I can't wait
Let me make your
Let me make your 
I can't wait (I can't wait, no)
Let me make your mind
(I can't wait, I can't wait)
(I can't wait)
Can't wait, can't wait (wait)
Can't wait, can't wait 
I can't wait

See (can't wait)
When you hear it nice and slow like this (I can't wait)
Y'all know what this is

Let me take my time
I won't waste, I won't waste
Let me take my time
Working it so good, baby
Hurting it so good, baby

Let me take my time
I won't waste, I won't waste
Let me take my time
Working it so good, baby
Hurting it so good, baby

It's so good, the way you touch it baby (I'm just saying)
It's so good when you say you love it baby (look)
(Tory Lanez) it's so good, you say you love the real 
I want the words for real
To tell you how I feel

Let's do that again
Let's be bad again
Got me faded
For you baby all the money
Cash and payments, I would trade it
Don't think that I don't, because I see it
I see it, I see it
Don't you go provoke it, 'cause I see it
I could feel it, and you need it babe

Let me take my time
I won't waste, I won't waste
Let me take my time
Working it so good, baby
Hurting it so good, baby

Let me take my time
I can't wait for it, I can't wait for it
Let me take my time
'Cause I can't wait, I can't wait
