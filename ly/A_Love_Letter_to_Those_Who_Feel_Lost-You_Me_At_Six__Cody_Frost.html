		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take it as it comes
When you're feeling lost
Take it as it comes
Take it as it comes

In the farmland, we used to call the shots
Now I'm taking them, just an afterthought
Running out of time, wish I could make it stop
All your working parts are my gateway drug

Take it as it comes
When you're feelin' lost
Take it as it comes
Take it as it comes

You're the light that's on, but no one is home
I wanna speed things up, but you take it slow
Find it hard to say what I mean to say
If I tell the truth, don't you walk away?

Take it as it comes
When you're feeling lost
Take it as it comes
When you've seen too much
Coming back's the hardest part
When your dreams have gathered dust
Take it as it comes
Take it as it comes

Coming back's the hardest part
When your world falls apart
I'm not giving up, giving up
I'm not giving up, giving up
I'm not giving up, giving up

And take it as it comes
When you're feeling lost
Take it as it comes
Yeah, take it as it comes

And take it as it comes
Coming back's the hardest part (coming back's the hardest part)
When your world falls apart (when your world, when your world)
I'm not giving up, giving up
I'm not giving up, giving up
I'm not giving up, giving up
