		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A goddess on a mountain top
Was burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love
And Venus was her name

She's got it
Yeah baby, she's got it
Well, I'm your Venus
I'm your fire at your desire
Well, I'm your Venus
I'm your fire at your desire

Her weapons were her crystal eyes
Making every man mad
Black as the dark night she was
Got what no one else had
Wow

She's got it
Yeah baby, she's got it
Well, I'm your Venus
I'm your fire at your desire
Well, I'm your Venus
I'm your fire at your desire

(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)

She's got it
Yeah baby, she's got it
Well, I'm your Venus
I'm your fire at your desire
Well, I'm your Venus
I'm your fire at your desire
