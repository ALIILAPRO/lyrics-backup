		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, she was fighting for something steady
And I was fighting her all fours, and ready for
Anything that felt too heavy
Got damn good at leading her on

But now she's gone
I let her go without a second thought
Now I'm the only one that can't move on
Still wanting it, still I'm wondering

If I would have chased her
Would have just tried
Wouldn't have felt the sting of a goodbye
If I would have set aside a little more time
And a lot more pride, would she still be mine?
I should have known better
Should have made the last call over the phone better
Should have been a little bit more of a go getter
Would have saved myself from a whole lot of hurt
If I would have chased her

I wouldn't be kicking myself
'Cause we'd be busy kicking dust on a dirt road wherever the wind blows
Instead I'm in hell
Watching her run and run and run and run

'Cause now she's gone
I let her go without a second thought
Now I'm the only one that can't move on
Still wanting it, still wondering

If I would have chased her, would have just tried
Wouldn't have felt the sting of a goodbye
If I would have set aside a little more time
And a lot more pride, would she still be mine?
I should have known better
Should have made the last call over the phone better
Should have been a little bit more of a go getter
Would have saved myself from a whole lot of hurt
If I would have chased her

Ooh, no, no
If I would have chased her
Yeah, yeah

I shoulda known better
Now I'm all alone sipping something to forget her
Knowing that it's probably gonna take me forever
'Til then I'll still be wanting it, still wondering

If I would have chased her, would have just tried
Wouldn't have felt the sting of a goodbye
If I would have set aside a little more time
And a lot more pride, would she still be mine?
I should have known better
Should have made the last call over the phone better
Should have been a little bit more of a go getter
Would have saved myself from a whole lot of hurt
If I would have chased her

Ooh, no
If I would have chased her
Yeah, yeah
If I would have chased her
