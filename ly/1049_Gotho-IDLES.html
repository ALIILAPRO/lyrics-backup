		  Woo

My friend is so depressed
He wishes he was dead
I swam inside his head
And this is what he said (woo)

Help me, help me
Won't someone set me free?
There's no right side of the bed
With a body like mine and a mind like mine

My friend is so depressed
She wanted to have sex
I pissed in the kitchen sink
As she slowly undressed

No way, no way
We never shall decay
We won't last five fucking minutes
With a body like mine and a mind like mine

I guess this is as far as she goes
I guess this is as far as we go
I guess this is as far as we go
I guess this is as far

My friend is so depressed
He wishes he was dead
I swam inside his head
And this is what he said

Help me, help me
Won't someone help me sleep?
There's no right side of the bed
With a body like mine and a mind like mine

My friend is so depressed
She wanted to have sex
I pissed in the kitchen sink
As she slowly undressed

No way, no way
We never shall decay
We won't last five fucking minutes
With a body like mine and a mind like mine

I guess this is as far as we go
I guess this is as far as we go
I guess this is as far as we go
I guess this is as far as we go
I guess this is as far as we go
I guess this is as far as we go

Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

I guess this is as far as we go
I guess this is as far as we go

My friend is so depressed
My friend is so depressed
