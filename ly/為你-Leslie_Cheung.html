		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Because of you
If ever you wondered if you touch my soul, yes you do.
Since I met you I'm not the same.
You bring life to everything I do.

Just the way you say hello
With one touch I can't let go
Never tought I'd fall in love with you.

(Chorus)
Because of you.
My life has changed
Thank you for the love and the joy you bring.
Because of you,
I feel no shame.

I'll tell the world it's because of you
Sometimes I get loney and all I gotta do is think of you
You captured something inside of me
You take all of my dreams come true

It's not enough that you love me for me
You reached inside and toughed me eternally
I love you best explains how I feel for you
(Chorus)

The magic in you eyes, true love I can't deny.
When you hold me, I just lose control.
I want you to know that I'm letting go.
You mean so much to me,
I want the world to see its because of you...

(Chorus)
