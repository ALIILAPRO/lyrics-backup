		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  These are desperate times
You know I hate this town, but I stay for you
Even if it hurts
You know it's coming straight from the heart
I might not go to church
But every now and then I still pray for you
I'll always sing this loud
So you can hear wherever you are

'Til there's no sand in the hour glass
Until our futures become our past
Until our youth's just a photograph, I live for you
I will run on to broken glass
I will stand in the burning grass
I'd set fire to everything I have
And it's for you

It's for you
It's for you

We were only kids
And everything was good, it was positive
Who turned out the lights
And how'd it ever get so dark
City to the beach
Don't recognise the streets when your home again
Until you see the people
And everything that made who you are

'Til there's no sand in the hour glass
Until our futures become our past
Until our youth's just a photograph, I live for you
I will run on to broken glass
I will stand in the burning grass
I'd set fire to everything I have
And it's for you

It's for you
It's for you
It's for you (it's for you, yeah)
It's for you
It's for you
It's for you
