		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got a wonderful feeling
That's ripe for being wrong
Lately the Lord's got me kneeling
It's been hard to get along

But when I've got you in the corner of my eye
All my moments are the same when day or night
I saw you twice before
Now I really wanna see you more

I played the game of heartbreak
The emptiness remains
But how much loneliness can a man take
'Til he tries to take the reins?

But when I've got you in the corner of my eye
All my moments are the same when day or night
I saw you twice before
Now I really wanna see you more

I know that I won't forget you
May not be wise
I might regret you

But when I've got you in the corner of my eye
All my moments are the same when day or night
I saw you twice before
Now I really wanna see you more

When I've got you in the corner of my eye
All my moments are the same when day or night
I saw you twice before
Now I really wanna see you more

I saw you twice before
Now I really wanna see you more

I saw you twice before
Now I really wanna see you more
