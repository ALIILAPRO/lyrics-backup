(D-roc)

Oh
Had you on my mind 'til this morning
My thoughts all around 'cause I don't know what I'm doin'
Know a lot of things wouldn't be fair to you
So I'm tryna keep this flowin' (oh)
Fuck around and catch me in that Rolls with some tissue
Shittin' on these niggas and I'm cryin' 'cause I miss you
For to give in, she just gotta hear I'm down, this shit pitiful
Why you keep me 'round and you feel like I ain't shit to you?
And, you knowin' that my love rare, you just treat it like it's bountiful
Out the blue, you get a cold stare, when I think of shit I sent to you
I just wonder is this really real
Or, you got somebody teachin' you?

Tell me if you love somebody (I do)
Tell me if you for somebody (I don't know)
She don't really love my body (oh, no)
She just wanna keep me from somebody (I know)

I don't have to think again, I'm all for you
Deeply love you, and I miss you
I miss touchin', I miss fuckin', and I
Tatted up my face again, I'm already ugly
And, you my bitch, you pretty, I don't want you in public

But, I just cut you loose and I do what I do
Let the bitch do what she please, I fly her out to Cancun
Break my heart, I'm sittin' here bleedin', my BM called me a fool
Jocin' off me 'cause she notice how I'm fucked up 'bout you
Got that Xanax yesterday, ran out by this morning
Fuck you mean? I buy that Wraith, I ain't runnin' out this money
Ride horses on my trail today, all way until it's snowin'
To me, she flew, when I got through, I cut her by this mornin'
Claimin' that she lovin' me and I know that she be thuggin' me
When this bitch be actin' ABC, I wan' drag this ho from D to Z
Somehow, you made me complete
But, I'm scared of you havin' my heart
She ain't never liked shit about me
She just wanted my bro from the start

Tell me if you love somebody (I do)
Tell me if you for somebody (I don't know)
She don't really love my body (oh, no)
She just wanna keep me from somebody (I know)

I don't have to think again, I'm all for you
Deeply love you, and I miss you
I miss touchin', I miss fuckin', and I
Tatted up my face again, I'm already ugly
And, you my bitch, you pretty, I don't want you in public

Oh
Had you on my mind 'til this morning
My thoughts all around 'cause I don't know what I'm doin'
Know a lot of things wouldn't be fair to you
So I'm tryna keep this flowin' (oh)
Fuck around and catch me in that Rolls with some tissue
Shittin' on these niggas and I'm cryin' 'cause I miss you
I just wonder is this really real
Or, you got somebody teachin' you?
