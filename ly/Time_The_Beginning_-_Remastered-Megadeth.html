		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Father time, I'm running late
I'm winding down, I'm growing tired
Seconds drift into the night
The clock just ticks till my time expires

You were once my friend
Now I know I can't tie your hands
The days I saved I couldn't spend
They fell like sand through the hourglass
No time to lose, no time to choose

Time taking time, it's taken mine
Scenes of my life seem so unkind
Time chasing time creeps up behind
I can't run forever, and time waits for no one
Not even me

An enemy I can't defend
My final place a deadly end
Life's just a speck in space
Dreams of an eternal resting place

I can't get any younger
Time has brutal hunger

Time taking time, it's taken mine
Scenes of my life seem so unkind
Time chasing time creeps up behind
I can't run forever, and time waits for no one, waits for no one
Not even me
