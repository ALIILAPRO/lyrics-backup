		  Ayy, baby 
I got a question

Baby, I wanna know what you see in me? (What?)
Tell me the truth, keep it a hunnid, keep it G with me (hunnid)
Ain't no love up in these streets, and life ain't promisin' (nah)
How many times that you got mad, or told me you done with me? (Every time)
All these hoes you think I'm talkin' to, mean nothin' to me (who?)
Hop on the jet, come with me, and come live comfortably (come)
I ain't bringin' my gang, you ain't bringin' your friends, we don't need no company (nah)
If I hit me a lick, and I told you I'm hot, would you go on a run with me? (Run)
Tryna check my phone and look at my messages, see who I'm messagin' (check it)
Make her real mad, but she can't find shit, and there ain't no evidence (none)
You say you love me, you say you want to be with me (me)
I'm askin' questions, and I need you to answer me (please)

I wanna know, I wanna know (ooh)
What you want from me? What you want from me?
Yeah, I wanna know (I wanna know)
'Cause if I plant the seed I want it to grow (want it to grow)

(Quavo)
I'ma plant this seed (plant this seed)
'Cause I want you to grow with me (let's grow)
If I don't see you in my dreams (in my dreams)
I won't ever go to sleep
In my right mind (in my right mind)
She show the right signs, yeah (ooh)
We all on FaceTime (FaceTime)
She askin', "Is that pipe mine?," Yep
If I had to do jail time (if I went to jail)
Is that pussy still mine? (Is it mine?)
If I was down to my last dime (woo, to my last)
Would you slide, go Bonnie and Clyde? (Slide, ooh-ooh)
You gotta' tell me

I wanna know (ooh)
What you want from me? What you want from me?
Yeah, I wanna know (I wanna know)
'Cause if I plant the seed I want it to grow (want it to grow)

(Offset)
Do not judge a thug (thug)
Do not judge the way I love
I know I fucked it up (I fucked it up)
You know pain is love
You tried to hang it up (but pain is love)
All on the blogs and shit
This fame and shit, get dangerous (dangerous)
What you want from me? (What you want?)
What you see in me? (What you see?)
'Cause I'm thuggin', chopper I'm huggin'
Niggas ain't real as me (grraow)
I'm wit' you fa sho' (fa sho')
Why you brin'in' up all the hoes that want your ass to go
You must be dumb or slow
You need some time to grow
I can make your bag grow (bag)
She makin' it clap slow
I bought her the Patek, it's rose gold (froze)
I don't trust these hoes
'Cause she wanna fuck in my Lambo' (skrrt)
Shorty would go, if I was down bad, no money to blow (shorty'd leave)

I wanna know, I wanna know (ooh)
What you want from me? What you want from me?
Yeah, I wanna know (I wanna know)
'Cause if I plant the seed I want it to grow (want it to grow)
