		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When a good girl gone bad
What you gonna do?
Run go meet her dad?
You don wanna do
Well this is Sauti Sol
Patoranking, world best yo watch this
Love confession (wah I say?)

She's a heart breaker
She bend over, back-breaker
Steaming hot, water vapor
I wanna date her
She's a heart breaker
She bend over, back-breaker
Steaming hot, water vapor (woii oii)
I wanna date her

So tell me why you do me so?
So tell me why you do me so
Baby me nah go let you go
Girl me nah go let you go
So tell me why you do me so?
Tell me why you do me so
Girl me nah go let you go
Swear me nah go let you go

Spend all mi cash

But you threw me pon trash
Oh you think seh me go leave you like that?
(No way)
Why you do me like that? Yeah

Girl I'm waiting on you
Even if them hating on you
But me never send them oh

In my life, I 
Never seen melanin so dark
You're a queen of the dance floor
Na your social life kwa Nairobi scene, baby
Would you put me in your diary?

In my life, I 
Never seen melanin so dark
You're a queen of the dance floor
Na your social life kwa Nairobi scene, baby

Steaming hot, water vapor

Steaming hot, water vapor (woii oii)

So tell me why you do me so?
Tell me why you do me so

Swear me nah go let you go

I think I saw you in a magazine
Or maybe on TV
Lakini up close we ni queen, you're a queen
And if you know me well
You'll know I don't kiss and tell
But I want you to myself, baby

In my life yo

You're the queen of the dance floor
Night socialite pon di Lagos scene, baby
Would you put me in your diary?

Body shaking like a tambourine all night
Inna mi head you ah di melody baby

In my life, I
Never seen melanin so dark
You're the queen of the dance floor
Na your social life kwa Nairobi scene baby
Would you put me in your diary

A heart breaker

Steaming hot, water vapor

She's a heart breaker
She bend over her back breaker
Steaming hot, water vapor
