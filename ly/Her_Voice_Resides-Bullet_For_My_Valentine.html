		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Our time has ended
I feel it's only just begun
And I'm frustrated
I can't believe you're not the one

My ears are bleeding
Her voice resides inside my head
And now I'm choking
(release this noose around my neck)

Will I just fall to pieces
Or am I alright?
To iron out my creases
You must lacerate me till they're done

These are my final words to you
I know you're listening can you hear me?
The time has come to say 'goodbye'
These are my final words, to you

The clock is ticking
My heart is bursting through my chest
And now I'm crying
(these tears are pouring off my face)

The chair is creaking
Her voice resides inside my head
And now it's over
(you put this noose around my neck)

Will I just fall to pieces
Or am I alright?
To iron out my creases
You must lacerate me till they're done

These are my final words to you
I know you're listening can you hear me?
The time has come to say 'goodbye'
These are my final words, to you

Heaven, where is my angel?
I need her now (holding me)
Heaven, where is my angel
I need her now
Holding me
Tonight

Will I just fall to pieces
Or am I alright?
To iron out my creases
You must lacerate me till they're done

These are my final words to you
I know you're listening can you hear me?
The time has come to say 'goodbye'
These are my final words, to you!
