		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe baby, I'll have you
Maybe baby, you'll be true
Maybe baby, I'll have you for me

It's funny honey, you don't care
You never listen, to my prayer
Maybe baby, you will love me some day

Well you are the one that, makes me glad
Any other one that, makes me sad
When some day, you'll want me
Well, I'll be there, wait and see ee ee

Maybe baby, I'll have you
Maybe baby, you'll be true
Maybe baby, I'll have you for me

Da da ta da da da da da da
Da da ta da da da da da da
Da da ta da da da da da da
Aughaa

Well you are the one that, makes me glad
Any other one that, makes me sad
When some day, you'll want me
Well, I'll be there, wait and see ee ee

Maybe baby, I'll have you
Maybe baby, you'll be true
Maybe baby, I'll have you for me

Maybe baby I'll have you for me
