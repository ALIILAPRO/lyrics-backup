		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  YEAH i've been playing back and forth
With the same girl
I'm a mess she the best and I can't let go
New year same me, but she all mine
I've been tryna give her kisses
Down her whole spine
Use to feel alone now she living in my mind
Got me feeling all blessed like all the time
(yeah, yeah)
(yeah)
Uh everybody in the world got a soulmate
Even if the stars fall you should still wait
And even if the wheels fall
You could still skate
Maybe we should learn to love
When the time comes
And let the past be the past
Cuz a grude is a nudge
And it hurts but it heals (yeah)
(yeah, yeah)
(yeah) uh sit back and let the
World do it's thing baby
I know you been craving love you a queen baby
I just wanna see you shine
Like some bling baby
And when the night hit's listen
To me sing baby
