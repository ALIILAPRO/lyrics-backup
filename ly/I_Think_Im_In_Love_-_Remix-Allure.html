		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah oh

Every time you're near baby
I get kinda crazy in my head for you
I don't know what to do

And oh baby
I get kinda shaky when they mention you
I just lose my cool

My friends tell me
Somethin' has come over me
And I think I know what it is

I think I'm in love
Boy I think that I'm in love with you
I've been doin' silly things when it comes to you
In love, boy I think that I'm in love with you
I've been tellin' all my friends what I feel for you

Just the other night baby, I saw you hangin'
You were with your crew
I was with mine too
You took me by surprise
When you turn and look me in my eyes
Boy you really blow my mind

I don't know what's gotten into me
But, God, I think I know what it is

In love, boy I think that I'm in love with you
I've been tellin' all my friends what I feel for you
I think I'm in love
Boy I think that I'm in love with you
I've been doin' silly things when it comes with you

Somethin' strange has come over me
Got me goin' out of my mind
Never met a guy like you before
You make me feel special inside

I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love

Boy I think that I'm in love with you
I've been doin' silly things when it comes to you
I think I'm in love
Boy I think I'm in love with you
I've been tellin' all my friends what I feel for you

Boy I think that I'm in love with you
I've been doin' silly things when it comes to you (goin' outta my mind)
I think I'm in love
Boy I think I'm in love with you
I've been tellin' all my friends what I feel for you

Boy I think that I'm in love with you
I've been doin' silly things when it comes to you
I think I'm in love
Boy I think I'm in love with you
I've been tellin' all my friends what I feel for you
