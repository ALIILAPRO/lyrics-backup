		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Life too private that my bitch gotta call back private
That's that star-sixty-seven when we ridin' with the top down
So you can't find out, I put two girls in the compound
Yet I'm going too sick, I'm too drowned out
If my bitches act up, put 'em time out
No, we'd never switch sides, but we side bounce
And I gave her dick for the night at the hideout
Haha, that ain't that life baby
She out here poppin' Ecstacy just for the vibrate
I want that pussy just for me, I'll put a tight chain
Come get my privacy and pull it out the driveway
Meet me all alone
Take you on a journey when you go
Safe
I will never let you be in harm's way
Baby, we don't have to get involved yet
Only when you meet me in private
In private
In private
Only when you meet me in private
In private
In private
Yeah yeah, uh
Sippin' on that Soju in the high tide
Make a private movie like the Sci-Fi
Smoking on Gelato, I'm so motherfuckin' sky-high
Twilight, no colors, no highlights
Sneak-dissin', bet I'll give your bitch the side eye, oh-woah
If she lookin' and she my type, oh-no
Haha, that ain't that life baby
She out here poppin' Ecstacy just for the vibrate
I want that pussy just for me, I'll put a tight chain
Come get my privacy and
Meet me all alone
Take you on a journey when you go
Safe
I will never let you be in harm's way
Baby, we don't have to get involved yet
Only when you
Meet me all alone
Take you on a journey when you go
Safe
I will never let you be in harm's way
Baby, we don't have to get involved yet
Only when you meet me in private
In private
In private
Only when you meet me in private
In private
In private
Only when you meet me in private
