		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey babe, it's written all over your face, say it
A hurricane behind the door
So I've come ready for a war

When you don't want coffee in the morning
I know I'm in a hole
It's hard enough to get you sober
Got no chance if I'm hungover
I ain't even woken up yet
Not nearly vertical
All know is I'm in trouble
'Cause atmosphere's so cold, so

Hey babe, it's written all over your face, say it
A hurricane behind the door
So I've come ready for a war

When I hear that thunder in the distance
I know it's getting close
You're giving me that silent treatment
Don't know what it's achieving
When we're finished saying nothing
Can we please get back to loving?
When it's good, it's really something
Can we please get back to us now?

Hey babe, it's written all over your face, say it
A hurricane behind the door
So I've come ready for a war
Hey babe, it's written all over your face, say it
So when you find out what we're fighting for
I'll be ready to talk

It's written all over your
It's written all over your face
It's written all over your
It's written all over your face
