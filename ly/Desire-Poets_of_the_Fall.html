		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fatal velocity, comes on with a rush, overpowering, gives the final push

What never moves, is never still, who has the final word
It holds the world in a single pill, and all life rendered absurd

Kill sweet desire, faith may numb the trial, but can you run all your life
Kill sweet desire, truth will make a liar, you can run but not hide
So run for your life

A false sincerity, a liar and a thief, my pulse and memory, a comfort within grief

What never moves, is never still, who has the final word
It holds the world in a single pill, and all life rendered absurd

Kill sweet desire, faith may numb the trial, but can you run all your life
Kill sweet desire, truth will make a liar, you can run but not hide

Given into this sensation, feel I've run too far
Cannot see beyond emotion, see what the options are
With no faith to trust the notion, I fear I'm losing all control

Kill...
