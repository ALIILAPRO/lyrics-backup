		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The goodbye is the hardest part
When we find ourselves back at the start
But I'm not so brave, and I'm not so smart, no
I'm doing you a favor, doing you a favor

One day you will understand
Why I pushed you away as I am
And you will find a better man than I am
Trust, I'm doing you a favor, doing you a favor
(Ooh)

Despicable
I'm just a bottom feeder (uh huh)
Despicable
I ain't never been a keeper (oh no)
Despicable
Love her then I leave her

And if I were you, I wouldn't love me neither
Said if I were you, I wouldn't love me neither

I wouldn't love me neither
Despicable

The boy who fell into the sky
Had no one there to watch him cry
He looked at you with his empty eyes and said:
"I'm doing you a favor, doing you a favor."
(Ooh)

Despicable
I'm just a bottom feeder (uh huh)
Despicable
I ain't never been a keeper (oh no)
Despicable
Love her then I leave her
And if I were you, I wouldn't love me neither

Said if I were you, I wouldn't love me neither

I wouldn't love me neither
Despicable

How I wish I told a different tale
Like we chased the light and his love prevailed
But his blood went cold and his skin went pale
She got a letter in the mail, said:
"I'm doing you a favor, doing you a favor"

Said: "If I were you, I wouldn't love me neither" (no)
Said: "If I were you" ("If I were you")
Said: "If I were you, I wouldn't love me neither"
