		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you see the smoke rising
From the bodies of the dead, dying?
Tell me, are you tired of the loss, lying?
Can you feel your fucking soul crying?

Carry the fire
There's darkness in us all
If we don't burn brighter
Who's gonna save our souls?
Save us
Save us

The whole damn world is ending
But they're pretending that everything is gonna be alright
These are your last days now
Will you stay down
Or will you rise above?

Carry the fire
There's darkness in us all
If we don't burn brighter
Who's gonna save our souls?
Save us

Whose side will you ride with?
Will you just stay silent?
Riot, riot
We won't stand in a line, compliant
Time for your fire
It's time for the riot (carry the fire)
 
There's darkness in us all
If we don't burn brighter
Who's gonna save our souls?
Save us
Save us
Save us
Save us
Save us
