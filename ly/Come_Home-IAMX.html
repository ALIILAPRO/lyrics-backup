		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I let you go
I saw the sings
You were so cold
I was unkind
You turned my lies
Into your lust
Now I just can't disguise
My failure to forget this stuff, because

Our little world is only big enough for us

Come home
I've lost the will to go on alone
Come home
I don't know what you want, but I know that you need to be loved

The desert skies
Will cry for us
In the land of forgotten smiles
Die our forgotten trust
The old desires
Burned in the sunshine and
All the years of our tender disunion
And I will always be here to hear you in the place where you belong

Come home
I've lost the will to go on alone
Come home
I don't know what you want, but I know that you need to be loved
