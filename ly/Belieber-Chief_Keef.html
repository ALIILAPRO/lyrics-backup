		  K.E. on the Track

Shawty said she was a dreamer
I turned they asses to a believer
My other bitch like Justin Bieber
I guess that bitch a belieber

I still remember my hoes
I bet they still remember micro
Wavy bitch off my grow
You only want me 'cause my life glows
All these bitches chasing after D
Tell these bitches, "Chase after cheese"
I forgot I'm the fucking G
I ride alot around, spending Gs
Who raised me, my momma granny
No actor, but I need a grammy
Taxing niggas Uncle Sammy
Girl you know I'm Sosa Sammy
I don't be off the molly, I just be off alot of weed
Pull up, crash the party
Shots at everybody
Can't be chasing these hoes
Gotta be chasing these rolls
I was dreaming until I woke
I ain't a dreamchaser, bitch, I just glo
Sosa, you be flexing, I know
Sosa, you keep weapons, I know
I ain't got a yacht, I got a boat
And that bitch is big as my home
I was locked up, Divison 4
Repping my set 'cause niggas hoes
I remember back in '94
Wait, I was born in '95 tho
Remember trapping just to get a coat
'Member trapping just to get some clothes
Now I buy anything I want
Anything I want in any mall
I ain't never been to Mexico
But I'm smoking on Texaco
Remember pilling out in 4 4s
Now I get 90 for four show
Jewelry and commas for a show
I threw it in the water and let it float
It's icy, like the fucking North Pole
I don't need no stylist for my wardrobe
Look, lady, I got the fucking pack
And I got the motherfucking sack
It's a lot of snakes in the grass
Watch out, they'll bite you in yo back
