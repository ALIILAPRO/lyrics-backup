		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I really need somebody, somebody, somebody
I really need somebody, somebody, somebody

Feelin' older than my years
But ain't it so when you've been staying home?
Bodies flingin' themselves around me
Getting dizzy on my feet
For the sane and purity
Silly bones, dancin' alone
City's been getting to me
Getting to me

I got nothin' to hide anymore and I still got my looks if I try
I don't know who I was bein' before, but I'm still tryna put out the fires
I don't know what it is about the world lately, yeah
But I really need somebody, somebody, somebody

I really need somebody, somebody, somebody
I really need somebody, somebody, somebody
I really need somebody, somebody, somebody
I really need somebody, somebody, somebody

All I need is clarity
Singing wings taking everything back
I was glued into my own shell
For a while
Jealous of the way you breathe
Effervescent and guiltfree
Lack of you has been getting to me
Getting to me

I got nothin' to hide anymore and I still got my looks if I try
I don't know who I was bein' before, but I'm still tryna put out the fires
I don't know what it is about the world lately, yeah
But I really need somebody, somebody, somebody

I really need somebody, somebody, somebody
I really need somebody, somebody, somebody
I really need somebody, somebody, somebody
I really need somebody, somebody, somebody
