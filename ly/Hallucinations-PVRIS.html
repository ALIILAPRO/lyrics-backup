		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Falling backwards
What comes after the words you said?
They knocked us from our high
I always thought we'd have another life
Dancing alone
Left in shadows
I paint you in the corner of my mind
Pull the colors from the rays of light

Close my eyes, I can't erase you
(I can't erase you)

Hallucinations, you occupy
My imagination's running wild
New sensations, sweet temptations
I can't tell what's real and what's

So much breakage
I see your face in blank spaces
I'm hearing voices out of my TV
Silent songs what they're singing to me

Close my eyes, I can't embrace you
(Embrace you, embrace you)
We're not close, but I still taste you
(Still taste you, still taste you)

Hallucinations, you occupy
My imagination's running wild
New sensations, sweet temptations
I can't tell what's real and what's
Hallucinations, they satisfy
Our imagination's running wild
New sensations, sweet temptations
I can't tell what's real and what's

Hallucinations, nations, nations
Hallucinations, nations, nations
Hallucinations, nations, nations
Hallucinations 
(I can't tell what's real and what's)

(Oh)
Hallucinations, you occupy
My imagination's running wild
New sensations, sweet temptations (I can't tell)
I can't tell what's real and what's

Hallucinations, nations, nations
Hallucinations, nations, nations
Hallucinations, nations, nations
Hallucinations
(I can't tell what's real and what's)
