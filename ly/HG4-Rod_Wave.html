		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  With the hand I was dealt, they probably thought that I'd be dead or in jail
Where I'm from, every day feel hotter than hell
Still gotta keep your heater when it's hot, I tell you (Yo, Keyz)
'Cause you don't wanna be stressed out in a hundred-degree weather
People love to talk down, say my name, but they don't know a thing
Every day, I'm thankin' God that my lifestyle changed
Every time I missed the bus, I walked to school in the rain
Know you love to hear my song, but is you feelin' my pain?
I used to log on the 'Book, see RIPs, man, this shit here ain't safe
I grabbed my tool and grabbed my books, we strapped down every day
Fatz say he ain't got no opps, so give me your flame
He crazy, cocked it back, then banged it 'fore he play with my name
I love to rap, but gettin' attention was my biggest of fears
This rap shit was just my dream, but I'm finally here
Soon as I bumped into the millions, bought my sister a whip
She used to let me borrow her bike to go hit me a lick
Remember my bed had bugs, so I slept on the floor
Take my pain out with that poker, go and kick me a door
In the 'partments with my partner, his grandma say I'm a demon
At the gas station, waitin', plottin', and schemin'
And I thought that my heart was in the trenches forever
My other partner killed his partner, changed my whole perspective
We all got twenty-four hours and one life to maintain
So get up off your ass, nigga, go-
It's all about grindin', fuck perfect timin'
Fuck maintainin', get rich or die tryin'
When it's you against the world, your back against the wall
You're down on your luck, tell me who can you call?
Your ho keep complainin', bitch won't shut the fuck up
Get the fuck out my face and shut the fuck up
Tell me who could I call when I was fucked up?
Tell me who can you call when you're fucked up? (Uh)
