		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Midnight strikes, where is my prince?
Lost my comfort, more time to think
Broken and bruised, tell me what I am
Feel so unused, help me find your hand

I guess the sun still waits here
Got to hold it up for him

Carry me home
Bear my weight on your shoulders
Carry me home
Nothing else matters
Carry me home
Bear my weight on your shoulders
Carry me home
And don't let go

Say, said I don't ever say things so you can heal
Yet I waited, all for your seas to fill
And now this bottle seems too hard to place down and leave
To help
And now I feel like I've become your pain
Yeah, darlin' won't be safe with me

Oh, I guess the sun still waits here, here
Got to hold it up for him

Carry me home
Bear my weight on your shoulders (no, oh I)
Carry me home
Nothing else matters
Carry me home
Bear my weight on your shoulders
Carry me home
And don't let go

I guess I'm still here waiting
Darlin', I'm sorry, I tried
I gotta hold it up for him
