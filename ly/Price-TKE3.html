		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Came into my life I'm saved by grace
You said I'm not defined by those mistakes
Cus you had bigger plan in place for me
I know it yes I know I know it yes I know
Even if you worked your whole life
You couldnt pay for your sins
Because the price way too high
And your pockets way too slim
Jesus gave his whole life
So we can live free of sin
Why on earth would I worry when my future is in him
Even if you worked your whole life
You couldnt pay for your sins
Because the price way too high
And your pockets way too slim
Jesus gave his whole life
So we can live free of sin
Why on earth would I worry when my future is in him
I know I know I know
I felt pain like everyday
With no solution darg
Surrounded myself around people couldn't be alone
I knew God he had a plan
I couldn't see it though
I was running to these riches
Hated living broke
Till he spoke to me
He said if I don't change my path
I'll lose the soul in me
And I can't do that
Since I found my purpose
I ain't had a reason to look back
That's God on my side
I can't lose that's fact
Ahh yeah ahh yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
My Light shine bright just like a chandelier
Blessed me and said Ill be a pioneer
New flow new sound when I appear
Gods very own say it boldly I don't stutter
I'm feeding my spirit like the soul food with the lobster
I'm blessed everything that my hand touches it prospers
Uh uh
Cook it up
Uh
Who is up
Uh it is us
Uh uh
Living love yeah
Look take it from me
As you grow you face some choices
And it's take it or leave it
See I took eternal life
And I don't know what defeat is
Game changer
Way maker
Your are now rocking with the trail blazer
