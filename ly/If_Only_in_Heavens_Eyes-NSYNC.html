		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never thought you were a fair-weather friend
You never let me down, you're true to the end
For in the darkest hour when all was lost
Somehow you left the light on
You faced the wrong and showed the world a thing or two
Stood up for me and for you

And you should know
Some say it wasn't worth the things we went through (things wewent through)
I say it ain"t worth losing you (losingyou)
I hope you know how much you've changed all our lives
(Someday)Someday you'll see
If only through heaven's eyes
Only through heaven's...

I still remember the things that you said
I keep your words alive, I could never forget
Cause in the final hour you made me proud
So proud that I could know you
Told the world it's time that they believed in you
You stood for right and truth

And you should know
Some say it wasn't worth the things we went through (things wewent through)
I say it ain't worth losing you(losing you)
I hope you know how much you've changed all our lives
(Someday)Someday you'll see
If on ly through heaven's eyes
Only through heaven's eyes

And so we can't forget
We've got to keep remembering
Them all(them all)
The ones who took the fall
They did it for us all

And we should learn from it
Stand up if you believe in it
You've got to face the world, be strong

Some say it wasn't worth the things we went through ( things wewent through)
I say it ain't worth losing you ( losing you )
I hope you know how much you've changed all our lives
(Someday)Someday you'll see
If only through heaven's eyes
Only through heaven's...

Some say it wasn't worth the things we went through (things wewent through)
I say it ain't worth losing you (losing you)
I hope you know how much you've changed all our lives
(Someday) Someday you'll see
If only through heaven's eyes
Only through heaven&#039;s...
