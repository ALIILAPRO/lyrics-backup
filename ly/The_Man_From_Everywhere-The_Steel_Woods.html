		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know how I got here
But I can't tell you why
And if I could
Neither one of us have got the time
 
I blame it on my habit 
Blame my habit on the road
But my girl of 30 years
Said I'm just reaping what I've sowed
 
This old town is full of money
It's been pretty good to me
But by now the ground is gettin' kinda warm beneath my feet 
 
No I ain't in trouble 
Not as far as I can tell 
It's just the longer I sit still 
The closer I can feel to Hell 
 
So I run and I hide 
I see what I can find 
But I'm never satisfied 
Maybe I'm just bad at chasing dreams
All the good I've ever had's a memory
I can't pack it up so I just up and leave it there
The Man From Everywhere

Well I started out in Georgia
It seemed like a pretty good place to leave
Everywhere I've been ever since then seems like it's leaving me

Oh the Sun will always find me
When I'm wakin' up with the Moon
Singing Yesterday's Wine
Like tomorrow's lonely tune
 
And I'll run and I'll hide
I see what I can find
But I'm never satisfied
Maybe I'm just bad at chasing dreams
All the good I've ever had's a memory
I can't pack it up so I just up and leave it there
The Man From Everywhere

So I'll run and I'll hide
I see what I can find
But I'm never satisfied
Maybe I'm just bad at chasing dreams
All the good I've ever had's a memory
I can't pack it up so I just up and leave it there
The Man From Everywhere
