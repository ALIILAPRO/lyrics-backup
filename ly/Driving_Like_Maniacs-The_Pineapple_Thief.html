		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I guess we'll never make it back from this road
We're driving like maniacs
With one last corner to go

And we had so many chances to ruin what we had

The rain comes up and shelters us from this road
And all who travelled it
Your hands fall and suddenly
There's one last corner to go

I gave you so many chances to ruin what we had

You and I
We were always destined to fall
As cold as I would be to ruin it all
I gave you nothing
I gave you up
For you and I

And so you took your chance to ruin what we had

You and I
We were always destined to fall
As cold as I would be to ruin it all
I gave you nothing
I gave you up
For you and I
