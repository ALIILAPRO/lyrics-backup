		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, as far as far as I remember
You've been here walking next to me
Just a friend I thought was all I needed
Now I realize what a fool I've been
Here I am the greatest of pretenders
Always looking but too afraid to see
That this feeling going on inside me
Is a love that's always meant to be

God I wish I was your lover
Why did I have to wait
Guess I'll always be the lover to late

Every time I see you
I'm aching, I'm breaking
If only I could tell you
You're more than a friend
If only I could show you
I love you forever
We'd never be apart
I could be the angel of your heart

There you go
Leaving with another
Days without you so hard to contemplate
If I count every lonely waking hour
Will I always be the lover too late?

Every time I see you
I'm aching, I'm breaking
If only I could tell you
You're more than a friend
If only I could show you
I love you forever
We'd never be apart
I could be the angel of your heart

(Every time)
Every time I think of you girl
(Ooo-ooo-ooooh)
Oh Oh - Oh Oh

God I wish I was your lover
Why did I have to wait?
Guess I'll always be the lover too late
Every time
Every time I see you
I'm aching, I'm breaking
If only I could tell you
You're more than a friend
If only I could show you
I love you forever
We'd never be apart
I could be the angel of your heart

(I see you)
(I'm aching, I'm breaking)
If only I could tell you
(you're more than a friend)
If only I could show you
I love you forever
We'd never be apart
I could be the angel of your heart

I could be the angel of your heart
(tell you you're more than a friend)
(show you I love you forever)
Forever
I could be the angel of your heart
Every time
Oooh
