		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  'Cause if tomorrow brings something good
Tonight I do it all for love, I do it all for love
If you want it, I know I could
Tonight I do it all for love, I do it all for love

Try to leave, try to fight
All the things inside my mind
But we will stay together
I try to push, try to part
Try to break us from the start
But I'll be yours forever

Oh I will follow you
Through the dark, through it all
And nothing I can do
Honey I'm set on you

'Cause if tomorrow brings something good
Tonight I do it all for love, I do it all for love
If you want it, I know I could
Tonight I do it all for love, I do it all for love

I'll get it out, find a way
Make you feel like you can stay
I shoulda known better
Need your touch now and then
When it all comes back again
I know I'll know better

Oh I will follow you
Through the dark, through it all
Oh there's nothing I can do
Honey I'm set on you

'Cause if tomorrow brings something good
Tonight I do it all for love, I do it all for love
If you want it, I know I could
Tonight I do it all for love, I do it all for love

All for love, oh
Tonight I do it all for love, I do it all for love
All for love, oh
Tonight I do it all for love, I do it all for love
