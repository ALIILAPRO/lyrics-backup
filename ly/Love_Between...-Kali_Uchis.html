		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love between two human beings
Can be so wonderful, wonderful (in love)
Love between two human beings
Can be so wonderful

Where would you like to spend eternity? (Ah-ah-ah)
If I bring you into my world, you'll never wanna leave
If you take away my air, how am I supposed to breathe?
Tell me, why would we be here if this ain't meant to be?
You know where to find to me (you know where to find to me)
Go on and call my number, I'll pick up
Yes, I will, oh, I will

Love between two human beings
Can be so wonderful, wonderful
Love between two human beings
Can be so wonderful

You make me happy (happy, happy)
You make my soul smile
You make me happy (happy, happy)
You make my soul smile
Wait a minute

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
