		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not tryin' to break the silence
Baby, I'm just tryin' to fix it
I been tryin' to show you the difference
You can slam the door, tell me that I'm like my mother
You don't need to tell me you're sorry
We don't need to talk 'til you're ready

It takes a lot more than a rose
More than a kiss, more than a heart

'Cause love is not enough
But at least we've got that much
Baby, lay your head down
You can sleep at my house
Whoa, 'cause love is not enough
But at least I've got your touch
The middle of a long night
We don't need it all right now, no

I'm not fragile as you think
Seems like you've been walkin' on eggshells
Didn't put them there when we first fell in love
When early days have faded
Everything gets complicated
You said you want a girl with a future
But everybody comes with a past

It takes a lot more than a ring
More than a vow, more than a promise

Love is not enough
But at least we've got that much
Baby, lay your head down
You can sleep at my house
Whoa, 'cause love is not enough
But at least I've got your touch
The middle of a long night
We don't need it all right now, no

Love is not enough
But it's all we're dreaming of
You can lay your head down
You can sleep at my house
Whoa, 'cause love is not enough
But at least I've got your touch
The middle of a long night
We don't need it all right now, no

We can take our sweet time
I think that we'll be just fine
