		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here I go again, it's time for me to fade away
I'm out of here, I go again, I've lost the game
And no one is to blame
Here I go again, it's time for me to face the world

I'm out of here, I go again
I've lost the game
And no one is to blame
Move on, believe it
And you'll find out this is the time of your life
Move on, believe it
You can be sure this is the ride of your life

Here I go again
Here I go again
Here I go again
And no one is to blame, but me

And it's time again to let the storm
Rise and I'll be waiting here with great expectations
You call it what you want but for now be standing tall
And now I'm here, I give it all so give me your best
Your best shot or let me go

Here I go again
Here I go again
Here I go again
And no one is to blame, but you
