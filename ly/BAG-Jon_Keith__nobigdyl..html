		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah

We gon' ride 'til we die, pick a side
Feel it right, I been in my bag
We gon' ride 'til we die, pick a side
Feel it right, I been in my bag
We gon' ride 'til we die, pick a side
Feel it right, I been in my bag
We gon' ride 'til we die, pick a side
Feel it right, I been in my bag

Look, hop in the whip or get out the way
Ain't no flip-floppin' over here
It's Nikes and J's
I got crowns on my hoodies
Purple blood in my veins
Saint Keith is the team, I'm just
The one with the face, Yeah
Text from Lil Holy, Holy, say
"Bro, we so dope, You know it"
I hit back and say we rich 'cause
The loud she gave me is goldie
So we can keep action off me
'cause God got my back
And I've been tapped with a
Need to keep the peace (Ooh ahh)
It's shaken me so easily, He eat with me
I been goin' (Ooh ahh)
I've been movin' on a
Different kind of level
Keep the peace with me like Dalai Lama, boy
We killin' devils i got buddies on buddies
But I stay with my ride or dies
No attention to the size, screw with 'Dyl
We takin' flight

We gon' ride 'til we die, pick a side
Feel it right, I been in my bag
We gon' ride 'til we die, pick a side
Feel it right, I been in my bag
We gon' ride 'til we die, pick a side
Feel it right, I been in my bag
We gon' ride 'til we die, pick a side
Feel it right, I been in my bag

Dyllie okay, I've been in my bag like
I got some groceries in here
Yeah, sleeping on me like
It's melatonin in here (Asleep)
Yeah, I'm in the lab and
Got the brodies in here (Brodies)
Yeah, rap is too easy
We makin' oldies in here
Like Shoo Doo, my demons usin' voodoo
I plead the blood like suu whoop
Your verses smell like doo doo
You tryna stream like Hulu
I'm tryna free the free world
I prolly got a loose screw
When Dyllie drop that new-new
There go your crew and you too
I look just like my Father's image
But honestly the mirror is my opposition
(Is my opposition) , yeah
Had a talk with Yahweh, now I got a mission
(Now I got a mission) , boy
Told me to take brothers out the competition
Yeah truth behind my bars
You gotta call 'em collect (Hello)
Indie tribe
I might just get the tat' on my neck
(Tat on my neck)
Monster at the least and I'm
A savage at best
Wait, Mogli, Manna, Holy, you can
Have all the rest, Hey

We gon' ride 'til we die, pick a side
Feel it right, I been in my bag
We gon' ride 'til we die, pick a side
Feel it right, I been in my bag
We gon' ride 'til we die, pick a side
Feel it right, I been in my bag
We gon' ride 'til we die, pick a side
Feel it right, I been in my bag
