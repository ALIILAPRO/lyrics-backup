		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Run-DMC
Live for you
(Fresh) fresh, yeah

For all you sucker MCs perpetratin' a fraud
Your rhymes are cold wack and keep the crowd cold bored
You're the kind of guy that girl ignored
I'm drivin' a Caddy, you fixin' a Ford
My name is Joseph Simmons, but my middle name's Ward
And when I'm rockin' on the mic, you should all applaud
Because we're wheelin', dealin', we got a funny feelin'
We rock from the floor up to the ceilin'
We groove it, you move it, it has been proven
We calm the savage beast because our music is soothin'
We create it, relate it, and often demonstrate it
We'll diss a sucker MC, make the other suckers hate it
We're risin', suprisin', and often hypnotizin'
We always tell the truth and then we never slip no lies in
No curls, no braids, peasy-head and still get paid
Jam Master cut the record up and down and crossfades, okay

Because the rhymes I say sharp as a nail
Witty as can be and not for sale
Always funky fresh, could never be stale
Took a test to become an MC and didn't fail
I couldn't wait to demonstrate
All the super def rhymes that I create
I'm a wizard of a word, that's what you heard
And anything else is quite absurd
I'm the master of a mic, that's what I say
And if I didn't say that, you'd say it anyway
Bust into the party, come in the place
See the first things come, the music in your face
Girls on the walls, some on the floor
With the DJ named Jay with the cuts galore
So listen to this because it can't be missed
And you can't leave 'til you're dismissed
You can do anything that you want to
But you can't leave until we're through
So relax your body and your mind
And listen to us say this rhyme, hey
You might think that you have waited
Long enough 'til the rhyme was stated
But if it were a test, it would be graded
With a grade that's not debated
Nothing too deep and nothing dense
And all our rhymes make a lot of sense
So move your butt to the cut
Run amok, you're not in a rut
Each and everybody out there, we got the notion
We want to see y'all all in motion
Just shake, wiggle, jump up and down
Move your body to the funky sound
Side to side, back and forth
We're the two MCs and we're gonna go off
Stand in place, walk or run
Tap your feet, you'll be on the one
Just snap your fingers and clap your hands
Our DJ's better than all these bands
Huh

We got all the lines and all the rhymes
We don't drop dimes and we don't do crimes
We bake a little cake with Duncan Hines
And never wear the pants they call the Calvin Kleins
'Cause Calvin Klein's no friend of mine
Don't want nobody's name on my behind
Lee on my legs, sneakers on my feet
D by my side and Jay with the beat (beat)

Jay, Jay, Jay, Jay, uh, uh
We don't stop
Don't, don't stop (Jay)
One, one, two, two, three, three
The, the Hollis, Hollis crew, crew
For, for, for, for, for the love now
Cool T now, ha, ha
My man, my man
My, my man Jam Master
In, in his place to be
Jay, Jay, Jay, Jay, Jay
The big beat blaster
Wailin', straight up rap
Countin' green
All the way live
Re-remember you don't stop
And, and, and, and you don't stop
Rock, rock the spot
Stick 'em and you don't stop, hah (stick 'em)
Run rocks it well, huh, well, well
With the clientele
Krush Groove (young ladies in the place)
We're-we're, we're-we're (bass)
We're-we're, we're-we're in the hottest place
Ha (Cold Crush), so Larry
Homeboys
Now we're talkin' autographs
Talkin' autographs and autographs
Fly girls in the place
Homeboys
Hollis Crew
