		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's Christmas time, my dear
And we said no gifts this year
I got one question if you'd let me
What did you get me?

Is it a tie? (No)
An ugly sweater? (Nuh-uh)
Matching pajamas? (No)
So something better? (Uh-huh)
Is it boujee like Gucci? (No)
Man, I thought I had it
No, baby, you're looking at it

Come on, wrap me up (wrap me up)
In your arms this Christmas
Wrap me up (wrap me up)
You don't need a wishlist
Wrap me up (wrap me up)
It's like Christmas magic
Wrap me up (wrap me up)
I'm the whole damn package

Come on, wrap me up (wrap me up)
I'll go get the ribbons
Wrap me up (wrap me up)
Honey, you don't get it
Wrap me up (wrap me up)
You already have it
Wrap me up (wrap me up, I see where you're going)
I'm the whole damn package

Come on and wrap me up
Wrap me up, baby (uh-huh)
Come on and wrap me up
Wrap me up, baby (uh-huh)
You made the nice list
And I know you've been waiting
Yeah, I'm a nice gift
And I know how to shake it

We deckin' halls, 'cause Santa's coming Christmas Eve
Big shiny balls, all up on that Christmas tree
Eggnog in my cup
Got them carols turning way up
And I don't need much, but what you'd get me? (Come on)

Is it a drone? (No)
A new razor? (Nuh-uh)
Is it a fancy manscaper with the laser? (Uh-uh)
A Maserati? Bugatti? (No)
Man, I thought I had it
Oh no, baby, youâ€™re looking at it (I'm getting close though)

Come on, wrap me up (wrap me up)
In your arms this Christmas
Wrap me up (wrap me up)
You don't need a wishlist
Wrap me up (wrap me up)
It's like Christmas magic
Wrap me up (wrap me up)
I'm the whole damn package

Come on, wrap me up (wrap me up, come on)
I'll go get the ribbons
Wrap me up (wrap me up)
Honey, you don't get it
Wrap me up (wrap me up)
You already have it
Wrap me up (wrap me up)
I'm the whole damn package

Come on and wrap me up
Wrap me up, baby (uh-huh)
Come on and wrap me up
Wrap me up, baby (uh-huh)
You made the nice list
And I know you've been waiting
Yeah, I'm a nice gift
And I know how to shake it

I wanna wrap you up (hey)
Wrap you up, baby
I wanna wrap you up (come on and wrap me up)
Wrap you up, baby
I make the nice list
And you know I've been waitin'
Yeah, you're a nice gift
And you know how to shake it
