		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mhm, mhm, mhm
Mhm, mhm

Blame it on the city how I'm ballin' (how I'm ballin')
Picking up the money, always callin' (always callin')
She gon' touch the ceiling for a sinner (for a sinner)
Dark chains and a blurry morning
Ready on that meet me in the lobby (in the lobby)
Yeah, from the bass, she goin' ride it like a trolley (like a trolly)
X Games when we skate off in the 'Rari (in the Rari')
Big tanks looking like transformers 

Lit night, come get right, on this side
Freak, freak, like my name, G, honest

You goin' know about it when we come through
Bad bitches comin' in twos
Ain't nobody tellin' what we gon' do
But when we run through, yeah, yeah
Diamonds on, it's poppin' out the sun roof
Red bottoms up on those shoes
Licking off shops like 
The way we run through, yeah, yeah

Big enough for me to call you papa (call you papa)
Poppin' like I'm over out in Baca (in Baca)
Need the head like medulla oblongata (oblongata)
Gucci like I'm made in Florence
More tequila, I'ma need a driver (need a driver)
Big tiger, gave me all his Prada (all his Prada)
Every diamond on me, yeah, I bought it (yeah, I bought it)
Mhm, say it twice so I know you want it

Lit night, come get right, on this side
Freak, freak, like my name, G, honest

You goin' know about it when we come through
Bad bitches comin' in twos
Ain't nobody tellin' what we gon' do
But when we run through, yeah, yeah
Diamonds on, it's poppin' out the sun roof
Red bottoms up on those shoes
Licking off shops like (do-do)
The way we run through, yeah, yeah

I'ma walk through, yeah
Crib with a house and a pool, yeah (pool, yeah)
Let her walk through
Bet it all, think that you'll lose (you'll lose)
I like how you move (like you to move)
She a ten and her skin so smooth (so smooth)
It's a two door Benz and it only fit two (fit two)
See it through the lens, everything brand new (brand new)

Oh, you goin' know about it when we come through (come through)
Bad bitches comin' in twos (in two)
Ain't nobody tellin' what we gon' do (yeah, yeah)
But when we run through, yeah, yeah
Diamonds on, it's poppin' out the sun roof (out the sun roof)
Red bottoms up on those shoes (up on those shoes)
Licking off shops like (do-do)
The way we run through, yeah, yeah

Blame it on the city how I'm ballin' (how I'm ballin')
Blame it on the city how I'm ballin' (how I'm ballin')
Blame it on the city how I'm Ballin' (how I'm ballin')
When we run through, yeah, yeah
Blame it on the city how I'm Ballin' (how I'm ballin')
Blame it on the city how I'm Ballin' (how I'm ballin')
Blame it on the city how I'm Ballin', yeah (how I'm ballin')
When we run through, yeah, yeah
