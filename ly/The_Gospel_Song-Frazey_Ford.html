		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why do we go when the blue sky turn to liquid
And the cold trees stark naked
Ohio upon the mountain we were growin' up

So strong

And I have found a flower that
Is growin in the forest
And we talked by the hour
Oh we were not lovers, but I loved you
Oh oh oh oh loved

And oooooh- beautiful clouds
I've been sailing through oh golden clouds
I've been sailing through you

Well my mother was a garden
Of all things unspoken
And my father came around me
Like a broken little soldier

And my sister
She is wonderin' what the hell
Is all around us
But there's beauty over us, but
There's beauty over us, ahhhh

What ya do is sacred and what
Ya say doesn't matter much
Your movin' your lips but your
Mind is on fire

And now the steam is risin' like I did all
Once a- a love came right through me
From above and I sang up to my God
And he saved me once again waaahaaa

And if you have a brother than
You can understand what it is
To love and grow up to
Love and things get shattered

And oooooh- beautiful clouds
I've been sailing though oh golden clouds
I go sailing through you
