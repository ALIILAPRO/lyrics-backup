		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been going through changes
And I feel so elated
To be here in your big blue world

I know I'm not your favorite
But I like when you say it
I don't need you to be my girl

Oh, well, I went to the store
And saw you there
And then you looked right back
And caught my stare
You said I'm free right now
If you're not scared
I said I know I'm not the one

But I'll be your boy toy
You don't need to tell me twice
I'll be your boy toy
You don't need to be so nice
I'll be your boy toy
(You can wear me out)

I'm no fun
But at least I'm not as sad as I used to be
You are the sun to my jet black moon

And then you took me home
I felt so scared
I had to switch my shirt
And fix my hair
You told me I don't care
If you don't care
I said I know I'm not the one

But I'll be your boy toy
You don't need to tell me twice
I'll be your boy toy
You don't need to be so nice
I'll be your boy toy if you like
And by the way you look at me I think you might
(I think you might)
I'll be your boy toy

Just how you like
Pretty little boy toy
I'll be your boy toy
Just how you like
I'll be your boy toy
Just how you like
Pretty little boy toy
Just for tonight
