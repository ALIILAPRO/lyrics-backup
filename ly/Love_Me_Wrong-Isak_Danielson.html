		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You make me want to make mistakes
You turn temptation into my best friend
You make me just give up and cave
Will I ever fall in love like this again?

I'm in Hell
You taste your smell
I know you far too well
It's a spell
That took me from a dream to this motel
I ring the bell 'cause honestly, I'd rather be with you than by myself

So love me wrong if you can't love me right
All I want is to be in your vibes
You're the one who builds my paradise
Love me, love me wrong
Love me, love me wrong
If you can't love me right

You make me take what I can get
Your love is poison that won't let me live
You make me drunk and desperate
'Cause it helps me to forget what you don't give

I'm in Hell
You taste your smell
I know you far too well
It's a spell
That took me from a dream to this motel
I ring the bell 'cause honestly, I'd rather be with you than by myself

So love me wrong if you can't love me right
All I want is to be in your vibes
You're the one who builds my paradise
Love me, love me wrong
Love me, love me wrong
If you can't love me right

(Love me wrong)

I'm in Hell
You taste your smell
I know you far too well
It's a spell
That took me from a dream to this motel
I ring the bell 'cause honestly, I'd rather be with you than by myself

So love me wrong if you can't love me right
All I want is to be in your vibes
You're the one who builds my paradise
Love me, love me wrong
Love me, love me wrong

Can you just love me wrong
If you can't love me right
All I want is to be in your vibes
You're the one who builds my paradise
Love me, love me wrong
Love me, love me wrong
If you can't love me right
