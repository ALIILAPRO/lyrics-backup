		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, how come you say you will when you won't?
Say you do, baby, when you don't
Let me know, honey, how you feel
Tell the truth now, is love real?
So, ah, ah

Well, honey don't
Well, honey don't
Honey don't
Honey don't
Honey don't
I say you will when you won't
Ah, ah, honey don't

Well, I love you, baby, and you oughtta know
I like the way that you wear your clothes
Everything about you is so doggone sweet
You got that sand all over your feet
Well, ah, ah

Well, honey don't
Honey don't
Honey don't
Honey don't
Honey don't
I say you will when you won't
Ah, ah, honey don't

Ah, rock on, George, one time for me
I feel fine
I said

Well, sometimes I love you on a Saturday night
Sunday morning you don't look right
You been out painting the town
Uh huh, baby been steppin' around
Well, ah, ah

Well, honey don't
I said, honey don't
Honey don't
Honey don't
Honey don't
I say you will when you won't
Ah, ah, honey don't

Ah, rock on, George, for Ringo one time

Well, honey don't
Well, honey don't
A little, little, honey don't
I say, you will when you won't
Ah, ah, honey don't
