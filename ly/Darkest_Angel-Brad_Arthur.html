		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been waiting a long time
Can't hide so I let it in
Each step through dark I
Feel it all
Feel it all

Break off from the shoreline
Choose all that I've never been
Her voice is the north star
Through it all
Through it all

It calling me
Calling me
Never look back
Through the deepest red
Straight falling in
Falling in
Burning blue fire going up in my head
Yeah

Darkest Angel
Show me the way
Darkness will fall I
Break through the wall
I let go and feel the rain
Fighting pure hell
Heaven can wait
Coz I give it all as I hear you call
The monster inside of me

One way through the dark side
Oh lord never make it easy
I pray for the strength to
Live it all
Live it all

It calling me
Calling me
Never look back
Through the deepest red
Straight falling in
Falling in
Burning blue fire going up in my head
Yeah

Darkest Angel
Show me the way
Darkness will fall I
Break through the wall
I let go and feel the rain
Fighting pure hell
Heaven can wait
Coz I give it all as I hear you call
The monster inside of me

And I give it all
Till I don't have anything left
Fly down and down till the end
Yeah
Follow her call
In her aura know that I can
Rewriting all I am

The darkest of angels
Will sing you sweetest lullaby

Darkest Angel
Show me the way
Darkness will fall I
Break through the wall
I let go and feel the rain
Fighting pure hell
Heaven can wait
Coz I give it all as I hear you call
The monster inside of me
