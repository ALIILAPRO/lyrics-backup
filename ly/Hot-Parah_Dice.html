		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You think you're hot hot hot
But,  you're acting kinda crazy
Please  just stop! You're not
A dirty dancing Patrick Swayze

You're not hot hot hot
But‚  you're acting kinda crazy
Please  just stop! You're not
A dirty dancing Patrick Swayze
You  think you're hot hot hot hot

You think you're hot
(A dirty dancing Patrick Swayze)

It's just the way you move
Tryna  keep it cool
I'm not your
I'm not your kinda girl

You think you got the good
That I'm just another the fool
I'm not your‚ ah ah

You think you're hot hot hot
But‚ you're acting kinda crazy
Please just stop! You're not
A dirty dancing Patrick Swayze
You're not hot hot hot
But, you're acting kinda crazy
Please just stop! You're not
A dirty dancing Patrick Swayze
You think you're hot hot hot hot

You think you're hot
(A dirty dancing Patrick Swayze)

You think you're hot

(You think you're hot hot hot)
(You think you're hot hot hot)

You think you're hot hot hot
But, you're acting kinda crazy
Please just stop! You're not
A dirty dancing Patrick Swayze

You're not hot hot hot
But‚ you're acting kinda crazy
Please just stop! You're not
A dirty dancing Patrick Swayze
I'm not your... ah ah

You think you're hot hot hot
But, you're acting kinda crazy
Please just stop! You're not
A dirty dancing Patrick Swayze

You're not hot hot hot
But, you're acting kinda crazy
Please just stop! You're not
A dirty dancing Patrick Swayze
You think you're hot
