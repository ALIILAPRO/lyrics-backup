		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The moon floats across the black skies
No stars to be seen out tonight
New life, what it feels like
Snow falls, frozen tears hit the ground

Winds whispering their secrets
Wandering in the night, I keep them
For you, I rid myself of evil

Pale light gleams on my sword
I cut the night as I'm going forward
New life is what I long for
Since I can't bear my world anymore

Sorrow is my only feeling
Through this everlasting season
I'm going without any reason

Winds whispering their secrets
Wandering in the night, I keep them
For you, I rid myself of evil

Gathering the stars for you
I rid myself of evil
