		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whenever I’m
Alone at night
And it doesn’t happen often cause I socialize.
I think about it
And way too much

Oh I feel loved, I feel like
I got so lucky in life
with all my family and friends who care, a job that I like
I travel so much more
I live my dream I’m on

Still I feel so alone now
Staring in the nowhere
Chasing all my dreams
I don’t wanna change
Don’t wanna change
I feel so alone now
I feel so alone
So alone, so alone, so alone

I think I’m not
The only one,
Everybody in a while is feeling lonely and
It’s good to realize what you feel inside, yeah, hmmm
Oh I feel loved, I feel like,
I got so lucky in live
Once in a while I feel the lonelyness and empty at night
Sometimes i let it go, but
Sometimes i don’t, I don't

Still I feel so alone now
staring in the nowhere
chasing all my dreams
I don’t wanna change
don’t wanna change
I feel so alone now
I feel so alone
So alone, so alone, so alone
