		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I must have sneezed
On knees I freeze
I mean I just choked up
Somehow I slept
I dream, I mean
I dreamt of nothing
Able to breathe a sweet relief
Now that you're here for me
A northern degree
Dove into me
Now I'm recovering

[Chorus]
I only want you to see
My favorite part of me,
And not my ugly side...
Not my ugly side.

Hook up a C.B. Wave a way
For conversation flow.
I'm shoved in your cage, to wage this rage,
Don't let me go.
A kick and a scream is all that seems
to mean a log thus far.
I won't let you on my stage, my page,
You can't know, yet you have to know.

[Chorus]

So calm, and now it's dark.
I look for you to light my heart.
I'm in between the moon and where you are.
I know, I can't be far
