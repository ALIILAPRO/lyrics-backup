		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're from a long line of people running from themselves
Let's look alive, the sun is blocked out from sight, all days turn to night
I'm done running from myself, I speak for no-one else, no
Everyday in succession, until we come undone, nah

This is me, This is you
Yeah, we're coming unglued
Like a page pulled from the bind

I can't stop screaming these words over again
Until breath escapes and my chest caves in
It doesn't matter where I've been, can't give in, and shut down
Just breathe in and breathe out and begin
I shook the hand of doubt so I could sever the lines that he spits from his mouth
And now it's time to pull through, something I must do with or without you

What you see is what they want you to see
You've got to learn that for yourself and not from me
Lessons learned in a lifetime, sleep with an open eye, what's yours ain't mine
No matter what, we're gonna pull through
Just like we always do, yeah, ain't that the truth

This is me, this is you
Riding on a fault line
Yeah, as we divide

I can't stop screaming these words over again
Until breath escapes and my chest caves in
It doesn't matter where I've been, can't give in, and shut down
Just breathe in and breathe out and begin
I shook the hand of doubt so I could sever the lines that he spits from his mouth
And now it's time to pull through, something I must do with or without you

Once more into the fray
Once more doing what's expected of me until it ends
It ends as it begun, then our work is done
