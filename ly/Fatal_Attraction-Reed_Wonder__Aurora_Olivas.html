		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A flame too hot
Might be too intense to ignore
I'm drawn to your fire
Even though i'm feeling unsure
Your danger
Your allure
Oh you know I like the games you play
You want me then you don't
What do you call a love that's so bittersweet?
Fill my desire
Then give me pain
Seduced by your passion
I know that it's not safe
A love so dark it's a sin
Fatal attraction
Fatal attraction is pulling me in
Fatal traction
A love so dark it's a sin
I feel so high
When you give me less I want more
I come to life
When you play me like a chord
I want you to myself
But you know I like the games you play
You want me then you don't
What do you call a love that's so bittersweet?
Fill my desire
Then give me pain
Seduced by your passion
I know that it's not safe
A love so dark it's a sin
Fatal attraction
Fatal attraction is pulling me in
Fatal attraction
A love so dark it's a sin
You're like a drug to me
Caught in your ecstasy
I know that this is wrong
But I'm falling in way too deep
Temptations killing me
Slowly over time
Fatal attraction
Fatal attraction is pulling me in
It's pulling me in
Fatal attraction
You can take all my love
A love so dark it's a sin
