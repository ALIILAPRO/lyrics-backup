		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was the summer
And if felt like the end
But I didn't wanna be just another ex-girlfriend
Thought, "Hey, maybe I can play too
Maybe one day I'll be just as good as you", uh
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Saved up and bought myself a bass
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Dreaming of a way to get outta this place

Where my girls at?
Where my girls at?
Gonna start me a rock n' roll band, yeah
Where my girls at?
Where my girls at?
Gonna start me a rock and roll band, yeah

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Gonna start me a rock and roll band, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Gonna start me a rock and roll band, yeah

I bought a van, then we got on the road
Le Rockette, Le Bistro, Barfly, then home
Selling T-shifts in a garbage bag
Twenty bucks more for the one that's on my back, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Even if there's nobody at the show
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We gotta keep on singing, "Hey, let's go NOBRO"

Where my girls at?
Where my girls at?
Gonna start me a rock n' roll band, yeah
Where my girls at?
Where my girls at?
Gonna start me a rock and roll band, yeah

Where my girls at?
Where my girls at?
Gonna start me a rock n' roll band, yeah
Where my girls at?
Where my girls at?
Gonna start me a rock and roll band, yeah

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Where my girls at, where my girls at?
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Where my girls at, where my girls at?
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Gonna start me a rock and roll band, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Dreamin' of a way to get out of this place, yeah
