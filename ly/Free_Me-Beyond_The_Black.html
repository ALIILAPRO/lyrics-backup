		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You have held my hand in shiver
You have felt my tainted heart
You have witnessed how I wither
Fading slowly into dark

And you've walked into the silence
Where my hope has lost it's voice
I have one thing left to ask for
Grant me this, my final choice

Free me, free me
My love, I want you
To free me, free me
My love, I want you
To free me

Just as much as I adore you
I have fought with all my heart
Now the last time I implore you
Means to lay down all your arms

Will you find this strength within you
Will you help me, I must know
We have dreamt a dream together
Hold me close and let me go

Free me, free me
My love, I want you
To free me, free me
My love, I want you

To save me from drowning (now)
I'm losing my mind here (now)
The shadows upon me still (grow)
The fighting is over (now)
Release me from evil (now)
Come hold me at last and let go

You have walked into the silence
Where my heartbeat used to be
May the love your eyes still show me
Be the last thing that I see
That I see
So

Free me, free me
My love, I want you
To free me, free me
My love, I want you
Free me, free me
Free me, free me
My love, I want you
To free me
