		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pussy like a bulldozer
Pussy like a bulldozer, drooling and grinding
Pussy like a bulldozer
Pussy like a blown out speaker
Pussy like a bulldozer
My pussy like a bulldozer
Drooling and grinding
My pussy like a bulldozer
My pussy like a blown out speaker
My pussy like nothing at all
So it doesn't matter

I could fall apart right now if I wanted to
Give it to you raw like this, no autotune
But I could still feel it
But you could still hear it
No one wants to say what

Kinda skittish like a cheating love
Change your life like a free hug
Changing tactics like I give a fuck
Kinda fucked up

Fucked up

Pussy like a pussy like a
Pussy like a- uh- my pussy like a

I thought therе was a mistake but I was wrong
Thought there was somеthing I was missing
I was different but I was-
I wanted to be like the other girls
Now I'm just like the other girls
I wanted to be like the other girls
Now I'm just like the other girls
I wanted to be like the other girls
Now I'm just like the other girls

Pussy like a pussy like a
Pussy like a pussy like a
My pussy like a blown out speaker uhuh
