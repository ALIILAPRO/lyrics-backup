		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't come 'round tonight
Don't want you to see me cry
'Cause my face is red and ugly
I'm afraid that you won't love me

He comes 'round anyway
Holds my face, says, "It's okay
I brought movies and a disc drive
I'll hold your hand at midnight"

Flicker on the screen
You sit close to me
I can finally breathe
And you rest your hand
On my pyjama pants
Feel my heart beat fast

Can we call today?
I just need to see your face
'Cause it melts me to a puddle
Trip on air and sprain my ankle

He's a lavender bouquet
Spray it on my pillowcase
Make me warmer in the summer
Like the pigment in your fingers

Let's go brush our teeth
Stand here next to me
Get 'em squeaky clean
And you rest your head
On my upper chest
Hear my heart beat fast

Wanna make you feel
Gentler than silk
Stronger than steel
Show him how to be calm
Wrap him 'round my arm
Remind each other what's a lie
And what is real

What if we held hands
In our pyjama pants
While our hearts beat calmly at last?
