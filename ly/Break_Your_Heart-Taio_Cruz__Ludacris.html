		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Luda (whoa-oh)
Now I may not be the worst or the best 
But you gotta respect my honesty (whoa-oh)
And I may break your heart 
But I don't really think there's anybody as bomb as me (whoa-oh)
So you can take this chance in the end
Everybody's gonna be wondering how you deal (whoa-oh)
You might say this is Ludacris 
But Taio Cruz, tell her how you feel

Now listen to me, baby (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Before I love and leave you (oh, oh, oh, oh)
They call me heartbreaker (oh, oh, oh, oh)
I don't wanna deceive you (oh, oh, oh, oh)

If you fall for me
I'm not easy to please
I might tear you apart
Told you from the start, baby, from the start

I'm only gonna break-break your, break-break your heart
I'm only gonna break-break your, break-break your heart
I'm only gonna break-break your, break-break your heart
I'm only gonna break-break your, break-break your heart

Whoa-oh, whoa
Whoa-oh, whoa

There's not point trying to hide it (oh, oh, oh, oh)
No point trying to evade it (oh, oh, oh, oh)
I know I got a problem (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Problem with misbehaving (oh, oh, oh, oh)

If you fall for me
I'm not easy to please
I might tear you apart
Told you from the start, baby, from the start

I'm only gonna break-break your, break-break your heart
I'm only gonna break-break your, break-break your heart
I'm only gonna break-break your, break-break your heart
I'm only gonna break-break your 
Break-break ya heart (that's all I'm gonna do, woman)

Listen (whoa-oh)
Now I'm only gonna break your heart
And shatter and splatter it all into little bitty pieces (whoa-oh)
Whether or not you get it all together 
Then it's finders keepers and losers weepers (whoa-oh)
See, I'm not tryin' to lead you on
No, I'm only tryin' to keep it real (whoa-oh)
You might say this is Ludacris
But Taio Cruz, tell her how you feel

Hey and I know karma's gonna get me back for bein' so cold
Hey, like a big bad wolf, I'm born to be bad and bad to the bone
Hey, if you fall for me, I'm only gonna tear you apart
Hey, told ya from the start, hey

I'm only gonna break-break your, break-break your heart
I'm only gonna break-break your, break-break your heart
I'm only gonna break-break your, break-break your heart
I'm only gonna break-break your, break-break your heart

Whoa-oh, whoa
Whoa-oh, whoa
Whoa-oh, whoa
Whoa-oh, whoa
