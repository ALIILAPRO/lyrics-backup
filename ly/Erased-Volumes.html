		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been erased from the old me
Can you tell me again, can you hold me
If I won't lay till the morning sun?
It pulls you out and takes you under

I thought you'd hate me, but I needed you
I thought you'd hate me
But you needed truth
I thought you'd hate me, hate me, hate me
For losing you i thought you knew

That we're cut out of the same cloth
Feel like the pages of a
Story that we can't stop
And, now I can't replace
You with another thread
Take one more step, I'll jump with you
I thought you'd hate me, but I needed you
I thought you'd hate me
But you needed truth
I thought you'd hate me, hate me, hate me
Hate me for losing you i thought you knew

Looking back at your building
You came crashing down
You'll think I'll forget that
Never gonna take it back
(You know where I lie)
Looking back at your bullshit
I came crashing down
You'll think I'll forget that
Never gonna take you back
(You know where I am) i thought you knew

It's hard enough you standing next to me
Your scent reviving memories spent with you
I need to know that you believe in this
Or just erase them into déjà vu

I, I never wanted you to understand
(understand) why!?
I want to make you believe in me
Believe in me

I thought you'd hate me, but I needed you
I thought you'd hate me
But you needed truth
I thought you'd hate me, hate me, hate me
For losing you
I thought you'd hate me, but I needed you
I thought you'd hate me
But you needed truth
I thought you'd hate me, hate me, hate me
For losing you i thought you knew
