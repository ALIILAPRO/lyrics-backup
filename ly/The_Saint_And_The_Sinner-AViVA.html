		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're a saint
And I'm a sinner
You're a saint
And I'm a sinner

So you've seen those lies and heard my pain
I've been a demon, but you think I'm still a saint
Tired of chasing freedom, some things feel so strange
Stop looking at me like I'm gonna lead the way

Searching for the light
Everything that I thought I knew
Torn into pieces by the truth
There's no wrong or right
Everything that they said about me
Guess you'll see

You're a saint
And I'm a sinner
But I'm desperate for the light
Been in pain
But not a quitter
In this everlasting fight

You're a saint
And I'm a sinner

Picking up the pieces, still can't explain
Why there's only silence after flooding rains
You want my reasons, why I walked away
But I'm still over here, wondering if I'm insane

Searching for the light
Everything that I thought I knew
Torn into pieces by the truth
There's no wrong or right
Everything that they said about me
Guess you'll see

You're a saint
And I'm a sinner
But I'm desperate for the light
Been in pain
But not a quitter
In this everlasting fight

You're a saint
And I'm a sinner

Can you hear it?
Can you hear my heartbeat?

You're a saint (you're a saint)
And I'm a sinner
But I'm desperate for the light
Been in pain
But not a quitter
In this everlasting fight

You're a saint (you're a saint)
And I'm a sinner
You're a saint
And I'm a sinner
