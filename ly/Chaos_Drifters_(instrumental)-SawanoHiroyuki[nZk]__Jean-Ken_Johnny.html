		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wanna know what's out there 錆びた声軋ませ
Am I meant for something? 歯車が意味を欲しがる
幾たびも見た夢は等しく醒めて
救われぬお祈りを捧げる

So my friend, light the fire here
Light the fire here to find your answer
Light the fire here, yes, light your fire here for me
And give it away

欠けているこの世界で
ありもしない理想追いかけて
Pull the trigger, you chaos drifters
抗うように願い込めて

What do I want and what will I see?
Keep on point the gun in my head
What do I want and what will I seek?
Ain't nobody spoil it to me
What did I want and what did I see?
Keep on point the gun in my head
What do I want and what will I seek?
Burn that riddle till the last scene

Do we have a shelter? 選ばれなかった僕らでも
We believe in something 朧な光に焦がれる
白と黒混ぜすぎの灰色の世界
少しでも真っさらな瞬間を

So my friend, light the fire here
Just light the fire here to find your answer
Light the fire here, yes, light your fire here for thee
To give it away

As I swallow the lies in vanity
吐き出して浄化するように
Pull the trigger, you chaos drifters
心のまま撃ちつくして

What do I want and what will I see?
Keep on point the gun in my head
What do I want and what will I seek?
Ain't nobody spoil it to me
What did I want and what did I see?
Keep on point the gun in my head
What do I want and what will I seek?
Burn that riddle till the last scene

Just give it away

欠けているこの世界で
ありもしない理想追いかけて
Pull the trigger, you chaos drifters
抗うように意志を込めて

What do I want and what will I see?
Keep on point the gun in my head
What do I want and what will I seek?
Ain't nobody spoil it to me
What did I want and what did I see?
Keep on point the gun in my head
What do I want and what will I seek?
Burn that riddle till the last scene

What do I want and what will I see?
Keep on point the gun in my head
What do I want and what will I seek?
Count my steps till the 13th
What did I want and what did I see?
Keep on point the gun in my head
What do I want and what will I seek?
Burn that riddle till the last scene
