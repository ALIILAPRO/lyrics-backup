		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Persian Rugs
But she's from Nicaragua
If I choose Persian love
Are we turning up
Or are we wasting time?
Girl, don't waste my time
You know I'm Party
I don't just wanna chill with you
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, no

I wanna turn up on
I wanna turn you on
I wanna lay with you
That's the least I'ma do 
Ooh (ooh), fuck I look like?
I don't wanna chill (chill)
I'm kissing ya, I want you to feel
Can you feel it, babe?
Can you feel me, baby?
Can you feel it, babe?
Can you feel me, babe?

Kissing you there
And fucking you right
Loving you there
Loving you right
Fuck with a pro
Come baby, fuck with a pro
When you gon' let me know?
I been kissing you slow
Tongue down, down, down, down
I'll be down, down, down, down, down
But you're mine, and I make you feel right
The way I'm talking, girl, I can focus all night
Ooh, no, no, no
I would love too, yeah
I wouldn't mind, do you?
