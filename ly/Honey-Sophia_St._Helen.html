		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll always remember the smell of the first rainfall
And the feeling of being so small
Like a mouse in a concert hall
And the way the grey clouds made a glare in the street
That glistened bright and hurt my eyes
While the puddles wet my feet
I felt like a frog

And when I came to your doorstep wet as a lake
And rang your bell hoping you were awake
You greeted me like a dog
"You thirsty?" you asked me
Sleep still in your eyes
"Coffee's good," I said
But we skipped a few steps and headed straight to bed

And there was a way you kissed me that day
Felt like I was yours to stay
And I felt like a gardener watching the first seed sprout after a drought
I came for a visit but I never left
The days rolled by
We held another and danced and laughed 
Becoming more than just lovers

You understood my flaws
Loved me anyway
Took them in your arms with me
Embracing the honey and the sting of the bee
'Cause the honey tastes so good
And the honey tastes so sweet
And the honey will stick to you like morning dew
And honey
You warm my heart like a belly warms from Irish stew

I used to feel small
Like a mouse in a concert hall
Till I met you
Honey
