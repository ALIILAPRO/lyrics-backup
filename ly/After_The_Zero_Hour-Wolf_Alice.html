		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Suddenly she lost control of the world
A fire burnt and the chaos unfurled
A transcendent sudden invitation to the zero hour
She gave in to the temptation 
High on curiosity, high on power

But this girl refused to die
So she drank the milk of life
Was it the moon and the changing tide?

Yeah, this girl refused to die
So she drank the milk of life
Felt like the start of the ninth life

To you feel pleasure again
To you feel love
Adventurous and sensuous
As high as the planes above

Don't wait with bated breath
For this to all turn sour
She's learnt how to say yes
High on curiosity, high on power

So this girl refused to cry
But embraced her lust for light
Was it the moon and the changing tide?

Yeah this girl refused to cry
But embrace her lust for life
Eyes straight ahead and open wide
