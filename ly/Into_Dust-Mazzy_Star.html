		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Still falling
Breathless and on again
Inside today
Beside me today
Around broken in two
'Till you eyes shed 
Into dust
Like two strangers
Turning into dust
'Till my hand shook with the way I fear

I could possibly be fading
Or have something more to gain
I could feel myself growing older
I could feel myself under your fate
Under your fate

It was you breathless and tall
I could feel my eyes turning into dust
And two strangers turning into dust
Turning into dust
