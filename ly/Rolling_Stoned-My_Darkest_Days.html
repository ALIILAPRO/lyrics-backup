		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here’s an invitation to come with me
The destination’s gonna set us free
Find the place where we both belong
When the world awakes we’ll be as good as gone

Don’t need a pill I can swallow
Don’t need a road map to follow
When you’re rolling stoned
Burning up the open road
Nothing every night we go
One step over the edge
One step over the edge

In our own oasis in the desert sand
We’ll celebrate a beautiful romance
When we’re together nothing good goes wrong
We can stay forever
We can just move on

Don’t need a pill I can swallow
Don’t need a road map to follow
When you’re rolling stoned
Burning up the open road
Nothing every night we go
One step over the edge
One step over the edge

Rolling in town
Four wheel barrow
Riding all night
Rolling stoned
A little too high
But never too low
Riding all night
Rolling stoned

The world will never find us
'Cause we’ll cover our tracks
We’ll just keep on driving
And we’ll never look back

When you’re rolling stoned
Burning up the open road
Nothing every night we go
One step over the edge
One step over the edge

Rolling in town
Four wheel barrow
Riding all night
Rolling stoned
A little too high
But never too low
Riding all night
Rolling stoned
