		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will tell you the story about the little boy I found in the grass
Tired soul as he told me he could hear the children wanting to pass
Sounds of laughter in the air
Still today we hear them

Finally we are over it all
Finally we are over, over it all

(Let them run) 

Let them run from the violence
The world is way too cold and bright for their eyes
Little boy runs beside them
As they take his hand and jump to the sky
Still today you hear him

Finally I am over
Over it all
Finally I am over
Over it all

When will my healing come?
When will my healing come along?
Sinking like a stone
When will my healing come along?

Finally I am over it all
Finally I am over it all

Finally I am
