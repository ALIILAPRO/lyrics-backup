		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girls, I got girls
Only girls going wild in my mind
In my mind

Midnight when I saw ya, I was about to leave
You were in the corner hanging, like a masterpiece
You're dancing with all your best friends
Or maybe you could spend a song with me
In a tight t-shirt, I could see what's underneath
Talking over speakers, you're leaning close to me
You tucked my hair behind my ear
I put my finger through the loop of your jeans

I knew right then, right there
It was so cinematic
Because it started to rain
And I said, oh my god
Your body's speaking my language
I told my mom it's not a phase 'cause

I kissed a girl and I liked it
Sipped her like an Old Fashioned
I kissed a girl and she liked it
It's better than I imagined
Oh, she took my heart and my number
Don't think I'll recover
'Til she's in my covers coming over tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
Yeah, I really, really liked it

Girls, I got girls
Only girls going wild in my mind
In my mind

Want to hold this moment the way you're holding me
Swimming in your ocean, you move like poetry
She struck me hard like lightning
And I don't think I'll ever come back 
(I don't think I'll ever come back)

I knew right then, right there
It was super dramatic
Because it started to rain
And she said, oh my god
Your body's speaking my language
Go tell your mom, it's not a phase 'cause

I kissed a girl and I liked it
Sipped her like an Old Fashioned
I kissed a girl and she liked it
It's better than I imagined
Oh she took my heart and my number
Don't think I'll recover
'Til she's in my covers coming over tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
Yeah, I really, really liked it

Girls, I got girls
Only girls going wild in my mind (in my mind)
In my mind (in my mind)
Girls, I got girls
Only girls going wild in my mind (in my mind)
In my mind (in my mind)

I kissed a girl, no surprises
I really, really liked it (haha)
