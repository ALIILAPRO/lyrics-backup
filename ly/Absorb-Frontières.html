		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When will you listen?
Step back and see it with your own eyes
When will you absorb
Closing in on me

Rolling on a yes I am my own God
Stopping my heart from feeling - pain - pain - pain
But I won't say their name
So what's left for someone stuck in the middle of this mire?
We're all just pieces to be played on both sides of

How do we make this a certainty?
Step back and see with your own eyes
You tell me it might not be safe
How do we make this a certainty?
Step back and see with your own eyes
You tell me it might not be safe

Our world is spinning faster
I ain't got time to think
What I wanna say, what I wanna be
I'm running out of words
Can you carry me? Can you carry me away?
Just close your eyes and see
what's right in front of you

You think you're going to take everything away
But I've seen this before
I'm no longer afraid
I'm no longer afraid
I'm no longer afraid

How do we make this a certainty?
Step back and see with your own eyes
You tell me it might not be safe
not be safe
How do we make this a certainty?
Step back and see with your own eyes
You tell me
You tell me
You tell me it might no be safe

Don't let these walls
Close in on you
Let them dissolve into the sky
Follow your heart, your eyes on the prize
Move forth alone
