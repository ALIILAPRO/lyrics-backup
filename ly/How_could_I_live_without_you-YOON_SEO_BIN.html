		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Kissed your eyes inside my dream
We both stood inside the rain
Raindrops falling on my heart  
Im still here with you
All I think about is you 
Every morning, every night filled with you
Youre just like a star, so beautiful
Here I am
Every time you fall down 
Dont you worry, youre not alone
Oh here I am
You are the only one 
That I will ever love 
How could I survive without you
Forever is not enough to make all of our memories
How
I, Ill never let you go
Not letting you be lonely
No
I left flowers by your side
Hoping this will make you smile
Even if Im not with you
I feel you all the time 
Dont want you to be afraid
Cause Im always next to you yeah 
Love is just so beautiful to me
Oh here I am 
So every time youre down, down
Dont you fear youre not alone 
How could I survive without you
Forever is not enough to make all of our memories
How
I, Ill never let you go
Not letting you be lonely
I wont
I need you in my arms, 
My world, you are my soul
Im always on your side
Youre my life, you are my heart
Nothings gonna change my love for you 
Woo Woo
Never leaving your sight
Love will never fade
How could I ever forget you 
All I need is your love
Just making our story
Um
