		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Would you love me less?
If you knew the places that I've been?
If you knew the damage that I did?
Would you love me less? 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

I got too much dirt to come clean
Closets full of skeletons that you don't wanna see
Will you judge me? All my ugly?
I won't blame you if you do
No lies, don't wanna keep no secrets
Even if what I'ma say will you leave speechless
No secrets
If I introduce you to my demons, tell me

Baby, would you love me less
If you knew the places that I've been?
If you knew the damage that I did?
Oh, would you love me less? 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Would you love me less
If I had a dollar for my sins?
If you knew the beds that I've been in?
Oh, would you love me less?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Would you love me less (less) 
If I spent your cash (cash)
On designer bags? (Bags) 
On a trip to france? (Oui)
150 thousand, and it's just the weekend
Would you love me more or love me less?
If I crash the car on Sunday (sorry)
Would you love me less on Monday? Yeah
You know I always make it up to you, baby
Would you love me more?

Baby, would you love me less
If you knew the places that I've been?
If you knew the damage that I did?
Oh, would you love me less? 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Would you love me less
If I had a dollar for my sins?
If you knew the beds that I've been in?
Oh, would you love me less? 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Or would you love me more?
Or would you love me more?
(Would you love me more?)
If you knew the person that I was, yeah yeah (woo-ah)
If you knew the power of your love to change me
And if I introduce you to my demons, tell me

Baby, you won't love me less
If you knew the places that I've been (if you knew the places)
If you knew the damage that I did? (The trouble that I'm in)
Oh, would you love me less? 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Would you love me less
If I had a dollar for my sins? (A dollar for my sins, now)
If you knew the beds that I've been in? (Oh whoa)
Oh, would you love me less? 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
