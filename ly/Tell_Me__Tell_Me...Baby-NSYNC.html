		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh
Hold on, uh
You know what? 
Can we back it up
Just a little bit? 

Said I
Said I

Why

Tell me oh

We're born the same day
We even think the same way
I couldn't be more right
We are what they call
A perfect match
Something that you can't touch
Down to the last bone
You're my baby

But to be honest
There's just one thing
A part that is missing
You don't seem to care at all

Tell me, tell me baby
How come you
Don't want to love me? 
Don't you know
That I can't breathe without you? 
Tell me, tell me just how
What am I supposed to do
Right now? 
Why can't you love me? 
Why? 
Tell me, my baby

Now from the moment we met
I thought that I was all set
How could I be so wrong? 
Now I'm hearing that
You're seeing someone new
And I wanna know who
Does he love you like I do? 
My baby

Can I promise you this one thing
Whatever is missing
I will make it up to you

Tell me, tell me baby
How come you
Don't want to love me? 
Don't you know
That I can't breathe without you? 
Tell me, tell me just how
What am I supposed to do
Right now? 
Why can't you love me? 
Why? 
Tell me, my baby

Getting under my skin
Messing up my mind
Never let me
Into your life and
Tell me baby
How come you
Don't wanna love me
And how
I'm supposed to live without
If there is no way
To make you
Feel the same way too? 

Ooh

Tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me

We're born the same day
We even think the same way
Tell me baby

Tell me, tell me baby
How come you
Don't want to love me? 
Don't you know
That I can't breathe without you? 
Tell me, tell me just how
What am I supposed to do
Right now? 
Why can't you love me? 
Why? 
Tell me, my baby

Tell me, tell me baby
How come you
Don't want to love me? 
Don't you know
That I can't breathe without you? 
Tell me, tell me just how
What am I supposed to do
Right now? 
Why can't you love me? 
Why? 
Tell me, my baby

Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Say tell me baby

Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me,
Yeah
