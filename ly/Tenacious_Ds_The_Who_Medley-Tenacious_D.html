		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ever since I was a young boy
I've played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played 'em all
But I ain't seen nothing like him
In any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean motherfuckin’ pinball
Even on my favorite table
He can beat my best
His disciples lead him in
And he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers
Never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean motherfuckin’ pinball
I thought I was
The Bally table king
But I just handed
My pinball crown to him
There’s a man I’ve found who can bring us all joy
A doctor I’ve found can cure the boy
A doctor I’ve found can cure the boy
Man I’ve found can remove his sorrow
He lives in this town let’s see him tomorrow
Let’s see him tomorrow
I often wonder what he is thinking
Has he ever heard a word I’ve said
Look at him in the mirror dreaming
What is happening in his head
Listening to you, I get the music gazing at you
I get the heat, following you
I climb the mountain, I get excitement
Right behind you, I see the millions
On you, I see the glory
From you, I get opinion
From you, I get the story
Alright now go
What is happening in his head
I wish I knew, I wish I knew
