		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh

I don't know how
I don't know why
But girl it seems
You've touched my life
Your in my dreams
Your in my heart
I call myself
A miracle
Something strange has come over me
A raging wind
Across my seas
And girl you know that your eyes are to blame
What am I supposed to do
If I can't get over you
I come to find that you don't feel the same

Cause I'm falling, falling
Girl I'm falling for you
And I pray your falling too
I've been falling, falling
Every since the moment
I laid eyes on you

I lose my step
I lose my ground
I lose myself
When you're around
I'm holding on
For my life
To keep from drowning in your eyes
Girl what have you done to me
To make me fall so desperately
To think that I don't even know your name
How am I supposed to live
If I can't get over this
And you decide that you don't feel the same

Cause I'm falling, falling
Girl I'm falling for you
And I pray your falling too
I've been falling, falling
Will you stay home
Will you go
Heaven knows what my future holds
Questions linger on my mind
From daybreak to dark of night
I don't know what's come over me
Can't you see I'm

Cause I'm falling, falling
Girl I'm falling for you
And I pray your falling too
I've been falling, falling
Every since the moment
I laid eyes on you
