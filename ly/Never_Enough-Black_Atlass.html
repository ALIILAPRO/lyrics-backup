		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Said I'm my own worst enemy
Fake love and Hennessy
Nothing else can break me
Like your touch
I wanna feel you next to me
Baby I need your energy
Nothing else can break me
Like your touch
Oh

And I don't wanna hide from those eyes anymore
No more runnin' from us

All I need is your touch
Somehow it's never enough
All I need is your touch
I give you all that I've got
It's never enough
Oh
Oh

Said I'm my own worst enemy
Drownin' in my memories
Nothing else can break me
Like your touch
I wanna feel you next to me
Baby I need your energy
Nothing else can break me
Like your touch
Oh

And I don't wanna hide from those eyes, anymore
No more runnin' from us

All I need is your touch
Somehow it's never enough
All I need is your touch
I give you all that I've got
It's never enough
Oh
Oh
(It's never enough)
