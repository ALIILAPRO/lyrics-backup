		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are the sun, the moon, and stars
Are you and I could never run away from you

You try at working out chaotic things
And why should I believe myself, not you

You say the world is gonna end so soon
And why should I believe myself?

Yeah

The sun, and moon, and stars
Yeah
But I won't save myself from you
You

Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
