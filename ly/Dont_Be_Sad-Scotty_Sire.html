		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been feelin' so down on myself
I been losin' my mind and my health
Think that it's time that I try and see life a new way
I needed advice so I called up my dad
He answered the phone with a joke and a laugh
He said to me, "son, it's your attitude, you need to change"

I'm a ray of sunshine
I fucking love life
Yeah, that's me (la, la, la, la, la)
Never home bein' lonely
Got plenty of homies
Callin' me up
While I was cryin' on the bedroom floor
They told me, "don't be sad anymore"
And I said, "holy shit, that's it
I'm cured"

No good moods ever last too long
Snap my fingers and it's all gone
You can almost see in the wind, it's driftin' away
Sunday night all alone with my thoughts
Thinkin' of someone I'd loved then I'd lost
It's hard but it's right and I knew it was time for a change

I'm a ray of sunshine
I fucking love life
Yeah, that's me (la, la, la, la, la)
Never home bein' lonely
Got plenty of homies
Callin' me up
While I was cryin' on the bedroom floor
They told me, "don't be sad anymore"
And I said, "holy shit, that's it
I'm cured"

Tryin' to fight all the feelings I'm havin'
Why not just cave in and let all the feelings I'm feelin' just happen
It's so hard to function when you let a bad thing get you down
Don't let a bad thing
I let myself cry for a little then I let the happiness come back around
Can I be happy 'bout one thing but sad overall?
Choosin' the way that I feel isn't always my call
Yeah, this isn't a switch you can turn off and on at your will
This is a lever that you've gotta crank
Until you feel the way that you wanna feel (wanna feel)

Like a ray of sunshine
Someone who fuckin' loves life
They say I should just decide
To look on the bright side

I'm a ray of sunshine
I fucking love life (oh, yeah I love life)
Yeah that's me ('cause I'm never)
Never (ever) home bein' lonely (ever) (home bein' lonely)
Got plenty of homies (brrt)
Callin' me up (callin' me up)
While I was cryin' on the bedroom floor
They told me, "Don't be sad anymore"
And I said, "Holy shit, that's it
I'm cured" (whoa)
