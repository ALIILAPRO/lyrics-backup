		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Pum, pa dumb pa dum)
(Pum pa dumb pa dum)
(Pa dumb pa dum)
(Pum pa dumb pa dum)
Teacher's pet (pa dumb pa dumb pa dum)
I want to be teacher's pet (pa dumb pa dum)
I want to be huddled and cuddled as close to you as I can get
(That's the lesson we're guessin' you're best in)
Mm, teacher's pride (pa dumb pa dum)
I want to be teacher's pride (pa dumb pa dum)
I want to be dated, paraded, the one most likely at your side
(Ya got a burnin' yearnin' to learn)
I want to learn all your lips can teach me
One kiss will do at the start (are you really?)
I'm sure with a little homework
I'll graduate to your heart (to your heart)
Teacher's pet (pa dumb pa dum), I want to be teacher's pet (pa dumb pa dum)
I want to take home a diploma and show Ma that ya love me, too
(That ya love me, too)
So I can be teacher's pet long after school is through
(Oh, teacher's pet) Mm, mm
(You want to be teacher's pet) Ah. ah
(You want to be huddled and cuddled as close to him as you can get)
I want to learn all your lips can teach me
One kiss will do at the start
I'm sure with a little homework
I'll graduate to your heart
Teacher's pet (you love the teacher), I want to be teacher's pet (pa dumb pa dum)
I want to take home a diploma and show Ma that ya love me, too (Wow!)
So I can be teacher's pet (yeah!) long after school is through
(Teacher, teacher she loves you)
