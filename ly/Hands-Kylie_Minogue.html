		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whenever I feel your hands all over me
It's like I'm up in heaven, I'm in a dream
I never knew your love, love would set me free

Big drop on the bassline
Tick-tock on the waistline
Don't rush, baby, take time
Yeah, yeah
'Cause I'm down for a late night (night)
And I'm up for a good time (good time)
Ain't nobody killing my vibe (ain't nobody killing my vibe)
Yeah, what you think this is, huh?
You're killin' that, but I'm queenin' this
There ain't no debate when I ride the beat
Go mad for you, oh, when I ride the beat

Right, yeah, everything I do is so right, yeah
Barbie, I'm that cherry on top of the cake
All up in your face
I'm about to give you a taste

Whenever I feel your hands all over me
It's like I'm up in heaven, I'm in a dream
I never knew your love, love would set me free (but now I see)
You're taking me to places I've never been
It's like I'm up in heaven, I'm in a dream
No, I never knew your love would set me free (set me free)

079, boy, call me up
Let me know what's up
Wanna see your wild side, your wild side (I wanna see your)
Baby boy, if you keep it up (up)
I'ma keep you up (up)
If you get the vibe right
Then I'ma make it hot like fire
We can go higher
Take it to the wire
You know what I want

Right, yeah, everything I do is so right, yeah
Barbie, I'm that cherry on top of the cake
All up in your face
I'm about to give you a taste

Baby, come over and pull me in closer
There's something I want you to know

Whenever I feel your hands all over me
It's like I'm up in heaven, I'm in a dream
I never knew your love, love would set me free (but now I see)
You're taking me to places I've never been
It's like I'm up in heaven, I'm in a dream
No, I never knew your love would set me free (set me free)
