		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been with them choppas, call 'em
I just call my gang, we in the paint like Waka Flocka
And if I call my bitch, she want nada, nada
Want the money and respect, in that order
Let's get it, and the bands on me, let's get it
And your bitch on me, I get it, yeah
Racks gon' come wherever, baby, why you in my business?
And it's too much for the feelings
I ain't doin' none just to fit in, rather be me than regret it (yeah)
Too much thots all in my head (yeah), I don't wan' regret them
And I'm steady fightin' demons like the devil sent them
Ain't shit gon' bring me down, only if I let them
But I give 'em respect 'cause at least I met them, yeah

Oh, that bitch you think you had, yeah, we been knew it, yeah
Tecca, bitch, I been on the map, I got to get to it, yeah
And when you keep them tricks all up your sleeve, no, you can't lose it, yeah
Please do not be stupid, you know me, you know I do this, damn
Niggas, they waiting on me, they tryna be G, no, I can't waste my time
Anyone turn on me and we gon' see so, god better save our bond
Not gon' lie, if I wasn't me, I would talk 'bout Tec, 'cause he sound so fire
Know you gon' believe me (what?) Say what I want, 'cause you live and lie

And you live and learn, and you live and learn
She my bitch, on a pending turn, on a pending turn
She got that Cali burn, yeah, but I will not marry her
She on a pending turn, the money gon' make it certain (yeah), yeah

I've been with them choppas, call 'em
I just call my gang, we in the paint like Waka Flocka
And if I call my bitch, she want nada, nada
Want the money and respect, in that order
Let's get it, and the bands on me, let's get it
And your bitch on me, I get it, yeah
Racks gon' come wherever, baby, why you in my business?
And it's too much for the feelings
I ain't doin' none just to fit in, rather be me than regret it (yeah)
Too much thots all in my head (yeah), I don't wan' regret them
And I'm steady fightin' demons like the devil sent them
Ain't shit gon' bring me down, only if I let them
But I give 'em respect 'cause at least I met them, yeah
