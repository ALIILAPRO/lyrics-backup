Huh, huh, huh
Huh, huh, huh, huh
Huh, huh, huh, huh
Huh, huh, huh, huh
Huh, huh, huh

Rockin' that shit with a hunnid, through the whole thing
I got rich before I turned twenty-three like LeBron James
Copped the Bentley Mulsanne, yeah, just to switch lanes
Copped the new SVJ, yeah, just to lose brain
I copped new jewels, this a Stephen Curry tennis chain
Thirty pointers, every night, yeah, me and yo' bitch droppin' thirty pointers
Takin' flights, yeah, with yo' bitch, we in Singapore

I'm that type of nigga that post yo' bitch, and you can't ignore
Now when everybody see that bitch, they like, "Oh, there go Ken Carson's whore"
Yeah, I get fly like a raven, but a nigga not in Baltimore
When you talk to me, you talking the money because I'm a walking ATM
Sold out tour, damn, they should've booked a stadium
She like, "Ain't you Ken Carson? Ain't you X?" Hell yeah, that's him
I got guns bigger than these niggas, I could never be scared of them
He was talking real tough, 'til a nigga shot that lead at him

I get higher than a UFO, bitch, I'm an alien
I just got this ho from the Middle East, she Israelian
I just made a hundred thousand, stuffed it in some raver pants (Yeah)
I just got a paper cut from countin' all this paper, man
I come through, I'm dressed in all black like I was Satan, man
I just make one call like Ken Nugent ain't no savin' him
And they like "Lonely rich as fuck, I guess we should hate on him"
Huh, but I give no fucks, I'm overseas and I did Balenci' my jeans
Huh, I called a brand new ho, she a freak, and she tryna eat my team
Huh, Alex Moss just did my ring, I make 'em kiss my ring
Yeah, she suck me clean, I make her spit just like Listerine
Yeah, I pulled off in a Ghost, baby, like a mystery
Huh, a real big dawg, you ain't seen nun' as big as me
They say they get as paid as me, but I agree to disagree
Itchin-itchin' for that paper, huh, money come to me
My trigger finger itchin' for a halo and I'm finna squeeze

Huh, huh, huh, huh
Huh, huh, huh
Rockin' that shit with a hunnid, through the whole thing
I got rich before I turned twenty-three, like LeBron James
Copped the Bentley Mulsanne, yeah, just to switch lanes
Copped the new SVJ, yeah, just to lose brain
I copped new jewels, this a Stephen Curry tennis chain
Thirty pointers, every night, yeah, me and yo' bitch droppin' thirty pointers
Takin' flights, yeah, with yo' bitch, we in Singapore
