		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm calling to see if you're doing okay 
Have you lost control yet cuz I'm on my way 
Your mama said that you've been hurting yourself 
Your father thinks that I'm the one to be blamed 

Staying together is so fucking hard 
But we don't wanna end up in the lover's graveyard

Staying together is so fucking hard 
But we don't wanna end up in the lover's graveyard

We don't wanna end up in the

Let's save what we have while there's something to save 
Let's leave everything and go live in a cave 
I know you're the only thing I'll ever need 
cs long as you're with me it's okay to bleed 

Staying together is so fucking hard 
But we don't wanna end up in the lover's graveyard

Staying together is so fucking hard 
But we don't wanna end up in the lover's graveyard

We don't wanna end up in the lover's graveyard
We don't wanna end up in the lover's graveyard
