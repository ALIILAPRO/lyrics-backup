		  I'm good I'm good I'm good I'm good
I'm good I'm good I'm good I'm good
I'm good I'm good I'm good I'm good
I'm good I'm good
I've been feeling it in my lungs
Living it when I walk
Singing it in my songs
Killing it when I talk
Really feeling his love yeah
Give him all I that got
Coz I'm knowing all that he's done
And He lit me up and I burn
Eyes on him I'm never gon turn
Made me brand new
Came through when I thought I ain't gone make it through
Made me like you
Change me on a daily so I'm feeling renewed
What you gone do
Take me up to the sky when you calling me home
Couldn't make it on my own
Couldn't do it all alone
I'm steadily changing
He's making me better
I'm turning a new thing
He's making me stronger, yeah yeah
Christ he saved my life oh yeah I'm good, yeah
Christ he saved my life oh yeah I'm good, yeah yeah
Now I'm living God-like
And I'm seated all right
Yeah he cleaned me and renewed me
Now in glory I shine
Christ he saved my life oh yeah I'm good, yeah
Christ he saved my life oh yeah I'm good, yeah yeah
I'm good I'm good I'm good I'm good
I'm good I'm good I'm good I'm good
I'm good I'm good I'm good I'm good
I'm good I'm good I'm good I'm good
I'm good I'm good I'm good I'm good
I'm good I'm good I'm good
Hey
Look I'm too sold out to be a sell out
My bars ain't a prison but I still got bailed out
Drenched in the blood I could never get the smell out
Can't be inbound but I had to get the hell out
Literally he's bigger than me, they love it when I all about God like I'm spilling the beans
Spilling the tea
I got more soul than some black eyed peas
The only reason I'm good cause he greater than me as that's real
I'm a little rachet but I still love Jesus
Got a lot passion but he gave me a reason
Imma be good to the flatline
Got the living water and the new wine
Imma be good on God even when it gets hard imma still have a good time yeah
Pull up to the back of the stage
Going up in ten, let me pray
Let me thank God for the day
'Fore I ever grab a mic
Try to sing some
Put a lil' song in my heart
Give me reason
Called to be the salt
I could use a lil' season
Stay up in the word
Don't try me, hit you with a, please hun
'Cause I'm saved but I'm hood
Tried but I'm good
Bought with a price
I ain't never understood
I ain't never seen ya ice
Compare to the wood
Nailed to the cross
And He died then He stood
Taller than the Burj in Dubai
Many saw Him fly through the sky
I ain't talking Superman
I'm talking Jesus
God came down as a man
Then He freed us
Every other God was like
Hasta la vista
Sins of the world
Man I wouldn't wanna be ya
I'm steadily changing
He's making me better
I'm turning a new thing
He's making me stronger, yeah yeah
Christ he saved my life oh yeah I'm good, yeah
Christ he saved my life oh yeah I'm good, yeah
Yeah I'm living God-like
And I'm seated all right
Yeah he cleaned me and renewed me
Now in glory I shine
Christ he saved my life oh yeah I'm good, yeah
Christ he saved my life oh yeah I'm good, yeah
I'm good I'm good I'm good I'm good
I'm good I'm good I'm good I'm good
I'm good I'm good I'm good I'm good
I'm good I'm good I'm good I'm good
I'm good I'm good I'm good I'm good
I'm good I'm good I'm good I'm good
I'm good I'm good
I will never be the same without You in my life
I know You changed the way I see things through my eyes oh
And every time I call Your name You'll never fade away
I just keep feeling You closer and closer
Just as long as You know that I love Ya
Nothing else will take Your place in my life
Cause You're the only one
I'm steadily changing
He's making me better
I'm turning a new thing
He's making me stronger, yeah yeah
Christ he saved my life oh yeah I'm good
Christ he saved my life oh yeah I'm good
I'm steadily changing
He's making me better
I'm turning a new thing
He's making me stronger, yeah yeah
Christ he saved my life oh yeah I'm good
Oh you are good
You are
