		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Intuition can take you down a winding road
Just cause you feel it doesn’t mean it’s good to go
I’ve always been hard to get
What makes you so different

I’ve been in harmony
So many times you see
A melody that you just can’t shake off
And when you feel the rush
You’ll never get enough
Just like a dream over when you wake up

If I end up in your arms
And stay the night
Don’t go fall into the trap
It’s just a good time
Save your kisses for the one who blows your mind
Because tonight is just a good time
Yeah, tonight it’s just a good time
Shut your mouth and just enjoy the ride

Your premonition isn’t far from the truth
Don’t get it twisted it’s gonna get the best of you
I’m not here to lead you on
But likely it’s gonna go too far

I’ve been in harmony
So many times you see
A melody that you just can’t shake off
And when you feel the rush
You’ll never get enough
Just like a dream over when you wake up

If I end up in your arms
And stay the night
Don’t go fall into the trap
It’s just a good time
Save your kisses for the one who blows your mind
Because tonight is just a good time
Yeah, tonight it’s just a good time
Shut your mouth and just enjoy the ride
Yeah, tonight it’s just a good time
Shut your mouth and just enjoy the ride
Yeah, tonight it’s just a good time
Shut your mouth and just enjoy the ride

When the sun begins to break
I’ll become your best mistake
I may linger on your mind
But tonight is just a good time

If I end up in your arms
And stay the night
Don’t go fall into the trap
It’s just a good time
Save your kisses for the one who blows your mind
Because tonight is just a good time
Yeah, tonight it’s just a good time
Yeah, tonight it’s just a good time
Yeah, tonight it’s just a good time
Yeah, tonight it’s just a good time
