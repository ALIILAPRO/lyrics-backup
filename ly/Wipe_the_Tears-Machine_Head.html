		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ask me how it feels 
To feel like you're a failure 
When everything that's real 
Burns the flame in anger 
I've heard it all before 
I've felt some pain and more 
More than you could ever dream 
More than it probably seems 
I've sat with head in hand 
Stressed by my demands 
Stomach tied in knots 
Alone I've sat and rot 
'Cause the pain from all these fears 
Has built up all these years 
I'll wipe away the tears 
Wipe away the tears 

Don't give in 
Don't give up 

Walk the streets dejected 
Alone and left rejected 
Time does not care 
And sometimes life ain't fair 
Smashing bottles on the ground 
My head begins to pound 
I have lived amongst the garbage 
With those who rape and carnage 
Had many a promise broken 
And broken some myself 
The promise I have kept alive 
Is keep my inner wealth 
With my heart aimed at the world 
Destiny I watch unfurl 
I'll wipe away the tears 
Wipe away the tears 

Don't give in 
Don't give up 

Opportunities 
Wasting life away 
Choked upon its dust 
Puked out in disgust 

Let me tell you how it feels 
To feel like you're a failure 
Been climbing out this gutter 
For what seems like it's forever 
But one thing I must make clear 
The struggle of these years 
Has made every scar the stronger 
My lust for life the longer 
I will fight for what I love 
And I will fight for those I care 
I will fight at anytime 
And I will fight anywhere 
With my heart aimed at this world 
Destiny I watch unfurl 
I'll wipe away the tears 
Wipe away the tears 

Don't give in 
Don't give up
