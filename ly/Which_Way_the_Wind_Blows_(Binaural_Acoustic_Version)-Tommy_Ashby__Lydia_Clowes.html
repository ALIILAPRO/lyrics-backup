		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The river's on the rise, the cold is biting,
Spring is hard to find these days,
We're slowly losing sight, in the violence,
Will we get it right this time around?

You say you've thought about it,
Flowers don't grow in the shadows,
You're not a failure, you can't help,
Which way the wind blows.

I still see a spark in the darkness of the night,
Maybe it's the start of something new,

You say you've thought about it,
Flowers don't grow in the shadows,
You're not a failure, you can't help,
Which way the wind blows.

If I'm a boat, you're the sail,
Turn my bow towards the gale,
If I'm a leaf then you're the tree,
Hold you're arm out, keep hold of me,
If I'm a kite, lost on the wind,
Hold the line, when I'm spiralling,
No way to know the way home,
But I don't care I'll go where the wind blows
 
Where the wind blows,
Where the wind blows,
Where the wind blows,
(I'm not lost)
Where the wind blows,
(I just don't know where I am)
Where the wind blows,
Where the wind blows.
