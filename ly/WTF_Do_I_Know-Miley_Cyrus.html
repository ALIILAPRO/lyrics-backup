		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not trying to have another conversation
Probably not gon' wanna play me on your station
Pouring out a bottle full of my frustration
Here to tell you something that you don't know

I'm the type to drive a pickup through your mansion
I'm completely naked but I'm making it fashion
Maybe getting married just to cause a distraction
Here to tell you something that you don't know

Am I wrong that I moved on and I
And I don't even miss you?
Thought that it'd be you until I die
But I let go

What the fuck do I know? I'm alone
'Cause I couldn't be somebody's hero
You want an apology not from me
Had to leave you in your own misery
So tell me, baby, am I wrong that I moved on and I
And I don't even miss you?
Thought that it'd be you until I die
But I let go, what the fuck do I know?

Trying to see the stars through the new pollution
Think that I'm the problem, honey, I'm the solution
Maybe all the chaos is for your amusement
Here to tell you something that you don't know

Put you on a pedestal, you're craving the spotlight
Desperate for attention, nose is bloody, it's daylight
Waking up with people that we met for the first time
Loved it then I hated it, and let you go

What the fuck do I know? I'm alone
'Cause I couldn't be somebody's hero
You want an apology, not from me
Had to leave you in your own misery
So tell me, baby, am I wrong that I moved on and I
And I don't even miss you?
Thought that it'd be you until I die
But I let go, what the fuck do I know?

What the fuck do I know? I'm alone
'Cause I couldn't be somebody's hero
You want an apology, not from me
Had to leave you in your own misery
So tell me, baby, am I wrong that I moved on and I
And I don't even miss you?
Thought that it'd be you until I die
But I let it go, what the fuck do I know?
