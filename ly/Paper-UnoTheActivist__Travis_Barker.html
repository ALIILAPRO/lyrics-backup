		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What, what, what, what
What, what, what, what
What, what, what, what
What, what (Uno, I killed it) ooh, dig

All about this paper
All about it, all about this paper
Lately it's like everything's about a hater
Seen a dollar bill and I had
To go and chase it
Like Meek Milly, I'm a dream chaser
They freed Meek Milly so them dreams
I had to chase 'em
And everybody say I'm the most underrated
Well, I'm just starting to
Think these niggas overrated

I told lil' baby to hurry up and wait
You better catch on before it is too late
She trying to suck up or show me lot of ways
These niggas hating
They want to be in my place
My diamonds make you feel some type of way
I'm trying to make a mill'
All type of ways
They just freed Meek Mill, dreams
I'ma chase
This for my real niggas beating the case
Bitch, you know I keep all
The shells by the case i'm on the block
Beat on my chest like a ape
I am the Act, but I'm Uno the Great
I'm tryna see how many licks do it take
Till we walk in Gucci, buy out the place

All about this paper
All about it, all about this paper
Lately it's like everything's about a hater
Seen a dollar bill and I had
To go and chase it
Like Meek Milly, I'm a dream chaser
They freed Meek Milly so them dreams
I had to chase 'em
And everybody say I'm the most underrated
Well, I'm just starting to
Think these niggas overrated

I can't believe what happened before my eyes
Act like they love me then
Hate me in disguise
Real eyes realize real lies
It's high demand so that dope I supply
I'm taking off
You might wanna get on this flight
I'm telling you
This ain't happen overnight
I feel like Floyd, I ain't losing the fight
They act like bitches
Doing shit out of spite
I know these niggas loving me all despite
How I came up, they wanna be in my site
If I don't hear 'em
I don't see 'em in sight
I won't have no reason to
Bring out that pipe
I got my main bitch wishing me a good night
Shoot at his feet, I make a nigga get light
If she with me you know
She never gon' fright he run up on me
I'm gon' knock out his lights
Cop pull me over
She ain't read me my rights

All about this paper
All about it, all about this paper
Lately it's like everything's about a hater
Seen a dollar bill and I had
To go and chase it
Like Meek Milly, I'm a dream chaser
They freed Meek Milly so them dreams
I had to chase 'em
And everybody say I'm the most underrated
Well, I'm just starting to
Think these niggas overrated
