		  Wonderful God beauty of a Savior
You are a wonderful God oh my Creator
You are a wonderful God beauty of a Savior
You are a wonderful God oh my Creator
Only You are

Only You, are worthy of the glory, God
Only You, deserve the highest honor
Everything, You've given me I give
Right back to You
What a joy it is to give my life to such a

Wonderful God beauty of a Savior
You are a wonderful God oh my Creator
You are a wonderful God beauty of a Savior
You are a wonderful God oh my Creator
Only You are

For the Lord is my rock
My fortress, and deliver my God, my rock
In whom I take my refuge
My shield and my salvation
I love You, Lord, my strength
I call upon Your name
You're worthy to be praised
I am saved from my enemy
When the cords of death entangle me
I lift my voice up to the

Wonderful God beauty of a Savior
You are a wonderful God oh my Creator
Only You are
