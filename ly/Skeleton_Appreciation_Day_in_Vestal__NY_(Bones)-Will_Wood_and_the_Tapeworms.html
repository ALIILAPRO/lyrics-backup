		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To cut down on my silhouette
My favorite foods are smoke and hearts
My leftover frets forget stiletto-self vendettas
While my cracking backbone lacks but backs up my false starts
cll nightmares start as dreams
cnd I hear my subconscious screaming
They say that beauty's just skin deep
So naturally, please show me your

Bones, bones, bones, let me see your bones
Well, I don't wanna know if the feeling follows home
Bones, bones, bones, hell, we're all alone
If I come home, baby, will you show your bones?

Lumps in throats and petticoats
Your baby teeth would pray for you
c selfish book is always open
cnd some of the best liars only want the truth
cll love starts as a scheme
So wake me up, I'm tired of sleeping
They say that beauty's just skin deep
So obviously please show me your

Bones, bones, bones, let me see your bones
Well, I don't wanna know if the feeling follows home
Bones, bones, bones, hell, we're all alone
If I come home, baby, will you show your bones?

cll nightmares start as dreams, all love starts as a scheme
Give me all your LSD so I can feel my mind unweave again
They say that beauty's just skin deep
So cna stands and rends the rancid meat from her

Bones, bones, bones, let me see your bones
Well, I don't wanna know if the feeling follows home
Bones, bones, bones, hell, we're all alone
If I come home, baby, will you show your

Bones, bones, bones, I can see my bones
Well I don't wanna know if the feeling follows home
Bones, bones, bones, hell, we're all alone
If I come home, baby, will you show your bones?

My bones, your bones
Tell me you can see my bones
My bones, your bones
Tell me you can see them
