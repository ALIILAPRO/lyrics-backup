		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pre, pre, pretty green bud
All in my blunt
Oh I need it
We can take off now
Oh marijuana, yeah

Pre, pre, pretty green bud
All in my blood
Oh I need it
We can take off, now
Oh I know you wanna, smoke

I I I be on it all day
Like my nigga Big Boy said
That's the only thing that keeps me level
Up in my crazy head
Stoned on the run, run
No fun if not
It's Scotty from the hate mail read
Man I swear to keep it 1 hundred
If I ain't have it then I'd be dead
My souls been fed tonight
Everything that I choose
Still can't forget Grey Goose
Converse covered with mixer juice
And all my niggas rollin up in the booth
Who got me on another one
Someone please roll me another one
They tell me all good things must end
Well those muthafucka's ain't have this friend
I keep it.

Pre pre pretty green bud
All in my blood
Ohhh I need it
We can take off now
Ohh marijuana, yeah

Pre pre pretty green bud
All in my blood
Oh I need it
We can take off, now
Oh I know you wanna, smoke

Lalala yeah
Lalala yeah
Lalala yeah, marijuana
Lalala yeah
Lalala yeah
Lalala yeah
Ohh I know you wanna, smoke

Pre, pre, pretty green bud
All in my blood
Oh I need it
We can take off now
Oh marijuana, yeah

Pre, pre, pretty green bud
All in my blood
Oh I need it
We can take off, now
Oh I know you wanna, yeah

Pre, pre, pretty green bud
All in my blood
Oh I need it
We can take off, now
Oh I know you wanna, smoke

Always had my back, hey
Always had my back, hey
Always had my back, hey
Marijuana had my back yea
Always had my back, yea
Always had my back, hey
Always had my back, hey
Marijuana had my back, my back

Whoa, never left me lonely
It's gon' be okay
Trust me, it's gon' be okay
Oh oh oh oh
