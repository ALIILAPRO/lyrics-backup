		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't leave me all alone
Just drop me off at home
I'll be fine, it's not the first
Just like last night but a little worse, and

She said that I'm not the one that she thinks about and
She said it stopped being fun, I just bring her down
I said, "Don't let your future be destroyed by my past"
She said, "Don't let my door hit your ass", fuck yeah

Just give me one more chance, I'll try this time
I'll give you yours, I won't take mine
I'll listen up, pretend to care
Go on ahead, I'll meet you there, and

She said that I'm not the one that she thinks about and
She said it stopped being fun, I just bring her down
I said, "Don't let your future be destroyed by my past"
She said, "Don't let my door hit your ass", bass solo

Let's try this one more time with feeling
One more time with feeling
One more time with feeling
One more time with feeling

She said that I'm not the one that she thinks about and
She said it stopped being fun, I just bring her down
I said, "Don't let your future be destroyed by my past"
She said, "Don't let my door hit your ass"

And don't leave me all alone
Just drop me off at home and I'll be fine

You will be fine you fucking asshole, wow
Excuse me, thank you
Heya, hey Mark, we have a very special person here
That wants to say hi, you guys, this is Satan

Hello kids, if you guys will take off your pants
Then maybe I'll be a little bit more happy
I want to have fun with you but I'm gonna have to see your dick, plural
I have to go away now because there's another song and I've a boner
You guys mind if I got a boner kids?
