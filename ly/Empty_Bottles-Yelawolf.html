		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground
Silhouettes of people dancing
To an unfamiliar sound
Hello stranger
Can I call you a friend? My friend, I'm going down
With empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground

Ground bottle six with the permanent bliss
Razor sharp glass lips, give me a kiss
Eyes fixated with the familiar shape
Black label, white letters, they integrate
Cubans in the bar room with harpoons
I bloom in the night fog like mushrooms
See every bullet hole in the window of my past
Now that's what I call a shot glass (two, three, four)

Empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground
Silhouettes of people dancing
To an unfamiliar sound
Hello stranger
Can I call you a friend? My friend, I'm going down
With empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground

Count the cracks on the sidewalk
Pack the cigarette box in my left palm
Flame on the tip of a smoke
I don't know where the light came from
Legs like a ghost, I still walk
Whole world mushed concrete, feels soft
Blinded by the cameras pop flash
I'm a big fan, shot glass? (Two, three, four)

Empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground
Silhouettes of people dancing
To an unfamiliar sound
Hello stranger
Can I call you a friend? My friend, I'm going down
With empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground

Oh, what a life it's been
What about my life in there? What about the would and when's?
If's, maybe's, could-have-been's? You didn't know shit about me, man
You didn't go to school in the clothes that I had to wear back then
Look at you, fucking faggot, what you looking at, punk?
What, bitch? Give me another shot, hey, what you want?
Make it a double, fuck it, a triple, fuck it, give me the bottle
And then it's bottoms-up, what a positive role model

Hey Wolf, Wolf!
Come on man, it's time to go

Wake up in the morning feeling like I'm not awake at all
Take a Tylenol, shake it off
Wanna take another shot of Jack but Jack D shot me with a sawed-off

Wake up in the morning feeling like I'm not awake at all
Take a Tylenol, shake it off
Wanna take another shot of Jack but Jack D shot me with a sawed-off

Empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground
Silhouettes of people dancing
To an unfamiliar sound
Hello stranger
Can I call you a friend? My friend, I'm going down
With empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground

Empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground
Silhouettes of people dancing
To an unfamiliar sound
Hello stranger
Can I call you a friend? My friend, I'm going down
With empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground
