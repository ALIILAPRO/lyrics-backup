		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feeling low
Going down slow
Make you quake
Make a body shake
Trying to hold you down
They can't push you around
They try to hold you back
Getting on the right track

Hard times
Blue and sad
Don't you cross the line
Run, run make it fun
Freeing up the time

Hidey plumping
Feet are jumping
This heart a loving
Keeps me running
They try to hold you down
But they can't push you around
Trying to hold you back
Getting on the right track

Hard times
Blue and sad
Don't you cross the line
Run, run make it fun
Freeing up the time
Hard times
Get on top
Follow me down the line
Hard times
Get online
Make a grown man blind

Hard times, these hard times
Sure ain't been good to me
Hard times, hard times
Sure been misery

Hard times
Blue and sad
Don't you cross the line
Run, run make it fun
Freeing up the time
Hard times
Get on time
Follow me down the line
Hard times
Get online
Make a grown man blind
