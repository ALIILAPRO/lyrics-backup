		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  i’ll be damned 

Verse 1: 
There’s a hole in my chest that I’ve tried to patch up with some stitching 
Put this knife in my back just to feel all the pain I’ve been giving
And still I found an angel who put all my past on the burner 
But I know the dirt in my nails and the dust in my veins don’t deserve her 

Pre 1: 
Told her fire and brimstone my fate 
I got blood on my shirt and I’m stained 
I’m not worth all these prices you’ll pay 
Don’t you follow me down to this grave 
And she said

Chorus: 
I’ll be damned 
Pull my hand 
Down if you have to 
If heaven won’t have you then 
I’ll be damned 
For half the man 
Devil may haunt you 
But if heaven won’t want you then 

I’ll be damned 
I’ll be damned
I’ll be damned
I’ll be damned
I’ll be damned
(I’ll be damned)

V2: 
Smoke in my lungs, she don’t care I’m too high to deliver 
And she gave up her halo and ripped up her wings for a sinner (what she gonna tell me now?) When I gave her every last reason to leave me in pieces 
She just smiles and she pulls me together with all my demons
I still can’t believe it 
When she said

Chorus: 
I’ll be damned 
Pull my hand 
Down if you have to 
If heaven won’t have you then 
I’ll be damned 
For half the man 
Devil may haunt you 
But if heaven won’t want you then 

I’ll be damned 
I’ll be damned
I’ll be damned
I’ll be damned
I’ll be damned

Bridge: 
Told her fire and brimstone my fate 
I got blood on my shirt and I'm stained 
I ain’t worth all these prices you’ll pay 
Don’t you follow me down to this grave 
She said

Chorus: 
I’ll be damned 
Pull my hand 
Down if you have to 
If heaven won’t have you then 
I’ll be damned 
For half the man 
Devil may haunt you 
But if heaven won’t want you then 

I’ll be damned 
I’ll be damned
I’ll be damned
I’ll be damned
I’ll be damned
I’ll be damned
