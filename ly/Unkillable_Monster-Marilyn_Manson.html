		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How the fuck are we supposed to know
When I'm a monster, the way
You refuse to die?
How the fuck are we supposed to know
If we're in love or if in we're pain

I'm a tightrope walker
I can't find my circus
And I'm damaged beyond repair
You're just a coffin of a girl I knew
And I'm buried in you

You never said "I'll end up like this"

You never said "I'll end up like this"
No, no, no, no

Sometimes I dream I'm an exterminating angel
A traveling executioner from heaven
Sent to give you the prettiest death I know
Call the grave and make our reservations

You never said "I'll end up like this"
You never said "I'll end up like this", no

You never said "I'll end up like this"
You never said "I'll end up like this", no, no, no, no, no, no

Are we in love or are we in pain?
Are we in love or are we in pain?
Are we in love or are we in pain?
Are we in love or are we in pain?

How the fuck are we supposed to know
When I'm a monster, the way
You refuse to die?
How the fuck are we supposed to know
If we're in love or if in we're pain
Why is my wound a front door to you?
Am I my own shadow?

Why is my wound a front door to you?
Am I my own shadow?
