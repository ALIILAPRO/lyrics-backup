		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

I can't even picture being pop again
Nah-nah, nah-nah-nah not again
I'm from New York but I'm never rockin' Timbs
She caught me fuckin' with her friend
And after that, we never spoke again

Last time we fucked
I wish I would've knew that it would be the last time
Girl, I would've fucked you like I had time
Last time, you was actin' mad shy
I forgot to tell you I was high but I want you really bad, right
Any time you said I give you bad vibes, I would give you backshots 
Then it's over for you, then we'd would crash, baby
You the one that told me I could rule the world
And if I do, we gon' split it fifty-fifty like the last slice

It's okay if they jealous, we got double-R umbrellas
In a Lamborghini, don't know if it's Urus or it's yours
Bitches only want Margiela's, they just don't know how to tell us
It ain't trickin' if you got it, but it's tricky so I got it on me
Two .22s in my shoes like I'm Biggie
Got the shotty on my lap, where the fuck is Ricky goin'?
Big body Bentley rollin' (woo), ass and titties (woo)
And Mike Amiri shit be on me, niggas in my city know that
Every single shot goin', ask Chris Brickley
By the way, before I pulled up to the gym, I had the Jimmy
Police tryna get me, I'm lik, "So what if I'm grippy'd up?"
Lil' broski ain't a killer, they ask why I call him killy
No SIM card on my phone, keep a semi automatically
I rather get caught with it than without it
Niggas mad at me and I know it's my fault, but I can't help it
If she's bad-bad, mad, baddies around me, we on everythin'
And honestly, I only pick you up because you're pretty
And I'm picky, let you pick a VVS's if you (woo)
Baby girl, don't wait for it, love me now
Now I got twenty-one questions for you

Last time we fucked
Why couldn't you just say it was the last time?
Girl, I would've fucked you like I had time
Last time, you was actin' mad shy
Forgot to tell you I was high but I want you really bad, right
Any time you said I give you bad vibes, I would give you backshots 
Then it's over for you, then we'd would crash, baby
You the one that told me I could rule the world
And if I do, we gon' split it fifty-fifty like the last slice

Be-Been around the world, and these hoes don't mean nothin' to me (phew)
Fuck like I love her, when I'm done, it's just fun to me (it's just fun to me, nah)
Real street nigga, she just love I got a gun with me (got it)
Only way I love her when I'm bustin' and she cum with me (come on)
Last time I seen her, she told me she done with me
Fightin' fed cases, she ain't gon' go on the run with me (yeah)
Goin' back and forth, bitch, you try and match your tongue with me
All I want is love, bitch, you know I got my son with me (you know that)
And I got the chop' with me while I got my son with me (ayy)
Facin' all this trauma, why you fuck me if you done with me? (Why?)
How you bitchin' on the 'Gram if you miss me? (You miss me)
I be feelin' like you stand when you kiss me (mwah, come back)
All these bitches on my dick, they just list me
I don't kick it with them hoes, 'cause it's risky (way too risky)
Lot of bitches I be knowin' wanna get me
I be ridin' with my pole, plus a fifty (grr, woo, woo, woo, woo)

Last time we fucked
I wish I would've knew that it would be the last time
Girl, I would've fucked you like I had time
Last time, you was actin' mad shy
I forgot to tell you I was high but I want you really bad, right
Any time you said I give you bad vibes, I would give you backshots 
Then it's over for you, then we'd would crash, baby
You the one that told me I could rule the world
And if I do, we gon' split it fifty-fifty like the last slice
