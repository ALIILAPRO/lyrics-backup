		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I understand your every fear 
Your every pain your every tear 
With every struggle you conquer 
Turn heart to steel 
And will to iron 

You want more? 
You'll get it 
Determined, ferocious 
Grit down and bite the bullet 
Dare to unbind 
Smash and redefine 

The hate you feel is nothing more 
Than love you feel to win this war 
The battle that rages inside you 
With bloodlust 
You must unchain your shackles 

You want more? 
You'll get it 
Determined, ferocious 
Grit down and bite the bullet 
Dare to unbind 
Smash and redefine 

Lion heart 
Never give in 
Unsatisfy every weakness 

You want more? 
You'll get it 
Determined, ferocious 
Grit down and bite the bullet 
Dare to unbind 
Smash and redefine
