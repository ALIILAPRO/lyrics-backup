		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been to many places
I've met different races
I've seen so many faces
But it's you I can't forget

I've been through high & low
Till I got no where to go
I got this funny feeling
That it's you who I'm still missing

So baby c'mon
Don't let this go
You know I love you so!
Don't throw away
Let our love grow
I can't let you go!

We've always been so strong
We almost had it all
Don't give up now on me
Cause, we will always be

Let's come to think of this
Look at all we could miss
I can't let this happen
Cause it's you
That I'll always be loving
