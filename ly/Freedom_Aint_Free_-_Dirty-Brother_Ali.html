		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Hook:]
Ain't no where to run
There ain't nothing here for free

[Verse 1:]
I don't like my life I gut it, rebuild it, fuck it
Keep nothing but God and my children
I kill the devil wherever he resides
Even if he hotter than me he got to die
I killed little Jason he was only fifteen
Sewd his good traits together, made Ali
Feeled his lungs with the Koran until he breathe
Let him walk but kept him on a short leash
Here he stand now seventeen year old man child
Ain't ask nobody for a mother fucking hand out
He trying to carry heaven on his back
Jumped the broom with a stranger, he ain't never look back
What he know about how the world spin?
Bless his heart he a virgin never even had a girlfriend
Want to be a man so bad that he can taste it
His family fell apart and he's tryin' to replace it
You'll find in him a heart that is second to none
But I know old soul that his lessons ain't done so
I stand willing to kill him again
If to grow he got to shed his skin then let it be done

[Chorus]
Ain't no where to run
There ain't nothing here for free
See what I see and know that freedom ain't free lord
Ain't no where to run
There ain't nothing here for free
He'll see what I see and know that freedom ain't free

[Verse 2:]
One half of all the two leggeds on the scene are too timid to dream
Cause failure is far too depressing it would seem
So they take what's given
That's your decison, I just don't consider that living
Shit if I'ma die whether or not I try
I might as well let the dice fly
I'm hot knifed through butter in the night sky
It shouldn't take a genius to see there's hunger in my eye
So I use blood and sweat to butter my bread
Cause this cold world couldn't give a fuck if I'm fed
I ain't curled up in my bed
If I don't set the world ablaze trust it ain't because of nothing I did
Listen I don't think God's obligated to touch you
If your ass would rather live in shit than work a shovel
I refuse to let the sun set on me again
Til' the end I'm a one man army, friend

[Chorus x2]
Ain't no where to run
There ain't nothing here for free
See what I see and know that freedom ain't free lord
Ain't no where to run
There ain't nothing here for free
You'll see what I see and know that freedom ain't free
