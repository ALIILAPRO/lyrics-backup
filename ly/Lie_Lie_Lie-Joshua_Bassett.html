		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So they told me all the things that you said 
Running all over my name, oh
And you're acting oh so innocent 
Like I'm the only one to blame 

You've been lying to yourself 
Lie to everyone else 
Only thinking about yourself 
Darling what the hell 

I know what you say about me 
I hope that it makes you happy 
You can't seem to get me off your mind, oh
I know you're lying through your teeth 
You told them the lies that you told me 
I've had enough of it this time 

So you can lie, lie, lie, lie, lie 
Go ahead and try, try, try, try, try 
It won't work this time, time, time, time, time 
I kiss your ass goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye 
Kiss your ass goodbye 

So you're telling them it's all my fault 
You're the victim this time, oh
And you wanna make it seem like it's your call 
You're acting like everything's fine 

You've been lying to yourself 
Lie to everyone else 
Only thinking about yourself 
Darling what the hell 

I know what you say about me 
I hope that it makes you happy 
You can't seem to get me off your mind, oh
I know you're lying through your teeth 
You told them the lies that you told me 
I've had enough of it this time 

I know what you say about me 
Oh, you can't get me off your mind 

I know what you say about me 
I hope that it makes you happy
You can't seem to get me off your mind, oh
I know you're lying through your teeth 
You told them the lies that you told me 
I've had enough of it this time 

You can lie, lie, lie, lie, lie 
Go ahead and try, try, try, try, try 
It won't work this time, time, time, time, time 
I kiss your ass goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye 
Kiss your ass goodbye
