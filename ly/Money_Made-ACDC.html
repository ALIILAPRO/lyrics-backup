		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Work work money made [Repeat: x4]

Then went down to LA,
They roped 'em in,
She couldn't get away,
Spending cash all about,
The die was cast,
There's no burning out amount of money made

Work work money made,
Champagne life, high on display,
Work work money made,
Work work money made,
You keep it up, you get it made,
Work work money made,

Can't bring me into Hollywood,
See you livin' it up,
It feels mighty good,
Recommendations all around,
Come taste the sweet life,
That's what it's all about,
That money made

Work work money made,
Champagne life, high on display,
Work work money made,
Work work money made,
Keep it up, you make the grade,
Work work money made,
That money made,

Hit the gas,

That kind of life is good for her,
Getting out of bed nearly half past four,
Her swimming pool is the biggest about,
So don't you call her cause she ain't around,
That money made,
Oh, money made,
Oh, that money made,

Work work money made, that money made,
Work work money made, strings of pearls all kinds of change,
Work work money made, that money made,
Work work money made, shake baby shake,
Shake it baby shake it, shake baby shake,
Shake baby shake, shake baby shake, shake baby shake, (Fade)
