		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want some more, I want some more, yeah
I want some more, I want some more, yeah
I want some more, I want some more, yeah
I'm gonna, gonna break the brake

I'm just gon' break the brake

닥치는 대로 달려, 뭔데? 무서운 게
제멋대로 끓어올라 brave heart
더 말할 틈이 없어, 고삐는 풀어놨어
겁먹은 사람 다 뛰어내려

Oh 찢어질 듯한 track
악 소리치는 brake
눈 돌아가 it's close to heaven
Why am I thirsty? You know why am I hungry?
실핏줄이 터져도 성에 차지 않아 maxed out
(Alright, I'm ready, go, go, go)

I'm just gon' break the brake
I want some more, I want some more, yeah
I want some more, I want some more, yeah
I want some more, I want some more, yeah
I'm gonna, gonna break the brake

Give me some more, give me some more, yeah
Give me some more, give me some more, yeah
Give me some more, give me some more, yeah
Gasoline 채워 break the brake

Press it down in action
There ain't wrong direction
Drive for liberation
핸들을 뽑고 달려, 달려

Press it down in action
There ain't wrong direction
Drive for liberation
Keep the pedal to the metal, metal

Ayy 반복되는 굉음 소리
Ayy 바로 자극돼 adrenaline
Somehow, somehow 거친 길만 driving
See ya, see ya, gonna break it

You can't bring me down
'Cause I'll never die
넌 뒤쳐져 가, 당연하단다
눈앞에 뵈는 것은 없고 발이 닿는 대로 drive
Let's ride, baby

Oh 찢어질 듯한 track
악 소리치는 brake
눈 돌아가 it's close to heaven
Why am I thirsty? You know why am I hungry?
실핏줄이 터져도 성에 차지 않아 maxed out
(Alright, I'm ready, go, go, go)

I'm just gon' break the brake
I want some more, I want some more, yeah
I want some more, I want some more, yeah
I want some more, I want some more, yeah
I'm gonna, gonna break the brake

Give me some more, give me some more, yeah
Give me some more, give me some more, yeah
Give me some more, give me some more, yeah
Gasoline 채워 break the brake

I'm just gon' break the brake
I want some more, I want some more, yeah
I want some more, I want some more, yeah
I want some more, I want some more, yeah
I'm gonna, gonna break the brake

Give me some more, give me some more, yeah
Give me some more, give me some more, yeah
Give me some more, give me some more, yeah
Gasoline 채워 break the brake

I'm just gonna break the brake
Gasoline 채워 break the brake
I want some more, I want some more, yeah
I'm just gonna break the brake
Give me some more, give me some more, yeah
Gasoline 채워 break the brake
