		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm taking the lead like one two three
I can move I can groove
Come on follow me
I'm taking the lead
That's right I'm queen
If ya know what's good
Come on follow me
'Cause it's about to go down
If you wanna make your highness proud
I'm taking the lead like one two three
Come on follow me
Come on follow me
Taking the lead one two three
Come on follow me
I'm taking the lead like one two three
I can move I can groove
Come on follow me
I'm taking the lead
That's right I'm queen
If ya know what's good
Come on follow me
'Cause it's about to go down
If you wanna make your highness proud
I'm taking the lead like one two three
Come on follow me
Come on follow me
Come on follow me
Come on follow me
Come on follow me
Come On Follow Me
I'm taking the lead like one two three
I can move I can groove
Come on follow me
I'm taking the lead
That's right I'm queen
If ya know what's good
Come on follow me
'Cause it's about to go down
If you wanna make your highness proud
I'm taking the lead like one two three
Come on follow me
