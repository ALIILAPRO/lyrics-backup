		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been out for so long, the days slipped by again
I can't sleep since I stopped caring
I can't sleep since I stopped caring
I'll stay out until my lungs bleed
And I can't tell daylight from streetlights any fucking-more
As he cast his shadow

I've seen this road a thousand times and I can't look back
And I've seen this road a thousand times and I can't, I'm not looking back

This is so unfamiliar, death is no man's friend
And I'll stay here until I hear him roar
Death is screaming my name
Yet I refuse to listen
I refuse to listen to listen to him

I refuse, I refuse, I refuse
To listen

I'll stay out until my lungs bleed
And I can't tell daylight from streetlights any-fucking-more
As he cast his shadow

I've seen this road a thousand times and I can't look back
And I've seen this road a thousand times and I can't, I'm not looking back

I can't sit here forever
Watch me rise again
Watch me rise back up
Forever would just be so easy to fall into
Forever would just be so easy to fall into
Yet I'll stay out until my lungs bleed
Forever is the easy option but I won't take it
I won't take it, no

The choices I've made will lead me to an early fucking grave

Death is screaming,
Death is screaming,
Death is screaming, my fucking name
