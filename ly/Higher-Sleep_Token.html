		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say you won't begin again
Capitulate and let me in
'Cause I am a fire and you are dry as bone
You are taking your time
You are killing me slow
And I know we instigate go back and forth
Lacerate 'Cause you can remember only
When you're alone
I am granting you more than
The debt that I owe

'Cause I look for scarlet and
You look for ultraviolet
And we are exhausted by all this pretending
We just can't resist the violence
And you need a melody
I only need the silence
But each time we battle
The blood and the fury takes
Us a little higher

With all that you believe
You still refuse to shelter me
'Cause I am a danger and you're
A long way from home you are one among many
But you're now on your own
And I hate the way you look at
Me when I am not understood
'Cause you can remember only
When you're alone
I am granting you more than
The debt that I owe

You won't begin again you won't begin again
You won't begin again you won't begin again

'Cause I look for scarlet and
You look for ultraviolet
And we are exhausted by all this pretending
We just can't resist the violence
And you need a melody
I only need the silence
But each time we battle
The blood and the fury takes
Us a little higher

The debt that I owe the debt that I owe
The debt that I owe the debt that I owe
The debt that I owe the debt that I owe

The debt that I owe
