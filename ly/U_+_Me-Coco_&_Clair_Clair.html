		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I guess I love you, baby)

You and me in my crib
Take another sip
Poppin' bottles all night long
I'm singin' my favorite song
It goes like this
"It's Britney, bitch"

You and me hit the town (A-town)
Buy another round (get lit)
Poppin' bottles all night long (pop pop)
They're playin' my favorite song
It goes like this
"It's Britney, bitch" (bitch)

Decked out all pink
Lookin' real sexy
Got my honies with me
Keys to the Bentley
I see that he texted me
The lip gloss is Fenty
Not worried about the boy
'Cause I know I got plenty
When we at the club I got the crew in the duffy
Couple wet wipes in case a groupie try to touch me
I only text back so he knows that he's lucky
But when I get home
He in the bed all comfy

Hey, sorry I missed your call
It's been a really long night, but we're leavin' the club now
I miss you, and I hope you're awake when I get back
Alright, bye

You and me in my crib (my crib)
Take another sip (shots shots)
Poppin' bottles all night long (pop pop)
I'm singin' my favorite song
It goes like this
"It's Britney, bitch" (bitch)

You and me hit the town (A-town)
Buy another round (get lit)
Poppin' bottles all night long (pop pop)
They're playin' my favorite song
It goes like this
"It's Britney, bitch" (bitch)

Even when I'm out
It's you I'm thinkin' about
They love me for my clout
You like it when I pout
Even when I'm out
It's you I'm thinkin' about
Guess I love you, baby
Forever no doubt

You and me in my crib (my crib)
Take another sip (shots shots)
Poppin' bottles all night long (pop pop)
I'm sin'in' my favorite song
It goes like this
"It's Britney, bitch" (bitch)

A-town
Get lit
Pop pop
It goes like this
"It's Britney, bitch" (bitch)
