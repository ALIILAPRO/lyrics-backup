		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl
Girl, don't be scared
I know what you've done
I hope you had fun
But I want you gone
Girl, pack your bags
And by tomorrow
Want you out the door
Out of mind
Out of sight

I don't care where you've been
I don't care where you're at
But this bitch got me trippin'
She got me down bad
You hate being alone
Need somebody to call
But I won't pick up the damn phone

Girl
You know that I care
I love when you stare
Girl, I swear
Don't want it to end (yeah, yeah, nah, nah, nah, yeah)

Girl, pack your bags (uh, oh)
And by tomorrow (nah, uh)
Want you out the door (out the door)
Out of mind (out of mind)
Out of sight (yeah, yeah)
I don't care where you've been
I don't care where you're at
But this bitch got me trippin'
She got me down bad
You hate being alone
Need somebody to call
But I won't pick up the damn phone
I don't care where you've been (no, I don't care)
I don't care where you're at
But this bitch got me trippin' (nah, nah)
She got me down bad
You hate being alone (know that you hate it)
Need somebody to call (body to call)
But I won't pick up the damn phone
