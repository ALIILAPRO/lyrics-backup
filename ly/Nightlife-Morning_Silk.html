		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How am I to blame her, when
I can never let you go
I will always be the one who stays
To see the inner change
I never want to go
 
I was wide-eyed 
Caught in the headlights, 
Baby the nightlife's running right over you

I don't wanna wake up 
I just wanna stay up
I don't need to say much
This time I'm waiting for the changes
Guilty at sunrise
But I think I'm alright
Want to do it all

I was wide-eyed 
Caught in the headlights
Baby the nightlife's running right over you
 
We tried
Chasing the redlights 
Living the nightlife
What more is there to do 
 
It's all the same 
If you don't love me
Don't gotta change 
If you don't care
I'll be there
I didn't want to feel this lonely
I'm better off when you're right here
I'll be there

Wide-eyed 
Caught in the headlights
Baby the nightlife's running right over you
 
We tried
Chasing the redlights 
Living the nightlife
What more is there to do
 
Wide-eyed 
Caught in the headlights
Baby the nightlife's running right over you
 
We tried
Chasing the redlights 
Living the nightlife
What more is there to do
