		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The dawn of century a boy born by a lake
Resettled from karelia's plains
Go to a man in exile as the Great War came
Unleashed a shadow on his world

Witold, Witold, who knows his name?

Inmate in hell or a hero in prison?
Soldier in Auschwitz who knows his name
Locked in a cell, waging war from the prison
Hiding in Auschwitz who hides behind 4859

Outside of never came decided to break free
The end of april '43
Joined the uprising, fight on the streets while hiding his rank
Takes command all for serving his country in need

Witold, Witold, who knows his name?

Inmate in hell or a hero in prison?
Soldier in Auschwitz who knows his name
Locked in a cell, waging war from the prison
Hiding in Auschwitz who hides behind 4859

Sent to the prison where the heroes are judged as traitors
Accused of treason by his own
Sentenced by countrymen under pressure of foreign influence
Men he once fought to free

Inmate in hell or a hero in prison?
Soldier in Auschwitz we know his name
Locked in a cell, waging war from the prison
Hiding in Auschwitz he hides behind 4859
