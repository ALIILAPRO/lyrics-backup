		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did you hear that?
I'm awake
No way I'm going back to sleep right now.
Did you see that?
Feel the shake
They're comin up from the underground,  Woah oh 
Taking cover in the Thunderclouds

See it coming far away
Within moments they'll invade the town
Hear the Whispers turn to screams
Somethings not right 
get away right now
Grab what you can and lets get out

When the world falls apart
You feel the blood running from your heart
Sometimes it hurts to tally up your scars
It's time to show who you are
When you're feeling so lost in the dark
You feel the blood running from your heart
You should be proud to tally up your scars
It's time to show who you are
Piercing your light through the dark

Kick the door in 
Board it up
We're far away now I think we're safe
Seal the windows 
Cut the lights 
Don't let anything inside this place
Nobody's gonna come or go

I lay myself down 
To lick my wounds
I'm pacin' circles 
Inside this room
I don't think this is the way
I need to end this face to face

Take. 
the first. 
Step.

Take. 
the first. 
Step..

Take. 
the first. 
Step...

now
