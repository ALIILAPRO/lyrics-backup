		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Harlem River, talk to me
Tell me what you think about
Harlem River I'm in love, love, love, love

Harlem River, talk to me
Where we headed now?
Harlem River I'm in love, love, love, love
All because of you

In my pearl and my diamond shoes
I've climbed the cloud, now I stole the moon
Harlem River, all because of you

And Harlem River, swallow me
Put your hands around my neck
Harlem River, I can't breathe
They've got the lights down now

And Harlem River, give me wings
Put my head up in the clouds
And Harlem River, all because
Oh, I'm nowhere now

Harlem River, tell me, is it true?
That in my pearl and my diamonds
I've climbed the clouds, now I stole the moon
Harlem River, all because of you

I don't know, I don't know just where I'm going
'Cause I've never been
And I don't know just where I'm going
Or where I've been
Oh, Harlem River, like a diamond

And ride on that easy rider
Flow like that Harlem River
Ride on that easy rider
Flow like that Harlem River
I ride for you
I ride for you
