		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You might know of the original sin
And you might know how to play with fire
But did you know of the murder committed
In the name of love? Yeah, you thought, what a pity

Dream on white boy (white boy)
Dream on black girl (black girl)
And wake up to a brand new day
To find your dreams are washed away

There was a time when I did not care
And there was a time when the facts did stare
There is a dream and held by many
Well, I'm sure you had to see it's open arms

Dream on white boy (white boy)
Dream on black girl (black girl)
Then wake up to a brand new day
To find your dreams have washed away

You might know of the original sin
You might know how to play with fire
But did you know of the murder committed
In the name of love? Yeah, you thought, what a pity

Dream on white boy (white boy)
Dream on black girl (black girl)
And wake up to a brand new day

Dream on black boy (black boy)
Dream on white girl (white girl)
And wake up to a brand new day
To find your dreams have washed away

Dream on black boy (black boy)
Dream on white girl (white girl)
And wake up to a brand new day
To find your dreams have washed away

Dream on, play with fire
White boy, black girl
Dream on, in the name of love
Black boy, white girl
Dream on, white boy, black girl
Black boy, white girl

Dream on
In the name of love, yeah
You thought what a pity
Yeah
Original sin
