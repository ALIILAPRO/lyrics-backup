		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Black hearts, black days
Raindrops on my window pane
Streetlights, street life
Hot blood burning in my veins

History won't drag me down
I say no, no, no, I say no, no, no
It's buried six feet underground
Let it go, go, go, let it go

Hey, hey, what you say?
I've got no use for yesterday
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna love
Right now
And if tomorrow never comes
I'm gonna stay forever young
These lungs of mine
Were made to scream and shout
I said hey, hey, what you say?
It seems like trouble's on the way
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna love
Right now
It's singing oh, oh oh oh
I said hey, hey, what you say?
I've got no use for yesterday

I've got no
I, I, I've got no
I've got no
I've got no use for yesterday
I've got no
I, I, I've got no
I've got no
I've got no use for yesterday

Tonight I've got a new life
I gotta get right and get it moving
White lies left me snowblind
But now this time, I see right through it

History won't drag me down
I say no, no, no, I say no, no, no
It's buried six feet underground
Let it go, go, go, let it go

Hey, hey, what you say?
I've got no use for yesterday
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna love
Right now
And if tomorrow never comes
I'm gonna stay forever young
These lungs of mine
Were made to scream and shout
I said hey, hey, what you say?
It seems like trouble's on the way
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna love
Right now
It's singing oh, oh oh oh
I said hey, hey, what you say?
I've got no use for yesterday

I've got no
I, I, I've got no
I've got no
I've got no use for yesterday
I've got no
I, I, I've got no
I've got no
I've got no use for yesterday
