		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My sun, it's time to leave this world
It's time to leave the daylight stream
It's time to feel this rain
Through the fire hail

This is all I have to say
This is all that's left of me
In this shell I've lived through hell
Walking icy plains

I cannot take what this world gave me
I cannot live through this hell
I cannot take this life that I've been given
I've always sung the words and songs of death

I didn't let you
I'd never let you go so far from my heart

But the clock is ticking

I didn't let you go
I'd never let you go so far from my heart

You'll see
You'll see

I've walked through these halls
But I cannot see through it all
I've lost control
Forgiveness perfected, somewhat, something
But never far from home

Maybe you'll see
Maybe you'll see

I've lived my life in escape from the sun
Living life dead

I didn't let you go
I'd never let you go so far from my heart

But the clock is ticking

I didn't let you go
I'd never let you go so far from my heart

Pain in silence sets free chaos

The tears from this heart
The mind locked in shock
The rising of seas at last

The real life succumb
The new seed is done
This new dark is born once more

Put the bullet through my head and silence this hell
'cause the fire ain't alive, set me free
Put the bullet through my head and make me feel alive

Pray for brighter days
The black shores awaiting
On board this grave-bound train
A sip from the ocean

Take this life, God, I don't need it
Full of thoughts, the ugly needs
Give me oceans, waves in motion
Nothingness is always part of me

In head, rewinding thoughts of death
In head, reliving daily death
