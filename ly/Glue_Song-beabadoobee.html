		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've never known someone like you
Tangled in love, stuck by you from the glue
Don't forget to kiss me
Or else you'll have to miss me
I guess I'm stuck forever by the glue
Oh, and you

Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm

Findin' the right words to use for this song
I have you in mind, so it won't take so long
Never thought I'd find you
But you're here, and so I love you
I'm not wrong when I say I've been stuck

By the glue onto you
I've been stuck by glue
Right onto you
I've been stuck by glue

I've never known
I've never known someone like you
I've never known 
I've never known someone like you
