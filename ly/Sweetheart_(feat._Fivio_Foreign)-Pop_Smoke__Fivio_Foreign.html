		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sweetheart, sweetheart, ah
Sweetheart (what's a thotty), sweetheart (to a gangsta)
Sweetheart, ah, sweetheart
Sweetheart (I'm wildin'), sweetheart (got no answers)

Them niggas know they gettin' boomed (them niggas know they gettin' boomed)
You see my face, you better move (baow)
Bullets flyin' through the room (baow)
They want static, I'm in the mood
100K, what I pay for the jewels
I ain't got nothin' to prove (I don't)
You either win or you lose (ay)
Look, I see an opp, he'll be devastated, uh (devastated)
None of them niggas ain't never made it (damn)
Uh (uh), when I do a crime it's premeditated, ay (baow)
Ay, pay attention, watch close
It's Fivio Foreign and Pop Smoke (it is)
I see an opp and I drop folk (baow)
I see an opp and I drop folk (baow)
I'm heaven-sent (uh), devil in me (devil in me)
Them niggas know I need extra Henny (I do)
I shoot at niggas 'cause they messin' with me (baow)
Police'll never come catch up with me (skrrt)
Uh, sweetheart, I can not jog, I got three cars (ay)
I took a Perc and I think smart (ay)
I'm off of a Perc (I'm off of a Perc)
When I fuck, I make it hurt (she do)
Whatever works (whatever works)
Your bitch gettin' money, you better dig in her purse
I take whatever she worth (I take whatever she worth)
Ay, I take whatever she worth (sweetheart)

Sweetheart, sweetheart, ah
Sweetheart (what's a thotty), sweetheart (to a gangsta)
Sweetheart, ah, sweetheart
Sweetheart (I'm wildin'), sweetheart (got no answers)

I got an extendo it holds fifty clips, it look like a broom (sweetheart)
When you see me, better "Woo" (woo)
Or bullets start flyin' through the room (sweetheart)
I pop a Perc, hold on (yeah)
To get in the mood, and it's 25 for the walk
I leave her like three patties when I'm through
I spend like a hundred bands in jewels
Drippin' like I came out the pool (like I came out the pool, wait, wait)
I'm so exotic like I came out the zoo (ay, ay, ay, hold on)
Stupid bitch, do I look like a fool? (Do I look like a fool?)
I'm from New York where they "Woo" (woo)
In a two-door, shot out the coupe

Sweetheart, sweetheart, ah
Sweetheart (what's a thotty), sweetheart (to a gangsta)
Sweetheart, ah, sweetheart
Sweetheart (I'm wildin'), sweetheart (got no answers)
