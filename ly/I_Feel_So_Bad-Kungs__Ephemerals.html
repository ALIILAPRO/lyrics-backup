		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel so bad
That I might have led you wrong
But when I met you, I was so in love
I didn't think that I could be strong, but, but
Things just started slipping
Thought they'd go back to how they were
Should've been honest sooner
Before things got so much worse

You made us change 
Way back when we were fine 
Way back when I, I love ya 
You couldn't tame your mind I
I loved you for who you were 
Not for that girl that you thought you could be 
Now I can't believe
This here's happening to me 

Oh, tryin'a bring me closer 
But you're not pushing me away 
Baby, I won't love you any better 
If you continue to make us change 

Oh, tryin'a bring me closer 
But you're not pushing me away 
Baby, I won't love you any better 
If you continue to make us change
