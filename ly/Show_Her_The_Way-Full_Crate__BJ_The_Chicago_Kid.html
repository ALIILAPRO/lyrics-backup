		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Slow down the pace
And show her the way 
The way to love
There's nothing better

Slow down the pace
And show her the way 
The way to love
There's nothing better

Every single time you told me how you felt 
Why does it seem so hard just to accept the feeling?
I know I shouldn't be so foolish (oh, yeah)
But I'm just afraid, yeah (I'm just afraid)

Honestly, I love the honesty (ooh) 
'Cause in the past it hasn't always been the way
And I've been a fool once before 
But now I'm not afraid to (not afraid to)

Slow down the pace
And show her the way 
The way to love
There's nothing better

Slow down the pace
And show her the way 
The way to love
There's nothing better

And now it's 2022 and I see the visions
Moved to LA from Dam just to escape my feelings 
I've been avoiding love just to resist commitment
But in this trust we found, you told me I got freedom 

Honestly, I love the honesty (ooh) 
'Cause in the past it hasn't always been the way
And I've been a fool once before 
But now I'm not afraid to (not afraid to)

Slow down the pace
And show her the way 
The way to love
There's nothing better 

Slow down the pace
And show her the way 
The way to love
There's nothing better

You know
Like having a conversation with her where I can just be honest
Where I can open up about everything, anything
And know that I'm not gonna be judged 
And that honesty, you know, creates such a, such a freedom 
Where you don't have to overthink anymore 
You know, being this honest and having this freedom 
Just means the world to me 
And it's a, it's a beautiful space to be in 
Yeah, for sure
