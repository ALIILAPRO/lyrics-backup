		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You got me runnin', goin' out of my mind
You got me thinkin' that I'm wastin' my time

Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

You wanna stay out with your fancy friends
I'm tellin' you, it's got to be the end

Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

Don't bring me down, groos
Don't bring me down, groos
Don't bring me down, groos
Don't bring me down

What happened to the girl I used to know?
You let your mind out somewhere down the road

Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

You're always talkin' 'bout your crazy nights
One of these days, you're gonna get it right

Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

Don't bring me down, groos
Don't bring me down, groos
Don't bring me down, groos
Don't bring me down

You're lookin' good, just like a snake in the grass
One of these days, you're gonna break your glass

Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

You got me shakin', got me runnin' away
You got me crawlin' up to you everyday

Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down, down, down, down, down, down

I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down
