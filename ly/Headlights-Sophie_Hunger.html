		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You told your tales with pictures
I tried to make it seem good
I borrowed the heart of a preacher
And believed as hard as I could

You don't know how much I worked there
You don't know the risk I took
You hardly, hardly saw me
Behind the mirror round my neck

Caught in your Headlights
I had to close my eyes
Caught in your Headlights
I had so little time
Caught in your Headlights
I couldn't turn back i was never myself
I was you i forgot

You sold your smiles untroubled
Your light was on every face
You were too young to know that it mattered
That every time someone must pay

I bought your every word then
I didn't have my side
I was too old to learn my first lesson
So I dance with tied hands in mind

Caught in your Headlights
I had to close my eyes
Caught in your Headlights
I had so little time
Caught in your Headlights
I couldn't turn back i was never myself
I was you i forgot
