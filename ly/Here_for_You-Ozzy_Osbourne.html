		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember all the good times
Sometimes I'd wonder would it last
I used to dream about the future
But now the future is the past
I don't wanna live in yesterday
Cross my heart until I die
Don't wanna know just what tomorrow may bring
Because today has just begun
No matter whatever else I've done
I'm here for you
I'm here for you

So now I sit here and I wonder
Whatever happened to my friends
Too many bought a one way ticket
But I'll be with you till the end

I don't wanna live in yesterday
Cross my heart until I die
Don't wanna know just what tomorrow may bring
Because today has just begun
No matter whatever else I've done
I'm here for you

You're my religion, you're my reason to live
You are the heaven in my hell
We've been together for a long, long time
And I just can't live without you
No matter what you do
I'm here for you

I don't wanna live in yesterday
Cross my heart until I die
Don't wanna know just what tomorrow may bring
Because today has just begun
No matter whatever else I've done
I'm here for you
I'm here for you
I'm here for you
I'm here for you
