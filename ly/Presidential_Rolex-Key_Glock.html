		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You got to set me free)
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
Glizzop, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa
Yeah, fa
5L
(Yo)

Presidential rollie (rollie)
Yeah you know my name and you best believe I tote it (tote it)
Glizock be the name and this bitch just said I'm goldy (goldy)
I just bought it yesterday, but drive it like it's stolen, hey
That ain't enough money on your pocket if you can fold it
Big ass chain it hurt my shoulders
Thousand dollars in my soda
Reed richard, Coca Cola
When you really getting money you ain't gotta show it
Big ass rocks on me like boulders
Bout' my chips, not talking poker

Yeah, I turn nun' to some (some)
My diamonds fight, my neck and wrist havin' a one on one (one)
And my lil niggas masked up like they at Comic Con
I rep that nic', I keep a stick and I play with drums
If you ain't made an M, you better get you one
And when you run it up like this, that's when them bitches come (come)
And when you run it up like this, you better flip it too
Hey I sip codeine but I pop you like a jig a boo (fa)
I miss the Glock, my money talk and my pistol too (yo)
Say hello to a lil friend, I'll introduce you (yo)
Pull the trigger, let it sing yeah just like Luca (Vandross)
Blue diamonds in my pinky ring look like Aruba (bitch)

Presidential rollie (yo)
Yeah you know my name and you best believe I tote it (tote it)
Glizock be the name and this bitch just said I'm goldy, hey (goldy)
I just bought it yesterday, but drive it like it's stolen, hey
That ain't enough money on your pocket if you can fold it
Shot out Glizock, that's my brodie
Ain't no gang, bitch I'm loaded
Got these G's on me like Dolce (Gabana)
She say I'm that nigga, but I already know it (know it)
Gettin' cash money with my woedies
Got me dancing just like Doja, Cat
Yeah
