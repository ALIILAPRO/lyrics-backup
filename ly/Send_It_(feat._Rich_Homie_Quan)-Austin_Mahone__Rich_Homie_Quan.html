		<p>
		  Send it to my phone, send it to my phone
You already know I keep it on the low
Baby, you can trust me, promise I'm alone
I won't tell a soul, send it to my phone

Send it to my phone, send it to my phone
You already know I keep it on the low
Baby, you can trust me, promise I'm alone
I won't tell a soul, send it to my phone

You took it in the mirror, so I could see it clear
Baby have no fear, you know it's stayin' here
I know you wanna share, baby might as well
You know I keep it trill, you know I'd never tell
I'm sure you took a few, time you wanted to
I know when that hotline bling, that can only mean one thing
You know what I like, what I've been waitin' on
What's takin' so long? Send it to my phone

Send it to my phone, send it to my phone
You already know I keep it on the low
Baby, you can trust me, promise I'm alone
I won't tell a soul, send it to my phone

Okay now send it to my phone like a message that's unread
Send it to my phone, new nude picture, open leg
Hope they ready
Austin Mahone got 'em motivated
Send it to my phone like a notification
Send it to my phone, but my ringer cut off
I can't leave you alone, even though I'm single and I'm
Send it to my phone like a message from my BM
Notify me on my phone like a message in my BM
Send it

Send it to my phone, send it to my phone
You already know I keep it on the low
Baby, you can trust me, promise I'm alone
I won't tell a soul, send it to my phone

Send it to my phone, send it to my phone
You already know I keep it on the low
Baby, you can trust me, promise I'm alone
I won't tell a soul, send it to my phone

Baby what's the move? Don't need no attitude
You know it'll stay just between me and you
I wanna see already, it's the perfect view
Tell me if you're leavin', can I have it too?
Tell you that I love you, yeah, ain't none above you, yeah
I wanna see you, babe
I promise, baby girl, it'll be our little secret, yeah
I'm gonna keep it, yeah
Let no one see it, except for me

Send it to my phone, send it to my phone
You already know I keep it on the low
Baby, you can trust me, promise I'm alone
I won't tell a soul, send it to my phone

Send it to my phone, send it to my phone
You already know I keep it on the low
Baby, you can trust me, promise I'm alone
I won't tell a soul, send it to my phone
Send it to my phone
