		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pain, take all this pain
Take it away, take it away
Rope, walk on the rope
He takes your soul, he takes your soul

That's when you know
He's got a hold, hold on
That's when you know
He's got a hold, hold on you

Pain, take all this pain
Take it away, take it away
Rope, walk on the rope
He takes your soul, he takes your soul, oh yeah

That's when you know
He's got a hold, hold on
That's when you know
He's got a hold, hold on you, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah

That's when you know
He's got a hold, hold on
That's when you know
He's got a hold, hold on you

That's when you know
He's got a hold, hold on you
