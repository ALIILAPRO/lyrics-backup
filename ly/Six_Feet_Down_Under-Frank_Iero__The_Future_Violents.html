		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now you don't have to accept my fears, but you better respect my fear
And I know I don't have to explain myself to you
But I might feel better if I try
So (let tell you something)
There's a part of me that's not sure if I'm here
Yea, there's a definite part of me that don't believe in the now
And that's just the start of it cause I aint convinced you're all real
There might be an art to it but I don't think I got the skill

Bless your heart, but you don't know how I feel
I'll do my part, and try to explain
Yea, you might be smart, but you don't know how this feels
No matter the words in your heart you can keep em
Cause life is like doing time when you're dead inside

I don't wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna feel like before
I don't want to settle the score
I don't wanna die here 
I don't wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna feel like before
I don't want to settle the score
I don't wanna die
Sometimes I get so low that I swear I could cry
(Say a little prayer for me now)
(Say a little prayer for me now)
(Say a little prayer for me now)
(Say a little prayer for me now)
(Say a little prayer for me now)
(Say a little prayer for me now)

Bless your heart, but you don't know how I feel
I'll do my part, and try to explain over and over and over again
Yea, you might be smart, but you can't know how this feels
No matter the words in your heart you can keep em

Cause this life is making a fucking fool out of me
And no one can tell me if it's just my fucking mind playing dirty tricks on me

I don't wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna feel like before
I don't want to settle the score
I don't wanna die here
I don't wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna feel like before
I don't want to settle the score
I don't wanna die here
I don't wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna feel like I did
I just wanna know
I don't wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna feel like I did
I just wanna live

Sometimes I get so low that I swear, baby 
I just can't figure out which way is up
And these things that I'm seeing, thy combat what I'm feeling
And I just need to know if I've really survived
