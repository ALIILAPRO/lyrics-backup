		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There goes my girl, into the chapel
Now she's walking down the aisle
And it feels just like a mile
And I shake, shake, shake like a leaf
And I'm lying, lying, lying through my teeth
I got a pocketful of hand shakes
And It don't mean nothing

There goes my girl, into the chapel
Now she's walking down the aisle
And her man begins to smile
And I shake, shake, shake like a leaf
And I'm lying, lying, lying through my teeth
I'm a bowl of bruised fruit
Inside a chapel of shiny apples

Tear up the photograph
'Cause it's a bright blue sky

Tear up the photograph
'Cause it's a bright blue sky

Tear up the photograph
'Cause it's a bright blue sky

Tear up the photograph
'Cause it's a bright blue sky

'Cause it's a bright blue sky

'Cause it's a bright blue sky
