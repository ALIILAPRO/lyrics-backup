		  Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo doo doo doo doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo doo doo doo doo

Hey, Carrie Anne
Hey, Carrie Anne
When we were at school, our games were simple
I played a janitor, you played a monitor
Then you played with older boys and prefects
What's the attraction in what they're doing?

Hey, Carrie Anne, what's your game now?
Can anybody play?
Hey, Carrie Anne, what's your game now?
Can anybody play?

You were always something special to me
Quite independent, never caring
You lost your charm as you were aging
Where is your magic disappearing?

Hey, Carrie Anne, what's your game now?
Can anybody play?
Hey, Carrie Anne, what's your game now?
Can anybody play?

You're so, so like a woman to me
(So like a woman to me)
So, so like a woman to me
(Like a woman to me)

Hey, Carrie Anne, what's your game now?
Can anybody play?
Hey, Carrie Anne, what's your game now?
Can anybody play?

People live and learn but you're still learning
You use my mind and I'll be your teacher
When the lesson's over, you'll be with me
Then I'll hear the other people saying

Hey, Carrie Anne, what's your game now?
Can anybody play?
Hey, Carrie Anne, what's your game now?
Can anybody play?

Carrie Anne, Carrie Anne, Carrie Anne
