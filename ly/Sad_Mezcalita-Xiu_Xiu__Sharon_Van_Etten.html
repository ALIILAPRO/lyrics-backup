		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No no no no, no no no no no no no, no no no no
Oh no no no, no no no no no no no, no no no no

What were you doing there?
So un-anxious to be liked
Maybe because you were tired
And the world was in your way
I had walked them home
My only friend, my only love
There were none like them
None, none and none

Rough dreams
More than enough dreams
Rough dreams
Rough dreams
N'er to rest, n'er to be
In all, or all or at all
N'er to cease, n'er to breathe
Roughened dreams
Prelude to defeat

I have only ever been special to you
You were so much more than only special to me

No no no no, no no no no no no no, no no no no

It's not having something evil endure
As it is never having something good
The only years that meant a thing
Bewildered every and all days
The flip of two ugly, useless, purposeless cards
Guide me to walk o'er the dune
To dig up your Rumpus Room

Rough dreams
More than enough dreams
Rough dreams
Rough dreams
N'er to rest, n'er to be
In all, or all or at all
N'er to cease, n'er to breathe
Roughened dreams
Prelude to defeat

Without any questions
You were to end at a horrible end
Without, withouts
Nor a cloud in the sky
