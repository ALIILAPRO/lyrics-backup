		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every time,
The moon shines I become alive, yeah
And every time,
The moon shines I become alive, yeah

I'm feeling strange in the night
I'm in myself I feel I'm thrown into a fight
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide nothin's right
My skin is burning when my rock begins to speak
There's something going wrong with me
I am changing rapidly
I'm feeling stronger, more alert, I'm on the move
I smell her scent and I know I will find her soon (soon, soon)
The one to come and free me from this fate
I'll find her, it's not too late, hey, hey

Every time,
The moon shines I become alive, yeah
And every time,
The moon shines I become alive, yeah

I'm a beast in the night
I'm on the prowl and I'm hoping to find some light
You call it heaven, I can do it for the same
Ain't nothing wrong I been feasting on something brave
A sexy lady who's pure, she has the cure, uh
I hope she can find the man within the beast, and
I hope she saves me from the curse I have to beat, hey
I hope she figures out a way to save my soul
Yeah, to save my heart, hey

Every time,
The moon shines I become alive, yeah
And every time,
The moon shines I become alive, yeah

Na na na na na na na na, whoa
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na, whoa
Na na na na na na na

I watch the sun collapse
And took up in the clizoud
I am the lone wolf
Go where I wanna
Let the moon shine be the guide to the lizight
Even when I stray away the light never left me, uh
I learn to follow my instinct
Blinded by the light,
Rather that than the evil
Feelin' out of place in a room full of people
Try and be the same but you know you're not a sequel
You're fate will be whatever it shall be (be, be, be, be)
We'll fight no more,
I let these things just be (be, be, be)

Every time,
The moon shines I become alive, yeah
And every time,
The moon shines I become alive, yeah

Na na na na na na na na, whoooa
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na, whoooa
Na na na na an a nana
