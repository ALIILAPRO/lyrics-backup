		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the dark, miles apart
Made a promise that I'm coming out alive
Raging heart went too far
I will never lose myself again
Oh, I

I was calling you
Did you hear me?
I lost my way
I lost my way

I was trapped in a thousand nights
With no escape
Nightmares taking me over
Now I'm wide awake
Now I'm wide awake
Oh, I died like a million times
Through the waves I break
The nightmares finally over
Now I'm wide awake
Now I'm wide awake

Blinding lights
Burning eyes
I can see myself and I don't need to hide
My foolish pride
Paid the price
I will never leave again I'm by your side

I was calling you
Did you hear me?
I lost my way
I lost my way

I was trapped in a thousand nights
With no escape
Nightmares taking me over
Now I'm wide awake
Now I'm wide awake
Oh, I died like a million times
Through the waves I break
The nightmares finally over
Now I'm wide awake
Now I'm wide awake

And now I'm wide awake
And now I'm wide awake

Oh, I died like a million times
Through the waves I break
The nightmare's finally over
Now I'm wide awake
Now I'm wide awake
