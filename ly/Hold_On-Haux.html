		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shiver in your parents' bed
Whisper words left unsaid

With all that you gave
And all that he stole
You'll never be safe
So you thought you'd let go
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on

Violence in a quiet mind
Reckless till the end of time

With all that you gave
And all that he stole
You'll never be safe
You'll never be whole
With all that you gave
And all that he stole
You'll never be safe
You'll never be whole
