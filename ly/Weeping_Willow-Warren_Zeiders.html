		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To her mama and her daddy, she's the best thing ever made
To the boys 'round here, she's the one that got away
To the bird on the barbwire, that girl looks like spring
To a guy like me, she looks like everything

That girl can take a gray sky and paint it blue
She can put the smooth in the 90 proof
She can hang the moon in a sundress
Even put a sinner on a front pew
She can make a shining diamond out of West Virginia coal
She can put a smile on a weeping willow

There's something in the way that that girl moves
It's like a spotlight follows her through a crowded room
She showed up like rain on a desert rose
And where I'd be without her, God only knows

That girl can take a gray sky and paint it blue
She can put the smooth in the 90 proof
She can hang the moon in a sundress
Even put a sinner on a front pew
She can make a shining diamond out of West Virginia coal
She can put a smile on a weeping willow

That girl can take a gray sky and paint it blue
She can put the smooth in the 90 proof
She can hang the moon in a sundress
Even put a sinner on a front pew
She can make a shining diamond out of West Virginia coal
She can put a smile on a weeping willow
She can put a smile on a weeping willow, weeping willow
