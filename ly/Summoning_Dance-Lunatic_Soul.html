		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  most of the road i travelled alone 
is now far behind
i have an opportunity to believe
and to revive

so why do i feel 
like i already failed
three stones on the right side
three stones on the left

i had to keep starting over from scratch
put that to rest
i didn't like myself
and what i'd become
and i was tired

three stones on the right side
three stones on the left
my vicious circle of life and death

oh you want it""
i hear it again
oh you want it
my burden
curse to break

i don't know if i'm capable anymore
of learning
what it's like to feel
on the other side of my dream
i will try to wake up
and to believe

just break my curse


most of my afterlife
i have spent 
trying to solve
the diagram
i forgot i'd made up
when it all had begun

so why do i feel 
like i already failed
three stones on the right side
three stones on the left

oh you want it""
i hear it again
oh you want it
my burden
curse to break

i don't know if i'm capable anymore
of learning
what it's like to feel
on the other side of my dream
i will try to wake up
and to believe
i don't know if i will be able to love
if i cannot find you there

summon me now
just break my curse
the dance begins

you had to stop in the middle of life
and live in a cavern of lies
whenever you were pulling away from yourself
they made you believe it's okay
forced you to stand still 
stop moving
to vegetate
but you always wanted to dance
you always wanted to dance
you always wanted to dance
