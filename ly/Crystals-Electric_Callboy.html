		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put your motherfucking hands in the sky!

Her eyes so crystal clear
Her taste like diamonds in my mouth
This freezing touch of fear
Won't let me go until my heart stops

I can't remember last night
Who's the person next to me?
The drugs, the drinks, my love
Baby, you make me feel free
I close my eyes, inhale the air
Floating away, but I don't care
I just wanna be with you darling
I wanna feel free

I just, just wanna be with you
I will do what you want me to
I just, just wanna be with you
I will do what you want me to

I hear your voice
That runs out of tune
I'm floating in the haze Of your perfume
I hear your voice
That runs out of tune
Your crystals shine
Bright like the silver moon

Even life's always shit
I know that I am not alone
Everytime I kiss your lips
You make me feel at home

I try to kill my own despair
Flirt with the death, but I don't care
I just wanna be with you darling
I wanna feel free

I just, just wanna be with you
I will do what you want me to
I just, just wanna be with you
I will do what you want me to

I hear your voice
That runs out of tune
I'm floating in the haze Of your perfume
I hear your voice
That runs out of tune
Your crystals shine
Bright like the silver moon

Put your fucking hands
In the sky
I gave my life away
I gave my life away

I hear your voice
That runs out of tune

I hear your voice
That runs out of tune
I'm floating in the haze Of your perfume
I hear your voice
That runs out of tune
Your crystals shine
Bright like the silver moon

I hear your voice
That runs out of tune
I'm floating in the haze Of your perfume
I hear your voice
That runs out of tune
Your crystals shine
Bright like the silver moon
