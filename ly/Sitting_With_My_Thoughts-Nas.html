		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To OG's and young bosses
We bounce back when we take losses
Ayy Hit, how we gon' know some shit like this, nigga

I once, too, was a young boy, wylin' on tour
Runnin' with some of the wildest youngin's out of New York
Met some more in Baton Rouge, used to wild how they talked
Nineteen, my girl was pregnant, had to sit with my thoughts
Sit with my thoughts
I had to sit with my thoughts
My family was my motivation, focus on the elevation
I'm attractin', not chasin'

We ain't scared of niggas, we rarer than niggas
Rope chain hang, diamonds in the pendant
I am independent
She wrote a comment, they pinned it
It got my attention, we could go viral in minutes
Aspire to win it
I'm spiraling in it
Flip sides of the coin, that's life in the business
Flip publishing it goes to the highest of bidders
I got 'em bitter
Blows up a winner
That shit comes with being great, it's a lot on my plate
Never broke again, I'm blacker than the NBA
Espn couldn't cover all of my highlights
Look at this money machine, I love what it sound like
And Nipsey would've loved that I'm working with Hit
He might've took me to 6-0 and turned me a Crip
It's our money in
Xo in my cup, I'm sittin' with my thoughts again, yeah

To OG's and young bosses
We bounce back when we take losses
I pray we all get prayed for
I pray we all can make more

Whole time writin' this, I'm typing some people back
Who need me to get 'em in places
Typa shit is that?
I'm a concierge for most people I know
I'm in the studio with Hit, Cash Appin' my folks
I love it
That shit comes with being great, there's a lot on my plate
I would give it all away for a smile on they face
Shout out to rappers who inspired me in my beginnings
Who I inspired right back when they pen was dwindlin'
Sittin' with my thoughts
Thinkin' what it cost
For peace of mind, I'd go crazy if I couldn't rhyme
I finally took time to drop constant releases
I finally put me first, the intro on the sequence
Don't need a new assistant
I'm just too persistent
Officially efficient, I see it through to the finish
So complete, I'm not a control freak
Personal chef flow, I make sure that we all eat

To OG's and young bosses
We bounce back when we take losses
I pray we all get prayed for
I pray we all can make more

To OG's and young bosses
We bounce back when we take losses
I pray we all get prayed for
I pray we all can make more
