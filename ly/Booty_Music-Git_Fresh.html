		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the beat goin like that boom boom,
Girl, I want to put you all up in my room.
I wanna put you up against that wall.
Throw you on the bed and take your clothes off.
Everybody don't like it slow, consider me one of them folk.
Lets get to it,
Get to it,
Get to it,
Get to it.
Kinda crunk and I'm off this scene, 
Have a blast and that's my shit,
Once I had a shot of that quick Patron,
I'm in my boxers like bobby jones.
Everybody don't like it slow consider me one of them folk,
And lets do it,
Lets do it,
Lets do it,
Lets do it.

Baby that's the way I like it,
That's the way you like it,
That's the way we like it,
Making love to booty music.
Go Leo its your birtday,
Go Virgo its your birthday,
Go Pisces its your birthday, 
Making love to booty music.

I feel all in my bones,
Tryna to keep up with that tempo,
Do it all night till your back gets sore,
Till we just can't take it no more.
Girl your ass like "OH MY GOD!" 
We clap back till you give me applause 
And I'm like...*clap*
When I get in them drawers
Got you hair in tangles 
I wrapped around my ankles,
I'm gripping on your handles,
I'm hitting on different angles like,
10, 5 cent, 10 cent dolla,
10, 5 cent, 10 cent, dolla,
10, 5 cent, 10 cent, dolla.
Now let me see you pop it, pop it

that's the way I like it,
That's the way you like it,
That's the way we like it,
Making love to booty music.
Go Aries its your birthday,
Go Libra its your birtday,
Go Scorpio its your birthday 
Making love to booty music.

Now don't stop get it,
Get it ( get it )
Pop that goochy let me hit it.
I wanna rock,
I wanna rock let me get a lil bit of that bumpy ride.
Now don't stop get it,
Get it,
Let me put some stank up in it,
I wanna rock,
I wanna rock
Lemme get a lil bit of that bumpy ride..
Does anyone out there wanna let me get a lil bit of that bumpy ride? 
Oooohh Oooohh.

Baby that's the way I like it,
That's the way you like it,
That's the we we like it,
Making love to booty music.
Go Taurus its your birthday,
Go Capricorn its your birthday,
Go Aquarius its your birthday,
Making love to booty music.

that's the way you like it,
That's the we we like it,
Making love to booty music.
Go Taurus its your birthday.
Go Gemini its your birthday,
Go Sag its your birthday,
Making love to booty music.
