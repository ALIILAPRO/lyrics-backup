		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wakin' up to the sound of my phone
Lookin' at what's new on Instagram
The happiest place on Earth
Everybody seems so happy
Why do they seem so damn happy here?
When I don't, all alone

Chasin' shadows, losing who I am
Who am I supposed to be?

Don't let the lights go out
Just let it shine bright, oh
So fuck this modern life
Don't let the lights go out
Just let it shine

I can't tell what's real anymore
Fake face, fake friends, fake fantasies
All on my little screen
I don't even know what I like
I just know it's got this many likes
I'm losing sight

Now I'm chasing shadows, losing who I am
Who am I supposed to be?

Don't let the lights go out
Just let it shine bright, oh
So fuck this modern life
Don't let the lights go out
Just let it shine

Fuck this modern life
Fuck this modern life
Don't let the lights go out
Just let it shine
