		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know your scared
To ask for what you want
A love you read about
I know this feels different
Than anything before
Thatâ€™s how you can be sure
Ohhhh
The sun lights up your eyes
It was always you
Ohhhh
Never had the words but
Think I gotta tell you
All I see
Is you next to me
Laughing like they do in the movies
Watching stars
Feels like the world is ours
Like you always knew me
Ohhhh
The sun lights up your eyes
It was always you
Ohhhh
Never had the words but
Think I gotta tell you
