		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna dream anymore
I've buried it all too deep
Every waking moment is war
This is the seventh circle

I'm stepping off the edge
I think I'd prefer oblivion
I feel the blood drip from my face
Maybe it's better to never have been
Too afraid to connect, what can I do to repent?
I've got to settle my regrets, but first I've got to accept
Some of us burn too bright, I'm holding on too tight
I think I'm done with reality

I don't wanna dream anymore
I've buried it all too deep
Every waking moment is war
This is the seventh circle
I don't wanna dream anymore
I've buried it all too deep
Every waking moment is war
This is the seventh circle
I don't wanna dream anymore
I've buried it all too deep
Every waking moment is war
This is the seventh circle
