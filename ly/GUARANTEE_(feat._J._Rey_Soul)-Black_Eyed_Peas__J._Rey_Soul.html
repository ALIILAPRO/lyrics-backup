		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me what you want, I got what you need
I give you satisfaction guarantee
Let me be your lover, your pretty little freak
I give you satisfaction guarantee

Girl you got it bad, I'm loving your physique
You're sexy from your tippy-top down to your feet
Girl you like a snack, yeah, you're my favorite treat
I'm loving your mystique, girl, you the one to keep

Oh, hot damn, you got me weak in the knees
Baby, got me hotter than four hundred degrees
You my remedy
I love it when you sing your melody to me

So sing it to me one more time
Sing it to me one more time
Sing it to me one more time
Oh

Tell me what you want, I got what you need
I give you satisfaction guarantee
Let me be your lover, your pretty little freak
I give you satisfaction guarantee
(Ah ha, ah ha) I'm what you need
Boy, I give you satisfaction guarantee
(Ah ha, ah ha) I'm what you need
Boy, I give you satisfaction guarantee

Baby be my, be my, be my, bae, just be my freak
Babe I love you all day, all day, all night and all week
Let me love you down and down and down, my love go deep
Girl, I love you 'round and 'round and 'round that's my technique
Baby, give me sugar, sugar, sugar give me sweets
Spend that money, money on your shopping spree boutique
Let me love you, love you, love you, love you on repeat
Other girls they can't compete
You my melody

So sing it to me one more time
Sing it to me one more time
Sing it to me one more time
Oh

Tell me what you want, I got what you need
I give you satisfaction guarantee
Let me be your lover, you pretty little freak
I give you satisfaction guarantee
(Ah ha, ah ha) I'm what you need
Boy, I give you satisfaction guarantee
(Ah ha, ah ha) I'm what you need
Boy, I give you satisfaction guarantee

Tell me what you want (higher love than elevation, baby)
Tell me what you want (give me all your stimulation, baby)
Tell me what you want (all your love and dedication, baby)
I give you satisfaction guarantee
Tell me what you want (higher love than elevation, baby)
Tell me what you want (give me all your stimulation, baby)
Tell me what you want (all your love and dedication, baby)
I give you satisfaction guarantee
