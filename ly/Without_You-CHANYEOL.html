		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But, I guess that's just the way
The story goes

Umm, you always smile but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows, umm

No, I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there
But then I let you go

And now it's only fair 
That I should let you know
What you should know, umm

I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't give
I can't give anymore

I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live 
I can't give anymore
I can't live
