		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuckin' posers
Yo, yo, yeah
Yo, yo, yeah
Yo, yo, yeah
Yo, yo, yeah

Yeah (uh, uh huh)
Fuckin' posers
It's almost over now, almost over now
For all you, fuckin' posers (yeah)
Yeah
It's almost over now, almost over now

You think the way you live is okay
You think posing will save your day
You think we don't see that you're running
Better call your boys 'cause I'm coming

You can't be me, I'm a rock star
I'm rhyming on the top of a cop car
I'm a rebel and my .44 pops far
It's almost over now, almost over now
Guess, you ain't heard that we swallow guys
It's too damn late, to apologize
When you see the mantle or when you see the skies
It's almost over now, almost over now

You think that you don't have to ever quit
You think that you can get away with it
You think the light won't be ever lit
It's almost over now, almost over now
Somethings on your chest better get it off
There'll be no one left when we set it off
We ain't gonna take it no more
Since it's almost over now, almost over now

You have to plenty of time, there was no rush
But it was your dream to be like us
You're in dreamland so you don't care
And as you wake, we're standing there (I'm standing there, I'm standing there motherfucker)

You can't be me, I'm a rock star
I'm rhyming on the top of a cop car
I'm a rebel and my .44 pops far
It's almost over now it's almost over now
Guess, you ain't heard that we swallow guys
It's too damn late, to apologize
When you see the mantle or when you see the skies
It's almost over now it's almost over now

You think that you don't have to ever quit
You think that you can get away with it
You think the light won't be ever lit
It's almost over now, almost over now
Somethings on your chest better get it off
There'll be no one left when we set it off
We ain't gonna take it no more
Since it's almost over now, almost over now

On your chest better get it off (get it off)
Set it off (pop, pop, pop)

It's almost over now, almost over now (look, It's almost over now, almost over now)
You don't succeed 'cause you hesitate
You think we're fly, but we levitate
Just be yourself, don't ask us why
'Cause if you don't, we'll make you cry (pop, pop, pop)

You can't be me, I'm a rock star
I'm rhyming on the top of a cop car
I'm a rebel and my .44 pops far
It's almost over now it's almost over now
I guess, you ain't heard that we swallow guys
It's too damn late, to apologize
When you see the mantle or when you see the skies
It's almost over now it's almost over now

You think that you don't have to ever quit
You think that you can get away with it
You think the light won't be ever lit
It's almost over now, almost over now
Somethings on your chest better get it off
There'll be no one left when we set it off
We ain't gonna take it no more
Since it's almost over now, almost over now

You can't be me, I'm a rock star
I'm rhyming on the top of a cop car
I'm a rebel and my .44 pops far
It's almost over now it's almost over now
I guess, you ain't heard that we swallow guys
It's too damn late, to apologize
When you see the mantle or when you see the skies
It's almost over now it's almost over now

No one ever really dies, do you believe that?
Well if not, for you
It's almost over now it's almost over now
