Dem come, body tan tan 
It's your boy Eazi
It's E Kelly

My baby dey confuse me o with her bum bum
Wey she get a guy wey dey send her money from London
She dey see me like a "Johnny Just Come"
My monkey dey work eh
Baboon e just dey chop

Me a go chop all the wash eh
As long as you give me my portion
Baby make you no dey rush eh
A beg make you treat me with caution
Ah, ah, ah

Leg over
My baby gimme leg over ahn
Hang over
Baby she dey gimme hang over eh eh
Leg over
My mama give me leg over eh eh
Game over
She dey come gimme game over

Eh eh
I dey confuse
I dey confuse
When you turn around
Baby you dey make I confuse
You Douala like a, a Cameroon
You mesmerize the boy and baby make I confuse
Commando, you be commando
You dey command the boy with overload
Yeh yeh I no fit stand alone
I must call my guy before rendezvous

Me a go chop all the wash eh
As long as you give me my portion
Baby make you no dey rush eh
A beg make you treat me with caution
Ah, ah, ah

Leg over
My baby gimme leg over ah
Hang over
Baby she dey gimme hang over eh eh
Leg over
My mama give me leg over eh eh
Game over
She dey come gimme game over, ah

It's your boy, Eazi
My baby dey distract me, oh, with her bum bum
Wey she get a guy wey dey send her money from London
She dey see me like a "Johnny Just Come" (zaggadat)
My monkey dey work eh
Baboon he just dey chop

Me a go chop all the wash eh
As long as you give me my portion
Baby make you no dey rush eh
A beg make you treat me with caution
Ah, ah, ah

Leg over
My baby gimme leg over ah
Hang over
Baby she dey gimme hang over eh eh
Leg over
My mama give me leg over eh eh
Game over
She dey come gimme game over, ah

Eh eh
I dey confuse
I dey confuse
When you turn around
Baby you dey make I confuse
You Douala like a, a Cameroon
You mesmerize the boy and baby make I confuse
Commando, you be commando
You dey command the boy with overload
Yeh yeh I no fit stand alone
I must call my guy before rendezvous
