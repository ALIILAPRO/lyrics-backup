		  Hey

Hey
(Off my, off my, off my, off my, off my, off my, off my)
(Off my, off my, off my, off my, off my, off my, off my)

Off my face don't know where I am
'Cause I got my drugs from Amsterdam (hey)

(Know where I am)
(Don't know where I am)
(Don't know where I am)
(Don't know where I am)
(Don't know where I am)
(Don't know where I am)
(Don't know where I am) Hey
(Don't know where I am)
(Don't know where I am)
(Don't know where I am)
I just really like how that feels

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

Off my face don't know where I am
'Cause I got my drugs from Amsterdam

Hey
'Cause I got my drugs from Amsterdam
(From Amsterdam, from Amsterdam, from Amsterdam)
(From Amsterdam, from Amsterdam, from Amsterdam)
(From Amsterdam, from Amsterdam, from Amsterdam)
(From Amsterdam, from Amsterdam, from Amsterdam)
(From Amsterdam, from Amsterdam, from)
'Cause I got my drugs from Amsterdam (hey)

I just really like how that feels
Hey, hey, hey, hey (don't know, off my face, don't know, off my face)
Off my face don't where I am
'Cause I got my drugs from Amsterdam
Hey
Hey
'Cause I got my drugs from Amsterdam (hey)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
