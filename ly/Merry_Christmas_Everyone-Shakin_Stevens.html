		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Snow is fallin'
All around me
Children playin'
Having fun
It's the season
Love and understanding
Merry Christmas everyone

Time for parties
And celebrations
People dancin'
All night long
Time for presents
And exchanging kisses
Time for singing Christmas songs

We're gonna have a party tonight
I'm gonna find that girl
Underneath the mistletoe
We'll kiss by candle light

Room is swaying
Records playing
All the old songs
We love hear
All I wish that
Everyday was Christmas
What a nice way
To spend the year
Woo, yeah

Shoo-be-do-be, do-be-do-whoop
Shoo-be-do-be, do-be-do-whoop
Shoo-be-do-be, do-be-do-whoop
Shoo-be-do-be, do-be-do-whoop

We're gonna have a party tonight
I'm gonna find that girl
Underneath the mistletoe
We'll kiss by candle light

Snow is fallin' (snow is fallin')
All around me (all around me)
Children playin' (children playin')
Having fun (having fun)
It's the season
Love and understanding
Merry Christmas everyone

Merry Christmas everyone
Ooh, merry Christmas everyone

(Ooh)
Snow is fallin' (snow is fallin')
All around me (all around me)
Children playin' (children playin')
Having fun (having fun)
It's the season
Love and understanding
Merry Christmas everyone

Snow is fallin' (snow is fallin')
All around me (all around me)
Children playin' (children playin')
Having fun (having fun)
It's the season
Love and understanding
Merry Christmas everyone

Oh, snow is fallin' (snow is fallin')
All around me (all around me)
Children playin' (children playin')
Having fun (having fun)
It's the season
Love and understanding
Merry Christmas everyone

Merry Christmas everyone
Ooh, merry Christmas everyone

(Ooh)
