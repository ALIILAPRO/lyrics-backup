		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Egan)

We can make all your wildest dreams come true,
There's nothing that we couldn't do for you.
There's no use sitting on the fence
When you know it all makes sense.

There's enough room for you, and there's enough room for me,
And that's the way it's gonna be.
There's no use sitting on the fence
When you know it all makes sense.

Well, we know just how to get things done,
We'll make a better living for everyone.
If you let it all slip away
You're gonna be sorry someday.

There's enough room for you, and there's enough room for me,
And that's the way it's gonna be.
There's no use sitting on a fence
When you know it all makes sense.
