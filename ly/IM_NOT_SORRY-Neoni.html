		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Think you're so much cooler than me
With your fancy cars
And your luxuries
Tinted windows on your limousine
Ride the high horse vibes
Looking down on me
Who died and made you king
Nobody
Keeping sycophants for
Company
Knock on your door
Who's it gonna be
Crashed your party
I'm not sorry
I'm not
I'm not sorry
I'm not
I'm not sorry
I'm not
I'm not sorry
Crashed your party
I'm not sorry
Big surprise you're not welcoming
Cause your cliques got cliques
And they don't pick me
No worries I don't want to be
A part of your A team
I came to make a scene cause
Who died and made you king
Nobody
Keeping sycophants for
Company
Knock on your door
Who's it gonna be
Crashed your party
I'm not sorry
I'm not
I'm not sorry
I'm not
I'm not sorry
I'm not
I'm not sorry
Crashed your party
I'm not sorry
I didn't come here so we could be friends
Your BFF
I couldn't care less about
Your opinion of me
Because truly
It's none of my business what you think
I just wanted to ruin your night
And kill the vibe
Mission accomplished tight
Killjoys am I right
Crashed your party
I'm not sorry
I'm not
I'm not sorry
I'm not
I'm not sorry
I'm not
I'm not sorry
