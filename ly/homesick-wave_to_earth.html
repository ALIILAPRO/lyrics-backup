		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In this cold place
Where the snow hasn't melted yet
Leaves that resemble the cold are growing
My freezing breath frozen memories
Oh, where my house has gone
I lost my bearings, oh

Ah, ah
I'm lost in my dreams, oh, ah
I'm lost in my dreams

Erase me from here and set me free
All I wanted was to fly high
I can't believe
My wings are broken
And fell against the sky

Oh, will you please take me home?
A flightless feather
Oh, my freezing breath frozen memories
Fearless behavior
It doesn't exist in me anymore

Erase me from here and set me free
All I wanted was to fly high
I can't believe
My wings are broken
And fell against the sky
Oh, will you please take me home? oh, oh
