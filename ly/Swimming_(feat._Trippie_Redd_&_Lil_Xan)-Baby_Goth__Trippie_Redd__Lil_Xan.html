		  (Turn me up fool)

See me in the big Ferrari
I got on a hoodie cause my link so icy
If you says I'm baby, then I'm gon' take the breeze
Baby crusin' courtside rolling up a fatty
R-r-rolling rolling rolling rolling
I ain't slept in weeks (weeks)
Rolling rolling rolling up and passing out OG
Swimming in Louis, Gucci, Fendi, Prada
Living our life the way we fucking wanna

Swerving in this brand new Wraith (skrt skrt)
Talking all that shit but nigga you ain't got no case
Who's a dumbass nigga sending shots ain't got no aim (Ain't got no aim)
Who's a dumbass nigga if you think that bitch your babe (You think she)
She wih me right now, iced out
Me and baby rolling 'til it's lights out (Lights out, yeah)
Need some cleaning, lysol
I said I'm rolling with the gang, got pipes out

R-r-rolling rolling rolling rolling
I ain't slept in weeks (weeks)
Rolling rolling rolling up and passing out OG
Swimming in Louis, Gucci, Fendi, Prada
Living our life the way we fucking wanna
R-r-rolling rolling rolling rolling
I ain't slept in weeks (weeks)
Rolling rolling rolling up and passing out OG
Swimming in Louis, Gucci, Fendi, Prada
Living our life the way we fucking wanna

I don't pop no molly but I definitely fucked a Molly
They gonna tell me sorry when I get my first Grammy
Rest in peace to granny all that matters is my family
Rest in peace to granny all that matters is my family

Ice is heavy on my wrist now (My wrist is heavier)
We rolling in a smoke cloud (We always smoking yeah)
Get too high I'm never coming down (Never coming down)
With the family fucking up the town (Town town)

Now I'm swimming in the ocean
With my Jet-ski robbin' something
Got a girl I really I like the type that you can really see
I hope this girl is feeling me yeah
I said I hope this girl is feeling me, yeah (Feeling me)

Baby bust me down like a brand new watch (Bust me down)
If you're feeling low let me turn you up a notch (Up a notch)
On the street you're brighter than a new growney
How you 'bove a vaty swaying with the blonde tease
R-r-rolling rolling rolling rolling
I ain't slept in weeks (weeks)
Rolling rolling rolling up and passing out OG
Swimming in Louis, Gucci, Fendi, Prada
Living our life the way we fucking wanna
R-r-rolling rolling rolling rolling
I ain't slept in weeks (weeks)
Rolling rolling rolling up and passing out OG
Swimming in Louis, Gucci, Fendi, Prada
Living our life the way we fucking wanna
