		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh sweet Jane
Living in the rapture
All the feelings after
All are gonna fade away

Smokey days
Hanging outside in the pouring rain
Feeling like the home where you once stayed
Has washed away

Oh your heart's been acting like
It don't wanna be working right
Now you tried everything
Just to feel something

Oh my thoughts are still with you
But you said that I'll explain to you
When you got nothing left
You got nothing left
To lose

Your father said
That someday he will be remade
Into a spirit that lives inside your mind

So you denied
The reasons we all live and die
Said that the river runs straight into ocean

Oh your heart's been acting like
It don't wanna be working right
Now you tried everything
Just to feel something

Oh my thoughts are still with you
But you said that I'll explain to you
When you got nothing left
You got nothing left
To lose
