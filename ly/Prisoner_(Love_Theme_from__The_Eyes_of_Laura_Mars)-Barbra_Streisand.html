		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've never been wrong

But you're the only one I trust to

Show me the way, I always hear your voice

And in my dreams I hear you calling my name

What is it about you?

Some kind of light shines from your face

And I can't turn away

I'm like a prisoner captured by your eyes

I've been taken and I've been hypnotized

I'm like a prisoner captured by your eyes

I've been taken, I've been hypnotized

And your eyes say everything

You wanna keep me here forever

I can't escape, one minute's so sincere

Then you completely turn against me and I'm afraid

You don't have to say, you love me

'Cause if you want me, I'll stay

'Cause I can't turn away

I'm like a prisoner captured by your eyes

I've been taken, taken by surprise

I'm like a prisoner captured by your eyes

I've been taken and I've been hypnotized

I'm like a prisoner captured by your eyes

I've been taken, I've been taken and I've been hypnotized

I'm like a prisoner captured by your eyes

I've been taken, I've been taken by surprise
