		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My ex-girl bitter
Went on Twitter saying that she was abused, it's time to tell you the truth
And the truth is that she was at my crib on the same day that she went on her rampage
Telling me that she just wanted us to be a family
I told her that we toxic, it's 'bout time that we stop it
Both of us unhappy and neither one of us trust the other
And if you pregnant, I'll be a father, you be a mother
But I ain't finna sacrifice my sanity for the sake of our family
Stressing tryna make it ideal, already tried that
If you gon' give me fifty percent, this where it dies at
She screaming at me, I was at the corner of my bed
Hoping that she wouldn't hit me 'cause she was making some threats
I got post-traumatic stress from women attacking me
'Cause I tend to hurt they feelings, I was happy when she left
But she won't admit to you that she physically battered me
And that shit gotta change
Women beating men and men taking the blame
Fake-ass victims, this shit is really a shame
I got text proof of her saying she the aggressor, she really playing the game
Asked me for sex, next day, she on Twitter saying all types of wild shit
Told you it was toxic
Playing on the trauma of people to spread the gossip
Knowing it's a trigger for many, my nigga, stop it
By the way, I got a e-mail from her accomplice
Begging me for money, I got it screenshotted
Saying that she need me and she ruined her life
Because she chose me and I told her that she wasn't my type
And then another girl hit me and she kept it a bean
Telling me this girl was lying 'bout a couple of things
And she exaggerating stories, so I'm making it clear
I absolutely want nothing to do with them over there
And she was messaging my exes, tryna recruit
My exes sent me screenshots like what these hoes tryna do?
And then I learned she was recording conversations for months
Telling stories, tryna get me fucked up
We was in a whole relationship, dates and vacationing
Had her 'round my mom, my grandma, and my son
And it's sad, it had me fucked up for a minute
Shit is different when you fucking demonic women
With fucked up intentions
Thinking that it's love, she on a whole different mission
This shit is really sickening
