		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel so sorry for myself
The spiral goes down and down and down
If I dont get my hands on that branch
Im afraid that i might drown

Through the roof
Straight Into the blue
As long as you're on board
I am trouble proof

The body tries to resist
But the current of the mind is so strong
And than I wake up to my mothers voice:
"Boy, we have all been young"

Through the roof
Straight Into the blue
As long as you're on board
I am trouble proof
