		  (Pooh, you a fool for this one)
(Hitmaka)
(Go, Grizz)
Montana (yeah)

You need a project bitch, a hood rat bitch (haan)
One don't give a fuck and say she took that dick
You need a project bitch, a hood rat bitch
Twerkin' up in traffic on some hood rat shit (alright)
I got your man throwin' bands
Pop that pussy for me, do a handstand (yeah, alright)
I got your man throwin' bands (throwin' bands)
Pop that pussy for me, do a handstand (haan) (alright)

I need a project bitch, a hood rat bitch
One don't give a fuck and say she took that dick (alright)
I need a project bitch, a hood rat bitch
Twerkin' up in traffic on some hood rat shit (Montana)

Catch me in that wagon, red, 150
Red bottoms got the floor sticky
You know my trigger, three quarters just to hide the blicky
Run, Ricky (woo)
Now he dippin' through the avenue
French, comment allez-vous?
Ratchet and a baddie
She wants karats, feast (alright)
Wagons, fleeks (alright)
Bad bitch, freak
Ratchet, beast
Get your ends up, tell 'em get your bands up (swish)
I be KD shootin', get your hands up (alright)
Let me kick it, like Jamaicans, I don't lick it
I just pull up with the ticket, David Copperfield, I trick it, haan
She wanna make the whole thing disappear, proper
And hold it in her hand like a Oscar

You need a project bitch, a hood rat bitch (haan)
One don't give a fuck and say she took that dick
You need a project bitch, a hood rat bitch
Twerkin' up in traffic on some hood rat shit (alright)
I got your man throwin' bands
Pop that pussy for me, do a handstand (yeah, alright)
I got your man throwin' bands (throwin' bands)
Pop that pussy for me, do a handstand (haan) (alright)

He need a sex symbol, he need some sexual
I need a nigga who be fuckin' up my edge control
He need the stripper type of body, need it flexible
He like it thick, like she ignorin' all her vegetables
I just put this pussy all over his face tattoos
Got him pullin' on my wig like, "What this lace can't do?"
And if he got a lot of options, he should weight them too
I give him real fat ass with some fake bamboo

I wanna hundred niggas on they knees eatin' my pussy (alright)
I wanna see them on my timeline tweetin' they love me (alright)
Tell baby lift my legs up like I'm wearin' a Huggie
Kitty always knock 'em out, ooh, that poor little puppy
Triple 7s on my credit score, a bitch must be lucky (uh-huh)
Tell zaddy order me some oysters with a side of that nuggies (okay)
So where them project niggas with them big ass figures? (Mm)
I'm a high class bitch, need a big bag spender (mwah)

You need a project bitch, a hood rat bitch (haan)
One don't give a fuck and say she took that dick
You need a project bitch, a hood rat bitch
Twerkin' up in traffic on some hood rat shit (alright)
I got your man throwin' bands
Pop that pussy for me, do a handstand (yeah, alright)
I got your man throwin' bands (throwin' bands)
Pop that pussy for me, do a handstand (haan) (alright)

I need a project bitch, a hood rat bitch
One don't give a fuck and say she took that dick (alright)
I need a project bitch, a hood rat bitch
