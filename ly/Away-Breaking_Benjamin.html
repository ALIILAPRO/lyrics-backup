		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cold am I, I'm beside myself
Because there's no one else
Have I grown so blind
Only God could save you
If you knew your way to the light
So fly away and leave it behind
Just stay away
There's nowhere to hide

I see you
'Cause you won't get out of my way
I hear you
'Cause you won't quit screaming my name
I feel you
'Cause you won't stop touching my skin
I need you
They're coming to take you away

Frail and dry, I could lose it all
But I cannot recall, it's all wrong
Don't cry, clear away this hate
And we could start to make it alright
So fly away and leave it behind
Return someday
With red in your eyes

I see you
'Cause you won't get out of my way
I hear you
'Cause you won't quit screaming my name
I feel you
'Cause you won't stop touching my skin
I need you
They're coming to take you away

I see you
'Cause you won't get out of my way
I hear you
'Cause you won't quit screaming my name
I feel you
'Cause you won't stop touching my skin
I need you
They're coming to take you away (away)
