		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been out chasing the feelings
Don't know what to say
But I wonder why
Should I guess I'm just running away?
Still killing, so I'm feeling the same
Still missing, 'cause I'm so bad with change
In my bed, let it carry my pain
Fuck the suicide, yeah, it's do or die
Stuck inside my mind, it ain't feeling right
Summer '22, that's accumulate
Let it all be on in my feelings, I
Running out of places, don't know where to go
Hopefully I make it racing down this road
In the heat, I wonder why it feels so cold
In the heat, the wind's stuck inside the flow (oh)

Long day so I bask in the moonlight
Looking up like "damn man, who's right?"
Pick apart every constellation
'Till the world goes black and my mind is vacant
I'm sick of the feeling of dying inside
Cyanide drip down the side of your thighs
And I'm tempted to try, so fuck it I might
And she tell me she vibe, and we fuckin' tonight
But the truth, it's not me, it's everything else
And nobody wanna talk about the way that I felt
Yeah, I'm human but I'm used to getting treated like; well
Couple rests on the bed, then I fuck up myself, damn, yeah
That's suicide
But it's better than a motherfuckin' suit and tie
I'm not somebody tryna' make it, getting supervised
It's either do or die, but either way you die, yeah.
