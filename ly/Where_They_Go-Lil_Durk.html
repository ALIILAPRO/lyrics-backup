		  (Ayo Bleu)
(Turn Me Up Josh)
(Young Cutta run it up)
Boy
Yeah
Let's get it

I wake up and I be feelin' I'm the realest
Standin' on my business, takin' care of my children
Late for court, I damn near hit civilian
I'm not trippin', I'm tryna get millions
Voice of the streets and all my niggas with it
I'm the same nigga, ain't nothin' different
This just a message, I hope the streets can hear me
You traded on me, man, that had me trippin'
I stopped sippin' lean, but I steady pop prescription (yeah, yeah)
Jakes on my dick, so I be duckin' the district (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Somebody tell Pluto I ain't have time to listen (oh)
Chiraq, I'm Jordan, so I wonder who Pippen?
What I do with this money, they standing on business
My lil' brother, he a big dawg, he coppin' the Bentley
And I ain't gotta have no condo to be on top of the city
Speakin' real shit, but the ones I cut off probably don't feel me

They used to be around for this cash, I'm like, "Where they go?"
They used to be around for that look, I'm like, "Where they go?"
They say they ass is my brother, but I'm like, "Where it go?"
They swear they have my back, but I'm like, "Where it go?"
Too many bitches around me, I'm like, "Where they go?"
Keep the city around me, I'm like, "Whoa, whoa"
Keep the trenches around me and I'm like, "Oh, whoa"
Keep the streets around me, I'm like, "Oh, oh"

Ayy, Shmurda, turn the streets up
Before I buy love, I'll buy my kids V-Bucks
Lamb' truck, Rolls truck, Bentley truck, three trucks
Ninety thousand for DeeDee bond, I still gave him a few bucks
Tell my niggas don't play with me if they thinkin' I'ma leave 'em
I don't care what they did for you, just hit me up if you need somethin'
Keep drivin', I see them now
Bitches all in my DMs now
Real rare you gon' see me cry
Fuckin' all on his BM now
And I be all in my feelings, oh
That shit hurt my soul
See they ain't hear if they ain't listenin'
They ain't tryna help my glow

They used to be around for this cash, I'm like, "Where they go?"
They used to be around for that look, I'm like, "Where they go?"
They say they ass is my brother, but I'm like, "Where it go?"
They swear they have my back, but I'm like, "Where it go?"
Too many bitches around me, I'm like, "Where they go?"
Keep the city around me, I'm like, "Whoa, whoa"
Keep the trenches around me and I'm like, "Oh, whoa"
Keep the streets around me, I'm like, "Oh, oh"
