		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What are we doing?
We're burning everything we love for something stupid
It's so confusing that we kill ourselves for what the news said
But maybe ruining our lives is part of being human
Or it's just rooted in our evolution

No use in running from something that you can't escape
It's what you wanted, it's in your fucking blood
You got a taste and now you love it
And now we're staring in the face of our annihilation
Isolated, wide awake, awaiting judgment

Lights out, we welcome the darkness
Black out our eyes and believe
We made a home for the heartless
To run away from reality

Living in the madness
Covered in the ashes
It's burning down, there's no way out
And I don't know where we're headed
Everything is broken
The sky is in the ocean
It's burning down, there's no way out
The sun goes down and it's Armageddon

The destruction in motion we're witnessing is related
We build explosive emotions and then we just detonate 'em
We play roulette with full clips then we go to bed praying
I'm fucking losing my shit, there's no solution, I hate it

I can't take it, I feel I'm on the edge and I'm breaking
I'm fucking bothered by the fact that the whole world's decimated
I see the faces, the anguish as it burns to the ground
We chose our fate and it's too late, no, there's no turning back now

Lights out, we welcome the darkness
Black out our eyes and believe
We made a home for the heartless
To run away from reality

Living in the madness
Covered in the ashes
It's burning down, there's no way out
And I don't know where we're headed
Everything is broken
The sky is in the ocean
It's burning down, there's no way out
The sun goes down and it's Armageddon

This is the end
This is the end

This is the end, so live it in the moment
Lights out, never feeling more alive
Stop pretending that you didn't want it
Light it up, burn it down and say goodbye

Lights out, we welcome the darkness
We made a home for the heartless

Living in the madness
Covered in the ashes
It's burning down, there's no way out
And I don't know where we're headed
Everything is broken
The sky is in the ocean
It's burning down, there's no way out
The sun goes down and it's Armageddon
