		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish we’d started in the rain
So that when it was gray
We’d think it was a fine and normal day
Yeah I think I misbehaved somewhere along the way
Now I wish I hadn’t strayed my moral lane

Cause now I know life is but a poem
that we write phrase by phase
Til we go to the catacombs where we lie..

It must be July cause I only wanna ride with my hair down
And listen to the sound of people on the town
It must be July cause I only wanna ride with my hair down
And listen to the sound of people on the town

I wish we’d started in a rush so if it got too much
We’d think we’re at a fine and normal pace
My head stays living in the middle of the mess I made I said
I wish I had a bed inside my brain

But now I know life is just a poem that we write phrase by phase
Til we go to the catacombs where we lie

It must be July cause I only wanna ride with my hair down
And listen to the sound of people on the town
It must be July cause I only wanna ride with my hair down
And listen to the sound of people on the town

Well it must be July cause I only wanna ride with my hair down
Baby baby baby
It must be July cause I only wanna ride with my hair down.....

It must be July cause I only wanna ride with my hair down
And listen to the sound of people on the town
(woooh//yeah)
It must be July cause I only wanna ride with my hair down
And listen to the sound of people on the town
