		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go to bed now I can tell
Pain is on the way out now
Look at the way the domino falls away

I know it's hard looking in
Knowing that tomorrow you'll be back again
Hang your head and let me in, I'm waiting
So long

I was staring into the light
When I saw you in the distance, I knew that you'd be mine
Am I moving back in time?
Just standing still?

I met a man with a broken back
He had a fear in his eyes that I could understand
I can't even shake the hand
Without breaking it

I've been pulling on a wire, but it just won't break
I've been turning up the dial, but I hear no sound
I resist what I cannot change
And I wanna find what can't be found

I'm aware of the time we lost
Like a demon in the doorway, waiting to be born
But I'm here all alone, just begging

Pull me close and let me hold you in
Give me the deeper understanding of who I am
Yeah, I'm moving back again, I'm waiting, yeah

I'm just pulling on a wire, but it just won't break
I've been turning up the dial, but I hear no sound
I resist what I cannot change, own it in your own way
Yeah, I wanna find what can't be found
