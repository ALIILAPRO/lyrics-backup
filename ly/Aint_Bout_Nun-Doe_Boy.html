		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up (go, go, go)
Let's go (go, go, go)
Go, go (go, go, go)
Go, go (go, go, go)
Let's go

You want war, bitch, I want duck, it ain't 'bout nothin' (Doe Beezy)
My ice on, you ain't gon' touch, it ain't 'bout nothin' (fool)
If I want her, then I'm fuckin', ain't 'bout nothin' (come here, baby)
What you want? Ain't got no budget, ain't 'bout nothin' (oh, really?)
Who talkin' 'bout somethin'? It ain't 'bout nothin' (think I'm playin'?)
Bitch, I walk up in the spot up clutchin' (bop, bop, who want smoke?)
If I want her, then I'm fuckin', ain't 'bout nothin' (come here, baby)
Spend that shit, ain't got no budget, ain't 'bout nothin' (what you want? Freebandz)

Rich like a ball player, bragger and a boaster (Doe Beezy)
I ain't sweet like Pillsbury, pop out with that toaster (bop-bop-bop-bop)
Let me call my driver 'cause the Bentley too hot (skrrt)
Hangin' out the window, middle fingers up like 2Pac (oh, really?)
If I had a girl, I'd probably buy my girl a ring
But since I don't, I bought that nigga bitch a chain (ha)
Throwin' up my gang, twistin' up my fingers (gang, gang, gang)
She bad on Instagram, she weak, for real, just know her angles (goodbye, baby)
Left wrist like sixty bands, right wrist a hundred bands
Steppin' on a opp in these Rick Owens, fuck them Jumpmans (Ricky)
I won't give a damn if my album reached a hundred fans
Opp gang got a hundred fans
They wish they was Rubberbands (oh, really?)

You want war, bitch, I want duck, it ain't 'bout nothin' (Doe Beezy, let's go)
My ice on, you ain't gon' touch, it ain't 'bout nothin' (fool)
If I want her, then I'm fuckin', ain't 'bout nothin' (come here, baby)
What you want? Ain't got no budget, ain't 'bout nothin' (oh, really?)
Who talkin' 'bout somethin'? It ain't 'bout nothin' (think I'm playin'?)
Bitch, I walk up in the spot clutchin' (bop, bop, who want smoke?)
If I want her, then I'm fuckin', ain't 'bout nothin' (come here, baby, ain't 'bout nothin')
Spend that shit, ain't got no budget, ain't 'bout nothin' (what you want?)

Doe Beezy
Oh, really?
