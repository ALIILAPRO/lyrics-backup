		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Certain types of fire
Does it burn us into shapes?
Always tends to make everything
In the universe seem like a tiny sparkle
Unexpected and cute thankfully
Gratefully gone in an instant

And everything crumbles into pieces
In a blooming fractal flood
But no one staring at it can believe it
As it freezes out the sun an empty dream
A stupid dream a hopeless dream
And everything continues
Just like everything does just like pain
Just like love

Just like love I can't explain the
Way I feel at all, o'ooh
I wanted, I wanted to show what I meant
But the meaning just slipped thru my hands
I wanted to do better than I did
But isn't that just life?

And everything crumbles into pieces
In a blooming fractal flood
But no one staring at it can believe it
As it freezes out the sun an empty dream
A stupid dream a hopeless dream
And everything continues
Just like everything does just like pain
Just like love
