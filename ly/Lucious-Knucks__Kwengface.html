		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  SRB separation confirmed
Coming up on uh, staging the burnout of these
Twin, solid rocket boosters at two minutes
Five seconds carns Hill production
Hi, yeah

At the top on my own
Right where I'm supposed to be (yeah, uh)
Labels tryna offer me dough (Woah)
That's how it's supposed to be (yeah)
I was like "cute" right under her post
(Woah) but now she postin' me (yeah)
If I ain't yet considered the GOAT
Then I'm close to be (yeah)
I must be (Must)
Stand up guy, you can trust me (Woah, yeah)
Mandem lyin' like Jussie (Hey)
Catch me in a lie, you can cuff me (Uh)
Fuck it (Woah)
Lucious Lyon on fuckery (Fuck)
These yutes all like to discuss me (Uh, ayy)
No suit and tie, you can buck me (yeah, hey)
If you're gonna use my lines, do it properly
(Uh, hey)

Yo i was on the roof like
Bruce in Gotham, watchin'
Seein' how the music bustin'
Sellin' unit's, now they move in dozens
Bare of these yutes tryna prove we cousins
(Wait) hold on, family
You ain't show face at
The do's and functions (What?)
New Twitter space and a new discussion
Comin' like Adz when I slew and cuff 'em
(Nothin') it's cool, it's nothin'
He's bluffin', I read that clear (Uh)
Call that bluff and leave 'em in tears
I'll leave man's company in arrears (Hey)
Ain't dropped no music in years
I'll take man's spot like musical chairs
(Uh) they ain't even stopped the tune
That ain't fair
But who really cares? (No one)
Baby, it's Mr fring
Eighteen K on my wrist and ring
Manna get laid when I lift my chin (Hey)
Babe, I don't miss a thing (Uh, uh)
Top of the mornin' to ya
That's what I say when I'm listenin' in
So many take in my songs like grub (yeah)
That man try savour my shit in cling (Ayy)

Yo, look
G lock on my waist where it's supposed to be
(Grrah, bap)
These niggas competin', couldn't
Complete it, couldn't get close to me
(Never) every time I done me a drill
Left my phone and I took off my rosary
(True) fucked this bitch so hard
Baby girl proposed to me (Ayy, come here)
Look if I bring that star to your hood
I can see the opp boys doin' up strides
(Run up) i can never be like them man there
Them man just tellin' them lies (Nope)
I got a distinctive voice
So I can't say a word when
I go on them glides (True)
I heard certain man are washed
In jail just smokin' spice ('Low it)
Look, step 'round there like di-di-dip
(yeah yeah)
Do it like Lookman, flow, man's dribblin'
(yeah yeah)
Brown skin ting on my dick, she's dribblin'
Anythin' brr-brr, drillin' it (Bap)
This music ting, man's killin' it
And your girl's insides, yeah
Man's fillin' it
Them opp boy zoots, man's hittin' it
Swing it to her, got her hittin' it yeah
