		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I won't go back, that's how I feel about it) true
(Put it in my interview if you're real about it) yeah
(If I move on, then you gon' hear about it) yeah
(I feel a way and I feel real about it)

Yeah, I'm just tryna survive the night 
And take my own advice
And never love again
Toxic as you are, you're a vice
Can't get you out of my mind
I took the drug again, yeah
Not a good decision inside, it's only you by my side
I've had enough again, yeah, uh
Who told you you get to decide the way I'm feelin' inside?
I'm fuckin' over it

I love you
You just take advantage 'cause you know I do
I can't wait until I'm strong enough to walk away
I can't wait until your love don't make me feel a way

Yeah, I'm just tryna survive the night 
And take my own advice
And never love again
Toxic as you are, you're a vice
Can't get you out of my mind
I took the drug again, yeah
Not a good decision inside, it's only you by my side
I've had enough again, yeah, uh
Who told you you get to decide the way I'm feelin' inside?
I'm fuckin' over it

(Who told you you get to decide?)
(Who told you you get to decide the way I'm feelin' inside?)
I'm fuckin' over it
Oh, oh, oh (woo)

I won't go back, that's how I feel about it
Put it in my interview if you're real about it
If I move on, then you gon' hear about it
I feel a way and I feel real about it

I love you
You just take advantage 'cause you know I do
I can't wait until I'm strong enough to walk away
I can't wait until your love don't make me feel a way

Yeah, I'm just tryna survive the night 
And take my own advice
