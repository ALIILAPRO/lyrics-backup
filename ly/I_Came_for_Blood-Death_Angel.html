		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The bloody nose of victory
Fueled by seeds of hate
Make peace with my enemies?
No chance! Not today!
I’ve travelled through the unknown
That is where I thrive
You chose to say my name aloud
So, I shall never die

You can’t break me down
For my time is now
I will make you see
This battle is not an option
It’s part of who is me

I came for blood
My one desire
I will get what I need
I came for blood
This heart of fire
Is drving me

A battered soul for destiny
I know I’ll pull through
No one here can stop me
Not him, not her, not you!

I’ve watched your body wither
Your courage turn to dust
I’ll rise to fight another day
On  that you can trust

I came for blood
My one desire
Is to make you
Make you bleed
