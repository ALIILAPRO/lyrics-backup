		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Things will never be the same
Still I'm awfully glad I came
Resonating in the shape of things to come
Never waiting when I know there's only one

Messed it up but rest assured
No one ever thinks they're cured
Just a minute while I reinvent myself
Make it up and then I take it off the shelf

Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go

Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this
For the story

The rising moon is on the shine
The blood of scorpios a nine
Like the fear that's in the eyes of every doe
Say it now cause John and Jane would like to know

Is it safe inside your head
Songs to serenade the dead
All along I said I know no enemies
Mix it up until there are no pedigrees

Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go

Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this
For the story

Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go

Enter the rolling tide
Over the ocean so wide
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go

Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this
For the story

Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this
For the story

Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this
For the story
