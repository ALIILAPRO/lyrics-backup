		<p>
		  Say she need an upgrade 

Got some places to go

She need her own space 

To bring a new one home 

And I say ok 

Do whatever you want ya ya 

Told me to let go 

So I asked her how come  

She said I said so 

Yeah she hit and she runs 

Just like a klepto 

Cause she takes what she wants ya ya 

I watch my world burn down light up my backyard

Blow smoke bow out, I know what you are 

 

You don’t really want my heart no, you just wanna steal it 

You don’t really want my heart no, you just wanna feel it 

 

Ripping out of my chest 

In the palm of your hand 

Bleeding out on your dress

Until I’m crying for more 

 

But you don’t really want my heart no, you just wanna steal it 

I need an upgrade 

I hit another new low

Can’t shake this headache 

It even hurts in my toes 

You were my favorite mistake 

But that’s the way that it goes
