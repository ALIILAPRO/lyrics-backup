		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sorry I ain't got no money
I'm not trying to be funny but I left it all at home today
You can call me what you wanna I ain't giving you a dollar
This time I ain't gonna run away
You might knock me down, you might knock me down
But I will get back up again
You can call it how you wanna, I ain't giving you a dollar
This time I ain't gonna run away, run away, run away

This time, this time
This time, this time I ain't gonna run, run, run, run, run
Not this time, not this time
Not this time
Not this time

Sorry I ain't got no money 
I'm not trying to be funny but I left it all at home today
You can call me what you wanna I ain't giving you a dollar
This time I ain't gonna run away
You might knock me down, you might knock me down
But I will get back up again
You can call it how you wanna I ain't giving you a dollar
This time I ain't gonna run away, run away, run away

This time, this time
This time, this time I ain't gonna run, run, run, run, run, run
Not this time, not this time
This time I ain't gonna run, run, run, run
Not this time
Not this time
Not this time
Not this time
Not this time
