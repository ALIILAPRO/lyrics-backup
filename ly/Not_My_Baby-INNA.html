		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's not the way it was before
His touch was heaven, I remember
But every rose, it has its thorn
Before you know, you prick your finger

Two truths, one lie
Don't really need it
No, not tonight
Three words, nice try
Don't even mean it
It ain't a secret that

He's not my baby, my baby, my baby now
He's not my baby, my baby wouldn't let me down
I fell for those eyes one too many times, oh oh
He's not my baby, my baby, my baby now

I fell for those eyes one too many times, oh-oh
He's not my baby, my baby, my baby now

He was the perfect kinda rain (perfect kinda rain)
The kind that comes but never lingers
He knew exactly what to say (what to say)
To only paint you half the picture

Two truths, one lie
Don't really need it
No, not tonight
Three words, nice try
Don't even mean it
It ain't a secret that

He's not my baby, my baby, my baby now
He's not my baby, my baby wouldn't let me down
I fell for those eyes one too many times, oh-oh
He's not my baby, my baby, my baby now

I fell for those eyes one too many times, oh oh
He's not my baby, my baby, my baby now

He's not my baby, my baby, my baby now
He's not my baby, my baby wouldn't let me down
I fell for those eyes one too many times, oh-oh
He's not my baby, my baby, my baby now

He's not my baby, my baby, my baby now
