		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody is leaving I can feel nothing
This room is empty
Why are you still here?
Are you coming with me?
Are you leaving like all of them?

Everybody is laughing I can hear nothing
Your words are empty
Why are you still here?
Are you coming with me?
Are you leaving like all of them? Like them

Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye

Can you be my friend, not a fan
Girl, can you stay when I'm in pain
Honestly, I'm numb and dumb, you see?
You can leave whenever you want

Girl, can you prove your loyalty
I'm just checking
If you're the same like them, I'd say again
Bye bye bye bye bye bye

My dad once told me, "trust nobody,
Be a fisherman, keep your net hidden
You'll be fine if you have the bait
Nothing's free, you always need to pay

Use them all, don't be friends with them son
Use your brain, do not follow your heart"
I thought he was a cold blooded dude
But now I get why he said all that

Everybody is leaving I can feel nothing
This room is empty
Why are you still here?
Are you coming with me?
Are you leaving like all of them?

Everybody is laughing I can hear nothing
Your words are empty
Why are you still here?
Are you coming with me
Are you leaving like all of them? Like them

Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye

Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye

All my sacrifices, do you think that they know this?
All my favors and blood, do you think it was worth it?
I felt like a tool for them, Lord he might get it
'Cause he's the only friend who knows my secret

Hello, are you listening?
I know, don't look at me like that
Look around, now you are the only person I can talk to
I have another meeting with the devil here after you (after you)

Prove me that you're better than him
I hope you get a solution for this circumstance
Truly, I want you to stay here

Everybody is leaving I can feel nothing
This room is empty
Why are you still here?
Are you coming with me?
Are you leaving like all of them?

Everybody is laughing I can hear nothing
Your words are empty
Why are you still here?
Are you coming with me
Are you leaving like all of them? Like them

Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Trying to disconnect from all these hypocrite cartels

Keep me awake in this system
One eyed asleep, to keep distance
Masked up they all so attractive
Friends and enemies all look the same

Just like all these flaws covered up in tattoos
Cover up there thoughts hiding all of there truth
The sunday smiling faces eating up my value
Oh, I am to scared to go to church

God how am I supposed to love my neighbours
When they all just bunch of mannequins trying to cage my soul

Everybody is leaving I can feel nothing
This room is empty
Why are you still here?
Are you coming with me?
Are you leaving like all of them?

Everybody is laughing I can hear nothing
Your words are empty
Why are you still here?
Are you coming with me
Are you leaving like all of them? Like them

Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye

Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
