		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  See I just can't relate
You try to pretend we're the same
But we ain't the same
You try to pretend for the fame
I say you a lame, yeah
I can't relate, I can't relate
I cannot relate, I cannot relate
Nah yeah

You try to pretend we're the same
But we ain't the same
You try to pretend for the fame
I say you a lame
I can't relate, I can't relate
I cannot relate, I cannot relate

Had an epiphany
Scream this
I'm in control of my destiny
Ominous entity 
Mephisto has no control of me
Rather be wrapped up in cellophane 
Then give my soul for the fame
Well I must be new to this game 
Even though they all know my name
All I ever wanted was another one 
To feel me on a mental level 
And not just the devil 
Or malevolent evolutions of the animal in me
You tell me you feel me 
But I don't believe it the next thing 
Then you gon' turn on me
Let everybody believe the lies
I'll be fine, I'll be fine

(War is peace
Freedom is slavery
Ignorance is strength)

See I just can't relate
You try to pretend we're the same
But we ain't the same
You try to pretend for the fame
I say you a lame, yeah
I can't relate, I can't relate
I cannot relate, I cannot relate
Nah yeah

You try to pretend we're the same
But we ain't the same
You try to pretend for the fame
I say you a lame
I can't relate, I can't relate
I cannot relate, I cannot relate
