I've just been vibing and writing, I'm high and I'm driving, I probably should not
This is legit, I pull up at your crib then I hop out the whip and god damnit you're hot
We chill on the bed, while you give me head, you do that the best and I'll put that on God
We hit the town, We drink till we drown, how much have I had, I know it's a lot

Ayy

We just pulled up in a six-speed, link up with the gang now we six deep
Start at the domain then hit 6th street, taking shots to the brain of some whiskey
Music bumping so loud and I'm dizzy, the chick that I'm with is so pretty
The way that I'm living is risky, I'm really so lit in the city, the club boutta close in like twenty for real

I'm finishing this drink in my cup
I'm tripping as I exit the club
I think I saw the Uber pull up
I'm gone, She's gone, We both gone

Soon as we get back to her house, We head to her couch
Smoke in the air like a burnout
Got a sack of the green like it's Watt on the play versus Philly on 3rd down
Ayy
I could really make her tap-out, like smackdown, with her ass out, or I could pass out from being blackout

I've just been vibing and writing, I'm high and I'm driving, I probably should not
This is legit, I pull up at your crib then I hop out the whip and god damnit you're hot
We chill on the bed, while you give me head, you do that the best and I'll put that on God
We hit the town, We drink till we drown, how much have I had, I know it's a lot

Ayy

My vision blurry I'm faded, Walk through this bitch and it's feeling like Haiti
In 2010 back when that shit was shaking, I'm nearly sedated and theres no debating
The way that I'm feeling is clearly amazing, I'm slurring my words, what the fuck am I saying
Last time this happened was in College Station, but that was last May back when I graduated like

I'm finishing this drink in my cup
I'm tripping as I exit the club
I think I saw the Uber pull up
I'm gone, She's gone, We both gone

Back at my place now, she like where I stay now
You know we're in H-town, cuz that's my muthafuckin playground
It's kinda late now, she gon' ride on me like I'm a greyhound
Told her she don't even have to pay now, gotta couple racks in my bank account
She gotta nice rack in my face wow

I've just been vibing and writing, I'm high and I'm driving, I probably should not
This is legit, I pull up at your crib then I hop out the whip and god damnit you're hot
We chill on the bed, while you give me head, you do that the best and I'll put that on God
We hit the town, We drink till we drown, how much have I had, I know it's a lot

I've just been vibing and writing, I'm high and I'm driving, I probably should not
This is legit, I pull up at your crib then I hop out the whip and god damnit you're hot
We chill on the bed, while you give me head, you do that the best and I'll put that on God
We hit the town, We drink till we drown, how much have I had, I know it's a lot
