		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now, Whittier arrived in fictional California
We're gonna bring it on again
Bring it on to you hard
Our school spirit was defined by dance and drama
The Lord above will be my guide
The light into my heart

Open the light to the darkness
Open your heart, let it all hang out
Open your life to the hardness
Open your mind 'til it all falls out
Let it all fall out

Now that I have survived the spectacle of my youth
I'm gonna bring it on again
Bring it on with my truth
My foolish spirit was denied by a romance diorama
I put my passion in my pride
My beloved was finally refused

Open the light to the darkness
Open your heart, let it all hang out
Open your life to the hardness
Open your mind 'til it all falls out
Let it all fall out

I'm all alone at the megaphone
I'm all psyched up as I make my mark in total darkness
I look alive but I feel so dead inside, I'm bleeding
Gonna break a leg with the basket toss for the loss of my broken dreams

Now, Whittier arrived in fictional California
We're gonna bring it on again
Bring it on to you hard
