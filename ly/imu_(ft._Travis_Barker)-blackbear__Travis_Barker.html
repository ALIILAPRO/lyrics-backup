		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe we could talk tomorrow
When I'm not so hungover
I miss you at the worst times
I miss you even though it's over
You cared when it was convenient
You said that you didn't mean it
You'd rather be alone, you'd rather be a ghost
And I don't wanna believe it, yeah

(Na, na, na, na)
I miss you even though that it's over
(Na, na, na, na)
I miss you even though that it's over

Yeah, got me feelin pathetic for myself
I just don't get it
I could be empathetic
We sleep in the same bed
Feels like we're on different planets
I gotta protect myself from something I'll just regret
I'm holding a knife and running, not knowing where I'm headed

Forgive me for what I've done wrong
I wanna say sorry but it's been so long
I'm up all night, but sleepin' in late
I know that you'll be gone when I'm awake
So

Maybe we could talk tomorrow
When I'm not so hungover
I miss you at the worst times
I miss you even though it's over
You cared when it was convenient
You said that you didn't mean it
You'd rather be alone, you'd rather be a ghost
And I don't wanna believe it, yeah

(Na, na, na, na)
I miss you even though that it's over
(Na, na, na, na)
I miss you even though that it's over

Got me feelin' pathetic for myself
I just don't get it
We feel the same way, don't know how to fuckin' express it
We wanna save each other from something we'll both regret
It's like running with scissors, pretending we're gonna learn our lesson
Forget I said it

Forgive me for what I've done wrong
I wanna say sorry but it's been so long
I'm up all night, I'm sleepin' in late
I know that you'll be gone when I'm awake
So

Maybe we could talk tomorrow
When I'm not so hungover
I miss you at the worst times
I miss you even though it's over
You cared when it was convenient
You said that you didn't mean it
You'd rather be alone, you'd rather be a ghost
And I don't wanna believe it, so

(Na, na, na, na)
I miss you even though that it's over
(Na, na, na, na)
I miss you even though that it's over

Forgive me for what I've done wrong
I wanna say sorry but it's been so long
I'm up all night, I'm sleepin' in late
I know that you'll be gone when I'm awake
So

Maybe we could talk tomorrow
When I'm not so hungover
I miss you at the worst times
I miss you even though it's over
You cared when it was convenient
You said that you didn't mean it
You'd rather be alone, you'd rather be a ghost
And I don't wanna believe it
So

(Na, na, na, na)
I miss you even though that it's over
(Na, na, na, na)
I miss you even though that it's over
