		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was a little drunk on a Friday night
Feeling sorry for myself and I just thought I'd test my luck
So I slid in on the low thinking nobody has to know
I've never done this before but I just though we'd... huh
But that was six months ago since we've been talking
Feels so right so right and now I'm falling
Stole my heart and changed my point of view
Cause if I told you that I loved you
You could take it all away from me way from me
Told you that I trust you
That you could take all of me everything
If I, if I
If I told you that I loved you
Ya you could be mine
And I'd take care of you
And I'd take care of you
And I'd take care of
Every little thing that you could ever want
I'm just here to open doors
Looking fine as hell in my hoodie on the couch
Wearing it like it's been yours
Every day's been great since I met you
Wouldn't change a thing since I met you
Know it's kinda lame get your name in a frame as a tattoo
Cause if I told you that I loved you
You could take it all away from me way from me
Told you that I trust you
That you could take all of me everything
If I, if I
If I told you that I loved you
Ya you could be mine
And I'd take care of you
I'd take care of you
And I'd take care of
And I'd take care of you
I'd take care of you
