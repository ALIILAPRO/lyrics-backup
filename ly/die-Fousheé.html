		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I looked so good he died
Nigga, just shut up and drive
I said I want it and he buy it
In Saint Laurent throwing riots

I want my champagne in my hand while I shop
She in the bathroom doing lines
Walk in that bitch and watch all the groupies flock
This ho too close, I wanna fight
Pushing one-twenty I can't stand the way he drive
You want this pussy, nigga, put it on your life
They hate I'm pressure, when I pull I'm not trying
This unreleased Balenciaga on my body

I looked so good he died
Nigga, just shut up and drive
I said I want it and he buy it
In Saint Laurent throwing riots
Die
(Die, die)

I got frienemies, I got mini me's
He wanna spoil me, I need a hundred piece
He can't afford me, he can't afford me
He can't afford me
He off the ketamine
He doing too much
He said I'm too mean
Like I give a fuck
You better tighten up
Stop crying and light the blunt
Stop whining and throw some ones
Nigga you better sober up (die)

(I looked so) good he died
Nigga, just shut up and drive
I said I want it and he buy it
In Saint Laurent throwing riots

I looked so good he died
Nigga, just shut up and drive
I said I want it and he buy it
In Saint Laurent throwing riots

Fight
Die
