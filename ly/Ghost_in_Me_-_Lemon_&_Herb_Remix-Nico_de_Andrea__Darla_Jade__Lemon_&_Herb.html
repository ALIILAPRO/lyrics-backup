		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can see your 
ghost in me 
I’m not who I used to be 
Broken mirrors
All I see 
Demons staring back at me

Someone that we loved 
Someone that we trust 
Someone we looked up to
When the times were rough
This is bittersweet
Now i’m incomplete
I wish I could meet
The man you could have been

Ooh ohhh ohhh 
Ghost in me
Ooh ohhh ohhh 
Ghost in me

Ghost in me
Ghost in me

Ooh ohhh ohhh 
Ghost in me
Ooh ohhh ohhh 
Ghost in me

Someone that we loved 
Someone that we trust 
Someone we looked up to
When the times were rough
This is bittersweet
Now i’m incomplete
I wish I could meet
The man you could have been

Ooh ohhh ohhh 
Ghost in me
Ooh ohhh ohhh 
Ghost in me

Ghost in me
Ghost in me

Ooh ohhh ohhh 
Ghost in me
Ooh ohhh ohhh 
Ghost in me

Ghost in me
Ghost in me
Ghost in me
