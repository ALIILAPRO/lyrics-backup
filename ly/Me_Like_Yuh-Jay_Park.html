		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I need a Cha Cha beat boy)

I can only do right by ya
I won't ever go deceive ya
I'd even dye my hair blonde for ya
I can be your Justin Bieber
Gimme that work like you RiRi
Girl, pop it like three D
Your wish is like genies
Oh let me see that thing baby

Trust me
This is the moment you been waiting for, girl all your life
Tell your friends that you don't need a ride home
'Cause I got you tonight
The Uber's on the way
'Cause I had a couple drinks tonight
But I'm more drunk off of your love
Baby I just can't get enough
So baby girl

Wake up, wake up, let's get it started
Stay up, stay up, girl I'll be on it
Don't go to bed, unless you go with me
Phone blowing up, I'ma let the hotline bling, girl

Baby, me like yuh
I'll make you feel so good
Do you just like I should
I hope you know it
I hope you know it

I hope you know it
I hope you know it

The way you workin' that motion
Girl you got me in a trance
It's like I'm crossing the ocean
A journey to another land, oh no no
Babe, you got a heartbeat is saying, no no no
Oh, you're from another place, uh no no
I wanna rock your, rock your body
Girl, you got me so excited

Trust me
This is the moment I've been waiting for, girl all my life
I got no other intentions, only just to come and do you right
Baby, set for waves that gather in the moment up all night
It's an unforgettable love
Baby I just can't get enough

Wake up, wake up, let's get it started (let's get it started)
Stay up, stay up, girl I'll be on it
Don't go to bed, unless you go with me
Phone blowing up, I'ma let the hotline bling 'cause (oh) girl

Baby, me like yuh
I'll make you feel so good
Do you just like I should
I hope you know it
I hope you know it

I hope you know it
I hope you know it

Baby, look into my eyes
We inside your paradise, baby
Paradise
Feel the breeze upon your skin
Capture this so it'll never end, never end, oh oh, yeah

Baby, me like yuh
I'll make you feel so good
Do you just like I should
Baby, me like yuh
I'll make you feel so good
Do you just like I should
I hope you know it
I hope you know it
