		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As I was walkin' down the street
Down the street, down the street
I met somebody who was mighty sweet
Mighty fair to see

I asked her would she like to have a talk
Have a talk, make some talk
All the fellows standin' on the walk
Wishin' they were me

Mama, Mama, let me dress up tonight
Dress up tonight, dress up tonight
I've got a secret, gonna 'fess up tonight
Gonna dance by the light of the moon

Gonna dance with a dolly with a hole in her stockin'
While our knees keep a-knockin' and our toes keep a-rockin'
Dance with a dolly with a hole in her stockin'
Dance by the light of the moon

Mama, Mama, put the cat out tonight
Cat out tonight, cat out tonight
Worked all day, I'm gonna scat out tonight
And I won't be home until dawn

Gonna dance with a dolly with a hole in her stockin'
While our knees keep a-knockin' and our toes keep a-rockin'
Dance with a dolly with a hole in her stockin'
Dance by the light of the moon

Gonna dance by the light of the moon
Dance by the light of the moon
By the light of the moon
