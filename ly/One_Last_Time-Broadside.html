		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can we get one more night?
Can we get one last time to feel it?
Like we felt before
Back when we wanted, back when we wanted it?

In my mind, things aren't like they used to
Be, fine, guess I'm getting used to
Sleepless nights and empty eyes
It's agony, living with your memory
I wish I could press rewind
Maybe I'd feel alive

Back and forth till we both feel sick
But I'll never get sick of it

Can we get one more night?
Can we get one last time to feel it?
Like we felt before
Back when we wanted, back back when we wanted it
Can't you see all this irony?
Wanted what we had, what we had, what we wanted
Back when we wanted, back back when we wanted it
Back when we wanted, back back when we wanted it

On this paradise
Heaven's too small in my mind
Tear my sins apart for you?
What's left to lose
It's insanity
I just need your ecstasy
Leave your body next to me
Next to me

Can we get one more night?
Can we get one last time to feel it?
Like we felt before
Back when we wanted, back back when we wanted it
Can't you see all this irony?
Wanted what we had, what we had, what we wanted
Back when we wanted, back back when we wanted it
Right back when we wanted it

Back and forth till we both feel sick
Ain't no winners in a game like this
Back and forth till we both feel sick
But I'll never get sick of it

Can we get one more night?
Can we get one last time to feel it?
Like we felt before
Back when we wanted, back back when we wanted it
Can't you see all this irony?
Wanted what we had, what we had, what we wanted
Back when we wanted, back back when we wanted it
Right back when we wanted it
Back when we wanted, back back when we wanted it
