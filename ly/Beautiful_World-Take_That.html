		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here standing in the rain 
The sun has gone again and nothing's gonna change 
Time, I need a little time
As you slip out of sight 
And nothing heals the pain 

And I know that it's you
That's stopping me from falling 
Crashing down, losing ground
'Til I see you again
And you know

[Chorus]
The sun will shine, and we will see
There's nothing standing in our way 
Love will stand and never break 
I never thought this could be me 
Do you feel what I feel
Every time that you are near it's a beautiful world 
A beautiful world 

Words are hard to keep inside 
Even though I've tried, impossible to hide 
And you know that it's me
That's stopping you from falling 
Crashing down, losing ground 
'Til I see you again 
And you know

[Chorus]

I'll be the stars guiding you 
I'll be the place that you hide 
I'd run a thousand miles, a thousand miles
To be by your side

[Chorus]
