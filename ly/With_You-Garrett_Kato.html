		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember when we got lost
Sleeping in and smoking pot
Never been afraid to grow
Always good at letting go
Stories that we tell ourselves
Could be lies but I can’t tell
Dreaming as the evening fell
You always knew
The right thing to do
When walking through the darkness
I said to you
Take care and that soon
We’ll go down dancing     
I’ll be honest when I say
This pain isn’t meant to stay 
With you 
All the things we said before
Are getting harder to ignore   
And everything that I forgot 
And everything that I am not
Dreaming as the road goes on
I see you now before it’s gone
You always knew
The right thing to do
When walking through the darkness
I said to you
Take care and that soon
We’ll go down dancing     
I’ll be honest when I say
This pain isn’t meant to stay 
With you 
(Dreaming as the road goes on)
(I see you now before it’s gone)
You always knew
The right thing to do
When walking through the darkness
I said to you
Take care and that soon
We’ll go down dancing     
I’ll be honest when I say
This pain isn’t meant to stay 
With you
