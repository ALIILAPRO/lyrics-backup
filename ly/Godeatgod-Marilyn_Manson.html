		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dear God, do you want to tear your knuckles down
And hold yourself?
Dear God, can you climb off that tree
Meat in the shape of a 'T'?
Dear God, the paper says 
You were the King in the black limousine
Dear John and all the King's men
Can't put your head together again

Before the bullets
Before the flies
Before authorities 
Take out my eyes
The only smiling are you dolls that I made
But you are plastic 
So are your brains

Dear God, the sky is as blue
As a gunshot wound
Dear God, if you were alive
You know we'd kill you

Before the bullets
Before the flies
Before authorities 
Take out my eyes
The only smiling are you dolls that I made
But you are plastic 
So are your brains
