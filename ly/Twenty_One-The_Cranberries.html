		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't think it's going to happen anymore
You took my thoughts from me, now I want nothing more
And did you think you could just take it all away
I don't think it's happening, this is what I say

Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone 'cause I found it all
Twenty one, twenty one
Twenty one

So I don't think it's going to happen anymore
I don't think it's going to happen anymore

Twenty one, twenty one
Twenty one
Twenty one, twenty one
Twenty one

Today
Today
Today
Today

Twenty one, twenty one
Twenty one, twenty one
Twenty one, twenty one
Twenty one, twenty one
Twenty one, twenty one
Twenty one
Twenty one, twenty one
Twenty one
