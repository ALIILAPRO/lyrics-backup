		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cherry lip apocalypse
The world ends at her perfect hips
The sweetest smile on the internet
How could I compete with that?

God perfected and I'm defective
They say beauty's just subjective
Guess I never got the message
Call it Instagram depression

Don't be critical, I'm so miserable
I compare myself to all this physical
All things digital, pretty on a screen
I wish that was me

I've got self dysmorphia (dysmorphia)
A constant reminder I was made wrong (made wrong, made wrong)
I've got a full me phobia
This party'd be better with me, me gone (me gone, me gone)

Hm, I wonder why (dysmorphia)
Hm, I wonder why (made wrong, made wrong)

Dirty mirror on the wall
Who's the fairest of them all?
It's not me, but I could find
A billion girls to fit that type

And I'm just typecast as the friend
I'll make you laugh but not the prettiest
I keep trying to work on me
But you can't photograph a personality

Don't be critical, I'm so miserable
I compare myself to all this physical
All things digital, pretty on a screen
I wish that was me

I've got self dysmorphia (dysmorphia)
A constant reminder I was made wrong (made wrong, made wrong)
I've got a full me phobia
This party'd be better with me, me gone (me gone, me gone)

Hm, I wonder why (dysmorphia)
Hm, I wonder why (made wrong, made wrong)
(Dysmorphia)
