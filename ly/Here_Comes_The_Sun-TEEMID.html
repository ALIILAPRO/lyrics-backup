		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's alright
It's alright

It's alright
Here comes the sun
It's alright
Here comes the sun

Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's alright
It's alright

Little darlin', the smile's returning to their faces
Little darlin', it seems like years since it's been here
Sun, sun, sun
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
The sun

It's alright
Here comes the sun
It's alright
Here comes the sun

Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's alright
It's alright

It's alright
Here comes the sun
It's alright
Here comes the sun
