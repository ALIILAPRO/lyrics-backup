		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you think I should change the way I am
Just to please you
You know I won't do that
So fuck that
You know I won't change my colors
'Cause I love me being myself
I won't do nothing just for you
So fuck that

So fuck that
So fuck that

You know me
So fuck that

So fuck that

If you think you're better than me
Just think twice
I ain't tryin' to show you how special I am
So fuck that
You know, I really don't care much about you or what you're sayin'
I got no time to lose, don't bother me
So fuck that

So fuck that
So fuck that

You know me
So fuck that

So fuck that

Hatin' on me
You don't like what you see
But unlike you I'm free
So just let me be
You can say what you want, judge me, but I won't despair
'Cause I really don't care
'Cause I really don't care

You know me
Fuck that

So fuck that
