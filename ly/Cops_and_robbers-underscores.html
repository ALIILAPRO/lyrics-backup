		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been working as a bank teller for like eleven years
It all started when I didn't have enough to pay for the crystal
And ain't it funny how, out of nowhere, all this money appears?
I've got a cash drawer and a keyboard, and I've got all of your info

When's the last time you saw someone with a ski mask and a gun?
Get on the inside
You gotta do it, gotta do it, gotta do it like me
When's the last time you saw someone with a ski mask and a gun?
Get on the inside
You gotta do it, gotta do it, gotta do it like me

I write false checks, I plant the counterfeits, I trim the fat from the vault
I need a John Smith or a Jane Doe, the more common the better
I resurrect the dead, I hit the ATM, and I've never been caught
I'm not the bad guy, like it's just sitting there, and the dead ain't getting any deader

When's the last time you saw someone with a ski mask and a gun?
Get on the inside
You gotta do it, gotta do it, gotta do it like me
When's the last time you saw someone with a ski mask and a gun?
Get on the inside
You gotta do it, gotta do it, gotta do it like
You gotta do it like me

It's a long con, when you catch me, I'll be long gone
It's a long road and I'll be on it 'til the case goes cold
So long, when you catch me, I'll be long gone
It's a long road and I'll be on it 'til the case goes cold

I'm in the Super 8 and I've been MIA for like the past three days
My family hates me 'cause I heard the APB and I made a run for the country
I found a small town, somewhere to hide out until I'm sure that it's safe
'Cause I hid the suitcase in the crawl space and it's full of all of your money

When's the last time you saw someone with a ski mask and a gun?
Get on the inside
You gotta do it, gotta do it, gotta do it like me
When's the last time you saw someone with a ski mask and a gun?
Get on the inside
You gotta do it, gotta do it, gotta do it like me

You gotta do it, gotta do it, gotta do it like
You gotta do it like me
