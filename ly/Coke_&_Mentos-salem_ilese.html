		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You take me back to the third grade
Holding hands on a playdate, oh oh oh
Tongues tied like a shoelace
Heart beats like a horse race
Almost failed out of chem class
Only learned all the fun facts, oh oh oh
Making wine in the school lab
Getting high on the black pens

You remind me of an experiment
And I don't mean
Volcanoes or lava lamps, no

When we touch it's Coke and Mentos
Blowing up until we let go
When we touch it's Coke and Mentos
Blowing up until we let go
Blowing up, up, up, but we still won't let go

Bottled up my emotions
Till you twisted me open, oh oh oh
Took a sip of my ocean
Started dipping your toes in

Instantly reacting to your skin
One day it'll hurt to let you in
It's not the fall that kills you in the end
But we're sticking the landing

You remind me of an experiment
And I don't mean
Volcanoes or lava lamps, no

When we touch it's Coke and Mentos
Blowing up until we let go
When we touch it's Coke and Mentos
Blowing up until we let go
Blowing up up up but we still won't let go

La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Still won't let go
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh
Blowing up up up but we still won't let go
