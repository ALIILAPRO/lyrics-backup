		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ain't tryna walk like you
Feel the wind in my face
As i walk right through
I'm a cold MC
But you never gonna see
What it feel like to be
On top of my feet
Woke up in the morning
Feel like everything fine
Writing lyrics in the in deepest abyss inside of my mind
Got a problem with future that isn't
Identified
So I hop up in the whip and take that shit for a drive
On the way to the studio
Playing music that i like a movie
Oh
I been wishing for a night that i feel okay
I been looking through a screen feeling far away
Every time that i write seem to come alive
But doesn't that imply that i maybe died
I don't know but the music got me paralyzed
Looking up now the stars got of a pair of eyes
Will i make it to the the top am i terrified
I don't really want fame but respect up on my name
with a little bit of money just to clarify
Everybody want thangs but i wonder what it bring
When the currency deflate check the paradigm
Got a lot of shit to say but it never seem to stay when i look into your face
Wonder where am i
I been moving out of place
Tryna borrow time
I been moving out of
All these bitches acting they know me but they haven't seen me with they own eyes
Tell me something if i had all the money and fame would you see through your own lies
All these people wanna hear about is something bigger than them and they own lives
Sadly I've been in that position wishing that that could be me and i hope I-
Realized and learned a lesson progressing
My unprofessional integrity Stressing
I'm losing focus on the things that done matter
I quit that rapping shit I'm trying gather
My feelings up and then express on the page
I'm fantasizing what I'll get within days
I'm analyzing all these motherfuckers
That be crawling through the seams really they snakes
Kept it a hunnid but every one hunting for something you got like this shit is race
Marathon never showing my face
Carry on get and get the fuck out my face
Lyrically assassinating all the people hating wish em well then don't leave a trace
Open mic and they be hoping I'm late
Armageddon when i step on the stage
Ugh
Yeah
Bitch i been rapping
Get to the action
All these motherfuckers tripping
They don't really got a passion
They just looking for reactions
Bitches wearing high fashion
Never wanna cash in
But a homie wanna cash out
Big rims on the whip
Get the flash out
Steve Nash with the drank I'ma pass out
One hit to the dome going fast now
Big bank on the mind like a corporation
I been feeling like a king where my coronation
I been living through a dream where the correlation
Scary how this rapping ain't a thing to the boy I'm changing
Man
Having money ain't shit
But if she looking at you broke
Being funny ain't Shit
Getting intimate
I be climbing up the mountain
Looking at the increments
Tell me what's a win again
I been doing ten of them
Once upon of time i knew the devil
Was a friend of him
Tell me what's a friend again
Think i got like ten of them
Maybe if I count 'em on my fingers
I could let 'em in
Maybe i could let 'em in
People getting all up in my shit like David Letterman
Then they try to commentate
I told a motherfucker back it up
So she could Ã¡ndale
I notice that it's gone away
I'm mixing all this liquor
With my feelings
Getting stronger mane
Tick tick boom
Out the tomb
In the room
Go zoom
Write raps
Off the top
Blow up
Might soon
Mic check
My set
My shots been wet
Haven't heard about me cuz' i lost my step
Came down with a block
I'm writing this off the top
Every artist in the game been looking out for a spot
I been down on the block I'm thinking about a future
Popped off
Now my abilities feeling super
Knock off
Everybody wanna be a rapper
Everybody, Anybody, Any money
Coming to the bank
When a motherfucker
Saying he a rapper
Everybody, Anybody, Anyway
The message getting lost
When you speaking from the pride that you after
Master
I ain't gonna lie ima bastard
Faster
That's what she telling me
I'm plastered
I'm faded
Lyrically eviscerating lines
That i'm hating
