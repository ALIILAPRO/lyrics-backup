		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There are no words I have to say 
In this moment
You're asking me if I'm okay
But I need time to process
All these things that make me lose my focus 
And all these parts of me I had not noticed

Before you came 
Before you came

I know you think I'm being cold
But I can't bear to look at you today
'Cause every single time I do I fear
It might be the last time that you'll see me this way

Way 
Way

But I guess that's how we learn
By setting fire to things that bring us life 
Before we've got to watch them burn 
And so I'll say goodbye
Because I'd rather kill a good thing 
Than wait for it to die

Die 
Die

So draw your lines upon my skin 
For the very final time
And I will color all them in
And retrace them until I
Can't remember what it feels like, Like

Like
Like
