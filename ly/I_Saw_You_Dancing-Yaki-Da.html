		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you're there and you care
And you listen very careful, darling
You'll hear my prayer

And if you hear, loud and clear
You would get a million kisses from me
Somewhere, somehow

And if the night's a lonely time for you
Just listen to the words I gave to you
Let the song of ours play one more time
Somewhere, somehow
I'll be there

Went out walkin' in the morning
Standing in the pouring rain
Let it run all over me

Stayed up late last night
Tryin' to put all the things right
Then your tears roll over me

And if the night's a lonely time for you
Just listen to the words I gave to you
Let the song of ours play one more time
Somewhere somehow
I'll be there

If you're there, and you care
You'll get a million kisses from me
Somewhere, somehow

And if you feel like I feel
Love cuts the deepest part of me
Somewhere, somehow

And if the night's a lonely time for you
Just listen to the words I gave to you
Let the song of ours play one more time
Somewhere, somehow
I'll be there
