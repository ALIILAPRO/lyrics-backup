		  Ayy, supercalifragilisticexpialiexpiali-dope shit

Sippin' on the Goose, like Boosie, baby

Oops, my fault

Fuck and send her home, walk in front and might fall
I forgot the rubber, oops, livin' life raw

I just said I love her, oops, what did I say?
Now she want kids, want kids in her face, oops
Oops, my b, excuse my v
And you already know I'm finna lose my peace
Get pool like deep, get loose like leaf
Can't lose my sleep, kick up my feet like I blew my knee

And I'm happy she's a freak bitch

Walkin' with a limp like a crack ho

Hit her five times in the coupe, Mercedes, whoopsie dai-, yeah
