		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm at this party in the LA Hills, LA Hills
Dropped the chills
I'm a spaceship in the galaxy
You know what I want, yeah, you know what I need
Lucid in my mind, we're in-between
In-between, lost at sea
Can you be my captain and rescue me?
You know what I want, yeah, you know what I need

I'm at this party in the LA Hills, LA Hills
Dropped the chills
I'm a spaceship in the galaxy
You know what I want, yeah, you know what I need
Lucid in my mind, we're in-between
In-between, lost at sea
Can you be my captain and rescue me?
You know what I want, yeah, you know what I need

I'ma take my motorboat and drive it to the lake
You and I were speedin' off, keep away from fakes
You be feelin' solo, it's a no-no in my head (my head)
I will make you better, keep your demons all at bay

I'm at this party in the LA Hills
Come through, come talk to me
Give it all to me
You know what I want, you know what I need
Don't go too far from me
Life's short, get along with me
If you give me all of you
You got the rest of me

I'm at this party in the LA Hills, LA Hills
Dropped the chills
I'm a spaceship in the galaxy
You know what I want, yeah, you know what I need
Lucid in my mind, we're in-between
In-between, lost at sea
Can you be my captain and rescue me?
You know what I want, yeah, you know what I need

Baby, don't be fazed, just say you love me to my face
In the Lamborghini speedin' just to keep my mind off pain
I've been way too busy, ain't have time, don't go on dates
But time is money, so I spent enough time with you
I can't feel my face no more
I'm gone, I swear, baby, you know what I want
Amiri what I wear, Lamborghini ain't fair
Shiny Moncler and my shoes Saint Laurent
Don't act crazy, girl, it's you that I want
I ain't gon' lie, girl, it's you that I need
So hypnotized, like glue, I was stuck to you, look

I'm at this party in the LA Hills
Come through, come talk to me
Give it all to me
You know what I want, you know what I need
Don't go too far from me
Life's short, get along with me
If you give me all of you
You got the rest of me

I'm at this party in the LA Hills, LA Hills
Dropped the chills
I'm a spaceship in the galaxy
You know what I want, yeah, you know what I need
Lucid in my mind, we're in-between
In-between, lost at sea
Can you be my captain and rescue me?
You know what I want, yeah, you know what I need
