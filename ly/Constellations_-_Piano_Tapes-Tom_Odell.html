		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You sat around the table, the candle lying low
There's people all around us but they're leaving you alone
You're telling me a story, some lover that you had
Go on tell me now, tell me now, I think I'll understand

The piano man is playing some old melody
It don't mean much to anyone while it does to you and me
It's just some bitter love song that everybody's heard
I'm gonna sing it out, sing it out, sing every single word

It's the same old constellation
The stars up in the sky
Yeah, I've got a feeling
They're gonna look different tonight

Maybe I'm just crazy, maybe I'm just high
You could kiss my lips a thousand times and they would never dry
I don't know where you're going, hey, never stray too far
Cause I'll tell you now, I'll tell you now, I like you just the way you are

It's the same old constellation
The stars up in the sky
Yeah, I've got a feeling
They're gonna look different tonight

It's the same old situation
That you can have with any guy
But go on put your arms around me
It's gonna be different tonight

Caroline, Caroline, I used to act so strong
But I was just terrified, terrified, I feel it in my stumach
Call 'em butterflies, butterflies, there's something in the air tonight
They're gone, they're gone, they're gone

It's the same old constellation
The stars up in the sky
But you know I've got a feeling
They're gonna look different tonight

It's the same old conversation
You can have it anytime
Go on put your arms around me, baby
It's gonna be different tonight
