		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We ain't on the side on the side on the side on the side on the side on the side on the side no
We ain't on the side on the side on the side on the side on the side on the side on the side no
I don't rejoice seeing others getting locked off
Singled out and popped off
Treating people just because there looking different what's what
Straight from the bottom to the top to the very top
We ain't on the side no

My bro was sitting on the side line an not involved
Until I switched him in and told him go and score your goals
I'm tryna reach a couple hearts and save a couple souls
What you look like ain't the thing that really shines and flows
I show the love back to the dm's I get on my phone
Everybody needs somebody don't be on your own
This years been crazy people losing jobs and losing homes
That's why I laid this rap to go an give the people hope

We ain't on the side on the side on the side on the side on the side on the side on the side no
We ain't on the side on the side on the side on the side on the side on the side on the side no
I don't rejoice seeing others getting locked off
Singled out and popped off
Treating people just because there looking different what's what
Straight from the bottom to the top to the very top
We ain't on the side no

Catch me in my ride
With the angles by my side
It's magic when I slide
But things don't come over night
Strong hearted swear down fam I never fail
I swapped the bricks for the sticks like it's emmerdale
Strong hearted swear down fam I never fail
Man of faith but never said I was a church goer
Trusted in my technique I'm always on the blower
I've got some work for ya ah fam forgot to phone ya
Ain't leaving man on the side like some leftovers

We ain't on the side on the side on the side on the side on the side on the side on the side no
We ain't on the side on the side on the side on the side on the side on the side on the side no
I don't rejoice seeing others getting locked off
Singled out and popped off
Treating people just because there looking different what's what
Straight from the bottom to the top to the very top
We ain't on the side no
