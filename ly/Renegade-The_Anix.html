		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel a storm is on the way 
Nowhere out there to escape 
Feel the hunger inside 
Renegade eyes 
Suicide hunter 

Days go by 
Mountains bend 
Amplified  
I’ll defend 

Why don’t I know why 
I come up with nothing  
With nothing again   
Maybe I could fly away 
Float out to nowhere  
To nowhere again 

You see me grasp for something real 
Peering through the truth prevails 
You only get one try 
Renegade lies 
Cyanide thunder  

Why don’t I know why 
I come up with nothing  
With nothing again   
Maybe I could fly away 
Float out to nowhere  
To nowhere again 

Flying high 
We transcend 
Magnify 
Just pretend   
Days go by 
Mountains bend 
Amplified  
I’ll defend 

Why don’t I know why 
I come up with nothing  
With nothing again   
Maybe I could fly away 
Float out to nowhere  
To nowhere again 
 We could fly away 
We could go fly away 
We could fly away 
We could go fly away
