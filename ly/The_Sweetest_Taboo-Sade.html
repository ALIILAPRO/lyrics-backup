		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I tell you
If I tell you now
Will you keep on
Will you keep on loving me?

If I tell you
If I tell you how I feel
Will you keep bringing out the best in me?

You give me, you give me the sweetest taboo
You give me, you're giving me the sweetest taboo
Too good for me

There's a quiet storm
And it never felt like this before
There's a quiet storm
That is you

There's a quiet storm
And it never felt this hot before
Giving me something that's taboo
(Sometimes I think you're just too good for me)

You give me the sweetest taboo
That's why I'm in love with you (with you)
You give me the sweetest taboo
Too good for me
(Sometimes I think you're just too good for me)

I'd do anything for you, I'd stand out in the rain
Anything you want me to do, don't let it slip away

There's a quiet storm
And it never felt like this before
There's a quiet storm
I think it's you (ha, ha)

There's a quiet storm
And I never felt this hot before
Giving me something that's taboo

You (you give me) give me the
(You give me the) sweetest taboo
That's why I'm in love with you (with you)
You give me, keep giving me the sweetest taboo
Too good for me

You've got the biggest heart
Sometimes I think you're just too good for me
Every day is Christmas and every night is New Year's Eve

Will you keep on loving me? (Ha, ha)
Will you keep on, will you keep on?
Bringing out the best in me
