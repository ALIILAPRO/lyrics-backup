		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yup, yeah yeah
Oh, ha ha

Yup yup yup yup yup yup yup yup yup (yup)
I got enough weed to last me for the rest of my motherfuckin' life

Ain't gon' never run out
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (yeah)

Uh, get the cork out the bottle
Get that money up and make your style a lil' harder to follow
I've been hustlin' all the time, that's the only thing I know
Now my watch is worth 30 thousand, got Cuban links and Italian boy I'm gettin' it
Ridin' in my ride lookin' filthy rich
Killin' these niggas, I ain't innocent,
My bad, ain't paid the cost, see they just watch me then copy my swag
Say I fell off that's where you lost me
How's that when my name is in my upholstery
I'm rollin' up and goin' places across seas
Hopin' the neighbor don't smell the shit I bake
And every day I'm on another plane I hardly sleep, but hey I wouldn't have it any other way

Now here we are, now there we go (now there we go)
You holdin' on to where we smoke it all to'day
Now here we are, now there we go, now there we go
Now here we are (I wake up and I bake up, get my things and catch a plane but I'll be back again)
Now there we go (back again) now there we go
Now here we are (I wake up and I bake up, get my things and catch a plane but I'll be back again)
Now there we go (back again) now there we go

Uh, so much money that when I pull up
Hop out and walk in the bank teller look at me funny
Know how much I get, know I'm liable to walk up in this bitch
Like Tony with big blue bags of this shit
And tell 'em, "Count it up"
Ridin' round in that Cali' got OG kush in my body
My nigga I keep it G and that's Gucci or that Giani
I'm gettin' dressed for the airport to pose for the paparazzi huh?
Mo' money, mo' problems, not how icy huh?
Mo' money, mo' Roberto Cavalli, bruh
Damn, ain't it funny how time pass
Only nigga in first class

Now here we are, now there we go, now there we go
Now here we are, now there we go, now there we go
Now here we are (I wake up and I bake up, get my things and catch a plane but I'll be back again)
Now there we go (back again) now there we go
Now here we are (I wake up and I bake up, get my things and catch a plane but I'll be back again)
Now there we go (back again) now there we go
