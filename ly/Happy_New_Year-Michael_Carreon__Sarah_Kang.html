		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  January one again
We're bringing in the New Year
But I'm not kissing anyone this time
Ribbons and balloons again
I don't know what to do here
But drinking makes it easier to smile
Thinking of all the things we used to do
All those winter mornings and December nights
Remembering the way you used to
Countdown to one with that look in your eyes
Our hearts beating like fireworks
Every first
It's not the same without you here
So today I fake a Happy New Year
Told myself I won't regret
But it's too late to return to
Back to when I thought you were mine
So I'll turn over the hourglass
Hope for something brand new
But let me reminisce one last time
Thinking of all the things we used to do
All those winter mornings and December nights
Remembering the way you used to
Countdown to one with that look in your eyes
Our hearts beating like fireworks
Every first
It's not the same without you here
So today I fake a Happy New Year
It will always be you
But I know you've given up
Whatever you do don't call me
Cause I just might pick it up
And they're yelling out the numbers now
And I can't help but wonder how
You are
From afar
Thinking of all the things we used to do
All those winter mornings and December nights
Remembering the way you used to
Countdown to one with that look in your eyes
Our hearts beating like fireworks
Every first
It's not the same without you here
So today I fake a Happy New Year
