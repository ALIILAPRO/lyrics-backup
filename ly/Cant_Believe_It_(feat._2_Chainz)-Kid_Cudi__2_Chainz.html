		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (La-la-la) yeah
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la) it is like combing two worlds
So that shit hard
It's time for that though (yeah)
Deuce and Cudi (yeah, nigga)
Uh-uh
Yeah
Yeah
Uh-uh

Can't believe it, baby
No, you can't believe it, baby
Ridin' through the city and I'm coasting
Bitch, get off me (bitch, get off me)
Can't believe it, baby
No, you can't believe it, baby
Ridin' through the city and I'm coasting
Bitch, get off me (bitch, get off me)

Can't believe it, baby
No, you can't believe it, baby
Ridin' through the city and I'm coasting
Bitch, get off me (bitch, get off me)
Can't believe it, baby
No, you can't believe it, baby
Ridin' through the city and I'm coasting, yeah

Gettin' lost in the rhythm of the fuckin' flight
When the city lights shine and the mood is right
When you sippin' ain't no trippin' on the move tonight
Bring out the whole team, I'm on Lysergic and it's worth it (yeah)
I admit in the zone, Mr. Rager Man
Seen him in the streets, I'm takin' off, make 'em understand
In my world, the view swerve, never lookin' back
42 I do ok, I knew you couldn't hold me, Jack
And it's on, bigger bank, time to get it now
Ben Baller did the chain, rosey goldie, homie, learn the name
Livin through the soul, if you didn't know, learn the facts
Now I super glow, we'll see a show, where the broken at

Can't believe it, baby
No, you can't believe it, baby
Ridin' through the city and I'm coasting
Bitch, get off me (bitch, get off me)
Can't believe it, baby
No, you can't believe it, baby
Ridin' through the city and I'm coasting
Bitch, get off me (bitch, get off me)

Can't believe it, baby
No, you can't believe it, baby
Ridin' through the city and I'm coasting
Bitch, get off me (bitch, get off me)
Can't believe it, baby
No, you can't believe it, baby (yeah)
Ridin' through the city and I'm coasting, yeah (uh)

2 Chainz, it ain't a stain on me (alright)
DEA had tried to put the blame on me
My young niggas tote 30's ain't no, aim on it (yeah)
And this a Cullinan, bitch, not a Range Rover, yeah
What's the difference? 'bout three hundred racks (three hundred)
I am so cold, it look like Freon attack (sheesh)
Had the bando with the P's in the back
But the odd part about it, we was evenly matched, yeah
I been coastin' since a Motorola
Chicken toter, I sold more than El Pollo Loco (damn)
Emotions up and down like a roller coaster
I put her sexy ass on the pole like wanted posters, yeah

Can't believe it, baby
No, you can't believe it, baby
Ridin' through the city and I'm coasting
Bitch, get off me (bitch, get off me) (alright)
Can't believe it, baby
No, you can't believe it, baby (can't believe it)
Ridin' through the city and I'm coasting
Bitch, get off me (bitch, get off me) (and I'm coasting)

Can't believe it, baby
No, you can't believe it, baby (can't believe it, uh)
Ridin' through the city and I'm coasting 
Bitch, get off me (bitch, get off me)
Can't believe it, baby
No, you can't believe it, baby
Ridin' through the city and I'm coasting, yeah (alright, uh)
