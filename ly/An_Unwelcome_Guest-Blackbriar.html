		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, terrifying visitor
You're giving me the ongoing sensation
Of being a sleep paralysis prisoner
With gruesome hallucinations
But it's the middle of the day
And I am wide awake
Oh, petrifying visitor
Your weight is starting to ache

Oh, there's a goblin sitting on my chest
An unwelcome guest that never left
Oh, there's a goblin sitting on my chest
Taking away my breath

Oh, mischievous creature
Staring me in the eyes
Do you enjoy my struggle?
The fear I feel inside?
To others, you remain unseen
While I'm stuck in the in-between
An endless state of hypnagogia
A dream where I cannot scream

Oh, there's a goblin sitting on my chest
An unwelcome guest that never left
Oh, there's a goblin sitting on my chest
Taking away my breath

All the things that I would do
And all the places I would go
Without this burden weighing on my torso
All the things that I would do
And all the places I would go
Without this burden weighing on my torso

Oh, there's a goblin sitting on my chest
An unwelcome guest that never left
Oh, there's a goblin sitting on my chest
That's taking away my breath
