		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Tezzer, T-Tezzer (ayy, ayy, ayy, yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Yeah, we got beans (ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Yeah, ayy, ayy

You ain't never had the feds investigate you ('gate you)
You ain't never had the bad hoes wanna date you (date you)
You a bad bitch, daddy gotta spank you (I'ma spank you)
My nigga fresh out the pen, he might shank you
Extendo, I don't rock with no stock clips (grr)
If you chillin' with the opps you gettin' shot with (ayy)
Bad hoes love a nigga out in Stockton
They let my shorty in the party with a Glock .10
Poppin', yeah, bitch, I'm so poppin' (baow)
I got pounds, I got keys, is you shoppin'?
I sip lean, not no green, ain't no Watson
I'ma fuck your life up 'cause I'm toxic (ayy)
Want her, fuck her, hit her, duck her (ayy)
Catch up lil' nigga with mustard (skrrt, skrrt)
What up, bitch? Geesy fuckin' up the summer (woah)
Sad hoes lookin' like what a bummer
She wanna suck my dick 'cause I'm funner
Niggas lame, all he wanna do is love her
Buster, we be fuckin' under covers (under cover)
But we ain't never fuck with an undercover
Feds watch, lil' nigga, yeah, the feds listenin'
I just popped a Perc' 20, now my head spinnin' (woah)
You ain't never touched no money, you ain't bread winnin' (no)
I don't even wanna fuck, I'm just head gettin', ayy

What up my nigga, Geesy?

Ayy, huh, your bitch the breadwinner
Broke ass bum, better cool it down like September (broke ass nigga)
I feel like Melly, I ride around with dead niggas (dead niggas)
Nah, I feel like Michael Jackson how my hand glistenin' (ayy)
Bitch wan' try suck no dick, I'm on a next mission (nah)
If we got the right to bear arms, then I'm Ted, nigga (ayy, you hear me?)
Diamonds two-step (ayy), say, that's a cool necklace
What a rude heifer, dirty shoes all on my new leather
Feel like Hugh Heffner, difference is, bitch can't stay here, huh
He got hit with that Drac', hope he take care (take care)
My dawg still sellin' tight white but not the Hanes pair
I don't want no smoke with these niggas 'cause I don't play fair
Ayy, nigga cappin' like he steppin'
Got attachments like I'm pressure, fill his chest up like a treasure (ayy, ayy, ayy)
My bitch milkin' 'til the sun come up, she ain't a parent
Bugs Bunny, you gon' say, "What's up, Doc'?" Reach for these karats, nigga (baow, baow)
I just bought another chop', I don't play those games (uh-uh)
Just so I can leave a nigga like Taylor Gang
Good bread off this sauce like Raising Cane's (you hear me?)
I got neck on the spot, I ain't catch her name (ayy)
You think you can fuck with me? Bet your life on it
Huh, hit a bitch and I ain't carin', I'm not a white woman (ayy)
Big Cuban, ice on it, nigga, come and try somethin' (you won't)
He took a hundred from the k, bitch, that's nine hundred, ayy
