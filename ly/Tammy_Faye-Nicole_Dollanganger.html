		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know how I get with my Tammy Faye eyes
Crying, I'm a mess
Half undressed in the light of the TV

You know you'll just have to go bury this
In the garden and leave it
Till there's nothing left
For me to find, when I try to dig it up
And bring it back to life

'Cause you know how I get
I love you so madly like Sadie Mae
But I'm just a crazy bitch
Crying in the kitchen to Tammy Wynette
(Tammy Wynette)
Crying in the kitchen to Tammy Wynette

But it's just how I get
With my Tammy Faye eyes
Blood on my clothes and my hands
I've done it again, I've done it again

You know you'll just have to go bury this
In the garden and leave it
Till there's nothing left
For me to find, when I try to dig it up
And bring it back to life

'Cause you know how I get
I love you so madly like Sadie Mae
But I'm just a crazy bitch
Crying in the kitchen to Tammy Wynette
(Tammy Wynette)

'Cause I shoot the gun any chance I get
(Sadie Mae)
With blood on my clothes and my hands
I've done it again, I've done it again
