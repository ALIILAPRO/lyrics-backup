		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a thousand stars that I could chase 
c million hours I could waste 
To wind up somewhere I don't wanna be

There's a house on a mile high mountain
The kinda money that you just quit countin'
That kinda thing don't do a thing for me

I should be climbing that ladder to the top 
Should be pushing that limit non-stop 
Wringing every last second out the clock 
Overtime 
But there's a train I need to catch 
There's a fire that needs a match 
There's a girl I need to sing to sleep tonight

There's a sweet sound runnin' round my head
Like a heartbeat in your chest 
Calling me with a long, lonesome sound

I'll be steel wheels spinning and a sparkin'
Kerosene lantern just a running through the darkness 
Park this heart right where your heart is and slow on down

I should be climbing that ladder to the top 
Should be pushing that limit non-stop 
Wringing every last second out the clock 
Overtime 
But there's a train I need to catch 
There's a fire that needs a match 
There's a girl I need to sing to sleep tonight

You are waiting
I'm anticipating
Holding, feelin'
Every breath you're breathing

I should be climbing that ladder to the top 
Should be pushing that limit non-stop 
Wringing every last second out the clock 
Overtime 
But there's a train I need to catch 
There's a fire that needs a match 
There's a girl I need to sing to sleep tonight
Sing to sleep tonight
Sing to sleep tonight
There's a girl I need to sing to sleep tonight
