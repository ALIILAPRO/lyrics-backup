		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If the day comes that you must leave
Let me be the ground to your feet
If the day comes that you feel weak
Let me be the armor you need
Oh, if you falling in love is a crime
And the price to pay is my life
Give me sword, bring all the knives
Hand me the gun, I will not run
And when they spare everything but my pride
Don't you worry, boy, don't you cry
But when they ask, who was the one
Who got you love
Let it be me

If you ever made your last breath
Let me be the last word you say
And if right comes, but you choose left
I will be the first to forgive
Oh if heaven is a beautiful place
But those gates don't have enough space
And they lock you out, spare you no flame
I will come down, if they're on my wings
And when the angels call me a fool
For giving all grace up for you
I won't look back
But when they ask, who did you love
Let it be me

Let it be me that you think of
When everything tells you to give it up
Let it be me that will anchor your soul
Until the clouds fall out of the sky
And the snow falls down in July
Let it be me, that you think of
Let it be, the one that you love
Until the flowers don't blow in May
And forever runs out of days
Let it be me, let it be me
The one that you love

Let it be me
Let it be me

Let it be me, let it be me
Let it be me, let it be me
Oh let it be me
