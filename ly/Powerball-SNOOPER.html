		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Powerball 
Everybody wants to win it all 
 
Quick pick
Turn me into a lunatic 
 
Jackpot 
Tv told me its a lot 
 
Fast cash 
Nuff to toss right in the trash
 
If I don't win
I'll try again 
Put to the test 
People's unrest 
Tune in to see powerball 
Guess I'm left with nothing at all
 
Advertized 
Makes you think you'll win the prize 
 
Jackpot 
I really hope I've got a shot 
 
Funny game 
Hope it doesn't bring me shame 
 
Powerplay 
I think I'll have to move away 
 
If I don't win 
I'll try again
Put to the test 
People's unrest 
Tune in to see powerball 
I'm still stuck with nothing at all
