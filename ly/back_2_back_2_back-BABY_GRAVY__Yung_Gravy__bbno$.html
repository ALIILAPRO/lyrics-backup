		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Break you like a KitKat, where's my money?
I'ma make you disappear like Cat in the Hat
You a pussy boy, we goin' bar for bar like back-to-back (facts)
Back-to-back, wait, bring that back
Back-to-back, back-to-back, back-to-back
Back-to-back, droppin' hits-on-hits, huh
Back-to-back, back-to-back, back-to-back
Yeah, back-to-back
Back-to-back, droppin' hits on hits, yeah, back-to-back

This ain't just an act, I'm Tom Hanks
You can find me running around these slowpokes
All I ever do is send it, I'm a UPS post
I don't drink too much
But I'ma have to pop it just to toast
Send a sayonara to these hoes, I gotta get to my bros
As above, so below
I'ma flex forever, Soulja Boy, Super Soak, like
You a stupid little ho
Need some head, keep the shoulders, knees, and toes

Break you like a KitKat, where's my money?
I'ma make you disappear like Cat in the Hat
You a pussy boy, we goin' bar for bar like back-to-back (facts)
Back-to-back, wait, bring that back
Back-to-back, back-to-back, back-to-back
Back-to-back, droppin' hits-on-hits, huh
Back-to-back, back-to-back, back-to-back
Yeah, back-to-back
Back-to-back, droppin' hits on hits, yeah, back-to-back

Pull up with some 10's, got a plethora
Shelly, Suzie, Deborah
Sheri, Sally, Sharon, etcetera
You should check your retinas
Shittin' on you, enemas
She itching for some dick and now I'm thinkin' she got eczema
Stack it up, suck me up, Count Dracula
Shake, and bake, and shack it up
Home run if she bad enough like, batter up
Now, one, two, three, four, five, six bags I add it up (skrrt-skrrt)
You really think that Baby Gravy got the time of day to even give a fuck?
Damn, baby, this a stick-up
You can see the bands in my pants like my dick up
Run that back, damn
See it then I cop it (cop it)
We've been going back to-back to-back
Never stop it

Break you like a KitKat, where's my money?
I'ma make you disappear like Cat in the Hat
You a pussy boy, we goin' bar for bar like back-to-back (facts)
Back-to-back, wait, bring that back
Back-to-back, back-to-back, back-to-back
Back-to-back, droppin' hits-on-hits, huh
Back-to-back, back-to-back, back-to-back
Yeah, back-to-back
Back-to-back, droppin' hits on hits, yeah, back-to-back

Back-to-back, back-to-back, back-to-back
Back-to-back, droppin' hits-on-hits, huh
Back-to-back, back-to-back, back-to-back
Yeah, back-to-back
Back-to-back, droppin' hits on hits, yeah, back-to-back
