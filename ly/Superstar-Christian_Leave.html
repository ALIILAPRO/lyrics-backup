		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uncle Christian, I love it!

I'll never be the one
I'll never be the thing they're drawn to
Always just a face
Always just an etch people know through you

It's fine
I really don't mind
It saves me time

Standing with the brightest thing the rest of us have ever seen
You are

Supersta-a-a-a-ar, a-a-a-a-ar, a-a-a-a-ar, oh, oh

I'm picking up your trends
And catching all the cards that are blowing in the wind
It's tough to be your friend
It's tough to know the phases and changes you're in

But it's fine
I really don't mind
It saves me time

Standing with the brightest thing the rest of us could never be
You are

Supersta-a-a-a-ar, a-a-a-a-ar, a-a-a-a-ar, oh, oh, ooh
