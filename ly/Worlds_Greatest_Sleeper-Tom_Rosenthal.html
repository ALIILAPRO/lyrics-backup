		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Road won't need another car to get in all your ways
Train don't need another body pressed against your pains
Plane don't need another flyer on their way to Spain

Someday I'll grow up

Manager don't need another project to review
Hill don't need another climber clogging up the view
Morning won't need my footsteps upon the milky dew

Someday I'll grow-up and be
The world's greatest sleeper
Bye-bye big dreamer
Hello staying home
I'm bumbling along

Bum-bumbling along
I'm bumbling
Bum-bumbling along
I'm bumbling

Shops won't need another shopper slowing up the queue
Cops don't need another suspect adding to their clues
Lovers won't need other loves they've already got you

Someday I'll grow-up and be
The world's greatest sleeper
Bye-bye big dreamer
Hello staying home
I'm bumbling along

Bum-bumbling along
I'm bumbling
Bum-bumbling along
I'm bumbling

Post office won't need another letter to nowhere
Church won't need another goer on their way to prayer
Day don't need another circle trying to be a square

Someday I'll grow-up and be
The world's greatest sleeper
Bye-bye big dreamer
Hello staying home

I'm bumbling along
Bum-bumbling along
I'm bumbling
Bum-bumbling along
I'm bumbling along
