		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes sorrow is the door to peace
Sometimes heartache is the gift I need
You're faithful, faithful
In all things

In every high, in every low
On mountain tops, down broken roads
You're still my rock, my hope remains
I'll rest in the arms of Jesus

Come what may
Come what may

There is deep joy that You give to me
Where hurt meets the healing is a Holy thing
I see goodness, Your goodness
In all things, yeah

In every high, in every low
On mountain tops, down broken roads
You're still my rock, my hope remains
I'll rest in the arms of Jesus

Come what may
Come what may
Come what may

The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want
He makes me lie down in green pastures
The Lord is my shepherd, leads me to still waters
And He restores my soul (and He restores my soul)
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want
He makes me lie down in green pastures (yes, He does, yes, He does)
The Lord is my shepherd, leads me to still waters
And He restores my soul

In every high, in every low
On mountain tops, down broken roads
You're still my rock, my hope remains
I'll rest in the arms of Jesus
In every high, in every low
On mountain tops, down broken roads
You're still my rock, my hope remains
I'll rest in the arms of Jesus

Come what may
Come what may
Come what may
Come what may
Come what may
Come what may
