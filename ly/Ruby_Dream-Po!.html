		  Dream Ruby Dream
Under the melon tree
Mummy's pinning all her hopes on you
Anyone can see
You're a prodigy
Peace and comfort smiling down on you

The thing she always wanted vanished with her luck
She's got an occupation
Mummy now and Granny when you

Dream Ruby Dream
Under the wishing tree
Take a look at Ruby history
Babies come for free
A teenage shopping spree
Patterns keep repeating can't you see

The thing she always wanted vanished with her luck
She's got an occupation
Mummy now and Granny when you

The thing she always wanted vanished with her luck
She's got an occupation
Mummy now and 

Dream Ruby Dream
Under the weeping tree
You can cry for anything you need
Underneath the frills
The pastel pink and glee
Your blood is full of nicotine and speed
Dream Ruby Dream
Dream Ruby Dream
Dream Ruby Dream
Dream Ruby Dream
