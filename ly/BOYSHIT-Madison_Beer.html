		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm lettin' you in, you're lettin' me down
I swear when you talk you just like the sound
One too many times I let you ruin my life 'cause
I thought you would change but I see it now

All the yellin' and kissin' and fightin'
We never could see eye to eye
'Cause you must seem like a man but you're not one in your mind
Yeah, I'm back on my shit and it's temptin'
To call you and see how you're doin'
But I couldn't understand you if I tried

I don't speak boyshit
You're always coming back but your love's poison
So I think that I would rather just avoid it
I can't understand you 'cause I don't speak boy, no
I don't speak, I don't speak, I don't speak boyshit

Don't know how to talk or communicate
We're so on and off, to you it's a game
If you don't level up I'm leavin' you in the dust, yeah
So I'm movin' on until you start tryna act your age, yeah

'Cause I don't speak boyshit
You're always coming back but your love's poison
So I think that I would rather just avoid it
I can't understand you 'cause I don't speak boy, no
I don't speak, I don't speak, I don't speak

All the yellin' and kissin' and fightin'
We never could see eye to eye, yeah
You must seem like a man but you're not one in your mind
Yeah, I'm back on my shit and it's temptin'
To call you and see how you're doin'
But I couldn't understand you if I tried

'Cause I don't speak boyshit (shit, shit, shit)
Boyshit (shit, shit, shit)
'Cause I don't speak boy, no
Boyshit (shit, shit, shit)

'Cause I don't speak boyshit
Still tryna get through to you, it's pointless
You might have a way with words but I'm a woman
I can't understand you 'cause I don't speak boy, no
I don't speak, I don't speak, I don't speak boyshit

I don't speak boyshit
I don't speak boyshit
'Cause I don't speak boy, no
I don't speak, I don't speak, I don't speak boyshit
