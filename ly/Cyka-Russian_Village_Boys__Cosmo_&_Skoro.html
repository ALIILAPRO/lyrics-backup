		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wake up from my bass 
Take your shoes, go to place
With my favor face 2 face 
Go away we need more space

I like dance on the ground
From my car ебашит sound
Get fucking out of me
I have gun it’s killing spree 

Cyka!
What did u say?
Cyka!
What did u say?
Cyka!
What did u say?
I don’t like you.

Cyka!
What did u say?
Cyka!
What did u say?
Cyka!
What did u say?
I said fuck you!

Middle fingers up
Russians go hard
I believe in my god
God make slav squat

Run паца run
Cuz im already done 
Run паца run
Wtf with you, man

Vodka shot, whiskey shot
Oh this baby is so hot 
Vodka shot, whiskey shot
I will show you my cumshot

Cyka!
What did u say?
Cyka!
What did u say?
Cyka!
What did u say?
I don’t like you.


Cyka!
What did u say?
Cyka!
What did u say?
Cyka!
What did u say?
I said fuck you!

Middle fingers up
Russians go hard
I believe in my god
God make slav squat

You can run you can run
Cuz I’m already done
You can run you can run 
Wtf with you man 
You can run you can run
Cuz I’m already done
You can run you can run 
Wtf with you man
You can run you can run
Cuz I’m already done
You can run you can run 
Wtf with you man
You can run you can run
Cuz I’m already done
You can run you can run 
Wtf with you man (cyka!)
