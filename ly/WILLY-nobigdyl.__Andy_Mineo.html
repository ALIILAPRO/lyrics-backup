		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  God made me fresh carvello
Yeah, 931, 615, yeah

Lil Dyllie from the bottom of the map
I ain't gotta have the strap
I still get 'em with the rap
Hatin' Dyllie, man
You gotta be an idiot in fact
Took the monkey off then I put
The city on my back, Yeah
(I put the city)
Country boy, but I hang around city slickers
"This that shh ", well
I got it out the kitty litter
If my brother need a dollar
He gon' get a tenner
Yeshua of Nazareth was not a penny pincher
How you got it out the
Mud and never been mudding?
Wise man know he don't really know nothing
(He don't really know) every night I got a
Demon saying post somethin'
(Post somethin')
It's a everyday struggle like
I'm Joe Budden (Yeah)
I said peace to the industry, I do it alone
I'm a beast, you is Swisher Sweet
You don't want the smoke (No)
You a tweet, I'm reality, Paris and Nicole
I know arrogance can feel like
Heroin inside a dome
It's imperative to get embarrassed when
You hit a low
When the heritage that I inherited
Is all I know
I'm not American, my momma surrogate
If you got ears you can hear
Then when He appear again I'm goin' home

Get jiggy wit' it (Get jiggy)
Get it jumpin' like I knew Ms piggy wit' it
(Ms piggy)
Make the family proud like it had Penny in it
(True dat) bulletproof vest on the chest
Like 50 wit' it (Ah yeah)
You tryna flex on me, don't be silly
(Don't)
Wild wild west and, yes, I'm big Willy (Yes)
Dressed like I came here
Fresh from West Philly (Will)
Who gon' protect your neck? Inspectah Deck
(Hey)

God made me do it, God made me fresh
(Yeah, He did)
When they tell me no I hear maybe yes
(Wait for it)
Thought I'm playin' checkers man
I'm playin' chess
My baby said let's have a baby
I said baby steps
Look, big Willy, big Dyllie, uh
The fresh prince like I'm in Philly, uh
Said they shooters, but they Ben Simmons
The pen silly, I talk like I got ten milli'
In my pocket right now
You can't tell me nothing (Man)
Man, I'm doin' what I want
It isn't for discussion (Not at all)
If it's number one spots then you
Know I'm gunnin' for it
Independent artists gotta have the pocket
And the stomach for it (Stomach for it)
I already know what you want (I already know)
I don't wanna hear you rappin'
In your new song (Not at all)
Rather take a street food tour through Wuhan
'Cause y'all about as solid as udon
Who want what?
My jewels untucked, my mood unstuck
My barbershop ain't open so I'm too uncut
(Too uncut)
I thank God with two arms up, I moved on up
And still ain't got nothin' left
To prove, what's up, Ayy

Get jiggy wit' it (Get jiggy wit' it)
Get it jumpin' like I knew Ms piggy wit' it
(Ms piggy)
Make the family proud like it had Penny in it
Bulletproof vest on the chest
Like 50 wit' it (Ah yeah)
Yeah, you tryna flex on me, don't be silly
(Don't)
Wild wild west and, yes, I'm big Willy
(Will) dressed like I came here
Fresh from West Philly
(Will, nah, nah, nah, nah)
Who gon' protect your neck? Inspectah Deck
(Nah, nah, nah, nah)
