		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for

Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven

There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

Ooh, that makes me wonder
Ooh, it makes me wonder

There's a feelin' I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leavin'
In my thoughts I have seen, rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand lookin'

Ooh, that makes me wonder
Oh yeah

And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And the new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

Your head is hummin' and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know?
Your stairway lies on the whisperin' wind

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show

How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll

And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
