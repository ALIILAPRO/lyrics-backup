		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me somewhere, all I want is you
I need you to listen
Take me somewhere, all I want is you (Great John on the beat, by the way)
I need you to listen 

Look, please don't make me drill a nigga
Get up out your feelings, nigga
Glock up on me, chillin' with it
But I could be a villain with it
Feelin' like they can't run a mile or walk in my shoes
Feelin' like they can't run a mile or walk in my shoes

Look, huh, yeah, them niggas snaked me
Reason why I don't trust nobody
I could feel the envy
Please don't make me catch a body, huh
My heart on freeze, and my
My watch on freeze, and I put my feelings on freeze
But I think about you and me, huh
Think about you and me, she could trip and up and leave
But she still gon' think of me
I don't really no need love
No love, bitch, I'm not fertile
Really trust no love, huh 
That shit gon' run and hurt you, look

Take me somewhere, all I want is you
I need you to listen
Take me somewhere, all I want is you
I need you to listen

Look, please don't make me drill a nigga
Get up out your feelings, nigga
Glock up on me, chillin' with it
But I could be a villain with it
Feelin' like they can't run a mile or walk in my shoes
Feelin' like they can't run a mile or walk in my shoes, look

Take me somewhere, all I want is you
I need you to listen
Take me somewhere, all I want is you
I need you to listen
