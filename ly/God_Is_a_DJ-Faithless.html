		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is my church
This is where I heal my hurts
It's in natural grace
Or watching young life shape
It's in minor keys
Solutions and remedies
Enemies becoming friends
When bitterness ends
This is my church
This is my church
This is my church

This is my church
This is where I heal my hurts
It's in the world I've become
Contained in the hum
Between voice and drum
It's in the change
The poetic justice of cause and effect
Respect, love, compassion

This is my church
This is where I heal my hurts
For tonight
God is a DJ
For tonight
God is a DJ
This is my church
