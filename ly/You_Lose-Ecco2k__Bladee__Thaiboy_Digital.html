		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As long as you lose, that's all on you
I've got to tell the truth, I break the rules
Do what I've got to do, I had to (huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh)
(Huh, huh, huh, huh) I'll break the rules
(Huh, huh, huh, huh) I'll break the rules
(Huh, huh, huh, huh) I gotta do
(Huh, huh, huh, huh) I'll break the rules
(Huh, huh, huh, huh) it's all on you
(Huh, huh, huh, huh) it's all on you
(Huh, huh, huh, huh) I break the rules
If you lose, that's all on you (huh, huh, huh)
Break the rules, I've got to tell the truth (huh, huh, huh)
If you lose that's all on you (huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh)
Gotta do it

Beauty's thin when you're in
When you walk through the ring
Had to sin just to win
Had to fly with the wings
Plead the guilt for the kill
For a touch of the skin
Feels so close, like an inch
Feels like needles and pins

If you lose, that's all on you (huh, huh, huh)
I break the rules, I've gotta tell the truth (huh, huh, huh)
If you lose, that's all on you (huh, huh, huh, huh, huh)
Gotta do it (ha)
If you lose that's all on you (huh, huh, huh)
Break the rules, I've got to tell the truth (huh, huh, huh)
If you lose that's all on you (huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh)
Gotta do it (ha)

Will, will you do it too?
Will you do it too?
Will you do it too?
Will you do it too?

(Will, will you do it too?)
(Will you do it too?)
(Will you do it too?)
(Will you do it too?)
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
Huh, huh, huh, huh
