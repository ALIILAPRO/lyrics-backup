		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm sinking underwater now
You've got me clinging at the shore
Your waves just pull me closer now
A crashing tide I can't ignore

No, I won't keep my distance
'Cause I'm closer than ever before
And I won't show resistance
'Cause I'm closer than ever before

I could be everything you want and more
I could be everything you want and more

I know you're leaving in the morning
But if tomorrow never comes
Could you let me down easy
And say that I'm the only one?
I know you're leaving in the morning
But if tomorrow never comes
Could you let me down easy and lie
Say that I'm the only, I'm the only one?

The rush against my skin is cold
You've got me locked inside your love
I know that this is meaningless
I let the water fill my lungs

No, I won't keep my distance
'Cause I'm closer than ever before
And I won't show resistance
'Cause I'm closer than ever before

I know you're leaving in the morning
But if tomorrow never comes
Could you let me down easy
And say that I'm the only one?
I know you're leaving in the morning
But if tomorrow never comes
Could you let me down easy and lie
Say that I'm the only, I'm the only one?

I know you're leaving in the morning
But if tomorrow never comes
Could you let me down easy
And say that I'm the only one?
I know you're leaving in the morning
But if tomorrow never comes
Could you let me down easy and lie?
Say that I'm the only one
