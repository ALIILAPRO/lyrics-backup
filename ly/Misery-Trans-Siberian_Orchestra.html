		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There is a child and she sleeps in the gutter
Don't close your eyes and she's easy to see
She is not your child
She's always another's
And those you abandon
They are left to me

And know I will impale her like a knife
Leave her twisting day after day after day of a very short life with me

Listen now closely and hear how I've planned it
Please let me tell you just how it will be

She'll feel the pain but she won't understand it
She'll think it's her fate
But we'll know it's me

And know I will impale her like a knife
Leave her twisting day after day after day of a very short life
With me

So let me know
Have I been clear
That I will magnify each cut and every bruise and every single childhood tear

I'll pick her scabs
Cripple a hand
Push a finger in each wound I make
Now tell me then

Do you understand
You understand?
You understand
You understand?
You understand

And know I will impale her like a knife
Leave her twisting day after day after day of a very short life
With me
