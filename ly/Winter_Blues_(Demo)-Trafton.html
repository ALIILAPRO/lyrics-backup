		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heart beat slow ‘cause the whole thing hurts

Already know, we don’t need no words

Your mind glows, I can see it work

Deep in the dark as the light snow flurries

My body warm, your vision blurry

You want more, baby don’t you worry


I am here to stay, to chase your winter blues away

and paint you a new shade like in the sky above LA

You can take my face, not all those pills that I replace

‘cause I’m your holiday, I’ll chase your winter blues away


Stay up late when your thoughts start running

Sleep all day but the tears keep coming

It’s ok baby, cry cry cry it out

Gray and cold but that smile’s so sunny

I’m gonna hold you ‘til you’re happy

I’m so glad to have you have me

And baby


I am here to stay, to chase your winter blues away

and paint you a new shade like in the sky above LA

You can take my face, not all those pills that I replace

‘cause I’m your holiday, I’ll chase your winter blues away


I am here to stay, to chase your winter blues away

and paint you a different shade like in the sky above LA

You can take my face, not all those pills that I replace

‘cause I’m your holiday, I’ll chase your winter blues away


Thought it was the cold, but maybe I’m the one to blame

If I leave you alone, I’ll need those pills to take your place

Guess that I was wrong; turns out it’s me who needs you, baby

‘cause you’re my holiday, you chase my winter blues away
