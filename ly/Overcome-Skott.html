		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll overcome

Silent songs I'll be humming on

'til you sing along

Come as you are, ignited

Some lights are a different kind
Never burning out

Darkness and dust

Quiet shadows are dancing now
Asking for my hand



I'm hanging on fine

I'm trying to make sense of it all
Trying to understand

Do you ever wonder what it's like
Losing what you cannot be without
I will keep running



I try
I'll overcome



Fading stars echo

Reminding us they know
We've come too far to let go

Don't let go
