		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Darling, I've gotta talk to you
About the things you've been putting me through
I've gotta talk to you
I've gotta be explained to

Feelings, they're really burning now
They're burning higher than they've ever done before
I need to talk to you, I need to feel it deeply
You're actions now, they're really driving me
Driving me into a deep bed of insanity
You need to talk to me
You need to feel it deeply

Don't be afraid to say it
Don't be afraid to say it
The words that you might tell me
Could never hurt me oh no

I've gotta feel it, I've gotta feel it
I've gotta feel it deeply, deeply now
I've gotta feel it, I've gotta feel it
And the words come tumbling from me


Feelings, they're really burning now
They're burning higher than they've ever done before
I need to talk to you, I need to feel it deeply
Sometime now you gotta come round
To the way that I been feeling about you now
I gotta talk to you, I gotta be explained to

Don't be afraid to say it
Don't be afraid to say it
The words that you might tell me
Could never hurt me oh no

I've gotta feel it, I've gotta feel it
I've gotta feel it deeply, deeply boy
I've gotta feel it, I've gotta feel it
And the words come tumbling from me


Don't be afraid to say it
Don't be afraid to say it
The words that you might tell me
Could never hurt me oh no

I've gotta feel it, I've gotta feel it
I've gotta feel it deeply, deeply now
I've gotta feel it, I've gotta feel it
And the words come tumbling from me
