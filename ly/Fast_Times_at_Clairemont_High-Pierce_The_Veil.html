		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been saving myself for you
I've been saving myself for you
I waited my whole life for you
I've been saving myself for you

Tonight we'll be throwing a party
Under the sunset we started to drink
A little faster now! 
This celebration so many faces
I say the words as the moon painted us blue

I've been saving myself for you
I've been saving myself for you
I waited my whole life for you
'Cause I was saving myself for you

(Now brother bring that beat back)

Now hold on, this is innocent blood,
All the beach boys look like sharks
Because without you nothing ever mattered
I scream and wave my arms but you don't understand me
Now as I watch the feed on you, it's over
If I die, you die too

Because I'm saving myself for you 
I've been saving myself for you 
I waited my whole life for you 
'Cause I was saving myself for you
I just wanted one dance with you
Under the smoke alarm

Every single door in this house is on fire!

So melodramatic but it turns me on
I close my eyes it feels just like a movie
I'm convinced that we don't make sense,
But I'd kill anyone who gets close

I've been saving myself for you
Ive been saving myself for you
The sharpest thing I find for you
'Cause I was saving myself for you
Ive been saving myself for you
I saved myself for you
Don't you know I'd die for you?
I saved myself for you
(Without you whats the point?)
