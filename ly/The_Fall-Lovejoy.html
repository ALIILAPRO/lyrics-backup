		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Under the weight of a broken nose
It's not that simple, but he won't seem to notice
There must be more to this

So leave those sink estates and
Let's book a holiday
We're painting all the counties in blue
'Cause we're already boring
And we're already hoarding
What else have we got left to accrue?

And the ramblers will say
"It's got a marvelous view"
But they don't know how many lives it took, no
They'll never know what you knew

And we're so calm but we're (fucking scared, fucking scared)
And we're so calm but we're (fucking scared, fucking scared)
And we're so calm but we're (fucking scared, fucking scared)
And we're so calm but we're fucking scared of people like you

Under the weight of some Sertraline
A couple Prozacs, and now I'm pumping dopamine
There must be more to this
We've got a country house now
Old dog has been put down now
It's nice to be around trees
Custom license plate
On our Audi R8
How many grocers does one county need?

And the ramblers will say
"It's still a marvelous view"
That treadmill still looms
Your hedonic misuse

So come on, one and all to see the apathy
The reams of gray stencils that fill the tapestry
I look to all of you and see a different fucking species
Aspiration for a different destination to me
Across the Pennines, there's a thin blue line, a knife and a mall
I would do something, if it wasn't all so effortful
'Cause I'm so high, my brain can't even look at the fall
And when you've reached the top there's nowhere else to go but-

(Hah)
