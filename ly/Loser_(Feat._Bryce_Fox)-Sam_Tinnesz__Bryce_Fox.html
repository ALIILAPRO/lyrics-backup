		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’m getting really sick of the pretend
This plastic fruit just fits right in
Peer pressure giving me the spins
Gorilla suit but Im a chimp

I'm way too old for this
Keeping up with the socials masokist
You don’t even know what anxious is
I know it’s hard to imagine

I’d rather be a loser
Than be just like you
Tell me when’d you get so cool
I’d rather be a loser
Than be just like you
I don’t need a spot in your crew
There’s a party upside inside my head
With these invisible friends
I'm having the time of my life
If you don’t mind If you don’t mind
I’d rather be a loser
Yeah, I'd rather be a loser 

I just wanna keep to myself
Don’t need a trophy up on that shelf
I don’t need the wine with the cheese plate
Hell, I can feed myself
With a pool full of pills
On the real
Not the one to act like everything greats
Hollywood cosplay everything fake
I know that life gets petty
But it’s not so heavy
When I put that L to my face

I’d rather be a loser
Than be just like you
Tell me when’d you get so cool
I’d rather be a loser
Than be just like you
I don’t need a spot in your crew
There’s a party upside inside my head
With these invisible friends
I'm having the time of my life
If you don’t mind If you don’t mind
I’d rather be a loser
Yeah, I'd rather be a loser 

Give me some space
You can have the rest of cake
Get this off chest need a break
Why does it bother you
Why does it bother you

I’d rather be a loser
Than be just like you
Tell me when’d you get so cool
I’d rather be a loser
Than be just like you
I don’t need a spot in your crew
There’s a party upside inside my head
With these invisible friends
I'm having the time of my life
If you don’t mind If you don’t mind
I’d rather be a loser
Yeah, I'd rather be a loser
