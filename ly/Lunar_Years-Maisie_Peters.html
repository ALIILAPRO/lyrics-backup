		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know something that you don't know
Scathing down the landline, I still kinda love you
And I'm four steps forward in my plimsolls
But I still wanna stab any girl that wants to touch you
Church bells ringing for a fresh start
But you had a head start, always such an athlete
And no one wants to kiss a bad sport
So I keep my head high, wave at all your family

I knew you until you were someone else
And I don't know if you ever knew yourself

I guess we just weren't meant to be in love forever
And I guess people just change, you got good, I got better
But I still care about you, and I think I'll care forever
And I'm glad we got to do all those perfect, ugly, almost priceless
Lost and lovely lunar years together

I know something that you don't know
These days all our friends think you're kind of an asshole
And I've been cleaning up my sad act
Incense in the hallways burning through the charcoal
London's pretty in the autumn, and I'm a nicer person
Now I'm not your person, funny how that works and
Funny that we're working now

I guess we just weren't meant to be in love forever
And I guess people just change, you got good, I got better
But I still care about you, and I think I'll care forever
And I'm glad we got to do all those perfect, ugly, almost priceless
Lost and lovely lunar years together

Oh whoa
Mm
Oh whoa
Yeah

I knew you until you were someone else
And I don't know if you ever knew yourself

I guess we just weren't meant to be in love forever
And I guess people just change, you got good, I got better
But I still care about you, and I think I'll care forever
And I'm glad we got to do all those perfect, ugly, almost priceless
Lost and lovely lunar years together, mm
