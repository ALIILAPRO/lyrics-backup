		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh la la, I see stars, I'm seeing stars
Ooh la la, I see stars, I'm seeing stars
Ooh la la, I see stars, I'm seeing stars
Ooh la la, I see stars, I'm seeing stars
Ooh la la, I see stars, I'm seeing stars
Ooh la la, I see stars, I'm seeing stars

Once again, I find myself with my friends
Dancing the night away, it's like the party never ends
Then again we don't want it to stop, coz tonight's the night it goes sweat box
Laser beams, flashing lights, wild cards, men from Mars, dressed in Stars and stripes
Eclectic, electric, ladies of the evening, drinking booze and mingling
Mashing to the music, I can do anything
Freaky Dicky star speckles and pink butterflies and life is nice, so nice
I walk into a club and I've found paradise, I'm seeing stars, I can't believe my eyes

Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise
I dance all night, we're gonna dance all night, dance all night to this DJ
Ah Sugar, dance all night to this DJ
Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise
Dance all night, we're gonna dance all night, dance all night to this DJ
Ah Sugar, dance all night to this DJ, dance all night to this DJ
Lover dance all night to this DJ

Like the record spins on the trails we blaze, the walls are closing in but that's okay
Because I've been waiting all week to feel this way and it feels so good, so good
I'm on top of the world the coolest kid in the neighborhood
So let me be your star for one night that's right
Sweat box, laser beams, flashing lights, you've got to feel the rush
Feel the spice of life, love life, Shifty rolls the dice snake eyes surprise
Icing, mesmerizing, the minds are sick ones, cause what we are is victims of fun
Come on, come on, the fun is just begun come on the fun is just begun

Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise
I dance all night, we're gonna dance all night, dance all night to this DJ
Ah Sugar, dance all night to this DJ
Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise
Dance all night, we're gonna dance all night, dance all night to this DJ
Ah Sugar, dance all night to this DJ, dance all night to this DJ
Lover dance all night to this DJ

It goes ooh la la, I see stars, I'm seeing stars
Oh la la, I see stars, I'm seeing stars

Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise
I dance all night, we're gonna dance all night, dance all night to this DJ
Ah Sugar, dance all night to this DJ
Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise
Dance all night, we're gonna dance all night, dance all night to this DJ
Ah Sugar, dance all night to this DJ, dance all night to this DJ
Lover dance all night to this DJ
