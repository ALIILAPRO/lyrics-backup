		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ""Another cold dark night left alone Your arrogance will lead to the death of you I'll be the one to pull your head back down Remove your hollow Crown So far from the truth you hide away I'll be the one to pull your head back down Remove your hollow crown I'll die happy knowing that I will never be anything like you What gives you the right to silence me? All my life I've wanted just to fell like this You came you conquered you gave it away And how does it feel staring down on your idol's grave The one you once looked up to has fallen into dust The one you once looked up to has fallen away What's left for you in this fickle world? Remove your crown""
