		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the sleepy west of the woody east
Is a valley full, full o' pioneer
We're not just kids to say the least
We got ideas to us that's dear
Like capitalist, like communist
Like lots of things you've heard about
And redneckers, they get us pissed
And stupid stuff, it makes us shout
Oh, dance with me, oh, don't be shy
Oh, kiss me, cunt, oh, kiss me, cock
Oh, kiss the world, oh, kiss the sky
Oh, kiss my ass, oh, let it rock
Of the April birds and the May bee
Oh, baby
