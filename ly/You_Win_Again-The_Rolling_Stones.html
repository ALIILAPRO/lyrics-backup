		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The news is out all over town
That you've been seen out runnin' around
I know that I should leave, but then
I just can't go, you win again

This heart of mine could never see
What everybody knows but me
Just trusting you was my great sin
I just can't go, you win again

This heart of mine could never see
What everybody knows but me
Just trusting you was my great sin
I just can't go, you win again

I just can't go
You win again
