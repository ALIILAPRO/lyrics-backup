		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know I've been hurt before
But you didn't really care
Had enough of empty words
I'm not here to stay

I cannot do with you anymore
Once again you've crossed the line
And you're underestimating me again

I forgive the ones who hurt me
But I'll not forget your name
All the damage that you've done
I want to see you pay

Cause I will forgive the ones who hurt me
But I'll not forget your name
You will pay for all that you've done

When I put my trust in you
You just threw it all away
All the pain you've put me through
You're not here to stay

And you're underestimating me again
You get what you've been giving

Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain into my heart
I'll wash away the stains that you left behind
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain into my heart
To my heart, to my heart, to my heart

I forgive the ones who hurt me
But I'll not forget your name
All the damage that you've done
I want to see you pay

'Cause I will forgive the ones who hurt me
But I'll not forget your name
You will pay for all that you've done

I forgive the ones who hurt me
But I'll not forget your name
All the damage that you've done
I want to see you pay

'Cause I will forgive the ones who hurt me
But I'll not forget your name
You will pay for all that you've done
All that you have done

I will forgive the ones who hurt me
But I'll not forget your name
You will pay for all that you've done
