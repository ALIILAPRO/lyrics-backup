		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feels like i've been here waitin for you all my life
Feels like i'm smilin like this all the time
You make it so right and fun to live my life
Yeah i love my life
Yith you in my life

Five o clock, the windows down i know you're fast asleep and
All the little birdies tellin me i gotta tell when
It's been only rough and you came and fixed the wrongs babe
Cos you're the only reason i'm still holding on babe

When the world is down
(You're the one, you're the one)
Friends aren't like my friends
(Not my friends, not my friends)
When my body hurts
(By myself, by myself)
And nobody understands

Feels like i've been here waitin for you all my life
Feels like i'm smilin like this all the time
You make it so right and fun to live my life
Yeah i love my life
With you in my life
Feels like i've been here waitin for you all my life
Feels like i'm smilin like this all the time
You make it so right and fun to live my life
Yeah i love my life
With you in my life

I still think about the time you took my side in hell, babe
Held my hand when i was fighting angels in my home and
I was losing morals, i was losing morals, i was losing morals
Then you celebrated me for being me

You went out and picked up the pieces
When i was the reason it broke
I didn't know what i needed
And you gave me hope
Someone who would put me first before the first
They want heaven, heaven, heaven
But you gave it up for me when world was down

When the world is down
(You're the one, you're the one)
Friends aren't like my friends
(Not my friends, not my friends)
When my body hurts
(By myself, by myself)
And nobody understands

Feels like i've been here waitin for you all my life
Feels like i'm smilin like this all the time
You make it so right and fun to live my life
Yeah i love my life
With you in my life

Feels like i've been here waitin for you all my life
Feels like i'm smilin like this all the time
You make it so right and fun to live my life
Yeah i love my life
With you in my life

All my life
All the time
Live my life
Yeah i love my life
With you in my life

Feels like i've been here waitin for you all my life
Feels like i'm smilin like this all the time
You make it so right and fun to live my life
Yeah i love my life
With you in my life
