		  I can make you dance
Come on
Came on

I can make you dance
Come on
I can make you dance
Come on
I can make you dance, baby
I can make you move
I'm gonna make you dance, baby 
I'm gonna make you move
I can make you dance, baby
I can make you move
I'm gonna make you dance baby
I'm gonna keep you rockin' all night

I'm gonna keep you rockin' all night
We'll just dance
I can make you dance
That's right
Come on
Gonna get you in this groove
It's simple
Come on

I can make you dance, come on
Come on
I can make you dance, baby
I can make you move
I'm gonna make you dance, baby
I'm gonna make you move
I can make you dance, baby
I can make you move
I'm gonna make you dance, baby
It'll keep you rocking all night

Come on
Gonna keep you rocking all night
I can make you dance, come on
Come on, come on
It's simple

I can make you dance, baby
I can make you move
I'm gonna make you dance, baby
I'm gonna make you move
I can make you dance, baby
I can make you move
I'm gonna make you dance, baby
Gonna keep you rocking all night
Gonna keep you rocking all night

I can make you dance
