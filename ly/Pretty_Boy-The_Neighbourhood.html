(No more)

Even if my heart stops beatin'
You're the only thing I need
Ooh, with me
Even if the Earth starts shakin'
You're the only thing worth takin'
Ooh, with me
Even if the sky's on fire
Got you here, it's alright
Ooh, with me
And if it's all over
I'm taking this moment
Ooh, with me
Yeah

Pretty boy
You did this with me boy
Now it's all about to end
Baby girl
Look where we made it, girl
Mm, now we're fallin'

As long as I got you
I'm gonna be alright
As long as I got you, yeah
I'm not afraid to die
I'm alright

Even if my heart stops beatin'
You're the only thing I need
Ooh, with me (ooh, with me)
Even if the Earth starts shakin'
You're the only thing worth takin' along
Ooh, with me (ooh, with me)
Even if the sky's on fire
Got you here, it's alright
Ooh, with me (ooh, with me)
And if it's all over
I'm taking this moment
Ooh, with me
Wherever I'm goin'
I'm happy you're comin'
Ooh, with me
With me, yeah

I'm lucky you're with me, yeah, yeah
