		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pretty sure I'm maniacal, but what do I know?
I don't know, all I know is what I see through my monocle
That and the telescope, keep one lens on the money flow
The other's gold and complemental trusty world, well

I'm rolling down hills in a suit through the mud
Throw my dress shoes in a fire with the woods
Sit back and relax with the fumes of
Everything I hate in the world
Play Mozart, smoke my cigar on-
My estate, keep the cars parked on the front lawn
In a safe place, duct taped underneath their tires
And I wait

Sun sets to blood Moon horizons
Left brain and right brain divide him
Set frames and watch plays inside them
In the mountains now's where you'll find him
I smell a breeze in the morning
I feel your presence, it's warming
I paid attention to warnings
But we were too caught up and transforming

Ghetto in here, flash it
Ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin
Them the ones you talking to
Ghetto in here, flash it
Ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin
Them the ones you talking to
Ghetto in here, flash it
Ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin
Them the ones you talking to
Ghetto in here, flash it
Ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin
Them the ones you talking to

Lucky days, I'm feelin' the force, ooh
Your boy is dusty like brush up a fossil
Hear that shit uurk like the noise of a possum
Bitch, I'm a king, I was born in the castle
Built like a boxer, I'm ready to tussle
Fuck on my baby, I'm ready to bust one
Come fuck with me and my dogs
Hate on my ass like in laws, uh
That boy stay light like a cheerleader, um
She want me filled like a two litre, um
Eat it all day, watch it ricochet off
Then I skirt off on that Michelin, aw
They don't got nothing on me, till I pop
They don't got nothing on me, call the cop
I hit that run like a Heisman boy, run it back
Look at that boy, hear that running back

Shout out to salsa from San Marcos
I got addicted to soft shell tacos
Right now, it's panties and ramen noodles
Now I see how I'm gon' make a shooter
Stamina, stamina, I used to be holding the camera
Head through the glass, throw your window up
Start praying to me like my handle Cortana
We like Wu-Tang, but I feel like Santana
She's light skin, just like she Hannah Montana
Head was clean, Tony Fantano
Met my wife, she can't eat, 'cause she's so bella
Confused erection
Bad hoes, no name, brand slave, brainless

Ghetto in here, flash it
Ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin
Them the ones you talking to
Ghetto in here, flash it
Ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin
Them the ones you talking to
Ghetto in here, flash it
Ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin
Them the ones you talking to
Ghetto in here, flash it
Ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin
Them the ones you talking to
