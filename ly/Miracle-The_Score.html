		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's not just a phase
Now let me explain
I'm working through some shit
Sometimes I'm medicated

It's hard to relay
The thoughts in my brain
I'm working for a life that's not domesticated

It never goes the way that you planned
Success is a door that always slams
I'm trying to break it
I'm trying to break it

Searching for words and praying for signs
I struggle to find the rhythm and rhyme
Don't know how to say it
Don't know how to say

That I'm losing my mind
Trying to find the perfect line
I think I'm running out of time
I need a mira-miracle, a mira-miracle

Yeah, I'm losing my mind
Counting seconds passing by
And I don't know when I'll be fine
I need a mira-miracle, a mira-miracle
A miracle

It's not just a show
I need you to know
I'm trying to keep it real, sometimes it's complicated
This battle for gold is killing my soul
It's hard to be yourself when all you feel is jaded

Shit never goes the way that you planned
Success is a door that always slams
I'm trying to break it
I'm trying to break it

Searching for words and praying for signs
I struggle to find the rhythm and rhyme
Don't know how to say it
Don't know how to say

That I'm losing my mind
Trying to find the perfect line
I think I'm running out of time
I need a mira-miracle, a mira-miracle

Yeah, I'm losing my mind
Counting seconds passing by
And I don't know when I'll be fine
I need a mira-miracle, a mira-miracle
A miracle

I need a mira-miracle, a mira-miracle

Shit never goes the way that you planned
Success is a door that always slams
I'm trying to break it
I'm trying to break it

Searching for words and praying for signs
I struggle to find the rhythm and rhyme
Don't know how to say it
Don't know how to say I'm minutes away from going insane

'Cause I'm losing my mind
Trying to find the perfect line
I think I'm running out of time
I need a mira-miracle, a mira-miracle

Yeah, I'm losing my mind
Counting seconds passing by
And I don't know when I'll be fine
I need a mira-miracle, a mira-miracle
A miracle

I need a miracle
I need a mira-miracle, a mira-miracle
A miracle
