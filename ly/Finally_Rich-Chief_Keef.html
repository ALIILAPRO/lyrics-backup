		  Catch up, catch up
Oh my god, Sosa boy
Chief Keef is outta prison
Nigga, bitch nigga it's cracking
Bitch nigga it's cracking, bitch nigga
'Cause he is out of prison
Go on his Facebook page mothefucker
Go on his Facebook
Free Sosa, Sosa baby, catch up
Free my nigga Sosa, he out the jail
I ain't know none of these niggas
3hunna, fuck you mean nigga
Shout out to Fredo Santana
I'ma do a mixtape with y'all later, called "Ran My Bands Up"
Yeah, let's get this cash man
3Hunna nigga

Young Chop on the beat
I love all my fans
Without y'all I wouldn't get far
All these niggas follow my campaign
All these bitches know my name

I know I'm finally rich
But ain't a damn thang gon' change
Me and my boys still bang (bang bang)
We'll clap a nigga up no range, bitch I'm finally rich
I could ride foreign cars (skrt)
And I love all my fans (my fans)
Without y'all I wouldn't get far, bitch I'm finally rich
I could smoke all the dope
I get so high, just see the scope
Real nigga from the O, bitch I'm finally rich
Me and you ain't the same
All these niggas follow my campaign
And all these bitches know my name, bitch I'm finally rich

I'ma show you how to ball
Once you walk up in the mall
Hit every store and buy it all 'cause it ain't shit
I be flexing on these lames
I'm a O-Block nigga, can't change
64th street my domain, savages
So I gotta take care of my squad
Before every fucking body get robbed
For that night job and day job, that's why I got rich
So I could take care of my mama
Take care of my daughter
And take care of my brothers but I'm finally rich
So just watch Sosa stack this cheddar (Sosa baby)
Flexing and these niggas know better
Hate on me, it don't matter but I'm finally rich
So just watch Sosa stack this cheddar (Sosa baby)
Flexing and these niggas know better
Hate on me, it don't matter 

I know I'm finally rich
But ain't a damn thang gon' change
Me and my boys still bang (bang bang)
We'll clap a nigga up no range, bitch I'm finally rich
I could ride foreign cars (skrt)
And I love all my fans (my fans)
Without y'all I wouldn't get far, bitch I'm finally rich
I could smoke all the dope
I get so high, just see the scope
Real nigga from the O, bitch I'm finally rich
Me and you ain't the same
All these niggas follow my campaign
And all these bitches know my name, bitch I'm finally rich

I be flexing with my big bros, Reese, Money and Fredo
We got big Ben Franklin bank rolls, bitch, we rich 
Yeah I get twenty for a show (show), I ain't worried 'bout no hoes 
'Cause I switch those like I switch clothes and bitch I'm rich 
Every bitch know Chief Keef (Chief Keef), every bitch want Chief Keef (Chief Keef)
All these bitches on Chief Keef, I'm finally rich
I got diamonds all in my watch (bling), horses all in my cars (skrt)
I get ten bands for a bar

I know I'm finally rich
But ain't a damn thang gon' change
Me and my boys still bang (bang bang)
We'll clap a nigga up no range, bitch I'm finally rich
I could ride foreign cars (skrt)
And I love all my fans (my fans)
Without y'all I wouldn't get far, bitch I'm finally rich
I could smoke all the dope
I get so high, just see the scope
Real nigga from the O, bitch I'm finally rich
Me and you ain't the same
All these niggas follow my campaign
And all these bitches know my name, bitch I'm finally rich
