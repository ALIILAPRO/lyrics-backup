		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We were sleeping till
You came along
With your tiny heart
You let us in the wooden house
To share in all the wealth

Don't you know it's true?
Norway

Seven figures leap the hungry mouths
The beast, he comes to you
A hunter for a lonely heart
In the season of the sun

Don't you know it's true?
Norway
Norway

All the people say to me
Please enjoy yourself
I'm going home anyway
We keep it to ourselves

Norway
Norway
Norway
Norway
