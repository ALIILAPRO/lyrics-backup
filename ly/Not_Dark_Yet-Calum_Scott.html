		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shadows are falling, and I've been here all day
It's too hot to sleep, and time is running away
I feel like my soul has turned into steel
I've still got the scars, that the sun didn't let meheal
There's not even room enough, to be anywhere

It's not dark yet, but it's getting there

Well, my sense of humanity, is goin' down the drain
Behind every beautiful thing, there's been some kind of pain
She wrote me a letter, and she wrote it so kind
She put down in writing, what was in her mind
I just don't see why I should even care

And it's not dark yet, but it's getting there

Well, I've been to London, and I've been to gay Paris
I've followed the river, and I got to the sea
I've been down to the bottom, of a world full of lies
Ain't lookin' for nothing, in anyone's eyes
Sometimes my burden, is more than I can bear

And it's not dark yet, but it's getting there

I was born here, and I'll die here, against my will
Know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still
Every nerve in my body, is so naked and numb
Can't remember what it was, I came here to get away from
I don't even hear a murmur of a prayer

And it's not dark yet, but it's getting there
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear
And it's not dark yet, but it's getting there
