		  (Ba-da-da-dum-bum-bum)
(Ba-da-da-dum-bum-bum)
(Ba-da-da-dum-bum-bum)
(Bum-ba-da-dum-bum-bum)
 
I don't care 
What they do
I just wanna 
Be with you
And I don't mind
All the times
We will fight 
Just to get through (yeah)

Yeah, 'cause all these empty faces
They got nothin' on yours
They got nothin' on yours
They got nothin' on yours, and yeah
All the brightest places
They turn dark when you're gone
They turn dark when you're gone
They turn dark when you're gone

You got that hometown smile
You got that look in your eyes
That says "Oh, every-thing will one day be alright"
You got that hometown smile
You got that look in your eyes
And I'll do anything just to keep you by my side

All through my life (life)
I finally realized
That home is not (not)
Where you go (where you go)
'Cause now I need (now I need) 
Only you and me (you and me)
And wherever we'll be ('ever we'll be)
We'll never get lost
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-na

Yeah, 'cause all these empty faces
They got nothin' on yours (they got nothin' on yours)
They got nothin' on yours (they got nothin' on yours)
They got nothin' on yours
They can keep on talkin' baby
You're the beat through the noise
You're the beat through the noise
You're my beat through just noise

You got that hometown smile
You got that look in your eyes
That says "Oh, everything will one day be alright"
You got that hometown smile
You got that look in your eyes
And I'll do anything just to keep you by my side
By my side

You got that hometown smile
You got that look in your eyes
That says "Oh, everything will one day be alright"
You got that hometown smile
You got that look in your eyes (look in your eyes)
And I'll do anything just to keep you by my side

Everything will one day
Everything will one day
Everything will one day be alright
Everything will one day
Everything will one day
Everything will one day be alright
