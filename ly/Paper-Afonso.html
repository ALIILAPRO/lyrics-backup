		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wrote on paper all you mean to me
And like that, you'd see you shouldn't go
Kept if for myself too long
But now you're gone just like so
I don't wanna say goodbye
I just wanted us to try our
Love, like there's no tomorrow
Try love, like there's no one but us
No one but you
You felt like no one else did
Nothing else did, only you
Feel lucky to have met you
But now it's through do I really do
I don't wanna say goodbye
I just wanted us to try our
Love, like there's no tomorrow
Try Love, like there's no one but us
No one but you
