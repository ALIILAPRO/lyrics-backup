		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woke up again
Feeling like a nightmare
(I hope it never happens again)
I don't know when
Think I started at the ending
(You know it just might happen again)

Got a pretty little daydream
Telling me what I need to hear
But I can't let you go
Nothing left to say, dear
So why do I still stay here
When all I know is you're (an eyesore)

Blue like Picasso, green like Monet
My mind keeps slipping further away
Am I wasting my breath? Probably
Over the edge, most of the way
Most of the way

So damn unfair
Racing, going nowhere
(Oh no, it's gone and happened again)
I'm spiraling
Getting sick of my pretending
(You know I think I like it again)

Got a pretty little daydream
Telling me what I need to hear
But I can't let you go
Nothing left to say, dear
So why do I still stay here
When all I know is you
And I'm still

Blue like Picasso, green like Monet
My mind keeps slipping further away
Am I wasting my breath? Probably
Over the edge, most of the way
Most of the way

Can you tell me what it's like to breathe easy?
Even for a little while
Can you tell me what it's like to feel free?
Fighting for a little smile

Blue like Picasso, green like Monet
My mind keeps slipping further away
Am I wasting my breath? Probably
Over the edge, most of the way

Blue like Picasso, green like Monet
My mind keeps slipping further away
Am I wasting my breath? Probably
Over the edge, most of the way
Most of the way

(Yeah)
