		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I got too comfortable
Knowing you were always there
Thought we were invulnerable
Now we're hanging by a hair
I want it all back but I can't find the words to say
And I wanna know why I'm not seeing you the same
Never good at letting go
Wish I could go back to when

I’d hang on every word you said
Rereading all the messages you’d send

I wish I could fall
Back in love like the beginning
We had butterflies and didn't mind the distance
Don't we have it all?
But it feels like something’s missing
I'm not ready to admit it so tonight
Won't you love me like the first time?
Won't you love me like the first time?

I think that we feel the same
We’re making it worse trying to make it work this way
It's like trying to force a lock
You think you're getting somewhere then it becomes clear it won't budge

And I want it all back but I can't make it happen
And I wanna go back
I wanna make you happy again

I wish I could fall
Back in love like the beginning
We had butterflies and didn't mind the distance
Don't we have it all?
But it feels like something’s missing
I'm not ready to admit it so tonight

I wish I could hold you like the first time 
And kiss you like the first time
Love you like I've never loved before
I wish I could see you for the first time
And want you for the first time
Feel you like like I've never felt before

I wish I could fall
Back in love like the beginning
We had butterflies
Didn't mind the distance
Don't we have it all?
But it feels like something’s missing
I'm not ready to admit it so tonight
Won't you love me like the first time?
