		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Play heed this take of the prince of darkness,
Whom we're taught to fear from day number one.
The beguiling serpent, king of the underworld,
Betrayer and mocker of heaven's chosen one.
Evil and wicked dreamer, creator of sins,
Ultimate deceiver; longing to take you in.
He promises earthly glory, if you play his game;
"I won't let the firebombs hurt you, just
Number your head and take my name."

Belial begins his scheming, treacherous plan,
Turns brother on brother, toys with the leaders of man.
He creates before them illusions of broken truce,
A wicked plot of deception, that commanders cannot refuse.
In a short time he has control,
USA, Russia, chaos from pole to pole.
Mankind's worst nightmare, it's too late to pray,
Hold tight and take your last breath,
The missiles are on their way...DOOMSDAY!

All over the earth the horror begins,
This time there's no second chance.
Firebombs...deathly flash, vapors spread so fast,
In a moment the world is ash.
There in the midst stands the deceiver
Bearing a brooding smile.
Surrounded by his marked believers,
The masses of unscarred.

Evil's reign, called by the prophets,
Under a darkened sky,
Ghastly sins everywhere, unmarked survivors
Sacrificed as demons dance.
Suddenly, the hordes are silenced,
By the rumbling planed, metalbeast soon to appear,
To challenge the enemy, to deal his doom,
To write the devil's dirge...Doomsday!

The scorched ground opens, the beast of metal appears,
Satan and his army show no sign of fear.
Across desert plains, through city streets,
In the hills evil meets defeat.
Covens one by on fall by metal's hand,
As the dark forces weaken.
The monster rages through the battles,
To confront the master of sin.

As the night falls, the beasts, they meet
And the existing numbered line along the street.
The air is charged with power metal,
Flotzilla's eyes glow as he feeds.
The clash begins, a fight 'til death,
Such power never seen before.
Thrashing jaws, slashing claws,
Dealing the darkside's fate;
The deceiver's doom this day...DOOMSDAY!
