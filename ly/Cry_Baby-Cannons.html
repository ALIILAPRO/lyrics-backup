		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I came home late
With a million thoughts in my head
Like how I let you slip though my fingers
Should've heard the things that I said
I was busy looking for affection
When I had you here the whole time
But you're my sunshine
And I never meant to make you cry

But it tears me apart
The way I played with your heart
So before it gets dark
Can we go back to the start?
'Cause I hate we're apart
I miss the way that we are

This is what I want
You're the one I dream of every day
Can you see it in my eyes?
Without you it feels like I'm dying
I'm a crybaby

You I know cry, baby
I'm just a crybaby
Crybaby, crybaby
Turn back the time, baby

And I wake up late
'Cause I was just with you in my head
I'd rather sleep to dream
And not get out of this bed
Now I'm begging for your attention
When I had it here the whole time
'Cause you're my sunshine

This is what I want
You're the one I dream of every day
Can you see it in my eyes?
Without you it feels like I'm dying
Now I'm talking to myself
Looking for love in the wrong places
With thoughts of you up in my mind
In every teardrop that I cry
I'm a crybaby

You I know cry, baby
I'm just a crybaby
Crybaby, crybaby
Turn back the time, baby

You I know cry, baby
I'm just a crybaby
Crybaby, crybaby
Turn back the time, baby
This is what I want
You I know cry, baby
I'm just a crybaby
You're the one I dream of every day
Crybaby, crybaby
Turn back the time, baby
Can you see it in my eyes?
You I know cry, baby
I'm just a crybaby
Without you it feels like I'm dying
Crybaby, crybaby
Turn back the time, baby
I'm a crybaby
You I know cry, baby
I'm just a crybaby
