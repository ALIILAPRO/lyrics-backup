		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I watched him SNAP HIS OWN FUCKING NECK
When he started WRAPPING HIS HEAD
All around that PATHETIC SELF
Centered cesspool of MISINFORMATION

When I find that motherfucker
I'll show the difference
Between choosing to rear it's ugly head
For digital gain, and physical suffering

MY FRIEND EDDIE
HAS LOST HIS MIND

NOW
SHOW THE CLASS
HOW YOU COULD NEVER DO THE MATH
SHOW THE CLASS
YOU COULD NEVER JUST
DO              THE               MATH
NOW
SHOW THE CLASS
HOW YOU COULD NEVER DO THE MATH
SHOW THE CLASS
YOU COULD NEVER JUST
FIG           URE             IT          OUT      
FRONT AND FUCKING CENTER
