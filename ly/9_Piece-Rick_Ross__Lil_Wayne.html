		  M-M-M-Maybach Music
Huh
YMCMB
Huh
As I look around
We the only niggas with that A1 Perico
Huh

I'm smoking dope, I'm on my cell phone
I'm selling dope, straight off the iPhone
He want a quote, he talking 9 zones
He bought 4, I front him 5 more
9 piece, straight 8 balls
MJG, bitch, I got 8 balls
9 piece, straight 8 balls
MJG, bitch, I got 8 balls

Suave House, still independent
Distribution Mexican, he still sendin'
No contract, take my word
Send a hundred packs, bitch, them my birds
Shoe box, no shoes in 'em
In the two seater, me and two women
No Def Jam, went solo
Took your custy's, prices so low

I'm smoking dope, I'm on my cell phone
I'm selling dope, straight off the iPhone
He want a quote, he talking 9 zones
He bought 4, I front him 5 more
9 piece, straight 8 balls
MJG, bitch, I got 8 balls
9 piece, straight 8 balls
MJG, bitch, I got 8 balls

It's Lil' Tunechi, what up though?
I'm talkin' white girl, Marilyn Monroe
And I can get 'em for the sweet 16
Hard dope, call it HD flat screen
Fuck outta here, your shit water whipped
You got that tan dope, look like a Florida bitch
Automatic leave 'em dead in the livin' room
Get it? Leave 'em dead in the livin' room
Fuck all these niggas, and tell them bitches to kiss my ass
I put that pistol to his head and tell that nigga to have a blast
Fuck you mean? I'm talking ki's like Ray Charles
Rack 'em up, pool table full of 8 balls, yeah

I'm smoking dope, I'm on my cell phone (yeah)
I'm selling dope, straight off the iPhone (yeah)
He want a quote, he talking 9 zones (yeah)
He bought 4, I front him 5 more (huh)
9 piece, straight 8 balls (yeah)
MJG, bitch, I got 8 balls (yeah)
9 piece, straight 8 balls
MJG, bitch, I got 8 balls

Soft white, I got that G-mix (huh)
I'm going gold, crumbs to the bricks (huh)
I'm on the road, lets buy some new whips
Trick a hundred hoes, spend a few chips (Rozay)
9 piece, straight 8 balls (huh)
Bitch, I'm blowin' up like napalm (woo)
Got your bottom bitch going AWOL (woo)
Nigga's looking at ya like you fell off (woo)
No sir, not me (not me)
I'm double platinum just like my Ferrari (hhuh)
Bulletproof, nigga Teflon (Teflon)
Why you snortin' that? That shit stepped on (yeah)

I'm smoking dope, I'm on my cell phone (yeah)
I'm selling dope, straight off the iPhone (yeah)
He want a quote, he talking 9 zones (yeah)
He bought 4, I front him 5 more
9 piece, straight 8 balls (yeah)
MJG, bitch, I got 8 balls (yeah)
9 piece, straight 8 balls
MJG, bitch, I got 8 balls (yeah, yeah, yeah)
