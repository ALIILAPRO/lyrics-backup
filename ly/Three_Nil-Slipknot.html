		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, three, nil
Yeah

Chaos, it's just the beginning
Every promise I made I'm rescinding
Center mass in the middle of the monster
I'm getting tired of drowning the constant 
Cry for help it's debatable
The only reason that you love me is I'm hated by all
Come on, come see dysfunction
I guess we're gonna leave it open for discussion

Who am I?
And where am I going?
Maybe I'm looking in the wrong direction
Maybe I'm looking for any direction 

This is not my war
This is not my fight 
This is something more
This is not my life
(This is not my) revolution
(This is not my) convolution
(This is not my) expectation
(This is not my) desperation

Yeah, holed up, scarred and tamed for the hell of it
Look at me, I am the glorified malcontent
Save me? Save this
All I gotta do is give up, and all is forgiven 
I'm sick of being the butt of a cosmic joke 
And I don't get the punchline
A million people lined up for miles 
To see the great big mouth shut up and apologize

This is not my war
This is not my fight 
This is something more
This is not my life
(This is not my) revolution
(This is not my) convolution
(This is not my) only reason to question why

Today, I said goodbye, goodbye
Oh I didn't need to leave to stay right here 
Today, I said goodbye, goodbye
Oh I didn't need to leave to stay right here 
Today, I said goodbye, goodbye
Oh I didn't need to leave to stay right here 
Today, I said goodbye, goodbye
Oh I didn't need to leave to stay right here 
Today I said goodbye

Yeah

I'm the pariah (break me)
I am the liar (save me)
I can take anything (make me)
Accuse me of everything (kill me)
Cut off the system (slay me)
Deny my existence (waste me)
I won't be afraid (try me)
I won't be unmade (take me)
Come on, break it off
Come on, buy the lie
Come on, say it, say it
Come on, say goodbye

Goodbye
Oh I didn't need to leave to stay right here 
Today, I said goodbye, goodbye
Oh I didn't need to leave to stay right here 
Today, I said goodbye, goodbye
Oh I didn't need to leave to stay right here
Today, I said goodbye, goodbye
Oh I didn't need to leave to stay right here
Today, I said goodbye, goodbye

One (one), two (two), three (three), nil

Yes
