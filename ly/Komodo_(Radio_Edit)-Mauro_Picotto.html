		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Save our soul
Save it now for a better life
Time to break because time is flying on and on
But if you want to believe in a better life
Find a way, try now
Come together with a smile
Save our soul
Save it now for a better life
Time to break because time is flying on and on
But if you want to believe in a better life
Find a way, try now
Come together with a smile (come together with a smile, come together with a smile)
