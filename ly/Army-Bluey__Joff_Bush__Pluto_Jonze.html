		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, hello! You must be my new student
I'm Jack!
Jack can't sit still or remember anything
Argh!
Well, I think you should go and play with that red kelpie down there
And that's when I met Rusty
What are you playing?
I'm playing army!
Can I be in the army?
Well, maybe, can you do as you're told?
No, I'm no good at doing what
Attention! (Hut!)
On the left! (Hut!)
Quick! March! Hold! On the right! Hut, hut, hut! Salute!
Yeah, you can play

On the left! Quick! March!
On the right! Salute!
Hold!
Oh, no! Run!

Well, you're really good at playing army
