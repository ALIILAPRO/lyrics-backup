		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I lost all hope, I left it with someone, some time, somewhere ago
And I picture it now, the house on the hill, with nobody wandering around
I cried like hell, hugging the floor pretending there's somebody else
The more I sleep, the less I dream, the closer I feel

Oh my word, I'm nothing but a curse
Oh my word, I'm nothing but a curse

If I think things through, there's still some way of me making this up to you
The more I sleep, the less I dream, the closer I feel

Oh my word, I'm nothing but a curse
Oh my word, I'm nothing but a curse

All I have left, is tied up in your head
All I have left is tied up

The more I sleep, the more I sleep
The less I dream, the closer I get

Oh my word, I'm nothing but a curse
Oh my word, I'm nothing but a curse
Oh my word, I'm nothing but a curse
Oh my word, I'm nothing but a curse
