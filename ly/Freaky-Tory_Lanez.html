		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All this drip, you gon' need a umbrella

Ooh, ooh, ayy (Rich)
I got two hoes, light skin, the chocolate (What?)
Throw the gang when I walk in through my block lit (Block lit)
Got my ex tryna put me on the block list (On the block list)
It's always somebody ex tryna pop shit (Woo)
It was flat then, she got ass shots (Ass shots)
Now they cheer for it, she got mascots (What?)
And she hit the club, baby, throw that ass up
Swear that ass on me, baby, I'ma pass out (Pass out)
You could talk to me, I'ma talk back
I got sauce, bae, ain't no salt bae
I just walked in, check the walk, mane (Woo)
Jeans Balmain, bitch, I'm ballin' (Yeah)
If I fuck a shawty, I ain't gotta answer (Answer)
She a scorpio and fuck me like a cancer (Like a cancer)
Fuckin' niggas' hoes, I ain't gotta answer (What?)
Pussy good and I had to double mans up
Shawty say she rock bottom so I'm rockin' for what?
Couple million on the 'gram, but you poppin' for what?
Tryna play me like a bird, bitch, you down in the dirt
All in my section, ain't fuckin', but drinkin' bottles for what?

I'm a rich ass nigga, you a bitch ass nigga
I'ma put face in it
Nigga, quick fast, nigga
Got a stick, grrragh
Hit your bitch ass nigga
Better talk to me nice when you hit that, nigga, yeah
Heard my mama workin' with some ass, yeah
Heard my mama like to keep it nasty (Nasty)
Strip club, throw a lot of racks, yeah
Shawty gettin' freaky and nasty (Woo!)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy 
Shawty gettin' freaky and nasty (What?)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Shawty gettin' freaky and nasty (Woo!)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy 
Shawty gettin' freaky and nasty (What?)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Shawty gettin' freaky and nasty

I'm the reason why lil' mama got that ass so thick
She done heard lotta stories 'bout this cash I get
She done heard lotta stories 'bout this dick I slang
She wanna suck a nigga ding-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling, yeah
Shit, I pop, through the block with my ice, I walk
Shit, I fuck, through your block with the icey drop
I might let your friend hit it, gotta share the rock
I done hit every bitch in your hair salon
I'm a freak in the sheets, I'm a dog, lil' bitch
I hit the windows and to the walls, lil' bitch
I know you got a man, you need to pause, lil' bitch
I'ma hit that shit until he calls, lil' bitch (Yeah)
Okay, y'all tell me, niggas all jelly
You don't call me, then my off celly (Off celly)
If you wan' fuck me tonight, I said it already
I need I.D., ain't no R. Kelly

I'm a rich ass nigga, you a bitch ass nigga
I'ma put face in it
Nigga, quick fast, nigga
Got a stick, grrragh
Hit your bitch ass nigga
Better talk to me nice when you hit that, nigga, yeah
Heard my mama workin' with some ass, yeah
Heard my mama like to keep it nasty
Strip club, throw a lot of racks, yeah
Shawty gettin' freaky and nasty (Woo!)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy 
Shawty gettin' freaky and nasty (What?)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (Woo!)
Shawty gettin' freaky and nasty
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Shawty gettin' freaky and nasty (Ooh, she nasty)
