		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lost highway, carry on
All the souls that I've known
I see flowers everywhere
But it’s only cryings that come up in the air
So many lives around I guess that it was just your time
For every rose, one big stone
One phone call, my world alone
I miss you, sweet mother
I’ll see you some other time,
Some other grounds
Lost highway way too fast
Headlights burnin' all my laughs
Where was I when you screamed
Where was I when you lost all your dreams
People think,that it’s alright
When your face got so much lights

Did your blue eyes peacefully
Finally dived into the sea
I miss you sweet brother
I'll see you some other time,
Some other grounds
Nothing could tell the power of your smell
How many hands on my head
You took the train with heavy tickets
It’s not your fault
You couldn't make it
I know that the sun shines better
Now that you'll stay by his side
For ever
I miss you sweet sister
I'll see you some other time,
Some other grounds
