		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Killing with pleasure
Never really seen
Waiting in the dark
Blood is what it need
Have no anethasia 
The pain of being killed
Fearing death is self
Mindless thoughts are filled 

Axe of death
Its merciless
The axe of death
Looking for you
Axe of death
Its merciless
The axe of death

There is good and there is evil
No inbetween
Fighting for the darkness
Is all that you see
Master of the wicked
Killing the priests
Doing what they love
Like an ecstasy

Axe of death 
Its merciless 
The axe of death 
Looking for you
Axe of death 
Its merciless
The axe of death 

Sinner of the night
Going to kill
The pain of the blade 
Is what you will feel
The last thing you'll see
The light in your eyes
Fighting is no good
Either way you'll die

There is no heaven
Without a hell
Forged into evil
I cast my spell 
Wanting to be
Just like me
Trying to see
How to be free

Axe of death 
Its merciless 
The axe of death 
Looking for you
Axe of death 
Its merciless
The axe of death
