		<p>
		  Fall into you

Do you really want to know? 
Tell me, tell me
Can you feel me lettin' go? Slowly
I'm scared to fall into you

I want to 
Feel you, touch you, know you
I want to 
So I let you set me free into sweet misery

There's a hunger do you know
Feed me, feed me
It's gettin' harder not to show
Free me
I'm scared to fall into you

I want to
Feel you, touch you, know you
I want to
So I let you set me free into sweet misery

Sweet misery
I want to
Feel you, touch you, know you
I want to
So I let you set me free into sweet misery

I want to
Feel you, touch you, know you
I want to 
So I let you set me free sweet misery
