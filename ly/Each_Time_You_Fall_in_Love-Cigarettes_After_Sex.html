		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Each time you fall in love
It's clearly not enough
You sleep all day and drive out in L.A.
It isn't safe
And each time you kiss a girl
You never know what it's worth
You say all of the words they wanna hear
It isn't real

She took you for a ride in summer, baby
Lost all your money to her
All I wanna know is if you love her
How come you never give in?

Each time you have a dream
You never know what it means
You see that open road and never know which way to go
And each time you fall in love
It's clearly not enough
You sleep all day and drive out in L.A.
It isn't safe

She took you for a ride in summer, baby
Lost all your money to her
All I wanna know is if you love her
How come you never give in?
