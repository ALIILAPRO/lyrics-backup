		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can still feel the love
I can still feel the love
I can still feel the love
Feel the love

We not worried 'bout no other niggas, we them other niggas
You bust down a Rollie, I bust down a brick
Then I flood it, nigga
I am not to be compared to you rappers, Eazy-Duz-It, nigga
I am more Eazy, you tryin' your best to become me, nigga
She like them bottles with bubbles in it
Buy her Loewe and other linen
Why would I wait when there's other women?
Why would I hate? We in love with winnin' (ooh)
Buy her bundles, fly her out
Bring her friend, I try her out
Ain't no worries findin' out
The details is ironed out
Easily they plays along
Hopin' that I play a song
Love to fuck to trap music (feel the love)
Grrrat-gat-gat-gat-gat
Dope money just came along (woo)

Grrrat-gat (I can still feel the love)
Gat-gat-gat-gat-gat
Grrrat-gat-gat-gat (I can still feel the love)
Grrrat-gat-gat-gat-gat-gat (feel the love)
Grrrat

Ba-ba-ba-ba
Brrat-tat-da-da-da-da
Ga-ga-ga-ga
Brrr-ah-da-da, brrr-ah-da-da
Brrr-ah-da-da-da, brrr-ah-da-da-da
Brrr-ah-brrr-ah, brrr-ah-ga-grrrat
Ru-ru-ru-ru-oh!

Where the chorus?

I can still feel the love
I can still feel the love
I can still feel the love
Feel the love
Woo!
I can still feel the love
I can still feel the love
I can still feel the love
I can still feel the love
I can still feel the love
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (feel the love)
Ba-ba-ba-ba
Ru-ru-ru-ru-ohh!
