		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just wanna be
I just wanna be

Takin' away the fact that I care about you
It's just your way, so sweet
Everything seems right around you
Did you know that you
Had this common way about you when you touch
And I wanna know if I could be your girl

You are everything, and everything is you
You are everything, and everything is you
You are everything, and everything is you
You are everything, and everything is you

I'm happy to say
In a lot of ways you've changed me
Makes me smile when you said
You were glad the day you found me
I'm wishin' away
Any harm that I might ever find you
Heaven knows
I really feel I'll always be your girl

You are everything, and everything is you
You are everything, and everything is you
Oh, you are everything, and everything is you
You are everything, and everything is you

The one who puts her arms around you
The one who lays her head beside you
The one who listens when you need it
When no one else besides me sees it

The one who knows when something's wrong
The one who knows your favorite song
The one who all your family loves
The one you place no one above

You are everything, and everything is you
You are everything, and everything is you
Oh, you are everything, and everything is you
You are everything, and everything is you

The one to turn to you, and down for you
The one who makes you smile and laughs with you
The one to hold you down, I'm there for you
The one, the one, the one

The one to turn to you and down for you
The one who makes you smile and laughs with you
The one to hold you down I'm there for you
The one, the one, the one

The one who turns to you
The one who makes you smile (need to be you girl)
The one who holds you down
The one, the one, the one (your girl)

The one who turns to you
The one who makes you smile (your girl)
The one who holds you down
The one, the one, the one

I can be anything you need
