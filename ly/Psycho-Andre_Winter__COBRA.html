		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah I need you 
I've been going crazy
Going psycho 
I might lose my mind
I might just lose control 
Yeah I know 
What you out here looking for

Yeah I need you 
I've been going crazy
Going psycho 
I might lose my mind
I might just lose control 
Yeah I know 
What you out here looking for

She got me going psycho 
Yeah Psycho 
My baby really got me psycho 
Yeah psycho 

She got me going psycho 
Yeah Psycho 
My baby really got me psycho 
Yeah psycho 

Don't test my patience 
Anymore with this
Even though we break up 
We gon fuck again 
I know what your friends say
They'll say I'm not worth it
But you know where my heart lays
You do
Yeah you do

I sit here in silence 
I'm finished with trying with you
I wish I was lying 
When I said I loved you too
And if I could turn back time 
Yeah you know I would 
Just to break your heart just as bad

But who am I to judge you
Even though you went and did me wrong 
I guess I should've known better
Should've seen you were gonna cut me off
But what should I expect from a girl that's lost her head
And a girl that I thought loved me 
But I guess I'm better off dead yeah

Yeah I need you 
I've been going crazy
Going psycho 
I might lose my mind
I might just lose control 
Yeah I know 
What you out here looking for

Yeah I need you 
I've been going crazy
Going psycho 
I might lose my mind
I might just lose control 
Yeah I know that 
What you out here looking for

She got me going psycho 
Yeah Psycho 
My baby really got me psycho 
Yeah psycho 

She got the me going psycho 
Yeah Psycho 
My baby really got me psycho 
Yeah psycho
