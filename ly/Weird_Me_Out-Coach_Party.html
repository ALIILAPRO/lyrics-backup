		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me a story about me and you
Make it nice, I wanna feel cute
Am I wearing a dress, are your hands on my waist?
Am I asking for more, did I like the taste?

Did I like the taste?
Did I like the taste?

I had a dream about me and you
You drove me around and we got matching tattoos
You were touching my neck, you were kissing my face
I was dripping with sweat. Did you like the taste?

Did you like the taste?
Did you like the taste?

Weird me out
Don't be yourself, cause I want something better
I'll grow my hair the way you like
If it reminds you of her
Why do I care? We're better than that
Why do I care? We're better than that

I want someone but I also don't
And I love you but I also don't

Weird me out
Don't be yourself, cause I want something better
I'll grow my hair the way you like
If it reminds you of her
Why do I care? I'm better than that
Why do I care? I'm better than that

Take me back to when we first met
We just met
I cared about nobody but you
Didn't care what they said

Come weird me out
Don't be yourself, cause I want something better
I'll grow my hair the way you like
If it reminds you of her
Why do I care? I'm better than that
Why do I care? I'm better than that
Why do I care? I'm better than that
Why do I care? I'm better than that
