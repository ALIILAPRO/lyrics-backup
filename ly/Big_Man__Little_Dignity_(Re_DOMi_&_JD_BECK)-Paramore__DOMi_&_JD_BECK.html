		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't mean to stare at you from across the room
It's like I'm glued to the sheer sight of you
And you're so smooth, it's pitiful
Know you could get away with anything
So that's exactly what you do

Big man, ooh
Little dignity
Big man, ooh
Little dignity
No offense but you
You've got no integrity
Big man, ooh
Oh, li-li-li-little dignity

Well, well, well, look at you
Don't you clean up nice?
Bet it feels good to leave the past behind
Your subscription to redemption has been renewed
You keep your head high
Smooth operator in a shit-stained suit

Big man, ooh
Little dignity
Big man, ooh
Little dignity
No offense but you
You've got no integrity
Big man, ooh
Oh, li-li-li-little dignity

Oh, I can't look away
I memorized all your lines, I can't look away
You're like a movie that I love to hate
I fantasize your demise
I should look away because I know you're never gonna change
I keep thinking this time, the end'll be different, but it isn't
I keep thinking (keep thinking)
The end is gonna be different but you keep on winning

Big man, ooh
Little dignity
Big man, ooh
Little dignity
No offense but you
You've got no integrity
Big man, ooh
Oh, li-li-li-little dignity
