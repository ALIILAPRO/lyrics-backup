La-la-la-la-la

La-la-la-la-la

Here's a song
It reminds me of when we were young
Looking back at all the things we've done
You gotta keep on, keepin' on

Out to sea, it's the only place I honestly
Can get myself some piece of mind
You know it's getting hard to fly

If I'm to fall
Would you be there to applaud?
Or would you hide behind them all?
'Cause if I had to go
In my heart you grow
And that's where you belong

If I'm to fall
Would you be there to applaud?
Or would you hide behind them all?
'Cause if I had to go
In my heart you'll grow
And that's where you belong

If I'm to fall
Would you be there to applaud?
Or would you hide behind them all?
'Cause if I had to go
In my heart you'll grow
And that's where you belong

Guess I'm outta time
I'm outta time
I'm outta time
I'm outta time
I'm outta time
