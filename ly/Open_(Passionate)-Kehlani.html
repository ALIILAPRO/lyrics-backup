		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  3 AM in Vegas
All day, been faded
You're on tour, in and out them stadiums
And there's bitches backstage
Tryna upstage me
How am I to know what to do?

What if you slip up?
What if tequila grab your neck and say, "Don't bitch up"?
What if you wanna shoot your shot and load the clip up?
Are you scared to lose your queen and gain a bishop?

Do I got you way too open to be open?
Is the lens you see me through just way too focused?
What if you're curious and caught up in the moment?
Can you hold me down when I'm across the ocean?
Can you control it?
Do I got you way too open to be open?
Would you let it twist up all of your emotions?
What if you're curious and caught up in the moment?
Do I got you way too open to be (open)

If I'm in AOD
Tryna stay lowkey
Shawty so religious way she prayin' on me
But if I take her to the private
Let her be my pilot
How should I know what to do?

And what if I slip up?
What if tequila grabs my neck and say, "Don't bitch up"?
What if I wanna shoot my shot and load the clip up?
And if I do the same, will you go play the victim?

Or do you got me way too open to be open?
Is the lens I see you through just way too focused?
What if I'm curious and caught up in the moment?
Will I mess around when you're across the ocean?
Can I control it? Oh woah
Do you got me way too open to be open?
Would I let it twist up all of my emotions?
Will I mess around when you're across the ocean?
Do you got me way too open to be (open)

Made it out the mud, but still it's cleanly
Pull up where I'm from and they respect me
Made some room for you up in the front seat
Slidin', need one to confide in
Then we hear the sirens, grindin'
I knew it was all in you
When I saw your eyes, then I met your hands
Lay it on my thigh, you control the cruise
I make you crazy when nobody watchin'
I'm out your way and I proceed with caution
Don't do too much talkin', just lay down that action
Know you come off bold, but it's just your passion

Oh, you're passionate, baby
Passionate, baby
Passionate, baby
Passionate, baby

It's only your passion how you move by
You fallin' head over, right outta the sky
Fatal attraction, you lay down and die
Know how you get, I know you do it
