		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Headin' for the islands
We're ready man and packed to go
When we hit those islands
There's gonna be a big hello
Diggin' all the sunshine
It's easy not to say goodbye
Bye, bye, bye
Headin' for the islands
Hey yeah, we're really flyin' high
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home
Walking down the beaches
Tomorrow morning we'll be there
Golden, sandy beaches
Say, I can smell the breezy air
One more celebration
And then we're ready for goodbye
Bye, bye, bye
Walking down the beaches
Hey yeah, we're really flyin' high
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Going back home
Going back home
Going back home
Going back home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home
