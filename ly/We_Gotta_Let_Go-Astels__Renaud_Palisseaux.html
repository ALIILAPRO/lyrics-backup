		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is how I gotta feel it
This is how we gotta feel it but come on
We gotta let go
This is how I gotta feel it
This is how we gotta feel it but come on
We gotta let go

Groovy master
There's something in the air when he comes around
(Comes around, yeah)
Baby tonight
(Tonight)
I'll be my Bill like I got hands on the keys
(On the keys, oh no)

Bluesy verse, major key could it be worse?
But I wanna play it along with those block chords
Haughty mood, they never look like they should
But how could D and E not do it right?

This is how I gotta feel it
This is how we gotta feel it but come on
We gotta let go
This is how I gotta feel it
This is how we gotta feel it but come on
We gotta let go
This is how I gotta feel it
This is how we gotta feel it but come on
We gotta let go
This is how I gotta feel it
This is how we gotta feel it but come on
We gotta let go

A gifted trumpet player
Always to much rehearsal cause it's how you always better, mh-mh
When I'll be back on the stage after the end of my break
I will go on with his favorite phrase

Bluesy verse, minor key miss you so much?
But I wanna play it along with my block chords (block chords)
Haughty mood, they never look like they should
But how could D and E not do it right, ah

This is how I gotta feel it
This is how we gotta feel it but come on
We gotta let go
This is how I gotta feel it
This is how we gotta feel it but come on
We gotta let go
This is how I gotta feel it
This is how we gotta feel it but come on
We gotta let go
This is how I gotta feel it
This is how we gotta feel it but come on
We gotta let go
This is how I gotta feel it
This is how we gotta feel it but come on
We gotta let go
