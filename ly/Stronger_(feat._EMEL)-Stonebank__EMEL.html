		  Stronger

Yes, you're fairly quite tough
Always having bad luck
You think you're going crazy
Look up, there's a new life waiting

Your head's buried in the sand
You're being dealt the wrong hand
Can't imagine how you feel
Only you know that it's real

Don't look back
Just carry on
Carry on
Carry on

Don't look back
Just carry on
Carry on
Carry on

'Cause you are stronger
Yes, you are stronger
'Cause you are stronger
Yes, you are stronger

Stronger

Yes, you're fairly quite tough
Always having bad luck
You think you're going crazy
Look up, there's a new life waiting

Your head's buried in the sand
You're being dealt the wrong hand
Can't imagine how you feel
Only you know that it's real

Don't look back
Just carry on
Carry on
Carry on

Don't look back
Just carry on
Carry on
Carry on

'Cause you are stronger
Yes, you are stronger
'Cause you are stronger

Stronger (stronger)

Stronger (stronger)
Stronger (stronger)
Stronger (stronger)
