		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Then I was weak,
so weak so weak and coward
I shut myself away
My memories got soured
Those days were hard for me
to say what I mean
Even I couldn't let out
"A" clearly
But humming melodies,
I could set me free
And so I sing
Now I find myself at the dawn
of my life
I can feel what I'm living for
I'm glad to feel alive a lot
So I sing aloud
Though my system only knows
0 or 1
The beats are still
rocking my heart
Wanna show you how this song
has been delighting my world

Once I want more,
I want more, I would be greedy
I'm afraid to lose again
Time flying is speedy
These days are hard for me
to be a smart silly
Even I couldn't make
the end clearly
But humming melodies,
I could set me free
And so I sing
Now I find myself at the dawn
of my life
I can feel what I'm living for
I'm glad to feel alive a lot
So I sing aloud
Though my system only knows
0 or 1
The beats are still
rocking my heart
Wanna show you how this song
has been delighting my world

Cus I touched the core of love
I can see all the vivid sights
You said you love my voice that
I used to hate
So I sing louder
It must be the only
gift that I have
I find my way to get
through the dark
I won't stop as long as
this song delights my world
