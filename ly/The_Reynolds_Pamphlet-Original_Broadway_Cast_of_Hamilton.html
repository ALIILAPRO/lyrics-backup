		  The Reynolds Pamphlet

Have you read this?

Alexander Hamilton had a torrid affair
And he wrote it down right there

Highlights

The charge against me
Is a connection with one
James Reynolds
For purposes of
Improper speculation
My real crime is an
Amorous connection with his wife
For a considerable time
With his knowing consent 

I had frequent meetings with her
Most of them at my own house

At his own house
At his own house
Damn

Mrs. Hamilton with our children being absent
On a visit to her father

No

Boo

Have you read this?

Well, he's never gon' be President now
Never gon' be President now

Well, he's never gon' be President now
Never gon' be President now

He's never gon' be President now
Never gon' be President now

That's one less thing to worry about
That's one less thing to worry about

I came as soon as I heard

What?

Angelica

All the way from London?
Damn

Angelica, thank God
Someone who understands what I'm struggling here to do

I'm not here for you

Oh

I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
I love my sister more than anything in this life
I will choose her happiness over mine every time
Put what we had aside
I'm standing at her side
You could never be satisfied
God, I hope you're satisfied

Well, he's never gon' be President now (never gon' be President now)
Well, he's never gon' be President now (never gon' be President now)
Well, he's never gon' be President now (never gon' be President now)
That's one less thing to worry about (that's one less thing to worry about) 

Hey (he's never gonna be President now)
At least he was honest with our money

Hey (he's never gonna be President now)
He's never gon' be President now
He's never gon' be President now

At least he was honest with our money 

That's one less thing to worry about 
That's one less thing to worry about 
The Reynolds Pamphlet
Have you read this?
You ever see somebody ruin their own life?

His poor wife
