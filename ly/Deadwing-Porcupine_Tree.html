		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And something warm and soft just passed through here
It took the precious things that I hold dearer
It rifles through the grey and disappeared
The creeping darkness makes the small hours clearer

Like a cancer scare
In a dentist's chair
Sucking in the air
Wire across the stair
Kicking down the door
At your local store
When your world of bore
Forces through the floor
Unexpected news
Wearing high-heeled shoes
Blowing out the fuse
Paying all your dues
Tempering lullaby
Like a fractured tied
It's a worthless lie
To the public eye

I don't take waifs and strays back home with me
My bleeding heart does not extend to charity

Yes, I'd have to say I like my privacy

Did you know you're on closed-circuit TV?
So smile at me

And a dream you had
Of your mom and dad
On a beach somewhere
And the boys aren't there
With the cancer threat
In a cigarette
Tempering lullaby
Find a place to hide

And from the yellow windows of the last train
A specter from the next life breathes his bargain of pain
I look with you into the speeding black rain
Afraid to touch someone, afraid to ask her for a name

And in the morning when I find I've lost you
I throw a window open wide and step through
