		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never wanna get you alone (hmm)
I'm scared of even standin' too close, babe (teah)
Get nervous when you light up my phone
But I like it
Yeah, I like it

In the car (in the car)
On the beach (watching me)
Lookin' at you when you look back at me (look back at me)
Feel my heart (feel my heart)
Skip a beat (ooh)
Think you know what I mean

But I don't wanna say too much, I don't wanna fuck this up
Why would we fall in love when it feels so good to touch?
Feel the way my cheeks go blush
Why would we fall in love when it feels so good to crush?
Crush (hahaha)
Crush
When it feels so good, ooh

Love Island is my favorite show
If we were on, I'd give you a rose, babe
Blow kisses turn around and go home (ah-ah)
'Cause I like it (I like it)
Yeah, I like it (ooh)

In the car (in the car)
On the beach (on the beach)
Lookin' at you when you look back at me (ooh)
Feel my heart (feel my heart)
Skip a beat (ooh)
Think you know what I mean

But I don't wanna say too much, I don't wanna fuck this up (babe)
Why would we fall in love when it feels so good to touch?
Feel the way my cheeks go blush (ooh)
Why would we fall in love when it feels so good to crush? (Crush)
Crush (crush)
Crush
When it feels so good, ooh

Tell me you're nervous when we say goodnight
Am I on your mind like you're on my mind?
Tell me you're nervous, lookin' in my eyes
Am I on your mind like you're on my mind?

But I don't wanna say too much, I don't wanna fuck this up
Why would we fall in love when it feels so good to touch?
Feel the way my cheeks go blush (blush)
Why would we fall in love when it feels so good to (to)
Crush?
Crush
Crush
When it feels so good to
Crush?
Crush (okay)
Crush
'Cause it feels so good, ooh
