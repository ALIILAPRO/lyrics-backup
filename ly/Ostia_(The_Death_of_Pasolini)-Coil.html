		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's honey in the hollows
And the contours of the body
A sluggish golden river
A sickly golden trickle
A golden, sticky trickle

You can hear the bones humming
You can hear the bones humming
And the car reverses over
The body in the basin
In the shallow sea-plane basin

And the car reverses over
And his body rolls over
Crushed from the shoulder
You can hear the bones humming
Singing like a puncture
Singing like a puncture

Killed to keep the world turning
Killed to keep the world turning
Killed to keep the world turning

Throw his bones over
The white cliffs of Dover
And into the sea, the sea of Rome
And the bloodstained coast of Ostia

Leon like a lion
Sleeping in the sunshine
Lion lies down
Lion lies down
Out of the strong came forth sweetness
Out of the strong came forth sweetness

Throw his bones over
The white cliffs of Dover
And murder me in Ostia
And murder me in Ostia
The sea of Rome
And the bloodstained coast

And the car reverses over
The white cliffs of Dover
And into the sea, the sea of Rome

You can hear the bones humming
You can hear the bones humming
You can hear the bones humming

Throw his bones over
The white cliffs of Dover
And into the sea, the sea of Rome

And murder me in Ostia
