		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You felt me broken
Was i mistaken
Thinking you'd push me awake
To be breathing and living and happy like everyone do
You just felt different
Was i mistaken
Thinking  you felt the same
Didn't need no scene out of a movie but you and just you
It made me feel safe overtime
That you'd chuckle
Like nobodys watching
A little obnoxious
but thats just the thing that felt right
That felt right about you

It was all perfect
In my civic
Not worth shit
Had nothing too crazy but
Crazy how perfect and Kodak it felt
We didnt know shit
But that made it worth it
All i had wanted was you and thats it but you didn't oh well
You're just a liar
Sweet liar
You're just a liar
Sweet liar

Do i regret it
I don't really know
Was the love that you poured on me warmer then blood dripping off of me cold
It made me feel safe overtime
That you'd chuckle
Like nobodys watching
A little obnoxious
But thats just the thing that felt right
That felt right about you

It was all perfect
In my civic
not worth shit
had nothing too crazy but
Crazy how perfect and Kodak it felt
We didnt know shit
But that made it worth it
All i had wanted was you and thats it but you didn't oh well
