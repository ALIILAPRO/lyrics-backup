Ba-ba-ra-ra, ba-ba-ra-ra, ba-ba-ra-ra
Yummy, yummy love

Watch out, I'ma coming to get you, it feels so right
Yeah, yeah
Look at what you started, you got me, you make me try
I tell ya
I caught you looking at me
You got me working like this, like this, like this
Try getting out of my grip
When you got me working like this, like this, ah-ah-ah-ah

Ski-pi-di-bap, bi-pap, bi-pap, boo
You got into my heart, this girl is on fire
Ski-pi-di-bap, bi-pap, bi-pap, boo
Your time's up, save it for later
Ski-pi-di-bap, bi-pap, bi-pap, boo
You got into this heart, it's down to the wire
Ski-pi-di-bap, bi-pap, bi-pap, boo

Thinking that you're into the feeling, so why deny?
Yeah
I can see right through you, I'm on your mind
I'll tell ya
Take a little chill pill, now and relax, huh
Livin' for the motto, hakuna matata
I wonder, what you're looking after
I want to tap that

Are you ready for love like this?
Are you ready for love like this?
Are you ready for yummy, yummy love?

Come, come, come on out to play
Sun is shining bright today
Yummy, yummy love, love
Are you gonna go my way?
Oh, or are you gonna stay?
