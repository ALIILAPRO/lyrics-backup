		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Swerving through the street
Drunk as fuck
Searching for a open store
I think I'm out of luck
Maybe I'll find a mad mother on patrol

Hit her car
Smash it up
Pull her out
Beat her up
Take her money
Run her down

Can't find any beer
It's way past two
There's just one thing
We can do

Hit her car
Smash it up
Pull her out
Beat her up
Take her money
Run her down
Drive her face out of town

Drunk drivers against mad mothers
