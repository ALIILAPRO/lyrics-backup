		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Man I'm so sick and tired of people telling me shit
Oh were you talking to me sorry I'm not listening
You told me your take on life I guess were different
I guess I don't understand why you stay innocent
3AM coming home yeah I'm wasted
Sneaking in sneaking in through the basement
And upstairs yeah my mom and dad are waiting
Yeah I know what they'll pro'ly end up saying
Don't lie to me I know your breath
Smells like a mix of alcohol weed and cigarettes
You're way too young to be playing with death
You better slow it down or you're gonna be next
Don't lie to me I know your breath
Smells like a mix of alcohol weed and cigarettes
You're way too young to be playing with death
You better slow it down or you're gonna be next
Thought I knew better than this
Never knew how much pressure it is
Just to be a role model
I took the parties full throttle
In my footsteps who followed
Didn't think my brother would
Fuck I misunderstood
I hate to think that he got in this shit because his brother could
I'm supposed to show him better things but I ain't doing good
I just caught him sneaking out
I sat him down and broke it down
Just like how a brother should
Don't lie to me I know your breath
Smells like a mix of alcohol weed and cigarettes
You're way too young to be playing with death
You better slow it down or you're gonna be next
Don't lie to me I know your breath
Smells like a mix of alcohol weed and cigarettes
You're way too young to be playing with death
You better slow it down or you're gonna be next
