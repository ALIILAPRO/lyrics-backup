		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you want to know how to fly high
Then go now to the place
Where all the concubines meet
And converse with them
Marvel at their pale skin
Wonder how they chew on their pointy

Teeth and hair are beauty
They know it's their duty
To be Countess in their hearts
And their minds that have to whisper
See in them a sister
Look into their eyes and you'll be a

Transylvanian concubine
You know what flows here like wine
Stay here with us, it's just time
Transylvanian concubine

Sorrow is their master
Cackling with laughter
Now he's having just one piece of
Cakey is their make up
Catholics try to shake up
All the things that form their lives but they're dead

Their sighs their song
They know what they do is wrong
Stay here with us, it's just time
Transylvanian concubine

Candelabras lighted
Satan has been sighted
Never has there been an evening like
This is what they wanted
Always to feel hunted
You can never be to rich or too thin

The blood had run out
Fangs ruin any cute pout
Morning has come now they've flown
What have you learned from what has been shown?

Transylvanian concubine
You know what flows there like wine
Stay here with us, it's just time
Transylvanian concubine

Transylvanian concubine
You know what flows there like wine
Stay here with us, it's just time
Transylvanian concubine

You know what flows there like wine
