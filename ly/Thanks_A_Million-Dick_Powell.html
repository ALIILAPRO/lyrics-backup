		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thanks a million, a million thanks to you 
For everything that love could bring you brought me
Each tender love-word you happened to say
Is hidden away
In memory's bouquet
Thanks a million for I remember too 
The tenderness that your caresses taught me
You made a million dreams come true and so I'm saying
Thanks a million to you
 
Thanks a million, a million thanks to you 
For every thing that love could bring you brought me
Each tender love-word you happened to say
Is hidden away
In memory's bouquet
Thanks a million for I remember too 
The tenderness that your caresses taught me
You made a million dreams come true and so I'm saying
 Thanks a million to you
