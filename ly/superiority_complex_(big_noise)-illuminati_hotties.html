		<p>
		  good ear, brah!
superior!
oo! 
you're lucky that you spotted such good songs
or else
you'd have to learn how to get good at yr job
and so far 
you keep it cool whenever we talk real cloth

oh my god
are u a cop?
it's just 
I never seen you with a drink before
I mean I,
I never seen you take it easy before
so heads up I'm tossing you another Big Gulp, grah!

big noise
decoy
you want it?
you want a real shot cowboy?
big noise 
decoy
you want me? 
you want the real stuff, real noise


first I made frenemies 
made me a lotta frenemies
now I owe em 7 stax 
and won't even get the circle P
so pretty please
ain't it easy when yr eating from the fists of all the young guns
who hardly ever thought they could be

big noise
decoy
they want it
they want a real shot cowboy
big noise 
decoy
you want me? 
you want the real stuff, real noise
