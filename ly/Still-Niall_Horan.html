		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My mind is complicated
Find it hard to rearrange it
But I'll have to find a way somehow
Overreacting lately
Find it hard to say I'm sorry
But I'll make it up to you somehow

And I just don't know why
The stars won't shine at night

Tell me you want it
A thousand miles away from the day that we started
But I'm standing here with you just tryna be honest
If honesty means telling you the truth
Well, I'm still in love with you

Did I miscalculate this?
Let's just go back to basics
Forget about what's come and gone
'Cause I hate to see us like this
Breaking up on nights just like this
We should be shooting for them stars of gold

So tell me you want it
A thousand miles away from the day that we started
But I'm standing here with you just tryna be honest
If honesty means telling you the truth
Then I guess we lost our focus
And it's killing me that we could go to war like this
But I'm standing here with you just tryna be honest
If honesty means telling you the truth
Well I'm still in love with you

Oh, we'll be alright
Oh, it'll be alright
Oh, we'll be alright
Oh, it'll be alright

So tell me you want it
A thousand miles away from the day that we started
But I'm standing here with you just tryna be honest
If honesty means telling you the truth
I guess we lost our focus
And it's killing me that we could go to war like this
But I'm standing here with you just tryna be honest
If honesty means telling you the truth
Well I'm still in love with you
