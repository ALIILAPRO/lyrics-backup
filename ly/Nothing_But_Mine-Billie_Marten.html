		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rest your head
Over mine, I have faith in our love
Wash my mouth
Empty out, all the dirt that you found

You are nothing but mine
And I'll take no one but you
You are nothing but mine
And I'll take no one but you

Dust me off, fix me up
I don't want what I was
And lock it up and keep it there
It's no good and nowhere

You are nothing but mine
And I'll take no one but you
You are nothing but mine
And I'll take no one but you

And don't you take my heart and break it
Be my friend
There is no other way to say it
'Cause you got me again
Don't you take my heart and break it
Be my friend
There is no other way to say it
'Cause you got me again
'Cause you got me again

Rest your head
Over mine, I have faith in our love
