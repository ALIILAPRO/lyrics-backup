		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's time to loosen up your tie now
You've gotta loosen up somehow
You're making everybody else frown
When you're never getting down
'Cause you should simply come along
Stop thinking "What is wrong?"
'Cause if you try to find another attitude
You're ready for a good time
You will be ready for a good time

I've been waiting so long for you to go crazy
Let me get right to the point, get busy boy!
Punk disco, punk punk disco
Yeah, I get right to the point, little busy boy
Punk disco, punk punk disco
'Cause I know you know my name
But let the person outshine the fame
And let the diva reign supreme
'Cause I can make you scream
Baby I'm your living dream!

You could check me out in secret
Or you can tell me that you're interested
Kinda' think the wait is boring
Someone else might come along
'Cause I don't know what's on your mind 
Or at what point in time
You'll make your move and finally prove
That you're ready for a good time
Yeah, that you're ready for a good time...
