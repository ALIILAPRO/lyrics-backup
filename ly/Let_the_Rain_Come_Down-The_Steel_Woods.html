		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We all need rain. Lord, the sun sure stings
Somebody string a rattlesnake up
Good Lord, my whole world ran dry the that wicked ol' witch said bye

She put a curse on me, one on the river, and now my crops don't grow no more
I've got a hollow heart, a pocket full of nothing
My soul won't rest and my eyes won't pour
Let The Rain Come Down

I should've been long gone, cold turkey
Now I'm sitting on the front porch stoned
Looking back, Lord, the past was murky
It ain't no wonder why my money's all gone

She put a curse on me, one on the river, and now my crops don't grow no more
I've got a hollow heart, a pocket full of nothing
My soul won't rest and my eyes won't pour
Let The Rain Come Down

Look yonder to the west, I can feel it in my bones
Here comes a hard Rain, just a blacking out the sky
I'd run for shelter, if I wasn't me
Better pay heed to the past, or wind up dry
