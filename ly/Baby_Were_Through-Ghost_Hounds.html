		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  BABY WE'RE THROUGH, BABY WE'RE THROUGH 
NOTHIN' YOU SAY, NOTHIN' YOU DO 
CAN'T MAKE THOSE LIES YOU TELL COME TRUE 
OH BABY WE'RE THROUGH (OH BABY) 

BABY WE'RE DONE, I SAID YOU AIN'T THE ONE 
I THOUGHT YOU WERE BUT I KNOW YOU AIN'T
 BEEN SLEEPIN' WITH THE DEVIL NOW IT'S WAY TOO LATE 
OH BABY WE'RE DONE, I SAID WE'RE DONE AND DONE 
BABY WE'RE DONE 

BABY WE'RE THROUGH, I'M ALL DONE WITH YOU 
AIN'T NOTHIN' YOU SAY GON' CHANGE MY MIND
MY LOVE IS TRUE BUT IT AIN'T BLIND 
OH BABY WE'RE THROUGH 
I SAID BABY WE'RE THROUGH 

DON'T YOU SAY GOODBYE, NO TEARS TO CRY 
YOU GO YOUR WAY, I GO MINE
 AIN'T NO GOIN' BACK THIS TIME 
OH BABY WE'RE THROUGH 
DON'T YOU SAY GOODBYE 
LET ME SEE YOU CRY, CRY, CRY 
DON'T YOU SAY GOODBYE 

YOU HIT ME ONE TIME 
IT HURT SO BAD 
YOU HIT ME TWO TIMES
 THEN YOU HIT ME THREE TIMES 
BABE, YOU HIT ME FIVE TIMES 

NOTHIN' LEFT TO SAY, I SAID TODAY'S THE DAY
SAME OLD LIES, HEARD EM ALL BEFORE
 TAKE WHAT YOU GOT AND GET OFF THAT DOOR 
OH BABY WE'RE THROUGH 
OH BABY WE'RE THROUGH 
(THROUGH AND THROUGH) 
BABY WE'RE THROUGH 
YOU SAID I SAY GOODBYE 
BABY, BABY 
BABY, BABY 
THROUGH, THROUGH
