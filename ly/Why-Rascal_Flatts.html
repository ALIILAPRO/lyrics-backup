		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You must've a been in a place so dark, couldn't feel the light
Reachin' for you through that stormy cloud
Now here we are gathered in our little home town
This can't be the way you meant to draw a crowd

Oh why, that's what I keep askin'
Was there anything I could have said or done
Oh I, had no clue you were masking a troubled soul, God only knows
What went wrong, and why you'd leave the stage in the middle of a song

Now in my mind I keep you frozen as a seventeen year old
Roundin' third to score that winning run
You always played with passion no matter what the game
When you took the stage you shined just like the sun

Oh why, that's what I keep askin'
Was there anything I could have said or done
Oh I, had no clue you were masking a troubled soul, God only knows
What went wrong, and why you'd leave the stage in the middle of a song

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Now the oak trees are swayin' in the early autumn breeze
The golden sun is shining on my face
The tangled thoughts I hear a mockingbird sing
This old world really ain't that bad a place

Oh why there's no comprehending
And who am I to try to judge or explain
Oh, but I do have one burning question
Who told you life wasn't worth the fight
They were wrong
They lied
And now you're gone
And we cried

'Cause It's not like you, to walk away in the middle of a song

Your beautiful song
Your absolutely beautiful song
