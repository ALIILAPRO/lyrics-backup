		  Ahahum, Ahahum

Ahahum, Ahahum

Must be the reason why I'm king of my castle
Must be the reason why I'm free in my threshold
Must be the reason why I'm king of my castle
Must be the reason why I'm making examples of you

Must be the reason why I'm king of my castle (Ahahum)
Must be the reason why I'm free in my threshold
Must be the reason why I'm king of my castle
Must be the reason why I'm making examples of you

Ahahum, Ahahum

Must be, the reason, why I'm king of 
Must be, the reason, why I'm king of 

Must be the reason why I'm king of my castle (Ahahum)
Must be the reason why I'm free in my threshold
Must be the reason why I'm king of my castle
Must be the reason why I'm making examples of you

Ahahum, Ahahum

Must be the reason why I'm king of my castle
Must be the reason why I'm free in my threshold
Must be the reason why I'm king of my castle
Must be the reason why I'm making examples of you

Must be the reason why I'm king of my castle
Must be the reason why I'm free in my threshold
Must be the reason why I'm king of my castle
Must be the reason why I'm making examples of you

Must be the reason why I'm king of my castle
Must be the reason why I'm free in my threshold
Must be the reason why I'm king of my castle
Must be the reason why I'm making examples of you
