		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, turn everything up
Yeah, oh yeah
Turn everything up a little more

I want my baby to have your eyes
I'm going against my own advice
Should I do New York? I can't decide
Fashion week is more your thing than mine
I can't even lie, I'd rather stay inside
I can't do suit and tie
Can't be in a room with you and stand on different sides
One thing at a time
I have to learn to hide
One thing at a time
Emotions running high
I wish you felt alright

Just hitting my line
All the time, all the time, all the
You stay on my mind
All the time, all the time (yeah)

It takes some finesse
I seen you finesse
He can't know finesse
You stay on my mind

You and your sister
Too hot to handle
Things will get cancelled
I would make time for you
Commitment
Going the distance
I'm new to all of this

It takes some finesse
I seen you finesse
He can't know finesse
You stay on my mind

(You stay on my mind
Girl, you know that you stay
On my mind)
