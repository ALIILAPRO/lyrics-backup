		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now I'm a grey old ghost
Weeping in winter trees
And searching for a soul
Waiting for a voice to come

She was worth dying for
It is my severed woes I cry
Her eyes were pale like dawn
Out of this gloomy light

I'll wait there forevermore
The light holds us forever more
Still one second I wouldn't give away
Cold winter nights, I cry on your grave
Why won't you come?
Why won't you come?

As she is dying in the snow
The moonlight silently glows
Her tears flow down her cheek
When snow falls from the trees

I'll wait there forevermore
The light holds us forever more
Still one second I wouldn't give away
Cold winter nights, I cry on your grave
Why won't you come?
Why won't you come?
