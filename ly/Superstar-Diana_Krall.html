		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Long ago and oh so far away
I fell in love with you, before the second show
Your guitar, it sounds so sweet and clear
But you're not really here
It's just the radio

Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby
You said you'd be coming back this way again
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby, I love you I really do

Loneliness is a such a sad affair
And I can hardly wait to be with you again

What to say to make you come again
Come back to me again
And play a sad guitar

Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby
You said you'd be coming back this way again
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby
I love you, I really do, I love you, I really do
