		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  With my lil' ho, she special
Get her the diamonds, they came with a bezel
Yeah, she a rider, I gave her a medal
She my lil' shawty, I know she a rebel
I know that she feelin' the kid
See the young nigga, it's makin' her heavy
Pop out with my bitch
My new girl, they see us, I know that they envy
Ayy, she a thot, my lil' baby, uh
I got racks in the safety, uh
Niggas cap, they fugazi
And when I'm around, I'm drivin' her crazy, baby
Be my lady, uh, fuck it
We hop in Mercedes, huh
I know that you tryna date me
She fell in love and it's makin' her hazy, uh
With my lil' ho, she special
Get her the diamonds, they came with a bezel
Yeah, she a rider, I gave her a medal
She my lil' shawty, I know she a rebel
I know that she feelin' the kid
See the young nigga, it's makin' her heavy
Pop out with my bitch
My new girl, they see us, I know that they envy
She a thot, my lil' baby, uh
I got racks in the safety, uh
Niggas cap, they fugazi
And when I'm around, I'm drivin' her crazy, baby
Be my lady, uh, fuck it
We hop in Mercedes, huh
I know that you tryna date me
She fell in love and it's makin' her hazy, uh
She a thot, my lil' baby, uh
I got racks in the safety, uh
Niggas cap, they fugazi
And when I'm around, I'm drivin' her crazy, baby
Be my lady, uh, fuck it
We hop in Mercedes, huh
I heard that you tryna date me
She fell in love and it's makin' her hazy, uh
