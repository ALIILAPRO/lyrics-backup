		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Little girl, if you're feeling low
And you got no place to go
Just give me a ring, some joy I will bring
'Cause I ain't got nothin' but time

Well, I ain't got nothin' but time
So baby, if you wanna shine
If you take time to look, my number's in the book
And you can call me any time

I'm footloose and I'm fancy free
So baby, just come along with me
Grab your dancin' shoes, we'll go and lose them blues
'Cause I ain't got nothin' but time

If you say so babe, we'll stay all night
Don't worry, 'cause I ain't got no wife
Any time you wanna go, good gal, just let me know
'Cause I ain't got nothin' but time

No use to sit at home and fine
And let someone trouble your mind
Just come along with me, there's more fish in the sea
And I ain't got nothin' but time

Now baby, just come on and smile
You'll find that life is still worth while
If you just look around and watch the fellars in this town
That for you ain't got nothin' but time

Lord, I ain't got nothin' but time
So baby, if you wants to shine
If you take time to look, my number's in the book
And you can call me any time
