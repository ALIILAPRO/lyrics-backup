		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You left me bleeding out when I was down, I had to heal myself
Got a lot of friends, but I feel alone, only one I hear is myself
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, not a single soul I could tell
I look around, I got everything, but I'm still livin' in hell, uh
Talkin' to the voices in my head, let 'em tell it, I'd be better dead
Pour a cup of my problems out, and I smoke a zip of my regrets
M-O-B, money over sex, 'til I D-I-E, boy, I need my checks
Walkin' out on me, cut deep, I been scarred since the day you left

I'm over waiting on you
I told you I'm over waiting on you
You can have it your way
Yeah, you don't have a place in my heart no more
It's time to go separate ways
'Cause I'm over waiting on you, yeah

Cuts too deep for a Band-Aid, with my new bitch thinkin' old things
'Cause after how you left me, I won't ever trust these bitches again
Paranoia on my mind, I can't help but I won't change
Ben Frank the only one I know in this whole world that won't fail
Runnin' and runnin' in circles with you, you keep on doing the same shit again
I swear that you left me no other choice, I cannot look at these bitches the same
I cannot look at all bitches the same, I take your heart, now I'm taking your name
The way that you ran my heart into the grave, I guess I have to charge up to the game

I'm over waiting on you
I told you I'm over waiting on you
You can have it your way
Yeah, you don't have a place in my heart no more
It's time to go separate ways
'Cause I'm over waiting on you
