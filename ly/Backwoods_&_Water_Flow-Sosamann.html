		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Be safe oh
Know what I'm saying? Sosamann in the, huh
(JRag on the beat, 'Bout that bag, man)
Nah,  for su-sure (And the rag,  man)
Ayy ooh (O oh)
Yeah (yeah) ayy (Ayy)
Know what I'm saying? Ooh (O oh)
Yeah (yeah) hey (Hey, hey)
Know what I'm saying? Nah, shit, shit
I'ma keep this going running
All the way through ooh (O oh)

First of all, let me set something straight
I have just awaked (Huh?)
I'm a beast, you are just a leaf
You just might get raked
Keep a K, seen a opp
Made his family dig a grave (O oh)
Go gorilla, ain't no ape, you see
The DK on my face, ayy
Ooh, asked him four times two, he got ate
(Pew, pew) i just seen the narcs, I
Breaked fast, jumped the gate, ooh
(Huh?Yoom) ice like water parks, diamonds
Splash, jumping lakes, ooh
(Splash) like on Watchdog, make that
Bitch a frozen case, ayy
(Cold) ooh, I can't leave the house
Without the blammer thing
(With the blammer thing)
Every day in LA, yeah
We jammin' like new hammer thing
(Huh? For real)
Walked up in the place, seen a opp
He start panicking had it on my waist
He ain't move like a mannequin (What?)
Ooh, at the trap place, let no cameras in
(Oh, no)
I can't tell our moves 'cause the feds
Might try to run on in (Huh?)
Teach him like a school, he my son
I'm his parent then (O oh)
Run him off the stage while he
Perform but I ain't no sandman (No)
Ayy (Ayy) , lil' bih' ass on OMG (Oh my God)
I'm with wolf pack and four
Eaters on the Mexican beach (Olé)
I got bad bih' mamacita and she feeding me
I'm a big dog, so you know I be oversea
Ayy, yeah, ooh, be oversea
I done seen a snake, killed the fake
Put him on my feet you dabbing for bait
Ain't no rat but I keep that cheese
Ain't worried 'bout no crazy because we
Strapped up with that ovary, grrt
(Grrt)

Nah, for sure nah, for su-sure (Poof)
Oh, yeah, really lit, yeah, I
Really keep this shit, uh huh
I done had to God damn get water, then
(JRag on the beat)
Enough Backwoods, huh, for su-sure
He say, ooh

I told the bih' that she fine
Took her to my home then
I jumped right behind
Big girl, had me some chicken, some fries
These the Diors, hell nah, nigga
Don't do the FILAs
I'm a big dog, no canine
I ain't hear shit
They be coming through the fake vine
I just beat a case and I got no time
I'ma get money then put that
Lil' shit on rewind, ooh
I'ma sip drank, no ethanol
Bih' passing out like she did Par-fentanyl
Nigga making cash before rap
Check my catalogue
Up all night like I took me a Adderall
Don't smoke regular plug hit the cellular
Told me he had a brick in the box
Color Manila told him, "One minute
Let a nigga check the schedule"
Damn, I gotta go meet with
The bih' down in Canada
Ooh, now I'm in Toronto
Higher then a penthouse
Sitting in the condo'
Came from the jungle, no Congo
And the bih' ate on the
Dick like a lunch bowl
Told her bring the cash, do it pronto
I'ma splash in the Dior poncho
Knock him out, I don't do the Royal Rumble
Nigga ran with the pack and never did fumble
Ooh
Sitting in the trap, eating shrimp fried rice
And that bih' rolling like new
Set of baby dice had me a lick and that boy
He wasn't acting right
Nigga, he try me, I send him to paradise
Lil' mama, she suck like a parasite
On my wood just like a termite
Diamonds shine like light
And, no, I don't hang with no mice
I just want the money
That's my only appetite, ayy
I was down and out but I came real far
Nigga throw the pack, yeah
I'm feeling like Brett Favre
If you don't eat it, so must let you starve
I'm a big shot just like Charles
Walk on the stage, get applause
I pulled some strings like I play the guitar
I remember taking off on cop cars
One thing for sure, I'ma make the
Lil' bitch stay on her job, ayy

Stay on your job ayy, bitch, stay on your
No, I'll stop oh, for su-sure
Let me hit
