		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Grey stares beneath the moon
Tonight I'll be dreaming of you
People and rhythm instead
And there you'll be there you'll be inside my head

Hmm, I will dream of you
Hmm, you'll dream of me too
Hmm, your hands, they're on my face
Hmm, there would be no better place

Some miracle man must have shot me while I wake.
I never ran fast enough oh my mistakes
Would you really want me in the light of day
That very same man, shot flaws right through my face

Hmm, I will dream of you
Hmm, you'll dream of me too
Hmm, your arms curled round my waist
Hmm, there would be no better place

Could you have your arms around my
Could you have your arms around my
