		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So you find yourself at this subway
When your world in a bag by your side
And all at once it seemed like a good way
You realized its the end of your life
For what it's worth

Here comes the train upon the track
And there goes the pain it cuts to black
Are you ready for the last act?
To take a step you can't take back

Take in all the punches you could take
Took 'em all right on your chest
Now the countless back is breaking
Again, again
For what it's worth

Here comes the train upon the track
And there goes the pain it cuts to black
Are you ready for the last act?
To take a step you can't take back

Did she love you?
Did she take you down?
Was she on her knees when she kissed your crown?
Tell me what you found

Here comes the rain, so hold your hat
And don't pray to God, cause He won't talk back
Are you ready for the last act?
To take a step you can't take back
Back, back, back
You can't take back
Back, back, back

So you find yourself at this subway
When your world in a bag by your side
