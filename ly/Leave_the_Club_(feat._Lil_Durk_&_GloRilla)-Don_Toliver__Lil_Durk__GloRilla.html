		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Buss it open, show me babe
(Ooh, baby, please)
Buss it open, show me babe
(Ooh, baby, please)
Buss it for a real player
(Ooh, baby, please)
I want you how I want you
(Ooh, baby, please)

Oh, oh, oh (yeah, yeah)
I wanna leave the club right now (right now, yeah)
Tell you niggas in the cut to pipe down (pipe down)
(I wanna leave the club right now)
She want me to the upside down (yeah)
(I wanna leave the club right now)
She a freak when you're not around
You pulled up tipsy, oh, yeah
I ain't gotta take it to the head (let's go)
She doin' whatever to get in my bed
Got me like, "here we go again" (yeah)
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
I wanna leave the club right now, babe
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
I wanna leave the club right now
I'm feelin' this shit is thumpin'
But I'm finna get you out of here (get you out of here)
Don't know how you got to the function (get you out of here)
But I'm finna get you out of here (out of here)

(Ooh, baby, please)
Buss it open, show me babe
(Ooh, baby, please)
Buss it for a real player
(Ooh, baby, please)
I want you how I want you
(Ooh, baby, please)

Smurk
V.I.P., I'm off the mud right now
My bitch text my phone "leave the club right now"
Make excuse, the kids need me, I'ma do it right now
Quarter ticket for the backend, goin' to court right now
They sayin', gotta watch their stories
Told me if I lied, then she probably tryna lure me
Your friends over there, when I pull up we havin' orgies
I don't care if your finsta page private, don't record me, 'cord me
Smurk, richard my arm
I can't fuck a bitch who said some slick shit to don
No cash on me, I just had a scammer get a room
Innocent in the club, but she wanna try shrooms
Uh, I want a cougar, thirsty to leave, I'ma hop in a uber
If you ever heard I fucked your friends, that's a rumour
But I we ain't leavin' the club right now, fuck

(Ooh, baby, please)
Buss it open, show me babe
(Ooh, baby, please)
Bust it for a real player

Bet up on my rose and I'm 'bout to leave the section
See me here for hours, I left the club with extras
Speedin' down that highway, lookin' kinda reckless
One hand on that wheel, got one hand on the tecs

If I text you "where you at?", You got two minutes 'fore you miss out (where you at?)
Come on drunk as hell, I'm like "you better have that dick out" (come here)
We finna sign this pussy, that's a warnin', you might slip out
Get backshots from my whoopty-woop, my nigga think I'm still out
He dick me down and take my soul, he tryna make me stalk him (phew)
Little do he know after I leave I'm finna block him
Niggas gon' be niggas, who the fuck am I to stop 'em?
Ayy, book me for a show, it's forty k for me to rock out on the gang

Ask me for a real player, ask, ask me for a real player
A-ask me for a real player
