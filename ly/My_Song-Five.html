		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So here's ho wit started, it started with a beat
A beat in my head and it wouldn't go away
So I added a bass, the bass was fat
I played it to me boys on a 24 track, they like that
Ah the hand clap followed by the mic check
No time for dinner, five's out on the night shift
Shady eyes in the middle of the night
Into the dawn till the lyrics lock tight
On to the mix, tell the DJ quick Five boom

He kept playing my song on and on all night long 
Bip it up everybody, rip it up one time
Let me bring your rigidy rugged flow for
Your mind got what you need, let me break it down
Five on the low with the funk for your town
Down on the floor now let me see you move
This time tonight now it's time yo groove
Who got the champion sound understand
Rhyme for rhyme, Five on the low down

Like I said before, got the funk for your trunk
From the junk yard to the boulevard here we come
Ladies, lock tight woo with that straight

Five dead right party's over here we got the five boom
All night we made a hit, yet another home runner
And sweet sugar J got you hot like the summer so I'm
A stepping back and let the DJ bust the mix Five boom
Get down 
Get down
Get down
Get down
Get down
Get down
Get down

Like I said before, got the funk for your trunk
From the junk yard to the boulevard here we come
Ladies, lock tight woo with that straight

Baby bounce let me see you bounce to this
I've got the mic technique to help you use your ears
So you sit by the radio, hands on the dial
Soon Five on the jam time to pump up the volume
Another fly track to get down
Let me see you move, time for you to get down and prove it
Ain't no doubt that we're fly so don't deny

Like I said before, got the funk for your trunk
From the junk yard to the boulevard here we come
Ladies, lock tight woo with that straight
