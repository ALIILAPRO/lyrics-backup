		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know I'll feel this way forever
I know no one will beg to differ
Goodbye, so long, it's been a pleasure
Repeat this when I say that

[Bridge]
I don't want you to hate me
Oh no
I want you to want to hate me
I don't want you to date me
Oh no
I want you to want to date me

[Chorus]
I wanna pay for it
All of this shit
I wanna pay for it
Like a goddamn son of a bitch
I wanna pay for it
All of this shit
I wanna pay for it
Like a goddamn son of a bitch

Never gonna be perfect
No never gonna be
Never good enough
Not for me

I know I'll feel this way forever
No never gonna be
Never good enough
Not for me
I know no one will beg to differ
Repeat this when I say that

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Never gonna be perfect
No never gonna be
Never good enough
Not for me

I know I'll feel this way forever
No never gonna be
Never good enough
Not for me
I know no one will beg to differ

Too much of nothing never hurt me baby
It is aggressive that the message reads

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
