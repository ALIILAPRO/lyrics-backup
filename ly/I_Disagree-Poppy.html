		  Watashi wa anata ni dōi shimasen
Watashi wa anata ni dōi shimasen
Watashi wa anata ni dōi shimasen

I disagree, everything you believe is a tragedy
I disagree with the way you keep preaching insanity
I disagree with all of the reasons you're mad at me
I disagree, everything in your life is a tragedy

Down, let it all burn down
Burn it to the ground
We'll be safe and sound
When it all burns down
Let it all burn down
Burn it to the ground
We'll be safe and sound
When it all burns down

I disagree with the way you continue to pressure me
I disagree with the way you are failing to pleasure me
I disagree, everything is going how it's meant to be
I disagree with the way you continue to pressure me

Down, let it all burn down
Burn it to the ground
We'll be safe and sound
When it all burns down
Let it all burn down
Burn it to the ground
We'll be safe and sound
When it all burns down

If only all of you could see the world I see
Then maybe everyone could live in harmony
Watashi wa anata ni dōi shimasen
Watashi wa anata ni dōi shimasen
Watashi wa anata ni dōi shimasen
Watashi wa anata ni dōi shimasen

Down, let it all burn down
Burn it to the ground
We'll be safe and sound
When it all burns down
Let it all burn down
Burn it to the ground
We'll be safe and sound
When it all burns down
