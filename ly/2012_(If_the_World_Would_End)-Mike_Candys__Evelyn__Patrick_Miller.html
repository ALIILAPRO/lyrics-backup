		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And if the world would end tomorrow
We don't care tonight the night
And if the world would end tomorrow
Just put your hands up, and feel alright! Alright!

Put your hands up 2012
Aha, because we don't care tonight!
Just put your hands up and feel alright!
Oh, oh, oh 2012 when the world would end.
Oh, oh, oh 2012 when when we make this end

Maya said 2012 is the end
They think that's God's plan!
Explosion for waters so I guess we don't care what's to heal
We make it stand, never give up
Nobody can't stop that's right
So move to the top, that's how we roll
Don't mind, just keep on going
If the world would end tomorrow
Listen to the song that changes sorrow into joy
I wanna hear you make some noise!

Tonight is the night to be free
What is gonna happen?
We will see!
Cause you have to feel free
2012, just follow me!

And if the world would end tomorrow
We don't care tonight the night
And if the world would end tomorrow
Just put your hands up, and feel alright! Alright!

Oh, oh, oh, 2012 and the world will end
Oh, oh, oh, 2012 when we make this stand
Oh when the world will end
Cause we don`t care tonight
We make a stand
Put your hands up

And if the world would end tomorrow, tomorrow
We don't care tonight the night
And if the world would end tomorrow
Just put your hands up, and feel alright!
Yeah, let`s go!

Oh, oh, oh, 2012 and the world will end
2012 when we make this stand
Come on! Let's go!

2012 when we make this stand
