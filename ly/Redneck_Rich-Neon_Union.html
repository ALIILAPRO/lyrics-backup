		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ain't Elon musk
But I got a 1/4 inch socket trying to make
A rocket out of this truck
Ain't got a 40 foot yacht
But I got an old John boat
That'll float to my honey hole spot
Got a little green talking 'bout dollars
Yeah we're all gettin loaded in the holler

I work hard for my money
Don't owe a thing on a thing I own
Down on the farm with my honey
Honey drippin 24K gold
T bones and taters
Homegrown tomaters
And a Razor that'll jump that ditch
Got a million dollar blue eyed view
When I'm looking at you
In a sunset kiss
Can't put a price on paradise
Out here in the sticks
Yeah we're redneck rich

My pretty double wide queen
(She's the queen of my double wide trailer)
Top shelf hot as hell ice melt Crown Royal-T
We big ballin on a hillbilly budget
High rollin and we damn sure love it

I work hard for my money
Don't owe a thing on a thing I own
Down on the farm with my honey
Honey drippin 24K gold
T bones and taters
Homegrown tomaters
And a Razor that'll jump that ditch
Got a million dollar blue eyed view
When I'm looking at you
In a sunset kiss
Can't put a price on paradise
Out here in the sticks
Yeah we're redneck rich
Oh we're redneck rich

Spend it if you got it
Spend it if you got it
Spend it if you got it let it roll
Spend it if you got it
Spend it if you got it
Cause ya can't take it with ya when ya go

I work hard for my money
Don't owe a thing on a thing I own
Down on the farm with my honey
Honey drippin 24K gold
T bones and taters
Homegrown tomaters
And a Razor that'll jump that ditch
Got a million dollar blue eyed view
When I'm looking at you
In a sunset kiss
Can't put a price on paradise
Out here in the sticks
Long as I got Waylon and Willie and Cash 
That's good as it gets
Yeah we're redneck rich

Spend it if you got it
Spend it if you got it
Spend it if you got it let it roll
Spend it if you got it
Spend it if you got it
Cause ya can't take it with ya when ya go
