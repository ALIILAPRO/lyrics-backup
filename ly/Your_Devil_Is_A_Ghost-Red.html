		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take blood and light your fire
With every word you hear
Pass through a prism
Drain and scathe
Til I walk away
Destruction is

Here your devil is a ghost
A shadow from long ago
Still preying on the memory
Your devil is a ghost
A shadow from long ago
Still preying on the memory

Your victim spirit
Your suspicious mind
Won't let you hide it all
Drain and scathe
Til I run away
Salvation is

Here your devil is a ghost
A shadow from long ago
Still preying on the memory
Your devil is a ghost
A shadow from long ago
Still preying on the memory

In this revolution
Praying for revolution
In this revolution
Praying for revolution

Take blood and light your fire
With every word you hear

Your devil is a ghost
A shadow from long ago
Still preying on the memory
Your devil is a ghost
A shadow from long ago
Still preying on the memory

In this revolution
Praying for revolution, revolution
