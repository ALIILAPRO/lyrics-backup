		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A situation's taken over me
Can't you see
I'm in trouble?
Infatuation's got a hold on me
A little jealously
I'm not myself at all

I'm surrounded by confusion
And I'm lost in this illusion

You serenade me at the ball
Hiding from it all
Behind a disguise
Who's the man who's at the masquerade?
Wish I hadn't stayed
Just to drown in lies

Like the headline of a magazine, are you what you seem
Because I'm losing my belief?
Can I make it when there's so much doubt
Someone, help me out 'cause I'm in too deep

I'm surrounded by confusion
And I'm lost in this illusion

Follow my dreams into distant lands
Blowing in the winds over shifting sands

I'm in too deep

I'm surrounded by confusion
And I'm lost in this illusion
I'm surrounded by confusion
I'm so lost in this illusion
