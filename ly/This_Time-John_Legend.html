		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ran into you yesterday
Memories rushed through my brain
It's starting to hit me
Now you're not with me
I realize I made a mistake
I thought that I needed some space
But I just let love go to waste
It's so crystal clear now
That I need you here now
I gotta get you back today

This time I want it all
This time I want it all
Showing you all the cards
Giving you all my heart
This time I'll take the chance
This time I'll be your man
I can be all you need
This time it's all of me

I hit the bar every night
Looking to score a good time
It's not like I planned it
Left empty handed
'Cause I'm still alone in my mind
Now what will it take to feel right
Can I come see you tonight
Is there someone new now
What can I do now
'Cause I need you back by my side

This time I want it all
This time I want it all
Showing you all the cards
Giving you all my heart
This time I'll take the chance
This time I'll be your man
I can be all you need
This time it's all of me

Last time I wasn't sure
This time I will give you more
I'm more mature
I'll show you
Last time I didn't know
I messed up let her let you go
I need you, don't say no

Laying alone in this room
All that is missing is you
Pick up the phone
Won't you come home

This time I want it all
This time I want it all
I' m showing you all the cards
Giving you all my heart
This time I'll take the chance
This time I'll be your man
I can be all you need
This time it's all of me
All of me
