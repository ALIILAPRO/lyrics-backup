		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Half a glass of dirty water
Is all I need for today
Yes have a glass of dirty water
It sweeps my mind and changes
My thoughts about home
They get buried and replaced
Oh consulting dirty water
Pumps the sunshine through my veins
When anxiousness is dead
Overestimation becomes alive
As long as there's dirty water
I'll be streetwalking at night
And though it feels already like the end
I'll stick to you my liquid friend
I spend every hour and my last cents
Just to stay close to you
I'm feeling like a man
And without you I'm a child
When my hands and legs are shaking (mama)
A full glass might do me right
Cause a full glass of that dirty water
Might treat every disease
If there'd be fountains pouring dirty water
I'd finally find some peace
I'm finally ready for the end
I'd rather be elsewhere than to be stuck with you again
Oh lonesome lover won't you give me the last dance
Before I kiss goodbye to you
