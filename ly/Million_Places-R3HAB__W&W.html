		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You lie to my heart when I feel low
I see your face in a million places
Give me your hand and there we go
Where you will take us, a million places

When everything is said and done
All that matters is that we got each other
Forever we'll be on the run
To a million places, a million places

(I see your face in a million places)
To a million places, a million places

You lie to my heart when I feel low
I see your face in a million places
Give me your hand and there we go
Where you will take us, a million places
(A million places)

(You lie to my heart when I feel low)
(I see your face in a million places)
(Give me your hand and there we go)
(Where you will take us, a million places)

You lie to my heart when I feel low
I see your face in a million places
Give me your hand and there we go
Where you will take us, a million places

When everything is said and done
All that matters is that we got each other
Forever we'll be on the run
To a million places, a million places

You lie to my heart when I feel low
I see your face in a million places
Give me your hand and there we go
Where you will take us, a million places

When everything is said and done
All that matters is that we got each other
Forever we'll be on the run
To a million places, a million places
