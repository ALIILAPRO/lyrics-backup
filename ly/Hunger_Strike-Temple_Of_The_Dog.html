		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't mind stealin' bread from the mouths of decadents
But I can't feed on the powerless when my cup's already overfilled, yeah
But it's on the table, the fire's cookin'
And they're farmin' babies, while slaves are workin'
The blood is on the table and the mouths are chokin'
But I'm goin' hungry, yeah

I don't mind stealin' bread from the mouths of decadents
But I can't feed on the powerless when my cup's already overfilled, uh huh
But it's on the table, the fire's cookin'
And they're farmin' babies, while the slaves are all workin'
And it's on the table, their mouths are chokin'
But I'm goin' hungry (goin' hungry)

I'm goin' hungry (goin' hungry)
I'm goin' hungry (goin' hungry)
I'm goin' hungry (goin' hungry)

I'm goin' hungry (goin' hungry)
I'm goin' hungry (goin' hungry)

(Yeah, I don't mind stealin' bread) uh, I don't mind
(No, I don't mind stealin' bread)
I'm goin' hungry (goin' hungry)
I'm goin' hungry (goin' hungry)
