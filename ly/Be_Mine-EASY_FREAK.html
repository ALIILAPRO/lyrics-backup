		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you don't know me well
But I've got a feeling, so girl
I wanna know

(Till the end of time)
(Won't you be mine)
You could follow me down
I could show you to the blue

You could share your dreams
I could be the one to make them true
Other lovers you don't need now
Imma be the one for you

Imma take away your worries
We gonna step on all the rules

To hold ya
To love ya
To need ya
Oh, how I want to

To hold ya
To love ya
To need ya
Oh, how I want to

What can I do
To take care of you
'Cause everyday
I make you feel safe

I won't get tired
With you by my side
Till the end of time
Won't you be mine

What can I do
To take care of you
'Cause everyday
I make you feel safe

I won't get tired
With you by my side
Till the end of time
Won't you be mine

Feel like I be falling
Got me falling for you
I promise that I'm all in
There's nothing I wouldn't do, so

Girl, I must be honest
With you up in my head
I won't give up on ya
Be with you till the very end

To hold ya
To love ya
To need ya
Oh, how I want to

To hold ya
To love ya
To need ya
Oh, how I want to

What can I do
To take care of you
'Cause everyday
I make you feel safe

I won't get tired
With you by my side
Till the end of time
Won't you be mine
Won't you be mine

What can I do
To take care of you
'Cause everyday
I make you feel safe

I won't get tired
With you by my side
Till the end of time
Won't you be mine

What can I do (What can I do)
To take care of you (To take care of you)
'Cause everyday ('Cause everyday)
I make you feel safe (I make you feel safe)

I won't get tired (I won't get tired)
With you by my side (With you by my side)
Till the end of time (Till the end of time)
Won't you be mine (Won't you be mine)

What can I do
To take care of you
'Cause everyday
I make you feel safe

I won't get tired
With you by my side
Till the end of time
Won't you be mine
