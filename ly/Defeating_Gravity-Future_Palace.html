		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I fooled myself, acted like a tool
I saw no end of what I could do
I didn't know I could break like this
Held myself up through way too much

I fought gravity for as long as I can think
Denied the fragility of fully broken wings

Always moved along, now I need to be held
My legs shake, they're screaming for help
My resilience is fading away
Why did I have so much to pay?

I fought gravity for as long as I can think
Denied the fragility of fully broken wings
It's time to finally be honest with myself
Let's make sure we all follow the next lines
You're strong, keep holding on to this

Is there nothing to hold on anymore?
I say, get a grip on yourself but it's too hard

I fought gravity for as long as I can think
Denied the fragility of fully broken wings
It's time to finally be honest with myself
Let's make sure we all follow the next lines
You're strong, keep holding on to this
Keep holding on to this
