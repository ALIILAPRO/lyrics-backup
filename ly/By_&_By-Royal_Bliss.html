		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  By and by and by, I share the meaning
I will never be that cold again
I will never tell you to get sober
I will always be your true friend

If you want to fly then I'll meet you there
If you're doing fine why're you so scared?

By and by and by, I've been the victim
All the days go by I share the name
I will never tell you that's an order
I will always remain the same

If you want to fly then I'll meet you there
If you are doing fine
Then why're you scared?

If it's black or white withouht a sound
Then I don't want to know

By and by and by, I share the feeling
I will never be so bold again
I will never tell you to get sober
I will always be your true friend, yeah

If you want to fly then I'll meet you there
If you're doing fine
Then why're you so scared?

If it's black or white or withouht a sound
If it's black or white or withouht a sound
Then I don't want to know

By and by and by I share the meaning
I will never be that cold again
I will never tell you to get sober
I will always be your true friend
