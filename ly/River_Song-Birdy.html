		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I give you all I have, will you share your song?
Do you ever feel sad on the long ride home?
Do you feel at times that you don't belong?

Time
Another season turns the page
Living in a kind of dark age
Could you light the way?
Life
Does the feeling ever die?
Can you understand how strange it is
To be alive?

Seen centuries come and go
Is the future like the past?
Do we shine a temporary glow?
Or are we built to last?
Do you ever feel at times like it's all too fast?

Time
Another season turns the page
Living in a kind of dark age
Could you light the way?
Life
Does the feeling ever die?
Can you understand how strange it is
To be alive?

To be alive

If I give you all I have
Will you share your song?
