		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a mighty, mighty man, I'm young and I'm in my prime
I'm a mighty, mighty man, I'm young and I'm in my prime
I don't pick my jobs, I'm ready for any ol' kind

Yes, I'm a real young man, a brand new twenty-five
Yes, I'm a real young man, a brand new twenty-five
Well, I'm willing, I'm able, I'm practically much alive

Well, I'm six feet tall, I ain't no hand me down
Yes, I'm six feet tall and I ain't no hand me down
Well, I got a gal in town who calls me Good Rockin' Brown

Oh, I'm a single man, I really don't need a wife
(Pick up, you gals)
Yes, I'm a single man and I really don't need a wife
Yes, I'm gonna stay this way 'cause oh, what a wonderful life

Well, I'm a mighty man, I'm young and I'm in my prime
Yes, a mighty, mighty man, I'm young and I'm in my prime
Well, when you want me, holler and I'll be there on time

Well, when there's work to do, send for the mighty one
Yes, when there's work to do you better send for the mighty one
Yes, he'll stay on the job until the job is done
