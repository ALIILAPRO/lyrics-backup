		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He's the king of reason 
The leader of none
The lord of question
The ever trusted son
Though his body rests eternal one
He'll be known forever 
As the center of the sun

He's the great contender
The eye of the tri
A mystery in a mystery 
Yes a man who'll never die
Though his body rests, 
The ever bright one
He'll be known forever 
As the center of the sun

I say hey what's his name
What's his name
What's his name
What's his name
What's his name
What's his name

Born seventh from the seventh the lucky child
A seal in the doorway 
He'll never be denied
Though his body rests 
It will never die
Born seventh from the seventh 
A very lucky child
Center of the sun what's his name

I say hey what's his name
What's his name
What's his name
What's his name
What's his name
What's his name
