		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?

Luda!
She could go lower than I ever really thought she could,
Face down, ass up!
The top of your booty jiggling out your jeans,
Baby pull your pants up,
I like it when I see you do it,
Better then I ever seen it done before,
A lot of women drop it to the ground,
But how low can you go?
Lower then your mama's ever seen it in her life time,
Never would've imagined did not even in her right mind,
Practice in front of that mirror,
Now you doing it on the dance floor,
Mad cause I can't get wit chick ya just show me how to dance (Oh!)
I may not wanna get low so I post it up kinda like a playa do,
But if you come to the crib,
Then I might show you girls a thang or two,
Yea I think you a superstar wit' a ass like that you gotta blow,
Before you make it big,
There's just one thing that I gotta know

How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?

I could go low (go low) lower than you know,
I could go low,(go low) lower than you know,
Go low (go low) lower than you know,
Go low (go low) lower than you know,

I be like nick-nac-paddy-wack,
Oh where my kitty cat give a dog a bone,
How many licks does it takes
Till I get to the center and let a realer nigga take you home,
I could make me show stop,
Soon as you hear this flow pop,
From A-T-L-A-N-T-A and all the way down to your block,
Put the needle on a record and I make her get lower than a Lamborghini,
And if she really gettin' low then I'm a shoot a video and put it all on T-V,
Cause I like that French vanilla and the caramel,
But when it comes to chocolate,
I know that very well,
Asian persuasion,
No discrimination,
I love how they seem to please us,
I wanna taste them butterican pican peanut buttercups like Reese's Pieces,
Cause I think you a superstar,
With a ass like that you gotta blow,
Before you make it big,
Well there just one thing I gotta know

How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?

I could go low, (go low) lower than you know,
I could go low (go low) lower than you know,
I could go low (go low) lower than you know,
Go low (go low) lower than you know,

Drop it, hit it, dump it, split it,
Don't stop, (Get it, get it)
Put it on reverse just to rack it up,
Let me put some Luda in it,
Show me what you workin' wit',
I'll show you some of this bank roll,
Yea you a superstar but there's one thing I gotta know so

How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?

I could go low, (go low) lower than you know,
I could go low (go low) lower than you know,
I could go low (go low) lower than you know,
Go low (go low) lower than you know,
