		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Holdin' me down
I can't believe I am drownin' somehow
Fall to my knees
I need peace from the sound
Sounds of deceivin'
My love of your pain

Look to the crowd
Searching for something to turn us around
Love never hides when it wants to be found
All we can know is this has to be now

Say, you've never seen something so beautiful 
I am your dream
Tell me I'm everything you'll ever need
I am for you

Time is the key
Give me your heart
And you'll see what I see
Turning in circles to find what you seek
This is the feeling I want to release

Take all my pain
I'm just a soul to be lost in your hands
Take me wherever your spirit will fade
I'll be with you till the end of our days

Holdin' me down
I can't believe I am drownin' somehow
Fall to my knees
I need peace from the sound
Sounds of deceivin'
My love of your pain

Look to the crowd
Searchin' for something to turn us around
Love never hides when it wants to be found
All we can know is this has to be now

Is this the time to be taking around?
Is this the line? I will cross it somehow
I'm takin' the feeling I caught from your pain
And turnin' it all into something to gain

Hurt doesn't show when it's tryin' to rain
Feelings are all that we have to be saved

Runnin', I'm runnin' the fight to get free
Takin' the only thing that's left of me
