		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo it's not a lil' laugh, to load up the Ruger
Buss out ya head side, if I know you're not too far
Yo, yo, yo
Bah, bah, murder

Gun man (.44), gun man (.45), gun man (.32) 
Gun man (.38), gun man (.9x), gun man (12 gauge)
Drag it back, lif' it up, bun man (bah)
Gun man (GP), gun man (G-Locks), gun man (SK) 
Gun man (HK), gun man (Beretta), gun man (AK)
Drag it back, lif' it up, bun man (boo-boop)

Oh shit (shit), it's six, check the news real quick
On my life,on my guys I'ma use this pick (baow, baow)
Got selection of guns, gotta pick which stick (baow, baow, baow)
Got a dots on a Glock, wit' a see-through clip
Tryna run are you dumb? Wanna see you do tricks (where you goin'? Where you goin'?)
When he trips I'ma make him drown in drip
Let me stab him up quickly my knife work's sick (yeah, yeah)
Jack The Ripper, I'll pack this nigga
Pull back the trigger, blow out his eyeball (baow, bah)
Either you're on my side or a rival (baow, baow, baow)
Shoot on arrival, hang off the 'cycle
Ever seen a Glock 9 next to a rifle? (Grrah)
Crack on the top of my knife, I'm spiteful (baow, baow, baow)
I got no chip, smoke my man ital (baow)
Grease up the blick every time that's vital (baow, baow)

Just landed in- Mexico (Arriba)
Tell me who's next to go (yeah, yeah)
Creep up and 'tek ya' soul (baow, baow)
Fish fry and festival (boom)
Cabbage that quickly and turn that vegetable, turn that vegetable (baow)
Bro, it can get technical
SK for the look, but the spinner's sensible (brrt)

Gun man (.44), gun man (.45), gun man (.32) 
Gun man (.38), gun man (.9x), gun man (12 gauge)
Drag it back, lif' it up, bun man (bah)
Gun man (GP), gun man (G-Locks), gun man (SK) 
Gun man (HK), gun man (Beretta), gun man (AK)
Drag it back, lif' it up, bun man (boo-boop)

Smoke in a spinner (bah), ash this tray (bah)
Man couldn't find him so I crashed his bae
Did it bait on the mains, put my blade in his face
Got trickles of blood on my rambo (did him quickly)
Yutes' like gettin' done in the shop
BHA let off one, but two got shot (baow)
Plus- got done in the shop
So the drop, a coma, a coma, a coma (bah)
Headshot (bah), neck shot (bah), chest shot (bah), drench top (boom)
Team tact' and ain't givin' no leg shots
When gang slide, gonna die and get sent off
It went off, so I put two in the shotgun (boo-boop)
I shot two, but I shot one (bah)
Headshot from the dots make cops come (yeah)
017 was a hot one

Just landed in- Mexico ('sup holmes)
Tell me who's next to go (yeah, yeah)
Creep up and 'tek ya' soul (baow, baow)
Fish fry and festival (boom)
Cabbage that quickly and turn that vegetable, turn that vegetable (baow)
Bro, it can get technical
SK for the look, but the spinner's sensible (brrt, wow)

Gun man (.44), gun man (.45), gun man (.32) 
Gun man (.38), gun man (.9x), gun man (12 gauge)
Drag it back, lif' it up, bun man
Gun man (GP), gun man (G-Locks), gun man (SK) 
Gun man (HK), gun man (Beretta), gun man (AK)
Drag it back, lif' it up, bun man (boo-boop)
