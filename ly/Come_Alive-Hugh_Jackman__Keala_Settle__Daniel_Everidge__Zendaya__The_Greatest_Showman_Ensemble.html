		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You stumble through your days
Got your head hung low
Your sky's a shade of grey
Like a zombie in a maze
You're asleep inside
But you can shake awake

'Cause you're just a dead man walkin'
Thinkin' that's your only option
But you can flip the switch and brighten up your darkest day
Sun is up and the color's blinding
Take the world and redefine it
Leave behind your narrow mind
You'll never be the same

Come alive, come alive
Go and light your light
Let it burn so bright
Reachin' up
To the sky
And it's open wide
You're electrified

When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
And you know you can't go back again
To the world that you were living in
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
So, come alive (whoa)

I see it in your eyes
You believe that lie
That you need to hide your face
Afraid to step outside
So you lock the door
But don't you stay that way

No more living in those shadows
You and me we know how that goes

'Cause once you see it, oh, you'll never, never be the same

We will be the light that's turning 
Bottle up but keep on shining

You can prove there's more to you

You cannot be afraid

Come alive, come alive
Go and light your light
Let it burn so bright
Reachin' up
To the sky
And it's open wide
You're electrified

When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
And we know we can't be go back again
To the world that we were living in
'Cause we're dreaming with our eyes wide open
So, come alive

Come one
Come all
Come in
Come on

To anyone who's bursting with a dream

Come one
Come all
You hear
The call

To anyone who's searching for a way to break free

Break free
Break free

When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
And we know we can't be go back again
To the world that we were living in
'Cause we're dreaming with our eyes wide open
(Hey)

When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open (the world becomes a fantasy)
(Yeah, yeah)
And we know we can't be go back again
To the world that we were living in
'Cause we're dreaming with our eyes wide open

'Cause we're dreaming with our eyes wide open

So come alive (come alive) 
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
