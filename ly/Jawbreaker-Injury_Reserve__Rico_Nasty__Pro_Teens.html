		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How come you staring like you don't know what it's for
Get your shit together, get your jaw up off the floor
How come you staring like you don't know what it's for
Get your shit together, get your jaw up off the floor (Shit!)

We got these niggas looking at me (Shit!)
Like they've never seen a nigga put a real ass fucking fit together
They're so used to looking at these new goddamn Instagra-
Y'all niggas seen these Instagram pages?
Where they literally show you the whole entire outfit 
And the price range from head to toe nigga
So today, Ian Connor doesn't happen to have anything on top of his head
But he does happen to have the Supreme Playboy collab jacket on
Then we're just gonna go ahead and skip to the bottom, 
'Cause can you guys notice that he does have the Rape 3000's on
And those are gonna cost you 'bout $450 deadstock

Yo, the new dressing off the mannequin shit
You a cool guy, no, I'm black, on some Anakin shit
I be breaking necks and I ain't even planning these fits
When I walk in, I've got everyone panicking shit, like
Like, why would you wear those to a function?
You know they 'gon get stepped on
You know you 'gon be punching niggas
But I got two pairs
Anything that can will, Murphy Lee's law, stunting

You know that you are a black girl, right?
Your hairs 'sposed to be sowed in, not spiked up
I do what I want, not whatever gets the likes up
They don't like my outfit but they like the outcome
You never seen these shoes, well, that's the reason I bought them
They copy my swag, you can see that I taught them
Fresh to death, I belong in a coffin
But I'm way too liked to die, so often express myself
Put it in a song so I don't kill myself
Listen to it back and then I heal myself
I got money and the power and I'm still myself
Momma said don't go broke tryin' to fill yourself
Momma said don't break tryin' to build yourself
And don't feel ashamed if you need some help
'Cause we all do, 'cause we all lose, I got it

'Cause we all know someone
Who blown their whole rent on some Off-White
I ain't got none but I still tripping off white
Lost my momma and I lost my mind
And I still ain't got my hair right
Yeah, out in London I was dropping pounds
While my pockets fat off sinking sounds
Had me dressed like the cover from Seeing Sounds
Got all these clones frontin' trying to be me now, I'm like

How come you staring like you don't know what it's for
Get your shit together, get your jaw up off the floor
How come you staring like you don't know what it's for
Get your shit together, get your jaw up off the floor
How come you staring like you don't know what it's for
Get your shit together, get your jaw up off the floor (How Sway?)
How come you staring like you don't know what it's for
Get your shit together, get your jaw up off the floor

Jaw up off the floor
Get your shit together, get your jaw up off the floor (Shit!)
