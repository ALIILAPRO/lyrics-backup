		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don’t mind your laundry
On my floor
I don’t mind your dishes in the sink
How you say just what you think
But never sorry
When you're wrong
Like when you're singing in the shower
Messing up my favorite song

This ain’t love I don’t know what you call it
I don’t know what it is but I want it
Got me way too involved now I’m falling
I wasn’t calling
Now I'm all in

What if this is love...
What if this is love...
What if this is love

Yeah I got some stories
From before
Bout some guys who came to play
But you're different 'cause you stay until the morning
Then some more
And I wake up to your face
Only thing I wanna say

This ain’t love I don’t know what you call it
I don’t know what it is but I want it
Got me way too involved now I’m falling
I wasn’t calling
Now I'm all in

What if this is love...
What if this is love...
What if this is love

Maybe you’re the one
Maybe you’re not
Wouldn’t be the first time I’ve been wrong
Even if it ends with my tear drops
I’ll take a shot

'Cause what if this is love...
What if this is love...
