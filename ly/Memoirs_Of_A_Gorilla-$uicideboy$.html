		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Serpents of Death crawling under your skin
If I take a bet you can guess who gon' win
I walk in the 'jects without no protection
I function in hoods every city I'm in
I'm that grey born gorilla out the concrete jungle
Ducking from the dope 'cause I just shot a bundle
Scarecrow make the chopper drum shots rumble
Scarecrow got the dope game from my uncle
Still prefer the drugs over bitches
Better watch your side that you picking
Snake start hissing
Heads go missing
Rest in piss to the ones I'm killing
Chief Keef drilling
Codeine spilling
Blood on my linen from the cuts never healing
Hot boys out the crypt with a mouth full of scripts
Body bags zip when the gun hammer clip

Ruby leveled up, Ruby leveled up
Ruby gon' global
Epidemic proportion
I got the torch and now I'm lightin up gas on the porch
Kick back, now I'm bored
$lick asked for the short
Flick ash for the sport
Ruby wrestles several devils in the seventhth Ward
But Ruby can't afford to move towards the hoard just yet
Seventh Ward dragon with a fiery sword through the neck
Engulfed in flames, engulfed in blood
As it rains from the red heaven that Yung Plague has escaped levitate, over Lake Pontchartrain
Set 'em straight
No we are not the same
Yeah it's hard to remain when you're self slain
Yeah it's all that remains when you're self made
Ruby 'bout to take a second breath
Embrace yourself because all that remains is the blood stains
