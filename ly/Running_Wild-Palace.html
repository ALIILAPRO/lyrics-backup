		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Down the waterfall
Found the feet to swim again
It's for you I call
To drown the past of me instead
Feel the air in me
I've lifted off the atmosphere
So steal the mask I see
I've shifted off the wheel I steer

I'm rising high and freer than
An eagles flight, it'll never end
Found my place, the evergreen
She sets me free and I've never seen
Cold, the hands she blessed me with
To hold the man she wouldn't give
A second chance to live a life
I'm moving on and living right

Count my years up
Boundless future
Sound my freedom
Now I've breathed in
Running wild, I roam
Running wild, I roam
I roam

Holding fast to anything
My grip will last now I'm colored in
The river's deep, but I'm river strong
The mountain's steep, but I'm holding on
Shade the past with memories
Shake my past of seventeen
Pave the way for anyone
They slaved away for the seventh time
Give me life to live away
A life that's mine, I could never say

Count my years up
Boundless future
Sound my freedom
Now I've breathed in
Running wild, I roam
Running wild, I roam
I roam
I roam

Running wild, I roam
Running wild, I roam
I roam
I roam
I roam
