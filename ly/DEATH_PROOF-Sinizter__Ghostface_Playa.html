		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Suicide doors on my whip, enjoy your final ride
I push my pedal to metal, swervin' side to side
Hit the nitrous, shift to 6th, and bitch I powerslide
I'm doin' donuts in the EVO, cause a homicide
Death Proof, Death Proof
Whatchu gonna do?
Death Proof, Death Proof
Whatchu gonna do?
Death Proof, Death Proof
Whatchu gonna do?
Death Proof, Death Proof
Whatchu gonna do?
Kickin' to sixth and I go nuts
EVO with all the components
Ima smoke all my opponents
Addy to maintain the focus
Burnin' that rubber to get ahead
Talkin' that shit bullet to his head
Like he a zombie, he left 4 dead
30 round mag you gon' feel the lead
What the fuck you want?
Now what the fuck you want?
Fuck this rap shit, wanna play lil bitch I'm not the one
I'm racin' everyone
I'll swing on anyone
CKY, can't kill yourself but bitch I got the gun
Know they lookin' for me
I know he lurkin' for me
You the type that talkin' tough but turn into informant
I'm shiftin' lane to lane
I stay in death's domain
Send his head right through window, he don't feel no pain
Suicide doors on my whip, enjoy your final ride
I push my pedal to metal, swervin' side to side
Hit the nitrous, shift to 6th, and bitch I powerslide
I'm doin' donuts in the EVO, cause a homicide
Death Proof, Death Proof
Whatchu gonna do?
Death Proof, Death Proof
Whatchu gonna do?
Death Proof, Death Proof
Whatchu gonna do?
Death Proof, Death Proof
Whatchu gonna do?
