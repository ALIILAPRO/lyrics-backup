		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Raindrops falling down they keep me wide awake at night
I can't help myself I'm thinking about the devil in the sky
What if I just cut you loose could it saving me some tears
Oh why oh why don't I just do something about

Ease me till I feel Ok
No one can guide me the way
Don't think I need to explain 
One more time

Ease me till I feel Ok
No one can guide me the way
Don't think I need to explain 

I'm better on my own
I'm Better on my own
I feel it in my body and I've known it for too long
Don't miss me when I'm gone 
Don't miss me when I'm gone 
You've been suffocating me I'm better on my own 
I'm better on my own

Raindrops falling down they keep me wide awake at night
I can't help myself I'm thinking about the devil in the sky
What if I just cut you loose could it saving me some tears
Oh why oh why don't I just do something about

Ease me till I feel Ok
No one can guide me the way
Don't think I need to explain 
One more time

Ease me till I feel Ok
No one can guide me the way
Don't think I need to explain 

I'm better on my own
I'm Better on my own
I feel it in my body and I've known it for too long
Don't miss me when I'm gone 
Don't miss me when I'm gone 
You've been suffocating me I'm better on my own 
I'm better on my own
