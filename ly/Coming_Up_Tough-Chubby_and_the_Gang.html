		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You was a kid, what did you know?
Mum threw you out to the rain and the snow
You came up tough, it weren't enough to stop you going down

Against you the cards were stacked
Anything you said was a fucking fact

You did some crime, you weren't that wrong
They sent you down for fucking long
The world moves past your jail cell
This place is worse than hell
And on the outside they say it's fine 
None of them have ever done no time

You never thought your life would be gone in a blink
Went and lost your head, now have time to think
Never thought your life would be gone in a blink
Went and lost your head, now have time to think

How can you prove 'em wrong 
If no one even gave you a chance?

Between the cats and the gangs 
Ain't no place for you to hang
You spend your days in your bed
Running phone calls through your head
They made examples out of you
What did examples ever prove?

You never thought your life would be gone in a blink
Went and lost your head, now have time to think
Never thought your life would be gone in a blink
Went and lost your head, now have time to think
Never thought your life would be gone in a blink
Went and lost your head, now have time to think
Never thought your life would be gone in a blink
Went and lost your head, now have time to think

How can you prove 'em wrong 
If no one even gave you a chance?

You never thought your life would be gone in a blink
You went and lost your head, now have time to think
Never thought your life would be gone in a blink
Went and lost your head, now have time to think
Never thought your life would be gone in a blink
You went and lost your head, now have time to think
Never thought your life would be gone in a blink
You went and lost your head, now have time to think

How can you prove 'em wrong 
If no one even gave you a chance?
