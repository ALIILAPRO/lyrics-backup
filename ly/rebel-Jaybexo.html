		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah
Yeah, go
Yeah
Go, go
Keep a stick to protect myself
W-walk with a G19 like a rebel
Fuck the fame, nigger I want this bread 
Just poured a deuce of that lean, I cant think
Told my nigger jay, we finna make it
Its bout that time, yeah we finna go crazy
Wanna ride in that big body Tonka
W-walk up in Saks and they know who we are
H-hop in that coupe and we off for the stars
We in that SRT, Im off the za baby cant you tell?
Walk with a six on my hip, like Im Satan 
I need that green shit, like some spinach 
Point out my fingers, my finna attack 
I-I keep a stick, how can I ever lack
Im getting cheese nigger like Im Micky
We going up, man I feel like a prodigy
Walking in the building Im smelling like gas
Feel like im Kobe, I just took a perk
You not my gang nigger, not my brother
Im counting money, nigger you got nada 
We spin your block, nigger like a wheel
Say you got hoes, nigger where your money at
Say you got hoes, nigger where your money at
