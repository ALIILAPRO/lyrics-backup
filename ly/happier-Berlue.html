		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Want to be alone
In my old bedroom
But the house is gone
So there is nothing I can do

Got to leave my old life
Got to leave my bed
But I get so obsessed and distracted
And I can't get out of it

Do I really need to know what I want
To be happier
Do I really need to know what I want

Wish that I was certain
Of who I want to be
But every time I try to
I just start spiraling

Does any of this matter
Am I just wasting time
I get so obsessed and distracted
And I can't escape my mind

Do I really need to know what I want
To be happier
Do I really need to know what I want
To be happier
Is there something that I'm missing
Is there somewhere I should
What do I really need to know

Am I happier
Am I happier
Am I happier
Am I happier
