		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The neon lights are shining on me again
I walk the lonely streets in search of a friend
I need a lady to help me to get through the night, through the night
If I could find her, then everything would feel alright

The sleepy city is dreaming the nighttime away
Out on the streets, I watch tomorrow becoming today
I see a man, he's got take away women for sale, yes, for sale
Guess that's the answer, 'cause take away women don't fail

Oh, dirty women, they don't mess around
Oh, dirty women, they don't mess around
You've got me coming, you've got me going around
Oh, dirty women, they don't mess around

(Let's go)

Walking the streets, I wonder, will it ever happen? (Dirty women)
Gotta be good 'cause everything will be okay (dirty women)
If I could score tonight then I will end up happy (dirty women)
A woman for sale is gonna help me save my day (dirty women)

Dirty women, dirty women
Dirty women, dirty women
Dirty women, dirty women
Dirty women, dirty women
Dirty women, dirty women
Dirty women, dirty women
Dirty women, dirty women
Dirty women, dirty women
Dirty women, dirty women
Dirty women, dirty women
Dirty women, dirty women
