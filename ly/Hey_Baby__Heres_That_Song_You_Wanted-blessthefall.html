		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I watched the sun again
It's leaving now
I've spent all night long trying to figure out
What I've lost and what I've found
When my feet won't hit the ground
Trying to make it, starting over
And will we ever love again?

Hey baby, are you alone tonight?
How can we make it?
Hey baby, looks like you were wrong
It's never too late, too late

So here we are again, to make some sense of it all
All these sudden changes
Maybe things are not so different
Rearrange the pieces, like it's all we know
It's all we know, let it go

Hey baby, are you alone tonight?
How can we make it?
Hey baby, looks like you were wrong
It's never too late, too late

I can't put it together, what we've lost
But pieces keep falling one by one
'Cause this life has us holding on
For tomorrow then it's gone
For tomorrow then it's gone

Hey baby, it looks like you were wrong (you were wrong)
How can we make it?

Hey baby, are you alone tonight?
How can we make it?
Hey baby, looks like you were wrong
It's never too late, too late

We'll take it all (hey, baby)
Leave the place behind
There's no one else tonight, tonight
We'll take it all (hey, baby)
Leave the place behind
There's no one else tonight, tonight
