		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been waiting for so long
But you know I got my issues
But please don't blame me they're just issues
(Issues)

I'll hit you up on a better day
I'll call you when it's cold and I wanna play
But please don't ask me what it is that I wanna say
It's not anything
That you could obtain
'Cuz I'm a pussy ass bitch on a good day
Don't fuck up my vibes on a Monday
Got too many things that I could say
Can't mess it up
I don't wanna love
Just wanna touch
Am I too much for you?

I've been waiting for so long
But you know I got my issues
But please don't blame me they're just issues

There's nothing wrong about my pride
It's protected me from your lies
'Cuz I won't buy it
I won't

I've been waiting for so long (I've been waiting for you)
But you know I got my issues (I know you got your issues)
But please don't blame me they're just issues
(Issues)
(Issues)
(Issues)
(Issues)

It's late in the night
What do you want, baby?
I'm losing sleep
Thinking of you, baby
You got me weak in the head
Don't wanna fuck if it's not anything
I don't wanna hurt you baby
We could think of something baby
But please don't wait around me
Wait around me
Wait around me boy
I don't wanna hurt you (hurt you, no)
Baby I don't know you
Maybe we could try (I try, I try)
But it's hard
And I know (I know)
We've been through the most
But baby please don't go
Don't go
Don't go like that
