		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Standing up too high
With nowhere to fall down to
Apathy around you instead of looking back
You heard it all before now
Losing what you didn't know you had
Fear it, what you want is near it
But you're really trying
To get away from it
Basic instincts overpowering
You still have this owing
When this could be good enough for us

This could be good enough for us
This could be good enough for us
This could be good enough for us
This could be good enough for us

This could be good enough for us
Fear it, what you want is near it
But you're really trying
To get away from it
Basic instincts overpowering
You still have this owing
When this could be good enough for us
And I don't have a chance now
This could be good enough for us

Standing up too high
With nowhere to fall down to
Apathy around you instead of looking back
You heard it all before now
Losing what you didn't know you had
Fear it, what you want is near it
But you're really trying
To get away from it
Basic instincts overpowering
You still have this owing
This could be good enough for us

This could be good enough for us
When this could be good enough for us
And I don't have a chance now
This could be good enough for us
