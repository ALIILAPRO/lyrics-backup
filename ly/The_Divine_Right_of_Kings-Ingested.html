		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ""Reformation a new disguise To rule my congregation Devastation I am despised By fickle populations  Impose my will upon the meek Their desperation makes them weak I'll hang their corpses with no mourning Rot forever as a warning  All who would dare enter here I stand as a monument  Humanity's savagery  I am the destroyer Borne from arrogance And pride of man This sentence is a debt repaid Your wasted earth I have enslaved  I am the creator Forging new landscapes of withered flesh This sentence is a debt repaid Your wasted earth I have enslaved  Become the idol to your rival Every breath that you take vital Find their weakness and exploit it Fear your strength they'll kneel before it  To be king for a day There'd be no room in the mortuaries Millions would die where they lay All cower in fear  Their desperation makes them weak I'll hang their corpses with no mourning Rot forever as a warning  All who would dare enter here I stand as a monument  Humanity's savagery  Humanity's savagery - founded on apathy Boundless brutality - endless ferocity Godlike anomaly - free from all empathy Vision with clarity - bathed in barbarity  Freedom a concept that is absent through my legion May a brother smite another For to disagree is treason I found my power through neglect Five headed narcissistic serpent Here I stand with no regrets And realise my purpose  This is my trinity  Crush Kill Execution My right my divinity Untold retribution  Maim and slaughter Every single fucking waste of life And by this judgement I'll destroy Everyone in my sight""
