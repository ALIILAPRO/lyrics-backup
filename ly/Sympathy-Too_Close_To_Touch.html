		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take a step inside my mind
As my eyes are open wide
In my sleep I turn and toss
To rebuild the heart I lost

You can tell me what you want
Forming once and lovers lost
Paper thin your words they haunt my dreams
The seams have come undone
Don't you dare say I'm gonna make it
'Cause I don't believe a word you say

Don't you dare say I'm gonna make it
'Cause I don't believe a word you say
There's a sickness living inside me
You can spare me all your sympathy

Take a second of your time
Realize you're wasting mine
In the night I lie awake
Why rebuild a heart that breaks

You can tell me what you want
Forming once and lovers lost
Paper thin your words they haunt my dreams
The seams have come undone

Don't you dare say I'm gonna make it
'Cause I don't believe a word you say
There's a sickness living inside me
You can spare me all your sympathy
Just spare me all your sympathy

I'm sitting waiting on the sun to rise
I know it never will
It comes as no surprise
So won't you stare into my heart of lies
It looks so hungry now
It comes as no surprise

Don't you dare say I'm gonna make it
'Cause I don't believe a word you say
There's a sickness living inside me
You can spare me all your sympathy
You can spare me all your sympathy
