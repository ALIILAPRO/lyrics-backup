		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Looking at the ceiling 
Starring at the wall
Looking in the mirror
Trying not to fall
Trying to be careful
Trying to be pure
I wanna be honest
I wanna be sure

But all I can see is a
Big black dark
I'm trying to count through the
Tangled thoughts
I don't wanna stay here
And I don't wanna go
I don't see it coming
I don't want it all

Take another story
Take another frame
Take another figure
Take another name
Take another person
Take another life
Take another problem
Take another strife
Take another demon
Take another space
Take another dream and
Take another faith
Take another rise and
Take another fall
I don't see it coming
I don't want it all

I don't wanna be there
I don't wanna lie
I don't wanna hurt you but
I don't wanna cry oh
Take another story
Take another frame
Take another figure
Take another name name

Then dreams are
The same
Then dreams are
The same
Then dreams are
The same
Then dreams are
The same
Oh then dreams are

I don't wanna be there
I don't wanna lie
I don't wanna hurt you but
I don't wanna cry oh
Take another story
Take another frame
Take another figure
Take another name name
