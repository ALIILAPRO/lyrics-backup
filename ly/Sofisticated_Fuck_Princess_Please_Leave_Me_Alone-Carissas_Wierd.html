		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Still recall
What made me like you
Oh yes
They have
Said things about you
And yes
See
Where it's true?

Thought you could get all you wanted
By just thinking of yourself
It's not your pretty face that matters
And I think you need some help

So please
Just leave
Me the hell alone
'Cause now
I know
This isn't it all right
How much
More times
Will I have to tell you?
You try
To cry
But it's just for show
You know I know you know

Thinks that things that don't make sense
Could make you look like a liar
Don't convince me that you're right
About some fear I had of heartache
So I'll make you just one promise:
That I'll never regret this

Take a long look inside
'Cause right now I'm leaving you
Take a long look inside
'Cause right now I'm leaving
Take a long look inside
'Cause right now I'm leaving you
