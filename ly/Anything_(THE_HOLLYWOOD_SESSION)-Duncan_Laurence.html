		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I had a vision of you
Dancing too close to the cliff's edge
So I build a wall around you
To keep you safe from a misstep

I had a dream about you
Burning your hand on a stovetop
And I woke up worried for you
And took every knob on that stove off

Ooh, I'd do anything for you
Ooh, I'd do anything for love
Nothing could ever be too much
I'd do anything for us

I had a vision of you
Leaving me for someone prettier
So I found the fountain of youth
To make sure that I'll never wither

I had a dream about you
Burning in hell when you leave us
I talked to the big man for you
My first conversation with Jesus

Ooh, I'd do anything for you
Oh, I'd do anything for love
Nothing could ever be too much
I'd do anything for us

Oh, I'd do anything for you (
Oh, I'd give anything for love (
Nothing could ever be too much
I'd do anything for us
For us
Ooh, us
