		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The first time that he saw her 
He knew everything had changed 
Overnight love started blooming 
Like the first rose of spring 
 
Auburn hair like a sunrise 
Sweetest smile he'd ever seen 
Butterflies, they danced around her 
Like the first rose of spring 
 
Summertime would've never started 
And wintertime would never end 
She colored his life, opened his eyes 
To things he'd never dream 
Without the first rose of spring 
 
Gave him children like a garden 
They gave 'em all the love they'd need 
To grow up strong, she made a home 
And every year he'd bring
Her the first rose of spring 
 
The last time he saw her 
He knew everything had changed 
He said goodbye and let the tears fall like rain 
On the first rose of spring
