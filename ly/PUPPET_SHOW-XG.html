		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's time I get what I deserve
Act like he don't know what I'm worth
We spend a lot of time talkin'
But it feels like I'm never heard

Listen to what comes out my mouth
Before you try to take me out
You oughta know what I'm about
Treat me like a lady this ain't up for debating
Boy stop playin' 'fore it goes a different a route

Imagine a world
Where we could play different roles
Where girls be takin' control, oh, oh
Wrapped round our fingers
They couldn't tell us, no, no, no

Welcome to the puppet show
Where we play 'em like their plastic dolls
They'll do anything, anything, anything
When you got 'em hanging by a string, by a string

Gonna play 'em like their toys
We'll make 'em do what we enjoy
They'll do anything
When you got 'em by a string

Puppet, pe, puppet, puppet

Don't like the look of this picture
Boy you think that I'm in love witcha?
Haha, cry me a river
Thought you were slick to lead
But you're an extra
I'ma do it my way
Ain't apologetic
I might cut you off like
'bye felicia' with it
I'm the controller play 'em like atari
It ain't game over till I say so, got it?

Automatic when I want for it to please me
Might just make you do the things I want you to
Playing puppet master everything's so easy
I'll make all of my own dreams come true

Imagine a world
Where we could play different roles
Where we be takin' control, oh, oh
Wrapped round our fingers
They couldn't tell us, no, no, no

Welcome to the puppet show (to the puppet show)
Where we play 'em like their plastic dolls (like their plastic dolls)
They'll do anything, anything, anything
When you got 'em hanging by a string, by a string

Gonna play 'em like their toys (like their toys)
We'll make 'em do what we enjoy
They'll do anything (anything)
When you got 'em by a string (by a string, yeah)

Follow my lead
Just leave the whole thing up to me
My expertise
Yeah yeah

Welcome to the puppet show
Where we play 'em like their plastic dolls
They'll do anything, anything
When you got 'em hanging by a string, by a string, yeah

Welcome to the puppet show (welcome to the show)

Where we play 'em like their plastic dolls (like their plastic dolls)
They'll do anything, anything, anything (they'll do anything)
When you got 'em hanging by a string, by a string

Gonna play 'em like their toys (play 'em like their toys)
We'll make 'em do what we enjoy (make 'em do what we enjoy)
They'll do anything (anything)
When you got 'em by a string
