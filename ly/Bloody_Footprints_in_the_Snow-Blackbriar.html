		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bloody footprints in the snow
Left behind a few moments ago
By a creature with a heart of ice
No bite will ever suffice

A hunger that will never be sated
Once human, now alienated
A spirit of lonely places
The Wendigo is how we named it

Can you hear its stomach grumble, voraciously?
Can you hear its howl, so painfully?

Bloody footprints in the snow
Left behind by the spirit of a Wendigo
A creature with a heart of ice
And a gluttonous appetite

Can you hear its stomach grumble?
Can you hear its howl?
A giant, tall as a tree
Doomed to wander alone and hungry

Can you hear its stomach grumble, voraciously?
Can you hear its howl, so painfully?
It wants to devour you with greed
But the more it eats the more it needs

Bloody footprints in the snow
Bloody footprints in the snow

You'll never be enough, no one ever will
It will consume you entirely only to proceed with its search
To fulfill its everlasting voracity and urge

Can you hear its stomach grumble, voraciously?
Can you hear its howl, so painfully?
It wants to devour you with greed
But the more it eats the more it needs
