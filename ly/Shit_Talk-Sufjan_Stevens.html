		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No more fighting, no more talking shit
Do as I say, not as I give up
Not as I've failed to live
In the future, there will be a terrible cost
For all that we have left undone
Deliver me from everything I've put off
And all that we've lost
I will always love you
But I cannot live with you
I will always love you

No more fighting, I've nothing left to give
I've nothing but atrophy
Did I cross you? Did I fail to believe in positive thoughts?
Our romantic second chance is dead
I buried it with the hatchet
Quit your antics, put them at the foot of the bed
And set it on fire
I will always love you
But I cannot watch you

I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you

Hold me closely
Hold me tightly, lest I fall
Hold me closely
Hold me tightly, lest I fall
Hold me closely
Hold me tightly, lest I fall
Hold me closely
Hold me tightly, lest I fall, la la lala

Hold me closely
Hold me tightly, lest I fall
Hold me closely
Hold me tightly, lest I fall
Hold me closely (I will always love you)
Hold me tightly, lest I fall
Hold me closely (I will always love you)
Hold me tightly, lest I fall

No, I don't wanna fight at all
No, I don't wanna fight at all
No, I don't wanna fight at all
No, I don't wanna fight at all

No, I don't wanna fight at all
I don't wanna fight at all
No, I don't wanna fight at all
I don't wanna fight at all
No, I don't wanna fight at all (I don't wanna fight at all)
I don't wanna fight at all

No, I don't wanna fight at all (no, I don't wanna fight at all)
No, I don't wanna fight at all
No, I don't wanna fight at all (no, I don't wanna fight at all)
I don't wanna fight at all
No, I don't wanna fight at all
I don't wanna fight at all (I don't wanna fight at all)

I don't wanna fight at all (I will always love you)
I don't wanna fight at all
I will always love you
No, I don't wanna fight at all (I don't wanna fight at all)
I will always love you
No, I don't wanna fight at all (I don't wanna fight at all)
I will always love you
No, I don't wanna fight at all (I don't wanna fight at all)
I will always love you
