		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  La, la, la, la
La-la-la, la, la, la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la, la, la
La-la-la, la, la, la-la, la-la
La-la-la

Where the fuck am I?
Tell me, did I just die?
'Cause I don't understand why
I'm in a room I don't recognize
I died at 5:45
Yeah, it says so on a sign
And my mother's crying out her eyes
Or is the radio telling lies?

Juvenile sinner, car crash winner
Don't let the devil take you out for dinner
Juvenile sinner, car crash winner
Don't let the devil take you out for dinner

I just wanna die for the hype, for the hype
Crucified like Jesus Christ
I just wanna die for the hype, for the hype
Crucified like Jesus Christ

La, la, la, la
La-la-la, la, la, la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la, la, la
La-la-la, la, la, la-la, la-la
La-la-la

I'm digging my own grave for the day
I decorate with pink socks and gold chains (woo)
Two fat stacks on my eyes (eye, eye, eye)
I'm in a box I don't recognize
Believe what they say (say, say)
And you'll be flyin' away (way, way)
On a coke-covered D-day (day, day)
While they're chucking sukki on your face (wah)

Juvenile sinner, car crash winner
Don't let the devil take you out for dinner
Juvenile sinner, car crash winner
Don't let the devil take you out for dinner

I just wanna die for the hype, for the hype
Crucified like Jesus Christ
I just wanna die for the hype, for the hype
Crucified like Jesus Christ

Yeah, Polly
I just wanna suck on your lolly
I just wanna suck on your lolly
I just wanna suck on your lolly, Polly
Yeah, Polly (Polly)
I just wanna suck on your lolly
I just wanna suck on your lolly
I just wanna suck on your lolly, Polly (yeah)

I just wanna die for the hype, for the hype
Crucified like Jesus Christ (like Jesus Christ)
I just wanna die for the hype, for the hype
Crucified like Jesus Christ (like Jesus Christ)
I just wanna die for the hype, for the hype
Crucified like Jesus Christ
I just wanna die for the hype, for the hype
Crucified like Jesus Christ

La, la, la, la
La-la-la, la, la, la-la, la-la
(That one, that one was so sick)
(Just fucking mad)
