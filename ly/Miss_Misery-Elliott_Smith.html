		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll fake it through the day
With some help from Johnny Walker Red
And the cold pain behind my eyes
It shoots back through my head
With two tickets torn in half
And a lot of nothing to do
But it's alright
'Cause some enchanted night I'll be with you

The tarot cards
And the lines in my hand
Tell me I'm wrong
But they're untrue

I got plans for both of us
That involve a trip out of town
To a place I've seen in a magazine
That you left lying around
I can't hold my liquor but
I keep a good attitude
'Cause it's alright
Some enchanted night I'll be with you

And though you'd rather see me gone
Than to see there come the day
I'll be waiting for you anyway

Next door the TV's flashing
Blue frames on the wall
It's a comedy from the 70s
With a lead no one recalls
He vanished into oblivion
It's easy to do
And I cry to see when you talked to me
The day you said we were through
But it's alright
Some enchanted night I'll be with you
