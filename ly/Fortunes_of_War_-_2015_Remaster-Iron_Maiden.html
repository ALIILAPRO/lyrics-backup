		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  After the war 
And now that they've sent us homeward 
I can't help but feel that I'm on my own 
No one can see just what this conflict has done to 
The minds of the men who are on their way home 

I'm scarred for life 
But it's not my flesh that's wounded 
So how can I face the torment alone 
The vivid scenes and all the recurring nightmares 
I lay there and sweat until it gets light 

People say "Don't worry" 
Say that time's a perfect healer 
That the nightmares they will come to pass 
Can't hear what they're saying 
I am living in my own world 
And I'm feeling trance-like all the time 

I hear voices in my head 
Could I really be going crazy 
In the night the visions seem so real 
Do you care if you live or die 
When you laugh are you really crying 
You're not sure what's real anymore 

Fortunes of war 
Fortunes of war 
Fortunes of war 
No pain anymore 

Fortunes of war 
Fortunes of war 
Fortunes of war 
No pain anymore 

Fortunes of war 

Fortunes of war 
Fortunes of war 
Fortunes of war 
No pain anymore

Fortunes of war 
Whoa oh-oh, oh oh-oh, oh oh-oh
Whoa oh-oh, oh oh-oh, oh oh
Whoa oh-oh, oh oh-oh, oh oh
Oh oh-oh, oh oh-oh, oh oh

Fortunes of war 
Fortunes of war 
Fortunes of war 
No pain anymore

Fortunes of war 
Fortunes of war 
Fortunes of war 
No pain anymore

Fortunes of war 

Sometimes I wake 
I feel that my spirit's broken 
I wonder if I've the strength
Carry on

Carry on
