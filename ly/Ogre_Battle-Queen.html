		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Fa fa fa fa fa
Fa fa fa fa faa
Now once upon a time - an old man told me a fable
When the piper is gone - and the soup is cold on your table
And if the black crow flies to find a new destination
That is the sign
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to the ogre-battle-fight

He gives a great big cry and he can swallow up the ocean
With a mighty tongue he catches flies - the palm of a hand incredible size
One great big eye - has a focus in your direction
Now the battle is on
Yeah yeah yeah
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to the ogre-battle-fight

Fa fa fa fa faa
Hoooa

The ogre-men are still inside
The two-way mirror mountain
You gotta keep down right out of sight
You can't see in, but they can see out
"Ooh keep a look out"
The ogre-men are coming out
From the two-way mirror mountain
They're running up behind and they're coming all about
Can't go east 'cause you gotta go south

Aaargh
Aaaaaaaarghh
Ogre-men are going home
The great big fight is over
Bugle blow, let trumpet cry
Ogre battle lives for ever more - oh oh oh
You can come along
You can come along
Come to ogre battle
Fa fa fa fa faa
