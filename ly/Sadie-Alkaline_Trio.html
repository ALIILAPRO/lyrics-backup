		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're on your own my little nightmare, you cannot stay here
It's far too bright for you
If they attack you, just lay there
Play dead dear, it's your only hope of pulling through
And seconds, they seem like a lifetime
A dream, recurring, a dream that can't come true
And they'll pin it all on you 
After all you've been put through

"Sadie G, she's crazy, see?"
That's what the white coats say
Now, Ms. Susan A, you're losing
Every opportunity to put us all away

You run along, my little nightmare
Your job is done here
You've scared them all to death
If they revive them, just sit there
Just smile dear, make them thankful for every breath
The sentence may seem like a lifetime 
A scream, that's curdling the blood they found on you
And your knives and clothing too
Charlie's broken .22

"Sadie G, she's crazy, see?"
That's what the white coats say
Now, Ms. Susan A, you're losing
Every opportunity
Well, they found you and they shipped you up the river 
The same way that you've bound and gagged
You've shot and stabbed
You tried to set 'em free, but they've thrown away the keys

"He represented a God to me, that was so beautiful 
That I'd do anything for him
I'd do anything for God
Even murder, if I believed it was right, how could it not be right
If it was done with love?
I have no remorse for doing what was right to me, I have no guilt in me"

Whoa 
Whoa
Whoa 
Whoa
