		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't you find it strange
What you fear and what you crave
All start to feel the same
Questioning sanity
In a formless shape
I swear it knows my name
Hear footsteps through the trees
It's always following
Fractured fading light
Can I make it out alive
Don't make a sound
There's no escape from this now
This isn't natural
Interdimensional
A world upside down
Can't keep my feet on the ground
Unrecognizable
Will I ever be found
Dreaming but I'm not asleep
Not dead but I'm not breathing
It's looming over me
Feeding on agony
Fractured fading light
Can I make it out alive
Don't make a sound
There's no escape from this now
This isn't natural
Interdimensional
A world upside down
Can't keep my feet on the ground
Unrecognizable
Will I ever be found
Will I ever be found
Desolate
Is it all in my head
Devastate
It's taking over me
Don't make a sound
There's no escape from this now
This isn't natural
Interdimensional
A world upside down
Can't keep my feet on the ground
Unrecognizable
Will I ever be found
Will I ever be found
