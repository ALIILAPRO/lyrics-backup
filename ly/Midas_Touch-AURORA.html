		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can remember I was dreaming
In the moonlight gently, I was floating
I didn't know that I was sinking
In my lonely bed sheets I was dying

When you're away
I think that I'll escape
You're a king but you're a slave
This love will end today

I would watch you fall in love
But you love me like a kid
You needed someone close
And I never really did
I'd find you on your knees
And you'd beg for me to be
The woman on your throne
But I'd rather be alone

Do you remember how I loved you
You would make your lovers into sculptures
You didn't know that I was lonely
And the gift you brought me could not suit me

Midas, my dear
No wonder why you're scared
You're a king among the thieves
And your world belongs to me

I would watch you fall in love
But you love me like a kid
You needed someone close
And I never really did
I'd find you on your knees
And you'd beg for me to be
The woman on your throne
But I'd rather be alone
