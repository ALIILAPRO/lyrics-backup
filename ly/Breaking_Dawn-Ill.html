		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see it fades
our light
it's all gone

it's crawling inside
our time is leaving out

I'm alive but I'm lost in pain
and our world is in open haze

but I'll be alright
cuz you know
I'll break it all

ah
ah

maybe we all see things in life
only the ways all meant to be

maybe it's all lies
you should know
it'll be all gone

lies fill up the world
it's breaking down

the whole world in your eyes
it's breaking dawn

ah
ah

maybe we all see things in life
only the ways all meant to be

it could be all lies
you should know
I'll break it all

maybe we'll walk down on this road
and it's the way we take to be

so it'll be alright
cuz you know
it'll be all gone

I need to take you through my eyes
tell me you'll run it til it ends
maybe it's just the way it ends

I see it fades
our light
it's all gone

I see it fades
I will
be alright
