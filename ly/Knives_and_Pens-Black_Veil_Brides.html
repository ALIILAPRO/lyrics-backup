		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alone at last, we can sit and fight
And I've lost all faith in this blurring light
But stay right here we can change our plight
We're storming through this despite what's right

One final fight, for this tonight
Whoa, with knives and pens we made our plight
Lay your heart down the ends in sight
Conscience begs for you to do what's right
Everyday it's still the same dull knife
Stab it through and justify your pride

One final fight, for this tonight
Whoa, with knives and pens we made our plight
Whoa and I can't go on without your love
You lost, you never held on
We tried our best
Turn out the light
Turn out the light

One final fight, for this tonight
Whoa, with knives and pens we made our plight
Whoa and I can't go on without your love
You lost, you never held on
We tried our best
Turn out the light
Turn out the light
