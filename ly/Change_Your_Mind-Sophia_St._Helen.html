		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's the time for me to leave
You don't have the heart to
Leaving you is losing home
Who am I without you?

If you could see you in my eyes
Would you change your mind?

It's the time for me to prove 
Love without condition
Wishing all the best for you 
And the life you envision

If you could see you in my eyes
Would you change your mind? 

If you could see you in my eyes
Would you change your mind? 

Our life so intertwined
Now torn, will surely unwind
I'll set you free, I'll ease your mind
I'll set you free, I'll ease your mind
Find your peace, I'll look for mine
Find your peace, I'll look for mine
Find your peace, I'll look for mine

It's the time for me to prove 
Love without condition It's the time for me to leave
You don't have the heart to change your mind
