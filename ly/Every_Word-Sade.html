		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Love is what the word was)

I saw a picture
How could you be so careless?
How could you have done that to us?
And I write this letter
I send it all back to you
And every word you said

In there every word, oh oh oh oh
How could you have done that to us?

You treated me like a stranger
And all the time I was loving you
All your slick moves
They were once innocent moves
I wanted to look up to you
I really trusted you
And every word you said

In there every word, oh oh oh oh
How could you have done that to us? (I send it all back to you)

(Love is what the word was)

I was loving you like a child
All the time you were smiling (love is what the word was)
The same smile (love is what the word was)
I was loving you like a child
I really trusted you

Every word you said
Every word you said
(Love is what the word was)

Every word you said
Every word you said (all the time you were smiling)
(Love is what the word was)
(Love is what the word was)

Every word you said
Every word you said

I was loving you like a child, yeah
All the time you were smiling the same smile
I was loving you like a child
I really trusted you

Every word you said
Every word you said
(Love is what the word was) I send it back to you, yeah
(Love is what the word was) Oh

Every word you said
Every word you said
(Love is what the word was) I send it all back to you, yeah
(Love is what the word was)
