		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I'm missing a piece of the puzzle
I could drown when I'm just stood in a puddle
A jet black reservoir sits beneath these scars
It's all I've ever known

Please applaud it's good to know who's below me
I keep on preaching but I'm so phony holy
I've been stuck on repeat
But I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready

It feels like a glass half empty
Is more than I'll ever have
'Cause I've been fast asleep
Standing still in a stampede
I'm breaking my back
But I'm still sinking like a stone

Yeah, it's all that I've ever known
'Cause I've got nothing left
And I'm still sinking like a stone

I see the smoke but I don't move a muscle
Pretend I'm broken so you don't burst my bubble
I look up at the stars but don't see so far
It's all I've ever known

Can you spare me all of the ceremony?
Let's not pretend because I don't even know me
I've been dead on my feet
But I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready

It feels like a glass half empty
Is more than I'll ever have
'Cause I've been fast asleep
Standing still in a stampede
I'm breaking my back
But I'm still sinking like a stone

Yeah, it's all that I've ever known
'Cause I've got nothing left
And I'm still sinking like a stone

This is déjà vu
But I'm a Demi-God
I must've forgot I'm a Demi-God
I always feel so blue
But I'm a Demi-God
I must've forgot I'm a Demi God

This is déjà vu
But I'm a Demi-God
I must've forgot I'm a Demi-God
I always feel so blue
But I'm a Demi-God
I must've forgot I'm a Demi-God

Still sinking like a stone
Still sinking like a stone
Still sinking like a stone
It's all that I've ever known
Still sinking like a stone
Still sinking like a stone
'Cause I've got nothing left
And I'm still sinking like a stone

A glass half empty
Is more than I'll ever have
'Cause I've been fast asleep
Standing still in a stampede
I'm breaking my back
But I'm still sinking like a stone
