		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can't keep me down 
Imma thrive 
Watch me live 
Me o my I survived all your shit 
I won't compromise on my life for no dick 
Go and get some game 
I'm not playing with a glitch 
Fuck your daddy issues 
Trigger trauma in your brain 
Stay out of my slip stream 
We are not the same
Your old meat and I'm eating other prey
cvoiding you 
I'd rather put my pussy through the plague 

Stay away from me 
I don't want your fucking kabinosi
Fuck apologies 
I got other men performing for me
How I used to be ain't the one you see when looking at me 
Woah 

Bye bye bye bye boy
Bye bye bye bye 
Bye bye bye bye boy 
Bye bye bye bye

Its sound of a score worth settling 
Boy there's gotta a Reckoning 
Teeth filed like a beast menacing 
Take you out of body with a kiss like ketamine 

Your egos way too big for your head
I'm not tryna make amends 
We're not breaking no bread
But I'll give you some advice 
For the future ahead 
You should learn to use your tongue
Since you're average in bed
cnd I'm a prime rib specimen 
Rare beef venison 
Swinging like a spider monkey 
Junkie for adrenaline 
Like to be pleased 
cnd I like to do the pleasuring 
Take you out of body with my kiss like ketamine 

Stay away from me 
I don't want your fucking kabinosi
Fuck apologies 
I got other men performing for me
How I used to be ain't the one you see when looking at me 
Woah 

Bye bye bye bye boy
Bye bye bye bye 
Bye bye bye bye boy 
Bye bye bye bye

Its sound of a score worth settling 
Boy there's gotta a Reckoning 
Teeth filed like a beast menacing 
Take you out of body with a kiss like ketamine 

Ki ki kiss like ketamine 
K k kiss like ketamine 
Kiss like ketamine

Kiss like kiss like ketamine
