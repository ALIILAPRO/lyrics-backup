		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Yeah

Oh yes, I love her like Egyptian, want a description?
My royal highness
So many plusses when I bust that there can't be no minus
Went from yellin' crickets and crows
Bitches and hoes to queen thangs
Over the years I been up on my toes and yes I seen thangs
Like Kilroy, chill boi because them folks might think you soft
Talkin' like that, man, fuck them niggas I'm goin' off
And comin' right back like boomerangs when you throw 'em
With these old ghetto poems
Thinkin' it's better for 'em
When they can let they thumb down from hitch hikin'
Invitin' niggas into the temple they call the body
Now everybody got it, had it, talked about it amongst they friends
Comin' around my crew lookin' jazzy, wanna pretend
Like you Ms. Goody Four-Shoes
Even Bo knew that you got poked
Like acupuncture patients
While our nation is a boat, straight sinkin'
I hate thinkin' that these the future mamas of our chill'un
They fuckin' a different nigga every time
They get the feelin' to
I'm willin' to go the extra kilo-meter
Just to see my se√±orita get her pillow
On the side of my bed where no good ever stay
House and doctor was the games we used to play
But now it's real, Jazzy Belle (yeah)

See what if you was a playa, real playa not no flaw
Havin' the very best of life lots of steak and Perignon
Smokin' an ounce of weed and every sin'le day was personal FreakNik
Trickin' these hoes in Polo clothes, life as you conceived it
But your conception, deception, lookin' into your eyes I see
You weapon and it's depressin'
They're diggin' up in your thighs
Leavin' deposits keep your closets open knockin' your boots and drawers
Hopin' to get you sprung like bail-bonds
Steadily callin' me Antwan
'Cause you thinkin' that you my lady, bitch, don't play me 'cause you're janky
I wanted to hit that ass but me and the Goodie we got danky
So thank thee, for runnin' that Southerplayalistic game
You was the only one to blame
A nigga don't even know your name
It's a shame, you crackin' 'em up and fuckin' a nigga like 2Pac up
I'm leavin' these foes to be the flowers and wake don't get me see
I gotta be feedin' my daughter
Teach her to be that natural woman (right)
'Cause you'll be waitin' to exhale while you other hoes be
Dumb and dumber, yeah you know what I'm sayin'

See me and ol' girl, in the black on black 'Lac no star (sta0
Windows are tinted so that no one knows who us are (are)
Talk bad about her nigga guaranteed to snap like bra (bra)
Strap, stickin' together like grandma and grandpa-pa
In this dog-eat-dog world (world)
Kitty cats be scratchin' on my
Furry coat to curl (curl)
Up with me and my bowl of kibbles and bits
I want to earl (earl)
'Cause most of the girls that we was likin' in high school
Now they dykein' (haha)

Havin' no mercy for the disrespect-ful ones, some
Be hangin' around the crew lookin' for funds, dumb
Deaf and fine, they be askin' me all about mine
How she doin', how she be?
I know she's sippin' that wine
Behind my back they squawk like vultures
Off and On like Trends of Cultures baby
Hey, he, fakin' it like these sculptured nails
But they can go to hell and lay with Lucifer
'Cause they burnin' anyway, Big Boi user and abuser
