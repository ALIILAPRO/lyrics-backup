		  Afterlife
Oh, what a terrible thought
'Cause I've lived without you once before
We don't, we don't have to do this again
Please don't, please don't make me start this again

And oh my love
Your beauty will consume me in the end

It was only ever you
It was only ever you
My baby, it feels like a lifetime
Oh God, I don't think I could do two

Afterlife
You can tell your God he can keep his salvation
And if you like, the angels can fly into the sun
We don't, we don't have to do this again
Please don't, please don't make me start this again

It was only ever you
It was only ever you
My baby, it feels like a lifetime
Oh God, I don't think I could do two

My soul is tortured with love and lust and hate
My cracked lips are unkissed for a million days
My infected heart, it's bleeding in this cage
I'm losing my dignity, not got long left to wait

It was only ever you
It was only ever you
My baby, it feels like a lifetime
Oh God, I don't think I could do two
