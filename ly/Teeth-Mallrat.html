		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's in my hair, in my sleep
In my hands, in my teeth
It's in my chair, it looks like me
And when it stands, I take my seat

It's in the air that I breathe
Under stairs, it's up my sleeve
Well, in my head, it's in my sleep
With my hands, in my teeth

(In my sleep)

In my prayer, I don't speak
But with my hands and on my knees
When I ask, I receive
Don't play fair, don't be sweet

It's in the air that I breathe
Understand it's up my sleeve
Well, in my head, it's in my sleep
With my hands, in my teeth

(In my sleep)
(In my sleep)

(In my sleep)
(In my sleep)
(In my sleep)
