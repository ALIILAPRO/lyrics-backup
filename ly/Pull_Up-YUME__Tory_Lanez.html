		  I got lots of cash on me, cash on me
Bad bitch I'm 'bout to smash on, smash on 
Broke 200 on the dash on it, dash on it
I pull up and hit the gas on 'em, gas on 'em, yeah
I got lots of cash on me, cash on me
Got a bad bitch, finna smash on her, smash on
Got 200 on the dash on it, dash on it
I pull up and hit the gas on 'em, gas on 'em, yeah, yeah, yeah

You know I got that cash on me
Shawty you ain't gotta ask, you know me
Got them racks all in my jeans
She down to fuck, you know what's up
She ridin' with my team, yeah
I've been serving up the trap, yeah
Riding foreigns swerving off through the traffic
Count it up and do the math, yeah
Got that OG in my blunt and I don't pass it
'Cause we get dough, yeah you know
Just count it up, girl you know you want more
We hit the club and you know we gon' blow it
Go get them racks shawty

I got lots of cash on me, cash on me
Bad bitch I'm 'bout to smash on, smash on 
Broke 200 on the dash on it, dash on it
I pull up and hit the gas on 'em, gas on 'em, yeah
I got lots of cash on me, cash on me
Got a bad bitch, finna smash on her, smash on
Got 200 on the dash on it, dash on it
I pull up and hit the gas on 'em, gas on 'em, yeah, yeah, yeah

Pour it up and we gon' roll it down
If I fuck you shawty hold it down
Only got one night 'cause we from outta town
Heard your nigga ball but he's so out of bounds, oh yeah
Out in CO, trappin' with the Mando'
Juggin' and finessing off a Samsung
Shooters that'll take you niggas out your body (out your body)
While I'm out getting my bands up
You know when I pull up I be causing propaganda
Know I'm cooler than the ice off in a Fanta
You see me skatin' 450 yeah, yeah
Dave tell me why these niggas hatin'

I got lots of cash on me, cash on me
Bad bitch I'm 'bout to smash on, smash on 
Broke 200 on the dash on it, dash on it
I pull up and hit the gas on 'em, gas on 'em, yeah
I got lots of cash on me, cash on me
Got a bad bitch, finna smash on her, smash on
Got 200 on the dash on it, dash on it
I pull up and hit the gas on 'em, gas on 'em, yeah, yeah, yeah

I love the way she pop it, buss it on the floor
Waitress bringin' bottles told her bring some more
I got hella bands and yeah that for sure
Sparkles in my section like a light show
We ain't done finessing, gettin' mulla
When I'm in the cut I'm with my shooters
You ain't with the shits so leave that out the door
If you ain't gettin money what you in it for?
Love the feeling when I'm whippin' in the Benz, ridin' it down on Ocean
Love the feeling when I'm counting the bands, gettin' in and out of the road
Gettin money, blue hunnids
Pineapple soda with lean in it
Hit a lick, cash out
You know my niggas be scheming

I got lots of cash on me, cash on me
Bad bitch I'm 'bout to smash on, smash on 
Broke 200 on the dash on it, dash on it
I pull up and hit the gas on 'em, gas on 'em, yeah
I got lots of cash on me, cash on me
Got a bad bitch, finna smash on her, smash on
Got 200 on the dash on it, dash on it
I pull up and hit the gas on 'em, gas on 'em, yeah, yeah, yeah
