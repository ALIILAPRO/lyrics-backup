		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is my love too much, or is it just enough
For you, for you?
'Cause it's gettin' late, would you like to stay?
Ah, 'cause I'm bad at readin' signs

But I, I wanna do whatever you wanna do
If you wanted to, girl, we could cross that line
Know we've been friends and love only knows broken ends
Yeah, that's what you said, but girl, let me change your mind

Mm, mm
Mm, 'cause feelings are hard to find
Mm, mm
Mm, feelings are hard

But I feel 'em in my chest, a tiny war within
But when I pull you closer, girl, I can't explain

But I, I wanna do whatever you wanna do
If you wanted to, girl, we could cross that line
Know we've been friends and love only knows broken ends
Yeah, that's what you said, but girl, let me change your mind

Mm, mm
Mm, 'cause feelings are hard to find
Mm, mm
Mm, feelings are hard, yeah

And I know, and I know that it hurts sometimes
That it hurts sometimes when I'm with you
And I know, and I know that it hurts sometimes
That it hurts sometimes, but I miss you
And I know, and I know that it's on your mind
That it's on your mind when I kiss you
But I wanna do whatever you wanna do

I wanna do whatever you wanna do
If you wanted to, girl, we could cross that line
Know we've been friends and love only knows broken ends
Yeah, that's what you said, but girl, let me change your mind

Mm, mm
Mm, 'cause feelings are hard to find
Mm, mm
Mm, feelings are hard to find, yeah
