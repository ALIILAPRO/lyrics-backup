		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fill me in on your new vision
Wake me up with indecision
Help me trust your mighty wisdom
Yes I eat cow, I am not proud

Show me how you question, questions
Lead the way to my temptation
Take my hand and give it cleaning
Yes I eat cow, I am not proud

Easy in an easy chair
Poop as hard as rock
I don't like you anyway
Seal it in a box

I'm you
I'm you

Fill me in on your new vision
Wake me up with indecision
Help me trust your mighty wisdom
Yes I eat cow, I am not proud

Show me how you question, question
Lead the way to my gestation
Take my hand and give it cleaning
Yes I eat cow, I am not proud

Easy in an easy chair
Poop as hard as rock
I don't like you anyway
Seal it in a box

I'm you
I'm you
I'm you
I'm you, ahh
