		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  First things first, we been rippin'
Get it in, cudder
Niggas know the name, it's none other
I know you know me, the double O repper
Do you step a gun toter nana, smoke kusher
I know you lovin' how I do it when I switch up the nizzame
Skinny nigga Diggy in ya city getting chizzange
Like I'm Carmelo, meet me in the gizzame
Yammin' on you sucka niggas, yammin on these hoes
Roll swishers in the whip, with the pistol quick
As now whiskey motherfucka, we up in this bitch
Hoes love cooder, smooth duder, cudua
I am climbing, I am climbing, and I know why

Y'all know I keep it funky motherfucka, better get it right,
Get it right, better get it right, get it right
Ooh ho, ooh ho yeah
And I'll be rockin' along zonin'
In movin' along zonin,
Ooh ho, ooh ho yeah

Hey, doin' what I want, no need to front
Skinny and tatted the fuck up
They pass me the blunts, baby get up
We in this bitch, laxin'
Dennis know the game, he in the crowd mackin'
All up off the dome, no need to pin it friend
Me and my nigga we gettin' in
Told my man plain pat, dog ever since day one
We gon' get it poppin', that's what I'm in for
If you knew me man, I don't really worry bout a nigga tryna judge
Who are you? Judy! Girl shake ya feather, do ya thing till you feel right
I know you know the name, the team we takin' this aiight

Y'all know I keep it funky motherfucka, better get it right,
Get it right, better get it right, get it right
Ooh ho, ooh ho yeah
And I'll be rockin' along zonin'
In movin' along zonin,
Ooh ho, ooh ho yeah

Life, together
We all in together now
All in together, all, all baby get it all in together now

Life, together
We all in together now
All in together, all, all baby get it all in together now

Doin' what I need, hater rhyme L.K.
How many times I tell em we don't care what people say
Even if I do something unruly, I be like "Fuck a nigga I was probably zooted"
Off the top, honestly, the kush and goose combination harmful G
Found my own rhythm while I'm lookin' through my Viennas
Everybody could talk that shit until they see em
Then they all on my ball sack, word
The night bounds and they sayin' I'm absurd
Ya old jive ass nigga look around, hey you be around
Fam' I'm in the clouds

Y'all know I keep it funky motherfucka, better get it right,
Get it right, better get it right, get it right
Ooh ho, ooh ho yeah
And I'll be rockin' along zonin'
In movin' along zonin,
Ooh ho, ooh ho yeah

Y'all know I keep it funky motherfucka, better get it right,
Get it right, better get it right, get it right
Ooh ho, ooh ho yeah
And I'll be rockin' along zonin'
In movin' along zonin,
Ooh ho, ooh ho yeah
