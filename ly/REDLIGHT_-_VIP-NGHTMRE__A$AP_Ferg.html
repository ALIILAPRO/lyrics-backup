		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ferg
Hoo, hoo, hoo, ayy

I feel like I'm a giant but I'm 5'8"
I feel more defiant when y'all hate
Y'all the only niggas runnin' in the car race
Serve a nigga with the butter like parquet 
(Yeah)
Rap niggas all soft, so strange
I'm a little bit of Pac, bit of Kanye
You a little bit of Fox and Beyonc√© 
(Right)
Any beef come to me get sauteed
Yeah, the fake ones runnin' with the hard face
Bet that pump to your tongue make your heart race 
(Grr)
And I hope you take it all the wrong way
Leave you slumped near the pump, near the bar place
This red light put your ass in a dark place

You a trill nigga, get your muthafuckin' hands up
You a real nigga, get your muthafuckin' hands up
You a real nigga, get your muthafuckin' bands up
You a real nigga, get your muthafuckin' hands up

Celebration, coronation
No debatin', crown me king, I'm tired of waitin' (yeah)
People's champ, I gotta face it
You disgracin', people sensin' that you're fakin'
I'm the Lord, I might go Satan
With the flow and take 'em out, annihilate 'em (yeah)
No mistakin', new sensation
Hood Pope pullin' up to rule the nation (alright)
And I came a long way from the stash house (yeah)
Now I switch spots like a Dalmatian (right)
Little kid played by the crack house (yeah)
And I got my moms out when my ass paid (alright)
Gotta understand when I black out (yeah)
I don't give a fuck 'bout a wack hater
I don't give a fuck 'bout no rap favor
Need to bow to the Lord and say all your prayers

You a trill nigga, get your muthafuckin' hands up
You a real nigga, get your muthafuckin' hands up
You a real nigga, get your muthafuckin' bands up
You a real nigga, get your muthafuckin' hands up

Ferg (Ferg, Ferg, Ferg, Ferg)
