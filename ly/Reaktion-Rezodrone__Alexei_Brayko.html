		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now I'll show you everything
Right now The truth behind the veil
Now I'll give you everything
Right now Then take it all away all away

Love is a reaction, just a distraction
A game that all of us play
You could be the only, not just the lonely
But you keep running away
Time is an illusion, have no confusion
There's just the here and the now
Why are you the reason that I'm believing
We could have freedom somehow

Now I'll show you everything
Right now The truth behind the veil
Now I'll give you everything
Right now Then take it all away all away

Choking on your delusion, fatally wounded
I'm just a desperate shell
Wasted a pile of ashes, broken and tragic
Dry in desolate well

Don't need another second, just take the pill and swallow
Your thoughts belong to me now, the only one you'll follow
Don't need another second, just take the pill and swallow
Your thoughts belong to me now, the only one you'll follow

I can't feel anything at all how could I let you
Open me up and watch me fall and never lift me up

I can't feel anything at all how could I let you
Open me up and watch me fall and never lift me up

I can't feel anything at all how could I let you
Open me up and watch me fall and never lift me up
