		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you want money in your pocket
And a top hat on your head
A hot meal on your table
And a blanket on your bed

Well today is grey skies
Tomorrow is tears
You'll have to wait til yesterday is here

Well, I'm going to New York City
And I'm leaving on a train
And if you want to stay behind
And wait til I come back again

Today's grey skies
Tomorrow is tears
You'll have to wait til yesterday's here

If you want to go
Where rainbows end
You'll have to say goodbye
All our dreams come true, baby up ahead
And it's out where your memories lie

Well, the road is out before me
And the moon is shining bright
What I want you to remember as I disappear tonight

Well, today's grey skies
Tomorrow's tears
You'll have to wait til yesterday is here

Well, today's grey skies
Tomorrow's tears
You'll have to wait til yesterday's here
You'll have to wait til yesterday's here
You'll have to wait til yesterday's here
