		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How do I word this verse?
It's so much work at first, it goes
How should I word this verse?
It's so much work the further, the further you go

Go, take off a load
Letting your wings unfold
They're keeping everything down to a minimum
Everything a bit low
Tell 'em what you know, not all that you know, though
The truth be told you need it more than you thought
But you're managing, that's how you evened out, out

Keep on walking that line, the fine line
Between a wrong and a right
You get yours, I'm gonna get mine
Is that what you signed for?
They're feeding you lines
To keep you on their side
It works every time

What you got to live for
And now you got the whole of the world at your feet
And how much more can you pass yourself 'round?
What you got to live for
Now you got the whole of the world at your feet
But you're still shaking
You need to make up some ground

Go, take off a load
Letting your wings unfold
They're keeping everything down to a minimum
Everything a bit low
Tell 'em what you know, not all that you know, though
The truth be told you need it more than you thought
But you're managing, that's how you evened out, out
