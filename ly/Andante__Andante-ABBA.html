		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take it easy with me, please 
Touch me gently like a summer evening breeze 
Take your time, make it slow 
Andante, Andante 
Just let the feeling grow 

Make your fingers soft and light 
Let your body be the velvet of the night 
Touch my soul, you know how 
Andante, Andante 
Go slowly with me now 

I'm your music (I am your music and I am your song) 
I'm your song (I'm your music and I am your song) 
Play me time and time again and make me strong 
(Play me again 'cause you're making me strong) 
Make me sing, make me sound 
(You make me sing and you make me) 
Andante, Andante 
Tread lightly on my ground 
Andante, Andante 
Oh please, don't let me down 

There's a shimmer in your eyes 
Like the feelin' of a thousand butterflies 
Please don't talk, go on, play 
Andante, Andante 
And let me float away 

I'm your music (I am your music and I am your song) 
I'm your song (I'm your music and I am your song) 
Play me time and time again and make me strong 
(Play me again 'cause you're making me strong) 
Make me sing, make me sound 
(You make me sing and you make me) 
Andante, Andante 
Tread lightly on my ground 
Andante, Andante 
Oh please, don't let me down 

Make me sing, make me sound 
(You make me sing and you make me) 
Andante, Andante 
Tread lightly on my ground 
Andante, Andante 
Oh please, don't let me down 
Andante, Andante 
Oh please, don't let me down
