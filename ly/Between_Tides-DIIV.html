		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On and on, the clock was wrong
You've been numb so long
His words, they lapped an endless rote
It's gonna rain, build a boat

On masterstrokes of ebb and flow
Down the drain the current flows
All along the alpenglow
It seems my pain was self-imposed

I'm just waiting for the storm to die out, out
I'm just waiting for the storm to die out
I'm just waiting for the storm to die

On and on, in memory
You'll have my company
Mountain building, anodynes
Both in handfuls at a time

I asked the trees why they grow
They said, "It's all we know"
I apologize to all I see
For everything I used to be

On and on, the clock was slow
Down the drain, we surely know
How to drink the oceans up
Better start with a cup

I'm just waiting for the storm to die out
