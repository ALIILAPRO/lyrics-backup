		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, this what we doin'?
I don't even gotta say I'm the queen of my city no more, man
They know I'm the queen, man, they already jacked that
Yeah, man

I could never lose, what you thought?
Bitch, I'm the queen of New York
It's Red Lyfe, I'm a big stepper (big stepper)
I bleed when I walk, big flexer
This is chess not checkers (uh-huh)
All my checks up
When they talk down, tell 'em, "Bless up" (bless up)
I ain't givin' no lecture (no)
Cognac got me charged up like a Tesla (mm)
Foot on they necks, pressure (pressure)
So many people let me down, why would I let up? (Why?)
Can't trust these friendly niggas, nah, it's a set up (nah)
I can't trust these pretty bitches, M-O-B forever (Mob)
Yeah, my heart told me, "Fuck love, get your shit together" (uh-huh)
Yeah, and when you take a couple L's, you gon' win forever (hmm)
Give up? I'll never (I'll never)
I don't give a fuck what you did first, I probably did it better (uh-huh)
Yeah, six years independent, winnin', will it end? Never (never)
I'm a livin' legend, even when I die, I'ma live forever (I'ma live forever)

I'm one word with ten letters
Successful
I'm one word with ten letters
Successful

Yeah, I'm God's gift but that boss shit
I'm the big devil (I'm the big demon)
Can't trick me, if she a gold digger
I'm the big shovel (she the big treesh)
I like a thick bitch with a thick bank
And a thick schedule (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Yeah, and I'm the shit, bitch
And ain't shit changed, just a different level (mm-hmm)

Yeah, I'm one word with ten letters
Successful (mm-hmm)
I'm one word with ten letters
Successful

And I'm top ten, and if you think otherwise
Suck my dick 
I got it locked and I'm locked in (uh-huh)
We cut different, I am not them (not them)
This RedLyfe and we tied in
They got me and I got them (RedLyfe)
He say I'ma go to Hell for all of this sinnin'
Well, let me rot then (uh-huh)
It's time off for your niggas when I put the time (huh?)
No handouts, I put the grind in (huh?)
Got in my bag and I got rich when I climbed in (hmm)
They clock out when I clock in (uh)
'Cause I'm the big spitter
Only competition I would probably have (is what?)
Is a twin sister
