		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  O Holy Night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and ever pining
'Til He appeared and the spirit felt its worth
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees
O hear the angel voices
O night divine
O the night when Christ was born
(O Holy night the stars are brightly shining)

Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains He shall break for the slave is our brother
And in His name all oppression shall cease
O the world, the star is sweetly gleaming
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we

Fall on your knees
O hear the angel voices
O night divine
O the night when Christ was born
O night divine

O the night when Christ was born
When Christ was born
When Christ was born
