		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What has your heart been like
It used to spend weeks on my mind 
But it's been 7 months of these lies 
And you know it hasn't felt right 
I need to be loved by myself 
Before I'll love someone else 
And that's not you
That's not you, anymore 

I'm just tryna live with myself 
And you have to do that as well
My heart aches to see you like this 
Pretending it's me that you'll miss 
You need to be loved by yourself 
It's okay to ask for help
But not from me 
Not from me, anymore, oh, oh

I need to be loved by myself 
It's okay to ask for help
But not from you
Not from you, anymore 

I started to take my advice 
I'm still staying out late at night 
But now I'm not worried 'bout fights
Or if I've said something you don't like 
Just being in love with myself 
With you it was something else 
You're not for me, me

I couldn't take it no more 
Let me free, I'll close the door 
It was killing me
It was killing me
It was killing me
Now I can see what was left 
It weighs heavy on my chest 
It was killing me 
It was killing me
It was killing me

Now that we've said our goodbyes 
I see you in all that's alive 
Your voice still haunts me at night 
But this time it don't make me cry (cry)
Just tryna be real with myself 
Love can sometimes hurt like hell
Just let it be 
Just let it be
Just let it be 

I couldn't take it no more 
Let me free, I'll close the door 
It was killing me
It was killing me
It was killing me
Now I can see what was left 
It weighs heavy on my chest 
It was killing me 
It was killing me
It was killing me

I need to be loved by myself 
Before I'll love someone else 
And that's not you
That's not you, anymore
