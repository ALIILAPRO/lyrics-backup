		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sunlight coming through the haze 
No gaps in the blind, to let it inside
The bed is unmade, some music still plays
TV, yeah, it's always on
A flicker on the screen, a movie actress screams 
I'm basking in the shit, flowing out of it
I'm stoned in the mall again 
Terminally bored, shuffling round the stores
And shoplifting is getting so last year's thing
Xbox is a god to me 
A finger on the switch, my mother is a bitch
My father gave up ever trying to talk to me

Don't try engaging me 
The vaguest of shrugs, the prescription drugs 
You'll never find, a person inside
My face is mogadon
Curiosity, has given up on me
I'm tuning out desires, the pills are on the rise

How can I be sure I'm here? 
The pills that I've been taking confuse me
I need to know that someone sees that
There's nothing left, I simply am not here

I'm through with pornography 
The acting is lame, the action is tame 
Explicitly dull, arousal annulled
Your mouth should be boarded up 
Talking all day, with nothing to say 
Your shallow proclamations, all misinformation
My friend says he wants to die 
He's in a band, they sound like Pearl Jam
The clothes are all black, the music is crap
In school I don't concentrate 
And sex is kinda fun but just another one 
Of all the empty ways of using up a day

How can I be sure I'm here? 
The pills that I've been taking confuse me
I need to know that someone sees that
There's nothing left, I simply am not here

Bipolar disorder
Can't deal with the boredom
Bipolar disorder
Can't deal with the boredom

You don't try to be liked
You don't mind
You feel no sun
You steal a gun
To kill time
You're somewhere, you're nowhere
You don't care
You catch the breeze
You still the leaves
So now where?
