		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (We can never be friends)

I hate that I saw you again last night
You were with somebody and so was I
Met you in the bathroom at 12:05
And I fucked you again
We can never be friends, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm not myself
I'm not myself when you're around, no
Can't be helped
We are insane, that's just the way it goes

I'm a demon in the night
She's an angel with the white
Told me keep on all the lights
I'ma show you what you like
Help you put back on your clothes
Make sure nothing's on your nose
Ain't even tell my closest homies, nobody knows

I hate that I saw you again last night
You were with somebody and so was I
Met you in the bathroom at 12:05
And I fucked you again
We can never be friends, yeah, yeah, yeah

I couldn't cry
I need to smoke, I'm feeling sick inside
From seeing you next to a friend of mine
We didn't speak but I read your mind
Both telling lies, our alibis didn't work this time

I'm a demon in the night
She's an angel with the white
Told her keep on all the lights
You can show me what you like
Help me put back on my clothes
Make sure nothing's on my nose
Can't even tell my closest homies, nobody knows

I hate that I saw you again last night
You were with somebody and so was I
Met you in the bathroom at 12:05
And I fucked you again
We can never be friends, yeah, yeah, yeah

We can never be friends, yeah, yeah, yeah
(We can never be friends, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We can never be friends
We can never be friends, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, I know that I said I was at home
Okay, yeah, you caught me
I thought that you said you were all alone
Look at you lying

I hate that I saw you again last night
You were with somebody and so was I
Met you in the bathroom at 12:05
And I fucked you again
We can never be friends, yeah, yeah, yeah

We can never be friends, yeah, yeah, yeah
(We can never be friends, yeah) Yeah (yeah, yeah) yeah
We can never be friends
We can never be friends, yeah, yeah, yeah
