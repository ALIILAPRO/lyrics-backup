		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Life's a world of fantasy
I'll tell you how:
See the world of TV and you will know
The man's amazing
He'll set you free
Come get this feeling
Turn on your TV!
Lonely streets at midnight
Don't be afraid
Standing at the corner
Smoking cigarettes
The quiet observer
Waiting for his match
Someone to catch
Don't cry.
Agent of liberty
Agent of liberty
Agent of liberty
Oh oh
Come on and set me free!
Oh
Oh
Of liberty - Agent - fighting for me!
Spread out sympathy
Enioy the fun
Find out reality tor everyone.
Judge of death or live
Fighting for justice
Never impassive
That's his way of live!
Agent of liberty
Agent of liberty
. . .
Check it out midnight
Don't get up tight
Downtown streets and the kind of trouble you meet
Just call your agent of liberty
And 1 - 2 - 3 he'll set you free
That's on your own
Dial double zero and the three
And get free
Get free
It's easy agent of liberty!
Agent from television fighting for special missions
Dial channel 003
Get free
Get free
Get free!
Oh oh
Of liberty - Agent Fighting for me
Agent oF liberty - Agent of liberty!
