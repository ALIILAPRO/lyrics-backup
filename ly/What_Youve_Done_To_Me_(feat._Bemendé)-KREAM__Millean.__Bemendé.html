		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fine boy, you don't know what you done to me
I can't sleep at night, you're on my mind constantly
Fine boy, do you know what you done to me?
I can't sleep at night, you're on my mind

Fine boy
Fine boy
Fine boy
Fine boy

Fine boy, you don't know what you done to me
I can't sleep at night, you're on my mind constantly
Fine boy, do you know what you done to me?
I can't sleep at night, you're on my mind

Don't know what you done to me
Don't know what you done to me

Fine boy, you don't know what you done to me
I can't sleep at night, you're on my mind constantly
Fine boy, do you know what you done to me?
I can't sleep at night, you're on my mind

Feelin' some kind of way
About you makin' me weak
You're enticin' me
I feel it's best if I stay
Away from you and your charm
You can do any harm, you're hurting me

Fine boy
Fine boy

Fine boy, you don't know what you done to me
I can't sleep at night, you're on my mind constantly
Fine boy, do you know what you done to me?
I can't sleep at night, you're on my mind

Don't know what you done to me

Feelin' some kind of way
About you makin' me weak
You're enticin' me
I feel it's best if I stay
Away from you and your charm
You can do any harm, you're hurting me
Fine boy
