		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know you go broke trying to handle me
Take it from someone who know how to handle me
I'ma need that real grown kind of energy (ah)
Do you know? Do you know?
'Cause you dealing with a lot of competition
You gonna have to do a lot of ass kissing
You know I got someone with the time to listen
Tell me boy, do you know? Do you know?

I-I-I-I-I
Do it every night
Show me a good time
You can too, I let you try try, try, try, try
Oh, this right here your chance
Learn it from the best
Here's what you gotta do

Treat me like I treat me
(Booty, booty, booty, booty rockin' everywhere)
Yeah, you know I do it right
(Booty, booty, booty, booty rockin' everywhere)
Treat me like I treat me
(Booty, booty, booty, booty rockin' everywhere)
Oh, I make me feel so nice
Treat me like I treat me, love me (rockin' everywhere)
Like I love me completely and deeply, oh
Ooh, treat me like I treat me

Exceptional
You know anything less is unacceptable
Don't get me wrong, I'm flexible
But only in other ways my legs can go
Confessional
I'm skeptical
'Cause being on my level is difficult
You better wake up and put me on a pedestal
I bet you know, I know, do you know?

I-I-I-I-I
Do it every night
Show me a good time
You can too, I let you try try, try, try, try
Oh, this right here your chance (chance)
Learn it from the best (from the best)
Here's what you gotta do

Treat me like I treat me
(Booty, booty, booty, booty rockin' everywhere)
Yeah, you know I do it right
(Booty, booty, booty, booty rockin' everywhere)
Treat me like I treat me
(Booty, booty, booty, booty rockin' everywhere)
Oh, I make me feel so nice
Treat me like I treat me, love me (rockin' everywhere)
Like I love me completely and deeply, oh
Ooh, treat me like I treat me

Treat me, baby (yeah, you know I do it right)
Yeah, you know I do it right (treat me like I treat me)
Oh (oh, I make me feel so nice)
Oh (treat me like I treat me)
Oh (love me)
(Like I love me completely and deeply now)
Now (now)
Ooh, treat me like I treat me
