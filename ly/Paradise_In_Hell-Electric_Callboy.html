		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can I get a ouh ouh
Now bitches give me ouh ouh
Here we go now
Show me what you've got! Show me what you've got!
Grab the tequila, let's have a body shot
Show me what you've got, show me what you've got!
Grab the tequila, let's have a body shot

Have you seen the bright shining lights down at the Sunset Strip?
Have you seen the girls with the burgundy lipstick?
Do you need some cash, a car, a gun or anything else?
Go get your keys to a paradise in hell

We never have saved a dollar, we never have missed a single night
When the sky's changing colors, bring it all back now, bring it all back tonight
We never have saved a dollar, we never lost faith in our hearts
When the sky's changing colors, bring it all back now, bring it back tonight

Welcome to our neighborhood. Hail to the king of frauds
Shake your booty for a single malt shot
Sip the champagne, put the dollars in her thong
Don't ask about my business, party all night long

Every single moment in my life's called success
Every fucking party's just a sexual excess
Tonight we're getting drunk, darling, like in a movie scene
Just take a seat in the devil's black limousine

We never have saved a dollar, we never have missed a single night
When the sky's changing colors, bring it all back now, bring it all back tonight
We never have saved a dollar, we never lost faith in our hearts
When the sky's changing colors, bring it all back now, bring it back tonight

Gold teeth, gold watch, my money spend on stripper's crotch
Baby, tell me who's your daddy that the cops never caught
If you need a friend just call me anytime
If you need a job, I'm your brother in crime

Every single moment in my life's called success
Every fucking party's just a sexual excess
Tonight we're getting drunk, darling, like in a movie scene
Just take a seat in the devil's black limousine

Uh yeah
And everyday I'm chillin' with da homies in my crib
Countin' all my money like the toys of a kid
Rockin' bitches down like a sex machine
Since I'm sixteen it's a business routine bitch
Dollars gonna make my dreams come true. Stay like the ink of a fresh tattoo
And every single moment that reminds me of the past
Life is short and always too fast

It's always too fast
All the times that I'm missing in my life
Bring it back tonight
