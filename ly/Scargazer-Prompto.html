		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You love me
Alright
I love you
Fly me to fly me to
Fly me to the moon I'll dance among the stars
Fly me to fly me to
Fly me to the moon I'll dance among the stars
Can I fly you to the moon
Can we play among the stars
I've been thinking of you lately
Took control over my heart
You say that you needed space
Atmosphere was in my arms
When I look up at your face
The reflection shows the scars
So I'll fly you to the moon
Where we float among the stars
Darkest ocean ever known
But the lights come from a far
I wish this would never end
I've been trying to pretend
Somethings wrong and it's within
The reflection seems to win
Why'd you leave me
Why'd I say no
Sometimes our mistakes
Open up our souls
Really lost myself
Yet I didn't know
All these thoughts all these marks really took a toll and
Somethin been buggin me but I won't say it
I've got a tendency, feeling so vacant
All of these memories being adjacent
You were the one I shoved in the pavement
I Pushed you away by hating my self
Feeling so strange don't know how it felt
Thought I was good but faltered my health
It wasn't you I was stuck in my cell
Fly me to fly me to
Fly me to the moon I'll dance among the stars
Fly me to fly me to
Fly me to the moon I'll dance among the stars
You need to forgive yourself
I Can't
Can I fly you to the moon
can we play among the stars
I've been thinking of you lately
Took control over my heart
You say that you needed space
atmosphere was in my arms
When I look up at your face
The reflection shows the scars
so I'll fly you to the moon
Where we float among the stars
Darkest ocean ever known
But the lights come from a far
I wish this would never end
I've been trying to pretend
Somethings wrong and it's within
The reflection seems to win
