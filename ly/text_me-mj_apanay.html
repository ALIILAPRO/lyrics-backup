		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I used to fall so hard for you
Laid out all my cards for you
Waitin' for your messages all day
You'd hit me up, I'd rush to you
And it didn't mean much to you
But you'd keep smiling at me anyway

And I was patient
I thought one day you'd say it
But it got more complicated
'Cause you didn't want my love
Now I'm done wasting my time on you just waiting
'Cause you're just having fun
You never wanted us

Don't text me
I don't wanna see my phone light up
From somebody I don't wanna think of
You had me waiting and waiting 
I've waited enough
Don't text me
I don't wanna hear from you again
Telling me you still wanna be friends
Don't text me, don't text me, yeah

Waiting and waiting and waiting for love
Waiting and waiting I've waited enough

Don't ask me how I'm doing I don't need to tell you shit
I don't care about you or the new guy that you're with
Send me a message I'm ghostin' your ass
Tell me you left him still ghostin' your ass
I don't want anything to do with your ass
I'm through with your ass
Bad news with your ass

And we both knew
The only one you're close to
Was me but you still chose to
Not care for me at all
So I'll show you
Nobody else could know you
The way I did before
Don't fuck with me no more

Don't text me
I don't wanna see my phone light up
From somebody I don't wanna think of
You had me waiting and waiting 
I've waited enough
Don't text me
I don't wanna hear from you again
Telling me you still wanna be friends
Don't text me, don't text me
Don't text me
I don't wanna see my phone light up
From somebody I don't wanna think of
You had me waiting and waiting 
I've waited enough
Don't text me
I don't wanna hear from you again
Telling me you still wanna be friends
Don't text me, don't text me, yeah
