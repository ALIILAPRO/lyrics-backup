		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You ain't kill nobody
You ain't off them Percs, you ain't off them Xans, you ain't off that molly
You ain't never been down bad, huh? That's a lie
You ain't never had no swag, that's why you stealing mine
You ain't never put a bad bitch in designer
You ain't never took a bitch on a shopping spree just because she fine
You ain't never made no million bitch, yeah, I know you lyin'
I'm on the way to a billion, it's gon' happen overtime
Yeah, it's gon' happen overtime

But I'm in fourth quarter
I got forty pointers on my neck, I'm scorer
I been scorin' drank all day 'cause I'm a lean pourer
Lil' shawty brain insane, yeah, yeah, she deserve an award, yeah
She a real whore, yeah

You ain't kill nobody
You ain't off them Percs, you ain't off them Xans, you ain't off that molly
You ain't never been down bad, huh? That's a lie
You ain't never had no swag, that's why you stealing mine
You ain't never put a bad bitch in designer
You ain't never took a bitch on a shopping spree just because she fine
You ain't never made no million bitch, yeah, I know you lyin'
I'm on the way to a billion, it's gon' happen overtime
Yeah, it's gon' happen overtime
