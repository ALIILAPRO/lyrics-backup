		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tonight,
Give me, Give me, love my baby
Tonight,
Oh, oh, oh
Tonight,
Tonight,
Give me, Give me, love my baby

Hey,
Never thought I'd fall in love this way,
This is our night why don't you stay?
Look into my eyes and say 'I wanna be with you'.

You'll always be
The guiding light for me,
The owner of my soul;
You are the one who makes me loose control.
'Cause deep inside my heart,
I just can't wait to be together again.

Stay with me now,
Stay with me tonight!
Give me give me love, my baby.
Stay with me now,
Stay with me tonight.
Give me give me love, my baby

Give me give me love, my baby
Tonight
Oh oh oh
Tonight
Tonight
Give me give me love, my baby

Hey,
Never thought I'd fall in love this way
This is our night why don't you stay?
Look into my eyes and say 'I wanna be with you'
