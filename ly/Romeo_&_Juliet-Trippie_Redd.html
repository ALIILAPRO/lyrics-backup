		  Love scars, skrrt, yeah
You, love letter to you
Ayy

Baby your love is my medicine
Baby your love is my medicine, when I'm up, bring me down
Your love is my medicine, lil' baby
Huh, your love is my medicine, when I'm up, bring me down
Ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Your love, baby your love

Hey, your love, is so amazing
It's all I want, got a nigga faded
Shawty on fire, and she really blazin'
Flames Armageddon, yelling Jesus save me
I'ma take her soul, if she try to play me
'Cause that's all mine, that's my lil' baby
I'm in all white, like the fucking eighties
Throwin' up the Roc', like a nigga Jay-Z
Ah, don't play me, no
Uh, no don't play me, no
Yeah, ay, no don't play me, no
Yeah, no don't play me, no

'Cause your love is my medicine
Ayy, your love is my medicine, when I'm up, bring me down
Your love is my medicine lil' baby
Huh, your love is my medicine, when I'm up, bring me down
Baby your love is my medicine
Baby your love is my medicine, when I'm up, bring me down
Your love is my medicine lil' baby
Huh, your love is my medicine, when I'm up, bring me down
Ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Your love, baby your love

Your love is my medicine
Baby, your love is my medicine, when I'm up, bring me down
Your love is my medicine, lil' baby
Your love is my medicine, when I'm up, bring me down
Ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Your love, baby your love
