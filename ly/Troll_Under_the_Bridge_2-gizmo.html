		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Emptied my brain, let it drain in a puddle
Feeding the maggots I walked away stumble
Down to the man with the mind of a puzzle
Steal all the pieces leave you in a muzzle
Piece all the parts of my brain back to one
Now I cannot stop thinkin' bout killin' for fun
All of the people that use me and run
Bleed out the fake in the public in sun
I don't give a fuck about a mother fucker
I don't give a fuck about a mother fuckin' soul
Nobody gon' ever give a fuck
If I died inside a truck, if I crashed into a pole
(Okay)

I swear I need to get my life back together
I killed a pig, ate it's meat, used it's skin for sweaters
I write my raps with pin point turkey feathers
I dip the bone in blood, write your name down in my killing planners

You won't do shit
All you do is talk shit
Mother fucker I'm still in this bitch
On my gizmo shit, every rapper counterfit
'Till burning up this oil slick
Better run so quick, that I never see you bitch
I'm splitting your neck and your wrists
I don't give one fuck, who the fuck you think you is
I'll make sure you'll never have kids

My knife is aiming for your heart
Ain't no reset ain't no restart
So who the fuck you think you are
You don't get another chance
I'm rippin' body parts
