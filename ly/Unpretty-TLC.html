		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish I could tie you up in my shoes
Make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful
But what does that mean to you?
Look into the mirror who's inside there
The one with the long hair
Same old me again today, yeah

My outsides look cool
My insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through
It's because of you
I've tried different ways
But it's all the same
At the end of the day
I have myself to blame
I'm just trippin'

You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make-up that MAC can make
But if you can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position to make me feel so
Damn unpretty
Yeah, I'll make you feel unpretty too

Never insecure until I met you
Now I'm bein' stupid
I used to be so cute to me
Just a little bit skinny
Why do I look to all these things
To keep you happy?
Maybe get rid of you and then I'll get back to me (hey)

My outsides look cool
My insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through
It's because of you
I've tried different ways 
But it's all the same
At the end of the day 
I have myself to blame
Can't believe I'm trippin', yeah

You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make-up that MAC can make
But if you can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position to make me feel so
Damn unpretty

You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make-up that MAC can make
But if you can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position to make me feel so
Damn unpretty
I'll make you feel unpretty too

I'll make you feel unpretty

Oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa-oh
Oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa-oh

You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make-up that MAC can make
But if you can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position to make me feel so
Damn unpretty

You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can buy all the make-up that MAC can make
But if you can't look inside you
Be in the position to make me feel so
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
