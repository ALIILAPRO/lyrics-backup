		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know the way the story goes
The first part is the fun
We leave the room a little cold
To keep each other warm

Just for a minute
'Fore the bombs are hidden
And every night it turns to war
Thought we had a vision
Don't know what I see in us
No more

'Cause we're halfway broken
Try to make up
Damage already done
And it's only one way down
Guess now I'll join the club

'Cause everyone falls so hard
And everything falls apart
But we know we still got heart
Here's to the broken ones

Here's to the broken ones
Broken
Here's to the broken ones

I used to know your breathing sounds
You'd sound me off to sleep
Oh we're just lying quiet now
Both wide awake but

Dreaming of the minute
'Fore the bombs were hidden
And every night it turns to war
Thought we had a vision
Don't know what I see in us
No more

'Cause we're halfway broken
Try to make up
Damage already done
And it's only one way down
Guess now I'll join the club

'Cause everyone falls so hard
And everything falls apart
But we know we still got heart
Here's to the broken ones
Here's to the broken ones
Here's to the broken ones
Here's to the broken ones
Here's to the broken ones

Here's to the broken ones
(Broken)
Here's to the broken ones
