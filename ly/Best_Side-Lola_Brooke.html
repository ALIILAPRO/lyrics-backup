		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh-huh-uh-huh

All these niggas get chastised
Naturally a baddie, double B's on the chest size
Big gator comin' straight outta Bedstuy
Put this coochie in a Lamb' but you still can't test drive
Better get my best side
Getty Images, catch the left side (hey, baby)
Better get my best side (ta-ta, ta-ta-ta)
I ain't worried 'bout a nigga, I'ma get mine (rah, ta-ta-ta)

Bitch, this not what you want (huh)
Back out them things, then we back out the trunk
Said I want a rough neck nigga on the tongue (hey, baby)
Twenty-four hours, day and night we gon' fuck, (uh-huh-uh-huh), uh
See, I don't know why they wanna fuck with me (fuck with me)
In my business, worried 'bout who fuck with me (fuck with me)
I ain't with the subtweetin', you could cut the memes (cut the memes)
Put a nigga face in it how the pums get cleaned (uh-huh-uh-huh)

All these niggas get chastised
Naturally a baddie, double B's on the chest size
Big gator comin' straight outta Bedstuy
Put this coochie in a Lamb' but you still can't test drive
Better get my best side
Getty Images, catch the left side (hey, baby)
Better get my best side (ta-ta, ta-ta-ta)
I ain't worried 'bout a nigga, I'ma get mine (rah, ta-ta-ta)

Stop dickridin' (huh), dick, dickridin' (huh)
I heard niggas in the streets out here 6ix9in'
I could prove facts, he abused that (huh)
Supposed to be my dawg, my nigga, why you do that?
When it's time to show my ass, know a bitch show up (know a bitch show up)
Know it's smoke for these niggas when the hitters roll up (roll up)
When the hate don't work, then the love slow up (slow up)
For the dead homies, 42 pour up (uh-huh-uh-huh-uh, pour up)

All these niggas get chastised
Naturally a baddie, double B's on the chest size
Big gator comin' straight outta Bedstuy
Put this coochie in a Lamb' but you still can't test drive
Better get my best side
Getty Images, catch the left side (hey, baby)
Better get my best side (ta-ta, ta-ta-ta)
I ain't worried 'bout a nigga, I'ma get mine (rah, ta-ta-ta)
