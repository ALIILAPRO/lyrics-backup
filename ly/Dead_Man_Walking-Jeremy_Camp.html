		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Freedom was something I never found
Trying to find six feet underground
Under the weight of all of my sin
Fighting the fight that I couldn't win

Then You rescued me
And now I can breathe

I was a dead man walking
Until I was a man walking with You
I was a blind man falling
'Til I felt the life You're calling me to
Pulling me out of the darkness and
Pulling me out of the lies
Putting the beat in my heart again
I was a dead man walking
Until You loved this dead man walking back to life

I look for the words but cannot explain
A new kind of love ran into my veins
You are the key to all of my chains
To all that I was, now I'm not a slave

Then You rescued me
And now I can breathe

I was a dead man walking
Until I was a man walking with You
I was a blind man falling
'Til I felt the life You're calling me to
Pulling me out of the darkness and
Pulling me out of the lies
Putting the beat in my heart again
I was a dead man walking
Until You loved this dead man walking back to life

I have tasted and I've seen the wonders of Your heart
I do not deserve a thing, but that's just who You are

I was a dead man walking
Until I was a man walking with You
I was a blind man falling
'Til I felt the life You're calling me to
Pulling me out of the darkness and
Pulling me out of the lies
Putting the beat in my heart again
I was a dead man walking
Until You loved this dead man walking back to life

I was a dead man walking
Until You loved this dead man back to life
