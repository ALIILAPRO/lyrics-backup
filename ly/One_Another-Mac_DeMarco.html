		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey kid, everybody's prone to some mistakes
If you'd always kept it straight, you'd never learn
You'd run the risk of all the risks you take
Don't feel like all the time you put in went to waste
The way your heart was beating all those days
And suddenly it beats another pace

It's not like you'd ever
Try to forget her
But these days are better
Without one another

Hey man, so now you've got it off your chest
Your heart can finally get some rest
Same heart that started this whole mess
And although a broken heart needs time to mend
Yours wasn't ever really broken, was it?
In losing love you gain a friend

It's not like you'd ever
Try to forget her
But these days are better
Without one another

Without one another
Without one another
Without one another
