		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Of the horizon
All I ever did was let you go
All I ever did was let you go
Was let you go
Was let you go
I see the end from the beginning
And go back around
I walk the edge of where I'm going
But won't go back
I hear unsettling things
But can't stop now
I see the end on the horizon
All I ever did was let you go
All I ever did was let you go
