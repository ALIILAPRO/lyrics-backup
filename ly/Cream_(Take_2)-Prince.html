		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is it, it's time for you to go to the wire
You will hit cause you got the burnin' desire
It's your time (time), you got the horn so why don't you blow it
You are fine (fine), you're filthy cute and, baby, you know it

Cream, get on top
Cream, you will cop
Cream, don't you stop
Cream, sh-boogie bop

You're so good
Baby, there ain't nobody better (ain't nobody better)
So you should, never ever go by the letter (never ever)
You're so cool (cool), everything you do is success
Make the rules (rules)
Then break them all cause you are the best, yes you are

Cream, get on top
Cream, you will cop
Cream, don't you stop
Cream, sh-boogie bop

Look up in the air, it's your guitar

Do your dance, why should you wait any longer?
Take your chance, it could only make you stronger
It's your time (it's your time)
You got the horn so why don't you blow it
(Go on and blow it)
You're so fine (You're so fine)
You're filthy cute and, baby, you know it (you know it)
Come on

Cream, get on top
Cream, you will cop
Cream, don't you ever stop
Cream, sh-boogie bop

Cream
Cream
Cream, sh-boogie bop

Cream
Cream (right there)
Cream (don't you stop)
Cream, sh-boogie bop
(Boogie)

Cream, sh-boogie bop
