		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you've got the money
I think it would be funny ah ah oh
To take your girl and spend a bit of your cash for me
Cos' then she might be happy
No longer lonely ah ah oh
And I could take her out the next day for pretty much free

Dah dee doo dahdah dee dah doo dah dahdah domdom dada domdom dom dadee dah doo dahdah dom

Spent late nights trying to pick up love of the floor where the other brothers leave it be
Though it's stuck hard down like chewing gum well I'll gurn on the floor singing 'RIP'
Cos the songbirds don't do singing on pavements no sweet melodies the sound of spit
And we spat orbit
Spoke o' lost hope so too what you toke man choke on it

We be near heaven at a quarter to eleven
By three we are thinking of the love we lost
by four we be high thinking of the girl lost
Second check the odds
Was it worth the cost?
Do you give a toss?

Who are you looking away wondering why you can't eat
Why you never sleep why you're drunk all the time and you're cold in the heat
Cos' what sow man its what you reap

If you've got the money money money money mon I think it would be funny ah to take your girl and send a bit of your cash for me
Cos' then she might be happy
No longer lonely ah ah oh
And I could take her out the next day for pretty much free

You always meant to walk out that job you keep stopping
Should tell your girl more often
That lovin' is all about doors unlockin'
Now you're certain nuff never mind three
With a buddy holly hiccup on the karaoke
Retreatin' on the needle man you just fourth thread
And my great granddaddy fought in Gallipoli
He's the only of his friends not shot down dead
Lovers all talk in spits and tongues
Fight in the playground bully each other
Double dare kids up pollute their lungs and threaten with the rep of their big boy brother

Some or others say give it up and run away
Momma still wants you home for supper
Work all day for little to no pay
Dance uptown right down to the gutter

Deedom domdee dahdah dah deedom domdee
So move outa the way man
domdee dahdah dah deedom deedom dee
So move outa the way man
domdee dahdah da deedom domdee domdee
Move outa the way man
domdee dahdah dah deedom domdee domdee
If they've got money
