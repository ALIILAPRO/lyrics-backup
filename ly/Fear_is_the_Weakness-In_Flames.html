		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  At least you could have tried, 
It is way past time and we're scattering ashes, 
You take everything in sight. 
Please hear me now, 
You, you are leaving me with scars. 

Fear is the weakness in all of us. 
It's sad to see you go, 
As I was meant to be easy, 
But you drag us down. 
Bury all the evidence cold

The same road for far too long 
As it meant to be, we are losing identity. 
Faith has been denied, 
Let's not pretend, 
Is this the first time, we just don't belong? 

One world, do you perceive? 
All turned cold, and no one cares for anyone. 
Waiting for the final blow, 
Do you have strength at all? 

One more day, then we fade away

Fear is the weakness in all of us. 
It's sad to see you go. 
As I meant to be easy, 
But you drag us down. 
Bury all the evidence cold

The same road for far too long
As it meant to be, we are losing identity. 
Fate has been denied, 
Let's not pretend. 
Is this the first time, we just don't belong? 

(The same road for far too long) 
As it's meant to be, we are losing identity. 
Faith has been denied, 
Let's not pretend. 
Is this the first time, we just don't, belong.
