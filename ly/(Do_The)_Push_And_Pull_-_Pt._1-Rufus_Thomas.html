		<p>
		  Hey, everybody, Mister Rufus in town
Came here to take care of business
Ain't gonna mess around
I got a brand new dance, that ain't no bull
Everybody's doing it talking 'bout push and pull

I said, push, pull, push, pull
Get on up, get on down
Get on up
Take it round and round

I said, push, pull, push, pull
Little bit more
Push it, pull it
Push it, pull it

Lookie here
Push it, pull it
Push it, pull it
Push it, pull it
Push it, pull it

Push it, pull it
Push it, pull it
Push it, pull it
Push it, pull it

Get out on the floor, you're gonna get left
Get on your own, pretty baby, now go for yourself
It's easier taking candy from a baby, don't hand me no bull
Now you got it, baby you got that push and pull

I said, push, pull
Push, pull
Listen get on up, get on down
Get on up
Take it round and round

I said, push, pull, push, pull
Listen
Push it, pull it
Push it, pull it

Double upon
Push it, pull it
Push it, pull it
Push it, pull it

Push it, pull it
Push it, pull it
Push it, pull it
Ah

Oh, Mister Clean and James Brown
Everybody been messing around
I'm doing a hundred and laying on full
I got this thing talking 'bout push and pull

I said, push, pull
Push, pull, oh, ho

Push and pull, oh, ho
