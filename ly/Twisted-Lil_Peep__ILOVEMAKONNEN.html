		  Drop it, shake it, kiss it, twist it
Drop it, shake it, kiss it, twist it
Drop it, shake it, kiss it, twist it
Drop it, shake it, kiss it, twist it
Drop it, shake it, kiss it, twist it ayy

I'm twisted, all night
I'm living my life 
Got me twisted all night
I'm living, yeah (yeah)
Got me twisted, got me twisted all night
Twisted all night
Got me twisted, got me twisted all night
Bitch, I'm living my life

I took a pill, and then a little of the white
Fuck around in the morning
Going to have to take my flight back
Home to the motherfucking south
I've been talking so much, I made a million with my mouth
Plays every day on the highway
Nigga out here get it, 'bout five ways
On Sunday to motherfucking Monday
Every Saturday it just turn to a fun day
I count it, I count it and then I spend
I fuck around then I'm going to turn around again
'Cause I picked a pack up, then dipped it back out
Ay, ay
You know

I'm twisted, all night
I'm living my life 
Got me twisted all night
I'm living, yeah (yeah)
Got me twisted, got me twisted all night
Twisted all night
Got me twisted, got me twisted all night
Bitch, I'm living my life

616, sniffing, I'm sniffing
Pure white shimmy shimmy, yay
I've been up all night
Mix it with the 'cane
Now I feel all right
Diamonds all white, brighter than the torch lights
Tats on my face, yeah I got tats on my face
Plays on my verse, I ain't been back
I ain't landed from space
I had to say grace, I had to say grace
I'm in the back of the rave with the manager, looking like Saddamn Hussein

I'm twisted, all night
I'm living my life 
Got me twisted all night
I'm living, yeah
Got me twisted, got me twisted all night
Twisted all night
Got me twisted, got me twisted all night
Bitch, I'm living my life

I'll betwisted, all night
Wrists glisten, moonlight
You got me flexin', in my ride
She got me flexin' baby girl in my ride
Cut the lights on 'em
She been licking all night, lay the pipe on 'em
We be cooking all night, roll the dice on 'em
Poppin' molly, but I had to put the rice on 'em
She said "Baby girl, I probably got some bites on 'em"

I'm twisted, all night
I'm living my life 
Got me twisted all night
I'm living, yeah (yeah)
Got me twisted, got me twisted all night
Twisted all night
Got me twisted, got me twisted all night
Bitch, I'm living my life

Drop it, shake it, kiss it, twist it
