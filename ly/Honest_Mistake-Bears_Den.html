		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A perfect picture of embarrassment
Steadying my shaking hands
Wrapped around a glass again
And look at me now

I'm choking on my medicine
Same pills by my fathers bed
Now I need them too
Come to think of it
I can't think of anyone that doesn't use

There's something in the water
Something's swimming in my drink
There is plastic in our oceans
There is plastic in my dreams
I'm a fading belle in the harshest light
Clawing at the sky
As all your stars hang over me tonight

Yeah, it was an honest mistake
To love you in such an ugly kind of way
Yeah, it was an honest mistake
To believe a single word that you'd say

I wish you'd deal your words more carefully
Can't you see that I'm down and out
And I appreciate the honesty
But my whole world is fingernails clinging to your balcony
I wish your words didn't hurt but they do
I wish I wasn't quite so frightened of the truth

There's something in the water
Something's swimming in my drink
There is plastic in our oceans
There is plastic in my dreams
I'm a fading belle in the harshest light
I'm clawing at the sky
As all your stars hang over me tonight

Yeah, it was an honest mistake
To love you in such an ugly kind of way
Yeah, it was an honest mistake
To believe a single word that you'd say

It's a crying shame
With no words left to say
We've been looking for anything to lead us back
But you can't hear my side
I can't read your mind
I'm clinging on to a memory
If that's all that we have
That's a hell of a waste
As we fall from grace
All tangled up in honest mistakes

Yeah, it was an honest mistake
To love you in such an ugly kind of way
Yeah, it was an honest mistake
To believe a single word that you'd say
Yeah, it was an honest mistake
To love you in such an ugly kind of way
