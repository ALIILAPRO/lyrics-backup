		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bite your face to spite your nose
Seventeen and a half years old
Worryin' about my brother findin' out
Where's the fun in doin' what you're told?

I said, "No"
"Oh, give it a rest, I could persuade you
I'm not your typical, stoned eighteen year old
Give me a night I'll make you"
I know you're lookin' for salvation in the secular age
But girl, I'm not your savior
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now

'Cause they're just girls breakin' hearts
And eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
They're just girls, they're just girls

A pair of frozen hands to hold
Oh, she's so southern so she feels the cold
One moment I was tearin' off your blouse, now you're livin' in my house
What happened to just messin' around?

I said, "Yo" (hey)
"I think I better go, I can't take you
You just sit and get stoned with thirty-year-olds
And you think you've made it"
"Well, shouldn't you be fuckin' with somebody your age
Instead of makin' changes?"
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now

'Cause they're just girls breakin' hearts
And eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
They're just girls, they're just girls

Told her from the start
Destined to be hard
Told her from the start, I'll break your heart
Destined to be hard, break your heart

I said, "Yo" (hey)
"I think I better go, I can't take you
I know you're lookin' for salvation in the secular age
But girl, I'm not your savior
"Well, shouldn't you be fuckin' with somebody your age
Instead of makin' changes?"
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now

'Cause they're just girls (hey) breakin' hearts (girls)
And eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
They're just girls, they're just girls
'Cause they're just girls breakin' hearts
And eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
They're just girls, they're just girls
'Cause they're just girls (girls)

(Just girls)
(Just girls)
(Girls)
Just girls
They're just girls
(Girls)
(Hey)
(Girls)
(Hey)
(Just girls)
(Just girls)
