		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yesterday?s been and gone
When we were young
Remember when we started out as friends
We were one and the same
Don't even think that I knew your name
That was then

So many things have changed
But looking back on the days
It's good to see that we are still the same

Sometimes I wish
That innocence would never end
Although memories will fade no, no
Time will never take them away

Yesterdays have been and gone
Summer days that seemed so long
All the things we did
When we were young

We had our share of smiles and tears
It's been the same
All through the years, oh yeah
Even shared our favorite songs
When we were young

Don't you know, people come and go?
But sure as sun after rain
In your heart friends will still remain

Let me say if we should drift away
And your heart feels the pain
Let the good times bring you back again

Sometimes I wish the days we had
Would never end
Although time is moving fast, so fast
Memories are made to last

Yesterdays have been and gone
Summer days that seemed so long
All the things we did
When we were young

We had our share of smiles and tears
It's been the same
All through the years, oh yeah
Even shared our favorite songs
When we were young

Even on your own
Know you'll never be alone
The memories we made
Time will never take them away

All the yesterdays have been and gone
And the summer days that seemed so long
All the things we used to do when we
When we were young

Yesterdays have been and gone
Summer days that seemed so long
All the things we did
When we were young

We had our share of smiles and tears
It's been the same
All through the years, oh yeah
Even shared our favorite songs
When we were young
