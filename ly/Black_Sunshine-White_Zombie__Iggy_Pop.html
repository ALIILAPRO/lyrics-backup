		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Gripping the wheel his knuckles went white with desire
The wheels of his Mustang exploding on the highway like a slug from a .45
True Death: 400 Horsepower of maximum performance piercing the night
This is Black Sunshine)

Yeah! Move me in the silence Baltic motorway
Hang me on the edge before I fall away
Apocalypse is dawnin' action on the mile
A 'can-do' revolution, earth to the river 
Sweet'n the ride Black Sunshine
Sweet'n the ride, yeah!
Sweet'n the ride Black Sunshine
Sweet'n the ride, yeah!
Cry a river 'cosmic', moon in Scorpio
Feel her body 'breathe', acid radio
Tell me that you like it, when I'm going down
Tell me that you like it, move to the speed of 
Sweet'n the ride Black Sunshine
Sweet'n the ride, yeah!
Sweet'n the ride Black Sunshine
Sweet'n the ride, yeah!
Go! Slide into, I said '44' cool heart can
A hypnotize dream into infinity, I turned the love to lies
Crawl across the water, wave and sink into the sea
Reflect'n onto everything, that you can never be
'Check-out!', yeah!
To the devil a daughter comes 200 worlds away, yeah
Born to lose the love you choose, destroy another day
Check out!!
Sweet'n the ride Black Sunshine
Sweet'n the ride, yeah!
Sweet'n the ride Black Sunshine
Sweet'n the ride
Stare into the T.V. kiss off the pain
Wonderland is falling, no sing, no rain momentary
Damage into the high drift me to the circuit sky

(Finally nothing moves. High noon
Black top rolling below the asphalt drive
A concrete fascination scraping the edge of nothing
This is Black Sunshine)
