		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I showed you every heathen
Every slight, every fault, you would leave me
And if I told you every reason
that I'm jaded, uneven
Baby you'd be terrified of me and all my ghosts
Terrified of my mind
It would take some time to find the answers
Cause I buried the memories in ransom
Cause you don't even know the half of this, a half of me is fractured
And you would let me go if you could see the tragedy I'm masking (I know, I know, I know)
And I don't wanna scare you away, I'm nervous
Know I got some demons you don't deserve
It would take some time to find the answers
Cross fire chaos, buildings are burning to ash
Inside my head it's war
Shots ring; waves crash
It's no place for you
If I let you in
Baby you'd be terrified of me and all my ghosts
Terrified of my mind
It would take some time to find the answers
Cause I buried the memories in ransom
Cause you don't even know the half of this, a half of me is fractured
And you would let me go if you could see the tragedy I'm masking (I know, I know, I know)
And I don't wanna scare you away, I'm nervous
Know I got some demons you don't deserve
It would take some time to find the answers
