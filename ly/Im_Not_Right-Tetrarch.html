		  Looking in the mirror and I hate myself
Looking in the mirror and I hate myself
Looking in the mirror and I hate myself
Looking in the mirror and I
I've gotta get this off my chest
I don't know what to do
I'm stuck in motion nothing's working
I'm coming unglued
Wish I could push it all away
I just wanna get away (To get away from here)
I can be strong
Other times I cry
I close my eyes
Try to clear my mind
Something's missing
I'm not right
My reflection lies to me
I've lost myself
This time I'm serious things cannot stay the same
Whenever I try to end this cycle
I lose all hope
But this is nothing new (get up)
I can't seem to catch a break with anything (quit bitching)
There's no path for me to take
(To get away from here)
I can be strong
Other times I cry
I close my eyes
Try to clear my mind
Something's missing
I'm not right
My reflection lies to me
I've lost myself
I'm not right
I'm not right
Look in the mirror and hate myself
Look in the mirror and hate myself (I'm not right)
Look in the mirror and hate myself
Look in the mirror and hate myself (I'm not right)
Look in the mirror and hate myself
Look in the mirror and hate myself (I'm not right)
Look in the mirror and hate myself
Look in the mirror and
Look in the mirror and
Hate
Hate
I'm done with everything
Hate
Hate
I'm done with everything
I close my eyes
Look in the mirror and
Hate
Hate
I'm done with everything
I close my eyes
Nothing left inside
I can be strong
Other times I cry
I close my eyes
Try to clear my mind
Something's missing
I'm not right
My reflection lies to me
I can be strong
Other times I cry (I'm not right)
I close my eyes
Try to clear my mind (I'm not right)
Something's missing
I'm not right
My reflection lies to me
I've lost myself
I've lost myself
Hate
I'm done with everything
Hate
I'm done with everything
