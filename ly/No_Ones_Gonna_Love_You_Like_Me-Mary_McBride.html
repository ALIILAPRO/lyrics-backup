		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No one's gonna love you like me
No one else, can't you see
No one's gonna love you like me
No one, no one

No one else, can't you see
No one's gonna love you like me
No one, no one

I know sometimes you felt so lonely
I know you felt so sad and blue
But this time you know I'm the only
Love for you that's coming through
With everything I say and do

No one's gonna love you like me
No one, no one
I know sometimes you felt so lonely
I know you felt so sad and blue
But this time you know I'm the only
Love for you that's coming through
With everything I say and do

No one's gonna love you like me
No one, no one
No one, no one
