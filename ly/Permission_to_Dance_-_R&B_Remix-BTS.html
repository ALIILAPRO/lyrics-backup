		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's the thought of being young
When your heart's just like a drum
Beating louder with no way to guard it
When it all seems like it's wrong
Sing along to Elton John
And to that feeling, we're just getting started

When the nights get colder
And the rhythm's got you falling behind
Just dream about that moment
When you look yourself right in the eye, eye, eye
Then you say

I wanna dance, the music's got me going
Ain't nothing that can stop how we move, yeah
Let's break our plans and live just like we're golden
And roll in like we're dancing fools
We don't need to worry
'Cause when we fall, we know how to land
Don't need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight
'Cause we don't need permission to dance

There's always something that's standing in the way
But if you don't let it faze ya, you'll know just how to break
Just keep the right vibe, yeah, 'cause there's no looking back
There ain't no one to prove we don't got this on lock, yeah

The wait is over
The time is now, so let's do it right, mm
Yeah, we'll keep going (going)
And stay up until we see the sunrise (yeah)
And we'll say

I wanna dance, the music's got me going
Ain't nothing that can stop how we move, yeah
Let's break our plans and live just like we're golden
And roll in like we're dancing fools
We don't need to worry
'Cause when we fall, we know how to land
Don't need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight
'Cause we don't need permission to dance

Da, na-na, na-na, na, na
Da, na-na, na-na, na, na
Da, na-na, na-na, na, na
No, we don't need permission to dance 
Da, na-na, na-na, na, na (hey)
Da, na-na, na-na, na, na
Da, na-na, na-na, na, na

Well, let me show ya
That we can keep the fire alive, mm
'Cause it's not over
'Til it's over, say it one more time
Say

I wanna dance, the music's got me going (music's got me going)
Ain't nothing that can stop how we move (hey), yeah
Let's break our plans and live just like we're golden (ooh)
And roll in like we're dancing fools (like we're dancing fools)
We don't need to worry
'Cause when we fall, we know how to land (we know how to land)
Don't need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight (ooh)
'Cause we don't need permission to dance
