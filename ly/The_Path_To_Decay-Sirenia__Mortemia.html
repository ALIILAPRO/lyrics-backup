		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Life brings nothing for the sane
Keep searching new days on the horizon
While time just seems to slip away
I'm leaving no trace along the way

Seems like I'm falling deeper, deeper inside myself
Feels like I'm growing weaker, much weaker each day
Along the path to decay

The lights are fading day by day
No cure for the lost, there's no ascending
When life could not become more pale
A new dawn is here, another day

Seems like I'm falling deeper, deeper inside myself
Feels like I'm growing weaker, much weaker each day
Along the path to decay

Darkness within us all
We're feeble and stand to fall
The daylight has long since gone
But a new dawn has yet to come

Seems like I'm falling deeper, deeper inside myself
Feels like I'm growing weaker, much weaker each day
Along the path to decay
