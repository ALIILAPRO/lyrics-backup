		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You make me feel so ..
alive (oh yeah)
I want you in my 
life ( yeah yeah ) 
Please let's not waste no
Time ( oh yeah )
Cause' I can't wait for you to be mine
Mine..

Yeah yeah
Oooo

With you 
Tell me what you want it'll come true
Give me all your love and I'll give you
Mine 
Come through 
Cause' you're all I need at the Rendezvous 
Give me to me and i'll give too 
Tonight.

Don't put out the fire
Don't let it die 
If you wanna take me higher 
Teach me how to fly 
Desire 
I can see it in your eyes 
Bring me back to life
Yeah.

You make me feel so ..

I want you in my 
life 
Please let's not waste no
Time 
Cause' I can't wait for you to be mi.
Mine..

Yeah yeah 

Tell me you'll never let me go 
And if you do baby let me know. 
Tell me you'll never let me go 

You make me feel so ..
alive
I want you in my 
life 
Please let's not waste no
Time 
Cause' I can't wait for you to be mi.
Mine..
