		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been on that love drunk prohibition
I'm thinking that you might
Be my new addiction
You can call it 2020 kind of view
'Cause we can quarantine, just me and you
I've been on that i've been on that
I've been on that

Been a while since I've seen my face
Smiling at the thought of a warm embrace
Looking for a friend that I can't replace
You might be the one, so I'm gonna say

I've been on that love drunk prohibition
I'm thinking that you might
Be my new addiction
You can call it 2020 kind of view
'Cause we can quarantine, just me and you

I've been on that prohibition
I've been on that
'Cause we can quarantine, just me and you
I've been on that prohibition
I've been on that prohibition
I've been on that

Find myself in another space
Counting the days till I see your face
On my own, those feelings now erased
I'll say it one more time, just in case

I've been on that love drunk prohibition
I'm thinking that you might
Be my new addiction
You can call it 2020 kind of view
'Cause we can quarantine, just me and you

I've been on that prohibition
I've been on that
'Cause we can quarantine, just me and you
I've been on that prohibition
I've been on that prohibition

I've been on that love drunk prohibition
I'm thinking that you might
Be my new addiction
You can call it 2020 kind of view
'Cause we can quarantine, just me and you
