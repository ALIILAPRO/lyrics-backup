		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got these girls tryin' to lock me down
And I always let them leave
But for the first time in a while
I wanna throw away the key
And I know you've been in a couple more relationships than me
'Cause you talk a different talk
And you kiss me differently

Now I don't know where to go
After you love me this way
After you love me so good
How are you gonna tell me you don't wanna stay?
Uh

You tell me I'm too young but
I gave you what you wanted
Baby, how do you treat me just fine
Like a boy

You won't wake up beside me
'Cause I was born in the nineties
Baby, how do you treat me just fine
Like a boy

Go and treat me like (Boy)
Go and treat me like (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

You told me you needed a perfect guy
That'll make your parents proud
'Cause you still ain't found him yet
'Cause we're still missing a round
And now you watch me put in all this work
Just to say it won't work out
You never took me seriously
Now what the hell is that about?

Now I don't know where to go
After you love me this way
After you love me so good
How are you gonna tell me you don't wanna stay?
Uh

You tell me I'm too young but
I gave you what you wanted
Baby, how do you treat me just fine
Like a boy

You won't wake up beside me
'Cause I was born in the nineties
Baby, how do you treat me just fine
Like a boy

Go and treat me like (Boy)
Go and treat me like (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Baby, don't you treat me like a boy (Boy)
Go and treat me like (Boy)
Go and treat me like (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Uh

You tell me I'm too young but
I gave you what you wanted
Baby, how do you treat me just fine
Like a boy

You won't wake up beside me
'Cause I was born in the nineties
Baby, how do you treat me just fine
Like a boy

Go and treat me like (Boy)
Go and treat me like (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Baby, don't you treat me like a boy (Boy)
Go and treat me like (Boy)
Go and treat me like (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Just fine, like a boy
Just fine, like a boy
