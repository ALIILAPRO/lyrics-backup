		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  -Part, when I couldn't see, I was cheating on, cheating on me
Apart, when I couldn't see, I was cheating on, cheating on me
-Part, when I couldn't see, I was cheating on, cheating on me

Me, I just wan make my people dey biza, biza
So I give dem my heart and my liver
If e too stress you, make you leave am, leave am
No be everybody, be believer
Anytime that I pull up, I deliver
Anytime, any arena, 'rena
I be God's own like Jesus
Before you start to criticize, consider, oh, consider, oh

-Part, when I couldn't see, I was cheating on, cheating on me
-Part, when I couldn't see, I was cheating on, cheating on me
Me, I just want see my people dem-

Getting bigger, oh, I swear down
Make embassy, no deny my people visa, oh
No be Taliban, oh, no be Al-Qaeda, oh
And they do not intend to permanently leave town
Stand with my feet down, me, I be leader, oh
So me and you, na, different caliber
Taking my niggas around the world
Every day, kilome-, kilome-, kilometre, oh
Just check I'm deep down, then you go see
Say e dey your body, no be because of me
Na psychology, oh, say psychology
Dey affect everybody, na ni

-Part, when I couldn't see, I was cheating on, cheating on me
-Part, when I couldn't see, I was cheating on, cheating on me

For the fact I had to fight for my visa
I'm swiping my Visa
Kilonshele, said Kilogram, kilometre
My woman got incredible features
Me and Oluwa Burna, we fly to Ibiza
Make you no deny me my Visa
Bring a likkle girl, a likkle reefer
It's cheaper to keep her
She don't wanna stay, haffi leave her
No be everybody, be believer
Hennessy, Casamigos, it's all in the car
I'm Asamoah Gyan, the way I hit the bar
Fine boy, no pimple, no tats
I got a V12 under the bonnet, she got plaques
I'm Mario, my princess got a peach
And my Rolls-Royce seats are in peach
And the villa must have come with a beach
One for the street
Four, five, this toast doesn't come with a speech, you know?

-Part, when I couldn't see, I was cheating on, cheating on me
-Part, when I couldn't see, I was cheating on, cheating on me

Me, I just wan make my people dey biza, biza
So I give dem my heart and my liver
If e too stress you, make you leave am, leave am
No be everybody, be believer
Anytime that I pull up, I deliver
Anytime, any arena, 'rena
I be God's own like Jesus
Before you start to criticize, consider, oh, consider, oh

If I ever said I loved you
Then I'll always be by your side
If you call on me, then I'll slide
You already know we outside
And I know you gon' ride
Anytime I call on you
If I ever said I loved you
(-Part, when I couldn't see, I was cheating on, cheating on me)
(-Part, when I couldn't see, I was cheating on, cheating on me)

Apart, when I couldn't see, I was cheating on, cheating on me
-Part, when I couldn't see, I was cheating on, cheating on me
Me, I just want see my people dem-

Getting bigger, oh, I swear down
Make embassy, no deny my people visa, oh
They do not intend to permanently leave town
Me, I be leader, oh

Apart, when I couldn't see, I was cheating on, cheating on me
-Part, when I couldn't see, I was cheating on, cheating on me
