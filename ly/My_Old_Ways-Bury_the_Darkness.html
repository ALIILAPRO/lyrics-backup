		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm breaking down
I need some help (yeah)
Standing here alone
Fractured heart in my hands
I'm done with trust
I'm done with love
I need to take some time
to get control of my mind
The more I care
The more I push away
Can't help but think
I'm not enough for you to stay
Fear of betrayal
Is driving me insane
It's just a side effect
Of being stuck in my old ways
Reminisce on the memories
Coming to terms with my disease
Diving down, deeper and deeper
Messages getting clearer and clearer
Played the victim all my life
Never tried to make things right
Not how it's supposed to be
Blind to the things that were wrong with me
The more I care
The more I push away
Can't help but think
I'm not enough for you to stay
Fear of betrayal
Is driving me insane
It's just a side effect
Of being stuck in my old ways
You were my salvation
Now you're my demise
I wear this pain like a crown of thorns
Set me up to crucify
Where can I call home?
The more I care
The more I push away
Can't help but think
I'm not enough for you to stay
Fear of betrayal
Is driving me insane
It's just a side effect
Of being stuck in my old ways
