		  (Mello made it right)
(Great John on the beat by the way)

You know I gotta stay with a stick
Get Back Gang in my city is sick
Say she love me, she poppin' her tit
And I drop an opp, I ain't droppin' a diss
I know niggas hate when I'm talkin' my shit
Niggas hate me, I'm somethin' like Chris
You ain't tryna spin, better get out the whip, uh
Better get out the, fuck that

Shit got lit, I was takin' that trip
Slide through me and Billy on some shit
Free Fresh, that's really the rib
Free Toe Tag, free Benji and Micc
He ain't with it, we do 'em like Rick
And shorty, she on me, she tryna get hit
Yeah, I'm Gucci, she Prada my drip
She said she adore my Dior kicks
Fuck a Uber, you gotta get Lyft
In the air, that's a opp in the spliff
Never care 'bout no popular shit
They might pick up the heat when I'm droppin' this shit
I'm a winner, you know I don't quit
They can't stand me, they know that they sick
Drive 'em crazy, don't got a permit
Bitch, I'm outta my body, I'm ready to glitch

You know I gotta stay with a stick
Get Back Gang in my city is sick
Say she love me, she poppin' her tit
And I drop an opp, I ain't droppin' a diss
I know niggas hate when I'm talkin' my shit
Niggas hate me, I'm somethin' like Chris
You ain't tryna spin, better get out the whip, uh
Better get out the, fuck that

Still ten toes with my foot in the mud
Said I'm ugly now she wanna fuck
I stay with protection, my gun in my glove
Ain't no cappin', he really a thug
They been tryna be me since I got a buzz
They gon' hate that I'm gettin' the love
And baby, I'm sick like I'm catchin' a bug
Run up on me, he catchin' a slug
Gotta keep me a strap in this club
You know if he lack then we packin' 'em up
Took his strap, he ain't clap it enough
Ain't no cap in my rap, he a pack if he sus'
Shoot first, we ain't askin' 'em much
They like, "We gettin' active or what?"
New whip, I be switchin' shit up
And they know they can look
But they know not to touch

You know I gotta stay with a stick
Get Back Gang in my city is sick
Say she love me, she poppin' her tit
And I drop an opp, I ain't dropping a diss
I know niggas hate when I'm talkin' my shit
Niggas hate me, I'm somethin' like Chris
You ain't tryna spin, better get out the whip, uh
Better get out the, fuck that
