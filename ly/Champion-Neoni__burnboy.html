		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The battle’s coming now
The fury shakes the ground
I’ve come to take my crown
I’m rising up my heart is pounding
Ready or not the clock is counting down
This is my moment
This is my moment
This is my moment
Whoa
I was born for greatness
Whoa
A legend in the making
Deep in my bones
Oh yeah I know
I am
I am the champion
Whoa
Come on try and take it
Whoa
It all comes down to this and
Deep in my bones
Oh yeah I know
I am
I am the champion
You know I’m out for blood
I’m feeling dangerous
I just can’t get enough
I’m rising up my heart is pounding
Ready or not the clock is counting down
This is my moment
This is my moment
This is my moment yeah
Whoa
I was born for greatness
Whoa
A legend in the making
Deep in my bones
Oh yeah I know
I am
I am the champion
Whoa
Come on try to take it
Whoa
It all comes down to this and
Deep in my bones
Oh yeah I know
I am
I am the champion
I am the
I am the
I am
I am the champion
I know where I’m going
I have been chosen
I’ll never be broken
I am the champion
A clashing of titans
A battle of giants
Take a moment of silence
I am the champion
Whoa
I was born for greatness
Whoa
A legend in the making
Deep in my bones
Oh yeah I know
I am
I am the champion
Whoa
Come on try to take it
Whoa
It all comes down to this and
Deep in my bones
Oh yeah I know
I am
I am the champion
I am the
I am the
I am
I am the champion
