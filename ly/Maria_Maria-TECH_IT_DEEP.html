		<p>
		  Maria, Maria
She reminds me of a West Side Story
Growing up in Spanish Harlem
She living the life just like a movie star
Oh, Maria, Maria
She fell in love in East L.A.
To the sounds of the guitar, yeah, yeah
Played by Carlos Santana

Maria, Maria
She reminds me of a West Side Story
Growing up in Spanish Harlem
She living the life just like a movie star
Maria, Maria

Stop the looting, stop the shooting
Pick pocking on the corner
See as the rich is getting richer
The poorer is getting poorer
Se mira Maria on the corner
Thinking of ways to make it better
In my mailbox there's an eviction letter
Signed by the judge, said, "See you later"

Stop the looting, stop the shooting

Se mira Maria on the corner
Thinking of ways to make it better

Signed by the judge, said, "See you later"

Ahora vengo mama chula, mama chula
Ahora vengo mama chula (East coast)
Ahora vengo mama chula, mama chula
Ahora vengo mama chula

Maria, Maria
She reminds me of a West Side Story
Growing up in Spanish Harlem
She living the life just like a movie star
Oh, Maria, Maria
