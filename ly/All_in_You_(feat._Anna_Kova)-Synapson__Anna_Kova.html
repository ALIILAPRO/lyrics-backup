		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I talk for a reason
Sing for a reason
Some may say I lost my mind
Trust for a reason
Fight for a reason
Look around, there ain't much time
To say what you want to say
Do what you want to do
Live your life all the way, eh

Oh my God, got to run the day
But we can't judge and play the game
No way, open up your eyes
And see that all is new to me
Oh my God, got to run the day
But we can't judge and play the game
No way, open up your eyes
And see that all is to be me

Ooh, it looks so afraid
Stop looking away
It's all in you
You, you, it's all in you
Baby, it's all in you
You, you, it's all in you

I walk all the season
Change all my vision
An open mind, an open heart
Try with them visions
Them but my intuitions
Never feel me, never hurt
Just feel how you wanna feel
The deeper the real
Die to spend that wheel, ill

Oh my God, got to run the day
But we can't judge and play the game
No way, open up your eyes
And see that all is new to me
Oh my God, got to run the day
But we can't judge and play the game
No way, open up your eyes
And see that all is to be me

Ooh, it looks so afraid
Stop looking away
It's all in you
You, you, it's all in you
Baby, it's all in you
You, you, it's all in you

Oh my God, got to run the
Oh my God, oh my God
Oh my God, oh my God, eh, eh

Oh my God, got to run the table
Oh my God, got to run the table quick
Can't judge and play the game, no, no, no

Oh my God, got to run the table quick
Can't judge and play the game
No way, open up your eyes and see, eh

Oh my God, got to run the table quick
Can't judge and play the game
No way, open up your eyes and see
That all is to be me

All is to be me, oh
All is to be me
All is to be me
All is to be me

Don't look so afraid (so afraid)
Stop looking away
It's all in you
You, you, it's all in you
Baby, it's all in you
You, you, you, you, you, you
Baby, baby, baby
