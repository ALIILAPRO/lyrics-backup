		  Earl on the beat
(30, you a fool for this one)

She say she wanna be my main bitch, ayy
She say she ready to be famous, yah
She say she wanna be my wife, yah
She say think ready for this life, yeah yeah
You really think you ready for this life? (woah)
I just wanna know if you gon' ride (woah)
I just wanna know if you gon' ride for me
Paparazzi taking pics, you on the side of me

Quick camouflage, brand new, in this black Benz truck, ridin' fast
Don't you dare ever look back
I can change your life
Gotta make sure that you right for me
Make your wildest dreams everyday reality
Oh everyday sex for dinner
Having good sex in the Sprinter
Your last man was a renter
Well girl, I'm a buyer
Pirelli all on my tires
I'll tell your boss you quit if you not already fired
I love gettin' wires
Count 'em up, count 'em up, count
All these Ms in my account
Lift up the truck with a mount
Hitting home runs like Jeter
'Bout to go cop me a brand new two seater, I been knew that you was a eater
That's why I fuck with you
I feel like I'm stuck with you
I need you to come on through
Just pass the stash or two

She say she wanna be my main bitch, ayy
She say she ready to be famous, yah
She say she wanna be my wife, yah
She say think ready for this life, yeah yeah
You really think you ready for this life? Woah (woah)
I just wanna know if you gon' ride, woah (ah)
I just wanna know if you gon' ride for me
Paparazzi taking pics, you on the side of me

All these camera lights
Shawty, welcome to the life
All these diamonds, all this ice
Shawty, I could treat you right (yah)
You could be my main
Introduce you to the fame
Fetch you on a private plane
Shawty, just don't ever change
And we can go straight to the top
We can be counting this guap
And we can be taking trips to different cities
And speed you all in a drop
I just copped that new McLaren
Oh, that's that new Gucci you wearin' (Gucci)
Just copped some new titties and matching new ass as well, these niggas they staring
And they mad 'cause you rollin' with me
You keep that pussy soaking for me
And I only care what they got to say
'Cause you out in the open with me
When I usually keep it low-key
Girl, you're making it hard for me
Girl, you look like a star with me

She say she wanna be my main bitch, ayy
She say she ready to be famous, yah
She say she wanna be my wife (be my wife)
She say think ready for this life, yeah yeah
You really think you ready for this life? (woah)
I just wanna know if you gon' ride (woah)
I just wanna know if you gon' ride for me
Paparazzi taking pics, you on the side of me
