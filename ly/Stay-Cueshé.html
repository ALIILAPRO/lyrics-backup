		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I believe
We shouldn't let the moment pass us by
Life's too short
We shouldn't wait for the water to run dry

Think about it
Cause we only have one shot at destiny
All I'm asking
Could it possibly be you & me?

So if you'd still go, I'll understand
Would you give me something just to hold on to?
And if you'll stay, I'll hold your hand
Cause I'm truly, madly, crazily in love with you

Time has come
For us to go, our separate ways
God forbid
But my mind is going crazy today

I feel so cold
Feel so numb I'm having nightmares but I'm awake
Help me Lord
Fight this loneliness
Take this pain away

Now that you're gone, I'm all alone
I'm still hoping that you would come back home
Don't care how long, but I'm willing to wait
Cause I'm truly, madly, crazily in love with you
