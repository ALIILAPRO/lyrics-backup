		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, he treats me with respect
He says he loves me all the time
He calls me fifteen times a day
He likes to make sure that I'm fine
You know I've never met a man
Who's made me feel quite so secure
He's not like all them other boys
They're all so dumb and immature

There's just one thing
That's getting in the way
When we go up to bed
You're just no good, it's such a shame
I look into your eyes
I want to get to know you
And then you make this noise
And it's apparent it's all over

It's not fair
And I think you're really mean
I think you're really mean
I think you're really mean
Oh, you're supposed to care
But you never make me scream
You never make me scream

Oh, it's not fair
And it's really not okay
It's really not okay
It's really not okay
Oh, you're supposed to care
But all you do is take
Yeah, all you do is take

Oh, I lie here in the wet patch
In the middle of the bed
I'm feeling pretty damn hard done by
I spent ages giving head
Then I remember all the nice things
That you've ever said to me
Maybe I'm just overreacting
Maybe you're the one for me

There's just one thing
That's getting in the way
When we go up to bed
You're just no good, it's such a shame
I look into your eyes
I want to get to know you
And then you make this noise
And it's apparent it's all over

It's not fair
And I think you're really mean
I think you're really mean
I think you're really mean
Oh, you're supposed to care
But you never make me scream
You never make me scream

Oh it's not fair
And it's really not okay
It's really not okay
It's really not okay
Oh, you're supposed to care
But all you do is take
Yeah, all you do is take

There's just one thing
That's getting in the way
When we go up to bed
You're just no good, it's such a shame
I look into your eyes
I want to get to know you
And then you make this noise
And it's apparent it's all over

It's not fair
And I think you're really mean
I think you're really mean
I think you're really mean
Oh, you're supposed to care
But you never make me scream
You never make me scream
Oh, it's not fair
And it's really not okay
It's really not okay
It's really not okay
Oh, you're supposed to care
But all you do is take
Yeah, all you do is take
