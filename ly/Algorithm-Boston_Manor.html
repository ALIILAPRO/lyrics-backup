		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby blue they paid you to take my youth & use it up.
They don’t want a dilettante from up north in their club.
But the truth is I was always useless, made excuses (I still do).
If the dream is fading, you can always change it.

I was by the wayside, never seeing daylight.
Do whatever they like, just tell me what you people want.
Tryna live a new life, do whatever you like.
Wearing somebody else’s clothes.

Cause the summer, it ain’t gonna last forever.
You gotta wake up.
But the truth is I was always useless, made excuses (I still do)
If the dream is fading, you can always change it.

I was by the wayside, never seeing daylight.
Do whatever they like, just tell me what you people want.
Tryna live a new life, do whatever you like.
Wearing somebody else’s clothes.

Someone else’s clothes, oh feet don’t fail me now.
I wish I could let go.

I was by the wayside, never seeing daylight.
Do whatever they like, just tell me what you people want.
Tryna live a new life, do whatever you like.
Wearing somebody else’s clothes.
