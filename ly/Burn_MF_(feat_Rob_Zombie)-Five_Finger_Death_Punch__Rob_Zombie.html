		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My heart is frozen
My soul's been broken
The whole world's on my motherfucking shoulders
And I can't seem to control it

I can't contain it
And I just don't give a shit
You need to feel the way that I feel
Or you'll never fucking know it

Burn mother fucker, burn mother fucker, burn
You tried but you can't reach me
Burn mother fucker, burn mother fucker, burn
There's nothing you can teach me
In hell mother fucker, burn mother fucker, burn
I swear you're out to get me
Burn mother fucker, burn mother fucker, burn
I'd live but you won't let me
Burn!

You're life's been wasted
You'll die forsaken
You act like the world's on your shoulders
But it's not there so you fake it

Do you embrace it?
How do you take it?
I'll never feel the way that you feel
I'd rather fucking break it

Burn mother fucker, burn mother fucker, burn
You try but you can't reach me
Burn mother fucker, burn mother fucker, burn
There's nothing you can teach me

In hell mother fucker, burn mother fucker, burn
I swear you're out to get me
Burn mother fucker, burn mother fucker, burn
I'd live but you won't let me

Burn mother fucker, burn mother fucker, burn
Burn mother fucker, burn mother fucker, burn
Burn mother fucker, burn mother fucker, burn
Burn mother fucker

Burn

Burn

Burn!

Burn mother fucker, burn mother fucker, burn
Burn mother fucker, burn mother fucker, burn
Burn mother fucker, burn mother fucker, burn
Burn mother fucker,
Burn mother fucker, burn mother fucker, burn
You try but you can't reach me
Burn mother fucker, burn mother fucker, burn
There's nothing you can teach me
In hell mother fucker, burn mother fucker, burn
I swear you're out to get me
Burn mother fucker, burn mother fucker, burn
I'd live but you won't let me
Burn! Burn!
