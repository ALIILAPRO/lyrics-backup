		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win (J.R.), to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

Uh, yo, yo
I wish today it will rain all day
Maybe that'd kinda make the pain go away
Tryna forgive you for abandoning me
Prayin', but I think I'm still an angel away
Angel away, yeah, strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got they guns out aiming at me
But I become Neo when they aiming at me
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
They start coming and I start rising
Must be surprising, I'm just surmising
I win, thrive, soar, higher
Higher, higher, more fire

I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

Uh, yo, yo
Everybody wanna try to box me in
Suffocatin' every time it locks me in
Paintin' they own pictures, then they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that can ever be defined
I am not fly, I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near
See we become alive in a time of fear
And I ain't got no motherfuckin' time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard, your nays become yays
Yankee Stadium with Jay's and Kanye's

I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
I came to win
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it

I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly
