		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Christo, yeah
I was just trying to get me some money the other day
I been so down on my luck, I'm humble in every way
I stumbled on every step, mumbled with every breath
Do not repeat myself, I will not re
Okay, good night to the cool kid, say hi to the bad guy
Eastside mad scientist, we ride, niggas dying
Women throw pussy at me, I never seen cats flying
But never say never, never say never, we say whatever

I done came up, I done came up (came up)
Put your chains up, and your rings up (rings up)
Fuck the other side (Fuck 'em), we don't change up (nah)
All the homies ride, they can't change us
I done came up, I done came up (I done came up)
Switching lanes up, and I'm prayed up
Fuck the other side, we don't change up (yeah)
All the homies ride, you can't change us

We hit the pack with the weed in the sack
And the back in the black, J.I.D with the gat
G's with the jeans on the straps on the scene with the lean
Get the cream how you been, where you at?
Seen what I seen on the scene with the beam on a rat
Don't move, there's a thing on your head
Put a hole in that ball ting on your hat
You a rat, that's a cool thing to a cat
Knock it out the park as I bing from the back
But we get the ring, then I be the king sitting satin
Persian rugs so fly, no Aladdin
Serving drugs, I got the pen and a pad
Serving drugs, I give her dick when she mad
But she know that I rap
I ain't got time for the Madden
She know that I'm capping
Finna snap on these rap niggas
And they react, you get the rat from the ratchet

I done came up, I done came up (came up)
Put your chains up, and your rings up (rings up)
Fuck the other side (Fuck 'em), we don't change up (nah)
All the homies ride, they can't change us
I done came up, I done came up (I done came up)
Switching lanes up, and I'm prayed up
Fuck the other side, we don't change up (yeah)
All the homies ride, you can't change us

Picture a nigga stepping into the game that's already lit
Just add a little coal to flame it
Lame niggas, I gotta put it in layman's terms?
I'm finna murder you niggas
You better spread the word
I bled words 'till my head would hurt
The first to say, it hurts to say, I said it first
Live life like a baby that was dead at birth
But came alive and fucked the nurses
If you don't like it tell a nigga jump if you feeling Kermit
If you sleeping on me we can make it permanent
And leave 'em stinking, he a really permeate, he really reeking
J.I.D or call me Willie Beamon
But I'm 'bout the team, everybody eating
If it's down to me
I'ma do some shit niggas ain't never seen
Bitch, I dunk the three
Ashton Kutcher, who's punking me?
J.I.D the butcher, who want the beef?
Chop arm, leg, head, package meat
Sacrificial lamb, satisfactory
Smack him with the hand, don't talk back to me
I'ma be the man, I'ma kill a king
I done been a fan, now I need wings
I done seen your hand, now I need wings

Okay I'm fired up, I'm really fired up
I'm feeling wide open, losing my mind bro
Gimme the time bro, 'cause I'm a time bomb
Coming from mine bro, see what you lying for
Taking a time up, I'm feeling fired up
I'm really fired up, wait
Okay I'm fired up, I'm really fired up
I'm feeling wide open, losing my mind bro
Gimme the time bro, 'cause I'm a time bomb
Coming from mine bro, see what you lying for
Taking a time up, I'm feeling fired up
I'm really fired up, wait
Fired up

You got two niggas sitting down to eat, right
Niggas sitting down at the table to eat
And they got the same food, and they got the same utensils
You dig what I'm saying?
One nigga let his food go cold watching another nigga eat
You know what I'm saying
And that's how all this shit be starting, envy
Another nigga looking at another nigga
Wanting what another nigga got when he got utensils
And a share of his own, you dig what I'm saying?
All this started, when a nigga get in power and a nigga shitting on a nigga
That where all this shit be stemming from
