		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Start press any key.
how do we recover how do we recover?
we're lost in our machines.
obsessed by the others. Possessed by the others.

two nine oh treble oh two nine oh.
control alt delete control alt delete.

Higher and it feels like and it feels like, Madness.
Fear no fall we're all in time and it feels like madness.

Move at hyperspeed 
complete the next level. complete the next level.
Robot hearts don't bleed. They're living forever, we're living forever. 

two nine oh treble oh two nine oh.
control alt delete control alt delete
Higher and it feels like and it feels like, Madness
Fear no fall we're all in time and it feels like, madness.
