		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A cloud hangs over this city by the sea
I watch the ships pass and wonder if she might be
Out there and sober as a well for loneliness
Please do persist girl, it's time we met and made a mess

I picture your face in the back of my eyes
A fire in the attic, a proof of the prize
Anna Molly, Anna Molly, Anna Molly

A cloud hangs over and mutes my happiness
A thousand ships couldn't sail me back from distress
Wish you were here, I'm a wounded satellite
I need you now, put me back together, make me right

I picture your face in the back of my eyes
A fire in the attic, a proof of the prize
Anna Molly, Anna Molly, Anna Molly
I'll call out your name up into the air
Not one of the others could ever compare
Anna Molly, Anna Molly

Wait, there is a light
There is a fire
Illuminated attic
Fate or something better
I could care less
Just stay with me a while
Wait, there is a light
There is a fire 
De-fragmenting the attic
Fate or something better
I could care less
Just stay with me a while

I picture your face in the back of my eyes
A fire in the attic, a proof of the prize
Anna Molly, Anna Molly, Anna Molly
I'll call out your name up into the air
Not one of the others Could ever compare
Anna Molly, Anna Molly
(Wait, there is a light)
Anna Molly (there is a fire de-fragmenting the attic)
(Fate or something better)
Anna Molly (I could care less, just stay with me a while)
