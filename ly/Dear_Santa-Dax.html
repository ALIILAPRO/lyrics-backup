		  Ayeee Santa, Dax again
I hope you're not gonna ignore
My calls again this year
I'm sorry about what happened last year
I'm just really
Really passionate about Christmas and
And you were being a Grinch and you know it
Okay? So listen

Aye Santa last year you did a good job but
This year we need to pick this shit up
Last year I said a Cadillac color matte black
But this year I think I
Really want a Bentley truck
I don't want to hear excuses
Last year you played me
For a fool this year get yo fat ass up
I don't mean to be a nuisance
Santa but after last year
I don't give a fuck

I need two phones like I'm Kevin Gates
I'm tryna get boo'd up like I'm Ella Mai
Last year I got a Lele Pons follow back
But this year I'm tryna take Lele
On a god damn date
I want two homes, with two gnomes
In two states
Two thrones, gray poupon on two steaks
A crib with a gate
And some fish in a pond with a
Hot tub beside of a lake i need tube socks
A feature from 2Pac
A new season of Boondocks
Some more ice 'cause I'm too hot
And this year throw in a flesh
Light and a juke box i need closure
I need more exposure
A new diet preferably kosher
Get me a virgin who's never even kissed
A man so I can show her a Billboard hit
Balmain fit iced out watch
Exclusive kicks
And some who's only job is to wipe
My ass every time I shit santa
I know you see me
Don't try to play me just like you Stevie
And have me wondering and looking so needy
I'm not that greedy just let me get a
Couple more things and 60 inch TV
A personal chef to help me cook
And someone to read for me when
I open up a book and let me get some booty
Like Captain Hook

Dear Dax, uhhh it's not
Looking good this year, son
Ms clause is sick rudolph is in the hospital
The Popeyes chicken sandwich ran out
I'm black
Uhh let me connect you with a friend

Again Santa, two in years in row?
Now I know what you mean
When you always say ho
I'ma huff puff come and blow down yo door
Treat you just like a grudge
I ain't letting you
I'ma show you the meaning of pole (Do do do)
And put yo head right in a scope
Put a Red dot 'pon ya head top
Have you looking like a real red nose

'Twas the night before Christmas
And all through the house
Not a creature was stirring not even a mouse
It was Dax and the Grinch
Because Santa's bitch
So we gon' break this shit down
And we gon' do it like this
