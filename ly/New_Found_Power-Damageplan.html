		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why have we waited so long 
Suppressing the power inside 
Tear away all that was wrong 
Something too massive to hide 

It's time to rip the chain from your neck 
Let go the past as you purge 
Free now from everything weighing you down 
Open the floodgates and surge with 
New found power 

Cleansing yourself of the past 
Learn from mistakes and move on 
Conquering new ground at last 
Unite and become twice as strong 

It's time to rip the chain from your neck 
Let go the past as you purge 
Free now from everything weighing you down 
Open the floodgates and surge with 
New found power 

Nothing ventured, nothing gained 
Hope was all that kept me sane 
Rise above and prove myself 
I'll survive without your help 
Shut you out, my strength comes from within 

New found power
