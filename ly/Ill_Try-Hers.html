		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was stressin', head screwed on too tight
Read your words that felt so close despite
You always wrote a letter inscribed ever so slight
Just be yourself and I'll be fine

I'll try for you, for you
I'll try for you, for you

I read the thoughts that you didn't want to write
Yes, I'm at ease but it ain't gone overnight
See, my head's had one dream too many
But still, you're there inside
Just be yourself and I'll be fine

I'll try for you, for you
I'll try for you, for you
I'll try for you, for you
I'll try for you, for you

Mesdames messieurs, nous allons bientôt nous quitter, mais
S'il vous reste quelque chose de ceci, gardez (à) l'esprit que la persévérance (est) essentielle
Merci beaucoup, et à bientôt

I'll try for you, for you
I'll try for you, for you
I'll try for you, for you
I'll try for you, for you
