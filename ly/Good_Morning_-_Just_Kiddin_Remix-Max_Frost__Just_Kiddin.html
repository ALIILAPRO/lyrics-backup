		  Hello, good morning, how ya doing?
Waking up shaking yesterday's booze, yeah
Turn the TV off 'cause bad news, man
Feeling fresh like a Ziploc new, man
OJ with a champagne tune up
Mimosa holy ghost running through ya
Hell yeah, it's a new hallelujah
Popping like the top off a bottle and I ain't stopping, yeah

Baby it's a brand new day
Ain't no clouds hanging over me
Something doesn't feel the same
The rest of my life gonna start today
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
The rest of my life gon' start today

Calling out the ocean, this is evolution, can I
Grow into another animal? A next level
I'm spreading wings and I just wanna sing (ooh whoo, ooh)
In the future, now the past can't harm me
Forget about yesterday, Paul McCartney
I'm feeling like a Beatle on stage
And the whole wide world's gonna know my name

Baby it's a brand new day
Ain't no clouds hanging over me
Something doesn't feel the same
The rest of my life gonna start today
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
The rest of my life gon' start today

Ladies and gentlemen
This part right here is very simple
It goes like this

I've been up, I've been down
But I got the feeling right now
I've been up, I've been down
But I got the feeling right now
I've been up, I've been down
Do you got the feeling right now?

Baby it's a brand new day
Ain't no clouds hanging over me
Something doesn't feel the same
The rest of my life gonna start today
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
The rest of my life gon' start today

Good morning
Good morning
The rest of my life gon' start today
