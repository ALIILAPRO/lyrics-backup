Ayo
Told him shoot his shot like his main opp
Now I'm fallin' for him like a raindrop
D-D-D-D-Done that, run that
Yo, Patty, give me the gun back
When he say cock it back, gun off safety
Thinkin' 'bout you lately, JoJo and K-Ci
I be on that calm flex, dem gyal hasty
Gyal dem want me fazed, but dem gyal dem can't face me
I-I ain't really tryna let him in, in
But if he's a G, it's a win, win
Can't play the queen before the king, king
Bitch, I'm the Pinkprint, tell him to kiss the pink rink

Fallin' for you
I think I'm fallin' for you
Fallin' for you
I think I'm fallin' for you
Fallin' for you
I think I'm, I think I'm 
I think I'm fallin' for you

They like 'em, they fightin'
They comin', they tuggin'
I kill 'em, I beat 'em
I see them, they duckin'
Got pitbulls
We feed 'em, it's nothin'
They never been official
They never been the issue
Plus they know that my body T, my middle initial
I let him kiss the real
He know my looks could kill
These bitches gotta shake they ass to show sex appeal

Fallin' for you
I think I'm fallin' for you
Fallin' for you
I think I'm fallin' for you
Fallin' for you

Picture that, picture me givin' bitches slack
Picture pretendin' I give all these bitches piggyback
Picture usin' me and the bars and never givin' back
Soon as they think they see the light, I turn the picture black
Ain't at the mall but between me and them, it's a gap
Pictures sayin' that you the queen and knowin' it's a fact
Picture my head givin' wet and wavy, strawberry daq'
Yo, matter of fact, let me take that back before they steal that
Picture me openin' the vault, bitch, I seal that
Picture them disses stickin' like ribs, bitches feel that
Picture me tellin' bitches catch it, oughta feel that
Picture me not tellin' my lil' niggas drill that
Picture you endin' up under the sea where the dread at
Picture not listenin' when I said that you would dread that
I mean locked, ho, you-you's a chop ho
I'm number one, y'all go argue over top four
Clean, sweet, you ogettin' mopped, ho
Picture me dressed in black, they callin' me Miss Mary Mack
You get the picture, my niggas airin' that
Li-Like Married To The Mob, bitch, I'm married to the MAC
Picture it not gettin' scary, it's airy, where the MACs?

Fallin' for you
I think I'm fallin' for you
Fallin' for you
I think I'm fallin' for you
Fallin' for you
I think I'm, I think I'm 
I'm think I'm fallin' for you

Ayo 
You gotta catch me while I care 
I ain't callin' for you
Watchin' my every move 
You thought I was fallin' for you?
