		  Oh my, oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my

It ain't my fault you keep turning me on
It ain't my fault you got, got me so gone
It ain't my fault I'm not leavin' alone
It ain't my fault you keep turning me on

I can't talk right now
I'm looking and I like what I'm seeing
Got me feeling kinda shocked right now
Couldn't stop right now, even if I wanted
Gotta get it, get it, get it, while it's hot right now
Oh my God, what is this?
Want you all in my business
Baby, I insist
Please don't blame me for what ever happens next

No I-I-I-I, can't be responsible
If I-I-I-I, get you in trouble now
See you're-'re-'re-'re, too irresistible
Yeah, that's for sure
So if I put your hands where my eyes can't see
Then you're the one who's got a hold on me
No I-I-I-I, can't be responsible, responsible

It ain't my fault (no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
It ain't my fault (no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
It ain't my fault

It ain't my fault you came in looking like that
You just made me trip, fall, and land on your lap
Certain bad boy smooth, body hotter than a sauna
I don't mean to be rude, but I look so damn good on ya
Ain't got time right now
Missed me with that "what's your name, your sign" right now
It's light outside, I just called an Uber and it's right outside
Oh my God, what is this?
Want you all in my business
Baby I insist
Please don't blame me for what ever happens next

No I-I-I-I, can't be responsible
If I-I-I-I, get you in trouble now
See you're-'re-'re-'re, too irresistible
Yeah, that's for sure
So if I put your hands where my eyes can't see
Then you're the one who's got a hold on me
No I-I-I-I, can't be responsible, responsible

It ain't my fault (no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
It ain't my fault (no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
It ain't my fault

Baby, one, two, three
Your body's calling me
And I know wherever you're at
Is exactly where I wanna be
But don't blame me
It ain't my fault (no, no, no, no)
It ain't my fault (no, no, no, no)
It ain't my fault (no, no, no, no)
It ain't my fault (oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my)

So if I put your hands where my eyes can't see
Then you're the one who's got a hold on me
No I-I-I-I, can't be responsible, responsible

It ain't my fault (no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
It ain't my fault (no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
It ain't my fault

It ain't my fault you got me so caught (it ain't my fault)
It ain't my fault you got me so caught (it ain't my fault)
Oh, well that's too bad it ain't my fault!
