		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feel it, the suffering
The aching and body burns
If we hold on
Learn to forgive, to forget
If we stay strong, no regrets

Hands lifted high for the healing
A feeling of warmth and new life (life)
The world that we know may be bleeding
But we still have time

We've waited
Silent for too long
Hesitated
When it was time to run
We've been drifting
Miles and miles away
From the good things
And better days

Hands lifted high for the healing (for the healing)
A feeling of warmth and new life (life)
The world that we know may be bleeding (may be bleeding)
But we still have time

If we all come together
Before it all goes down
Hear our voices through the weather
In the cities, fields and towns
If we all stand together
Before it all breaks down

Feeling that we're sinking
Now the tide has turned
We fight against the riptide
As the ocean turns
Fires light the forests
Now Hollywood burns
Treading on the ashes
The grim reaper roams

Roams

When will we wake up? (When will we wake up?)
Broken promises, promises
It's time for a shake up
Wake up sooner or later (sooner or later)
We'll realize the consequences
When will we wake up

Leaving
Marching on and on
Good feelings
For everyone

Hands lifted high for the healing (for the healing)
A feeling of warmth and new life (life)
The world that we know may be bleeding (may be bleeding)
But we still have
We still have time

If we all come together
Before it all goes down
Hear our voices through the weather
In the cities, fields and towns
If we all stand together
Before it all breaks down
Down, down
