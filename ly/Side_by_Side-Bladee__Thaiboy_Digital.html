		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Me and my baby going side by side, side, side by side, side
Side by side
Girl, you know that I be loving you in my afterlife
Af-afterlife
Baby, let me bring the sky to you, bring the night to you
Let your eyes shine through
If I'm going out this life, you know that I'm gonna love you
Gonna-gonna love you

I wanted good times for a long time but you press rewind
But you press rewind
You're in my mind, I want to resign
I want to resign
I don't know what's right, and I can't decide
Better trust my eyes
I shine the night, lit up like a light
Hit you like light
Can't slip, I walk on ice, I keep my knife
By my side
Baby, whatever the situation is, I'll be there
I'll be by your side

Me and my baby going side by side, side, side by side, side
Side by side
Girl, you know that I be loving you in my afterlife
Af-afterlife
Baby, let me bring the sky to you, bring the night to you
Let your eyes shine through
If I'm going out this life, you know that I'm gonna love you
Gonna-gonna love you

Me and my baby going side by side, side, side by side, side
Side by side
Girl, you know that I be loving you in my afterlife
Af-afterlife
Baby, let me bring the sky to you, bring the night to you
Let your eyes shine through
If I'm going out this life, you know that I'm gonna love you
Gonna-gonna love you

Baby, let me bring the sky to you, bring the night to you
Let your eyes shine through
