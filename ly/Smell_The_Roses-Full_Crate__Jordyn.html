		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (This is take one)

Can I just steal a couple moments from you?
Cause life been moving fast , you been stressed can I slow it for you?
I just want to feel your soul
Make sure you don't forget to smell the roses 
Steal a couple moments from you 
So when you're lost in the dark you still know it's an open tunnel
Whenever you feel alone I'll take you on a trip to smell the roses 
Gotta smell the roses 
Girl cause them roses smelling so good , so good 

You've been putting in two shifts 
Paying off them student loans 
And you saving for a new whip
Doing 90 on the highway
You ain't never cruising 
You forgot how love taste 
I'll reintroduce it , write it and produce it 
Duck someone's shootin 
Hold up baby wait a minute maybe that's just Cupid 
Whenever you hear this song I'll take you on a trip 

Can I just steal a couple moments from you?
Cause life been moving fast , you been stressed can I slow it for you?
I just want to feel your soul
Make sure you don't forget to smell the roses 
Steal a couple moments from you 
So when you're lost in the dark you still know it's an open tunnel
Whenever you feel alone I'll take you on a trip to smell the roses 
Gotta smell the roses 
Girl cause them roses smelling so good , so good 

Cause you like dancing in the moonlight
I like seeing you light up when you're living in your true light 
Tonight we gone let it all go
Taking us to new heights 
Not promised tomorrow
Living in the right now 
You can shut your mind down
I know that your thoughts don't stop 
Every time you're tryna wind down 
Whenever you hear this song, I'll take you on a trip 

Can I just steal a couple moments from you?
Cause life been moving fast , you been stressed can I slow it for you?
I just want to feel your soul
Make sure you don't forget to smell the roses 
Steal a couple moments from you 
So when you're lost in the dark you still know it's an open tunnel
Whenever you feel alone I'll take you on a trip to smell the roses 
Gotta smell the roses 
Girl cause them roses smelling so good , so good
