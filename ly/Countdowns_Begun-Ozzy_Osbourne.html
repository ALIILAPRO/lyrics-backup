		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Watching blood stain windows
He must just love the blame
See the children crying
His mother's died again

Dig her grave much deeper
The fatal price you pay
I hope I'm there to hold her
When she comes back again
I see the death and the disaster
There is no happy ever after
The time has come
Countdown's begun
Countdown's begun

Is the Armageddon
Finally here at last
You may see the mushroom
But you won't hear the blast
Don't need a self made prophet
Don't need a holy war
Don't need another D-day
To even up the score

I'm cursed with living on a goldmine
The doomsday clock was built by mankind
No place to run
Countdown's begun
Countdown's begun
Countdown's begun

I see the death and the disaster
There is no happy ever after
The time has come
Countdown's begun
Countdown's begun
Countdown's begun
Countdown's begun
Countdown's begun
Countdown's begun
