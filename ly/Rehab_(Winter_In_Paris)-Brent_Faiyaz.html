		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got too many hoes, but they ain't you
You like to put that shit in your nose, but I still love you
Be doing shit that nobody knows
In the streets they be thinkin' you a lady
But at home (you a motherfuckin' porn star, I swear to God)

If you ain't nasty, don't at me (nasty)
I been working all day (all damn day)
I like to run the street 'til it's dark out 
And then come home and blow your back out, I hope that's okay
I can't leave you alone ('lone, 'lone)
(Not for no 24 hours)
(All damn day)

Lately I been thinking 'bout us (about us, about us, about us)
You as real as they come
But you would rather be on them drugs (the drugs, the drugs, the drugs)
And I would rather hang with my thugs
Fucking with you been drainin' me out, you know that?
But you blow that well, where that throat at?
You better kiss it before I go
(You a motherfuckin' porn star, I swear to God)

If you ain't nasty, don't at me (nasty)
I been working all day (all damn day)
I like to run the street 'til it's dark out 
And then come through and blow your back out, I hope that's okay
I can't leave you alone ('lone, 'lone)
(All damn day)

(All damn day)
(About us, about us, about us)
(All damn day)
(The drugs, the drugs, the drugs)
(All damn day)
