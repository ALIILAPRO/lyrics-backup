		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Load up on guns, bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over-bored, self-assured
Oh no, I know a dirty word
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low

I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift, I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us

And I forget just what I taste
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard, it's harder to find
Oh well, whatever, never mind
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us

A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido

Entertain us, entertain us
Entertain us, entertain us
Entertain us, entertain us

With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, here we are now

A mulatto (an albino), an albino (a mosquito)
A mosquito (my libido), my libido (a stupid thought)

(Oh yeah) entertain us, entertain us 

(Oh yeah) entertain us, entertain us 
Entertain us, entertain us 

(A stupid thought) well never mind
(Now here we go) I'll never mind
(A stupid thought) I'll never mind
(Now here we go) well never mind
