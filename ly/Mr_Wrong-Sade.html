		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He don't care
Where he's been playing
He doesn't hear
A word she's saying
She's a fancy girl
So why's she staying?
Hanging on for Mr. Wrong

He doesn't show her that he needs her
She doesn't know his love's a liar
She's a fancy girl, got to be strong
Say so long, Mr. Wrong

Bye bye
Get out on your own girl
Show him how
You can be strong girl
You don't need him now
Run away, pretty girl
Say so long, Mr. Wrong

Run away
Bye bye
