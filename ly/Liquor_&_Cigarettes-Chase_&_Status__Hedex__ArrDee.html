		  Welcome to the Heartbreak Hotel
Check your problems in
Drop your feelings off
And enjoy your stay

Liquor and cigarettes still on my breath
Twenty missed calls, one hundred and fifty texts
She said, "I know that you been out with them other chicks
I keyed your car up and I'm on my way to see my ex"
Liquor and cigarettes have got me in a mess
But right now I'm up and I think I feel my best
Shouting leads to arguing, from arguing to sex
I like to party, I hardly think that it's disrespect
She said, "Yeah?"
I said, "Yeah, I don't care"
She said, "Yeah?"
I said, "Yeah"
I think that I made it clear
Then we stared
Looked straight into her eyes
I said, "You're 'bout to have the best night of your life"
(Switch)

I said, "You're 'bout to have the best night of your life"
(Wait)
(No)

Liquor and cigarettes have got me in a mess
But right now I'm up and I think I feel my best
Shouting leads to arguing, from arguing to sex
I like to party, I hardly think that it's disrespect
She said, "Yeah?"
I said, "Yeah, I don't care"
She said, "Yeah?"
I said, "Yeah"
I think that I made it clear
Then we stared
Looked straight into her eyes
I said, "You're 'bout to have the best night of your life"
(Switch)

(Best night of your life)
(Best night of your life)
(Best night of your life)
Looked straight into her eyes
I said, "You're 'bout to have the best night of your life"

Liquor and cigarettes still on my breath
Liquor and cigarettes still on my breath
Liquor and cigarettes still on my breath
Liquor and cigarettes still on my breath
Liquor and cigarettes still on my breath
