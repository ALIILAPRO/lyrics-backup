		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wrapped herself around him like a tourniquet
Cold October nights she'd wear his leather jacket
Ah, now she's scared of taking a piss
Can't be sure she's positive

Made her an appointment she was two months late
The car they borrowed broke down before they got out of state
Towed back into town what a drag
She's feeling sick he's feeling bad

Such is the miracle of life
The essence of family is to sacrifice
We could be done with it tonight
The neighborhood doctor says it's sanitized
Lay down on the hard cold ground
Crying's such a soothing sound
Get cured with a coat hanger
Girl you're in America now

Woke up in the morning in a cousin's bed
Something don't look right septic infected and red
Hot forehead like a frying pan
From fever dreams of sweaty men

Lay down on the hard cold ground
Crying's such a soothing sound
Get cured with a coat hanger
Girl you're in America now

Such is the miracle of life
The essence of love is to sacrifice
We could be done with it tonight
The neighborhood doctor says it's sanitized
Lay down on the hard cold ground
Crying's such a soothing sound
Get cured with a coat hanger
Girl you're in America now

Expired on a Sunday
She was young and blonde
Went right up to heaven
We're all children of god
