		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I should have known
By the way that you say nothing much at all
I could have guessed by the messages you send
But never call

But most of all i could have seen it in
The colors of your hair
Because they don't appear in nature
Except to warn you of the danger
And I know that you don't care

But I want you to stay (stay)
I want you to stay (stay)
I want you to stay (stay)
Stay the hell away from me

I could have guessed
If I'd liked you a little less
I probably could have recognized the signs
But I don't mind when your roommate barges in
And lists off every single name but mine

But that's the way it goes
You'll always be the last to know
Till someone comes and slaps you on the face
But it's okay if you're at a loss for words
'Cause I know exactly what I'd say

I'd tell you to stay (stay)
I'd tell you to stay (stay)
I'd tell you to stay (stay)
Stay the hell away from me

I want you to stay (stay)
I want you to stay (stay)
I want you to stay (stay)
Stay the hell away from me

And despite all the silence
I heard about it anyway
Was it me or with Mike
Who stayed for the night?
But only Joe made it through to the day
And that was the summer
That's just life in LA
You're either screening your calls
Or begging for someone to stay

Stay (stay) why don't you stay? (stay)
Why don't you stay? (stay)
Stay the hell away from me
I want you to stay (stay)
I want you to stay (stay)
I just wanted you to stay (stay)
Stay the hell away from me

Just stay the hell away from me
Stay the hell away from me
Just stay the hell away from me
Just stay the hell away from me
