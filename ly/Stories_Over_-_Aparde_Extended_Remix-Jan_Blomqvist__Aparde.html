		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once upon a time ago
Wait, that story's over, yeah
Now it's there on the street
Looking at everyone like a stranger
And it's what you make it 
Yeah, it's what you make it 
No it's what we make it, yeah
Is everyone asking "How far will they take it?"
Can anyone say, losing trust? (losing trust)
Losing what we have had made it
Nothing to replace the net to catch our fall (fall, fall, fall)
They who know the night are the one's who own the teacher 
And the teacher owns the day (day, day, day, day)
We can't stop the train and we can't start it either
Choosing to doubt that we were ever really meant to be free
So turn and face the day 
'Cause they who own the teachers are the teachers of today
