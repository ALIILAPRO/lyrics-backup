		  Touchdown sound

Girl don't keep no secrets from me
When you lock up I hold the key
You already know girl what it was
Yeah, uh
You wanna stay high in the sheets
Then say I'm playing monopoly
Well tell me bout myself so I could justify, why

I'm gon' keep on coming back to you oh
Just hit me when you're lonely
And I'll come over
Don't be acting hella shady
Like I didn't fuck, just the other night

But that's alright, well that's alright, yeah
Show me something different
You ain't gotta lie
But that's alright, well that's alright, yeah
Little mama show me something different (show me something)
Yeah, that's alright, I please you right, girl
Show me something different
You ain't gotta lie
But that's alright, I please you right, girl

You make me feel helpless
Obviously I don't wanna give you pain
I know it's selfish
Too proud to say I don't want anything

I'm gon' keep on coming back to you oh
Just hit me when you're lonely
And I'll come over (I'll come over)
Don't be actin' hella shady
Like I didn't fuck, just the other night

But that's alright, well that's alright, yeah
Show me something different
You ain't gotta lie
But that's alright, well that's alright, yeah
Little mama show me something different (show me something)
Yeah, that's alright, I please you right, girl
Show me something different
You ain't gotta lie
But that's alright, well that's alright, yeah

I'm gon' keep on coming back to you
