		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your love
Love is all around me
Everywhere
Love has come to touch my soul
With someone who really cares
No one can deny us
People who once passed me by
Will turn their heads
I'm happy just to be with you
And lovin' you the way I do
Is everything I need to know
Just restin' in the afterglow (of your fire/love)

You
Yes, you have always been here
A feelin' deep inside
A feelin' that I could not see
Or touch, or try to hide
My love is in and without you
I bless the day that I found you
So listen baby
I'm happy just to be with you

Love is like a voice in my head
Keeps turning out (all) the things that we said
