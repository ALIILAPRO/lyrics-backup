		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am a man at war
And I am fighting for
All of the broken people
All of the people thrown overboard
They always tried to shame us
But they don't speak the language
No we're not nameless, we're not faceless
We were born for greatness

(Oh, oh oh) somebody sound the alarm
(Oh, oh oh) a fire was set in the dark
(Oh, oh oh) it's time that you know
No, we're not nameless, we're not faceless
We were born for greatness

It doesn't matter if the world has gone mad
If we just hold on, if we just hold on yeah
The sky is falling and the world has gone mad
And we sing our songs, and we just hold on yeah
So if you're running, stop running
One life, one chance, start living
Sing it louder just to let the world know
No, we're not nameless, we're not faceless
We were born for greatness

We're not nameless, we're not faceless
We were born for greatness
We're not nameless, we're not faceless
We were born for greatness

They say that I'm reckless
Because I'm relentless
They spit on my face, and curse on my name
They're taking my life in vengeance
Yeah, you can try and blame us
And try to take what's sacred
But we're not nameless, we're not faceless
We were born for greatness

(Oh, oh oh) somebody sound the alarm
(Oh, oh oh) a fire was set in the dark
(Oh, oh oh) it's time that you know
No we're not nameless, we're not faceless
We were born for greatness

It doesn't matter if the world has gone mad
If we just hold on, if we just hold on yeah
The sky is falling and the world has gone mad
And we sing our songs, and we just hold on yeah
So if you're running, stop running
One life, one chance, start living
Sing it louder just to let the world know
No we're not nameless, we're not faceless
We were born for greatness

We're not nameless, we're not faceless
We were born for greatness
No we're not nameless, we're not faceless
We were born for greatness

Somebody sound the alarm
It's time that you know

It doesn't matter if the world has gone mad
If we just hold on, if we just hold on yeah
Sing it louder just to let the world know

No we're not nameless, we're not faceless We were born for greatness
No we're not nameless, we're not faceless We were born for greatness
No we're not nameless, we're not faceless We were born for greatness

We were born for greatness
No we're not nameless, we're not faceless
We were born for greatness
