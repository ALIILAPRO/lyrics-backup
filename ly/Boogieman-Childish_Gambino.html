		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  With a gun in your hand, I'm the boogieman
I'm gonna come and get you

If you point a gun at my rising sun
Though we're not the one
But in the bounds of your mind
We have done the crime, yeah

Boogieman
You've got to help us, can you? (Yes I can)
Boogieman
You've got to help us, can you? (Yes I can)

With a gun in your hand, I'm the boogieman
I'm gonna come and get you

Every boy and girl all around the world
Knows my nigga's words
But if he's scared of me, how can we be free? Yes

Boogieman (yes)
You've got to help us, can you? (Yes I can, oh)
Boogieman
You've got to help us, can you? (Yes I can, oh)

(Boogieman)
(Boogieman)
