		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna lose my head just yet
I haven't even started coming, uh, uh
I'm not ready to set my bet
I don't wanna be any more involved than I am, uh, uh

Do you wanna
Do you wanna, do you wanna, do you wanna stay?
Do you wanna
Do you wanna, do you wanna, do you wanna go away?
Do you wanna
Do you wanna, do you wanna, do you wanna play?
Do you wanna
Do you wanna, do you wanna, do you wanna go away?

Come over here
Don't miss this chance
Oh, life's just sitting there
But love isn't always
Come over here
Don't miss this chance
Oh, life's just sitting there
But love isn't always

Come, come over here
It's worth it, it's worth it
It's already there
It feels so perfect
Come on, would you just ride with me
You've earned it, you've earned it
Come on, would you just shake with me?
We both deserve it
