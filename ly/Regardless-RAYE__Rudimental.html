		  Oh, regard, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
Oh, regard, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
Yeah-yeah

Now you got me all like
I hate wakin' up alone
Call me when you're headin' home
I got things I need to say 
That I can't say to you over the telephone
Four, five glasses all alone
Boys and girls just come and go
I haven't seen you for a minute
I don't like it, not at all

Ooh, one thing that I know
Is as hard as I try
I can't face the thought of you not being in my life
Regardless

Regardless of the tears I cried for you today
Regardless of the words we think but never say
You're always in my mind somehow
Whether we're up or down
Regardless
Regardless

Oh, regard, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
Oh, regard, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la

No, this house is not a home
When I'm sleepin' all alone
I'm used to havin', I'm on hold
Then I can't touch you through the phone, hmm
Baby, when you turn me cold
I still got your t-shirt on, oh
Haven't seen you for a minute, no
I don't like it, not at all

Ooh, one thing that I know
Is as hard as I try
I can't face the thought of you not being in my life
Oh, yeah

Regardless of the tears I cried for you today
Regardless of the words we think but never say
You're always in my mind somehow
Whether we're up or down
Regardless
Regardless

Oh, regard, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
Oh, regard, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la

Oh, baby, why would you wanna make a girl 
Make a girl feel so crazy?
The things that you do to me, ooh 
It's as if you don't rate me, ah
Baby, don't play me, ah
This ain't no game to me, ah

Regardless of the tears I cried for you today
Regardless of the words we think but never say
You're always in my mind somehow
Whether we're up or down
Regardless
Regardless

Oh, regard, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
Oh, regard, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
