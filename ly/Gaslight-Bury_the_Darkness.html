		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Twisting truth like a knife
Stab me in the back
Fabricating your reality
Manipulate the past
To serve yourself in the present
Power and control to mold me in your own image
Self serving hypocrite
Devil in disguise
Deny deny
But I can see it in your eyes
You're gaslighting me
I see what isn't true
I'm sick of all the lies you feed me
After it's said and done
You'll be the one who lost
You're losing your grip on me
Can't break your curse
Chained by your words
(Everything's your fault)
Everything's my fault
Even if it's not
Verbally assaulting me
Until I start to doubt
What the fuck is real?
What the fuck is fake?
Was your plan to be bleed me out until I fucking break?
You're gaslighting me
I see what isn't true
I'm sick of all the lies you feed me
After it's said and done
You'll be the one who lost
You're losing your grip on me
The veil of your facade has come undone
You see I've escaped this web you've spun
Desperately clawing for one last breath
As I purge you from my life
Look me in the eyes while I burn you alive
Bitch
Fuck you
Die
Die
Die
