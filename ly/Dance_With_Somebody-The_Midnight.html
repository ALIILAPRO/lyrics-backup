		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take off your armor
Friend of mine
I have no arrows
But I got time
All your sorrow
Keeps you glued to your seat
Can we get you out of your head
And into your feet
And it's not that the rest of us don't have the blues
It's just that some dance partners need a dance partner too
Is that you?

(Some dance partners need a dance partner too)
(Is that you?)

Life's too short to dance by yourself
Could I get you to dance with somebody
Dance with somebody, dance with somebody
Not by yourself
Life's too short to dance by yourself
Could I get you to dance with somebody
Dance with somebody, dance with somebody
Not by yourself

Take off your armor
Let down your hair
You could sit on your hands
Or you could get closer, if you dare
And it's not that the rest of us don't have to fight
For every bit of love, and every bit of light, tonight
It's Friday night

(Some dance partners need a dance partner too)
(Is that you?)

Life's too short to dance by yourself
Could I get you to dance with somebody
Dance with somebody, dance with somebody
Not by yourself
Life's too short to dance by yourself
Could I get you to dance with somebody
Dance with somebody, dance with somebody
Not by yourself
Life's too short to dance by yourself
Could I get you to dance with somebody
Dance with somebody, dance with somebody
Not by yourself
Life's too short to dance by yourself
Could I get you to dance with somebody
Dance with somebody, dance with somebody
Not by yourself

By, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by
By, by, by, by, by
By, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by
By yourself
By, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by
By, by, by, by, by
By, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by
By yourself

Life's too short to dance by yourself
Could I get you to dance with somebody
Dance with somebody, dance with somebody
Not by yourself
Life's too short to dance by yourself
Could I get you to dance with somebody
Dance with somebody, dance with somebody
Not by yourself
Life's too short to dance by yourself
Could I get you to dance with somebody
Dance with somebody, dance with somebody
Not by yourself
Life's too short to dance by yourself
Could I get you to dance with somebody
Dance with somebody, dance with somebody
Not by yourself

By, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by
By, by, by, by, by
By, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by
By yourself
By, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by
By, by, by, by, by
By, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by
By yourself
