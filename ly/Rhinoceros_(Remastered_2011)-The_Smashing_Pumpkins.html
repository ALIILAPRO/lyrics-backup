		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Planned a show
Trees and balloons
Ice cream snow
See you in June 

Could have known
I would reveal
Should have known
I would conceal your way

She knows, and she knows, she knows, she knows
And she knows, she knows, she knows
How's
She knows, she knows, she knows
She knows, she knows

Colors show
After the moon
I should go
See you in June
Your way

She knows, and she knows, she knows, she knows
And she knows, she knows, she knows
How's
And she knows, she knows, she knows
And she knows, she knows

Open your eyes
To these mustard lies
Open your eyes
To these mustard lies
The way

She knows, and she knows, she knows, she knows
And she knows, she knows, she knows
How's
And she knows, she knows, she knows
And she knows, she knows, she knows
