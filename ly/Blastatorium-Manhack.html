		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the galaxy is a stage
And all the species merely players in this game
They have their exits and their entrances
One mans pain, in time, knows many
Knows many layers
At first the infant
Screams with a battering of harmonies
And then the lover
With dreary eyes and pressed to find
That which waits across the stars
What will reside
Then a soldier
Remaining callous
And then an army
Remaining valiant
Even in the mouth of the beast we reign supreme
And then the justice
Here in the graveyard of this civilizations dream
At last the justice
Lay waste in the Blastatorium
Only one will rise in the Blastatorium
Lay waste in the Blastatorium
Only one will rise from the Blastatorium
