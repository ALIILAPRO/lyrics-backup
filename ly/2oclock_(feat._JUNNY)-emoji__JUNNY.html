		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My time is stuck in 2 o clock
And I know that I be comin your way
Pull up anytime I want
Cuz it's 2 o clock
And I know that I'll be missin your face
Matter of fact it's not my fault
I'm hearin you through the line
And I can't see your face
But feel like I'm by your side
Keeping you keeping you from
Tryna fade away
I don't want
Anyone else
In my life cuz no lie
You got everythin I need and you know it
You know that it's true
So now I'll make a move
Girl hear what I'm about to say
I I I
I'm loosin all my sleep
Tryna save myself from you
I've tried
Tried to dream bout you and I
My time is stuck in 2 o clock
And I know that I be comin your way
Pull up anytime I want
Cuz it's 2 o clock
And I know that I'll be missin your face
Matter of fact it's not my fault
It's gettin freaky yeah
My heart is racin but it's alright
I feel you touchin and it's so wrong
But it's feeling right
Drown in alcohol gettin tipsy like
I'm lettin go of it all
Rainin down my emotions
I'm feelin somethin I have never felt
Lettin you decide
Tell me why you never wanna do
Anything that I would've wanted
Or I'm askin for
I believe
I can be
Someone that youre needin
Desperate for your lovin
If only you can see
What I've got waitin for you
I'm dancin with the demons
Playin my heart for you
