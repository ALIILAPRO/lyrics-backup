		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know what to say to you
What version of yourself have you been listening to?
You will find your so-called love?
You will find your so-called?

You don't get to break it all
And break the rest with someone else

Such a simple act
Got hold of you
What's the use of looking back?
And all that we've been through?

You will find your so-called love?
You will find your so-called...

You don't get to break it all
And break the rest with someone else

Where did you expect you will find the cure?
What version of yourself will die before..

You will find your so-called love?
You will find your so-called
