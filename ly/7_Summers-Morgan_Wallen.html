		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, you used to talk about
Gettin' even further south
Somewhere where the summer lasted all year 'round
Probably got a big ol' diamond on your hand right now
Maybe a baby or a couple by now
Long driveway to a big white house

But I wonder when you're drinkin'
If you find yourself thinkin'
About that boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers of Coke
And Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?
Back then you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago?

Yeah, I bet your daddy's so proud
Of how his little girl turned out
Think she dodged a bullet
Of a good ol' boy like me
'Cause I still go drinkin', same friends on Friday
Bought a few acres, couple roads off the highway
Guess you never saw things my way, anyway

But I wonder when you're drinkin'
If you find yourself thinkin'
About that boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers of Coke
And Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?
Back then you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago?

Seven summers ago
Seven summers ago

Yeah, I wonder when you're drinkin'
If you find yourself thinkin'
About that boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers of Coke
And Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?
Back then you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago?

Seven summers ago
Seven summers ago
