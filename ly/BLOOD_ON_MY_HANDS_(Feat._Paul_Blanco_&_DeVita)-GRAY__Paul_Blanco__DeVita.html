		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got blood on my hands, hands, hands
I got blood on my hands, oh-oh
I got blood on my hands, oh-oh
I got blood on my hands, hands, oh

Blood on my hands
Blood on my hands
Blood on my hands
Blood on my hands
Blood on my hands

The old days are long gone (long gone)
Swear to God, I knew something's been going on (going on)
Pity party, I kick back, I been on
But not for long as soon as I get back I'll be gone (gone)
Step on they throat with my heels on (heels on)
Okay, when I play God? I pray God
Okay, when I don't trip, I don't fall
Fast forward when I play, I don't pause
I hate you, it's a bad habit
I'm so off track, but bounced back like a damn rabbit
I'm built like that, good news 'bout my bad habits
So please stay down
You don't know the half of it

(Blood on my hands)
Who's hands are these?
Oh, they mine
Who's hands are these?
Oh, they mine
(Blood on my hands)
Who's hands are these?
Oh, they mine
Who's hands are these?

Back for revenge, I need a million in chips
They tried this demon child, now, you gon' watch me come for your kin
Yo, Broski fry that kid, we turn his ass to calamari
Now I'm in a different country touching different color money (heh, yeah)
I really hate 'em all, yo, Devi that's a good habit, bun 'em all
Fit this goof and all his friends in one casket nicely
I leave no one behind, I'm so polite, heh
Uh? (야, 숨쉬기 힘들지? 어? 죽어, 그냥 죽어)
Sorry, just pray for me 아빠 (아빠)
I'ma sicko, I laugh at you aha (aha)
Uh, I was really raised with the monsters
I don't remember eating no donuts, but look its

(Blood on my hands)
Who's hands are these?
Oh, they mine
Who's hands are these?
Oh, they mine
Who's hands are these? (Ladies and gentlemen)
Oh, they mine (it was a cold blooded, premeditated murder)
Who's hands are these? (Good night)

I got blood on my hands, hands, hands
I got blood on my hands, hands
I got blood on my hands, hands, hands
I got blood on my hands, hands

I got this blood on my hands, oh, oh
Blood on, oh-ah-hoo-hoo, ooh-ooh, ooh
I got this blood on my hands
Blood on my hands
Blood on my hands, oh
Blood on my hands, oh
