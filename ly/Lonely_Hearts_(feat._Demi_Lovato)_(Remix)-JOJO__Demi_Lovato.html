		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know myself well
I know just what to do with my own touch
I can spray my Chanel
In this empty hotel, came back to the Roosevelt

Where I can't abuse my trust
Can switch up and ghost on us, I cannot fuck me up
Like you, I'm insecure enough
And so tired of guessin' if you care

How can I work on me if I'm working on your body? (I'm working on your body)
I thought we were meant to be, but we never really got it, did we?
I know one thing, lonely hearts won't break (no)
Hearts won't break (no)
Lonely hearts won't break (no)
Hearts won't break 
Hearts won't break

I can pick up the phone right now
Make that 2 A.M call
I know just what to say
But that ain't what I need right now
And I won't let my wants get in my way

'Cause you might abuse my trust (oh)
Can switch up and ghost on us, I cannot fuck me up
Like you, I'm insecure enough (oh)
And I don't need to be guessin' if you care

How can I work on me if I'm working on your body? (Working on your body, oh no)
I thought we were meant to be, but we never really got it, did we?
I know one thing, lonely hearts won't break (no)
Hearts won't break (no)
Lonely hearts won't break (no)
Hearts won't break (no)

I'm likin' bein' alone
Emotions under control
Right now is only for me (me, me)
Just tryna find myself
I don't need nobody's help
Oh, don't take it personally

I know one thing, lonely hearts won't break (no)
Hearts won't break (no)
Lonely hearts won't break (no)
Hearts won't break (no)

Me if I'm working
Working on your body
Me if I'm 
Me if I'm 
Me if I'm working on your body
Me if I'm working
Me
