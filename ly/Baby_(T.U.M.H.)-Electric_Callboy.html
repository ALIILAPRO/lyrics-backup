		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's go!

Baby, I need a chance to make you understand
I live my life for you till the better end
I confessed my love to you
In my dreams I have faith that you feel it too

All my life I've been into you
So take a deep breath when I say to you
Baby, I just wanna make it stop
Right now
This chase took a big part of me, but you never really cared
You are the one that I wanna spend my life with

It's tearing up my heart when I'm with you
But when we are apart I feel it too
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you

So tell me, how can I make you feel my love?
When will I be the one that you're dreaming of?
This love is more than I ever felt before
And I know you're the one that is worth fighting for

All my life I've been into you
So take a deep breath when I say to you
Baby, I just wanna make it stop
Right now
This chase took a big part of me, but you never really cared
You are the one that I wanna spend my life with

It's tearing up my heart when I'm with you
But when we are apart I feel it too
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you

Tearin' up my heart and soul
We're apart I feel it too
And no matter what I do I feel the pain
With or without you

Tearin' up my heart and soul
We're apart I feel it too
And no matter what I do I feel the pain
With or without you

It's tearing up my heart
It's tearing up my heart

It's tearing up my heart when I'm with you
But when we are apart I feel it too
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you

It's tearing up my heart when I'm with you
But when we are apart I feel it too
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you

Let's go!

And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
