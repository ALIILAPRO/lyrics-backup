		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh
My mic sounds nice, check one (wo wo wo)
My mic sounds nice, check two (uh-huh yeah-yeah)
Testing, one, two, one, two
Let's go
Uh, huh, uh, huh
Let's go
Yeah, yeah
Let's go
My mic sounds nice, check one
My mic sounds nice, check two (testing, testing)

Stone-stone when I'm in my zoney zone
Smokin' on the homegrown
Feeling like I'm all alone
Used to go to Kingdom, Rucker Park with Tony Tone (Harlem!)
Listenin' to Bone Bone, feelin's in my bone bone
I can tell if- I could give a fuck about a list, ya heard? (ya heard?)
I could give a fuck about a diss, ya heard? (ya heard?)
I could give a fuck about your clique, ya heard? (ya heard?)
Shut the fuck up 'fore I rock your bitch, ya heard? (ya heard?)
Shut the fuck up

My mama named me
My papa gave me cock to take a piss with
To fuck ya bitch with
Life is different for me, for instance
For the type of niggas sprays jizz in some chicks
He wouldn't raise his kids with
That type of twisted shit
Come on, man

What you say nigga?
Times out
Let's start over with this conversation
You sound super crazy right now and I got my two kids listenin'
I'm just playing
You said what
I said I'm just playing
Uh-uh nigga you got me fucked up
Shut the fuck up

I could give a fuck about a list, ya heard? (ya heard?)
I could give a fuck about a diss, ya heard? (ya heard?)
I could give a fuck about your clique, ya heard? (ya heard?)
Shut the fuck up 'fore I rock your bitch, ya heard? (ya heard?)
Shut the fuck up

People think I'm an asshole, I say anything (c'mon)
Truthfully, I just say what I really think
Like I'm too fresh, man, to be you're under-class-man (too fresh)
Would say "suck my dick" but that's sexual harassment, take that (let's go)
Fuck around and Willy come through in the Merc' on ya (come on)
Who else you know design ya stage and do your merch over (come on)
And if you lame do your verse over (yeah)
I changed the game like I'm Kurt Warner (yeah)
I run the game (keep goin') like I'm Time Warner (yeah)
This ain't no Teen Choice Awards (keep goin') I'm slide on ya (yeah)
And make your home for mama's fried roasting
And lean and beans, tomatoes, potatoes
And keys, and grams, just me and Yams (yeah, come on)

See me rest in peace
Pickin' off the last collard greens
Fresh supply the beat
Now we sellin' out the colosseum
For the dynasty
Tell 'em whores who got it lock and got the key
You proud to see, behind the scenes or in the streets

Peep my repertoire, Uptown, Esplanade 
Eleanor, grew ham, niggas goin' too ham
AK, Jackie Rob
East Eleven, ninety-nine
Lennox Ave, VLONE
East side Wayne Stone (uptown)

Stone-stone when I'm in my zoney zone
Smokin' on the homegrown
Feeling like I'm all alone
Used to go to Kingdom, Rucker Park with Tony Tone (Harlem!)
Listenin' to Bone Bone, feelin's in my bone bone
I can tell if- I could give a fuck about a list, ya heard? (ya heard?)
I could give a fuck about a diss, ya heard? (ya heard?)
I could give a fuck about your clique, ya heard? (ya heard?)
Shut the fuck up 'fore I rock your bitch, ya heard? (ya heard?)

Ayo, we don't give a fuck about none of that shit
This is Harlem motherfuckers (yeah yeah)
Fuck you think (uptown nigga)
Mob, A$AP, same gang
Tone Rock
Harlem
