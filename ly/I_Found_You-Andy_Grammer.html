		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On the way I was crowned the king
Felt the wind underneath my wings
I been high and I been low
Played the fool and the star of the show

Gone along for a wild ride
And I can say looking in your eyes
That it all would have been a waste
But I found you on the way

I found cynicism
I found criticism
I've been the zero the hero
And I have been the villain
I've lost more than a heart could take
But I found you on the way
(On the way)

I found you, I found you
I found you, I found you
Oh, it all would've been a waste
But I found you on the way

On the way
I was the given the keys
To the city they were mine to keep
Over time every lock will change
But you'll love me all the same

I found pessimism
I found skepticism
I been the corner performer
And sung in front of millions
I've lost more then a heart can take
But I found you on the way
(On the way)

I found you, I found you
I found you, I found you
Oh it all would've been a waste
But I found you on the way

Whoa oh oh, oh oh oh, oh
Whoa oh oh, oh oh oh, oh
Whoa oh oh, oh oh oh, oh
Whoa oh oh, oh oh oh, oh

On the way I'll have won the race
If the one thing that I can say

(I found you, I found you
I found you, I found you
It all would've been a waste
But I found you on the way)

(Whoa oh oh, oh oh oh, oh) I found you, I found you
(Whoa oh oh, oh oh oh, oh) I found you, I found you
(Whoa oh oh, oh oh oh, oh) I found you, I found you
(Whoa oh oh, oh oh oh, oh) I found you on the way
