		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm feeling Pink, Blue
That's new
Riding round my head
I cannot think straight
That's strange
I wish you were here so you could
stay for a long time
Think about what you said
it made me day dream
lazy
Then i saw your face yeah

I'm feeling Pink, Blue
That's new
Riding round my head
I cannot think straight
That's strange
I wish you were here so you could
stay for a long time
Think about what you said
it made me day dream
lazy
Then i saw your face yeah

I love the way how she's keeps me calmer
When I feel trauma
Got me feeling all types of heart ache
Don't get me started
On the way you move
Bite ye lip then you stay in your groove
Hard to get so I'm playing it cool
After this I'm breaking the rules

I feel these moments
Got me breathing slowly
Can we please please go feel the night

Said i can't sleep peacefully
In my dreams these demons
Baby please heal me from this fight


And I'm like ou 
I don't know I don't know I don't know what i gotta do
When I'm not with you
I'm alone I'm alone I'm alone
Can you come through?

I'm feeling Pink, Blue
That's new
Riding round my head
I cannot think straight
That's strange
I wish you were here so you could
stay for a long time
Think about what you said
it made me day dream
lazy
Then i saw your face yeah

I'm feeling Pink, Blue
That's new
Riding round my head
I cannot think straight
That's strange
I wish you were here so you could
stay for a long time
Think about what you said
it made me day dream
lazy
Then i saw your face yeah


Dekha meine tera chehra kyu
Dekhe ke hogaya mein gum yu
Badalo mein dekhu tu dikhe
Aankhein band toh bhi hoti tum

Ab yeh kya hua
Mein janu na
Yeh dil ko pehli baar hua hai
Kya pata 
Tha mujhko ki tum



Aise aaogey
Bas jaaogey
Aur mujhko yu haraogey
Haa mein hargaya
Toh aab bhi jai tum

Tumsey kyuuuuu
Saari baatein karna chahta hu
Tumsey kyuuuuu
Saari baatein karna chahta hu

I'm feeling Pink, Blue
That's new
Riding round my head
I cannot think straight
That's strange
I wish you were here so you could
stay for a long time
Think about what you said
it made me day dream
lazy
Then i saw your face yeah

I'm feeling Pink, Blue
That's new
Riding round my head
I cannot think straight
That's strange
I wish you were here so you could
stay for a long time
Think about what you said
it made me day dream
lazy
Then I saw your face yeah
