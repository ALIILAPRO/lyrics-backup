		<p>
		  Pop my shit yea
I got different color shoes different color fits
I got different color moods I am a bipolar jit
I am so fed up with this
She said her heart is broken I ain’t got no healing kit
I know his hoe gonna wanna suck my dick when she check out my kicks
And I can get in bed bout a week make her do backflips
And I be stepping on these niggas necks don’t fuck with that kid
And I could teach your man how to finesse like give me that bitch
And I just wanna know
And I just wanna know how it go
These bitches will take your soul
These niggas is snakes I know
And she just want to hang with the goats
And I can’t really blame her, no
My niggas is stuck with the code
Wanna love but my heart too cold
How y’all niggas biting swag boy I did it first
And tell your bitch don’t look at me or I’m a quench her thirst
Ain’t I ain’t sparing none these niggas hit them wear it hurt
And she told me I’m like a drug I’m like a fucking curse
And you know it
Bands on my kicks I’m bankrolling
She said that I act too controlling
Why you keep on asking where we going
And I just wanna know
And I just wanna know how it go
These bitches will take your soul
These niggas is snakes I know
And she just want to hang with the goats
And I can’t really blame her no
My niggas is stuck with the code
Wanna love but my heart too cold
And you know it
Bands on my kicks I’m bankrolling
She said that I act too controlling
Why you keep on asking where we going
