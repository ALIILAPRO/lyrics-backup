		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  [ KM.G ]
Yo, Cold 187
They tryin to give you a murder rap
And you ain't even like that
Yo, serve these niggas, cause they deserve to get dissed
(Yeah) 
(Check this out)

[ VERSE 1: Cold 187um ]
When I sit down and write and recite for the mic I hold
Make sure my beats are loud, and bold, and Cold
187, that is my name, makin it simple and plain
Here to rearrange and change
The things that I didn't do in the past
Don't be surprised when you got a shotgun up your ass
Perpetrators, that one was just for you
I'm gonna leave ya in your seat remaining without a clue
Glued to my style like a fiend on coke
But if you say the wrong thing, I wash your mouth out with soap
Dope is not the answer
No, I'm not a Cancer
No, I'm not a hero or zero
But a Leo in stereo
And this is not a demo
K-oss and Go Mack be cuttin the flex tempo
Fast

	(Now I got a murder rap)
	(Cause a brother like me said, well...)	(4x)

[ KM.G ]
Yo, fingerprints ain't nothin without the murder weapon
Keep steppin
Homicide tried to sweat, but we let em have it
You can see they fear through they tears
Treat em like Robanes and give em some relief

[ VERSE 2: Cold 187um ]
I feel action speaks louder than words and verbs
And adjectives, I live the life, the given gift
Not who's first, second or third
Not he said or she said, or what you heard, nerd
Cause when you live like that, your life is mangled
In other words your life is all tangled
Up, I'm not a sucker, always go for mine
Powerlord that's hard from the start, and we will always (climb)
To the top as I seek and achieve
Sometimes that's even higher than the others believe
I'm not a doctor on a board, I don't have a degree
Not arrogant, egotistical, I'm the epitomy
Re-take, recline, keep suckers in line
Transform into another world as I recite these rhymes
187, he's as hard as it comes
And I don't have to brag about the size of my gun, son

	(Now I got a murder rap)
	(Cause a brother like me said, well...)	(3x)

[ KM.G ]
Criminals don't use lyrics and define themselves as notorious
Brothers gotta learn hip-hop anger rages inside themselves
Your ??? will never resist to my contact K-oss and the homie G

[ VERSE 3: Cold 187um ]
187 breakin back, backbone of my group
Fat kid in my posse, and I'm gettin loose
Cause I'm takin out posses, causin bodily harm
Makin moves to improve as I begin to brainstorm
I'm not inferior, not takin no crap
Last sucker tried to dis me, cold got his neck slapped
Cause Power's my name, sometimes I'm insane
And if I get too mad, I have to rearrange
The posistion as a MC, that's the way it should be
The way I get over, I use terminology
That's comprehensive, redemptive
That's evidently not related to the style that you hear everyday
be	-boy destroyin a toy, employin
While the other suckers are depressed, I'm enjoyin
What I'm doin, and ruin any insult of my position
Tell em KM.G - they on a mission

[ KM.G ]
They on a mission
They keep wishin you can't come off
187, you're a menace in your own mind
So take heed and proceed with caution
When he rhymes

	(Now I got a murder rap)
	(Here's a murder rap to keep ya dancin)	--> Ice Cube
	(Now I got a murder rap)
	(Cause a brother like me said, well...)
	(Now I got a murder rap)
	(Cause a brother like me said, well...)
	(Now I got a murder rap)
	(Cause a brother like me said, well...)
	(Now I got a murder rap)
	(Here's a murder rap to keep ya dancin)
	(Now I got a murder rap)
	(Cause a brother like me said, well...)
	(Now I got a murder rap)
	(Cause a brother like me said, well...)
	(Now I got a murder rap)
	(Cause a brother like me said, well...)
	(Now I got a murder rap)
	(Here's a murder rap to keep ya dancin)
	(Now I got a murder rap)
	(Cause a brother like me said, well...)
	(I got a murder rap)
