		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something you said made me lose it again
I can't remember the last time you made me feel safe.
There's no room for love, no time for understanding
Sometimes I start a fight just to see if you care.
It's not getting better
It's not getting any easier.
I never thought I'd become so cold inside.
Day after day, we're wishing our lives would change
As long as you say it's alright, it's alright with me.
If we promise too much; more than enough.
I never thought it'd be easy, not hard like this.
It's not getting better
It's not getting any easier.
I never thought I'd become so cold inside.
It's not getting better;
It's not getting any easier.
I never thought I'd become so cold inside.
I never thought it'd be easy; not hard like this.
I never thought it'd be easy; not hard like this.
I never thought it'd be easy; not hard like this.
I never thought it'd be easy; not hard like this.
I never thought it'd be easy.
