		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You got to dance closer to the ones that you love
You got to dance closer to the ones that you love


You got to dance closer to the ones that you love
You got to dance closer to the ones that you love

Feel the rhythm with me
What must I do to make you see
Baby we could be a groove

Feel the rhythm with me
What must I do to make you see
Baby we could be a groove

You and I together
Dancing this rhythm
Rhythm of love, rhythm of love...
