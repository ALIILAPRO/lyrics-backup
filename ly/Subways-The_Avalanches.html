		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You walk on the subway, subway
You walk on the subway (it moves around)
You walk on the subway, it moves around
So you go to see what you found
(Subway, subway, it moves around)

I ain't in no hurry
I ain't in no hurry
I ain't in no hurry
I ain't in no hurry
I ain't in no hurry

You walk on the subway, it moves around
You walk on the subway, it moves around
You hear someone scream so you go to see what you found
You walk on the subway, (it moves around)

I ain't in no hurry
I ain't in no hurry

You walk on the subway, it moves around
You hear someone scream so you go to see what you found
You walk on the subway

I ain't in no hurry
