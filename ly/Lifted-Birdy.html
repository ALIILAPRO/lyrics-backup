		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Haunting
Keep my (eyes from), haunting
Keep my (eyes from), haunting
Keep my (eyes from), haunting
Haunting

Part to this lonely road
You gave me hope, gave me hope
Woke my drifting soul
And led me home, led me home

Won't you just stay here
Chase it with my fears
Solve my mysteries
Won't you just stay here
Chase it with my fears
Set my spirit free

Won't you lead the way
Through my darker days
Keep them softly spoken
(Keep them softly spoken)
Show me the way
To a brighter place
Keep my eyes from closing
(Keep my eyes from closing)

Oh lifted away from my givenness (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh lifted away from my secrets (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Haunting
Keep my (eyes from), haunting
Keep my (eyes from), haunting
Keep my (eyes from)

Hold my heavy bones
They weigh me down, weigh me down
Held by a single thread
When you are gone, when you're gone 

Won't you just stay here
Chase it with my fears
Solve my mysteries

Won't you lead the way
Through my darker days
Keep them softly spoken
(Keep them softly spoken)
Show me the way
To a brighter place
Keep my eyes from closing
(Keep my eyes from closing)

Oh lifted away from my givenness (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh lifted away from my secrets (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

And if they start to fade
I will keep you safe
Like you do 
And if you feel afraid
I will keep your faith
Like you do, ooh

Won't you lead the way
Through my darker days
Keep them softly spoken
(Keep them softly spoken)
Show me the way
To a brighter place
Keep my eyes from closing
(Keep my eyes from closing)

Oh lifted away from my givenness (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh lifted away from my secrets (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
