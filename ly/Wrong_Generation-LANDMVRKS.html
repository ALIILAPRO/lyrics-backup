		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can feel something crawling beneath our skin
«you better pull it out»

You're not big enough to have my respect
We, the voice of passion, the voice of youth
We're the wrong generation and we have to prove
Overwhelming by the sins you've introduced
That we never lose the fight against your rules
Promise me the worst, I’ll be standing and never lose
Motherfucker I don't even know you
I will cross every line that you drew

‘cause I’m about to close this open door
Of what we have become
Yeah I know that we've seen it all before
You've got my back against the wall

We better forget but you know that we can't forgive
In front of me, I cannot see the world like it is supposed to be. I’ll build my faith no matter what is yours

‘cause I’m about to close this open door
Of what we have become
Yeah I know that we've seen it all before
You've got my back against the wall

Have you ever seen it before?
My back against the wall
Yeah we are the voice of your passion
We're the youth, the wrong generation
I’ll be standing right here and never lose
Yeah we keep fighting against your rules
We are the youth
We better pull it out
