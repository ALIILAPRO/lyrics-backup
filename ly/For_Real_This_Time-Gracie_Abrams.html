		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think that maybe I was right
Back when I knew to draw the line
Already gave what I could offer
Maybe we'll work another time
I guess the thought of it's enough
No going back or switching up
I really wish that I could do that
Walking away from you is tough

I know we've run it dry
I've heard that happens sometimes
I shouldn't be surprised
Should I?

I've packed my bags in the middle of the night
A thousand times I got up to say goodbye
I could be wrong but I think that I'm for real this time
I've taken down all the pictures in my room
I've hidden things that reminded me of you
I know I've lied but I think that I'm for real this time

Couldn't you tell when I was off
You never asked me what it was
I kinda hope you feel the same way
So that I'm not the only one

Who thinks we've run it dry
But still we've stayed a long time
I'm sorry if I make you cry tonight

'Cause I've packed my bags in the middle of the night
A thousand times I got up to say goodbye
I could be wrong but I think that I'm for real this time
I've taken down all the pictures in my room
I've hidden things that reminded me of you
I know I've lied but I think that I'm for real this time

I know that I've lied
But we're running dry
Know I won't come back this time
I know that I've lied
But we're running dry
Think that I'm for real this time

I've packed my bags in the middle of the night
A thousand times I got up to say goodbye
I could be wrong but I think that I'm for real this time
