		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitch I'm in the club, t-tear it all up
She just called me daddy
But I really didn't give a fuck
On my dick like, "What?"
She slap it on all my cuts
Everybody knows me
But I can't even seem to trust

Emo shawty wanna fuck me in the backroom
Alright getting drunk up in the club
And she feel me all night
She just fucking texted me
Girl you get me super high
Take a pic, of my dick
Girl you can't feel it, super numb

Bitch I'm in the club
And she's tearing it off
And I really don't give a fuck
But I really want to dance
And I really want to fuck
But I really don't care
Baby girl can you just
Suck on my di-di-di-di-di, no

Emo shawty wanna fuck me in the backroom
Alright getting drunk up in the club
And shе feel me all night
She just fucking textеd me
Girl you get me super high
Take a pic, of my dick
Girl you can't feel it, super numb

At the standoff, take your fuckin panties off
And I'll blastoff
Yeah I'll fucking blast off
At the standoff, take your fuckin panties off
And I'll blast off
Yeah I'll fucking blast off
