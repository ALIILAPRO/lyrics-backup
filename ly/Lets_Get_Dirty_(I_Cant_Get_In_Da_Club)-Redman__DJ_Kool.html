		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Attention, all you niggaz
All you bitches
Time to put down the Cristal
Time to take off the ice
For a minute
Time to throw a little mud
In this motherfucker
Turn me up some
Yo

Oh shit
Who those motherfuckers
Comin' in here?
No, it can't be
Ah

Yo yo, gimme some room
I'm throwin' elbows
Timberland boots, Air Force
And shell-toes
Who the fuck is them?
If I gotta pay to get in the club
I'ma go pop the trunk and turn
The street volume up to ten
I ain't on the guest list, I ain't VIP
I snuck in the exit, learned to D-I-P
My dress code is all black
When I'm makin' the moves
Similar to the new PlayStation 2
I can't help it if the club
Only packin' a G
And the fire marshal want to
Shut it down in 3
And you ballin' as* niggaz
Whose dressed to kill
For the h*es showin' the toes
With extra heels (man)
I gotta get in, I drove here
With a carload of bitches
Charged on Belvedere
My niggaz hit the cells
If the line is thick
So I drive the 500, through
The door of the bitch

Yo Red, wassup man?
Aye they ain't tryin'
To let you in the club
Yo, DJ cool to the rescue
We gon' break this joint down
Ayo a-huh, a-huh, ahh

If you pumpin' this one
In your truck
(Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty
(L-let's get dirty)
If you really don't
Give a what?
(L-let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty
(L-let's get dirty)
Everybody get your hands up
(L-let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty
(L-let's get dirty)
If you ain't come to party
Shut up
(L-let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty

Yo, security pattin'
My legs and waist
But if I vacate the place, it'll be
(Stay down)
All my niggaz in the huddle
On the count of three
We gonna bumrush The Tunnel
With a pound of weed
Cut the light on, you see
It's Brick City in here
Blazin' like Biggie passed us
A semi in here
Don't sleep, stay wide awoke
You dialed Doc, not dial-a-joke
Crawl or you'll die in smoke
I keep it heated when the hawk is out
Seated low Tahoe, beat it
When the dark is out
I'm outside of the line
And I'm actin' a fool
Like a three o'clock bully
Waitin' after school
(Punks) I've been in
This line for hours
I even killed the time by helpin'
My man pass out fliers
Now all I want to do is
Get in where I fit in
Shake my as* with the
Baddest pidgeon with her wig in
Jump, move, crash
Smoke, drink
Shake that as* stank
The fuck you think?
Poppa Bear at the table, and
The porridge is pourin'
Since +Def+ is the label
I belong in a morgue
I'm walkin' half-dead, actin' senile
With bigga niggaz from jail
Than the one on "Green Mile"
I'll huff and puff, blow the club down
I'll snuff a duck, I'm headed Uptown

Yeah that's right
We up in this joint now
Ayo we gettin' ready
To take over
Freddie, you grab the mic
I'ma grab the turntables
We gon' rock this joint baby
A-huh, a-huh, ah

If you got up in
The club free
(Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty
(Let's get dirty)
And you drunk up in the VIP
(Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty
(Let's get dirty)
If you swingin' from
Them club lights
(Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty
(Let's get dirty)
And you like to start
Them club fights
(Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty

Everybody wave
Your hands now
(Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty
(Let's get dirty)
Everybody jump up and down
(Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty
(Let's get dirty)
Everybody come to wild out
(Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty
(Let's get dirty)
If you a big dog no doubt
(Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty

Everybody wave
Your hands now
(Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty
(Let's get dirty)
Everybody jump up and down
(Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty
(Let's get dirty)
Everybody keep it goin' now
(Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty
(Let's get dirty)
Just a little bit louder now
(Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty c'mon, c'mon

(Let's get dirty)
A-huh, a-huh, ahh-huh
(Let's get dirty)
Keep it goin' now
(Let's get dirty)
