		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've been acting like you don't know I still love ya
You talk, and baby I feel myself slipping under
I've been drinking way too much to call you up
But baby just the thought of you
Has got me sat here wondering why I ever try to make do

I wanna stay up late
And hang on your every line
Think with your head, babe
'Cause I'm losing mine

If I lose you too
I'll break this whole thing down
If I lose you too
I don't think I'll get out
I tried to call your number
But you must be on the line
But if I lose you too
Then who am I?

I've been staring at nothing for a solid hour
Just thinking that maybe I never was supposed to be without her
I've been drinking way too much to call you up
But I was never good at rules
I could say a thousand words but I'd prefer to hold you

I wanna stay up late
And hang on your every line
And think with your head babe
'Cause I'm losing mine

If I lose you too
I'll break this whole thing down
If I lose you too
I don't think I'll get out
I tried to call your number
But you must be on the line
But if I lose you too
Then who am I?

If I lose you too
I'll break this whole thing down
If I lose you too
I don't think I'll get out
I tried to call your number
But you must be on the line
But if I lose you too
Then who am I?
