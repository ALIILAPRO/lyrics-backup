		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cold mama jamma shoulda put me in the slammer cause
I'm comin for the bands like in Carlos Santana
Tell me what you say you never say it to my face
I might catch another case let me throw it in the planner
I annihilated every pressure that I isolated
I been hated way before the dos and the donts
Violations AIN'T no time for waitin Imma gas until the tires faded put me on the track it's a go
 
Amazin
Never wanna see me out of patience
Black sheep money bag comin for the payment
Always want a hero but they never wanna praise it
Goal so close I can taste it
 
Imma beast
I can say that
Cash a check
Then it's payback
Imma beast
I believe it
Now you two stepping with a demon
 
Tell me what you want what you want
Imma hold it down for the block
Wait until you see me on top
It's a go now we goin non stop
 
Blame it on the way I was raised
Wanna throw dirt throw shade
I don't lose sleep I don't never get phased
See a real deal then I'm gone no trace
 
Who'd a thought I'd take it to the limit
Swimming in the water so dark had me trippin
If I'm playin' then I'm playin' for keeps
We can take it to the house or we can stay in the streets
 
Imma beast
I can say that
Cash a check
Then it's payback
Imma beast
I believe it
Now you two stepping with a demon
