		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I like it when you cry
It makes know you
It makes see you

I hate it when you lie
Just to feel strong
Oh it’s so boring

Tears roll to your lips
Freckles look like pebbles on the stream
Licking up the creek
Licking up the creek

Tears roll down your face
Freckles look like taro bubble tea
Tapioca cheeks tapioca cheeks

Tears roll to your lips
Freckles look like pebbles on the stream
Licking up the creek
Licking up the creek

Tears roll down your face
Freckles look like taro bubble tea
(‘Cos I’m scared too)

Everything everything you say
Makes me love you more
Makes me love you more
‘Cos I’m scared too

Everything everything that makes you scared
Makes me love you more
Makes me love you more
‘Cos I’m scared too

I love it that you’re shy
It makes me trust you
I think you’re so cute

It means a lot that you try
When I can’t take it
You take it on and stop it

Everything that makes me love you more
Everything that makes you scared makes me love you more
‘Cos I’m scared too

Everything that makes me love you more
Everything that makes you scared makes me love you more
‘Cos I’m scared too

Everything everything you say
Makes me love you more
Makes me love you more
‘Cos I’m scared too

Everything everything that makes you scared
Makes me love you more
Makes me love you more
‘Cos I’m scared too

Everything everything
Everything everything
‘Cos I’m scared too

Everything everything
Everything everything
‘Cos I’m scared too
