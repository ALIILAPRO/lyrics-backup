		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Black and red in my head
There's something wrong with you
Twist of fate, born to wait
So waiting's all we do

Welcome back, red and black
There's something wrong with me
I let you in, you broke the skin
Something came alive

Hang on
'Cause it's a long way down
I'll be right behind you

Laying down, I'm settled down
Settle down with me
I know out there, there's nothing for you

Hang on
'Cause it's a long way down
I'll be right behind you
You know I will

Well, hang on tight
'Cause it's a long way down
I'll be right behind you
