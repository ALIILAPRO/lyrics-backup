		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Forever I'll enjoy you undertaking
Come to see you every day now if I can
Is it not the time for everybody?
I still wake on the fields of regret

There is something to this dream we're all involved in
Can I see it, can I say it may exist
Why then don't the night show really matters
If we dwell in the fields of regret

What horror must invade the mind
When the approaching judge shall find
What sinful deeds from all mankind

With death and nature in surprise
Behold the wretched sinners rise
To meet the judge's searching eyes

And when the doomed no more can flee
From the flames of misery
Assist me while I die

Wander through those ever thoughts though if imagined
But come down on it's so easy to resist 
Rest me, hide my years upon the planet.
Sound another, no part over, won't forget
When we laugh at the fields of regret.
