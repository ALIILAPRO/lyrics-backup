		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It has been so long eating and drinking being merry
How strange how strange
Taking our Great Mongol ancestors names in vain
How strange how strange
Yet, would not honor our oath and destiny
How strange how strange
Why the valuable ethics of ancestors become worthless?
How strange how strange

Hey you traitor! Kneel down!
Hey, Prophecies be declared!

You've born in ancestor's fate yet sleeping deeply, can't be awakened
How strange how strange
Blindly declaring that only Mongols are the best
How strange how strange
Born to live as nobles yet, can't unite as one
How strange how strange
Why is it difficult to rise our nation up?
How strange how strange

Hey you traitor! Kneel down!
Hey, prophecies be declared!

Why it's so hard to cherish the ancestors' inherited land?
How strange how strange
Why priceless edification of elders turning to ashes?
How strange how strange
With the future of eternal prosperity, the wolf totem Mongols have the blessings of Heaven
Born with undeniable fate to gather nations, the Lord Chinggis declares his name on earth

Oh Black Banner be awakened, be awakened
Oh the Khanate rise and rise forever
Oh Black Banner be awakened, be awakened
