		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's do it
Let's do it
Oh
Let's do it
Baby
Take your time 
Let's do it
Come on, Baby
Oh
Let's do it
Baby
Take your time
Let's do it

You know you ought to slow down
You been working too hard 
And that's a fact
Sit back and relax a while
Take some time to laugh and smile
Lay your heavy load down
So we can stop and kick back
It seems we never take the time to do
All the things we want to, yeah

Now, Baby we can do it
Take the time 
Do it right
We can do it, baby 
Do it tonight

Baby, we can do it
Take the time 
Do it right
We can do it, baby 
Do it tonight

The love I feel for you
You feel for me
One life is all we have to live
Our love is all we have to give, yeah
There are so many things
For us to do and see
Let's take some time to be alone
Lock the door 
Pull out the phone, yeah

And baby we can do it
Take the time 
Do it right
We can do it, baby 
Do it tonight

Baby, we can do it
Take the time 
Do it right
We can do it, baby 
Do it tonight 

Baby we can do it
Take the time 
Do it right
We can do it, baby 
Do it tonight

Baby, we can do it
Take the time 
Do it right
We can do it, baby 
Do it tonight

Take your time
Take the time 
Take the time
