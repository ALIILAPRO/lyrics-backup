		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Should've known that this life it could never last
Now it's killing me watching you slipping through my hands
Let you into my heart it was way too fast
All these memories haunting me that I can't get past

Like that first night in my car that you kissed me
Dropped you off and you said that you'd miss me
Wish I could've known
'Cause I

I could hear it in the silence
Won't you show me where your heart is my love
I'm scared of letting go
I don't wanna know
Don't tell me we're better off alone

Would you lie and say forever
For another night together my love
And keep your body close
I don't wanna know
Don't tell me we're better off alone

Promise me that tonight you already show
That you've packed your bags and you've already let me go
Please don't say I'll be happier on my own
'Cause in your arms it will always feel like home

Like that
First night in my car that you kissed me
Dropped you off and you said that you'd miss me
Wish I could've known
'Cause I

I could hear it in the silence
Won't you show me where your heart is my love
I'm scared of letting go
I don't wanna know
Don't tell me we're better off alone

Would you lie and say forever
For another night together my love
And keep your body close
I don't wanna know
Don't tell me we're better off alone
We're better off alone, mm

I can hear it in the silence
Won't you show me where your heart is my love
I'm scared of letting go
I don't wanna know
Don't tell me we're better off alone

Would you lie and say forever
For another night together my love
And keep your body close
I don't wanna know
Don't tell me we're better off alone
Oh, I'm better off alone

Don't tell me we're better off alone
