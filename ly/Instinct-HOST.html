		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's nothing you can do
The sea is calling, it's calling just for you
There's nothing left to prove
Your spirit's falling with nothing left to choose

For the instinct
For the danger
For the pain inside
For the instinct
For the danger
For the pain divides

To understand
Never break it down
To understand
Never break it down
To understand
Never break it down
To understand
Never break it down

Eternity to fear
A theory's warning, it never disappears
An urgency draws near
The dream I trusted, it never reappeared
They're calling
Never wanted on the other side

For the instinct
For the danger
For the pain inside
For the instinct
For the danger
For the pain divides
We're falling

To understand
Never break it down
To understand
Never break it down
To understand
Never break it down
To understand
Never break it down
