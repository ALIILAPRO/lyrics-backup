		  She said fuck these niggas, pay up
She said fuck these niggas, pay up
(Uno, I killed it)

What that money say? Pay up
I ain't in the NBA, I can't lay up
Make her sign this NDA, she can't say much
Bitch, I'm on this codeine, I can't stay up
I drop a opp and it give me a rush

I'm in the A with some snow on the bluff (dig)
They said they be toting them K's but we be calling they bluff (dig)
On that X, I'm playing charades, I don't be talking too much (shh, ah)
Niggas still out pump faking, ain't smoking on Runtz
I put that ho, it be poundin' the blunt (okay)

Told me she can't come 'cause it's that time of the month (okay)
I just spent like thirty K on a Goyard trunk (okay)
I'm the X-man, I do my own stunt (okay)
She wanna come kick shit with us like we don't punt (okay)

I'm in the trap getting Gucci
The wetter my diamonds, the wetter her coochie
Spent thirty five hundred on brand new booty
She give me that head like salute me
Treat me like bubble gum, baby, come chew me
Nigga get smoked like a blunt and a loose leaf
Hey, what's your name? I'm clueless
My Cinderella is shoeless

Fuck these niggas, pay up
I ain't in the NBA, I can't lay up
Make her sign this NDA, she can't say much
Bitch, I'm on this codeine, I can't stay up
I drop a opp and it give me a rush

Huh, huh, huh (hey) huh, huh
Better know your place, better know your place
Better learn your place (pay up)
Yeah, these niggas burnt out they laces
Rest in peace, my shoelaces, they shoelaces
Gotta keep it P, I'm going places
Fuck her to the bone, she gon' make them funny faces
I'm bad to the bone
I'll still fuck a bitch in Rag N Bone (okay)
She said, "Ooh, you smell like Baccarat cologne" (okay)
They say, "He dissed me in a song but I don't know him" (okay, dig?)

What that money say? Pay up
I ain't in the NBA, I can't lay up
Make her sign this NDA, she can't say much
Bitch, I'm on this codeine, I can't stay up
I drop an opp and it give me a rush (okay)

Told me she can't come 'cause it's that time of the month (okay)
I just spent like thirty K on a Goyard trunk (okay)
I'm the X-man, I do my own stunt (okay)
She wanna come kick shit with us like we don't punt (okay)

Hey, huh
Hey, huh
Hey
