		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well it's a dog eat dog
Eat cat too
The French eat frog
And I eat you
Businessman, when you make a deal
Do you know who you can trust
Do you sign your life away
Do you write your name in dust

Hey, hey, hey
Every dog has his day
It's a dog eat dog
Dog eat dog

Dog eat dog
Read the news
Someone win
Someone lose
Up's above and down's below
And limbo's in between
Up you win, down you lose
It's anybody's game

Hey, hey, hey
Every dog has his day
It's a dog eat dog
Dog eat dog

And it's a eye for eye
Tooth for tooth
It's a lie
That's the truth
See a blind man on the street
Looking for something free
Hear the kind man ask his friends
Hey, what's in it for me

Hey, hey, hey
Every dog has his day
It's a dog eat dog
Dog eat dog

Dog eat dog
Dog eat dog
Dog eat dog
Dog eat dog
Dog eat dog
Dog eat dog
Dog eat dog
Dog eat dog
Dog eat dog
Dog eat dog
Dog eat dog
Dog eat dog
Dog eat dog
