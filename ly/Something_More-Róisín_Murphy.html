		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want something more
I want something more
I want something more
I want something more
I want something more
I want something more
I want something more
I want something more
I want something more

Gimme something, gimme something
Gimme something, gimme something
Gimme something, gimme something
Gimme something, gimme something
Gimme something, gimme something
Gimme something, gimme something
Gimme something, gimme something

A crown upon my head
Ten lovers in my bed
But I want something more
A billion in the bank
Titles of higher rank
But I want something more

A castle deep in Spain
More land than Charlemagne
And boys who ease the pain
An island out at sea
A house of luxury
And it's all named after me

Maybe this could be the last time
I feel the strain
Of what it's like to want everyone
And everything
Maybe this could be the last time
I feel the strain
Is what it is to want everyone
And everything

Life just keeps me wanting (wanting, wanting)
Life just keeps me wanting (wanting, wanting)

A crown upon my head
Young lovers in my bed
But I want something more
A private restaurant
Serving every dish I want but
I want something more

Maybe this could be the last time
I feel the strain
Of what it's like to want everyone
And everything
Maybe this could be the last time
I feel the strain
Of what it is to want everyone
And everything

I want it all, yes, all the cake
I live my life with no regret
I put it all at stake
And if it all goes up in flames
I will only ever have myself to blame
I want it all, yes, all the cake
I live my life the way I want
I own my mistakes
And if it all goes up in flames
I will only ever have myself to blame

Myself to blame, oh
Gotta give me something more
I want something more
I want it, I want it, I want it, something more
I want something more
I needed something more
I want something more
I wanted something more
Gimme something more (I want something more)
Give me something, give me something more
Give me something more (I want something more)
Give me something more

Give me something, give me something
Give me something, give me something
Give me something, give me something
Give me something, give me something
Give me something, give me something
Give me something, give me something
Give me something, give me something
Give me something, give me something
Give me something, give me something
Give me something, give me something
Give me something, give me something
