		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is where I wanna be (You’re all I need)
So wrapped up in you and me (Hold me baby)
This is where I wanna be
So wrapped up in you and me

(Don’t make me wait, so close I can taste it)
(Don’t make me wait, so close I can taste it)

I was up in the clouds up in
The stars nowhere to be found
Somewhere near Mars
Keep to myself, bleakness and hardship
Light in my soul, see through the darkness
They say "home’s not place
Home’s where heart is"
Open the gates, storming the starship
Hold onto your faith, horrid or sparklin
Form is a state formless I’m art

On point like a bullet shot from a Marksman
Marshmen Shaman tryna help balance
My Arch it’s
Cold in my heart it feel like the Arctic this
Life is movie know where your mark is

Know some niggas that’s killers
And like start shit
I’m the type that just chill, roll up
And spark shit
Live from the field, live from the starkness
I gotta feeling time never starts here

This is where I wanna be (You’re all I need)
So wrapped up in you and me (Hold me baby)
This is where I wanna be
So wrapped up in you and me

(Don’t make me wait, so close I can taste it)
(Don’t make me wait, so close I can taste it)

Floating in a hypnagogic state
Lost in the cosmos
I blank it’s just me and you our whole
World could change if we see it
Through my old world’s insane
I just need a few
If love had a color we’re deep in it’s hue
Whatever you’re looking for
I’m seeking it too threads hit the floor
The sheets hit the roof
Being alone isn’t the same
Since being with you fanning the flames
Smoking exotic cannabis strains
Your head on my heart, your hand on my chains
Young paradox grand but refrained no games
I’m the air in between the sand and the rain
I hover over all of them i
Don’t stand in a lane
Wavy Chester Watson, hard to slander the name
I can tell you that i’m feeling you
Tell me you feel the same "

This is where I wanna be (You’re all I need)
So wrapped up in you and me (Hold me baby)
This is where I wanna be
So wrapped up in you and me

(Don’t make me wait, so close I can taste it)
(Don’t make me wait, so close I can taste it)
