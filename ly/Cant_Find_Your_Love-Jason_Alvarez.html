		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've, been searching for your love
But I still can't find it, I still can't find it
I've, been searching for your love
But I still can't find it, I still can't find it
I've, been searching for your love
But I still can't find it, I still can't find it
I've, been searching for your love
But I still can't find it, I still can't find it
Blonde hair, skinny body
You were always shining
Every time I looked at you I was blinded
But now I'm just tryin' to find ya
Can't find you anywhere
Been searching for you everywhere
Love letters and sharing music together
You'll never
Have the same connection with another
The way we did
I've, been searching for your love
But I still can't find it, I still can't find it
I've, been searching for your love
But I still can't find it, I still can't find it
I've, been searching for your love
But I still can't find it, I still can't find it
I've, been searching for your love
But I still can't find it, I still can't find it
