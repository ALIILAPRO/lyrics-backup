		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All this is mine (all this is mine)
I realise (I realise)
Such a perfect (such a perfect)
Simulation (simulation)
I see your face (I see your face)
All over the place (all over the place)
Pixelation (pixelation)
A lonely allusion (a lonely allusion)
A heartfelt fantasy (a heartfelt fantasy)
A pure creation (a pure creation)
Not so far (not so far)
Beyond (beyond)
My wildest dreams (my wildest dreams)

This is the simulation
This is the simulation
This is the simulation
This is for demonstration
This is the simulation
This is the simulation
This is the simulation
This is for demonstration

This is the simulation
This is for demonstration
This is the lonely illusion
This is my only delusion
This is the simulation
This is for demonstration
This is the lonely illusion
This is my only delusion

If this is a limitation
Your love is a symbol of faith
Is that such a terrible thing
If this is a limitation
Your love is a symbol of faith

This is the simulation
This is the simulation
This is the realm of my wildest dreams
These are my wildest dreams
This is the simulation
This is the simulation
This is the realm of my wildest dreams
These are my wildest dreams

If you follow my face
It's all in my mind
You don't get let it slide
You don't get let it slide
You don't get let it slide
You don't get let it slide
You don't get let it slide

This is the simulation
This is the simulation
This is the simulation
This is for demonstration
This is the simulation
This is the simulation
This is the simulation
This is for demonstration
