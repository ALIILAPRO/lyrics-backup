		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh
Look
I want and she want
But we can't, huh

Look, huh
I want, huh, and she want, huh
But we can't, huh, 'cause we know
It was murder she wrote, huh
Look, she sang a song to your soul
That chopper blow like a nose
I told 'em, "Leave me alone"
(Huh, I told 'em, "Leave me alone"

Look, uh
I put my heart inside an envelope and shipped it off, uh
Bitch, I'm cookin', you can't get the sauce
Sleepy pull up drippin', bet them bitches tryna lick it off, uh
Her body different, I might give it all
Perky got me trippin', I could ball, but not on this court, huh
I was down, ain't pick me up just like a missed call
She said, "I got problems," she gon' fix all, huh
You don't hold me down, I'ma get lost

Look, huh
I want, huh, and she want, huh
But we can't, huh, 'cause we know
It was murder she wrote, huh
Look, she sang a song to your soul
That chopper blow like a nose
I told 'em, "Leave me alone"
(Huh, I told 'em, "Leave me alone"
It was murder she wrote, huh
Sing a song to your soul)

Look, uh, it's like I never get no peace, huh
This anxiety make it hard for me to speak, huh
Fightin' demons, I know I barely even sleep, huh
Your dawgs pussy, they ain't barkin' up no trees, huh
Nobody understand, so I just talk to me, uh
I got problems, girl, I'm sorry if I leave, uh
It ain't my fault, I told you shit was hard for me, huh
Turn to the streets 'cause I ain't grow up properly, huh
Can't deal with love, I swear that shit just not for me, nah
I fuck with her, I let her roll my broccoli, huh
Half the people who said they love me lied to me, huh
Part of the reason I wear my heart up on my sleeve, huh

Look, huh
I want, huh, and she want, huh
But we can't, huh, 'cause we know
It was murder she wrote, huh
Look, she sang a song to your soul
That chopper blow like a nose
I told 'em, "Leave me alone"
(Huh, I told 'em, "Leave me alone"
It was murder she wrote, huh
Sing a song to your soul)
