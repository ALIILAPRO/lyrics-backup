		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it
I can't buy no beer

Well I'm standin' on a corner
With a bucket in my hand
I'm waitin' for a woman
That ain't got no man

'Cause my bucket's got a hole in it
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it
I can't buy no beer

Well, I went upon the mountain
I looked down in the sea
I seen the crabs and the fishes
Doin' the be-bop-bee

'Cause my bucket's got a hole in it
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it
I can't buy no beer

Well, there ain't no use
Of me workin' so hard
When I got a woman
In the boss man's yard

'Cause my bucket's got a hole in it
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it
I can't buy no beer

Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it
I can't buy no beer
