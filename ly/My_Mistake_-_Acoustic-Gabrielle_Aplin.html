		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got up late again today
And I'm scared of everything
I don't dare to dream
I guard a dark imagination
These hours waste away
A debt I'll never pay

I'm talking to the walls
But the walls keep caving in
They amplify my thoughts
I really want a conversation
But I let it slip away
A debt I'll never pay

Worry, worry, oh
It's funny how it changes
Well nothing really changes at all

Am I jaded?
Am I meant to feel this way?
I'm a loser, getting beat by my own game
But if I falter, well at least it was my mistake
Oh, at least it was my mistake
'Cause I choose to be this way
I'm a loser, and I self-deprecate
So when I falter, well at least it was my mistake

I saw my friend today
She tried to comfort me
But I turned her away
There's magic in this misery
So no matter what you say
I don't think I'll ever change

Worry, worry, oh
It's funny how it changes
Well nothing really changes at all

Am I jaded?
Am I meant to feel this way?
I'm a loser, getting beat by my own game
But if I falter, well at least it was my mistake
Well at least it was my mistake
'Cause I choose to be this way
I'm a loser, and I self-deprecate
So when I falter, well at least it was my mistake

And I don't really care about what anyone says
I don't give a damn about what anyone says
I don't want to think about anything
I don't want to think about anything
And I don't really care about what anyone says
I don't need opinions hanging over my head
I don't really care about anything
I don't really care
I don't really care at all

Am I jaded?
Am I meant to feel this way?
I'm a loser, getting beat by my own game
But if I falter, well at least it was my mistake
Well, at least it was my mistake
'Cause I choose to be this way
I'm a loser, and I self-deprecate
So when I falter, well at least it was my mistake

Well, at least it was my mistake
Well, at least it was my mistake
