		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanted to believe in love, it's hard
Glitter that I cry like falling stars
Take what's in my chest and leave your mark
You just wanna wear my rhinestone heart

Baby, you stole what's mine
Cut me open with a sequin knife
Now it's all dark inside
You don't care though
Showed up in silver and gold
Dancing around but everybody knows
That's all my shit that you stole
And now I'm hollow

I'm a fool for seeing the best in you
I should have stopped 'cause, darling, I always knew
You'd mess me up
The way that they always do
I'm out of luck
Got nothing else left to lose, yeah

I wanted to believe in love, it's hard
Glitter that I cry like falling stars
Take what's in my chest and leave your mark
You just wanna wear my rhinestone heart
My rhinestone heart
My rhinestone heart
My rhinestone heart
My rhinestone heart

Showing me off, heart on display
I'm just a piece in your collection of things
Ribbons of tears falling from my face
You never cared about me anyway

Break down all alone with the lights off
Can't paint it away with the makeup
Bad days on my best behavior, ah-ah-ah-ah

I wanted to believe in love, it's hard
Glitter that I cry like falling stars
Take what's in my chest and leave your mark
You just wanna wear my rhinestone heart
My rhinestone heart
My rhinestone heart
My rhinestone heart
You just wanna wear my rhinestone heart
