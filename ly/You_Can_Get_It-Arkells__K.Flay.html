		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me what you want and I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm not giving up come on we got nothing left to lose
I've been here from the start you know I'm not going anywhere
I don't give a fuck tell me what you want
You can get it

Tied up
Bad vibes, bad luck, been swinging like a boomerang
Dried up
All talk, no bite, now we're coming like a hurricane
Pull the curtain back
Everybody wants to get some
A surprise attack
You and me together coming at you like a hurricane

Tell me what you want right now (ooh)
Let everybody talk right now
So tell me what you want right now
You can get it

Tell me what you want and I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm not giving up come on we got nothing left to lose
I've been here from the start you know I'm not going anywhere
I don't give a fuck tell me what you want
You can get it

(Woo)
Hold up
Coming out of me, lightning bolt electricity
(Woo)
Blow up
It's tearing at the seams yeah I see it unraveling
Pulling back the curtain got the sun in my eyes
Everybody they been hurting but they push it aside
Every person is a person with a different disguise
Feels like I'm on a desert island and it's lord of the flies
Watch out for your neck
Wrecking ball is swinging heavy
This adrenaline
It's coming outta me, lightning bolt electricity

Tell me what you want right now, ooh
Let everybody talk right now
Tell me what you want right now
You can get it (yeah)
Well you can get it (yeah)
You can get it

Tell me what you want and I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm not giving up come on we got nothing left to lose
I've been here from the start you know I'm not going anywhere
I don't give a fuck tell me what you want
You can get it
(Woo)

I don't give a fuck tell me what you want
You can get it
You can get it
You can get it
Tell me what you want and I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm not giving up come on we got nothing left to lose
I've been here from the start you know I'm not going anywhere
I don't give a fuck tell me what you want
You can get it (woo)
You can get it
You can get it
I don't give a fuck tell me what you want
You can get it
