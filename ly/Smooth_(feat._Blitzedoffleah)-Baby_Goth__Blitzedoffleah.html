		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  See the hate all over you when you see me in the coupe
Got your whole rent on my shoes, see me rollin' with my jewels
My look always on fleek when you pass me on the street
The way your man look at me got my body feeling weak
Light, ooh, ooh, watch me in my whip, go vroom
All my car been new, new, ooh
All my ice is so smooth, ooh, ooh, ooh

Told that bitch go help me, the money got her antsy
She lick my wrist like candy, my wrist look like her panties
Give no fucks what you say, I smoke two ounces every day
Blue bills in the bank, and your bitch is screamin' my name
I am so brazy, I'm getting all the ladies
They call me crazy, your guy could never save me
Have you ever seen this much blue? Yeah, my diamonds leakin'
I could make your wish come true, I could be your genie

See the hate all over you when you see me in the coupe
Got your whole rent on my shoes, see me rollin' with my jewels
My look always on fleek when you pass me on the street
The way your man look at me got my body feeling weak
Light, ooh, ooh, watch me in my whip, go vroom
All my car been new, new, ooh
All my ice is so smooth, ooh, ooh, ooh

Sippin' on that pink, I got a bag and a bustdown
Leanin' with my troops and we cruisin' with the top down
We stay in our lane, you can look but you can't touch us
You can't catch up, you can't catch us
Tell me is it your birthday? Baby, got some cake right here for you
Make you sing my name when I put it down you
Big body, big blunt rollin', fuck up out my way
Don't even give a fuck 'bout what you gotta say

See the hate all over you when you see me in the coupe
Got your whole rent on my shoes, see me rollin' with my jewels
My look always on fleek when you pass me on the street
The way your man look at me got my body feeling weak
Light, ooh, ooh, watch me in my whip, go vroom
All my car been new, new, ooh
All my ice is so smooth, ooh, ooh, ooh
