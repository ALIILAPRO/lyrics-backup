		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You call me up and remain silent.
Your breathing's under control
I wouldn't trust a word you could say.
I feel alive when you're gone

And I don't know how to feel
I still have the same anger after all theses years
No I don't need to move on, I need to fix something
Don't come any closer stay the fuck away from me

I have to separate what I feel from what I know.
I Don't want to play this game,
I can't believe it's the world I've always known

Am i alive ?
I wouldn't give it another shot
Don't call me when you feel lost at night

You call me up and remain silent
Your breathing's under control
I wouldn't trust a word you could say
I feel alive when you're gone
I know you're thinking about the things we've left undone
Don't call me up to remain silent
I feel best when you're gone

This silence is killing you
But that's all I expect from you
I know your deepest lies
But you'll never get to know what's deep inside me

You never tried to walk in my shoes
Cause it all goes back to you
I have to break this endless silence
and stay away from you.

Every word you said was torture
But your silence is even worse

And you're not even close to knowing me
I can read it in your mind
Your heart is waiting somewhere and I lose a part of mine

You were the worst part of me
I can feel it down my spine
Something in me is crawling
Into the void you left inside.

Crawling in my mind
And I lose a part of mine
I can feel it down my spine
Somewhere deep inside

You call me up and remain silent.
My breathing's under control
I wouldn't trust a word you could say.
I feel alive when you're gone
I know you're thinking about the things we've left undone
Don't call me up to remain silent.
I feel best when you're gone
