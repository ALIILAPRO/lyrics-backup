		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah (Yeah)
I get a feeling that I never, never, never, never had before, no no (Yeah)
And I just wanna tell you right now that I
I believe, I really do believe that

Something's got a hold on me, yeah (oh, it must be love)
Oh, something's got a hold on me right now, child (oh, it must be love)
Let me tell you now
I've got a feeling, I feel so strange
Everything about me seems to have changed
Step by step, I got a brand new walk
I even sound sweeter when I talk

I said, oh (oh), oh (oh), oh (oh), oh (oh)
Hey, hey yeah
Oh, it must be love (you know it must be love)

Let me tell you know
Something's got a hold on me, yeah (oh, it must be love)
Oh, something's got a hold on me right now, child (oh, it must be love)

Let me tell you now
I've never felt like this before
Something's got a hold on me that won't let go
I believe I'd die if I only could
I feel so strange but it sure is good

I said, oh (oh), oh (oh), oh (oh), oh (oh)
Hey, hey yeah
Oh, it must be love (you know it must be love)

Let me tell you know
My heart feels heavy, my feet feel light
I shake all over, but I feel alright
I never felt like this before
Something's got a hold on me that won't let go
I never thought it could happen to me 
Got me heavy without the misery
I never thought it could be this way
Love's sure gonna put a hurting on me

I said, oh (oh), oh (oh), oh (oh), oh (oh)
Hey, hey yeah
Oh, it must be love (you know it must be love) 

Oh, you know he walks like love (you know he walks like love)
He talks like love (you know he talks like love)
Makes me feel alright (makes me feel alright)
In the middle of the night (in the middle of the night)

La la la la (la la la la)
La la la la (la la la la)
