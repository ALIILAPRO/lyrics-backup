		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Little blue finds me again
Creeps over my heart
Like a shadow on the hills
Little blue, you have me again
Breathless in the dark
Like trodden daffodils

Little blue
Reminds me of the love I had that's gone
Little blue
In you is where those memories live on
Don't leave too soon
Please keep me close to you
Little blue

There are softer days
With no trace of thunder storms
Just a quiet afterglow
And you're never far away
Still see the summer dawn
Kiss you peaceful on your pillow

Little blue
Reminds me of the love I had that's gone
Little blue
In you is where those memories live on
Don't leave too soon
Please keep me close to you
Little blue

And I hope you don't let go
I hope you don't let go
And I hope you don't let go
I hope you don't let go

Little blue sits deep in me
A painted souvenir
Tainted through the years
