		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Keep your apologies they don't mean nothing to me 
I'm done with pretending like I don't got somewhere to be, yeah
You wanted the moon and the stars and the whole galaxy
I gave you my heart and you gave it back missing a piece 

Now we're ooh so separated
And I'm losing all my patience
And you used to be 
Someone I hated
Now all I know, all that I know is 
I don't know you anymore

I can't tell you where we went wrong
Maybe it's not anyone's fault
All I know is
I don't know you anymore
Nothing even left to take back
Can't lose something you never had
All I know is
I don't know you anymore

We've gone too far
We fell too hard
You broke my heart (you broke my heart) 
Forget your face
'Cause it's too late to say you'll change
I don't know you anymore

You can't burn a bridge and then act like it's not a big deal (big deal, yeah yeah)
It's hard to find out the person you love wasn't real (wasn't real)
Now you gas light me with thunder and lightning
And I don't know how I should feel
'Cause you still haunt me (you still haunt me)
Yeah, you still haunt me (you still haunt me)

When we're ooh so separated
And I'm losing all my patience
And you used to be 
Someone I hated (someone I hated)
Now all I know, all that I know is 
I don't know you anymore

I can't tell you where we went wrong
Maybe it's not anyone's fault
All I know is
I don't know you anymore
Nothing even left to take back
Can't lose something you never had
All I know is
I don't know you anymore

We've gone too far
We fell too hard
You broke my heart (you broke my heart) 
Forget your face
'Cause it's too late to say you'll change
I don't know you anymore

I don't know you anymore
