		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a Judas priest song called uh, uh, "Turbo Lover" (okay)
Well I call this "Turbo Gravy", it's a spoof on that
And it's basically taking gravy to the next level
(Gravy Train)

Gravy on your bitch, no worries
Look at my wrist, snow flurries
Tryna get a feature better hurry
Your momma make a real nice curry
Now I'm cookin, now I'm fuckin' cookin'
Gravy in the kitchen now everybody lookin'
Just pass a boy a spatula
2018. You might see me on The Bachelor

I don't make songs bitch, Gravy make hymns
Lit with yo' bitch, got the Ronnie and the Gin
Drip from the whip, so you know I'm taking wins
Pillow fight with your bitch, shirts vs skins

I don't make songs bitch, Gravy make hymns
Lit with yo' bitch, got the Ronnie and the Gin
Drip from the whip, so you know I'm taking wins
Pillow fight with your bitch, shirts vs skins

Uh, your aunt like me 'cause I'm ticklish
Roll up to her crib and she give me all the licorice
I been a menace, yeah, I been a menace
Gravy all time most wanted by the dentist
Treat your main bitch like lettuce
Treat your main bitch like lettuce
I treat your main bitch like lettuce
Cover up the booty with the dressing
Might be ranch or might be Italian
Pull up to the party in the Maserati Stallion
Ooh baby, that's horsepower
Lather up your lady with the gravy in the shower
Smelling like flowers, flexing after hours (whoa)
Hit your bitch with the one man Eiffel Tower (holy shit)

And then add more gravy (wow)
Gravy to gravy, yes 
(Of course you need more gravy to make the gravy) Yes

I don't make songs bitch, Gravy make hymns
Lit with yo' bitch, got the Ronnie and the Gin
Drip from the whip, so you know I'm taking wins
Pillow fight with your bitch, shirts vs skins

I don't make songs bitch, Gravy make hymns
Lit with yo' bitch, got the Ronnie and the Gin
Drip from the whip, so you know I'm taking wins
Pillow fight with your bitch, shirts vs skins

Gravy get close and your bitch get excited
Face all delighted, looking like she tryna hide it
I been on the fruit smoothie cute booty diet
If I made a Gravy Train movie you would buy it
You would buy it
Everyone would cop it
Your girlfriend's name in my locket
Bad bitch with me on my rocket
And a lot of hundreds in my pocket
Too many racks in my pants
I'm just tryna walk, lookin like I'm tryna dance uh
Speaking Guapanese when I'm moving out in France
Gravy on the speakers now these thotties tryna prance

How about a mashed potato ice cream cone?
What do you think about that? (That, that's fun)
Alright, you put a little scoop of gravy,
It can be room temperature because your hand kind of warms it up (okay)
It's like a, a drum stick

I don't make songs bitch, Gravy make hymns
Lit with yo' bitch, got the Ronnie and the Gin
Drip from the whip, so you know I'm taking wins
Pillow fight with your bitch, shirts vs skins

I don't make songs bitch, Gravy make hymns
Lit with yo' bitch, got the Ronnie and the Gin
Drip from the whip, so you know I'm taking wins
Pillow fight with your bitch, shirts vs skins
