		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Meet the plastics, they just arrived! I'm ecstatic to be alive
It's my pleasure to ignore the lovely people at my door
Carbon copies, you always know when they are around
Instant replay, I'm never going to play again
Meet the plastics, out your window, causing trouble on TV
It's my pleasure to ignore the lovely people at my door

Carbon copies, you always know when they are around
Instant replay, I'm never going to play again
Meet the plastics, they're fantastic! They came to town and fooled around
It's my pleasure to ignore the lonely people at my door
Carbon copies, you always know when they're around
Instant replay, I'm never going to play again
