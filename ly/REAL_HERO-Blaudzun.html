		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  FUNNY HOW YOU FOOLED US ALL
BUT YOU LOOK MORE THAN READY
HATE WILL FAIL TO PULL YOU DOWN 
OR BRING YOU ON YOUR KNEES

ON FRIDAYS IN THE SINKING HOLE 
STILL YOU HOLD IT STEADY  
ON MONDAYS YOU EMBRACE THE SUN
SO GLORIOUSLY

CHORUS 
HONEY YOU'RE A REAL HERO
ONE MORE TIME BEFORE YOU GO
I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW
MY HERO
STRONGER THAN BEFORE THE FALL
HONEY YOU'RE A REAL HERO
I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW
MY HERO
A REAL HERO 

GET RID OF THE CITY DUST
NOW IS ALL THAT MATTERS 
I LOVE THE WAY YOU SPEAK IN TONGUES
SO GLORIOUSLY 
 
NOT HOW MANY YOU HAVE LOST
IT'S ONLY WINS THAT MATTER
SON WHAT'S GOOD IS GOOD ENOUGH
YOU WERE BORN TO BE FREE

CHORUS
HONEY YOU'RE A REAL HERO
ONE MORE TIME BEFORE YOU GO
I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW
MY HERO
STRONGER THAN BEFORE THE FALL
HONEY YOU'RE A REAL HERO
I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW
MY HERO
A REAL HERO
