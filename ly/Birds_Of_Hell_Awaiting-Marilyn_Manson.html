		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Birds of Hell awaiting
With the wings on fire
Insane old Phoenix, baby
It's your death desire
The birds of Hell awaiting
With the wings on fire
Insane old Phoenix, baby
It's your death desire

(This is your death, this is your death)
(This is your death's desire)
(This is your death, this is your death)
(This is your death's desire)
(This is your death, this is your death)
(This is your death's desire)

Birds of Hell awaiting
With the wings on fire
Insane old Phoenix, baby
It's your death desire
It's where you're death's desire
It's your death desire

(This is your death, this is your death)
(This is your death's desire)
(This is your death, this is your death)
(This is your death's desire)
(This is your death,)
(This is your death's desire)

Insane old Phoenix, baby
It's your death desire
Insane old Phoenix, baby
It's your death desire

The birds of Hell awaiting
With the wings on fire
Insane old Phoenix, baby
It's your death desire
Your death desire

The birds of Hell awaiting
With the wings on fire
Insane old Phoenix, baby
It's your death desire
Your death desire
(This is your death, this is your death)
(This is your death's desire)
(This is your death, this is your death)
(This is your death's desire)
