		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love you
But I can hate you at the same time
Wedding rings
We got 'em at the same time
I guess it's a honeymoon (what?)
I'm like "Damn honey, you fine"
You stay on the West end (west)
I guess you can call me sometime (hello?, click, click, click, hello?)
But I hate you at the same time
We got wedding rings (woah)
We got 'em at the same time
She onto better things (one)
Hello? Click, click, click (hello?)
Hello? Hello? Click, click (hello? Hello?)

Okay, let's go (let's go), play your role (play your role)
You movin' how I'm movin' if I say so
I might pull up on lil' baby, baby, take notes (take notes)
Rollin' through the ocean in a white boat (rollin', rollin')
Pull up and salute in the white ghost (ghost)
Standin' on the corner, yeah, the light post
(Nigga, don't be surprised)

Knowin' I'm pullin' up double R's back to back, them for my guys (baby, ride)
Beat it out the frame 'for I slide (out the frame)
She open my door, suicide (uh)
Keepin' in that chain 'fore it pop
Off the elevator, I'm lit today
I need a respirator, that cookie hit today
I smoke a thirty to the face, I feel like Juicy J (trippy, mane)
I hop in through the roof and feel like Pootie Tang

Okay, let's go (let's go), play your role (play your role)
You movin' how I'm movin' if I say so (say so)
I might pull up on lil' baby, baby, take notes (take notes)
Rollin' through the ocean in a white boat (rollin', rollin')
Pull up and salute in the white ghost (ghost)
Standin' on the corner, yeah, the light post
(Nigga, don't be surprised)

I'm a smooth talker
Glide when I walk, moonwalker
Hoppin' out that ghost, she go "Ooh, that brother"
She gon' come to me 'cause
She know Donny gonna do her proper
She wan' groove just how I move, no TikToker
New watch on her wrist, I just bought this bitch, that's how I clock 'em
Bought her a brand new fit, that shit compliment her hips and knockers
Don't get better than this, put her on a boat and then I rock her
And I'm lovin' how it shake, shake, shake, like maracas
Let's turn the lights down
Baby, its your turn
Why you waitin' on the sun?
Don't worry, baby, you're mine
Promise if you do it my way, you'll be celebratin' at the finish line
She said "Okay, fine"

Okay, let's go, play your role
You movin' how I'm movin' if I say so
I might pull up on lil' baby, baby, take notes
Rollin' through the ocean in a white boat (rollin', rollin')
Pull up and salute in the white ghost
Standin' on the corner, yeah, the light post
