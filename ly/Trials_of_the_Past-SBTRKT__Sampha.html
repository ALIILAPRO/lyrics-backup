		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So young so how were you to know know know
You're a carrier a carrier of the light inside of you
Glows green in the pitch black night night night
Can't tell anyone anyone it's hurting you
So hold it in cover up, pull up your sheets your sheets
What to be, down cruising in the ocean, and sin it's due
So I got to sit up, sit up up up
For my heart to come down down down down down
So I got to sit up, up up up up
For my heart to come down down down down down

The ghoulish entities they come floating through the walls
Ghostly enemies they come floating through you door
And the ghoulish entities they come floating through the wall
From the past from the past and they're somewhere right before you like The
Ghost of Christmas Past

I was always floating around the city
Go with the flow without ever knowing where I wanna be
So I got into crazy situations
A loyal soldier who acts who acts who acts. But never asks
Why am I flying on my back, my back?
With the moon looking down down down down down
Where's my band? Where's anything at all all?
And why's the ceiling going black black black black black?

The ghoulish entities they come floating through the walls
Ghostly enemies they come floating through you door
And the ghoulish entities they come floating through the wall
From the past from the past and they're somewhere right before you like The
Ghost of Christmas Past

Now, there's not anything's coming unless you go
And you can't break the chasing ghosts ghosts ghosts
So much so when they come back but never ask
At your side, at your soul
When they come back but never ask

The ghoulish entities they come floating through the walls
Ghostly enemies they come floating through you door
And the ghoulish entities they come floating through the wall
From the past from the past and they're somewhere right before you like The
Ghost of Christmas Past
