		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just when they thought you were through
You've burned their lies
Now you're strengthened, it's true
Turn your backs on your enemies
And let those motherfuckers rot in their jealousy

They
Can't stand
That the world's up for taking and we are adamant
Hell bent
Determined to dominate everything

We are the fire
We are the fire
Resound the anthem
We are the fire

The music connects, unites us more
Our masses strengthen
An unstoppable horde
We're all now a family
Together let's show the world what we say

They
Can't stand
That the world's up for taking and we are adamant
Hell bent
Determined to dominate everything

Turn your backs on your enemies
And let those motherfuckers rot in their jealousy
We're all now a family
Together let's show the world what we say

We are the fire
We are the fire
Resound the anthem
We are the fire
We are the fire
Resound the anthem
We are the fire
Fire!

Whoa-whoa 
(Whoa-whoa)
Whoa-whoa 
(Whoa-whoa)
Whoa-whoa 
(Whoa-whoa)
Whoa-whoa 
(Whoa-whoa)
Yeah-yeah 
(Yeah-yeah)
Yeah-yeah 
(Yeah)

We are the fire
We are the fire
Resound the anthem
We are the fire
We are the fire
Resound the anthem
We are the fire
We are the fire
Resound the anthem
We are the fire
We are the fire
Resound the anthem
We are the fire
