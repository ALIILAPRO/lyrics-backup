		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I guess what hurt me most of all
You were playing with my heart
Tell me, why am I emotional
When I knew it from the start?

And tell me
Why does my heart burn when I see your face?
You have made your decision
Put me in my place
And the lies you've been hiding
Taking up your space
Tell me, why does my heart burn this way
When I see your face? When I see your face?

All this time you left me wanting more
Had me swallowing all of my pride
Wonder where this part of you came from
It was hidden in the shallow of your eyes

And tell me
Why does my heart burn when I see your face?
You have made your decision
Put me in my place
And the lies you've been hiding
Taking up your space
Tell me, why does my heart burn this way
When I see your face? When I see your face?

Lover, why you been hiding
From the places we've been? From
The places we've been?
Lover, why you been hiding
From the places we've been? From
The places we've been?
Lover, why you been hiding
From the places we've been? From
The places we've been?
Lover, why you been hiding
From the places we've been? From
The places we've been?

And tell me
Why does my heart burn when I see your face?
You have made your decision
Put me in my place
And the lies you've been hiding
Taking up your space
Tell me, why does my heart burn this way
When I see your face?

يحرق قلبي يحرق قلبي
يحرق قلبي
