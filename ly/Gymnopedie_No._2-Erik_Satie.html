		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna build those castles in the sand
Like hen I was a child 
I wanna build those castles in the sand 
Like when I was a child 

Uh uh uh 
Uh uh uh
Uh uh uh
Uh uh uh
Uh uh uh

I wanna leave 
My footprints on this earth
'Cause that's where I belong 
I'd rather be the heartbeat than the thirst
'Cause this is our song 

Ain't no way, you can go wrong 
You and me like our favorite song 
Ain't no way, you can't go wrong 
You and me like our favorite song, yeah

Uh uh uh 
Uh uh uh
Uh uh uh
Uh uh uh
Uh uh uh it can't go wrong 

Ain't no way 
We can go wrong 
Ain't no way 
And we'll be forever young
We'll be forever young
