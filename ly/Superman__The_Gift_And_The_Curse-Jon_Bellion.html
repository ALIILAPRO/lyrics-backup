		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cocaine like the kid was born in '84
How long you really plan to sleep on me for?
When I decide to put my cape on the floor
Superman won't save you no more

Your favorite rapper's be taking beats
That I'm shittin' up
Your favorite lyricist's tell me that
I don't spit enough
Ten steps ahead of you musically
How you plan to stop me?
Just count your blessings that I
Consider rap a fucking hobby!

Cocaine like the kid was born in '84
How long you really plan to sleep on me for?
When I decide to put my cape on the floor
Superman won't save you no more

Superman won't save you no more
Superman won't save you no more
Superman won't save you no more
Superman won't save you no more, more, more

Imagine locking the tone of Sarah McLachlan
The fashion of Jimi Hendrix in a
Box with the bible's doctrine
I look for potential wives
She looking for famous Johnson
She hungry for the action
In New York we call that Bronson

Cocaine like the kid was born in '84
How long you really plan to sleep on me for?
When I decide to put my cape on the floor
Superman won't save you no more

Superman won't save you no more
Superman won't save you no more
Superman won't save you no more
Superman won't save you no more, more, more

Cocaine like the kid was born in '84
How long you really plan to sleep on me for?
When I decide to put my cape on the floor
Superman won't save you no more

Superman won't save you no more
Superman won't save you no more
Superman won't save you no more
Superman won't save you no more, more

She literally told me:
"You're too much of a genius
You're gonna be too famous"
She literally left me
Tell me that shit ain't a gift and a curse
She literally told me:
"You're too much of a genius
You're gonna be too famous"
She literally left me
Tell me that shit ain't a gift and a curse

Tell me that shit ain't a gift and a curse
Tell me that shit ain't a gift and a curse
Tell me that shit ain't a gift and a curse
Tell me that shit ain't a gift and a curse
Tell me that shit ain't a gift and a curse
