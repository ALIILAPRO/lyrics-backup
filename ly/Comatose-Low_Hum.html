		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's getting later
I'm getting colder
My head keeps spinning and I can't get high
I thought I told you
Never getting older
Dreaming 'til I wake up and die
I wanna take it slower but I'm going nowhere
Numbness never felt so right
It keeps changing so fast how do I make this feeling last
The truth is I won't ever know why
Why
Why
Why

It's getting hotter
Comatose seems smarter
At least that's what I keep telling myself
These clouds they roll in
Tryna keep my skin thin
Freezing never felt so right
It's easy to be who you never want to be
Locked up inside your own life
Just like I told you never getting older
Dreaming 'til I wake up and die

Why
Why
Why

Why
Why
Why
