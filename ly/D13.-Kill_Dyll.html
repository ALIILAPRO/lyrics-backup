		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Came back just to kill and commit war crimes
Fuckers try to cut me they don't know my ties
I don't wanna battle
Wanna bleed of him of his life
If you step on my toes I'll gut you with my knife

Oh these fuckers obsessed
Oh these fuckers obsessed
They want all of my blood and won't settle for less
Rip his heart through his chest
Rip his heart through his

Blood on your hands
10 bullets to your face
Fuck you and your friends
Imma leave em all to rest
Stomp out his head
And treat him like a pest
Imma take 20 bullets
Then cave out his chest

Anyone's villainous
Bring em down to my level
Is bringing down to the devil
Never surrounded by gentle ass mother fuckers
Are ducking just to get hit by the dozen
Growin up hated by others
I never needed what wasn't already
Cut up unloved and
I'm just a shell with a spirit
Always been cussin and fearing that I'm the reason I'm bleeding
Always been fucked up believing that I could see more in people
Now I'm just stuck with these problems with no one else that can solve em
And if you see me still coughin its cuz I been in withdrawal since all of these thoughts in My consciousness getting Tangled by offerings that been made by the devil somebody Get me a shovel, I'm tryna bury my struggles in 20 tons Worth of gravel

What

20 ties to unravel
Turning life to a battle
I'll fucking step on your neck
If it can get me a paddle
And make it back to a fragile castle
Ruled by a broken master
I'm coping with rope and laughter
I'm hoping for more disaster

Blood
Do it all for the blood
Do it all for the pain
I'm offin' my love
I'm going insane
I'm going insane

I was trained just to kill
I was trained just to die
I was trained not to feel
I was trained not to cry

I was trained just to kill
I was trained just to die
I was trained not to feel
I was trained not to cry

I was trained just to kill
I was trained just to die
I was trained not to feel
I was trained not to cry

Blood on your hands
10 bullets to your face
Fuck you and your friends
Imma leave em all to rest

Stomp out his head and treat him like a pest
Imma take 20 bullets then cave out his chest
