		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why do you care what people think?
Are you hooked up to their leash?
You know anklebiters
Ate up your personality

Try to remember how it felt
To just make up your own steps
And let anklebiters
Chew up, spit out someone else

And fall in love with yourself

Because someday you're gonna be
The only one you've got
Someday you're gonna be
The only one you've got

Why you wanna please the world
And leave yourself to drop dead?
Someday you're gonna be
The only one you've got

What do you actually expect?
A broken mirror to reflect?
You know, anklebiters
Gave you a false perception

And why do I defend (c'mon, c'mon)
Your ignorance?
Oh, why do I defend (c'mon, c'mon)
The state you're in?

You should fall in love with yourself
Oh, again
Fall in love with yourself

Because someday you're gonna be
The only one you've got
Someday you're gonna be
The only one you've got

Why you wanna please the world
And leave yourself to drop dead?
Someday you're gonna be
The only one you've got

Anklebiters
Anklebiters
Someday you're gonna be alone
Anklebiters
Anklebiters
