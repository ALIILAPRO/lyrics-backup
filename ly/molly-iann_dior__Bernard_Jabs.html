		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mic check, one, two, ay, ay
Mic check, one, two, ay, ay, ay

Me and shawty on the highway going back to my place
Beamer in the driveway, park it in the driveway
Cuban like my chain, going to a high stage
She gon' come to my place
Do whatever I say

Ay, got a lil' shawty (got a lil' shawty)
She off of Molly, she in love with the drugs
Wanna fuck when I'm done, kick her out no time for fun
If you talking, show me what's up, got lil' Tecca with the drum
Now you quiet, how it's 'sposed to be, little nigga, you look dumb
Ay, yeah, I been in any bitch in my space
Why'd he got that shit? He gotta ship it back cross-state
When I fuck a shawty, she can never stay in my place
I can't ever fuck 'cause I don't know when I'm alone, like

She be on the cover, I can't let it show (I can't let it show)
Shawty love the Travis shit, she cook and sell the dough (she sell the dough)
If you ever got issues, you can let me know (you can let me know)
He said he got it coming through, I need 'bout three of those (I need 'bout three of those)
I need 'bout three of those (I need 'bout three of those)
I need 'bout three or more (I need 'bout three or more)
Don't really need a bitch, ain't no problem to let her go (let her go)
But if you fuck somebody else, you gotta let me know (you gotta let me know)
I really want you to myself but got to let you go, let me know

Me and shawty on the highway going back to my place
Beamer in the driveway, park it in the driveway
Cuban like my chain, going to a high stage
She gon' come to my place
Do whatever I say

Ay, got a little shawty (got a little shawty)
She off of Molly
She in love with the drugs
Wanna fuck when I'm done, kick her out no time for fun
If you talking, show me what's up, got lil' Tecca with the drum
Now you quiet, how it's 'sposed to be, little nigga, you look dumb
Ay, yeah
I been in any bitch in my space
Why'd he got that shit? He gotta ship it back cross-state
When I fuck a shawty, she can never stay in my place
I can't ever fuck 'cause I don't know when I'm alone, like

No, won't lose (won't lose)
Tryna play the part but I won't let you though
Not heroic, I can't save these hoes, but damn she flexible
So I bend her like a pretzel
Bend it over, touch your toes
Say my name real loud so your neighbors know I'm home (let's go!)
That little bitch insane
Coming 'round tryna pick my brain
But I can't let her though
She thinks she a clever hoe
Now her boyfriend know
She turned to a lonely hoe
All her friends know
Hit my line, we're next door

Me and shawty on the highway going back to my place
Beamer in the driveway, park it in the driveway (woah)
Cuban like my chain, going to a high stage
She gon' come to my place
Do whatever I say (woah)

Ay, got a little shawty (got a little shawty)
She off of Molly
She in love with the drugs
Wanna fuck when I'm done, kick her out no time for fun
If you talking, show me what's up, got lil' Tecca with the drum
Now you quiet, how it's 'sposed to be, little nigga, you look dumb
Ay, yeah
I been in any bitch in my space
Why'd he got that shit? He gotta ship it back cross-state
When I fuck a shawty, she can never stay in my place
I can't ever fuck 'cause I don't know when I'm alone, like, ay
