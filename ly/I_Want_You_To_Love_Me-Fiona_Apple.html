		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've waited many years
Every print I left upon the track
Has led me here
And next year it'll be clear
This was only leading me to that
And by that time
I hope that 

You
Love me
You
Love me

I move with the trees
In the breeze
I know that time is elastic
And I know when I go
All my particles disband and disperse
And I'll be back in the pulse
And I know none of this'll matter 
In the long run
But I know a sound is still a sound
Around no-one
And while I'm in this body
I want somebody to want
And I want what I want
And I want

You
To love me
You

And I know that you do
In the dark
I know that you do
And I know that you know
That you got the protector to pick me up
And I want you to use it
Blast the music
Bang it, bite it, bruise it
Whenever you want to begin, begin
We don't have to go back to where we been
I am the woman who wants you to win
And I've been waiting
Waiting for 

You
To love me
You
You
