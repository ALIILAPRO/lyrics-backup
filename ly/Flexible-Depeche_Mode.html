		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fame can have a strange effect
Money can have a strange effect

I ask myself, "is it a sin?"
To be flexible when the boat comes in
Open the window and out go ideals (woo, woo)

Drink can alter you
Girls can have a strange effect, too

I ask myself, "Is it a sin?"
To be flexible when the boat comes in
Open the window and out go ideals (woo, woo)

We all know boats don't last
We all know cars are fast

I ask myself, "Is it a sin?"
To be flexible when the boat comes in
Open the window and out go ideals (woo, woo)

I ask myself, "Is it a sin?"
To be flexible when the boat comes in
Open the window and out go ideals (woo, woo)
I ask myself, "Is it a sin?"
To be flexible when the boat comes in
Open the window and out go ideals (woo, woo)

I ask myself, "Is it a sin?"
To be flexible when the boat comes in
