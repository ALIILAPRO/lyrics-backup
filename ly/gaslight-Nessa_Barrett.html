		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Caught in a lie
I can tell by the look in your eyes
Why'd you say that there's nothing to hide
When you look so guilty, baby?
Holding my breath
'Cause I swear I could love you to death
When we kiss your shoulders are tense
Yeah, you look so guilty, baby

I should've known
But I went through your phone anyways
I should've known
Love's a dangerous game

Why am I jealous if I'm yours?
Why do you make me insecure?
Why do you tell me not to worry
When you always fucking hurt me?
Why am I jealous if you're mine?
Why am I not even your type?
Why do you tell me that I'm crazy?
Gaslight
I'm not crazy if I'm right

You talk in your sleep
Telling me all the secrets you keep
But if I was a girl in your dreams
Would you still look guilty, baby?

I should've known
But I went through your phone anyways
I should've known
Love's a dangerous game

Why am I jealous if I'm yours?
Why do you make me insecure?
Why do you tell me not to worry
When you always fucking hurt me?
Why am I jealous if you're mine?
Why am I not even your type?
Why do you tell me that I'm crazy?
Gaslight
I'm not crazy if I'm right

Turn me to a girl I don't wanna be
Paranoia, look what you've done to me
Turn me to someone I don't wanna be
I'm not crazy if I'm right
I'm not crazy if I'm right

Why am I jealous if I'm yours?
Why do you make me insecure?
Why do you tell me not to worry
When you always fucking hurt me?
Why am I jealous if you're mine?
Why am I not even your type?
Why do you tell me that I'm crazy?
Gaslight
I'm not crazy if I'm right
