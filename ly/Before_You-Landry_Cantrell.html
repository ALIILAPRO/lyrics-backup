		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Red scars, deep inside of my chest 
Where I opened up my heart
So cold, and afraid to take a chance 
When every chance had left its mark

So numb and comfortable 
Naming all my demons 
I was used to feeling low 
And I stopped believing 
I was worthy to be loved by anyone 
And closed the door for good

But that was all before You
I guess it only takes one time to change Your mind
I guess it only takes one time to get it right 
Had almost given up on everything this time 
But that was all before You, yeah-e-eh
But that was all before You, o-o-oh
But that was all before You
That was all before You Lord 

Every road that I traveled 
Had only led me to dead ends 
Lonely, was so familiar 
That I thought it was my friend 

So numb and comfortable 
Naming all my demons 
I was used to feeling low 
And I stopped believing 
I was worthy to be loved by anyone 
And closed the door for good!

But that was all before You
I guess it only takes one time to change Your mind
I guess it only takes one time to get it right 
Had almost given up on everything this time 
But that was all before You
I thought that my last chance had passed me by 
But I guess I was too blind to recognize 
That You were what was missing in my life 
But that was all before you 

That was all before You, Jesus
All before You
All before You, o-o-oh

But that was all before You
I guess it only takes one time to change Your mind
But that was all before You, yeah-e-eh
I thought that my last chance had passed me by ooh-ooh
But that was all before You!
