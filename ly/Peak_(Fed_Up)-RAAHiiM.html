		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Haven't even said the words to you (you)
But you already took it personal ('nal)
Only ever see the worst in me (me)
Only ever see it how you wanna
I can never say things honestly

So, I don't even care to take it back
Love it when you look at me like that
Oh, darling

Ooh
Thinking I'm in the mood
Won't you tie up your hair?
Won't you take off your shoes, baby?
Ooh

Now alright, and make me feel
Love me like you're fed up, baby, yeah

Love me like you're
Touch me like you're
Love me like you're fed up

After everything is up and said and done, I'm

Still a part of your destruction
To be honest, I
I wanna know, can't wait to know
Pride on the floor, 'cause you're insecure
I'd rather break off all the subtlety
A love like that'll never work for me

Ooh, you thinking I'm in the mood
Won't you tie up your hair?
Won't you take off your shoes, baby?
Ooh

Now alright and make me feel
Love me like you're fed up, baby, yeah
Love me like you're
Touch me like you're
Love me like you're fed up (oh, oh)

Love me like
Love me like you're fed up, baby (you're fed up)
