		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Prince Ali
Yes, it is he
But not as you know him
Read my lips
And come to grips
With reality
Yes, meet a blast from your past
Whose lies were too good to last
Say hello to your precious Prince Ali

So Ali
Turns out to be
Merely Aladdin
Just a con
Need I go on?
Take it from me
His personality flaws
Give me adequate cause
To send him packing on a one-way trip
So his prospects take a terminal dip
His assets frozen
The venue chosen
It's the ends of the earth, whoopee
So long, ex-prince Ali
