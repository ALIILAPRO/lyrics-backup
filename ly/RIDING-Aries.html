		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ridin', on your own
Ashin' the cigarette beside me, plug my nose
All this make me feel so alive, switchin' lanes
Checkin' my left-hand side, I'm never right
Give me a break

Too smart (too damn smart)
December you're sweatin'
All the nuances you're forced to accept
Talkin' lukewarm (fuck it up)
Whenever you're ready
I'll be right there whenever you need

Shimmy-shimmy, roll up
Or sippy your mimosa
I want a m√©nage, crown on me Ayatollah
I want my garage to fit a Bentley and a Rover
Your energy I like
Make me wanna sign my whole life over
To you
Realize I put my celly on mute
Fantasies, I don't wanna have you alone

Ridin', on your own
Ashin' the cigarette beside me, plug my nose
All this make me feel so alive, switchin' lanes
Checkin' my left-hand side, I'm never right
Give me a break

Too smart (too damn smart)
December you're sweatin'
All the nuances you're forced to accept
Talkin' lukewarm (fuck it up)
Whenever you're ready
I'll be right there whenever you need

And you'll be ridin' on your own

And you'll be ridin' (on your own)

And you'll be ridin'
I don't see you in the same light I did
All my friends, family look at me like a giant
Touch the skies with five fingers
And I love myself so much
They probably thinkin', "Why you ridin'?"

(Ridin') on your own
Ashin' the cigarette beside me, plug my nose
All this make me feel so alive, switchin' lanes
Checkin' my left-hand side, I'm never right
Give me a break
