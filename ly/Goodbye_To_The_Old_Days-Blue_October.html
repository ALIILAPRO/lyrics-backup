		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know if it's fair, but at least I was honest
My explanations: overrated
It wouldn't have stopped from hurting you
I just wanted to stop the pain

We were drier than the sand in the sun in Nevada
Our words blew away like time and fate
It wouldn't have stopped from hurting you, I just gotta say:

Goodbye to the old days
Goodbye to them all
I only want what's best for you
I'm sad I couldn't see it through
But I just have to say:
Goodbye to the old days 
Goodbye to them all
I only want what's best for you
I'm sad I couldn't see you through
But I gotta say:
Goodbye to the old days

Well I hope one day when you look back on it
You'll see a love began with a mess I made
I couldn't have stopped from hurting you
If forgiving me didn't stop the pain

Yeah, fuck it I admit it: I'm the one that caved in
Oh you never had love cause I know I never gave it
And it wouldn't have stopped from hurting you
I just gotta say:

Goodbye to the old days 
Goodbye to them all
I only want what's best for you
I'm sad I couldn't see it through
But I just had to say:
Goodbye to the old days
Goodbye to them all
I only want what's best for you
I'm sad I didn't see you through
But I just had to say:
Goodbye to the old days

Where do we go from here?
How do we go from here?

I don't know if it's fair, but at least I was honest
My explanations: overrated
It wouldn't have stopped from hurting you
I just wanted to stop the pain

We were drier than the sand in the sun in Nevada
Our words blew away like time and fate
It wouldn't have stopped from hurting you
I just gotta say:

Goodbye to the old days 
Goodbye to them all
I only want what's best for you
I'm sad I couldn't see it through
But I just have to say:

Goodbye to the old days 
Goodbye to them all
I only want what's best for you
I'm sad I couldn't see you through
But I gotta say:
Goodbye to the old days
