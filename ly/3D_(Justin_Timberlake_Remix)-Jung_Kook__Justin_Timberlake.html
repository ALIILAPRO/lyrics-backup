		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  1, 2, 3D

I can't touch you through the phone
Or kiss you through the universe
In another time zone
It's the only time I can't reverse
But when there's 2 dimensions
There's only 1 I'm missing
And if you feel alone
You don't have to feel that no more

I just wanna see you like that
See you like that, uh uh

So if you're ready (so if you're ready)
And if you'll let me (and if you'll let me)
I wanna see it
In motion
In 3D (uh-uh)
You won't regret me (you won't regret me)
Champagne confetti (champagne confetti)
I wanna see it
In motion
In 3D 

'Cause you know how I like it girl (uh)
3D
You know how I like it girl

Careful what you ask for
Jung and JT on the main now
You can still find me in a drop top
With the top down but I got so many lanes now
And when I put it into 6 and it clicks
All the tricks got you going insane now
I'll reach through the screen, feel my touch, top up
While I'm watching you rain down
Come with me, I'll just call up the plane now
Now let me fly you out to Seoul, Korea
I just wanna get into your soul like Aretha
I got the volume when you wanna get the beat up
'Cause it's like 3D when we meet up
And I

I just wanna see you like that
See you like that, uh uh

So if you're ready (so if you're ready)
And if you'll let me (oh, no) (and if you'll let me)
I wanna see it (hey)
In motion
In 3D (in 3D) (uh-uh)
You won't regret me (you won't regret me)
Champagne confetti (champagne confetti)
I wanna see it (I wanna)
In motion (in motion)
In 3D (in 3D)

Body to body to body to body to body
You and me baby you know, that we got it
So don't go getting me started
'Cause you know I get hot hearted
Baby, oh, baby, oh, baby, you're making me crazy
Rain rain rain you can't fake it
You give me brand new emotion
You got me drinking that potion

I just wanna see you like that
See you like that, uh uh

So if you're ready (so if you're ready)
And if you'll let me (and if you'll let me)
I wanna see it
In motion
In 3D (uh-uh)
You won't regret me (you won't regret me)
Champagne confetti (champagne confetti)
I wanna see it
In motion
In 3D 

'Cause you know how I like it girl
You know how I like it 
3D
'Cause you know how I like it girl (oh, yeah, alright)
3D
'Cause you know how I like it girl
You know how I like it (alright)
3D
You know how I like it, girl (you know)
3D (woo)
