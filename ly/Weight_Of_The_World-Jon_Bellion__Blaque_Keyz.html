		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're six feet underground inside my bed
And all the little letters in my head
We're spelling suicide but not by choice
Was calling out for help, but heard no noise, no noise

Only the sound of my back breaking
But ever since you and your arms saved me

I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore

The only friend I had wore black and red
The darker instruments inside my head
We're playing suicide but not by choice, by choice
Was calling out for help, but heard no noise, no noise

Only the sound of my hands shaking
But ever since you and your arms saved me

I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore

Don't hold the weight of the world
I don't hold the weight, I don't hold the weight

This the flow that helped me tip the scale
I'm stackin' chips like Chippendale's without the strippin'
Get the bailiff out 'cause Mr. Bellion's out the cell
We skip the bail and out the jail
We hit the trail, the route we took is hard to smell it out
So get to sniffin' equipped with the gift of spit
Like the lisp on the chick who played in the flick next to Spiderman

I'm brighter than LEDs on your TV
Keyz is sharp as a dagger
Who walks around with a swagger of Kenny G
When you see me, chill with the chatter
Got the skill of a master craftsman whose passion is rappin'
Snackin' on actors, so pass me a napkin
Chip on the shoulder, the kid is colder than both Dakotas
The winter soldier, assassin coming after your captain
For honor and every day, I'm getting stronger
No one will shock the world, got a buzz like a mini Blanka
When they apply the pressure, it's heavier than E. Honda
Got what it takes to be great, but can't hold this weight any longer
