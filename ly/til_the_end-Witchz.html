		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The only thing on my mind
You been in it sometime
Look at me for some light
It ain't like us to fight
Spending all of our lives
Sharing all of highs and lows
When we open our eyes
Let's stay high on love our souls
Yea we high on hope
Yea we high on dope
They lie let our love die slow
Even God don't know
Is it a lie
Are we alive
Caught in a spiral
Lives on the line
Are we the Gods
Losing our minds
Put on the bible
That we'll survive
You're all I need to get by
All I need to get high
Fuck em all til we die
Know it's all just a lie
We gave all of our tries
Sharing all of our cries I know
Follow me to the sky
Let's stay high on love our souls
Yea we high on hope
Yea we high on dope
They lie let our love die slow
Even God don't know
Is it a lie
Are we alive
We're in a spiral
Lives on the line
Are we the Gods
Losing our minds
Put on the bible
That we'll survive
I don't wanna wake up
If I ain't got you by my side
Fuckins how we make up
Keep you through the afterlife
Let's stay high on love our souls
Yea we high on hope
Yea we high on dope
They lie let our love die slow
Even God don't know
Is it a lie
Are we alive
We're in a spiral
Lives on the line
Are we the Gods
Losing our minds
Put on the bible
That we'll survive
