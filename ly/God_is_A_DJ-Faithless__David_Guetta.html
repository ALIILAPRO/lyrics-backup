		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is my church
This is where I heal my hurts
It's in the world I've become
Contained in the hum
Between voice and drum
It's in change
The poetic justice of cause and effect
Respect, love, compassion
This is my church
This is where I heal my hurts
For tonight
God is a DJ

The poetic justice of cause and effect
Respect, love, compassion
This is my church
This is where I heal my hurts
For tonight
God is a DJ

(This is my church)
God is a DJ
