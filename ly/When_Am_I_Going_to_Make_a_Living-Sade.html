		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ha-ha
Aha, mmh

When am I gonna make a living? Ooh
It's gonna take a while before I give in
See the people fussing and thieving
While the sharks are wheeling and dealing

Gotta look up and tell yourself
There's no end to what you can do
They'll waste your body and soul if you allow them to
This is time to start believing in yourself
Put the blame on no one else

When am I gonna make a living? Ooh
It's gonna take a while before I give in
See the people fussing and stealing
Too many lies, no one is achieving

Haven't I told you before
We're hungry for a life we can't afford?
There's no end to what you can do
If you give yourself a chance to prove

We're hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
We're hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in

Oh there's no end to what you can do
They'll waste your body and soul if you allow them to
Oh start believing in yourself
Put the blame on no one else

Not gonna give in
hungry but we won't give in 

When am I gonna make a living? ooh
It's gonna take a while before I give in, yes it is
I'm sick and tired of scratching a living
I am hungry but I'm not gonna give in, no

We're hungry but we won't give in (not gonna give in)
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in (not gonna give in)
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we won't give in
Hungry but we're gonna win
