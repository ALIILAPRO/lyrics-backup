		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll take with me every single luxury when I leave you
Count on me for that and nothing more
Count on me for that and nothing more
The view from this side's not what
The view from this side's not what
I thought it'd be, promise something differently
Close our eyes and let go of the wheel

It's not the quanity that bothers me
No it's not the quanity that bothers me
No it's not the quality that bothers me..

It's the means, twenty-twenty surgery
Well, twenty-twenty surgery
For cheap dollar signs are a, for picture perfect point of view
Twenty-twenty surgery
Well, twenty-twenty surgery
For cheap, dollar signs are a, for picture perfect point of view

Well all young children listen, 'cause they got so much to learn
Turn it in, turn it in
We'll get you home in time, to make them wretched be for free for being me

It's not the quanity that bothers me
No it's not the quanity that bothers me
No it's not the quality that bothers me..

It's the means, twenty-twenty surgery
Well, twenty-twenty surgery
For cheap dollar signs are a, for picture perfect point of view
Twenty-twenty surgery
Well, twenty-twenty surgery
For cheap, dollar signs are a, for picture perfect point of view

You do, you don't, you do, you don't
Would you like to think that?
You do, you don't, you do, you don't
Would you like to think that?
You do, you don't, you do, you don't
Would you like to think that?

It's the means, twenty-twenty surgery
Well, twenty-twenty surgery
For cheap dollar signs are a, for picture perfect point of view
Twenty-twenty surgery
Well, twenty-twenty surgery
For cheap, dollar signs are a, for picture perfect point of view

You're so sensitive
I am, I am a machine.
You're so sensitive
I am, I am a machine.
You're so sensitive
I am, I am a machine.
You're so sensitive
I am, I am a machine.
