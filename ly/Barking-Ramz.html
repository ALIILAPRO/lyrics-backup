Mokuba Lives
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

I might link my ting from Barking
7am in the morning
She's callin', I'm yawnin'
She's jarrin', no stallin'
I might link my ting from Barking
7am in the morning
She's callin', I'm yawnin'
She's jarrin', no stallin'
I might link my ting from Barking
7am in the morning
She's callin', I'm yawnin'
She's jarrin', no stallin'
I might link my ting from Barking
7am in the morning
She's callin', I'm yawnin'
She's jarrin', no stallin'

I'm icey, I got a tick from my head to my feet, that's Nike
And that's pricey
You see them guys over there they ain't like me
I got a Portuguese ting not wifey
She said my temper's tiny
I got two different worlds like Miley
You hit me up that's unlikely
But I walked in the room with a fresh trim
Showing my Colgate teeth
Yeah they're looking at me
Saying "can I get a pic for the 'Gram, just like AJ T"
No wonder they hate on me
'Cause I'm making P's and they see these clothes
Yeah I get 'em for free

I might link my ting from Barking
7am in the morning
She's callin', I'm yawnin'
She's jarrin', no stallin'
I might link my ting from Barking
7am in the morning
She's callin', I'm yawnin'
She's jarrin', no stallin'
I might link my ting from Barking
7am in the morning
She's callin', I'm yawnin'
She's jarrin', no stallin'
I might link my ting from Barking
7am in the morning
She's callin', I'm yawnin'
She's jarrin', no stallin'

Many guys, many many many guys
Hate me and it's, true too bad
I just stunt on you, too bad I don't look like you
Like many many many guys
Hate me and it's, true too bad
I just stunt on you, like too bad

I might link my ting from Barking
7am in the morning
She's callin', I'm yawnin'
She's jarrin', no stallin'
I might link my ting from Barking
7am in the morning
She's callin', I'm yawnin'
She's jarrin', no stallin'
I might link my ting from Barking
7am in the morning
She's callin', I'm yawnin'
She's jarrin', no stallin'
I might link my ting from Barking
7am in the morning
She's callin', I'm yawnin'
