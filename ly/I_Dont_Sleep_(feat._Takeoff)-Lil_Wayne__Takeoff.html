		<p>
		  (Think we we found a loophole)
Yeah
Funeral (yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh

I don't sleep (I don't sleep)
Fuck a bed, fuck a spread, fuck a sheet (I don't sleep)
Fuck a Xanny, give me Adderall and weed (I don't sleep)
Speedballin' off the cocaine and codeine (I don't sleep)
Chinchilla carpet got her walkin' on her knees (on her knees)

I don't sleep and I'm still livin' out my dreams (I don't sleep)
Kill you in your sleep and now you can't get out your dreams (fuck your dreams)
Notorious B.I.G. said it was all a dream (all a dream)
I'm reppin' M-O-B, the mob, I got ties (woo, woo)
In the back of my head, under my locks, I got eyes (woo)
Presidents so dead up in my pockets, I got flies (yeah)
Been chasin' these presidents so long they must be tired (yeah)
They better not close their eyes, 'cause Tunechi never blink (never blink)
And if you sleepin' on Lil Tunechi, rest in peace (rest in peace)
'Cause all a nigga do is win like I cheat (like I cheat)
And I ain't sleepin' 'til they bring me to the priest (to the priest)
Fuck a bed, fuck a spread, fuck a sheet

Uh, I just popped a tent, I'm in my man cave
Lookin' for some hoes in my DMs, man, I miss Backpage
Your lil' hoe do spin class at the gym, that bitch in bad shape
My lil' hoe said she got' spend a band, now like it ratchet
Did some cocaine with these bitches, like it fancy
Snort the cocaine off their titties in my mansion
I'm gettin' naked with these bitches, I'm on Addy and Cialis
Breakin' records in these bitches
Wait, I think, this hoe need Jesus, I need water
She say, "These them double D's that float in water"
I'm too numb, I bit my jaw and I can't feel it
I'm so numb I hit it raw and I can't feel it

I'm on the ceiling, I don't sleep (I don't sleep)
Fuck a bed, fuck a spread, fuck a sheet (I don't sleep)
Fuck a Xanny, give me Adderall and weed (I don't sleep)
Speedballin' off the cocaine and codeine (I don't sleep)
Chinchilla carpet got her walkin' on her knees (on her knees)

Threw a million in a week and I ain't freak
I ain't fret, I ain't sweat, I ain't keep
She said, Tunechi, "What you think about me," lemme think (whoa)
She said, "Why you never answer?" Told her, "I was sleep"

Takeoff
Told her I was sleep
Really I was with my other bitch from Italy
Text message from my Memphis bitch, she get 'em ten a key
The sticks you thirty minutes and it don't need anti-freeze
I believe, niggas tryna get the goals that I achieve (goals)
Me without the paper just like Tune without the lean
Or Phil without the rings (Or what?), Snoop without the weed (or what?)
AI without the sleeve (or what?), IG without the memes (nah)
I'm up, Adderral, these niggas they drinkin' on Tylenol (nah)
I give her the X, she give me the neck, and no, we don't talk at all (at all)
Jaws, I'm breakin' 'em in, she gettin' the balls and all (ball)
I cannot sleep and I cannot eat, if it ain't codeine involved

I don't sleep (I don't sleep)
Fuck a bed, fuck a spread, fuck a sheet (I don't sleep)
Fuck a Xanny, give me Adderall and weed (I don't sleep)
Speedballin' off the yayo and codeine (I don't sleep)
Me and Takeoff 'bout to take off, 'bout to flee (yeah)

I don't sleep and I'm still livin' out my dreams (I don't sleep)
Kill you in your sleep and now you can't get out your dreams (fuck your dreams)
Notorious B.I.G. said it was all a dream (all a dream)
I'm reppin' M-O-B, the mob, I got ties (woo, woo)
In the back of my head, under my locks, I got eyes (woo)
Presidents so dead up in my pockets, I got flies (yeah)
Been chasin' these presidents so long they must be tired (yeah)
They better not close their eyes, 'cause Tunechi never blink (Nnever blink)
And if you sleepin' on Lil Tunechi, rest in peace (rest in peace)
'Cause all a nigga do is win like I cheat (like I cheat)
And I ain't sleepin' 'til they bring me to the priest (to the priest)
Fuck a bed, fuck a spread, fuck a sheet
