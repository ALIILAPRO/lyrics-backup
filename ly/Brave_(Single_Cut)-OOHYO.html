		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every little moment that you wish
That you were stronger
Every little moment of despair
Every little word that loses
Meaning in the air
Every little voice that goes unheard
Every single day that passes
By as if the wind
Always steady yet so out of reach
Every stormy sea that sets ablaze
A whole new fear
Every little sweet lie in disguise
Is it true that even these can turn to gold?
Is it true that after all we'll get back home?
When you're following the light
And your heart is open wide
Love will hope and hope
And hope and guide you further
Wanna climb mountains with you
Push boundaries with you
Wanna be braver than ever
Braver for you
Wanna swim oceans with you
Wanna break records with you
Wanna dive deep
Make this one leap
I'm all in for you
Wanna be brave brave brave brave
Brave brave brave brave
Wanna be brave brave brave brave
Brave brave brave brave
Is it true that even tears can turn to gold?
Can it grow a tree
That bears the fruits of hope?
When we're following the light
And our heart is open wide
Love will hope and hope
And hope and guide us further
Wanna climb mountains with you
Push boundaries with you
Wanna be braver than ever
Braver for you
Wanna swim oceans with you
Wanna break records with you
Wanna dive deep
Make this one leap
I'm all in for you
Wanna be brave brave brave brave
Brave brave brave brave
Wanna be brave brave brave brave
Brave brave brave brave
Da ra ta ta ta ta ta ta ta
Da ra ta ta ta ta ta ta ta
