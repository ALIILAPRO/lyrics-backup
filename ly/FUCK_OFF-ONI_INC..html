		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuck off fuck off
Leatherback bitch got a bite too soft
Every shoot shot like i'm Lara Croft
RPG lead wit a CQ sawed

They're mine my memories do you hear me?

Oh symphony of destruction
Go for it if you think i'm bluffing
Single serve human a McGuffin
You about as real as Ronald McMuffin bitch
You're fake as fuck your tit's are stuffed
You made me denounce love for real
You like an eel slimey and hiding intentions
Fuck out my mentions don't need a pension
Bitch I get money
Been told that i'm handsome
And awkwardly funny sunny in Vegas
Demonic mages
Not even close if we comparing wages

Fuck off fuck off
Leatherback bitch got a bite too soft
Every shoot shot like i'm Lara Croft
RPG lead wit a CQ sawed

You wanted death
Well i'm here you motherfucker
