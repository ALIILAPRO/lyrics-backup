		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No, please don't cry
I've never done this before, drove a million miles
Back when you were mine
I was too young to know you were the one to find

But if I was to say I regret it
Would it mean a thing?
'Cause every time I think (I think), think about it
Memories take me back to all of the wildest times

If I could change your mind
I would hit the ground running
It took time to realize
And I never saw it coming
Forgive my lying eyes
Gonna give you all or nothing
If I could change your mind
I could make you mine, make you mine

Now I won't go
I won't run away this time
You're all I wanna know

But if I was to say I'll forget it
Would it mean a thing?
'Cause every time I think (I think), think about it
Memories take me back to all of the wildest times

If I could change your mind
I would hit the ground running
It took time to realize
And I never saw it coming
Forgive my lying eyes
Gonna give you all or nothing
If I could change your mind
I could make you, make you mine

Visions of our love pass right by me
Your eyes are enough to remind me
Visions of our love pass right by me
Your eyes are enough to remind me
Visions of our love remind me

If I could change your mind
(Never mind all the times that I told you)
I would hit the ground running
It took time to realize
(Never mind all the times that I told you)
And I never saw it coming
Forgive my lying eyes
(Never mind all the times that I told you)
Gonna give you all or nothing
If I could change your mind
I could make you mine, make you mine

Visions of our love remind me
(If could change your mind)
(Never mind all the times that I told you)
Visions of our love remind me
(It took time to realize)
(Never mind all the times that I told you)
Visions of our love remind me
(Forgive my lying eyes)
(Never mind all the times that I told you)
Visions of our love remind me
(If I could change your mind)
(I could make you mine, make you mine)
