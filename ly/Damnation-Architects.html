		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We suffer to survive
Are we desperate creatures crawling in the dirt?
Or are we lonely preachers hiding our beating hearts?
We sow the wind and reap the storm
Don't say you haven't been warned

No future's written
There's endless possibility

We suffer to survive
If hope is a prison, then maybe faith will set me free
We suffer to survive
Am I just a victim drifting in the raging sea?
We suffer to survive

If a kingdom resides behind my own eyes
I've got to catch the stone and cradle the wave
Damnation is just a daydream away
But still, we carry on
If I'm God in disguise, praying for the rain
And if our demons decide
Then is this all in vain?
We sow the wind and reap the storm
Don't say you haven't been warned

It's time to confess
I haunt this flesh
I answer my own prayers
I bid my own despair

No future's written
There's endless possibility

We suffer to survive
If hope is a prison, then maybe faith will set me free
We suffer to survive
Am I just a victim drifting in the raging sea?
We suffer to survive

But still, we carry on
There's a lesson in this, what I resist persists
And damnation is just a daydream away

If hope is a prison, then maybe faith will set me free
We suffer to survive
Am I just a victim drifting in the raging sea?
We suffer to survive
