		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I lost my mind today
Staring into the white of the page
White flag, my current mood
I tear it out and I wave it at you

My heart, when you're on your floor
I will guide you outdoors
I am mine and I'm yours
Ain't it wild these ups and downs

When you love someone
That you don't understand
Baby hold my hand
I dare you
When you feel restless
And you can't talk about it
We used to laugh in fits
Let it scare you
Let it scare you

Into the undertow
I'm tired of fighting, we know where it goes
I'll learn to breathe the blue
Don't need nobody 
I'll get kisses from fishes 

I heard your voice
Through the door
You'd never sung for me before
I am mine and I'm still yours
Ain't it wild these ups and downs

When you love someone 
That you don't understand
Baby hold my hand
I dare you
When you feel restless
And you can't talk about it
We used to laugh in fits
Let it scare you 

When you love someone 
That you don't understand
Baby hold my hand
I dare you
When you feel restless
And you can't talk about it
So what comes after this?
Let it scare you 
Let it scare you
Let it scare you
Let it scare you
