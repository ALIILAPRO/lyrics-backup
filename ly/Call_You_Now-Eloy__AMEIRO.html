		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just wanna call you now
Say I love you
Say I want you nah
Going out
Out with you every night nah
Show you how
Let them all know
Girl you're more then beautiful
I would let them know

Baby you do it now
But this loving ain't the same
Girl I would ride for you baby
Think we're playing different games

Know that I would ride for love
Know that I can't get enough
Know I ain't missing out
Think you know that too
Girl you're still in my mind dreams don't know how you been doing
Ey
Just want it to be me and you

Baby you do it now

Don't need love but I feel it bad
Ey
Won't let her know I won't tell no
Ey
I know its best for us babe
So i can't keep saying
I'll give you everything my baby

Oh
My baby keep me in a hold
Ey
She holding tight she won't let go
If I'd say
Baby if I tell you how I felt would you stay

I just wanna call you now
Say I love you
Say I want you nah
Going out
Out with you every night nah
Show you how
Let them all know
Girl you're more then beautiful
I would let them know

Baby you do it now
But this loving ain't the same
Girl I would ride for you baby
Think we're playing different games
