		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One day we'll be older
Remember the words 
that mama told ya

Life can go so fast
we can do our best  
always chase the end of the rainbow

Sometimes we're too late
think we re gonna break
but we will never fade out

So let me oh let me oh let me
breathe
the world has gone crazy
and I can't sleep
take all your dreams
make them memories,
memories


One day we'll be older
Remember the words 
that mama told ya
some days are bright
and some are colder
so lets not waste time
and hold me closer

One day we'll be older
Remember the words 
that mama told ya
some days are bright
and some are colder
so lets not waste time
and hold me closer

People talk so loud
we still figure out
just tryin to find a way through the darkness

Money drugs and cars
won't help with all the scars
You gotta hear what ur heart says

So let me oh let me oh let me
breathe
the world has gone crazy
and I can't sleep
take all your dreams
make them memories,
memories

One day we'll be older
Remember the words 
that mama told ya
some days are bright
and some are colder
so lets not waste time
and hold me closer

One day we'll be older
Remember the words 
that mama told ya
some days are bright
and some are colder
so lets not waste time
and hold me closer

One day we'll be older
remember the words 
that mama told ya
go live up your life
before its over
so let's not waste time
and hold me closer
