		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You having a good time?)
(Pleasure, little treasure)
(Are you having a good time?)
(Yeah)

Pleasure, little treasure

Everybody's looking for a reason to live
If you're looking for a reason, I've a reason to give
Pleasure, little treasure

(Oh yeah)
(You know)
(How are we feeling about tonight?)
(Yeah)

Everybody's looking for someone to follow
Finding the whole thing hard to swallow
Everybody's looking for a reason to live
If you're looking for a reason, I've a reason to give
Pleasure, little treasure

Everybody's looking for a new sensation
Everybody's talking 'bout state of the nation
Everybody's searching for a promised land
Everybody's failing to understand
Pleasure, little treasure
(Hey)

Everybody's looking for a reason to live (hey)
If you're looking for a reason, I've a reason to give (oh)
Pleasure, little treasure

Maternity frocks and paternity suits
If that's what you want, they're waiting for you
Everybody needs some reason or other
You'll find a reason when you discover
Pleasure, little treasure (hey)

Everybody's looking for a reason to live (yo)
If you're looking for a reason, I've a reason to give (yo)
Pleasure, little treasure

(Here we go)
(Here we go)
(Come on)
(Yeah)

Pleasure, little treasure
Pleasure, little treasure (yeah)
Pleasure, little treasure
Pleasure, little treasure
Pleasure, little treasure
Pleasure, little treasure (woo)

(Well thank you, thank you very much)
(Appreciate it, thank you)
