		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You said you ain't the one to to jump in a relation
And I don't mind, but when we touch it's elevation
Up, up, up, up, up
Up, up, up, up, up
You speak my lingo, we don't need no translation
I never need a break 'cause we feel like vacation
Up, up, up, up, up
Got me up, up, up, up, up

Go ahead and feel what you feel
I want you closer to me

Say my name
Wear it out like a sweater that you love
'Cause I can't get enough when you
Say my name
Spill it out like a drink you should have skipped
You're the one I wanna get when you
Say my name
Let it roll, let it roll off your tongue
Let me know, let me know what you want
Wear it out like a sweater that you love 
'Cause I can't get enough when you
Say my name
Say my name

Don't need no list of where you been, no information
You got me running out, out of patience
Up, up, up, up, up
Got me up, up, up, up
I like the interaction, you got my attention
I'm not in love, but I'm loving the situation
Up, up, up, up, up
If you're down, don't dare to stop

Go ahead and feel what you feel
I want you closer to me

Just say my name
Wear it out like a sweater that you love
'Cause I can't get enough when you
Say my name
Spill it out like a drink you should have skipped
You're the one I wanna get when you
Say my name
Let it roll, let it roll off your tongue
Let me know, let me know what you want
Wear it out like a sweater that you love
'Cause I can't get enough when you
Say my name
Say my name

Go ahead and feel what you feel
'Cause I need what I need, and I say what I mean

Just say my name (say my name)
Wear it out like a sweater that you love
'Cause I can't get enough when you
Say my name (say my name)
Spill it out like a drink you should have skipped
You're the one I wanna get when you
Say my name
Let it roll, let it roll off your tongue
Let me know, let me know what you want
Wear it out like a sweater that you love
'Cause I can't get enough when you
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
