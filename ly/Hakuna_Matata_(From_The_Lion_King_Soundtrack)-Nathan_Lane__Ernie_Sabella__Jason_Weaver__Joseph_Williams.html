		  Hakuna Matata
What a wonderful phrase
Hakuna Matata
Ain't no passing craze

It means no worries
For the rest of your days
It's our problem free philosophy
Hakuna Matata

Why, when he was a young warthog
When I was a young warthog
Very nice
Thanks
He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal
He could clear the Savannah after every meal
I'm a sensitive soul, though I seem thick skinned
And it hurt that my friends never stood downwind
And oh, the shame
(He was ashamed)
Thought of changin' my name
(Oh, what's in a name?)
And I got downhearted
(How did you feel?)
Every time that I-
Hey, Pumbaa, not in front of the kids
Oh, sorry

Hakuna Matata
What a wonderful phrase
Hakuna Matata
Ain't no passing craze
It means no worries
For the rest of your days
Yeah, sing it, kid
It's our problem free philosophy
Hakuna Matata

Hakuna Matata
Hakuna Matata
Hakuna Matata
Hakuna

It means no worries
For the rest of your days
It's our problem free philosophy
Hakuna matata (Hakuna matata)
(Hakuna matata) Hakuna matata (Hakuna matata)
(Hakuna matata) Hakuna matata
Hakuna matata

Hakuna matata
Hakuna matata
Hakuna matata, 'tata, 'tata, hahaha
