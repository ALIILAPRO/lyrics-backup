		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were my courage, my sword and shield
Grace under pressure, my wall of steel
I was a stone, weighing us down
You were the angel I chained to the ground
I miss the way you undress, I miss your head on my chest
Can't stop this bleeding, can't stop believing

I'm missing the sound of your heart beating
Baby I'm in love with you
Oh I'm missing the sound of your heart beating
Baby you were mine to lose
Oh, I'm missing the sound of your heart beating

You showed me heaven, you rang up bells
I played with matches, it hurt like hell
Asleep and wake, you're all I see
I can't escape you, can't set you free
I miss your full moon rising, catching a breath in silence
Can't stop this bleeding, can't stop believing

I'm missing the sound of your heart beating
Baby I'm in love with you
Oh, I'm missing the sound of your heart beating
Baby you were mine to lose
Oh, I'm missing the sound of your heart beating
Missing you, missing you
I'm missing the sound of your heart beating
Missing you, missing you
I'm missing the sound of your heart beating

Baby I'm coming, baby I'm coming
Tell me now, baby I'll come running
Baby I'm coming, baby I'm coming
Say the words, baby I'll come running

Baby I'm in love with you
Oh and I'm missing the sound of your heart beating
Baby you were mine to lose
Oh and I'm missing the sound of your heart beating

Oh, I'm missing the sound, I'm missing the sound of your heart beating, beating
I'm missing the sound of your heart beating

Missing you, missing you
Oh, I'm missing the sound of your heart beating
Missing you missing you
Oh and I'm missing the sound of your heart beating
Beating, beating, oh I'm missing the sound of your heart beating
