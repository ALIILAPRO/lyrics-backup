		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just don't wanna go but do what you wanna do
Find me my face discolored leading you on to lose
It's simple I find my brother I leave em a clue for you
I just don't wanna go but do what you wanna do

Wait adjust pain today
??? no I'm happy I made it
Stay i know I'm fake today
Afraid because I'm hiding my face

I just don't wanna go but do what you wanna do
Find me my face discolored leading you on to lose
It's simple I find my brother I leave em a clue for you
I just don't wanna go but do what you wanna do

I just don't wanna go but do what you wanna do
Find me my face discolored leading you on to lose
It's simple I find my brother I leave em a clue for you
I just don't wanna go but do what you wanna do

Stay adjust pain today
Hey no i'm happy I made it
??? i know I'm fake today
Afraid because I'm hiding my face

I just don't wanna go but do what you wanna do
Find me my face discolored leading you on to lose
It's simple I find my brother I leave em a clue for you
I just don't wanna go but do what you wanna do
