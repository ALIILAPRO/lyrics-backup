		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Seems there's something in the air today
It's got me feeling, oh, a certain way
Seems like lately, I've been on the run
It's got me reeling every night I'm done

Keep thinking, what am I supposed to do?
My body's not working like it used to
And these bills keep piling up on me
Remember when I had no responsibilities

So take me back when I was younger
And I was still hungry, oh
Take me back when I was younger
Yeah, I got the world at my feet
Just try and stop me (just try and stop me)
Yeah, take me back when I was younger

Watching all my friends pass away
When they promised me that they would be here today
I wish that I could put a force field
Around every single one of us
I would protect you from everything
(I'd put a force field) All around us
And ground us forever and ever

I keep on walking down the same streets (same streets)
I keep on acting like I never left (like I never left)
I keep on walking down the same streets (same streets)
And I'll never leave

So take me back when I was younger
And I was still hungry
Take me back when I was younger
Yeah, I got the world at my feet
Just try and stop me (just try and stop me)
Yeah, take me back when I was younger

I don't want to be forever
But I don't want to grow older
Oh, take me back when I was younger
When I was still hungry
When I still had it in me
Take me

(Just try and stop me) So take me back when I was younger
(I keep on walking down the same streets) And I was still hungry
(I keep on acting like I never left) Take me back when I was younger
(I keep on walking down the same streets) Yeah, I got the world at my feet
Just try and stop me (and I'll never leave)
Take me back when I was younger
