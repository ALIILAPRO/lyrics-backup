		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, listen! (hahaha)
I blame it on you, I blame it on you
Yee!

I just wanna drink you up
Pour you in a silver cup
You know I like to party
But you know I love your body
So many things I shouldn't do
I hate myself for hurting you
Honestly, I'm reckless
I'm sorry if I'm selfish

Every time you get too close I run, I run away
And every time you say the words I don't know what to say
Back, back to the beginning
Really wish that I could change
I do, I do, I do

I blame it on your love
Every time I fuck it up
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love
I can't help it, I can't stop
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love
I blame it on your love

Sorry I'm a little scared
But no one ever really cared (ah)
I took you for granted (yeah, I did)
Just a big misunderstanding
I just want to spend the night (one night)
Sleeping in your bed tonight, yeah
Watch a little TV
I love it when you need me

Every time you get too close I run, I run away
And every time you say the words I don't know what to say
Back, back to the beginning
Really wish that I could change
I do, I do, I do

I blame it on your love (yeah, yeah)
Every time I fuck it up (fuck it up, man)
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love
I can't help it, I can't stop
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love
I blame it on your love (y'all ready?)

I don't know what's wrong with this girl, Charli, she crazy
Gotta blame it on the, blame it on the, blame it on the juice
Looking at my booty like you don't know what to do
Baby, I know that you can't control it
But my body like a swisher, just roll it
I'ma give you one chance to fall in love
Give you one chance, don't fuck this up
Ah ah oh (uh-oh, uh-oh)
I'm tryna catch millions, I ain't tryna catch feelings (bitch!)

I blame it on your love (yeah, yeah)
Every time I fuck it up (fuck it up, man)
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love
I can't help it, I can't stop
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love
Every time I fuck it up
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love
I can't help it, I can't stop
I blame it on your love, I do (hahahaha, ok, that's it)
