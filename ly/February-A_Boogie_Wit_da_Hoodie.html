		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stephen Curry, never worry
Bitches only love me when it's February
I wanna take you shoppin', I won't take advantage
Don't panic on me and I won't vanish

Unstrappin' your bra, takin' off your panties
Let's take this anywhere you want, just don't take me for granted (huh?)
And this is how you made me

Shout out to my ex, she probably hate me
I don't know what happened, everything was gravy
I ain't the type to let these situations change me
But I feel sorry for the next one who try to play me
Look, baby, thank me
All them tricks you learned, you got it from me
I opened your third eye, showed you artistry
And I can't even close my eyes and try to fall asleep (huh?)
I know I made a mess
But I can clean it up if you want me to, baby
I get caught up lettin' my emotions faze me
This time it's me versus myself, but I'm the same me
Look, she's independent
But if you wanna be Beyonc√©, you need JAY-Z
I was nineteen, drivin' in a ten-speed
Right to a Lamborghini, had to skip the Bentley
Let's make a movie, huh?
Put it in your back and make you scream like Sidney
VVS' hittin' like a glass of Simply
As simple as it takes to fall in love tonight
So please, baby, can we not throw subs tonight?
Baby, I got you, why don't you get me?
All these bitches wanna do is trick me
That's why I don't plan on fallin' back in love this time
They was talkin' 'bout me when they said love is blind
7:30 AM (oh-oh, oh)
And it's vacant, but I'm stayin'
And I got two chains with me, bring a new friend
Next time bring new friend, next time bring a new friend

Unstrappin' your bra, takin' off your panties
Let's take this anywhere you want, just don't take me for granted
And this is how you made me
Niggas throwin' shots and barely grazed me

R.I.P bullets, then Givenchy clothes
I got a problem with whoever think I don't want problems, whoa
She get on top and start ridin' me, all out of control
Lil' bitch from Saudi Arabia, she got a lot of dough
You might not know how to ride my wave, jump on my surfboard
Don't be afraid, big body Wraith big enough for both of us
If you need somebody to use, I can be your controller
Titties double C, cover you in double C
Chanelly, flavors for you (woo)
And you ain't gotta go to the store, they could bring it to you
You say this dick is your property, I got acres for you
And you don't know all about it, I can explain to you 'cause you know (huh?)

I can make you scream like Sidney
VVS' hittin' like a glass of Simply
As simple as it takes to fall in love tonight
Bitches only love me when it's February
