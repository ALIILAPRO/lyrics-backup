		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Doc said I've got twelve hours
I called you without a second thought
Plane ride within the hour
As she pictures life without her son
Oh, oh, I know

One hour visitation
She beats me in chess, another round
Don't matter what we're saying
I'm just glad you made it into town
Oh, oh

Save me, now I'm facing
All my fears of the unknown
I've been shakin' in my bones
Lately I've been praying
To a god I've never known
I can't do this on my own

So try not to cry
I won't say goodbye just yet
So hold on to my hand
Oh, I'll be fine for tonight
With you by my side, oh my
But don't you know, you're my lifeline

I know I'm not good at calling
Dad said I've fallen off the grid
We hardly say I love you
'Cause your parent's parents never did
Oh, oh, ooh

Save me, now I'm facing
All my fears of the unknown
I've been shakin' in my bones
Lately I've been praying
To a god I've never known
I can't do this on my own

Try not to cry
I won't say goodbye just yet
So hold on to my hand
Oh, I'll be fine for tonight
With you by my side, oh my
But don't you know, you're my lifeline

So let go 'cause I won't waste another minute
This distance, we're drifting from difference of opinion
I can't be mad I'm not what you planned for
I hope you know that no one else could ever

Save me, I've been praying
To a god I've never known
I can't do this on my own

Try not to cry
I won't say goodbye just yet
So hold on to my hand
Oh, I'll be fine for tonight
With you by my side, oh
Don't you know, you're my lifeline
Ooh, my lifeline
Don't you know, you're my lifeline
