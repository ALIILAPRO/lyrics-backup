		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So much to believe in, we were lost in time
Everything I needed fell into your eyes
Always thought of keeping your heart next to mine
But now that seems so far away
Don't know how love could leave without a trace
Where do silent hearts go?

Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?

Candle in the water, drifting helplessly
Hiding from the thunder, come and rescue me
Driven by the hunger of the endless dream
I'm searching for the hand that I can hold
I'm reaching for the arms that let me know
Where do silent hearts go?

Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?
Where do all the lonely hearts go?

Then one touch overcomes the silence
Love still survives
Two hearts needing one another
Give me wings to fly

Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside, oh

I need someone to give my heart to
I feel it getting stronger and stronger and stronger, yeah
And I feel it inside
Hearts are made to last
'Til the end of time
