		  (D.A. got that)
(D.A. got that dope)

I turn the news on when I smell death in the air
I prove you wrong, I made it out of here
I don't belong, I see my past everywhere
Don't stand too close to me, eternal PTSD
I got a war zone inside of my head
I made it on my own, they said I'd be in jail or dead
I've seen my brothers fall, over and over again
Don't stand too close to me, I got PTSD

I was hearing bangs like Chief Keef
Always yelling names that's deceased
I go off my mind and my instinct
Shootin' at the same time, we was in sync
On the same thing, tryna repeat
We was in them whips, right back on the enemies
Stuffed on my last hit, I was in the middle seat
Fuck it, out the sunroof, brodie got a quick release
And we in a car real fast, fuck police
Shots fired back but his ass in the street
When I bought a forty, showed Brittany and Tiffany
Knowing if they call, it ain't shit they can't get from me
Lot of warfare 17 had a 50 piece
Flexed on niggas so you know they wanna kill a G (royalty)
Posted in the hood with some Bentley keys (loyalty)
Roc died, showed 'em what it really mean
I can't sleep 'cause it's a war zone in my head
My killas good, they know I'm hands on with the bread
A million dollars ahead, I'm still angry and seeing red
How the fuck I'm 'posed to have fun? All my niggas dead

I turn the news on when I smell death in the air
I prove you wrong, I made it out of here
I don't belong, I see my past everywhere
Don't stand too close to me, eternal PTSD
I got a war zone inside of my head
I made it on my own, they said I'd be in jail or dead
I've seen my brothers fall, over and over again
Don't stand too close to me, I got PTSD

Used to run home from the train stop
Runnin' so fast dodgin' raindrops
'Member got robbed at the park once
'Member thinkin' that that bitch probably ain't caught
'Member I was with my mama one time, seen a nigga through the glass
Hit a nigga with a bankshot
Point blank, head hanging off his tank top
Walked off, we drove off, went to GameStop (skrrt)
Quiet ride there, picked up San Andreas
Certain things we ain't talk about, mama, we just prayed off
We seen it all, don't get involved
Carry the weight of the world like a shawl
Conceal and revealing to people in court
I still can feel it, I know that the world is evil
In case you thought a nigga forgot it
When my homie was bleeding out, another homie went in his pockets
Please do not run up on me, not even as fans
Niggas get fanned down on the Dan Ryan
I'm flyin', I'm scary as hell, I need me a Xan, ah

The days seem long as life gets shorter
We know sex, drugs, money, all in that order
Ain't no structure, no peace, we've lost our order
Leaving me with anxiety, fucking up my sobriety (Lil Uzi Vert, yeah)

It's a war zone layin' inside my head
I still think about all my niggas that's dead
I'm too paranoid, yeah, I know you heard what I said
I'm too paranoid, I make sure all my opps they bled
Drainin' all my energy, no, I cannot sleep, uh-huh
I'm affected by the streets, no appetite, I can't eat
I only see red when I see, I think it's my PTSD (gang)
I think it's my PTSD (whoa), I think it's my PTSD, yeah

I turn the news on when I smell death in the air
