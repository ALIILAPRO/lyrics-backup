		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why this car is automatic
It's systematic
It's hydromatic
Why it's grease lightning (grease lightning)

We'll get some overhead lifters, then some four barrel quads, oh yeah
(Keep talking, whoa, keep talking)
A fuel injection cutoff and chrome plated rods, oh yeah
(I'll get the money, I'll kill to get the money)
With a four speed on the floor they'll be waiting at the door
You know that ain't no shit, we'll be getting lots of tit
Grease Lightning
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

Go grease lightning you're burning up the quarter mile
(Grease lightning, go grease lightning)
Go grease lightning you're coasting through the heat lap trials
(Grease lightning go grease lightning)
You are supreme, the chicks'll cream for grease lightning
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

We'll get some purple fringe tail lights and thirty inch fins, oh yeah
(Ooh)
A Palomino dashboard and duel muffler twins, oh yeah
(Ooh)
With new pistols, plugs, and shocks, I can get off my rocks
You know that I ain't bragging, she's a real pussy wagon
Grease lightning
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

Go grease lightning you're burning up the quarter mile
(Grease lightning, go grease lightning)
Go grease lighting you're coasting through the heat lap trials
(Grease lightning, go grease lightning)
You are supreme, the chicks'll cream for grease lightning
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

Go grease lightning you're burning up the quarter mile
(Grease lightning, go grease lightning)
Go, go grease lighting you're coasting through the hit lap trials
(Grease lightning go grease lightning)
You are supreme, the chicks'll cream for grease lightning
Lightning, lightning, lightning
Lightning, lightning, lightning, lightning
Lightning
