		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sitting by the pool, thought that you were through
But every word you say is still all about you
You're inside your head, don't know where you went to
Stories are still the same, still all about you

Came close in the dead of night
Thought I couldn't do it but I knew I was right (ah)
I was right (ah), I was right
Take a sip and you call my bluff
Curt to make me feel like I'm not good enough, ah

Can you hear me now?
It's quiet and you're lonely
Wishing you could hold me, oh oh
Can you hear me now?
I was trying, I was trying
But I'm no longer fighting, oh oh
Can you hear me

I hate it when you're high but I was on your side
Breath it 'til it burns, it's not all about you
Grass beneath my feet, pulling on my teeth
Try to smile but it hurts, can't remember how to

Came close in the dead of night
Thought I couldn't do it but I knew I was right (ah, ah)

Can you hear me now?
It's quiet and you're lonely
Wishing you could hold me, oh oh
Can you hear me now?
I was trying, I was trying
But I'm no longer fighting, oh oh
Can you hear me?

(Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
Can you hear me now?

Last I met, you're letting me down (oh oh oh)
Last I met, you're letting me down (oh oh oh)
Last I met, you're letting me down, oh oh oh

Can you hear me now?
It's quiet and you're lonely (lonely)
Wishing you could hold me, oh oh
Can you hear me now?
I was trying, I was trying (I was trying)
But I'm no longer fighting, oh oh
Can you hear me (now)?

(Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
Can you hear me?
(Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me?
