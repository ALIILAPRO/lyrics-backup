		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Faces skating skyward
Places I could be
Cardboard houses swaying
From that sunlit seas
The creatures creep in thirsty for their fill
To hold me underwater 'till I'm still

I could always try again tomorrow (try again tomorrow)
I might always try again tomorrow (try again tomorrow)

Cement inside my ribcage
Hardening to stone
Too late now it's passed you
Walk the railway tracks until you're home
Tired as the pavements underfoot
(Tired as the pavements underfoot)
Water never stays where it is put

I might always try again tomorrow (try again tomorrow)
I might always try again tomorrow (try again tomorrow)

And each path I'm taking course
Ever alone as night falls (oh oh oh ooh)
Heart's still beating black and blue
Time's still passing, never you

I could always try again tomorrow (try again tomorrow)
I could always try again tomorrow (try again tomorrow)

I could always try again tomorrow (try again tomorrow)
I could always try again tomorrow (try again tomorrow)
