		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song

This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song

Happy to have, not to have not
Big business is very wise
I'm crossing over into
E-enter-prize

Love song
Love song
Love song
Love song

I'm going over to the other side
I'm happy to have not to have not
Big business is very wise
I'm inside free enterprise

I'm adaptable
I'm adaptable

I'm adaptable and I like my new role
I'm getting better and better
And I have a new goal
I'm changing my ways where money applies

This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song

Now are you ready to grab the cradle
That tunnel vision-not television
Behind the curtain-out of the cupboard
YOu take the first train-into the big world
Now will I find you-now will you be there

This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
