		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want a rim shot, hey, digi, digi
The rim shot, hey, come on
I want a rim shot, hey, digi, digi
The rim shot, hey, come on
I want a rim shot, hey, digi, digi
The rim shot, hey, come on
I want a rim shot, hey, digi, digi
The rim shot, hey, come on

I came to hear the band today
I ain't thinking about you
I came to hear my drummer play
Boom-klat-boom-klat
I'm in love with you
Cause of the things you do to me
When you boom-klat-boom-klat

I want a rim shot, hey, digi, digi
The rim shot, hey, come on
I want a rim shot, hey, digi, digi
The rim shot, hey, come on
I want a rim shot, hey, digi, digi
The rim shot, hey, come on
I want a rim shot, hey, digi, digi
The rim shot, hey, come on

Give it to me, give it to me
Boom-klat-boom-klat

Hit your stick up against that drum
I want do it
I want a rim shot
