		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wouldn't mind bein' alone
I wouldn't keep checkin' my phone
Wouldn't take the long way home
Just to drive myself crazy
I wouldn't be losin' sleep
Rememberin' everything
Everything you said to me
Like I'm doin' lately

You
You wouldn't be all
All that I want
Baby, I could let go

If I didn't love you, I'd be good by now
I'd be better than barely gettin' by somehow
Yeah, it would be easy not to miss you, wonder about who's with you
Turn the 'want you' off whenever I want to
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you

I wouldn't still cry sometimes
Wouldn't have to fake a smile
Play it off and tell a lie
When somebody asks how I've been
I'd try to find someone new (someone new)
It should be somethin' I can do (I could do)
Baby, if it weren't for you
I wouldn't be in the state that I'm in

Yeah, you
You wouldn't be all
All that I want
Baby, I could let go

If I didn't love you, I'd be good by now
I'd be better than barely gettin' by somehow
Yeah, it would be easy not to miss you, wonder about who's with you
Turn the 'want you' off whenever I want to
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you (oh, if I didn't love you)

It wouldn't be so hard to see you, know how much I need you
Wouldn't hate that I still feel like I do
If I didn't love you (oh, if I didn't love you)
If I didn't love you (mm)

If I didn't love you, I'd be good by now
I'd be better than barely gettin' by somehow
Yeah, it would be easy not to miss you, wonder about who's with you
Turn the 'want you' off whenever I want to
If I didn't love you (yeah)
If I didn't love you (oh, if I didn't love you)
If I didn't love you (if I didn't love you)
If I didn't love you
