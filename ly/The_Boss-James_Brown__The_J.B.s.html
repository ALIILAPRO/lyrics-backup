Paid the cost to be the boss
Paid the cost to be the boss
I paid the cost to be the boss

Look at me you know what you see
You see a bad mutha
Look at me you know what you see
You see a bad mutha

Paid the cost to be the boss
Paid the cost to be the boss

Look at me you know what you see
You see a bad mutha

Told you so!
Told you so!

Havin' fun, got money to burn
Havin' fun, got money to burn
Havin' fun, got money to burn
Havin' fun, got money to burn

'Cause I paid the cost to be the boss
Paid the cost to be the boss
Paid the cost to be the boss

Caught, tracked, turned my back
Caught, tracked, turned my back

Paid the cost to be the boss
I'm a bad mutha,
I'm a bad mutha

Head for the turn around
Headin' for the turn around
Told you so!

Paid the cost to be the boss
