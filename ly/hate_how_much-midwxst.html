		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me why I shouldn't shouldn't block you
I'm not myself when I'm around you
Know I hate your friends but they surround you
And I heard 'round town that you were bad news
Wish I didn't give you my all
And got something so small in return
But it wasn't your fault
'Cause you didn't ever know your worth

Hate how much I like you (I hate that shit)
How much we fight, too
Can't say what I might do (I hate that shit)
'Cause it's hard to spite you
Hate how much I like you (I hate that shit)
Even though you're bad news
Can't say what I might do (I hate that shit)
But I know I want you

La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (I hate that shit)
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (I hate that shit)
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (I hate that shit)
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (know I hate that shit, know I hate that shit)

And I know that things are messy
Yes I know that I've been busy, of late
We broke up for like the fourth time (fourth time)
Because you said I can't communicate
(And you make me say)

Hate how much I like you (I hate that shit)
Even though you're bad news
Can't say what I might do (get off my dick)
But I know I want you

La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (I hate that shit)
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (I hate that shit)
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (I hate that shit)
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
(Know I hate that shit, know I hate that shit, yeah, I hate that shit)

Hate how much I like you (I hate that shit)
How much we fight, too
Can't say what I might do (I hate that shit)
'Cause it's hard to spite you
Hate how much I like you (I hate that shit)
Even though you're bad news
Can't say what I might do (I hate that shit)
