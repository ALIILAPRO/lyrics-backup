		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Niggas in the club right now
Blowin' on kush gettin' money right now
Niggas don't play right now, got jewels, got cars, got shooters right now

Hundred shooters, undercover, hundred bodies
One hundred shooters, undercover, hundred bodies nigga
Coppin' the whips on these niggas
Don't fuck with don't fuck with, don't fuck with these niggas
Ain't got no love for these niggas, no love, no love, no love for these niggas
I just blow the cash on my young hoe, I just blow some cash on my young hoe
Fuckin' up this cash with my young niggas, fuckin' up some bands with my young niggas

Niggas in the club right now, bitches gettin' high off drugs right now
Got shooters on deck, I call Crips, call Bloods right now
Real niggas back, I'm puttin' on for my haters
We blow money, we throw money at strippers
Niggas in the trap right now, whippin' it till it come back right now
I'm strapped right now, even police get clapped right now
Break a whole brick down, look at all of these bagies
I got your bitch on 5th Ave, I'm daddy

Hundred shooters, undercover, hundred bodies
One hundred shooters, undercover, hundred bodies nigga
Coppin' the whips on these niggas
Don't fuck with don't fuck with, don't fuck with these niggas
Ain't got no love for these niggas, no love, no love, no love for these niggas
I just blow the cash on my young hoe, I just blow some cash on my young hoe
Fuckin' up this cash with my young niggas, fuckin' up some bands with my young niggas

Oh I just got some pounds from the plug
If you ain't gettin' money you a dove
I'm lit right now, bitch recognize who you with right now
I'm the shit right now, look at the flick of the wrist right now
This Audemar cost the price of a New York brick right now
Ski money, I drop a bag and get you hit right now
My bread right now, can't tell me I can't beat the feds right now
If Future don't touch it, bang bang hit you in the head tight now

If Murder don't trust you we gon' shoot you
If Mexico don't trust you we gon' shoot you
Ya Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you
If Brooklyn don't trust you they gon' shoot you

Free Rowdy bitch
Free Bobby bitch

Run up on a nigga like bang bang
Get you popped right now, make a nigga go meet Pac right now

Hundred shooters, undercover, hundred bodies
One hundred shooters, undercover, hundred bodies nigga
Coppin' the whips on these niggas
Don't fuck with don't fuck with, don't fuck with these niggas
Ain't got no love for these niggas, no love, no love, no love for these niggas
I just blow the cash on my young hoe, I just blow some cash on my young hoe
Fuckin' up this cash with my young niggas, fuckin' up some bands with my young niggas

If Murder don't trust you we gon' shoot you
If Mexico don't trust you we gon' shoot you
Ya Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you
If Brooklyn don't trust you they gon' shoot you

Headshots, trap money
The streets watching
But they ain't trippin'

If money come this fast I'm swear to go I'll never spend it
