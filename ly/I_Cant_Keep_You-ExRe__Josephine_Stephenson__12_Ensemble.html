		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh the rain, it's constant
Never mind if I'm awaken
Throwing stones against my windows
Sounds a lot like young love
Yeah, I wouldn't know
I was always terrified of touching
Yeah, I wouldn't know
I always thought my eyes would burn

Then the days become blurring into white
Now I'm drunk and caffeine
I was tryna make a home for myself here to come clean
And I end up writing naked daydreams
Got sober, I spent my rent on
Shimmer-glitter white teeth, hyper-colour self-esteem

In the evenings, and the sight of you in my kitchen
You come around here to get high
And I sometimes find you childish
And I sometimes find you mesmerising
And I one time found your mouth when you open our refrigerator
I can't keep you constant secret, sweetness
And I keep forgetting about it, late
Oh, I keep forgetting about you, hey

Oh the rain, it's constant
Doesn't care If I'm awaken
Throwing stones against my windows
Sounds a lot like young love
Yeah, I wouldn't know
I was always terrified of touching
Yeah, I wouldn't know
I always thought I'd go blind from touching, how sweet

I keep thinking about it, late
I keep thinking about you, hey
