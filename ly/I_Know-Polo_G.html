		  (Pipe that shit up TNT)
(Dmac on the fucking track)
(Tahj Money)
Mmm, mmm, mmm

Bondin' over drugs and pain, dirty Sprite share
My dawg was one of a kind, I know your type rare
I know life is a bitch and she don't fight fair
How the fuck I wake up from a dream to a nightmare?
Left us behind, you seen that light glare
I know you walkin' up to Heaven on them white stairs
Why I can't just pull up to your crib and see you right there?
Nobody love you 'til you dead, that's when they might care

Let's just be friends before we rush into a label
Wanna know if you really for me, girl, what's your angle?
It's only for the better if I'm tryna change you
Lovin' me ain't easy, if you leave, I don't blame you
Trauma got me fucked up, so I'm mentally unstable
I got wrapped up in my emotions, now I'm tangled
Deep in my thoughts and overthinkin' can get painful
Watch how I move, one wrong decision can be fatal
Hidden messages, conversations with my angels
Just walk with me and you'll see I'm tryna save you
Most times I'm by myself I'm still confused from betrayal
From rags to riches, shit's still hard, I'm just on phase two

Bondin' over drugs and pain, dirty Sprite share
My dawg was one of a kind, I know your type rare
I know life is a bitch and she don't fight fair
How the fuck I wake up from a dream to a nightmare?
Left us behind, you seen that light glare
I know you walkin' up to Heaven on them white stairs
Why I can't just pull up to your crib and see you right there?
Nobody love you 'til you dead, that's when they might care

Livin' on his own and he runnin' out of options now
'Cause he felt like he couldn't be his self at his mama house
Hittin' licks, missin' school, junior year he thought 'bout droppin' out
Him against the world, .40 on him when he poppin' out
On his dark road, he just tryna find a proper route
Hate the criticism, he uses music to block it out
By his auntie, he was molested as a baby boy
Messed up his head, it even changed the way he play with toys
Up late night rappin', then they told him to quit makin' noise
Stuck in his feelings, he be spendin' every day annoyed
He wanna stand over a nigga, leave his face destroyed
He miss his hood, now this something that he can't avoid

Bondin' over drugs and pain, dirty Sprite share
My dawg was one of a kind, I know your type rare
I know life is a bitch and she don't fight fair
How the fuck I wake up from a dream to a nightmare?
Left us behind, you seen that light glare
I know you walkin' up to Heaven on them white stairs
Why I can't just pull up to your crib and see you right there?
Nobody love you 'til you dead, that's when they might care
