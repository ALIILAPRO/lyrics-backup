		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wake up in the early mornin', count some paper
Group trap with all my thickies, come through later
Call up all my dawgs and my dentist and my neighbors
Call up Waffle House and tell 'em, "I'ma need it catered"
Everybody slide to my mama's crib
'Cause she pretty much live just how I live
And the crib ain't big, but we gon' get lit
And we gon' get lit

If you got thick ass, bust it out, hit the floor, pass the loud
How'd I get twenty-six hoes at my mama's house?
Mama rollin' big ass blunts, we gon' pass it 'round
Nothin' like a good ol' party at my mama's house
Thick ass, bust it out, hit the floor, pass the loud
How'd I get twenty-six hoes at my mama's house?
Mama rollin' big ass blunts, we gon' pass it 'round
No one at your club 'cause they're all at my mama's house

Ayy, we tryna keep it down but the weed too loud
Shawty wanna hit the threesome now
But it's lookin' more like an eighteen-some now
Sheesh, ayy, ayy
Cops come through and I'm cheesin' out
'Cause me and my team just cleaned the house
So it looks like y'all are peacin' out
And I said, ladies, always keep it clean, baby
Always keep it crisp
Blunts away at three when the mamas bring they kids
Pull up with your team, baby, we ain't got no list
I just copped the Wii, playin' tennis with your

Thick ass, bust it out, hit the floor, pass the loud
How'd I get twenty-six hoes at my mama's house?
Mama rollin' big ass blunts, we gon' pass it 'round
Nothin' like a good ol' party at my mama's house
Thick ass, bust it out, hit the floor, pass the loud
How'd I get twenty-six hoes at my mama's house?
Mama rollin' big ass blunts, we gon' pass it 'round
No one at your club 'cause they're all at my mama's house

Clean up, clean up, everybody clean up
I'm just playin' baby, ayy, let's light that green up
Pancakes and weed for lunch
Lil' bit of Henny and Hawaiian Punch
Gettin' to the bread, Scrooge McDuck
Takin' your wife, Gravy may cut
I tried to keep that shit a secret, but to be real
Your mama hit me up tryna see how it feels
Get that Gravy Train and, to be real
She ain't just have a snap, shawty came for the meal

Ass, bust it out, hit the floor, pass the loud
How'd I get twenty-six hoes at my mama's house?
Mama rollin' big ass blunts, we gon' pass it 'round
Nothin' like a good ol' party at my mama's house
Thick ass, bust it out, hit the floor, pass the loud
How'd I get twenty-six hoes at my mama's house?
Mama rollin' big ass blunts, we gon' pass it 'round
No one at your club 'cause they're all at my mama's house
