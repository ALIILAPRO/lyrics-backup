		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got some Raf and Rick on me you
Know that they ain't did that (Raf)
All these kids they cap in they song
They ain't lived that
Kissing bitches all they got to
Do is kiss ass treat how you like it
I run the bag and I run it back again

Peanutbutter inside coupe it
Look like reese's (Skrr)
I'm a break down the molly into pieces
Put it inside of my Gatorade
And get to geeking (Huh)
Now I know I no-more fucking
Problem for the weekend

Tweakin' off this molly for no reasons
I'm a call somebody
The way I kill this beat I kill
This song I feel like columbine
I only see blue
I guess you could say I'm colorblind
I been working harder every day I
Think I know it's mine

I'm in OT I'm in overtime
Do you need to take a little T
Do you need some time
Way I rhyme, where ya at
Out of town, smoking gas
By the pound, got big bags, large amounts
Now where he at, yeah, find him out

I only smoke exotic, bitch I am so hot
It feel like I'm in the
Carpets, turn this bitch up, yea
Turn it to a moshpit, how we been flexin'
Pull it like It's CrossFit

Had to put an X on my back
I wanted rack rack racks
I got cash on my cash cuz I stare-stare-stare


You count it in blue, now it's Blue's Clues

I keep this guap on me
She taken my dead lottery
I get this guap on me
All these bitches want flock at me
All of these kids they touching my swag
This shouldn't feel like a robbery


Rack on me you know that they ain't did that
All these kids they cap in they song
They ain't lived that
Kissing bitches all they got to
Do is kiss ass


Peanutbutter inside coupe
It look like reese's
I'm a break down the molly into pieces
Put it inside of my Gatorade
And get to geeking
Now I know I no-more fucking
Problem for the weekend

Yo yea yea yo yea yea
