		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey girl, I know this shit might sound crazy
Before you get in bed, though, on those heels
Hey girl, now I know why you waited
Had to be sure that I was worth the thrill
Ladies come and go but you got something different
Had me so addicted from the start
And I'd never known all this loving I'd be missing
If I didn't work my way into your heart

You give me vertigo, vertigo

The bed, the floor, the kitchen
Don't really matter as long as I get

Vertigo, vertigo

I'm tucked, all bottled inside
You're a bad baby, you're making me sweat

Tell me that its cool (cool) that I'm stuck on you (you)
Like your birthday suit (suit)
You give me vertigo, that vertigo

The way that you please me sets this room on fire
I'm burning with desire in this bed
So if I'm dreaming please don't wake me up
If all of this is happening in my head
Waited for so long
But what you got is different
Had me so addicted from the start
Boy, I'd never known all the shit that I was missing
If I hadn't worked my way into your heart

You give me vertigo, vertigo

The bed, the floor, the kitchen
Don't really matter as long as I get

Vertigo, that vertigo

I'm tucked, all bottled inside
You're a bad baby, you're making me sweat

Tell me that it's cool (cool) that I'm stuck on you (you)
Like your birthday suit (suit)
You give me vertigo, (vertigo) that vertigo

I'm working downtown
You all in my head
This love that we found
Well never regret
Were empty inside
I'm filling you up with our vertigo
You waking me up
To nothing to say
Right here in this bed
We stay here all day
And my head be spinning
You do matter in with our vertigo

You give me vertigo, (vertigo) vertigo

The bed, the floor, the kitchen
Don't really matter as long as I get

Vertigo, (vertigo) vertigo

I'm tucked, all bottled inside
You're a bad baby, you're making me sweat

Tell me that it's cool (cool) that I'm stuck on you (you)
Like your birthday suit (suit)
You give me vertigo, vertigo (vertigo)

Say you give me a vertigo vertigo
Baby, oh
Vertigo, vertigo
Say you give me ah
Say you give me ah
Vertigo, that vertigo
