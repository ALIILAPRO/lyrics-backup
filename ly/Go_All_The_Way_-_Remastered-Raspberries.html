		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never knew how complete love could be
'Til she kissed me and said

Baby, please, go all the way
It feels so right (feels so right)
Being with you here tonight
Please, go all the way
Just hold me close (hold me close)
Don't ever let me go

I couldn't say what I wanted to say
'Til she whispered, I love you

So please, go all the way
It feels so right (feels so right)
Being with you here tonight
Please, go all the way
Just hold me close (hold me close)
Don't ever let me go

Before her love
I was cruel and mean
I had a hole in the place
Where my heart should have been

But now I've changed
And it feels so strange
I come alive when she does
All those things to me

And she says
(Come on) Come on
(Come on) 
(Come on) Come on
(Come on)
I need ya (come on)
I love ya (come on)
I need ya (come on)

Please, go all the way
It feels so right (feels so right)
Being with you here tonight
Please, go all the way
Just hold me close (hold me close)
Don't ever let me go no (oh-oh)

Go on baby (oh-oh)
