		  (Billboard Hitmakers)
(Go Griz)
(Hitmaka)
(Squat made the beat)

How the fuck I fall for this shit? Yeah
Niggas gettin' robbed, gettin' hit
If niggas actin' blind to this shit
I had to open up my eyes and get rich, yeah
I might fuck up my money then I'm gon' get it right back
If you fuck with my money then you gon' get hit like that
I grew up in the jungle, grew up where lions fall back
Grew up playin' with 22s, now I got twenty-two straps
Don't be childish, boy you wildin', don't be wildin'
Melodies come out the trap, like na-na-na-na crucify you, get you crossed up (crossed up)

And if they hit, we hitting right back
Yeah, I never lie (I never lie)
And they say money change you, I think they right, yeah (I think they right, yeah)
Yeah, at least I tried (at least I tried)
And even if they miss, we coming right back
Yeah, I never lie (I never lie)
And they say money change you, I think they right, yeah (I think they right, yeah)
Yeah, at least I tried (at least I tried)

Yeah, how the fuck I fall for this shit, yeah
Niggas gettin' robbed, gettin' hit
I try not to get involved in that shit
But I know niggas don't want me to win, yeah
So many shootouts in the park, we must be gifted
They only missed us 'cause they shot from a distance
And we can't let them get us lined by a bitch, yeah
I started thinking with my mind and not my dick, yeah
Stop it, you know that jungle turned me to a monster (monster)
Bunch of young niggas, but we bossed up (bossed up)
We ain't really into taking losses (losses), yeah

And if they hit we hitting right back
Yeah, I never lie (I never lie)
And they say money change you I think they right, yeah (I think they right, yeah)
Yeah, at least I tried (at least I tried)
And even if they miss, we coming right back
Yeah, I never lie (I never lie)
And they say money change you, I think they right, yeah (I think they right, yeah)
Yeah, at least I tried (at least I tried)

Na-na-na-na-na-na
Yeah, at least I tried, tried, tried
At least I tried, yeah
I might fuck up my money then I'm gon' get it right back
If you fuck with my money then you gon' get hit like that
I grew up in the jungle, grew up where lions fall back
Grew up playin' with 22s, now I got twenty-two straps
