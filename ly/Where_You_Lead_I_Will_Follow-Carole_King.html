		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Loving you the way I do
I know we're gonna make it through
And I would go to the ends of the earth
'Cause, darling, to me that's what you're worth

Where you lead, I will follow
Anywhere that you tell me to
If you need, you need me to be with you
I will follow where you lead

If you're out on the road
Feeling lonely, and so cold
All you have to do is call my name
And I'll be there on the next train

Where you lead, I will follow
Anywhere that you tell me to
If you need, you need me to be with you
I will follow where you lead

I always wanted a real home with flowers on the window sill
But if you wanna live in New York City, honey, you know I will
(Yes I will, yes I will)
You never know how it's all gonna turn out, but that's okay
Just as long (just as long) as we're together, we can find a way

And where you lead, I will follow
Anywhere that you tell me to
If you need (if you need), you need me to be with you
I will follow, oh, oh, oh

Where you lead, I will follow
Any-anywhere that you tell me to
If you need (if you need), you need me to be with you
I will follow where you lead
Oh baby, yeah (yeah)

I'm gonna follow where you lead
(I'm gonna follow where you lead)
Ah, I'm gonna follow
I'm gonna follow where you lead
(I'm gonna follow, I'm gonna follow where you lead)
Oh
I'm gonna follow where you lead
(I'm gonna follow where you lead)
Yeah, baby
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna follow where you lead
(I'm gonna follow where you lead)
Oh yeah
Gonna follow where you, where you lead
(I'm gonna follow where you lead)
