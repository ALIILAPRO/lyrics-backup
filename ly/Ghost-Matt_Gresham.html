		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So tell me where you've been
You travelled with the wind for so long
You taught me how to swim
How to drown like a man when things go wrong
A father and a friend
So tell me why you left me here to bleed
Are you teaching me to mend?
I wonder how it feels now you can't breathe

I met your ghost
And the words were stuck in my throat
I met your ghost
And it told me to let you go

I've tried but I can't win
I looked up to you for everythin'
Just know that I won't sin
'Cause your voice is with me
Every time I sing a brother and a friend
So tell me why you left them here to bleed
Are you teaching them to mend?
I wonder how it feels now you can't breathe

I met your ghost
And the words were stuck in my throat
I met your ghost
And it told me to let you go

(Ooh, ooh, ooh oh ooh, ooh)

I met your ghost
And the words were stuck in my throat
I met your ghost
And it told me to let you go
I met your ghost (show me something)
And the words were stuck in my throat
(I need to know)
I met your ghost (show me something)
And it told me to let you go

Show me something i need to know
Show me something i need to know
