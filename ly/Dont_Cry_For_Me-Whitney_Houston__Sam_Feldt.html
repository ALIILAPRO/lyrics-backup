		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here we are again
That old familiar place
Where the winds will blow
No one ever knows the time or space

So don't cry for me
Don't shed a tear
The time I shared with you will always be
And when I'm gone
Please carry on
Don't cry for me

Don't shed a tear

See, no one is to blame, no, no
My death was meant to be
Don't carry guilt or shame
The reason why I came
Soon, you're gonna see

So don't cry for me
Don't shed a tear
The time I shared with you will always be
Hey
When I'm gone
See, life still, life still caries on, oh yes
Don't cry for me

Don't shed a tear
Don't cry, no
Don't cry

Don't cry
Don't cry
For, ooh
Me
