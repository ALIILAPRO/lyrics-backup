		  Hit it!
Aww yea!
Yeah
La-di-da-di, la-di-da-di
La-di, la-di!

You know what? Yo, peep this
La-di-da-di, we like to party
We don't cause trouble, we don't bother nobody
We're just some men that's on the mic
And when we rock upon the mic
We rock the mic (right!)
For all of y'all, keepin' y'all in health
Just to see ya smile and enjoy yourself
'Cause it's cool when you cause a cozy conditionin'
That we create, so that's our mission, so listen
To what we say because this type of shit happens every day
I woke up around ten o'clock in the mornin'
Gave myself a (stretch up), a mornin' yawn and
Went to the bathroom to wash up
Had some soap on my face and my hand upon the cup
I said-a mirror, mirror on the wall
Who is the top choice of them all?
There was a rumble dumble
Five minutes it lasted, the mirror said
(You are, you conceited bastard!)
Yo, that's true, that's why we never have no beef
So then I washed off the soap and brushed the gold teeth
Used Oil of Olay 'cause my skin gets pale
Then I got the files for my fingernails
Due to the night and on my behalf
I put the bubbles in the tub so I could have a bubble bath
Clean, dry, was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new Gucci underwear
For all the girls I might take home
I got the Johnson's baby powder and the Polo cologne
Fresh dressed like a million bucks, threw on the Bally shoes
And the fly green socks
Stepped out the house, stopped short, oh no!
I went back in I forgot the (Kango)
Then I dilly (dally) ran through a (alley)
Bumped into my old girl (Sally) from the (valley)
This is a girl plays hard to get
So I said, "What's wrong?" 'Cause she looked upset
She said, um (it's all because of you)
(Say what?) Uh-huh 
(I'm feeling sad and blue) she said what? 
(You went away) and now, my life is filled with rainy days
And I love you so, how much you'll never know
'Cause you took your love away from me, aha-oh
Now what was I to do?
She's crying over me and she was feeling blue
I said-a, "Don't cry (dry your eye)
Here comes your mother with those two little guys"
Her mean mother stepped up, said to me (hi)
Looked Sally in the face and decked her in the (eye)
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her (feet)
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong, kids was gone
Something was wrong, I said, "What is going on?"
I tried to break it up, I said, "Stop it, leave her"
She said, "If I can't have you (she can't either)"
She grabbed me closely by my socks
So I broke the hell out like I had the chicken pox, but
She gave chase, she caught up quick
She put a finger in the face of MC Rick, she said
(Why don't you give me a play?)
So we can go cruising in my OJ and, what?
(If you give me that OK)
I'll give you all my love today
What? Ricky, Ricky, Ricky, what? (Can't you see?)
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways
Yo, MC Rick my love is here to stay"
Yo, on and on and on she kept on
The bitch been around before my mother's born
I said, "Cheer up!" Gave her a kiss
I said, "You can't have me I'm too young for you, miss"
She said, "No, you're not," then she starts crying
I says, "I'm thirty-four", she said (stop lying)
I said, "I am, go ask my mother
And with that wrinkled pussy, I can't be your lover"
To the tick, tock and you don't stop
To the tick, tick, ya don't quit, hit it!

(That's right, right there, Rick)

Doug E. Fresh y'all, give him a round of applause, y'all
Doug E. Fresh!
Yeah, what up?
