		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh

All aboard, stitch in time
Get yours, got mine
In a minute, I'll be there
Sit tight, get square (tic-tic-tic-tic-tic-tic-tic-tic)
You can do it at the hippodrome (one, one, one, one, one, one more)
Slide back, trombone (wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait)
Anybody got a TV at home? (one, one, one, one, one, one more)
That's right, unknown

When I pick up on that smell, pick it up and run like hell
Little woman, save me some, better get up on your run
(Huh)

So much more than
Charlie's wakin' me
To my core and
And Charlie's shakin' me
And tell my story
And Charlie's makin' me
And Charlie's makin' me smile
Oh, whoa, now

(Tic-tic-tic-tic-tic-tic-tic-tic-tic)
(One, one, one, one, one, one more)
(Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait)
(One, one, one, one, one, one more)

Everybody do the twist
Get the message on Flea's fists
Move around like a scientist
Lay down, get kissed (tic-tic-tic-tic-tic-tic-tic-tic)
Big picture and it never lies (one, one, one, one, one, one more)
Big daddy will advice (wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait)
EverReady in disguise (one, one, one, one, one, one more)
Sunset, sunrise

When I pick up on that smell, pick it up and run like hell
Little woman, save me some, better get up on your run

Huh

So much more than
Charlie's wakin' me
To my core and
And Charlie's shakin' me
And tell my story
And Charlie's makin' me
And Charlie's makin' me smile
Whoa-whoa, now

My heart, your skin
This love, I'm in
We don't arrive without a surprise
You're right, I'm wrong
Be free, belong
Intimate sight has come into light

When I pick up on that smell, pick it up and run like hell
Little woman, save me some, better get up on your run
All I ever wanted to was pick it up and run with you
Slip into a summer spell, double up and run like hell

Huh

So much more than
Charlie's wakin' me
To my core and
And Charlie's shakin' me
And tell my story
And Charlie's makin' me
And Charlie's makin' me smile
No, whoa, now

My heart, your skin
This love, I'm in
We don't arrive without a surprise
You're right, I'm wrong
Be free, belong
Intimate sight has come into light
My heart, your skin
This love, I'm in
We don't arrive without a surprise
You're right, I'm wrong
Be free, belong
Intimate sight has come into light
