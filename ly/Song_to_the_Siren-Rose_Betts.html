		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Long afloat on shipless oceans
I did all my best to smile
'Til your singing eyes and fingers
Drew me loving to your isle
And you sang
Sail to me
Sail to me, let me enfold you
Here I am, here I am
Waiting to hold you

Did I dream you dreamed about me?
Were you here when I was forced out?
Now my foolish boat is leaning
Broken lovelorn on your rocks
For you sing
Touch me not, touch me not
Come back tomorrow
And oh, my heart, oh, my heart
Shies from the sorrow

Well, I'm as puzzled as a newborn child
I'm as riddled as the tide
Should I stand amid the breakers
Or should I lie with death my bride?
Hear me sing
Swim to me
Swim to me, let me enfold you
Here I am, here I am
Waiting to hold you
