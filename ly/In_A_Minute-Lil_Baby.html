		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Damn, Kai, you goin' crazy)

I be in the loop, she be in a group (yeah)
Brodie want her friend, throw him alley-oop (yeah)
Turn somethin' to nothin', bruh, I'm livin' proof
How can I lose when we the who's who's?
Still runnin' 'round with Mohawk
Jet ready, pack the Goyard
People probably think I show off, I ain't even give it yet
Runnin' up a silly check, stayin' off the internet
Share the stage with Billie Eilish, turnt at any given time
Personal partners pillow talkin' 'cause I got rich without 'em
Only thing they should be sayin' is, "Baby keep it solid"
We ain't even deep as we used to be, this shit slick, divided
Bruh ain't got no hustle or nothin', so he gon' stick to violence
I be known to run down, I'm dialed in, so I can't speak about it
She know I'm a gangsta, she love me, I bring the freak up out her
Can't play with me, you know I'll come trim, I'm in a different league
I'm tired of showin' what I can get done, what you gon' do for me?
Forty thousand miles up in the air, only time I get some Z's
Full-court press, foot on they neck and I can't let 'em breathe
Blood, sweat and tears come with this check, it ain't nowhere near easy
Had to fall back, you know how that go, we only speakin' briefly
Hope I'm not too much to handle, city nigga from Atlanta
I spent my last check on ammo, this is not a regular Lambo
Hundred thousand dollar kit, could've put down on another Lambo
Don't be in the mix, I built this shit forever havin' say so
This shit gon' get serious about my money, this ain't no fuckin' Play-Doh
Brodie down for double homicide, I try to tell him, "Lay low"
C don't like to drive, but he spin good, I'm on the way to Clayco
AK-47s in the spots before they made the Draco

I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mil', I'm callin' dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grindin' still, I need equity to sign the deal

I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mil', I'm callin' dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grindin' still, I need equity to sign the deal

Over-buyin' cars, I snatch the Brabus just for motivation
Shootout at the spot today, tomorrow, we at a new location
Free all of the guys, I hope y'all beat the case or get probation
Stash it at my mama house, four hundred bands in the ventilation
Now look how I'm livin', I bought a house for the money to stay at
Right when niggas think that I got soft, I'ma pull up and spray at
Livin' like a don, might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach
Pull up like your mama with this switch, "Why the fuck would you say that?"
You can do it first, I'ma do it worst, gotta double the pay back
Never take it personal, show no mercy, bro taught me that way back
Condo to get off, I was always taught don't tell your hoes where you stay at
Keep a stash house, you can't take nothin' to the spot where you lay at
Never be a bother, if you off me, no problem, just say that
Never runnin' off, so if I owe you, I got you, I'll pay that
Give this shit my all, so when I'm old, I can chill and just lay back
Really from the bottom so the trenches is where I feel safe at

I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mil', I'm callin' dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grindin' still, I need equity to sign the deal

I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mil', I'm callin' dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grindin' still, I need equity to sign the deal
