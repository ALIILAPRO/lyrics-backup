		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He treat me like a ho, take me to Rodeo
He buy me Valentino, Tokyo to Rio
He treat me like a ho, take me to Rodeo
He know I need a lotta Gucci, Fendi, Prada

Ooh, daddy, daddy
Gimme baggies
I need a Birkin
Get to workin'
Ooh, daddy, daddy
I need a lot of, a lot of commas
A lot of drama, yeah

Make them other bitches mad
He put me in the Lambo
He put you in the cab, yeah
Make them other bitches sad
He put me on the payroll
He made you pay the tab

He treat me like a ho, take me to Rodeo
He buy me Valentino, Tokyo to Rio
He treat me like a ho, take me to Rodeo
He know I need a lotta Gucci, Fendi, Prada

Bling, bling-a-bling, bling
I need a ring-ring
A big ol' diamond, that's your assignment
Ding, ding-a-ling, ling
I need a big thing, a super-sizer
I need a riser, yeah

Make them other bitches mad
He put me in the Lambo
He put you in the cab, yeah
Make them other bitches sad
He put me on the payroll
He made you pay the tab

He treat me like a ho, take me to Rodeo
He buy me Valentino, Tokyo to Rio
He treat me like a ho, take me to Rodeo
He know I need a lotta Gucci, Fendi, Prada

He treat me like a ho
(Like a ho)
He treat me like a ho
