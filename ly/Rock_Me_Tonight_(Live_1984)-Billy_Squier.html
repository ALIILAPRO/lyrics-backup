		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm rockin' tonite - I'm walkin' on air
Gonna find me some trouble - gonna grab my share
I want ya tonite - I want ya with me
Make me guilty of love in the first degree

You want it all right... we're goin' in style
Say you walk right - you talk right - and your hair's so wild
Snow-white - hey that's not what I mean
We go down in the shadows and crawl between

Moonlight in the city brings the magic to your eyes
Freezin' a moment - leave me paralyzed
Breathe an emotion - set it dancin' in my ear
Bring on the rhythm when I hold you near

[Chorus]
Take me in your arms - roll me through the night
Take me to your heart - rock me tonight

You do it all right - you're passion to see
You been schooled in the art of romancin' me
Hold tight - you're in for a ride
Can you feel the blood poundin' way down inside

No one's stoppin' us now -
We go down, down where the music's loud
If it's all night - hey that's all right by me
Go and play on my love - play it all for me

Life's never easy - we can make it if we try
Takin' our chances - face 'em side by side
Live for the moment - on that we can agree
Come and take me where I long to be

[Chorus]
A time for all... and all in time
To slip beyond the border line
Of who we are and where we long to be...
When every night you hear the sound
Of wakin' up and breakin' down
You find a chance and heave it all away

[Chorus]
