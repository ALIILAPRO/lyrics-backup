		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

Nobody ever loved me like she does
Ooh, she does, yeah, she does
And if somebody loved me like she do me
Ooh, she do me, yes, she does

Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

I'm in love for the first time
Don't you know it's gonna last
It's a love that lasts forever
It's a love that has no past

Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

And from the first time that she really done me
Ooh, she done me, she done me good
I guess nobody ever really done me
Ooh, she done me, she done me good

Don't let me down, hey
Don't let me down
Yee-hee (don't let me down)
Don't let me down

Yee-hee (yeah, ow)
(Ow, don't let me down)
(Ow, don't let me down, baby)
(Don't let me down)
(Can you dig it? Yeah)
(Don't let me down)
