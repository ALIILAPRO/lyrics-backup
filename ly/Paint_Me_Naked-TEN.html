		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heartbeat going crazy (yeah)
They say we should fall in line
Saying we're too young to stay in love
They got issues with us staying in love
But-a we're just far too crazy, yeah

So baby don't tame me
You found a lion, uh, you prey me
Oh, baby don't fail me
'Cause you really make my fancy work

So tell me where you wanna take it?
I'm your figure, you could paint me naked
Like a picture, I can see our love running wild
Baby, be my weekend

Love the way you posing when we painting, yeah
Lookin' at you, girl, I can't control it
Everybody betting that we don't make it
Guess we gotta leave it up to luck now, yeah

Can't stop, make me wanna rev right now
Redline, keep it going, lovebound
Now drop-top feeling got the windows down
Nothing else matters, only us right now
'Cause everybody's all for good intentions
Baby, all I really want is your attention
You're my beat now, playing on repeat, our love
And nothing can go wrong, living a love song, yeah

Let me show you the way
I'll be your high-beams in the rain
Blast off, going outer space
'Cause you really make my fancy work

So tell me where you wanna take it?
I'm your figure, you could paint me naked
Like a picture, I can see our love running wild
Baby, be my weekend

Love the way you posing when we painting, yeah
Lookin' at you, girl, I can't control it
Everybody betting that we don't make it
Guess we gotta leave it up to luck now, yeah

Miles away, far from what they would say about us
I'm not afraid 'cause this feeling has changed, oh, oh
From luck to fate, I'll bet on our love every day
Don't care 'bout what people say (what people say)

So tell me where you wanna take it?
I'm your figure, you could paint me naked
Like a picture, I can see our love running wild
Baby, be my weekend

Love the way you posing when we painting, yeah (when we painting)
Lookin' at you, girl, I can't control it (no, I can't control it, yeah, yeah)
Everybody betting that we don't make it (oh whoa, oh whoa)
We don't have to leave it up to luck now, yeah
