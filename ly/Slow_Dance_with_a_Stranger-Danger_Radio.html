Call in the cavalry
Uh, tonight
You're makin' it so hard to breathe
Every time, you wrap your arms around me

Breakdown
Girl, you know I'm feelin' you
There's no sound
Except for when our bodies move
What have I got myself into?

Girl you make me feel like I'm walkin' into danger
(mmm but I don't really care)
Girl I think I'm ready for a slow dance with a stranger
(And I want you to take me there)

mmm? I think I'm ready for it
Girl you know I can't ignore it
Step on the gas let's floor it
Everything you want and more, cause
Girl I think I'm ready for a slow dance with a stranger

Right now
My heart is beating out my chest
Goin' down
Yeah I'm the one that does you best
Round and round
You're makin' me obsessed, got one request

Lay back
Let me take the driver's seat
It's a fact
That you make my life complete
I'll attack
You're every fantasy, baby

Girl you make me feel like I'm walkin' into danger
(mmm but I don't really care)
Girl I think I'm ready for a slow dance with a stranger
(And I want you to take me there)

mmm I think I'm ready for it
Girl you know I can't ignore it
Step on the gas let's floor it
Everything you want and more, cause
Girl I think I'm ready for a slow dance with a stranger

No I never saw it comin'
I should be up and running
Instead of walking right back into danger, danger, danger

But you can keep me up all night
Can't let you out of my sight
I want another slow dance with a stranger, stranger, stranger

Girl you make me feel like I'm walkin' into danger
(mmm but I don't really care)
Girl I think I'm ready for a slow dance with a stranger
(And I want you to take me there)

Girl you make me feel like I'm walkin' into danger
(mmm but I don't really care)
Girl I think I'm ready for a slow dance with a stranger
(And I want you to take me there)

mmm I think I'm ready for it
Girl you know I can't ignore it
Step on the gas let's floor it
Everything you want and more, cause
Girl I think I'm ready for a slow dance with a stranger
