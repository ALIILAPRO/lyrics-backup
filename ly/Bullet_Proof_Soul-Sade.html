		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was so in love with you
You rarely see a love that true
Wasn't that enough for you?
Wasn't that enough for you?

I would climb a mountain
I wouldn't want to see you fall
Rock climb for you
And give you a reason for it all

You kept on thinking
You were the only one
Too busy thinking
Love is a gun

Hit me like a slow bullet
Like a slow bullet
It took me some time to realize it

You kept on thinking
You were the only one
Too busy thinking
Love is a gun

I know the end before the story's been told
It's not that complicated
But you're gonna need a bulletproof soul

You kept on thinking
You were the only one
Too busy thinking (you were too busy thinking)
Love is a gun

I know the end before the story's been told
It's not that complicated
But you're gonna need a bulletproof soul

You were trigger-happy, baby
You never warned me, let me free
It's not that complicated
But you're gonna need a bulletproof soul
They got it, but you got all the trouble you need
I came in like a lamb
But I intend to leave like a lion

It hit me like a slow bullet
It hit me like a slow bullet
