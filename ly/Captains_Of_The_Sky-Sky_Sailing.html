		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mid air
I woke up beneath the flight deck
On the wall paper airplane
As you stare
I strap my helmet on and left your driveway behind

[Chorus]
Flutter all through the night
And we can blow the clouds around
This paper hanger skyline
Summer smile again
And you can disappear
But I'd rather be here

Dive bomb
We descended down the stair case
And crashed to the kitchen floor
So long
Our flight of downy dreams
Preened our soft paper wings

[Chorus]

Hello down there
The morning made of singers
In the air
Keeping the midnight stars
Held high
We are captains of the sky
Waving goodbye

Hello down there
The morning made of singers
In the air
Keeping the midnight stars
Held high
We are captains of the sky
Waving goodbye
