(Sweet Soca Music)

Soca what we love and what we need.
Sweet Soca is what the whole world need.
It's sellin' out fast, I just can't believe.
I soca live, England start grief! Again.

Soca what we love and what we need.
Sweet Soca is what the whole world need.
It's sellin' out fast, I just can't believe.
I soca live,

Trinidad start grief because uh
Them want to get high tonight
Wave uh the flags up in uh the air
All night an' uh free up 'em body
And do the things that they like an' uh,
Been far, what will she uh whine
All night an' uh, raise off
She ain't uh see we lead the sunlight an' uh
Now drink your beer man,
Yeah, drink your Sprite and uh,
That's the way of me she love
An' uh soca she likin' uh,
Oh uh no fussing and fighting uh,
Sweet soca music tonight an' uh

Sweet soca what the young girl need
Sweet Soca what she love and what she need
Sweet soca what the young girl need
Sweet soca what she love and what she need

Come wave your flags up in uh the air,
Come wave your hands up in uh the air.
Come wave your flag, come wave her up!
Trinidad mad.

Come wave your flags up in uh the air,
Come wave your hands up in uh the air.
Come wave your flag, come wave her up!
To be go bad. Again.

Soca what we love and what we need.
Sweet soca is what the whole world need.
It's sellin' out fast, I just can't believe.
I soca live, England start grief! Again.

Soca what we love and what we need.
Sweet soca is what the whole world need.
It's sellin' out fast, I just can't believe.
I soca live, today must start grief!

She call my Trinidad, to kill 'im with the whine
She whine so unique, some boy can't keep in time.
She acts like a muffy, well humble and kind,
Form one line, and come behind
Me, said the way you move your body girl,
Move you is slime,
In this sweet soca music, yeah you look fine
With your flag up in uh the air
One more time, make me kill you with the whine
Kill you with whine. Again.

Soca what we love and what we need.
Sweet soca is what the whole world need.
It's sellin' out fast, I just can't believe.
I soca live, England start grief! Again.

Soca what we love and what we need.
Sweet soca is what the whole world need.
It's sellin' out fast, I just can't believe.
I soca live.

Sweeeeeeeeeeeeeet soca music oh oh
Sweeeeeeeeeeeeeet soca music 

Come wave your flag, come wave her up,
Trinidad mad. Again.

Soca what we love and what we need.
Sweet soca is what the whole world need.
It's sellin' out fast, I just can't believe.
I soca live, England start grief! Again.

Soca what we love and what we need.
Sweet soca is what the whole world need.
It's sellin' out fast, I just can't believe.
I soca live. You need to start grief! Again.
