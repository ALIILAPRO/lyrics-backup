		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a heavy metal warrior, restless son of a bitch
A weapon of destruction with both hands on the switch
Walk right through the fire with venom in my veins
Breaking down the doors, kicking ass and taking names

Striking just like lightning, forward without fear
Don't think twice about it, never shed a tear
Stalk like a chameleon, hiding in plain sight
You won't see me coming, too late just say goodnight

I'm a man on a mission
You'll never kill me
And I'm a man with a vision
You're too blind to see

I'm too mean to die
I'm too mean to die
Spit right in your eye

Poison and infection, parasites and pain
Can't live within me, they all go up in flames
Powered by adrenaline, vengeance is the creed
Focused like a pit bull, satisfaction guaranteed

I'm a man on a mission
You'll never kill me
And I'm a man with a vision
You're just too blind to see

I'm too mean to die
I'm too mean to die
I've got to live forever
I'm too mean to die
Too mean to die

You can't kill me
I was born to survive
Got the heart of a lion
I'm a cat with nine lives

I'm too mean to die
Too mean to die
I'm too mean to die
I just might live forever
I'm too mean to die
Too mean to die
