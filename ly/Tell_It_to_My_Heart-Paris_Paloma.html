		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't work you out
Are you thinking 'bout something better?
Holding onto you
While you drag me through stormy weather
The only time you smile is in photographs
And when I pull you close
It's like you're holding back
Before we turn to strangers
Trying to love in the dark
Tell it to my heart i can't keep guessing
If it's me you're missing
Tell it to my heart
The sound of silence is the place we're dying

Before our light goes out
Comе and tell me now if something's fading
Bеcause I can feel it in
Every single thing that you're not saying
You move close to me but I can feel a space
Whatever time we have i'm not going to waste
Before we turn to strangers
Trying to love in the dark

Tell it to my heart i can't keep guessing
If it's me you're missing
Tell it to my heart
The sound of silence is the place we're dying
Tell it to my heart
(Tell it to my, tell it to my)
Tell it to my heart
(Tell it to my, tell it to my heart)
