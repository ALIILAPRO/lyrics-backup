		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's days I feel so small
Feel like I've lost control
These lonely days never end
Try to turn down the noise
It's hard to hear my voice
When it's all in my head

When you're feeling down and out
Life is for the here and now

So get out of your head
And into your heart
The road is never too far
Love's what it takes
It's who we are
So keep running back
Running back to your heart

Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Running back

When people say you can't
When they say that you won't
Prove to them who is right, oh
They say that there's no chance
I'm gonna take my stand
I'm always up for the fight, oh

When you're feeling down and out
Life is for the here and now

So get out of your head
And into your heart
The road is never too far
Love's what it takes
It's who we are
So keep running back
Running back to your heart

I don't want what you have, no, no
Yeah, I know what I need
To take all this love inside and set it free

Oh-yeah

So get out of your head
And into your heart
The road is never too far
Love's what it takes
It's who we are
So keep running back
Running back to your heart

Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Running back to your heart
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Running back to your heart
