		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's fine
Fine, fine, fine, fine
It's alright

I had a dream last night
That the world stopped turning
But your madness, it kept on
Guess I wasn't too bright
And I really wasn't learning
Should have seen it all along

All those sweet (sweet) sweet kisses (yeah)
And those sweet (sweet) red roses (yeah)
They convinced me it was you
I made you (you) exclusive (yeah)
Now it's so (now it's conclusive that) conclusive
That you wasn't doin' it too

[Chorus]
If ya told me from the start
That you played around, I woulda been fine
Then I woulda played too
And I guess I woulda had a good time
If ya told me from the start
That you played around, I woulda been fine
Then I woulda played too
And I guess I woulda had a good time

Something didn't feel right
And I wish I knew it
I just could not see your games
I got respect for you
And you put me through it
Why would you bring me so much pain

I would stick up for you
'Cause I did (I did adore you) adore you
While my dogs would chew you out
Tried to be so nice
On those lonely 
(On those lonely lonely lonely nights) nights
But I should have figured you out

[Chorus]

Baby you're so fine
(You are the one that I love)
You are so fine
(Your love was sent from above)
You are so, you're fine, fine, fine, fine
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine (so doggone fine)
You are so fine
Fine (your love was sent from above)
Oh you're all of mine
You're fine, fine, fine, fine, 
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine (so doggone fine)
Fine (you are the one that I love)
Fine (your love was sent from above)
You're fine, fine, fine, fine
Fine, five, fine, fine, fine (so doggone fine)

[Chorus]
