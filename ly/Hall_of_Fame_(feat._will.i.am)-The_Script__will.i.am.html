		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, you could be the greatest
You can be the best
You can be the King Kong banging on your chest

You could beat the world
You could beat the war
You could talk to God, go banging on his door

You can throw your hands up
You can beat the clock
You can move a mountain
You can break rocks
You can be a master
Don't wait for luck
Dedicate yourself and you can find yourself

Standing in the hall of fame
And the world's gonna know your name
'Cause you burn with the brightest flame
And the world's gonna know your name
And you'll be on the walls of the hall of fame

You could go the distance
You could run the mile
You could walk straight through hell with a smile

You could be the hero
You could get the gold
Breaking all the records that thought, never could be broke

Do it for your people
Do it for your pride
How you ever gonna know if you never even try?

Do it for your country
Do it for you name
'Cause there's gonna be a day

When your, standing in the hall of fame
And the world's gonna know your name
'Cause you burn with the brightest flame
And the world's gonna know your name
And you'll be on the walls of the hall of fame

Be a champion, be a champion, be a champion, be a champion

On the walls of the hall of fame

Be students, be teachers
Be politicians, be preachers

Be believers, be leaders
Be astronauts Be champions
Be truth seekers

Be students, be teachers
Be politicians, be preachers

Be believers, be leaders
Be astronauts, be champions

Standing in the hall of fame
And the world's gonna know your name
'Cause you burn with the brightest flame
And the world's gonna know your name
And you'll be on the walls of the hall of fame

(You can be a champion) You could be the greatest, you can be the best
(You can be a champion)You can be the King Kong banging on your chest
You could beat the world (you can be a champion)
You could beat the war (you can be a champion)
You could talk to God, go banging on his door (you can be a champion)

You can throw your hands up (you can be a champion)
You can beat the clock (you can be a champion)
You can move a mountain (you can be a champion)
You can break rocks (you can be a champion)

You can be a master (you can be a champion)
Don't wait for luck (you can be a champion)
Dedicate yourself and you can find yourself (you can be a champion)
Standing in the hall of fame (you can be a champion)
