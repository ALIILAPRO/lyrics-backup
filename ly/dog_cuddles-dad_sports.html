		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you waiting for the day I'm gone
I'll wait for you
Just like you'd do
My pillows are all wasted I'm on fire
I wish I knew
Just like you knew

So now don't leave
I feel like I'm waiting for you
Please now don't leave
I feel like I'm waiting for you

Are you ever wasted on your own
How does it feel
It's so surreal
That I will never be the one you hold
Into the clear
I'll disappear

So now don't leave
I feel like I'm waiting for you
(I don't wanna go)
Please now don't leave
I feel like I'm waiting for you
(I don't wanna go)
So now don't leave
I feel like I'm waiting for you
(I don't wanna go)
Please now don't leave
I feel like I'm waiting for you
(I don't wanna go)
