		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm fucked up, you fucked up
I'm wondering what we're going to do
Stuck in here, like a million tears
You cry to me and I cry to you
Empty hearts in an empty room
If you want I'll stay with you
Keep it low, ain't nobody know
All the broken shit we're going through
I know the rights and the wrongs
You're upset cause I'm gone
Girl you've got to stay strong
I'm just trying to move on
Now I'm all on my own
Call you when I get home
You ain't pick up that phone
I'm sorry I'll leave you alone
It's always back and forth
I think we've run our course
I'm tired of applying force
You're tired of slamming doors
No longer keeping scores
On all these drinks I've poured
I'll leave just like before
Even if I miss you more
I tried with you but now my patience's running empty
Hope you find it in your heart to forgive me
We can try again but only if you let me
Feels like I got the whole world up against me
I know what it takes to feel lonely
Know I'm only leaving cause you told me
Girl I miss you and the old me
All these memories fading slowly
