		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby
These pretty moments take me
They take me back to you babe
I can't imagine
Why we'd leave
Why'd we leave
No one's gonna love you like I love you
But you do, but you do, but you do
No one's gonna love you like I love you
But you do, but you do, yeah you do
No one's gonna do all the things you do
For me
Baby
These pretty moments make me
They make me happy with you babe
I wish that we could
Stay this way
Stay this way
No one's gonna love you like I love you
But you do, but you do, yeah you do
No one's gonna love you like I love you
But you do, but you do, but you do
No one's gonna do all the things you do
For me
But hopefully there can be
A silver lining at the end
Of these memories
No one's gonna love you
Like I love you
Baby
These pretty moments take me
They take me back to you babe
I can't imagine
Why we'd leave
Why'd you leave
No one's gonna love you like I love you
But you don't, but you don't, no you don't
No one's gonna love you like I love you
But you don't, no you don't, no you don't
No one's gonna love you like I love you
But you don't, you don't
So I guess this is the end
