		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Speak about Greenly
Now that she's gone
Take my time when I go to bed
And I sleep, Lord
I'm getting over
Rolling over
I said can you just wait
To tell me in the morning? 

Slow it down
Slow it down
Lay it low
Save it for the morning

I know that you would like
Like to change me 
Make me softer
Tune your voice like a baby
I'm using caution
Bet you wanted
I wish you could wait
To tell me in the morning

Slow it down
Slow it down
Lay it low
Save it for the morning

I shouted questions
Like a fierce fire
You tried to take me by the arm 
Into the light
I'm almost over
Rolling over
I said could you just wait
To tell me in the morning?

Slow it down
Slow it down
Lay it low
Save it for the morning

And I'll tell you one more thing
I confess to self deception
Pull the lock and pry it open
They're pretending to be stolen
I am my own thief in the night

Struck up for mnay years
Just to get here
Between the humility
And be my own teacher
I guess it backfired 
'cause my motive
Was just to take and
Never kept that way I guess

Slow it down
Slow it down
Lay it low
Save it for the morning

I shouted questions
Like a fierce fire 
You tried to take me into your arms and lead me to the light
I'm almost over
Rolling over
I said could you just wait
To tell me in the morning?

Slow it down
Slow it down
Lay it low
Save it for the morning 

And I'll tell you one more thing
I confess to self deception
Pull the lock and pry it open
They're pretending to be stolen
And I am my own thief in the night
