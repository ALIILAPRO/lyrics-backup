		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mr. Snowman, come home with me
I can make you a warm cup of peppermint tea
But I know that this might be a silly dream
'Cause in time you will melt away
Maybe I was never meant to be loved
If I can't even give a warm touch
Maybe I am just a little bit too much
But I could really use a warm hug
Mr. Snowman, come join me inside
I can turn on the AC, I really don't mind
I can build us an igloo of snow and ice
Don't you worry 'bout melting away
Maybe we are all meant to be loved
And we could all use a warm touch
Maybe we are all a little bit too much
I think you and I are enough
Mr. Snowman, come join me inside (I think I'll join you inside)
It's refreshingly freezing, it's really quite nice (Who needs the summertime?)
I can make you a bingsoo with sweet red bean
Let our worries all melt away
