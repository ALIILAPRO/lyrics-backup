		  Line, hit my line
Line, hit my line, line
Line, hit my line
Line, hit my line, line

I heard you got a nigga but you don't wanna be with him
No, you don't
And if he fuckin' your mood up, you don't gotta leave with him
Fuck that, no more
Why the bad ones always find a waste of time?
I can't understand it
And tell me why the wack niggas always be the first in line
Girl, do you need for me to handle that for ya?

First night, I bought a link, all diamond
T-Try it on
I keep a bad bitch shinin'
Girl, it's you that I'm thinkin' 'bout wifin'
Nice, just my type
Get your life

Tear the roof up, I like it
Tryna be on what you on tonight
Baby gave me that fruit punch, she spiked it
Feels right bein' wrong tonight, come here
Hi, hit my line (my line, oh, yeah)
Girl, I need that more than one time
Hi-hi, hit my line (my line)
Girl, I'm tryna fuck your head up

Tell me, baby, how you want it (yeah)
Side to side (yeah)
Let me upgrade you, supersize (yeah)
It's only the appetizer, so don't fill your plate up
Baby, not yet
I'ma get you them shoes he ain't get for you (get for you)
Get you that coupe that you been wantin' (wantin')
Fuck you in a house that you wanna live in
Different type of nigga that you gotta deal with
That's life

First night, hit her with that Frankie Lymon (da-da-da-da-da)
Now she curve that nigga, stiff arm, hit the Heisman (excuse me, woo)
Damn, my girl fly, she perfect, priceless
All she did was take that flight
Get your life

Baby, tear the roof up, I like it (oh, yeah)
Tryna be on what you on tonight (oh)
Baby gave me that fruit punch, she spiked it (she spiked it)
Feels right bein' wrong tonight, come here
Hi, hit my line (my line, oh, yeah)
Girl, I need that more than one time (more than one)
Hi-hi, hit my line (my line, ooh)
Girl, I'm tryna fuck your head up

Hi, hit my line
Girl, I'm tryna fuck your head up
Hi-hi, hit my line
Girl, I'm tryna fuck your head up

Come here, baby, all you gotta do is hit my line, my line, my line
Baby gave me that fruit punch, she spiked it (all you gotta do is)
Hi, hit my line
Get your life

Tear the roof up (huh), I like it (ooh)
Tryna be on what you on tonight (oh-na-na)
Baby gave me that fruit punch, she spiked it (yeah, ooh)
Feels right bein' wrong tonight, bring it closer, baby
Hi, hit my line
Girl, I need that more than one time (hi)
Hi, hit my line
Girl, I'm tryna fuck your head up (fuck your, fuck your head up)

Hi, hit my line
