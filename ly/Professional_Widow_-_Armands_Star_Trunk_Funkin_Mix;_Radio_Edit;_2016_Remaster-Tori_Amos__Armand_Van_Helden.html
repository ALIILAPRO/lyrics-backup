		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Slag pit, stag shit
Honey bring it close to my lips
Yes
Don't blow those brains yet
We gotta be big boy
We gotta be big
Starfucker just like my daddy
Starfucker just like my daddy
Selling his baby
Just like mydaddy
Gonna strike a deal make him feel like a Congressman
Running in a family
It's run in a family

Rest your shoulders peaches and cream
Everywhere a Judas as far as you can see
Beautiful angel
Calling we got every re-run of Muhammed Ali

Prism perfect
Honey bring it close to your lips
Yes
What is termed a landslide of principle
Proportion boy it's gotta be big
I said it better be big boy
Starfucker just like mydaddy, yes
Starfucker just like mydaddy, yes
Selling his baby
Just like yourdaddy
Selling his baby
Gonna strike a deal make him feel
Like a Congressman
It's running in a family
It's run in a family
Hey, it's running in a family, hey baby
It's run in a family

Mother Mary
China white
Brown may be sweeter
May be sweeter
Mother Mary
China white
Brown may be sweeter
She will supply
She will supply
She will supply
She will supply
Supply, supply

Give me peace, love
Peace, love
Give me peace, love
And a hard cock
