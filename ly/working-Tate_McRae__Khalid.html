		  (We're not working, working, oh)

It's a feeling that I can't explain
That I miss you more when I'm away
And I swear I've been counting the days (oh)
But when you're here I think I need some space
Well shit, we've always had good conversations or we used to
But I haven't been serious since high school
Maybe I'm the one to blame, mm
But in real life it's not the same, no

And when I'm working (yeah)
You're the only one that I want
But we're not working (no)
Yeah, I told you from the start
I'm not perfect (oh)
Yeah, that's why you like me so much
We're not working (yeah)
We're not working, no

La-da, da, da-da, da
La-da, da, da-da, da, da
La-da, da, da-da, da
La-da, da, da-da, da, da

You say all we need is time (all we need is time, yeah)
I don't wanna dim your light
But I can't say I'm an introvert (no, I can't)
The timing's right, we just don't work (don't work no more)

Oh, oh, I don't mean to be rude (mean to be rude)
Still got a thing for you
But I gotta tell the truth, yeah
Oh, oh, no more leading you on
That's wrong
So wrong

And when I'm working (yeah, yeah)
You're the only one that I want
But we're not working (no)
I told you from the start
I'm not perfect, no (oh)
That's why you like me so much
But we're not working (yeah)
We're not working
We're not working

La-da, da, da-da, da
La-da, da, da-da, da, da
We're not working, working, no (la-da, da, da-da, da)
La-da, da, da-da, da, da
La-da, da, da-da, da
La-da, da, da-da, da, da
We're not working, working, no (la-da, da, da-da, da)

No
I don't mean to be rude (don't mean to be rude)
Still got a thing for you
I gotta tell the truth, oh
No more leading you on
That's wrong
So wrong

And when I'm working (when I'm working, no)
You're the only one that I want
But we're not working (shawty, we're not working)
I told you from the start
I'm not perfect (no) (yeah)
That's why you like me so much (yeah, yeah)
But we're not working (no)
We're not working
We're not working

La-da, da, da-da, da (yeah)
La-da, da, da-da, da, da
We're not working, working, no (la-da, da, da-da, da)
La-da, da, da-da, da, da
La-da, da, da-da, da (oh)
La-da, da, da-da, da, da
We're not working, working, no (la-da, da, da-da, da)
