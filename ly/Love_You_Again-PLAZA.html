		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can feel it now
Feel 'em watchin' now
I'ma enter slow, with my eyes in hers
Just to make her, make her trust me, make her trust me
It's all lies
Baby, it's all lies
Girl, who else gon' fuck makin' you say please?
I'm gonna make 'em love me, make 'em love me
I don't give a damn what they sayin', baby
I've been making waves with these serenades
I been in these shadows singing, "Ooh, ah"
They been in these shadows getting me off
Every night I resurrect us, baby
Mix it with the absinthe, ooh she's ready
Yeah, I got everything I wanted then I think of you

Love, you know 
I wanna fuck you again, love you again, baby
Make you cum again
Make you cum again

Love, you know
I'm here to fuck you again, love you again, baby
Make you cum again
Make you cum again

Take whatever is round just to drown it out
All I feel is the praise, is the high
Yeah, there's a new king now
So every night they work it for me
Baby, put that skin all on me
Baby, taste yourself off for me, yeah

I don't chase it, never chase it
Ooh, I make her wait
Yeah, I make her wait
Oh, make her wait
You know I can resurrect you, baby
Mix it with the absinthe, ooh 
She's ready again, again, again

Love, you know 
I wanna fuck you again, love you again, baby
Make you cum again
Make you cum again

Love, you know 
I'm here to fuck you again, love you again, baby
Make you cum again
Make you cum again

Yeah, now you wanna, now you wanna, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah now you want me, now you want it
yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, hey, yeah

Love, you know 
I wanna fuck you again, love you again, baby
Make you cum again
Make you cum again

Love, you know 
I wanna fuck you again, love you again, baby
Make you cum again
Make you cum again

Love, you know 
I'm here to fuck you again, love you again, baby
Make you cum again
Make you cum again
