		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been the shit
Since like a jit
Always been the goat
Let my bitch
Count up my racks
While I roll up dro
And I got them
Talking shit behind
My back like I don't know
Man that shit be tough
When you had friends
That switched then
Turned to foes
But I ain't new to this
In fact I'm used to this
Gotta look back in 21
They was like
Who is this
Now it's 22
Came with bitches
And a new crib
Spend a bag on
Balenci and I bought
My bitch some new lips
I know I ain't living right
Fucking up my system
Sippin' on dirty sprite
Took a trip to Nam, aye
Hopped on a red eye
This that first class flight
She like it rough
Don't do polite, aye
Hit it once, then I'm gone
Just for the night, aye
Close your eyes
Cause my chain might
Make you blind, aye
Going up yeah
Feel like Jesus Christ, aye
Pocket watching boy
I keep my money tight
Said that I'm the worst
Baby girl I know
Talk to couple hoes
That I know I'll ghost
Lost a couple friends
But that's how it goes
Only live life once
And then you'll be gone
I been way too busy
I don't got time to relax
Couple hundred on my waist
B.B. Simon on the tag
And my wallet on obese, aye
Pockets fat, they like
Kishin he the goat
Man that's facts
Been the shit
Since like a jit
Always been the goat
Let my bitch
Count up my racks
While I roll up dro
And I got them
Talking shit behind
My back like I don't know
Man that shit be tough
When you had friends
That switched then
Turned to foes
But I ain't new to this
In fact I'm used to this
Gotta look back in 21
They was like
Who is this
Now it's 22
Came with bitches
And a new crib
Spend a bag on
Balenci and I bought
My bitch some new lips
