		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh
This might be too real, too real

Hold me closer in these
Trying times, supposed to be mine
Baby
I need some help just like anyone else
Hold me closer in these
Trying times, open your eyes
Baby
You said you felt something for me (talk to 'em)
I don't know when
Based on the signals you send
Based on the way you apologize
When you came to see me and then (then what?)
You had the nerve to defend (defend what?)
Mistakes that you made at the end
You said I was too invested
And that's what had forced you to go and pretend
I swear you're crazy
Someone that's close to you reached out to me just to see if we had made amends (oh)

Trust me, this ain't 'bout revenge
But now I get along better with your friend (woo)
And it's wrong, I know (know, know, know)
But again (ooh, yeah)
Trust me, this ain't 'bout revenge
I get along better with your friend (oh)
And it's wrong, I know, it's wrong, I know, oh

No
You said you felt, you said you felt
Something that's different from everyone else
You had the nerve to still ask for my help
Dug you out ditches, you buried yourself, ah-oh
You said you fell
And I took your word that night in our hotel
One thing about time, surely, time's gonna tell
Never had to work for much, so you said it yourself, ah-oh, oh
Can't let it go, can't get this out of me
This shit still bothers me
Don't you dare (don't you dare)
Don't say you're proud of me (don't you dare)
That shit's not real to me (don't you dare)
Now you wanna come crack to me (crack, crack)
Three whole years after me
Why did you wait 'til the end?

Trust me, this ain't 'bout revenge
But now I get along better with your friend, friend
And it don't feel wrong, but again
Trust me, this ain't 'bout revenge
I get along better with your friend
Oh, and it's wrong, I know, but again
Trust me, this ain't 'bout revenge
I get along better with your friend
