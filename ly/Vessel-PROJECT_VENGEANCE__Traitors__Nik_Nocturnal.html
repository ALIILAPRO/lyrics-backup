		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's just begun
As the battle moves forward
Buried underneath the scorn of the sun
Resisting memories
Conquering all, standing as one

I will take the pain
Intertwining between my delusional rage
Intercepting the message
That this intervention has become Divine
Enter boundless rage

With a blood soaked mandate
Discerning the bastard
What would you sell just to feel imperceivable?
Or the thought that you could escape
I've spent my days in hell
My skin has been torched by the lies that you sell
But years go by
And I'll protect this destiny 'til I die

In the wake of what we've created
Desperately finding fate through the madness
Time has stopped moving forward
And I'm the one who will show no remorse, vengeance

Kingdoms with crumble under the force of vengeance
Consumed by force
Crushed by the weight of the burden
Of spectacular visceral despair
A sick delusion of the animal I have let escape
It's clawing underneath my skin
This is worth your weight in bloodshed
There's no escape

In the wake of what we've created
Desperately finding fate through the madness
Time has stopped moving forward
And I'm the one who will show no remorse

Ever since I could remember, this world's wanted me dead
And if they want me as a martyr
Then they'll have to drag me from this grave

True vengeance
They, they want me dead
Suffocating me with constant pressure
There is no escape

They fall to me
We cant be contained
