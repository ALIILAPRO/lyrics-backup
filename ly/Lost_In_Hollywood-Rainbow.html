		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got to get a message through
'Cause I think I'm losing you
Am I too late?
Drinking habit's a loose sometime

I got to know if you're still mine
And I can't wait
Last time I saw your face
You tried to hide the tears

But I could see the trace
I'd be there if I could
But it's so far away from home
Lost in Hollywood

In the dark the vultures wait
I can hear them
Knocking at my gate
But I'm not here

The brew was cold
The meat is stale
In the L.A. night the sirens wail
The song you can feel

Pale stars that never shine
Scotch and the whiskey
And the Rainbow local wine
She's done more bad than good

I gotta get away somehow
Lost in Hollywood
On the streets the sun is fine
Don't you feel the advantage hit your mind

Feels all right, oh yeah
But I'm a lover
Like a loaded gun
Chasing shadows on the run

Out in the night
I'm gonna lose control
If I been losing you
To pay for rock'n'roll

Get back I know I should
Gotta get back home to you
You don't know what I been through
But there's nothing I can do, oh no

Lost in Hollywood
