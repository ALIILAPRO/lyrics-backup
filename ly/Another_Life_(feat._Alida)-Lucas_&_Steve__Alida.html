		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you walk away
The quiet is so loud
I'm counting the days
And hoping you'll come around

And I see your face
Wherever I go
Haunting me like a ghost
Oh, you never fade, and I cannot cut you out

I tell myself that this is not the end

Maybe in another life, we could be lovers
We'd have each other
We'll be one, just for tonight
Pretend it's forever, when we're together, baby

Feels like we're dreaming and everything's right
Wish you weren't gone by the end of the night
In another life, we will be lovers
We will be lovers, baby

Look up to the sky
And wait for a shooting star
I wish you were mine
And we never fell apart

And sometimes I wish
That we never met
It'd be easy out here without you
I tell myself that this is not the end

I tell myself that this is not the end

Maybe in another life, we could be lovers
We'd have each other
We'll be one, just for tonight
Pretend it's forever, when we're together, baby

Feels like we're dreaming and everything's right
Wish you weren't gone by the end of the night
In another life, we will be lovers
We will be lovers, baby

In another life, we will be lovers
We will be lovers, baby
