		  Hey
I'm kinda glad you didn't pick up
I kinda just called to hear your voice, so
Your voice recording was enough
I've been thinking about you and
I miss you

I hope and I wish that you're doing okay
I want us to go back to the old days
Because I miss you
And I just thought of you, so I thought I'd call you
To tell you that you crossed my mind and I took that as a sign that
I should call and say, "Hi"
So that's all
Hi

But the idea of you listening to this
The thought of you on the other side of the line
I can't hang up
I don't want this to end
