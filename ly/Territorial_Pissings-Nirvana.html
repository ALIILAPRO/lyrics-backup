		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another
Right now

When I was an alien
Cultures weren't opinions

Gotta find a way, to find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I had better wait

Never met a wise man
If so it's a woman

Gotta find a way, to find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I had better wait
Gotta find a way, to find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I had better wait

Just because you're paranoid
Don't mean they're not after you

Gotta find a way, to find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I had better wait
Gotta find a way, to find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I had better wait
Gotta find a way, to find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I had better wait
Gotta find a way, to find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I had better wait
