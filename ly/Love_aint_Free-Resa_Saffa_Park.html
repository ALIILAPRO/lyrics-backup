		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You said you'd never leave
Thought it was so hard to compete
And I loved so gallantly
Never did I think love was not for me

You're more than welcome
I am bottle breaking, body shaking on my own
But I keep dreaming of you
No matter how hard I try to forget you

Oh, oh
Love ain't free
No, Oh, oh
Love ain't free No
Oh, Oh
Love ain't free
No, mm

I get along without you very well
Well of course I do
But If I happen to cross your smell
I cripple apart, as well with my heart, it breaks in two

Oh, oh
Love ain't free
No, Oh, oh
Love ain't free No
Oh, Oh
Love ain't free
No, mm

You told me I felt too much
Well, of course, you've never ever felt a punch
A man will tie my body down
Squeeze my heart, rip it apart, throw it around

Oh, oh
Love ain't free
No, Oh, oh
Love ain't free 
No, Oh, Oh
Love ain't free
No, mm
Oh, oh
Love ain't free
No, Oh, oh
Love ain't free 
No, Oh, Oh
Love ain't free
You said you'd never leave
