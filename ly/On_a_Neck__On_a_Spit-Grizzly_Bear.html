		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My messenger in disguise 
Makes up for such short goodbyes. 
You can't come home again. 
Each time it's different. 
And the yards around your feet fall away while you're asleep. 
Each day, spend it with me now. 

All my time, spend it with me now. 
But each day spend it with you now. 
All my time, spend it with you now. 
But out here, no one can hear me, 
Out hear no one can hear me.
