		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pick me up and put me down away
I was up last week, can't explain

Oh I see you rowing on a road
No place to go
No longer want anything
That you used to want

Pick me up and put me down away
I was up last week, can't explain
I could clean it up but its still stained
I was up from your shriek, can't explain

I can't out run all of these problems
I can't out run all of the problems
And I can't speak where I'm going
And I can't speak where I'm going

Pick me up and put me down away
I was up last week, can't explain
I could clean it up but its still stained
I was up from your shriek, can't explain
