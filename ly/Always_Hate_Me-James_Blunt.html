		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh God it hurt
The moment that I saw you
With someone else
The one that you belong to

I never thought
I'd drown in my shallow heart

I'd like to say
The things I never used to
But come today they wont ever be useful
I never learn t to use my shallow heart

I, I, I
I never meant to hurt you
It's just something I do
I guess it's not a good excuse

And she will always hate me
No matter what I say
And there is no mistaking
The love is gone

She will always hate me
She said, you lost me baby
No matter what I say
The love is gone

Looking back I guess I'm holding onto
The good we had
But I know it's wrong to
Because in the end
She's never gonna hold my heart

And now she knows
She doesn't want to know me
I'm not suppose to be the one that's lonely
I never thought that she could have a cold, cold heart

I, I, I
I never meant to hurt you
It's just something I do
I guess it's not a good excuse

And she will always hate me
No matter what I say
And there is no mistaking
The love is gone

She will always hate me
She said, you lost me baby
No matter what I say
The love is gone

I, I, I
I never meant to hurt you
It's just something I do
I guess it's not a good excuse

And she will always hate me
No matter what I say
And there is no mistaking
The love is gone

She will always hate me
She said, you lost me baby
No matter what I say
The love is gone
