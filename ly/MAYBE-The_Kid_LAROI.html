		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drown my sorrows in this bottle
Won't like waking up tomorrow
I'm the only one that cares about myself
And you don't need me like I need you
So if you go maybe I'll free you
But I'll be lost, to tell the truth, I need your help
And even you can't fix my problems
Like you once did, I'm too hollow
I can't talk to you no more and I can't tell
If it's me or if it's you 'cause you don't even pick up my calls no more
I'm drunk and left alone with all my thoughts

So maybe, maybe I'm driving me crazy
Maybe it's me and it's not you
I'm not too good at admitting when I fuck up
But maybe, maybe it's you who can save me
I got love for you, but I hate me
Maybe, there's no way to change me
So maybe, maybe I'm driving me crazy
Maybe it's me and it's not you
I'm not too good at admitting when I fuck up 
But maybe, maybe it's you who can save me
I got love for you, but I hate me
Maybe, there's no way to change me, yeah-yeah

No way that I'll ever change
So I'm down to lay down next to my brain
Said I'm okay, but no way
More than I can take
And there's no one to blame but me
No need to wait for me
"Why do you pick me up just to break me?"
That's what you say to me, why do you play with me?
You won't ever understand

So maybe, maybe I'm driving me crazy
Maybe it's me and it's not you
I'm not too good at admitting when I fuck up 
But maybe, maybe it's you who can save me
I got love for you, but I hate me
Maybe, there's no way to change me
So maybe, maybe I'm driving me crazy
Maybe it's me and it's not you
I'm not too good at admitting when I fuck up 
But maybe, maybe it's you who can save me
I got love for you, but I hate me
Maybe there's no way to change me
