		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're so impossible
Scream and moan, it chills my soul
Don't want to hear you got left behind
All those times you stayed up and cried
It's no lie, you did it to yourself
Like chewed up gum under my shoe
Don't look surprised, you must've known all along

It's just another love song
Another love song

It's never easy, it's not hard
When you've lost your mind
With you it's sleazy
Don't tell me your worries
I'm sick, I'll leave you blind
Now the time has come
To leave this love that's left you dry
No need to work this out now
'Cause you know there's no reason why

It's just another love song
Another love song
Another love song
It's just another love song

I never told you it would last forever
You can't hold this boy for long, dig it
By the time you read my letter
Baby, I'll be gone

You're just another love song
Another love song
Another love song
You're just another love song
You're just another love song
Another love song
Another love song
You're just another love song

"This is W.O.m.b, the Womb
And if you, my pets, learn to listen
I'll let you crawl back in
Here is something you should drop to your knees for, and worship
But you are too stupid to realize yourselves"
