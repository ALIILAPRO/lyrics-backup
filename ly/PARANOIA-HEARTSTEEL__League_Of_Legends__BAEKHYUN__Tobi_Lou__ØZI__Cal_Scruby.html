		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Two sides to a story but they never tell my side
Never been the kinda guy to stay inside the guidelines
I know I'm the bad guy, I don't gotta ask why
If you try step to me, it'll be the last time
I got dirt on my name, six feet in the ground
I got people in my past try bringin' me down
Say I'm losin' my mind, I don't wanna be found
Grew up in the shadow but I know they watchin' me now

Paranoia, on the go, I'm moving silent (let's go)
Pull up on ya, I got trouble right behind me (let's go)
Bite the bullet, suit and tie, the silver linin'
I'm-i'm-i'm-i'm gonna show you how to crash a party

Every time you pop off, they hopin' that you fall hard
They prayin' for the death of a rockstar
Everybody hatin' ever since you got more
They prayin' for the death of a rockstar
Ooh, they love it when you lost, boy
Now the low life at the top floor
Everybody hatin' ever since you got more
They prayin' for the death of a rockstar

They talk about me, I forget to listen
At least I get the recognition
Heavyweight, I pull up on you with the repetition
You in the pit, it's not no exhibition
Oh, they big mad, I'm the big boss
Talk a big game, take a big loss
Growin' up, I was the problem that they didn't solve
I'm the piece that wouldn't fit inside the jigsaw
I got a lotta punch lines and a quick jab
I'm runnin' straight through, I don't gotta zig-zag
I got a heavy heart, it's hard to lift that
From the cradle to the grave, never changed, make 'em dig that

Paranoia, on the go, I'm moving silent (let's go)
Pull up on ya, I got trouble right behind me (let's go)
Bite the bullet, suit and tie, the silver linin'
I'm-i'm-i'm-i'm gonna show you how to crash a party

Every time you pop off, they hopin' that you fall hard
They prayin' for the death of a rockstar
Everybody hatin' ever since you got more
They prayin' for the death of a rockstar
Ooh, they love it when you lost, boy
Now the low life at the top floor
Everybody hatin' ever since you got more
They prayin' for the death of a rockstar

They wanna kiss me long good night with a rose
Hoping that the Eiffel falls, of course
You don't understand the life we chose
(On life support, life goes)
I need my silence, my privacy so I can heal
And even rockstars got feelings that they feel
In reality, this just repeats like a drill
Always, oh-oh, oh-oh

Every time you pop off, they hopin' that you fall hard
They prayin' for the death of a rockstar (yeah, yeah)
Everybody hatin' ever since you got more
They prayin' for the death of a rockstar
Ooh, they love it when you lost, boy (when you lost)
Now the low life at the top floor (top floor)
Everybody hatin' ever since you got more (ever since you got more)
They prayin' for the death of a rockstar
Pop off, they hopin' that you fall hard
They prayin' for the death of a rockstar
Everybody hatin' ever since you got more (ever since you got more)
They prayin' for the death of a rockstar
