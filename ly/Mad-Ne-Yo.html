		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's starin' at me
I'm sittin', wonderin' what she's thinkin'
Nobody's talkin'
'Cause talkin' just turned into screamin'
And now is I'm yellin' over her
She's yellin' over me
All that that means
Is neither of us is listening
(And what's even worse)
That we don't even remember why were fighting

So both of us are mad for

Nothin'
(Fighting for)
Nothin'
(Crying for)
Nothin'
(Whoa)
But we won't let it go for
Nothin'
(No not for)
Nothin'
This should be nothin' to a love like what we got
Oh, baby
I know sometimes
It's gonna rain
But baby, can we make up now
'Cause I can't sleep through the pain
(Can't sleep through the pain)

Girl, I don't wanna go to bed
(Mad at you)
And I don't want you to go to bed
(Mad at me)
No, I don't wanna go to bed
(Mad at you)
And I don't want you to go to bed
(Mad at me)
Oh, no, no, no

And it gets me upset, girl
When you're constantly accusing
(Askin' questions like you've already known)
We're fighting this war, baby
When both of us are losing
(This ain't the way that love is supposed to go)
Whoa
(What happened to workin' it out)
We've falled into this place
Where you ain't backin' down
And I ain't backin' down

So what the hell do we do now
It's all for

Nothin'
(Fighting for)
Nothin'
(Crying for)
Nothin'
(Whoa)
But we won't let it go for
Nothin'
(No not for)
Nothin'
This should be nothin' to a love like what we got
Oh, baby
I know sometimes
It's gonna rain
But baby, can we make up now
'Cause I can't sleep through the pain
(Can't sleep through the pain)

Girl, I don't wanna go to bed
(Mad at you)
And I don't want you to go to bed
(Mad at me)
No, I don't wanna go to bed
(Mad at you)
And I don't want you to go to bed
(Mad at me)
Oh, no, no, no

Oh baby this love ain't gonna be perfect
(Perfect, perfect, oh oh)
And just how good it's gonna be
We can fuss and we can fight
Long as everything alright between us
Before we go to sleep

Baby, we're gonna be happy

I know sometimes
It's gonna rain
But baby, can we make up now
'Cause I can't sleep through the pain
(Can't sleep through the pain)

Girl, I don't wanna go to bed
(Mad at you)
And I don't want you to go to bed
(Mad at me)
No, I don't wanna go to bed
(Mad at you)
And I don't want you to go to bed
(Mad at me)
Oh, no, no, no
