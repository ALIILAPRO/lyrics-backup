		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  David Yurman, Erick Sermon, Pee-wee Herman
Tina Turner, buy it furnished, eat Italian
Shop in Paris, drive a German
David Yurman, Erick Sermon, Pee-wee Herman
Tina Turner, buy it furnished, eat Italian
Shop in Paris, drive a German
David Yurman, Erick Sermon, Pee-wee Herman
Tina Turner, buy it furnished, eat Italian
Shop in Paris, drive a German

Taught my bitches how to whip it
Now they whippin', fast learners
Chicken heads, whippin' chickens
I felt like a black colonel
Louis Vuitton, ballin' like Mr. Kareem Abdul-Jabaar
St. Laurent, I even had the green light
I blew the horn, c'mon c'mon
Fuck we waitin' on my nigga, move along
Grass is greener on the other side, I never do the lawn
Deepest water, see, The Carter made me feel like Peter Parker
Be a Dora, Double R her, treat her like Ford Explorer
See no evil, neither horror
My bitch eyes chinky Kamora
Run a mile like Jackie Joyner
Bitch should go read a thesaurus
Pretty Tony, Pretty Ricky, Ricky Martin, Martin Lawrence
Lawrence Taylor, Taylor Swift, Tailor Made, Made in China
Blac Chyna, Black Mamba, baby mama, Lady Gaga
Wait, Rihanna she ball hard Sinaed O'Connor, hmm

David Yurman, Erick Sermon, Pee-wee Herman
Tina Turner, buy it furnished, eat Italian
Shop in Paris, drive a German
Blac Chyna, Black Mamba
Baby mama, Lady Gaga, wait, Rihanna
Ball hard, Sinead O'Connor, hmm
Ball, ball, ball, ball, ball, Sinead O'Connor, yeah
Ball, ball, ball, ball, ball
David Yurman, Erick Sermon, Pee-wee Herman
Tina Turner, buy it furnished, eat Italian
Shop in Paris, drive a German

It's MULA baby, know you heard me
Got the game, I'm talkin' early
Twizzy baby, got these bitches swallowin' babies talkin' nurseries
Pocket pull up, Black Eyes Peas
The P for Perky's, got me flirty
Model bitches tryna hurt me
Broken mirrors, pull a Fergie
Oh my God it's cocaina
Kim and Gina had to team up
Tried to run away from this dick
And got subpoenaed, had to clean up
Got two strikes out in L.A
I get one more, then new Adidas
Niggas call me hustle Westbrook
Sellin' dope off in the bleachers
Niggas call me hustle Westbrook
Sellin' dope off in the bleachers
Trappin' off a walkie-talkie
Tempo, over, yeah I read you
That my woadie, that my 'migo
Gettin' loaded off sativa
Move the rock like Russell Westbrook
Triple-double the whole season, whoa

David Yurman, Erick Sermon, Pee-wee Herman
Tina Turner, buy it furnished, eat Italian
Shop in Paris, drive a German

Baby mama, Lady Gaga, wait, Rihanna
Ball hard, Sinead O'Connor, hmm

Ball, ball, ball, ball, ball, Sinead O'Connor, yeah
Ball, ball, ball, ball, ball

Shop in Paris, drive a German

Baby mama, Lady Gaga, wait Rihanna
Ball hard, Sinead O'Connor, hmm
