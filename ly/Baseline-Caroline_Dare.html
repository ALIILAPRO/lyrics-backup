		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm starting to feel it
The cycle's repeating
But both of my feet
Are glued to the floor
When I think about leaving
Should have a right reason
But what would that be
You've given me more
Than I can count
What's the matter with me
Ooo don't wanna go
Don't wanna have to go through with it
Ooo I gotta go
Before I give you my will to live
If I got myself in
I can get myself out
Digging in the deep end's
Holding me down
Don't wanna lean in
I just wanna skip around
Cutting my own corners
Looking for a
Steady state of mind
Tryna get back to baseline
(Back, back, back)
It's the simple decisions
That are breaking my back
Seeing some growth
Where I tore apart
Like I'm muscling back
It's so hard cause sometimes...
Ooo don't wanna go
Don't wanna have to go through with it
Ooo I gotta go
Cause I don't wanna lose my will to live
If I got myself in
I can get myself out
Digging in the deep end's
Holding me down
Don't wanna lean in
I just wanna skip around
Cutting my own corners
Looking for a
Steady state of mind
Tryna get back to baseline
(Back, back, back to baseline)
Tryna get back to baseline
(Back, back, back to baseline)
Back to, back to, back, back to baseline
Gave you all I had now it's all mine
Soon I'll be back
To better than before
If I got myself in
I can get myself out
Digging in the deep end's
Holding me down
Don't wanna lean in
I just wanna skip around
Cutting my own corners
Looking for a
Steady state of mind
Tryna get back to baseline
(Back, back, back to baseline)
Tryna get back to baseline
(Back, back, back to baseline)
