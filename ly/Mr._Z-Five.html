		  Excuse me can you help me straighten up my head? 
I got a new friend by the name of Mr Z. 
Well what's wrong with that, don't ya like what you see? 
Hmm... If I had a choice yo I'd rather be me 
You see he's kinda not like kinda average kinda guy 
Kinda say what make you kinda say why 
Did you see that what he did to his cat 
It's all big and fat and now it wears caps. 

Here we go agian. 
Mr Zuvaloppa got a crazy life 
With a house on the corner for his kids and whife. 
Works all day tryin' to make ends meet 
Just the same as everybody does down his street. 
Mr Zuvaloppa got a brand new car 
But he likes a little drink so he can't drive far. 
He used to have a mini but he's six foot four. 
Mr Zuvaloppa don't want it anymore. 

Yo you gotta sit back relax while 
I hit you with a tale of a guy 
Who would try but he's always gonna fail 
M I S T E are Z he doesn't realise 
That it wasn't really meant to be 
Him up at the top he never want to stop 

The fool up in the pool doin' a big 
Belly flop 
Now even sunbathing he could never get 
It right 
Cause he even tried to do it in the middle 
Of the night. 

Here we go again. 
Mr Zuvaloppa got a crazy life 
With a house on the corner for his kids and wife. 
Works all day tryin' to make ends meet 
Just the same as everybody does down his street. 
Mr Zuvaloppa got a brand new car 
But he likes a little drink so he can't drive far. 
He used to have a mini but he's six foot four. 
Mr Zuvaloppa don't want it anymore. (repeat until end)
