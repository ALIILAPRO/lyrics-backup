		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sister Rust
Where are you now?
I met you over Rocky Mountains
Feeling blue
Waiting for a last frame to walk through
All together

But when you closed your eyes
It was then I realized
You were so far away

There was nothing I could do
To stop you feeling blue
Anyway

Sister Rust
I need you now
Cause I've got a feeling
It's you and me again
Waiting for the credits to end
Now and forever

With something in our hearts
That if we were to stop
Would pull us away

There's nothing we can do
To stop feeling this blue
Anyway
