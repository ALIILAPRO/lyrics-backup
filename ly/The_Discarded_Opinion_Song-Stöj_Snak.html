		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Seatbelts are for the weak
The chemtrails will kill us
Climate change won't affect me
I can still drive it's only my 5th beer

Crystals will heal my leg
Vaccines cause autism
Those new fax machines are great
A silent fart is a wasted opportunity

Nobody knows all the trouble we see
But we're all firm beliefs
And someday we will be set free

Pineapple pizzas rock
Real men should not cry
You can always trust the cops
The toilet paper should roll towards the wall

Kids should be seen, not heard
I'll look good with a mustache
Reptilians rule the world
I don't need to go to the doctor with this growing mole

Nobody knows all the trouble we see
But we're all firm beliefs
And someday we will be set free

Tigers make the greatest pets
Video games can't be musicals
Problems should be repressed
Getting another child will save this relationship

Elvis is still alive
I can so do a backflip
I'm young and I'm never gonna die
And I am significant in the greater scheme of things

Nobody knows all the trouble we see
But we're all firm beliefs
And someday we will be set free
