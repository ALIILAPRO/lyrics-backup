		  Whatever! 
I went down to the beach and saw Kiki 
She was all like "Eeeeh" and I was like "Whatever" 
This chick comes up to me she's all like 

Like "Hey aren't you that dude" I'm like "Whatever" 
So later I'm at the pool hall this girl comes up 
She's like "Awww" and I'm like "Whatever" 
'Cause this is my United States of Whatever 

And this is my United States of Whatever 
And this is my United States of Whatever 
It's three a.m. I'm round the corner wearing my leather 
This dude comes up like "Hey punk" I'm like "Whatever" 

Then I'm throwing dice in the alley Officer Leeroy comes up 
Like "Hey I thought I told you not to..." "Yeah whatever!" 
Then up comes Zafron I'm like "Hey Zafron" 
He's like "What's up" I'm like "That's cool" 

Cause this is my United States of Whatever 
And this is my United States of Whatever
