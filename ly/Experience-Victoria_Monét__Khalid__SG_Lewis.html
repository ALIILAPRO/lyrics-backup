		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me what you came for
Here, 'cause I'm breaking down
Try not to make this obvious
Tell me what you came for, oh
Need to forget it now
Lost in the middle of it all
That's what I came for

Love always feels better when it's true
Love tastes way too bitter when it's you

I'm all out of love
You gave it away
I'm hoping that experience could get you to change
I'm hoping that experience could get you to change
I'm hoping that (ooh-oh)
I'm all out of love
You gave it away
I'm hoping that experience could get you to change
I'm hoping that experience could get you to change
I'm hoping that

Love's no pressure
When it's with someone who tends to
All of your emotions 
Don't you want someone who's there for you
For someone who's there for you

Love always feels better, when it's true
Love tastes way too bitter, when it's you

I'm all out of love
You gave it away
I'm hoping that experience could get you to change
I'm hoping that experience could get you to change
I'm hoping that (ooh-oh)
I'm all out of love
You gave it away
I'm hoping that experience could get you to change
I'm hoping that experience could get you to change
I'm hoping that

Tell me what you came for (I'm all out of love)
(You gave it away, I'm hoping that)
Tell me what you came for
Tell me what you came for
