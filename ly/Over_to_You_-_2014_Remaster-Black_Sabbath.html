		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Born in the window
Cold blooded spoof
Raised in the prison
You called the school
Taught young in legends
Told what to do
I handed my childhood
Over to you

Travelling endlessly, I'm searching for mind
I'm almost afraid of what I will find
Wandering aimlessly, oh what can I do?
I handed my future over to you, to you

Over to you
Future looks blue
What can I do?

Watching for freedom
Fighting our wars
Feeding our children
Keeping your laws
Someday you'll suffer
And what I'll do
I'll hand all your promises
Over to you

Standing inside myself, I'm losing control
You made me believe in the stories you told
Waiting impatiently, what else can I do?
I handed my future over to you, to you

Over to you
Future looks blue
What can I do?

Tears filled of sadness
Stealing myself
Which burning secrets?
What to they tell?
Mad politicians
Can tell it true
I handed my children
Over to you

All over, over to you
All over, over to you
All over, over to you
