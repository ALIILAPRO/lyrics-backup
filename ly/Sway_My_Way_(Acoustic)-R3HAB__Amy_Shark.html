		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So bored, a little insecure
So tired of fakin' every laugh and havin' conversations that
Were empty when unexpectedly
I met your eyes across the room, they pulled me into somewhere new

And I never knew
A pull so infinitely strong (infinitely strong), yeah

Say you'll stay
Don't come and go
Like you do (like you do)
Sway my way
Yeah, I need to know
All about you

Ooh, sway my way
Ooh, sway my way
Ooh, sway my way
Ooh

And it felt right, talkin' the whole night
And dancin' until the sun came up, I've never been so open but
I can't lie, no matter how I try
You're something that I can't contain, like capturing a flame

And I know you love to move
Like catching fire in my hands (fire in my hands)

Say you'll stay
Don't come and go
Like you do (like you do)
Sway my way
Yeah, I need to know
All about you (all about you)

Ooh, sway my way
Ooh, sway my way
Ooh, sway my way
Ooh

Sway my way
Yeah, I need to know
All about you
