		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If we left this town, we could walk the earth together
If you let me down, I will live in you forever
I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you
I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you

If we could find a home, we could go through time together
If we could hold our own, devastate the night forever
There's no place where we can't go
There's no place where I have been
There's no limit I can show
There's no level in between
Jolene, I could have seen you there,
Jolene, I need you everywhere
I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you
I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you
Jolene, I could have seen you there
When I looked into your lifeless eyes, I saw you everywhere
There's no place where you can hide
There's no place that I can't find
There's no end to leave me clean
There's no reason I have seen

If you find me on my own, you could live your life forever
Shall we leave our world alone, maybe we'll go back or never
Jolene, I could've seen you there
When I looked into your lifeless eyes, I saw you everywhere
I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you
I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you

I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you
I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you
