		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hijacked when you weren't looking
Behind your back people are talking
Using words that cut your down to size
You want to fight back
It's building inside you
Holding you up
Taking you hostage
Yeah, it's worth fight for

They'll try to take your pride
Try to take your soul
They'll try to take all the control
They'll look you in the eyes
Fill you full of lies
Believe me they're gonna try
So when you're feeling crazy
And things fall apart
Listen to your head
Remember who you are

You're the one
You're the unbreakable heart
You're the one
You're the unbreakable heart
You're the one
You're the one

Hijacked when you weren't looking
Behind your back people are talking
Using words that cut your down to size
You want to fight back
You're out in the open
You're under attack
But your spirit's now broken
You know it's worth fighting for

They'll try to take your pride
Try to take your soul
They'll try to take all the control
They'll look you in the eyes
Fill you full of lies
Believe me they're gonna try
So when you're feeling crazy
And things fall apart
Listen to your head
Remember who you are

You're the one
You're the unbreakable heart
You're the one
You're the unbreakable heart
You're the one
You're the one

Don't look them in the eyes
Believe me they're gonna try
To fill you up with lies

They'll try to take your pride
Try to take your soul
(You're the one, you're the one)
They'll look you in the eyes
Fill you full of lies

You're the one
You're the unbreakable heart
You're the one
You're the unbreakable heart
You're the one
You're the one
