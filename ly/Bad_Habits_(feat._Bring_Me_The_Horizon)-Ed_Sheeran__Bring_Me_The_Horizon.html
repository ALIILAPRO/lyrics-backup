		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Whoa
Whoa

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
Started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
I was looking for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothing happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Whoa
My bad habits lead to you
Whoa
Whoa
My bad habits lead to you
Whoa

We took the long way 'round
And burned 'til the fun ran out
And we took the long way 'round
And burned 'til the fun ran out, now

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to you

Whoa
My bad habits lead to you
Whoa
My bad habits lead to you
You
Bad habits lead to you
No, it's true
My bad habits lead to you
