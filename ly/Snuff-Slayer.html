		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Start with vanity
Arrogance and greed
Panic is my obsession
No one can escape

The thrill is much too great
Despair is my creation
Everything obscene
Emanates from me

Homicide is on the rise
It all begins now
Take your final bow
The camera never lies

Action, torture, misery
Endless suffering
Torment, agony

Captured for eternity
Action
You're the main attraction

Torture, misery
Endless suffering
Pleasing to the eye
To this you can't deny

No one else around
Razor wire bound
Insanity is so near
Heart begins to seize

Watch you atrophy
Reality is now clear
Take a look inside
Many more have died

The internet's an open door
Everyone can see
Dying brutally
The audience begs for more

Action, torture, misery
Endless suffering
Torment, agony

Captured for eternity
Action
You're the main attraction

Torture, misery
Endless suffering
Pleasing to the eye
To this you can't deny

Murder is my future
Killing is my future
Murder is my future
Killing is my future

Torture, misery
Endless suffering
Pleasing to the eye
To this you can't deny

Murder is my future
Killing is my future
Murder is my future
Killing is my future

Murder is my future
Killing is my future
Murder is my future
Killing is my future

Murder is my future
