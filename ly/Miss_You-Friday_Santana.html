		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tears in the club
I'm so fucked up
So in love
Girl it's been too long
And i miss ya
Can't lie i miss ya
That's why i'm fucking with these bitches to forget ya
Can't lie i miss ya
You know i miss ya
And i can't even help it cause you switched up
But baby,
Where is my mind?
Where am i going?
I'm losing the time
That i need to convince you
How much i care for you
I can pay for lines if your nose dry
You can ride my face till you cum twice
I just wanna feel you girl i won't lie
Cause i'm so used to fuckin' on the first night,
Nose bleeds keep all of these bitches off me
So free i'm steady smoking that OG
And she preach, keep touching that pussy for me
We too deep, girl we too deep
Tears in the club
I'm so fucked up
I miss the love
Cause girl it's been too long
And i miss ya
Can't lie i miss ya
That's why i'm fucking with these bitches to forget ya
Can't lie i miss ya
You know i miss ya
And i can't even help it cause you switched up
But baby,
Where is my mind?
Where am i going?
I'm losing the time
That i need to convince you
How much i care for you
