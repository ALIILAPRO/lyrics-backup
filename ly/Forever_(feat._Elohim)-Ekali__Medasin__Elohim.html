		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is war that I'm living in
Stranger than the one before
I don't wanna fight it anymore
There's a meaning I've been looking for
I never had to go too far
Found you in my heart down on the floor

Take me back to the start
Before all the scars affected me
Take me back to the start
Before I was worried about everything

Take me, take me
I just wanna live in your arms
Where I'm safe forever
Keep me safe forever
Keep me safe forever

What's this feeling that I'm feeling?
All different than the times before
I can't even fake it anymore
I was shielded by my own mistakes
So scared to give my God a break
Ready to let you love me now

Take me back to the start
Before all the scars affected me
Take me back to the start
Before I was worried about everything

Take me, take me
I just wanna live in your arms
Where I'm safe forever
Keep me safe forever
Keep me safe forever

Keep me safe forever
Keep me safe forever
