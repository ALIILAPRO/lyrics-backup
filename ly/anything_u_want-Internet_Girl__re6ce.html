		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Verse 1 (ntsika)
There's a new sensation 
Going around 
I been at it 16 years 
Tryna get my sound 
Im vexed 

Chorus 1 (ntsika)
You could do anything you want 
All you gotta do is take it 
Oh you feel like you're a fraud 
so what just fake it 

Verse 2 (ntsika)
Told me I should leave right now 
I just got kicked out Internet girl
Cause I write like shit
oh  
And right now
There's no place for me
They released a brand new sound 
Far from what the eye can see
Don't you know 

Chorus 2 (ntsika)
You could do anything you want 
I can see you overthinking 
Oh you feel like you're a fraud 
So what 
Just fake it 

Verse 3 (re6ce) 
tell me that u want it
tell me that u want it
tell me that im better than anybodys fucking done it
u saw me before the show
i said that i had to go
you get that im on the road
but fuck im missing home

travelling going round and round
it took a toll on my mental health
im feeling washed up never felt so down

never get it
never get it 
never get it
i know i said it
never meant it
when i said it
never get it
never get it 
never get it
studious
you're such a fucking copacetic


Chorus 3(ntsika & re6ce)
You could do anything you want 
All you gotta do is take it 
Oh you feel like you're a fraud 
so what just fake it
