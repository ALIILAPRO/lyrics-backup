		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Came in the game with a three piece
I got the blood, yeah, I got the stripes, woah
Laced up down to the feet, I can't take defeat
That's checks over stripes, woah
Got no time to be a dope fiend (No time)
I'm just tryin' to keep this all clean (Oh yeah)
I follow all of the hype b
Like I'm tryin' to keep all the souls clean like woah, yeah
Don't be concerned with the motor, I swear that the drive is unheard of (Woo!)
Yeah, I ain't concerned with the modem, I stay connected with the server (Okay)
You look a little upset (Huh)
Must have been somethin' I said (Huh)
Why you hatin' on the Bible (Why)
Must have been somethin' it said, yeah
Father, Son, Holy Spirit
Saved by the bread and the blood
Used to get kicked out of church 'cause
I dipped the bread in the blood
Quien ta encima es la misma quien yo hablar con en la tarde
Que ta arrento de mi cuerpo esta limpio, ya tu sabe
Yeah, you can tell the people who ridin', I'ma tell the people who drivin' (Yeah)
Raced in the hood, diamond buried in the dirt, wasn't really worth finding (Yeah)
Tellin' all the people no cryin', I found the one to abide in (Yeah)
Young Boop, black sheep, I was in too deep, but He went sea-diving (Ayy, ayy, ayy ayy!)
Thief in the night, here He come in the sky
When you put up a fight, then you dead or alive
What impresses the people, I cripple the people that cripple the people that's crippled I mean it
When I say I don't want the glory, I mean it
When I say I'm not the same Torey, I mean it
Ayy man, hallelujah, KB undefeated
Evil gotta eat it, God can be seated
Seein' all the pain, seein' all the change
Changin' my perspective, what was my objective?
Object of my faith, always been rejected
President elected, it don't really matter
'Cause I always had a king
They made they bed, now they gotta lay in it
Coffin mistook for California king (Yeah, let me talk)
Had to go back to back like 2-4 did, an 0-9 and 1-0 (Kobe)
I go behind the back like no look pass from that boy Rondo, yeah (Woo!)
Hold on tight to that gold soul
Know that's my type of bankroll
High price so no easy money (No!)
Eternal on the payroll (You know!)
I had to smash like one time
G.O.D. army and I'm on the frontline (Ayy)
Everyone look a little shaky like reverb added to the baseline (Woo!)
Side chain, side chain, side chain
Check out the piece on my neckline (Peace!)
I ain't got time to be stressin', yeah
Check out the peace on my head like (Woo)
We not for sale, you can't hear that? (I'll just say it in braille)
All of this way, hope that Lucy (She don't tip the scale)
Charged up like the energizer
These days off, I don't take none
Fed up with these handouts, like burnt toast swear I've been done
Had to go back to back like Philly and Toronto
Back to back like Celtics, Rondo
Back to back like Lavar and Lonzo
Hangin' off the top hole, screamin' like a wino
Yellin' dark to light, light
View the light, go, hope it ain't a crime, no
Killin' everything I step on
Bug life, turns to ripped bones
Shrug like, pray you don't get caught in a trap
Like a bug, white got loose out of the trap
I'm makin' sumn tight, ah!
Pray I don't let them kill my vibe
My sin got nowhere to hide
Runnin' my race, I'ma take it in stride
Tryin' to be the best Torey alive (Alive)
It's Boopie, period
