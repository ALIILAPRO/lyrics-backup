		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I dreamed of you last week
Remembered old memories
Cryin' in my sleep
But I'd rather dream of nothing at all
The more I think I grow
The less I seem to know, oh
You saw me sing last week
I was hopin' you might ask
"Is this one about me?"
But how could you just say nothin' at all?
The more I think I grow
The less I seem to know, oh, oh

Julia, I'm through with ya
Julia, I'm through with ya

Thought we'd never see the sun fade (sun fade)
Now we'll never see that shit shining (shining)
Did we use to fear the dark days? (Dark days)
'Cause now I'm dancin' in the moonlight
Above the city lights, yeah
Where all the shooting stars eventually die (yeah)
We're burned into the sky a million times
Oh, mmm, mmm

(We're up)

Movin' at light speed
And I don't need gravity
Runnin' on empty
Isn't it nice to just feel nothing at all?
I think I finally know
The reason I let go

Julia, I'm through with ya
Julia, I'm through with ya

Thought we'd never see the sun fade (sun fade)
Now we'll never see that shit shining (shining)
Did we use to fear the dark days? (Dark days)
'Cause now I'm dancing in the moonlight
Above the city lights, yeah
Where all the shooting stars eventually die (Julia, die)
We're burned into the sky a million times
Oh, mmm, mmm

(Wow, just ignore this one)

Julia, I'm through with ya
Julia, I'm through with ya
