		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Overtime you lost the line
The growing box of self decline
There's silent anger so loud
Behind the keys to it all on my inside

Say what you will, what you will
Anything for a kill, for a kill
Run 'em down til you wear the crown
Say what you will, what you will
Anything for the thrill of a kill
Beat them down til' they're underground

You bring the gun
Bleed with a knife
The darkest sky is your paradise
Faceless fame on a heap you reign
You leave the hate but you still play the saint, saint

Righteous soul how you cleave
Quick, press your poison to the fiend
Just a fake peace, ready, set for the siege
Burn with the blue, die if I scream

Say what you will, what you will
Anything for a kill, for a kill
Run 'em down 'til you wear the crown
Say what you will, what you will
Anything for the thrill of a kill

You bring the gun
And bleed with a knife
The darkest sky is your paradise
Faceless fame on a heap you reign
You leave the hate but you still play the saint

No human alliance, violence never silence
No human alliance, violence never silence
No human alliance, violence never silence
No human alliance, violence never silence
Cross my heart and hope I die
Stabbed a needle in my eye
Cross my heart and hope I die
Stabbed a needle in my eye

Say what you will, what you will
Anything for a kill, for a kill
Run 'em down 'til you wear the crown
Say what you will, what you will
Anything for the thrill of a kill

You bring the gun
And bleed with a knife
The darkest sky is your paradise
Faceless fame on a heap you reign
You leave the hate but you still play the saint, saint
