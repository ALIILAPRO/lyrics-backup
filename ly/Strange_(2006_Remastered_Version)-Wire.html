		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's something strange going on tonight
There's something going on that's not quite right
Joey's nervous and the lights are bright
There's something going on that's not quite right

There's something going down that wasn't here before
Keep your eyes so screwed to the floor
No one's gonna save your life
There's something going on that's not quite right, uh-huh

Beeping, creeping, there's something going on that wasn't here before
Keep your eyes so glued to the floor
No one's gonna save your life
There's something going on that's not quite right, uh-huh

There's something strange going on tonight
There's something going on that's not quite right
Joey's nervous and the lights are bright
There's something going on that's not quite right
There's something
There's something, there's something
There's something, there's something
There's something, there's something
There's something, there's something
There's something
