		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cold dark night, nerves are tense
Strange sounds out of nowhere the fog is dense
You lay in your bed quaking with fright
Shadows in the hallway, something's not right
Sounds in the kitchen, your nerves swell
There's a creature in the basement, a monster from hell
It slimes up the steps, unholy rasping hiss
Who knows what is wants? Who knows what it is?
Horrified, your sanity ebbs
Tou struggle to survive
Mortified, you know you'll never
Leave this house alive.
Foul smelling breath, it draws you near
You scream for mercy, no oen can hear
Your terror is relished, its claws ooze with gore
Sustained by your fear, it feeds on your horror!!!!
It's teeth retract from your skull
Feasting on your brains
Mortified, you know you'll never
Leave this house again.
