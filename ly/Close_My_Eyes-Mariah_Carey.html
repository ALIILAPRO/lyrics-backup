		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was wayward child 
With the weight of the world 
That I held deep inside 
Life was a winding road 
And I learned many things 
Little ones shouldn't know 

But I closed my eyes 
Steadied my feet on the ground 
Raised my head to the sky 
And though time's rolled by 
Still feel like that child 
As I look at the moon 
Maybe I grew up 
A little too soon 

Funny how one can learn 
To grow numb to the madness 
And block it away 
I left the worst unsaid 
Let it all dissipate 
And I try to forget 

But I closed my eyes 
Steadied my feet on the ground 
Raised my head to the sky 
And though time's rolled by 
Still feel like that child 
As I look at the moon 
Maybe I grew up 
A little too soon 

Nearing the edge 
Oblivious I almost 
Fell right over 
A part of me 
Will never be quite able 
To feel stable 
That woman-child falling inside 
Was on the verge of fading 
Thankfully I 
Woke up in time 

Guardian angel I 
Sail away on an ocean 
With you by my side 
Orange clouds roll by 
They burn into your image 
And you're still alive 

But I closed my eyes 
Steadied my feet on the ground 
Raise my head to the sky 
And though time rolls by 
Still feel like a child 
As I look at the moon 
Maybe I grew up 
A little too soon
