		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "Does complacency come with age 
And do I have the urge to back off?"
Negative
Negative
Back off?
Not happening
I hear that
"I'm over 40, I'm pushing 50"
Whatever
Bring it
Back off?
Negative
Not happening
In fact
I'm stepping it up
I'm training harder
Eating cleaner
I'm training more
I'm learning
And reading 
And studying more now
Than I ever have in my whole life
Do I get dinged up?
Well of course I do
Do I take some injuries?
Yeah
You know what?
No factor
NO FACTOR
Deal with them
You know
You know what I hear?
I heard the clock
Ticking
That's what I hear
AND THE END IS NIGH
And time
Waits
FOR NO MAN

FIGHT!
Fight that ticking clock 
With everything you've got
FIGHT!
Fight that ticking clock 
With everything you've got
Everything you've got
Everything you've got
Every every 
Everything you've got
Every every 
FIGHT!
Fight that ticking clock 
With everything you've got

You young guns out there
18 years old, 20 years old
24 years old
Listen
Life goes by
And it goes by quick
Don't waste those years
Don't waste them
Live them
I know you don't think you're going to live to be 30
Much less 40
But you are
And you will
And the earlier you get in the game
And get on track
The better life you're gonna have
Healthier
Wealthier
Stronger
Smarter
Better
Better
And if you're an old man 
Like me
And you haven't gotten on track yet?
Get on track
Get on it
NOW

FIGHT!
Fight that ticking clock 
With everything you've got
FIGHT!
Fight that ticking clock 
With everything you've got
Everything you've got
Everything you've got
Every every 
Everything you've got
Every every 
FIGHT!
Fight that ticking clock 
With everything you've got

Every
Everyone
Listening to this
Here's the deal
No complacency
NO COMPLAENCY
No backing off
No
Slack
Whatsover
FIGHT
Fight that ticking clock
With everything you've got
So
Like the end of a hard day
You can put your head down
With ease
Satisfied
That you gave it your best

FIGHT!
Fight that ticking clock 
With everything you've got
FIGHT!
Fight that ticking clock 
With everything you've got
Everything you've got
Everything you've got
Every every 
Everything you've got
Every every 
FIGHT!
Fight that ticking clock 
With everything you've got

Everything you've got
Everything you've got
Every every 
Everything you've got
Every every 
Everything you've got
Everything you've got
Every every 
Everything you've got
Every every 
FIGHT
Fight that ticking clock 
With everything you've got
