		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For all those broken tones of lawn
The story of the man who cried wolf
You know it’s really hard to feel
When lovers have not been here
And every time you do it, please don’t
Feels like the world is dreaming
Feels like the worst horizon
Can't be really sure
You are truly going down
For all those broken tones of lawn
Who would have thought that you’d be so far from home?
You know it’s really hard to feel
When lovers have not been here
And every time you do it, please don’t
