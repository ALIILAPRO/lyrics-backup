		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come and put your name on it
Put your name on it
Come and put your name on it
Your name
But you wanna put your name on it
Put your name on it
Come and put your name on it
Ba-ba-baby, uh

It's not even my birthday (my birthday)
But he wanna lick the icing off (the icing off)
I know you want it in the worst way (worst way)
Can't wait to blow my candles out

He want that cake, cake
Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake (but you wanna put your name on it)
Cake, cake, cake

Ooh baby, I like it
You so excited
Don't try to hide it
I'ma make you my bitch
Cake, cake, cake, cake
Cake, cake, cake, cake
Cake, cake, cake, cake (but you wanna put your name on it)
Cake, cake, cake

I know you wanna bite this
It's so enticin'
Nothin' else like this
I'ma make you my bitch

And it's not even my birthday (my birthday)
But you wanna put your name on it
And it's not even my birthday (my birthday)
And he tryna put his name on it
Ooh, I wanna fuck you right now (ooh)
Just get up on my body
