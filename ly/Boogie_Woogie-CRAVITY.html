		  Ddup-ba-dum, ba-boom, ba-boom-bop
Ddup-ba-dum, ba-boom, ba-boom-bop (come on)
(Oh, do boogie) ddup-ba-dum, ba-boom, ba-boom-bop
(A little boogie-woogie is all we need)

Take my hand and grab my hips
Swing around and turn your wrist
Lean back babe and let me lead
A little boogie-woogie is all we need

Hold me tight don't lose your grip
Sometimes you just need a twist
Just lean back babe and let me lead
A little boogie-woogie is all we need

Follow me, follow me to the sunrise
Bullseye, slam dunk, you're the first prize
The way I feel when with you, it's the first time
That's what I like, that's what I like, yeah, yeah

Cherry pie, diet coke, salty french fries
You got all that I want, I'm on cloud nine
The chemicals are going crazy in my mind
That's what I like, that's what I like, yeah, yeah

Ah, come on now (come on now)
Ah, don't stop now (don't stop now)
Ah, come on now (come on now)
(A little boogie-woogie is all we need)

Take my hand and grab my hips
Swing around and turn your wrist
Lean back babe and let me lead
A little boogie-woogie is all we need

Hold me tight don't lose your grip
Sometimes you just need a twist
Just lean back babe and let me lead
A little boogie-woogie is all we need

We go left, we go right, we go high up
Come on, let me take you for a ride, we be close up
Lean back, relax, with your eyes shut
That's what I like, that's what I like, yeah, yeah

We go up, we go down, we go wild now
Boom, boom, boom to the beat and the bass line
No stress, say yes, it's a home run
That's what I like, that's what I like, yeah, yeah

Ah, come on now (come on now)
Ah, don't stop now (don't stop now)
Ah, come on now (come on now)
(A little boogie-woogie is all we need) is all we need

Take my hand and grab my hips
Swing around and turn your wrist
Lean back babe and let me lead
A little boogie-woogie is all we need

Hold me tight don't lose your grip
Sometimes you just need a twist
Just lean back babe and let me lead
A little boogie-woogie is all we need

Ddup-ba-dum, ba-boom, ba-boom-bop
Ddup-ba-dum, ba-boom, ba-boom-bop
Ddup-ba-dum, ba-boom, ba-boom-bop
A little boogie-woogie is all we need

Ddup-ba-dum, ba-boom, ba-boom-bop
Ddup-ba-dum, ba-boom, ba-boom-bop
Ddup-ba-dum, ba-boom, ba-boom-bop

A little boogie-woogie is all we need
A little boogie-woogie is all we need
A little boogie-woogie is all we need

A little boogie-woogie is all we need
A little boogie-woogie is all we need
A little boogie-woogie is all we need
Oh, do boogie

So with me
Take my hand and grab my hips
Swing around and turn your wrist
Lean back babe and let me lead
A little boogie-woogie is all we need

Hold me tight don't lose your grip
Sometimes you just need a twist
Just lean back babe and let me lead
A little boogie-woogie is all we need

Ddup-ba-dum, ba-boom, ba-boom-bop
Ddup-ba-dum, ba-boom, ba-boom-bop
Ddup-ba-dum, ba-boom, ba-boom-bop
A little boogie-woogie is all we need (all we need, yeah)

Ddup-ba-dum, ba-boom, ba-boom-bop
Ddup-ba-dum, ba-boom, ba-boom-bop
(Oh, do boogie) ddup-ba-dum, ba-boom, ba-boom-bop
A little boogie-woogie is all we need
