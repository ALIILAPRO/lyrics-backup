		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

Had hit records on my demo
Did y'all boys not get the memo?
I do not stay at the Intercontinental
And anything I got is not a rental, I own that mothafucka
Figured out this shit is simple
My stock been goin' up like a crescendo
A bunch of handshakes from the fakes
But, nigga, I do not wanna be friends though

I told y'all mothafuckers 
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a "fuck a stripper on a mink rug" song
This a "fuck them boys forever, hold a grudge" song
"Pop some fuckin' champagne in the tub" song
Nigga, "just because" song (damn)

What's the move?
Can I tell truth? If I was doin' this for you
Then I'd have nothin' left to prove, nah
This for me, though
I'm just tryna stay alive and take care of my people
And they don't have no award for that
Trophies, trophies
And they don't have no award for that
Shit don't come with trophies, ain't no envelopes to open
I just do it 'cause I'm 'sposed to, nigga

Bitch, I go to Dreams with a suitcase
I got my whole country on a new wave
She like, "I heard all your niggas stay where you stay"
House so big I haven't seen them boys in two days
Bitch, I use a walkie-talkie just to get a beverage
I saw my parents split up right after the wedding
That taught my ass to stay committed, fuck the credit
Bitch, check the numbers, I'm the one who really get it

I told y'all mothafuckers 
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a "doin' me and only God can judge" song
"I do not know what the fuck you thought it was" song
"Pop some fuckin' champagne in the tub" song
Nigga, "just because" song

What's the move?
Can I tell truth? If I was doin' this for you
Then I have nothin' left to prove, nah
This for me, though
I'm just tryna stay alive and take care of my people
And they don't have no award for that
Trophies, Trophies
And they don't have no award for that
Shit don't come with trophies, ain't no envelopes to open
I just do it 'cause I'm 'sposed to, nigga
