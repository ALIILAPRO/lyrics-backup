		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now I can take this, everything I know 
Realize that I'm nothing I wanted to be 
I can never change anything I've done 
Because it's the only thing I have left 
Blame yourself again for what I didn't do 
Never even knew it was coming from me 
It changed the way I felt, the worst is yet to come 
Because I have gone too far now 

[Chorus] 
Nobody 
Changed my mind 
And it leads me to a new disease 
Somebody 
Let it die 
But it still becomes a new disease 

Is this all worth what this has done to me 
Watered down my senses and turned them on me 
Fuck morality and everything I know 
If I didn't hate this than I couldn't cope 
Impersonate myself for what I used to be 
Denial is all that's left now 

Nobody (repeats x4)
Changed my mind 
And it leads me to a new disease 
Somebody (repeats x4)
Let it die 
But it still becomes a new disease \
But it still becomes a new disease 

Seething in my head 
I'm suffering instead 
I can't remember why 
This meant so much to me doubt 
Did I ever want this? 
It's all I could've been, it's all I would've been doubt 
Did I ever want this? 
It's all I've ever been, it's all I'll ever be 
Seething in my head 
I'm suffering instead 
I can't remember why 
This meant so much to me 

[Chorus]
