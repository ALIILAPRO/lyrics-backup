		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, ow, rock the cradle of love
Rock the cradle of love
Yes, the cradle of love don't rock easily it's true

Well, rock the cradle of love
I rocked the cradle of love
Yes, the cradle of love don't rock easily it's true
Well, now

It burned like a ball of fire
When the rebel took a little child bride
To tease yeah, so go easy yeah, ow

'Cause love cuts a million ways
Shakes the devil when he misbehaves
I ain't nobody's fool
Come on, shake it up
Whatever I do, ow

Rock the cradle of love, woo
Rock the cradle of love
Yes, the cradle of love
Don't rock easily it's true, oh yeah
Sent from heaven above, that's right
To rob the cradle of love
Yes, the pages of love
Don't talk decently it's true, yeah ow

Flesh for your Romeo
Ah yeah, baby
I hear you moan
It's easy
I know how to please me, yeah ow

This love starts my rollin' train
You can't stop it
It ain't in vain
I ain't nobody's fool
Come on, shake it up
Whatever I do, ah ow, woo

These are the wages of love
I know, rock the cradle of love
These are the wages of love
Oh, yeah
Rock the cradle
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ow

Well, it burned like a ball of fire
When the rebel took a little child bride to tease, yeah
To know how to please you, yeah, ow

Well, my love starts a rollin' train
You can't stop it
It ain't in vain
I ain't nobody's fool
Come on, shake it up
Whatever I do, rawr

Rock the cradle of love
Rock the cradle of love
Sent from heaven above, that's right
To rock the cradle of love, ow
Rock the cradle of love, yeah
Cradle of love
That's me mama 
I robbed the devil of love, alright (rock the cradle of love)
Cradle of love
If you tease me, tonight (rock the cradle of love)
And you might sleaze me, alright (cradle of love)
If you appease me, tonight (rock the cradle of love)
And let me ease you, yeah (cradle of love, yeah)
Rock the cradle of love, ooh yeah
Cradle of love, alright
(I said I'll snatch you from salvation soul) rock the cradle of love
Cradle of love (mama)
Yeah, wow
