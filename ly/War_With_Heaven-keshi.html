		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did you get over me?
It's been a long time now
Feels like eternity
It's only been two hours
You out here in them streets
And I got a lot to say
Damn, I'm missing my baby

It feels like everybody's telling me I'm doing too much
And I know I can be dramatic when I want, but so what?
And not to cause a panic, but I'm needing your love
And I can't help but feel a way when you're away, yeah
(I just might)

Might go to war with Heaven
Keeping me away from you so long
Ayy-ayy-ayy
Might go to war with Heaven
'Cause I don't know what else I'd do
If I was away from you so long

These drinks take over me
They're messin' with my head
My insecurities
'Cause you ain't in my bed
My bed, I got a place for you
Really hard to get away from you
It ain't easy, what's a man to do?
What's a man to do?

It feels like everybody's telling me I'm doing too much
And I know I can be dramatic when I want, but so what?
And not to cause a panic, but I'm needing your love
And I can't help but feel a way when you're away, yeah
(I just might)

Might go to war with Heaven
For keeping me away from you so long
Ayy-ayy-ayy
Might go to war with Heaven
'Cause I don't know what else I'd do
If I was away from you so long

(Sha-na-na, na-na)
(Sha-na-na, na-na, oh-oh)
(Sha-na-na, na-na)
(Sha-na-na, na-na, so long)
(Sha-na-na, na-na, sha-na-na, na-na)

'Cause I don't know what else I'd do
If I was away from you so long
