		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They told me not to turn around 
Said I was doin' better now 
Ain't no time for looking down 
But I do
But I do 
But I do

Ain't no easy way to say
But baby when you walk away 
Enough to make a man insane 
Whatcha do
Whatcha do
Whatcha do

Tell me how to get my mind 
Tell me how to get my mind 
Tell me how to get my mind 
Off the love of my life
Tell me how to get my mind 
Tell me how to get my mind 
Tell me how to get my mind 
Off of you

The word has gotten in the street 
They say you ain't no good for me 
I ain't ready to believe
But I do
But I do 
But I do

It's hard to take it sittin' down
It's hard to take it anyhow
They tell me you've been messin' round 
Like you do
Like you do
Like you do

Tell me how to get my mind
Tell me how to get my mind
Tell me how to get my mind 
Off the love of my life
Tell me how to get my mind
Tell me how to get my mind
Tell me how to get my mind
Off of you
