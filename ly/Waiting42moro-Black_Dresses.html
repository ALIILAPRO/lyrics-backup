		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  White noise kinda drown me out
White hot flame kinda melt me down
White hot pain lightning thundercloud
Well,  what the hell else is
There to talk about?
I don't think we can talk it out
We can't talk it out
Never even mattered what I talk about
I don't want ppl listen to me
If I had an answer
You think I'd be singing it?

I don't know anything
And I can't pretend I do
I pretend a lot of things though
So I guess I don't blame you
Every day in this world:
Pretend I'm not scared
Pretend that I'm somewhere else
Pretend that everyone
Doesn't feel this lost as well
Pretend that I can see
Heaven just beyond the sky
But I know it's somewhere else
That's reflected in my eyes

Waiting for tomorrow waiting for tomorrow
Waiting for tomorrow feelin' like shit
Waiting for tomorrow waitin' for tomorrow
Waiting for tomorrow feelin' like shit
Waiting for tomorrow waiting for tomorrow
Waiting for tomorrow feeling like shit
Waitin' for tomorrow waitin' for tomorrow
Waiting for tomorrow fEELIN' LIKE

I can almost see i can almost taste
I can almost touch that better place
In a single day i know everything can change
But this dead world won't go away

Pulling, yanking
Dragging on a thread to heaven
I don't know if it's wrong

Pulling, yankin'
Draggin' on a thread to heaven
I know if I try
I'll just fuck it up worse than it is

A little dirt might cover up the wound

A little dirt might cover up the wound

But a little dirt might infect it too

Infect it too

There's no right choices to make in this life

This life

All you can do is what you can do

I can almost see i can almost taste
I can almost touch that better place
In a single day i know everything can change
But this dead world won't go away
