		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Endangered species, caged in fright
Shot in cold blood, no chance to fight
The stage is set, now pay the price
And ego boost, don't think twice
Technology, the battle's unfair,
You pull the hammer without a care

Squeeze the trigger that makes you Man,
Pseudo-safari, the hunt is canned
The hunt is canned
All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it, this is the countdown to extinction
Tell the truth, you wouldn't dare
The skin and trophy, oh so rare
Silence speaks louder than words
Ignore the guilt and take your turn

'Liars' anagram is lairs
Man you were never even there
Killed a few feet from the cages
Point blank, you're so courageous
So courageous
All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it, this is the countdown to extinction

One hour from now
Another species of life form
Will disappear from the face of the planet
Forever and the rate is accelerating

All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it, this is the countdown to extinction
