		  (Nick, you're stupid)

Damn, homie
I thought you really rock with me
I thought you was gon' hold it down for me, you lied to me
I thought we was cool
Why you want me to die, homie?
Damn, homie
I thought you was my damn, homie
What the fuck happened to you?
How you change on me?
I'm on fifty, gotta keep a Glock with me just in case they not with me, huh

Damn, homie, bands on me (bands)
How you gon' call the feds on me? (Huh?)
I ain't got no homies, all my niggas just like blood-brothers
Family, look
Hand on the butt, dance on me (dance on me)
Sand to the beach, sand on me (sand on me)
A lot of enemies, I get 'em out of here before I let 'em get to me (yeah)
Been givin' out headshots for little broski
Spin the block until them niggas all stop breathin'
Don't wanna talk it out, too late for sympathy
We gon' wipe a nigga nose if he don't stop sneezin'
We ain't even 'til you get hit with the lemon squeeze ('til you get hit with the-)
Hit 'em all up and now we even Steven
Step right on a mouse before you eat the cheese
Fuckin' with her feelings, now she sick of me
I don't want your love, I want your energy
I fuck with you the most 'cause you can keep a secret
And when she open up, I let her vent to me
Arch your back on me, now she won't stop leakin'
You always got my back, you're like my backbone
She gon' pick it up when the phone start ringin'
When I leave the crib, I bring the racks home
Tears fall down Melody's eyes when I'm leavin' (huh?)

Damn, homie
I thought you really rock with me
I thought you was gon' hold it down for me, you lied to me
I thought we was cool
Why you want me to die, homie?
Damn, homie
I thought you was my damn, homie
What the fuck happened to you?
How you change on me?
I'm on fifty, gotta keep a Glock with me just in case they not with me, huh

Many men
How many niggas you had shot?
How many men?
I erased my past 'cause I love you
I'll take a chance, got me where you want me, I'm a hundred grand
If you catch a nigga who had did it, I'll give you a hundred grand
You wash your pain away with a hundred Xans
And at the time, I ain't understand
Nigga stabbed me in my back, I gave him another chance
Another chance, and another chance
You told me I was family, treat me like a orphan
I done broke the money down into a hundred portions
Broke it down with different niggas, went through a hundred courses
I'm the voice of the streets, it ain't a hundred voices
Sit your ass down with the unemployment
How you claim the streets? You ain't did nothin' for it
Streets, family, family, streets, tug of war
I'm mixin' Percocet with lean, I'm feelin' paranoid

Damn, homie
I thought you really rock with me
I thought you was gon' hold it down for me, you lied to me
I thought we was cool
Why you want me to die, homie?
Damn, homie
I thought you was my damn, homie
What the fuck happened to you?
How you change on me?
I'm on fifty, gotta keep a Glock with me just in case they not with me, huh
