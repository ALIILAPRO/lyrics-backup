		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna see all my friends at once

You know how we do
5:02, past the curfew
In Shibuya, eating udon, it's what we into
Life in our lap
Time always miss you

I wanna see all my friends at once
I wanna see all my friends at once

They seen the cars, they seen the shows
The roads we've been down nobody knows
Memories intact
I know you got my back
Rippin' and runnin'
It's a shame how we stuntin'

I wanna see all my friends at once
I wanna see all my friends at once

Like a blaze in the distance
I can see you
What's missing
Oh, if you take me out the system
And just look at me for who I am

I wanna see all my friends at once
I wanna see all my friends at once

I wanna see all my friends at once
