		  Come together oh oh
Come together oh oh
Come together oh oh
Come together 

Kiss me, won't you won't you kiss me
Won't you won't you kiss me
Lift me right out of this world
Trip me, won't you won't you trip me
Won't you won't you trip me
Lift me ride me to the stars 

I'm free you're free
I'm free I want you to touch me
Come touch me
Now it's all too much
All too much
All too much

Kiss me, won't you won't you kiss me
Won't you won't you kiss me
Lift me right out of this world
Trip me, won't you won't you trip me
Won't you won't you trip me
Lift me ride me to the stars

I'm free you're free
I'm free I want you to touch me
Come touch me
Now it's all too much
All too much
All too much

Come together oh oh
Come together oh oh
Come together as one
Come together as one
Up and away
Come together oh yeah
Up and away
