		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Watch them flee, watch them flee
Wa-wa-watch them flee, hip-hop heads
"And you do it like this"

(It's goin' down) it's goin' down
(It's goin' down) it's goin' down
(It's goin' down) it's goin' down
(It's goin' down) 

It's goin' down
The rhythm projects 'round the next sound
Reflects the complex hybrid dialect now
Detect the mesh of many elements compressed down
The meltin' pot of a super-futuresque style
The combination of a vocal caress
With lungs that gasp for breath from emotional stress
With special effects and a distorted collage
Carefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage

It's goin' down
A logical progression on the timeline
The separation narrowed down to a fine line
To blur the edges so they blend together properly
Take you on an audible odyssey, now 

It's goin' down
A logical progression on the timeline
The separation narrowed down to a fine line
To blur the edges so they blend together properly
Take you on an audible odyssey, now 

It's goin' down, put it out for the world to see
LP and X-Men to the 10th degree
(It's goin' down) nobody in the world is safe
When we melt down the wax in your record crate

(It's goin' down) put it out for the world to see
LP and X-Men to the 10th degree
(It's goin' down) nobody in the world is safe
When we melt down the wax in your record crate

(It's goin' down)
"Put it on"
"I said it goes like this" 
"And you do it like this" 
It's goin' down

Once again it is
Composed sentences all together venomous
The four elements of natural force
Projected daily through the sound of the source
Everybody on board as we blend the sword with the pen
The mightiest of weapons swingin' right from the chin
The elevate of mental states long gone with the wind
To defend men for shoddy imitation pretends
It's goin' down
Style assimilation, readily
Trekkin' through the weaponry of a pure pedigree
Cleverly seein' through whatever is ahead of me
Whatever the weather be, we're advancin' steadily
It's goin' down to sub-terrestrial hot
I rhyme regiment that's callin' the shots
Execution of collaborative plots
Ready to bring the separation of style to a stop

It's goin' down
A logical progression on the timeline
The separation narrowed down to a fine line
To blur the edges so they blend together properly
Take you on an audible odyssey, now 

It's goin' down, put it out for the world to see
LP and X-Men to the 10th degree
(It's goin' down) nobody in the world is safe
When we melt down the wax in your record crate

(It's goin' down) put it out for the world to see
LP and X-Men to the 10th degree
(It's goin' down) nobody in the world is safe
When we melt down the wax in your record crate

"X-men 'bout to blast off world wide" 
"X-men 'bout to blast off world wide" 
"And you do it like this"
"'Bout to blast off world wide" 

It's goin' down, put it out for the world to see
LP and X-Men to the 10th degree
(It's goin' down) nobody in the world is safe
When we melt down the wax in your record crate

(It's goin' down) put it out for the world to see
LP and X-Men to the 10th degree
(It's goin' down) nobody in the world is safe
When we melt down the wax in your record crate

(It's goin' down) it's goin' down
(It's goin' down) it's goin' down
(It's goin' down) it's goin' down
(It's goin' down) 

(It's goin' down) 
"Put it on, and it goes like this"
(It's goin' down) 
"And you do it like this"
(It's goin' down) 
"So put it on, and it goes like this"
(It's goin' down) 
"And you do it like this"
"Like this"
"Like this"
"Like this"
"Like this"
"Like this"
"Like this"
"Like this"
