		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Her knees, feet and elbow
Work their thing into a mamba
The scene starts to crumble
To the sound of the drums
Oh boy, there ain't no need to buy that diamond ring
It ain't no big thing, just show her a little swing

No care about the bling bling bro
There ain't nothing to do
Oh man soon it's over and you'll
Sing the walking blues
So boy, there ain't no need to buy that diamond ring
It ain't no big thing, just show her a little swing

When you're up
When you're down
And there ain't no love around

There's a place
For you my friend
There's a way
For you my friend

Just show her some swing
It ain't no big thing, just show her a little swing
