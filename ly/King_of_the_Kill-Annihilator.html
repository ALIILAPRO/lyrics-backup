		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I rule the jungle, I rule it with pride
I'm judge and jury, you life I decide
I have awaken for my nightly feast
A reign of terror, beware of the beast

Don't try to run there's no way to survive
A vicious surrender I'll eat you alive
No one is safe until I get my kill
All hear my warning I king of the kill
Kill

Stalking the land for the scent of my prey
Stopping for nothing don't get in my way
Left to the vultures your life is denied
I rule the jungle I rule it with pride

Don't try to run there's no way to survive
A vicious surrender I'll eat you alive
No one is safe until I get my kill
All hear my warning I king of the kill
Kill
