		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la

It's been a long year
The toughest of my life so far
I've tried to feel cheer
I'm further than the Northern Star
So when you ask me
What I want under the tree
I just want you with me

'Cause if I didn't have you
When the snow is fallin'
On that winter mornin'
I'd have Christmas blues
If I didn't have you
When everyone's unwrapping
No matter what I open
I'd have Christmas blues

Yeah, don't want mistletoes
If I'm not there to hold you close (hold me close)
A quiet Christmas Eve
Not tryna hear the angels sing, ay (hear the angels sing)
If I had one wish
I'll take you down by the tree
'Cause all I want is you and me

'Cause if I didn't have you
When the snow is fallin'
On that winter mornin'
I'd have Christmas blues
If I didn't have you (if I didn't have you)
When everyone's unwrapping (oh)
No matter what I open (ooh)
I'd have Christmas blues

If I didn't have you (if I didn't have)
Ohh (If I didn't have)
Ohh (If I din't have)
I'd have Christmas blues

Christmas blues

Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la
