		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I'm bad news
With that said, when I win, I lose
Taking back everything I said to you
I can't tell my own lies from the truth but

I wish you'd call, you wouldn't
Know you too well, it's stupid
Go back to it all, we shouldn't
Caught up in what this brings
Get back in the swing of things

I can't get back in the swing of things
I can't get back in the swing of things, yet
I'm so caught up in my old feelings
I can't get back in the swing of things, yet

Is your heart out on your sleeve?
Now you're gone
Is the grass more green
From where you're from?
Are you stuck in the weeds or are you not?
Do you think of me? Oh

I wish you'd call, you wouldn't
Know you too well, it's stupid
Go back to it all, we shouldn't
Caught up in what this brings
Get back in the swing of things

I can't get back in the swing of things
I can't get back in the swing of things, yet
I'm so caught up in my old feelings
I can't get back in the swing of things, yet

Once you're gone, I want you back
I'll pick you up, but leave you stranded
Only want what I can't have
Taking everything for granted
I've just got some bad habits

I can't get back in the swing of things
I can't get back in the swing of things, yet
I'm so caught up in my old feelings
I can't get back in the swing of things, yet
Back in the swing of things
I can't get back in the swing of things, yet
I'm so caught up in my old feelings
I can't get back in the swing of things, yet
