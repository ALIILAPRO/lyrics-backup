		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They told him don't you ever come around hereDon't want to see your face, you better disappearThe fire's in their eyes and their words are really clearSo beat it, just beat itYou better run, you better do what you canDon't want to see no blood, don't be a macho manYou want to be tough, better do what you canSo beat it, but you want to be badJust beat it, beat it, beat it, beat itNo one wants to be defeatedShowin' how funky and strong is your fightIt doesn't matter who's wrong or rightJust beat it, beat itJust beat it, beat itJust beat it, beat itJust beat it, beat itThey're out to get you, better leave while you canDon't want to be a boy, you want to be a manYou want to stay alive, better do what you canSo beat it, just beat itYou have to show them that you're really not scaredYou're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dareThey'll kick you, then they beat you,Then they'll tell you it's fairSo beat it, but you want to be badJust beat it, beat it, beat it, beat itNo one wants to be defeatedShowin' how funky and strong is your fightIt doesn't matter who's wrong or rightJust beat it, beat it, beat it, beat itNo one wants to be defeatedShowin' how funky and strong is your fightIt doesn't matter who's wrong or rightJust beat it, beat it, beat it, beat itNo one wants to be defeatedShowin' how funky and strong is your fightIt doesn't matter who's wrong or rightJust beat it, beat itBeat it, beat it, beat itNo one wants to be defeatedShowin' how funky and strong is your fightIt doesn't matter who's wrong or who's rightJust beat it, beat it, beat it, beat itNo one wants to be defeatedShowin' how funky and strong is your fightIt doesn't matter who's wrong or rightJust beat it, beat it, beat it, beat itNo one wants to be defeatedShowin' how funky and strong is your fightIt doesn't matter who's wrong or rightJust beat it, beat itBeat it, beat it, beat it
