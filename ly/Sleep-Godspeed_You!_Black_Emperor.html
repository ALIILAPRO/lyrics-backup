this next piece are spoke words from the song by an older man
speaking of past memories. this is also written in out to match
the man's dialect. hence, Coney Allen and not Coney Island.

And-ah... Anyways, lets see what else I-I, eh..
It was Coney Allen, they called Coney Allen the playground of the world.
There was no place like it, in the whole world.., like Coney Allen when I was a youngster.
No place in the world like it!
It was so fabulous, now it's shrunk down to almost nothing, you see, eh-heh.
And I still remember, in my mind how things used to be.
And-ah you know I feel very bad.
But people from all over the world came here, from all over the world.
There was a playground they called the playground of the worlds, over here.
Anyways, so but I-ah you know.
i even got, when I was very small I even got lost in Coney Allen.
But they found me. On the beach.
And we used to sleep on the beach here, sleep over night.
They don't do it anymore.. things changed.
They dont sleep anymore on the beach...
