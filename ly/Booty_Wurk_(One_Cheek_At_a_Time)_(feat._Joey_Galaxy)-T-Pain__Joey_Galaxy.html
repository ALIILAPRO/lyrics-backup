		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, gotta be cool baby, you know what I'm saying?

Jump out your car in the middle of the street
Open up your trunk, let the bass beat
Go 'head, go 'head
You gotta walk up in the club bare-footed
I like that booty, you know where to put it
Go 'head, go 'head

Little mama you look so professional
I'm followin' you, sweating you
I can't believe I'm doing what I'm doin
What is wrong with my head? Go 'head
'Cause baby I like how you're working it
I'm watching you, you're twerking it
I'm trying get you out of this club 
And get you off in my bed
(Ohh, oh-oh) Go 'head, yeah

Now let me see that booty work, booty work, booty boo boo booty work
Booty work, booty work, boo boo boo boo booty work
Go 'head, (left cheek, left, right, double cheek, do it)
Go 'head (left cheek, left, right, double cheek, do it)
Now let me see the booty work, booty work, booty boo boo booty work
Left cheek, right cheek, left cheek, right cheek

Show off, show off, show off (left cheek, left, right, double cheek, do it), boom
Show off, show off, show off (left cheek, left, right, double cheek, do it), boom

Pause (damn)

Black car, black rims
Black shirt, black Tims
(Leggo, leggo) Come on baby keep on doing what you're doing
(Leggo, leggo) Come on baby keep on doing what you're doing

Holy moly, look at her
She got the boots with the fur
(Leggo, leggo) Come on baby keep on doing what you're doing
(Leggo, leggo) Come on baby keep on doing what you're doing

Lil mama I can see that thong on you
The DJ play this song for you
I'm trying to drive my stick shift 
All over them curves, say word

If you keep playing with my feelings 
We gonna get it, get it, get it
Girl I represent the Nappy Boy Clique
So I know that you heard (ohh, oh-oh), say word
(Nappy Boy)

Now let me see that booty work, booty work, booty boo boo booty work
Booty work, booty work, boo boo boo boo booty work
Go 'head, (left cheek, left, right, double cheek, do it)
Go 'head (left cheek, left, right, double cheek, do it)
Now let me see the booty work, booty work, booty boo boo booty work
Left cheek, right cheek, left cheek, right cheek

Show off, show off, show off (left cheek, left, right, double cheek, do it), boom
Show off, show off, show off (left cheek, left, right, double cheek, do it), boom

Girl it must be a crime to be as fine as you (as fine as you, aha)
You know exactly what I'm tryna do (tryna do), you see me
I'm trying to keep it jumping (jumping)
Girl I got a Chevy with hydraulics and you're reminding me of it (of it)
Up and down, up and down, girl you know what's happening (what's happening)
'Round of applause ('plause), keep that booty clapping (clapping)
Them other girls lacking what you're packing (packing)
And you got them embarrassed by what you got from your parents (parents)
I'm trying to see them shorts (see them shorts) spread apart
I ain't coming up short (up short) Kevin Hart (Kevin Hart)

Now take off, come on baby keep on doing what you're doing
Take off, come on baby keep on doing what you're doing
Move your feet (move ya feet) cut a rug (cut a rug)
Put your hands up if you're the baddest in the club, ha

Take off, come on baby keep on doing what you're doing
Girl I'm tryna get you next to me but first you gotta let me see that

Booty work, booty work, booty boo boo booty work
Booty work, booty work, boo boo boo boo booty work
Go 'head, (left cheek, left, right, double cheek, do it)
Go 'head (left cheek, left, right, double cheek, do it)
Now let me see the booty work, booty work, booty boo boo booty work
Left cheek, right cheek, left cheek, right cheek

Show off, show off, show off (left cheek, left, right, double cheek, do it), boom
Show off, show off, show off (left cheek, left, right, double cheek, do it), boom
