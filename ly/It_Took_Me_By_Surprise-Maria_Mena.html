		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I would react badly
To the slightest hint of hesitance
He'd bend awkwardly to suit my mood
No word from his defense

I'd cry knowing how my tears
Felt like acid burning through his skin
Pushed every little button
But the right one that would let me in

Now he's afraid of me
Now he's afraid of me

It took me by surprise
The hatred in his eyes
I've pushed this man as far as he could go
But he lacked the words to let me know
He acted out, now I can see it is my fault

I made changes
That went unnoticed
Sang songs for deaf ears
He mistook my silence for punishment
As it had been all these years
I'd cry knowingly how my tears felt like acid burning through his skin

Now he's afraid of me
Now he's afraid of me

It took me by surprise
The hatred in his eyes
I've pushed this man as far as he could go
But he lacked the words to let me know
He acted out, now I can see it is my fault
