		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My baby sticky & disgusting
But I love it keep it coming
Why you frontin
You could make a million chips if you keep bluffing
'05 fuck 'em
Summer 17 I made some outta nothing
Told her my Russian a lil rusty
Just keep sucking dont say nothing
She gave me Takka and that guava flavor cocktail
Got me feelin woozy
Kishimoto in her power suit
The way she pop her pussy
Feeling like a centipede off ketamine and lemon lavender cookie
Keep it pushing you cu make a million if you stop the bullshit
Baby Joe Exotic with the cat the way she make it purr
She's my Ramona Flowers baby it's just us against the world
Baby got the cadence & patience to make a million pearls
I seen a lot of things you never thought cu change that type of girl
