		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Head lice, I think I'm itching again
'Cause nothing feels right, I'm gonna jump off the edge
Another red light, and I keep running it through
Yeah, I keep running it through like I got nothing to lose

I'm on the same shit, babe, we at the same damn place
I wanna break my face, I wanna feel something
I like the way you think, we'll make the same ship sink
I wouldn't change a thing, I wouldn't change a thing
Yeah, hang tight, fuck that, I'm gone like a bus pass
You told me you love me, but my trauma doesn't trust that
Split a pill, crush that, guess I'm still a rugrat
Running from these problems, switching lanes in a truck hat

Mmm, Hollywood's unlocked
Mmm, brain dead, heart stop

These fucking head lice, I think I'm itching again
'Cause nothing feels right, I'm gonna jump off the edge
Another red light, and I keep running it through
Yeah, I keep running it through like I got nothing to lose
It's just the head lice, I think I'm itching again
'Cause nothing feels right, I'm gonna jump off the edge
Another red light, and I keep running it through
Yeah, I keep running it through like I got nothing to lose

Daylights, burning me, feels like eternity
In the same night, I keep on doing what's hurting me
And it ain't right, what's deep inside, I need surgery
Or a drain pipe, to throw my life away, yeah
Blame it on me, you can fuck that, yeah
Only paranoia wants that, yeah
Telling me that you're in love with me
But my trauma never could trust that, yeah
Always down to split pills, yeah
Show me something that's real, yeah
I'm head strong but I'm dead wrong if I let you leave here, 'cause

Mmm (yeah, yeah), Hollywood's unlocked
Mmm (yeah, yeah), brain dead, heart stop

It's just the head lice, I think I'm itching again
'Cause nothing feels right, I'm gonna jump off the edge
Another red light, and I keep running it through (yeah)
Yeah, I keep running it through like I got nothing to lose (yeah)
It's just the head lice, I think I'm itching again
'Cause nothing feels right, I'm gonna jump off the edge
Another red light (yeah), and I keep running it through
Yeah, I keep running it through like I got nothing to lose

And this day happens over again and again and again
