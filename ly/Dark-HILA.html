		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Staring in the mirror
Who is she
Touched the glass
To find a piece of me
Forgot my birthday
Guess I'm not surprised
I can't count how many times you made me cry
Had you falling
Nonstop calling
Ended up on my knees crawling
I'm embarrassed
Look at you next to me
I would rather drink the poison
Then to be near you not knowing
All the ways that you could ruin sweet things
Be quiet
Don't tell me that I'm going crazy
Watch out
I'll take you down
No one to blame me
I found
Out what you said you're getting lazy
And now
I'll leave you in the dark
How'd I end up on your street
You look so peaceful when you sleep
Call me the girl of your dreams
Cmon please
Boy I'm such a tease
Now you want me
Won't stop calling
Ended up on your knees crawling
I'm embarrassed look at you begging me
Body's filling up with poison
This is something you've been knowing
All the ways that you could ruin sweet things
Be quiet
Don't tell me that I'm going crazy
Watch out
I'll take you down
No one to blame me
I found
Out what you said you're getting lazy
And now
I'll leave you in the dark
In the dark
I'll leave you in the dark
In the dark
Call out my name while I watch you burn
You'll see my face everywhere you turn
Swear that I could make it hell for you
Now look at what you made me do
Be quiet be quiet be quiet
Watch out watch out watch out
I found I found I found
Left you in the dark
