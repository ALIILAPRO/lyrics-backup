		  [Instrumental] 

[Once more back in 1827 Vienna,
he tells Fate that he would not change a thing from
his past and risk losing the music.
The music is who he is, the reason for his existence.
Also, having seen the influence of his music on so
many lives, he knows that he could never give the music
to Mephistopheles. Still, he does not wish to lose
his soul. Desperately he ponders his dilemma.]
