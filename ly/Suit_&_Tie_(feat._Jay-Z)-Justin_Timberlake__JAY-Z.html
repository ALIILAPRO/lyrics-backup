		<p>
		  I be on my suit and tie shit, tie shit, tie
I be on my suit and tie shit, tie shit
Can I show you a few things?
A few things, a few things, little baby 'cause
I be on my suit and tie shit, tie shit
I be on my suit and tie shit, tie shit
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things

Wait a minute, you ready, JT?

I can't wait 'til I get you on the floor, good-looking
Going out so hot, just like an oven
And I'll burn myself, but just had to touch it
It's so fly and it's all mine
Hey baby, we don't mind all the watching, hi
'Cause if they study close, real close, they might learn something
She ain't nothing but a little doozy when she does it
She's so fly (she's so fly) tonight

And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things (show you a few things)
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things (show you a few things)
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things, about love
While we're in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things, about love, hey

Stop, let me get a good look at it
Ooh so thick, now I know why they call it a fatty
And oh shit so sick got a hit and picked up a habit
That's alright, 'cause you're all mine
Ooh go on and show 'em who you call daddy
I guess they're just mad 'cause girl, they wish they had it
Ooh my killer, my "Thriller" yeah you're a classic
And you're all mine tonight

And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things (show you a few things)
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things (show you a few things)
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things, about love
While we're in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things, about love, hey

Get out ya seat, Hov, uh
All black at the white shows
White shoes at the black shows
Green card for the Cuban lynx
Y'all sit back and enjoy the light show
Nothing exceeds like excess
Stoute got gout from having the best of the best, is this what it's all about?
I'm at the restaurant with my rent, disturbing the guests
Years of distress, tears on the dress
Try to hide her face with some makeup sex, uh
This is truffle season
Tom Ford tuxedos for no reason
All Saints for my angel
Alexander Wang too
Ass-tight denim and some Dunks
I'll show you how to do this young, uh!
No papers, catch vapors
Get high, out Vegas
D'usses on doubles, ain't looking for trouble
You just got good genes so a nigga tryna cuff you
Tell your mother that I love her 'cause I love you
Tell your father we go farther as a couple
They ain't lose a daughter, got a son
I show you how to do this hun!

As long as I've got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
Baby got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things (show you a few things)
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things (show you a few things)
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things, about love (love, love)
(Let, let) let me show you a few things
Show you a few things, about love, hey oh
