		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I called my brother, yelling out
I fell in love and then fell out
And I don't know if I can take the hit
I let a stranger in my bed
I pretended you were him
'Cause I needed to feel wanted

I gotta
Oh, I gotta find another way
Another way
I gotta
Oh, I gotta find another way
Another way

I'm learning to live
I'm trying to be better
I'm learning to give
But I don't know if I'm a giver

I'm learning to live
I'm trying to be better
I'm learning to give
But I don't know if I'm a giver
I don't know if I'm a giver

Every day's another shot
But all I do is fuck it up
Screaming 'cause I've got it too good to cry
I put the medicine inside my head
Apologize for all the things I said
Girl it takes guts to just survive

I gotta
Oh, I gotta find another way
Another way

I'm learning to live
I'm trying to be better
I'm learning to give
But I don't know if I'm a giver

I'm learning to live
I'm trying to be better
I'm learning to give
But I don't know if I'm a giver
I don't know if I'm a giver
I don't know if I'm a giver
 
I got so much soul in my body
But no one keeping me honest
And whole days turn into holes in my mind
I got high hopes lots of potential
I'm high, broke, searching for symbols
And I will not let go of what is mine

I got so much soul in my body
But no one keeping me honest
And whole days turn into holes in my mind
I got high hopes lots of potential
I'm high, broke, searching for symbols
And I will not let go of what is mine

I'm learning to live
I'm trying to be better
I'm learning to give
But I don't know if I'm a giver

I'm learning to live
I'm trying to be better
I'm learning to give
But I don't know if I'm a giver
I don't know if I'm a giver
