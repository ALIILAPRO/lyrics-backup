		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Glock 4 Peezy, this shit too easy (too easy)
These fuckin' rap niggas be talkin' too greazy (too greazy)
Say it's smoke, well run up on me, nigga, when you see me (see me)
Pussy (fuck 'em)
Murder on my mind, I been up all night
Two bad bitches tryna fuck all night
Heard we was in the club, he had to duck all night
I told 'em catch 'em at the let-out, shoot his truck on sight
Niggas ain't got it (got it), niggas ain't 'bout it ('bout it)
Hundred cash large, black card in my pocket (pocket)
Rose gold Richie (Richie), I don't even rock it (double)
Brand new Benz for what? (Woo) 'Cause I don't even drive it
Niggas diss, I ain't respondin', I'm like, "Y'all ain't even poppin'"
'Cause we been mobbin', flyin' private, different islands (woo, free Slime)
And I ain't lyin', I got this money shit to a science
Got your baby mama in the Bahamas actin' different and she wildin'
Off that 42, get turnt like Dugg and 'em (free Dugg)
'Bout that cash, it get real slimey, talk like Thug and 'em (free Thug)
Niggas say they fuck with us, but we don't fuck with them (fuck 'em)
My youngin' get that choppa, turn to Andre, he start drummin' 'em (brrt, boss)

Grew up in the projects, jumpin' on the roof (yeah)
Garbage bag full of dollars, I could front a movie (movie)
Young Jimmy Iovine of the crime scene (woo)
Leave a nigga whole team on them IVs (ah, brrt)
Point 'em out and put 'em on obituaries (splat, brrt)
Love or business, either or, it's only temporary (ha)
Carol City niggas, never known to sympathetic (Carol City)
I'm 'bout the money, you can miss me with your freaky fetish (woo)
Straight from Star Island, take me to Jamaica (Lord)
Three-hundred foot yacht, never droppin' anchor (huh)
Count a thousand pounds as we ride around (one thousand)
Disrespect is not allowed so we shot him down (brrt)
Bricks in the crate, first forty-eight (brrt)
Lamborghini out the box, so who wanna race? (Wow)
My attorney talkin' facts, rats on the tape (huh)
I'm talkin' money off the top then count it in your face (biggest)

M-M-M
Gang, you know?
