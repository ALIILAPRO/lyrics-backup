		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A sad fate, a fool's game
Shattered and divided
Sick man, make your final play
A thin line crossed to find
The secrets you've been hiding
From now on, nothing is the same
Some people never change

So damn you
What are you hiding?
It was you who brought this on for way too long
(For way too long)
A sad truth
To be reminded
For we have done no wrong, it's not our fault
(It's not our fault)

But you want so much more
Than we should ever have to give

Sin after sin
Sin after sin

As you adorn your crown of thorns
And play the pure messiah
Your flock will come to know the beast you are
I've seen your kind before, oh

So damn you
What are you hiding?
It was you who brought this on for way too long
(For way too long)
A sad truth
To be reminded
For we have done no wrong, it's not our fault
(It's not our fault)

But you want so much more
Than we should ever have to give

Sin after sin
Sin after sin
Sin after sin
Sin after sin
Sin after sin

Push us all away
One day you'll wake up lost to find
All you had has been replaced
And buried by your lies (your lies)

So damn you
What are you hiding?
It was you who brought this on for way too long
(For way too long)
A sad truth
To be reminded
For we have done no wrong, it's not our fault
(It's not our fault)

Sin after sin (sin after sin)
Sin after sin (sin after sin)
Sin after sin
Sin after sin
Sin after sin
It's not our fault, no, no
