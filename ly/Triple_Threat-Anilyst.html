		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Damn

I’ma make you dance, you dance I’m a triple threat
I’ma make you bounce bounce bounce so hard until you break your head
I’ma keep it drunk and drunk I’ma space for that
It’s so hard hard hard that you barely in your ?

Mi-mi-Missy and I and I we we music ?
Ten years later watch the..do do we reconnect
A hundred and twenty millions old soul and them niggas bad
I bet you see how many niggas how they they can do do that

I say Missy and I going up, triple leader in our cup
Missy and I going up, triple leader in our cup
Missy and I going up, triple leader in our cup
Triple leader in our cup, triple leader in our cup
Missy and I going up, triple leader in our cup
Triple leader in our cup, triple leader in our cup
Missy and I going up, triple lead in our cup
Triple leader in our cup, triple leader in our cup

I bet that one lead, two lead, in my cup margarita
Roll up in my two seat I'm a pretty diva call me senorita
Have you seen a new Medina I don't do grass but I'm a mister Mina
I'm so fresh I front the cleaner triple threat rap dance and I'm a singer
Get the finger, middle finger me to my let a new..
? bottle bingin he's like being in ?
Timby and I throwin up, whatever we do here we blow
He so hot so popular, I told you we can't mess it up

Missy and I going up, triple leader in our cup
Missy and I going up, triple leader in our cup
Missy and I going up, triple leader in our cup
Triple leader in our cup, triple leader in our cup
Missy and I going up, triple leader in our cup
Triple leader in our cup, triple leader in our cup
Missy and I going up, triple lead in our cup
Triple leader in our cup, triple leader in our cup

Let's go!
Guess who back yet on the desk
I'm that chick, 'cause I'm a triple threat
Two fifty mill and who can top that
I slap who ever said I'm unrelevant
Got em pissed them man and I'm upset
Music there we make it resurrect
Watch our step you better com,e correct
If you go get such you're gonna lose your bed
Up the bed and tell me who's next
Nasty flow call it triple ass
Got my drink I'm sipping all that
I'll fake her that's a fake Rolex
Timmy and I throw it up, whatever we drink show up blow up
See this leader in our cup
We VIP when we roll up

Missy and I going up, triple leader in our cup
Missy and I going up, triple leader in our cup
Missy and I going up, triple leader in our cup
Triple leader in our cup, triple leader in our cup
Missy and I going up, triple leader in our cup
Triple leader in our cup, triple leader in our cup
Missy and I going up, triple lead in our cup
Triple leader in our cup, triple leader in our cup

Yeah
Yeah
Check!

Now I’m in the 9th inning,
Thought I fell off, I ain’t quite finish
Yeah I’m bout to put my foot in it
Talk with it, walk with it I’m no gim it yeah
2012 there’ll be no games
Real rap, real bars, I’m not playin’
Haters all lane you are missing thing
I’m a beast and above I’m just sayin
Yeah I make em wanna get loud,
Duck with it, buck with it, let’s go
Every time I spit around it’s a sick flow
The new comers better seat back and take no, yeah
They say my time,
Here I come better run take what’s mine
Bout to let off like it take nine
This rhyme gonna make and push re-whyne, yeah
Yeah I’m so hot, up on the charts number one spot
See me when I drop when I won’t flop
This will never stop got the music get all loud
Wanna get served, you third you second but I come first
Flip my verse like I flip burst
I’m fat, yes sir

We hitmakin', hitbreakin', partyshakin', innovative
Groundbreakin', so creative,
We be the most anticipated.
We hitmakin', hitbreakin', partyshakin', innovative
