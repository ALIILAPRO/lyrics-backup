		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been through pain, I need healing
I been through pain, I need healing
I been through pain, I need healing
I gotta hide what I'm sipping
My bitch don't like when I'm sipping
Think I'm reaching my limit I know you really don't get it

All the money we spending, all of this money we getting
We getting high we ain't landing
They talk bout shit they ain't been in
My shooters pulling up candid
We shoot them shots where he standing
My shooters leaving them rancid
We slump that boy like It's ten xans

Be alone, be alone
These hoes be fake so I be alone
So I just be alone, bitch I just be a
So I just be alone
I roll this weed up, I pour this three up
I pour this three alone
I pour this three up, I pour this uh

Hey, woah
Bitch I do not need you
Roll blunts I need three, two
Got Shaq I got three, two
Nigga said what? We gone bleed you
Chop sing like The Dream too
I like my bitch a lil' mean too
My bitch yeah she mean too

I been through pain, I need healing
I been through pain, I need healing
I been through pain, I need healing
I gotta hide what I'm sipping
My bitch don't like when I'm sipping
Think I'm reaching my limit I know you really don't get it

All the money we spending, all of this money we getting
We getting high we ain't landing
They talk bout shit they ain't been in
My shooters pulling up candid
We shoot them shots where he standing
My shooters leaving them rancid
We slump that boy like it's ten xans
