		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can open up to me
Show me what's inside
Mother nature made us to intertwine
Lavender elixir so
Full of pheromones
Gimme one taste and you're gone
What if I can't get you out of my thoughts?
What if my seasons don't change?
What if you forget to forget me not
And we fade away?

You're my little flower
Blooming in the night
Only for an hour
The northern lights
My Casablanca sweetheart
Nectar so divine
Baby, you're the best part of my life

What can I do?
What can I say?
To convince you to stay?
All I see are tulips and
I'm a hummingbird
Heavenly ambrosia in every curve
Honey dripping over my imagination
The fragrance
Keeps flowin' straight down to my soul
What if I can't get you out of my thoughts?
What if my seasons don't change?
What if you love me then you love me not
And we fade away?
You're my little flower
Blooming in the night
Only for an hour
The northern lights
My Casablanca sweetheart
Nectar so divine
Baby, you're the best part of my life

What can I do?
What can I say?
To convince you to stay?
Yeah
Oh
Yeah
Oh
Yeah
Oh
Yeah
Oh
