		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rushing forward into violence
Methodical yet deranged
Gaping wounds of victims spraying blood into the air

Killing all that stands before them
Barbaric acts of the insane
Hapless prey, there was no way they ever could prepare

Overlords of violence, jagged blade dripping blood
They mock the cowards as they turn tail and run
Force of the ruthless bearing down on the weak
Powerless to stop it, they're in full retreat

Overlords of violence, steel club breaking bones
They kill their rivals and all who oppose
Force of the ruthless, there is no escape
No quarter given, the captured are slain

Charging madmen swing their weapons
The weaklings shudder at their might
Mangled dying beg for mercy that they won't receive

Slaughter those that would defy them
Dismember them and mount on spikes
Limbs and heads of the defeated sharpened axes cleave

Overlords of violence, a pitiless horde
Dominion of the cutthroats expanding through war
Force of the ruthless, raw power of hate
The meek inherit nothing, they will not be saved

Overlords of violence, long may they reign
Triumph of the murderers, a vile new age
Force of the ruthless will dominate life
Empire of the killers, a dark endless night
Slaughter them

Overlords of violence, jagged blade dripping blood
They mock the cowards as they turn tail and run
Force of the ruthless bearing down on the weak
Powerless to stop it, they're in full retreat

Overlords of violence, steel club breaking bones
They kill their rivals and all who oppose
Force of the ruthless, there is no escape
No quarter given, the captured are slain

Overlords of violence, a pitiless horde
Dominion of the cutthroats expanding through war
Force of the ruthless, raw power of hate
The meek inherit nothing, they will not be saved

Overlords of violence, long may they reign
Triumph of the murderers, a vile new age
Force of the ruthless will dominate life
Empire of the killers, a dark endless night
