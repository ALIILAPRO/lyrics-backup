		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’m feeling water flowing
It’s dripping from the ceiling to my skin
I need something that’s healing
But you just drag me in
You’re good at stealing
What you don’t own
You pull me with your eyes under water
Under water
Don’t get to close to me
You pull me with your eyes under water
Under water
Don’t get to close to me
You pull me with your eyes under
Under water
Don’t get to close to me
Your eyes under
Under water
Don’t get to close to me
Under water
Don’t get to close to me
Your eyes under
Under water
Don’t get to close to me
I’m feeling water rising
And I just keep on breathing to move on
The only thing that’s healing is when you’re close to me
But you’re just stealing
What you don’t own
You pull me with your eyes under water
Under water
Don’t get to close to me
You pull me with your eyes under water
Under water
Don’t get to close to me
You pull me with your eyes under
Under water
Don’t get to close to me
Your eyes under
Under water
Don’t get to close to me
Under water
Don’t get to close to me
Your eyes under
Under water
Don’t get to close to me
You pull me with your eyes under water
Under water
Don’t get to close to me
You pull me with your eyes under water
Under water
Don’t get to close to me
