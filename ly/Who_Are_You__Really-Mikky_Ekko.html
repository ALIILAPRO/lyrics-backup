		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So you feel entitled to a sense of control
And make decisions that you think are your own
You are a stranger here, why have you come?
Why have you come, lift me higher, let me look at the sun
Look at the sun and once I hear them clearly, say
Who, who are you really?
And where are you going?
I have nothing left to prove
'Cause I have nothing left to lose
See me bare my teeth for you
Who, who are you?
Now you're moving on and you say you're alone
Suspicious that this string is moving your bones
We are the fire, we see how they run
See how they run, lift me higher, let me look at the sun
Look at the sun and once I hear them clearly, say
Who, who are you really?
And where are you going?
I have nothing left to prove
'Cause I have nothing left to lose
See me bare my teeth for you
See me bare my teeth
Who, who are you really?
And where are you going?
I have nothing left to prove
'Cause I have nothing left to lose
See me bare my teeth for you
Who, who are you?
