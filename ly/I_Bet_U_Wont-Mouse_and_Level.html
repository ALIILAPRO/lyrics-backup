		  Yeah, yeah
Yeah, mic check
It's Level, baby, Mouse On da Track
Yeah, ah-whoop
Yeah, ah-whoop
Yeah, ah-whoop
Yeah

I bet you won't, I bet you won't
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
I bet you won't, I bet you won't

Now will you dive when it's time to dive?
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
When you need to get your money right
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
You got a pack and you need to flip it
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
Show them bitches they ain't fuckin' with you
I bet you won't, I bet you won't

What's the deal, you know what it is, tell me how you feel
On that kill, on them yellow pills rollin' like a wheel
Off the chain, I don't play no games, bitch you know my name
Give me change, out my damn brain, nigga I'm insane
Take it easy, makin' life look easy, now I'm off the heezy
Need a breezy who gon' pop the peezy, she gon' fuck for sheezy
For no reason, she just like my steeze and now she wants the deezy
Get a room, she gon' hit the bleezy, then gone do her theezy
What it do, I'll be comin' through and my niggas too
I'm the truth, who the fuck are you? I be gettin' loose
To the roof, bitch I'm to the roof, I done threw me too
Fuck him, fuck her, fuck y'all and you
And you, you can get it too, what you tryna do?
Balenciaga, nigga that's a timer, 600 per shoes
I'ma move, nigga get the loot, let me get my funds
They got plenty, nigga they got plenty, you gon' get you some?

I bet you won't, I bet you won't
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
I bet you won't, I bet you won't

Now will you dive when it's time to dive?
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
When you need to get your money right
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
You got a pack and you need to flip it
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
Show them bitches they ain't fuckin' with you
I bet you won't, I bet you won't

So they flexin', they ain't learned their lesson, let's make this correction
Who they testin'? This is not oppression, years of built aggression
Talkin' ignant like you're really with it, bitch, come on and get it
Y'all stingy, I won't give a penny, fuck if you're offended
I'm a clown, I don't fuck around, it be goin' down
Make a sound, we can catch a round, beat you to the ground
I go hard, nigga super hard, white and brown
Mix 'em both together watch me gulp it all down
They full of lies, I would not ignore it, they won't get the glory
Pull their card, they say he's a fraud, fabricatin' stories
In the dark you play with lil' boys, that is statutory
Bitch you evil, we do not believe you, think we on that needle?
Bitch I'm throwed, you already know, I be on them hoes
Neck froze, and my wrist game got me with a cold
On the road all I do is shows, Polo on my clothes
And if you think I'm broke, you can keep your mouth closed

I bet you won't, I bet you won't
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
I bet you won't, I bet you won't

Now will you dive when it's time to dive?
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
When you need to get your money right
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
You got a pack and you need to flip it
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
Show them bitches they ain't fuckin' with you
I bet you won't, I bet you won't

I bet you won't, I bet you won't
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
I bet you won't, I bet you won't
