		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Yeah yeah, yeah

She said, "Hey, you fire, you burnin' up"
Ayy, I say, "That's no lie, lil' bitch

Now Teen X Baby got hoes, got vibes
I'm catchin' bodies like I'm purgin', yeah
Better watch your main ho, I'm gon' slide
And I'ma fuck her like a virgin, yeah (yeah)
All these bitches for the gang
These bitches ain't mine
These bitches ain't worth shit, yeah
I can't be wastin' money on these hoes
Can't be wastin' no time
All these bitches be goldеn, uh

And she know she can't fuck with me
But she keep on tryin'
'Cause I'm the chosen one

Chain, you know that I shine, yeah

That shit through the grapevines, yeah
Oh, these niggas be hatin', I hear
