		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a devil inside of me
And he's holding on
And I don't know if he's staying or for how long
Pulling on my heartstrings and kicking in my mind
And I'm sad to say he's got me thinking about the bad parts of my life

There's a devil inside of me
A monolith of doom
There's a devil inside of me
And there's one inside of you

A terrible terrorist
Tormenting me at my best
And I don't know how to stop him
Or if it's even a problem

There's a devil inside of me
A monolith of doom
There's a devil inside of me
And there's one inside of you

Tell me how do you deal
With a devil in your heart?
'Cause every time I think we're done
I find I'm right back at the start

There's a devil inside of me
And he's holding on
And I don't know if he's staying or for how long
Pulling on my heartstrings and kicking in my mind
And I'm sad to say he's got me thinking about the bad parts of my life

There's a devil inside of me
A monolith of doom
There's a devil inside of me
And there's one inside of you

A terrible terrorist
Tormenting me at my best
And I don't know how to stop him
Or if it's even a problem

Tell me how do you deal
With a devil in your heart?
'Cause every time I think we're done
I find I'm right back at the start
