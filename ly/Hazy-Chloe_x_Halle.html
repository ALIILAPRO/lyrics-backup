		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you like just what you see when I walk by
You take your time and you travel my world with that look in your eyes
Your smile is like the first rain out of the summertime
Your soul is kind 
My, my, my

You know that I love our long nights
You're starin' in my pretty brown eyes
And I can see you bein' polite
But come on baby, take a long bite, bite

You're fallin' for me, baby
I know I make you crazy
Like when the clouds are hazy
You like to smell my daisies (oh, oh)
I can see that you wanna (oh, oh)
I smell on your cologne (oh, oh)
Be tough now don't be lazy (oh, oh)
Come love me like you hate me

Love me like you 
Love me like you hate me
Love me like you 
Love me like you hate me
Touch me like you 
Touch me like you hate me
Love me like you 
Love me like you hate me

Little aggression it always sets my heart on fire
I pay attention, yeah, don't be shy, know it's in you like knives
You have permission to shake my world 'til it falls down
Then pick me back up, don't you know you're my guy?

You know that I love our long nights
You're starin' in my pretty brown eyes
And I can see you bein' polite
But come on baby, take a long bite, bite

You're fallin' for me, baby
I know I make you crazy
Like when the clouds are hazy
You like to smell my daisies (oh, oh)
I can see that you wanna (oh, oh)
I smell on your cologne (oh, oh)
Be tough now don't be lazy (oh, oh)
Come love me like you hate me

Hate me
It's okay, baby, if you love a little too hard for me
For me, kiss me a little harder, little harder now
Touch me a little harder, like woah
Kiss me a little harder, little harder now
Now

Love me like you, love me like you
Come on baby, take a long bite, bite
Hate me

Fallin' for me, baby 
(fallin' for me)
Like when the clouds are hazy 
(When they're hazy, when they're hazy, when they're hazy)
I can see that you wanna 
(I know you wanna, I know you wanna, I know you, know you wanna, wanna)
Be tough now don't be lazy (no)
Come love, love
