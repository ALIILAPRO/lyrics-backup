		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) yuh

Pull up with the pump in the trunk
I ain't poppin', baby, I just wanna stunt
No, I'm not a dubba, mama never raised a punk
I will not fuck
That bitch smell like a skunk
Hope your ho don't pass me no blunt
Hope your ho know what I been doin'
With previous bitches that wanna get fucked
Throw out the trap strap, pull up the truck
Bitch

I be everywhere a dollar be as you wanna be
Chained up like a collar
Spring yelling Frozen
Tell me what the fuck you smokin'
Tell me what the fuck you did to get here
Nothing walkin'
I'm drinking Henny with something slow
Eating pizza, play dominos
I'm a mix of Geronimo and Shaka Zulu
I'm eating everything I kill
So where's the food? Bitch nigga!

I be cruisin' bruisin' all these women
Fuck a feeling, heart cold-blooded
Know it's time to go, blow a load
You know how it go take no shit from no ho'
BangBros better ask 'bout her throat
Young nigga! Fuckboys in a fist-fight
If a nigga don't act right
Crumb niggas get played
When I don't get payed raise hell

Tanboys, Buffet Boys
Tell me, what you know about these niggas?
Groupie love, droppin' to they knees, nigga
3-0-5, 2-1-2 we them niggas
We them niggas tanboys, Buffet Boys
Tell me, what you know about these niggas?
Groupie love, droppin' to they knees, nigga
3-0-5, 2-1-2 we them niggas
We them niggas
