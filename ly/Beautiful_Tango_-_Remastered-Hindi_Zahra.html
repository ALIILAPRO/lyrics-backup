		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Beautiful Tango, take me by the hand.
Beautiful Tango, until you make me dance.
How sweet it can be, if you make me dance?
How long will it last, baby if we dance?

Come to the, come to the world.
Come to the, come to the world,
And baby let me show you things.
Cause time is running and we can lose,
baby come and dance we gonna make it through.
Cause we've got time,
Yes, we've got time.

Beautiful stranger, don't want to know your name.
Beautiful stranger, just want to take your hand.
How sweet it can be, if you make me dance?
How long will it last, baby if we dance?

Come to the place where the skin speaks,
The secret words in Spanish.
Where the night turns out the light of day,
For us to show some courage.

So don't go, if you wanna know.
Don't go, if you don't know.
Don't go, if you wanna know.
Don't go, don't go, don't go.

Beautiful stranger, take me by the hand,
Make me dance all night.
I wanna take the chance.
I love the way you move,
And the way you,
put your hands on my hips are moving while you take it slow,
Makes me feel like I'm on a river flow.
Cause we've got time,
And yes, we've got time.

Beautiful stranger, I wanna lose my mind.
Beautiful stranger, in the depth of your eyes.
Beautiful stranger, oh oh oh oh
I remember, I remember, I remember, your

Sweet music, sweet sweet music, sweet music rising
