		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everyone loves ascending fourths
And everyone loves ascending fourths
Ooh, everyone loves ascending fourths
Everyone loves ascending fourths
Everyone loves

Paintings of orthodox monks on the wall
Impotent Mark puts his pen to forehead
Waiting for proof of his unquestioned gift

Three open windows bring air to his cheeks
The rest of him smothered in three sweat drenched sheets
With commission spent and date drawing near
And no newborn zeal or written ideas

A receding hum, akin to pink noise
Escapes his cerebral hand that toys
Miserably clutching it never avails
Without resorting to kitschy entrails

To stand up tall and straight is to break one leg
Since last Third Quarter he has not got out of bed
Meanwhile, envoys follow the stars, and the arcs of the larks
Further north to collect the work promised to their employer noblemen

He tries in vain for one pure line
Under the weight of tired eyes
He slips into the warm, soft night
To drift carefree beyond imagined bright eyes

In dreams he finds a cure that for now will suffice

Everyone loves ascending fourths
Everyone loves ascending fourths
Oh oh

The paintings of orthodox monks on the wall
Watch Markus spill ink freely on his finest scores
Sixty-five repetitions of ascending fourths

At day breaks men arrive in droves, and force the door
His work unfinished, they do not accept and throw him to the floor
He comes to in chains

Brought in front of judges
For testing good faith
To try, to risk, and to fail

Unanimously condemned
His masterpiece of schmaltz
Impure, no heart, no taste

But everyone loves
Everyone loves
Everyone loves
Everyone loves ascending fourths
Everyone loves ascending fourths
Everyone loves

Everyone loves ascending fourths
Markus ascends forth in the heart of the common man
Everyone loves
Everyone loves
Everyone loves ascending fourths
Everyone loves ascending fourths
Everyone loves ascending fourths
Markus ascends forth in the heart of the common man
Everyone loves ascending fourths
Everyone loves ascending fourths
