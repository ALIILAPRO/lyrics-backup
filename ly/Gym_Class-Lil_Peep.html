		  Huh

Whip it like a Nascar, I can see the time pass
Feel like I'm in high school, fucking me in gym class
Shawty, I remember that
I know you remember that
You was fucking with me way before I even wrote raps
Now I'm seeing cash flow
I could be an asshole
Yeah, I know
But it's all good 'cause I let her spend my money though
Playboy bunny though, shawty look like a pornstar
I know she love me 'cause she fuck me in her sports car
I pull up on her, tell her that we finna go far
Drop top, smoking Thrax, looking at the stars
Getting high, taking bars 'til we on Mars
I could make the ground move like I'm Avatar
Now I'm faded on my own in my bedroom
Now I'm looking at my phone, should I text you?
I don't wanna sex you, I just wanna bless you
Baby, I'm a priest in the underworld, guess who
Lil Bo Peep with a brand new flow, too
Lookin' at my teeth like you never seen a gold tooth
Never in the streets, 'cause I never leave my home
If you wanna live a dream I ain't coming, bitch, I told you
