		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every time my tears run dry
Don't believe I'm staying for the night
I don't even really know why I'm standing in this crowd
Swinging here side to side
When what I really wanna do is cry
Then suddenly I decide
I'm leaving
Believe it

Here for the ride
Glad that I tried it
Don't matter now

I'm just tryna find my next best exit
I'm just tryna find my next best exit
I'm just tryna find my next best exit
I'm just tryna find my next best exit

As I approach the emergency exit door
Set my eyes
See the vision
Know my mission
Getting closer every little step
But now it's time to hold my breath
Mmm

Here for the ride
Glad that I tried it
Don't matter now

I'm just tryna find my next best exit
I'm just tryna find my next best exit
I'm just tryna find my next best exit
I'm just tryna find my next best exit

Get out, get out, get out
I wanna
Get out, get out, get out
I need to
Get out, get out, get out
I wanna
Get out

I'm just tryna find my next best exit
I'm just tryna find my next best exit
I'm just tryna find my next best exit
I'm just tryna find my next best exit
