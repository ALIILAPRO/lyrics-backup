		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You
I can't wait for the nights with you (with you)
I imagine the things we'll do

Ain't nothin' plain on me, nigga, four chains on me
I ain't trippin' 'bout that ho, nigga, she came on me
I got a bitch from the West, she'll suck a nigga soft
Bitch from the East, she'll fuck a nigga dawgs
Still playin' with that raw even though I got a deal
Had to get up out the city, I just got a nigga killed
Pause, I'm lyin', kinda still sippin' out the Fanta
Oxycotin and Opanas, I want four-two for each
Niggas upped Lou for free, that's my nigga, come and kick it
Mister still'll serve the city, I'm the reason it's some chicken
Why the fuck you in the kitchen tryna turn one?
Daire quit pullin' on the blender 'fore you burn somethin'
Baby, say she wanna real nigga, she don't get it
Why you ain't never up at night? I told you I been sippin'
Still go harder for my niggas, wish I can bring you back
Turntest in the city white lows, blue flags
Know I keep two flags on bang
I just dropped a Urus for the gang
Catch me in the city, young nigga, four chains
Signed to CMG, still in the dope game
I don't swipe propane, really got it out the mud
Big 4 Gang, catch me ridin' with the thugs
Yeah, I got it on my own, ain't nobody help me
Remain humble, sell crack to dope fiends
You can't "Lil' bro" me, bitch, I really got a check
4-2 in this shit, I be really on that
Put the city on my back, still remember hard times
2018 was the year my dawg died

Pull up in frog eyes, yeah, nigga we winnin'
Amiris on low, if not wheat Timbs
Me and 42 pullin' up, twin Bentleys
Peanut butter seats so my windows tinted
Know I keep two flags on bang
I just dropped a Urus for the gang
Tied from the D to LA
Always keep it a hunnid K

Number one nigga but they never gon' admit it
I was doin' two hunnid in a 'Rarri and got a ticket
Every time they see me, they say they ain't see me in a minute
Prolly fuckin' on ya bitches, prolly runnin' up some digits
Forgiato wheels both lanes
Floor mats say a nigga name
Interrogation, Feds try to put us on the board, never identified
All my niggas always gettin' dough, it's always chicken time
I got niggas in the box, gon' call me collect
I got model bitches that be tryna call me for sex
And you know what they say, "If it ain't directed, then it ain't respected"
You see 'em out in public, they gon' act like they never said it
I see by the C-side, I throw it up two times
Your nigga got a gangsta card, he bought it off Groupon
One of the young niggas that be gettin' love in the city
From the hub to the dub in the tub, fuck with me

Pull up in frog eyes, yeah, nigga we winnin'
Amiris on low, if not wheat Timbs
Me and 42 pullin' up, twin Bentleys
Peanut butter seats so my windows tinted
Know I keep two flags on bang
I just dropped a Urus for the gang
Tied from the D to LA
Always keep it a hunnid K
