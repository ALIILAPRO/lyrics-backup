		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm just a man and I am what I am
Nobody will ever change my ways
I don't need money and I don't need no lies
I only need to live for today
But I'd like to talk things over with you
I want to hear the things you say, today
Although you won't change me anyway, oh no way

I wish you'd come and see me, I'd like to hold you
I want to set my mind all free
You understand me woman, you give me time, yeah
But I don't need no sympathy
Still I wonder what it's like to be loved
Instead of hiding in myself
Nobody will change me anyway, oh no way

Nobody's gonna change my world
That's something too unreal
Nobody will change the way I feel

So listen to me now, hear what I say yeah
Please give me time and maybe love
If there's a God up there, well I hope he helps me
I need you now to set me free
'Cause it may be that it's over for me
If you don't hear the things that I say, today
Nobody will change me anyway, no no way

Nobody's gonna change my world, that's something too unreal
Nobody will change the way I feel
