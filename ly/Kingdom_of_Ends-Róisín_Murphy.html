		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (In the kingdom of ends)
This is all, nothing left
This is it, this is easier than I expected
(There's only one desire left)
This is sane, this is mad
Ain't nothing left, make me glad
(Just one more prize I've yet to get)
This has seen better days
Every old passion gone away
(You saved the best 'til last my beautiful friend)
Why'd you have to make me wait?
Already bored of my faith
(In the kingdom of ends)
At the ends, ain't no use
Can't retain, let me loose
(There's nothing left for us to gain)

Nothing left to explain

Keep going in, keep going on
Keep going down, can't turn around, no, no, no, no
Keep waking up every morning
Thinking, "what the hell am I doing?"
Keep going on, keep going onwards
Ever in, ever downwards, yeah, yeah, yeah
Keep going in, going off
Keep going down, can't turn around, no, no, no, no
Keep waking up at 6 AM
Getting up, doing it all again

Keep going in, going on
Keep going down, can't turn around, no, no, no, no
Keep waking up every morning
Thinking, "what the hell am I doing?" Yeah, yeah, yeah
Keep going on, on and onwards
Ever in, ever downwards, yeah, yeah, yeah
Keep going in, going off
Keep going down, can't turn around, no, no, no, no
Keep waking up at 6 AM
Getting up, doing it all again

(In the kingdom of ends)
At least it's easier than a comedown
(There's simply no desires left)
Yeah, I was young once, dumb and full of cum
(Then one more prize you'd left to get)
I waited so long, there's bound to be a letdown
(You saved the last 'til last my sarcastic friend)
I hope you're happy now
(In the kingdom of ends)
I've come to know the true form of my desires
(There's nothing left for us to gain)

If you can't get away, means you can't take it back
You're not under attack, I'm just feeling lonely
Guess I can't take a little more than you have got
I'm gonna need some glamour on it
Especially if you take me in the back
Need to see the signals more and more and
All the beauty in the eye
Oh, signs and signals are my-my triggers
My-my mind triggers, an o-overload
That's when we come to the end
That's when we come to the kingdom of ends
