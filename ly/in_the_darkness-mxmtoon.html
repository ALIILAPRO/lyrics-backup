		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For a long time, I would sit alone and think
That I'm better off all by myself
Even if I sink but you found me
And you helped me see the light
The dim fluorescent flicker
In a dark, defeated night

I've had my fair share of losing
And I've hung on by a thread
Within meaning and the memories
Gain friends and wrote some melodies

In the darkness i just couldn't look ahead
I was blinded by my own self doubt
And forgot what I was all about

Move forward and try to let yourself in
It's not a bad thing to be brave
March on a path that you will pavе
Oh, oh, woah, oh oh, oh, oh woo, oh, oh oh
Ooh, ooh

For a long time, I kept my heart closеd
Thought it easier to handle it
If I was on my own

But you taught me
Some things are worth the risk
Nothing comes too easily
When joy is dangerous

I've had my fair share of losing
And I'm hung on by a thread
Within meaning and the memories
Gain friends and wrote some melodies

In the darkness i just couldn't look ahead
I was blinded by my own self doubt
And forgot what I was all about

Move forward and try to let yourself in
It's not a bad thing to be brave
I'll march on a path that I will pave
Oh, oh, woah, oh oh, oh, oh woo, oh, oh oh
Ooh, ooh

I'll move forward and try to let myself in
'Cause nothing comes too easily
When joy is dangerous
