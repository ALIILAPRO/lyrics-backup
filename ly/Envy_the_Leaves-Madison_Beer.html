		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I envy the leaves
That grow from the trees
They're all so carefree
Through the seasons, unaware of the fall
If only I'd see (see)
It's quite easy to be (be)
A drop in the ocean, with no worries and no questions at all

Why don't we lie and
Act like the best is yet to come?
Why don't we try that
Just for once?

I envy the snow (snow)
How it's blissfully cold (cold)
The world around it is melting, and it still doesn't know
It could be so sweet (sweet, sweet)
If only I were naïve (naïve)
Enough to believe that I am happy, but still I'm not sold

Why don't we lie and
Act like the best is yet to come?
Why don't we try that
Just for once?

For once
For once
Why don't we try
Just for once?
Ooh
Ooh
Just for once

I envy the leaves
That grow from the trees
They're all so carefree
Through the seasons, unaware of the fall
