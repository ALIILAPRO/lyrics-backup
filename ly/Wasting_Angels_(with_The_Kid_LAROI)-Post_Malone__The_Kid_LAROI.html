		  Mm

This is like a private plane up on my ring
This is like the first time I bought a chain
This is like when I was sane before the fame
Oh, oh, this life is crazy
This is like another thing I can't explain
This is like a summer flame that got away
I won't let another angel go to waste
Oh, oh, this life is crazy

Oh, Vividus bed where I'm layin' my head (ooh)
Devil on my back, so I sleep on my chest
Waitin' at the gate, how'd they get my address?
On my last nerve while I'm rippin' cigarettes
It's a killer I know, it's a killer I know
I just need a lil' somethin' get me through the day
Yeah, my mind is blank or I overthink
It's gettin' old but it's nothin' new
I say your name when you're not around
When I'm drunk and my knees can't pick me up
Need to say your name when you're not around
When I'm drunk and my knees can't pick me up

This is like a private plane up on my ring (whoa)
This is like the first time I bought a chain (whoa)
This is like when I was sane before the fame
Oh, oh, this life is crazy (oh)
This is like another thing I can't explain (oh)
This is like a summer flame that got away
I won't let another angel go to waste
Oh, oh, this life is crazy

I blacked out, left a hundred missed calls on your phone
I mixed my drink with a couple of drugs
Spit in my face, now you hate that I'm gone, babe (gone, gone)
You're doin' the most
I don't need somebody to be the one to keep me honest
I don't wanna know the truth, I can't fight if I'm alone
I need enemies (I do)
You know how far that I will go (how far)
Every road takes its toll
Before you leave, I'm gone, I'm gone (ayy)

This is like a private plane up on my ring
This is like the first time I bought a chain
This is like when I was sane before the fame 
Oh, oh, this life is crazy
This is like another thing I can't explain
This is like a summer flame that got away
I won't let another angel go to waste
Oh, oh, this life is crazy

I should listen to you now, if I never have
I should listen to you now, if I never have
I should listen to you now, if I never have
I should listen to you now, if I never have
I should listen to you now, if I never have
I should listen to you now, if I never have
I should listen to you now

(If I never have)
(I should listen to you now, if I never have)
(I should listen to you now, if I never have)
(I should listen to you now, if I never have)
I should listen to you now, if I never have 
I should listen to you now, if I never have
I should listen to you now, if I never have
I should listen to you now, if I never have
I should listen to you now
