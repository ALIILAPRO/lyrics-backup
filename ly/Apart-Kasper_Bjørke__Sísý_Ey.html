		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything we used to be
has been taken from me
everything we used to be 
Is no longer with me
All the pain I just to feel
is no longer real
and all the anger I believe is beginning to heal

Nothings gonna trouble my heart now that we have grown apart
Nothings gonna trouble my heart now that we have grown apart
Nothings gonna trouble my heart now that we have grown apart
Nothings gonna trouble my heart now that we have grown apart

Please forgive me-eeeeeee
Please forgive me-eeeeeee

Nothings gonna worry me
I'm letting go
Nothings gonna worry me
I'm letting go

Everything we used to be
has been taken from me
everything we used to be 
Is no longer with me
All the pain I just to feel
is no longer real
and all the anger I believe is beginning to heal

Nothings gonna trouble my heart now that we have grown apart
Nothings gonna trouble my heart now that we have grown apart
Nothings gonna trouble my heart now that we have grown apart
Nothings gonna trouble my heart now that we have grown apart

Please forgive me-eeeeeee
Please forgive me-eeeeeee

Nothings gonna trouble my heart now that we have grown apart
Nothings gonna trouble my heart now that we have grown apart
Nothings gonna trouble my heart now that we have grown apart
Nothings gonna trouble my heart now that we have grown apart
