		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you following or falling out?

I could be right
I could be wrong
I couldn't care at all
Saving my life
Or wasting my time
Won't make a difference
We dig so deep we have gone through the bottom Fast asleep, we're awakening Sodom

I know
We keep on building up, building up, building up Enough isn't good enough, good enough, good enough The higher the climb, the harder the fall
But something is better than nothing at all

Down we go
The rabbit hole
On to the other side
Reach the sun
Babylon
Are you following or falling out?

I could be right
I could be wrong
I couldn't give a damn
Saving my life
Or wasting my time
Won't make a difference
We've gone so far we have passed the horizon Can't look back, we're beyond any reason

I know
We keep on buildin up, buildin up, buildin up
Enough isn't good enough, good enough, good enough The higher the climb, the harder the fall
But something is better than nothing at all

Down we go
The rabbit hole
On to the other side
Reach the sun
Babylon
Are you following or falling out? Are you following or falling out? Are you following or falling out?

We got our eyes wide shut
Tripping on imagination
Reaching out
To a bittersweet temptation
Losing touch when we're waking up again

Down we go
The rabbit hole
On to the other side
Reach the sun
Babylon
Are you following or falling out? Are you following or falling out? Are you following or falling out?
