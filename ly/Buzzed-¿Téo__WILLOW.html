		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  White clouds within my reach
I'm a little buzzed
Who got the plug?
To keep me buzzed
Flow across that chasm
Toward a faraway mountain peak

So I said please
Let me sow these seeds
The sweet release
So I said please (please)
Let me toke these trees (trees)
On Sunday's eve

I'm a little buzzed
Save me something wavy
Posted somewhere hazy
Sweet life, lo-fi
High tide, low eyes
Play your rhythms on me
I'll lay back and wait for sweet release
Who got the plug?
To keep me buzzed
Woke up on Saturn
With a cloud beneath my feet

So I said please
Let me sow these seeds
The sweet release
So I said please (please)
Let me toke these trees (trees)
On Sunday's eve
