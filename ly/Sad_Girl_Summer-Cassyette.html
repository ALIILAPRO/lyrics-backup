		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a mess I'm Depressed in my dress from the night before
I got outta my head cos you left now I'm on the floor 
Every day every night 
There’s a fight 
Kick me to the core 
I'm a mess I'm Depressed in my dress from the night before

Babe.. you could only make me happy for a minute 
Happy for a minute til I 
Break in a million pieces 
Give me one more minute
Give me one more minute cos 

You keep making me Mad 
Yeah you made me a sad girl (so don't cry baby)
And now I hate you so bad cos you make me a sad girl (so don't cry baby)
....it hurt like hell when I caught you with her last night..
So I burnt all your clothes 
smashed up your guitar I'm sore 
But I don't wanna be a sad girl anymore 


Did ya forget what you said from the night before 
How could you hit up your ex with that text 
And the dirty talk

Babe.. you could only make me happy for a minute 
Happy for a minute til I 
Break in a million pieces 
Give me one more minute
Give me one more minute cos 

You keep making me Mad 
Yeah you made me a sad girl (so don't cry baby)
And now I hate you so bad cos you make me a sad girl (so don't cry baby)
....it hurt like hell when I caught you with her last night..
So I burnt all your clothes 
smashed up your guitar I'm sore 
But I don't wanna be a sad girl anymore 

I don’t wanna be 
I don’t wanna be 
I don’t wanna be 
A sad girl anymore 

I don’t wanna be 
I don’t wanna be 
I don’t wanna be 
A sad girl anymore 

You keep making me Mad 
Yeah you made me a sad girl (so don't cry baby)
And now I hate you so bad cos you make me a sad girl (so don't cry baby)
....it hurt like hell when I caught you with her last night..
So I burnt all your clothes 
smashed up your guitar I'm sore 
But I don't wanna be a sad girl anymore
