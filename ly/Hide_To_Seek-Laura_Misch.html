		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  lay me on the ground
entangled roots
earthbound
play hide to seek
until we are found

have you walked so far
beyond whatâ€™s seen
have you woken from
the wildest dream
have you woven in
the threads that lead
to a 
summer of surrender
summer of surrender
summer of surrender

lay me on the ground
entangled roots
earthbound
play hide to seek
until we are found

spin me in the air
wind blows through my hair
summer of surrender
summer of surrender
