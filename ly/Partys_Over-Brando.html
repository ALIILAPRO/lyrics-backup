		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're soaking wet, you're in my head,
You're in my head, up in my head,

It's half past 12 noon, meet up at Nobu,
Cause I, need you again,
Some days I want you, some days I loath you,
And I, don't need a friend

Ooooh you say by the time you come,
The party's over,
Well baby tonight, I guess it's goodbye, you won,
My heart is sober,

We're soaking wet, you're in my head,
You're in my head, up in my head,
We're soaking wet, you're in my head,
You're in my head, up in my head,
We're soaking wet, you're in my head,
You're in my head, up in my head,
We're soaking wet, you're in my head,
You're in my head, up in my head,

You're on the west side, sipping that mai tai,
Then you, need me again,
Some days you want me, some days you hate me,
Still you, just need a hand,

Ooooh you say by the time you come,
The party's over,
Well baby tonight, I guess it's goodbye, you won,
My heart is sober,

We're soaking wet, you're in my head,
You're in my head, up in my head,
We're soaking wet, you're in my head,
You're in my head, up in my head,
We're soaking wet, you're in my head,
You're in my head, up in my head,
We're soaking wet, you're in my head,
You're in my head, up in my head
