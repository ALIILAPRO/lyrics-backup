		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Young Chop on the beat
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

Bitch I'm cooler than a cooler
Big shouts out to my jeweler
Hit a lick been rich ever since
Say Chief Sosa broke that's a rumor
These broke ass niggas need tune ups
I'm a rich ass nigga Hallelujah
Broke niggas we see right through ya
Bitch Chief Sosa getting that mula

Bitch I'm cooler than a cooler
Big shouts out to my jeweler
Hit a lick been rich ever since
Say Chief Sosa broke that's a rumor
These broke ass niggas need tune ups
I'm a rich ass nigga Hallelujah
Broke niggas we see right through ya (ay, ay)
Bitch Chief Sosa getting that mula 

Every time I look up my bitch starting some shit (bitch)
Damn I hate a bitch that like to argue and shit (bitch)
Got so much designer shit you'll think I model this shit (Sosa Baby)
There go the Glory Boys again they popping bottles and shit
I say if you need a feature, homeboy hit up my line
I love when me and Ben Franklin be spending some time
Walk in the mall buy all the stores, bitch get on this ride
And if your boyfriend wanna be like me, tell him get on his grind

Bitch I'm cooler than a cooler
Big shouts out to my jeweler
Hit a lick been rich ever since
Say Chief Sosa broke that's a rumor
These broke ass niggas need tune ups
I'm a rich ass nigga Hallelujah
Broke niggas we see right through ya
Bitch Chief Sosa getting that mula

Bitch I'm cooler than a cooler
Big shouts out to my jeweler
Hit a lick been rich ever since
Say Chief Sosa broke that's a rumor
These broke ass niggas need tune ups
I'm a rich ass nigga Hallelujah
Broke niggas we see right through ya (ay, ay)
Bitch Chief Sosa getting that mula 

Tadoe off the molly he retarded and shit
Take a look off in my closet lots of Robins and shit
And MJ bring the same shoes out, I'm still copping them shits
Bentley coupes and Hummer trucks and 'Raris and shit
I do this so Lolo won't have to worry again
And KayKay can be like pops and ride 'Raris and shit
There go Chief Sosa, girl he ducking paparazzi again
You looking for me I'm in the woods with Holly in shit

Bitch I'm cooler than a cooler
Big shouts out to my jeweler
Hit a lick been rich ever since
Say Chief Sosa broke that's a rumor
These broke ass niggas need tune ups
I'm a rich ass nigga Hallelujah
Broke niggas we see right through ya
Bitch Chief Sosa getting that mula

Bitch I'm cooler than a cooler
Big shouts out to my jeweler
Hit a lick been rich ever since
Say Chief Sosa broke that's a rumor
These broke ass niggas need tune ups
I'm a rich ass nigga Hallelujah
Broke niggas we see right through ya
Bitch Chief Sosa getting that mula

Bitch I'm cooler than a cooler
Big shouts out to my jeweler
Hit a lick been rich ever since
Say Chief Sosa broke that's a rumor
These broke ass niggas need tune ups
I'm a rich ass nigga Hallelujah
Broke niggas we see right through ya
Bitch Chief Sosa getting that mula
