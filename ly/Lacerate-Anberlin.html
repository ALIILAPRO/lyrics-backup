		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That's enough. 
I just exist to hear the worst 
Replace the love from what it was 
Slow fade, slow feign 
 
You keep pushing the peace 
The cadaver of truth 
Volatile as can be, fall apart beautiful 
That's enough 
I just exist to hear the worst 
That's what you want 
 
The smoke-filled lungs, the bitter taste illuminates 
My heart can't break holding your memory 
So lacerate, lacerate  
 
That's enough 
I just resist to hear it's cursed 
Retrace the past and look for love 
You're so vague, you're so vain 
 
You keep pushing at me 
Now just tell me the truth 
Innocent as can be, play the part like I should 
That's enough, I just exist to hear the words: 
You're all I want 
 
The smoke-filled lungs, the bitter taste illuminates 
My heart can't break holding your memory 
So lacerate, lacerate.  
 
Feel the cold you call the clemency 
I just want my heart to break  
Away from your memory 
So lacerate, lacerate! 
 
You keep pushing the peace 
The cadaver of truth 
Volatile as can be, fall apart beautiful 
Lacerate, lacerate 
So lacerate, lacerate 
Slow fade, slow feign 
Slow fade, so vain 
Slow fade, slow fade, so vain 
 
The smoke-filled lungs, the bitter taste illuminates 
My heart can't break holding your memory 
So lacerate, lacerate 
 
Feel the cold you call the clemency 
I just want my heart to break  
Away from your memory 
So lacerate, lacerate 
 
The smoke-filled lungs, the bitter taste 
Now that my heart can't break holding your memory 
So lacerate, lacerate
