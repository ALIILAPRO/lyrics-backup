		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Does anyone really know how to love?
Does anyone really feel what they dreamt of?

Or is it all a puzzle maze
But we never actually walk out the other side

We go round and round and round
Taking wrong times
And clinging to the edges of ourselves

What is this thing that we called love?
What is this thing that I dreamt of?
What is this thing that with such a rush?
What is this thing that we called love?

What is love?
Oh, what is love?

You think you felt it all
But then it hits
A comet from above
Crashes into your lips

And suddenly you find yourself
Thinking of things you never thought of before

And something in you changes
You can't think of anything else
Apart from the person that left a rose by your door

What is this thing that we called love?
What is this thing that I dreamt of?
What is this thing that with such a rush?
What is this thing that we called love?

What is love?
Oh, what is love?
What is love?
Oh, what is love?

What is this thing that we called love?
What is this thing that I dreamt of?
What is this thing that with such a rush?
What is this thing that we called love?

What is this thing that we called love?
What is this thing that we called love?
