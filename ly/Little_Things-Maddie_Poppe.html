		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see you in everything
From New York City to New Orleans
Deepest oceans, tallest trees
No I can't run from what I see

Ooh, ooh
Miss you like crazy
Yeah I do, ooh
Hey, hey
No, I can't get you out my brain

There's a million little things
That keep me reminding me of you
You're the air that I am breathing
You're in everything I do
And I try to concentrate
But I can't escape the truth
There's a million little things
That keep reminding me

Of you, ooh
Hey, hey

Watchin' this old TV show
Wishin' you were here to hold
Even when I fall asleep
I still see you in my dreams

Ooh, ooh
Miss you like crazy
Yeah I do, ooh
Hey, hey
No, I can't get you out my brain

There's a million little things
That keep me reminding me of you
You're the air that I am breathing
You're in everything I do
And I try to concentrate
But I can't escape the truth
There's a million little things
That keep reminding me

Of you, ooh
Hey, hey
Ooh, ooh
Hey, hey

Even when I'm here alone
And even when I'm on the road
A missing piece wherever I go

Even when I'm here alone
And even when I'm on the road
A missing piece wherever I go

There's a million little things
That keep me remindin' me of you
You're the air that I am breathing
You're in everything I do
And I try to concentrate
But I can't escape the truth
There's a million little things
That keep reminding me

There's a million little things
That keep reminding me of you
There's a million little things
That keep reminding me of you
There's a million little things
That keep reminding me of you
There's a million little things
That keep reminding me of you
