		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
You know what
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt, uh
Play on playette, play on playette
Yo, Dre, drop the verse

It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me, collab' creations
Bump like acne, no doubt
I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch
A dog couldn't catch me ass out
Tell me who can stop when Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em up open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much grounds, got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind (wow)
I think about the girl all the time (wow, wow)
East side to the west side
Pushin' phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down, so I can win

I like the way you work it
No diggity
I got to bag it up (bag it up)

I like the way you work it
No diggity (no diggity)
I got to bag it up (bag it up, girl)

I like the way you work it
No diggity
I got to bag it up (bag it up)

I like the way you work it
No diggity (no diggity)
I got to bag it up (get up)

She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound
Baby never act wild, very low key on the profile
Catchin' feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Herb's the word, spin's the verbs
Lovers, it curves, so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You've got to pay to play
Just for shorty bang-bang, to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trump tight all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride

I like the way you work it
No diggity
I got to bag it up (bag it up)

I like the way you work it
No diggity (no diggity)
I got to bag it up (oh yeah, baby)

I like the way you work it
No diggity
I got to bag it up (bag it up, babe)

I like the way you work it
No diggity (no diggity)
I got to bag it up (get up)

Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (hey yo, that girl looks good)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (play on, play on, player)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (you're my kind of girl)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (hey yo)

'Cause that's my peeps and we rolls deep
Flyin' first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me, not a motherfuckin' thing
Cartier wooded frames sported by my shorty
As for me, icy gleaming pinky diamond ring
We be's the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake ass broads
I shows and proves, no doubt, I be taking you, so
Please excuse, if I come across rude
That's just me and that's how a playettes got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital G
Ask the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking moves never been my thing
So, Teddy, pass the word to your nigga Chauncey
I'll be sending the call, let's say around three thirty
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity (no diggity, no doubt, baby)

I like the way you work it
No diggity
I got to bag it up (girl, you got it goin' on)

I like the way you work it
No diggity (no diggity)
I got to bag it up

I like the way you work it
No diggity
I got to bag it up

I like the way you work it
No diggity
I got to bag it up (get up)

Yeah, come on
Becky in full effect (no doubt)
Lisa in full effect (right)
Vicky in full effect (uh huh)
Tameka in full effect (yeah)
Blaze in full effect (right)
Ain't nothing goin' on but the rent (no doubt)
Yeah
Play on, playette (play on, playette)
Play on (play on)
Play on (play on)
'Cause I like it (right)
No diggity, no doubt, yeah
Blackstreet Productions
We out, we out (right)
We out, we out
