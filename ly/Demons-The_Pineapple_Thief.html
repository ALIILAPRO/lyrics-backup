		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was only supposed to be a short term thing
But the further we got the deeper we dug in
Now I've let it crawl deep under my skin
Yeah it was only supposed to be a short term thing

Cos I've got demons
Yeah you should know
You put them in me
And I will not let them go
Yeah I've got Demons

It was only supposed to be a short term thing
And just a matter of time before it all caved in

Cos I've got demons
Yeah you should know
You put them in me
And I will not let them go
Yeah I've got demons
Yeah you should know
You put them in me
And I will not let them go
Yeah I've got demons

Yeah I've got demons
Yeah you should know
You put them in me
I guess I knew this
All along
I hurt you

Yeah I've got demons
It was only supposed to be a short term thing
