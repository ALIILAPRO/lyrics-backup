		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hundreds of years searching for a reason
As the time passes by in a lonely cry
Signs of a child lost to rusted seasons
Can you find glowing eyes
Through the lunar lullaby's lie
Fragmented parts from relentless beatings
Decorate winter days in a godless way
For sin never stays under sacred reasons
Yet I pray for escape in a
Fantasy filled daze
And as your body hits the flame
I'll watch the motions of your twisted face
A sacrificial want, a carnal rage
Awaken everything I learned to annihilate
As your body hits the flame
You ask a silent god if it's too late
And when they find your battered body
Trust that your ashes will be
Drawn by matches and rust
Thousands of years slipping through my fingers
Imitate futile ways in a gentle blaze
Heaven exists for the lost and fearful
Can you find faithful eyes
Through the lunar lullaby's lies
Fragmented parts from relentless beatings
Recreate winter days in a soulless way
For sin never stays under sacred reasons
So, I pray for escape in a
Fantasy filled daze
And even through the night
It seems I've come to find
You'll never face the light
The generational curse of our kind
And as your body hits the flame
I'll watch the motions of your melted face
Hey, ain't it funny, you can't bear the same
Sort of agony you forced me to emulate
And as your body hits the flame
You meet the burning of a child's rage
And when they find your battered body
Trust that your ashes will be
Drawn by matches and rust
Matches and rust
Picking at flowers by the footsteps of your grave
Eating the thorns trapped in a monochromatic daze
They say it's nature
No, I can't just run away
Wait, don't go
Won't you help me dissect my brain
