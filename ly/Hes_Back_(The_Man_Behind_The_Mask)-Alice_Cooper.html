		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're with your baby
And you're parked alone
On a summer night
You're deep in love
But you're deeper in the woods
You think you're doin' alright

Did you hear that voice
Did you see that face
Or was it just a dream
This can't be real
That only happens, babe
On the movie screen

Oh, but he's back
He's the man behind the mask
And he's out of control
He's back
The man behind the mask
And he crawled out of his hole

You're swimmin' with your girl
Out on lovers' lake
And the wind blows cold
It chills your bones
But you're still on the make
That's a bad mistake

But the moon was full
And you had a chance
To be all alone
But you're not alone
This is your last dance
And your last romance

Yeah, cause he's back
He's the man behind the mask
And he's out of control
He's back
The man behind the mask
And he crawled out of his hole

Oh, if you see him comin'
Get away if you can
Just keep on runnin'
Run as fast as you can
He's a dangerous, dangerous man

And he's out tonight
And he's watchin' you
And he knows your house
No, don't turn out the lights

Yeah, cause he's back
He's the man behind the mask
And he's out of control
He's back
The man behind the mask
And he's after your soul

He's back
He's the man behind the mask
And he's out of control
He's back
The man behind the mask
And he's after your soul

He's back
He's the man behind the mask
And he's out of control
He's back
The man behind the mask
And he's after your soul
