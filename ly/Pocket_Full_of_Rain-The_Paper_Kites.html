		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There was a time
When the road seemed brighter babe
And I've been dreaming
Of a sky so blue
But every now and then
It gets a little dark
And I've been walking in the rain
With you

Maybe it ain't quiet
Maybe we're just talking about it babe
It our own way
Maybe that's true
But every day's a little further
Down that road
And I've been walking in the rain with you
I've been walking in that rain with you

'Cause when I look out in the evening
See that moon's still shining bright now
And a pocket full of rain's alright
And a pocket full of rain's alright

Sing me a song
Tell me something you believe
Tell me something you can hold on to
'Cause every day's a little further
Down that road
And I'll be walking in the rain with you
I'll be walking in that rain with you

'Cause when I look out in the morning
See that sun's still shining bright now
And a pocket full of rain's alright
And a pocket full of rain's alright

So keep the candle burning
Keep it brighter as you go now
And a pocket full of rain's alright
And a pocket full of rain's alright
