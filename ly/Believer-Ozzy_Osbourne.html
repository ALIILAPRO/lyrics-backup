		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Watching the time go and feeling belief grow
Rise above the obstacles
People beseech me but they'll never teach me
Things that I already know (I know)

Dreams that have shattered may not have mattered
Take another point of view
Doubts will arise though like chasing a rainbow
I can tell a thing or two (that's true)

You've got to believe in yourself 
or no one Will believe in you
Imagination like a bird on the wing
Flying, free for you to use (okay baby)

I can't believe they stop and stare
And point their fingers doubting me
Their disbelief suppresses them
But they're not blind it's just that they won't see

I'm a believer, I ain't no deceiver
Mountains move before my eyes
Destiny planned out I don't need no handout
Speculation of the wise
