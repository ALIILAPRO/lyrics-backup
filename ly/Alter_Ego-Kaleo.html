		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got two strong legs
Whoa, just like my father said, yeah
"On your feet, little man
Now go out and take what you can"
Oh, yeah

You've got the win in your bag
Don't you go home and cry, no
Whoa, yeah, nah
Whoa, yeah
Woo-hoo-hoo

I've got a leather room
Whoa, but babe when you touch me with it, yeah
Oh, I feel I'm 'bout to break, yeah
Oh, don't leave me this way, don't leave me
Oh, no

You feel the rush in your head
This is the time to attend
There's nothin' holdin' you back
Now, go ahead

So maybe I'm not the same, oh no
But I might just be the one
So, baby, don't hurt yourself, oh no
Said, I might just be, I might just be the one

And maybe I'm not the same, oh
But I might just be the one
So, baby, don't hurt yourself, oh no
Said, I might just be, I might just be the one

Who you with? You got fooled again
Whoa, and someone's out to get ya, yeah
Whoa, I'm comin' back around for you
Whoa, they're callin' me back so I better go, now
Whoa, yeah

You feel the rush in your head
This is the time to attack
You've got to win in your bag
Now, go ahead

Lately I'm not the same
I might just be the one
So, baby, don't hurt yourself
Said, I might, I, I might just be the one

No, lately I'm not the same, no
Ooh, I might just be the one, yeah-yeah
Oh, baby, don't hurt yourself, no
See, I might just be, come on, let's go
