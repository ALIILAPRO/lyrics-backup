		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She said she’d do it again, oh
Let’s just do it again, yeah (Right there)
Do it again (Alright, Alright)
She said she’d do it again
(yeah, right there) said she’d do it again
(Oh, like yeah, turn on the lights)
Do it again (All the time) ooh, oh

I’m spending all this time thinking bout you
And all the things these
Other bitches won’t do (Won't do)
I’m tryna fuck with you, you know I want to
(Want to)
You gave it to me once but I just want two
Yeah, do it again, baby, you
Got a nigga stuck on that pussy like glue
You don’t give a fuck who I’m giving pipe to
If you wanna fuck, baby, come in my room
Ooh, yeah baby, you could be up in a movie
Just doing what you do
In front of the jacuzzi, you blew me
I’m like ooh girl, you type cool
But baby, can you do it again?

She said shе’d do it again, oh
Let’s just do it again, yeah (Right therе)
Do it again (Alright, Alright)
She said she’d do it again
(yeah, right there) said she’d do it again
(Oh, like yeah, turn on the lights)
Do it again (All the time) ooh, oh

She said she’d do it again, oh
Let’s just do it again, yeah (Right there)
Do it again (Alright, Alright)
She said she’d do it again
(yeah, right there) said she’d do it again
(Oh, like yeah, turn on the lights)
Do it again (All the time) ooh, oh

Oh, ooh
