		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thirty years since all this happened
Thirty years it took to rise
Blood on the floor and in their eyes
They took the bite and left them to die
Thirty years and now I'm here
The only one left to scream in fear
Your job means nothing when
I've got you running
Away with blood in your tears
Take a look at me
Can you see the death in my eyes?
All the time you're waiting
I get stronger with power and force
It's not as if they're paying you much

In Five Nights at Freddy's 3
I'll hunt you down and you will see
You burn alive when you hit Night 5
That's life in Five Nights at Freddy's 3
A horror ride built just for me
Your doom is near, your time comes now
You're just too late
I'm coming for you now

All these toys yet not much time
Before I take your soul tonight
Piece by piece, I build your fears
What can we use to end this right?
All these vents and all these rooms
The camera keeps you from your doom
'Cause nothing stops me from
The past that's rotting
I'm still here, bitch! Your fight ends soon
Now I'm free to take your soul
And place it in mine
All the time you're waiting
Time grows longer and longer inside
Before you know it, your soul is mine

In Five Nights at Freddy's 3
I'll hunt you down and you will see
You burn alive when you hit Night 5
That's life in Five Nights at Freddy's 3
A horror ride built just for me
Your doom is near, your time comes now
You're just too late
I'm coming for you now

Thirty years ago, they used to be just toys
Just playmates but then it happened
The fire in their eyes became unstoppable
Indestructible
They were machines, ready for their final act
But thirty years have passed
And patrons renewed the franchise
Rebuilt the nightmare
Poor fools, what the fuck have they done?
We're coming for you

12 AM, you sit and stare
1 AM, I start the fair 2 AM, I zip and zoom
3 AM, I come for you
4 AM, shit just got real
5 AM, you know the deal
Let's hope you make the last hour count
It's time to die

In Five Nights at Freddy's 3
I'll hunt you down and you will see
You burn alive when you hit Night 5
That's life in Five Nights at Freddy's 3
A horror ride built just for me
Your doom is near, your time comes now
You're just too late
I'm coming for you now

What can we use? The power divine
Your time ends now burn alive in Night 5
What can we use? The power divine
Your time ends now
Burn alive in Night 5 Scream
