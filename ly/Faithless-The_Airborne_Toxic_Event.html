		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wake up early my head and rise
It's the fever dream of what we did last night
I flex my fingers and feel my age
Fifteen minutes till we take the stage
And I call you when I wake up drunk
My arms are cold and my head is sunk
They say the lights go up at ten PM
Just make sure you're okay by then

And the signs, oh, the signs
That carry me far from home
But you can't give away
Something you never owned
You owned, you owned

Oh, desire burns like fire
Just give me one single second to breathe
I'll turn off the lights before I leave
Our fate is faithless
It's floating weightless
Looking for lost souls like us
We never had a choice but to give up

And the secrets, they keep
Buried inside our lungs
It's no secret, believe
We were just far too young
Too young, too young

I say you can't give something to take it back
Just pull his knife out from my neck
Don't tell me that you did your best
God only knows I was a lucky guess
And now all of my friends are dropping out
It's way too quiet when your head's so loud
Not falling into empty space
Just sit and feel my heartbeat race

Oh, desire burns like fire
Just give me one single second to breathe
I'll turn off the lights before I leave
Our fate is faithless
It's floating weightless
Looking for lost souls just like us
We never had a choice but to give up
Give up, ahh

And the secret we keep
Buried inside our lungs
It's no secret, believe
We were just far too dumb
Too dumb, too dumb

Oh, desire burns like fire
Just give me one single second to breathe
I'll turn off the lights before I leave
Our fate is faithless
It's floating weightless
Looking for lost souls like us
We never had a choice but to give up
