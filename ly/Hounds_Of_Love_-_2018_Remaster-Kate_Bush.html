		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's in the trees
It's coming

When I was a child
Running in the night
Afraid of what might be 

Hiding in the dark 
Hiding in the street 
And of what was following me
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Now hounds of love are hunting
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
I've always been a coward
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
And I don't know what's good for me 

Oh, here I go
It's coming for me through the trees
Oh, help me someone 
Help me please

Take my shoes off
And throw them in the lake 
And I'll be 
Two steps on the water 

I found a fox 
Caught by dogs
He let me take him in my hands 

His little heart
It beats so fast 
And I'm ashamed of running away 

From nothing real 
I just can't deal with this 
I'm still afraid to be there 
Doo-doo-doo-doo
Among your hounds of love 
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
And feel your arms surround me 
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
I've always been a coward
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo 
I never know what's good for me 

Oh, here I go 
Don't let me go 
Hold me down 
It's coming for me through the trees 
Oh, help me darling 
Help me please 

Take my shoes off 
And throw them in the lake 
And I'll be 
Two steps on the water 

Doo-doo-doo-doo
I don't know what's good for me 
I don't know what's good for me 
I need lo-lo-lo-lo-love, yeah 
Your, yeah, your
Your love 
Doo-doo

And take your shoes off 
And throw them in the lake 

Do you know what I really need? 
Do you know what I really need? 
I need lo-lo-lo-lo-love, yeah
