		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why'd you tell me this?
Were you looking for my reaction?
What do you need to know?
Don't you know I'll always be your girl?

You don't have to prove to me
You're beautiful to strangers
I've got lovin' eyes
Of my own

(You belong to me)
Tell her, tell her you were foolin' (you belong to me)
You don't even know her (you belong to me)
Tell her that I love you (you belong to me)

You belong to me
Can it be, honey, that you're not sure?
(You belong to me)
Thought we'd close the book and lock the door

You don't have to prove to me
That you're beautiful to strangers
I've got lovin' eyes of my own, of my own
And I can tell, I can tell, darlin'

Tell her (you belong to me) tell her that I love you
(You belong to me)
You belong, you belong, you belong to me (you belong to me)
Tell her you were foolin' (you belong to me)
Tell her she don't even know you

Tell her (you belong to me)
Tell her, you were foolin' (you belong to me)
I know you from a long time ago oh, baby (you belong to me)
Don't make me go to her house (you belong to me)
You belong, you belong, you belong to me (you belong to me)

You belong to me (you belong to me)
You belong to me (you belong to me)
You belong to me (you belong to me)
You belong to me (you belong to me)
You belong to me (you belong to me)
You belong to me (you belong to me)
You belong to me (you belong to me)
You belong to me (you belong to me)
You belong to me
