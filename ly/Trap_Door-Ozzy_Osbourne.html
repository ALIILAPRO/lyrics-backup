		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you see your reflection
False strength, hollow protection
Run from pain and rejection
The truth stabs again
Till the skin is broken
And the cut is open
And the words once spoken
Just fade away

Too late, standing on the trap door
Too late, standing on the trap door
Too late, standing on the trap door
Too late, standing on the trap door

Big head leads to confusion
Strong heart pumps up delusion
Tough talk, one voice communion
Medicate the pain
Justify your ego
Living with denial
And the thoughts so vile
Won't fade away

Too late, standing on the trap door
Too late, standing on the trap door
Too late, standing on the trap door
Too late, standing on the trap door

It's coming
You're falling
You're on your own with no one left to blame

Can't sleep 'cause you've made your own bed
The sentence of the helpless
Sink deep to the trial in your head
The court of the selfish
Why? Tell me why? Can't evade or escape the reality

A true lie and a broken promise
A Judas and a doubting Thomas
A tragedy just to keep you honest
Guilty always fall

Through the trap door
Fear the trap door
Through the trap door
The trap door, the trap door

No fear, too scared to look up
Can't win, nothing but bad luck
Clock ticks, your time to face up
You can't run for long
When your world is broken
Your trap door is open
The very words you choke on
Just fade away

Too late, standing on the trap door
Too late, standing on the trap door
Too late, standing on the trap door
Too late, standing on the trap door
