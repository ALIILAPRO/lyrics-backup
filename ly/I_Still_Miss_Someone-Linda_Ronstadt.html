		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Round my door the leaves are falling
A cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone
No I never got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
I wonder if he's sorry
For leaving what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
But I still miss someone
No I never got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
