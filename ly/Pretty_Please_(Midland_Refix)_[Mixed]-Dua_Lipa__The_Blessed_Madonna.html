		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  -Lief, pretty
-Lief, pretty
(Oh, pretty, oh)
Oh, you look so pretty

Please, pretty
Put my mind at
-Lief, pretty
Put my mind at
Pretty, put my mind at
(Oh, pretty, oh)

Somewhere in the middle, I
Think I lied a little, I
I said if we took it there, I wasn't gonna change
But that went out the window, yeah

I hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
But my mind is running wild, could you help me slow it down?

Put my mind at ease
Trickle down my spine
Oh, you look so 
Pretty, please
Every single night
I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty please

Hey, what's up? It's Louie Vega 
From Masters at Work
And you're listening to Club Future Nostalgia 
With Dua Lipa and The Blessed Madonna
