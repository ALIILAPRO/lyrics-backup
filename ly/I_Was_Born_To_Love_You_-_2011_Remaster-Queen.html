		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you, ha
Every single day
Alright, hey hey

I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you
Every single day of my life

You are the one for me
I am the man for you
You we're made for me
You're my ecstasy
If I was given every opportunity
I'd kill for your love

So take a chance with me
Let me romance with you
I'm caught in a dream
And my dream's come true
So hard to believe
This is happening to me
An amazing feeling
Comin' through

I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you, honey
Every single day of my life

I wanna love you
I love every little thing about you
I wanna love you, love you, love you
Born, to love you
Born, to love you
Yes I was born to love you
Born, to love you
Born, to love you
Every single day, day of my life

An amazing feeling
Comin' through

I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yeah, I was born to take care of you
Every single day of my life
Yeah I was born to love you
Every single day of my life

Go, whoa, I love you babe, hey
Born to love you
Yes, I was born to love you hey
I wanna love you, love you, love you
I wanna love you
Yeah yeah
Ha ha ha ha ha it's magic
What ha ha ha
I get so lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, yeah
I want to love you
It's magic
Love you, love you
Yeah, give it to me
