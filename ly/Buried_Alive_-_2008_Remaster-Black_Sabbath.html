		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once upon a nightmare
Once upon a time
You're running from temptation
You got lost
And found that you don't
Belong to anybody
You're all the same
Just another number
Cross it out
Whenever you don't behave

Someone got the doctor
He knows what to do
Throw some bones and mumble
The devil's inside of you

It might be contagious
It might change the plan
Get back in your tiny boxes
Even if you can't
We say you can

Join the congregation
Everybody's got to get in line and
We never justify
The choir sings a never-ending lie

Pre-chorus:
When you thought you were free
You didn't need a reason
No reason to survive

Chorus:
As the big door closes
And you waiting for the nail
Somebody tell the world
You're buried alive

Once upon a nightmare
Once upon a time
You're running from tomorrow
You got lost
And found that another
Day has turned to ashes
Taken by the wind
Frozen seeds of sorrow
Never to begin

Join the celebration
And everybody's got to get in line and
We never justify
The choir sings a never-ending lie

Pre-chorus:
When you thought you were free
You did not need a reason
No reason to survive

Chorus:
As the big door closes
And you waiting for the mail
Somebody tell the world
You're buried alive

One more nightmare
Just one more time
Join the congregation
Everybody get in line

Celebration
The choir sings a lie
As you call
The hammer falls
And no one hears you cry
I'm buried alive
