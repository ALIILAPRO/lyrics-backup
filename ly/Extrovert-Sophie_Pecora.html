		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I forgot how to socialize
It's embarrassing and I don't know why
I could stay up all through the night
Just rethinking what I would say better next time

At some point I got insecure
I care too much about the words
That come out of my mouth
How do people do it
Theirs just keeps on moving

I wanna talk to someone without feeling anxious
Think I'm no fun with our conversations
Oh all I want right now
Is to calm right down
And not overthink my every word
Talk to someone without my heart racing
So I escape to my imagination
Oh all I want right now
Is to see myself living in another universe
I hope my alter ego is an extrovert

I think I would be happier that way
Maybe I would have more friends, go out to the parties often
I would be invited places, get along with everyone I meet
I won't feel bad Saturday night at home watching TV no
I wouldn't think I'm missing out
I'm always there right in the crowd
I'd probably drown if I was there now
I'd hate that, wanna get out
Cause is that how I should be, what I should like
These questions are swallowing me
Would I be a better version of myself?
That's what I would like to believe but
It's all a dream, I'll never be that ver-version of me
I always see when I can't fall asleep imagining me talk-talking away
Have so much to say I
I just don't
I'm good with listening in, they think I'm bored but I'm interested
Not good at showing it, this how I live
There's nothing wrong with that but

At some point I got insecure
I care too much about the words
That come out my mouth
How do people do it
Theirs just keeps on moving

I wanna talk to someone without feeling anxious
Think I'm no fun with our conversations
Oh all I want right now
Is to calm right down
And not overthink my every word
Talk to someone without my heart racing
So I escape to my imagination
Oh all I want right now
Is to see myself living in another universe
I hope my alter ego is an extrovert
I hope my alter ego is an extrovert
