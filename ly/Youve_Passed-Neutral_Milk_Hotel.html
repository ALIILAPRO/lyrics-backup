		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The lady is dying
She bends back like a wave
As her spirit is climbing 
Through the hospital wall and away

And I wanted to hold you 
As you made your escape
But now I should have told you 
When your eyes were alive and awake

Always in life we all must make this mistake
And so I go it alone 
And the pressure is great 
I hold on to my own
Oh please oh don't go away

And I wanted to know you 
Before you started to fade
But I gave everything to
A lie and a farce and a fake

Always in life we all must make this mistake
And so I go it alone 
And the pressure is great 
I hold on to my own
Oh please oh don't go away

I'd like to see you
When all of these angry days fall away
