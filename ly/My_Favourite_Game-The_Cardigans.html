		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know what you're looking for 
You haven't found it baby that's for sure 
You rip me up and spread me all around 
In the dust of the deed of time 

And this is not a case of lust you see 
It's not a matter of you versus of me 
It's fine the way you want me on your own 
But in the end it's always me alone 

And I'm losing my favourite game 
You're losing your mind again 
I'm losing my babay 
Losing my favourite game 

I only know what I've been working for 
Another you so I could love you more 
I really thought that I could take you there 
But my experiment is not getting us anywhere 

I had a vision I could turn you right 
A stupid mission and a lethal fight 
I should have seen it when my hope was new 
My heart is black and my body is blue 

And I'm losing my favourite game 
You're losing your mind again 
I'm losing my favourite game 
You're losing your mind again 

I'm losing my baby 
Losing my favourite game

I'm losing my favourite game (losing my favourite game)
You're losing your mind again (I've tried)
I've tried but you're still the same (I've tried)

I'm losing my baby
You're losing a saviour and a saint
