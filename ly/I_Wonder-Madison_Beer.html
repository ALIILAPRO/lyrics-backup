		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wonder why
All of the clouds cleared from the sky?
I wonder why
All of the tears dried from my eyes?
I woke up happy, watched the sun rise, -ise

I wonder why? I wonder why? (I wonder why? I wonder why?)

And now each breath of air is sweeter
Birds are singing, grass is greener
Suddenly, the world is bright again (the world is bright again and)
I used to live to die by somebody else's side
But now a new day breaks and I feel fine (I feel just fine)
I wonder why?

I wonder how
I felt so cold, it's summer now
I wonder how (I wonder how)
I ever learned to live in doubt
It's time the walls came tumbling down, -own

I wonder how? I wonder how? (I wonder how? I wonder?)

And now each breath of air is sweeter
Birds are singing, grass is greener
Suddenly, the world is bright again (the world is bright again and)
I used to live to die by somebody else's side
But now a new day breaks and I feel fine (I feel just fine)
I wonder why?

(Wonder why?) Each breath of air is sweeter
(I wonder why?) Birds singing, grass is greener
Why? Why?
