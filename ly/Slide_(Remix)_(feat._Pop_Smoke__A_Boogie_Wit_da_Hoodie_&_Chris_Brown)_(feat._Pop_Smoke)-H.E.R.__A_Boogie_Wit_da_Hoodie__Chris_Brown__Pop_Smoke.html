		  Baby, when we go and slide?
When we go and slide? (It's Pop Smoke)

51, 67, Patek Philippe on the wrist (uh)
Why we in the bed? We coulda did it in the whip
Baby, I'm just tryna fuck (fuck), not make love (love)
If you tryna have some kids, that's a dub
Said, I'm 'bout to put this condom on right now (now)
From the look up in your eyes (from the look up in your eyes)
You already told me once (you already told me)
So you don't gotta tell me twice, yeah
Baby, jump up on this bike, look forward and peddle
Let me rock your world, you never had this hard metal
Baby, I'm gangsta, gentleman in disguise
Just came home, after doin some time
Let me move your knee, now just read between the lines
Just read between the lines, yeah
It's six in the morning and I'm tryna get you, baby

All he wanna do is gas me
How we end up in the backseat?
Just tryna get to the bag
We on the same page, you the same way
Only keep the fam around me
So let me know what it's gon be
I don't plan on gettin no sleep, while we

Doin our thing, movin too fast
Candy paint with the windows all black
Seats crème brûlée, what they gon say?
With the top down screamin, "Money ain't a thing"
And we up 'til six in the mornin
When the sun rise, we be on it
Ooh, I got five, you know it's all live
Tell me when to go, baby, when we gon slide?
Baby, when we gon slide? Hey, uh
Up all night, baby, when we gon slide? Yeah
Up all night, baby, when we gon slide? Ohh
Up all night, baby, when we gon slide?

Look, you're just my type
Baby, when we gon slide?
I'll put you in a G-Wagon if that's your vibe
And I ain't even gon lie
Don't you ever play around
Even when you're mad, you're mine
Baby, don't you ever switch sides
You know I can see it in your eyes
Yeah, we on the same page, we on the same wave
Drinkin champagne on an airplane
Buss down on your pinky to your earrings
I know they call me Boogeyman, but it ain't scary
All this money on me, it's a damn shame
And I don't want you to ever feel embarrassed
So I bought you some baguettes, I bought you some karats
Yeah, but I think I was over my head, movin too fast

Do-do-doin our thing, movin too fast
Candy paint with the windows all black
Seats crème brûlée, what they gon say?
With the top down screamin, "Money ain't a thing"
And we up 'til six in the mornin
When the sun rise, we be on it
Ooh, I got five, you know it's all live
Tell me when to go, baby, when we gon slide?
Baby, when we gon slide? Hey, uh
Up all night, baby, when we gon slide? Yeah
Up all night, baby, when we gon slide? Ohh
Up all night, baby, when we gon slide? Uh

You gon keep on givin it up, it ain't no stoppin you
You a queen, liftin you up, I had to drop a few
Bad bitches, cut 'em loose, they tryna take that spot from you
Told her, "I'm tryna cuff," she said, "I don't see no cop in you"
Diamonds big as a fist, VVS on her wrist (wrist)
Every day a vacation, don't get no hotter than this
Relax, baby, lay your back, askin you to sit right down
Butt naked on the table, you the shit right now
Fake love don't exist
When it come to me and who I'm really fuckin with
Haters always on my dick, but not the one suckin it
Always lookin at my pic, callin me by my government
What's the plan? What's your goal? What you really lookin for?
I got Benz, I got Ghost, I'm the man, I'm the G.O.a.t
Makin angels in the snow, don't keep playin with your nose
Take a stroll down the coast, South of France
We in Cannes, let me drive the boat

Do-do-doin our thing, movin too fast
Candy paint with the windows all black
Seats crème brûlée, what they gon say?
With the top down screamin, "Money ain't a thing"
And we up 'til six in the mornin
When the sun rise, we be on it
Ooh, I got five, you know it's all live
Tell me when to go, baby, when we gon slide?
Baby, when we gon slide? Hey, hey
Up all night, baby, when we gon slide? Yeah
Up all night, baby, when we gon slide? Ohh
Up all night, baby, when we gon slide? Uh
