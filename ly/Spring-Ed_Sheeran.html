		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where is my mind? I've lost the nerve
This year flew by without a word
I had a plan to cross the world
But haven't left this island
The stores closed down then opened up
I said I'd do a sober month
I failed, but tried, and wrote this drunk
In overwhelming silence

And I'll see my friends when all this ends
But now until then

I'm holdin' out for spring
We can't let winter win
That's why I'm holdin' out for spring
Oh, what a state we're in
I'll keep holdin' out for spring

Homework and canceled holidays
The blame gets passed to save a face
The smell of last night's takeaway
Just tells me I'm a mess
Still watching shows they recommend
That don't get good until the end
I could be unwell, but then again
Maybe I'm just depressed

And I'll fix my head when all this ends
But now until then

I'm holdin' out for spring
We can't let winter win
That's why I'm holdin' out for spring
Oh, what a state we're in
I'll keep holdin' out for 

Springtime, blue skies
Frost fades slowly
Crossed my mind to linger

And hold out for spring
We can't let winter win
That's why I'm holdin' out for spring
Oh, what a state we're in
