		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  These days I've made peace with
They're finally going down easier
I'm not quite as tempted to call
Anymore
It's been months since the reset
I've picked up all of the pieces
But one thing keeps making them fall
To the floor

And on my way home
I feel fine, feel fine
But once I'm alone
I hear your voice in the quiet
I miss you

What is it about the night
That wakes up your face in my mind
And tortures me 'til the sun rises
But leaves me alive to find
The things that I dreamed of were gone with goodbye
Oh Why
I want to move on and I'm trying
I would if I wasn't reminded
As soon as the light, it hides
What is it about
What is it about the night

Right at dusk I feel it creeping in
As if I need another reason
To remind your soul has the depth of the sea
And your touch feels like home
Why the hell did you leave again
Do you wonder how I've even been
Do you crumble in the resonance
I pray for the morning to come back to me
Anything to hold
Since you're not holding onto me

On my way home
I feel fine, feel fine
But once I'm alone
I hear your voice in the quiet

What is it about the night
That wakes up your face in my mind
And tortures me 'til the sun rises
But leaves me alive to find
The things that I dreamed of were gone with goodbye
Oh Why
I want to move on and I'm trying
I would if I wasn't reminded
As soon as the light, it hides
What is it about
What is it about the night
