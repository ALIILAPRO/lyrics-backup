		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is this a gesture of love
Or just a blade in your palm
I'll never know until the end of it all
But I'll roll the dice once again
Would you push me away again?
Would you pull me back in again?

I'll see you when the night comes
I'll see you when the night comes
I'll see you when the night comes
Until we crash into the morning
I'll see you when the night comes
I'll see you when the night comes
I'll see you when the night comes
Let this night never end

I can't explain what burns hot in my head
But I keep coming back to you
I can't leave you when you are rotting awayÂ 
Your roots are planted in my skin

When the sky cracks tonight
You'll be right by my side
Screaming into a void
It makes me churn with bliss

cnd I can't seem to find
Why you came to my life
Fucking up everything I've done
Hoping I'll see you again

I'll see you when the night comes
I'll see you when the night comes
I'll see you when the night comes
Until we crash into the morning
I'll see you when the night comes
I'll see you when the night comes
I'll see you when the night comes
Let this night never end

(I'll see you when the night comes) 
When the sky cracks tonight
(I'll see you when the night comes)
You'll be right by my side
(I'll see you when the night comes)
Screaming into a void
(Until we crash into the morning)
It makes me churn with bliss
(I'll see you when the night comes)
cnd I can't seem to find
(I'll see you when the night comes)
Why you came to my life
(I'll see you when the night comes)
Why you came to my life
Let this night never end
