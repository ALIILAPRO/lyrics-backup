		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did you believe in us?
Did you believe you believe in trust?
Cause I've been thinking it over
And you're aware that I want you

When were alone in the dark
And I could take you right now
You're the way that I want you
Moving for me

Did you believe in us?
Did you believe you believe in trust?
Cause I've been thinking it over
And you're aware that I want you

When were alone in the dark
And I could take you right now
You're the way that I want you
Moving for me

You say believe in
Trust in us
You say believe in
Remember us

Did I push it too much?
Does it feel like were rushing?
Cause we've been getting closer
And I'm aware that you want me
Don't want to give this up
You know that this could be something
We could dance in the echoes, echoes

You say believe in
Trust in us
You say believe in
Remember us

You say believe in
Trust in us
You say believe in
Remember us
