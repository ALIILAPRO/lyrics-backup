		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't regret
Your past embraces
Time will forget
Phrases and faces

No more saying words
No more crying tears
All that was before
Is no longer here
No more singing songs
Silent lips are dry
All that was before
Slowly passing by

No more saying words
No more crying tears
All that was before
Is no longer here
No more singing songs
Just for you and I
Silent nights are long
Broken hearts are dry

No turning back
No cancellation
Cat's in the bag
Train's at the station

No more saying words
No more crying tears
All that was before
Is no longer here
No more singing songs
Silent lips are dry
All that was before
Slowly passing by

No more saying words
No more crying tears
All that was before
Is no longer here
No more singing songs
Just for you and I
Silent nights are long
Broken hearts are dry
