Aw yes Luv Is Rage, Aw Yeah Luv Is Rage

Aw yeah Luv Is Rage

Sorry baby girl I gotta go right now
Even though I want you I can't take you home right now
I'mma let you take this number to my phone right now
You gon' fuck me just to get up in my zone right now

Sorry baby girl I gotta go right now
Even though I want you I can't take you home right now
I'mma let you take this number to my phone right now
You gon' fuck me just to get up in my zone right now

First off I jus be high I be smoking the dope
Got a little bitch that be sniffing the coke
Living my life like I cannot go broke
I say living my life I cannot go broke
Don't jump in the rari, I jump in the ghost
Ain't fucking your sister I ain't fucking your hoes
I went to jeweler bring my momma a rose
I'm stacking my mula I'm gettin this do'
Remember I rocked that Givenchy sweater, on the front of that bitch it had a cujo
I'm stacking my money I'm counting blue notes
You look in my pockets fat just like glucose
If you wanna rumble I jab at yo' nose
If she wanna tumble get passed to my bros
Rock Mr. Completey and 424 clothes
Me and my brothers got 4 super hoes

Sorry baby girl I gotta go right now
Even though I want you I can't take you home right now
Imma let you take the number to my phone right now
You gon' force me just to get up in my zone right now
X2

Yeah, I just be high off the xans (zans)
Super geeked up off the xans (zans)
School bus thats right in my hand
School bus thats right in my hand
I rock hard like I'm in a band
Your little bitch she is a fan
Lil nigga getting big money, yeah
Go to the beach get a tan
Jump in the crowd with my fans yeah
Jump in the crowd with my fans yeah
Water water on my wrist yeah
Water water on my hand yeah
Three wheels like a Can-Am
Throwing stacks like a band man
Break your arm like I'm Van Dam
Count it up I'm the band man
Baby girl take my number
Baby girl better call
Getting money everyday
Everyday Imma ball
Baby girl do not stall
Grab the handle flip the doors
Either you gon' drop yo draws
Or I'mma kick it with my dogs

Sorry baby girl I gotta go right now
Even though I want you I can't take you home right now
I'mma let you take the number to my phone right now
You gon' force me just to get up in my zone right now
