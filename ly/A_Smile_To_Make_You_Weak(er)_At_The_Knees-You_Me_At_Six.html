		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know, I know that I'm making it up as I go along
I thought it was just me but then I found out it's not
The kiss of death of common sense, oh, what a relief
When all you need is a smile to make them weaker at the knees
It hurts my head to care

I got friends on the internet
They surf their fears but never get wet
They wanna make it ,whatever it means
But it ain't easy, it ain't easy

You're born under a bad sign but I think you're doing fine
Don't call around, don't call around giving the experts the time
Do you really care, do you really care if they wanna stay?
So at your all, all day long, you'll be the one they don't want
It hurts my head to care, so I'm gonna stop

I got friends on the internet
They surf their fears but never get wet
They wanna make it, whatever it means
But it ain't easy, it ain't easy

Wish I could fill the hole in your heart
Should be proud to wear those scars
And maybe one day, you'll drop your guard
And if it ain't easy, it ain't easy

You make it look easy, easy, don't you?
You make it look easy, easy, don't you?
You make it look easy, easy, don't you?
You make it look easy, easy, oh

I got friends on the internet
They surf their fears but never get wet
They wanna make it, whatever it means
But it ain't easy, it ain't easy

Wish I could fill the hole in your heart
Should be proud to wear those scars
And maybe one day, you'll drop your guard
And if it ain't easy, it ain't easy
