		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I used to say I was free
Now all these people wanna keep on taking pieces of me
They take away everything, had everything that I needed
They held me down, let me drown
They spit me out right through the teeth
I can't pretend, ash in the wind, won't blow again
It was a breeze for you
These hurricanes inside of my brain, let it rain
Made it look easy
Can't look away, you love the pain, you love the pain

Watchin' me bleed
You cut me down on my knees
No matter what you believe
I think we both can agree

That you can't blame it on me, yeah
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
Blame it on me
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
I couldn't breathe
Almost lost myself, couldn't stop myself, I did it all
You can't blame it on me
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault

Everyday's the same, yeah, I just watch 'em go
As I scrape away through the impossible
Yeah, I played the game but it was all for show
Tryna find my way, I nearly lost it though
Now I see dead people, most have no faith
Where did the time go? A watch with no face
They hit the ceiling but my roof likes space
I took my chances so won't you

Blame it on me
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
Blame it on me, ayy
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
I couldn't breathe
Almost lost myself, couldn't stop myself, I did it all
You can't blame it on me
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault, not my fault

It's all my fault that I'm addicted to the clothes
It's all my fault, I paid the cost, yeah
It's all my fault that I ain't givin' up my soul
It's all my fault

Watchin' me bleed
You cut me down on my knees
No matter what you believe
I think we both can agree

That you can't blame it on me
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
Blame it on me
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
I couldn't breathe
Almost lost myself, couldn't stop myself I did it all
You can't blame it on me, ayy
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault

It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
Blame it on me, yeah
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
