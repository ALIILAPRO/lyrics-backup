		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Omo'ba no dey stress
I just wanna do my best
I no get time to impress
If you wan fight o stay blessed, oh-oh, oh-oh
Focused on my race
Make nobody question my pace
I wanna be in my space
Make nobody give me migraine, oh-oh, oh oh

Carrying everybody ills
This the kind of weight that break and give your body chills
I'm afraid of the feelings I'll reveal
I know everybody need me, but everybody chill
Emergency on planet earth I'll tell you how it feel
When your family displaced and your countrymen are killed
Bombs on Ramadan I swear my mama crying still
Used to stress about a bill now I stress about my

Trying to get 'em out the field
Where the bullets flying indiscriminate
And the world turn a blind eye inconsiderate
Cuzzo said he gotta ride
It costs five hunnid plus a lil' something on the side
If you wanna make the cutoff gotta grease the middle man
Five days trekking through the desert cuzzo swore his misery
Auntie made it three days for she passed he spoke it through his tears to me
He's crossing into Egypt now but it don't get no easier

Why nobody care why they don't put us on the media?
And I don't got the answers feel like Sway today
I see Ukraine
I see two things that ain't the same
And yet they are
You change a name, change a face, I still feel the pain
Why I'm getting punished for my melanin retainment?
Apologize for what?
I got the right to be upset
I think the world should be ashamed
I hope the world will make a change
I hope it starts soon
This one's for Khartoum

Omo'ba no dey stress
I just wanna do my best
I no get time to impress
If you wan fight o stay blessed, oh-oh, oh-oh
Focused on my race
Make nobody question my pace
I wanna be in my space
Make nobody give me migraine, oh-oh, oh oh

Thousands killed
Over five million displaced
And many more trapped in Khartoum
And cities across Sudan with little access to basic necessities
This war is a battle for power
The country's army said it would only last a few days
But it's now been raging for months
