		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been trying to figure out
Where you from? What are you talking about?
Is it the moon? Is it Earth?
Is it a place where nothing is worth?

A million dollars
A thousand colors
A billion faces
A hundred death cases
Is it there? Or is it here?
Where you hiding? I just want you to come in
Where you hiding? I just want you to come in

Nothing can compare to the life we had
My dear just grab my hand and let me take you
To my wonderland

A million dollars
A thousand colors
A billion faces
A hundred death cases
Is it there? Or is it here?
Where you hiding? I just want you to come in
Where you hiding? I just want you to come in

Where are you?
Giving all I can to find you
Where are you?
Giving all I can to find you

Where are you?
Giving all I can to find you
Where are you?
Giving all I can to find you
