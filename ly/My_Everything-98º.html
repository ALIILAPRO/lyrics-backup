		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The loneliness of nights so long
The search for strength to carry on
My every hope had seemed to die
My eyes had no more tears to cry
Then like the sun shined from up above
You surrounded me with your endless love
And all the things I couldn't see
Are now so clear to me 

You are my everything
Nothing your love won't bring
My life is yours alone
The only love I've ever known
Your spirit pulls me through
When nothing else will do
Every night I pray on bended knee
That you will always be
My everything 

Now all my hopes and all my dreams
Are suddenly reality (sudden reality)
You've opened up my heart to feel (to feel)
The kind of love that's truly real
A guiding light that'll never fade (never fade)
There's not a thing in life that I would ever trade (for the love)
For the love you give and won't let go (won't let go)
I hope you'll always know 

You are my everything
Nothing your love won't bring
My life is yours alone
The only love I've ever known
Your spirit pulls me through
When nothing else will do
Every night I pray on bended knee
That you will always be
My everything

Oh, you're the breath of life in me
The only one that sets me free
But you have made my soul complete
For all time
For all time

You are my everything (you are my everything)
Nothing your love won't bring (my everything, woo)
My life is yours alone (alone)
The only love I've ever known (oh no, oh no, no)
Your spirit pulls me through (your spirit pulls me through)
When nothing else will do (when nothing else will do)
Every night I pray on bended knee (oh I pray, on my knees)
That you will always be
My everything (be my everything)

You are my everything
Nothing your love won't bring (yeah)
My life is yours alone (alone)
The only love I've ever known (don't you know?)
Your spirit pulls me through (your spirit pulls me through)
When nothing else will do (when nothing else will do)
Every night I pray down on bended knee
That you will always be
My everything 
Oh, my everything
