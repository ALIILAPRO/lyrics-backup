		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is there a part I haven't found
Under these rocks we've lifted
Has weight been stripped
A part I need to touch
Under the sheets so thin
Like eyelid skin oh she's
Running around upstairs
So be careful
Dancing around upstairs
So be careful
You'll hear him now, he left before the day had woke
You'll hear him now, he left before the sun had spoke
Had woke
Had spoke
Is there a prize you haven't won
Under this gold you're craving
Misbehaving
A map I need to write
Under this skin so thick like
Rock or brick and now
I'm running around upstairs
So be careful
Dancing around upstairs so be careful
You'll hear him now, he left before the day had woke
You'll hear him now, he left before sun had spoke
Had woke
Had spoke
