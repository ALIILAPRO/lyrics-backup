		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Salute, yeah, general, stand firm
Solid, never budge never run T dot O dot K
That's right, whoa whoa
Solid as a rock, memba dat, yeah, yeah

Many rise, many drop, but we solid as a rock
Dem did tink we would a drop, but we solid as a rock
Keep we eyes, to di top, and we solid as a rock
Lookin' forward, neva back, 'cause we solid as a rock

When we stand, firm, and we neva run, from
Bwoy we a live up, 'cause, dem a neva bad man
Anywhere di crew, go, dat a where di crew, stand
We don't give a fuck, where, ever dem come from
Man a badman

Seven rise, seven drop, but we solid as a rock
Dem did tink we would a drop, but we solid as a rock
Many try to test our block, but we solid as a rock
Lookin' forward, neva back, 'cause we solid as a rock

Tell dem we walk wid God, first, everything come af-ta
Jah inna we heart, so, we we neva faul-ta
But if di Psalm nuh stop, dem, Desert Eagle an-sa
Diss some bwoy weh blood, thirst, drop dem line a can-ca
So we go so then

Many rise, many drop, but we solid as a rock
Dem did tink we would a drop, but we solid as a rock
Keep we eyes, to di top, and we solid as a rock
Lookin' forward, neva back, 'cause we solid as a rock

When my enemies surround me, I fear not
'Cause I'm solid as a rock
When my enemies surround me, I fear not
'Cause I'm solid as a rock

Many rise, many drop, but we solid as a rock
Dem did tink we would a drop, but we solid as a rock
Keep we eyes, to di top, and we solid as a rock
Lookin' forward, neva back, 'cause we solid as a rock

When we stand, firm, and we neva run, from
Bwoy we a live up, 'cause, dem a neva bad man
Anywhere di crew, go, dat a where di crew, stand
We don't give a fuck, where, ever dem come from
Man a badman

Tell dem we walk wid God, first, everything come af-ta
Jah inna we heart, so, we we neva faul-ta
But if di Psalm nuh stop, dem, Desert Eagle an-sa
Diss some bwoy weh blood, thirst, drop dem line a can-ca
So we go so then

Many rise, many drop, but we solid as a rock
Dem did tink we would a drop, but we solid as a rock
Keep we eyes, to di top, and we solid as a rock
Lookin' forward, neva back, 'cause we solid as a rock

Many rise, many drop, but we solid as a rock
Dem did tink we would a drop, but we solid as a rock
Many try to test our block and we solid as a rock
Lookin' forward, neva back, 'cause we solid as a rock
