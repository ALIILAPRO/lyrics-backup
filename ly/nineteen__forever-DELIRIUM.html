		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got some friends that I'd like to see
So tell me now why I should not leave
I'm sick and tired of this same disease
And every night I dream of sleep, to be asleep

It's been some while, we don't speak
Memories fade, they hide from me
Sometimes it hurts me that I can't believe
In somewhere better where you might be
Where you might be

The days get numb oh they get so cold
And nineteen years starts to feel too long
I ink my skin for one more soul
Friendly dark, a whole new hole, a whole new low

I said I'd try and I tried my best
But I can't fix what I've been left
I like myself as good as dead
I like myself as good as dead
But not quite yet

Not quite yet
Not quiet yet
Not quiet yet
Not quiet yet
