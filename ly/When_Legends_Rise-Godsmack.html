		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Legs are tied, these hands are broken
Alone I try with words unspoken
Silent cry, my breath is frozen
With blinded eyes, I fear myself

It's burning down, it's burning high
When ashes fall the legends rise
We burned it out oh my oh why
When ashes fall the legends rise

Throat is dry, my vision's fading
I'm paralyzed and left here waiting
Taking time just one step forward
Won't lose my mind, I'm here to stay

It's burning down, it's burning high
When ashes fall the legends rise
We burned it out oh my oh why
When ashes fall the legends rise

Whoa (legends rise)
Whoa (legends rise)
(Legends rise)

(You gonna do something about it, or just stand there and bleed?)

(Legends rise)

It's burning down, it's burning high
When ashes fall the legends rise
We burned it out oh my oh why
When ashes fall the legends rise

Whoa (legends rise)
Whoa (legends rise)
