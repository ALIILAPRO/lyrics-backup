(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Shawty, I love you, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Shawty, I love you, yeah

I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Ooh, you know you got it
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Ooh, you know you nasty
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Ooh, she call me daddy
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Ooh, she knows she got it

Shawty squeeze in them jeans
Touch her knees, make her scream
I sip lean, I sip lean
Gucci sneaks, shopping sprees
Shawty, she my cup of tea
Please, don't give up on me
Lord, got me shopping rings, so cold
And I think you know
What you doing to my mind and my soul
I popped a lot of pills, I freak you like I will
She ain't let me miss no meal
My feelings in it for real
For real, for real, for real, for real
For real, for real, for real, oh yeah
Girl, I'm so for real, the first time was a hell of a night
I'ma spoil you for whatever, have whatever you like
I say I won't fall in love, but I was never so right
I said you fall in love with goofys, I was never yo' type
I told my mom, you would make a hell of a wife
I know they mad we live a hell of a life
Trust issues, so confused
It's me and you, fuck the rules
I wanna suck your toes, baby, take off your shoes (yeah)
They say I'm nasty 'cause I wanna lick your ass
This yo' last chance, hit that handstand, make that ass dance
Who yo man is? Off that Xanax, have some dry sex, yeah
Durkio!
All in your hoe
Durkio!
All in your hoe

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Shawty, I love you, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Shawty, I love you, yeah
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Ooh, you know you got it
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Ooh, you know you nasty
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Ooh, she call me daddy
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Ooh, she knows she got it

Nobody understands why we love each other the way we do
But it ain't for them to understand
We not out here tryna be relationship goals
This real, we don't care about none of that internet stuff
We don't care about none of that shade
People seem to always shade what they wish they had
We make each other happy
We keeping around whatever makes us happy
And why it makes us happy is our business

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Shawty, I love you, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Shawty, I love you, yeah
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Ooh, you know you got it
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Ooh, you know you nasty
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Ooh, she call me daddy
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Ooh, she knows she got it
