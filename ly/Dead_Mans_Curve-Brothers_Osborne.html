		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Granddaddy called her princess
County fair called her queen
High school called her cum laude
Most likely to succeed
Her daddy's back wood crazy
She's got two six-foot-four brothers
You take one step onto that front porch
And you one crazy motherfucker

Her chase'll leave you breathless
Every back road in this town
She'll love you like a Sunday drive
And she'll take your poor heart down

Dead man's curve, dead man's curve
No redemption, no return
Good God almighty, gonna crash and burn down dead man's curve
Dead man's curve, dead man's curve
Country boys ain't never gonna learn
Nobody ever makes it through that turn
Dead man's curve, dead man's curve
Whoa

Every man's been tempted
Greater men have tried
At best you'll wind up dented
If you're lucky enough to survive

Now, she's the finger that you're wrapped around
She's what every country song's about
She's the trouble that you're looking for
She gonna take you down and leave you coming back for more

Dead man's curve, dead man's curve
No redemption, no return
Good God almighty, gonna crash and burn down dead man's curve
Dead man's curve, dead man's curve
Country boys ain't never gonna learn
Nobody ever makes it through that turn
Dead man's curve (dead man's curve)

What you doing wilding up here?
You a dead man

Yeah (yeah)

Dead man's curve, dead man's curve
No redemption, no return
Nobody ever makes it through that turn
Dead man's curve
Dead man's curve, dead man's curve
Country boys ain't never gonna learn
Nobody ever makes it through that turn
Dead man's curve (dead man's curve)

Dead man's curve
Oh
You're coming in way too hot
You done hit the wrong turn, boy
You're a dead man
