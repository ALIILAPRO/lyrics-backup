		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thought I told you that I did
That's why I told you that I did, hey
Thought I told you that I did
Hey, yeah

Saw you then I told you that I got you whenever
Gotta watch you when you movin', 'cause you think you so clever
Swear you treated me so cold, just like the snow in december
Don't know if we could last together, forever
Gave you time and then you told me that you want me to go
Could I make it up to you? 
Guess I'll never know
I think I'm losin' all my friends and I'm attractin' these hoes
Thought they were my friends but they foe, for sure

Hey, fantasy
Livin' off the grid, that's my fantasy (that's my fantasy)
I don't know these niggas why they trying me? (Trying me)
Hear you set me up, bitch why'd you lie to me? (Lie to me)
I should know these bitches ain't be likin' me (likin' me)
They be likin' all the diamonds that I go on me (got on me)
Show my money, now she wanna die with me (die with me)
Wanna die with me but she never ride for me (ride for me)
That's just how it be (that's just how it be)
Take it back
Back to the days as a kid
Take it back
Back when I never had shit
Take it back
Back when I made my first rack
Take it back, back when I never had tax
Take it back
I left all my past and it's scattered on the floor
I can see you scared as you steppin' by this door
Welcome to my world, so be ready for the cold
Hey, it was summer dance soul

Saw you then I told you that I got you whenever
Gotta watch you when you movin', 'cause you think you so clever
Swear you treated me so cold, just like the snow in December
Don't know if we could last together, forever
Gave you time and then you told me that you want me to go
Could I make it up to you? Guess I'll never know
I think I'm losin' all my friends and I'm attractin' these hoes
Thought they were my friends but they foe, for sure
Hey
