		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take a trip down Candy Cane Lane with me
It's the cutest thing I swear you'll ever see, it's the best
So get dressed, I'll impressed
You with the colors of the rainbow

Take a trip down Candy Cane Lane with me
It's so magical, let's go there in your dreams, it's the best
So get dressed, I'll impress
You with the lights in all the windows

Red and yellow and pink and green
Orange and purple and blue
Christmas is waiting for you, Christmas is waiting for you
Red and yellow and pink and green
Orange and purple and blue
Christmas is waiting for you, Christmas is waiting for you

Candy Cane Lane, bring a friend this holiday
Bring a friend who loves to play, we'll eat all the candy canes
Oh, Candy Cane Lane, bring a friend this holiday
Bring a friend who loves to play, we'll eat all the candy canes
Oh, candy canes, we'll eat candy canes

Take a trip down Candy Cane Lane with me
I'll call Rudolph down to meet us in the street
We can dance, he can prance
There's no can'ts 'cause here everything is possible

Take a trip down the Candy Cane Lane with me
Let's get Santa out and get him on his feet
We can dance, holding hands
Ain't no can'ts, 'cause here everything is possible

Red and yellow and pink and green
Orange and purple and blue
Christmas is waiting for you, Christmas is waiting for you
Red and yellow and pink and green
Orange and purple and blue
Christmas is waiting for you, Christmas is waiting for you

Candy Cane Lane, bring a friend this holiday
Bring a friend who loves to play, we'll eat all the candy canes
Oh, Candy Cane Lane, bring a friend this holiday
Bring a friend who loves to play, we'll eat all the candy canes
Oh, candy canes, we'll eat candy canes
