		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What did I say? What do you want?
I swear I'll make it up
Oh my gosh, what have I done?
Mm, pain in my chest, can't get to sleep
In these cold and empty sheets
Where did you go? Why did you leave?

Lie to me
It would help
Just lie to me
Say you found someone else
Lie to me
It would help
Just lie to me
Say you found someone else

So I don't blame myself
Ooh, ooh, ooh
So I don't blame myself
Ooh, ooh, ooh
So I don't blame myself

So I don't blame myself
So I don't blame myself

Movin' too fast, callin' it love
Was I just not enough?
Nothing make sense, it don't add up
Slammin' the door, not sayin' a word
It just keeps getting worse
I'm not okay, honest it hurts

Lie to me
It would help
Just lie to me
Say you found someone else
Lie to me
It would help
Just lie to me
Say you found someone else

So I don't blame myself
Ooh, ooh, ooh (ooh)
So I don't blame myself
Ooh, ooh, ooh (ooh)
So I don't blame myself

Oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh
So I don't blame myself
So I don't blame myself
So I don't blame myself
