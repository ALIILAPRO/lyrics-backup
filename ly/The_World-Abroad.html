		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When we are apart, oh I don’t feel anything.
It's like I’m waiting to start, waiting to begin again.
I try to think, and I can’t think about anything.
Except you in my arms; I would give everything

To find you, I would search all over the world
If I knew, you were waiting to be my girl,
To find you, I'd never stop I give you my word,
I’d give you the world

When we are apart, I know, that I’ll feel whole again
And its not going to last. No, we always draw each other in
My head knows this, but, my heart, simply cannot be convinced
Without you in my arms, I can’t feel anything.

To find you, I would search all over the world
If I knew, you were waiting to be my girl,
To find you, I'd never stop I give you my word,
I’d give you the world
