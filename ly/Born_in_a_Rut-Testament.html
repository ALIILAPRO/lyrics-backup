		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Born in a rut, raised to love abuse
No innocence, never needed an excuse
To lie and cheat, the word on the street
Is just I am just no good, right?

(Yeah, I know I'm not right, but I just don't care)

Now I won't budge, keep your hands off me
Less you hear is the less that I believe
I still lie and cheat the word on the street
And yes, I'm no good, right?

Hey you, don't tell me what to believe
Hey you, I wear my heart on my sleeve
Hey you, I am the way that I seem
Hey you, you never listen to me

I really don't give a damn
I was born to lose
I will not live forever
I don't need no excuse

The day I die, no tears be cried
'Cause this what I choose
This tragedy is my destiny
There's nothing I can do

(Yeah, I know I still got problems, but I just don't care, right?)

I really don't give a damn
I was born to lose
I will not live forever
I don't need no excuse

The day I die, no tears be cried
'Cause this what I choose
This tragedy is my destiny
There's nothing I can do
