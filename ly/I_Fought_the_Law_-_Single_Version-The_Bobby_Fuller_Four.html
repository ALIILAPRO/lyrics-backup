		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm breakin' rocks in the hot sun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

I needed money 'cause I had none (ahh)
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

I left my baby and I feel so bad (ahh)
I guess my race is run (ahh)
But she's the best girl I've ever had (ahh)
I fought the law and the law won (ahh)
I fought the law and the law won (ahh)

Robbin' people with a six-gun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

I miss my baby and the good fun (ooh)
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

I left my baby and I feel so bad (ahh)
I guess my race is run (ahh)
But she's the best girl I've ever had (ahh)
I fought the law and the law won (ahh)
I fought the law and the law won (ahh)
