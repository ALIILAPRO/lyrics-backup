		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heal your frays, just to know you'll wear them thin again
Peel off the name, that I gave and I knew you wore within
Forget our nave, the summer spent within

For all that its worth now you were worth it in the end,
For all off your worth I would lapse and fall again,
For all that its worth i would have loved you until the end,
But i'm cold in your heart and you're branded into mine.

Bruise the hope,
our endeavour would ever see the light,
choose your own,
i'll face the world knowing that you've grown,
and i'll leave your curls and move past alone
