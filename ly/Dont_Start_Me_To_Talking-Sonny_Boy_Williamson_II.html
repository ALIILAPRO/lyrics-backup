		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I'm goin' down to Rosie's, stop at Fannie Mae's 
Gonna tell Fannie what I heard her boyfriend say

Don't start me talkin', I'll tell her everything I know 
I'm gonna break up this signifyin', 'cause somebody's got to go 

Jack give his wife two dollars, go downtown and get some margarine 
Gets out on the streets, ol' George stopped her 
He knocked her down and blackened her eye 
She gets back home, tell her husband a lie 

Don't start me talkin, I'll tell everything I know 
I'm gonna break up this signifyin', somebody's got to go 

She borrowed some money, go to the beauty shop 
Jim honked his horn, she begin to stop 
Said, take me, baby, around the block
I'm goin to the beauty shop, where I can get my hair sot

Don't start me talkin', I'll tell everything I know 
Well, to break up this signifyin', oh, somebody's got to go
