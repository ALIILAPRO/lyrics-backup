		  Tonight 
Fine night tonight 
Fine night tonight 

It's going to be a fine night tonight 
It's going to be a fine night tonight 

It's a fine day 
People open windows 
They leave their houses 
Just for a short while 

It's a fine day 
People open windows 
They leave their houses 
Just for a short while

It's going to be a fine night tonight 
It's going to be a fine day tomorrow 
It's going to be a fine night tonight 
It's going to be a fine day tomorrow 

It's a fine day 
People open windows 
They leave their houses 
Just for a short while

They walk by the grass 
They look at the sky 
They walk by the grass 
And they look at the grass 
They look at the sky 

It's going to be a fine night tonight 
It's going to be a fine day tomorrow 
It's going to be a fine night tonight 
It's going to be a fine day tomorrow 

Look at the sky 
Look at the sky 
Look at the sky 

It's going to be a fine night tonight 
It's going to be a fine day tomorrow 
It's going to be a fine night tonight 
It's going to be a fine day tomorrow 
It's going to be a fine night tonight 
It's going to be a fine day tomorrow 
It's going to be a fine night tonight 
It's going to be a fine day tomorrow 
It's going to be a fine night tonight 
It's going to be a fine night tonight 
It's going to be a fine night tonight 
It's going to be a fine night tonight 
It's going to be a fine night tonight 
It's going to be a fine night tonight
