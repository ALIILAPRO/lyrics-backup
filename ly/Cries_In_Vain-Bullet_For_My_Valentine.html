		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lord knows I've cried a thousand tears tonight
But nothing seams to quench the first
You keep on craving
But now I need a answer to my question
Your not there so I think to listen

Has no one told you
Your cry's are all in vain
And everyone keeps tryin' take that all away
Has no one told you
Your cry's are all in vain
Your cry's!

Lord I can't describe the look inside my eyes
The more I try to look away the more I'm staring
But now I need a answer to my question
Your not there so I think to listen
Listen

Has no one told you
Your cries are all in vain
And everyone keeps tryin' take that all away
Has no one told you
Your cries are all in vain
Your cries!

Your cries in vain [Repeat x4]
I look away!!! Way way way

Has no one told you
Your cries are all in vain
And everyone keeps tryin' take that all away
Has no one told you
Your cries are all in vain
Your cries!

Has nobody told you when you away
The stories they told you still run through your veins
Nobody told you when you away
The stories they told you still run through your veins
Run through your veins
