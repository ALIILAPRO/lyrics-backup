		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Run up on you Grey surviving
Puffing on that wet saliva
Flickin' ashing nicotine up
On your body then I'm rising
Over top ascending to the motherfucking sky
I'm that all black cloud making it rain out ya eyes
I'm a soul keeper no need for no people
In my circle sucking up my energy for no reason
Hoes teasing I
Feed em with my dick until my kids up in they belly
Well I couldn't a motherfuck if you don't wanna listen to the boy
I be pissing on you boys
I be licking on the girls
Make it freaky with the noise
I ain't thinking I just take it then I blink until I shaking
And my conscious it gon make me do some shit that's so forsaken uh
Under my tomb
Gripping that tool
Zed got 9's they aiming at you
Take yo life in a blink or two
Think you cool? You that dude?
No you not, I'm the kettle you the pot
And I'm repping 187 til I motherfuckin' drop boy yuh
Talking shit
I don't give a fuck
Cutting off they heads
We got machetes tucked
Spinnin around the block
Watching bodies drop
Milo with glock
Never stop
Now im chopping up these lines while shawty get on top
My eyes are rolling back
Everything is going black
And I'm gripping up on the scythe
And swinging til ya skull crack
Cause when i walk around the ground starts to shake
When salivas in the mix yeah we causing earthquakes
I'm a scumbag
Yeah i thought i told you that
Yeah we smoking pressure pack
Ain't got no racks up in my lap
My heads in the clouds cause we smoking on the purp
I'm begging for death just let me rot in the dirt
Ghost riding in the whip while Saliva drive the hearse
Let the rats eat my carcass 6 feet deep beneath the earth
Rolling the dice
Taking my life
Crushing it up and I chopping a line
Give me a sign
Screaming in the void, i'm running out of time
