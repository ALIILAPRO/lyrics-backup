		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You been the one that he runs to
When he's got nobody else
Holding him up even when you
Feel like you're sinking yourself

And you say he's gonna change we've
Already been through this
Tears on my shoulder to prove it
And it breaks me that you can't see
He'll only keep letting you down
If he don't know what he's got now
He never will
If he don't know what he wants now
He won't until it's too late
So don't wait for somebody
If you're just somebody
He can live without

If he don't know what he's got now
Just let him go
He'll only know what he's lost when
He's all alone it's too late
No you don't need to try
If he don't treat you right by now
He never will

Can't even put in the effort
Or make up a better excuse
Said he'll be there for you
Be there for you whenever
Guess he found something better to do

But you say he's gonna change we've
Already been through this
Tears on my shoulder to prove it
And it breaks me that you can't see
He'll only keep letting you down, oh

If he don't know what he's got now
He never will
If he don't know what he wants now
He won't until it's too late
So don't wait for somebody
If you're just somebody
He can live without
If he don't know what he's got now
Just let him go
He'll only know what he's lost when
He's all alone it's too late
No you don't need to try
If he don't treat you right by now
He never will

When you're driving home at night
Does he give you butterflies
Does he take the long way
Just so you don't have to say goodbye
When you're standing at the door
Does he make you feel like you're
Everything he's ever wanted
Kiss you 'till your lips are sore

If he don't know what he's got now
He never will
If he don't know what he wants now
He won't until it's too late
So don't wait for somebody
If you're just somebody
He can live without
If he don't know what he's got now
Just let him go
He'll only know what he's lost when
He's all alone it's too late
No you don't need to try
If he don't treat you right by now
He never will
