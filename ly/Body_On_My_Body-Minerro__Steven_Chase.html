		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a little bit complicated
My, oh, my
Wish I never watched you walk out
It's a little bit frustrating
I can't lie
Guess I never knew what I found

I know that we said we're moving on
But I don't think it's over
I need one more night with you alone
One more night of closure
I won't let you go
So let me pull you closer

I need your lovin', I'm done touching by myself
I want your body on my body, baby
Don't want nobody, anybody, no one else
I want your body on my body, baby

It's a little bit overrated
Going out
Trying to get a stranger in your bed
And nothing else is amazing
When you find
When you've had the best you can get

I know that we said we're moving on
But I don't think it's over
I need one more night with you alone
One more night of closure
I won't let you go
So let me pull you closer

I need your lovin', I'm done touching by myself
I want your body on my body, baby

I need your lovin', I'm done touching by myself
I want your body on my body, baby
Don't want nobody, anybody, no one else
I want your body on my body, baby
I need your lovin', I'm done touching by myself
I want your body on my body, baby
Don't want nobody, anybody, no one else
I want your body on my body, baby
