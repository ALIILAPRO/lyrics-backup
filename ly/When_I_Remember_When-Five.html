		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the things I said
I should have said and didn't say
And I wonder why, yes I wonder why
I think about the time we spent
The places that we went
Still makes me cry, yes it makes me cry
Why do they say that time will heal this broken heart?
They would know it isn't true
If they lost someone like you, oh

Chorus:
Some things can never be replaced
Some things are with me for always
These are the things I will remember
(When I remember when)
I'd rather love and lose it all
Than never have you to recall
These are the things I will remember
(Again and then again)
Again and again
When I remember when

You taught me how to love
I am all I am
Because of you, just because of you (oh)
Everytime I lost my way
You shine a light, you made my day
You see me through, yes you see me through

So who's gonna come around to heal this broken heart?
Show me how to laugh and cry
But never how to say goodbye

(Chorus)

Yes life goes on, you carry on
You do, and it's okay
(When I remember when)
Yes love goes on
And I will live to love another day
(When I remember when)
Yes life goes on, you carry on
You do, and it's okay
I would laugh, and I would cry
But I will never say goodbye

(Chorus)

Yeah, ah
When I remember when...
