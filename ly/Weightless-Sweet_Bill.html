		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There was two lovers
Caught up in the middle of moonlight
Drunk on each other
Stumbaling but somehow we move right
Tajin and tequila
The bar's gonna close, but I didn't wanna go
Cause I need ya
Grab me by the hand I just wanna be ya man
And be weightless
Handed me the bottle I take this
Gravity is pulling me shapeless
I don't really think I can go, can go, oh

You can't go on again
Some things you said I can't forget
You see it through my lens
You witnessing my only friend
I let my demons show
You let 'em in now can we go
Home home
You looking back at all
The people that we used to be
You wanna be alone
well baby I refuse to leave
I let my demons show
You let 'em in now can we go
Home

Sweet like a cavity
She be grabbing me
know that I like it

Usually apathy
Was happening
Don't won't to fight it
Couple of the caps to the dome
Now I'm feeling right at home
I'm excited
We be talkin on the phone
Then she tell me she alone
I can bite it
Oh oh ohh
And be weightless
Handed me the bottle I take this
Gravity is pulling me shapeless
I don't really think I can go, can go, oh

You can't go on again
Some things you said I can't forget
You see it through my lens
You witnessing my only friend
I let my demons show
You let 'em in now can we go
Home home
You looking back at all
The people that we used to be
You wanna be alone
well baby I refuse to leave
I let my demons show
You let 'em in now can we go
Home

We can go, we can go, we can go, now we can go, home, now we can go
Now we can go, home
We can go
We can go
