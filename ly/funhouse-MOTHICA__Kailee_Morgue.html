		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Verse 1: Mothica]
Dressin' up like an optimist
Showin' my skin, it's obvious
If I was smaller, it wouldn't bother them
Countin' my flaws like calories
I know it isn't good for me
Will I feel better with a new measurement?

[Pre-Chorus: Mothica]
If I can't have the chemicals
I need something to control
'Round and 'round and 'round we go

[Chorus: Mothica]
In the funhouse, I can never tell what's real
Break the mirrors, now I'm lookin' how I feel
Lights, camera, action, I'm in the background
Wondering when they'll notice me
In the funhouse, ahh

[Verse 2: Kailee Morgue]
Must be in my head or something
(They don't even it see coming)
""Girl, you know you look so prеtty""
(I don't really see what they see)
I know that I'm preachin' to thе choir
But I just wish that they'd be fucking quiet
[Pre-Chorus: Kailee Morgue]
If I can't have the chemicals
Then I need something to control
'Round and 'round and 'round we go

[Chorus: Mothica]
In the funhouse, I can never tell what's real
Break the mirrors, now I'm lookin' how I feel
Lights, camera, action, I'm in the background
Wondering when they'll notice me
I wanna stand out, but keep the lights down
I'm so afraid of what they'll see

[Bridge: Mothica]
What I see isn't me, it's distorted (It's distorted)
Through the glass, looking back, I'm performing (I'm performing)
What I see isn't me, it's distorted (It's distorted)
What I see isn't me, isn't me

[Chorus: Mothica]
In the funhouse, I can never tell what's real
Break the mirrors, now I'm lookin' how I feel
Lights, camera, action, I'm in the background
Wondering when they'll notice me
I wanna stand out, but turn the lights down
I'm so afraid of what they'll see
[Outro: Mothica]
In the funhouse
