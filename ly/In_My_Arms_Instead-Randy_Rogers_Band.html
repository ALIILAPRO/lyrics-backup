		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the leaves have turned to rust
The air is getting thin
I can see my breath
The night is rolling in

The sky is grey
It's cold as a stone
It's just the kind of day
I can't stand to be alone

'Cause you, you've been on my mind
I wish you were here
Beside me tonight lying in this bed
'Cause I, I'm just not the same
I walk down these streets, swear I hear your name
But it's just in my head
I wish you were in my arms instead

I wasn't thinking about you
When I thought I saw your car
I can't escape you for long
You know I never get too far

You're everywhere I go
'Cause you're everywhere I've been
You're everything I've wanted
And I want you back again

'Cause you, you've been on my mind
I wish you were here
Beside me tonight lying in this bed
'Cause I, I'm just not the same
I walk down these streets, swear I hear your name
But it's just in my head
I wish you were in my arms instead

I have to find a way, that's just how it is
I'm stuck here in this place

You, you've been on my mind
I wish you were here
Beside me tonight lying in this bed
'Cause I, I'm just not the same
I walk down these streets, swear I hear your name
But it's just in my head
I wish you were in my arms instead
I wish you were in my arms instead
