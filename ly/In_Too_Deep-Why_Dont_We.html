		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Used to be scared of the ocean
'Cause I didn't know how to swim
I took one sip of your potion
Now I'm just divin' right in

I heard your siren's call, it was beautiful
I am drowning, but please don't save me

I'm in too deep
Can't touch the bottom with my feet
Don't know what you did to me, I can't breathe but I'm living
I'm in too deep
Can't touch the bottom with my feet
Don't know what you did to me, I can't breathe but I'm living

I'm in too deep
Ah ooh-ah-ooh-ooh
Ah ooh-ah-ooh-ooh
I'm in too deep
Ah ooh-ah-ooh-ooh

Treasure chest full of your diamonds
I don't mind staying down here
Thought by now I would be dyin'
But your love gives me all my air

I heard your siren's call, it was beautiful
I am drowning, but please don't save me

I'm in too deep
Can't touch the bottom with my feet
Don't know what you did to me, I can't breathe but I'm living
I'm in too deep
Can't touch the bottom with my feet
Don't know what you did to me, I can't breathe but I'm living

I'm in too deep
Ah ooh-ah-ooh-ooh
Ah ooh-ah-ooh-ooh
I'm in too deep
Ah ooh-ah-ooh-ooh
Ah ooh-ah-ooh-ooh
Ah ooh-ah-ooh-ooh
I'm in too deep

I heard your sirens call, it was beautiful

I'm in too deep
Can't touch the bottom with my feet
Don't know what you did to me, I can't breathe but I'm living

I'm in too deep
I never thought that you could be
A underwater symphony, I can't breathe but I'm living
I'm in too deep
Can't touch the bottom with my feet
Don't know what you did to me, I can't breathe but I'm living

I'm in too deep
Ah ooh-ah-ooh-ooh
Ah ooh-ah-ooh-ooh
I'm in too deep
Ah ooh-ah-ooh-ooh
Ah ooh-ah-ooh-ooh
Ah ooh-ah-ooh-ooh
I'm in too deep
