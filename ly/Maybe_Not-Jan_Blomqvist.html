		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The supermarket man
doesn’t sell a brand
new life.
What if I need one?
New apartments on the moon.
Be the first to move there soon.
Space to breathe
and lots of room.
Maybe not.

I need a moment of your time.
I am running out of mine.
Mister Hora,
hey where’s my time?
Do you have a second?
A second life maybe?
Maybe not.
Then it’s all we got.
all we got

I'm gonna call you when
it feels like home again.
I'm gonna call you then,
call you then.
I'm gonna call you when
it feels like home again.
Call you then.
For sure I’ll call you then.

We’ll find a second earth,
our unreachable backup World.
Oh, oh yeah
Maybe not.
