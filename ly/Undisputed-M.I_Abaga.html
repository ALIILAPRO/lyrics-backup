		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Naija stand up
J town stand up
ABJ stand up
2010 stand up
We have arrived
M I too ooh this is officially the countdown
C City baby
Jago & Ice aaah ooh
Yes yes ya'll ooh
Let's go yeah 4 3 2 1

Undisputed champion
Nobody can do what I've done nobody
Nobody fit crash me nobody
Nobody do pass me nobody
Nobody fit chance me nobody
E be like say dem don jazz me nobody
Dem don jazz me nobody
E be like say dem don jazz me

Which kind witch craft which kind juju
Can make u do the things u do
Girls go gaga guys go cuckoo
When you write the tracks and go
Through you who came in the game just like mumu
Now you choping the game it's like fufu
Which vodoo make the flow proper
Which medicine man or witch doctor
No sisha no shepe aah eemi o repete
My time is prime im like keke keke
Just jeje making my pepper pepper
No obstacle or no hindrance nobody
No gate in front of my entrance nobody
No checkpoint no roadblock nobody
ln a matter of time l'm gon blow up nobody

Undisputed champion
Nobody can do what I've done nobody
Nobody fit crash me nobody
Nobody do pass me nobody
Nobody fit chance me nobody
E be like say dem don jazz me nobody
Dem don jazz me nobody
E be like say dem don jazz me

Every time I grab the MIC I know l know
My flow insane like a psycho psycho
Flow so fat its leading like pooh like pooh
Flow so hot it burns I'm pyro pyro
Undisputed that's the title title
Top of the continent like Cairo Cairo
Even down South I rock like Kwaito Kwaito
I'm too bad I'm bad like Michael Michael
M I about to change the game two times two times
Haterz can kiss between my two tights two tights
Choc Boys rising with the new guys new guys
Anything I can do they do twice
Anybody else we need a few trys
Some say they better than me its suicide
Anyone who can use their 2 eyes
Know say them no go fit my shoe size
Cos I am

Undisputed champion
Nobody can do what I've done nobody
Nobody fit crash me nobody
Nobody do pass me nobody
Nobody fit chance me nobody
E be like say dem don jazz me nobody
Dem don jazz me nobody
E be like say dem don jazz me

Undisputed champion
Nobody can do what I've done nobody
Nobody fit crash me nobody
Nobody do pass me nobody
Nobody fit chance me nobody
E be like say dem don jazz me nobody
Dem don jazz me nobody
E be like say dem don jazz me
