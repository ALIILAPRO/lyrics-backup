		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I gaze into the blackened sky
Before my eyes eternity opens
I can feel it through the night
The calling of the mist
Burning shapes born in shadows
My name they speak in tounges
They bid me welcome to explore
The frozen land of sin
Visions forms into the clouds
Behold! The face of mine
The truly me is no linger a quest
Under black winds I ride
The hunger for my soul
Raise into the sacred knife
I hear the moans of death
My life has to end
With sacred gleaming steel
I cut myself
I drain from blood
My sight gets dim
I rejoice as I bleed
No longer feel the pain
Eternal winter inside
I end my life
Life demise - Released from living
Cleansed from the pain - Reborn in
The arms of the dark divine
Life demise - I fade into eternity
Darkest angel lead me on...
I gaze into the blackened sky
Before my eyes eternity opens
I can feel it through the night
The calling for my soul
Visions forms into the clouds
Behold! The face of mine
The truly me is no linger a quest
Under black wings I ride
With sacred gleaming steel
I cut myself
I drain from blood
My sight gets dim
I rejoice as I bleed
No longer feel the pain
Eternal winter inside
I end my life
Life demise - Released from living
Cleansed from the pain - Reborn in
The arms of the dark divine
Life demise - I fade into eternity
Darkest angel lead me on...
