		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go

Conflict, terror, hear the noise
You're on the edge of a nerve-racking force
But oh my god, you're so fine
Never siege, never riot, must defy

Well look at me, what do you see?
Another trophy, a living fucking dead beat
Close your eyes take a step with me
You're soft, got no time to waste
Exhibiting abnormality 
Careful what you call reality
But you will always forget
One thing I'd like you to know

I don't give a flying fuck motherfucker
I don't give a flying fuck motherfucker
I don't give a flying
I don't give a flying
I don't give a flying fuck

I'll never wait for any interference
When the other people talk all over my shit
But do I pray thee, yes I do
So fuck hypocrisy and fuck you too

Incoming

Say one more word, I double dare you (bring it on)
It's my world, you're in it, it'll take you down in a minute
You can alter your look, diversify your age
But the truth seems like a bitch slap in your face

Well look at me, what do you see?
Another trophy, a living fucking dead beat
Close your eyes, take a step with me
You're soft, got no time to waste
Exhibiting abnormality 
Careful what you call reality
But you will always forget
One thing I'd like you to know

I don't give a flying fuck motherfucker
I don't give a flying fuck motherfucker
I don't give a flying
I don't give a flying
I don't give a flying fuck

Incoming

Say one more word, I double dare you (bring it on)
It's my world, you're in it, it'll take you down in a minute
You can alter your look, diversify your age
But the truth seems like a bitch slap in your face
