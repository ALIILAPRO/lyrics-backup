		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Suck and suck
Suckin' up all you can, suckin' up all you can suck and suck
Workin' up under my patience like a little tick
Fat little parasite
Suck me dry

My friend is bruised and borrowed
You thieving bastards
You have turned my blood cold and bitter
Beat my compassion black and blue

Hope this is what you wanted
Hope this is what you had in mind
'Cause this is what you're getting
I hope you're choking
I hope you choke on this
I hope you're choking
I hope you choke on this

Taken all I can, taken all I can, I can take
Taken all you can, taken you can, we can take
Got nothing left to give to you

Blood suckin' parasitic little tick
blood suckin parasitic little
Blood suckin' parasitic little tick
Take what you want and then go

Hope this is what you wanted
Hope this is what you had in mind
'Cause this is what you're getting

Suck me dry
Suck, suck me dry
Sucking me dry
Suck, suck me dry

Is this what you wanted?
Is this what you had in mind?
Is this what you wanted?
'Cause this is what you're getting

I hope, I hope, I hope you choke
