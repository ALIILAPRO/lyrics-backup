		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't hit me up
Acting like we're homies now
Or something
I've had enough
I'm either what you're all about
Or I'm nothing

Learn to take a hint, boy
I thought I fucking told ya
I don't wanna talk
Already got all of my closure
Ain't no need to fake nice
Want this to be over
Said that you don't want me
But you keep on getting closer

I don't need no more friends
Yeah, I already got too many
So you don't need to pretend
Like you really give a fuck about me
'Cause if we ain't lovers
Got no use for each other
And I don't need no more friends
Yeah, I already got too many

I used to really love you now I don't
Got butterflies when you lit up my phone
But now I don't
The smell of your perfume
It makes me wanna slit my throat

Learn to take a hint
Boy, I thought I fucking told ya
I don't wanna talk
Already got all of my closure
Ain't no need to fake nice
Want this to be over
Said that you don't want me
But you keep on getting closer

I don't need no more friends
Yeah, I already got too many
So you don't need to pretend
Like you really give a fuck about me
'Cause if we ain't lovers
Got no use for each other
And I don't need no more friends
Yeah, I already got too many
I don't need no more friends
'Cause I already got too many

Gotta cut it off
Baby, all you are is deadweight
Can't be moving on
When you got me in this headspace

Gotta cut it off
Baby, all you are is deadweight
Can't be moving on
When you got me in this headspace
I'm so fucking over you

Gotta cut it off
Baby, all you are is deadweight
Can't be moving on
When you got me in this headspace

Gotta cut it off
Baby, all you are is deadweight
Can't be moving on
When you got me in this headspace

I don't need no more friends
(I don't need no more friends)

'Cause if we ain't lovers
Got no use for each other
And I don't need no more friends
Yeah I already got too many
(Oh oh, yeah yeah)
I don't need no more friends
(No, no I don't need them)
'Cause I already got too many

I don't need no more friends
