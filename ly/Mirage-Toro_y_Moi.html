		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just want everybody to have a good time
I really do

Take me far away
'Cause I know my words can be a waste of breath
Space is running low
She thinks I'm guilty of this crime
But I don't think I'll wait to tomorrow
Tomorrow's so far
It seems like a flaw in design
I seek you out and you never seem to have the time

Mirage, so careful now
Too close, you're finding out
Is it me being blind?
Notice that I'm high as a kite
And now I'm pacing too fast to speak
It's me, so fine
I was only looking to be with you now
So take it or leave it, take it or treat it
So high
I dunno why I do this to myself
So high, so high, so high
So high

"Oh hello, I didn't see you there"
