		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You seem so young again
I think that's because you're in pain
Don't be so hard on yourself
For god's sake, have a cigarette

And don't stoop to laugh at yourself
Have another cigarette
Have a drink, talk too loud
Be a fool in the crowd
But forgive yourself, forgive yourself

To sing is to pray twice
And I hate people who give me advice
When you mess up
And baby, you'll mess up

And you seem so young again
Oh, but it's hard to explain
Don't be so hard on yourself
Don't think you're inappropriate
And don't just discard your old self

You're never inappropriate
In a world of microaggressions
Little human transgressions
Forgive yourself, forgive yourself

To sing is to pray twice
And I hate people who give advice
When you mess up
And baby, you'll mess up
When you mess up
And Christ, we all mess up
