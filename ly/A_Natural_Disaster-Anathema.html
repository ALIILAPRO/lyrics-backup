		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been a long cold winter without you
I've been crying on the inside over you
You just slipped through my fingers as life turned away
It's been a long cold winter since that day

And it's hard to find, hard to find
Hard to find the strength now but I try
And I don't wanna, I don't wanna
Don't wanna go on and speak now of what's gone by

'Cause no matter what I say
No matter what I do
I can't change what happened
I can't change what happened
No matter what I say
No matter what I do
I can't change what happened
I can't change what happened
No matter what I say
No matter what I do
I can't change what happened
I can't change what happened
No, no I can't change

You just slipped through my fingers
And I feel so ashamed
You just slipped through my fingers
And I failed

'Cause no matter what I say
No matter what I do
I can't change what happened
I can't change what happened
No matter what I say
No matter what I do
I can't change what happened
I can't change what happened
No matter what I say
No matter what I do
I can't change what happened
I can't change what happened
No, no I can't change

You just slipped through my fingers
And I feel so ashamed
You just slipped through my fingers
And I failed

'Cause no matter what I say
No matter what I do
You can't change what happened
Can't change what happened
No matter what I do
No matter what I say
Can't change what happened
Can't change what happened
No matter what I say
No matter what I do
Can't change what happened
Can't change what happened
No matter what I do
No matter what I say
Can't change what happened
Can't change what happened
(You just slipped through my fingers)
No matter what I do
No matter what I say
Can't change what happened
Can't change what happened
(And I feel so ashamed)
No matter what I say
No matter what I do
Can't change what happened
Can't change what happened
(You just slipped through my fingers)
No matter what I say
No matter what I do
Can't change what happened
Can't change what happened
(And I failed)
No matter what I say
No matter what I do
Can't change what happened
Can't change what happened
(You just slipped through my fingers)
(And I feel so ashamed)
(You just slipped through my fingers)
(And I failed)
