		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been seein' someone new
Hopin' to fall and tryin' to lose my breath again
She's got it all but it won't do
I can't seem to erase the thought of you

Every time I try to move on
Every road is just a dead end
All the lies I tell myself are just digging me deeper, yeah
I'm running out of ways, mm, to throw away your pictures
I'm running out of ways to say I'm fine
Lost track of all the days and things I do to forget you
I'm running out of ways to miss you, mm
I'm running out of ways to miss you

I've been takin' different streets
Trying to avoid the tree we carved our initials into
But every rock, under my feet, oh
It's always you, it don't matter where I go

Every time I try to move on
Every road is just a dead end
All the lies I tell myself are just digging me deeper, yeah
I'm running out of ways, mm, to throw away your pictures
I'm running out of ways to say I'm fine
Lost track of all the days and things I do to forget you
I'm running out of ways to miss you, mm
I'm running out of ways to miss you

But I had it all worked out, not like it's new to me
But letting go this time around ain't like it used to be
'Cause I'm runnin' out of ways, mm to throw away your pictures
I'm running out of ways to say I'm fine
Lost track of all the days and things I do to forget you
I'm running out of ways to miss you, mm
I'm running out of ways to miss you, mm
I'm running out of ways to miss you
