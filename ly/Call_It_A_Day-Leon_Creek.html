		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sisters and brothers - all you others too.
Sinners and believers - yeah we are talking to you.
Working in the field - working on the city streets.
Grinding in the alleys - on the corners - in the bay.
You fight the good fight - now you're starting to fade.
Raise that glass high to the sky and call it a day.

You keep breaking a sweat - you keep hurting your back.
You keep giving all your giving - and nobody gives jack.
But you keep on whistling, working, and singing along.
Now the suns done shining and the skies turned grey.
Gonna light one up and grab that old ashtray
Raise that glass high to the sky and call it a day.

Singin' hey now hey - call it a day
hey now - call it a day
Singin' hey now hey - call it a day
hey now - call it a day

Everybody's hustling - everybody's on the grind
Looking for the answers - tryin' to make up their minds
Searching high and low - when the answers so easy to find
Some folks are gonna get on their knees to pray
cnd some folks are gonna slow down and meditate.
Us folks are gonna raise that glass high and call it a day.

The moral to this song, take it easy on yourself
If your hustle don't help, put your hustle on the shelf
Take time, take it easy, and slow it down.
Next thing you know - you'll be old and grey.
- Looking right back at all of the choices you made.
Then you'll raise that glass high to the sky and call it a day.


Singin' hey now hey - call it a day
hey now - call it a day
Singin' hey now hey - call it a day
hey now - call it a day
