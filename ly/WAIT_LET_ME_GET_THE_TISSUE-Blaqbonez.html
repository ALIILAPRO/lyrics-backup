		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm alive, man, I never had issues
Pull out every time 'cause I no like epistle
Every time wey me shoot her mi pistol
Tell her, "girlie wait, baby, let me get the tissue"
I'm alive, man, I never had issues
Pull out every time 'cause I no like epistle
Every time wey me shoot her mi pistol
Tell her, "girlie wait" (wait, wait)

See
Meet and greet, Bounce and split
Sit down on my lap, lemme feel your jigs
Sit down on my lap, lemme pull your wigs
Sit down on my lap like you're never gonna leave, (oh-whoa)
An appetizer, and start to suck on a D, she feel the fire (ooh)
She no fit hide am, she look me inna mi eye, she say "just like that?"

You know when a bad man hear that, I'ma lick it little low, I wanna hear that
Whisper in her ears and, "I'm about to fuck the shit out of you, bitch"
She done the whistle when I slide in, like ah Holy Ghost something
And after when she go all night, she say, "Daddy, would you cum for me", whoa

I'm alive, man, I never had issues
Pull out every time 'cause I no like epistle
Every time wey me shoot her mi pistol
Tell her, "girlie wait, baby, let me get the tissue"
I'm alive, man, I never had issues
Pull out every time 'cause I no like epistle
Every time wey me shoot her mi pistol
Tell her, "girlie wait" (wait, wait)

What's a Blaqbonez's album without my voice?
Blaq, I can't believe you did this one without me
But, we'll get them next time
Bling, bling, bling, bling
Ding, ding, ding, ding
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
