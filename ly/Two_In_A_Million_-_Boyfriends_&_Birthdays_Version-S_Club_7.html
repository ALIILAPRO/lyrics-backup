		  Oh hoh
Woo
Out of all the boys you're not like the others
From the very first day I knew we'd be lovers
In my wildest dreams, my darkest desire
Would I declare to you your love takes me higher (aah)
Just when we both thought our lives were set in stone
They shone a light and brought us together (ooh)

We are two in a million
We've got all the luck we could be given
If the world (the world) should stop (should stop)
We'll still have each other
And no matter what (no matter what) we'll be forever as one

It's a crazy world where everything's changing
One minute you're up and the next thing you're breaking (yay)
When I lose my way and the skies they get heavy
It'll be okay the moment you're with me
No one would have guessed we'd be standing strong today
Solid as a rock and perfect in every way

We are two in a million
We've got all the luck (the luck) we could be given
If the world should stop we'll still have each other
And no matter what (no matter) what (no matter what)
We'll be forever as one
Forever as one

We are two in a million (yeah)
We've got all the luck (the luck) we could be given (oh)
If the world should stop we'll still have each other
And no matter what we'll be forever as one
We are two in a million (yeah)
We've got all the luck (hey) we could be given
If the world should stop we'll still have each other (yeah)
And no matter what, we'll be forever as one
We are two in a million (two in a million)
We've got all the luck we could be given (we could be given)
If the world should stop we'll still have each other
And no matter what (no matter what) we'll be forever as one
No matter what (no matter what) we'll be forever as one
No matter what (no matter what) we'll be forever as one
