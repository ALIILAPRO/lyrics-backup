		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you feeling sad and lonely
There's a service I can render
Tell me the one who lost you only
I can be so warm and tender

Call me
Don't be afraid you can call me
Maybe it's late but you call me
Tell me and I'll be around

If it seems your friends desert you
There's somebody thinking of you
I'm the one who never hurt you
Maybe it's because I love you

Call me
Don't be afraid you can call me
Maybe it's late but just call me
Tell me and I'll be around

Now don't forget me
'Cos if you let me
I'll be always stay by you

You gotta trust me
That's how is must be
There so much that I can do

If you call I'll be right with you
You and I should be together
Take this love I lone to give you
I'll be at your side forever

Call me
Don't be afraid you can call me
Maybe it's late but you call me
Tell me and I'll be around

Now don't forget me
'Cos if you let me
I'll be always stay by you

You gotta trust me
That's how is must be
There so much that I can do

If you call I'll be right with you
You and I should be together
Take this love I lone to give you
I'll be at your side forever

Call me
Don't be afraid you can call me
Maybe it's late but you call me
Tell me and I'll be around
