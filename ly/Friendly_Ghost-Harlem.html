		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I live in a graveyard
I wanna go out but it's too hot
Yeah, I'm just as see-through as Casper the Ghost
Oh, I hope you know I wanna get outta here
Help me get outta here

I can't stand it
I'm so possessive
The more you keep the closer you get to love (?)
?
I wanna disappear all the time
Help me disappear
Tonight!

You're only happy when you win
?
Whatever happened to me
Whatever happened to me, makin' you happy

I can't stand it
I'm so possessive
The more you keep the closer you get to love (?)
?
I wanna disappear all the time
Help me disappear
Tonight!

Did I do something bad
Cause you're in the worst mood I think you ever had
Did I do something wrong
Cause it's been a long long long time

I can't stand it
I'm so possessive
The more you keep the closer you get to love (?)
?
I wanna disappear all the time.
Help me disappear
Tonight!

I wanna disappear all the time
