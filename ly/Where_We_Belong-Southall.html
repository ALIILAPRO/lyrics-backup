		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The roads long and it ain't paved well. 
Sleep stage and another motel. It ain't always heaven, but it beats the hell outta staying home. 

Learned some things when i left there. It's a big world and no one really cares. Who you were. Only what you will become. 

With a chest full of air. We'll find a way to get where we belong. 

Sleepless nights and misused mornings. The keep it downs and the last warnings. You can't stay gone forevers, you can always come back homes. Don't take for granted what you're given it's all there for you if you'll go get it. Find yourself some friends and get out there on the road. 

With a chest full of air, we'll find a way to get where we belong. 
Anywhere but there I'm certain that's where we belong. 

With a chest full of air, we'll find a way to get where we belong. 
Anywhere but there I'm certain that's where we belong.
