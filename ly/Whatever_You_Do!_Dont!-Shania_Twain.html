		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Deep in Denialville
Trynna fight the way I feel
I go jello when you smile
I'd start blushin' my head rushin'
If you stand too close to me
I might melt down from the heat
If ya look my way one more time
I'm gonna go out of my mind
Whatever you do

Don't even think about it
Don't go and get me started
Don't you dare drive me crazy
Don't do that to me baby

You stop me in my tracks
My heart pumpin' to the max
I'm such a sucker for your eyes
They permanently paralyze
Whatever you do

Don't even think about it
Don't go and get me started
Don't you dare drive me crazy
Don't do that to me baby

(Whatever you do, don't do that to me)
You got my heart under attack
You give me shivers down my back
D'ya have to walk the way you do?
I get weak just watchin' you
Whatever you do

Don't even think about it
Don't go and get me started
Don't you dare drive me crazy
Don't do that to me baby

Don't even think about it
Don't go and get me started
Don't you dare drive me crazy
Don't do that to me baby
Don't do that, don't do that
