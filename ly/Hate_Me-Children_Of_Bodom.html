		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I come from the ashes of molten hatred
Raised by the demons in abodes of the end
The reaper's scythe I fall upon to light my path
Wrecked by mangled wounds of life I have become
The resurrection of the evil one
You know that I don't fucking care if I live or die!

Need a bishop preaching fire
To get away with my sins
Despise everything I see

Ain't got respect for humanity
Never lived or wanted immortality
The reaper's shadow I fall upon to obscure my path
Every day I'm getting battered up until I bleed
You motherfuckers just leave me be
You never gave me a cure for the pain I feel inside

Need a bishop preaching fire
To get away with my sins
Despise everything I see
I don't give a fuck if you hate me

Led by the reaper I walk in the night
Show me the way to your kingdom come

I believe in Armageddon
Baptized in alcohol
Embodiment of anti-Christ
I'm living for my own demise
