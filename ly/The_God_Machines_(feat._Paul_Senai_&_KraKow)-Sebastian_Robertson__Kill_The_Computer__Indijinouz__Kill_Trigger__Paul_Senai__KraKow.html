		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You have been summoned for a system read out
You can't fight the machines
And do you know why?
Because the machines are God

Adrenaline rush
About to blow 
like whoah!
But the block is slow
Now the fiends be wantin mo'
And I got control
Just like I take control
Over my hoes
Gotta hold my throne
While ridin this beat
And I keep on keep on
Going going!
Just like a
Lithium battery
Now I got everybody battling battling
Guns rattling 

Spittin faster than missiles
When it whistles
Throw down your pistols
Or end up crippled
You don't wanna catch ripples  
That'll tickle your brain a little
Right in the middle
Fuck wit ya head
As I'm makin em swivel
Now your in a pickle
Cuz your bodies brittle
My cells are not sickle
I am artificial
Welcome to Night City!

I'm Omnipotent
I'm rippin shit
I'm gifted with the gift of rippin shit
So keep on talkin shit
Keep on talkin shit
I'm  lovin in it
Straight lovin it
I'm keepin it coveted 
Undercover
And I'm comin quick
So get on yo shit
And tighten yo grip
Before you get hit
