When I get up all in ya (yeah)
We can hear the angels calling us (ch'yeah)
We can see the sunrise before us (yeah)
And when I'm in that thing, I'll make that body sang
(Deezle on the beat) I'll make you say
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee (ayy)
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee (ayy)
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee
(Like a cop car)
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee (ayy)
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee (hahaha)
I'll make ya say

(Yeah) doin' a buck in the latest drop
I got stopped by a lady cop, haha
She got me thinkin' I can date a cop, haha
'Cause her uniform pants are so tight
She read me my rights
She put me in her car, she cut off all lights
She said I had the right to remain silent
Now I got her hollerin', soundin' like a siren
Talkin' 'bout
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee (yeah)
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee (yeah)
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee (yeah)
And I know she the law, and she know I'm the boss
And she know I get high above the law
And she know I'm raw, she know I'm from the streets
And all she want me to do is fuck the police
Talkin' 'bout
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee (yeah)
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee (yeah)

When I get up all in ya
We can hear the angels calling us (yeah)
We can see the sunrise before us (mh)
And when I'm in that thing, I'll make that body sang
I'll make you say
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee (yeah)
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee
(Like a cop car)
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee (yeah)
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee (ayy)
I'll make you say

Haha, and after we got done
I said, "Lady what's ya number?" She said, "911"
Ha, emergency only
Head doctor, perform surgery on me
Yeah, and now I'm healed
I make her wear nothin' but handcuffs and heels
Then I beat it like a cop
Rodney King, baby, yeah, I beat it like a cop
Haha, beat it like a cop
Rodney King, baby, said beat it like a cop
But I ain't tryna be violent
But I'll do the time, but her love is timeless
Mrs. Officer
I know you wish your name was Mrs. Carter huh?
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee (yeah)
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee
(Like a cop car)

When I get up all in ya 
We can hear the angels calling us 
We can see the sunrise before us 
And when I'm in that thing, I'll make that body sang
I'll make you say
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee

I'll make you say

Mrs. Officer, Mrs. Officer
Tell your lieutenant get them cuffs off of ya
I'm Kidd Kidd, my face on every wanted poster
I'm wanted by every lady cop all over
That ass so big, I catch a battery to hold ya
Hands so big, you thought I told you to pull it over
She pulled me over, pulled me out the Rover
Then she pulled me closer, do me in the back of the car
Put me in handcuffs start ripping my pants off
(All you hear over the dispatcher is)
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee

When I get up all in ya 
We can hear the angels calling us 
We can see the sunrise before us 
And when I'm in that thing, I'll make that body sang
I'll make you say

Maybe you can lock me up and throw away the key
Call your sergeant and tell him you can't finish your shift
'Cause it's on tonight
Breakfast in bed turns to breakfast and-
And I can't wait to get it on (on)
I wanna do it all night long (night long, yeah), Mrs. Officer

When I get up all in ya 
We can hear the angels calling us 
We can see the sunrise before us 
And when I'm in that thing, I'll make that body sang
I'll make you say
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee 
Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee 
I'll make you say
