		  How we feelin' out there tonight?
Hahaha, yeah
I am not feeling good

Wake up at 11:30, feelin' like a bag of shit (oh no)
All my clothes are dirty, so I'm smelling like a bag of shit
Go to pour my coffee, and I miss my cup
Omg, that is just my luck
Look in the mirror, say, "what's up, you useless fuck?"

Are you feeling what I'm feeling?
I haven't had a shower in the last nine days (ah)
Staring at the ceiling and waiting for this feeling to go away
But it won't go away

I'm not really feeling like I wanna get lit
(Tell us how you're feelin') well, I feel like shit (oh, shit)
Feeling like a saggy, massive sack of shit (oh, shit)
Big ol' motherfucking duffel bag of shit (oh, shit)
All day, all shit
I'm not really feeling like I wanna get lit
(Tell us how you're feelin') I'm feeling like shit

Ladies (yeah?) Do you feel like shit?
Tell me, do you feel like shit? (Oh, yeah)
Fellas (huh?) Are you feeling like shit?
Tell me, are you feeling like shit? (Oh, yeah)
Ladies (yeah?) Do you feel like shit?
Tell me, do you feel like shit? (Oh, yeah)
Fellas (huh?) Are you feeling like shit?
Tell me, are you feelin' like shit? (Oh, yeah)
