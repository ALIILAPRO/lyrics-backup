		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come back here
There's nowhere to go
Nowhere to hide (shut up)
Inject your heart with emotions
What do you feel?
I just want to kill you
All of us are here for something
For something safe
For something real
Just open your eyes and feel this anger
Death won't find us
Till we fall

Death won't find us

Would you stay with me
When the world burns down
And we’re dancing in fire
And there’s nowhere left to go?
Run to me?
Just don’t try to fake it
You said it, we don’t have to be alone
Alone

There's nowhere to go
Nowhere to run
This is the last chance to
Burn down your whole existence
Until you’re dust

You’d rather lock me up and forget about me
You’re just digging your own grave
I built a tombstone for you
I’ll come with you
‘Till we fall
‘Till we fall
‘Till we fall

Would you stay with me
When the world burns down
And we’re dancing in fire
And there’s nowhere left to go?
Run to me?
Just don’t try to fake it
You said it, we don’t have to be alone
Alone

I can feel alive when you’re not here
And if you hurt me I’ll drag you down

I’m gonna drag you down

Would you stay with me
When the world burns down
And we’re dancing in fire
And there’s nowhere left to go?
Run to me?
Just don’t try to fake it
You said it, we don’t have to be alone
Alone
