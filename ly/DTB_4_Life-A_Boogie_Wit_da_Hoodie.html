(SephGotTheWaves)

Yeah, thinkin' 'bout you, I catch chills, my nigga
Shit ain't been the same since they killed my nigga
Broski doin' time, it get real, my nigga
I just hope you hold it down, just don't squeal, my, yeah

I'm DTB for life, no, I can't trust my bitches
I can't even trust my girl 'cause I'm a fucked up nigga, yeah
And if you say you trust me, girl, you lied
'Cause I can't even trust myself, I don't know why you waste time in your feelings, yeah

I'm DTB forever, on God, I don't trust bitches
I don't even trust my girl, I still try to fuck her friends and shit
Them niggas movin' rocky and lie
I don't even wanna talk to nobody, I got a feelin' the feds listenin'
She told me I'm not myself no more
And I swear I know exactly who I am
Girl, just love me for the differences
She told me she don't want me around
How could you feel that way, baby?
Especially after all this time with you

Now it's DTB for life, no, I can't trust my bitches
Don't you trust me neither, I'm a fucked up nigga, yeah
But if you gettin' money, that's what's up, my nigga
Bitch, you know I'm smacked, I'm smokin' blunts like cigarettes

Let's be honest, let's be real, my nigga
If a nigga play with me, I will get rid of him
Montana had the grills in his Hilfigers, yeah
My niggas Quado and Beasty, I be missin' 'em

But thinkin' about it, I catch chills, my nigga
Shit ain't been the same since they killed my nigga
Broski doin' time, it get real, my nigga
I just hope you hold it down, just don't squeal, my, yeah

I'm DTB for life, no, I can't trust my bitches
I can't even trust my girl 'cause I'm a fucked up nigga, yeah
And if you say you trust me, girl, you lied
'Cause I can't even trust myself, I don't know why you waste time in your feelings, yeah

I'm DTB and it's 'cause what she, what she done to me
So I was hopin' my baby's eyes would smile just like mine
That would've been crazy, yeah
Will I regret you? (Will I regret you? Yeah, yeah)
Will I still put you on my schedule? (Will I still put you on my?)
Yeah, put you on my itinerary (put you on my itinerary)
Said, "I ain't gon' lie, it can get scary" (I ain't gon' lie, yeah, yeah)
I know you just want me to sweat you
You say I changed, you wish I was the same as when I met you
Well, these hoes who was lyin', oh, they wanna kick it, but it get messy
Yeah, and you ain't never die if you're a legend, yeah

You don't even know how I feel, my nigga
Shit ain't been the same since they killed my nigga
I be tryna tell my bros just chill out
My little bro, he be on go, he be on drill time, nigga

I'm DTB for life, no, I can't trust my bitches
Don't even trust my girl after I tried fuckin' her friend
And if you say you love me, girl, you lied
'Cause you don't even love yourself, I don't know why you waste time in your feelings, yeah, yeah

No, no
