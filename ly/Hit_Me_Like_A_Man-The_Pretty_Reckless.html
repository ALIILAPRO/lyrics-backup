		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ow!

I am strong, love is evil
It's a version of perversion that is only for the lucky people
Take your time and do with me what you will
I won't mind, you know I'm ill, you know I'm ill

So hit me like a man and love me like a woman
Buried and sad, look me in the eyes, I want it
One will give you hell, one will give you heaven
Hit me like a man, love me like a woman
Love me like a woman

Love is strong, but I am evil
You are wrong, about me
Take your time, ah, play with me until
You can hear the children scream, like their stuck inside a dream
That you, ah, will

So hit me like a man, love me like a woman
Bury me alive, I can see it in your eyes, you want it
Some will give you pain, some will give you pleasure
Hit me like a man, love me like a woman
Love me like a woman

Don't you run away, run away from me, I will run away from you
Don't you run away, run away from me, I will run away from you

Hit me like a man, love me like a woman
From the devil deep inside, can't you see what I'm wanting?
Some will give you hell, some will give you heaven
So hit me like a man, love me like a woman
Love me like a woman
Love me like a woman
Love me like a woman, ow!
