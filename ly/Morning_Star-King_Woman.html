		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The Lord saw what he made
Yeah, it was good
Dripping from pearly gates, I was luminous
My name is Lucifer, pleased to meet you
I harp six strings in the daylight
Do you know what it means?
Well one moment I was ascending the heights

Am I far from God?
Morning star?
Yeah

The next thing I knew I was falling fast
Lightning hit my wings, heard thunder crack
Pride had infected the depths of me
Oh, I love these courts, I loved that royal family
You know it could've been you
So don't you dare judge the things that I do

Am I far from God?
Morning star?
Yeah

Lucifer falling from the heights 
Lucifer falling from the heights 
Lucifer falling from the heights 
Lucifer 
Lucifer falling from the heights 
Lucifer falling from the heights 
Lucifer falling from the heights
Lucifer
Lucifer falling from the heights 
Lucifer falling from the heights 
Lucifer falling from the heights 
Lucifer (falling from the heights)
Lucifer falling from the heights 
Lucifer falling from the heights 
Lucifer falling from the heights
Lucifer (falling from the heights)
Lucifer falling from the heights 
Lucifer falling from the heights 
Lucifer falling from the heights 
Lucifer 
Lucifer falling from the heights 
Lucifer falling from the heights 
Lucifer falling from the heights 
Lucifer falling from the heights
