		  (Adios)

Chanel fur, no top (yeah)
Rockin' the Birkin bag (yeah)
Feel like Lil' Kim (yeah)
Swervin' in a Jag (yeah)
Chanel fur, no top (yeah)
Rockin' the Birkin bag (yeah)
Feel like Lil' Kim (yeah)
Swervin' in a Jag (yeah)
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve (swerve)
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve (swerve)
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve (swerve)
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve

When I step out, I'm killin' it
My hair, yeah this that brazilian shit (yup)
Yung miami, they feelin' this (feelin' it)
Raw or robber, I hit a lick
QC record label in this bitch
My rollie got the whole room lit (lit)
Cuban link chains all on my jit
I'm lookin' good with your nigga on my wrist
He blow a bag, I blow a kiss (mwah)
He want some head, I'm 'bout to get rich
I'm goin' all in, I'm givin' 'em hell
I'm rockin' that Gucci and Chanel
Your nigga brought me a YSL
I leave the house, he on my trail
Pussy put him up under a spell
That nigga put me a check in the mail
Tell 'em felt well, gotta stay calm
He hit my bank account, hair salon
Got texts on my phone, it's gettin' ridiculous
Your man comin' home, so I'm callin' restricted (ha ha)

Chanel fur, no top (yeah)
Rockin' the Birkin bag (yeah)
Feel like Lil' Kim (yeah)
Swervin' in a Jag (yeah)
Chanel fur, no top (yeah)
Rockin' the Birkin bag (yeah)
Feel like Lil' Kim (yeah)
Swervin' in a Jag (yeah)
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve (swerve)
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve (swerve)
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve (swerve)
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve

Pull up in my jeep with the doors off (swerve)
My seats the color of my feet, I'm a show off (ha)
Bitch, I'm too hard, I never go soft (soft)
Pussy put his ass to sleep, that's that doze off
I-i-i got that ice around my neck, that's a chest cold
Gucci 'round my waist with a Glock and some bank rolls
"JT, who you fuckin'?" Bitch, why? Damn, touch your nose
I did some things last summer, I won't tell a soul (shh)
Bitch, I'm hood, I'm not bougie
Ass fat in my two-piece
Rocks juicy like hi-c
Lil' nigga, don't try me
Wanna fuck, ask nicely (yeah)
But the pussy too pricey (yeah)
Cop me diamonds, gotta ice me (yeah)
Yeah I know you wanna wife me 

Chanel fur, no top (yeah)
Rockin' the Birkin bag (yeah)
Feel like Lil' Kim (yeah)
Swervin' in a Jag (yeah)
Chanel fur, no top (yeah)
Rockin' the Birkin bag (yeah)
Feel like Lil' Kim (yeah)
Swervin' in a jag (yeah)
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve (swerve)
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve (swerve)
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve (swerve)
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve
