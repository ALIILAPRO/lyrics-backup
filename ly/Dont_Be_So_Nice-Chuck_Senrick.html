		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have you ever been lost in
A friend's eye? I have
Have you ever been tossed by the
Wayside in an old friend's mind?

But don't be so nice
That's what you told me
Don't try so hard, ain't got a chance
I've got to go please, please forgive me
That's what I wanted anyway

Yeah, and have you ever been loved
In a friend's eye? I have
Have you ever been lost and
Wanting a friend's smile?

Oh, but don't be so nice
That's what you told me
Don't try so hard, ain't got a chance
I've got to go please, please forgive me
That's what I wanted anyway
No, I wasn't asking you to stay

Oh, but don't be so nice
That's what you told me
Don't try so hard, ain't got a chance
I've got to go please, please, forgive me
That's what I wanted anyway
No, I wasn't asking you to stay
That's what I wanted you to say
