		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Quick while she turns her back, slip it in)

I'm in a meat-pack plant by the gutterside
A slaughterhouse apartment with a slice of lime
I'm cruisin' with the bruisers, boozin', I'll be a suitor, losing my mind
Because there's nothing to find
The fetid stench of bad intentions hangs in the sweat
I'm in a sauna hot with drama, and I'm tryin' to forget
All the masochistic rapture missteps
Imminent pleasure's been ready to cut to the bone

You said, "Let loose," but now you're lost
While I tied my boots like a tightrope noose
The problem chased the taste of the cause
While the evidence supports the truth, is 80 enough proof for you?

Here's to my lady, and I'm coming inside
Drink to me, baby, and what's left of what's right
It's easier to use and lose than never to have used you
On a fucked up Saturday night
Good times on Front Street
On Front Street

Loose lips sink ships, but captain, will you go down?
Float your boat 'til overboard and hoping to drown
Tell me what prevented you from coming downtown all alone?
Because we know you're not afraid
This chastity is Greek to me, the meat is still fresh
The gnashing teeth will masticate the bones from the flesh
Since nobody will tell me where these bastards go, I'll see for myself
I think they might go to hell

You said, "Let loose," but now you're lost
While I tied my boots like a tightrope noose
The problem chased the taste of the cause
While the evidence supports the truth, is 80 enough proof for you?

Here's to my lady, and I'm coming inside
Drink to me, baby, and what's left of what's right
It's easier to use and lose than never to have used you
On a fucked up Saturday night
Good times on Front Street
On Front Street, yeah

(And they goddamn disrespected me
Little idiots, idiots
I was completely respectful
They're supposed to be my brothers, right? They're my brothers?
No, no, that's not fun
What they were doing wasn't fun
They kept zapping us and zapping us
Idiots, savages, idiots, idiots)

(Ah, step right up, folks
Get yourself a a big, meaty fill of some of the most noxious
Toxic, obnoxious, disgusting shit in the world
How vile can you be?)

Is 80 enough proof for you?

Here's to my lady, and I'm coming inside
Drink to me, baby, and what's left of what's right
It's easier to use and lose than never to have used you
On a fucked up Saturday night
Always a good time on Front Street

Last call for morals, better cover your drink
Sodom and Gomorrah'd, let it go down the sink
Last call for morals, better cover your drink
Sodom and Gomorrah'd, let it go down the sink
Last call for morals, better cover your drink
Sodom and Gomorrah'd, let it go down the sink
Last call for morals, better cover your drink
Good times on Front Street
