		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Look

Uh, tour bus slidin' in the rain, headed out of state
So much goin' through my brain, I can barely think
Sometimes I get on my own and wander outer space
I love you, but I'm full of rage, our past is full of pain
On a planet of my own, livin' like an alien
Think it's safe to say that I'll never be the same again
Never fall in love again, my heart is on a shelf
My music's full of pain, but I keep my problems to myself
And I keep my mouth closed 'cause my thoughts sometimes can get too deep
My heart cold, my eyes closed, but I never go to sleep
I been all alone goin' on two weeks me, myself, and my sheets
We gon' call your phone so we can speak, but it made me feel weak
Get on the internet and see the world laugh 'bout my depression
They paintin' perfect pictures, but I ain't buyin' what they sellin'
Collect calls from the county always could make me smile
Damn, brother, you was just on the streets, and now you're goin' to trial
Yeah, mama, I made it out the streets, I hope you're finally proud
Youngin' jump out with that K, in broad day, shootin' at the crowd
Now he gettin' on top the stage, and they sing his music loud, sing his music out loud

Take away my name, take away my throne
Take away my fame, let me keep my soul
Uh, smilin' on the outside, inside dyin'
Listenin' to a grown man cryin'
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa
