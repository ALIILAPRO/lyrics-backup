		  (Hey ay)
(Hey ay)
(Hey ay)

Gonna get in your mind, one fine day
Gonna figure you out, one fine day
Dear Lord, maybe I should stay away, stay away
Little lost, little blind, blind with temptation

Tell me something, do I make you feel the way that I do?
I been uptight, you got me right, I'm back into my groove
Keep me bumpin', give me something that I could get used to
I'm a fire, gotta keep me lit all night, all night, they say

And they say my heart will bleed
But it doesn't matter to me
'Cause your love is so nasty
Boy, yeah yeah yeah
In the dark, I'm living the dream
When you pull up behind me
Like a mixer of night cream
Boy, yeah yeah yeah

Every night, club tights, touch your face
Every night I try to find out what's on your brain
Dear Mama, help me know just what to say
'Cause I don't wanna be blind with temptation

Tell me something, do I make you feel the way that I do?
I been uptight, you got me right, I'm back into my groove
Keep me bumpin', give me something that I could get used to
I'm a fire, gotta keep me lit all night, all night, they say

And they say my heart will bleed
But it doesn't matter to me
'Cause your love is so nasty
Boy, yeah yeah yeah
In the dark, I'm living the dream
When you pull up behind me
Like a mixer of night cream
Boy, yeah yeah yeah

You got me late night talking, I come over
But you won't replay in my mind, all slumber
I'm wide awake, my body shakes and shivers
I'm a fool, I guess 'cause I text you yes
Even though my friends, they say

And they say my heart will bleed (ohh yeah)
But it doesn't matter to me (to me baby)
'Cause your love is so nasty
Boy, yeah yeah yeah (ohh)
In the dark, I'm living the dream
When you pull up behind me (oh yeah)
Like a mixer of night cream
Boy, yeah yeah yeah
(Hey ay)
