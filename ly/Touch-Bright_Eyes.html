		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Touch, lying on the floor
Wishing this could last
But knowing that it can't
And soon you will leave

And I will be on the floor
Watching the TV, trying hard to find a reason to move
I'm frozen in one place, staring at the screen
Listening to the rain falling on the street

Some days go on too long
And no one can hang out tonight
Here, where the carpet is cool and soft
Underneath the clock I feel my weary heart is put to rest

You gather around your friends
The connection that you feel when the night has not yet died
You are new with a promise of a love
You will probably never find

And touch that you can really feel
The brokenness inside as hope and less collide
Now nothing is real
(You are new and near now

To someone you used to love when you were young
When all was gold and you two touched
And felt the flutter underneath your skin
You stood in glowing rooms

The light dripping from both of you
And nothing since has felt as radiant or real)
And there is nothing more I want than just one night
That's free of doubt and sadness

One night that I can really feel
