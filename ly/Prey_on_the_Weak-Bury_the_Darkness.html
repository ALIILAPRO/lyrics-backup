		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Crooked schemes selling lies and deceit
Taking yours, leaving nothing but defeat
False promises, no intent to deliver
Smile to your face
Look away and they slither
Preying on the weak as a means to survive
Playing on your passion, robbing you blind
Leveraged position for good or for greed
Saw an opportunity to sink your teeth in me
Cruel world
Villains in disguise
Speaking tounges
Venomous design
Innocence
Cast away to die
Born into a life that was built for your demise
They will never stop, they will never give
They will never stop, they will never give
Spineless and fake
Two faced masquerade
Plaguing disease
A shadowed misery
Cruel world
Villains in disguise
Speaking tounges
Venomous design
Innocence
Cast away to die
Born into a life that was fit for your demise
Spineless and fake
Slither like snakes
