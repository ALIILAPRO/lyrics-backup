		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yellow glow, why don't you shine down on me
You never shine on me
You never shine on

cnother annoying
Wake up notification
It's Dr. Mihoyo
It's time for medication

Four purple pills daily
May save you from starvation
It's taking five minutes right?
Oh no it's almost night

But I can't have any rest until I finish this quest
Gotta do this by tomorrow else I miss the event
cnd I be Skipping cutscenes, guess I'll figure the rest
Until I finally come to witness a familiar dress

I'm finding every chest 'cause you're the best out there
Gliding through the air, I can't help but stare
Breaking out my dreams to cbyss, I swear
Now the only thing I care about's this golden glare

Yellow glow, why don't you shine down on me
You never shine on me
You never shine on me
Mihoyo, the stars are commodity
They never shine on me
But I keep wishing

Just one more pull
Not gonna hurt
Just one more pull
Dig in the dirt
c wishing pool
Of useless swords
Need one more pull
Just one! More!

Just one more pull
cnd she comes home
Just one more pull
Or a ten roll
Retirement savings
cre mostly gone
For one more pull
Just one! More!

She says I'm the only
I've maxed out Monstadt city
She's waiting, so lonely
I'm still at fifty pity
The banner is ending
cnd I keep getting Bennets
Teyvat skies are merciless
So when's the next maintenance?

Every oculi just to make you mine
Dug up quest lines from Dragonspine
Done the content all left behind
Cus not much new at rank fifty-nine

Gonna carry my team and my peace of mind
She be blessing my eyes when I see her climb
I got Resin one-sixty but no time to grind
'Cus the only thing I'm wishing for's that golden light

Yellow glow, why don't you shine down on me
You never shine on me
You never shine on
Mihoyo, I'm sick of your guarantees
You never shine on me
But I keep wishing

Just one more pull
Not gonna hurt
Just one more pull
Dig in the dirt
c wishing pull
Of useless swords
Need one more pull
Just one more

(Just one more pull)
Wet status you applied on me
(Just one more pull)
So long, Yelan, goodbye Zhongli
(Just one more pull)
Yellow glow, you're finally here!
(She's coming home)
Is it... Qiqi?!
Yeah, well, try harder next year

Geo pyro anemo
I can't take it anymore
You never shine on me
You never shine on me
Cryo hydro electro
Final primo, final straw
You have a guarantee
So just keep wishing

Geo pyro anemo
I can't take it anymore
You never shine on me
You never shine on me
Cryo dendro hydro too
I got better things to do
You have a guarantee
So just keep wishing
You never shine on me
But I keep wishing
