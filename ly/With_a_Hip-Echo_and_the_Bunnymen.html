		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Halt
Nobody's allowed
Strictly verboten
Out, out, out, out
Bounds
Of course we know no bounds
Until, at least, and then
Trespass all the way down
They got it
And I want some
I can handle it
And I want some

Relax
Feel the pleasure inside
Error and trial
Collide, collide
You'll listen
I don't expect you to
We've lost
And something's all we can do
With a hip-hip-hop 
And a flip-flap-flop
Gonna steal some bananas
From the grocer's shop
With your head in the clouds
And your trousers undone
Gonna shit on the carpet
Just like everyone

This is the one for the money
This is the one for the trees
This is the one called Heaven
And this is the one for me

You've yet to discover
Discover the difference
The difference between
The moral and motto

They've got it
And I had some
I couldn't handle it
But I had some

Hold it in the light
And see right through it
For God's sake
Make a decision
Take it for a walk
And hold it hold it
Pin it on the wall
And fasten onto
Move into the bathroom
Oh yes, oh yes
Do what must be done
And don't say maybe

This is the one for the money
This is the one for the trees
This is the one called Heaven
And this is the one for me
