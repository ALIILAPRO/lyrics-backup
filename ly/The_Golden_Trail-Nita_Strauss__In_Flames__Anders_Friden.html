		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Radiation from days of past
Taste of sulphur from the acid rain
Lost the momentum, lost the rage
Feel like six feet under but I am awake

When placed against the feeling
Like days that never end
Trembling in a vacuum
I can't forget so I call your name
I can see right through it all
Yet I can't escape the sirens song
Making sure they never will
But who am I to tell right from wrong?

It's safe to say that I can't tell
There's the moment when all senses fail
Searching for the golden trail

Seconds pass and there's no way
Doesn't seem the same at all
For once I wanna feel something
We've been here before but then I fall

When placed against the feeling
Like days that never end
Trembling in a vacuum
I can't forget so I call your name
I can see right through it all
Yet I can't escape the sirens song
Making sure they never will
But who am I to tell right from wrong?

It's safe to say that I can't tell
There's the moment when all senses fail
(Head to wall, I rush right in)
Searching for the golden trail

Is there light at the end at all?
How will I know when I get too far?
I am searching for the golden trail

When placed against the feeling
Like days that never end
Trembling in a vacuum
But I can't forget so I call your name
I can see right through it all
Yet I can't escape the sirens song
Making sure they never will
But who am I to tell right from wrong?

It's safe to say that I can't tell
There's the moment when all senses fail
Searching for the golden trail

Is there light at the end at all?
How will I know when I get too far?
I am searching for the golden trail
