		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When did your name change from a word to a charm?
No other sound makes the hair stand up on the back of my arm
All of the letters push to the front of my mouth
And saying your name is somewhere between a prayer and a shout
And I can't get it out

When did your name change from language to magic?
I'd write it again on the back of my hand,
And I know it sounds tragic

It feels like a drug
And I can't get enough
And it fits like a glove
I'm addicted to your love
(I'm addicted to your love)
I'm addicted to your love
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your love

Now that your name
Pumps like the blood in my veins
Pulse through my body, igniting my mind
It's like MDNA and that's OK

It feels like a drug
And I can't get enough
And it fits like a glove
I'm addicted to your love
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your love
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your love

I need this exchange
I don't care if you think that I'm strange
Something happens to me when I hear your voice
Something happens to me and I have no choice

I need to hear your name
Everything feels so strange
I'm ready to take this chance
I need to dance

It feels like a drug
And I can't get enough
And it fits like a glove
I'm addicted to your love
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your love
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your love
MDNA, MDNA, MDNA, MDNA (I'm addicted)
MDNA, MDNA, MDNA, MDNA (I'm addicted)
MDNA, MDNA, MDNA, MDNA (I'm addicted)
MDNA, MDNA, MDNA, MDNA (I'm addicted)
MDNA, MDNA, MDNA, MDNA (I'm addicted)
