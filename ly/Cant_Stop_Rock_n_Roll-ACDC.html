		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Yeah
Don't you give me no line
Better run if you can
Just like a thorn in my side
So don't give me no
Don't you give me no
Don't you give me no
Don't you give me no
Lies

You can't stop rock n roll
You can't stop rock n roll

Don't you play me no jive
A bit of fun on my side
Too much clap make you blind
So don't give me no

Don't you give me no
Don't you give me no
Don't you give me no lies

You can't stop rock n roll
You can't stop rock n roll
You can't stop rock n roll
You can't stop rock n roll

I said, ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah

Oh yeah
I said you can't stop rock n roll
You can't stop rock n roll
You can't stop rock n roll
You can't stop rock n roll

Listen everybody say

Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah

You can't stop rock n roll
You can't stop rock n roll

I said you can't stop rock n roll
You can't stop rock n roll
