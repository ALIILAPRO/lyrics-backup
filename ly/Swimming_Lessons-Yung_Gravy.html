		<p>
		  It's Gravy, baby
When I hit your lady, she started singin' (in this bitch with Jason Rich)
Singin' like

Oh, goddamn, oh, goddamn
Shawty singin' while I slam, like
Ooh, alakazam
Oh, goddamn, oh, goddamn
Gravy clap like it's my hands, ayy
Hit her with that dick, now she sing like Stevie Nicks
Hit her with that sauce, turned her to Diana Ross, yeah
Ooh, round of applause, yeah
Shawty saw my ice and sang like Barbra Streisand

Gravy could teach you to sing (sing)
Gravy could teach you to fly (fly)
Gravy could teach you to ball (ball)
Gravy could teach you to ride (ride)
Your mother taught me to sing (and fuck)
When I was only a child (a child)
Shawty picked me up from school
Went to the crib and I clapped cheeks
Oh, what a feeling
Goddamn, shawty is singin'
That sound good, I must be hittin' it
That sound nice, she can make millions
Goodness gracious, I'ma make music
I'ma go crazy, I'ma get to it
Your mom taught me, now I'm fluent
Hear that voice every time I do it

Oh, goddamn, oh, goddamn
Shawty singin' while I slam, like
Ooh, alakazam
Oh, goddamn, oh, goddamn
Gravy clap like it's my hands, ayy
Hit her with that dick, now she sing like Stevie Nicks
Hit her with that sauce, turned her to Diana Ross, yeah
Ooh, round of applause, yeah
Shawty saw my ice and sang like Barbra Streisand

When I pull up on your mama, tryna get a singin' lesson
But I always be forgettin' that I always be finessin'
All she really ever do is give me swimmin' lessons
I be swimmin' all up in that ass from seven to eleven
And you know I hit the breaststroke, get the best stroke
So pull up on a kid, mama, let's go
Ooh, ayy, let me add some Gravy sauce
I lay the pipe, fool
I stay in that ass
Gravy a goddamn blast, blast
Yeah, a blast from the past
I clap on that ass, I clap on it fast
My foot on the gas, yeah, I smash then I smash
She picked me up from class, all I speak is ass
It's Gravy train, baby, talkin' ass, ass, ass
