		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  September's here again
Every insecurity reminds you
Who's at the helm?
Darker times
With fear in the eyes
Who's the man in charge?

Invented isolation
Alone and safe inside
Struggle with words,
That make sense in time
Yet waiting for someone to enter say "I have a better plan"

Never have to worry
For all that we know
The truth be told
As we lay down low
Walking the thin line
Let the happiness in
For now it's fine

We're living the lie

When light breaks
Another way to matter
All questions somehow answered
When life comes crushing
At the early break of day
We've only come so far

Never have to worry
For all that we know
The truth be told
As we lay down low
Walking the thin line
Let the happiness in
For now it's fine
We're living the lie
