		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It gets dangerous
Nobody’s blameless
And we can’t hide 
From what we are, 
Who we were
What makes us

No need for saving us
Nobody’s shameless
There’s no time 
For looking back 
Losing out 
to things on paper

We’re turning tables
Been feeling aimless
But there’s still time
For moving up
Moving out
It won’t phase us

You could try and
Do your worst
But you know I’m stuck 
By your side
No matter what or
Where we end up, 

You could try and
Do your worst
But you know I’m stuck 
By your side
No matter what or
Where we end up, 

You could try and
Do your worst
But you know I’m stuck 
By your side
No matter what or
Where we end up, 

You could try and
Do your worst
But you know I’m stuck 
By your side
No matter what or
Where we end up, 

If it was flavourless
Know where this takes us
Well there’s no life
In holding on
Where’s it gone?
When we wake up

No need for labels
What people make of us
Coz there’s still time
For moving up 
Looking down
On things that break us
