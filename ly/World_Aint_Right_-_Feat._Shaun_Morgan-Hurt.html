		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The world just ain?t right, 
It keeps me up at night,
A good man paralyzed; He?s everything to me
Hell, what else could he be?

He payed for all we?d do,
He payed for all we?d get;
Let?s try not to forget, 
If it hasn?t happened yet.

A gambler pays his dues,
A gambler pays his debts,
Placed on a bet;
A brand new red Corvette, 
But he just lost Juliet.

He payed for all he?d do,
He payed for all he get;
And how can I forget,
When it hasn?t happened yet?

Would you show me the meaning of love,
So it doesn?t affect me much?
(With) what you?d do unto us,
I never expected all my hopes and dreams,
To fall apart at the seams,
To all fall apart at the seams?

The kindest man I knew,
The kindest man I?d soon;
Was tied to a machine,
The kind that makes you breathe?

So could you show me the meaning of love,
?Cause it doesn?t affect me much?
What you?d do unto us,
(I) never expected all my hopes and dreams,
To fall apart at the seams,
To all fall apart at the seams?

World that just ain?t right,
(that) keeps me up at night,
I try to be satisfied;
But I?m still in love with you,
And it?s not like you want me to.
