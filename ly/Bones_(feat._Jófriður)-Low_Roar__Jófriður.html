		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  First of March, it's clear to me
There's something that's uncomforting
Your body has a way with me
But I'm exactly where I wanna be
But I'm a long way from home

I know your voice, I know your face
This is something I cannot replace
Give me hope and give me doubt
Well I loved you then but I don't love you now
I'm a long way from home

'Cause we're a long way from home

No listen now, don't walk away
I've got nothing more to say
Can you see it in my dying face
You're acting like I care
Now is there anything that I can do
If there was would we be singing
'Cause, you're a part of me and I'm a part of you
'Cause, you're a part of me and I'm a part of you
'Cause, you're a part of me and I'm a part of you
'Cause, you're a part of me and I'm a part of you
