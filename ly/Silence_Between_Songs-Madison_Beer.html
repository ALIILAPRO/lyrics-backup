		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You wanna know, the demons in my head
But you don't know, they're sleeping in your bed
I pop a pill to try and numb the pain
When it's just me and my brain
I medicate, that's what you made me do
My broken heart, and dreams in baby blue
The music fades and then I think of you

Oh, I never knew
That the silence between songs (songs)
Could ever be so lonely and so low
'Til I lost you

It's killing me, I know it's killing you
The violins are playing out of tune
I never sleep, just naked in my room

Oh, I never knew
That the silence between songs
Could ever be so lonely and so low
'Til I lost you

'Cause I can't be alone
With my thoughts
When the music stops
No, I can't turn it down
Tune them out
Don't know how

Oh, I never knew
That the silence between songs (songs)
Could ever be so lonely and so low
So listen close to the silence after this song
