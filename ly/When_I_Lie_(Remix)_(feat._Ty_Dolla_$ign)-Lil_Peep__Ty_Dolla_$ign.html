		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Many men have tried to save her but all they do is try (all they do is try)
Woke up on a lonely day, she can't help but wonder why (but wonder why)
I saw it on her face, she wanna make those fuckers cry (those fuckers cry)
She ends up in a better place and time when she get high

Stick that needle in my eye, just lost my peace of mind (peace of mind)
Stick that needle in my eye
Stick that needle in my eye, just lost my peace of mind (peace of mind)
I'm not evil by design, but I feel dead at times
Stick that needle in my eye, just lost my peace of mind (peace of mind)
I'm not evil by design, but I feel dead at times

All that drip up in my Faygo
In my city I got say-so
I was just talking to Fredo
Then I woke up, it was gone
All my friends are really dead
Still hear their voices in my head
These days it's hard to sleep alone
I beg, my baby please don't go
Please don't go
I can handle my rivals, but can't fight these demons alone
Please don't go
All these fakes, all these snakes in the grass, gotta keep it cut low
Keep the circle small, stand tall, do it all
Praying I don't fall, know they'd rather see me long gone

Stick that needle in my eye, just lost my peace of mind (peace of mind)
I'm not evil by design, but I feel dead at times (dead at times)
Stick that needle in my eye, just lost my peace of mind (peace of mind)
I'm not evil by design, but I feel dead at times

Stick that needle in my eye, just lost my peace of mind (peace of mind)
Stick that needle in my eye
When I lie
Cuts me when I lie
When I lie
