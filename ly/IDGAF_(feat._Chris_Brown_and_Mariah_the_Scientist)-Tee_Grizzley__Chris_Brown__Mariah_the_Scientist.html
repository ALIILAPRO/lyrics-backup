		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's up, though, what you on?
I'm 'bout to pull up on you right quick
(The Melody)
Oh, you got a man? Fuck that got to do with me?
Come outside right quick
(DJ on the beat, so it's a banger)

Is you up right now?
What you on right now? (Mwah)
Is you drunk right now? (She say?)
But you know I got a man (haha)
I don't care right now (I don't give a fuck)
Pull your hair right now (come here)
Tryna beat it right now (she like)
But you know I got a man 
I don't give a fuck (I don't)
But you know I got a man (I'm sorry)
I don't give a fuck (I don't)
Don't you understand? (I don't)
I don't give a fuck
But you know I got a man (ain't got shit to do with me)
I don't give a fuck
Don't you understand? Yeah (for real)

Sound good, why you answering then? (Why you ignoring me?)
Come here, let me smack it again
I heard you, you got a man
You love that nigga, you ain't gotta tell me again
I'm just tryna link and be nasty again
Dick in your back, call me daddy again
Ain't 'bout to keep playin', I'm really that nigga
You keep bullshittin', I'm grabbin' your friend
But damn, I can't keep my mind off of you
Two shots of that Clase Azul
I'm ready to fool
Remember your favorite hotel, I remember your favorite position
Let's go get a room
You in a relationship now?
C'mon my baby, I know you, that ain't even you
You know I'm in tune
Let's go and get freaky, what you got to lose, my baby?

Is you up right now? (Yeah)
What you on right now? (Mwah)
Is you drunk right now? (She say?)
But you know I got a man (haha)
I don't care right now (I don't give a fuck)
Pull your hair right now (come here)
Tryna beat it right now (she like)
But you know I got a man 
I don't give a fuck (I don't)
But you know I got a man (I'm sorry)
I don't give a fuck (I don't)
Don't you understand? (Nah)
I don't give a fuck
But you know I got a man (ain't got shit to with me)
I don't give a fuck
Don't you understand? (For real)

Got a girl at home, but you calling me
You know I'm taken baby, I don't creep
Won't even pick up, 'cause you should know better
Than to think that we could be together
Fuckin' right
You know I got a man, and he fucks me right
No reason to complain, hope we fuck tonight
And even if we can't, still won't make you mine
You wasting my time

Is you up right now?
What you on right now? (Mwah)
Is you drunk right now? (What she say?)
But you know I got a man (ha)
I don't care right now (I don't give a fuck)
Pull your hair right now (come here)
Tryna beat it right now (she like)
But you know I got a man 
I don't give a fuck (I don't)
But you know I got a man (I'm sorry)
I don't give a fuck (I don't)
Don't you understand? (Nah)
I don't give a fuck
But you know I got a man (ain't got shit to do with me)
I don't give a fuck
Don't you understand, yeah? (For real)

Say you want me
That means nothing
I can't stay
What can I say, what can I say?
