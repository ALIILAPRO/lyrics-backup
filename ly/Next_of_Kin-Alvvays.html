		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We walked along the rocks for nearly an hour
I caught the way you looked at me in the sunlight
You took something before you went in the shower
To help suppress the things that make you feel uptight

If I'd known you couldn't swim
We would never have gone in

I left my love in the river
The only one who sees
I lost his hand in the current
It was the life I wanted and I'd hoped for
And now I am left sifting through the leaves

The sun so hot, I saw his skin through his t-shirt
The grass so tall, we knew we wouldn't be found
We climbed into the stream, sure no one would be heard
And in no time at all, there wasn't a sound

If I'd known you couldn't swim
We would never have gone in

I left my love in the river
The only one who sees
I lost his hand in the current
It was the life I wanted and I'd hoped for
And now I am left sifting through the leaves

No color to his skin
Inform the next of kin
No color to his skin

I left my love in the river
The only one I see
I left his hand in the current
And now I am left blowing through the trees

Ooh
Ooh
