		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Play with fire get your fingers burnt
But when you got
When you got nowhere to turn
Oh, don't go to strangers
My darling, come to me

So when you hear that call
To follow your heart
You'll follow your heart, I know
I've been through it all, see babe, yeah
I'm a old hand
So, I understand yeah, I under, I under
I understand if you go

Build your dreams to the stars above
But when you need, need someone to love
Don't go to strangers my darling, come to me

So when you hear that call
You gotta follow your heart
You'll follow your heart, I know
(I know, I I I) i've been through it all
(See babe) and I'm an old hand
And I'll understand if you go
(Oh oo oh oo oh)

Don't make it your mark
For your friends to see, ye-eah, play me
But when you need, when you need
When you need company
Don't go, go to strangers, my darling
Come to me

Come to me, ye-eah
