		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Looking for forgiveness
I ran into your madness
Shutting off my brain just to spite my heart

You're slithering, slithering, slithering into my heart yea
You're changing, changing my, changing my, changing my mind yea
I'm shedding, I'm shedding, I'm shedding, I'm shedding my snakeskin
You're wearing it, wearing it, wearing it every day yea

Buy my expensive, exclusive, pain wear
My fine couture is your branded repayment
I tear my soul into two so that you can
Pretend despair

Like a snakeskin, like a snakeskin
Like a snakeskin, like a snakeskin
Like a snakeskin
Like a snakeskin
Wear me out and tear me down like

Rip, rip, rip, rip, rip, rip
I'll tear you down like
Strip, strip, strip, strip, strip, strip
So run before I
Bit, bit, bit, bit, bit, bit
And make you all
Addicted, addicted
Addicted to my snakeskin
Rip, rip, rip, rip, rip, rip
I'll tear you down like
Strip, strip, strip, strip, strip, strip
So run before I
Bit, bit, bit, bit, bit, bit
And make you all
Addicted, addicted
Addicted to my snakeskin

Buy my expensive, exclusive, pain wear
My fine couture is your branded repayment
I tear my soul into two so that you can
Pretend despair

Like a snakeskin, like a snakeskin
Like a snakeskin, like a snakeskin
Like a snakeskin
Like a snakeskin
Wear me out and tear me down like
