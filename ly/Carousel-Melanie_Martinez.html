		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Round and round like a horse on a carousel, we go
Will I catch up to love? I can never tell, I know
Chasing after you is like a fairytale, but I
Feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel

Come, come one, come all
You must be this tall
To ride this ride at the carnival

Oh, come, take my hand
And run though playland
So high, too high at the carnival

And it's all fun and games
'Til somebody falls in love
But you already bought a ticket
And there's no turning back now

Round and round like a horse on a carousel, we go
Will I catch up to love? I can never tell, I know
Chasing after you is like a fairytale, but I
Feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel

This horse is too slow
We're always this close
Almost, almost, we're a freakshow

Right, right when I'm near
It's like you disappear
Where'd you go? Mister Houdini, you're a freakshow

And it's all fun and games
'Til somebody falls in love
But you already bought a ticket
And there's no turning back now

Round and round like a horse on a carousel, we go
Will I catch up to love? I can never tell, I know
Chasing after you is like a fairytale, but I
Feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel

Why did you steal my cotton candy heart?
You threw it in this damn coin slot
And now I'm stuck, I'm stuck
Riding, riding, riding

Round and round like a horse on a carousel, we go
Will I catch up to love? I can never tell, I know
Chasing after you is like a fairytale, but I
Feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel
