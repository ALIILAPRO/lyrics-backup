		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Stay alive

Stay alive

I have never seen the General so despondent
I have taken over writing all his correspondence
Congress writes, "George, attack the British forces"
I shoot back, we have resorted to eating our horses
Local merchants deny us equipment, assistance
They only take British money, so sing a song of sixpence

The cavalry's not coming

But, sir

Alex, listen
There's only one way for us to win this
Provoke outrage, outright

That's right

Don't engage, strike by night
Remain relentless 'til their troops take flight

Make it impossible to justify the cost of the fight

Outrun

Outrun

Outlast

Outlast

Hit 'em quick, get out fast

Chick-a-plao

Stay alive 'til this horror show is past
We're gonna fly a lot of flags half-mast

Raise a glass

I go back to New York and my apprenticeship

I ask for French aid, I pray that France has sent a ship

I stay at work with Hamilton
We write essays against slavery
And every day's a test of our camaraderie
And bravery

We cut supply lines, we steal contraband
We pick and choose our battles and places to take a stand
And ev'ry day
Sir, entrust me with a command
And ev'ry day

No

He dismisses me out of hand

Instead of me (stay alive)
He promotes
Charles Lee
Makes him second-in-command 

I'm a General
Whee

Yeah
He's not the choice I would have gone with

He shits the bed at the Battle of Monmouth

Ev'ryone attack

Retreat

Attack

Retreat

What are you doing, Lee? 
Get back on your feet

But there's so many of them

I'm sorry, is this not your speed?
Hamilton

Ready, sir
Have Lafayette take the lead

Yes, sir

A thousand soldiers die in a hundred degree heat

As we snatch a stalemate from the jaws of defeat

Charles Lee was left behind
Without a pot to piss in
He started sayin' this to anybody who would listen

Washington cannot be left alone to his devices
Indecisive, from crisis to crisis
The best thing he can do for the revolution
Is turn n' go back to plantin' tobacco in Mount Vernon

Ooh

Don't do a thing
History will prove him wrong

But, sir

We have a war to fight, let's move along

Strong words from Lee, someone oughta hold him to it

I can't disobey direct orders

Then I'll do it
Alexander, you're the closest friend I've got

Laurens, do not throw away your shot
