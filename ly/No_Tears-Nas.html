		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A little gun case
You was younger then
Another violent crime around album number ten, uh
Since a baby, baby, baby
Baby, ghetto, baby
You a ghetto, ghetto baby
You a ghetto baby, the QB crazy
You a ghetto baby, you had the records playin'
You's a ghetto baby, fallin' while you skatin'
Sneakers hangin', just a life of a ghetto baby

Shhh
Dear older me
You grown to be
The one to coach the team, uh
You still be on your fly shit
Part spiritually psychic
You walk through the Hayes like Isaac
And maybe this gen will see what you and Hit done
If they don't call it how it is, that's a big dub, uh
That big age you rap
You did your big one
My favorite ever from you gotta be this one

Got through the scars, every one
Cops drew down on you with guns
Close friends, you lost some
No tears on your face, none
You missed time seeing your son
It's hard to find genuine love
Family members in them cuffs
No tears on your face, none
Everything is just what you made it out to be
The world of entertainment got some lessons from your pops
Held it down alone, moms on heavenly watch
The tears on my face just stop

Uh
Dear older me
You became everything you chose to be, huh
Took the wheel and you drove the speed
Out on the road, it took you higher than coca leaves, huh
You at the age you say what it is
You call every girl in your phone like, "Come to the crib"
Ain't gotta hide nothin', what you gotta lie for?
One come through the front, one leavin' out the side door, potential
But what's potential if all amiss in the mental?
And what you been through could mess up now what you into
Got the essentials to murder an instrumental
Made it to Gen Z, deservin' what they extend to you
Talkin' to the younger you
Every stage problems'll still run to you
That big age you rap
You did your big one
My favorite ever from you, I can't even pick one

Got through the scars, every one
Cops drew down on you with guns
Close friends, you lost some
No tears on your face, none
You missed time seeing your son
It's hard to find genuine love
Family members in them cuffs
No tears on your face, none
Everything is just what you made it out to be
The world of entertainment got some lessons from your pops
Held it down alone, moms on heavenly watch
The tears on my face just stop

Talkin' to my younger self
They say in the big 50's
That's when you get rich, rich, rich, rich
In every aspect
You got nothin' to worry about
No tears
