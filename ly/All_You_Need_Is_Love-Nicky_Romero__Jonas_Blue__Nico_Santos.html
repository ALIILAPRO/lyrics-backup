		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see you're lost inside
Devil on your back, pushing angels away
You found the truth in lies
'Cause heaven ain't the place that you thought it would be

Feeling trapped under all of that pressure
Promise you that it's gonna get better
Holding on when you know you should walk away

Save a little piece of your heart
It's okay if you let go
Save a little light in the dark
For the nights when it gets cold
Save a little hope for the days that don't make sense
It's never too late to start again, woah-oh-oh
Save a little piece of your heart
'Cause all you need is love

You see the warning signs
But you're blinded by the love so you're taking the blame
Still tryna change that high
But it's hard to tame a fire when you're fueling the flame

Feeling trapped under all of that pressure
Promise you that it's gonna get better
Holding on when you know you should walk away

Save a little piece of your heart
It's okay if you let go
Save a little light in the dark
For the nights when it gets cold
Save a little hope for the days that don't make sense
It's never too late to start again, woah-oh-oh
Save a little piece of your heart
'Cause all you need is love
'Cause all you need is love
'Cause all you need is love
