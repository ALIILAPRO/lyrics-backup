		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Condemned to violence
Arrested by pain
Inside the soul lies a man insane
Conceived in anger
Addicted to hate
The mutant child of a twisted state

Beware the contradiction
Beneath the crimson void
'Cause in the world of fiction
My Jekyll doesn't hide

A killer's smile with
A psycho star dream
Behind the mask things aren't what they seem
Unholy soldier
Disciple of sin
What kind of mind are you living in

You're preaching revolution
Don't you mean genocide?
Behind this resolution
My Jekyll doesn't hide

Waiting to die for the every first time
All right, that's right
Waiting to die for the every first time
I don't give a damn, 'cause I think it's my time, my time

The symbiosis
Of murder and lies
What do I see looking through your disguise?
Fourth Reich dementia
Subversion ideals
God only knows what your secret conceals

Who'll be the first offender?
Who will be victimized?
In your perverse agenda
My Jekyll doesn't hide
