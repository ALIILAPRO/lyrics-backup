		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Deaf, dumb and blind boy
He's in a quiet vibration land
Strange as it seems, his musical dreams
Ain't quite so bad

Ten years old with thoughts as bold as thoughts can be
Loving life and becoming wise
In simplicity.

Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know

A vague haze of delirium
Creeps up on me
All at once a tall stranger I suddenly see
He's dressed in a silver sparkled
Glittering gown
And his golden beard flows
Nearly down to the ground

Nothing to say, nothing to hear
Nothing to see
Each sensation makes a note
In my symphony

Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know

His eyes are the eyes that
Transmit all they know
Sparkle warm crystalline glances to show
He is your leader
He is your guide
On the amazing journey
Together you'll ride
