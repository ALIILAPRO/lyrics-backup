		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A witness to a darkened afterlife
Severed from reality, dark magic unseen
Unearthly spirits welcome the night
The witness to a darkened afterlife

Spill yourself into the void
The ever-present darkness
Scry to speak with unlife
It's death that will start this
Obsidian mirrors
Summon your darkest fears
(They claw, they scratch)
Death is near

Obsidian mirrors
(Summon your darkest fears)
Blood-red tears
The fabric of life always tears
They claw, they scratch
Death is near

Enraptured in the absence of a life unseen
Forever trapped inside of me
Dark energy, the spirit world can not be unseen
They claw, they scratch
Death just walks with me

I only see death inside myself
These words make it all a living hell

I only see death inside myself
Psychospiritual summoning
Theater of the mind, it's sickening
Supposed speculum brings visions of the past
(Hand in hand with the dead, it will not last)
(Life is the beautiful lie)
Existence is in the suffering
(Life is the beautiful lie)
Existence is in the suffering
It brings us to our knees
Unconscious mind seeks the end of grief
In between the lines, it seeks the end of time
(In between the lines, it seeks the end of time)

Enraptured in the absence of a life unseen
Forever trapped inside of me
Dark energy, the spirit world can not be unseen
They claw, they scratch
Death walks with me

(Necromanteum)
Find us on our darkest night
Trapped in our final fight
(Necromanteum)
