		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been walking through big blue shadows
These last Times,  baby
I've been sitting at the crossroad
Of many lives

I've been where the black Wind blows
Been climbing rocks
But now Iâ€™ m still stuck in here
Well
Between those same old blocks
Well
Baby Baby

I just wanna get lost
Run like hell the desert
Wanna be free like a river
An find myself lost in the Sun
I just wanna get lost
Stop the noise in my head
Wanna be free like a wild bird
And being again
Lost in the Sun

Time is runnin' faster now
Every hour
Baby I try to catch up on the rhythm
But it 's later now

And when woke up this morning baby
I had plans for life
But now I feel like I've nowhere to go,
And
No desire
Well Baby

I just wanna get lost
Run like hell the desert
Wanna be free like a river
An find myself lost in the Sun
I just wanna get lost
Stop the noise in my head
Wanna be free like a wild bird
And being again
Lost in the
Lost in the
Lost in the Sun
Oh Baby I wanna get lost (bis)
Yes
I wanna get lost
Oh Baby I wanna get lost
Lost in the sun  (bis)
