		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't fall down tonight, you're alive and so am I 
Hold on we might hotwire this old car and drive 

Sticks and stones they say but we dont have bones inside our brains 
if bones are the walls between you and I then I feel pretty tempted 
to beat myself with sticks and stones anyway 
I got a ray gun in my bag a treasure map under my hat 
And i'll never miss a headshot or a dotted line 
I've spent way too much time thinkin about dreamin about life 
to miss the point, which is just listen 
cause I've listened for mine
