		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I found you, maybe I'm not 
Lost forever out in the dark
The storm is over, you made it stop
I've come to find you're what I want

So I laugh about it, my tears are dry
No doubt about it, I'll be alright
My past behind me, I'm letting go
And all that I know

It's gonna be better
It's gonna be better
As long as we're together
It's gonna be better
It's gonna be better now

(It's gonna be better now, it's gonna be better now)
(It's gonna be better now, it's gonna be better now)
As long as we're together, it's gonna be better
(It's gonna be better now, it's gonna be better now)
It's gonna be better now
(It's gonna be better now)
It's gonna be better now

Oh, I found you, the storm is over
Oh, I found you, maybe I'm not
Oh, I found you, the storm is over
Oh, I found you, maybe I'm not

I see the future, it's looking bright
I falling to you like paradise
The world looks different inside your eyes
What I was missing is here tonight

So I laugh about it, my tears are dry
No doubt about it, I'll be alright
My past behind me, I'm letting go
And all that I know

It's gonna be better
It's gonna be better
As long as we're together
It's gonna be better
It's gonna be better now

Oh, I found you, the storm is over
Oh, I found you, maybe I'm not
Oh, I found you, the storm is over
Oh, I found you, maybe I'm not

It's gonna be better now
(It's gonna be better now, it's gonna be better now)
(It's gonna be better now, it's gonna be better now)
As long as we're together, it's gonna be better
(It's gonna be better now, it's gonna be better now)
(It's gonna be better now)
It's gonna be better now

(It's gonna be better now, it's gonna be better now)
(It's gonna be better now, it's gonna be better now)
It's gonna be better now
(It's gonna be better now, it's gonna be better now)
Oh, as long as we're together
(It's gonna be better now) 
It's gonna be better now
