		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's something beating here inside my body and it's called a heart
You know how easy it is to tear it apart
If I lend it to you, will you keep it safe for me?
I'll lend it to you, will you treat it tenderly?
There's something beating here inside my body and it's called a heart

There's a sun shining in the sky
But that's not the reason why I'm feeling warm inside
The answer isn't classified, it's my heart
From the moment I started
I tried to be good about it
Yes, I've tried my best
And more or less, I spoke from my heart

There's a lot to be learned
And you learn when your heart gets burned

There's something beating here inside my body and it's called a heart
You know how easy it is to tear it apart
If I lend it to you, will you keep it safe for me?
I'll lend it to you, will you treat it tenderly?
There's something beating here inside my body and it's called a heart

Hearts can never be owned
Hearts only come on loan
If I want it back
I will take it back
I'll take my heart
But I will try my best
And more or less
I will speak from my heart
Yes, I will speak from my heart
Speak from my heart

There's a lot to be learned
And you learn when your heart gets burned

There's a lot to be learned
And you learn when your heart gets burned

There's a lot to be learned
And you learn when your heart gets burned

There's something beating here inside my body and it's called a heart
You know how easy it is to tear it apart
If I lend it to you, will you keep it safe for me?
I'll lend it to you, will you treat it tenderly?
There's something beating here inside my body and it's called a heart

You know how easy it is to tear it apart
