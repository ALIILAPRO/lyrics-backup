		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I gotta make you know (when I get home)
That I'm gon' see you again (see you again)
And again, my Lord
My God, my everything

(Get the bag, King Wonka)

Yeah, whole 'lotta everything (whole 'lotta everything)
Pinky ring look like a wedding ring (yeah)
Ridin' in my McLaren Spider, smokin' on that Mary Jane
F and N no Fendi belt, I put it on your membrane (fah, fah, fah, fah, fah, fah)
My lil' niggas insane (yeah), them lil' niggas loco (crazy)
Glizzlock got ten watches ( watches, yeah)
You better watch your ho, bro (watch her)
Bitch, I'm back to ballin' (ballin'), but trickin' is a no-no (no)
Don't spin with your phone on you, nigga, that's a no-go (no)
I got water on water, tryna hold my breath (yup)
Money talks and it seems to me that these niggas deaf (yup)
This bitch got a fat ass, I ask Glizzlock for some help (yup)
The way I beat that pussy up, I need a championship belt (yup)
I'm tired of waitin' on my killers 'bout to do it myself (yeah)
And if Glizop Klay, then I guess I'm Steph (fah, fah)
Ayy, I been swimmin' through the money all day, gettin' reps
Yeah, they say that life's hard, I'm fascinated with death (uh)
Ayy, I just put this lil' bad bitch back on the shelf
My left wrist look like glass, never touch crystal meth' (uh)
These niggas need to get a badge, niggas twelve as hell (yup)
They be like, "Glizzlock, how you know?" It ain't hard to tell (no)
My lil' nigga tryna slide, Derek Jeter (Derek Jeter, fah)
Pull the trigger, let it sing, Justin Bieber (Justin Bieber, fah)
My name hot, but I still keep that heater (fah, fah, yeah-yeah)
I'm ballin', nigga, sit yo' ass up in them bleachers (sit down)
You know my name, bitch, and I keep some lethal (yeah)
Rap just like Jeepers Creepers, totin' switches like they legal (grrah)
Getting away them leeches (fah), made an M just off of features (yeah)
(I'm a) skinny-ass nigga
But my pockets fat like Peter (Griffin)
Yeah

Uh
G-lock
You dig?

Oh, if you're secured with that
