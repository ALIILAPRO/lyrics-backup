		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mother, tell me
I long to hear the stories
Just like long ago

All these memories
Start to fade before me
I cannot let them go

No, I can't let them go

From the cradle to the grave
It's a fear I can't escape
Who will be my hiding place
When you're gone?

Father, stay here
Don't leave me like the other
Know, I need you so

All you gave me
Father, how you loved me
Treated like your own

Don't ever let me go

From the cradle to the grave
It's a fear I can't escape
Who will be my hiding place
When you're gone?

There's no way to deny
The brevity of life

As time keeps marching on
All we have is lost

As time keeps marching on
All we have is lost

Nothing lasts forever
Nothing stays the same

From the cradle to the grave
It's a fear I can't escape
Who will be my hiding place
When you're gone?

From the cradle to the grave
It's a fear I can't escape
Who will be my hiding place
When you're gone?

How am I to carry on?
How am I to carry on? (as time keeps marching on)
How am I to carry on? (all we have is lost)

Nothing lasts forever
Nothing ever stays the same
