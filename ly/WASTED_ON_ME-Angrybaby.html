		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Build/Pre-Chorus #1
I feel I feel 
That all your love is wasted on me 

I feel I feel 
That all your love is wasted on me 

Verse #1
I'll go where the sun meets my eye
You'll stay underneath the watchful eye 

Chorus #1
I feel I feel 
All your love is wasted on me 

I feel I feel 
You got me beggin' on my knee's

Verse #2
My finger tips have gone cold somebody help
I need some gloves for my soul
I have high hopes
When I open my eyes I'll be back in reality 

Build/Pre-Chorus #2
I feel I feel 
That all your love is wasted on me 

I feel I feel 
That all your love is wasted on me 

I'll go where the sun meets my eye
You'll stay underneath the watchful eye 

Chorus #2
I feel I feel 
All your love is wasted on me 

I feel I feel 
You got me beggin' on my knee's

Bridge
I fell into a dream
I woke up and stayed awhile
Till I close my eyes
I can see you through me now 

Chorus #3
I feel I feel 
All your love is wasted on me 

I feel I feel 
You got me beggin' on my knee's
