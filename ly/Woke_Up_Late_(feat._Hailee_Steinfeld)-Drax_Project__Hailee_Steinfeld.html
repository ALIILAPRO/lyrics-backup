		  Woke up late
Somewhere far away from home
Pockets empty wallet gone
The sun is streaming all on down on my face

Layin' down on someones bed
A girl that I had hardly met
My head is spinnin' like I've been out days

Now you're waking up too
Lying next to me in your room
Not quite used to someone so new
Did ya catch my name, yeah

Wonder how long I slept in
I don't know where the hell I've been
I know that's all right

Last night we met at one
Drank 'til two
Danced 'til four
Walked you home
Awake 'til dawn
Slept 'til noon
And now I want more

I got that taste oh
It's in my mouth 
It's like I had too much last night
It just felt so right
Because of you, now
I could go or I could stay 'cause I
Got nothing planned today
And I know that's all right

Last night we met at one
Drank 'til two
Danced 'til four
Walked you home
Awake 'til dawn
Slept 'til noon 
And now I want more

Why's it so, so easy with the lights down?
Why's it so, so easy when the night's ours?
Why's it so, so easy with the lights down?
Why's it so, so easy yea so, so easy oh

Woke up late
Somewhere far away from home
Pockets empty wallet gone
The sun is streaming all on down on my face
Yeah, last night was fun, let's do it again
We both know we're more than friends
And I know that's alright

Last night we met at one
Drank 'til two (yeah)
Danced 'til four
Walked you home
Awake 'til dawn
Slept 'til noon
And now I want more (more)

Last night we met at one
Drank 'til two
Danced 'til four
I walked you home
Awake 'til dawn
Slept 'til noon
And now I want more

Why's it so, so easy with the lights down?
Why's it so, so easy when the night's ours?
Why's it so, so easy with the lights down?
Why's it so, so easy, yeah, so, so easy

Last night we met at one
Drank 'til two
Danced 'til four
Walked you home
Awake 'til dawn
Slept 'til noon
And now I want more
