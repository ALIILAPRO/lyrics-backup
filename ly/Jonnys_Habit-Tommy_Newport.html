		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The bodies in the hallway
Everyone is waiting on a call
And Jonny’s on the highway
Pushing 180 in his car

But who’s to say 
He brought his gun
Who’s to say he was having fun
Who’s to say

And who’s to say
He was having fun
Who’s to say he brought his gun
Who’s to say

Jonny’s habit
So glad that I don’t have it
You’ve got Jonny’s habit
You’ve got Jonny’s habit

The undertaker walks in
Boy was he left with quite a shock
As he pulled back on the curtains
Staring back at him was God

But who’s to say 
It’s said and done
What we see and what we want
Who’s to say

Who’s to say
I’m having fun
Do you feel like the chosen one
Who’s to say

Jonny’s habit
So glad that I don’t have it
You’ve got Jonny’s habit
You’ve got Jonny’s habit
