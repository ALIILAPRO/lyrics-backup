		  Open, now let me see the way you work it.
Let me see you work it.
Just lay down. You've got me right here where I need it.
I'll hold out just as long as you. Don't worry, we are
We're weak in the knees and I can't take this.
Heat stroke, our burning bodies melt away. Just work it, I've been
I've been waiting, I've been craving away. I need this.
I will hold out just as long as you.
(Tonight is the night we sink wishes deep into our skin.)

Don't hold back,
Hold nothing back tonight.
Oh, well let it take control
Fusing you to me.

Are you nervous? Spending your days away in space, thicker than air.
We've been waiting, we've been craving away. We need this.
I'll hold out just as long as you.
(Tonight is the night we examine ourselves. This is sick.)

Don't hold back,
Hold nothing back tonight.
Oh, well let it take control
Fusing you to me.

Stop.

Work. Just let this work.
Just let it take control, fusing you to me.

Open, now let me see the way you work it.
Come on and take control right now.
