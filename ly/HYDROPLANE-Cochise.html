		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We ain't take no hand outs from no niggas (no)
It was just, me and my niggas, an-, and we all had God, like
And niggas always be like, they don't give niggas no credit
It's okay, though
It's okay
(Yo' Cochise, a weh dem a say?)

Yeah (huh, yeah)
(Huh, yeah) yeah
He thought we was playin', boy, it's up? (Boy, what's up, huh?)
We not with the playin', keep it tucked (keep it tucked, yeah)
Keep a cool five hunnid in the truck (yeah)
Caught me on my chest (yeah), Patty on my left (yeah)
We was in the West (yeah), now, I'm in the Mest (yeah)
Brand new Vivienne's (yeah), but I ride the best (yeah)
Huh, I'm like, "Nigga, who you testin'?"
Big stepper (yeah), I'm like, "Nigga, who you testin'?"
Nigga wanna try me, we gon' pull up with the weapons (ah)
Countin' all this money, while I'm countin' all my blessings (ah)
Hatin' on yo' shawty, we gon' bring her in a Westin
I don't know, I ain't with the questions (ah)
Baby, I'ma teach you, I'ma show that girl like lesson
Pull up on that nigga, I'm like, "Nigga, who you pressin'?"
Uh-uh, ah, oh, wow
Ha (yeah), why they all on me? (Yeah) why these niggas green? (Yeah)
Had to pray again (yeah), thought it was a dream (yeah)
Bad bih', got some titties, think they double D's
Gap teeth, Edd n'Eddy, bae, I'm double D (teeth)
He said he was with the action, but he fled the scene
Askin' me what happened, all of a sudden actin', Mr. Bean
He said he was packin', grab a napkin, wipe his sleeve (sleeve)
She like, "Do you love me?", I'm like, "Baby, what that means?"
She meanin', uh, what she meanin'?
She starts talkin', uh, I start leavin'
I'm not sorry, 'cause he sleepin'

Why these niggas so damn mean to me?
Why these niggas so damn mean to me?
Why these niggas so damn mean to me?
