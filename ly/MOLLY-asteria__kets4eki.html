		  (Put your hands up)
(Yeah, put your hands up)
(If you up in this party, popping molly, put your hands)
(If you up in this party, popping molly, put your hands)
(If you up in this party, popping molly, put your hands)
(If you up in this party, popping molly, put your ha ha hands)
If you up in this party, popping molly, put your hands up
If you up in this party, popping molly, put your hands up
Got a new bitch on me, I'm not sorry, fuck her mans up
Got new bitches on me, we not sorry, we don't give a fuck
Way too fucked up in the club, we not giving up
Boring bitches have no fun, yeah, we live it up
If you up in this party, popping molly, put your hands up
If you up in this party, popping molly, put your hands up
Bitch, I pulled up to the club and I'm tweaking off some molly
All these fuckers trying to test me, bro, you better test my money
Molly, percies and some acid, bitch, I'm moving like a zombie
Can't feel shit, I'm not alright, I'm so crunk about to vomit
Life never been alright, I don't think its gon' be better
And I'm drowning in these drugs, everyday I feel like dying
Can't trust no one, shits so bad, y'all so fake, you're trying to use me
And one day I'll disappear, and I'm sure i wont be missed
Won't be missed, wo, wo, won't be, won't be missed
When I walk inside the club, I look so fucking fabulous
Everybody tell me tone it down, they just can't handle this
At all, at all
If you up in this party, popping molly, put your hands up
If you up in this party, popping molly, put your hands up
Got a new bitch on me, I'm not sorry, fuck her mans up
Got new bitches on me, we not sorry, we don't give a fuck
Way too fucked up in the club, we not giving up
Boring bitches have no fun, yeah, we live it up
If you up in this party, popping molly, put your hands up
If you up in this party, popping molly, put your hands-
Not a fan, uh, turn her to a dancer
Wheres your manners, think I know the answer
Cut your anger, I tell her drop her pants, yeah
I make bank, yeah, let's go cop a drink, yeah yeah
If you up in this party, popping molly, put your hands up
If you up in this party, popping molly, put your hands up
Got a new bitch on me, I'm not sorry, fuck her mans up
Got new bitches on me, we not sorry, we don't give a fuck
Way too fucked up in the club, we not giving up
Boring bitches have no fun, yeah, we live it up
If you up in this party, popping molly, put your hands up
If you up in this party, popping molly, put your hands up
