		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well I've heard those city singers singin' 'bout how they can love
Deeper than the oceans, higher than the stars above
Well I come from the country and I know I ain't seen it all
But I heard that ocean's salty and the stars they sometimes fall
And that would not do justice to the way I feel for you
So I had to sing this song about all the things I knew

My love is deeper than the holler, stronger than the rivers
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December
And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill
And longer than the song of a whippoorwill

From the back roads to the Broadway shows with a million miles between
There's at least a million love songs that people love to sing
And everyone is different and everyone's the same
And this is just another way of sayin' the same thing

My love is deeper than the holler, stronger than the rivers
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December
And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill
And longer than the song of a whippoorwill

My love is deeper than the holler, stronger than the rivers
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December
And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill
And longer than the song of a whippoorwill
A whippoorwill
