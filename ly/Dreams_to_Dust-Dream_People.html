		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Keep those dreams that you had
Visit rooms you forgot 
Remember how you were
Oh so happy in love
Comes a time so confusing
Dreams just turn to dust
All the stars in the silver sky
Just fold into nothing

It's ok if you want to be young again
Time's on your side
You may be older
But what's a number down the line?
You know, it's easy to change convictions along the way
Just go out and hear what young people 
Have to say 

Who says it's your fault?
If horses stop on running wild
It's just not the same
Who says it's your fault
I see my life and all the days
As a carousel
The days just keep on running wild
Until you find innocent love
The days just keep on running wild
So don't waste time
Keep on hanging
