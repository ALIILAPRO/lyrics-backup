		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Will I ever love the same way again? (Way again)
Will I ever love somebody like the way I did you?
Never thought you'd be so damn hard to replace
I swear I don't mean to be this way
If I can't have you, is love completely off the table?
Do I sit this one out and wait for the next life? (Next life)
Am I too cold? Am I not nice?
Might not be quite yet healed already
Should I be goin' too steady? (Too steady)
But I just wanna know is love completely off the table?

Will you be there? (Will you be there?)
Can I still love you? (Can I, can I?)
Not yet healed already (not ready)
Should I be goin' too steady? (Too steady)
Just wanna know is love completely off the table?

I'll wait for you
Even though it always feels like I'll be number two
To someone you can't hold anymore
If you let me in, I'm ready to give you what I couldn't before
'Cause I got you, girl
Let me help you through it
You're tryna fill the void with a couple boys
I can see right through it (you can see right through it)
I can love you harder than I did before
Was in a dark place back then
I was toxic, then I was toxic to someone else
I was haunted by the hills (oh yeah, yeah)
I couldn't give you my all, but I will
If you let me in your arms
If you let me in your heart
I don't think that love's completely off the table

Will you be there? (Yes, I will be there for you)
Can I still love you? (Yes, I been hurt before, before)
Not yet healed already (not ready)
Should I be going too steady? (Too steady, no, no)
Just wanna know is love completely off the table?

So can you hold me?
If I let you, can you prove it to me? (I wanna know)
'Cause I need you to calm me down, babe
Gotta get out of my head (oh, whoa)
Tryna be healed from this pain (oh)
Just wanna know, just wanna know, know, know, baby (hey)

Can you touch like you believe in it, baby?
Let me think you never gonna leave on me, baby
'Cause I ain't her and you ain't him, thankfully (baby, don't leave)
But it's gon' be hard to let someone else in again (whoa)
Baby, baby (woo-hoo)

Will you be there? (Will you be there? I'll still wait, I'll still wait for you, baby)
Can I still? (oh, no-no, no)
Not yet healed already (not ready)
Should I going too steady? (no, no, no)
Just wanna know is love completely off the table, baby?

I swear, I swear
I will wait for you whenever you need
Ooh, ooh
