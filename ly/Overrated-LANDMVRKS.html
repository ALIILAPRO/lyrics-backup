		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time to watch it burn!

There's something wrong in me
Ain't got another chance
I never wanted this

I'm screaming on the inside, about to suffocate
The smoke is getting thick

I don't know why I wasted so much time

This life is overrated, I try to find my way back to (you)
You make things complicated
So lost and isolated, I found you trembling in my room
Is this so hard to make it through?

Trying to find a way
the fire is getting higher
I'm starting to run out of air and my tongue is bitter
It will not be my grave
I've got another feeling
I can see shadows on the walls
Everything is fading

It'll no longer be the place we used to know and
The man I used to be

This place is trying to drag me down
I'm gonna watch it burn

This life is overrated, I try to find my way back to (you)
You make things complicated
So lost and isolated, I found you trembling in my room
Is this so hard to make it through?

Cause everything has to change but stories stay the same.

Spray it all with kerosene
Up in smoke, I can feel my body smothering

Spray it all with kerosene
Up in smoke it won't DRAG ME DOWN

I don't feel the pain at all
No the fire won't DRAG ME DOWN

Spray it all with kerosene
Up in smoke, I can feel my body smothering

This life is overrated
I try to find my way back to
This life is overrated
I found you trembling in my room

I see the flames and my tongue is bitter
It's no longer the place we used to know
