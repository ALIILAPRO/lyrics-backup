		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's hard to tell these days in which ways that we're falling
I'm not sure anymore what's right or what is wrong
It hurts to feel, to think, to know I may be nothing
But then again I've been wrong before

I've opened up my eyes
Just to wish that I'd stayed blind

Blacken out the sky
And let the arrows fly
It's never over
Not 'til it's over

Outside looking in
When do the nightmares end?
Over and over
Until it's over
The End

It's hard to fathom just how fast we all are spinning
It's hard to know that there's a heaven beyond hell
It burns a hole right through my soul to think it's ending
But then again (then again), I've been right right before

I've opened up my eyes
Just to find out you're all blind

Blacken out the sky
And let the arrows fly
It's never over
Not 'til it's over

Outside looking in
When do the nightmares end
Over and over
Until it's over

Make a wish
Say a prayer
Hope that someone is out there
Build a bridge to Babylon
Then burn it to the ground

Make a wish
Say a prayer
Hope that someone is out there
Build a bridge to Babylon
Then burn it to the ground
(Burn it to the ground)

Burn it to the ground
(Burn it to the ground)
Burn it to the ground
(Burn it to the ground)
Build a bridge to Babylon
Then burn it, burn it, burn it down

Blacken out the sky
And let the arrows fly
It's never over
Not 'til it's over

Outside looking in
When do the nightmares end
Over and over
Until it's over

Just start it over
Until it's over
Over and over
The end
The end
