		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Old Parker: Hey, can we talk? Parker: Na
I don't really wanna talk right now
Old Parker: That's okay, you
Never really did
I've been screaming every day
"Please let me out!" parker: Hold up
Let you out? You couldn't protect
Yourself I was protecting you
Old Parker: You were protecting me?!
Parker: Yes protecting you, everybody in
This world was rejecting you
Nobody out here could accept you
Old Parker: No, everyone could
Except you that's
The problem that you have man, you build
Walls up and hid behind the shame and
I guess that I'm partially to blame
I don't know what to say
Parker: Don't explain! You're making
No sense to me
It kind of all just sounds like a guess to me
Old Parker: Bro, your trauma made
Me just a memory
Ain't nobody in this world remembers me
Parker: So you wanted them to hurt you?
Old Parker: Man that's not what I'm saying
Parker: Well you basically are
Every time that you
Told me I took it too far
And your ex left you cause
You're way too emotional
Old Parker: Man I did what
I was supposed to do
Parker: No you didn't! The world
Made you hit your limit
And then I got distant that's what I'm tryna
Tell you but you just won't listen
Old Parker: What I'm tryna tell you is
We're both broken, My heart's open
Yours is closing parker: I don't give a damn
If my heart is frozen!
Old Parker: You don't wanna be yourself?
Parker: I had to free myself
Because it just kept happening!
Old Parker: Go see a therapist
Instead of just rappening
Or it'll just keep happening!
Parker: You don't think I ever
Get tired of maskin' it?!
Old Parker: I don't care if you do
Cause the more that you are
Means the more that I'm vanishingand I
Really just want myself back again
