		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look in the mirror and tell me
Just what you see
What have the years of your life
Taught you to be
Innocence dyin' in so many ways
Things that you dream of are lost
Lost in the haze

Hold on, baby, hold on
'Cause it's closer than you think
And you're standing on the brink
Hold on, baby, hold on
'Cause there's something on the way
Your tomorrow's not the same as today

Don't you recall what you felt
When you weren't alone
Someone who stood by your side
A face you have known
Where do you run when it's too much to bear
Who do you turn to in need
When nobody's there

Hold on, baby, hold on
'Cause it's closer than you think
And you're standing on the brink
Hold on, baby, hold on
'Cause there's something on the way
Your tomorrow's not the same as today

Outside your door he is waiting
Waiting for you
Sooner or later you know
He's got to get through
No hesitation and no holding back
Let it all go and you'll know
You're on the right track

Hold on, baby, hold on (hold on to me baby)
'Cause it's closer than you think
And you're standing on the brink
Hold on, baby, hold on (yeah I need you by my side)
'Cause there's something on the way
Your tomorrow's not the same

Hold on, baby, hold on (I got talk to you baby)
'Cause it's closer than you think
And you're standing on the brink
Hold on, baby, hold on (there's something on the corner)
'Cause there's something on the way
Your tomorrow's not the same as today
Hold on
