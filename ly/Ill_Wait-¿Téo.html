		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Faded by your hair, smoke reveals
Language rarely says how it feels
Strangers always find something new
Foolish but we make it

Still on you, gripping me
Fiending for your body
So I hide away
'Cause still I'm glued to your movement
Your movement

Diamonds on your flesh
Pray with me
Wonder who will be next, say it with

Say my name pick my brain
Make it a heartbeat
I could never waste a sweet escape
Say my name feel my pain

Either way I'll wait
'Cause still I'm glued to your movement
Your movement
Either way I'll wait
'Cause still I'm glued to your movement
Your movement
Either way I'll wait
'Cause still I'm glued to your movement
Your movement
Either way I'll wait
'Cause still I'm glued to your movement
Your movement, yeah
