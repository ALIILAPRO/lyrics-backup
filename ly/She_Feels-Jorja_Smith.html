		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know it feels good to know
I know she feels good to know
Years goin' fast, a memory
Come back when I feel alone
I've been on fire, but I woke up
I still can't look for me 'cause it's all burned down to dust now
Said you'd look for me when you woke up
And you can't say a thing when it's gone now
Guess she don't have love for me no more

They think that they know me here
But I know you'd know why I haven't quite been myself for years
Could I say you've
Been holdin' back these same tears
Or should I worry that you're someone that I've never known, never known?

'Cause I love to see you in all these places
'Round these familiar faces
I hope you good for favours
Would you remember me?
Will it ever be us goin' back to basics?
I'm tired of all the fake shit
Seen all your sides, your phases

You know it feels good to know
I know she feels good to know
Years goin' fast, a memory
Come back when I feel alone
I've been on fire, but I woke up
I said can't look for me 'cause it's all burned down to dust now
Said you'd look for me when you woke up
And you can't say a thing when it's gone now
Guess she don't have love for me no more

Did I mix up my words?
You don't get what I said
No, it wasn't workin'
It wasn't worth it
No, I know I've done my best
I know I tried and you loved it
What have you done for me?
Where are we now?
What have you done? Oh

'Cause I love to see you in all these places
'Round these familiar faces
I hope you're good for favours
Would you remember me?
Will it ever be us goin' back to basics?
I'm tired of all the fake shit
Seen all your sides, your phases

You know it feels good to know (you know it feels good)
I know she feels good to know (it feels good)
Years goin' fast, a memory (years are goin' fast)
Come back when I feel alone (yeah, yeah)
I've been on fire, but I woke up
I said can't look for me 'cause it's all burned down to dust now
Said you'd look for me when you woke up
And you can't say a thing when it's gone now
Guess she don't have love for me no more
