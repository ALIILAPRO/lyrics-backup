		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As a child I was given the gift to entertain you
But through blood I inherited a life that could destroy you
I drink all day, I smoke all day, I took Madonna's breath away
I've done it all but tap the vein
These hard lines and sunken cheeks are text book reasons
All these Christians come alive and try to sell you

My soul for a goat
Yet I'll outlive the old

You know it's bad, some may say sad a hangover is inspiration
Like a junkie I hurt for it, a bad trip, the emptiness
I never sleep or always sleep, a lack of fulfillment to me 
Is me the big picture
These hard lines and sunken cheeks
Are part of what the Christians mean
To immortalize my situation

My soul for a goat
Yet I'll outlive the old

Simply to thy ghost I cling (simply to thy ghost I cling)
Simply to thy ghost I reject (simply to thy ghost I reject)
Simply to thy ghost I give spit (simply to thy ghost I give spit)
Simply to thy ghost I cling (simply to thy ghost I cling)
Simply I reject (I reject)

Tempter, tempting, tempt me, molest me
You know that I'll submit
For this is my weakness and it saves me from relationships
With those Christians you know they'll sell you

My soul for a goat
Yet I'll outlive the old
