		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remix, Jonell (uh, uh)
Def Jam, Method Man (uh, uh)
(Yeah, yeah) How High

All the game that you was spittin', you know that you was trippin'
Never thought to see me dippin' but I had to get missin' (yeah)
I'm tired of you stressin' me (what?), Why don't you let it be?
Comin' around testin'me, fuckin' wit me mentally

Goodbye, don't want to see your face no more
So long, pack your bags want you out the door
'Cause every time that I play this raw game
Time and time again it's gonna rain
It's gonna rain, it's gonna rain, it's gonna rain

Oh shit, there you go again, flippin' on me (uh huh)
One minute we the shit, next minute you shittin' on me
So what's the problem, huh?
No wait, let me guess, you need some space
And some place to get a load off your chest
No better yet, you don't get enough attention at home
And when I'm gone, I don't even think to pick up the phone
I'm dead wrong, now your fed up, packin' my stuff, fuckin' my head up
And I see it in your face right now you wish I shut up

I really don't know what you came here for
Round and around we go
I'm sending your bags outside the door
Round and around we go
I really don't know what you came here for
Round and around we go
I'm sending your bags outside the door
Round and around we go (one time)

If you don't understand where I'm comin' from (yeah, yeah)
Then my heart is tellin' me you're not the one
All the games you played and I realized
You're not the one for me no more so baby bye-bye
Pack yo' bags and get to steppin' (yo)
You got to let it go, you need to stop trippin'
I hope you don't think I'ma let you back in
'Cause you's a fool

I really don't know what you came here for
Round and around we go
I'm sending your bags outside the door
Round and around we go
I really don't know what you came here for
Round and around we go
I'm sending your bags outside the door
Round and around we go

Don't waste your time
You fool me once but not a second time
Now it's time for you to go away
I packed your things nothing else for us to say
But bye

I was gutter when ya met me, gutter when ya left me
Gutter when ya came back, face it nothin' can change that
Not romance nor marriage counselling
You drop the ball, now I'm bouncin'
Find me a room, burn up an ounce in
Waitin' for my baby to call, forgive it all
On some break-up-to-make-up shit, givin' me draws
I adore mi amor, but every time she choose to go to war
I'm lookin' at the front door

Today I made up my mind to get away
Every day, I sit and pray, every day, every day
Today I made up my mind to get away
Every day, I sit and pray, every day, every day

I really don't know what you came here for (what?)
Round and around we go (Jonell)
I'm sending your bags outside the door
Round and around we go
I really don't know what you came here for
Round and around we go (yeah)
I'm sending your bags outside the door
Round and around we go

I really don't know what you came here for (today I'm gonna take a little time)
Round and around we go (to get away)
I'm sending your bags outside the door (every day, I sit and pray)
Round and around we go (every day)

Round, we go inside out (Jeff Jeff on the guitar, what?)
Round and around we go 
We go back and forth
We go round and round (remix)
Round and around we go
