		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna be immortal
Like a God in the sky
I wanna be a silk flower
Like I'm never gonna die
I wanna live forever
Forever in your heart
And we'll always be together
From the end to the start

That's what we do it for
To reserve a place
It's just another part of the human race
That's what we do it for
To reserve a space
In history, it's just
Part of the human race, race
(Race, race, race, race, race, race)

I'm forever chasing after time
But everybody dies, dies
If I could buy forever at a price
I would buy it twice, twice
But if the earth ends in fire
And the seas are frozen in time
There'll be just one survivor
The memory that I was yours
And you were mine
Everybody dies, dies
Chasing after time, time

When you love somebody
They'll always leave too soon
But a memory, a memory
Can make a flower bloom
We wanna be remembered
Don't wanna live in vain
But nothing lasts forever
This world is in a losing game

I wanna mean something to somebody else
Feel a significance in the real world
It's not enough to live out a lucky life

I'm forever chasing after time
But everybody dies, dies
If I could buy forever at a price
I would buy it twice, twice
But if the earth ends in fire
And the seas are frozen in time
There'll be just one survivor
The memory that I was yours
And you were mine
Everybody dies, dies
Chasing after time, time

No I don't wanna be afraid,
Afraid to die, die, die
I just wanna be able to say
That I have lived my life, life
Oh, all the things that humans do
To leave behind a little proof
But the only thing that doesn't die is love, love, love
Love, love

I'm forever chasing after time
But everybody dies, dies
If I could buy forever at a price
I would buy it twice, twice
But if the earth ends in fire
And the seas are frozen in time
There'll be just one survivor
The memories of our lifetime
Everybody dies, dies
Chasing after time, time

So keep me alive
So keep me alive
So keep me alive, alive
