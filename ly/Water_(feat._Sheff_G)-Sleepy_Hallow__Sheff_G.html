		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like water
Look
(Great John on the beat, by the way)
Look, look

Wanna know the sauce and how we drip like water?
Beat it up, know how to make she drip like water
Say she love my style and my fragrance, huh, let's vacation
Take you where it's sanctioned, tell me the location
Wanna know the sauce and how we drip like water?
Beat it up, know how to make she drip like water
Say she love my style and my fragrance, huh, let's vacation
Take you where it's sanctioned, tell me the location

I could make her drip, huh, like water
Fuckin' up a couple commas, I remember they ain't want us
Now we them niggas make it lit, huh, know I smell like marijuana
Chopper on me for the drama 'cause I ain't really with the ra-ra
Hit her once, then tell her bye, my life so televised
You ain't got a gun, then you might die
Told shorty, "We should fuck now, I don't know how long I'ma be alive"
Said she wanna be my boo thing, but them new things, I don't wanna try
I know I be havin' mood swings, if you move stink, I'ma slide

Wanna know the sauce and how we drip like water?
Beat it up, know how to make she drip like water
Say she love my style and my fragrance, huh, let's vacation
Take you where it's sanctioned, tell me the location
Wanna know the sauce and how we drip like water?
Beat it up, know how to make she drip like water
Say she love my style and my fragrance, huh, let's vacation
Take you where it's sanctioned, tell me the location

I could teach you how to sauce it, don't move with caution
You ain't tryna give it up, I ain't really tryna force it
Winners Circle, run it up, make them other niggas forfeit
Grab a bottle, bust it up, tell bro, "Watch where you pourin' shit"
We don't really give no fucks
If you lack, then you outta luck
Let me fuck, she can't get enough
Boy, I'm strapped, we ain't tryna talk
Want breesh, you could keep love
(If you like, then you outta luck
Let me fuck, she can't get enough
Boy, I'm strapped, we ain't tryna talk
Want breesh, you could keep love)

Wanna know the sauce and how we drip like water?
Beat it up, know how to make she drip like water
Say she love my style and my fragrance, huh, let's vacation
Take you where it's sanctioned, tell me the location
Wanna know the sauce and how we drip like water?
Beat it up, know how to make she drip like water
Say she love my style and my fragrance, huh, let's vacation
Take you where it's sanctioned, tell me the location
