		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Paint on a caution wind
'Neath the bleeding sky
I called your name
There was no one there
And in the cold and snow
I saw your face

And we sang our song for the little thing
Magic calm, but the joy you bring 
Running it down the line
Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing
Magic calm from a pretty thing
Maybe it might be time
For a better day
For a better day
For a better day

Straight, from the path of love
In the road of life
I tumble forward
But I'm going on
I'ma keep it strong
I saw your face

And we sang our song for the little thing
Magic calm, but the joy you bring
Running it down the line
Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing
Magic calm from a pretty thing
Maybe it might be time
For a better day
For a better day
For a better day
For a better day
For a better day
For a better day

And we sang our song for the little thing
Magic calm, but the joy you bring
Running it down the line
Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing
Magic calm from a pretty thing
Maybe it might be time
For a better day
