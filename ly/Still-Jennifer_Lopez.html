		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I sleep
I have dreams about the way we used to kiss
About the way you used to hold me
And say nothing would ever harm me
When we first met
Oh, how you charmed me
Made me smile when I was down
Big pimping around the town (you and me)
Whenever they'd see you (they'd see me)
A lover and a friend to me you were how did it end
How it hurts
To not have you in my life
When I wanted to be your wife

You never know what you have
'Til it's gone, treated you wrong
For so long, now you're gone away
But the love still lives here (still)

I still got love for you (still)
After all we've been through (still)
I gave my heart to you
And baby you're the only one (the only one)

There's other men than you (still)
They can come close to you (still)
Once I said I love you
I knew you'd be the only one

A good man you were to me
Always there to care
Would do anything in this world for me
Didn't matter, what, when, or where
(You were there)
I never thought we'd part
From the arguments we'd start
When I just wanted to get some attention (sorry)
And I'm sorry baby for bitching (if I could)
Take back the words
That I said to make you leave
I'd be down on bended knees
Asking you to please forgive me

You never know what you have
'Til it's gone, treated you wrong
For so long, now you're gone away
But the love still lives here (still)

I still got love for you (still)
After all we've been through (still)
I gave my heart to you
And baby you're the only one (the only one)

There's other men than you (still)
They can come close to you (still)
Once I said I love you
I knew you'd be the only one

All of the good times we had together (together)
Do they mean something to you
Do you ever wish we never split ('cause I)
Still got love for you (still)

I still got love for you (still)
After all we've been through (still)
I gave my heart to you (gave my heart to you)
And baby you're the only one (the only one)

There's other men than you (still)
They can come close to you (still)
Once I said I love you
I knew you'd be the only one (still)

I still got love for you (still)
After all we've been through (still)
I gave my heart to you
And baby you're the only one (the only one)

There's other men than you (still)
They can come close to you (still)
Once I said I love you
I knew you'd be the only one
