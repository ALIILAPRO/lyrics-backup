		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you aching for the blade?
That's okay
We're insured
Are you aching for the grave?
That's okay
We're insured

We're getting away with it
All messed up
Getting away with it
All messed up
That's the living

Daniel's saving Grace
She's out in deep water
Hope he's a good swimmer

Daniel plays his ace
Deep inside his temple
He knows how to surf her

We're getting away with it
All messed up
Getting away with it
All messed up
That's the living

Daniel drinks his weight
Drinks like Richard Burton
Dance like John Travolta, now

Daniel's saving Grace
He was all but drowning
Now they live like dolphins

Getting away with it
All messed up
Getting away with it
All messed up
That's the living
Getting away with it
Getting away with it
Getting away with it
That's the living
That's the living
