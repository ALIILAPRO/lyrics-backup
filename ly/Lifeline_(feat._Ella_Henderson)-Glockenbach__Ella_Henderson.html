		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll be your lifeline, I'll be your ride-or-die
Baby, believe me, I'll be there if you need me

Lookin' at me like you seen a ghost
Down on your knees, you're losin' control, oh-oh
Thinkin' that you could use someone close
Baby, believe me, I'll be there if you need me

When you're down in the dumps and you're needin' a friend
Just call out my name, yeah, call on me, babe
I will come, pick you up, I'll be your SOS
So darlin', don't forget

I'll be your lifeline, I'll be your ride-or-die
Baby, believe me, I'll be there if you need me
I'll be your lifeline, the one you can call at night
Baby, believe me, I'll be there if you need me

(Ey, ey, ey)
(Ey, ey, ey) I'll be there if you need me
(Ey, ey, ey)
(Ey, ey, ey) Baby, believe me, I'll be there if you need me

When you're alone and you feel afraid
I'll be the road that helps you escape, oh-oh
I'll take the wheel, that's the deal
Baby, believe me, I'll be there if you need me

I'll be your lifeline, I'll be your ride-or-die
Baby, believe me, I'll be there if you need me (ooh)
I'll be your lifeline, the one you can call at night
Baby, believe me, I'll be there if you need me

(Ey, ey, ey)
(Ey, ey, ey) I'll be there if you need me
(Ey, ey, ey)
(Ey, ey, ey) Baby, believe me, I'll be there if you need me

I see the warning signs, I got you three-six-five
Call on me, call on me, call me when you need me, babe
I know your head's a mess, I hear your SOS
Call on me and I'll be right there (oh)

I'll be your lifeline, I'll be your ride-or-die (oh-oh)
Baby, believe me, I'll be there if you need me (oh-oh, oh-oh)
I'll be your lifeline, the one you can call at night
Baby, believe me, I'll be there if you need me

(Ey, ey, ey) Yeah, I'll be your lifeline
(Ey, ey, ey) The one you can call at night
(Ey, ey, ey) Yeah, I'll be your lifeline
(Ey, ey, ey) I'll be there if you need me
