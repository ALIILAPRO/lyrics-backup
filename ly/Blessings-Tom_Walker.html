		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I'll be going out tonight
We could go to yours
You could come to mine
I got no money for the pub, no
Could probably scrape enough for the bus though, yeah

And what a time to be alive
Four bottles down my neck and I'm feeling fine
So let's hear it for the good times
Let's hear it for the good times

And counting our blessings
But it don't take us too long
'Cause our lives ain't like a movie
Or a Katy Perry song
And counting our blessings
'Cause we got friends to lean on
Got no money in our pockets
We're too busy getting drunk
We're counting our, just counting our blessings
Just counting our, just counting our blessings

Well, I really hate to kill the vibe
But who's going to the shop
We could use supplies
I'm busy playing FIFA
You won't know I'm gonna beat ya'

And what a time to be alive
Fat Freddy's on the Drop on Spotify
So let's hear it for the good times
Let's hear it for the good times

And counting our blessings
But it don't take us too long
'Cause our lives ain't like a movie
Or a Katy Perry song
And counting our blessings
'Cause we got friends to lean on
Got no money in our pockets
We're too busy getting drunk
We're counting our

And when the night is over
Lay your head upon my shoulders
Glad I'm coming down with you
'Cause nothing really matters
As long as you're right here

Been counting our blessings
'Cause our lives ain't like a movie
Or a Katy Perry song
And counting our blessings
'Cause we got friends to lean on
Got no money in our pockets
We're too busy getting drunk
We're counting our, just counting our blessings
Just counting our, we're counting our blessings
We're counting our blessings
Just counting our blessings
Counting our, counting our blessings
Counting our blessings
