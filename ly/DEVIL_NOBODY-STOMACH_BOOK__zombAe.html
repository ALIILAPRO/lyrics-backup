		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Blood sticks to the lips, muddy and homesick
And i don't care a bit, I hate to admit
Empty vessel and rocket in the clip
I'm only looking forward to a trip

I won't shed a tear anywhere but here
I cover up my eyes and try to disappear
Devils misbehaving lead us to a grave
We hold our hands up and we drift away

She's apathy, apathy
I won't let it get to me, get to me
Can't you see, all i really wanna be
Is just your angel folding at the knees
She's apathy, apathy
I won't let it get to me, get to me
Can't you see, all i really wanna be
Your little devil nobody

So, please

Where the opp i left his
Body up on elephant hill i killed your dog
I'm looking furry i'm cruella deville
Its funny how well duffel
Bags envelop the steel
Shoot a rapper put his
Album through development hell
Im in niggas pockets just like jerry heller
Niggas don't want war, imma helter skelter
He be silent but he writing to
Cops he penn and teller
Bout to show a nigga exactly just
How these fucking shells work
Choppa gone disable a pussy nigga autonomy
Bitch I run this shit you
Could call me young deutoronamy
You ain't got no bread boy
You starving in this economy
Smoked him way too much now
I'm fucking up the ecology
Stealing all your shit and I'll
Never ask for apologies
It's over bitch I'm hearing the
Olly Olly with Oxen Free
How you keeping all of them chains on
It's obliviously you ain't got a team
Snobby he ain't acknowledge we rocking
This just like socrates
I wanna rock right now
I wanna rock right now
I wanna rock right now
I wanna rock right now
I wanna rock right now
I wanna rock right now
I wanna rock right now
I wanna rock right now
I wanna rock right now
I wanna rock right now

She's apathy, apathy
I won't let it get to me, get to me
Can't you see, ll i really wanna be
Is just your angel folding at the knees
She's apathy, apathy
I won't let it get to me, get to me
Can't you see, all i really wanna be
Your little devil nobody

So, please! So, please!
