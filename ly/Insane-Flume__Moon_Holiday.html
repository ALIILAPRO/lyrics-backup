		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't have to be afraid
You don't even have to be brave
Living in a gilded cage

The only risk is that you'll go
Go, Go
Insane
Go, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh, go, go, insane
Go, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Go
Go insane
And go
Go insane
And go
Go insane
And go, go, go, go insane
And go

Your mind is on track
For games we play these days
With every parth we take
You know your safe, safe, safe
The only risk is that you'll go insane
The only risk is that you'll go insane

And go
Go insane
And go, go, go
Go insane
And go
Go insane
And go, go, go
Go insane
Go insane
Go insane
Go insane
And go, go, go
Go insane
