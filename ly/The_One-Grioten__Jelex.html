		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl, I gotta tell you how much I love you
From zero to a hundred
Baby we can make it I trust you
We don't even need another break
Don't know how much I miss you
But yea you always gonna catch me when I'm down and alone
Am I the fool?
Got me feeling in some type of way
Fake friends fuck them
I don't even have to say
You're the savior to the broken
Yea my only helping hand
We can always be together
Baby give me one more chance aye
Girl, I gotta tell you how much I love you
From zero to a hundred
Baby we can make it I trust you
We don't even need another break
Don't know how much I miss you
But yea you always gonna catch me when I'm down and alone
Am I the fool?
Got me feeling in some type of way
Fake friends fuck them
I don't even have to say
You're the savior to the broken
Yea my only helping hand
We can always be together
Baby give me one more chance aye
Girl I'm doing all this shit for you
Girl you know I'm here for you
If I were to love you
I would give my everything to you
Let me take you out to dinner
Baby, you've been looking thinner
Bitch you spicy like a sinner
I just want to be the winner to your heart
Like Rick, never gonna give you up
Bitch I love you 3000, when you be texting me "what's up?"
Got me rolling my eyes, I never felt a butterfly
Guess I never fell in love till I saw you the first time
Baby you're like the goddess of love
People be looking in shock
Like an angel fell from heaven
Tell me wassup
Life is full of adventures
And you should always take the risk
Or else you're never gonna know
When you're gonna get that kiss
No tricks
Baby we can meet up at 9 
Sitting on floor look up at the stars tonight
Wish time would stop 
We stay in the spot 
I just wanna be with you 
To the end of the lot
Hey baby girl I know that you are shy
When we texting eye to eye, I feel like you are my type
I just wanna be looking at you like a mother fucking statue
What the fuck, I just want to be the one that you love
We've been texting all night, I'm feeling bubbly and shit
Yeah your house is never empty, cause I'm coming in it
I'm a little bit annoying, so I hope that's not a problem
Cause I really wanna fuck you and not deal with all the drama
Girl, I gotta tell you how much I love you
From zero to a hundred
Baby we can make it I trust you
We don't even need another break
Don't know how much I miss you
But yea you always gonna catch me when I'm down and alone
Am I the fool?
Got me feeling in some type of way
Fake friends fuck them
I don't even have to say
You're the savior to the broken
Yea my only helping hand
We can always be together
Baby give me one more chance aye
Girl, I gotta tell you how much I love you
From zero to a hundred
Baby we can make it I trust you
We don't even need another break
Don't know how much I miss you
But yea you always gonna catch me when I'm down and alone
Am I the fool?
Got me feeling in some type of way
Fake friends fuck them
I don't even have to say
You're the savior to the broken
Yea my only helping hand
We can always be together
Baby give me one more chance aye
