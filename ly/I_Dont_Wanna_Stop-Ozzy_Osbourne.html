		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know what they're talking about
I'm making my own decisions
This thing that I found
Ain't gonna bring me down
I'm like a junkie without an addiction

Mama, don't cry
I just wanna say hi
Like playing with danger and fear
Everybody's walking, but nobody's talking
It looks a lot better from here

All my life I've been over the top
I don't know what I'm doing
All I know is I don't wanna stop
All fired up, I'm gonna go till I drop
You're either in or in the way
Don't make me, I don't wanna stop

Why don't they ever listen to me?
It's just a one-way conversation
Nothing they say is gonna set me free
Don't need no mental masturbation

Too many religions but only one God
I don't need another savior
Don't try to change my mind
You know I'm one of a kind
Ain't gonna change my bad behavior

All my life I've been over the top
I don't know what I'm doing
All I know is I don't wanna stop
All fired up, I'm gonna go till I drop
You're either in or in the way
Don't make me, I don't wanna stop

All my life I've been over the top
I don't know what I'm doing
All I know is I don't wanna stop
All fired up, I'm gonna go till I drop
You're either in or in the way
Don't make me, I don't wanna stop

Are you in there?
I don't wanna stop
Are you ever going to stop?
I don't wanna stop
I don't wanna stop
Are you in there?
I don't wanna stop
I don't wanna stop
Are you ever going to stop?
I don't wanna stop

All my life I've been over the top
I don't know what I'm doing
All I know is I don't wanna stop
All fired up, I'm gonna go till I drop
You're either in or in the way
Don't make me, I don't wanna stop

All my life I've been over the top
I don't know what I'm doing
All I know is I don't wanna stop
All fired up, I'm gonna go till I drop
You're either in or in the way
Don't make me, I don't wanna stop
