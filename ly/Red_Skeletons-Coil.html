		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love you too with all my heart and soul.

- Are you with me or not?
- I don't know.
- I don't want you to drop out in the open.
- Then how am I supposed to do that?
- Softly. If you listen to me if you listen to me...
- Mmm.
- Just drop out.

- I'm asking you...
- I don't want to do any more favours for you. Look, it's over.
- Please. Please. I'm asking you, I'm asking you as a favour. Yes? I've been a very good friend to you.
- Really!
- Yes, I have.
- Like hell I do. Like hell I do.
- Yes?

???... I didn't show up, show up ...???... Ah, no, hang on ...???... No, I'm serious. ...???... (laughter) ...??? (some of this speech seems to be reversed)

I love you too with all my heart and soul.

- Look, I'm not having you saying that of me again next week. I'll reorganise the issue
- Look, do you want to have a continuative relationship with me or not?
- No.
