		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's all I read
She's all the literature that I'll ever need
She's poetry
But she's like the good kind that doesn't make me sleep

Her eyes are porn and she knows it
Won't shut her eyelids 'til she gets invited
We're not keeping score, but she's winnin'
Likes it when I'm singin', as long as it's for her

Daydreams, they feel like livin' when I'm dreamin' about her
She's all I breathe when I should be breathin' air
She knows I'm weak, yeah I
Daydream every day about the things we do at night

She likes the word, "Please"
But not the polite kind, the one in the sheets
She knows she's a tease
She's here for a good time then she's gonna leave

She'll start a war and she knows it
Won't stop her fighting 'til my flag is rising
We're not keeping score, but she's winnin'
Likes it when I'm singin', as long as it's for her

Daydreams, they feel like livin' when I'm dreamin' about her
She's all I breathe when I should be breathin' air
She knows I'm weak, yeah I
Daydream every day about the things we do at night

Daydreams, they feel like livin' when I'm dreamin' about her
She's all I breathe when I should be breathin' air
She knows I'm weak, yeah I
Daydream every day about the things we do at night
