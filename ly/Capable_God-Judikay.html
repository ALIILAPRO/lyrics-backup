		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh uh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Capable God o oh oh oh oh oh oh

What can't You do
What won't You do
Nothing impossible
Nothing impossible
What can't You do
What won't You do
Nothing impossible with our God

You do not lie You do not fail
What is hard for You to do
It doesn't exist ohh
It can never ever exist oh
You do not lie You do not fail
What is hard for You to do
It doesn't exist oh
It can never ever exist oh

According to Your knowledge and Your will for me
What You say You have done
I just need to align oh
Because You are not a man that changes Your mind oh
Those that know You will trust in You
Not in horses and chariots
By the arm of flesh
No man can prevail
No man no man no man no man
My confidence is You
What is hard what is hard for You
It can never exist oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

You do not lie You do not fail
What is hard for You to do
It doesn't exist oh
It can never ever exist oh
You do not lie You do not fail
What is hard for You to do
To do ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It can never ever exist oh
Those that know You will trust in You
Not in horses and chariots
By the arm of flesh
No man can prevail

Ask Abraham and Sarah
And the woman with the issue of blood oh
Nothing nothing hard for You-You-You-You
Ask mama Hannah ask mama Hannah oh
Blind Bartimaeus
Make you go ask the Israelites
Absolutely nothing hard for You uuuu
No man no man no man
My confidence is You
What is hard what is hard for You
It can never exist oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

You do not lie You do not lie oh oh oh uhu
You do not fail
What is hard for You to do Jesus
It doesn't exist oh Jesus eh eeei
It can never ever exist oh
Oh uh uh uh uh uh
You do not lie You don't have the ability
You do not fail
What is hard for You to do You don't know how to fail
It doesn't exist oh it is not in Your capacity to fail
It can never ever exist oh
No oh no no no
Capable God oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
It can never ever exist oh
