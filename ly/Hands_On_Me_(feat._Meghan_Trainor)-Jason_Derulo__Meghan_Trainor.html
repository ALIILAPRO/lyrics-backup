		  Baby, put your hands on me
Hey
(Hey) you got that bomb, baby

She was, she was, she was
She was the girl next door, that's my fine ass neighbor (uh-huh)
Told her if she wants some sugar, baby, don't be a stranger (uh-huh)
And she said, "When I need something sweet I'll be comin' over to you" (hey)
That girl was knockin', knockin', knockin' in the middle of the night
Wearin' nothin' but a robe that she took off inside
And she said, "Boy, I'm gettin' cold, here's what I need you to do"

Baby, put your hands on me (on me)
Both hands on me (on me)
Right now (right now), you're the only (you're the only) one I need
So, baby, put your hands on me (on me)
Both hands on me (on me)
When we dance (we dance), put your hands all over me (hey, alright, said)

Been such a long time since I been lucky
Don't have to be shy, say how bad you want me
Come and touch me tenderly (tenderly, hey)
So come and give me that body heat
I want your body heat on me
I can barely sleep
I'm tryna turn up the degrees
With you all over me

So, baby, put your hands on me (on me)
Both hands on me (on me)
Right now (right now), you're the only one I need
So, baby, put your hands on me (on me)
Both hands on me (on me)
When we dance (we dance), put your hands all over me (ooh)

Oh, the night's still young, come and break my heart
Darling, you are the only one I need
No, I won't be afraid, no, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you kiss me before you leave

So, baby, put your hands on me (on me)
Both your hands on me (on me)
Right now (right now), you're the only (you're the only) one I need
So, baby, put your hands on me (on me)
Both hands on me (on me)
When we dance (we dance), put your hands all over me
