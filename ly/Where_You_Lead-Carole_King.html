		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wanting you the way I do
I only wanna be with you
And I would go
To the ends of the earth
'Cause, darling
To me that's what you're worth

Where you lead, I will follow
Anywhere that you tell me to
If you need, you need me to be with you
I will follow where you lead

If you're out on the road
Feeling lonely, and so cold
All you have to do is call my name
And I'll be there on the next train

Where you lead, I will follow
Anywhere that you tell me to
If you need, you need me to be with you
I will follow where you lead

I always wanted a real home with flowers on the window sill
But if you wanna live in New York City, honey, you know I will
(Yes I will, yes I will)
I never thought I could get satisfaction from just one man
But if anyone can keep me happy, you're the one who can

Where you lead, I will follow
Anywhere that you tell me to
If you need, you need me to be with you
I will follow, oh

Where you lead, I will follow
Any-anywhere that you tell me to
If you need, you need me to be with you
I will follow where you lead
Oh baby, ooh

I'm gonna follow where you lead
(I'm gonna follow where you lead)
Oh baby, yeah, yeah
I'm gonna follow where you lead
(I'm gonna follow where you lead)
Ooh, sugar, uh-huh
I'm gonna follow where you lead
(I'm gonna follow where you lead)
Oh baby, yeah
I'm gonna follow where you lead
(I'm gonna follow where you lead)
