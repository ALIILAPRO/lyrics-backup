		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Em, it's Paul
Listen, 
Joel just called me 
And he told me you're in the fuckin' back, behind his studio
Shooting your gun off in the air like it's a shooting range
I told you not to fuckin' bring your gun around
Like an idiot, outside of your home
You're gonna get yourself on trouble
Don't bring your gun outside of your home 
You can't carry it on you
Leave your fuckin' gun at home
