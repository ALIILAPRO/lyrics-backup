		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Settle down
I'm not around
It's hard

Burning ground
It's all around
My heart

But I take what I get n I slow it down so it lasts
I feel when I kneel to the power of my past

Don't take this to heart
Don't take this to
Heart

I smoke until I cave in
Hard luck
I'm choking when I take it
Spit blood
I swear I'll never make it
On god
Cos maybe I'm done waiting

But I take what I get n I slow it down so it lasts
I feel when I kneel to the power of my past

Don't take this to heart
Don't take this to
Heart

Cos I lost what I once loved in you
I'm talking to myself cos you don't wanna
So don't take this to heart

Don't take this to heart

But I take what I get n I slow it down so it lasts
I feel when I kneel to the power of my past

Don't take this to heart
Don't take this to
Heart

Cos I lost what I once loved in you
I'm talking to myself cos you don't wanna
So don't take this to heart

So don't take this to heart
So don't take this to heart

Settle down
I'm not around
It's hard

Burning ground
It's all around
My heart
