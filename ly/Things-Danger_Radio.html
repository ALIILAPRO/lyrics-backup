		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cover it up and keep a distance
The anger that burns inside of me
Will put up with all your flaws and mistakes
Oh, how you take it out on me
Telling yourself that I was wrong here
Believe all the lies he fed to you
Cause girl, if you wanted something sincere
I know that he'll never pull through
Waitin' for the day you turn yourself around

[Chorus]
Can't stop feeling the things I feel
Locked into something so surreal
You have me going crazy
Have it all wrong if you think you can walk out on me

Said you're in love and can't describe it
Has it ever occurred to you
That while you're asleep alone in your bed
He's out all night with someone new
Waitin' for the day you turn yourself around

[Chorus]

Waitin' for the day you turn yourself around

[Chorus: x2]
