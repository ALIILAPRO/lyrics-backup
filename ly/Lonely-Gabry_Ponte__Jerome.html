		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We could turn the darkness into light
You don't have to feel so lonely
Chase away the demons in our minds
We don't have to be so lonely

We want to ignite the stars in the skies
All that we need is just a spark
We could turn the darkness into light
You don't have to feel so lonely

You don't have to feel so lonely

We could turn the darkness into light
You don't have to feel so lonely
Chase away the demons in our minds
We don't have to be so lonely

We want to ignite the stars in the skies
All that we need is just a spark
We could turn the darkness into light
You don't have to feel so lonely

We could turn the darkness into light
You don't have to feel so lonely
Chase away the demons in our minds
We don't have to be so lonely

We want to ignite the stars in the skies
All that we need is just a spark
We could turn the darkness into light
You don't have to feel so lonely

Lonely, lonely
You don't have to feel so lonely
Lonely, lonely
You don't have to feel so lonely

We could turn the darkness into light
You don't have to feel so lonely
Chase away the demons in our minds
We don't have to be so lonely

We want to ignite the stars in the skies
All that we need is just a spark
We could turn the darkness into light
You don't have to feel so lonely
