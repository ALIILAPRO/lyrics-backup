		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I do not remember, where we did meet
Lengthened years have built my mind, memories undeo
Yet with instability one thing stands too clear
Lady perfection, mystery, of whom I shed a tear

Airwoven divinity, mind, soul in victory
Cured of her malady, could this be my lost;
Ligeia

Airwoven divinity, mind, soul in victory
Cured of her malady, could this be my lost;
Ligeia

Sickness fell upon Ligeia, all knew she would die
Midnight came to lay her rest, farewell
Opium dreams, grief-stricken years, I took another bride
Replacing that which I did have, Ligeia why

Airwoven divinity, mind, soul in victory
Cured of her malady, could this be my lost;
Ligeia

Airwoven divinity, mind, soul in victory
Cured of her malady, could this be my lost;
Ligeia

Chronic disease, my luck cursed
My new wife has died

Coming from her bed of death, I thought I heard her cry
Could a corpse cold, stiff, sedate, sob in the bed it lie
Approaching her, I chilled to stone, for it did swiftly rise
I can never be mistaken, there were, they were Ligeia's eyes

Airwoven divinity, mind, soul in victory
Cured of her malady, could this be my lost;
Ligeia

Air woven divinity, tears shed, vitality
Cured of her malady, yet this is my lost;
