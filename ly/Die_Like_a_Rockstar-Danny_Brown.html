		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Brown bless the mic like gesundheit
Bud 'bout the size of a bonsai
Kick it like Muay Thai
Flow like sci-fi in high def
I'm righteous and still bust a nut up on a bitch chest
The verbal folklore been explored
And employed by none other than them fools with the gold (with the gold)

And them bankrolls explode
And your bitch is my target, when I shoot my load
Bulls-eye, my eyes tie-dyed
Fried off the same shit that rockstars died 
From, smoke something with your man bitch
Like Wyclef used to sell the cannabis
Manuscript sick shit, prescription addiction
Sniffing Adderall off the counter in my kitchen
Tripping off the shit that had Brian Wilson flipping
Experiment so much it's a miracle I'm living

And I'ma die like a rockstar
die like a rockstar
I'ma die like a rockstar
die like a rockstar

And I'ma die like a rockstar
die like a rockstar
I'ma die like a rockstar

Bitch I wanna party like Chris Farley
Shot of Hennessy spike that with some Molly
Tell mommy I'm sorry God bless my soul
But life is so sublime going out like Brad Nowell
I got that Kurt Cobain type of mind-frame
Feeling like Keith Moon 'shrooms in my dressing room
Basquiat freestyle
Feeling like Jimi Hendrix in Anna-Nicole mouth
River Phoenix '93 VIP
With some drugged up porn hoes all around me
Like Teri Diver, Linda Wong
All in hell having orgies where the horns grow long
'Cause bitch I'm Frankie Lymon, Heath Ledger
Hyped up in a jacuzzi doing that John Belushi
With Brittany Murphy, we blowing Hershey

I'ma die like a rockstar (rockstar)
