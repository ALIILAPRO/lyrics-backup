		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feeling better now that we're through
Feeling better 'cause I'm over you
I learned my lesson, it left a scar
Now I see how you really are

You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good

I'm gonna say it again
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good

I broke a heart that's gentle and true
Well, I broke a heart over someone like you
I'll beg his forgiveness on bended knee
I wouldn't blame him if he said to me

You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good

I'm gonna say it again
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good

I'm telling you now, baby, and I'm going my way
Forget about you, baby, 'cause I'm leaving to stay

You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good

I'm gonna say it again
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good

Oh, oh, no
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good
