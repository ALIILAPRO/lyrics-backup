		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember the way
You used to love me
I remember the days
You used to love me

You don't appreciate the time
I put into this love affair of ours, baby
I couldn't let you walk around
Thinking it's alright to let me down, I remember

I remember the way
You used to love me (baby, I remember the way)
I remember the days (oh-whoa)
You used to love me

I gave you all my precious love
And anything you wanted from me
You didn't hear me callin' out
Callin' for your warm affection, after all this time

You can't deny what I'm feelin', it's real (ooh, whoa)
And I stood right by your side (stood by your side)
Went through all the hurt and pain
Then you turned and walked away

I remember the way (I remember)
You used to love me (baby, yeah)
I remember the days (ooh)
You used to love me

Oh, remember
Yeah-yeah, ooh
Can't give up on the way you used to give it to me
Give it to me
What a feeling, it's so real

I remember the way (ooh)
You used to love me (baby, you used to love me, yeah-yeah-yeah)
I remember the days
You used to love me (whoa, yeah-yeah-yeah)

You didn't hear me callin' out (didn't hear me)
And that's not what love's about (no, no)
I remember
Used to love me (used to love me everyday)
(Everyday, everyday)
Now your love has gone away
I remember, I remember (baby, I)

I remember the way (I remember)
You used to love me (you used to love me everyday)
I remember the days (do you remember? I remember)
You used to love me (ooh)
I remember the way (the way)
You used to love me (you used to walk holding my hand)
('Cause you used to be my man, I remember)
I remember the days (all the ways)
You used to love me (did you hear me callin' out?)
(And that's not what love's about, oh, I remember)
I remember the way (oh , oh, I)
You used to love me (baby, you used to love me)
I remember the days (I said I remember)
You used to love me
