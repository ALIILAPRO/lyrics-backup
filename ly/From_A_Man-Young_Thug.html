		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I ain't one of the greats, then tell me who it is
I been focusin' on my babies just 'cause they my kids
I done took off all my necklaces, couldn't see the plot twist
Magnificent purposes, you could tell by the Letterman
I'm turned up on medicine
I'm still streamin', pussy nigga, show me a better man
Rolls Royce umbrellas
I done turned to a felon, I done stacked me some cheddar
I done turned my process up, now I gotta perform at Coachella

I had just turned Herm√®s up, now I been rockin' Margiela 
I'm on the block where they gon' wait for you to fail then tell you
I'm spendin' all my racks and they ain't tell me nothin'
All you jewelers tryna rob, and don't you sell me nothin'
Don't your clothes say Celine? You stylin' (Celine)
Your ex been tryna call back, your shit pure crack (woo)
Few billion in plaques (woo), better hide it in the house
You better not let her get no internet 'cause I'll spill on the jack
Don't stand him up beside me
Big dawg told me, "Get the check like Nike"
I think the Tarzan movie was about me
They way I'm movin' in the streets
Real up inside me, got me comin' home nightly
I fell in love with your thongs most likely
A real redbone tryna come wife me
No one night, more like nightly
40K, I'm bein' grown
Man, I'm just tryna steer the song
Black Sky-Dweller, King Kong
Black guy in the world gettin' on, yeah
Black guy can't do wrong
Black guy in his motherfuckin' zone, yeah
Black boy makin' it home
Black boy ain't makin' it home
Tryna reach the crack of dawn, uh
Trappin' in my Reebok, I don't see opp
I'm just tryna get all my re-rock, I don't wanna be opps
Cops pull up, we all flee out like we all feet out
Or gettin' high 'til I don't see y'all, pour two liter
She see her own face and she ain't clear
She don't wanna be herself and just for that I got a fear
I'm endin' off this internet shit like my mirror
This shit ain't passed up none of my ideas, I made me a mill'
I wonder if I ever get off seals and poppin' pills
I don't know, but right now it feels real, this shit real
I'm Dr. Phil, I'm big wheel, I'm king spill
I ever rat it wasn't my years, I'm gettin' killed
I swear I'm gettin' killed (woo)

If I ain't one of the greats, then tell me who it is
I been focusin' on my babies just 'cause they my kids
I done took off all my necklaces, couldn't see the plot twist
Magnificent purposes, you could tell by the Letterman
I'm turned up on medicine
I'm still streamin', pussy nigga, show me a better man
Rolls Royce umbrellas
I done turned to a felon, I done stacked me some cheddar
I done turned my process up, now I gotta perform at Coachella
