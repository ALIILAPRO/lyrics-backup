		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No more patience, when I'm feeling low
On vacation, my mind wants to go
Overthinking when I'm all alone
Out of focus from all the unknown

Can you check for my vitals
Think I need revival
Broken down and fading
My heart keeps breaking

Caught up in the storm
But we're the survivors
Looking out for love
In a little bit of darkness
Hold each other up
When we falling down
Never give it up
Because we are the fighters

Caught up in the storm
But we're the survivors
Looking out for love
In a little bit of darkness
Hold each other up
When we falling down
Never give it up
Because we are the fighters
Fighters, fighters, fighters

Because we are the fighters
Fighters, fighters, fighters

Underwater, swinging my fists
Tension rising, want no part of it
Nice to meet you, been called a misfit
No need to fake it, we all got some shit

Can you check for my vitals
Think I need revival
Broken down and fading
My heart keeps breaking

Caught up in the storm
But we're the survivors
Looking out for love
In a little bit of darkness
Hold each other up
When we falling down
Never give it up
Because we are the fighters

Caught up in the storm
But we're the survivors
Looking out for love
In a little bit of darkness
Hold each other up
When we falling down
Never give it up
Because we are the fighters
Fighters, fighters, fighters

Caught up in the storm
But we're the survivors
Looking out for love
In a little bit of darkness
Hold each other up
When we falling down
Never give it up
Because we are the fighters
