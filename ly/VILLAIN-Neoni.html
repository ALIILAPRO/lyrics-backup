		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lavish sins and sycophants
While we're all out here suffering
Oh wow, your silence it's been getting loud
As you pretend, fake innocence
I'll play my tiny violin, 'cause now
You'll watch me as I burn it to the ground

All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't undo all the damage I did
You call me mad but I make perfect sense
If I can't be your hero
I'll be your villain

I'll be your villain, your v-v-villain
I'll be your villain, your villain
Be your villain, your v-v-villain
I'll be your villain, your villain
Be your villain, your v-v-villain
I'll be your villain, your villain
Be your villain, your v-v-villain
I'll be your villain, your villain

You and I, we're different
I'm more of a blunt instrument
Watch out, mayhem follows me around
Won't make amends, 'cause you did this, yeah
I'm the monster you invented
How could you ever forget me now?

All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't undo all the damage I did
You call me mad but I make perfect sense
If I can't be your hero
I'll be your villain

I'll be your villain, your v-v-villain
I'll be your villain, your villain
Be your villain, your v-v-villain
I'll be your villain, your villain
Be your villain, your v-v-villain
I'll be your villain, your villain
Be your villain, your v-v-villain
I'll be your villain, your villain

All the king's horses and all the king's men
Can't put my sanity together again

I'll be your villain, your v-v-villain
I'll be your villain, your villain
Be your villain, your v-v-villain
I'll be your villain, your villain
Be your villain, your v-v-villain
I'll be your villain, your villain
Be your villain, your v-v-villain
I'll be your villain, your villain
