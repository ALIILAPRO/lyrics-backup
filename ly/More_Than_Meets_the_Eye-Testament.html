		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Life in a world untold, question the unknown
This prison captures me, my cell is all I know
I thought I knew it all, stubborn in my ways
My sentence has begun, my future's what I waste

Next chapter of my life is filled with violent scenes
I stay awake at night hiding from my dreams
The voices haunting me, driving me insane
Can't seem to get away, they're calling out my name
I feel I am slipping
Are they out to get me?
My life is upside down
More than meets the eye

For now, I am in control, choosing my own fate
And now I sleep at night because I'm not afraid
The demons haunting me, I chased them all away
I've conquered all my fears, my destiny awaits

I'm no longer slipping
(I'm not slipping away)
No one is out to get me
(No one will get in my way)
No longer upside down
(I've turned my life around)
More than meets the eye
More than
More than
More than
More than meets the eye
