		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got these vices that keep me locked up inside a craze
Nothing suffices I'm always hoping for rainy days
This day and age medicating's my way to meditate
Premeditate then I kill the bitch on the second date
I've got these vices that keep me locked up inside a craze
Nothing suffices I'm always hoping for rainy days
This day and age medicating's my way to meditate
Premeditate then I kill the bitch on the second date
Love it when they run, he shaking like a drum, he died for fun
Ain't this fuckin' fun you sweet like honey bun
I load my fucking gun I watch him die with delight
Watch him cling to life, hold on tight, kill him twice cus he a
Fuckboy
Fuck I'm feeling right, say goodnight, I got them
Loud toys
He gon' die on sight, not alright, I got that
Loud noise
I made my baby cry, pistol on my side I'd
Die for it
Let em' fuckin die, no I'm not alright
I've got these vices that keep me locked up inside a craze
Nothing suffices I'm always hoping for rainy days
This day and age medicating's my way to meditate
Premeditate then I kill the bitch on the second date
Get your money son, ain't this fuckin' fun
You're sweet like honey bun, I love it when they run
This day and age medicating's my way to meditate
Premeditate then I kill the bitch on the second date
Get your money son, ain't this fuckin' fun
You're sweet like honey bun, I love it when they run
This day and age medicating's my way to meditate
Premeditate then I kill the bitch on the second date
I've got these vices that keep me locked up inside a craze
Nothing suffices I'm always hoping for rainy days
This day and age medicating's my way to meditate
Premeditate then I kill the bitch on the second date
