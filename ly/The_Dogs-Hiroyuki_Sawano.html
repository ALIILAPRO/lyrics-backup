		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  See it on the people's faces everywhere
Black'n'blue but they won't throw the towel in
And let go of a dream
Man, women, child prepare to bleed

Were we born to lose and let goliath win?
Heavy air and screaming as you pull the pin
Our world is collapsing but we can rebuild it
A hundred more years in the fire

Do you believe that we can just kill them all?
Do you believe that we can conquer this?
Can't delete all the mess that I have seen
Fall in the fire but these burns will heal you

Gonna take your knives and skills they must be honed
Show your mom your lives and give a dog a bone
Just wait for centuries
Man, woman, child long to be free

When we die we ask our brothers one more time
If the meaning of our lives was worth a dime
Our world oxidizes but will surprise us
A hundred more years in the fire

Do you believe that we can just kill them all?
Do you believe that we can conquer this?
Can't delete all the mess that I have seen
Fall in the fire but these burns will heal you
Coming down to show you what to do
How to die with honor, dignity
We should delete all the mess out from our sight
What is truth is for me and you

Do you believe that we can just kill them all?
Do you believe that we can conquer this?
Can't delete all the mess that I have seen
Fall in the fire but these burns will heal you
Coming down to show you what to do
How to die with honor, dignity
We should delete all the mess out from our sight
What is truth is for me and you
