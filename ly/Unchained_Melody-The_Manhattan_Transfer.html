		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, my love, my darling
(Yeah)
I hunger for your t-t-touch, ooh
Time goes by so slowly
Yes and time can do so m-m-much
Are you still mine

I need your love
(Need it, need it, need it, need it, need it, need it)
I need your love
(Need it, need it, need it, need it, need it, need it, need it)
Godspeed your love right now
(Yeah, yeah)

Lonely rivers flow to the sea
(Yeah, yeah, flow, flow to, Sea sea look at the sea)
To the open arms
(C'mon pretty baby do you too, yeah yeah)

Of the sea
(Of the sea, sea look at the sea)
Time
(C'mon pretty baby one more time, yeah yeah)

Near the side
(Near the side side, wait for me, me wait for me)
Wait for me
(I'll be comin' home my baby I, yeah yeah)
I'll be comin' home, wait and see
(Be comin' home)

Oh, my love, my darling
(Yeah)
I hunger for your t-t-touch, ooh
Time goes by so slowly
Yes and time can do so m-m-much
Are you still mine

I need your love
(Need it, need it, need it, need it, need it, need it)
I need your love
(Need it, need it, need it, need it, need it, need it, need it)
Godspeed your love right now
(Yeah, yeah)

Oh, my love, my darling
(Yes)
I hunger for your t-t-touch, ooh
T-t-touch, ooh
T-t-touch, ooh

T-t-touch, ooh
T-t-touch, ooh
T-t-touch, ooh
