		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hello darkness what's your name today
I heard you were back in town
I was fearless you had stepped away
But nothing lasts and you're back now
I got rain in my eyes as
Tears fall from the sky
Well,
Nothing means anything,
Now,
The world is upside down

And it's
Too hard to talk about it
Too wild to analyze
She's living in my head now,
And it surely makes me sad

Last night I woke up and I felt alone
There's some piece of my heart that's gone
I say I am a homeless man
Your shadow left my side
The spell is broken and I can see
There's is so much pain now that you're free
Surrounded by castles of rain,
I'm on the tearful train again

And it's
Too hard to talk about it
Too wild to analyze
She's living in a dream now,
And it surely makes me mad

I don't know how to manage me
You took the key
Swam to the sea
Today's the day I hit the floor
Don't think I can fly anymore
You gave me rules I won't forget
That dreams are real, that life's a bet
Music was your life, your land
I say this is your song my friend

And It's
Too hard to talk about it
Too wild to analyze
She's living in a dream now,
And it surely makes me sad
