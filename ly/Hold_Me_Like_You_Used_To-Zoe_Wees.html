		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you feel that cold coming in
That old familiar sting?
When you know they're gone
But you still hold on to the little things
Mama always told me that the ones that leave
They look down on us in golden wings
I wanna believe it
Tell me, do you believe it?

When we lose the ones we love
I was getting used to, used to
Having you with me
So why you gotta leave?
Just hold me like you used to, used to
Are you looking from above?
I didn't wanna lose you, lose you
So why you gotta leave?
Need you here with me
Just hold me like you used to, used to

When I lay awake at night
I feel you close to me
Now you're taken from this world
I hope you can finally breath
Mama always told me that the songs I sing will make you proud
So I'm singing this
So do you hear it?
I wanna believe it

When we lose the ones we love
I was getting used to, used to
Having you with me
So why you gotta leave?
Just hold me like you used to, used to
Are you looking from above?
I didn't wanna lose you, lose you
So why you gotta leave?
Need you here with me
Just hold me like you used to, used to

I just wanna take away, take away
All the pain of yesterday, yesterday
I just wanna feel okay, feel okay
I just wanna be okay

When we lose the ones we love
I was getting used to, used to
Having you with me
So why you gotta leave?
Just hold me like you used to, used to
Are you looking from above?
I didn't wanna lose you, lose you
So why you gotta leave?
Need you here with me
Just hold me like you used to, used to
