		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I told myself long ago
I'm never giving, no, no, I was wrong
Hey woman, you never know
How much I miss you

Wish that you could touch my hand
Just like you did before
I wish that you could call my name
And make me surrender

Wish that you could feel my needs
And know that I long for you
I miss every single thing we used to do

Baby, I surrender, I can't fight it anymore
This war has taken toll, I am out of ammunition
I surrender, now you can have it your way
See, love is everything and what I need to do

If I think I know you well, there is no new lucky man
I see that you're still hurting, it's gonna take time
And so I'm back again just like a brand new man
Tell me what to do, and tell me how to play

I surrender, I can't fight it anymore
This war has taken toll, I am out of ammunition
I surrender, now you can have it your way
Just tell me what to do, tell me how to play

See here at the crossroads, I took you there before
No more to explore, no, no
My life won't be the same if you say you won't remain
That person I still adore

So I surrender, I can't fight it anymore
This war has taken toll out of ammunition
I surrender, have it your way
See, your love is everything and what I need to do

Trust me I'm lonely
I long for you, say I long for you
Now all I wanna do is just live for you babe, yes

I surrender, I can't fight it anymore
This war has taken toll out of ammunition
I surrender, now you can have it your way
Love is everything and what I need to know

I surrender, if only I, if I know I would miss you so much
I, I, I, I, I, surrender
Don't know how much more I can beg to you but
Baby, baby, I, yes

I surrender, now you can have it your way
See, your love is everything and what I need to do
