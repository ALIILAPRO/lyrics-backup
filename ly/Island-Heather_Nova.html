		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, there are parts of me he'll never know
My wild horses and my river beds
And in my throat, voices he'll never hear
He pulls at me like a cherry tree
And I can still move but I don't speak about it
Pretend I'm crazy, pretend I'm dead
He's too scared to hit me now
He'll bring flowers instead

I need an island
Somewhere to sink a stone
I need an island
Somewhere to bury you
Somewhere to go

And the dogwoods shimmer in the October sun
"Oh sweet thing," he sings to me,
"You're the only one."

I need an island
Somewhere to sink a stone
I need an island
Somewhere to bury you
Somewhere

I need an island
Somewhere to sink a stone
I need an island
Somewhere to bury you
Somewhere to go

And I don't know why I can't tell my sister
He spat in my face again
And I don't want to die here
You know that dream when your feet won't move
You want to come but your body won't let you
He steals it from me
He steals it from me
It shines like sweat
Like jewels
Like something that has died too soon
He fucks with the beauty
A kiss, a kick, a kiss, a kick
A kiss kiss kick kick kick
He steals it from me
It's out of my hands again

I need an island
Somewhere to sink a stone
I need an island
Somewhere to bury you
Somewhere

I need an island
Somewhere to sink a stone
I need an island
Somewhere to bury you
Somewhere to go
To go

I need an island
I need an island
I need an island
Somewhere to sink a stone
I need an island
Somewhere to bury you
Somewhere to go
I need an island
Somewhere to sink a stone
I need an island
Somewhere to bury you
Somewhere
I need an island
Somewhere to sink a stone
I need an island
Somewhere to bury you
