		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Devil on my shoulder doesn't understand
We're alone, you know where
Devil on my shoulder doesn't understand
Darkness again
Darkness has come

Devil on my shoulder doesn't understand
We're alone, you know where
I bet I seem fine

You don't love him, you don't love him
You don't love him if you're thinking of me
You don't love him, you're just fucking
You're just fucking, it means nothing to me

You don't love him, you don't love him
You don't love him if you're thinking of me
You don't love him, you're just fucking
You're just fucking, it means nothing to me, yeah

It's been too long, you changed up over time
Why you, why you gonna even try to hide?
It's natural to find someone to treat you right
But it ain't right if you fuck him out of spite
You don't have to cry, girl, let me wipe your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
I promise you will always be mine
Oh-oh, just repeat after me

You don't love him, you don't love him
You don't love him if you're thinking of me (it's all right)
You don't love him, you're just fucking
You're just fucking, you're thinking of me

You don't love him, you don't love him
You don't love him if you're thinking of me
You don't love him, you're just fucking
You're just fucking, it means nothing to me
