		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Panic attack
The backing track
A background hum
For cerebellum
Oh, what a blessing
To meet someone like you
With eyes as dead as mine, it's fine
It's normal people things, just to lie here in silence

Spending days in
Self-medicating
Lost too much weight
Unpleasant aftertaste
We think the same
Play different games
Since I like to refuse, hope you blink before I do
Then pray and pray that you'll go and do it anyway

Hold your breath
I'll make it
Worth the wait
Hold your breath
To your chest
And come back and see me, yeah

You rubbed the makeup off my neck
That I was using to hide the stubble rash
I gave myself whilst shaving
Yes, it's probably a razor thing but, honestly, it's harmless
And I refuse to let the sensitive skin win

Oh, what a blessing
To meet someone like you
With eyes as dead as mine, it's fine
It's normal people things, just to lie here in silence

So, we lie here in silence
Yes, we lie here in silence
Yes, it's normal people things
Just to lie here in silence

Hold your breath
I'll make it
Worth the wait
Hold your breath
To your chest
And come back and see me, yeah
Hold your breath
To your chest
And come back and see me
