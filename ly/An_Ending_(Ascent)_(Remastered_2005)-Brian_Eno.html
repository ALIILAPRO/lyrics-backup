		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Brown eyes and I was tired
We had walked and we had scrambled
Through the moors and through the briars
Through the endless blue meanders
In the blue August moon
(Ooh ooh ooh)
In the cool August moon
(Ooh ooh ooh)
Over the nights and through the fires
We went surging down the wires
Through the towns and on the highways
Through the storms in all their thundering
In the blue August moon
(Ooh ooh ooh)
In the cool August moon
(Ooh ooh ooh)
Then we rested in a desert
Where the bones were white as teeth sunk
And we saw St. Elmo's fire
Splitting ions in the ether
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
In the blue August moon
(Ooh ooh ooh)
In the cool August moon
(Ooh ooh ooh)
In the blue August moon
(Ooh ooh ooh)
In the cool August moon
(Ooh ooh ooh)
