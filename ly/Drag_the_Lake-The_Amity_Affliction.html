		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Kick it

Drag the lake
You won't find me
I've been tempting fate
With my heart beside me

I am the stone below the water
Cold and hard to touch
Just when you think I can't get lower
I turn my back and fuck it up

You can drag the lake
But you won't find me
You can drag the lake
But you won't find me

So come and drag the lake
You see I've done some diving
I have some extra weight
With no one to untie me

I am the stone below the water
Cold and hard to touch
Just when you think I can't get lower
I turn my back and fuck it up

You can drag the lake
But you won't find me
You can drag the lake
But you won't find me

I'll stare into the sun
To burn out what I've done
I'll tear myself apart
To see what I've become
Nothing wrong with my depression
My sick and miserable obsession
If I could only get some space
If I could only learn my lesson
(If I could only learn my lesson)

You can drag the lake
But you won't find me
You can drag the lake
But you won't find me
You can drag the lake
But you won't find me
You can drag the lake
But you won't find me
