		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sippin' it down
Ice cold Adrenochrome
A tastemaker shaping minds
A tropical paradise
Yeah, you're just a puzzle piece
They are the masterminds
So be humble for the puppeteer
You're just a product of the pipeline
Yeah, you best be right on time
Lining up clean in a row
Falling like a domino
Say what you need to say
You better take a side
The information overload
Has got you in the rabbit hole
Now you're a radical
Without a manifesto
This one's for the rubber bullet brunches
Feel the tear gas tickling your throat
All about the algorithmic outrage
Serve it up like cheesecake a la mode
Shiny lights entice your eyes to
Dollar signs in the summer skies
Underneath the sweltering sun
And you'll go blind if you look at them
I'm hoping to buy some new eyes
I want wealth and hellness
I said hey now
We're fighting water with fire
And the
The world's getting hotter
And I said hey now, now
All your landlords and lawyers
They wanna lobby you down 'til you're
Out on the streets
