		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woke up in pain, my head hurt
A vice is my guilty pleasure
The condom still on the dresser
Yeah, on the dresser
We pulled in here right after midnight
I pulled out like some time before nine
And I swear that this was the last time
But it's not the last time

I'm here countin' all my days and
Wake up feelin' jaded
One less conversation
Like nah, nah, nah
My time is runnin' vacant
Woke up in a daze and
Sick of all the changes
Like nah, nah, nah
Like nah, nah, nah

She said, "Come get it right back" (yeah, yeah)
Slow down, don't go too fast
I know shit don't always last (yeah, yeah)
No breaks, all gas
She swear I'm horny, bitch, I'm not brass
Is findin' true love too much to ask? (Yeah, yeah)
But you need a tutor, go back to class
Don't know what romance, know what love is

I'm here countin' all my days and
Wake up feelin' jaded
One less conversation
Like nah, nah, nah
My time is runnin' vacant
Woke up in a daze and
Sick of all the changes
Like nah, nah, nah

Baby, you can make it better, better
Build me up to break me down
She knows that I'll make it wetter, wetter
If I ever come around

I'm here countin' all my days and
Wake up feelin' jaded
One less conversation
Like nah, nah, nah
My time is runnin' vacant
Woke up in a daze and
Sick of all the changes
Like nah, nah, nah
Like nah, nah, nah
