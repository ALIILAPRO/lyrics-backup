		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why do you still look at me
Like I belong to you?
It's like you won't let me go
No matter what I do

You must be a parasite
Or some sick disease
Your fingers wrapped around my throat
Suffocating me

I'm running, running, running, running
Fast as I can
But I'll never get away from you
If I'm still breathing

I can run, I can hide
But reality won't die
Infect me, infect me
You're trying to infect me

And I will fight
As you attack
Why won't you ever see
That what you have done to me
Won't define who I am
No, won't define who I am

You're never gonna be
Anything more to me
Than a biohazard
Than a biohazard
Than a biohazard

Predators devour their prey
To nourish their being
But the way you tend to feed off of me's
The most vicious thing I've seen

You must be an animal
Unable to feel
A monster starved for centuries
You've made me your meal
(I have been contaminated)

And I will fight
As you attack
Why won't you ever see
That what you have done to me
Won't define who I am
No, won't define who I am

You're never gonna be
Anything more to me
Than a biohazard

You can scream as much as you want
I hear you loud and clear
The thought of being alone
Fills you with fear
We're gonna end this war right here and now
This won't go on anymore
'Cause I'ma burn it

And I will fight
As you attack
Why won't you ever see
That what you have done to me
Won't define who I am
No, won't define who I am
You're never gonna be
Anything more to me

And I will fight
As you attack
Why won't you ever see
That what you have done to me
Won't define who I am
No, won't define who I am
You're never gonna be
Anything more to me

Than a biohazard
Biohazard
Biohazard

You are my
Biohazard
Biohazard
Biohazard

I am your
Biohazard
Biohazard
Biohazard
Biohazard
