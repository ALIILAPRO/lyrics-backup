		  Thugger Thugger baby
Fuck all that let's get to it
What lil' shawty say?

She suck on that dick on the plane and I just called her airhead (Woo!)
I just went hunting, I found me a rabbit, I picked out the carrots
I'm just tired of smoking kush, I need some Moonrock out in Cali
I got a white bitch and she give me that Becky but her name is Sari
I pimp, I don't play with them
She bad, I might stay with her
Stack it up like a Lego, yeah
Homicide, you can lay with them
Got some hoes, you can slay with them
You know that we players, we paying them
She can't be my wife, I can't lay in there
Diamonds all black like I'm racist now

Riding through the city, windows tinted, AC blast
I got bitches wanna fuck me, so so wrong, do me bad
I got cash in my pants, I got cash on her ass
AP dance, bitches glance, 'cause my diamonds look like glass

I wanna fuck her but she play more games than the NBA
Monday morning, got a dentist appointment, lil' bitch you can check out the dentistry
I got so much jewelry, baby I got so much water this shit like a mini-lake
Fuck nigga play I'mma send him to meet his maker then ask God for forgiveness bae
Cop a chopper, end up flipping nigga
Yeah, you better stop tripping nigga
I don't use words when I kill a nigga
We don't use phones, we no silly niggas
I think I need help with my kidney nigga
No cat but you know I'm just kidding with you
I make this shit fly out the ceiling nigga
I'm hot like an eye on a skillet nigga (Ya dig)

She suck on that dick on the plane and I just called her airhead (Woo!)
I just went hunting, I found me a rabbit, I picked out the carrots
I'm just tired of smoking kush, I need some Moonrock out in Cali
I got a white bitch and she give me that Becky but her name is Sari
I pimp, I don't play with them
She bad, I might stay with her
Stack it up like a Lego, yeah
Homicide, you can lay with them
Got some hoes, you can slay with them
You know that we players, we paying them
She can't be my wife, I can't lay in there
Diamonds all black like I'm racist now

You can't take jack, fall into this mouse trap
Riding through the bity, got a AK on my lap
I'm not talking shit, but I'm ready to shoot some craps
If he think he wanna see me, I'mma send a hundred straps
(Lil, Blood)
I got some birds like I'm Julio
My outfit outdated, its Coogi tho
I want pussy or head, you a groupie ho
Balmain with a motherfuckin' Gucci coat
I won't talk to that bitch, let that coochie know
Yeah, let that coochie know
Diamonds from Tiffany Co
Paid a whole 100 racks for those
You should get down with this slime shit
Tonight I'm 'bout geeked out my mind shit
My credit good, I don't need a dime shit
Pour Act' inside that lemon lime shit
That petty thief, need to stop tryin' shit
If you need help I got some dime bitches
I cannot stand none these lyin' bitches
I need a website for some fine bitches

She suck on that dick on the plane and I just called her airhead (Woo!)
I just went hunting, I found me a rabbit, I picked out the carrots
I'm just tired of smoking kush, I need some Moonrock out in Cali
I got a white bitch and she give me that Becky but her name is Sari
I pimp, I don't play with them
She bad, I might stay with her
Stack it up like a Lego, yeah
Homicide, you can lay with them
Got some hoes, you can slay with them
You know that we players, we paying them
She can't be my wife, I can't lay in there
Diamonds all black like I'm racist now
