		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tear through the ashes of what still remains
The blood runs down my face
Can't find the reason
We're all left to waste
You must awaken
See through my eyes

I bleed to let myself know I'm alive
As you hide in denial
Break through the clouds and reach out to the sky
You must awaken

See through my eyes
See through the lies
We're not far away
We're not far away

As we crawl to salvation
The rest try to hold us down as they fall
We separate from the hate that will bring us down
Bring us down
Bring us down

These lacerations
They will reveal for the rest of my life
These aggravations will not conceal 'til I die or we end this fight

As we crawl to salvation
The rest try to hold us down as they fall
We separate from the hate that will bring us down

Forget the words that they've said
If it's all deceit in your head
This life is more that just lies
Awake and see through my eyes

Awake and see through my eyes [x4]
