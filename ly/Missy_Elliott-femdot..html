		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Flirting all in her ear and it's working perfect 
I look way better in person 
Merch it
I gotta place we can go if it's urgent
She Missy Elliott 
She put the thing down flip it (and reverse it)
real acrobatic it look like a circus
How I find me a lil baddie like you
Girl you know I was searching

Which Fem are you in the mood for?
Of course I feel safe what is this tool for?  
Yes I need brain, what did I go to school for?
(And I)
Hit the girls on yo girl mood board 
So what's it gonna be
She looked me like what you gonna need 
She and gas tank both on E 
but like Boosie all drank on me 

Flirting all in her ear and it's working perfect 
I look way better in person 
Merch it
I gotta place we can go if it's urgent
She Missy Elliott 
She put the thing down flip it (and reverse it)
real acrobatic it look like a circus
How I find me a lil baddie like you
Girl you know I was searching

See the fit a couple grand
On the low end
Keep it modest 
She topping me while she topless 
Said she wanted me in private,
Pinky swear that no one hear thing about it, 
Well except the neighbors 
Cause they heard it all 
Body thicker than things between walls 
That thing was she feigning for slid between her jaws
That's crazy talk 
knock knees till she knocked kneed
now she gotta lazy walk
The way I rock it is magic 
I'm one, Tracy Mcgrady talk
Wanna hit on the first night what do you take me for 
I mean I'm gone do it
I mean it what was it what is
She came through the crib 
And slid right in her ribs. 
Oh here we go again
Hit the group chat 
Leave a review for your friends


Flirting all in her ear and it's working perfect 
I look way better in person 
Merch it
I gotta place we can go if it's urgent
She Missy Elliott 
She put the thing down flip it (and reverse it)
real acrobatic it look like a circus
How I find me a lil baddie like you
Girl you know I was searching
