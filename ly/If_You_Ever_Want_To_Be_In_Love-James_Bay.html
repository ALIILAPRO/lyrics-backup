		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Saw you today after so much time
Felt just like it used to be
Talking for hours 'bout a different life
Surrounded us in memories
We were close never close enough
Where are we now
'Cause if it's torn we can stitch it up
Don't rule it out
Oh no no

I'll come around
If you ever want to be in love
I'm not waiting, but I'm willing if you call me up
If you ever want to be in love
I'll come around

Wanted to ask if we could have been
But my tongue wouldn't break the seal
You always had something effortless
At school you were the biggest deal
Little quirks close and open up
Time is slipping by
I'm always thinking 'bout the two of us
Replay on my mind
Always playing on my mind

I'll come around
If you ever want to be in love
I'm not waiting, but I'm willing if you call me up
If you ever want to be in love
I'll come around

We were, young we were side by side
Don't know when we started losing touch
If you want we could walk around
Maybe that would be enough
Used to talk drinking to the night
I would wake up on the front room floor
All along you'd be in my bed
Make me crazy make me want you more

I'll come around
If you ever want to be in love
I'm not waiting, but I'm willing if you call me up
I'll come around
If you ever want to be in love
I'm not waiting, but I'm willing if you call me up
If you ever want to be in love
I'll come around
