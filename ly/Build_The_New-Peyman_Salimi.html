		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't change your heart
Don't change your heart
Be soft and don't let the world make you hard
The rain might always chase you down
Chase you down
Don't let the muddy road and dirt wear you out
Now dry your eyes
And hold your head up till it all disappears
Don't fight the old just build the new
Only you'll be the real fix to all your glitches
Boy you're a crazy soul doesn't mean you're wrong
No need to burn down all the bridges behind
Cause all the lies you're told
Somehow made you end up in tears
Time to break the cycle
Been knocking it for so many years
The long overdue revival
Breathe through panic and work through your fears
Now dry you eyes
Hold your head up till it all disappears
Cause all the lies and crap you've been told
Made you end up in tears
A strong wave
Strong but you'll survive it
It's gonna crash down on you
Time to learn how to ride it
Just breathe
You can't stop the nature who can
Change
But don't wipe all the pictures out
Again
Just try not to burn 'em all down
Try not to tear 'em all down
You better take it easy
Try not to tear 'em all down
Try not to burn 'em all down
Shit happens for a reason
