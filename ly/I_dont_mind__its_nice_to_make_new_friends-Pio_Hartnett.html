		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want to love you if I'd ever known how
I would have started already would have laid it all down
Kiss me quiet in the moments in between
Kiss me in a manner of speaking
Help me feel like I gave these years a go
Young years like a beer when the fridge is full
You go on
I'll have mine later
Because I don't mind
I don't mind
It's nice to make new friends from time to time
I don't mind
I don't mind
I can fall behind for a little while
I want to live and I want to breathe
I want to be something that you can see
But when we pull up to your parents house
I can't see myself in their eyes
I want a piece of the puzzle
So that you can't finish it
And I want to be the person
That you thought I was
But I don't mind
I don't mind
It's nice to make new friends from time to time
I don't mind
I don't mind
I can fall behind for a little while
Even when I don't feel it
Even when my body don't know it
Even when I can't show it
Even when we can't control it
Even when our house is folding
Even when the tears start rolling
Even when I tried controlling
Even if I tried controlling
No I don't mind
I don't mind
It's nice to make new friends from time to time
