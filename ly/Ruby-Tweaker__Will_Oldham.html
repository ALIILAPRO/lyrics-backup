		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It isn't always I am well
For sometimes I am ailing
And yet in steaming night I smile
To downplay this my failing
And make a noise to bury all
Of your weeping and your wailing

And then in bed by little light
And closed off from it all
I must try and bring a conscious end to night
And hope that dreams begin to fall

The color of my dreams, they would be you...ruby
Oh if I could close my eyes and bring you to me
Push your head into
Make you not you not you not you but me

And then in dreams I wander free
And see some things I'm meant to see
And sometimes even I see thee

And would the night go on and on
And not tomorrow end at dawn
And whatever mat I lay upon
Dissolve

The color of my dreams, if I had dreams, they would be you...ruby
Everything I do is done to bring you closer to me
When you sleep your breath it blows right on through me

The color of my dreams, if I had dreams, they would be you...ruby
The color of my dreams, they would be you...ruby

And illness be or wellness thrive
My dream proves I am yet alive
