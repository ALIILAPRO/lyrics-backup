		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been mistreated 
I've been abused
I've been struck downhearted, baby
I've been confused
'Cause I know, yes, I know 
I've been mistreated
Since my baby left me 
I've been losing my mind
You know I have

I've been lonely
I've been cold
I've been looking for a woman to have and hold
'Cause I know, yes, I know 
I've been mistreated
Since my baby left me 
I've been losing, I've been losing
I've been losing my mind
Baby, baby, baby

I've been mistreated
I've been abused
I've been looking for a woman, yeh
I've been confused
'Cause I know, yes, I know 
I've been mistreated, oh, oh
Since my baby left me I've been losing, losing
I've been losing my mind, baby, baby, baby
Oh, oh, oh
Oh woman, oh woman, oh woman

I've been losing my mind
