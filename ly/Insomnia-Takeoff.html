		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah
Yeah, uh, uh, uh, huh
Ooh, yeah
You know what the fuck going on, nigga
Yeah, Buddah Bless this beat

Count up my money and give me them blues (count it up)
Watch me pipe on you (pipe up), I'ma go'n bust my move
Fuckin' her friends by the two (two), I been approved
You can't get in, I'ma charge 'bout ten and flex on you (flex)
I been up, huh (up), hey, ayy
We been up up (up), ayy, ayy
I been up, huh (up), ayy, ayy
I had to grind for days (grind)
I been up, I can't sleep, what's wrong?
Percocet, mollies on her tongue
Came a long way, we all on
Mmh-mmh

Plain Jane cost a fifty (plain)
Main things in my mentions (main)
They don't really know the half (half)
They don't really know the distance
Told 'em that I was gon' make it, they laughed (laughed)
Didn't believe in my decision (nope)
I tried to tell 'em, they ain't listen (nope)
They blind, they can't see the vision
My bitches bad and they pay the tab (she pay the tab)
I fuck her one time
I know she gon' come back around (back around)
I been gettin' that paper way back in the day
But this shit gettin' crazy now (crazy)
Money been tall as Yao
I'm on a jet, I land in Macau
They tried to copy the style (tried it)
Count up the backend
Cash in my hand right now (money)
I met the plug in England
No Queen Elizabeth, we talkin' 'bout pounds (pounds)
All of my niggas ain't friendly (uh, uh)
None of my niggas they smile (nope)
I'm taking risks, Man vs. Wild
I made it, now mama proud (mama)
Put the whole team on now (whole team)
Lookin' for the recipe, how?
She just be lookin' for clout (clout)
Fuck the whole team for the clout (clout)
I drink an eight a day
I never heard of a drought (Actavis)
Stars in the ceiling, Wraith, ayy
Big body comin' down (Wraith)
Finna go ape, Bape (Ape)
Hundred bricks came in on crates (crates)
I'ma take the money on dates (dates)
Fuck you and record it on tape (tape)
AP, iced out face (AP)
Pour up four 'cause I love the taste (Act)
Say you know who? Huh?
What? Where? Nobody safe (nobody)
I do not fuck with the squares (nobody)
Bitches they come out in pairs (twos)
Let's play a game of Truth or Dare (truth)
Is it true you won't shoot? (Is it true?)
Touch my chain, boy I dare (dare you to)
You gon' make it out of where? (Where?)
My niggas ain't playin' fair (nah)
Young rich niggas, yeah, we rare (ayy)

Count up my money and give me them blues (count it up)
Watch me pipe on you (pipe up), I'ma go'n bust my move
Fuckin' her friends by the two (two), I been approved
You can't get in, I'ma charge 'bout ten and flex on you (flex)
I been up, huh (up), hey, ayy
We been up up (up), ayy, ayy
I been up, huh (up), ayy, ayy
I had to grind for days (grind)
I been up, I can't sleep, what's wrong?
Percocet, mollies on her tongue
Came a long way, we all on
Mmh-mmh
