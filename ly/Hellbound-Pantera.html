		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eliminate, the life decline
I've paid the masters with blood and hunger 
And it's not for sale by any stretch
It's like religion without a Bible 
And the Dragon lives inside my mouth 
And it speaks in tongues, the word 

Hell bound, in Ft. Worth, Texas 
Hell bound, Ft. Worth 

Snakes, in Southern flames 
To bring the thunder, the great decider 
Would you believe in this or the ash? 
I do believe it and it's taking over 
Accept, accept, accept, accept, accept

Hell bound, in Ft. Worth, Texas 
Hell bound, Ft. Worth

Born to a world so young and proud 
But over your head hangs a black cloud 
Grow your hair and crawl inside yourself 
Because there you cannot hide 
Facing fears that you'll overcome and one 
Of these years you know you've won 
You've won, you've won, you've won

Hell bound, in Ft. Worth, Texas 
Hell bound, Ft. Worth
