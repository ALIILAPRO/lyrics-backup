		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's ending now
A full circle of incidents
Those seem so pointless now

Cliffhanging dates
Forgetting yesterday
Staring in my own act

Sometimes I behave like I'm in a play
A role forged by nighttime fairy tales
There're moments I think I am the only one around
And there are others trying to
Find the strength not being afraid

I tried to seek
Through other people's lives
The answers that torment me

All I got was questions
And a strong sense that I lost my time
Cause of Primal fears

Signing to you is all I want to do
In wept and angry tunes on mixed up styles
A taken melody from an ex best friend
Endless, sleepless nights observing all kind of tales

Singing for angry gods, seeking for heroes
Choosing ugly monsters, or noble zeroes
Personalized emotions, to show us truths
Lost in translation, on each other's beliefs

Everything dies unless the story ends early
Together we stand, until we're not
Not really much to do but enjoy it while it lasts
So join me in this tale that has a bitter taste

It's ending now
And I'm not feeling wiser than before
Just one step before the end of the line
One step before I finally close my eyes

Please, please give me more
Give me, give me more
Please, please, just a little more
Just a little more
