		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No, you couldn't spend a thing of what you made last week
You've been tired, you've been workin'
To make sure that you'd eat
Told you do yourself a favor, always tryin' to fit in
Mm, know you thinkin' that you wanna quit it
Thought you couldn't spend a minute on yourself last week (ooh)
You've been holdin' in your problems, all the years you don't speak (ooh)
You've been in it for so long, you think you know what life is (ooh)
And the pressure that you carry may be more than you think

Say, money will change your pockets, not your mindset
(Money will change your pockets, not your mindset)
Only gonna run from your problems 'cause it's harder to care
Say, money will change your pockets, not your mindset
(Money will change your pockets, not your mindset)
Only gonna run when you got it, 'cause it's harder to care
(Only gonna run when you got it, but you know you won't care)
