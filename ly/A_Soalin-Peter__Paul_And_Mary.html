		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey ho, nobody home, meat nor drink nor money have I none
Yet shall we be merry, hey ho, nobody home
Hey ho, nobody home, meat nor drink nor money have I none
Yet shall we be merry, hey ho, nobody home
Hey ho, nobody home

Soal, a soal, a soal cake, please good missus a soul cake
An apple, a pear, a plum, a cherry
Any good thing to make us all merry
One for Peter, two for Paul, three for him who made us all

God bless the master of this house, and the mistress also
And all the little children that round your table grow
The cattle in your stable and the dog by your front door
And all that dwells within your gates
We wish you ten times more

Soal, a soal, a soal cake, please good missus a soul cake
An apple, a pear, a plum, a cherry
Any good thing to make us all merry
One for Peter, two for Paul, three for him who made us all

Go down into the cellar and see what you can find
If the barrels are not empty we hope you will be kind
We hope you will be kind with your apple and strawber'
For we'll come no more a 'soalin' till this time next year

Soal, a soal, a soal cake, please good missus a soul cake
An apple, a pear, a plum, a cherry
Any good thing to make us all merry
One for Peter, two for Paul, three for him who made us all

The streets are very dirty, my shoes are very thin
I have a little pocket to put a penny in
If you haven't got a penny, a ha' penny will do
If you haven't got a ha' penny then god bless you

Soal, a soal, a soal cake, please good missus a soul cake
An apple, a pear, a plum, a cherry
Any good thing to make us all merry
One for Peter, two for Paul, three for him who made us all

Now to the lord sing praises all you within this place
And with true love and brotherhood each other now embrace
This holy tide of Christmas of beauty and of grace
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
