		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you get out of the hospital
Let me back into your life
I can't stand what you do
I'm in love with your eyes

And when you get out of the dating bar
I'll be here to get back into your life
I can't stand what you do
I'm in love with your eyes

Oh, I can't stand what you do
Sometimes I can't stand you
And it makes me think about me
That I'm involved with you

But I'm in love with this power that shows through in your eyes

I go to bakeries all day long
There's a lack of sweetness in my life
And there is pain inside
You can see it in my eyes

Oh, there is pain inside
You can see it in my eyes
It makes me think about me
That I've lost my pride

But I'm in love with this power that resides in your eyes

You live in modern apartments
Well, I've even got scared once or twice
Last time I walked down your street
There were tears in my eyes

Well, now, these streets we all know
They help us cry when we're alone late at night
Don't you love them too?
That where you got your eyes?

Oh, and I can't stand what you do
Sometimes I can't stand you
And it makes me think about me
How I'm involved with you

But I'm in love with this power that shows through in your eyes

Now, your world, it is beautiful
I'll take the subway to your suburb sometimes
I'll seek out the things that must've been magic to your little girl mind
Now, as a little girl, you must've been magic
I still get jealous of your old boyfriends in the suburbs sometimes
And when I walk down your street
Probably be tears in my eyes
I knew it would happen

I can't stand what you do
Sometimes I can't stand you
And it makes me think about me
That I'm involved with you

But I'm in love with this power that shows through in your eyes
So when you get out of the hospital
Let me back into your life
I can't stand what you do
But I'm in love with your eyes
