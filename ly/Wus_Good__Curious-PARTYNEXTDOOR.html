		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Good, lovin, feel so, numb
Ride me, 'til I'm, 'bout to, cum
I see, you are, 'bout to, clim-
-Ax so, oh, girl, don't be, shy

Is you ready?
Is you ready, baby?
You seem ready
You seem ready, baby
Girl tonight I won't be selfish
It is all for you (yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Girl, my bad, I just can't help it (just can't help it)
Girl, you taste so

Good, lovin, feel so, numb
Ride me, 'til I'm, 'bout to, cum
I see, you are, 'bout to, clim-
-Ax so, oh, girl, don't be, shy

Hey, shawty, this what I'm here for, I'm ready (I'm ready)
Are you downtown when I'm round town, I'm ready (I'm ready)
Girl, just let me know what's good
Girl, just let me know what's good

Girl, you're beautiful
They won't know, they won't know what we do
Girl, you're beautiful
No, no, they won't know what we do

And time's still runnin'
And my mind still runnin'
Block still hot from your Jimmy Choos
And you know I got experience
So you know I just wanna experience (yeah)
Girl, my bad I just can't help it (just can't help it, no, oh yeah)
Girl, you taste so

Good, lovin, feel so, numb
Ride me, 'til I'm, 'bout to, cum
I see, you are, 'bout to, clim-
-Ax so, oh, girl, don't be, shy (woah, ooh)

Hey, shawty, this what I'm here for, I'm ready (when you're ready)
Are you downtown when I'm 'round town, I'm ready (girl, when you're ready)
Girl, just let me know what's good
Girl, just let me know what's good

Girl, you're beautiful
They won't know, they won't know what we do
Girl, you're beautiful
No, no, they won't know what we do

Shawty you're curious
Get serious, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh (oh-oh, oh)
You say you're curious, oh, no

Rollin' with codeine and a Swisher (uh)
Shit, I just might kiss her (yeah)
She just changed her Twitter (yeah)
To "Party Gets Me Wetter"
And you know that I believe it (believe)
'Cause her pussy the meanest
She don't fuck with many niggas
She don't fuck with any niggas
Yeah, I call all the dibs on mine
I call all the nines and dimes
I put on my ice and sneaks
She puts on her ice and weave
We stay mobbin' for a week
Hit the strip while she asleep
Shawty know that I'm a freak
Shawty know that I'm a freak
And that's why, oh, no
You're curious, oh
