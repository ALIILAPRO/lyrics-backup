		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Smell your blood
It's like a carnival, or state fair
Skin is cotton candy
So easy to melt in my mouth

Don't wanna know
Don't need to know
You got champagne problems
Don't wanna know
Don't need to know
You got champagne problems

I need a raincoat for tomorrow
I need a raincoat for tomorrow
It's about how much people cry
When you die
It's not about the storm of tears
That you make when you're alive

Half-way and one step forward
Past the points of no return
Half-way and one step forward
Past the points of no return

Ring all the bells you can ring
There's a crack in everything
That's how the sunlight gets in
Ring all the bells you can ring
There's a crack in everything
That's how the sunlight gets in

Don't wanna know
Don't need to know
You got champagne problems
Don't wanna know
Don't need to know
You got champagne problems

Half-way and one step forward
Past the points of no return
Half-way and one step forward
Past the points of no return

Half-way and one step forward
Past the points of no return

Don't wanna know (half-way and one step forward)
Don't need to know (past the points of no return)
You got champagne problems (half-way and one step forward)
Don't wanna know (half-way and one step forward)
Don't need to know (past the points of no return)
You got champagne problems (half-way and one step forward)
Past the points of no return
