		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dead beat underdogs
Resting in their caskets
Black sheep sanctuary
Ready for the masses

White stripes passing by
Though the black horizon
Soldiers in the dark
Highlife rollin' thunder

No matter where we start
The road is in our hearts

We die hard
Vagabond wanderers
Living in a wonderworld
Same as old habits
We die hard

We die hard
Maybe we were born to lose
But this is the life that we choose
Same as old habits
We die hard

Gazing diesel eyes
Bending hell for leather
Far from home again
You can’t jeopardize it

Tough love beaten up
You know that I want it
Spirits young enough
Take us through the heartbreaks
 
No matter where we start
The road is in our hearts

We die hard
Vagabond wanderers
Living in a wonderworld
Same as old habits
We die hard

We die hard
Maybe we were born to lose
But this is the life that we choose
Same as old habits
We die hard

We die hard
Vagabond wanderers
Living in a wonderworld
Same as old habits
We die hard

We die hard
Maybe we were born to lose
But this is the life that we choose
Same as old habits
We die hard

We die hard
Vagabond wanderers
Living in a wonderworld
Same as old habits
We die hard

We die hard
Maybe we were born to lose
But this is the life that we choose
Same as old habits
We die hard
