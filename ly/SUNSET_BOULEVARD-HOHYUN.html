		  Ooh sunset boulevard
Up and down the road
Eyes on the sky
Ooh sunset boulevard
Up and down the road
Eyes on the sky
And I feel like I'm going insane
It's cold out here just like my heart and soul
Breaking down all my walls
Seeing hella things you don't want
Yes I know
It's too cold
Just look at everything I do
I'm suffocating myself
I'm not safe oh oh oh
I'm not safe
I'm lost at sea drowning
Wake me up help me
Must be something I can do
I'm driving round reckless
Breaking rules
Don't care who knows
I just want to be free oh
Ooh sunset boulevard
Up and down the road
Eyes on the sky
And I feel like I'm going insane
It's cold out here just like my heart and soul
깜빡했어 순수한 행복함이 못 찾아
난 어릴 때 도 힘들었고 난 그냥 아무 말 안 했잖아
깜빡했어 난 누군지 제발 건드리지 마
외로움이 제일 편한데 그게 내 문제야
Ooh sunset boulevard
Up and down the road
Eyes on the sky
And I feel like I'm going insane
It's cold out here just like my heart and soul
