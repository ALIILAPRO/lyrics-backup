		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got so much trouble on my mind.
Refuse to lose.
Here's your ticket to a cold world that's wicked.
I never cared.

I never knew.
Until I found I was someone to you.
Now I'm so confused.
I don't know what to do.

You say you wanna know how I feel.
But I'm gonna spare you the guilt.
They say all wounds heal with time.
That's the farthest thing from my mind.

You're two facing me. 
You're not being real with yourself.
Get away from me (Get away from me)
I don't need your fucking help.

Pray for me like you do every night.
It won't do me any fucking good.
Now you say to me, you just want me to be alright.

From me to you.
