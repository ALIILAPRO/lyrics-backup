		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lately I've been sliding back in
To my old ways
Giving all my precious time
To rainy days
All the doors that were closed
They won't be anymore

'Cause tonight there's a new moon
Tonight there's a new moon
It'll fall into place
Tonight there's a new moon
Tonight there's a new moon
And it's all gonna change

Tomorrow I'll know why
I've been feeling so strange
I'll know all of the answers
To the things I can't explain

Lately I've been sliding back in
To my old ways
Giving all my precious time
To rainy days
All the pieces
Won't be scattered like before

'Cause tonight there's a new moon
Tonight there's a new moon
It'll fall into place
Tonight there's a new moon
Tonight there's a new moon
And it's all gonna change

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
