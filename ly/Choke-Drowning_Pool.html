		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I can't decide, truth or the lies
One heals, one steals, one gives
You're flying blind, you justify
I'm about to burn out, no doubt

You need me more than I want you, oh

Nothing's real but this pain I feel
So choke (choke), choke on it, I hope you choke
The scars fade and the hate remains
So choke (choke), choke on it, I hope you choke

Give up on me, catastrophe
Well I have the final word
It's all your fault as judgment calls
No less than you deserve

You need me more than I want you, oh
(Nothing's real)

Nothing's real but this pain I feel
So choke (choke), choke on it, I hope you choke
The scars fade, hate remains
So choke (choke), choke on it, I hope you choke
Nothing's real but this pain I feel
So choke (choke), choke on it, I hope you choke
The scars fade, hate remains
So choke (choke), choke on it, I hope you choke

Choke
Choke
Choke, choke
Choke

You need me, more than I want you

Nothing's real but this pain I feel
So choke (choke), choke on it, I hope you choke
The scars fade, hate remains
So choke (choke), choke on it
Nothing's real (nothing's real)
But this pain I feel (the hate remains)
The scars fade, hate remains
So choke (choke), choke on it, I hope you choke

Well, I'm so sick of it all
So (you need me), I hope you choke
Well, I'm so sick of it all
So (you need me), I hope you choke
