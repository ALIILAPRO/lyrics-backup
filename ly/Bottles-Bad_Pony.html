		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Keep going on like this and I won't speak to you
Your eyes keep holding me, it feels so sickly sweet
Can't be in company when you're all I think about
We fall back into it and blame our common sense

Taboo I know you're onto me, I'm weakening
I try to hide my doubts, we'll end with nothing now
We need an armistice but our war's blistering
We took our chances and passion gets out of hand

We're drinking bottles, we're downing bottles of wine
It won't regret me almost all of the time

We're drinking bottles, we're downing bottles of wine
It won't regret me almost all of the time

You're lead inside my skin but I'm your medicine
One dose is strengthening, the other wearing thin
A final straw contends with any other man
Surely we've worn this out

Lichen and sand on the ground
I'm looking up, you're coming down
I take the fall and you miss out
I cop the heat again

We're drinking bottles, we're downing bottles of wine
It won't regret me almost all of the time

We're drinking bottles, we're downing bottles of wine
It won't regret me almost all of the time

Your crazy could never be just sorted out
But lately I know where to draw the line
You're innately pre-disposed to fucking with my mind
But lately, I know where to draw the line
