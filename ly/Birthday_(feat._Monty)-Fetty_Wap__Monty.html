		  Love it when you walk my way

We can go far, take trips for your birthday, baby (ay)
Love it when you walk that way
Baby, you a boss, make 'em listen when you talk now, baby (ay)
Love it when you walk that way
Baby, you a star, now we can go far, baby

Love it when you walk that way, baby, take it off (mmh)
