		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are so full of yourself
(Live it up)
In your own kitchen
Still trying to soak It all up
(Loser)
Start your own religion
You’re never sick and tired of you
(You love yourself)

So prophetic
Pretending you know everything
You believe it
The best things in life are free
Now sing it
When you sold your loyalty

And all that caustic shit that you spew
Give it up
Still crying cause nobody respects you

Trans landing
Who cares if I’m a girl or boy (or both)
Empathetic
Just live and let live
You’re the one
Who’s pathetic
Stop telling me what’s right or wrong

And all that caustic shit that you spew
Give it up
Keep crying cause nobody respects you

Why do you care where I come from?
Nobody’s business who I love
Or why
It doesn’t matter to me what you do
Cause I’m not you

And all that caustic shit that you spew
Give it up
Keep crying cause nobody respects you
Nobody respects you
Give it up
Give it up
Give it up
