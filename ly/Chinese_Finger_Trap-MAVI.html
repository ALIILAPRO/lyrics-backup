		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Feel like the harder I work
The smaller escape
The taller the gate
They say it's all in the game
And I should feel honored to race
And I should feel honored, yeah

Feel like the harder I work
The smaller escape
The taller the gate
They say it's all in the game
And I should feel honored to race

The feet of God where I lay
Feats strength for applause
Just slap some gauze on that thing
And don't be awkward on stage
New bone deposit my face
I owe my life to the cause
Give my all to the game
Because without 'em I'm lost
My martyrdom entertainment
Walls on my brain I recocked
Meaning for recall and embraced
You hear me cough in my sleep
I hear you scoff at my J's
One for each day of the week
Burn each one down in a day
Everybody treating me regular
Lost my elders and baby
I wander helpless in St. Louis
Lost myself to the pavement
I couldn't even remember what I was searching or chasing
You said you see me wake up twitchin', see your mom keep you stable
That incident cost me December, three more ribcage I cave
The cost of me doing business
My garden tear irrigated 
Now I'm too player to know me
Guess how the fuck I've been coping
Finally sober, and it's just another layer of lonely
Niggas retrace to my home so I keep my lasers the closest
I told mamma I need new chrome, she think I'm playing a joke
And I told her that I'm on my second watch, somethin' changed in her knowing
She watched her son change into something, took the weight for the longest
Me and Mitch gon crash the car, we shed those tears on the highway
Me and Isaiah did the same and he went his, I went my way
I'm off to bury another angel I ain't think that could die
When I feel things be surprise, I'm dry, I ain't think I could cry
If mama took her self serious as me ain't no way I survive
The sun just pace in the sky, tryna escape the horizon

Feel like the harder I work
The smaller escape
The taller the gate
They say it's all in the game
And I should feel honored to race

But you hate loving me, say it
However awful it tastes
I threw it all in the flames and I know it
Yeah
However awful it tastes
I threw it all in the flames and I know it
However
Laughing so hard that it's painful, I know it
Yeah, however awful it tastes
I threw it all in the flames and I know it
Oh, yeah
Laughing so hard that it's painful, I know it
(Yes, sir)

It's crazy like
When you, when you, when you really
Really fucked up, like, the dumbest shit make you laugh
You know?
Swear to God
Damn, alright let's do one more for a comp'
Let's do it this shit
