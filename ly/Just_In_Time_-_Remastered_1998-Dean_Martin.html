		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just in time, I found you just in time
Before you came my time was running low
I was lost, the losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed, no where to go
Now you're here, now I know just where I'm going

No more doubt or fears I've found my way
For love came just in time
You found me just in time
And changed my lonely life that lucky day

Now you're here, now I know just where I'm going
No more doubt or fears I've found my way
For love came just in time
You found me just in time
And changed my lonely life that lucky day
