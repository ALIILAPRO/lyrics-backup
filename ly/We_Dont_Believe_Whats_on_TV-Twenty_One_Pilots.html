		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We don't believe what's on TV
Because it's what we want to see
And what we want we know we can't believe
We have all learned to kill our dreams

I need to know
That when I fail you'll still be here
'Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds
And we'll make money selling your hair

I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old
But because of you I might think twice

Alright, second verse
What if my dream does not happen?
Would I just change what I've told my friends?
Don't want to know who I would be
When I wake up from a dreamer's sleep

I need to know
That when I fail you'll still be here
'Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds
And we'll make money selling your hair

But I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old
But because of you I might think twice

I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old
But because of you I might think twice
