		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why do you look at me that way, you know we're worlds apart
There's no denying though I've tried,
You're like a perilous spark

I'm bound to catch fire on my way to transcend
Let this be the end of my cries

You're the cure for this lonely heart
Lying underneath, you keep on hiding
And like a moth to a candle
I run within the flames of your dangerous mind, burning bright

How can I free myself from hiding behind blurry eyes
It's like a circle, you're the reason I'm spinning so blind

I'm bound to catch fire on my way to transcend
Let this be the end of my cries

You're the cure for this lonely heart
Lying underneath, you keep on hiding
And like a moth to a candle
I run within the flames of your dangerous mind, burning bright

Dangerous mind
I'm on my way to transcend now
I'm on my way to transcend now
Let this be the end of my cries now

You're the cure for this lonely heart
Lying underneath, you keep on hiding
And like a moth to a candle
I run within the flames of your dangerous mind, burning bright
