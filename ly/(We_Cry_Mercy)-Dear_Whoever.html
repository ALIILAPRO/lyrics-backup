		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We've been broken falling out again.
I'll hold my armor close right there next to you.
We will stand, holding ourselves, I need you here and I need your help

When I look around, there's no one beside me,
all I hear, is my breathing, from my chest,
I'm crawling around, searching...escaping...death...

I will not surrender

Grace bestowed on my heart when we cry Mercy, we cry mercy
Armor of God protect us as we cry Mercy give us Mercy
Grace so lovely pure and holy we cry Mercy we cry mercy

All I needed was you next to me, since this started,
I can't stop bleeding, it's all my fault,
I'll take the blame, you never left and you died for me

My hands are shaking, when I'm scared
All the death around, me help me

This is War
We're at war
Save us from war
Torn by the enemy ripped from my flesh and blood!
