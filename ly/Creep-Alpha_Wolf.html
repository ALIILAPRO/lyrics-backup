		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Creep

Kicked in the teeth, dragged through the dirt
Thrown to the dogs while everyone watched
Suppression sewn shut
Say something, say anything

I'm on the edge of a knife
No stranger to the bleed
Do I make you uncomfortable?
Are you afraid?

Creep

If I'm a dead man walking you're the nail in my coffin 

I don't give a fuck
Rather die a pariah than live an acolyte
Too busy shaking the fence to be shaking hands
It doesn't hurt like it used to, losing faith in you 

Nothing to lose but faith in you 

Maybe it's just me
Chip on my shoulder, cold heart on my sleeve

Head down low
Breathe it in, breathe in the dirt
Creep along
Save yourself
Nobody knows, nobody cares
So creep along	 

Nothing to lose but faith in you

So what's the price for a counterfeit soul?
An opportunity to play some fucking 1's and 0's
Metalcore snitches
I'm not religious but I know a double cross when I see one
So what the fuck is up? 

Stone cold, keep your composure
Sleep with one eye open
