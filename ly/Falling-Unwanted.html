		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I'm falling, falling
I'm just calling for help
Would you save me, save me
I could forgive, forgive, you
Free me, free me
From this wild world, I'm done
Now I'm trying my best
Just to protect myself, yeah
Calm down for a minute
I come back in a minute
Just the time for me to prepare my leave
I'm not sure where I'll drive
I don't know if I'll drown
I won't let it in my mind
'Cause it's getting me down
Where's the limit
Would you do it
Would you leave it
It's not that easy
Would you thank me
Many times I've tried to tell you
Tried to save you
When I'm falling, falling
I'm just calling for help
Would you save me, save me
I could forgive, forgive, you
Free me, free me
From this wild world, I'm done
Now I'm trying my best
Just to protect myself, yeah
