		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time to say goodbye
But don't leave me alone, just stay for the night
I need you, I need you tonight
Derulo

Ooh it's three in the morning
When you want some you phone me
One word in Español, babe
And I come and you know 
Girls in Haiti they throw it (throw!)
In Jamaica they roll it (roll!)
Girls in Spain do the mostest
But only you got my focus

Girl, I'm down for your lovin'
Down for my fatty, fatty
Down for your lovin'
Down for my naughty, naughty
Down for your lovin'
I'm giving you lovin'
Stay with me 'cause

It's time to say goodbye
But don't leave me alone, just stay for the night
I need you, I need you tonight
Baby, you know that it's time to say goodbye
But don't leave me alone, just stay for the night
I need you, I need you tonight
Baby you know that it's

Dame solo un momento
Quiero sentir tu cuerpo (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Que ya no tengo tiempo
Tú y yo una noche de fuego (oui, oui, oui)
Te hablo Francés like (sí, sí, sí)
Te explico que soy de (ti, ti, ti)
Parlez-vous Français (oui, oui, oui)
Síguelo, mami, vale

'Cause I'm down for your lovin'
Down for my fatty, fatty
Down for your lovin'
Down for my naughty, naughty
Down for your lovin'
I'm giving you lovin'
Stay with me 'cause

It's time to (it's time) say goodbye (hey baby)
But don't leave me alone, just stay for the night
I need you, I need you tonight
Baby, you know that it's time to say goodbye (say goodbye, say goodbye)
But don't leave me alone, just stay for the night
I need you, I need you tonight (prr, night, night, Oh)

Uh, tell him seh' it proper and it prim (and it prim)
A mermaid ting, and he wanna swim (he wanna swim)
How gal bright suh but dem eyes dim (dem eyes dim)
Ch-ch-chain heavy but I'm light skin (I'm light skin)
I pull up on him let him put the pipe in (pipe in)
But then I gotta dash like a hyphen (hyphen)
I bring the cake, let him lick the icing (icing)
Some little open toes Stewart Weitzman
Advising, ye-yes this ties in (okay)
No-none of you hoes will ever see my pen
YSL Nicki boot, just to drive in
The way my foot ball, just give me the Heisman
Touchdown, touchdown, touchdown, touch

'Cause it's time to say goodbye (yeah)
But don't leave me alone, just stay for the night
('Cause I need you babe) I need you, I need you tonight
Baby, you know that it's time to say goodbye (I hate it)
But don't leave me alone, just stay for the night
I need you, I need you tonight
Baby, you know that it's

Papi Chulo
¿Cuánto amas este culo?
Culo, culo
¿Cuánto amas este culo?
Say goodbye, stay the night
One more time, one more time
