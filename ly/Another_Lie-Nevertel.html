		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I haven't heard from you all night
You swear to God that it's alright?
Wish I could get you to tell me where you really are
But I don't know how to go about it

It's always, "Cross my heart and hope to die"
That's what you say to me for the hundredth time
Oh, you wanna play it off like I don't know why
Because you already know you're

Caught in another lie

It's not me that's dragging out a stupid fight
It's not me that's screwing with another life
You're so eager now to find something that I did to you so you can sleep at night

"Cross my heart and hope to die"
That's what you say to me for the hundredth time
Oh, you wanna play it off like I don't know why
Because you already know you're

Caught in another lie
(In another lie)
Caught in another lie
(In another lie)
Caught in another lie
(In another lie)
Caught in another lie

We could find our way
We could stay up late and start it all over
We could find our way
We could stay up late and start it all over

Caught in another lie
(Should've known by now)
Caught in another lie
(You would let me down)
Caught in another lie
(Should've known by now)
Caught in another lie

Caught in another lie
(In another lie)
Caught in another lie
(In another lie)
Caught in another lie
(In another lie)
Caught in another lie
