		  Easy now, no need fi go down
Easy now, no need fi go down
Rock that, run that, this where we from
Whoop whoop, when you run come around
Cah now you're the talk of the town, yeah
Now, you're the talk of the town, yeah
Now, you're the talk of the town (dance)

Whoop whoop, when you run come around, cah
Whoop whoop, when you run come around
Cah now you're the talk of the town (hold up)
Whoop whoop, when you run come around, cah
Whoop whoop, when you run come around
Cah now you're the talk of the town (wait a minute)

Easy now no need fi go down
Just wuk it gently and you breakin' a bone
Cool end-it-ly, you have a style of your own
The saxophone

'Cause you sound like the talk of the town, yeah
And me like it when you run come around, yeah
Make me wobble, mek mi whole body bubble
And me no seh yuh trouble, when ya ready for the double (wait a minute)

And you hit that, note inna di middle
Play with it a likkle, why you sound ah tickle?
I'm tellin' you to, hit that
Note inna di middle
Play with it a likkle, why you sound ah tickle?
I'm feelin' them

Hey, wait up, wait up, wait up, wait up (dance)

Whoop whoop, when you run come around, cah
Whoop whoop, when you run come around
Cah now you're the talk of the town (hold up)
Whoop whoop, when you run come around, cah
Whoop whoop, when you run come around
Cah now you're the talk of the town

Easy now, no need fi go down
Easy now, no need fi go down
Wuk it gently and you breakin' a bone
Whoop whoop, when you run come around
Cah now you're the talk of the town, yeah
Whoop whoop, when you run come around
Cah now you're the talk of the town, yeah
Whoop whoop, when you run come around
Cah now you're the talk of the town, yeah

Whoop whoop, when you run come around, cah
Whoop whoop, when you run come around
Cah now you're the talk of the town (hold up)
Whoop whoop, when you run come around, cah
Whoop whoop, when you run come around
Cah now you're the talk of the town (wait a minute)
