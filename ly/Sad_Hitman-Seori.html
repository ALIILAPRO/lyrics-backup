		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Show me what you really got
Show me what you're looking for
Umm, nothing can dare stop me now
You know me, right?

Show me what you really got
Show me what you're looking for
I only chase what pleases me most
You got me, right?

Ah-ooh
I don't care about whatever you say
Umm-mm

Let go my way
I'll get what I've waited for
Kick'em out
Things will go my way
You'll get what you've paid for
Kick'em out

Everything you ever longed to be
Those who're chasing their own fantasy
Things will go my way
You'll get what you've paid for
Kick'em out
