		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So leave it what it is
Just give it time
Try your best to smile

Give her lengths of love
But the body is gone
Body is gone

Fondle candy wall
Evening is slime
What a waste of time

And although you still get by
Searching for the things
That make you come alive

It goes down to this
It's a-why you're here
Oh, why you walk

Fondle candy wall
Open hands
Well, that's the style

Bones crack many years
These gamut boys
Millionaires

Take me out on a ride
I like you well enough
To give you mother's arc

The streaks survives, in the night
The streaks survives, in the night
The streaks survives, in the night
The streaks survives, in the night
The streaks survives, in the night
The streaks survives, in the night
