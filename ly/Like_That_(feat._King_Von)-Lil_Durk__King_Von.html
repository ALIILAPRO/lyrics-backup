		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A nigga talkin' 'bout a motherfucker can't use no tune
Like motherfuckers ain't in these streets
On God

Why you playin' with my shorty like he won't come up out that cut?
Why you talkin' out your neck like he won't turn yo' ass to runts?
They say why we ain't kill his ass, we was on his ass for a couple months
You know Blow, his ass a smoker, he put 3 grams in a blunt
Got a booster, she a dwarf, I don't pay for Saint Laurent
Ain't no peace treaty with the opps, don't call my phone 'cause I ain't the one
How they give him 39 and he ain't get caught up with no gun?
Ain't no pass, we on your ass, don't get caught up with your son
It's one opp that we ain't blast, after him it ain't no fun
How you say your ass the man and you ain't give your block no guns?
Man, you know his ass a rat, how he get out in a month?
Why you actin' like a bitch? Nigga should've been a punk
We gon' catch you lackin', off them pills, wearin' them glasses
We gon' hit your blindside, foenem hit you nine times
I send hits through CashApp, I'm on a 6 with badazz
On that car if he back back, fuck my opps, I'm Die Y

Why you walk like that? (He told)
Why you talk like that? (He told)
Why you move like that? (Let's get it)
Why you shoot like that? (He old)
Why you lack like that? (Yeah)
Why act like that? (Let's get it)
Why you fu like that? (Why you fu?)
You make the news like that (yeah)
See, I ain't built like that (let's go)
Bitch, you get killed like that (let's go)
My pockets gettin' big (let's get it)
Like uncle Phil in there (Uncle Phil in there)
Who got the pills in here? (Who got the pills in there?)
Take off your heels in here (take off your heels in here)
It's gon' get real in here (on god)
So don't get killed in here (let's get it)

I got my pipe in here, I won't think twice in here
I'm shootin' everybody, even the
OT, I fly you here, what size shoe you wear?
Must be the pills talkin', can't lie, I'm high as hell
Where I'm from, you better not tell, where I'm from, it's dead or jail
Where I'm from, it's on that car, and watch out, there go 12
Where I'm from, it's hit or miss, and he got hit, he quick
Where I'm from, you lookin' stiff, then put him in a zip
Where I'm from, we smokin' him, that Tooka, man, be chokin' him
These hoes ain't shit gang, I'm fuckin' her, she to close him
She made a paragraph, she talkin' 'bout she was close to him
Hoes ain't shit, her baby daddy, she killed both of them

Why you walk like that?
Why you talk like that? (He told)
Why you move like that? (Let's get it)
Why you shoot like that? (He old)
Why you lack like that? (Yeah)
Why act like that? (Let's get it)
Why you fu like that? (Why you fu?)
You make the news like that (yeah)
See, I ain't built like that (let's go)
Bitch, you get killed like that (let's go)
My pockets gettin' big (let's get it)
Like uncle phil in there (Uncle Phil in there)
Who got the pills in here? (Who got the pills in there?)
Take off your heels in here (take off your heels in here)
It's gon' get real in here (on God)
So don't get killed in here (let's get it)
