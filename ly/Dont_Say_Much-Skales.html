		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The kind of life I was living back then
I reminisce but I never go there
I reminisce but I never de be
I reminisce but I never
I lost some family I'm still loosing friends
'Cause of the rules wey me I no bend
But then again me I don't pretend
Say me I send them never

Baby baby oh no no
I was living like an otondo
Always looking like an olodo
Like an artiste wey no get promo
I Dey ride solo
Baby morogo
They say follow person wey know road
I follow person back then I miss road
Free me free me make I dance konto
I don jogodo

Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
All I wana say is that they don't really care that much
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Pocket never empty take a look at my cup e Dey rush
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh

I want get money like Elon Musk
That's why I always don't say much
I get to work yeah

No Dey whine me o no Dey whine me o
This kind matter Dey precise o
For my mind o I go shine o
Bad energy I decline o
Friends and foe tried to spoil my show ah
Dey do me rigimanro ah 
Dem downplay my glow ah
But me I carry ogo oh oh

The kind of life I was living back then
I reminisce but I never go there
I reminisce but I never de be
I reminisce but I never
I lost some family I'm still loosing friends
'Cause of the rules wey me I no bend
But then again me I don't pretend
Say me I send them never

Baby baby oh no no
I was living like an otondo
Always looking like an olodo
Like an artiste wey no get promo
I Dey ride solo
Baby morogo

They say follow person wey know road
I follow person back then I miss road
Free me free me make I dance konto
I don jogodo

Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
All I wana say is that they don't really care that much
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Pocket never empty take a look at my cup e Dey rush
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh

I wan get money like Elon Musk
That's why I always don't say much
I get to work yeah
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
All I wana say is that they don't really care that much
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Pocket never empty take a look at my cup e Dey rush
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
I wan get money like Elon musk
That's why I always don't say much
I get to work yeah
