		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe this time
Maybe this time I'll outwit my past
I throw away the numbers, the keys
And all the cards
Maybe I can carve out a living in the cold
At the outskirts of some city
I'll extinguish all my recent pasts
Become another man again
And have a quiet life
A quiet life for me
A quiet life
A quiet life for me
A quiet life for someone
And a quiet life for me

I lost, I ran
I started once anew
In northern grey, in drizzling rain
In salted slush and bitter hale
But the order as always merciless
It wants to see me fail
So the hunter is now the hunted
Past voices call my name
I renounce my past to live again
A quiet life
A quiet life
A quiet life for me
A quiet life for someone
And a quiet life for me

I thought I have been given
Another chance again
But heaven lies as usual
I repented but in vain
It tries to cheat me out of my good aim
Take away what I never really got
My quiet life
No quiet life for me
No quiet life
No quiet life
No quiet life for me
A quiet life for someone
No quiet life for me

Even if I have to stray again
There is a life for me
A quiet life
A quiet life for me
A quiet life
