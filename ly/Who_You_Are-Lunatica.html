		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Frozen and broken
Don't know where you're going
Losing your identity
You're so caught up in hiding
But everybody sees

[Chorus]
You're never gonna feel
You're never gonna heal
You're never gonna know what's fake or real
'Til you know who you are
You're lying to your face
And running in a race
You're never gonna win 'til you find your place
And you know who you are

You're crawling and falling
But no one hears you calling
When you're in a world of glass
'Til your bubble bursts
And the true you's first
You're always coming last

[Chorus]

You take yourself apart
To medicate your pain
Why is it so hard
To believe in you again
