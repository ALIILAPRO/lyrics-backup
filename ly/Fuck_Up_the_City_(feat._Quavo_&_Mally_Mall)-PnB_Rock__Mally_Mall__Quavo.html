		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know
Ever since a young nigga
I was told to fuck up the city
You know what I mean
We came from the north
Put the city on our back, you know
Mally Mall
Migo

I got a vibe (vibe)
I feel alive (ayy)
I'm in the (in what?)
I'm in the sky (whew, whew)
I'm in the building
Bitches fuck with me (yeah)
Ass and titties (ayy)
Fuck up the tickets (fuck it up)
Fuck up the city

I'm 'bout to pull up and fuck it up
I'm 'bout to pull up and fuck it up
I'm 'bout to pull up and fuck it up
I'm 'bout to pull up, fuck up the city
I'm 'bout to pull up and fuck it up
I'm 'bout to pull up and fuck it up
I'm 'bout to pull up and fuck it up
I'm 'bout to pull up, fuck up the city (oh yeah)

I'm 'bout to pull up and fuck up the city
I got some shooters, you know that they with it
Bad lil' bitches and they tryna get busy
Don't call my phone if they ain't tryna get litty
Spent 30K 'cause I had to get drippy
Just one chain on my neck cost fifty (ice)
All these new blue hundreds, they crispy
Walk in the club and I got my glizzy
I push a button when I'm in the Lamb'
And that shit disappear like a ghost (skrrt)
I got the streets on my back, yeah
I'm fresh out the trap, I be givin' them hope (hope)
Spent ten bands on a coat (coat)
I probably won't ever see snow (snow)
Niggas drown with the wave, can you float? (Can you float?)
Why these lil' niggas so broke? (Huh?)
All this money out there, go get some
Nigga say he fucked my bitch, I'm like, "Which one?"
All these hoes out there, nigga, pick one
Stealin' my swag, yeah I'm where you get your drip from
You know I stay in designer, I don't need no stylist
They hit me when that new shit drop
Ridin' around Miami in the drop
Young nigga havin' this guap

I got a vibe (yeah, yeah)
I feel alive (ooh)
I'm in the (in what?)
I'm in the sky (in the sky)
I'm in the building (yeah)
Bitches fuck with me (yeah)
Ass and titties (ayy)
Fuck up the tickets (fuck it up)
Fuck up the city

I'm 'bout to pull up and fuck it up (fuck it up)
I'm 'bout to pull up and fuck it up (fuck it up)
I'm 'bout to pull up and fuck it up (fuck it up)
I'm 'bout to pull up, fuck up the city (yeah)
I'm 'bout to pull up and fuck it up (fuck it up)
I'm 'bout to pull up and fuck it up (fuck it up)
I'm 'bout to pull up and fuck it up (fuck it up)
I'm 'bout to pull up, fuck up the city (ayy)

Look in my eyes (ayy)
I'm in the skies (ayy)
I'm so alive (ayy)
I'm on the rise (yeah)
Monster in size (yeah)
I'm cookin' pies (uh)
I'm in the trap with the flies (trap it out)
I'm cookin' pies (uh)
I'm in the trap with the flies (trap it out)
We from the north (north)
They try to despise (who?)
We set the trend (trend)
They wanna know why (they wanna know why)
You wanna know why (yeah, let's go)
Want to know why
Icy boy, icy boy, icy boy (ice)
Trap off the iPhone and Android (brrt)
Fight me, boy, fight me, boy, fight me, boy (fight)
Pull up with choppers and Tonka toys (graw)
They like to say he a fun boy (fin)
They take your pack and then run, boy (run)
Migo Gang, yeah, I stand for it (gang)
If you get to the money, say "Chips Ahoy" (yeah)
I used to trap in my Concords (woo)
Now I'm doin' shows in my Tom Fords

I got a vibe (yeah, yeah)
I feel alive (ooh)
I'm in the (in what?)
I'm in the sky (in the sky)
I'm in the building (in the building)
Bitches fuck with me (bitches fuck with me)
Ass and titties (yeah)
Fuck up the tickets (fuck up the tickets)
Fuck up the city

I'm 'bout to pull up and fuck it up (fuck it up)
I'm 'bout to pull up and fuck it up (fuck it up)
I'm 'bout to pull up and fuck it up (fuck it up)
I'm 'bout to pull up, fuck up the city (yeah)
I'm 'bout to pull up and fuck it up (fuck it up)
I'm 'bout to pull up and fuck it up (fuck it up)
I'm 'bout to pull up and fuck it up (fuck it up)
I'm 'bout to pull up, fuck up the city (yeah)
