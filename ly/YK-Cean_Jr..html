		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never thought about a day that I'll be needin' more
Of this feelin' I can't hide it to you anymore
The way you look the way you move you heatin' up the floor
Babe you got that somethin' special knockin' on my door

Oh woah
Baby you know (baby you know)
Know I can't control (know I can't control)
Can't handle this feelin' babe
Stop teasin' me
No I ain't playin' games (ain't no playin' games)

See I just wanna let you know that I don't wanna see you go
Go ahead and leave me hangin' wishin' yearnin' for some more
I don't wanna lie gustong mahawakan palagi mga kamay (yeah)
Ang makasama ka 'di ko na mahihintay
So I should go I should go to you

Baby you know (baby you know)
Know I can't control (know I can't control)
Can't handle this feelin' babe
Stop teasin' me
No I ain't playin' games (ain't no playin' games)

Lately I can't go to sleep (uh)
Thinking 'bout you at night but honestly (uh)
Baby you're my remedy
For all the pain that's hurtin' me

Baby you know (baby you know)
Know I can't control hey (know I can't control)
Can't handle this feelin' babe (no I can't I can't I can't)
Stop teasin' me
No I ain't playin' games (ain't no playin' games)

Baby you know (baby you know)
Oh I can't control (know I can't control)
Can't handle this feelin' babe
Stop teasin' me
No I ain't playin' games (ain't no playin' games)
