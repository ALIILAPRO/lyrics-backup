		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say people talk about me.
You've heard rumours, you don't know what to believe.
Will you throw away tomorrow?
Oh just why can't you see,
It's not up to me
If I'm somebody's fantasy.

I know sometimes I'm just out there.
And I know sometimes I can flirt a bit too much.
But I also know I love you.
So just why can't you see,
It's not up to me
If I'm somebody's fantasy.
Oh no!

I took a ride on a fairytale just for you.
So why can't you just tryTo believe that they're tellin' lies about me.
And baby don't you cry!


Don't cry...

I don't know what else to say now.
I've been faithful, but I know how it could seem.
And I know that this is painful.
Oh but you've gotta learn
That it doesn't concern
Our love when others fancy me
Oh no!

I took a ride on a fairytale just for you.
So why can't you just tryTo believe that they're tellin' lies about me.
And baby don't you cry!


Don't cry...
