		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ain't nobody fuckin' with me like they used to
Open seat in the coupe so I scooped you
I get caught up in my thoughts and I can't think right
Caught up in a nightmare so I don't sleep right
I just want them to treat me like they used to, ayy
I just want somethin' real that I'm used to, yeah
I just want them to treat me like they, ayy, ayy
I just want somethin' real that I'm, yeah, yeah

Went from no one to someone, at least I thought so
Stuck up in a bad dream watchin' front row
People warnin' me that everything is gonna change
Never thought that it would be in the worst way
Life goin' up and goin' down at the same time
Suicidal thoughts creepin' up in my mind
Drug dealer pocket reapin' the benefits
Only thing I fuckin' had to get me through this shit
I been stripped of all I had, man
Lost relations with me dad, damn
Lost relations with the fam, damn
Lost touch of who I am, sad
I'm out seekin' peace like I'm seekin' air to breathe
Pray to a God that I never thought I would believe
Grant me serenity for all the things I cannot change
Wisdom to know that I can ain't the same

Ain't nobody fuckin' with me like they used to
Open seat in the coupe so I scooped you
I get caught up in my thoughts and I can't think right
Caught up in a nightmare so I don't sleep right
I just want them to treat me like they used to
I just want somethin' real that I'm used to
I just want them to treat me like they
I just want somethin' real that I'm, yeah

All my life I been waitin' 'til the time right
Waitin' for that shade of light to make me shine bright
Day turn to night, yeah, weeks turn to months
Wishin' I could press that pause button just once
Hidin' in the back tryna catch up to the front
Everything I lack, I'll make up for it when I stunt
More bitches more money, more drugs more honeys
More stuff the more I want it 'em, the more I feel I'm fuckin' stuck
(I get by) goin' through the motions, fuckin' barely even growin'
(I get high) hidin' all of my emotions, never change, I'm stuck posted
(I get by) what a lame excuse to keep doin' what I do
(I get high) wastin' my shine and that's the fuckin' truth
