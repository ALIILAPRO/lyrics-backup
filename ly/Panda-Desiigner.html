		<p>
		  This they all been waiting for
I guess so
They waiting for this **** for a long time didn't they

Panda, Panda
Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda

I got broads in Atlanta
Twisting dope, lean, and the Fanta
Credit cards and scammers
Hitting off licks in the bando
Black X6, Phantom
White X6 looks like a panda
Going out like I'm Montana
Hundred killers, hundred hammers
Black X6, Phantom
White X6, panda
Pockets swole, Danny
Selling bar, candy
Man I'm the mocho like Randy
The choppa go Oscar for Grammy
***** ***** pull up ya panty
Hope you killas understand me

I got broads in Atlanta
Twisting dope, lean, and the Fanta
Credit cards and scammers
Hitting off licks in the bando
Black X6, Phantom
White X6 looks like a panda
Going out like I'm Montana
Hundred killers, hundred hammers
Black X6, Phantom
White X6, panda
Pockets swole, Danny
Selling bar, candy
Man I'm the mocho like Randy
The choppa go Oscar for Grammy
***** ***** pull up ya panty
Hope you killas understand me

Panda, Panda
Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda

I got broads in Atlanta
Twisting dope, lean, and ***, sipping Fanta
Credit cards and the scammers
Wake up Versace ****, life Desiigner
Whole bunch of lavish ****
They be asking 'round town who be clappin' ****
I be pullin' up stuff in the Phantom ship
I got plenty of stuff of Bugatti whip look how I drive this ****
Black X6, Phantom
White X6, killing on camera
Pop a Perc, I can't stand up
Gorilla, they come and kill you with bananas
Four fillas, they finna pull up in the Phantom
Know ******, they come and kill you on the camera
Big Rollie, it dancing bigger than a Pandie
Go Oscar for Grammy, ***** pull up your panty
Fill up I'mma flip it, I got ****** pull up and they get it
I got ***** that counting for digits
Say you make you a lot of new money
Know some killas pull off and they in the Wraith
CTD, they pull off and they kill the Bape
Call up Phillip-Phillip, gone fill the bank
****** up in the bank we gone drill the bank
**** we gone kill the bank, get it
I got broads, yea I get it
I get cars yea I ******
This how I live it
Did it all for a ticket
Now Flex drop bombs when he spin it
And Bobby gone trend it
Jeff The Don doing business
Zana Ray ******* up **** and she doin' her bidnezz
I be getting to the chicken
Counting to the chicken
And all of my ****** gone spilt it

Panda, Panda
Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda

I got broads in Atlanta
Twisting dope, lean, and the Fanta
Credit cards and scammers
Hitting off licks in the bando
Black X6, Phantom
White X6 looks like a panda
Going out like I'm Montana
Hundred killers, hundred hammers
Black X6, Phantom
White X6, panda
Pockets swole, Danny
Selling bar, candy
Man I'm the mocho like Randy
The choppa go Oscar for Grammy
***** ***** pull up ya panty
Hope you killas understand me

I got broads in Atlanta
Twisting dope, lean, and the Fanta
Credit cards and scammers
Hitting off licks in the bando
Black X6, Phantom
White X6 looks like a panda
Going out like I'm Montana
Hundred killers, hundred hammers
Black X6, Phantom
White X6, panda
Pockets swole, Danny
