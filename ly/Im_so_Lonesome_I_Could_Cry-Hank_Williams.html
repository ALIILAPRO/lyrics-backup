		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whinin' low
I'm so lonesome, I could cry
I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawlin' by
The moon just went behind the clouds
To hide its face and cry

Instrumental


Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves begin to die?
Like me, he's lost the will to live
I'm so lonesome, I could cry

Instrumental

The silence of a fallin' star
Lights up a purple sky
cnd as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome, I could cry
