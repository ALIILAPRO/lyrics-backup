		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whiskey River take my mind
Don't let her memory torture me
Whiskey River don't run dry
You're all I got, take care of me

Whiskey River take my mind
Don't let her memory torture me
Whiskey River don't run dry
You're all I've got, take care of me

I'm drowning in a whiskey river
Bathin' my memory and mind in the wetness of its soul
Feeling the amber current flowin' from my mind
And leavin' a heart you left so cold

Whiskey River take my mind
And don't let her memory torture me
Whiskey River don't run dry
You're all I got, take care of me

I'm drowning in a whiskey river
Bathin' my memory and mind in the wetness of its soul
Feeling the amber current flowin' from my mind
And leaving a heart you left so cold

Whiskey River take my mind (take my mind)
And don't let her memory torture me
Whiskey River don't run dry
You're all I got, take care of me

Whiskey River take my mind
Whiskey River take my mind
