		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bag lady you gone hurt your back
Dragging all them bags like that
I guess nobody ever told you
All you must hold onto, is you, is you, is you

One day all them bags gon' get in your way
One day all them bags gon' get in your way
I said one day all them bags gon' get in your way
One day all them bags gon' get in your way, so pack light,
Pack light, mm, pack light, pack light, oh ooh

Bag lady you gon' miss your bus
You can't hurry up, 'cause you got too much stuff
When they see you coming, niggas take off running
From you it's true, oh yes they do

One day he gon' say you crowding my space
One day he gon' say you crowding my space
I said one day he gon' say you crowding my space
One day he gon' say you crowding my space so, pack light
Pack light, mm, pack light, pack light, ooh ooh

Girl I know, sometimes it's hard and we can't let go
Oh when someone hurts you oh so bad inside
You can't deny it you can't stop crying
So oh, oh, oh, if you start breathin' babe
You won't believe it, it feels so much better, so much better baby
Bag lady, let it go let it go let it go let it go oh
Girl you don't need it
Bet ya love could make it better
Bet ya love can make it better
Bet ya love can make it better, need someone to love you right
Bet ya love can make it better
Bet ya love I bet ya love I bet ya
Bet ya love can make it better, baby baby
Bet ya love can make it better
Bet ya love can make it better, hey hey
Bet ya love can make it better,
I bet ya love I bet you love
Bet ya love can make it better
I bet ya love I bet you love, oh oh oh (Bet ya love can make it better)
Bet ya love can make it better (oh oh oh oh)
Bet ya love can make it better
Bag lady, let it go let it go let it go let it go oh
Yeah you don't need it
