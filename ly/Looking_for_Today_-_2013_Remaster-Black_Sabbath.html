		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's complete but obsolete
All tomorrow's become yesterday
In demand but second hand
It's been heard before you even play

Up to date but came too late
Better get yourself another name
You're so right but overnight
You're the one who has to take the blame

Everyone just gets on top of you
The pain begins to eat your pride
You can't believe in anything you knew
When was the last time that you cried

Don't delay you're in today
But tomorrow is another dream
Sunday's star is Monday's scar
Out of date before you're even seen

At the top so quick to flop
You're so new but rotting in decay
Like butterfly so quick to die
But you're only looking for today

Everyone just gets on top of you
The pain begins to eat your pride
You can't believe in anything you knew
When was the last time that you cried
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today

Listen, glamour trip so soon to slip
Easy come but oh how quick it goes
Ten foot tall but what to fall
Hard to open yet so easy to close
Front page news but so abused
You just want to hide yourself away
Over-paid, but soon you fade
Because you're only looking for today

Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
