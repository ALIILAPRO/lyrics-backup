		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey fellas have you heard the news?
You know that Annie's back in town?
It won't take long just watch and see
How the fellas lay their money down

Her style is new but the face is the same
As it was so long ago
But from her eyes a different smile
Like that of one who knows

Well it's been ten years and maybe more
Since I first set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by
Here I am alone and blue

Some people cry and some people die
By the wicked ways of love
But I'll just keep on rollin' along
With the grace of the Lord above

People talkin' all around 'bout the way you left me flat
I don't care what the people say, I know where their jive is at
One thing I do have on my mind, if you can clarify please do
It's the way you call me by another guy's name when I try to make love to you, yeah

I try to make love but it ain't no use
Give it to me, give it

Work so hard I couldn't unwind
Get some money saved
Abuse my love a thousand times
However hard I tried

Heartbreaker, your time has come
Can't take your evil way
Go away heartbreaker
Heartbreaker
Heartbreaker
Heart
