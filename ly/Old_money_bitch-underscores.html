		  I've got a question for you

See the girl against the wall with her head turned down?
Why don't you ch-check her pedigree?
She's not like you or me (uh-huh), she's the enemy (hmm, let's see)
That girl's a student-athlete but she's never played a sport
Her parents had a seven-figure wedding and divorce
She's stolen from the CVS but her daddy's on the board
It's gotta be
'Cause she's an old money bitch

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I'm an old money bitch
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I'm an old money bitch

She's the daughter of a billionaire
She's the daughter of a billionaire
You wouldn't know it by her disposition
'Cause she comes back around, she comes back around
She's the daughter of a billionaire
She's the daughter of a billionaire
Why don't we all be on our best behavior
When she comes back around, she comes back around?

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I'm an old money bitch

After Sarah's sweet nineteen, we had our first big fight
She was like, "We live ideal lives
And you don't realize, trust me, I know what it's like" (whatever)
Head to toe in second-hand Forever 21
She cuts her hair herself and then she dyes it in the tub
She bought her car on Craigslist but she used to take the bus
It's gotta be
'Cause she's an old money bitch

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I'm an old money bitch
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I'm an old money bitch

She's the daughter of a billionaire
She's the daughter of a billionaire
You wouldn't know it by her disposition
'Cause she comes back around, she comes back around
She's the daughter of a billionaire
She's the daughter of a billionaire
Why don't we all be on our best behavior
When she comes back around, she comes
(Back, back, back it up)

I-I don't think you get it
She gets it from her father's father's father
I-I don't think you get it
She can't hide it any longer, longer, longer
I-I don't think you get it
She gets it from her father's father's father
I-I don't think you get it
Mm, you're the one hiding, hiding

I know you're here somewhere
Don't hide from us, we're not gonna hurt you
There's nothing to be afraid of
Did you know your parents are on Wikipedia?
Your dad is an accomplished man, really
Like, to see all the things he's done for our country?
And I know you went to that school in, like, D.C
The one the president's kids go to
So, like, how'd you end up here?
Money troubles? (stop)
(Come over here, hello?)
(There you are, back off)
One, two, three (good luck)

She's the daughter of a billionaire
She's the daughter of a billionaire
Why don't we all be on our best behavior
When she comes back around, she comes back around?
(She comes back around, she comes back around) la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I'm an old money bitch
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I'm an old money bitch
