		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lovely
Some things are getting pretty fucking ugly
And I'm thinking it's the best if you don't want me
I got this beating in my chest that keeps on thumping
Inside
It's the tone
Your eyes
The blood rushing your soul
Disguise
The anger and control
Goodnight
I can feel it in your heart
Feel it in your heart

You try to break to my wings apart
And I don't know if it's so safe to
Stay in this consuming place
Where we keep hurting ourselves
You try to tell me that I'm wrong
And I keep choking on your name
We're so addicted to this game
But we keep hurting ourselves

Like the light the angels flying down
I wanna hear your voice
But you're nowhere around me
You're nowhere around
You're nowhere around
You're nowhere around
You're nowhere around

You try to break to my wings apart
And I don't know if it's so safe to
Stay in this consuming place
Where we keep hurting ourselves
You try to tell me that I'm wrong
And I keep choking on your name
We're so addicted to this game
But we keep hurting ourselves

We're so addicted to this game
But we keep hurting ourselves

Like the light the angels flying down
I wanna hear your voice
But you're nowhere around me
No one around me
Nowhere around
Nowhere around
