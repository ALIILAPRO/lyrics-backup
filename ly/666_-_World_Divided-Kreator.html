		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All my life I`ve believed in nothing but myself
Through my eyes I have seen heaven I`ve seen hell
All my life I have been the one stigmatized
Know that I
I will not believe holy lies

Diversity Integrity - nailed to the crucifix
Loyalty Unity - In our hearts it still exits

The world is in flames
The people divided
Bring back the fire inside
The world is in flames
But we are united
Under 666 burning in the sky

All my life the weak bestow blood upon your sword
Through these eyes I have seen the slaughter of the lost
All my life I fight and resist deviate
Know that I
Realized your dying truth is fake

Perversity Slavery       - In the name of the crucifix
Absurdity Atrocity   - We won`t let it come to this

The world is in flames
The people divided
Bring back the fire inside
The world is in flames
But we are united
Under 666 burning in the sky

Let it Burn!

We are united
United in a world divided.

The world is in flames
They keep us divided
Bring back the fire inside
The world is in flames
But we are united
Under 666 burning in the sky
A world divided
We are united
Under 666 burning in the sky
