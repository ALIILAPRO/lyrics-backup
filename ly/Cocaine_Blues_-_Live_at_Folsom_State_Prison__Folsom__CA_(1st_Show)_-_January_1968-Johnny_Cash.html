		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Early one morning while makin' the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my baby down
I shot her down then I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' forty-four beneath my head

Woke up next morning and I grabbed that gun
I took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
The overtook me down in Juarez Mexico

In the hot joint takin' the pill
There walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down
Yes so my name's is Billy Lee
If you've got a warrant you better read it to me
I shot her down 'cause she made me sore
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more

When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They threw me on a freight train and hauled me back
Had no friend who'd go my bail
They stuck my dried-up carcass in the county jail

Early next morning 'round half past nine
I saw the sheriff comin' down the line
That sheriff yelled as he cleared his throat
Said come on you dirty hackin' to the district court

Into the courtroom my trial began
Where I was judged by twelve honest men
Yes as the jury started walkin' out
I saw that little judge commence to look about
In about five minutes then walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree
I shouted Lordy Lordy please have mercy on me

The judge he smiled when he picked up his pen
Ninety-nine years in the San Quentin Penn
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
But I can't forget that day I shot that bad bitch down
Come on you hotheads you listen to me
Stay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be
