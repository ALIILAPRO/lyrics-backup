		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, them boy better get out this street 'cause they know how we play it 
Check me then I'm runnin' him down (runnin' him down)
I don't need a drop, 'cause I know where he stay at
From a lil' bitch that was toppin' him down (yeah, yeah)
I got the jewel like I'm Vicks if your bitch have the hiccups
I'm stabbin' my dick in her mouth
Twenty-some' K when I crack me a smile
My grandma say, "Boy, you no longer a child"
Come on, hit from the back, smack her booty
Call me Trump, grab her coochie (grab her coochie)
Dr. Miami did her boobies, thick as a Bible, hallelujah ('lujah)
Sluttin' her out, know how I do it
Pussy be drippin', like car fluid (car fluid)
That ain't my bitch, tell her she blew it
I got that big head a ho like Stewie (like Stewie)
If he get close then I'm backin' him up
I pay my sins for a minute, I don't give a fuck (brrt)
Took me a loss, now they addin' me up
You had counted me out, man just keep it a buck
Straight on the nigga, not dappin' you up
If you reach for my hand then we packin' you up (brrt)
I got a feelin', if I know what's up, you settin' me up, then we sendin' you up (brrrt)
Come on, reach for my chain, do what massa used to do in them days (woah)
Whip 'em, flip 'em, air lift 'em, Migo, get 'em, Skippa Da Flippa
Shakin' 'em down, that boy a stripper (stripper)
This is the life of a Grape Street Cripper
Keep on your pants, give me them grippers (grip, grip, grip)
If she suck dick good, I gotta tip her
She call me Baba (Baba)
She grippin' the sheets while I'm grippin' the chopper (come on)
Ain't trustin' no thot thot (thot thot), yeah, know she a opp
But her pussy aqua (come on), if she send the drop (drop)
Wait 'til they pop up, and then they get shot up, yeah (brrt)
I know the plot (plot), but plot twist I'ma shoot (brrt) 'til it lock up
Still tippin', water whippin', dance, digit, go 250
You talkin' down on me, tell them boys, get up with me
They havin' secret smoke, bring it to light
Niggas just said, yeah, two C Grape, I'm like Lil Baby (come on)
C Grape to me like Ced
Damn, they thought I lost it (thought I lost)
Them boys ranned off with my style
Had to get a whole another wave, now I'm back on it
Them boys pissed in the toilet, hmm, they ain't really even on shit
Same nigga said I wasn't this and then I headshotted his homie (brrt)
Baow, another one, baow, another one, baow
I ain't know he was dead but God did (God did)
My lil' nigga fifteen, he'll lay on your house, I call him the spy kid (spy kid)
I wanna get active (hmm), tired of speakin' on the work that I put in
So spin, spin, sp- come on spin, spin, spin, spin
Third gen, FN, evil twin, sin, sin, Perc' 10 with the fin (ha, woo)
Blow like wind, Ben 10, I changed, man
Fin, fin, fin, fin, thought I was done but I did it again (brrt)
