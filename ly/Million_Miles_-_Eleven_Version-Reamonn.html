		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To walk this streets without you 
I hate being on my own 
So many souls around you 
But it never feels like home 
Home is where my heart is aching 
Home 

Home is where there's no mistaking 
All this space between us 
Isn't going anywhere 
But it's ok to be us 
Cause your far from being here 
Here is where the sky gets lonely 
Here 
Here I disappear 

I'm a million miles from you 
But if we hold on 
Gotta hold on 
I'm a million miles from you 
But if we stay strong 
I know we'll make it through 

All this time is passing 
But every day's the same 
So much shadow casting 
I don't wanna place the blame 
Cause the blame is just a mixed emotion 
Blame 
Blame it on the fear 

I'm a million miles from you 
But if we hold on 
Gotta hold on 
I'm a million miles from you 
But if we stay strong 
I know we'll make it through 

Now the distance alone can change us 
I've been lying to myself 
It's the moments apart that make us 
See who we both really are 

When I'm a million miles from you 
But if we hold on 
Gotta hold on 
I'm a million miles from you 
But if we stay strong 
I know we'll make it through 

I know we'll see it through 
I'm a million miles from you 
But if we stay strong 
I know we'll make it through 
I'm a million miles from you 
I know we'll make it through 
Gotta stay strong 
Gotta be strong 
You're a million miles away
