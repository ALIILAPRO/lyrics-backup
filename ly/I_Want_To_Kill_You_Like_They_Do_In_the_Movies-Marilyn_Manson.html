		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna fuck you like a foreign film
And there's no subtitles to get you through this
And I'm a country you don't ever ever ever ever ever
Want to visit again

Line up,
Roll camera,
You pretend
I'll pretend
And cut, cut, cut
Cut, cut, cut
Line up,
Roll camera,
You pretend
I'll pretend
And cut, cut, cut

I want to kill you like they do in the movies
But don't worry there's another one just like you in line

I want to kill you like they do in the movies
But don't worry there's another one just like you in line

Line up,
Roll camera,
You pretend
I'll pretend
And cut, cut, cut
Line up,
Roll camera,
You pretend
I'll pretend
And cut, cut, cut, cut

I'm a strip, strip, strip, and
I flicker, flick, flick, flick
A flicker of celluloid
And there's holes, holes, holes
In my everything
I'm a strip, strip, strip, and
I flicker, flick, flick, flick
A flicker of celluloid
And there's holes, holes, holes
In my everything

You're just what I projected
Just what I projected
It's just what I projected
Just want to project it

Come in, come in, come in,
Come in, come in, come in, come inside

There's so much, much, much more skin to break
I haven't even taken off my gloves,
There's so much, much, much more skin to break
I haven't even taken off my gloves

I feel a little sorry baby,
I feel a little sorry baby,
I hear the afterlife is poorly scored
I feel a little sorry baby,
I feel a little sorry baby,
I hear the afterlife is poorly scored

You're lucky you don't have to wake up
Sick, sick, sick, sick
I'm sick of immortality,
I'm sick of immortality
I'm sick of immortality

I was only acting, baby
Only acting, baby
You were only acting, baby
Overacting, baby

Don't confuse it with love
Don't confuse it with love
Don't confuse it with love
Don't confuse it with love

Everytime I kill you I'm really just killing myself
Everytime I kill you I'm really just killing myself
Everytime I kill you I'm really just killing myself

Don't flatter yourself, don't flatter yourself

This is business not pleasure, baby
This is business not pleasure, baby
This business of pleasure, baby
Business not pleasure, baby
This is business
This is business

I want to kill you like they do in the movies
But don't worry there's another one just like you, standing in line
I want to kill you like they do in the movies
But don't worry there's another one just like you, standing in line

Line up,
Roll camera,
You pretend
I'll pretend
And cut, cut, cut
