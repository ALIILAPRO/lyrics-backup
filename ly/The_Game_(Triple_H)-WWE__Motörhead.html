		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's time to play the game
Time to play the game! Hahaha

It's all about the game and how you play it.
All about control and if you can take it.
All about your debt and if you can pay it.
It's all about pain and who's gonna make it.

I am the game, you don't want to play me.
I am control, no way you can change me.
I am heavy debt, no way you can pay me.
I am the pain and I know you can't take me.

Look over your shoulder, ready to run.
Like a good little bitch, from a smokin gun.
I am the game and I make the rules.
So move on out here and die like a fool.
Try to figure out what my move's gonna be.
Come on over sucker, why don't you ask me?
Don't you forget that the price you can pay
Cause I am the game and I want to play

It's time to play the game, hahaha
Time to play the game!

It's all about the game and how you play it.
It's all about control and if you can take it.
It's all about your debt and if you can pay it.
It's all about pain and who's gonna make it.

I am the game, you don't want to play me.
I am control, there's no way you can change me.
I am your debt, and you know you can't pay me.
I am your pain and I know you can't take me.

Play the game
Your gonna be the same
Your gonna change your name
Your gonna die in flames

Hahaha
Time to play the game!
It's time to play the game
It's time to play the game
It's time to play the game
Time to play the game! Hahaha
