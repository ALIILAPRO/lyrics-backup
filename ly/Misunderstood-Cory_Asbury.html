		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Beautiful mind
There's magic still behind those sunken eyes
You're not the sum of all your thoughts inside
Still a song within the ashes of your life

Beautiful mind
Daddy always said you'd be a star
The things you do don't make you who you are
It's easy to fall when the bar is set too high

You're broken
And anyone who says they're not is lying
Maybe we all got too good at hiding
You never did the things they said you should
I'm sorry you were so misunderstood

Beautiful mind
God knows you've been holding on so tight
I'm sure you've got a million reasons why
But don't be scared to let things fall apart
The deepest cuts don't heal without a scar

'Cause you're broken
And anyone who says they're not is lying
Maybe we all got too good at hiding
You never did the things they said you should
I'm sorry you were so misunderstood

You're broken
And anyone who says they're not is lying
Maybe we all just got too good at hiding
You never did the things they said you should
I'm sorry you were so misunderstood
