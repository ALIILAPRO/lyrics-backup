		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Seven hours since you went away
11 coffees
Ricki Lake on play
But late at night
When I'm feeling blue
I'd sell my ass before I'd think of you
Seven hours since you closed the door
Started a diet, got a manicure
Erased your number from the telephone
And if you call me I won't be at home
He said

Why don't you cry
For the guy?
Said goodbye
Run away
Why'd you cry
For the guy?
Said goodbye
I said OK
Cause

Ooh boy d'ya miss me like a hole in the head?
Because I do boy
And it's cool boy and
Ooh betcha never thought I'd get out of bed
Because of you boy
Such a fool boy

11 hours on a brand new day
I'm getting ready to go out and play
It's late at night
I'm caught in a groove
I'll kiss my ass before I'm feeling blue
Seven hours what you calling for
A bunch of flowers
And I'll slam the door
You're in my face
Sorry what's your name
Takes more than begging
To reverse my brain

Ooh boy d'ya miss me like a hole in the head?
Because I do boy
And it's cool boy and
Ooh betcha never thought I'd get out of bed
Because of you boy
Such a fool boy

Through with it
Over it
Not having it
This crazy shit
Been feeling this
Indelicate
No more, no more
I'm through with it
Not having it
This crazy shit
Not feeling it
Can't deal with it
No more of it
No more, no more

Breaking off the brunt
Brand new day has just begun
Just because you made me go "ooh"
Doesn't mean I'm running with you
Don't you dare tear back
Can't you see I won't take that
I ain't crying now over you
Better free your head up
Like  I told you

Why don't you cry
For the guy?
Said goodbye
Run away
Why don't you cry
For the guy?
Said goodbye
I said OK
Cause

Ooh boy d'you miss me like a hole in the head?
Because I do boy
And it's cool boy and
Ooh betcha never thought I'd get out of bed
Because of you boy
Such a fool boy
(Such a fool)

Ooh boy d'you miss me like a hole in the head?
(A hole in the head)
Because I do boy
(I do)
And it's cool boy and
(It's cool)
Ooh betcha never thought I'd get out of bed
(Get out of bed)
Because of you boy
(Because I do boy)
Such a fool boy
(Such a fool)

Run away
I said OK cause
Run away
