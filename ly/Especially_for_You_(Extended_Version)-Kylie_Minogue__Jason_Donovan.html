		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Especially for you
I want to let you know what I was going through
All the time we were apart
I thought of you
You were in my heart
My love never changed
I still feel the same

Especially for you
I want to tell you I was feeling that way too
And if dreams were wings, you know
I would have flown to you
To be where you are
No matter how far
And now that I'm next to you

No more dreaming about tomorrow
Forget the loneliness and the sorrow
I've got to say
It's all because of you

And now we're back together, together
I want to show you my heart is oh so true
And all the love I have is
Especially for you

Especially for you
I want to tell you, you mean all the world to me
How I'm certain that our love was meant to be
You changed my life
You showed me the way
And now that I'm next to you

I've waited long enough to find you
I want to put all the hurt behind you
Oh,
And I want to bring out all the love inside you
Oh

And now we're back together, together
I want to show you my heart is oh so true
And all the love I have is
Especially for you

You were in my heart
My love never changed

And now we're back together, together
I want to show you my heart is oh so true
And all the love I have is
Especially for you

Together, together
I want to show you my heart is oh so true
And all the love I have is
Especially for you

Together, together
I want to show you my heart is oh so true
And all the love I have is
Especially
