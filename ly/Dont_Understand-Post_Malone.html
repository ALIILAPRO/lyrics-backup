		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a rolling stone
It took you by surprise
You're hangin' onto something, anything
Just like a shimmer of light
Oh, how the sword, it fell
I said, "You're really something, everything
To me, and I'm cold
So hold me closer, baby"

I don't understand why you like me so much
'Cause I don't like myself
I don't understand why you like me so much
Wish I was someone else
You say you got a million reasons
But I can't think of one
I don't understand how you like me so much
'Cause I don't like myself, mm-mm

I'll build a church for you
They'll come from miles around
Girl, you're really something, everything
To me, and I'm cold
So hold me closer, baby

I don't understand how you like me so much
'Cause I don't like myself
I don't understand how you like me so much
Wish I was someone else
You say you got a million reasons
But I can't think of one
I don't understand how you like me so much
'Cause I don't like myself, mm-mm, mm-mm
