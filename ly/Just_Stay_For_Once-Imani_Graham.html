		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know your lines
You'll say you're fine when you're not, and I get it
Been traveling for miles
Passing signs all you want now we're sitting
All of the time, we'll talk, but you won't go and say it
Rolling your eyes
You're ready to cry
Why is it all that hard for you to let someone in
I know that you've been hurt before, I know what is
You're afraid to get too close, and you're afraid that you did
What a goddamn lie it is going over again, so
What are you so afraid of
You love but choose to run
Look at the mess you're made of
Just choose to stay for once
Just choose to stay for once
Just choose to stay for once
Why is it all that hard for you to let someone in
I know that you've been hurt before, I know what is
You're afraid to get too close, and you're afraid that you did
What a goddamn lie it is going over again
It's on your mind
I can tell when you smile, and I see it
You think you're disguised
Cause that's how's it been from beginning
Just wanted to listen, it's between us position
We can drive all night if that means you'd permit it but
You're ready to cry
Why is it all that hard for you to let someone in
I know that you've been hurt before, I know what is
You're afraid to get too close, and you're afraid that you did
What a goddamn lie it is going over again, so
What are you so afraid of
You love but choose to run
Look at the mess you're made of
Just choose to stay for once
Just choose to stay for once
Why is it all that hard for you to let someone in
I know that you've been hurt before, I know what is
You're afraid to get too close, and you're afraid that you did
What a goddamn lie it is going over again
What are you so afraid of
I can't let someone in
I know the shit your made of
Just right down to the end
What are you so afraid of
I know you wanna run
But won't you
Just choose to stay for once
Just choose to stay for once
Just choose to stay for once
Why is it all that hard for you to let someone in
I know that you've been hurt before, I know what is
You're afraid to get too close, and you're afraid that you did
What a goddamn lie it is going over again
Just choose to stay for once
