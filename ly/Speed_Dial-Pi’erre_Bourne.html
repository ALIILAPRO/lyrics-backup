		  Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?

Damn, life crazy
Damn, life crazy
Damn, life crazy
Damn, life crazy
I just called my grandma, I told her I made it
I just got my money up, and now I'm baby
Yeah, she call me daily
Yeah, she call me daily
I just got my money up, she acting crazy
Yeah, she call me daily
Yeah, she call me daily

Sex so good, thought it was love
Couldn't keep up, I came in second place
I didn't know this was a race
All the time that I waste
Now you got sorry all on your face
But you don't really feel me
You ain't really trynna build with
You know I got these millions
I'm hip to all your games
You're like an arcade
I got cheat codes for the dough
My life is GTA
(Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)

Damn, life crazy
Damn, life crazy
Damn, life crazy
Damn, life crazy, ay

I just got my money up, and now I'm baby
Yeah, she call me daily
Yeah, she call me daily
I just got my money up, she acting crazy
Yeah, she call me daily
Yeah, she call me daily

Ay, yeah, she wonder how I've been
But all my money Ben, yeah, 'jamin Franklin, ay
Got her wide open (ay), like a lane is (ay)
Had her mouth open (ay), man, I miss her lips (ay)
Bet she miss my tip (ay), wait 'til I get rich
Yeah, you still taking orders, yeah, I told you wait on me (ay)
Now you gotta listen all the time when you don't wanna (ay)
Now you hearing, "Yo Pi'erre," when you wake up in the morning

Damn, life crazy
Damn, life crazy
Damn, life crazy
Damn, life crazy
I just called my grandma, I told her I made it
I just got my money up, and now I'm baby
Yeah, she call me daily
Yeah, she call me daily
I just got my money up, she acting crazy
Yeah, she call me daily
Yeah, she call me daily

Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?
