		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She say it's only for me
While she drop it low dressed in all white
Not tryna fall in love yeah
But she about to show me just what I like

My favorite part
Damn she picking up the pace for the both of us
Ain't too far
Watch her do it with no hands, just to show it off

She ain't the type just to give it all up
I'mma call that lucky
She a good girl but with me she bad as fuck
She about to turn up
When she on it, yeah
There's no stopping
Oh she got it from the waist down

Watch her throw it back
I'mma own that
Yeah she got it from the waist, she ain't riding slow

Watch her throw it back
I'mma own that
Yeah she got it from the waist, she ain't riding slow

Yeah, we ain't running low
We ain't running low
Yeah, we ain't running low
We ain't running low

She say it's only for me
While she drop it low dressed in all white
Not tryna fall in love yeah
But she about to show me just what I like

Said she don't like to be lonely
That's why she keep telling me don't leave
And I don't stop her when she's all on me
I can't wait to get her on her knees, yeah

She ain't the type just to give it all up
I'mma call that lucky
She a good girl but with me she bad as fuck
She about to turn up
When she on it, yeah
There's no stopping
Oh she got it from the waist down

Watch her throw it back
I'mma own that
Yeah she got it from the waist, she ain't riding slow

Watch her throw it back
I'mma own that
Yeah she got it from the waist, she ain't riding slow

Yeah, we ain't running low
We ain't running low
Yeah, we ain't running low
We ain't running low

Watch her throw it back
I'mma own that
Yeah she got it from the waist, she ain't riding slow

Watch her throw it back
I'mma own that
Yeah she got it from the waist, she ain't riding slow

Yeah, we ain't running low
(Said we ain't) we ain't running low
Yeah, said we ain't running low
We ain't running low

She say it's only for me
While she drop it low dressed in all white
Not tryna fall in love yeah
But she about to show me just what I like
