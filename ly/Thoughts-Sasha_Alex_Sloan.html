		  Thoughts
Sometimes, I just can't control my thoughts
No medication's ever made them stop
All I think about is everything I'm not
Instead of everything I got

'Cause I'm scared they're all laughing, so I make the joke first
If I beat 'em to the punchline, then I can't get hurt
Yeah, I swear to God I'm trying, but I don't know how to be
How to be a good friend to me

'Cause sometimes I just feel like I'm a freak
When I wake up, I just don't like what I see
All the way from my head right down to my feet
I wish that I thought differently

But I'm scared they're all laughing, so I make the joke first
If I beat 'em to the punchline, then I can't get hurt
Yeah, I swear to God I'm trying, but I don't know how to be
How to be a good friend to me

Change
Wonder if I'll ever really change, mm

'Cause I'm scared they're all laughing, so I make the joke first
If I beat 'em to the punchline, then I can't get hurt
Yeah, I swear to God I'm trying, but I don't know how to be
How to be a good friend to
The voice inside my head that's telling me I'm okay
Entertain it for a second, then I push it away
Yeah, I swear to God I'm trying, but I don't know how to be
How to be a good friend to me

Thoughts
Sometimes, I just can't control my thoughts
