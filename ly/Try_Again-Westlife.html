		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hush now don't you cry, 

There will be a better day 

I promise you. 

We can work it out 

But only if you let me know 

What's on your mind 



Baby, I thought it was forever 

Through any kind of weather 

But some day you will find what you're searching for 



Try again, 

Never stop believing,

Try again 

Don't give up on your love. 

Stumble and fall 

It's the heart of it all 

When you fall down (down) 

Just try again 



So lie down let it go 

Hey you will never be alone 

I promise you 

If you can't fight the feeling (oh yeah) 

Surrender in you heart 

Remember; love will set you free 



Baby, I thought it was forever 

You would always be together 

But some day you will find what you're searching for 



Try again (try again)

Never stop believing 

Try again 

Don't give up on your love 

Stumble and fall 

It's the heart of it all 

So when you fall down (down) 

Just try again 



Baby when a heart is crying 

It's sometimes feels like dying 

The tear drops fall like rain 



Baby I thought it was forever 

You would always be together 

But some day you will find what you're searching for 



Try again 

Never stop believing (oh no) 

Try Again 

Don't give up on your love (dont give up on your love baby) 



Try again (just try again) 

Never stop believing (yeeahh) 

Try again 

Don't give up on your love 

Stumble and fall 

It's the heart of it all 

When you fall down 

Just try again
