		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My lover is sleeping
Here on the floor,
Where is he drifting?
Oh I wonder where he'll go?

Oh, I don't know
Oh, I don't know

Is he dreaming of a paradise?
Somewhere in the distance we could go to hide away?
No one to tell us what to do or say...

Oh, I don't know
Oh, I don't know

It's two in the morning,
He's still asleep.
Where is he going?
Oh I wonder where he is?

Oh, I don't know
Oh, I don't know

I'm falling under your love,
Can't forget the way it was
When you held me
When you cared, oh...

You raise the sky above me,
You save the sunlight from the rain,
Won't you stay? 
Won't you stay with me

My lover is sleeping 
Here on the floor,
Where is he drifting?
Oh when will he come home?

Oh, I don't know
Oh, I don't know

(I don't know, I don't know)
(I don't know, I don't know)
(I don't know)
(I don't know)
(I don't know)
