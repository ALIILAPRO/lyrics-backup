		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He came to the world in the usual way 
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay 
He learned to walk while I was away 

And he was talking before I knew it and as he grew 
He said, "I'm gonna be like you, Dad 
You know I'm gonna be like you" 

And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon 
Little boy blue and the man in the moon 
When you comin' home, Dad, I don't know when 
But we'll get together then 
You know we'll have a good time then 

My son turned ten just the other day 
He said, "Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on let's play 
Can you teach me to throw?" 
I said, "Not today, I got a lot to do" 
He said, "That's okay" 

And he walked away but his smile never dimmed 
And said, "I'm gonna be like him, yeah 
You know I'm going to be like him" 

And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon 
Little boy blue and the man in the moon 
When you comin' home, Dad, I don't know when 
But we'll get together then 
You know we'll have a good time then 

Well he came from college just the other day 
So much like a man I just had to say 
"Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while?" 

He shook his head and he said with a smile 
"What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys 
See you later, can I have them please?" 

And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon 
Little boy blue and the man in the moon 
When you comin' home, son, I don't know when 
But we'll get together then, Dad 
You know we'll have a good time then 

I've long since retired, my son's moved away 
I called him up just the other day 
I said, "Id like to see you if you don't mind" 

He said, "I'd love to Dad, if I could find the time 
You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu 
But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad 
It's been sure nice talking to you" 

And as I hung up the phone it had occurred to me 
He'd grown up just like me, my boy was just like me 

And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon 
Little boy blue and the man in the moon 
When you comin' home, son, I don't know when 
But we'll get together then, Dad 
We're gonna have a good time then 

And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon 
Little boy blue and the man in the moon 
When you comin' home, son, I don't know when 
But we'll get together then, Dad 
We're gonna have a good time then
