		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm sittin' in the railway station 
Got a ticket for my destination 
On a tour of one night stands 
My suitcase and guitar in hand 

And every stop is neatly planned 
For a poet and a one man band 
Homeward bound 
I wish I was 

Homeward bound 
Home where my thought's escaping 
Home where my music's playing 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me 
 
Every day's an endless stream 
Of cigarettes and magazines 
And each town looks the same to me 
The movies and the factories 

And every stranger's face I see 
Remind me that I long to be 
Homeward bound 
I wish I was 

Homeward bound 
Home where my thought's escaping 
Home where my music's playing 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me 
 
Tonight I'll sing my songs again 
I'll play the game and pretend 
But all my words come back to me 
In shades of mediocrity 

Like emptiness in harmony 
I need someone to comfort me 
Homeward bound 
I wish I was 

Homeward bound 
Home where my thought's escaping 
Home where my music's playing 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me
