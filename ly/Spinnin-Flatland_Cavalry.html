		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shoulda gone home before the band came on
Coulda called a cab 'fore it got bad
Shouda known when to walk away from a game I ain't winnin'

Here I go again spinning 'round a dancehall
Hoping I don't fall
Yeah, I'm glowing, floating higher than the ceiling
Feeling six-foot small
I'm not sure why tonight I thought it'd go different
Here I go again spinning

Who'd of known a burned-out bar
Would be the hiding place for a wandering star?
Darling you look lost and I feel found
Guess the universe is on your side
When luck and loneliness collide
So, hand in hand, merry, we go 'round

Here I go again spinning 'round a dancehall
Hoping I don't fall
Yeah, I'm glowing, floating higher than the ceiling
Feeling six-foot tall
I'm not sure why tonight I thought it'd go different
Here I go again spinning
Spin me 'round one more time

Oh, here I go again spinning 'round a dancehall
Hoping I don't fall
Yeah, I'm glowing, floating higher than the ceiling
Feeling six-foot small
I'm not sure why tonight I thought it'd go different
I'm not sure why tonight I thought it'd go different
Here I go again spinning
