		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's easy to slip, don't want you to fall
Might drip on this bitch like Met Gala, ballin'
Answer her texts, don't answer her calls

Yeah, she sent me a text, I don't answer her call
She love when I flex and shop in the mall
Relieving her stress, I beat down her walls
Skeet-skeet on her chest, she kissin' my balls
We speed in that 'Vette, don't stop for the laws
VVs on my neck, I shine in the dark
It's easy to slip, don't want you to fall
Walk in with the drip at Met Gala Ball

Shoot your shit up, I got accurate aim
Fucked up a few mil', now I'm back like I came
That boy say my name, I went and got me some strain
You know I don't crash, I just stay in my lane
Please don't compare, because we not the same
GunWun ain't no gimmick, ain't clownin' for fame
I trapped for a living and been had a name
Work hard for these clothes, cars, and watches and chains
Oh, man, Rolls-Royce got umbrellas, this whip for the rain
These folks done fucked up, let me slip in the game
This bitch let me fuck, this shit went to her brain
She know I'm a beast, it ain't easy to tame
She squirt on my sheets while I beat out her frame
Dozed off, woke back up, she still sayin' my name
In love with my life, and you wish we could trade

Yeah, she sent me a text, I don't answer her call
She love when I flex and shop in the mall
Relieving her stress, I beat down her walls
Skeet-skeet on her chest, she kissin' my balls
We speed in that 'Vette, don't stop for the laws
VVs on my neck, I shine in the dark
It's easy to slip, don't want you to fall
Walk in with the drip at Met Gala Ball

Walk in with the drip like Met Gala Ball
Came in and she strip, her panties and all
Lip gloss on her lip, suck me like a ho
A boss and a pimp, I bought me a ship
I walk with a limp, FN in my drawers
When she talk that shit, I put dick in her jaws
I hit and don't miss, ain't no win, lose, or draw
Hit and don't miss, ain't no win, lose, or draw
Came from Flat Shoals and Old Nat on the South
In that back, you get whacked, then get shot in your car
Why hell you think that I'm maxin'?
Relaxin' in mansions, no cappin', 'cause we had it hard
I ain't get this shit just from askin'
I made this shit happen and passion, it played a big part
I ain't get this bitch off of mackin'
It came off of actions and fashion and stay in accord

Yeah, she sent me a text, I don't answer her call
She love when I flex and shop in the mall
Relieving her stress, I beat down her walls
Skeet-skeet on her chest, she kissin' my balls
We speed in that 'Vette, don't stop for the laws
VVs on my neck, I shine in the dark
It's easy to slip, don't want you to fall
Walk in with the drip at Met Gala Ball
