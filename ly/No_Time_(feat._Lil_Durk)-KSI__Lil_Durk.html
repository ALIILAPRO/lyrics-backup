I ain't got no time from when I wake up, yeah
Believe me, I see through a lot of fake love, yeah
But I'ma let it go because it really ain't a thing to me, yeah 
I stay focused on my drip, crew flyin'
Girls they lyin', I ain't buyin'
Shit you say, I can just read your mind 
Do not mind, I stay shinnin'
Ain't no dippin' over here

I don't go to panic for that interview
I can call whenevr for that rendezvous
Feel the room, I got presence
And I never came in with a thing in a village 
where the only thing they hear is me (me)
How can they cancel, when the only thing that made me was me? (Me)
Been gettin' titles since a teen 
Granted to pree and bitch I'm still here
Standin' like a Pando tree, bitch, I am OP

I ain't got no time from when I wake up, yeah
Believe me, I see through a lot of fake love, yeah
But I'ma let it go because it really ain't a thing to me, yeah 
I stay focused on my drip, crew flyin'
Girls they lyin', I ain't buyin'
Shit you say, I can just read your mind 
Do not mind, I stay shinnin'
Ain't no dippin' over here (yeah)

I put that shit on I be gettin' from these owners, I be fly as hell
I give bro'nem hope about they out date, even though it's far as hell
I fly different bitches out to hang, I got three spots to chill
Ain't gon' lie the way this K blast, I got 'em on for real (let's get it)
Put down that Drac', I turn this Glock to an fully auto, uh, uh (yeah, yeah)
Gucci headband on my head like Leonardo, uh, uh (Leonardo, uh)
Took a pint and two FN's when I went to Cabo, uh, uh (when I went to Cabo, uh)
I was gettin' head on the jet, she playin' Mulatto, uh, uh
Made it out the mud, came from nothin' I'm a thug (yeah, yeah)
Never ask for a second chance (yeah, yeah)
I'ma go ouside and jugg (oh, oh)
Perry Ellis sweat pants with a hunnid thousand in the club
Surrounded by the same motherfuckers in my hood, I'm good

Don't take my time for granted
You seem to start to worry
I'm out here, you know that I'm about it
I'm changin' views, there's nothin' you can do
And I believe in my crew

I ain't got no time from when I wake up, yeah
Believe me, I see through a lot of fake love, yeah
But I'ma let it go because it really ain't a thing to me, yeah 
I stay focused on my drip, crew flyin'
Girls they lyin', I ain't buyin'
Shit you say, I can just read your mind 
Do not mind, I stay shinnin'
Ain't no dippin' over here
