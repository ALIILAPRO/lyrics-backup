		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Zoned out, I can't keep it movin'
I don't want your problems
Freaked out, but not ever losin'
Gonna crush rock bottom
Get down with what gets ya boogie
I hope that you caught 'em
Knocked out but fate's good lookin'
Gonna fool you rotten

Gonna blast off with a loud boom
And rocket 'til the day we die
Yeah, when you bet your life you learn to keep your eyes on the prize

I just wanna get one thing straight
The young and the restless just copulate
I'm talkin' turkey
Courtin' disaster, punchin' masters
I'm livin' it all for nothin'
All guts, no glory
Homeboy, sweet homeboy
Not with my pig, you don't
You think you're a smooth clubba hubba
Home is where the heart attack is
Several opportunities missed for your biz
So kiss my butler
Round up, move out, get ready
For a truly rockin' good show
Promenade with the flock and forget about the clock
'Cause in-a 1, 2, a-1, 2, 3
Everybody lose it with me!

Gonna blast off with a loud boom
And rocket 'til the day we die
Yeah, when you bet your life you learn to keep your eyes on the prize

"Hit it, fellas!"

Bellows of titans in history
Weighing down on me
I know how it goes
It's a sweet fabrication
Blocked out, the dream is a fever
And death can wait for me

Gonna blast off with a loud boom
And rocket 'til the day we die
Yeah, when you bet your life you learn to keep your eyes on the prize
