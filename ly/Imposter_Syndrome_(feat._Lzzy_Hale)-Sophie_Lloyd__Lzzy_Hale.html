		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm an imposter, just a pretender
All of my worst fears whisper in the dark
Scream at the mirror not to believe them
And pick up the pieces of my shattered heart

Breakin' outta my head
Shake it outta my mind
Through all the tears I cry, I

Smile for a million faces
And wait for the mask to fall
I hide from my darkest demons
That don't exist after all
And my monsters are just shadows on the wall

Nobody's perfect, do I deserve this?
All of my dreams burn bright like shooting stars
Am I just lucky? Maybe I'm crazy
Somebody wake me before I give it up, give it up

Breakin' outta my head (breakin' outta my head)
Shake it outta my mind (shake it outta my mind)
Will I survive this time and

Smile for a million faces
And wait for the mask to fall
I hide from my darkest demons
That don't exist after all
And my monsters are just shadows on the wall

Scream at the mirror
When all of my worst fears are whispering in the dark
Scream 'til it shatters
Tell all my monsters to disappear with the sun

Smile for a million faces
And wait for the mask to fall
I fight through my darkest demons
That don't exist after all
I'm an imposter, I'm an imposter 
Tell all my monsters that I'm waking up, waking up

Smile for a million faces
And wait for the mask to fall
I hide from my darkest demons
That don't exist after all
And my monsters are just shadows on the wall
