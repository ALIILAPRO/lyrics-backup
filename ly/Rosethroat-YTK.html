		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yeah, just gimme another one back
Yeah naw I'm on some shit huh?
I'm on some shit huh?
Yeah)

You-you-you
You-you
You-you

You, got your issues, I got tissues and this Hennessy
See most, of my problems, drowned in liquor, I can't smoke no weed
I would, If I could, but that leaf brew up anxietea
Yeah you, got your issues, I got tissues and this Hennessy

You, got your issues, I got tissues and this Hennessy
See most, of my problems, drowned in liquor, I can't smoke no weed
I would, If I could, but that leaf brew up anxietea
Yeah you, got your issues, I got tissues and this Hennessy

Painfully sober writing shit I really don't care about
And I might just roll another spliff and take It right to the mouth
I need something salty and some Hennessy, develop my gout
Then post It up on the couch, fuck niggas talking about

And I'm bored as shit and ain't got nothing to do, can't do It sober
If you feeling me lil' baby slide thru, yeah come on over
Lazy lazy, so baby you just gon' have to bend It over
But sure enough I can assure you that It ain't no nigga colder

Still bored when she leave tho, delivery no Kiko
I might just hit the Stoko's and crack a Four Loko
Then post up with the bros, and maybe run up the 2k
Chef It up like a souffle, just like Rudy Tabootie

I be in my own zone for real
And Mom was always on my ass when I blew, Green, Teal
But she just wanna see me eating like A Happy Meal
And so do Pop, so I live It like I die, shot pop from red dot, hold up

You, got your issues, I got tissues and this Hennessy
See most, of my problems, drowned in liquor, I can't smoke no weed
I would, If I could, but that leaf brew up anxietea
Yeah you, got your issues, I got tissues and this Hennessy

You, got your issues, I got tissues and this Hennessy
See most, of my problems, drowned in liquor, I can't smoke no weed
I would, If I could, but that leaf brew up anxietea
Yeah you, got your issues, I got tissues and this Hennessy
 
Put on the fit from yesterday then sashay to the alleyway
Taking out trash, hit the Battier fade-away
The weather cool, but I don't got no plans
My walk got a lil' Lean but I don't pop no Xans

Friends, family and haters I don't got no fans
Show out SXSW but don't got no bands, look
It's all about finesse my G
And being trapped in the crib death of stress low-key because

Really I ain't worried 'bout shit
I stir the beef with the Curry, Steph Curry assist
Behind the back, flick the wrist taking shots you missed
Don't be pissed, because your bitch A Hall-of-Famer and I'm training your sis

I kid, I kid
I kick it at the crib
Rarely, leave where I live
You should try it I insist

I, stay low-key and up outta the mix
And be the reason why your bitch scream 

"YTK cut that shit"

(Cause I got a lil' Hennessy for you baby
Cause I see you got issues, and for that I got tissues
I got, A lil' Hennessy)
