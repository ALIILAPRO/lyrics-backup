		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have a good sleep
for mom and dad
What can I do for feeling sad
All of my fear is getting
harder
Losing my motion I can't hide
Going my way I want to hurry
Moving my feet and sneaking out
Losing my mind I'm feeling down
Looking for the truth
in this life
You can run
You can run
Nothings gonna change the world
If we don't try so hard
You can ride
You can ride
It's a miracle
Waiting for you now in the dark
We were born
in a different place
They just want to know
where the box is
Everything in the tapestry
We can meet
when the fight is done
There are many problems
in this world
Today is not
always on your side
To the death
I'm so scared, It's war
Sky blue in my sight

Down on the street of
east of seven
What can I do for feeling bad
All of my fear
is getting louder
Losing my notion I can't find
Going my way I want to run
Moving my feet for breaking now
Losing my beat and feeling down
Proud to die for our destiny
You can run
You can run
Nothings gonna change the world
If we don't try so hard
You can ride
You can ride
It's a miracle
Waiting for you now in the dark
We were born
in a different place
They just want to know
where the box is
Everything in the tapestry
We can meet
when the fight is done

There are many problems
in this world
Today is not always
on your side
To the death
I'm so scared, It's war
Sky blue in my sight
There are many conflicts
in this world
Unclear my path
around the fallen ones
Into the space to back again
So evermore a peace reigns
