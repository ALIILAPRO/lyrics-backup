		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I feel so bad - I wonder what's wrong with me
Well, I feel so bad - I wonder what's wrong with me
I think I'll call my baby, find out just what the matter can be
Last night I dreamed about my baby
I woke up and the tears were runnin' all down my face 
Now, when I woke up - early this morning
The tears were runnin' all down my face 
You know I was dreamin', that some other man was takin' my place
I said, I dreamed about you baby
I dreamed you didn't want me 'round no more
I said, I dreamed about you baby
You know I dreamed you didn't want me round no more
Now, That's the reason I'm callin' you this evening
Baby, tell me, 'cause I've just got to know
break:
I've been worried all day long
I just don't know what to do 
I've been worried all day long
You know, I just don't know what to do 
You know it may sound silly to you woman
But tell me that dream was not true
