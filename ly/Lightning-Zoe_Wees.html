		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You thought that you were my whole damn world
That I'd fall and crumble when I got hurt

Right after midnight when all is calm
You can't see no light before the storm
You better hold tight, 'cause this thing's 'bout to fall
Oh-oh

When it's pouring down, I'll be coming in stronger
I'ma strike like lightning
You won't hear a sound, can't say I never warned ya
I'ma strike like lightning
When the dark hits, take my chances
I'll be dancing on the ashes
When it's pouring down, I'll be coming in stronger
I'ma strike like lightning

Still feel the echo of all my tears (all my tears)
It's my motivation that got me here (got me here)

Right after midnight when all is calm
You can't see no light before the storm
You better hold tight, 'cause this thing's 'bout to fall
Oh-oh

When it's pouring down, I'll be coming in stronger
I'ma strike like lightning
You won't hear a sound, can't say I never warned ya
I'ma strike like lightning
When the dark hits, take my chances
I'll be dancing on the ashes
When it's pouring down, I'll be coming in stronger
I'ma strike like lightning

Through every little struggle, I'm standing tall
I'll rise above it all, no, I won't fall
The battles that I've faced only made me strong

When it's pouring down, I'll be coming in stronger
I'ma strike like lightning
You won't hear a sound, can't say I never warned ya
I'ma strike like lightning
When the dark hits, take my chances
I'll be dancing on the ashes
When it's pouring down, I'll be coming in stronger
I'ma strike like lightning
