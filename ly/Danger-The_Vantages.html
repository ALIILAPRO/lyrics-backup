		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you need a dead end friend
If you're looking to play pretend
I can tear you down to any size you want
Your kisses make my mouth go numb
You're the saddest song that's ever been sung
And I love the way it rips into my heart
Give me your danger
Oh baby give me your danger
And use me up, I can't escape
I love the taste of your shade
Baby give me your danger
Oh baby give me your danger
And use me up, I'll return the favor
Oh baby give me your danger
And use me up
So lethal in your sequin dress
Making love to your cigarette
I'm detained, the key is gone
And the pins have dropped
Snow white and the glimmering fade
You're so sweet when you wither away
And I love the way it rips into my heart
Oh baby won't you
Give me your danger
Oh baby give me your danger
And use me up, I can't escape
I love the taste of your shade
Baby give me your danger
Oh baby give me your danger
And use me up, I'll return the favor
Oh baby give me your danger
And use me up
You're a flame to my house of cards
I can barely keep intact
Caught in a tide being pulled to your arms
Though I've tried I just can't get back to shore
And the more I try, the deeper I sink
And the worst of it all is I want it
And I want it
Oh I want it
Give me your danger
Oh baby give me your danger
And use me up, I can't escape
I love the taste of your shade
Baby give me your danger
Oh baby give me your danger
And use me up, I'll return the favor
Oh baby give me your danger
Danger, danger
