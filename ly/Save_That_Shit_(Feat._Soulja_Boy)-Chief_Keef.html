		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She say she love me whatever that is. (I don't know)
Do me a favor, save that shit. (Bitch)
Like bad kids, bitch we reckless. (Yeahh)
Ball hard, stunt like taxes. (Bang, Bang!)
He say he know Sosa, He be lacking. (Naww)
Do me a favor, save that shit. (Bitch)
You fuck niggas better stay packing. (Bang, Bang!)
Alot of 'tended clips, no acting. (Bang)

She say she know Sosa, he be flexxing
Pull up windows down, smell freshin
Good loud pack, smell like cat piss
Hanging out the roof yelling, reckless
Rocking in my Rock Jean
@CampaignSosa every nigga following
I ain't with the arguing
My niggas come, click clack, No arguing
She say she love me whatever that is
We see a opp, shit get hectic
Alot of 'tended clips, no acting
No sex bitch I only want your neck bitch

She say she love me whatever that is. (I don't know)
Do me a favor, save that shit. (Bitch)
Like bad kids, bitch we reckless. (Yeahh)
Ball hard, stunt like taxes. (Bang, Bang!)
He say he know Sosa, He be lacking. (Naww)
Do me a favor, save that shit. (Bitch)
You fuck niggas better stay packing. (Bang, Bang!)
Alot of 'tended clips, no acting. (Bang)
