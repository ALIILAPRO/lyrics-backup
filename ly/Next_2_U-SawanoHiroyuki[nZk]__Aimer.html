		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have a little break
We're running through the lights, out of breath
Our will made us right here, didn't it so?
Is this feeling fake?
We're happier far than we've ever known
Maybe we'll make it finally

I had to be the Queen anywhere I went
Anytime I talked
It's been a while
Since I've not pretended to be a grown-up
'Cause you make my makeup's off

Take off my dress and crown
Then I can fall sound asleep
We had paced back and forth all that time
You do never know that love I felt
Can be an ordinary girl
While I've been right next to you

Have I still been cared?
We've been together after all these days
No much time talking over day and night
When I feel your stare
My heart's like flying high above the phase
Maybe we'll overcome the scars

You want me to be free
Free from legacies, free like meteors
That's why I cried
Since I've been attended to so kindly
You're who make my makeup's off

Take off my heels and gown
Then I can breathe in so deep
We had paced back and forth all that time
You do never know that love I felt
Can be an ordinary girl
While I've been right next to you

Won't you promise me?
No matter how far apart
Always keep thinking of me
We must be heart to heart
Baby, twinkle, twinkle
My little fortunate star
Are you with me?

Take off my dress and crown
Then I can fall sound asleep
We had paced back and forth all that time
You do never know that love I felt
Can see the dream of you and I

Take off my heels and gown
Then I can breathe in so deep
We had paced back and forth all that time
You do never know that love I felt
Can be an ordinary girl
While I've been right next to you
