		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They dumped her body into the molten light
Floated to the surface and it did not ignite
She rose up slowly and walked to the shore
She stood up on the bank and whispered
I'll find you and I'll kill you
I'll find you and I'll kill you
I'll find you and I'll kill you

They ran back into town and hid in the church
They explained their situation and they feared for the worst
The priest told the brothers that she could not be killed
She flew out of the stone cold ground and
She'll find you and she'll kill you
She'll find you and she'll kill you
She'll find you and she'll kill you

There was a knock at that door that shook through their hearts
She blew it right open and put it apart
She shot a string of flame from the center of her chest
As she watched their bodies burn she whispered
I found you and I killed you
I found you and I killed you
I found you and I killed you
