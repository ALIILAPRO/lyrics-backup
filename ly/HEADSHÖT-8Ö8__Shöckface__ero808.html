		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who would have thought
We'd make it this far
Now I get to take it all for winning
But when my life ends, it won't mean nothing
Nothing but more overconsumption
Poetry in motion
Feeling like I'm Jesus
So many new faces
That I didn't know last week
All in my DMs
Labels wanting my soul
All of these A&Rs tryna be be friends
I ain't finna sign no shit
Till my team get
Pampered up
Knighted up
Royaled up
Bitch you better hope that budget
Big enough to spoil us
Fuck with us
Make it pop
And pour it up
Toast to those who never had the chance to be the chosen ones
Who would have thought
We'd make it this far
Now I get to take it all for winning
But when my life ends, it won't mean nothing
Nothing but more overconsumption
My fucking windows tinted
One fifty five inside a fifty five, that's how we living
I'm blowing loud inside the whip, I know the pigs are sniffing
License is suspended
God ain't giving no repentance for the way I'm sinning
Got no patients for no greedy sons of bitches
And when I'm at the top I ain't gon' show you no forgiveness
That's ain't how I'm feeling
Suck it up
Toughen up
Pucker up
Toast to all of the souls who never got close to being the chosen ones
Got my shooters
Aiming right at your medulla
Suck me like Hoover
Beggars ain't finna be choosers
And when I die I'm gon' leave behind
All my old memories wrapped inside symphonies
Yeah, when we die the whole game gon' recognize both of our names
