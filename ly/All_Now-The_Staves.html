		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Still the value on the package
And the camera on the skin
Still the focus on the eye
Not the biscuit, just the tin
And I'm standing here screaming, where do we begin?
Where do we begin? Where do we begin?

It's all now, isn't it exciting?
We can stick it to the man
And come out fighting
Unencumbered, fast as lightning
I can act like I'm fine
I can put it in writing
It's all now, isn't it exciting?
Isn't it exciting? Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it? Isn't it?

Show the scars on your stomach
Show the hurt on your sleeve
Rub their faces in the dirt
Give them something to believe in
Do what you want, just be aggressively free
Be aggressively free, be aggressively free

It's all now, isn't it exciting?
We can stick it to the man
And come out fighting
Unencumbered, fast as lightning
I can act like I'm fine
I can put it in writing
It's all now, isn't it exciting?
Isn't it exciting? Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it? Isn't it?

Don't be angry if the kids had it easier than me
Bitterness is only fine if nobody can see
Be the brand of empowerment I'm supposed to be
I'm supposed to be, I'm supposed to be

It's all now, isn't it exciting?
We can stick it to the man
And come out fighting
Unencumbered, fast as lightning
I can act like I'm fine
I can put it in writing
It's all now, isn't it exciting?
Isn't it exciting? Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it? Isn't it?

And would it be alright
If I sit this one out tonight?
But you can go wild, dear
Happy New Year
Have a happy New Year

It's all now, isn't it exciting?
We can stick it to the man
And come out fighting
Unencumbered, fast as lightning
I can act like I'm fine
I can put it in writing
It's all now, isn't it exciting?
Isn't it exciting? Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it? Isn't it?

Happy New Year
Happy New Year (happy New Year)
Happy New Year
