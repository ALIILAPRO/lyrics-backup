		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I'm a different person
New passions and new burdens
New thoughts to occupy my time

Yeah, I'm a different person
And nothing's ever certain
I'm trading memories in my mind

It's hard to let it go, let it go
When all you've ever known, ever known
Is slowly fading

Everything is changing, changing
Got me feeling bittersweet
'Cause every single part of me
Is changing, changing
Standing on a different shore
No, nothing's like it was before, changing

Learning all my lessons
Keep asking all these questions
Will I ever see the light?
Try to bridge the distance
An open heart to listen
Will I ever get it right?

But it's hard to let it go, let it go
When all you've ever known, ever known
Is slowly fading

Everything is changing, changing
Got me feeling bittersweet
'Cause every single part of me
Is changing, changing
Standing on a different shore
No, nothing's like it was before, changing, oh

But it's hard to let it go, let it go
When all you've ever known, ever known
Is slowly fading

Everything is changing, changing
Got me feeling bittersweet
'Cause every single part of me

Everything is changing, changing
Got me feeling bittersweet
'Cause every single part of me
Is changing, changing
Standing on a different shore
No, nothing's like it was before, changing, oh
