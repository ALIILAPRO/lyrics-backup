		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You told me it would get better
And you would love me whatever the weather
But now you're leaving, and I feel set up
Oh, baby boy, that was a rookie error

Now I am coming for you
In all my songs, there's nothing you can do
Oh, playing games with me was a really bad move
And now you're slipping, oh boy, what were you thinking

When you broke a bitch's heart
And now I'm out for blood
Yeah, you keep your apology
You messed with the wrong one
I gave it from the start
Then you cut it in half
And there's nothing more dangerous
Than a bitch with a broken heart

I'm trying to keep composure
You're still denying that you fucked me over
And now you're crying and you want closure
We're just friends, that's what you told her

Now I am coming for you
In all my songs, there's nothing you can do
Oh, playing games with me was a really bad move
And now you're slipping, oh boy, what were you thinking

When you broke a bitch's heart
And now I'm out for blood
Yeah, you keep your apology
You messed with the wrong one
I gave it from the start
Then you cut it in half
And there's nothing more dangerous
Than a bitch with a broken heart

A bitch with a broken heart
A bitch with a broken heart

How could you be
So stupid, so foolish
To make a fool of me?
It's too late for sorry's
Like boy what were you thinking

When you broke a bitch's heart
And now I'm out for blood
Yeah, you keep your apology
You messed with the wrong one
I gave it from the start
Then you cut it in half
And there's nothing more dangerous
Than a bitch with a broken heart

A bitch with a broken heart
A bitch with a broken heart
