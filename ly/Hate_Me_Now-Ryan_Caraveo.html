		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, 
You can't break me down
Oh, oh

There ain't no rules in the wild
Everyday a mother loses a child
I never get fooled by a smile
We ain't fam just cause we been cool for a while

I can't stop I got moves to make
I been losing my friends at a gruesome rate
Got a heavy heart yeah it grew some weight
You sink or swim you choose your fate

I don't need your help I'm so independent
I learn how to fly if the road hit a dead end
I'll be this way 'til I float to the heavens
Yeah I'll be this way 'til I float to the heavens


If you hated me then, then you gon' hate me now, ohhh
You can shake me up but you can't break me down, ohhh
If you hated me then, then you gon' hate me now, ohhh
You can shake me up but you can't break me down, ohhh


I don't like to party
I be in the cut like the scars on my body
If you hated then don't talk to me now
Fuck double, fuck triple I quadruple down

Now, the truth is I love you I wanted to try
But you are the reason I'm haunted inside
If you ghosted me once I don't want a reply
Before living with snakes I will honorably die

Five, fingers on the wheel when I ride
Other hand flipping one finger in the sky
Eyes wide open but my heart closed shut
I don't care if you say sorry now so what

If you hated me then, then you gon' hate me now, ohhh
You can shake me up but you can't break me down, ohhh
If you hated me then, then you gon' hate me now, ohhh
You can shake me up but you can't break me down, ohhh

Break me down, ohh, you can't break me down (you can't bring me down)
Break me down, ohh, you  can't break me down (you can't bring me down)
You can't bring me down
You can't break me down
