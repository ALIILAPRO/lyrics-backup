		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't think about you
No, I don't think about you
I don't think about you
No, I don't think about you
No, I don't think about you
I don't think about you
No, I don't think about you

No, I don't think about you
No, I don't think about you
No, I don't think about you

The tape that I made you
Don't ever remind me of you
I don't think about you
When I notice your toothbrush
By the sink with a coat of dust
No, I don't think about you
Your smell on the pillow
Helps me to let go
And not think about you
The words that I made you
I remember I knew
Still I don't think about you
When I find your hair
Next to your jacket on my white desk chair
No, I don't think about you
