		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hold my hand until we turn to ashes
Love me 'til they put me in my casket
I got all these feelings that I'm maskin'
Can I lay it on you? That's what I'm askin'

Day one, kissing, a house, it's your parents
Dived 'fore you went in, how'd you forget it?
I think about you and nothin' else
So if you would just come over, I could show you for myself

It's nights like this when I need your love
When I need someone that'll heal my soul
It's nights like this
Nights like, nights like this, ooh-ooh

Nights like this
Ooh-ooh

It's nights like this when I need your love
When I need someone that'll heal my soul
It's night like this
Nights like, nights like this, ooh-ooh
