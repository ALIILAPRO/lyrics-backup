		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah, come on, baddie
Pull up, yo, what you doin'? (Trap House Mob)
Pull up, look (bad bitches know what I mean)
(This is a Melo beat)
Wait, wait
Yeah, yeah, huh, that shit right there
Lemme see some (ah)
Woo back baby
Talk to me nice
Look

Perc', 30, Perc', dreamin' (I'm on Cloud 9)
Low, that I'm dreamin' (low, that I'm dreamin')
Pour a, four, pour a four, I'm leanin' (leanin')
Know that I'm leanin' (huh)
Walk in, 30, got a whole lotta bags, Neiman
I'm up in Neiman, that's a fact
Papi, lurkin' (lurkin' nigga), schemin'
Know that I'm schemin' (baow)

Amiri the denims, got ninas attached
Big body Benz, I got tree in the back
Scope on the Glock and it hit like a MAC
I can't fuck with these hoes 'cause these bitches is trash
I like my bitch and she classy
She suck on my balls, she nasty
She open her legs, gymnastics
She make it disappear, magic
Christian Louboutin, spikes on my feet
Red bottoms when I walk in the street (Pop Smoke)
I'm the one they wanna meet (Pop Smoke)
They know I'ma bring the heat (Pop Smoke)
They wanna fuck with the team (Pop Smoke)
Bad bitches, that's my thing (Pop Smoke)
Eleven karats on the ring (Pop Smoke)
Mike Amiri, Billie Jean

Perc', 30, Perc', dreamin' (grrr)
Low, that I'm dreamin' 
Pour a four, leanin'
Know that I'm leanin' (huh)
Walk in, 30, Neiman
I'm up in Neiman
Papi, lurkin' (lurkin' nigga), schemin'
Know that I'm schemin'

Look, ski mask, Jason
Glock 9, laser
Me and my bitch, chase 'em
If I don't got it she gon' tase 'em
Grab 'em up, shake 'em
I don't fuck with no pigs, no bacon
As-salaam-alaikum
All my cars paid off
Talk to the general
Niggas know I'm the boss
These niggas be petticoat
They don't got the sauce
You know what that Henny do
Talk out your mind and we endin' you
Hit your body, do a flip or two
Know I'm a dog, I'm an animal (rrr)

Perc', 30, Perc', dreamin' (grrr)
Low, that I'm dreamin' 
Pour a four, leanin'
Know that I'm leanin' (huh)
Walk in, 30, Neiman
I'm up in Neiman
Papi, lurkin' (lurkin' nigga), schemin'
Know that I'm schemin'
