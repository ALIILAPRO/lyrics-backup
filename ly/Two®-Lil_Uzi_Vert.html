		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uzi, Uzi, not again!
Uzi wake your ass up!

I ain't gon' lie
I got money and the power
I ain't gon' lie
I got money and the power
I ain't gon' lie
I got money and the power
I ain't gon' lie
I ain't gon' lie

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And I just wanna let you know
I really really wanna let you know
That I really don't give a fuck what nobody say about me
'Cause you know I'm the one
Yes I'm the one that really started all this
And you know I changed a lot of you niggas
In a matter of months I raised a lot of you niggas

They know I'm the one so it's no way they can stop it
Tried to run off with the swag I put 'em in pocket
Told my main girl to stop it
She saw me up in a picture I thought they cropped it (oh my god)
Damn she think I popped it (oh my god)
I will not give these bitches this dick like no topping
Woah we're ending that topic
In the industry with Dickies all on my pop shit

I ain't gon' lie
I got money and the power
I ain't gon' lie
I got money and the power
I ain't gon' lie
I got money and the power
I ain't gon' lie
I ain't gon' lie

Yeah the famous life it'll eat you up alive
It's a game and I put my feelings to the side
Yeah the famous life it'll eat you up alive
It's a game and I put my feelings to the side
Times up I check my watch every hour
All of my diamonds they blind them
I can't fuck her she a minor
Times up I check my watch every hour
All of my diamonds they blind them
I can't fuck her she a minor
Look for your bitch you can't find her
I was the one right behind her
Talking that shit you get tied up
Don't got enough get your grind up
The reason I got all these bitches and got all these diamonds, I can't make my mind up
Mind up, she gave me head, gave that mind up!

I ain't gon' lie
I got money and the power
I ain't gon' lie
I got money and the power
I ain't gon' lie
I got money and the power
I ain't gon' lie

(Two)
