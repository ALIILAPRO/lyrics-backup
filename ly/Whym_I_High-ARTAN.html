		  Whym I high, whym I high, all the time?
All the time, on my mind, every night

Pick me apart like it’s an operation
We’re back and forth but
We ain’t conversating
Not getting younger I forgot I’m aging
Yo, look cos I know life
I know the struggles of surviving
I grew up in London where we share
The same address but we’re divided
These ain’t tears man
I’m just high behind these eyelids
And out of everybody that I’ve met
My fucking cabbies still the wisest
He said, "money isn’t everything
Only thing you need is good friends
Four walls and a roof that you can settle in
You’ll soon be onto better things"
But he doesn’t know about the debt I’m in
Or when I took out uni loans for ketamine but
I’m working hard but what’s the meaning
Heard the more you sweat in practice then
The less in war you're bleeding
Why am I working like a slave
But my rewards are less appealing
Are these TED Talks that
I’m watching all deceiving, is it true
Heard the only person standing
Between victory is you
I know the feeling when you’re talented
But don’t know what to do
And everybody’s doing well and you don’t
Know which path to choose
It’s like they’ve never worked a day but
Told you mountains you should move
It’s really peak out here
Feeling weak out here
9 to 5 and 5 to 9 ain’t got no sleep out here
Tryna blossom everyday
I’m planting seeds out here
I’m buying all these fucking flowers
Looking bleak out here but I know
There’s something waiting for me ooh
Cos I’ve been chasing my dreams, I know
And I’ve been wasting this weed

Whym I high, whym I high, all the time?
All the time, on my mind, every night
Whym I high, whym I high, all the time?
All the time, on my mind, every night

I’m in a smokey room on
Christmas Eve anxiety keeps creeping
I can’t think of happy thoughts I’ve
Taken hella L’s this evening
And my marj don’t say a word it’s
Been a year and we ain’t speakin'
I can’t tell you 'bout the mental state
I’ve been in all I’ve seen is
Mandem pass away or go in there
Some L's I haven’t noticed yet
If God had really cared he
Would’ve wrote a cheque
But I ain’t losing focus, yeah
Tryna make sure 2020’s patterned
'Cause at 19 my dreams were
Feeling shattered minds been scattered
I was lost I got the sack from work
Thinking should I bag up work
Mandem think my questions are a tad absurd
They’re saying fam you haven’t learned
Clocked you’re always broke when you
Go back to work you know I hate to say it
Bro but trapping works in me
I’m just blessed that I’m alive and well
He wants me on the line
I said I might as well
Could do with extra money from his clientele
Still writing and I’m firing on
The mic as well
Think I’m gonna blow up from what I can tell
This Cali pack, I like the smell
So now I’m rolling 33 and lil zoots to ration
I should really hit the line but
I don’t really suit the fashion
I’ve been saying it for years if you
Got dreams then go and catch 'em
But all these trappers would be bankers
If the government could tax 'em
Now I’m staring at these tickets
And it’s getting me frustrated
I spent all those years at school and
Now those years are being wasted
You know laws are all in place 'cause
They know people have to break it
'Cause they all just turn our backs on us
And left us all to face it so

Whym I high, whym I high, all the time?
All the time, on my mind, every night
Whym I high, whym I high, all the time?
All the time, on my mind, every night
