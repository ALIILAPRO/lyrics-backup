		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I leave my house at 3 o' clock
With two hundred texts and two missed calls
Guess all of the friends that I pissed off
All talked

And I took a job for just July
But feels like I might be here for life
Yeah, I'm in it now, I'm in it now
Could I start again, somehow?

Yes, I'm a mess with an S on my chest
Got stress filling up my head
So I spent last night blowing up my life
Now you won't see me again

Cheers to the front and cheers to the back
And cheers to the 2010s
I could hate my guts when the sun comes up
But I like myself like this
I like myself like this

Why should I fix the shit I've done
When I could just pack my shit and run?
Delete every number from my phone
So long

Yeah, I'll get new shirts 'cause mine all stink
And I'll tell my boss what I really think
Yeah, I'm in it now, I'm in it now
Could I start again, somehow?

Yes, I'm a mess with an S on my chest
Got stress filling up my head
So I spent last night blowing up my life
Now you won't see me again

Cheers to the front and cheers to the back
And cheers to the 2010s
I could hate my guts when the sun comes up
But I like myself like this
I like myself like this

Yes, I'm a mess with an S on my chest
So I spent last night blowing up my life
Now you won't see me again

Yes, I'm a mess with an S on my chest
I could hate my guts when the sun comes up
But I guess that's what this is
I like myself like this

I could hate my guts when the sun comes up
But I like myself like this
