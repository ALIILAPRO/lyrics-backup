		  (Say that again, no, that didn't work here)
(You messed with the wrong bitch)

So I heard you're back in town 
And haven't changed a bit, man 
You get off talking down to the little man 
Time you get what you deserve 

Wow (wow)
You're so fucking stupid 
Been a while since my head was this polluted 
Lucky I know my own worth 

So you, so you wanna fight me, are you big enough?
Kick the back of my knee, are you serious?
(Are you serious?) 
You keep on trying but 
I like your blood on my teeth just a little too much 

(Too much) so bite me, slap me round the face
Now I'm twisting your arm 'til I hear it break 
I get stronger everyday

Yeah, little girl gone, got a gun from a gangster 
Run little girl, run little girl, bang, ha

Say that again, I didn't quite hear you
Messed with the wrong bitch in the wrong era 
I been at work and I got my badge of honor
Honey, I've changed so much since I last saw you

Hands off my hair, how very dare you 
Ding ding, hold my earrings for my debut
'Cause I pack a punch backed into a corner 
Come at me, don't tell me I didn't warn ya

Did you think I'd be easy
Snap me like bamboo?
Mold me into the soul of your jackboot?
Wish I could bottle the taste
'Cause I'd drink up the look on your face

So you, so you wanna fight me, are you big enough?
Kick the back of my knee, are you serious?
(Are you serious?) 
You keep on trying but 
I like your blood on my teeth just a little too much 

(Too much) so bite me, slap me round the face
Now I'm twisting your arm 'til I hear it break 
I get stronger everyday, yeah

Little girl gone, got a gun from a gangster 
Run little girl, run little girl, bang, ha

Say that again, I didn't quite hear you
Messed with the wrong bitch in the wrong era 
I been at work and I got my badge of honor
Honey, I've changed so much since I last saw you

Hands off my hair, how very dare you 
Ding ding, hold my earrings for my debut
'Cause I pack a punch backed into a corner 
Come at me, don't tell me I didn't warn ya

(Little girl gone, got a gun from a gangster)
(Run little girl, run little girl, bang, ha)

Little girl gone, got a gun from a gangster
Run little girl, run little girl, faster

Little girl gone, got a gun from a gangster
Honey I changed so much since I last saw you 

Hands off my hair, how very dare you 
Ding ding, hold my earrings for my debut
'Cause I pack a punch backed into a corner 
Come at me, don't tell me I didn't warn ya
