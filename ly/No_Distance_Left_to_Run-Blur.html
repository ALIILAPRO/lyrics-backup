		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's over
You don't need to tell me
I hope you're with someone who makes you 
feel safe in your sleeping tonight
I won't kill myself, trying to stay in your life
I got no distance left to run

When you see me
Please turn your back and walk away
I don't want to see you 
'cause i know the dreams that you keep is wearing me
When your coming down, think of me here
I got no distance left to run

It's over, I knew it would end this way
I hope you're with someone who makes you feel
That this life is the night
And it settles down, stays around
Spends more time with you
I got no distance left to run

I'm coming home
Soooo ohhhh
Ohhh...
