		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won't get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won't get back
Yeah, I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don't think about the times
I wish that I could rewind

'Cause I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won't get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won't get back
Yeah, I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don't think about the times
I wish that I can rewind

I told my mama we gon' be fine
So I'm up all night way after sleep time
I'm just thinkin' 'bout Lil Kuda, gave my dawg a dime
He put a buckshot in a nigga's behind
No daddy so I grew up to the street life
But my son, I'ma keep him in the beehive
Schemin' on a heist, I need to change my life
Been geekin' all night, I'm goin' senile
With two niggas toting three .45's
I seen a nigga play gangsta, then he broke now
Lost a lot, lost his mind in the courthouse
I'm on XXL, I'm in New York now

I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won't get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won't get back
Yeah, I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don't think about the times
I wish that I can rewind

I keep thinkin' 'bout my niggas
I think I need a jigga
Why we keep on falling victim
Lost up in the system
Miss my brothers and my sisters
Damn, I miss my lil' one
I know sometimes I be trippin'
But I just miss my niggas
I got codeine in my liver
I gave the judge a piece of me
I'm too street for the industry
But I think that's where I need to be
'Cause verbally, mentally, and physically I keep that heat
Me and my brother fit in
We smokin' one with PnB
Niggas say they fuck with me
But lowkey they be easin' me
You bitches don't mean shit to me
People tryna sentence me
How a youngin' posted on the street, gon' call it Sesame
1K 'til the death of me, don't put your life in jeopardy

I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won't get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won't get back
Yeah, I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don't think about the times
I wish that I can rewind
