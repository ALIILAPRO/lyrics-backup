		  Oh, oh-oh
Got better things to do with my time
Better things to do with my time
Do with my time than you
Oh, oh-oh
Got better things to do with my time
Better things to do with my time
Do with my time

I wasn't ever sure that I loved you
But I was always sure you would let me down
Wasn't ever sure if I trust you
But I'm so goddamn sure my energy's just too precious to waste
So now you, now you wanna

Know me, wanna know me
Wanna know all about me, wanna know about me
But he can't have me 'cause I left him alone
I know you wanna know me, wanna know me
Wanna know all about me, wanna know about me
But he can't have me 'cause I'm gone, no-no-no

That I, I got better things to do with my time
Better things to do with my time
Do with my time than you
Oh-oh, I got better things to do with my time
Better things to do with my time
Do with my time (break it down)
Oh, better things to do with my time
Better things to do with my time
Do with my time than you
Yes

Wasn't ever sure if I loved you
But I was always sure you woulda loved me back
You had me right, right, right at my weakest, yeah
Now you're hurting, I can see you're mad
'Cause you're never gonna get that back
Now I know you wanna

Know me, wanna know me
Wanna know all about me, wanna know about me
But he can't have me 'cause I left him alone (I left him alone)
I know you wanna know me, wanna know me
Wanna know all about me, wanna know about me
But he can't have me 'cause I'm gone, no-no-no

That I, I got better things to do with my time
Better things to do with my time
Do with my time than you
Oh-oh, I got better things to do with my time
Better things to do with my time
Do with my time (break it down)

I'm sorry that it hurts you
No, I'm sorry, I ain't sorry
aespa, big girls making money
aespa, you're our number one fan now
You can only see me at our sold out shows (sold out show)
Will I ever go back? (No)
Will I ever trip up? (No)
Will I ever pull up on him? (No)
Watch and see 'bout to throw another rhythm on him (oh, that I)

I, I got better things to do with my time
Better things to do with my time
Do with my time than you (yes)
Oh-oh, I got better things to do with my time
Better things to do with my time
Do with my time (break it down)

(Hey) 
I got better (hey)
Things to do
With my time 
(Hey)
I got better (hey)
Things to do
With my time

I'm sorry that it hurts you
No, I'm sorry, I ain't sorry
aespa, big girls making money
aespa, you're our number one fan now
You can only see me at our sold out shows (sold out show)
Will I ever go back? (No)
Will I ever trip up? (No)
Will I ever pull up on him? (No)
Watch and see 'bout to throw another rhythm on him
Rhythm on him, rhythm on him
Rhythm on him, rhythm on him
