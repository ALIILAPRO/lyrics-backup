		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another year, another gray
Another friend who moves away
Seems we're getting older every day
My sister has a baby now
The other one is writing vows
I hardly recognize this busy town

But winter comes around and, snow is coming down and
Just like we were kids, just like it always did
And despite it all, I know that I can trust
No matter what, there's Christmas and there's us

Time goes by and lovers turn to strangers
People stop believing
But there's one thing that I know
We'll still be kissin' in the cold
Time goes by and dreams get left for later
I can't stop the seasons
But there's one thing that I know
We'll still be kissin' in the cold
Kissin' in the cold

Both our hands inside a glove
Laughing at how gross we love
Drinking whiskey by the fire bundled up, oh

But winter comes around and, snow is coming down, yeah
Just like we were kids, just like it always did
Despite it all, I know that I can trust
No matter what, there's Christmas and there's us

Time goes by and lovers turn to strangers
People stop believing
But there's one thing that I know
We'll still be kissin' in the cold
Time goes by and dreams get left for later
I can't stop the seasons
But there's one thing that I know
We'll still be kissin' in the cold
Kissin' in the cold

Time goes by and lovers turn to strangers
People stop believing
But there's one thing that I know
We'll still be kissin' in the cold
Time goes by and dreams get left for later
I can't stop the seasons
But there's one thing that I know
We'll still be kissin' in the cold
Kissin' in the cold
