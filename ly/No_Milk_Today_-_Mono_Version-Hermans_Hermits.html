		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No milk today my love is gone away
The bottle stands forlorn a symbol of the dawn
No milk today it seems a common sight
But people passing by don't know the reason why

How could they know just what this message means
The end of all my hopes the end of all my dreams
How could they know a palace there had been
Behind the door where my love reigned as queen
No milk today it wasn't always so
The company was gay we turn'd night into day

But all that's left is a place dark and lonely
A terraced house in a mean street back of town
Becomes a shrine when I think of you only
Just two-up, two-down

No milk today it wasn't always so
The company was gay we turn'd night into day
As music played the faster did we dance
We felt it both at once the start of our romance

How could they know just what this message means
The end of all my hopes the end of all my dreams
How could they know a palace there had been
Behind the door where my love reigned as queen
No milk today my love is gone away
The bottle stands forlorn a symbol of the dawn

But all that's left is a place dark and lonely
A terraced house in a mean street back of town
Becomes a shrine when I think of you only
Just two-up, two-down

No milk today my love is gone away
The bottle stands forlorn a symbol of the dawn
No milk today it seems a common sight
But people passing by don't know the reason why

How could they know just what this message means
The end of all my hopes the end of all my dreams
How could they know a palace there had been
Behind the door where my love reigned as queen
No milk today it wasn't always so
The company was gay we turn'd night into day

But all that's left is a place dark and lonely
A terraced house in a mean street back of town
All that's left is a place dark and lonely
A terraced house in a mean street back of town

But all that's left is a place dark and lonely
A terraced house in a mean street back of town
