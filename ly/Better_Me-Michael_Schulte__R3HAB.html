		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh you lift me off the ground, I was down down down
Ooh-ooh, you make me a better me
Crazy how I feel right now, turn me round round round
Ooh-ooh, you make me a better me

Life was a highway, was driving and losing control
I spent Monday to Friday just trying to make it back home
I was dirt on a diamond until you picked me up, ooh
You were there in the silence, a fire, a burning love

Oh you lift me off the ground, I was down down down
Ooh-ooh, you make me a better me
Crazy how I feel right now, turn me round round round
Ooh-ooh, you make me a better me
In the darkest of nights
Yeah, you showed me the light
Crazy how I feel right now, turn me round round round
Ooh-ooh, you make me a better me
You make me a better me

When I look back at those days don't know how I survived
But you changed me the moment you walked in, you brought me to life
I was dirt on a diamond until you picked me up (ooh)
You were there in the silence, a fire, a burning love

Oh you lift me off the ground, I was down down down
Ooh-ooh, you make me a better me
Crazy how I feel right now, turn me round round round
Ooh-ooh, you make me a better me
In the darkest of nights
Yeah, you showed me the light (showed me the light)
Crazy how I feel right now, turn me round round round
Ooh-ooh, you make me a better me (you make me a better me)
You make me a better me (better me, better me)

You make me a better me
Ohh-oh, you make me a better me
