		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now we're adversaries in a pretty house, yeah
Couldn't tell you what we're even fight 'bout, yeah
That's probably something we should figure out, yeah
Oh
 
'Cause I wanna be a ten out of ten for you
Hit it out of the park
And I wanna be an amen to ya
When you're falling apart
And we're not what we used to be but
Let's be what we are, let's be what we are
 
With infatuation fading in and out, yeah
Gotta find a piece that keeps us sticking 'round, yeah
I should say I don't have a shred of doubt, yeah
And we're alright
 
'Cause I wanna be a ten out of ten for you
Hit it out of the park
And I wanna be an amen to ya
When you're falling apart
And we're not what we used to be but
Let's be what we are, let's be what we are
 
There will be dark days, ooh
Swear that they'll be short
There will be good days, ooh
There'll be so many more
You can always be sure that
 
I wanna be a ten out of ten for you
Hit it out of the park
And I wanna be an amen to ya
When you're falling apart
And we're not what we used to be but
Let's be what we are, let's be what we are
