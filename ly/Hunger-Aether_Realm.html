		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I feel it - a rumbling inside
Frail body tired and weakening
With a dead look in my eyes
One foot in the grave and I'm short on time
The other one stays on my side of the line
For far too long I have watched them dine
Abiding

They sat me down and twisted fate
They fed me scraps from the dinner plate
I've waited seven long years I've got nothing to lose
My friend I think you may have made a mistake

Hunger I've been dying for my piece of the pie
It's the flavor at the front of my mind
All I had was a taste and it's chewing me up inside
Hunger there's a feast in my line of sight
Everything that you see will be mine
I've been wasting away
Now the time is right for a bite
Can you feel The Hunger?

(Torn down)
I can feel my body break as I push it past the edge
(Starved out)
Now I know I was not prepared for the scarcity ahead
One foot in the grave but I'm still not dead
I'll take what's mine you can keep the rest
But I won't stomach being dispossessed anymore

It never fills the void inside
But I know one thing we're gonna eat well tonight

Hunger I've been dying for my piece of the pie
It's the flavor at the front of my mind
All I had was a taste and it's chewing me up inside
Hunger there's a feast in my line of sight
Everything that you see will be mine
I've been wasting away
Now the time is right for a bite
Can you feel The Hunger?

(Solo - Burbage)
(Solo - Arnold)

Hunger I've been dying for my piece of the pie
It's the flavor at the front of my mind
All I had was a taste and it's chewing me up inside
Hunger there's a feast in my line of sight
Everything that you see will be mine
I've been wasting away
Now the time is right for a bite
Can you feel The Hunger?
