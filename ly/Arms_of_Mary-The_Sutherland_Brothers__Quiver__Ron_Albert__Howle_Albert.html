		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The lights shine down the valley
The wind blows up the alley, oh
Well I wish I was lying in the arms of Mary

She took the pains of boyhood
And turned them in to feel good, oh
How I wish I was lying in the arms of Mary

Mary was the girl who taught me all I had to know
She put me right on my first mistake
Summer wasn't good when I learned all she had to show
She really gave all a boy could take, oh

So now when I get lonely
Still looking for the one and only
That's when I wish was lying in the arms of Mary

Mary was the girl who taught me all I had to know
She put me right on my first mistake
Summer wasn't good when I learned all she had to show
She really gave all a boy could take

The lights shine down the valley
The wind blows up the alley, oh
Well I wish I was lying in the arms of Mary
Lying in the arms of Mary, Lying in the arms of Mary
Lying in the arms of Mary
