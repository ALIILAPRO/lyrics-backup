		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I, need your love
Need your love

The taste in your tongue, oh
The smoke in your lungs and I
And I need your love
And I need your love
The salt on your skin
Is pulling me in
And I need your love
And I need your love

I don't wanna say goodbye to another night
And watch you walk away
And I don't wanna let it burn in the city lights
And make the same mistakes, this time

I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste tonight

I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste tonight

The scratch in your voice
Leaves me no choice
And I won't give up
And I can't give up

I don't wanna say goodbye to another night
And watch you walk away
I don't wanna let it burn in the city lights
And make the same mistakes, this time

I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste tonight

I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste tonight

I don't wanna say goodbye to another night
I don't wanna let it burn in the city lights

I don't wanna say goodbye to another night
And watch you walk away
And I don't wanna let it burn in the city lights
And make the same mistakes, this time

I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste tonight
I don't wanna waste tonight

I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste tonight

I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
