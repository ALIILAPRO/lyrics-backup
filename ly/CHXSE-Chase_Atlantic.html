		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Yeah, yeah, shit

I live for the chase
They wanna know how I'm livin' my life
On a regular day, woah
Wake up and pop me like two or three pills
Man, I'm feelin' great, yeah
Pick up my phone, I don't even scroll
Just throw it away
Get that shit out of my face, yeah
I'm still alive
Workin' overdrive, yeah
Drinkin' on the job
Because it ain't no nine to five, yeah
Been up for too long
These other artists can't survive, yeah
She said I'm too reckless
I said, "Baby, this is life," yeah

I live for the chase
I live for the drugs
I live for the money
I live for the fame, yeah
I live in the clouds
I ain't comin' down
Bitch, I'm here to stay, yeah
Do your research
We don't ever make mistakes
Look death in the eyes like every day
I live for the-

Damn, I'm covered in flames
I don't need a fuckin' fire suit
Bitch, I got fire runnin' through my veins, yeah
Ever since we made "DEVILISH"
I've been pryin' open Heaven's gates, yeah
Once I get in, I'ma burn every bridge
Then I'm dippin' down the fire escape, yeah
It's in my DNA, grandma escaped
Had to leave Africa
Somehow she managed to fight her own fate
Evading militia, they wiped out the village
But she got away
So no, I don't take life for granted
'Cause life is never guaranteed

I live for the chase
I live for the drugs
I live for the money
I live for the fame, yeah
I live in the clouds
I ain't comin' down
Bitch, I'm here to stay, yeah
Do your research
We don't ever make mistakes
Look death in the eyes like every day
I live for the chase
I live for the drugs
I live for the money
I live for the fame
I live in the clouds
I ain't comin' down
Bitch, I'm here to stay, yeah
Please just do your research
We don't ever make mistakes
Look death in the eye like every day
I live for the-

Please stop playing catch up, this is not a race
Please don't call for backup, this is not a game
Put you in the dirt, you throw dirt on my fuckin' name
Push start, hit reverse, I back up in that Wraith
Say I need it when I'm comin' down
Smoke and mirrors shift, I'm bouncin' off the fucking ground
Perky just kicked in, I feel like I'm evolvin'
Broski got no trouble shootin', call that problem-solvin'

I live for the chase
I live for the drugs
I live for the money
I live for the fame, yeah
I live in the clouds
I ain't comin' down
Bitch, I'm here to stay, yeah
Do your research
We don't ever make mistakes
Look death in the eyes like every day
Live for the-

I live for the chase

I live for the chase

I live for the chase

I live for the chase
