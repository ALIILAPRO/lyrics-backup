		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Birds flying high
You know how I feel
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel
Rays driftin' on by, you know how I feel

It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
And I'm feeling, so good, so

The fish in the sea
You know how I feel
Live and run free
You know how I feel
The lights are on the tree
You know how I feel

It's a new day, it's a new dawn
It's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good

Dragonfly out in the sun
You know what I need
But flies on having fun
You know what I need
Sleep in peace when the day is done
That's what I need
And this old world is a new world
And a bold world for me

Oh, you know just how I feel
It's a new day, it's a new dawn
It's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good

Say you know how I feel
Say you know how I feel
Freedom is
