		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  in absence of reason
lost all we believed in
we kneel to all-seeing
decapitators

cleave to your opinions
were doomed to agree on
the lowest of common
denominators

in outlands of reason
wry notions kindle
the fires of eager
illuminators

in absence of reason
lost all we believed in
we kneel to all-seeing
decapitators

cleave to your opinions
were doomed to agree on
the lowest of common
denominators

in outlands of reason
wry notions kindle
the fires of eager
illuminators

in absence of reason
lost all we believed in
we kneel to all-seeing
decapitators

is this what he preaches, incendiary speeches
camouflaged as Nietzsche's
to divide the world into two camps
nothing between "us" and "them

find a way 
tame your fear
it rives your brain
time is drawing near
find a way
contain your fear
grind away
time is drawing near
