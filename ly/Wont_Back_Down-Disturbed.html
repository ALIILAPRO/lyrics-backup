		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every time I look the other way
I'm reminded why I feel so disgraced again
I didn't want to march into the fray
I know I never make the same mistake again

I won't back down (I won't back down)
I won't back down from this fight
I won't back down (I won't back down)
I won't be denied

I'm somebody who cannot pretend
I refuse to drown in my shame again
I know that there will be an end (end, end)
So I will never fail to stand my ground again

I won't back down (I won't back down)
I won't back down from this fight
I won't back down (I won't back down)
I won't be denied

Hey, hey
Get up, get up
Hey, hey
Come on, come on
Hey, hey
Get up, get up
Come on, raow
Hey, hey
Get up, get up
Hey, hey
Come on, come on
Hey, hey
Get up, get up
Come on

I won't back down (I won't back down)
I won't back down from this fight
I won't back down (I won't back down)
I won't be denied
I won't back down (I won't back down)
I won't back down from this fight
I won't back down (I won't back down)
I won't be denied now
