		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  God I been tryna keep you closer
Devil tellin' me it's over
Hard to hear the truth in the midst of war
A battle on my shoulders
All them times spent layin' wide awake
My thoughts keep gettin' colder
Matter-of-fact I'd take the long road
If it helps me keep my closure
I had to dream on
God imma lean on you
Said it won't be long
Till all your dreams come true
But it's been hard to keep my focus
Toe to toe with my emotions
Don't know who to put my hope in
It feels like every day's the same you never learn do you
Don't get confused it ain't what you do
My heart it burns for you
It was on that cross I payed it all
I took my turn for you
And it don't matter if you fall
My heart it yearns for you
My heart it yearns for you
You never learn, learn, learn
This love ain't somethin' you can
Earn, earn, earn
I toss my doubt and watch it
Burn, burn, burn
My heart it longs for you it
Yearns, yearns, yearns
And I'll admit the facts
Sometimes I feel I'm all alone emotions counteract
Look at you and wonder your intentions do you got my back?
God I know you real but sometimes feel like you ain't doin' jack
But I won't admit to that
I ain't trippin' on nobody
But I keep steppin' on myself
These people don't love me
Good thing that I don't need they help
They actin' so buddy
They just that elf up on the shelf
I can do this on my own nah ion need nobody else
That's a lie
Looked me in the mirror face to face with all my pride
I write my problems down that's how I really speak my mind
And I stay focused on His name
I got no one else to blame
It feels like every day's the same you never learn do you
Don't get confused it ain't what you do
My heart it burns for you
It was on that cross I payed it all
I took my turn for you
And it don't matter if you fall
My heart it yearns for you
My heart it yearns for you
You never learn, learn, learn
This love ain't somethin' you can
Earn, earn, earn
I toss my doubt and watch it
Burn, burn, burn
My heart it longs for you it
Yearns, yearns, yearns
