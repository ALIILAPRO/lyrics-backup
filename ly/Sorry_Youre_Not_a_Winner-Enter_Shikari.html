		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Scratch card glory, or waist-low pleasure?
Black eyes, nosebleeds, don't look back now
My white abode, do you remember my white abode?
But it's such a thrill, just to find out

Sorry, you're not
A winner
With the air so cold and a mind so bitter
What have you got
To lose but false intentions
And a life so pretentious?

Scratch card glory, or waist-low pleasure?
Black eyes, nosebleeds, don't look back now
My white abode, do you remember my white abode?
But it's such a thrill, just to find out

Sorry, you're not
A winner
With the air so cold and a mind so bitter
What have you got
To lose but false intentions
And a life so pretentious?

(Scratch card glory) or waist-low pleasure?
(Black eyes, nosebleeds) don't look back now
(My white abode) do you remember?
I sweat, I ache

Sorry, you're not
A winner
With the air so cold and a mind so bitter
What have you got
To lose but false intentions
And a life so pretentious?

What? What? What?

Goodbye, your world is

Insert your coin (insert your coin)
Please try again (please try again)
Insert your coin (insert your coin)
Please try again (please try again)
