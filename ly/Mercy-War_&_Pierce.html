		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel unsafe I feel alone
I could be murdered in my home
A man who kills me will walk free
 
I see their badge I see their gun
My heart tells me that I should run
Don't wanna die under that knee
 
If you gonna have mercy
Have some mercy for me
I'll have some mercy for you
 
As a child I had known
I wanted children of my own
But I can't raise no boy to die
 
It's a shame and it's a pain
To know my blood and family name
Is also known as a bullseye 
 
If you gonna have mercy
Have some mercy for me
I'll have some mercy for you 
 
Tried and true my faith remains.
I've lost more than I've gained.
Do what I can to survive.
 
Might not see another day.
Not because I lost my way.   
And that's not for you to decide.           
 
If you gonna have mercy
Have some mercy for me
I'll have some mercy for you
