		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh you feel that as I take you to them dirt roads deep in your southern roots 
When nobody said life was going to be easy 
And we travel to this emotional roller coaster called life 
And we have our ups and downs 

Just keep in mind 
When you hit rock bottom 
There ain't no where to go but up baby 
Just all you about how you deal wit it you feel me... listen here 

[Chorus]
When life seems hopeless 
It make a n**** lose focus 
Empty beer bottles and roaches, helps to get it off my chest cause 
I'm so stressed and all I here is "f*** the world" [Repeat: x2]

Man ever since life been a gamble 
My life been in shamble 
Double edge sword burnin' both sides of the candle 
"But Cris, you can't handle the truth" 

Don't want to face reailty 
So lord accept my apology 
Please like when police say freeze 
And I ain't do s*** 

But I'm down on my knees 
Its a crooked system but gin straight take the pain away I charge the game 
And put my problems on layaway 
A black man but I feel so blue 

So I smoke green and purple til my dreams come true 
Then my eyes turn red 
Sky turns grey 
Children slangin' white in the hood 

We call it yeah drink old gold 
Down my yellow brick road 
Then rewrite my script til my story's untold 
See I got a little money and my life sped up now 
I'm fallin' and I can't get up

[Chorus: x2]

I had to dream about a dope fiend 
And its strange 'cause he can barely write or read 
But seems to get folks about anything curious about him 
I wanted to talk to him but he was to busy fo that 

But I was more then welcome to walk with him 
As we walked 
He talked and I just listen 
He said there's a big difference between crackas and n****s 

See he said white folks look out fo the white folks but uh black folks blang wit tha black folks 
When they ain't enough black roakz 
When you ooh to make a long story short 
We need pay more attention and do things that are more completes and he told me 

You know I wouldn't say something that wouldn't work and I wouldn't damn sure waste my time telling something that would hurt you 
But you would fall for anything 
If you don't stand for something 

But that's for certain but n****s don't be listen and that s*** be hurting 
No all of us but some of us 
And if we don't hurry up 
They going to bury each and every one of us 
 
[Chorus: x2]

Sometimes I can't deal wit my daily issues 
Just being sober lifes a b**** and I can't control her 
I wish I could and sometimes to cry on 
We need a shoulder 

The government stand us up 
To run us over 
And in the hood they don't seem to understand 
Goddamn!

What's really got me wondering 
Is if its a part of a bigger plan man 
I smell some thing fishy goin on and its way beyond blowin' away the smoke from these swishers 
Goin' on it ain't much I can do about it but preach the word of telling my people to spend ya money 

Wisely don't be obscured
By some things that depreciated like what like a home to open ya eyes to 
What's the f***s that's goings on 
'Cause the constantly getting rid of us one by one Whether Its drugs or diseases or gun by

Gun I ain't no saint either I feel that 
I'm even doing wrong by usin this chorus to get through this song

[Chorus: x2]

You know y'all going to mess around and complain about slavery that was over 40, 
50 years ago black folks need to move on
Y'all keep playin wit a crackerthey going to have yo a** tied up 
Wired up to them back roads south Florida, Georgia

And they made hem laws say they can't do anything for you
Can a church get a amen and god for them thugs too
Amen
