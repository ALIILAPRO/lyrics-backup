		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Last night a little dancer came dancin' to my door
Last night a little angel came pumping on the floor
She said, come on baby, I got a license for love
And if it expires, pray help from above
Because
In the midnight hour she cried, more, more, more
With a rebel yell she cried, more, more, more
In the midnight hour, babe, more, more, more
With a rebel yell, more, more, more
More, more, more

She don't like slavery, she won't sit and beg
But, when I'm tired and lonely she sees me to bed
What set you free and brought you to me, babe
What sets you free, I need you hear by me
Because

In the midnight hour she cried, more, more, more
With a rebel yell she cried, more, more, more
In the midnight hour, babe, more, more, more
With a rebel yell, more, more, more

He lives in his own heaven
Collects it to go from the seven eleven
Well he's out all night to collect a fare
Just so long, just so long, it don't mess up his hair

I walked the ward with you, babe
A thousand miles with you
I dried your tears of pain, babe
A million times for you

I'd sell my soul for you, babe
For money to burn for you
I'd give you all, and have none, babe
Justa, justa, justa, justa to have you here by me

Because
In the midnight hour she cried, more, more, more
With a rebel yell she cried, more, more, more
In the midnight hour, babe, more, more, more
With a rebel yell she cried, more, more, more
More, more, more

Oh yeah little baby
She want more
More, more, more, more, more

Oh yeah little angel
She want more
More, more, more, more, more
