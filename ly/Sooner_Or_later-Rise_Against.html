		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here we burn the boats to ashes
After beaching on the shore
Looked back across the ocean
Said we're never going home
And our shadows killed the flowers
Our footsteps spoiled the land
It seems we're always in the way
No matter where we choose to stand

Can we just wait 'til this is over
If we know that our precious time is running out

Sooner or later, comes a time 
When we will reap what we have sown
Sooner or later, we all have to go, oh whoa
Sooner or later, there's a time to face the music
Face the sound
Sooner or later, we will have to go

From the gods we all seek favor
With every sacrificial lamb
But the bodies all pile higher
And the blood just stains our hands
And soon you'll feel the panic
In your breath and in your veins
When you know there's no tomorrow
And you've realized too late

And still we wait
While our precious time is running out

Sooner or later, comes a time 
When we will reap what we have sown
Sooner or later, we all have to go, oh whoa
Sooner or later, there's a time to face the music
Face the sound
Sooner or later, we will have to go

Our precious time is running out

Are we just passing
Just so sick of waiting
For this final destination
Where we all will end up
I would die to know, die to know that place

Sooner or later, comes a time 
When we will reap what we have sown
Sooner or later, we all have to go, oh whoa
Sooner or later, comes a time
When we'll have nowhere left to run
Sooner or later, we will have to go home
