		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel my story is still untold
But I'll make my own happy ending

This is a simulation
This is a simulation
This is a simulation
This is for demonstration

This is a simulation
This is a simulation
This is a simulation
This is for demonstration

This is a simulation
This is for demonstration
This is a lonely illusion
This is my only delusion
This is the realm of my wildest dreams
These are my wildest dreams

If it's all over my face
It's all in my mind
You don't get to be unkind

This is a simulation
This is for demonstration
This is a lonely illusion
This is my only delusion
This is the realm of my wildest dreams
These are my wildest dreams

If it's all over my face
It's all in my mind
You don't get to let it slide
You don't get to let it slide

All this is mine
I realize
Such a perfect
Simulation
I see your face
All over the place
Pixelation
A lonely illusion
A heartfelt fantasy
Pure creation
Not so far 
Beyond
My wildest dreams

This is a simulation
This is a simulation
This is a simulation
This is a, this is a simulation
