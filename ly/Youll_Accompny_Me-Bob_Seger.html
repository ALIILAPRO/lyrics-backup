		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A gypsy wind is blowing warm tonight
The sky is starlit and the time is right
And still you're telling me you have to go
Before you leave there's something you should know
Yeah something you should know babe

I've seen you smiling in the summer sun
I've seen your long hair flying when you run
I've made my mind up that it's meant to be
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Out where the rivers meet the sounding sea
You're high above me now
You're wild and free ah, but
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me

Some people say that love's a losing game
You start with fire
But you lose the flame
The ashes smolder
But the warmth's soon gone
You end up cold and lonely on your own
I'll take my chances babe
I'll risk it all
I'll win your love
Or I'll take the fall
I've made my mind up girl
It's meant to be
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
It's written down somewhere
It's got to be
You're high above me
Flying wild and free
Oh but someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Out where the rivers meet the sounding sea
I feel it in my soul
It's meant to be
Oh someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
You'll accomp'ny me, uh, uh, uh
You'll accomp'ny me, I know you will accomp'ny me
(You'll accomp'ny me) someday lady, someday lady
(You'll accomp'ny me) you gonna accom'ny now
You gonna walk with me and talk with me, and (you'll accomp'ny me)
(You'll accomp'ny me) uh, uh, uh
(You'll accomp'ny me) you gonna accomp'ny me uh, uh, uh
You gonna accomp'ny me (you gonna accomp'ny me) someday uh, uh, uh
