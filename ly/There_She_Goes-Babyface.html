		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's something about her
You know, it's the way that she carries herself
She's just so bad
Ooh, I don't know

Her style, her mind
Compares to nothing on this Earth
She's not the kind to share
Only God knows what she's worth

I got to show her that I want her
I recognize that she is bad
If I can't have her then I'll go crazy
Spending all my time just chasing

I got to show her that I want her
I recognize that she is bad
If I can't have her then I'll go crazy
Spending all my time just chasing

Her eyes, her smile
Her skin, her smell, her hair
(She's incredible baby, ooh)
Her walk, her talk
Her way her savoir faire
There she goes
(Oh baby)

I hope to find her there
Gotta make some eye contact
She's not the kind to stare
Move quick or lose her fast

I got to show her that I want her
I recognize that she is bad
If I can't have her then I'll go crazy
Spending all my time just chasing

I got to show her that I want her
I recognize that she is bad
If I can't have her then I'll go crazy
Spending all my time just chasing

Her eyes, her smile
Her skin, her smell, her hair
(Ooh baby, she's incredible baby, ooh)
Her walk, her talk
Her way her savoir faire
There she goes
(There she goes)
Her eyes, her smile
Her skin, her smell, her hair
(You're incredible baby)
Her walk, her talk
Her way her savoir faire
There she goes
(There she goes, come on)

Spending all my time watching that girl go
(Dance)
Gotta love her when she moves
(Get down girl)
Spending all my time watching that girl go
(Dance)
Gotta love her when she moves

Her eyes, her smile
Her skin, her smell, her hair
(She's incredible)
Her walk, her talk
Her way her savoir faire
There she goes
(Ooh, there she goes baby)
Her eyes, her smile
Her skin, her smell, her hair
(Ooh baby, you're incredible baby)
Her walk, her talk
Her way her savoir faire
There she goes
(There she goes, baby)
Her eyes, her smile
Her skin, her smell, her hair
(Ooh baby, she's incredible baby, ooh)
Her walk, her talk
Her way her savoir faire
There she goes
(There she goes)
Her eyes, her smile
Her skin, her smell, her hair
(Oh)
Her walk, her talk
Her way her savoir faire
There she goes
(There she goes)

I got to show her that I want her
I recognize that she is bad
If I can't have her then I'll go crazy
Spending all my time just chasing

Spending all my time watching that girl go
(Dance)
Gotta love her when she moves
(Get down girl)
Spending all my time watching that girl go
(Dance)
Gotta love her when she moves
