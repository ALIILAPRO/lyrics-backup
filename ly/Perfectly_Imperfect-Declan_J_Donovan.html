		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're the last crack on the pavement
You're the water running cold
Into the wild, washed up and wasted
You're staying up
You're staying up at night

You're the flower in the concrete
Find your way into the light
I wanna show you what you can't see
You're keeping me up
Keeping me up at night

So let me give you every color that I find
In your eyes

You wake me up
And it breaks my heart
That you're perfectly imperfect
You're hurting but you're worth it
You don't know why
I would waste my time
But I'm falling and I mean it
I want you like I need it
There's nothing you could try to change my mind
'Cause I'm in love with you

You live like you're a secret
One that only I could know
'Cause I said
You know what I want and
I know who you are
I know when I hold you and love you
You'll get up and go before you fall apart
I'll bring you every colour that I find
In your eyes

You wake me up
And it breaks my heart
That you're perfectly imperfect
You're hurting but you're worth it
You don't know why
I would waste my time
But I'm falling and I mean it
I want you like I need it
There's nothing you could try to change my mind
'Cause I'm in love

So call me when you want me and I'll come running
Find me waiting at your door
So tell me if you're lonely and it won't last long
'Cause I'm in love with you (you)

You wake me up
And it breaks my heart
That you're perfectly imperfect

You wake me up
And it breaks my heart
That you're perfectly imperfect
You're hurting but you're worth it

You don't know why
I would waste my time
But I'm falling and I mean it
I want you like I need it
There's nothing you could try to change my mind
'Cause I'm in love with you
