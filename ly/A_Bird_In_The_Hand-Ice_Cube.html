		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fresh out of school cause I was a high school grad
Gots to get a job 'cause I was a high school dad
Wish I got paid like I was rappin' to the nation
But that's not likely so here's my application
Pass it to the man at AT&T
'Cause when I was in school I got the A-E-E
But there's no S-E for this youngsta
I didn't have no money so now I have to punch the 
Clock like a slave, that's what be happenin'
But whitey says there's no room for the African
Always knew that I would clock G's
But welcome to McDonald's can I take your order please
Gotta sell ya food that might give you cancer
'Cause my son doesn't take no for an answer
Now I pay taxes that you never give me back
What about diapers, bottles, and similac
Do I gotta go sell me a whole lotta crack
For decent shelter and clothes on my back?
Or should I just wait for help from Bush
Or Jesse Jackson, and operation Push
If you ask me the whole thing needs a douche
A masengel what the hell cracker sell in the neighborhood
To the corner house bitches
Miss porker, little Joe or Todd Bridges
Or anybody that he know
So I got me a bird, better known as a kilo
Now everybody know I went from po' to a nigga that got dough
So now you put the feds against me
'Cause I couldn't follow the plan of the presidency
I'm never givin' love again
But blacks are too fuckin' broke to be republican
Now I remember I used to be cool
Till I stopped fillin' out my W-2
Now senators are gettin' high
And your plan against the ghetto backfired
So now you got a pep talk
But sorry, this is our only room to walk
'Cause we don't want to drug push
But a bird in the hand is worth more than the bush

Tell the politicians, the hustlers, live and let live (yeah)
Tell the politicians, the hustlers, live and let live (yeah)
