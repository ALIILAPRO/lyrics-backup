		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sorry

These mistakes, I've made my fair share
When you needed me, I wasn't there
I was young, I was dumb, I was so immature
And the things that I did made you so insecure
But, baby, I'm still your man, I swear

Please be patient with me
Please be patient with me
I know I'm not what you need
But, baby, I'm gonna be
So please be patient with me

Is it too much (Is it too much?) that I'm asking for?
Can we start over? (Can we start over?) Can we end this war?
I've been taking your love, I've been wasting your time
But is there still a chance of me changing your mind?
Before you (yeah) go walking out the door

Oh, you know I'm not perfect
If you leave, I deserve it
But, baby, all I'm asking you is please, please (Oh)

Please be patient with me (patient with me)
Please be patient with me (patient with me)
I know I'm not what you need (I know I'm not what you need)
But, baby, I'm gonna be (baby, I'm gonna be)
So please be patient with me (patient with me)

Oh, you don't wanna wait another minute
You don't wanna wait another night
Just trust me, just trust me, just trust me, baby
You don't wanna wait another minute, no
You don't wanna wait another night
Just trust me, just trust me, just trust me, baby

Please be patient with me
Please be patient with me
I know I'm not what you need
But, baby, I'm gonna be
So please be patient with me
Please be patient with me (patient with me)
Please be patient with me, yeah
I know I'm not what you need (I know I'm not what you need)
But, baby, I'm gonna be
So please be patient with me
