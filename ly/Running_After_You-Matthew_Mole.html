		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Of all of the places and all of the spaces
That I've ever seen
And that I've ever been
It's true

I'd walk through a town
I could only have dreamed
But the beauty surrounding
Means nothing to me, it's you

Where you are is where I always want to be
Anywhere, as long as you are there with me
I will take you to the places I have seen
Take my heart and run along

'Cause I'm running after you
I'm running after you
And I'll do what I can do
And I'll do it all for you

We'll come back home
We'll come back home one day
But right now we are called to see a place
That where you and I will change the world we know
Anywhere that I'm with you is home

Where you are is where I always want to be
Anywhere, as long as you are there with me
I will take you to the places I have seen
Take my heart and run along

'Cause I'm running after you
I'm running after you
And I'll do what I can do
I'll do it all for you

All the things that we will see
And all the things we'll know
Take my hand and walk with me
We'll never be alone

'Cause I'm running after you
I'm running after you
And I'll do what I can do
I'll do it all for you

And I'll do it all for you
