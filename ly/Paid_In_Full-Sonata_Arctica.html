		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was nowhere near ready when all it ended
So I hoped we could find a new day, cannot live without you

You gave me the chance, time and again in vain
Now my feelings for you
Every tear, every smile, paid in full
Wrecked the chain, but no longer can I take the pain

It's hard for me to love myself right now
I waited, hated, blamed it all on you

Needed to be strong, yet I was always too weak
So again only blamed myself for this state we are in
I will take what you have for me now, it's not too late

Did you change? I did too
Love can grow from the last grain

It's hard for me to love myself right now
I waited, hated, blamed it all on you

I need you less and less every day
Fix this moral decay
Yet I've grown to love you even more

My fault that you then turned another cheek
You mouth the words, you're not ready to speak
You're scared of me, although I never had a clue
That I'd become so much stronger than you

I will take what you have for me now if it's not too late
If you like I will leave, I will not miss the last train again

It's hard for me to love myself right now
I waited, hated, blamed it all on you
It's hard for me to love your face right now
I'm waiting, hating, needing, being me

I need you less and less
And every day leads us farther away
From that moment

It's hard for me to hate myself right now
Finally I'm understanding me
One day we may have whole new me's and you's
But first I need to learn to love me too
