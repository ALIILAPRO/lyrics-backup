		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Darling, I'm a masterpiece, a work of art
Hi, my name is Fabulous, your favorite star
Diamonds on my wrist, come blow me a kiss
'Cause, hi, my name is Fabulous, your favorite star

Oh, when I walk down the boulevard, people call my name
"Oh my God, look there she goes again", hear them whispering
"She's so bad, but she's classy"
"How she do it?" Don't ask me
They all wanna hold my hand
Got 'em all saying, "Damn, girl"

Darling, I'm a masterpiece, a work of art
Hi, my name is Fabulous, your favorite star
Diamonds on my wrist, come blow me a kiss
'Cause, hi, my name is Fabulous, your favorite star

Takin' pictures, signin' autographs, roses on the stage
Don't you know I'm rare like caviar, tasty on your plate
I'm so bad, I'm so classy
How I do it? Don't ask me
They all wanna be my fan
I got 'em all saying, "Damn, girl"

Darling, I'm a masterpiece, a work of art
Hi, my name is Fabulous, your favorite star
Diamonds on my wrist, come blow me a kiss
'Cause, hi, my name is Fabulous, your favorite star

I'm your sunshine, I'm your star
Babe, without me won't get far
So divine, I'm off the charts
Masterpiece, a work of art

Darling, I'm a masterpiece, a work of art
Hi, my name is Fabulous, your favorite star
Diamonds on my wrist, come blow me a kiss
'Cause, hi, my name is Fabulous, your favorite star
