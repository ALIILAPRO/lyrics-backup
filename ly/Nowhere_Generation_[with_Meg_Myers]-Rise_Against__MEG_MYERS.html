		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We are the nowhere generation
We are the kids that no one wants
We are a credible threat to the rules you set
A cause to be alarmed
We are not the names that we've been given
We speak a language you don't know
We are the nowhere generation
The nowhere generation, oh-whoa

And one day
All the walls will come down
All the doors will open
All the roads will lead home
But right now
We are spiraling down
And the longer we wait
The further we go

I know we're slipping through the cracks now
No place left on your map now to call home

We are the nowhere generation
We are the kids that no one wants
We are a credible threat to the rules you set
A cause to be alarmed
We are not the names that we've been given
We speak a language you don't know
We are the nowhere generation
The nowhere generation, oh-whoa

And for your sweat, you'll be rewarded
They told us every day
There's a land of milk and honey
And it's not that far away
But the finish line kept moving
And the promises wore thin
And the smoke on the horizon
Was the burning promised land

And this place used to be somewhere
But they sold it out from under us
Our voices all ignored

We are the nowhere generation
We are the kids that no one wants
We are a credible threat to the rules you set
A cause to be alarmed
We are not the names that we've been given
We speak a language you don't know
We are the nowhere generation
The nowhere generation, oh-whoa

And yet we climb these burning ladders
Still we raise for them the hammers
Swinging low
"And what exactly are we after?"
They will ask
And we will answer

We are the nowhere generation
We are the kids that no one wants
We are a credible threat to the rules you set
A cause to be alarmed
We are not the names that we've been given
We speak a language you don't know
We are the nowhere generation
Oh oh (we are the nowhere generation)
Oh oh (we are the nowhere generation)
We are the nowhere generation
We are the nowhere generation
The nowhere generation
