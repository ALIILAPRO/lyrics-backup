		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We dreamed a dream - woke up and lived it
We had the music in our hands
The drops of rain - became a river
And now it´s time to end this dance
- So thank you

My mamma said that the best thing in life
Was getting me
And loving somebody higher than anything
else in this world baby
My mamma said that she would give her
life up for me

My mamma said that the worst thing in life
Is getting used
to loving somebody higher than anything
else in this world baby
Knowing you´re going to
Knowing you´re going to - lose it all

Mamma don´t leave - don´t go
Don´t run - don´t hide - don´t cry
Don´t ever feel scared now
Mamma just crossed just crossed
To the parallel world
She crossed she crossed to the multiverse
Circling protons - all vibrations
Circling neutrons - all vibrations
Mamma just crossed just crossed to the parallel world
She crossed she crossed to the multiverse
And now you´re lying there - taking your last breath
I´m holding back the tears - Oh mamma don´t die

My mamma said...

Mamma hold on - give in - let go
Release yourself from everything out there
Mamma just crossed just crossed
To the parallel world
She crossed she crossed to the multiverse
Circling electrons - all vibrations
Circling electrons - all vibrations
Mamma just crossed just crossed to the parallel world
She crossed she crossed to the multiverse
And now you´re lying there - taking your last breath
I´m holding back the tears - Oh mamma don´t die
