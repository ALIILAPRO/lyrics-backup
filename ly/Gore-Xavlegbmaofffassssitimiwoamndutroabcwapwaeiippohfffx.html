		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ripping out the intestines from a lobotomized planet
Ravaging through the meat trying to remove the pus
Ravaging through the meat trying to remove the pus
Carnem Comedenti
Mutating the bio organisms into pulsating muscle

Genetically altering the planet to feed our hunger
Sinew and fat making up the skin layers
Now tendon and brawn that used to be plant matter
Predators of planets they feast on blood and Gore
Flesh eating cannibals devouring all protoplasm
With the ability to sense and conduct stimuli

'Craving its beating heart
A species of rapacious scum'

Peeling away at the layers of skin
Genetically altering the planet to feed our hunger
Sinew and fat making up the skin layers
Now tendon and brawn that used to be plant matter
Predators of planets they feast on blood and Gore

Treading through soggy flesh my feet are soaking wet with blood

Flesh eating cannibals devouring all protoplasm
With the ability to sense and conduct stimuli

Craving its beating heart
A species of rapacious scum'

Behold planet Gore
We feast yet again
Burning every lesion before septicaemia sets in
Organs lie upon the ground no justice to be found
Carving at this meat to the rhythm of the beat
This is my retreat

This is a planet made of Gore
This is a planet made of Gore
