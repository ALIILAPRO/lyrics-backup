		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will darken these exhaulted summers,
and let you dwell in the blissful cold!
Heal yourself into pure realities
explore the light from the other seal!

Whispering like the silent mouth of tomorrow
Please give a cure for my sorrow!

Your radiance sparkles like fiery dust
blisters in the wind of the absolute.
The satin web of thy imprisonment 
shackles the muse of dreams come true.

Your theatre stands empty now
so we have lost you anyhow!

Luciferi, Eden's rapture
Luciferi, Nighttime Angelicah

The Garden bloomed in bright colours
and no angel passed through the silent tunnel.
The tears I weep lies frozen cold
you've slipped away in the fire.
Embrace me now in my final breath
Continue to grow, my flower of death!

Life is death's theatre;
A flame of silent winter where you left me alone.
In the desolation of a broken promised land,
you've slipped away in it's fire in the fire.

In sadness, your mirthless winter
I bring gold to those who dread the sun.
Within my tears grows a flower of truth,
and I gave my love to the eventide.

O amaranth, bloom in my heart
They shall never keep us apart!

Luciferi, Fallen from heaven
Luciferi, Nighttime angelicah 

The Garden bloomed in nights colour
And an angel passed through the silent tunnel.

Luciferi
