		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes i feel like i'm all alone
Wondering of what have i done wrong.
Maybe i'm just missing you all along
When will you be coming home
Back to me?

There were times i felt like giving up.
Haunted by memories i can't give up.
Wish that i never let you go and slip away,
Had enough reasons for you to stay.

Can you feel me,
See me falling away.
Did you hear me,
I'm calling out your name.
'cause i'm barely hanging on
Baby, you need to come home
Back to me.

Sleepless nights,
'cause you're not here by my side
Cold as ice,
I feel deep down inside.
Maybe i'm just missing you all along
When will you be coming home

Can you feel me,
See me falling away
Did you hear me,
I'm calling out your name.
'cause i'm barely hanging on
Baby, you need to come home
When will you be coming home
Back to me.
