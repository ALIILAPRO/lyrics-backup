		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lookin' for a way out, for a way out
I was so caught up that I couldn't find a way out
Find a way out, yeah
Playin' through my weakness, can I beat this?
Can I crack this surface? into to the deepness, the deepness
Oh, where I've exhausted all my ways, all my ways
And all the noise begins to fade

It's You
Then everything else just falls in line
You
You will always hold this heart of mine
It's You, it's You
Lord, it's You
Then everything else just falls in line

It's You, it's You
Then everything else just falls in line

It's You, it's You
Then everything else just falls in line

I'm into the newness, the new bliss 
Me and You together
Tell me how to loop this, to loop this-this-this-this-this
To go on forever, road of crescendo, goodbye limbo
Like a new day dawning, show me the window, the window

Where I can see it's You
Then everything else just falls in line
You
You will always hold this heart of mine
It's You, it's You
Lord, it's You
Then everything else just falls in line

It's You, it's You
Then everything else just falls in line

It's You, it's You
Then everything else just falls in line

Don't make no sense without You 
Don't make no sense at all 
Don't make no sense without You
Don't make no sense at all 
It don't make no sense without You
It don't make no sense at all 
Don't make no sense without You
Don't make no sense at all 
I can't do this life without You
I can't do this life at all 
It don't make no sense without You
It don't make no sense at all 

It's You
It's You
Then everything else just falls in line
You
You will always hold this heart of mine
It's You, it's You
Lord, it's You
Then everything else just falls in line

It's You, it's You
Then everything else just falls in line

Ain't no one else
Ain't no one else will do
It's You, it's You
Then everything else just falls in line
Don't make no sense without You
(Ain't no one else, ain't no one else will do)
Don't make no sense at all (it's You, it's You)
Don't make no sense without You (ain't no one else, ain't no one else will do)
Don't make no sense at all (it's You, it's You)
