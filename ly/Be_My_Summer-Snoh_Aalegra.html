		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you be my summer?
Protect me from the rain?
Be my summer
Protect me from the rain (protect me from the rain)
Protect me from the rain, oh
Be my summer
Protect me from the rain
Be my summer
Protect me

I tried to run away
There's no escape, you've taken tenure in my heart
I can't change how I feel
Tried moving on, but I'm right here where we left off

Naked walls at my place when you met me
Now they're dressed up with my mama's poetry
You were oceans away, but you fell deep
Didn't you?
I know we both not sure what lies ahead of us
Can you? (Can you, you?)

Be my summer
Protect me from the rain?
Be my summer
Protect me from the rain (protect me from the rain)
Protect me from the rain, oh
Be my summer
Protect me from the rain
Be my summer
Protect me

Drifting, I'm castaway
Just like the waves you get your way and leave me lost
Come show me how you feel
We're running out of time, I don't wanna see this fall

All these walls that you've built, they don't scare me
I can stop these withdrawals if you let me
I know you tried, but you couldn't forget me
Didn't you?
I know we both not sure what lies ahead of us
Can you? (Can you?)

Be my summer
Protect me from the rain?
Be my summer
Protect me from the rain
Protect me from the rain, oh
Be my summer
Protect me from the rain
Be my summer
Protect me
