		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lying in your arms
So close together
Didn't know just what I had
Now I toss and turn
'Cause I'm without you
How I'm missing you so bad

Where was my head?
Where was my heart?
Now I cry alone in the dark

I lie awake
I drive myself crazy
Drive myself crazy
Thinking of you
Made a mistake
When I let you go baby
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I do
(Wanting you the way that I do)

I was such a fool
I couldn't see it
Just how good you were to me
You confessed your love
Undying devotion
I confessed my need to be free

And now I'm left
With all this pain
I've only got myself to blame, yeah

I lie awake
I drive myself crazy
Drive myself crazy
Thinking of you
Made a mistake
I let you go baby
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I do
(Wanting you the way that I do)

Why didn't I know it?
(How much I loved you baby)
Why couldn't I show it?
(If I had only told you)
When I had the chance
Oh I had the chance

Wanting you the way that I do
I lie awake
I drive myself crazy
Drive myself crazy
Thinking of you
Made a mistake
I let you go baby
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I do

I lie awake
I drive myself crazy
Drive myself crazy
Thinking of you (crazy, crazy, yeah)
Made a mistake (made a mistake)
I let you go baby
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I do
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I do
