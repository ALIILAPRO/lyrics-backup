		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get your fucking hands up
Get on out of your seats
All eyes on me, all eyes on me
Get your fucking hands up
Get on out of your seats
All eyes on me, all eyes on me

Are you feeling nervous? Are you having fun?
It's almost over, it's just begun
Don't overthink this, look in my eye
Don't be scared, don't be shy
Come on in, the water's fine

We're going to go where everybody knows
Everybody knows, everybody, ooh
We're going to go where everybody knows
Everybody knows

Get your fucking hands up
Get on out of your seat
All eyes on me, all eyes on me
Ay, come on, get your fucking hands up
Get on out of your seat
All eyes on me, all eyes on me, yeah

Heads down, pray for me
Heads down, now, pray for me
Get your fucking hands up
Get on out of your seat
All eyes on me, all eyes on me

You wanna hear a funny story? 
So, uh, five years ago, I quit performing live comedy
Because I was beginning to have, uh, severe panic attacks while on stage
Which is not a good place to have them
So I, I quit and I didn't perform for five years
And I spent that time trying to improve myself mentally
And you know what? I did! I got better! 
I got so much better, in fact, that in January of 2020
I thought, "You know what? I should start performing again
I've been hiding from the world, and I need to re-enter
And then, the funniest thing happened

Are you feeling nervous? Are you having fun?
It's almost over, it's just begun
Don't overthink this, look in my eye
Don't be scared, don't be shy
Come on in, the water's fine

You say the ocean's rising like I give a shit
You say the whole world's ending, honey, it already did
You're not gonna slow it, heaven knows you tried
Got it? Good, now get inside

We're going to go where everybody knows
Everybody knows, everybody knows
We're going to go where everybody knows
Everybody knows

C'mon, get your fucking hands up
Get on out of your seat
All eyes on me, all eyes on me
Come on get your fucking hands up
Get on out of your seats
All eyes on me, all eyes on me, yeah

Hands down, pray for me
Heads down now, pray for me
I said, get your fucking hands up
Get up, get up
I'm talking to you, get the fuck up

Get your fucking hands up
Get on out of your seat
All eyes on me, all eyes on me
Hey, c'mon, get your fucking hands up
Get on out of your seat
All eyes on me, all eyes on me, yeah

Come on, heads down, pray for me
Heads down now, pray for me
I said, get your fucking hands up
Get, haha
All eyes on me, all eyes on me
