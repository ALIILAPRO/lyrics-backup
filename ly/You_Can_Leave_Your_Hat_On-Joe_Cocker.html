		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, take off your coat
Real slow
And take off your shoes
I'll take off your shoes
Baby, take off your dress
Yes, yes, yes

You can leave your hat on
You can leave your hat on
You can leave your hat on

Go over there
Turn on the light
Hey, all the lights
Come over here
Stand on that chair
Yes, that's right
Raise your arms up in the air
Now shake 'em
Now give me a reason to live
You give me a reason to live
You give me a reason to live
You give me a reason to live
Sweet darling

(You can leave your hat on)
You can leave your hat on
Feeling (you can leave your hat on)
You can leave your hat on

(You can leave your hat on)
(You can leave your hat on)

Suspicious minds are talkin'
They're tryin' to tear us apart
They don't believe in this love of mine
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
Well, I know what love is
Put it my way

(You can leave your hat on)
You can leave your hat on
Free world (You can leave your hat on)
Yes, this is reason to live
(You can leave your hat on) You can leave your hat on
