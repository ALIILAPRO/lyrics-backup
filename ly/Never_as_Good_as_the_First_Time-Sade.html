		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Good times, they come and they go
Never going to know
What fate is going to blow
Your way, just hope that it feels right
Sometimes it comes and it goes
You take it ever so slow
And then you lose it
And then it flows right to you
So we rely on the past
And special moments that last
Were they as tender
As we dare to remember?
Such a fine time as this
What could equal the bliss
The thrill of the first kiss
It'll blow right to you

It's never as good as the first time
Never as good as the first time
(Never as good as the first time)

Good times, they come and they go
Never going to know
It's like the weather
One day chicken, next day feathers
The rose we remember
The thorns we forget
We'd love and leave
We never spend a minute on regret
It is a possibility
The more we know, the less we see
Second time is not quite what it seemed
Natural as the way we came to be
The second time won't live up to the dream

It's never as good as the first time
(Never as good as the first time)
Never as good as the first time
(Never as good as the first time)

Ba-da-da-da, bum-bum-bum
Ba-ba-da-da-da, bum-bum
Ba-da-da-da, bum-bum-bum
Ba-ba-da-da-da, bum-bum

Natural as the way we came to be
Second time won't live up to the dream
As natural as the way we came to be
The second time is not quite what it seemed

It's never as good as the first time
As the first time
Never as good as the first time (the first time)

Natural as the way we came to be
Second time won't live up to the dream
As natural as the way we came to be
Second time is not quite what it seemed

It's never, ooh
As good as the first time (as good)
As the first time
As good as the first time (first time)

Ba-da-da-da, bum-bum-bum
Ba-ba-da-da-da, bum-bum
Ba-da-da-da, bum-bum-bum
Ba-ba-da-da-da, bum-bum
