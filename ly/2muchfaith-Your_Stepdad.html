		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Too much faith in these weak hoes
That love shit got played out
Tell me why I can't leave
Her 'lone, she cut, copied, and pasted out
In my dreams, my thoughts
It's holding me from my boss shit
(My good sir, october cooked that beat)
Twenty minutes go to four hours
I fell in love with a boss bitch
Fishing all day, looking 'round for a queen
I still ain't caught shit
On the phone with a bad ho
Inspiring me to write raw shit
I'm hurt as hell 'cause I really
Like her, that's my fault
I fall quick for these hoes

I don't really be pulling bitches, it shows
(Huh) i don't really be hanging 'round
Thesе actors called my bros (Huh)
Weird niggas get turnеd on by these
Hoes just 'cause of toes (Uh)
Weird ass lil' boy
Judging other niggas based off of clothes
(Huh) let me stay in my soapbox while
I'm worried 'bout my goals (Huh)
Every day, smoking big dope
I'ma puff-puff 'til I doze (Uh)
Told myself
"I don't need a bitch" I don't
Like the life I chose (Huh)
Solo dolo my lifestyle, it's cool as hell
I suppose (Ayy, haha, yeah, yeah, look)

Too much faith in these weak hoes
That love shit got played out
Tell me why I can't leave
Her 'lone, she cut, copied, and pasted out
In my dreams, my thoughts
It's holding me from my boss shit
Twenty minutes go to four hours
I fell in love with a boss bitch
Fishing all day, looking 'round for a queen
I still ain't caught shit
On the phone with this bad ho
Inspiring me to write raw shit
(My good sir, october cooked that beat)
I'm hurt as hell 'cause I really
Like her, that's my fault
I fall quick for these hoes
