		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The time has come again
Slowly walking down the steps
To where she would have been
If only they were seventeen

Waiting patiently
He stood between her fray scene
Hiding from himself
As well as everybody else

Without a mission
His face became lent
He thought that he learned
How to not get upset
From folded notes in envelopes
Meet me beneath the moon
Don't go too soon
She went too soon

The time has come again
Slowly walking down the steps
To where she would have been
If only they were seventeen
