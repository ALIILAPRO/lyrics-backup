		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The rush, the sweat
The high you get
You feel your body leaving

The taste, the way you chase the wave
You're jumping in the deep end

If there's no finding my way back I-
I find I'm finding my way back, no lie
(How high's too high come back down?
How high's too high come back down?)

So high like the ceiling
So high on this feeling
That's lifting me up off the ground
How high's too high come back, come back down?
To come back, come back down
To come back down

Divisive sounds, these ups and downs
The trip is where you take it
We're face to face, we elevate
There's no way to escape it

If there's no finding my way back I
I find I'm finding my way back, no lie
(How high's too high come back down?
How high's too high come back down?)

So high like the ceiling
So high on this feeling
That's lifting me up off the ground
How high's too high come back, come back down?
To come back, come back down
To come back, come back down
So high like the ceiling
So high on this feeling
Lifting me up off the ground
How high's too high come back, come back down?

(I am sound, go round and round
I can't tell my up from down
I am sound, go round and round
Feels too high to come back down)

How high's too high come back down?
How high's too high come back down?
So high like the ceiling
So high on this feeling
That's lifting me up off the ground
How high's too high come back down?

(To come back, come back down
To come back, come back down)
How high's too high come back down?
