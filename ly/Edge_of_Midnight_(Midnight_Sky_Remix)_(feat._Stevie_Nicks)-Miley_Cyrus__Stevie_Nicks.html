		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, it's been a long night and the mirror's telling me to go home
But it's been a long time since I felt this good on my own (uh)
Lotta years went by with my hands tied up in your ropes
Forever and ever, no more (no more)

The midnight sky is the road I'm takin'
Head high up in the clouds (oh, oh)

I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (by you)
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, oh no
Don't need to be loved by you
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh
Loved by you

La, la, la-la, la
Midnight

And the days go by like a strand in the wind
In the web that is my own, I begin again
I said to my friend, eh (everything stopped)
Nothing else mattered (nothing else mattered)
(no more)

The midnight sky is the road I'm takin'
Head high up in the clouds (oh, oh)

I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (by you)
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, oh no
Don't need to be loved by you
See my lips on her mouth, everybody's talkin' now, baby
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh
Just like the white winged dove (just like the white winged dove)
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh

Falling on, on the edge of
Seventeen
I don't hide blurry eyes like you
Like you

I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (by you)
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, you know
Don't need to be loved by you
Just like the white winged dove (just like the white winged dove)
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh
Just like the white winged dove (just like the white winged dove)
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh
Loved by you, yeah

La, la, la-la, la
In the midnight
You know it's true
In the midnight
Sky (loved by you)
