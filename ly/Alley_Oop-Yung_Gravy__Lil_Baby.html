		<p>
		  Ay, drunk in Atlanta
I'm at your crib with the pack like I'm Santa (Slat)
With a bitch from Havana
Fuck with the crew
You get peeled like banana (baby)
I pull out, you panic
Ice on my wrist
It took down the Titanic (that's cold, bitch, woo)
I'm at Giuseppe
I'm in the back of the store gettin' Becky (woo)
(Like woo) bitch (baby)

This the type shit that's gon' make them go crazy (like, woo)
I just pulled up in a brand new Mercedes (woo)
She said she pregnant that can't be my baby (woo, yeah)
I was just stuck in the trap and they saved me
(Like woo) bitch, hop out the coupe
Dunk on your bitch and I hang from the hoop

(Like, woo) Bitch, Givenchy my suit
Me and Lil Baby pull up alley oop
(Woo, yeah) Think I'm Nowitzki
I'm at your crib with your mom sippin' whiskey (woo)
Gravy got love for the South
I fuck your bitch at the Waffle House (baby)
Think I'm Larry Bird, bitch
Dunk on your bitch cervix
Talkin' 'bout you heard shit
What you heard, bitch?
Ready my hip, pardon my drip
Reach in my pocket, I pull out yo' bitch
Bentley my whip, came with the grip
Found out my bitch couldn't fit
She fucking thick, bitch

Drunk in Atlanta
I'm at your crib with the pack like I'm Santa
With a bitch from Havana
Fuck with the crew
You get peeled like banana (baby)
I pull out, you panic
Ice on my wrist
It took down the Titanic (that's cold, bitch, woo)
I'm at Giuseppe
I'm in the back of the store gettin' Becky (woo)
Bitch (baby)

This the type shit that's gon' make them go crazy (like, woo)
I just pulled up in a brand new Mercedes (woo)
She said she pregnant that can't be my baby (woo, yeah)
I was just stuck in the trap and they saved me
(Like woo) Bitch, hop out the coupe
Dunk on your bitch and I hang from the hoop

(Like woo) bitch, Burberry suit
Me and Lil Baby pull up alley oop
(Woo, yup) think I'm Tim Duncan
How come your mom and your bitch call me pumpkin
(Woo, ho) dip in the taxi
Fuck on your bitch in the back of the Zaxby's, bitch

I don't play games nigga, know that
I just want to screw it like I'm Kodak
I done got the brain
You can come and get your hoe back
I can find a bag anywhere, fuck a LoJack
I just call the phone when I'm perkin' 'bout to throwback
I'ma let my chains hang everywhere I go at
I done been to chain gang, I don't want to go back

This that hoopin' shit, baby
Yeah I break the pussy's ankles, baby
Dream shake her titties

(Like woo) bitch, hop out the whip
Pull up I'm lookin' like Tokyo Drift
(Woo) bitch I got the gift
Scoop up your mama
Lil bitch in my Lyft
(Woo) bitch Magic Johnson
Pull up I gave her that Magic Johnson
Yeah, I'm in the kitchen
Bitch it's Young Gravy
I splash like I'm Pippen
