		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get up, get in
The operator for the boogeyman,
We sit up, begin
Now levitator please connect me to Holy Ghost
We don't know how to begin
We just end and grab my hand we
We got no love for the man
We just end
Grab your friend
Everybody keep it calm tonight
Everyone we're going live tonight
Everybody's getting on tonight
Everybody's getting on
And so am I
Fed up
All in
They're gonna' make you a star
To get you all to behave
Get up
Cash in
And elevator please direct me to level ten
We all want it again
We're all just born to descend we
Got no love for the end
Got no lines at the end of this
Everybody keep it calm tonight
Everyone we're going live tonight
Everybody's getting on tonight
Everybody's getting on
And so am I

Everybody keep it calm tonight
Everyone we're going live tonight
Everybody's getting on tonight
And so am I
