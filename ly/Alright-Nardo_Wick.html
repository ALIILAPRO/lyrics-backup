		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  I mean I be chillin'
I ain't had no fun in a minute
I'm wicked, I'm wicked, I'm wicked, I'm-
I'm wicked, I'm wicked, I'm wicked, I'm wicked, I'm wicked
Wicked, I'm-, wicked, I'm-
I'm wicked, I'm wicked
(OhKay)

Alright, alright, where's all the fun?
I been chillin' for a minute I miss makin' niggas run
Alright, alright, what is there to do?
Ooh, I know pull up where they be, extend my arm and shoot
Alright, okay, go, go, go
Everybody gets gotted, it ain't no eenie miny moe
Alright, okay, row, row your boat
Turn they hood into a ocean and let's see if they can float

Alright, okay, ski mask, AK
Alright, okay, chase him broad day
Alright, okay, ski mask, AK
Alright, okay, chase him broad day

All my niggas call me Wick and all my bitches call me daddy
All my niggas droppin' shit and all my bitches droppin' panties
You wanna die? Just drop a diss and in my DM leave your addy
When I walk I got a stick, lately been actin' like my granny
A-B-C-D-E F me, everybody know that I'ma a muhfuckin' G
H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O, shh, everybody know that we got muhfuckin' Ps (bang)
Catch a nigga loafin' stuff him in my SBs
Need to name lil' TwoTwo Disney 'cause he keep a XD
Sorry babe, I'm a dog, bitches want to pet me
I'm off the leash and hard to tame, someone call the vet please
Bitch, I'm wicked, I'a reaper, I'm a muhfuckin' menace
Get up close and use that toolie, I'm a muhfuckin' dentist
I pull up and stretch shit, lil Wick a muhfuckin' genius
See me out with your bitch, mind your muhfuckin' business
I wear Bape, I wear VLone, I wear this shit called Glock
I spend money, I spend time, I spin that shit called blocks
I drank water, I drank juice, bro drink this shit called Wock'
My blood cold, my heart cold, but I'm this shit called hot

Alright, alright, where's all the fun?
I been chillin' for a minute I miss makin' niggas run
Alright, alright, what is there to do?
Ooh, I know pull up where they be, extend my arm and shoot
Alright, okay, go, go, go
Everybody gets gotted, it ain't no eenie miny moe
Alright, okay, row, row your boat
Turn they hood into a ocean and let's see if they can float
