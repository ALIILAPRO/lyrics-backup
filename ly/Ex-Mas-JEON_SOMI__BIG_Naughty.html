		  Christmas presents
Home alone

Opening cards in this late afternoon
Holding on a glass of hot coco in my hand
Three marshmallows floating in my little coco
Make me warm
마음이 마음이 너무 추워

Fire it up, fire it up 나에게 불을 지펴
Fire it up, fire it up 외로운 마음 덮어
Yeah, yeah 내 양말 안에는 양말 안에는 텅텅

Boy, who are you to make me miss you like I do
Cherish and destroy
You are better off on your own
노력해 봐도
Keep crossing my mind 'No'
Make me give you up (ooh)

You gon' spend a lonely Christmas
Hope it sucks
I hate to admit that you are still my number one

You on the naughty list
I'm on the naughty list
You on the naughty list
No more cookies

You on the naughty list
I'm on the naughty list
Who ate the cookies
My broken heart did

Yeah, I'm on the naughty list
But still got your naughty lips, uh
누가 널 이리 화나게 했어
데려와 I'ma kick his ass, huh

You said you broke up with your ex
네가 외롭대서 위로해 주려 급히
Dressed up 했는데 뭘 자꾸 물어 왜겠어

Uh, ayy, take it off that model looking makeup
I won't ask and answer all your questions
아무 말이나 하고 싶을 때 해 내 귀는 임금님 귀

오늘만큼만은 don't hang up
안해 앙큼한 짓 yup man up
Wait, let me take it back
'Cause it's your favorite Christmas Eve

You gon' spend a lonely Christmas
Hope it sucks
I hate to admit that you are still my number one

Baby, it's so cold under the mistletoe
작별이 좀처럼 쉽지가 않아
눈이나 왔으면 해
Santa let him know
That's he's all I'm waiting for (ooh)

You gon' spend a lonely Christmas
Hope it sucks
I hate to admit that you are still my number one

You on the naughty list (yeah)
I'm on the naughty list
You on the naughty list (hmm)
No more cookies

You on the naughty list
I'm on the naughty list
Who ate the cookies
My broken heart did
