		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fish that don't drown
Life in a bubble jungle
I wouldn't frown
Not short another chuckle
Snake in the ground
But I was in there for you
Now leaving town
Life in a bubble jungle

Seeing you believing, us adhering, we're the power struck
Believing, then kneeling, appeasing, the power struggle
We're left with no arms right in the power struggle
We're left with no arms right in the power struggle

Wearing a crown
Life in a bubble jungle
Chasing a clown
Not short another chuckle
Snake in the ground
But I was waiting for you
Now we have found
Life in a bubble jungle

Seeing you believing, us adhering, we're the power struck
Believing, then kneeling, appeasing, the power struggle
We're left with no arms right in the power struggle
We're left with no arms right in the power struggle

Left with no arms in the power struggle
Left with no arms in the power struggle

May I remind you?
May I remind you?
May I remind you?

May I remind you?
May I remind you?
May I remind you?

May I remind you?
May I remind you?
May I remind you?
May I remind you?
May I remind you?
May I remind you?
Your life is in a bubble jungle

Seeing you believing, us adhering, we're the power struck
Believing, then kneeling, appeasing, the power struggle
We're left with no arms right in the power struggle
We're left with no arms right in the power struggle

Left with no arms in the power struggle
Left with no arms right here in the power struggle
