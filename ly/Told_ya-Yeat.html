		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I just caught the vibe
I just copped the Rolls Royce with curtains on each side
I been on the boot up so long, I lost my mind
All my bitches love me, yeah, they lose they mind

I just got my Tonka, I just got the band, bitch
I don't need you but I want you, you remind me of my old bitch
I take X, bitch, I just roll with it, know none of my bitches average
Bitch, I just caught the vibe but I can't slide if ain't no caption
Bitch, I'm just so high, I might slide but I'm crashing it, I'm crazy
Just got a new coupe off the lot, bitch, I'm just brashing it
I been off the opiates so long, I feel like crashing it
And when she pull up on me, she suck dick, she do it so passionate
Just tell me if you rock with it, tell me if you popping it
Tell me if you ever want some cash, you know I'm dropping it
Yeah, I pour a four inside a soda, yeah, some drop in it
Know I gotta change before I die but I can't stop this shit

Every time I try to right my wrongs, shit get bad
I just be so high, I don't be trying, don't got no tabs
Bitch, I rock these turbans like I'm crazy like an Arab
I ain't never gon' give your ass a shot, you know I hate that
I ain't gon' stop this song, bitch, I don't feel like trying
I went and dropped a dime on top of this bitch but I knew she was lying
I went into the Porsche, bitch, I went and bought a Cayenne
Yeah, it's nut inside her pores, bitch, she love to drink it in
Yeah, been so back on Percs, I had to take a break from E
Yeah, it feel like I was dying slowly but surely, yeah, Temple
Not no bitch but all this money fill my mental
Twizzy pulled up on this kid, he shot him up, now he's a lentil
I was talking 'bout the Tonka so I bought it, fuck a rental
I'm the latest and the greatest, that's the craziest part about it
And I told 'em that they never gon' make it, that's the part they doubted
You gotta listen to what I'm saying, I ain't screaming but I'm shouting
Yeah, you say that you a rich boy but I really doubt it
We some motherfucking rich boys, everybody doubt it
We some "go and take and your bitch" boys 'cause we be so clouted
Take a look at my lil' wrist, boy, this lil bitch look like a foreign
Cook it up like it's some bok choy, we still been serving chickens
I been sippin sideways, I ain't have no bad days
Cut off all my old friends, I left they ass in last place
Yeah, I just called twizz, yeah, just called up the Martians
Yeah, I just called Tose' up, yeah, I just called up Barney's

I just got my Tonka, I just got the band, bitch
I don't need you but I want you, you remind me of my old bitch
I take X, bitch, I just roll with it, know none of my bitches average
Bitch, I just caught the vibe but I can't slide if ain't no caption
Bitch, I'm just so high, I might slide but I'm crashing it, I'm crazy
Just got a new coupe off the lot, bitch, I'm just brashing it
I been off the opiates so long, I feel like crashing it
And when she pull up on me, she suck dick, she do it so passionate
Just tell me if you rock with it, tell me if you popping it
Tell me if you ever want some cash, you know I'm dropping it
Yeah, I pour a four inside a soda, yeah, some drop in it
Know I gotta change before I die but I can't stop this shit
