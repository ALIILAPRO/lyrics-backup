		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’m the first to admit I like living alone
That’s when I feel in control
No one else to impress when you’re always on your own
But now you’re changing it all

When We met on the beach just between you and me
Knew I was falling in love
Got me out of my shell can’t believe that you’re real
Do anything just for you

Never believed in “the one”
But baby if I did

I’d probably go out Friday night
Just maybe Drink more than one glass of wine
Spend too much money I would be anybody for you

I’d probably dye my hair blonde, I’d
Be someone your friends talk about all the time
Life of the party, I could be anybody for you
Id be anybody for you

You don’t need me to be anything that I’m not you’ll never ask me to change
Never thought I’d get out of my own way
Stayin’ at your place
guess I’m tryna say I 

I'd get out of my self
To give the world to you

I’d probably go out Friday night
Just maybe Drink more than one glass of wine
Spend too much money I would be anybody for you

I’d probably dye my hair blonde, I’d
Be someone your friends talk about all the time
Life of the party, I could be anybody for you
I'd be anybody for you
