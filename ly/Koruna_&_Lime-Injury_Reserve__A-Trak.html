		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ahh!
Hey, give me that one over there, yeah
Bloo, bloo, bloo, bloo, bloo, bloo (hey)
Alright, who's first? You, c'mon (hey)

Yeah, humble as a mumble in the jungle, ya dig?
Can't never knock the hustle, get that shit how you live
If you didn't help me get it, don't be speakin' on mine
No, for real, don't say shit, like you speakin' in mime
I'm just speakin' my mind, take it a day at a time
Yeah, I'm from the 510, nigga, nickle and dime
Yeah, I know a few dudes gettin' paid off of crime
But cops came from behind, now they doin' time
Never thought I'd be gettin' paid off of these rhymes
Ain't it funny sometimes how things align?
Love the fans that say we don't get enough shine
I mean, shit, well, they isn't lyin'
Seen a couple shitty deals that we had to decline
Primo shit, better get the three in the prime
From Flagstaff to Czech, gettin' checks, Corona and lime
Told 'em fax that shit to Prague if you want us to sign, nigga

They say they want that spazz rap, yeah
But now we got these niggas' trunks
Soundin' like it's Baghdad
They say they want that real talk
But why these preachy-ass niggas out here
Soundin' like a Ted Talk
Yeah, rollin' with my best guys, whip it like a test drive
Hold up, baby girl, don't take the picture, get my left side
When I get that whip, I'll make that shit look like a Best Buy
Ayy, maybe I'll see you in my next life
Maybe I'll see you in my next life
Maybe I'll see you in my next life
Maybe I'll see you in my next life
Maybe I'll see you in my next life

(Life, life, see you in my ne-e-e-e-e-e-e-ext life
Life, li-li-life-life
See you in my, see you
A-ayy, see you in my next life)
Give me that one over there, yeah
