		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say that I’m a nightmare
Guess I’ll catch you in your dreams
I come out of nowhere
I will haunt you in your sleep
Yeah you should’ve known
I’d never do what I’m told
I’m running in the fast lane
Yeah I’m going rogue
Here comes trouble
Here comes trouble
I’m out of my cage
You should be afraid
Here comes trouble
Catch me in the shadows
Creeping around in your head
I got that bravado
Watch me scare you dead
Yeah you should’ve known
I’d never do what I’m told
I’m running in the fast lane
Yeah I’m going rogue
Here comes trouble
Here comes trouble
I’m out of my cage
You should be afraid
Here comes trouble
Trouble
Trouble
Yeah yeah I do it like that
I’m always on the attack
Lights out
Fade to black
Yeah yeah I do it like that
I’m always on the attack
Lights out
Fade to black
Here comes trouble
Here comes trouble
Here comes trouble
I’m out of my cage
You should be afraid
Here comes trouble
Here comes here comes
Trouble
Here comes here comes
Trouble
Here comes here comes
Trouble
Here comes here comes
Trouble
