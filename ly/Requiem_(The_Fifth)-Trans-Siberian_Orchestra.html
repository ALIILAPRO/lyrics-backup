		  VOCA ME BENEDICTUM !
SANA MEAM ANIMAM !
VOCA ME BENEDICTUM !
SANA MEAM ANIMAM !

[Beethoven believes that if Theresa were to have discovered 
That he was becoming deaf she would most certainly have left him. 
Before this could happen, he ended their relationship refusing to ever see her again.]

[Fate takes him outside of his town house where Theresa is watching him through the window. 
She can see him slumped over the piano. 
She does not understand why he has driven her out of his life. 
She knows that something is terribly wrong but has no idea what it is. 
Nothing that he could tell her would affect her love for him, but Beethoven cannot believe this.]
