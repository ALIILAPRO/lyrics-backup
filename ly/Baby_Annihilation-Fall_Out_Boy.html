		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  An alligator prince with crocodile tears, too many to count
Permanent head cold dreams, awash in your love falling in and out
Time is luck and I wish ours overlapped more or for longer
Orange leaves bore the ones falling off trees
The first time I took the mask off, just had another one on underneath
I'm just melted wax on a birthday cake
Another year fades away
Charcoal crushed, pixie fever, angel dust
Stuck in a wasteland we covered in glitter and broadcast
Just for a little serotonin
Self-sabotage at best, under your spell
But you know what they say, if you want a job done right, you gotta do it yourself
This palace was crystal, but the world was a cruel joke
What is there between us, if not a little annihilation?
