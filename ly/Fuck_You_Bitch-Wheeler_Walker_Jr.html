		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say we're done
You packed up your stuff
It's really over
Said you've had enough
There's one thing
I'd like to say
'Fore you leave, baby

Fuck you bitch
You broke my heart
Fuck your friends
For tearing us apart
Fuck your dog
Hope he never comes home
Fuck you bitch
Hope you wind up alone

Now you're gone
And I'm by myself
Jerkin' off
To pictures on the cell
But before
I swipe on your face
I just scream

Fuck you bitch
You broke my heart
Fuck your friends
For tearing us apart
Fuck your dog
Hope he never comes home
Fuck you bitch
Hope you wind up alone

Word is out
You found someone new
Well I hope
He does it for you
But if not
And you call me up
Darlin', please, please

Fuck you bitch
You broke my heart
Fuck your friends
For tearing us apart
Fuck your dog
Hope he never comes home
Fuck you bitch
Hope you wind up alone
Fuck you bitch
Hope you wind up alone
