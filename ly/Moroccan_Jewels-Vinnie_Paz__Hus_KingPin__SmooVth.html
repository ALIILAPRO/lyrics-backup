		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm Lord Jedi Waves at sixteen
Yo, Vinnie, blicky, I'm followed by tranquility
My gun cha cha slide like dance floors into sixteens
Shoot your Phantom doors off the hinges, I'm spiffy
Watch the wave rip, four pound [?] tips
My bitch wears strawberry mystics
Got double cups for you thirsty niggas, the winners
Onslaught, we the Autobots, fuck with us
I been fucking these rap niggas' bitches
Invictus, Ernest Henley
Thank whatever gods may be [?]
[?] head, step you gator meat on my feet
I embody all the fly shit you wanna be
Ask about me, [?] skyhouse me
I fucked all the dope boy bitches on my balcony
Turn your bitch to a wave slave, Lord Wavey

Arm, leg, leg, arm, a bobsled
Cool runners, these old hoes, they give the bomb head
Barkin' up the wrong tree, parkin' on the wrong street
Get your shit, split your wig, lift him up five feet
Blow the weed, control the V, cops behind us
Must I remind him? The whip be like four hundred horses
The meal be like eight courses, black on black forces
Fuck the leaky faucet, torch it
Water torture, I'm charged with slaughter with it
And don't fear, I must be acquitted, invoke the spirits
Pen this shit in hieroglyphics, vague specifics
Over there on the Pacific, let's get it
I hit the brakes, the ground was covered in ice
Body smother, demise, head covered in lice
Yikes, this shit's disgusting, I know
Daily News, Newsday, Huffington Post

When the bulldog bark, pa, everybody cower
Discretion is the better part of valor
Drunk from the power, drunk from the Amaretto Sour
Son got splashed like a shower
Listen, I'm telling you I'm the shit
The Larry Hughes three time felon of this shit
I bust this motherfucker in the melon with the grip
The [?] of the Nuwaubian is a gift
I splash son, I ain't even know his government
The two Glocks twins like Doublemint
Y'all on some other shit, all of it's trash, I like none of it
Iraq through y'all masters for the fuck of it
Y'all on some sucker shit, talking to the feds
He singing like Mariah with that warrant on his head
This dirt bag swine live in squalor
It made all the gunmen holler
