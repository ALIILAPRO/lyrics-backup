		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We've been so caught up in the subject of personnel
Playing and acting, and slaving and bathing ourselves

Who lies and who tries to come over everyone
Painting a picture to show everyone in the world

Fearing is natural
New names and faces can bring
Build ups and barriers hiding behind everything

Who lies and who tries to come over everyone
Painting a picture to show everyone in the world.
