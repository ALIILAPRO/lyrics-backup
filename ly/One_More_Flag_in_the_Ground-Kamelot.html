		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One more flag in the ground

I am an island
Waiting for hell to unleash on my shore
Sharp is my weapon
I am preparing for war

I shall walk on this bridge over trenches below
With fear as my faithful companion
Life (death)
Protecting my last dominion

One more flag in the ground
I am a soldier, I'm marching into battle
I am a warrior and this is my creed
One more flag in the ground

I bleed for my vision
Pain is the weakness I'm leaving behind
This is my mission
I am an army of one

And I'm facing the fire that's raging inside
With faith as my fearless companion
Life (death)
Protecting my last dominion

One more flag in the ground
I am a soldier, I'm marching into battle
I am a warrior and this is my creed
One more flag in the ground

I am a soldier
I know my conviction will carry me home
Your hand on my shoulder
'Cause I am not walking alone

I (I), I am a soldier and
I (I), I don't walk alone
I (I), I am a warrior
And I'm coming home

One more flag in the ground
I am a soldier, I'm marching into battle
One more victory won
I am a warrior and this is my creed

One more flag in the ground
I am a soldier, I'm marching into battle
One more victory won
I am a warrior and this is my creed
One more flag in the ground
