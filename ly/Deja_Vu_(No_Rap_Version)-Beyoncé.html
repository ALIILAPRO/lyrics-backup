		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bass
Uh
Hi hat
Uh
808
Uh
Jay (uh huh)
Ready? (Uh huh)
Let's go get 'em
Uh huh, come on

I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass, hi hat, and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birken bags
Now I bag B (Boy, you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me whipping curtains back
Me and B, she about to sting
Stand back

Baby, seems like everywhere I go
I see you, from your eyes, your smile
It's like I breathe you, helplessly I reminisce
Don't want to compare nobody to you

Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go, oh

You know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu

I'm seeing things that I know can't be
Am I dreaming? When I saw you walking past me
Almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
Feels like I'm losing it

Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go, oh

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you (ohh)
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu

Yes, Hova's flow so unusual
Baby girl, you should already know
It's H-O, light up the dro'
'Cause you gon' need help tryin' to study my bounce
Flow, blow, what's the difference?
One you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dough, po-po try to convict him
That's a no-go, my dough keep the scales tipping
Like four-fours, like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow, wind so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever? That's the argument
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits like a factory
I'm just one-to-one, nothin' after me
No déjà vu, just me and my, oh

Baby, I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having déjà vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missing you
That I'm having déjà vu?

Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go (woo)

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu
