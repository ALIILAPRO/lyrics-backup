		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you hear me now?
When I'm far underwater
Is it too soon now?
When I call out your name?
'cause you're always on my mind
What I've wanted all this time
Could this be real?
Thought that I would never feel this way again
But when the heavens open
And I'm drowning under that water
There's a light above me
And she's there with her hands
So I try to understand
What the hell is it I want?
If you're just a dream
And a million memories
Then why do I weep at night?
Oh I've never felt quite right
I gave you all that I had
But It wasn't enough
As I grew older I'd hoped you'd turn to dust
Nowâ€†I drive across the country with a ghost I've came to know
Yeah, she's sitting right beside me
I just smile and say hello
Can you hear me now?
When I'm far underwater
Is it too soon now
When I call out your name?
'cause you're always on my mind
What I've wanted all this time
