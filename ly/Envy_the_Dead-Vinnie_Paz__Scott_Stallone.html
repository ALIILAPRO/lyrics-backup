		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go calmly go calmly

I never had anybody that's why I needed you
I will give my fucking life
I would bleed for you
I never thought that my intellect
Could compete with you
I moved to the commune and conceded to you
You lead people in with meditative rituals
And Western Hermetic tradition
And it's principles are you the persecuted
Prophet that's invincible?
Can you turn unpure polluted water drinkable?
I believe you when you said
You that you were godsent
That you would take care of
My family and mom's rent
The living conditions was crazy
In the Lord's tent
But I believed in the doctrine
And all it's content
I had total separation from earthly desires
That was just part of
The energy perfectly pious
It wasn't anybody studying thirsty as I was
You mixed Jewish mysticism and
Verses of Cyrus
Ahmadiyya Islam and Judah Halevi
You had us eating out of your
Palm and was doing it easy
I would kill for you as long
As you wouldn't leave me
I gave you everything I had just
So that you could deceive me
It's never the right time
It's never the right time
It's never the right time go Calmly
Go Calmly

When I questioned anything I
Was told to believe
This is thought reform I was
Too frozen to leave
I daydream about the son and ocean and seas
But if I left how would I
Deal with my social disease
I started noticing you didn't
Live what you said
You were the only one with a crib and a bed
I don't think you ever even cared if we bled
You ate like a king
But you gave bit's of bread
There was something about the time
You spent with the kids
That didn't sit well with me
Wouldn't stick to ribs
I prayed that you weren't doing
The things that you did
Cause I would rip your fucking heart
Out and split your wig
Nah chill, I know you would never do that
You a father figure I'm stupid
I should've knew that
Can you ever forgive me? I'm just a new jack
But something in the back of my
Head said to pursue that
I started recognizing that you
Was a trust bandit
Psychologically abusive and a rough granite
You recruited your followers from
A rough planet made us into idol? that's
From a rough canvas
Disrespected your subordinants
And I started seeing through
All your horse shit
You don't deserve my worship
That's strictly gods gift
Run up on you hit the off switch (BUHH)
It's never the right time
It's never the right time
It's never the right time go Calmly
Go Calmly go Calmly
