		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel you runnin' through my veins, veins
Runnin' through my
I feel you runnin' through my veins, veins
Runnin' through my
I feel you runnin' through my veins, veins
Runnin' through my
I feel you runnin' through my veins, veins
Runnin' through my
I feel you runnin' through my veins, veins
Runnin' through my

I feel you, feel you, feel you, oh

Give me a dose and the green light
You're keeping me up all night, night
Give me a dose and the green light
And I'll be yours in the moonlight, yeah
Give me a dose and the green light
You're keeping me up all night, night
Give me a dose and the green light
And I'll be yours in the moonlight, yeah

You've got to give me something (something)
In my veins you keep on coming (in my veins)
You've got to give me something (mm, in my veins)
In my veins you keep on coming

I feel you runnin' through my veins, veins
Runnin' through my
I feel you runnin' through my veins, veins
Runnin' through my
I feel you runnin' through my veins, veins
Runnin' through my
I feel you, feel you, feel you, oh

Give me a dose and the green light
You're keeping me up all night, night
Give me a dose and the green light
And I'll be yours in the moonlight, yeah
Give me a dose and the green light
You're keeping me up all night, night
Give me a dose and the green light
And I'll be yours in the moonlight, yeah
