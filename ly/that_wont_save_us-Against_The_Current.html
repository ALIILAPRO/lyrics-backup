		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What did I hear you say?
Say it to my face
It's not even worth the fight
Waiting for you to say
What's got you so afraid?
I'm not gonna waste my time (waste my time)

Yeah, the bigger they are, the harder they fall
Yeah, I got so sick of feeling so small
I leave you alone to build up your walls
What did I hear you say?

How did we become so numb?
We just let it come undone
And I just started giving up
But that won't save us
Maybe we were born to fight
If we wanna make it out alive
We gotta let the anger die
'Cause that won't save us

And now we're so far away
But we talk every day
Something there, it just ain't right
I'm sinking under the weight
It's like I could break
I never let you hear my cries (hear my cries)

Well, the duller the knife, the deeper the scars
I don't need a light to see in the dark
I know what you're like, I know who you are
What were you gonna say?

How did we become so numb?
We just let it come undone
And I just started giving up
But that won't save us
Maybe we were born to fight
If we wanna make it out alive
We gotta let the anger die
'Cause that won't save us

Are you proud of what we've come to be?
We're sorry, but that won't save us
We fucked up and I'd give anything
If only that could save us

How did we become so numb?
We just let it come undone
And I just started giving up
But that won't save us
Maybe we were born to fight
If we wanna make it out alive
We gotta let the anger die
'Cause that won't save us

What did I hear you say?
