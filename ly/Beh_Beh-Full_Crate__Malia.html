		<p>
		  I will be okay, baby, baby
You will be alright 
We should go our separate ways 
Won't tell you how to live your life

I will be okay, baby, baby
You will be alright 
We should go our separate ways 
Won't tell you how to live your life

When you open the door
And you walk down the stairs
No, there's no turning back
There's no heart left to spare
When you open the door
Then you burn down the bridge
No, there's no turning back
Even though it's gonna hurt so bad

One, two
And then she said

I will be okay, baby, baby
You will be alright (I'll be alright)
We should go our separate ways 
Won't tell you how to live your life (sing it)

I will be okay, baby, baby (yeah)
You will be alright (ooh)
We should go our separate ways 
Won't tell you how to live your life

Man, so what happens next?

Now I stare through the window
And I'm ready to face my fears
No, there's no turning back
Sometimes life it ain't fair (it ain't fair)
I won't ask you for more
'Cause you burn down the bridge
No, there's no turning back
Even though it's gonna hurt so bad (damn)

One, two
And then she said

I will be okay, baby, baby (I will)
You will be alright 
We should go our separate ways 
Won't tell you how to live your life

I will be okay, baby, baby
You will be alright 
We should go our separate ways 
Won't tell you how to live your life

Break it down

I will be okay, baby, baby
You will be alright (sing it)
We should go our separate (yeah) ways
Won't tell you how to live your life (uh)

I will be okay, baby, baby
You will be alright 
We should go our separate ways 
Won't tell you how to live your life

I still love you, girl
