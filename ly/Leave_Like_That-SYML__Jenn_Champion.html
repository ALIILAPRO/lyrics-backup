		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You never got the chance to know me
Packed it up and crossed the state
You left behind more than memories
Now when I sleep, I'm only dreaming of your face

You never got the chance to hold me
I learned to love your selfish way
I still believe in you, and in this burning room
I'll suffer through the pain

Oh no, got me low, how you gonna leave like that?
Oh no, got me low, gone and I want you back
Oh no, down so low, feeling like I'm under attack
Oh no, where did you go? You're gone and I want you

We never talked about forever
I never wanted you to change
Call me up and I'll be running
Lose my breath, calling out your name
Lose my breath

Oh no, got me low, how you gonna leave like that?
Oh no, got me low, gone and I want you back
Oh no, down so low, feeling like I'm under attack
Oh no, where did you go, you're gone and I want you

You're gone and I want you back
You're gone and I want you back and I want you
Gone and I want you, how you gonna leave like that?
Feeling like I'm under attack, gone and I want you back
How you gonna leave like that, gone, gone, and I want you
