		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know it's better if we both say
"So long and thanks for the memories"
I'd like to say that it's been real
But it's been fake as hell

I caught you lying in my face again
You got me hanging by a thread again
Feel like a kite in a hurricane
So cut the string and let me fly away

Now we're burnin' at both ends
Like candles in the wind
My eyelids collapsin'
Collateral damage

I know it's better if we both say
"So long and thanks for the memories"
I'd like to say that it's been real
But it's been fake as hell
Take two and call me in the morning
Three chances, shoulda seen the warning
For what it's worth, I wish you well
Yeah, it's been real, you're fake as hell

You're superficial, you know how to fake it
So artificial, don't know how to take it
You got a problem, I don't wanna solve it
Now it's official, I don't even miss ya

You say it's really nothing personal
And everyone you love is just expendable
Can't make a friend without the end, you know
It's collateral damage

I know it's better if we both say
"So long and thanks for the memories"
I'd like to say that it's been real
But it's been fake as hell
Take two and call me in the morning
Three chances, shoulda seen the warning
For what it's worth, I wish you well
Yeah, it's been real, you're fake as hell

You say it's really nothing personal
Everyone you love is just expendable
You say it's really nothing personal
Personal, personal
You say it's really nothing personal (I know it's better if we both say)
Everyone you love is just expendable ("so long and thanks for the memories")
Can't make a friend without the end, you know (I'd like to say that it's been real)
End, you know (but it's been fake as hell)

I know it's better if we both say
"So long and thanks for the memories" (thanks for the memories)
I'd like to say that it's been real
But it's been fake as hell
Take two and call me in the morning
Three chances, shoulda seen the warning
For what it's worth, I wish you well
Yeah, it's been real, you're fake as hell

Fake as hell
You're so fake as hell (for what it's worth, I wish you well)
Yeah, it's been real, you're fake as hell
