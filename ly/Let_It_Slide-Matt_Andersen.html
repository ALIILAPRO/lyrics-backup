		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm sick of solving
Other people's problems
You want answers
I don't got 'em

I hear you shouting
From your rooftop
Throwing stones
From your soap box

Let it go, let it ride
Let it slide

You pick and choose
Your point of view
You're offended
By the way I make my bed and

You must be bored
Not much to do
You sit at home
And bitch about the news

Let it go, let it ride
Let it slide

You must be mistaking me
Like I'm the one who wants to be
I hear you going on about yourself
When you don't care about anybody else

Every morning
The sky is falling
You want your mama
But she ain't calling

I hear you breathing
Shut your mouth
The facts you're missing
What chu even talking 'bout

Let it go, let it ride
Let it slide

I'm sick of solving
Other people's problems
You want answers
I don't got 'em

I hear you shouting
From your rooftop
Throwing stones
From your soap box

Let it go, let it ride
Let it slide
Oh, let it go, let it ride
Let it slide
Let it go, let it ride
Let it slide
