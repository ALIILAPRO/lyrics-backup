		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sniper Gang, Kodak
'Cause I got it by myself
Skrrt, skrrt, aye, skrrt, skrrt (skrrt, skrrt)
Free lil Cool man, free lil Tap Boy, yee

Why you, why you keep that tool like dat?
Why you move like dat? I hit the club 50 deep (aye, aye)
How you get so high like dat?
Why your eyes like dat?
'Cause I put molly in my lean (aye, Kodak, Kodak)
Kodak, why you act like dat?
Why you strapped like dat?
'Cause I got it by myself (aye, aye)
Nigga, I don't need no vitamin C
I be smokin' broccoli, they say it's good for my health (aye, aye)

I'm from the No, my lil bitch from the Dale
I like my money fast, you movin' like a snail
All I smoke is L's, on that paper trail
Can't you tell? I got clientele on my Nextel
I don't need your help, got it on my own
This a million-dollar phone, but I ain't got no ringtone (aye, aye, aye)
Kodak, why you keep that thing on you? (aye, aye)
'Cause I ain't got no time to play with you
All I do is win, I hate to lose
Got your boo dancin', 'cause that's what them bands make her do (make her dance)
I'm smokin' broccoli, counting green
I'm on molly, I'm on lean (I put molly in my lean, nigga)

Why you, why you keep that tool like dat?
Why you move like dat? I hit the club 50 deep (with my niggas, aye)
How you get so high like dat?
Why your eyes like dat?
'Cause I put molly in my lean (in my lean, aye)
Kodak, why you act like dat?
Why you strapped like dat?
'Cause I got it by myself (by myself)
Nigga, I don't need no vitamin C
I be smokin' broccoli, they say it's good for my health (aye, aye, Kodak)

Kodak, why you always in a foreign? (In a foreign car)
'Cause if it ain't foreign, then it's borin' (that's a boring car)
I'm chasin' dreams, while you snorin'
Kodak Black, my bitch yellow, but her favorite color orange (color orange, boy)
Please don't call my phone no more, I'm on tour (bitch, I'm on tour)
Only two can fit, fuck a four-door (fuck a four-door)
Nigga, this a Jag, this is not a Ford (not a Ford)
Polo to the floor, fuck that Tom Ford (Poppin' molly)
Nigga, this a Rollie, fuck that Michael Kors (fuck that shit)
I'm in here movin' slowly, 'cause I poured a four (I'm on that shit)
Got her on her knees, like "forgive me, Lord" (fuck that bitch)
I remember pullin' schemes, way in Baltimore (remember I was hittin' licks)

Why you, why you keep that tool like dat?
Why you move like dat? I hit the club 50 deep (with my niggas, aye)
How you get so high like dat?
Why your eyes like dat?
'Cause I put molly in my lean (in my lean, aye)
Kodak, why you act like dat?
Why you strapped like dat?
'Cause I got it by myself (by myself)
Nigga, I don't need no vitamin C
I be smokin' broccoli, they say it's good for my health (I'm the healthy kid)
