		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, yeah

My body's burning fire
Eyes are eating me alive, no, no
Can't wait to be alone
'Cause I've feenin', need some time on my own

(Oh oh oh oh, yeah)
People in the way and it just gets harder
(Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
To say I'm fine and tell myself that I agree
(Oh oh oh oh, yeah)
Now I'm gettin' close, won't take me much longer
(Ooh ooh)
I'm going home, going home, yeah

Tonight, tonight, I'm solo dancin' in my room
Tonight, tonight, got time for me, no time for you
Neon lights on the ceiling
Lonely vibes for the healing
Tonight I'm tryna stay in by my own again
Tonight, tonight, I'm solo dancin' in my room
Tonight, tonight, got time for me, it's overdue
Neon lights on the ceiling
Lonely vibes for the healing
Tonight I'm tryna stay in on my own again

I'm leaving for the night
Can't see shapes, so all my troubles out of sight
The morning stare in your eyes
And all the problems of the day turned into mine
Ha, yeah

People in the way and it just gets harder
(Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
To say I'm fine and tell myself that I agree
(Oh oh oh oh, yeah)
Now I'm gettin' close, won't take me much longer
(Ooh-ooh)
I'm going home, going home, yeah

Tonight, tonight, I'm solo dancin' in my room
Tonight, tonight, got time for me, no time for you
Neon lights on the ceiling
Lonely vibes for the healing
Tonight I'm tryna stay in by my own again
Tonight, tonight, I'm solo dancin' in my room
Tonight, tonight, got time for me, it's overdue
Neon lights on the ceiling
Lonely vibes for the healing (hey bro, should I rap here?)
Tonight I'm tryna stay in on my own again (should I rap here? Yes)

Oh, hmm
No yeah, I was, just thinkin' the same thing
I just wrote this whole verse for it, I'm just gonna go (yeah, just sing)
But I'm just going sing it, yeah I'll just sing

Tonight, tonight, I'm solo dancin' in my room
Tonight, tonight, got time for me, no time for you
Neon lights on the ceiling
Lonely vibes for the healing
Tonight I'm tryna stay in on my own again

Oh I keep goin' here? (yes)
Oh, oh

Tonight, tonight, I'm solo dancin' in my room
Tonight, tonight, got time for me, no time for you
Neon lights on the ceiling
Lonely vibes for the healing
Tonight I'm tryna stay in by my own again
Tonight, tonight, I'm solo dancin' in my room
Tonight, tonight, got time for me, it's overdue
Neon lights on the ceiling
Lonely vibes for the healing
Tonight I'm tryna stay in on my own again
