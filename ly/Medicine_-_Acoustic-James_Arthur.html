		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're my bulletproof vest when it's getting dangerous
Always make me feel blessed, you're my guardian angel
You are, you are, you are
Yeah, you are, you are, you are

You put your body on mine when they're taking aim
You're the pin in my heart, it's a hand grenade
You are, you are, you are
The cure for all my scars

I feel like you
Could save me now
When I'm suicidal
Don't let me spiral

You make my heart beat faster than adrenaline
You kiss away the pain of all the hell I'm in
You're gonna make me better than I've ever been
'Cause you're my medicine, you're my medicine

You make my heart beat faster than adrenaline
You take the pain whenever I'm in hell again
I know you'll make me better than I've ever been
'Cause you're my medicine, yeah, you're my medicine

You always say we should move to LA, yeah
I'll buy you a plane and I'll fly you away
You are my heroine, you're my escape
Everything gonna be Gucci today

I feel like you
Could save me now
I know I hurt you
I don't deserve you, no no

You make my heart beat faster than adrenaline
You kiss away the pain of all the hell I'm in
You're gonna make me better than I've ever been
'Cause you're my medicine, you're my medicine

You make my heart beat faster than adrenaline
You take the pain whenever I'm in hell again
I know you'll make me better than I've ever been
'Cause you're my medicine, yeah, you're my medicine

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause you're my medicine
Yeah, yeah, whoa oh

I love the way you look in that Balenciaga
One sip of you, I'm hooked, I wanna hit it harder
No drug could feel this good, now I'm addicted to you, ooh
(Yeah)

You make my heart beat faster than adrenaline
You kiss away the pain of all the hell I'm in
You're gonna make me better than I've ever been
'Cause you're my medicine, you're my medicine

You make my heart beat faster than adrenaline
You take the pain whenever I'm in hell again
I know you make me better than I've ever been
'Cause you're my medicine, yeah, you're my medicine

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause you're my medicine
Yeah, yeah, whoa oh
