		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Kane is in the building nigga

The daddy dollas, dollas
Get nasty, come on
Stig, stig, stig, stig, stig
Stig, stig, stig, stig, stig

Who told you to put the lights on?
I'm ready for ya, I'm ready for ya
Who told you to put the lights on?
I'm ready for ya, I'm ready for ya

Who told you to put the lights on?
I'm ready for ya, I'm ready for ya
Who told you to put the lights on?
I'm ready for ya, I'm ready for ya

Listen baby, I don't mean to stare
But I been hypnotized by your derriere
Ya sympathize if ya man's a square
Baby, I'm a player that really don't care

And on a scale from one to ten
You like eleven, twelve 'cause ya fine as hell
Ya bow legged, paratoned with it
Eatable titties and ya ass so pretty

No, no scars, no cuts do sit ups
And fuck enough so you don't need a tummy tuck
And you don't need silicon
Put a good bra on and show off ya own cunt whole

Who told you to put the lights on?
I'm ready for ya, I'm ready for ya
Who told you to put the lights on?
I'm ready for ya, I'm ready for ya

Who told you to put the lights on?
I'm ready for ya, I'm ready for ya
Who told you to put the lights on?
I'm ready for ya, I'm ready for ya

And I love what she do
When she do, what she do
What she did, what she did to me
Cause when her boy come through
She go shakin' that ass
Like she really wanna give it to me

And that ass so nice and 'round
The whole club'll shut down if it touch the ground
And she know it 'cause she throw them cheeks
From the right to the left and right back to me

She a stone cold nympho
She a ghetto in all forms and make it look simple
And I know where ya get it from
You a country lil' girl that was raised in the city heart

Who told you to put the lights on?
I'm ready for ya, I'm ready for ya
Who told you to put the lights on?
I'm ready for ya, I'm ready for ya

Who told you to put the lights on?
I'm ready for ya, I'm ready for ya
Who told you to put the lights on?
I'm ready for ya, I'm ready for ya

With the flick of my tongue
I can make that pussy cum
Come on, put it right on the tip of my tongue
Right there on the tip of my tongue

Who told you to put the lights on?
I'm ready for ya, I'm ready for ya
Who told you to put the lights on?
I'm ready for ya, I'm ready for ya

At the flick of my tongue
I can make that pussy cum
Come on, put it right on the tip of my tongue
Right there on the tip of my tongue

Who told you to put the lights on?
I'm ready for ya, I'm ready for ya
Who told you to put the lights on?
I'm ready for ya, I'm ready for ya

She move like she a freshman
Old quiet girl that her mama done kept in
She make straight A's, her daddy's rich
She good in school but she love that dick

Voted most likely to succeed on Vala Victorian
And been explorin' for him
She don't need no sorority
She thinks sorority's borin' and rather have a orgy

And she in love with her body
So when she by herself, she like to touch herself
And she the type that'll eat a dick up off top
And won't stop till she sop up every drop

Who told you to put the lights on?
I'm ready for ya, I'm ready for ya
Who told you to put the lights on?
I'm ready for ya, I'm ready for ya

Who told you to put the lights on?
I'm ready for ya, I'm ready for ya
Who told you to put the lights on?
I'm ready for ya, I'm ready for ya
