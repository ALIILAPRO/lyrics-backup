		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been searching a long time
Someone exactly like you
I've been traveling all around the world
Waiting for you to come through

Someone like you makes it all worth while
Someone like you keeps me satisfied
Someone exactly like you

I've been travelin' a hard road
Baby, lookin' for someone exactly like you
I've been carryin' my heavy load
Waiting for the light to come shining through

Someone like you makes it all worth while
Someone like you keeps me satisfied 
Someone exactly like you

I've been doin' some soul searching
To find out where you're at
I've been up and down the highway
In all kinds of foreign lands

Someone like you makes it all worth while
Someone like you keeps me satisfied
Someone exactly like you

I've been all around the world
Marching to the beat of a different drum
But just lately I have realized
Maybe the best is yet to come

Someone like you makes it all worth while
Someone like you keeps me satisfied
Someone exactly like you
Someone exactly like you
Someone exactly like you
