		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do I know better than this?
You're a word that I can't forget
Though the thought rattles my brain
Will you fold, or will you remain?

If I don't get better than this
Man in my skin
If I don't get better than this
Man in my skin

If I let go, would you hold on? Would we fly?
Is it safer if we just say that we tried?
Are we laughing at the danger? Are we dancing after death?
You and I?

As the sun waits to eclipse
And the taste teases my lips
I'm too tired to wrestle with it
Will we burn, or will we repent?

If I don't get better than this
Man in my skin
If I don't get better than this
Man in my skin

If I let go, would you hold on? Would we fly?
Is it safer if we just say that we tried?
Are we laughing at the danger? Are we dancing after death?
You and I?

If I let go, would you hold on? Would we fly?
Is it safer if we just say that we tried?
Are we laughing at the danger? Are we dancing after death?
Are we laughing at the danger? Are we dancing after death?
You and I?
