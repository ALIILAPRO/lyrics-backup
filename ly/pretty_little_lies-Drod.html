		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been going on for so long
Getting too attached was so wrong
A pretty little lie saying I'll be
Okay okay okay
Okay!
Now it's the same day
But a different scene
I need to change lanes
To a different street
Pushing the same page
Wishing it would give me a reason
To believe that we gonna get even
I know that we've been distance
I pulled it together and made a living
From all the little things in the dust
And still it wasn't enough
So try and tell me now our histories broken
It's just the start and you already know it
Tryna watch the seasons change with you
Spring in summer days fall in winters chains
It's supposed to be bottomless pit to the truth
So when we gonna get this thing out on the pavement
And I'm feeling
Cool breeze
Summer wind
Life goals
In my bag
I'm loving that
You ice cold
I put together missing pieces so I wish you well
Pretty little lies are a sign
So I
I've been going on for so long
Getting too attached was so wrong
A pretty little lie saying I'll be
Okay okay okay
Okay!
Now it's the same day
But a different scene
I need to change lanes
To a different street
Pushing the same page
Wishing it would give me a reason
To believe that we gonna get even
I know that we've been distance
I pulled it together and made a living
From all the little things in the dust
And still it wasn't enough
So try and tell me now our histories broken
It's just the start and you already know it
