		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shawty crunk on the floor wide open
Skeet so much they call her Billy Ocean
Roll, like an 18-wheeler
That ho fine, but this ho a killer
She's leaking! She's soaking wet
She leaking! Soaking wet
Shake it like a salt shaker (shake it like a salt shaker)
Shake it like a salt shaker (shake it like a salt shaker)

Popping 'til you percolate
First booty-on-booty, no time to wait
Make it work, with your wet t-shirt
Bitch you gotta shake it 'til your calve muscles hurt
Sadie heels on your feet, the strap around your ankles
Jegga jegga jegga
Call that bitch Bojangles
Juicy like fruit or douche like coup Deville
Lucy get loose on the Goose for real
Five dollars get your ass a table dance
If you got 10 then bring a friend
Ho shake your ass 'til the song end
If you ain't wit it, well go on, then!
We ain't no boys, we grown men
If you ain't gonna dance, well don't then!
Why you wanna waste a nigga's song, then?
Seen your ass down doing nothing?

Shawty crunk on the floor wide open
Skeet so much they call her Billy Ocean
Roll, like an 18-wheeler
That ho fine, but this ho a killer
She's leaking! She's soaking wet
She leaking! Soaking wet
Shake it like a salt shaker (shake it like a salt shaker)
Shake it like a salt shaker (shake it like a salt shaker)

Face the wall shawty, put your hands on it
Bounce that ass up & down, make a nigga want it
Face the wall shawty, put your hands on it
Bounce that ass up & down, make a nigga want it
Roll that ass round & round like a motherfucking wheel
Shake that shit, this ain't no motherfucking drill!
Roll that ass round & round like a motherfucking wheel
Shake that shit this ain't no motherfucking drill!
Get crunk with, get loose with it
Like Short said, let Bruce Bruce hit it!
Get crunk with it, get loose with it
Like Short said, let Bruce Bruce hit it
Shake that ass real fast then stop
Shake that ass real fast then stop
Shake that ass real fast then drop
Shake that ass real fast then drop

Shawty crunk on the floor wide open
Skeet so much they call her Billy Ocean
Roll, like an 18-wheeler
That ho fine, but this ho a killer
She's leaking! She's soaking wet
She leaking! Soaking wet
Shake it like a salt shaker (shake it like a salt shaker)
Shake it like a salt shaker (shake it like a salt shaker)

Shake it like a dollar, 5, or 10
But what would you do for a twenty twen?
Get on the stage shake that ass, then
Get on the pole do a back-bend
I like that! Do it again!
Here's another 10 bitch, do it again
Work it like a game that you playing to win
Make that pussy fart for the Ying Yang Twins

16 bitches in thongs in 1 club
The home of the thick redbones and big butts
Game spittin' bitches splitting all on the floor
Hornified, can't deny a certified pro
On the pole upside down (This shit for real!)
69, plenty of times to pay a bill
By day she's a clerk, by night she turn stripper
You're not even dating
You just trying so you can tip her!

Shawty crunk on the floor wide open
Skeet so much they call her Billy Ocean
Roll, like an 18-wheeler
That ho fine, but this ho a killer
She's leaking! She's soaking wet
She leaking! Soaking wet
Shake it like a salt shaker (shake it like a salt shaker)
Shake it like a salt shaker (shake it like a salt shaker)
