		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She caught the melting sky
It burned but still the winter passes by and by
To the other side

A slow parade of wind
That blows through trees that wilted with the season's children

Are we saved by the words of bastard saints
Do we live in fear or faith
Tell me now who's behind the rain

A maze of tangled grace
The symptoms of "for real" are crumbling from embrace
But still we chase the shadows of belief
And new religion clouds our visions of the roots of our souls

Are we ashamed of our own fate
Or play the fool for our own sake tell me who's behind the rain

What do we need where do we go
When we get where we don't know
Why should we doubt the virgin white of fallen snow
When faith's our shelter from the cold

What do we need where do we go
When we get where we don't know
Why should we doubt the virgin white of fallen snow
When faith's our shelter from the cold

Quicksand Jesus I'm so far away without you

Quicksand Jesus I'm so far away without you, oh oh
Quicksand Jesus I'm so far away 
Quicksand Jesus I'm so far away 

Quicksand Jesus I need you
Quicksand Jesus I believe you
Quicksand I'm so far away

Yeah, yeah, oh, oh
