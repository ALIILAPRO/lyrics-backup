		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are here and warm
But I could look away and you'd be gone
'Cause we live in a time
When meaning falls in splinters from our lives
And that's why I've traveled far
'Cause I come so together where you are

And all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you
Fourteen joys and a will to be merry
All of the things that you say are very

Sentimental gentle wind, blowin' through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one
Sentimental gentle wind, blowin' through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one

Now you are here today
But easily you might just go away
Because we live in a time
When paintings have no color, words don't rhyme
And that's why I've traveled far
'Cause I come so together where you are

Yeah, and all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you
Fourteen joys and a will to be merry
All of the things that you say are very

Sentimental gentle wind, blowin' through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one
Sentimental gentle wind, blowin' through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one

Sentimental gentle wind (and all of the things that I said that I wanted)
Blowin' through my life again (come rushing by in my head when I'm with you)
Sentimental lady, gentle one (fourteen joys and a will to be merry)
(All of the things that you say are very)
Sentimental gentle wind (and all of the things that I said that I wanted)
Blowin' through my life again (come rushing by in my head when I'm with you)
Sentimental lady, gentle one (fourteen joys and a will to be merry)
(All of the things that you say are very)
Sentimental gentle wind (and all of the things that I said that I wanted)
Blowin' through my life again (come rushing by in my head when I'm with you)
Sentimental lady, gentle
