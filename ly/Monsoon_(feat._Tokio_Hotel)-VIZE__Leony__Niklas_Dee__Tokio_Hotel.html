		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Runnin' through the monsoon, beyond the world
To the end of time, where the rain won't hurt
Fightin' the storm, into the blue
And when I lose myself, I'll think of you
Together we'll be ridin' somewhere new
And nothing can hold me back from you
Through the monsoon
Through the monsoon

Together we'll be ridin' somewhere new
And nothing can hold me back from you
Through the monsoon
Through the monsoon

Runnin' through the monsoon, beyond the world
To the end of time, where the rain won't hurt
Fightin' the storm, into the blue
And when I lose myself, I'll think of you
Together we'll be ridin' somewhere new
And nothing can hold me back from you
Through the monsoon
Through the monsoon

(Runnin' through the monsoon)
(Fightin' the storm)
(Together we'll be ridin' somewhere new)
(Through the monsoon)
(Through the monsoon)

Runnin' through the monsoon, beyond the world
To the end of time, where the rain won't hurt
Fightin' the storm, into the blue
And when I lose myself, I'll think of you
Together we'll be ridin' somewhere new
And nothing can hold me back from you
Through the monsoon
Through the monsoon

(Runnin' through the monsoon)
(Fightin' the storm)
(Together we'll be ridin' somewhere new)
(And nothing can hold me back from you)
(Through the monsoon)
(Through the monsoon)
