		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I like to get paid
That's why I work everyday-
I'll be making money till I'm in my grave-
Don't care what they say...
I'll buy time with my money
Laughin' to the bank cuz its funny
The money keep coming...
I manifest it 
Sing these lyrics and you'll get it
I'm the bank, come invest it
I attract and I have it
Money finds me attractive

I'm the type to make commas turn a profit
I'm the boss
Willy Wonka
But it ain't chocolate
Yeah, I'm just being honest
I work for this shit...
I'm usually modest
But this beat lit
So I'm going off thoughtless
Talking my shit...
Yeah imma be the hottest
Designer in drip
I'm just comin with the rawness
I gotta admit...
That I'm usually modest
(But I work hard for my shit)


I'll do the work 
Yeah, I'll do it till it hurts
I'll invest in my future, I'll invest in the purse...
I wanna be so rich life changes
cnd I don't ever think about how much, I just pay it...
Yeah, that's the dream
The american dream
Live on top, don't stop till you got everything
But there's balance...
Cuz this life is a challenge...
You gotta live in the now while building up the callus, uh...
I'm the type to make commas turn a profit
I'm the boss
Willy Wonka
But it ain't chocolate
Yeah, I'm just being honest
I work for this shit...
I'm usually modest
But this beat lit
So I'm going off thoughtless
Talking my shit...
Yeah imma be the hottest
Designer in drip
I'm just comin with the rawness
I gotta admit...
That I'm usually modest
(But I work hard for my shit)

It's not about the destination
It's about the journey
So keep working till it's hurting, cuz that's when you start deserving
Everything you want 
Everything you need
Trust the process, yeah you got this
Keep on working till you bleed...
Yeah I've been there
Yeah I've done that
10 long years 
Of breaking my back
But now I'm up here
Never looking back
I got more dreams that I wanna go attack

Keep on going
Keep on moving 
Never give up
I'll keep goin
I can prove just what i'm made of
I got that fire in me
Got that desire in me
I'm never tired 
I'll be pushing till I'm finally free
I was made to break away from the pack
To challenge, to fight, and to carve my own path
This world wasn't made for the weak, they don't last
Survival of the fittest, so be vicious and attack

I'm the type to make commas turn a profit
I'm the boss
Willy Wonka
But it ain't chocolate
Yeah, I'm just being honest
I work for this shit...
I'm usually modest
But this beat lit
So I'm going off thoughtless
Talking my shit...
Yeah imma be the hottest
Designer in drip
I'm just comin with the rawness
I gotta admit...
That I'm usually modest
(But I work hard for my shit)
