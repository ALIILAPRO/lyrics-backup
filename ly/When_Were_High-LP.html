		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There was a time, there was a life, I was inside my head
And finally I rested in your bed
The bars, the dives, the worst of vibes
I thought had come to pass
But still I couldn't seem to make it last

I'd swallow the moon and the stars
To follow the beat of your heart

Oh when we're high
Oh my God, you blow my mind
So let's get high
Live until we die, yeah
You and I, you and I
Let's just do it one more time, one more time
A million times
Let's get high (let's get high)
Live until we die, yeah

A state of mind collected like
A slowly wound bouquet
With memories of our favorite nights and days

Let's swallow the moon and the stars
Let's wallow just right where we are

Oh when we're high
Oh my God, you blow my mind
So let's get high (let's get high)
Live until we die, yeah
Oh you and I (you and I)
Let's just do it one more time, (one more time)
A million times
So let's get high (let's get high)
Live until we die, yeah

Blow my mind
Blow my mind

Oh my, my, kiss the sky
Jimmy, baby, you were right
She's so fine, hips don't lie
Hit me baby one more time
Go 'head and insert any random ass line
Go 'head, yeah, yeah

'Cause when we're high
Oh my God, you blow my mind
So let's get high (let's get high)
Live until we die, yeah
Oh you and I (you and I)
Let's just do it one more time, (one more time)
A million times
So let's get high (let's get high)
Live until we die, yeah, yeah (blow my mind)
Live until we die, yeah
