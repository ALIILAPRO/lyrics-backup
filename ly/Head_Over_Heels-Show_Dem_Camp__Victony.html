		  (Classic)

Body banging
One thing I wanting you moving like a cobra
You make me shout Jehovah ('Hovah)
I cannot imagine another man on that waist
Oh, I'll be quick to come over
Come over

Baby, see the case na forever ('ever)
We go run am jejely tender (tender)
Baby, for the waist, I surrender ('render)
Baby, see the waist, na my header (header)
Baby, see the case na forever ('ever)
We go run am jejely tender (tender)
Baby, for the waist, I surrender ('render)
Baby, see the waist, na my header (header)

I'm going head over heels, oh, oh
I'm going head over heels for your love (head over heels)
I'm going head over heels, oh (head over heels, oh)
I'm going head over heels for your love

See, I be kissing her like
My lips have been dipped in the Lexus of life
Made her a fiend for that dopamine high I provide
No other plug would suffice, I'ma push her
So she looks at me like
The end of the world might just be tonight
And she tryna do it all
Drinking, joking, cuddling 
And fight to have make up sex twice
No, it's not perfection
More companionship, connection
Just enough space, just enough attention
An artform that keeps her on my line
Pure vibes and inshallah
When it comes to you and I

Baby, see the case na forever ('ever)
We go run am jejely tender (tender)
Baby, for the waist, I surrender ('render)
Baby, see the waist, na my header (header)
Baby, see the case na forever ('ever)
We go run am jejely tender (tender)
Baby, for the waist, I surrender ('render)
Baby, see the waist, na my header (header)

I'm going head over heels, oh, oh
I'm going head over heels for your love (head over heels)
I'm going head over heels, oh (head over heels, oh)
I'm going head over heels for your love (Show Dem, yeah)

Head over heels, see the level's revealed (uh)
If it's real, I go free all my pies make we build
I will open up my heart to you
Show you how I feel, got a spot we can chill in 
And be in the hills out in G-H
If you're down, then we might go
Even when we land omo, phones still on flight mode
It's what she like though
She say she ready for the vibes o
She say she wanna feel alive o
I can't lie, your body took me by surprise o (banging)
Dive in your ocean every night (perfect landing)
Champion lover, you're demanding
Walahi you held the boy ransom, I'm going

I'm going head over heels, oh, oh
I'm going head over heels for your love (head over heels)
I'm going head over heels, oh (head over heels, oh)
I'm going head over heels for your love
