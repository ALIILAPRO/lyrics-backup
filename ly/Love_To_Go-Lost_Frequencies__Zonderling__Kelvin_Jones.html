		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Living in the fast lane
Time is precious
I'm counting down the seconds
I can feel you on my skin

I go
In this direction
I'm sorry that yours is different
And it's tearing me up within

I can't keep moving back and forth
I go my way, you go yours
Lost in the middle of it all
Will things be the same when I come back?
Don't forget you told me that
You'll always pick up, pick up when I call

I'll take our love to go (take our love to go)
'Cause everywhere I go
You'll be my home
I'll take our love to go (take our love to go)
No matter where I go
You'll be my home
I'll take our love to go 

(No matter where I go)
(Take our love to go)
(You'll be my home)
(Take our love to go)
(No matter where I go)
(Take our love to go)
(You'll be my home)

All in
You give me heaven
I got no hesitation
After dealing with the tears
Feel the radiation of my feelings
I can give them a meaning
But I know that you're worth the risk

Can't keep moving back and forth
I go my way, you go yours
Lost in the middle of it all
Will things be the same when I come back?
Don't forget you told me that
You'll always pick up, pick up when I call

I'll take our love to go (take our love to go)
'Cause everywhere I go
You'll be my home
I'll take our love to go (take our love to go)
No matter where I go
You'll be my home
I'll take our love to go

(No matter where I go)
(Take our love to go)
(You'll be my home)
(Take our love to go)
(No matter where I go)
(Take our love to go)
(You'll be my home)

Take our love to go (love to go)
No matter where I go (love to go)
Take our love to go (love to go)
You'll be my home (love to go)
Take our love to go (love to go)
No matter where I go (love to go)
Take our love to go (love to go)
You'll be my home
