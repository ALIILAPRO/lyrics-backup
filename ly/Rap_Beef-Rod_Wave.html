Oh, oh
(Will-A-Fool)

Had a dream about my brother, we was courtside again
You're comin' home this year, no matter what I gotta spend
Gave his lawyer three-fifty, his co-defendant ten
They want niggas in a cell, they don't want you to win
They post when I go to jail, not when I give back to the kids
So much came with this life, but it is what it is
You know I finally got it right, was runnin' the wrong way
Tryna live my life, we came a long way
Made it out that struggle, so every day, I hustle
Tryna build a dynasty, add pieces to my puzzle
I'm from where the lions be, made it out that jungle
I ain't beefin' with no rappers, my nigga
That shit backwards, my nigga
And I heard his mixtape, kinda soundin' like "Robbery"
Why he robbin' me? Shit, I guess that how it gotta be
Feel like I hit the lottery with all this cash 'round
Wonder why niggas wait to get millions to crash out
I be ready to kill the world, they play with my name
But these niggas gon' hate, 'cause they broke and they lame
I'd rather put my foot on they neck and these racks in they face
Run 'em down, stand over him and kill the game
Tell 'em free Young Thug, that indictment bitch a beast
And tell 'em free Pooh Shiesty, can't get tricked off the streets
On FaceTime with YBeezy, I told him I salute
Stay out the way and stay true, what I would do if I was you

'Cause I came, I came, I came to kill the game, stand over and shoot
Stand over and shoot, stand over and shoot
I came to kill the game, stand over and shoot
Stand over and shoot, yeah
Okay, I came to kill the game, stand over and shoot
Stand over and shoot, stand over and shoot
I came to kill the game, stand over and shoot
I don't want no rap beef, no, no, no, no
Uh-huh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I don't want no rap beef, no, no, no, no
Stand over and shoot
Okay, I came to kill the game, stand over and shoot
Stand over and shoot, stand over and shoot
I came to kill the game, stand over and sh-
I don't want no rap beef, no, no, no, no

I don't want no beef period, bitch, I don't want no jail time
I don't want none of that, bitch, I'm tryna get this, get these M's
And live with these M's, like these white folks, man, you know what I'm sayin'?
I done already did my time, I already did my struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? I'm livin' on my second life right now, you know what I'm sayin'?
That's what I'ma-
I don't want no rap beef, no, no, no, no

I came, I came, I came, I came, I came to kill the game
But everybody ain't my friend, and I don't like all y'all records
Now if you wanna diss, man, get down with me
Down and do it
But the difference between me and them other dudes is this
You gon' diss me and I'm gon' come see you Jack
You gon' diss some other dudes
They gone play hip wrestle with you
So if you want it man, come on with it
So if you want it with me, come on and leave boy out of it
And we gon' see in here, 'cause you gon' smell my cologne
