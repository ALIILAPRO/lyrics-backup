		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My boat sails stormy seas
Battles oceans filled with tears
At last my port's in view
Now that I've discovered you

Oh I'd give my life so lightly
For my gentle lady
Give it freely and completely
To my lady

As life goes drifting by
Like a breeze she'll gently sigh
And slowly bow her head
Then you'll hear her softly cry.

Oh I'd give my life so lightly
For my gentle lady
Give it freely and completely
To my lady

Words that you say when we're alone
Though actions speak louder than words
But all I can say is I love you so
To drive away all my hurt

Oh I'd give my life so lightly
For my gentle lady
Give it freely and completely
To my lady

Set sail before the sun
Feel the warmth that's just begun
Share each and every dream
They belong to everyone.

Oh I'd give my life so lightly
For my gentle lady
Give it freely and completely
To my lady
