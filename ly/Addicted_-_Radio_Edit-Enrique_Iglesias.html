		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have I told you how good
It feels to be me
When I'm in you
I can only stay clean
When you are around
Don't let me fall

If I close my eyes for ever
Would it ease the pain
Could I breath again

Baby I'm addicted, I'm out of control
But you're the drug that keeps me from dying
Baby I'm a lair but all I really know
Is you're the only reason I'm trying

I'm wasting away
Made a million mistakes
Am I to late
There's a storm in my head
And it rains on my bed
When you're not here
I'm not afraid of dying
But I am afraid of losing you

Baby I'm addicted and out of control
But you're the drug that keeps me from dying
Baby I'm a lair but all I really know
Is you're the only reason I'm trying

When you're lying next to me
Love is going through to me
Oh it's beautiful

Everything is clear to me
'Till I hit reality
And I lose it all
I lose it all
I lose it all

You're the only reason I'm trying
Baby I'm addicted
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
Baby I'm addicted
Don't want to lose it all
Baby I'm all lair but all I really know
Is you're the only reason I'm trying

Baby I'm addicted
Baby I'm addicted
Baby I'm addicted
