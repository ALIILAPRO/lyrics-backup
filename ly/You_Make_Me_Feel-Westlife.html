		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been trying to reach you
'Cause I got something to say
But you're talking about nothing at all
And you're slipping away

We were crying together,
It was a long time ago,
Before you walk out the door,
And leave me this way,
Just hear what I say

You make me feel, you make me real,
For the rest of my days, in so many ways,
You make me feel

I've been trying to leave you,
Why should we go on like this?
But my heart can't breathe,
When I hear you say,
It's better this way

Ten thousand light years away from you 
Keep thinking maybe its time to let go,
But by the end of the day,
I still want to say 'DO YOU'

You make me feel, you make me real,
For the rest of my days, in so many ways,
You make me feel
