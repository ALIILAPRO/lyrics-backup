		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm aching for it, I'm aching for it
I'm aching for it, aching for it
I'm aching for it, I'm aching for it
I'm aching for it, aching for it
I'm aching for it, I'm aching for it, I'm aching for it
One step back, two steps forward
One foot into the vortex
I'm aching for it, I'm aching for it
I'm aching for it, I'm aching for it
Aching for it, I'm aching for it
I'm aching for it, I'm aching for it
Two steps back, one step forward
One foot into the vortex
I'm aching for it, I'm aching for it
Aching for it, I'm aching for it

Forget it, tell me the truth, don't lie to me
You in mind but won't remember in 21 seconds
Forget it, tell me the truth, don't lie to me
You in mind but won't remember in 21 seconds

Had to save the date, what a day
We don't know what to say anyway
Flip up on the way, went away
You in mind, but won't remember in twenty one seconds

I got away but I will wait again
Nah, nah, nah, no more surprises
I got my eyes red from the weed again
Fall, fall, fall, I can't accept

I'm aching for it, I'm aching for it (I'm aching for it)
One step back, two steps forward
One foot into the vortex
I'm aching for it, I'm aching for it
I'm aching for it, I'm aching for it
