		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you really mean it? Do you really want a piece of this?
Do you really want me to believe you really give a shit?
I don't know the answer but the truth lies within
Ask yourself the same question 'cause I'm sick of it, I'm wearing thin
I know what I wanna believe but I'm not opening my mouth 'cause I don't think we're on the same fucking page
Thank you, modern technology, all these people be wanting me in this fucking digital age
What about an introduction before bombarding me with the same old shit? "What about a fucking feature?"
All I seem to wanna put my pen to paper for anymore is just because I'm fucking sick of all these leeches

Uh, show some respect
Oh, you're not worth it (uh)

Go and try to fuck me over, let me teach you some respect
No, this ain't a fucking coffin, make you feeling passionate
Bitch, I got a couple things which where I wanna go with it
Ha, that's a funny joke, do you get the reference?
Numbers, numbers, numbers, all you care about, bitch
I don't see the vision of your shit
Let me tell you, this ain't Matrix, kid
'Cause all these deaths don't mean a thing
Numbers, numbers, numbers, all you care about, bitch (yeah)
I don't see the vision of your shit (fuck)
Let me tell you, this ain't Matrix, kid
'Cause all these deaths don't mean a thing
Numbers, numbers, numbers, all you care about, bitch (fuck)
I don't see the vision of your shit (death)
Let me tell you, this ain't Matrix, kid (no)
'Cause all these deaths don't mean a thing (fuck off)

uh, uh

Dancing with the devil, I guess I'ma swing my metal
You will never reach my level, stand down
As I begin to levitate, your head and neck will separate
You cannot escape from your fate, beg now
uh
Get away from me, you worms
You are worthless, eat the dirt
It's a game 'til you get murked
Guess these losers never learn
Get away from me, you worms
You are worthless, eat the dirt
It's a game 'til you get murked
Guess these losers never learn, ergh
