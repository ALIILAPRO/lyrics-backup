		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm the best that you know
And I got it on my own
Stay in Gucci head to toe
Get my way or it don't go
I'm the best that you know
If I touch it, then it's gold
Just like Kobe, I'm the GOAT
Get my way or it don't go
I'm the best that you know
And I got it on my own
Stay in Gucci head to toe
Get my way or it don't go
I'm the best that you know
If I touch it, then it's gold
Just like Kobe, I'm the GOAT
Get my way or it don't go

B for the Bank and they know I'm impressive
He wanna talk but he ain't on the schedule
I ain't takin' no shit from a ho who ain't heavy
Ho, I'm the best and you heard when they said it
Spend all the money on drip and it's fallin'
Got on this shit and its drippin' like water (drippin' like water)
Teachin' a ho but I don't have a daughter
I know me a ho who pick up when I call her (huh)
Birkin bag and it don't hurt to brag 'cause I'ma always do it how I wanna do it
Every time he leave the pussy, know he miss the cookie, know I got him runnin' to it
I'ma need the full amount before we talk it out, I'm wakin' up and thumbin' through it
Run a beat just like a runner do it
Stunt on hoes just like a stunner do it

I'm the best that you know
And I got it on my own
Stay in Gucci head to toe
Get my way or it don't go
I'm the best that you know
If I touch it, then it's gold
Just like Kobe, I'm the GOAT
Get my way or it don't go
I'm the best that you know
And I got it on my own
Stay in Gucci head to toe
Get my way or it don't go
I'm the best that you know
If I touch it, then it's gold
Just like Kobe, I'm the GOAT
Get my way or it don't go

Top dog like I manage hoes (top)
I'm the bitch who really damage hoes (on God)
I came at it, make the channel froze (hm)
Bitch, I'm really who the panel chose
Put my name up like a banner bow (bitch)
Actin' tough and I'ma let her go (huh)
Name a bitch who got a better flow
'Cause she could hang it up just like a telephone
Real slick mouth but the body eat it
Cost ten K to let a nigga come see it
Bands out now, make a nigga come treat it
Huh, spend make a nigga come beat it
I want the Louis and the Moschino
Jewelry be cold like the temperature's zero
Ho, I'm the hardest, they call me the hero
Havin' this shit and they know what I be on, bitch

I'm the best that you know
And I got it on my own
Stay in Gucci head to toe
Get my way or it don't go
I'm the best that you know
If I touch it, then it's gold
Just like Kobe, I'm the GOAT
Get my way or it don't go
I'm the best that you know
And I got it on my own
Stay in Gucci head to toe
Get my way or it don't go
I'm the best that you know
If I touch it, then it's gold
Just like Kobe, I'm the GOAT
Get my way or it don't go
