		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A dancing puppet doll, made of wood
I bet he'd run away one day if
He could choose to leave or stay
He's got a string attached to every bone
She's got him round her little finger
So she'll never feel alone

Oh sometimes I wonder, did he go
But not the man, of course his soul
Dreaming about wonderland
Wakes up and he's a man

Sometimes I wonder, did he go
Not the man, of course his soul
Dreaming about wonderland
Wakes up and he's a man

Oh, taking control over another man's mind
Oh taking control over another man's mind
Oh, taking control over another man's mind
Oh taking control over his mind

The idea of leaving her has struck his mind
When he sees her smile he's hypnotised
And he can't leave her behind
Looking to his left, there's the door
No need to try, tried it once before
And their bones're hiding beneath the floor

Sometimes I wonder, did he go
But not the man, of course his soul
Dreaming about wonderland
Wakes up and he's a man

Sometimes I wonder, did he go
But not the man, of course his soul
Dreaming about wonderland
Wakes up and he's a man

Oh, she's taking control over
Another man's mind
Oh taking control over another man's mind
Oh, taking control over another man's mind
Oh taking control over his mind

When they were out to buy her wedding-gown
She wanted nothing but the dress
Over a hundred-thousand pounds
But what she wants she gets, or she will cry
Hit's the man with her umbrella
She'll continue till he dies

Sometimes I wonder, did he go
But not the man, of course his soul
Dreaming about wonderland
Wakes up and he's a man

Oh, taking control over another man's mind
Taking control over his mind

Oh, taking control over another man's mind
Oh taking control over another man's mind
Oh, taking control over another man's mind
Oh taking control over his mind

Taking control over another man's mind
Oh taking control over another man's mind
Oh, taking control over another man's mind
Oh taking control over his mind
