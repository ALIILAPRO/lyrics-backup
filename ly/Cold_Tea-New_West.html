		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say I'm getting older
But I ain't never growing up
And that I can't stay young forever
Honestly sounds kinda' fucked up

But that's a bit ironic
Like a doctor on a smoke break
That's a bit ironic
Cause most of you been medicated

You say you miss the old me
What the fuck does that mean?
Don't act like you know me
You're just talkin' cold tea
I'm just more myself these days
I'm just more myself these days

Can't keep up with all these I owe you's
Our friends saying keep an eye on me

But that's a bit ironic
Like a preacher in a benzo
That's a bit ironic
Cause most of you been kinda mental

You say you miss the old me
What the fuck does that mean?
Don't act like you know me
You're just talkin' cold tea
I'm just more myself these days
I'm just more myself these days

(Cause ain't nothin' change but the weather
No ain't nothin' change but the weather
Cause ain't nothin' change but the weather)

But I surprise myself sometimes

You say you miss the old me
What the fuck does that mean?
Don't act like you know me
You're just talkin' cold tea

You say you miss the old me
Well what the fuck does that mean?
Don't act like you know me
You're just talkin' cold tea

I'm just more myself these days (ain't nothin' change but the weather)
Yeah I'm just more myself these days (ain't nothin' change but the weather)
You say that I'm a mess these days (ain't nothin' change but the weather)
But I'm just more myself these days (ain't nothin' change but the weather)
