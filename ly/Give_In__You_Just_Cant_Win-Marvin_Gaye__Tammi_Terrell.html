		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can try to win my love, but it's just too late
Try and try again, but to lose me is your fate
You can walk the streets till your feet refuse
But you won't find me, you'll find only the blues
Oh nothin' but the blues, oh baby
So give in, you just can't win
So give in, you just can't win
No, you just can't win
Oh baby, baby, honey
You did me wrong when my love was true
You just led me on, now I've gone away from you, darlin'
If you call me on the phone to remove your pain
There'll be a busy signal, or else an endless ring
Oh nothin' but a ring, oh baby
You can't win, so give in
You just can't win, so give in
Oh baby, give in

Tell me, what do you get when you call me, honey?
Just an endless ring,(an endless ring) oh nothin' but a ring, oh baby
You can't win, so give in
You just can't win, so give in
You just can't win, no you just can't win

Oh baby give in, you know you just can't win
Don't want your love no more, darlin'
This stuff has got to stop
Ah I can't stand it
Don't need the love you got
I don't want your love no more
I've tried it before
I don't want you no more, baby
I don't need you no more
