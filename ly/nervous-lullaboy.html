		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How do I be a man
Take a stand for myself
How could it be this hard
To say hello
Could it be that I’m nervous
I haven’t been this way
In a while
I wonder if you know

They say keep waiting for the day
Your heart knows it feels right
I don’t know a thing about you
But I know I wanna give this a try

If I could say I need you closer today
I would like to get to know you
If you’re feeling okay
Tell me your name
And I’ll never let your love go to waste
Till then this crush will never go away

Every other day and almost every night
In a way I guess I’m hypnotized
Should I write you a song
All about your eyes
Or introduce myself and just say hi

They say keep waiting for the day
Your heart knows it feels right
I don’t know a thing about you
But I know I wanna give this a try

If I could say I need you closer today
I would like to get to know you
If you’re feeling okay
Tell me your name
And I’ll never let your love go to waste
Till then this crush will never go away

I’m so nervous (n.e.r.v.o.u.s)
Till then this crush will never go away
