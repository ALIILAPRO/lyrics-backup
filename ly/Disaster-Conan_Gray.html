		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Let me just) set the scene
I just left the party at Blake's and it's Halloween
Had the keys to my car in my hand, but I didn't leave
'Cause the potential of us, it was keepin' me up all night long
I left a text you won't read all night long

This could be a disaster, there's so many factors
Like, what if you freak out and then we're losin' it all
At the critical chapter where I say, "I love you"
And you don't say it after
This could be a disaster, I'm pedaling backwards
By saying that I'm drunk, I really shouldn't have called
I'm a little bit plastered, you call me a liar
Now I'm fallin' in faster
This could be a disaster

(Oh) disaster
(Oh) disaster

(Let me just) lose my mind
Is it purely platonic to call me, like, every night?
You know Ashley believes that there's somethin' between you and I
But if I'm readin' it wrong, man, it'd be better off if I died, oh
And if you're readin' the text all night long

This could be a disaster, there's so many factors
Like, what if you freak out and then we're losin' it all
At the critical chapter where I say, "I love you"
And you don't say it after
This could be a disaster, I'm pedaling backwards
By saying that I'm drunk, I really shouldn't have called
I'm a little bit plastered, you call me a liar
Now I'm fallin' in faster
This could be a disaster

(Oh) disaster
(Oh) disaster

Maybe I'm mistaken (oh)
You're not mine for takin' (oh)
Maybe I'm mistaken
Maybe I just made it up, messed it up
