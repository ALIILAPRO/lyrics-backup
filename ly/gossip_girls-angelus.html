		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitch I got nothing to lose
And I got nothing to prove
You left me scarred with a bruise
Fuckin' hate you
They put that boy on the news
He doesn't know what to do
He only wish that he knew
Blame it on you

Fuck this bitch, I don't really give a fuck
Think i'm runnin' out of love
And i think it's all your fault
And fuck this shit, I don't wanna get involved
I don't even fuck with yall, niggas pray on my downfall

And all these labels wanna know what my sauce is
In the scene, I let them know who the boss is
I know they want me so bad, I cannot do them like that
And all you niggas is rats, fucking hate y'all
You can't escape me, oh, you cannot be me
Those niggas can't save you, your boys be ridin' with me
And i hate the way you act, like juno, insomniac
And she asking me where I'm at but babygirl we're done

Fuck this bitch, I don't really give a fuck
Think i'm runnin' out of love
And i think it's all your fault
And fuck this shit, I don't wanna get involved
I don't even fuck with yall, niggas pray on my downfall

They be like "angel where you at?"
I never left
People always picking sides this year im coming for their neck
Bitches sending me a text, but I swear I never read
And he said that we in love, but I only want the neck
Worthless, feeling worthless on a daily
Purchase, I just purchase everything i see
Purpose, find a purpose, I can't see it
Nervous, feeling nervous, I can't feel shit

Fuck this bitch, I don't really give a fuck (oh)
Think I'm runnin' out of love
And I think it's all your fault
And fuck this shit, I don't wanna get involved (yeah hoe)
I don't even fuck with y'all, niggas pray on my downfall
