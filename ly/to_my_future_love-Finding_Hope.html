		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every day's the same
In my room locked away
While I hope and wait
For you babe
My mind blurs the days
All the skies turned gray
So much I could say
But I'll wait
Just hold on
I'm gonna find you before long
Swear I'm trying to hold on
Hope you'll hear my song
Just hold on
I'm gonna find you before long
Swear I'm trying to hold on
Hope you'll hear my song
Every day I pray
That God will keep you safe
That your heart won't break
Oh, won't break
That we skip the days
Until when we meet
'Til you're all I see, I see
Just hold on
I'm gonna find you before long
Swear I'm trying to hold on
Hope you'll hear my song
Just hold on
I'm gonna find you before long
Swear I'm trying to hold on
Hope you'll hear my song
