		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The April walk through fields and farms
And then I held you in my arms
But most of all, I still recall
That warm summer night

The autumn hayride, the frosty breeze
The fading color of the trees
But through the fall, I still recall
That warm summer night

Through all my life, I can't forget
That moonlit picnic by the sea
We left the others far behind
And then you gave your love to me

The winter sleigh ride through falling snow
A kiss beneath the mistletoe
Through cold December, I still remember
That warm summer night

Through all my life, I can't forget
That moonlit picnic by the sea
We left the others far behind
And then you gave your love to me

The winter sleigh ride through falling snow
A kiss beneath the mistletoe
Through cold December, I still remember
That warm summer night

Warm summer night
