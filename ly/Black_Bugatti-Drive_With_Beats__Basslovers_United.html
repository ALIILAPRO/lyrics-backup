		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In my Black Bugatti
Through the heat of night
Baby we can hideaway
Stay out of sight

Through the darkest city
As long as we are young
Baby we will runaway
Til break of dawn

And I will keep you keep you all safe
Until we keep on keep on our pace

In my Black Bugatti
Through the heat of night
Baby we can hideaway
hideaway

In my Black Bugatti
Through the heat of night
Baby we can hideaway
Stay out of sight

Through the darkest city
As long as we are young
Baby we will runaway
Til break of dawn

And I will keep you keep you all safe
Until we keep on keep on our pace

In my Black Bugatti
Through the heat of night
Baby we can hideaway
Stay out of sight
In my Black Bugatti

In my Black Bugatti
Through the heat of night
Baby we can hideaway
Stay out of sight

Through the darkest city
As long as we are young
Baby we will runaway
Til break of dawn

And I will keep you keep you all safe
Until we keep on keep on our pace

In my Black Bugatti
Through the heat of night
Baby we can hideaway
hideaway

In my Black Bugatti
Through the heat of night
Baby we can hideaway
Stay out of sight

Through the darkest city
As long as we are young
Baby we will runaway
Til break of dawn

And I will keep you keep you all safe
Until we keep on keep on our pace

In my Black Bugatti
Through the heat of night
Baby we can hideaway
Stay out of sight
In my Black Bugatti
