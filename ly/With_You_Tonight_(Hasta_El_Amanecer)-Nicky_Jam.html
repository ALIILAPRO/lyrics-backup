		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl you know that I'll do anything
To know a little more than just your name
Only thing I know is you're too fine
And I would like to leave with you tonight

Girl you know that I'll do anything
To know a little more than just your name
Only thing I know is you're too fine
And I would like to leave with you tonight

What's your name, mamacita? My sweet se√±orita
So hot that you giving me the fever
So sexy, muy bonita
You're making a non-believer a believer

Trust me, girl, you and me, that is what it's gotta be
I give you everything you need, make you weak in your knees
You the baddest one I ever seen
Tell me how you fit that in them jeans

Oyeme asi asi, baby I can finally see
Girl you're so perfect to me
You'll remember this night of pleasure
I need you to come now with me

Girl you know that I'll do anything
To know a little more than just your name
Only thing I know is you're too fine
And I would like to leave with you tonight

Want more than just your name
From where you came
Looking at you through me Ray-ban frames
Them girl a dime but girl you not the same
It's not you it's your mother me blame
Me want tell you straight
Let me explain
Keep it a hundred, come ride on the wave
Come through your tunnel up in my train
Just 'cause me flyer than a plane

You gon' call me papi
I'll make your body happy
Every time that you call me
You know that I'll take care of you

You gon' call me papi
I'll make your body happy
Every time that you call me
You know I want you, baby

Girl you know that I'll do anything
To know a little more than just your name
Only thing I know is you're too fine
And I would like to leave with you tonight

Girl you know that I'll do anything
To know a little more than just your name
Only thing I know is you're too fine
And I would like to leave with you tonight (I wanna leave with you)

Girl you know that I'll do anything
To know a little more than just your name
Only thing I know is you're too fine
And I would like to leave with you tonight
