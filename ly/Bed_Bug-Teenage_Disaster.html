		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey man it's me, I uh, I just
Wanted to call and I don't know
Catch up with you I guess and
Tell you some stuff i'm off
My meds today and uh, there's a
Dead body in my house, and it's
Starting to really cause me issues, if
You could call me back, that'd be great  

Bedbugs keep bitin'
That's why I don't sleep in the night time
Creeping in the shadows with a Glock-9
If you wanna die, call me anytime

Off my meds and I made a mess
Why the fuck am I so depressed?
The voices calling and I can't stop
Fucked up 'til my body drops
Handcuffs and flashing lights
That's how I'm gonna end my night
Don't be scared, just take my hand
I'll cut it off, run if you can
Watch your back tonight girl
Watch your back tonight (If you can)
Watch your back tonight girl
Better watch your (If you can)

Bedbugs keep bitin'
That's why I don't sleep in the night time
Creeping in the shadows with a Glock-9
If you wanna die, call me anytime

Oh, just take me away to a different place
Where all my fantasies are true and
All my enemies are dead

Bedbugs keep bitin'
That's why I don't sleep in the night time
Creeping in the shadows with a Glock-9
If you wanna die call me anytime
Bedbugs keep bitin'
That's why I don't sleep in the night time
Creeping in the shadows with a Glock-9
If you wanna die call me anytime

I don't know what is real
And my reality is bursting at the seams again
And I don't wanna take it (Woo)
Watch your back tonight girl
Watch your back tonight girl
Watch your back tonight girl
Better watch your (If you can)

Bedbugs keep bitin'
(Da da da da, If you can)
Bedbugs keep bitin'
(Da da da da, If you can)
