		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have you ever felt the future is the past 
But you don't know how?
A reflected dream of a captured time 
Is it really now? Is it really happening?

Don't know why I feel this way 
Have I dreamt this time, this place?
Something vivid comes again into my mind
And I think I've seen your face
Seen this room, been in this place
Something vivid comes again into my mind

All my hopes and expectations 
Looking for an explanation
Have I found my destination? 
I just can't take no more

The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true

Think I've heard your voice before 
Think I've said these words before
Something makes me feel I just might lose my mind
Am I still inside my dream? 
Is this a new reality?
Something makes me feel that I have lost my mind

All my hopes and expectations 
Looking for an explanation
Coming to the realization 
That I can't see for sure

I only dream in black and white 
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white 
To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white 
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white 
Please save me from myself

The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true

I get up, put on the light 
Dreading the oncoming night
Scared to fall asleep and dream the dream again
Nothing that I contemplate 
Nothing that I can compare
To letting loose the demons deep inside my head

Dread to think what might be stirring 
That my dream is reoccurring
Got to keep away from drifting 
Saving me from myself

I only dream in black and white 
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white 
To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white 
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white 
To save me from myself

Lost in a dream of mirrors 
Lost in a paradox
Lost and time is spinning 
Lost a nightmare I retrace

Lost a hell that I revisit 
Lost another time and place
Lost a parallel existence 
Lost a nightmare I retrace

I only dream in black and white 
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white 
To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white 
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white 
To save me from myself

Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

I only dream in black and white 
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white 
To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white 
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white 
To save me from myself

The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true
