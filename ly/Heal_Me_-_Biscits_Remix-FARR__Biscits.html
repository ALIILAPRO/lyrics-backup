		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was out on my own in a place that ain't home
Ain't no body to hold in this town
Stumbling around, always lost, never found
How to get myself up off the ground

I was out on my own in a place that ain't home
Ain't no body to hold in this town
Stumbling around, always lost, never found
How to get myself up off the ground

I need you to heal me
To feel me
Heal me
Feel me
I need you to heal me

I was out on my own in a place that ain't home
Ain't no body to hold in this town
Stumbling around, always lost, never found
How to get myself up off the ground

I need you to
I was out on my own in a place that ain't home
Ain't no body to hold in this town
So I bathe in the river and pray it delivers me from all my shadowing doubts

I need you to heal me
To feel me
Heal me
Feel me
I need you to heal me

Heal me
Closer
Heal me
Heal me
Closer
Heal me

Closer
