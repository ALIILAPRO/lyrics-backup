		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've been inside my mind
And I
Can't seem to shut my eyes
She haunts me in the color red
And I can't get you out of my head
I can't get you out of my head
Can't get you out of my head I just
Can't get you out of my head
No baby I just
Can't get you out of my head
I love you but I
Can't get you out of my head
Baby you're all that I need till I'm dead
Tell me you're not gonna run away yet
I will follow you until the end
I can't get you out of my head
Can't get you out of my head I just
Can't get you out of my head
No baby I just
Can't get you out of my head
I love you but I
