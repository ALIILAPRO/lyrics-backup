		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah, did you get your fill

How did he make it feel
And how did you conceal
The moans, oh i bet it was real
Oh, i wanna know his name
The one you screamed like the lord's in vain
Cause I know you don't have no shame
Yeah, tell me when you came to

(Meet him for drinks)
Ahh, tell me when you
(Took off the ring)
Yeah, how long did it take for him to get you on the floor

I don't know how it could be worse than what's in my head
See a new stain on your side of the bed
Next to a text that you left on read
You were busy doing something else instead
You put a black hole inside my mind
And I don't wanna fill it with a happy lie
I'd rather hear the worst than a false reply
Spill it all, baby, don't be shy

My lovely liar
I praise you while you're creeping on me
I almost admire
The way you sweeten shit like honey
Do you think I'm that naive
To pull the rug out under me
My lovely liar
My lovely liar
My lovely liar
My lovely liar
My lovely liar
My lovely liar
My lovely liar
My lovely liar
My lovely liar
My lovely liar

Oh, now you wanna go back
Ahh, put it in the past
While you still got a handprint on your ass
And I'm not the man who gave you that
I can't go back to before I knew
You let another soul get close to you
Now I don't wanna know what else you did
I think I might actually die from this

(Searching for why)
Why wouldn't you tell me?
(Wondering why)
Need a damn reason, sell me anything
Cause your bullshit I won't buy

It can't get no worse than the pictures in my head
Is that a stain on your side of the bed
Next to a text that you left on read
You were busy doing something else instead
You put a black hole inside my mind
And I don't wanna fill it with a goddamn lie
I'd rather hear the worst than you not reply
Even if it ends my life

My lovely liar
I praise you while you're creeping on me
I almost admire
The way you sweeten shit like honey
Do you think I'm that naive
To pull the rug out under me
Ooh, my lovely liar
My lovely liar, yeah

My lovely liar
I praise you while you're creeping on me
I almost admire
The way you sweeten shit like honey
Do you think I'm that naive
To pull the rug out under me
My lovely liar
My lovely liar

My lovely liar
I praise you while you're creeping on me
I almost admire
The way you sweeten shit like honey
Do you think I'm that naive
To pull the rug out under me
My lovely liar
My lovely liar
