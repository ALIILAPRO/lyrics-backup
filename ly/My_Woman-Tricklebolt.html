		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My woman it's been such a drag 
My woman but now I've got you back
My lady it's been quite a while
That people saw me laughing but now look at my smile

Look at my smile
Look at my smile

Sad, sad, sad, so indescribably sad
I thought I lost the cutest girl I'd ever met
Thoughts were cycling round and around
I tried to squeeze the brake but it was nowhere to be found
To be with you again, made all effort worthwhile
I did everything I could now people look at my smile

Look at my smile 
Look at my smile 
Look at my smile 
Look at my smile


Look at my smile 
Look at my smile
Look at my smile 
Look at my smile
Look at my smile 
Oh its been quite a while
Hey people, look at my smile
It's been quite a while
