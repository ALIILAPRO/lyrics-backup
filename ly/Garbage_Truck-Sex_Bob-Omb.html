		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woo, oh, oh, oh

I'll take you for a ride
On my garbage truck
Oh no
I'll take you to the dump
'Cause you're my queen

Take you uptown
I'll show you the sights
You know you want to ride
On my garbage truck
Truck, truck, truck

We'll pass the mansions by 
Drive right through the needle's eye, oh my
My, my, my, my

I got a stereo
You just got to turn the knob
And baby, we'll go
As far as we can
I'll be your garbage man
I'll take out your junk
And I'll crush it down

Jesus in the rearview
And the highway patrol is up ahead
In my garbage truck, truck

I'll never throw you away
When you're old and grey
We'll just roll it away
