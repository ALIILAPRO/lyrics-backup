		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jimmy was just coming out of school
When the drug-dealer came
Give me some of that heroin
Some of that cocaine 

Heroin, heroin and cocaine
Heroin, heroin and cocaine
Heroin, heroin and cocaine
Heroin, heroin and cocaine 

Jimmy's teacher was very annoyed
He gave Jimmy the cane
He shared his syringe with a class full of boys
Now they all want the same 

Heroin, heroin and cocaine
Heroin, heroin and cocaine
Heroin, heroin and cocaine
Heroin, heroin and cocaine 

Jimmy's turn to die
But please don't you cry
Because Jimmy is in heaven with his drugs
And the angels all try 

Heroin, heroin and cocaine
