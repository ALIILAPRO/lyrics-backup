		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not saying I'm not sorry
Just looking for another you
It's not getting any better (better)
But what can I do
When there's something wrong
When we keep holding on
To the best days

I'm not saying, I'm not sorry
Just looking for another you
Looking for another you
Just looking for another you
(Another) Another you
Just looking for another, looking for another you (you)

Just looking for another, looking for another you (you)
(Looking for another, looking for another)

I don't know any other way to show
It's not getting any better
I think we both know that
There's something wrong
When we keep holding on
To the best days

I'm not saying I'm not sorry
Just looking for another you
(I'm just looking for another, I'm just looking for another)
looking for another you
(I'm just looking for another, I'm just looking for another)
looking for another you
(I'm just looking for another, I'm just looking for another)
Looking for another you
Looking for another you
Looking for another, looking for another you
