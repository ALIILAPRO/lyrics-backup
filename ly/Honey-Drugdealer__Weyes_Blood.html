		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you're not around, well people have their way with words,
And you don't have to hear the sound, to feel the burn.
Well I get up and down and very close to people's lives.
You've got some things you can't erase, honey I've got mine.
 
I know that you want to be seen, and to be hear, oh to be loved its not a crime.
Money is the root of the game, what you stand to gain, but everybody's gonna lose their heads.
 
You've got the magic smile, that makes people turn their heads,
And take their love and make it burn, for you instead
Well I get so inspired, and you know just what thats worth.
Most people know just what they want, but can't make it work.
 
I know that you want to be free, and to be wild, oh to be hugged just like a child.
Money is the root of the game, the problem with fame, because everybody's gonna lose their edge.
