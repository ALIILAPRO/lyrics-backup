		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Call out of work
Can't be bothered
It's all the same
Call it absurd
Putting you first
Drive me insane

So what if I'm fucked up, fallen in love?
So what if I'm such a sucker for pleasure?
So what if one night is never enough?
Drive me insane

Don't stop
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Don't stop

Heaven isn't as wonderful
Heaven isn't as beautiful as you
Isn't as wonderful
Heaven isn't as beautiful as you

We got big plans
In bed again
'Cause you're no saint
Slipping my hand under your dress
I'm glad you came

Don't stop
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Don't stop

Heaven isn't as wonderful
Heaven isn't as beautiful as you
Isn't as wonderful
Heaven isn't as beautiful as you

So what if I'm fucked up, fallin' in love?
So what if I'm such a sucker for pleasure?
So what if one night is never enough?
Drive me insane

Heaven isn't as wonderful
Heaven isn't as beautiful as you
Isn't as wonderful
Heaven isn't as beautiful as you
