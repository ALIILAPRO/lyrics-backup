		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Day in day out
Caught in frustration
Endless highways
My only fiction
It's hard to find the words
The words you understand
Haunting nightmares
That never end

Cause I never really tried
To look into your eyes
Look into your eyes
Again

Night in night out
Caught in frustration
Efforts are worthless
No one needs them
Do you realize
Do you recognize
New destinations
Too late to change your mind

Cause I never really tried
To look into your eyes
Look into your eyes
Again
