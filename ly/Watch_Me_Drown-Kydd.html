		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My mind plays tricks on me,

In peace I try to live,

Through weed and alcohol I find a little piece of this,

I got these memories,

I miss those times we lived,

We wish we could go back but would it feel the same again,

Verse 1

I got these walls of mine,

Behind this field of mines,

Skeptic behind blue eyes,

You’ll never understand me,

I’ve cried a thousand times,

Questioned why I’m alive,

It must not be my time,

Well maybe god was right,

I hate to feel this way,

Why do I live like this,

Its hard to keep your head up when nobody gives a shit,

I wanna run away,

Never return again,

Wish I could spread my wings,

Float away with the wind,

I guess that’s what I get for trying live the wild side,

But ill admit I had some fun on that wild ride,

We’ve all done stupid shit that don’t make you a bad guy,

It takes a lot to ease my mind, my mind because,

Hook 2

My mind plays tricks on me,

In peace I try to live,

Through weed and alcohol I find a little piece of this,

I got these memories,

I miss those times we lived,

We wish we could go back but would it feel the same again,

Verse 2

I lost a lot of friends,

They don’t like me no more,

It breaks my heart they was supposed to be with me on tour,

Ive seen a lot of things,

Been through a lot of days,

These ups these downs these forward backward steps im trying to make,

Ive been so worried bout my life I aint been living it I swear to god im tryna be positive just a little bit,

Its like tryna catch your breath,

Under water that’s over your head,

And the whole time your drowning,

Nobody wanna lend a fucking hand,

So everybody just sits back to watch you drown,

How long can you hold your breathe before blacking out,

Now shhhhhh,

They don’t wanna hear you splash around,

This is what it feels like when you’re all by yourself,

Hook 3

My mind plays tricks on me,

In peace I try to live,

Through weed and alcohol I find a little piece of this,

I got these memories,

I miss those times we lived,

We wish we could go back but would it feel the same again,

My mind plays tricks on me,

In peace I try to live,

Through weed and alcohol I find a little piece of this,

I got these memories,

I miss those times we lived,

We wish we could go back but would it feel the same again.
