		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ice, ice, ice, this cup will get me through the night, night, night, night, night
Lately, you give me life, life, life, with you I can live, not just survive
Yeah (Goddamn)
Yeah, yeah, ay
Ice, ice, ice, this cup will get me through the night, night, night, night, night
Lately, you give me life, life, life, with you I can live, not just survive

Smile cost me thirty thousand (ice, ice, baby)
So much water, I'm a whole island (ice, ice, baby)
Heart cold just like my diamonds (ice, ice, baby)
Bust down Rollie, perfect timing (ice, ice, baby)

Police say, "freeze", my diamonds doing that
Pussy piercing on her cat, man, I spent a couple racks on it
Fat mama poking, see it when approaching
Choker chain chokin', pull on it while I stroke it
Uh, she like, ice me out, uh
I'm like, eat it up, yeah
She like, fly me out
She ain't like the riches I'm spending
The only thing she really care about
But I ain't saying she a gold digger, digger, digger
But she ain't fucking with no broke nigga, nigga, nigga
Ten figures, real hitta, shoulder chip getting bigger
One dollar, two dollar, three dollar
Millla', milla', what I spent on whips
Paid hitta, not a slave nigga

Ice, ice, ice, this cup will get me through the night, night, night, night, night
Lately, you give me life, life, life, with you I can live, not just survive

Smile cost me thirty thousand (ice, ice, baby)
So much water, I'm a whole island (ice, ice, baby)
Heart cold just like my diamonds (ice, ice, baby)
Bust down Rollie, perfect timing (ice, ice, baby)

Ice on my neck, ice on my wrist
Ice on my bitch, ice, ice, baby
Talk a little slick like a pimp, Rick
Owens on the kicks, ice, ice, baby
Ice on my neck, ice on my wrist
Ice on my bitch, ice, ice, baby
Talk a little slick like a pimp, Rick
Owens on the kicks, ice, ice, baby
