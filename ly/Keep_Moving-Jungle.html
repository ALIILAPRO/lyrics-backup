		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Unless you understand it and find out what to do
Don't think about it, I'll be running with you
If I can't understand it, I'll find another way
Keep moving, keep moving

Keep moving, keep moving
Keep moving, keep moving

Main Avenue
If you're coming like that, then it's been about time, you know
In a new house, in a new place
If you change
Keep moving, keep moving
I could hear the alarm
I won't take it much longer
(Keep moving, keep moving)
Are you breaking my heart?
Thanks for making me stronger
(Keep moving)

Someone's got to go find the truth
If you change
When you livin' like that, you can spend around town, you know
In a new house, in the UK
If you change
Keep moving, keep moving

I could hear the alarm
I won't take it much longer
(Keep moving, keep moving)
Are you breaking my heart?
Thanks for making me stronger

I could live with it, I could live with it, oh
I could live with it, I could live with it, oh
I could live with it, I could live with it, oh
I could live with it, I could live with it, oh

Unless you understand it, then find out what to do
Don't think about it, I'll be running with you
If I can't understand it, I'll find another way
I could live with it, I could live with it, oh

Moving, keep moving
Keep moving, keep moving
Moving, keep moving
Keep moving, keep moving
