		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hope that you finally found it all (it all, it all)
All the things that you said that you needed after all (after all)
All those times we had, they left a mark (mark, mark)
And I know life goes on but I miss you in the dark

Days turn to years, turn to stories we tell about
All of the good times and times that were hell when

We were young (we were young), we were broke (we were broke)
We were chasin' a fire and watchin' it turn to smoke (smoke)
And some of us just let go (oh)
You got lost (you got lost), had enough (had enough)
Time, it did what it does and turned what you had to rust
But wherever you are, understand me

You were loved
(Loved, loved, ooh)
You were loved
(Loved, loved, ooh)

I hope that our paths, they cross again (again, again, again)
'Cause I'm dyin' to know all the places you have been (oh)
Some day when the future meets the past
That's when we'll make up for all of the years that went so fast, mm

'Cause days became years became stories we tell
That I know you can't deal but here's wishin' you well

We were young (we were young), we were broke (we were broke)
We were chasin' a fire that suddenly turned to smoke
And some of us had to let go (oh), yeah
You got lost (you got lost), had enough (had enough)
Time, it did what it does and turned what we had to rust
But wherever you are, you should know (ooh)

You were loved
(Loved, loved, ooh)
You were loved
(Loved, loved, ooh)
You were loved
(Loved) loved (loved, ooh)
(Loved, loved, ooh)
You were loved
(Loved, loved, ooh)
(Loved, loved, ooh)
