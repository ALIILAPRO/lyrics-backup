		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Abandon me death in my veins
Look down on me 'Cause I feel the same

With nothing left to give, I feel so empty
With the judgement raining down
Is only skin deep

I feel the pain inside my lungs
When you take away the ones that I love
And I feel the pain with so few to trust
When they fall away and say I'm not enough

They abandon me 'Cause I'm not like them
They hold me down and tell me what I am

I feel the death inside this place around me
I know that you will live
Only near surround me

I feel the pain inside my lungs
When you take away the ones that I love
And I feel the pain with so few to trust
When they fall away and say I'm not enough

When I have nothing, you're always with me
With me
When I have nothing, I need you here
Next to me next to me
