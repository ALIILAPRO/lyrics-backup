		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mixing up wok in the four
Two in the mornin we rollin up woods on the go
Making these hits on the low
Feel like i'm dying i'm tired but nobody knows
Bitches they act like they broke
Walk in the club with the model she up on the pole
Slide thru the pad on the low
Smoke on the gas i been lifted i'm losing my soul (But i'm)
Feeling amazing this shit kinda crazy
Spending my money i been on the coast
Leave it or take it i feel like i made it
But baby you don't understand how it goes
Paper been stacking i'm making it happen
Buy what i want and i'm spending some more
Cuz i don't give a fuck about anything else
But the people that take me away from it all
Bitches on bitches don't ask for the names
Stack up the paper the money i'm making
Bottles on bottles all out of patience
Baby i'm sorry i know that you hate it
Problems on problems i don't wanna fix them
Thinking too much cuz i don't like to listen
Shawty she calling she said i'm a villain
Roll up a blunt with the liquor i'm sippin
Lately been lost in my head
Don't understand who the fuck i been living for
Sorry i feel like i'm dead
Don't want to tell you i might want to end it all
Remember the days
Sleep from the ground to the couches
Now i'm the one laughing bitch
Stuck in a days
Hit up the club on the coast
Cuz the bitches they interstate
