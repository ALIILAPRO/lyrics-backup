		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Love Is Beautiful
Friends ask about ya
From time to time
Are you alright?
I'm just happy it's getting easier to say Im fine
Are you somewhere out there Stuck in a crowd
Do you feel alive yet
Oh tell me now
We speak so loud
Without a single sound
In everything I do I end up here somehow
Love is beautiful in your eyes In your eyes
In your eyes
(Cuz)
Love is beautiful in your eyes In your eyes
In your eyes
But why do they break us apart
I Wont forget you
I've just learned to try Guess I'm alright Now But still somehow Without a warning
Why you this do
I still
get a million goosebumps When I see you smile
Watched us fall
And as we lost
You said that we were better off Why you want to hurt me
I don't wanna hurt you
I just can't do this

 Love is beautiful in your eyes In your eyes
In your eyes
Now
Love is beautiful in your eyes In your eyes
In your eyes
But why do they break us apart But do they break us apart You're breaking my heart
