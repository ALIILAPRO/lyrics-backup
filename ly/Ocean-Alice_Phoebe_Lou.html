		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw you throw your hands in the air and say a prayer
Your eyes closed, your nose breathing in the salty air
There was nothing you could do
To make me love you anymore
You said, What I despair in you
I don't feel like I'm going anywhere with you
I might as well fling myself into your ocean
At least then I would be with you

And the ocean roared
And the ocean howled
And the ocean roared
And the ocean howled

So you jumped down from the cliff you climbed to
Into paradise that lay below you
I could only stare
And let my tears fall in the ocean

And the ocean roared
And the ocean howled
And the ocean roared
And the ocean howled

And the ocean roared
And the ocean howled
And the ocean roared
And the ocean howled
