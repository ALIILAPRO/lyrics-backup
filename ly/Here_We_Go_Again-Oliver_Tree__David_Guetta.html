		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why would you say that it's already done?
The truth is that it has barely begun
Repeating ourselves, and it happens too much
We both know what will come

Here we go again
It's goin' through our heads
Here we go again
We're all wonderin' when
Here we go again
It's never gonna end
Here we go again
We're going 'til we're dead
Here we go again

Repeating ourselves, and it happens too much
We both know what will come

Here we go again
It's goin' through our heads
Here we go again
We're all wonderin' when
Here we go again
It's never gonna end
Here we go again
We're going 'til we're dead
Here we go again

Here we go again
Here we go again

You can't wait for that day
You think it's coming soon
You're dead wrong, it won't stop
There's nothin' you can do

Why would you say that it's already done?
The truth is that it has barely begun
Repeating ourselves, and it happens too much
We both know what will come

Here we go again
It's goin' through our heads
Here we go again
We're all wonderin' when
Here we go again
It's never gonna end
Here we go again
We're going 'til we're dead
Here we go again
It's goin' through our heads
Here we go again
We're all wonderin' when
Here we go again
It's never gonna end
Here we go again
We're going 'til we're dead
Here we go again

Here we go again
Here we go again
