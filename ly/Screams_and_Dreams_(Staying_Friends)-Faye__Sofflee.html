		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Little boy so full of joy
Wearing round glasses and short blue trousers
Jumping and skipping down by the bay
With no words to say

And I guess this is the way it ends
And there’s no point in staying friends

Big singing girl out in the bar
From home so far
Little girl out alone in the world
Going forth showing what she’s worth 

And I guess this is the way it ends
And there’s no point in staying friends

And I remember when you told me that you loved me
Little did I know and little did I say
You were over your head
And I hadn’t yet said
What’s true in my heart
To create a thing called art 

So I wish upon a star
And I promise I’ll go far
And I close my eyes at once
And I hear a thousand songs 

(Instrumental piano)

And I close my eyes 
And hear a thousand songs 

And I wish upon a star 
And I promise I’ll go far 

And I guess this is the way it ends
And there’s no point in staying friends
And it’s time to turn your screams into dreams
