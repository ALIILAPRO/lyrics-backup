		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She up like five, six in the morn'
With our vices any or
Even if it’s broken,  torn
Heaven sent, we went for more, more (More)
Tell me when you’re down to pour, pour
Gasoline can hit the floor

Long days get monsters (Monsters)
Been pouring that vodka (Vodka)
Deep dive, no walk ups (Walks ups)
No trust, but I got love, yeah
Nonsense you lost us (Lost us)
Bad one been caught up (Caught up)
Real ones get locked up (Locked up)
Lowlights and a lock jaw

She up like five, six in the morn'
With our vices any or
Even if it’s broken, torn
Hеaven sent, we wеnt for more, more (More)
Tell me when you’re down to pour, pour
Gasoline can hit the floor

Been up, we lost tonight
Nothing left to tell me twice
Reasons why we roll the dice
Still been cutting through like knives
(Knives)
Like wait up, we been counting them pay stubs
Paranoid when I wake up
Crashing through that shake up, whoa
Might just need a moment, might be in a rush
(In a rush)
Maybe it's a little, maybe it's enough
(Enough)
Maybe it's forever, maybe it’s too much
(Too much) still no matter what

She up like five, six in the morn'
With our vices any or
Even if it’s broken, torn
Heaven sent, we went for more, more (More)
Tell me when you’re down to pour, pour
Gasoline can hit the floor
Five, six in the morn' with our vices any or
Even if it’s broken, torn
Heaven sent, we went for more, more
Tell me when you’re down to pour, pour
Gasoline can hit the floor
Gasoline can hit the floor
Even if it’s broken, torn
