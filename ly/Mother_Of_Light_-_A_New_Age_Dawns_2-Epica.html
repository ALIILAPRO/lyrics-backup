		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It always put me on the edge
To think of all the spoilt lives
Today I'm one step further
Not sure if I've survived myself

Reality is sometimes stranger than fiction
Whatever happens in my dreams
And I know it can't be worse than this
So I prefer to sleep

I am searching without vision
For the answers in the dirt
I am waiting just for nothing
For the day that I'll be heard

You're the sea in which I'm floating
And I lose myself in you
I am feeling these sensations
I communicate with you

I am looking without vision
For a different kind of way
I am thinking just for nothing
About that specific day

You're the night so you're the dark side
Of the day you'll never see
You're the past but everlasting
Can you share one day with me?

You're the hand that I rejected
But I can't forgive myself
I am selfish and not worthy
To think of, even to die for

Reality is sometimes stranger than fiction
Whatever happens in my dreams
I know it can't be worse than this
So I prefer to sleep

Tomorrow, don't know where I'll be
I need some place to go now
So do you know the way I feel
Or shall I give up my belief?

You're the lock I've never opened
'Cause I threw away the key
I'm enclosed within my own thoughts
That will never set me free

You're the hand that I rejected
But I can't forgive myself
I am selfish and not worthy
To think of, even to die for

You're the question to the answer
And without there'll never be
Any thought in this direction
You've created this in me

You're the hand that I rejected
But I can't forgive myself
I am selfish and not worthy
To think of, even to die for

Serenity is taking over all I am, it gives me peace
And all I see are visions of my destiny
Why should I bleed and pay for others' greed?

We consciously sign our own sentence of death
How can you go on, did you forget
What we have learnt from the past?
We can't go on killing ourselves
And with us all the rest
Why can't you see, don't you regret?

Reality is sometimes stranger than fiction
Whatever happens in my dreams
And I know it can't be worse than this
So I prefer to sleep

I am alone with all my thoughts
Alone without a hope and
I lost the thing I needed most
I feel I can't survive this fall
