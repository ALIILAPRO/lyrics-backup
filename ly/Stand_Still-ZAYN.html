		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Skies of blue and birds of yellow
Flowers growing just to bloom
A million chances of our glances
Catching eyes across the room

If time stands still
Move I will to you
This was filmed
Somehow I see you
Move I will to you

Break a ball upon your fence now
Yet your beauty would still shine
I would live a thousand lifetimes
If it's you I'm sent to find

If time stands still
Move I will to you
This was filmed
Somehow I see you
Move I will to you

Move I don't want it babe
Left the ranks of targets stuck
Nothing can stop us
Move I don't want it babe
Left the ranks of targets stuck
Nothing gets stuck

If time stands still
Move I will to you
This was filmed
Somehow I see you
If time stands still
Move I will to you (move I will to you)
This was filmed ('cause this was filmed)
Somehow I see you (somehow I see you)
Move I will to you (somehow I see you)
