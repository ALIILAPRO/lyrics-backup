		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Before we could talk
We were singing
Before we could walk
We were dancing
Life is short
But not a day is lost
The world goes round and round
And we go on and on...

Beijing to Amsterdam
Berlin to Buenos Aires
Sydney to L.A.
Rio to Abidjan
Stockholm to Athena
Dublin to Guatemala
London to Brasilia
Madrid to Philadelphia

Paris to San Francisco
Detroit to Warszawa
Moscow to Mexico
Oslo to New Dehli
Helsinki to New Orleans
Vienna to Lisboa
On earth, we're all

Dancing with the hidden tribe
Learning to move and fly
Touching the sky with our hands
Longing to love to understand

Dancing with the hidden tribe
Learning to move and fly
Touching the sky with our hands
Longing to love to understand

Wide World!
Our World!

New York to Tokyo
Melbourne to Budapest
Prague to Jaipur
Shangai to Montreal
Vancouver to Singapore
Sofia to Johannesburg
Hong Kong to St. Petersburg
On earth, we're all

Dancing with the hidden tribe
Learning to move and fly
Touching the sky with our hands
Longing to love to understand

Dancing with the hidden tribe
Learning to move and fly
Touching the sky with our hands
Longing to love to understand

Wide World!
Wide World!
Our World!

Dancing with the hidden tribe
Learning to move and fly
Touching the sky with our hands
Longing to love to understand

Dancing with the hidden tribe
Learning to move and fly
Touching the sky with our hands
Longing to love to understand
