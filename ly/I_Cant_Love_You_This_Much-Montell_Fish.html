		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And after all these years
And still I want you here
I'm here for you
If you want me, too
And though you did me bad
And often make me sad
I'm here for you, ooh

I'm still here for you (if you want me, too)
I'm still here for you
I'm still here for you (if you want me, too)
I'm still here for you
I'm still here for you
I'm still here for you
I'm still here for you
I'm still

And that's what people don't understand
Love just doesn't go away, it stays there
It haunts you
It keeps you from trustin'
And that's why it's so hard to let go
I choose to put an end to this chapter in my life
And though I waited for you like God waits for His own children
I must let go of you 'cause I'm not God
I love you, Jamie
