		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought we'd have a long time
So I let the weeks go by
I'm sorry that I missed u
That day when you came through
I didn't know the last time
Would be our last goodbye
I'm sorry that I missed u
When you called me last June
But now that I've lost you
I tried to forget you
And all that we've been through
Been through
But there is no use
If I'll always love you
I'll let myself miss u
Miss u
You never did waste your time
You were always on the next flight
It's almost like you already knew
Since the day you turned 22
You always gave me that smile
Even if it had been a while
I'm sorry that I missed you
When you asked, "Are you coming through?"
But now that I've lost you
I tried to forget you
And all that we've been through
Been through
But there is no use
If I'll always love you
I'll let myself miss u
Miss u
If I had known then
I won't see you again
I wouldn't have missed u
Missed u
I'll hold onto regrets
'Til I see you again
All I can do is miss u
Miss u
If I had known then
I won't see you again
I wouldn't have missed u
Missed u
I'll hold onto regrets
'Til I see you again
All I can do is miss u
Miss u
If I had known then
I won't see you again
I wouldn't have missed u
Missed u
I'll hold onto regrets
'Til I see you again
All I can do is miss u
Miss u
