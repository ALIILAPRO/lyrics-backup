		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Plucked strings on porches
A poor boy's choir
My blood's at a boil
There ain't no fire
I just love the way the light beams in
But I got bad news, I'm fearing Friday again

Chokin' on some bourbon when you roll up
You say, "Boy, you got a face it, you's ain't that tough"
There's a house hoppin' on the edge of town
I'm revved up, thirsty, and ready to drown

I got a fear, dear, that it's gonna end
Won't you get angry at me?
Say you love me again
I got a fear, dear, that it's a Friday spark
You only love me like you mean it
When it's after dark

We can hide out tonight, out
Where the trees get clear
Those please you eyes
Are a man's worst fear
There's a name saved on your heart's gravestone
Saturday's coming, I fear I'm waking alone

I got a fear, dear, that it's gonna end
Won't you get angry at me?
Say you love me again
I got a fear, dear, that it's a Friday spark
You only love me like you mean it
When it's after dark

I got a fear, dear, that it's gonna end
Won't you get angry at me?
Say you love me again
I got a fear, dear, that it's a Friday spark
You only love me like you mean it
When it's after dark
