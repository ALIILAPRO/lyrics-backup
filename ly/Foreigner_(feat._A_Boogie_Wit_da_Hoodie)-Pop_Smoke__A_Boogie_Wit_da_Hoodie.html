Foreigner (ah)

Foreigner

My bitch a foreigner and she love to fuck
She suck it up, make her fall in love
Put that on her tongue, Perky on her tongue
She do the walks for us, make her one of us
The gas that I'm smokin', potent
Ice on my neck, snowin'
I'm dark skin, glowin'
Off the Perky, I'm rollin'
Valet, park it
I'm screamin', I'm barkin'
They like, "Papi, why you starting?"
Pop a Perc, go retarded
They know I'm wild and I need that respect
Seven hunnid grams, ice with baguettes
Pop Smoke, niggas know I'm up next
Dre keep on shooting until it's nothing left
I'm 823, yeah, I throw up the set
20 years old but I move like a vet
Talk out your mouth, you better invest in a vest
Nigga, 'cause you could get left
Your bitch is a foreigner, huh?
I fuck her and pass her, show her difference between a dog, and a master
Lamborghini truck, floorin'
Got your bitch in the bank, whorin'
She like, "Papi, I adore you"
I'm like, "Baby, I ain't normal"
Rrrrr

Foreigner (grr)
Foreigner (bah)
Foreigner (woo)
Foreigner (ah)
Foreigner (grr)
Foreigner (bah)

Foreigner

Hoodie on, it get scary
Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary
Christian Dior, I need more
Don't do Saint Laurent anymore
Yeah, na na na, let it off
(Yeah) Yeah, let's go
Yeah, .45 in my drawers
And they say I sound like a dog, huh (rrrr)
On God I'm in front
I was in all the stars
I bought every Hermes scarves
Yeah, do you feel me?
Thousand pair of Mike Amiri's
But I still need more
I could go and on, yeah
I ain't even gotta talk, yeah
Chopper go, "na na na"
Hoodie on, with a semi
Young nigga with a Richie
Young nigga with a Richie
The Richie, the one that had came with the big head, nigga, Jimmy
Headshot, that's a Jimmy
Big dawg in my city
Kill a opp and his bitch
Red dot to her titty, yeah

Foreigner (grr)

Foreigner (bah)
Foreigner
