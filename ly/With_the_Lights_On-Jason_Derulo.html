		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just wanna freak you with the lights on

Baby, leave them on
I don't want them off
When I see them draws
Pucker, pucker, that's a no
We gonna make it home
Pull it to the side
You say you can ride
Baby, show me in my ride

Let me hit in the front
Let me hit in the back now
To the middle of the club
To the back of the 'Lac now
All around the world, no matter where you at now
I can't wait to give you what you want

Girl, you know you bad
Like the mic's on right
Hope you don't mind
I keep my Nikes on, right
We can film it all on my IPhone 5
I just wanna freak you with the lights on

Girl, you know you bad
Like the mic's on right
Hope you don't mind
I keep my Nikes on, right
We can film it all on my IPhone 5
I just wanna freak you with the lights on

Looking for somebody brand new
I got FCK I need you, get it?
You know what I'm tryna do
I'm like uh, she coming to, get it?

Let me hit in the front
Let me hit in the back now
To the middle of the club
To the back of the 'Lac now
All around the world, no matter where you at now
I can't wait to give you what you want

Girl, you know you bad
Like the mic's on right
Hope you don't mind
I keep my Nikes on, right
We can film it all on my IPhone 5
I just wanna freak you with the lights on

Girl, you know you bad
Like the mic's on right
Hope you don't mind
I keep my Nikes on, right
We can film it all on my IPhone 5
I just wanna freak you with the lights on

I'm so glad you came, baby
But I don't wanna miss a thing, lady
So I'm a keep the lights on
When we all alone
I'mma make your body moan
To your favourite song

You can keep on them heels for me
'Cause I'm a keep these Nikes on for real, shorty
So I'm a keep the lights on
When we all alone
I'mma make your body moan
To your favourite song

Let me hit in the front
Let me hit in the back now
To the middle of the club
To the back of the 'Lac now
All around the world,
I can't wait to give you what you want

Girl, you know you bad
Like the mic's on right
Hope you don't mind
I keep my Nikes on, right
We can film it all on my IPhone 5
I just wanna freak you with the lights on

Girl, you know you bad
Like the mic's on right
Hope you don't mind
I keep my Nikes on, right
We can film it all on my IPhone 5
I just wanna freak you with the lights on

I just wanna freak you with the lights on
