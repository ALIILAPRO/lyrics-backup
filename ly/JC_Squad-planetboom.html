		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My God is bigger
He's stronger than the rest he's fearless
And I'ma say it with my chest
Seated in the praises of His people
No one can compare to Him and
There is no equal

I know who I am because I
Know who I belong to
He's the Prince of Peace and He's
Sitting on the throne too
The God of Heaven's armies is the
God that I am known to
And lemme tellya what we gon' do

We going glory to glory
And we never going back
Strength to strength, taking territory back
Going faster and faster, acceleration no lag
We that JC Squad, with that yuh, yuh, yuh
Yuh

He's invincible, never known to take a loss
He's verified
Saved the whole world on the cross
Lord of Heaven, holy, pure, and regal
He's my first and last
And there is no sequel

I know who I am because I
Know who I belong to
He's my closest ally, my standby, my go to
The God of Heaven's armies is the
God that I am known to
And lemme tellya what we gon' do

We going glory to glory
And we never going back
Strength to strength, taking territory back
Going faster and faster, acceleration no lag
We that JC Squad, with that yuh, yuh, yuh
(Yuh)

We going glory to glory to glory, to glory
To glory, to glory to glory, to glory
We going strength to strength
To strength, to strength
To strength, to strength
To strength, to strength
We going faster and faster
And faster and faster and faster and faster
And faster and faster and faster and faster
And faster and faster and faster
We that JC Squad, with that yuh, yuh, yuh
(Yuh)

God has not given me a spirit
Of fear, but of power, love
And a sound mind
He who is in me is greater than
He who is in the world
God surrounds me with a shield of love
It is for freedom that Christ has set me free
The joy of the Lord is my strength
I am not anxious about anything
Because the peace of God guards my heart
God knew me, and appointed me
Before I was born
I can do all things through
Christ who strengthens me
I have received power when the
Holy Spirit came upon me

We going glory to glory
And we never going back
Strength to strength, taking territory back
Going faster and faster, acceleration no lag
We that JC Squad, with that yuh, yuh, yuh
Yuh
