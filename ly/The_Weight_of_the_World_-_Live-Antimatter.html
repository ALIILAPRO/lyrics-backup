		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Save me
'Cause I'm in a sea of beings 
And there's no deny 
The waves are holding me under 

I'm drowning in a thousand faces 
Alien expressions over and over again 

I'm trying to scream, but I can't exhale 
The world seems to spin as I'm left on this square 
With no will to hold on 
Am I the only one crushed by the weight of the world? 
  
Save me 
I think I've swallowed more than I can comprehend 
A soul laid low 

A soul has lost its faith again
Wide awake in this hole 
A maggot on a plate again
Wide awake in this hole 
A soul has lost its faith 
I've lost myself too long 
Am I the only one crushed by the weight of the world?
