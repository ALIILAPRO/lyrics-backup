Luh M
Bitch, I touched a M

Bitch, I touched a M
Bitch, I touched a M
No, I'm not your twizzy, no, I'm not your friend
I see shit from a new vision, got a different lens
All my diamonds hit, just swerve on the cops (skrr)
Yeah, I swerved that Lamb', bitch, I turned it to a chop (skrr)
I touched a M then I made it to the top (skrr)
Rock Chane-'ne and some Gucci on my socks (skrr)
We the lake, it's gon never be a drought
Bitch, your money midget, my money tall as shit (uh)
Pullin' up on X, bitch, it's time to flex (uh-uh)
You say that you crazy, bitch, I'm crazy too
You know what else crazy? 
My money eight-foot-two (yeah)

Rockin' Ricky denim with Balenci' untied shoes (untied, untied)
We can pull up if you with it, don't gotta ask us to
Bitch, I'm twenty-one, diamonds fifty-two
Got these bitches doin' circles like it's hoola hoop
You say you get money, who the fuck is you?
All my diamonds rainin', matter fact, they bitchin'
Bitch, my money funny (skrr)
Fucked my money up so much, it told me that it's cumming (skrr)
Yeah, they had seen the wave
All my diamonds flawless (skrr)
These baguettes don't make mistakes (skrr)
I don't know nobody, ain't no slices in this cake
All this cake got laced, my money steady shake
I'm just stayin' to myself, bitch, I can't trust no Jake
All my pockets got to swollen, had to buy a safe
I put the devil on my music, told me, "Up the pace"
I don't care 'bout makin' friends, I just care 'bout fakes
Yeah, bitch I'm on the E and this shit feel great

Bitch, I touched a M
Bitch, I touched a M
No, I'm not your twizzy, no, I'm not your friend
I see shit from a new vision, got a different lens
All my diamonds hit, just swerve on the cops (skrr)
Yeah, I swerved that Lamb', bitch, I turned it to a chop (skrr)
I touched a M then I made it to the top (skrr)
Rock Chane-'ne and some Gucci on my socks (skrr)
We the lake, it's gon never be a drought
Bitch, your money midget, my money tall as shit (uh)
Pullin' up on X, bitch, it's time to flex (uh-uh)
You say that you crazy, bitch, I'm crazy too (crazy)
You know what else crazy? 
My money eight-foot-two 

Bitch, we touched a M
Bitch, we not your friend
Pulled up in a Lamb' (chop), twizz' up in the Benz
Richer than yo' granny, this shit don't make no sense
Cut off all my friends, them niggas fake as shit
Made a hunnid, thousand, million, billion
Twenty bitches and they strippin'
Broke ass niggaeatin' chitlins
Pulled up in a Lamb', bitch, we all in France
Fuckin' all her friends, I just do my dance
Money just came in, nigga, fuck advance
Boy you broke as shit, you ain't got no bands
I don't need no deal (fuck it), I don't need no friends
We just pulled off in a Benz, 'cause we touched a M

Bitch, I touched a M
Bitch, I touched a M
No, I'm not your twizzy, no, I'm not your friend
I see shit from a new vision, got a different lens
All my diamonds hit, just swerve on the cops (skrr)
Yeah, I swerved that Lamb', bitch, I turned it to a chop (skrr)
I touched a M then I made it to the top (skrr)
Rock Chane-'ne and some Gucci on my socks (skrr)
We the lake, it's gon never be a drought
Bitch, your money midget, my money tall as shit (uh)
Pullin' up on X, bitch, it's time to flex (uh-uh)
You say that you crazy, bitch, I'm crazy too (crazy)
You know what else crazy? 
My money eight-foot-two
