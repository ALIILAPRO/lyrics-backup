		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She call me Luda bitch I rollout with my shooters
She wanna fuck me in a Plymouth Barracuda
I got my gun out yeah she know I’m finna shoot em
I make my opps just disappear like the Bermuda
I got my gun out bitch I load it at the dug out
I’m tryna cum now lil shorty got her tongue out
She wanna fuck now but she know I gotta run out
I jug a flow cuz I don’t wanna make one up now
Oh bitch I’m riding shorty on some hoe shit
City girls wilding she just wanna show it
Shorty let me slide in loving on the whole clit
Where the fuck they hiding? Empty out the whole clip
Yeah that bitch stink
Yeah her breath is some cigarette
And I dip fuck my silhouette
That’s my fucking shlat
Pull up with the guns
We gonna spray it like a fucking skunk
What the fuck? You look fucking dumb
Come and lick my ones
Six nine charger with a blower on the top now
Hippie bitch wanna hitch a ride with her top down
PCH rolling with your girl I’m on top now
Stop now she really on top of my cock now
Woah pull up to the fucking view yeah we finna smoke
Pull up on yo fucking mans yeah I want the smoke
I heard you beat her ass I’m finna show you how to choke
You a pussy hoe pass me the rope
She call me Luda bitch I rollout with my shooters
She wanna fuck me in a Plymouth Barracuda
I got my gun out yeah she know I’m finna shoot em
I make my opps just disappear like the Bermuda
I got my gun out bitch I load it at the dug out
I’m tryna cum now lil shorty got her tongue out
She wanna fuck now but she know I gotta run out
I jug a flow cuz I don’t wanna make one up now
