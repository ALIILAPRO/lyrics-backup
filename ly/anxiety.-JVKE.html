		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I've been stressing lately
But I don't ever let it show
So nobody knows

My friends don't understand me
I'm overthinking tryna cope
I feel so alone

It's just me and anxiety
It's just me and anxiety
Is it just me fighting to breathe, anxiety

Yeah, I'm alive
But sometimes I feel dead inside
And it's been a while
Since the last time I really smiled
Yeah, I'm so sick of faking like I'm gonna make it right
I'm up every night, 'cause my nightmare is real life

My friends don't understand me
I'm overthinking tryna cope
I feel so alone

It's just me and anxiety
It's just me and anxiety
Is it just me fighting to breathe, anxiety

One time for my day ones
Two times for the friends that left me
Three times for my mama
'Cause she always been there for me

Five days 'til I hit the weekend but
But until then I'll spend my day dreaming
About a night without fighting demons
About a life with some type meaning

I get so cynical when I'm living in my skull
I need a miracle, yeah
I need a miracle

I get so cynical
When I'm living in my skull
I need a miracle, miracle, miracle, yeah

It's just me and anxiety
It's just me and anxiety
Is it just me fighting to breathe
Is it just me fighting to breathe, anxiety
