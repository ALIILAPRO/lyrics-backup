		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I'm back at the surface now
Yeah, my head's been gone for too long
Looking for things that I didn't need
But now it's time to move on

Wherever we go - a home is not house
As long as I'm with you - we'll work it out

This tangled walk down these pathways
we'll make it out if you hold my hand
Things may change, maybe it's okay
that they don't turn out like we've planned

Nothing stays the same - the only certainty I know
There're a million ways to work it out

Let's hold on though hope seems far away
We're right here with our lives right before us
Yeah, hold on and today may be the day
That we'll find who we are once again

It seems the things that drew us to this place
can also tear us apart
So let's hold on tight and let's change our minds
Before we change our hearts

Wherever we go - a home is not house
As long as I'm with you - we'll work it out

Let's hold on and I think we'll be okay
There are lights on our way that will guide us
Yeah, hold on - today might be the day
That we find who we are once again

I know I will see you again
