		  This is where it’s going down, this is the location
Light it up and throw it back, no negotiation
Oh no way, ain't no time to play
This is where it’s going down, this is the location

Day and night, lost in the game
On and on, always the same
Thinking we could change it
Here’s an invitation
This is where it’s going down, this is the location

This is where it’s going down, this is the location
Light it up and throw it back, no negotiation
Oh no way, you can't keep away
This is where it’s going down, this is the location

This is where it’s going down, this is the location
Light it up and throw it back, no negotiation
Oh no way, you can't keep away
This is where it’s going down, this is the location

Here and now, that’s the situation
Gone too far, let’s Bring it back to Basics
Oooh if u need an explanation
This is where it’s going down, this is the location

It would be the end of me I know it, yeah
I love the way my heart beats in the moment, yeah
Day and night, lost in the game
On and on, always the same
Thinking we could change it
Here’s an invitation
This is where it’s going down, this is the location

This is where it’s going down, this is the location
Light it up and throw it back, no negotiation
Oh no way, you can’t keep away
This is where it’s going down, this is the location

This is where it’s going down, this is the location
Light it up and throw it back, no negotiation
Oh no way, you can’t keep away
This is where it’s going down, this is the location
