		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shawty snap (yeah), T-pain
Damn, shawty snap, Yung Joc (shawty)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (shawty snap)
Hey, hey, she's snappin'
Da-ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah
Snap ya fingers, do ya step
You can do it all by yourself (woo)

Baby girl, what's your name?
Let me talk to you, let me buy you a drink
I'm T-pain, you know me
Konvict Muzik, Nappy Boy
I know the club, close at three
What's the chances that you are rollin' wit' me?
Back to the crib, show you how I live
Let's get drunk, forget what we did

I'ma buy you a drank, ooh (then I'm a take you home with me)
I got money in the bank 
(Shawty, what you think about that? I'll be in the gray Cadillac)
We in the bed like 
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh) whoa, whoa
We in the bed like 
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh) whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Talk to me, I talk back
Let's talk money, I'll talk that
Krunk juice bombs, Oakley shades
Shawty got class, oh behave
Let's get gone, walk it out (now walk it out)
Just like that, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout
We gon' have fun, you gon' see
On that Patr√≥n, you should get like me

I'ma buy you a drank, whoa, whoa, ooh (then I'm a take you home with me)
I got money in the bank 
(Shawty, what you think about that? I'll be in the gray Cadillac)
We in the bed like 
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh) whoa, whoa
We in the bed like 
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh) whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Won't you meet me at the bar? Respect big pimpin'
Tell me how you feel, mama, tell me what you sippin'
A certified dime piece deserves Louis One-Three
One-fifty a shot, three for you and three for me
I'm checkin' yo' body language, I love the conversation
And when you lick your lips, I get a tinglin' sensation
Now we're both 'bout tipsy, you say you in the mood
All I need is 'bout a hour, better yet, maybe two
Let me take you where I live, Ferrari switch gears
When I whisper in ya ear, ya legs hit the chandelier
Passion fruit and sex all in the atmosphere
I'ma let T-pain sing it so he can make it clear

I'ma buy you a drank, whoa, whoa, ooh (then I'm a take you home with me)
I got money in the bank 
(Shawty, what you think about that? I'll be in the gray Cadillac)
We in the bed like 
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh) whoa, whoa
We in the bed like 
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh) whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Let's get gone, walk it out (now walk it out, think about it, ah, snap)
Now rock, rock, rock, rock
You can do it all by yo' self
Let's get gone, walk it out (now walk it out, think about it, ah, snap)
Now rock, rock, rock, rock
You can do it all by yo' self

I'ma buy you a drank, ooh (then I'm a take you home with me)
I got money in the bank 
(Shawty, what you think about that? I'll be in the gray Cadillac)
We in the bed like 
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh) whoa, whoa
We in the bed like 
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh) whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
