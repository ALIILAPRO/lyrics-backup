		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I, I feel so unkind 
And I think it will heal me to enter your mind 
I know that I'm numb 
And I think it will cure me to make you mine 
Take my broken parts and fix me now 

I can't feel a thing 
My heart isn't bleeding 
Believe me, I wanna know 

Replace my broken parts 
I need someone to fix me 
My heart won't heal 'cause something's missing
Machines don't bleed that easily 
Fix me now
Replace my broken parts
Machines don't bleed that easily
Fix me now 

You, you keep it within 
I wanna go deeper under your skin 
So come out and play 
Just let me control you 
In this game
It takes a human heart to feel alive 

So let me inside 
My heart isn't bleeding 
Believe me, I need to know 

Replace my broken parts 
I need someone to fix me 
My heart won't heal 'cause something's missing
Machines don't bleed that easily 
Fix me now
Replace my broken parts
(My broken parts)
Machines don't bleed that easily
Fix me now 

Replace my broken parts
Machines don't bleed that easily
I feel no pain
Replace my broken parts

Replace my broken parts
Replace my broken parts
Machines don't bleed that easily
Fix me now
Replace my broken parts
I need someone to fix me 
My heart won't heal 'cause something's missing
Machines don't bleed that easily (easily)
Fix me now
Replace my broken parts (parts)
(My broken parts)
Machines don't bleed that easily
Fix me now
