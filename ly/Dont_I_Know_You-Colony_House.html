		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Am I dreaming or could it be the time
Just playing with my mind and messing with my memory again?
'Cause you feel like a friend or somebody from back when

Don't I know you?
Sure, I guess I could be wrong
But the smile on your face
Has got me thinking you're just putting me on, girl
You know I ain't wrong, girl
It's driving me crazy, thinking

Don't I know you?
Don't I know you?
If I don't, girl
I sure want to
Get to know you

Take my hand or tell me move along
I'm stubborn but I've got a funny feeling
I don't know who I am
But I know who you are now, somehow

Don't I know you?
Are you sure we've never met?
There's an old familiar story
And, baby, you are no one I'd forget

Don't I know you?
If I don't, girl
I sure want to
Get to know you

Don't I know you?
If I don't, girl
I sure want to
Get to know you
