		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't know who to trust, generational dust
Fight it if you must, there's no end
Devil's deepest blue, connecting me to you
Love will see you through, I know it

It's the perfect gift, all your cherished myths
Hey, can I get a lift if you're going?
'Cause nothing much goes down
In this purgatorial town
You mostly wait around not knowing

And we're all chasing the same carrot
With the choices we inherit
Cry till you can't bear it anymore
And the character you're playin'
Believes what he is saying
But honestly, the acting is a chore

You worry about your soul
You dig a deeper hole
It's only rock n' roll
But you like it

Looking back upon the family
In your grey Nintendo memory
Ever chasing after light of day
But the darker ground we covered
Decided or discovered
Turned us into who we are today

Choking on your fate
Great city, shitty state
Yeah, I'm blooming late, what of it?
They mourn their faded youth
They wage a war on truth
Stay and be the proof, or get above it
