		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm the talisman
2nd pentacles of mercury
All are in my band
Swinging in my pendant
Yeah I am the talisman

Grounded, I need focus man
Put it all, in a backwards hand
Had to make sure that I understand
Before I go further without a plan
Had to make sure that I collect
Understand that it isn't in respect
They gonna get what they jus' gonna get
I can't help it, we can't help it
We can't help the man
They subservient since other plans
Yeah, like the talisman
Had to make my own magic balance in the hands
Of course you ain't by yourself
Understand it's not a cell
I can't put you through no hell, if you by yourself
That's jus' what it is
Grounded, tryna be grounded forever man
Feet on earth
Roots digging down
Present in the body
Mind 'n' spirit
Anchored from my soles to my crown
So mote it be aye

Yeah, I'm the talisman
2nd pentacles of mercury aye
That's what that's my planet g
You can't mess wit
None of our astrology
I'm the talisman yeah
I'm the talisman
