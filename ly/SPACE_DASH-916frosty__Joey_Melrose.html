		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, ayy, woah woah, ayy
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah oh my God!

Plasma in my atoms, better take a step back
Throw it into overdrive, tearin' up the gas
Spacin' outta planet
Now I'm running from attacks
I don't even know her
But her friend can get a pass
Space dash, I just did a space dash (Ayy)
Stay fast, I just gotta stay fast (Woah)
Moonrocks, throw it in a space bag
(yeah, yeah)
Baby, don't you fear this life is everlast'?

I I just met this girl
Ain't no tellin' where she's from
She pointed to the sky
So I knew she was the one
Rip another piece off and I
Put it on her tongue (yeah)
Three, two, one, blast off, ready for fun
All I ever wanted was to do it for the city
If you with me, then you with me
If you ain't, then grab a fifty
Point it at my fucking head until
I'm screaming like a demon
With the angels I've been schemin'
Cut her off until she's bleedin'
Let me get it started
Let me take it from the top
Space bitch with me and she
Takin' off her top
Look inside her pupils and I
Know she worth a lot
Nebula to nebula, you know I never stop
Time to go, icy mode, with those pills
I'll just take five of those
In my bones, I'm in the zone
Don't got time for dissing other hoes
Destiny, this meant for me
Fucked my heart up, but it's meant to be
Going fast, fuck the past, need some back-up
You ain't got no cash

VVS on me, moonwalk shorty wanna lip-lock
Martian in the ziplock
Hit her once, she get tossed
Plus the shawty want some musk
Mask on, you get robbed
Let's take a trip, lil' baby, yeah
Let's get lost
Hop inside the shuttle and I'm speedin'
All these people biting and they leechin'
Bitch, I got the drip, but I can't leak it
Shawty want me, yeah, I know she fiendin'
(Fiendin')

Plasma in my atoms, better take a step back
Throw it into overdrive, tearin' up the gas
Spacin' outta planet
Now I'm running from attacks
I don't even know her
But her friend can get a pass
Space dash, I just did a space dash (Ayy)
Stay fast, I just gotta stay fast (Woah)
Moonrocks, throw it in a space bag
(yeah, yeah) baby, don't you fear this
Life is everlast'?

Look at me, with the queen, Freddie Mercury
Uh
Wrist so ice that it dipped in some kerosene
UFO, like a carousel
Thank the Lord for the rhyme
Coming back from Hell
Back then, you would try to chase me
Now, I'm too far in my space dreams
Flip the switch and detonate my life
But you put nothing but the ice aside
Put up broken, make them fix (yeah, yeah)
I'm secret, take no pics (yeah)
I'ma grace, I'll take the piss (yeah, yeah)
2 AM, we off the rip
I'm workin', show my range
I got my life at stake
I think there be too many
People tryna see my face so I do what I do
You can't tell me that I'm wrong
But the kids on my side and
I'm making all the songs
916 on the map, energy in the raps
In a cold-ass world, gotta make it in a snap
(Livin' fast)

I swear she only want me 'cause
I'm young and I'm ruthless
Stomp a nigga out
Now he dumb and he toothless
Bitch, she give me brain
Like a graduated student (Student)
I just cut the pack
And you know that I'm zooted
Your bitch on my left, his bitch on my right
Creepin' on your block
All black like a knight
Bitch, I'm in the cut, like a fucking knife
Dior and the Frost at the speed of light

Plasma in my atoms, better take a step back
Throw it into overdrive, tearin' up the gas
Spacin' outta planet
Now I'm running from attacks
I don't even know her
But her friend can get a pass
Space dash, I just did a space dash (Ayy)
Stay fast, I just gotta stay fast (Woah)
Moonrocks, throw it in a space bag
(yeah, yeah) baby, don't you fear this
Life is everlast'?
