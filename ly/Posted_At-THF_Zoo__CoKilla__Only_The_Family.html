		  (Broski) CoKilla
I got my nigga Zoowop in this bitch with me
Yeah, yeah
Yeah

Don't let us get the drop where you be posted at (you know that)
Lil' bro 4'9", but he tote somethin' with a shoulder strap (on gang)
There go Breezo right out the car, that lil' boy know he stretched (for real)
Now he cryin', but it's okay, can't get his brodie back (no, Wop)
When I pop out, I shoot to kill 'cause you know drillin' is a hobby (you know that)
The fist nigga was posted up on Folly with a Tommy (on gang)
Just test me, watch this ten milli' go off, lil' nigga, try me (try me)
These niggas ain't no killers, catchin' accidental bodies (goofy)

Ain't shit changed, bitch, I'll get you killed quick
My top opp, he died in 12 and they still sick (for real)
EBK and THF, they known to drill shit (on gang)
I just did six and I came home and, bitch, I'm still lit (let's go)

CoKilla told me, "Zoo, keep goin', bitch, we 'bout to blow" (on gang)
I go up a 60, then pour up a four, then I'm in mode (I blow)
My shorties thirsty tryna catch a body, up the score (go)
If he a witness, then my young niggas, they kick in niggas' doors (you know that)

We takin' niggas' souls, we leave the scene and now we one up (for real)
My shorty got the Drac', he super fried, you better not run up (on gang)
My Glock, it got two titties, plus a button, this bitch done up
Smokin' dead opps, I'm with DeDe, I ain't talkin' 'bout Osama (yeah, yeah, yeah)

If he show a sign of nervous, he gon' freeze up on the mission
They like, "Zoowop, how you three and 0?" Bitch, I don't leave a witness (witness)
I should have a suit and tie because the way I stand on business
THF and EBK and we don't never trust these bitches, bitch, you get it

Don't let us get the drop where you be posted at (you know that)
Lil' bro 4'9", but he tote somethin' with a shoulder strap (on gang)
There go Breezo right out the car, that lil' boy know he stretched (for real)
Now he cryin', but it's okay, can't get his brodie back (no)
When I pop out, I shoot to kill 'cause you know drillin' is a hobby (you know that)
The first nigga was posted up on Folly with a Tommy (on gang)
Just test me, watch this ten milli' go off, lil' nigga, try me (try me)
These niggas ain't no killers, catchin' accidental bodies (goofy)
