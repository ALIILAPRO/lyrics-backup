		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The undertaker is a busy man
For he and death go hand in hand
He works all day and digs all night
He loves the dead, they are his life
No mortal can escape his plan
He sifts us all as grains of sand
And then one day he too shall pass
And as he's dying, death will laugh

The undertaker knows no shame
He's come to stake his claim

Rich or poor, large or small
The undertaker takes them all

Undertaker
Bring out your dead!
The undertaker
(I'm the undertaker)

The undertaker is dressed in black
To hide in shadows between the cracks
He's no remorse, just sympathy
For all to see or so it seems
His work is never done
Clients many, friends not one
But in the end we understand
The undertaker is a busy man

The undertaker knows no shame
To him we're all fair game

Rich or poor, large or small
The undertaker takes them all

Undertaker
Bring out your dead!
He is the undertaker
(Undertaker)

The undertaker knows no shame
To him we're all fair game
The undertaker holds no blame

Rich or poor, large or small
The undertaker takes them all

Undertaker
Bring out your dead!
Undertaker
Bring out your dead!
The undertaker
