		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The words you said to me that day, 
I can't stop thinking and remembering 
Was I able to get my thoughts across?
My mind is spinning, round and round  

Somehow, somewhere, I just gave up 
And let the world tell me the answers
I held my tongue, they don't need to know
My point of view, I'll keep it inside

But when you laugh and say it's all meaningless 
I know that deep inside of you, 
That you're just trying hard to find something to love too

There's always something to add to the story 
And if you're drowning all alone, 
I'll be beside you in the storm 
Just be by your side 
And give you more than words 

Give you more than words 

I'm starting over once again 
Rewriting from the beginning 
This indecision's overwhelming me, 
I can't, I can't make up my mind

There's so much knowledge in the world
I'm lost, ignorant and helpless
I could pretend that I know everything, 
But it will hurt me in the end 

Somehow, somewhere, I overstepped
And lost myself avoiding failure
I gave it up, everything I want, 
Every part of me is blind to what I need 

Overlooking and ignoring 
I could only see all of the despair
But it's far too soon to give up just yet
You can't just say it's already too late 

'Cause when you feel there's nothing that you can do 
I know that you want to believe,
That deep inside of you, there's the strength that can break through 

And if night comes around and you're hurting deep,
I'll be right there and hold your hand
'Cause I've been there, I know the pain 
Just be by your side
And give you more than words
Give you more than words

Give you more than words
I get it now, I get it now, yeah 
I get it now, I get it now

I will never give it up and I'll never let it go 
I will hold on tight, I get it now, get it now
Even in the deepest darkness, I know I will find a light 
'Cause you will be there to guide me

Every journey's bound to have ups and downs along the way 
But I can't give up, I get it now, get it now
There is more than just the times you won and the times you lost
It's time, finally we can head to freedom 

More than ever now, I want to bet on this moment here
Make this second count, this precious day lives only once
Here's your cue to hit the stage, 'cause this music's here to stay 
I'm not scared of anything anymoreâ€¦ 

Give you more than words
