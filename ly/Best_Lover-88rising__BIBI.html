		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need to feel your love endlessly
I wanna feel you crash into me
I'm on my worst behavior tonight
Pull you out the zone, you more than a friend to me
I wanna feel you, skin to skin with me
Let's not rush it there if you ain't on your A game tonight
Ain't worth doing shit if you can't do it right, like

Bite on my neck, learn my dialect
Show my love language some respect, na, na
When we're intimate, my love
Don't be intimidated

I only want to teach you how to be
The best lover for me
The best that you can be
Take it easy, yeah
I only want to teach you how to be
The best lover for me
The best that you can be
For me

I need a lover that pays attention to my needs
It goes deeper than under the covers when you with me
And ooh, babe, if you get it right
My love will stay here with you tonight
Like it the slow way
Little touch, little kiss, bring the foreplay
Use your mouth, babe
It's a blessing to be unlocking me
My directions aren't all the only key, listen to me

Bite on my neck, learn my dialect
Show my love language some respect, na, na
When we're intimate, my love
Don't be intimidated

I only want to teach you how to be
The best lover for me
The best that you can be
Take it easy, yeah
I only want to teach you how to be
The best lover for me
The best that you can be
For me, yeah
