		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I said, "You can go"
When I wanted you to stay
I think it's my fault
Oh, oh, think I made you this way (think I made you this)

Now get up in your bag
'Cause we don't belong together ('cause we don't belong together)
When a good girl goes bad (oh, oh)
She's gone forever

I know all the good girls go bad crazy
How you good girls go bad crazy?
How the pretty girls don't ask when I'm runnin' 'round with they pants off
Crazy how you put me in the friend zone
Now you wanna fuck me 'cause you know I got my bands up, yeah
Yeah, let's go
Can't trust me no more
Girl, I might be no good for you
You might be better off alone
But she love matching outfits from Saint Laurent
I spoiled her so much, she got sick of wearin' Louis Vuitton
Even when your hair undone and it's tied up, you're fine
All the good girls go bad, na-na-na-na-na
Tell her, "You beautiful" every day just to remind her

Said, "I want you to stay"
And it's my fault, yeah
I think I made you this way

Now get up in your bag
'Cause we don't belong together 
When a good girl goes bad 
She's gone forever
