		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I always knew you
In your mother's arms 
I have called her name 
I've an idea 

Placed in your mind 
To be a better man, 
I've made a crown for you 
And put it in your room 

And when the bride groom comes 
There will be noise. 
And there will be glad 
And the perfect bed 

And when you write a poem 
I know the words, 
I know the sounds 
Before you write it down

When you wear your clothes
I wear them too
I wear your shoes. 
And the jacket too

I always knew you
In your mother's arms 
I have called you son.
I've made amends

Between father and son. 
Or if you haven't one
Rest in my arms, 
Sleep in my bed, 

There's a design 
To what I did and said 
Rest in my arms, 
Sleep in my bed, 
There's a design
