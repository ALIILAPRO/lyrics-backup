		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Made my promise and I'm keepin' it for kicks
I really didn't think that it would stain like this
I really didn't think that it would stain like this

Took my medicine then spit it on the ground
The fingers down my throat they make a gurgle sound
The slimy little pill is keeping you around

Wish I could come back down

Something creepy buried right below the skin
Yeah you said you'd cut it out if I won't let you in

She said she was sorry but I didn't really care
I didn't get it right but I was almost there

Wish I could come back down

Wish I could touch the ground
