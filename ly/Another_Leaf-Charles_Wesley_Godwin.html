		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been wondering when we'll find a moment to get away
Where no ears can hear, no eyes will see us in the light of day
Way up high in the meadow right next to you in a side by side
Born to love you, raised to be here 
Let's add another leaf on the tree tonight

I bought you a ring soon as I could, paid by singing
Half karat's run in my blood 
Crawling for you through the bar scene mud
Running on E, hope and a dream
Way out ahead further than sea
Faith in you, your trust in me
Let's add another leaf on the tree tonight

Darling, sun's going down
Before it's back up I gotta leave town
Burning through the miles
Trying to leave a better world behind

I miss you, I'm sorry
I'll make it back soon
Tell the babies I love 'em
One day, some day
When I pull down the drive
I'll never turn back
Always be by your side

Let's add another leaf
Add another leaf
Add another leaf on the tree tonight

Let's add another leaf
Add another leaf
Add another leaf on the tree tonight

Let's add another leaf
Add another leaf
Add another leaf on the tree tonight

Let's add another leaf
Add another leaf
Add another leaf on the tree tonight

Let's add another leaf
Add another leaf
Add another leaf on the tree tonight

Let's add another leaf
Add another leaf
Add another leaf on the family tree tonight
