		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How could you know, how could you know?
That those were my eyes
Peepin' through the floor, it's like they know
It's like they know I'm looking from the outside
And creeping to the door, it's like they know

And now they coming, yeah, now they coming
Out from the shadows
To take me to the club because they know
That I shut this down, 'cause they been watching all my windows
They gathered up the wall and listening
You understand, they got a plan for us
I bet you didn't know that I was dangerous
It must be fate, I found a place for us
I bet you didn't know someone could love you this much

How could they know, how could they know
What I've been thinking?
But they're right inside my head because they know
Because they know, what I've been hidin'
They're right under my bed, they're in control

Here they come, yeah here they come
Out of the shadows
To take me to the club because they know
That I shut this down, 'cause they been watching all my windows
They gathered up the wall and 'cause they
I've gotta get out of here
Sink down, into the dark
Keep on running
And I've gotta get out of here (keep on running)
Sink down, into the dark

You understand, they got a plan for us
I bet you didn't know that I was dangerous
It must be fate, I found a place for us
I bet you didn't know someone could love you this much

Nobody's listening when we're alone
Nobody's listening, there's nobody listening,
No one can hear us when we're alone
No one can hear us, no, no one can hear us
And I've gotta get out of here
Sink down, into the dark
Keep on running
I've gotta get out of here (Keep on running)
Sink down, into the dark
You understand, they got a plan for us
I bet you didn't know that I was dangerous
It must be fate, I found a place for us
I bet you didn't know someone could love you this much
