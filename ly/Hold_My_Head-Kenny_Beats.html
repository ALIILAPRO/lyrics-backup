		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No one can
Hold my head up high (hold me)
Hold my head up high (hold)
Hold my head up high (I don't think they did the job)
Hold my head up high

Uh, hold me there
Ride up on me like the present
And the way I did you whatever
Hit me whenever
I hit you whenever
Hold it there
I pick it up, pick it up
Turn it right back around, uh
(Runnin' that back the way)

Before you hear my week
It's just another day
I'm on top of the world

No one can
(Hold me up)
No one
(Hold)
(Hold me up)
(I don't think they did the job)
(Hold me up)
(Hold her head high)

At night, in my dreams
I'm in ecstasy, it seems
That I could sleep forever
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Anything can Kenny Beats
Anything can Kenny Beats, bruh
