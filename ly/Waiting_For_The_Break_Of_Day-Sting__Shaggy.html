		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Right now da ting hopefully get real
Right now da ting hopefully get real
Right now da ting hopefully get real
Right now da ting hopefully get real
I wait no corners if they cut no deal

When the sun goes down
Alive, the world won't stay
Come lay down here beside me
Waitin' for the break of day

In the darkest night
The moon she stays away
Come on, hold me close tonight
We're waitin' for the break of day
Come and hold me close tonight
Waitin' for the break of day (for the break, for the break, yeah)

Blue moon rising
Tides and dark skies
Overnight passing ships will collide
Overside clearly seen at moon-tide
Chest full belly
I think I'm swallowed by
Pace back and forth
Still can't find the motion
Weary hands tremor
So they pray up devotion
A minimum toll
So the soul must pay
With tears streaming down
Cry for the break of day

In the fallin' rain
All your trust betrayed
Them that try to ease your pain
Are waitin' for the break of day

When the laws are wicked
You're forced to disobey
Stand out there on the picket line
Waitin' for the break of day
You stand out there on the picket line
Waitin' for the break of day

You see some politicians
You hear the things they say
You hear the falseness in their positions
We're waitin' for the break of day

When the light of wisdom
Hides itself away
There is yet another kingdom
Waitin' for the break of day
There is yet another kingdom
Waitin' for the break of day
