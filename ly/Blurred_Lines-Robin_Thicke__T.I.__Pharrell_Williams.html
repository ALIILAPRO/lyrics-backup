		  Everybody get up
Everybody get up

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey (ah)
Hey, hey, hey (woo)
Turn me up

If you can't hear, what I'm tryna say (hey girl, come here)
If you can't read, from the same page
Maybe I'm going deaf (hey, hey, hey)
Maybe I'm going blind (hey, hey, hey)
Maybe I'm out of my mind (hey, hey, hey)
Everybody get up

Okay, now he was close
Tried to domesticate you
But you're an animal
Baby, it's in your nature (meow)
Just let me liberate you (hey, hey, hey)
You don't need no papers (hey, hey, hey)
That man is not your maker (hey, hey, hey)
And that's why I'm gon' take you (everybody get up)

Good girl
I know you want it (hey)
I know you want it
I know you want it
You're a good girl (oh yeah)
Can't let it get past me (oh yeah)
You're far from plastic (alright)
Talkin' about getting blasted
I hate these blurred lines
I know you want it (hey)
I know you want it (oh, oh, yeah yeah)
I know you want it
But you're a good girl (hey)
The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty (hey, hey, hey)
Go ahead, get at me
Everybody get up (come on)

What do they make dreams for?
When you got them jeans on? (Why?)
What do we need steam for?
You the hottest bitch in this place
I feel so lucky (hey, hey, hey)
You wanna hug me (hey, hey, hey)
What rhymes with hug me? (Hey, hey, hey)
Hey (everybody get up)

Okay, now he was close
Tried to domesticate you
But you're an animal
Baby, it's in your nature (uh huh)
Just let me liberate you (uh huh)
You don't need no papers (uh huh)
That man is not your maker (uh huh)
And that's why I'm gon' take you (everybody get up)

Good girl
I know you want it 
I know you want it (hey)
I know you want it
You're a good girl
Can't let it get past me (hey, hey)
You're far from plastic (oh)
Talkin' about getting blasted (everybody get up)
I hate these blurred lines (hate them lines)
I know you want it (I hate them lines)
I know you want it (I hate them lines)
I know you want it
But you're a good girl (good girl, yeah)
The way you grab me (Hustle Gang, homie)
Must wanna get nasty (lego) (ay say Rob)
Go ahead, get at me (let me holla at 'em real quick)

One thing I ask of you (okay)
Let me be the one you back that ass up to (come on)
Go from Malibu to Paris, boo (yeah)
Had a bitch, but she ain't bad as you (uh-uh, ey)
So, hit me up when you passin' through
I'll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two
Swag on 'em even when you dress casual (oh, oh, oh)
I mean, it's almost unbearable (ey, ey, ey, ey) (everybody get up)
In a hundred years not dare would I
Pull a Pharcyde, let you pass me by (uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh)
Nothin' like your last guy, he too square for you
He don't smack that ass and pull your hair for you (like that)
So I'm just watchin' (just watchin') and waitin' (and waitin')
For you to salute the true big pimpin'
Not many women can refuse this pimpin' (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
I'm a nice guy, but don't get confused, get pimpin' (everybody get up)

Shake your rump
Get down
Get up
Do it like it hurt
Like it hurt
What, you don't like work?
Hey (everybody get up)

Baby, can you breathe?
I got this from Jamaica
It always works for me
Dakota to Decatur (uh huh)
No more pretending (hey, hey, hey) (uh huh)
'Cause now your winning (hey, hey, hey) (uh huh)
Here's our beginning (hey, hey, hey) (uh huh) (uh)
I always wanted a 

You're good girl, oh yeah-yeah (everybody get up)
I know you want it (hey)
I know you want it
I know you want it
You're a good girl (yeah yeah)
Can't let it get past me (oh yeah)
You're far from plastic (alright)
Talk about getting blasted
I hate these blurred lines (everybody get up)
I know you want it (hey)
I know you want it (oh oh, yeah yeah)
I know you want it
But you're a good girl (hey, hey)
The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty (hey, hey, hey)
Go ahead, get at me

Everybody get up
Everybody get up

(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)
