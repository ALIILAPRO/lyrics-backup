		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Must be something in the water
Feel like I can take the world
Throw the weight up on my shoulders
'Cause I won't even feel the burn

Don't be afraid to dive
Be afraid that you didn't try
These moments remind us why
We're here, we're so alive

Let's live like we're immortal
Maybe just for tonight
We'll think about tomorrow, yeah
When the sun comes up

'Cause by this time tomorrow
We'll be talking about tonight
Keep doing what we want, we want, we want
No more wasted nights

ただ過ぎ行く時間に
気を止める必要は無い
何かを失えば また何か手にする

Don't be afraid to dive
何もせずはもっと怖い
These moments remind us why
ここで生きる意味を

Let's live like we're immortal
Maybe just for tonight
We'll think about tomorrow, yeah
When the sun comes up

'Cause by this time tomorrow
We'll be talking about tonight
Keep doing what we want, we want, we want
No more wasted nights

I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna waste a night
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna waste a night
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna waste a night
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna waste a night

Let's live like we're immortal
Maybe just for tonight
We'll think about tomorrow, yeah
When the sun comes up

'Cause by this time tomorrow
We'll be talking about tonight
Keep doing what we want, we want, we want
No more wasted nights

I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna waste a night
I don't wanna wait, no more wasted nights
