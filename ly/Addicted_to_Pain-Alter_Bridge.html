		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me how it feels to live a lie
Tell me, do you know that it won't ever be the same?
You can't deny, the house of cards just hit the floor
Don't tell me you can save it in the end
There's nothing you can do
'Cause when it's gone, you know it won't come back again
But you don't listen anymore

You're addicted to pain
Too blind to see you're lost in the shadows
Too addicted to face
In time you're gonna lose it all

If only I had said this long ago
If only I had found a way to tell you all the things you should've known
But you were lost right from the start
How the hell are you the one to blame?
You've done no wrong, you gave it all
So why the hell did you have to change?
You broke your back, she broke your heart

You're addicted to pain
Too blind to see you're lost in the shadows
Too addicted to face
In time you're gonna lose it all, yeah

Cry out
You're nowhere now
She sold you out
You're gonna lose it all

Cry out
You're nowhere now
Just tear it down
You're gonna lose it all

You're addicted to pain
Too blind to see you're lost in the shadows
Too addicted to face
In time you're gonna lose it all

You're addicted to pain
Sometimes it seems like nothing else matters
You're too addicted to face
In time you're gonna lose it all

Cry out
You're nowhere now
And now you're gonna lose it all
Cry out
You're nowhere now
You don't listen anymore

Cry out
You're nowhere now
And now you're gonna lose it all
Cry out
You're nowhere now
You don't live it anymore
