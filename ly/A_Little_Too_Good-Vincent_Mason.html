		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  4AM and I'm still up
And I should really know
Not to reach for the phone this drunk

Laying on the floor after one more night
Where I couldn't quite get back to bed
Staring at the ceiling
Throwing words on a text I'll never send

But ooh, well I miss you
And everything about that town
And I miss hearing how you are
In a parked car with the stars out

And everyone who knew us
Knew that we were meant to be
But a year down the road
I can finally see

We were a little too good, a little too fast
You were quicker to catch that than me

Problem never was that we wouldn't last
You were scared we were in too deep
Nothing went wrong, it was all too right
We were staring at forever
But forever came at the wrong time

Swore that I left my days of thinking about you behind
But I can never find a reason worth keeping you off my mind

But ooh, well I miss you
And everything about that town
And if I saw you tonight I'd probably smile
And find something to talk about

But even if our story ain't already played out
You're still two-hundred miles south of where I'm at
And the only thing to do is look back at what we had

We were a little too good, a little too fast
You were quicker to catch that than me

Problem never was that we wouldn't last
You were scared we were in too deep
Nothing went wrong, it was all too right
We were staring at forever
But forever came at the wrong time

Where would we be if we met a little older?
Would the cards that we're holding still be here?
And is it just me, or does this October
Seem a whole lot colder than last year?

We were a little too good, a little too fast
You were quicker to catch that than me

Problem never was that we wouldn't last
You were scared we were in too deep
Nothing went wrong, it was all too right
We were staring at forever
But forever came at the wrong time
