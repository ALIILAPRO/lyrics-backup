		  All of this discussion
Talking about nothing
You would ever say to my face
You think your words are gospel
But they're only trouble
I ain't got the time to waste

You need to get a life
'Cause life's too short
You must be bored out your mind
You should really take that nonsense
Somewhere else
'Cause you've got to realize

I'm doing me regardless
And I don't care what you say about it
And it don't matter If you like it or not
I'm having all this fun, so
Why would I ever stop

Doing me regardless (ooh-ooh-ooh)
No, I don't care what you say about it (ooh-ooh-ooh)
And I'ma do it any way that I want
I'm having all this fun, so
Why would I ever stop

Some people are so mean
All behind a phone screen
When we're tryna live our lives
Why you gotta be so vicious
Be about your business
'Stead of getting up in mine

You need to get a life
'Cause life's too short
You must be bored out your mind
You should really take that nonsense
Somewhere else
'Cause you've got to realize (you've got to realize)

I'm doing me regardless
And I don't care what you say about it
And it don't matter if you like it or not
I'm having all this fun so
Why would I ever stop

Doing me regardless (ooh-ooh-ooh)
No, I don't care what you say about it (ooh-ooh-ooh)
And I'ma do it any way that I want
I'm having all this fun so
Why would I ever stop

Doing me regardless (ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Doing me regardless (ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Why would I ever stop

Oh, It won't turn your glitter into gold
So why are you wasting your time? (hmm)
You should find some
Better seeds to sow (seed to sow)
It might grow one day, but either way

I'm doing me regardless
And I don't care what you say about it
And it don't matter if you like it or not
I'm having all this fun, so
Why would I ever stop

Doing me regardless (don't care, ooh-ooh-ooh)
No, I don't care what you say about it (what you say about it baby)
And I'ma do it any way that I want
I'm having all this fun, so
Why would I ever stop

Doing me regardless (ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (life's too short)
Doing me regardless (ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Regardless, baby, baby, baby (life's too short)
Why would I ever stop

Doing me regardless (ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Doing me regardless (ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
