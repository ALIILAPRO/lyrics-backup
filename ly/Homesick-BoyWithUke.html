		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It feels like a year ago
The last time I saw you
I think that you weren't home
The last time I called you
I hope that you think of me
Baby, I'm homesick

And I'd call you again
But I swear I've been busy
I'm losing my friends
They won't say that they miss me
I'll sleep when I'm dead
Until then I'm just homesick
(Baby, I'm homesick)

I'm trying my hardest
Even then you know that I might not be free
(Baby, I'm homesick)
I've got responsibilities
But, baby, I'm homesick
(Baby, I'm homesick)

And I'd call you again
But I swear I've been busy
I'm losing my friends
They won't say that they miss me
I'll sleep when I'm dead
Until then I'm just homesick
(Baby, I'm homesick)

And I saw your last text
I hope that you weren't wasted
I like to pretend that we're back in your basement
We'll lie on your twin-size bed
I'm just homesick
(Baby, I'm homesick)

So take me home

(Baby, I'm homesick)
(Baby, I'm homesick)
(Baby, I'm homesick)
(Baby, I'm homesick)

And I'll see you again
Even if it is the last thing that I do
I know we'll make it through
But I'm homesick
