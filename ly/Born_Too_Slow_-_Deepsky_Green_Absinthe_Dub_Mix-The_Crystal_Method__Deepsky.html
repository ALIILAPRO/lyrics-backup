		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just like seventies goofballs
He's waiting on last calls
Well listen to Method Man
'Cause if you leave him the last line
Don't leave him the brown kind
Born just a little too slow
Just a little too slow

Just a little too
Oh your lights are burning too
Just a little too
Oh just a little too

'Cause if he picks up the wrong kind
You'll know you'll be turning blind
Gun at your head
Lay him down just the wrong way
You know that he's turning gray
Born just a little too slow

Oh your lights are burning too,
Burning too, burning too slow.
Oh your lights are burning too, just a little too.
Just a little too

Your lights are burning too
Just a little too
Oh your lights are burning too
Just a little to slow

'Cause if you leave him the last line
Don't leave him the brown kind
Well listen to Method Man

So if you're leavin' him callin'
You know you'll be fallin'
Lights are burning low
Your stars are burnin' gold
Lights are burning low.
Your stars are burnin' gold

Born just a little too
