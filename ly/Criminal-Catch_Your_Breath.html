		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me there's nobody left
No one to listen
No one to dance in your debts
Cause you've built your prison walls
Come on, you want 
Someone to rot away with
Come one, you want 
Us all to rot in your prison
Say it

You only say that
You want me
If I fit the crime
So don't you say that
You need me
I won't testify
Cause I can't stand to see the smoke in your eyes
The side of you that can't apologize
I'm not your Criminal

I'm not your Criminal 
I'm not, I'm not

I lived inside of your hell
In your possession
Your only friend is yourself
In your position now
Come on, you want 
To drag me under with you
Come on, I'm not 
Your fucking criminal

You only say that
You want me
If I fit the crime
So don't you say that
You need me
I won't testify
Cause I can't stand to see the smoke in your eyes
The side of you that can't apologize
I'm not your Criminal

So plead guilty
So plead, so plead

I'm not your Criminal
I'm not, I'm not
I'm not your Criminal 
So plead guilty

You only say that
You want me
If I fit the crime
So don't you say that
You need me
I won't testify
Cause I can't stand to see the smoke in your eyes
The side of you that can't apologize
I'm not your Criminal

So plead guilty
Yeah
Cause I'm not your Criminal
