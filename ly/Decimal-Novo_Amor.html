		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Could you let me know?
I could make some time if you wanted.
Couldn’t find the phone,
I guess I got that summer, you said

“I could be alright if you could re-write my life”,
and I said it won’t phase me, but I reckon I may’ve been wrong.

I should let this go.
I could be your water, instead I’ll put on my coat,
‘cause I could hear you stall in the way you said
“is it alright to feel like I do, at all?”
Got caught up in the skylight,
and the words just all came out wrong.

Just called to let you know,
this all is getting old.
And I could be your water instead

Let me get my head aligned,
let my life be worth your while,
bend my arm, I won’t be far at all.
