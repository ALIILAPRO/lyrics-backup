		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got me higher than life, you're like my remedy
And your touch's like ecstasy
I know that I can't fight the chemistry
I'm falling into you

I'm scared of letting you go
I'm scared that I might be losin' control
I feel like nobody knows
I was hiding behind the shadows

Holding on
'Cause there's no one better than you
I am holding on
'Cause I can't go on without you

Got me higher than life, you're like my remedy
And your touch's like ecstasy
I know that I can't fight the chemistry
I'm falling into you

Got me higher than life, you're like the harmony
To every single melody
I know that I can't fight the chemistry
I'm falling into you

It's like you turned on the lights
It's like you brought all the colors to life
No longer lonely at night (night)
You make me shine like the stars in the sky

Holding on
'Cause there's no one better than you
I am holding on
'Cause I can't go on without you

Got me higher than life, you're like my remedy
And your touch's like ecstasy (I can't)
I know that I can't fight the chemistry
I'm falling into you

Got me higher than life, you're like the harmony
To every single melody
I know that I can't fight the chemistry
I'm falling into you

Got me higher than life, you're like my remedy
And your touch's like ecstasy
I know that I can't fight the chemistry
I'm falling into you

Got me higher than life, you're like the harmony
To every single melody
I know that I can't fight the chemistry
I'm falling into you

(Ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh)
(Falling into you)
(Ooh ooh)

I'm falling into you
