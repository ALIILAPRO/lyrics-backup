		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, Hop in that bitch you better float
You better hold all of them bands in your lap, you better tote
And for all these niggas hate, let'em know
Count up every face, hit the sto' and let it blow
I grind too hard for these Prada shoes to touch the flo'
So I'm'a hop up in that Mazi and do the roller coaster
I been running after my dreams they been gettin' closer
I'm on some shit you'll never see, cause I can't never post it
And I'm already on some new shit, that old shit all over
Count Fast is not a team, this shit is a motive
I stand and live on everything if you niggas ain't notice
I swear I ain't tripping on niggas they watching me do it
I'm living this life, you mad that you can't get into it
I'm spending this money, on shit that I know that I need
They like how did you show up to my own event and you looking flyer than me
My ears do the talking for me
My earring way more than a G
Cause I rather listen than speak
And she rather spit on the D
And you rather sit around talk about me
2000 n i n e
How we grew up now you envying me
Just wait till you see what I do at the dentist my nigga with my lil teeth
VVS for the rest of my life
That ain't perm you ain't doing it right
I told bae I see you in the light
For the things that you do in my life
Don't you change, keep doing it right
I be wrong when it's you in the right
Is this love and I doing it right
Uh, Hop in that bitch you better float
You better hold all of them bands in your lap, you better tote
And for all these niggas hate, let'em know
Count up every face, hit the sto' and let it blow
I grind too hard for these Prada shoes to touch the flo'
So I'm'a hop up in that Mazi and do the roller coaster
I been running after my dreams they been gettin' closer
I'm on some shit you'll never see, cause I can't never post it
And I'm already on some new shit, that old shit all over
Count Fast is not a team, this shit is a motive
I stand and live on everything if you niggas ain't notice
It's a real island
It's a location
It is a vibe
It is a feeling
It's what we doing
It's how we living
We gon' keep going
This shit a mission
It's just a lifestyle
It's just a mental state
We wrap the money, save for later like a dinner plate
We smoke the best gas
First place, not last
We are the way of life now
We are screaming Count Fast
