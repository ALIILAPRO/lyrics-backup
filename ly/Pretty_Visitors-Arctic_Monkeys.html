		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Trudging through the morning
The tramp with the trampoline under his arm
Shifts past your whiskers
So stark is the charm while the barking alarm
Waits coiled 'til the corner is turned

And the bicycle wheels all struggle to move 'round
In your muddy mind, blatantly caked and
Unwilling to wind uncooperative time
So she sits on the springs 'til the muck goes dry 

All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast
The shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast
The shadow of a snake pit on the

What came first, the chicken or the dickhead?
Split sleep reaps rewards from ill-fitting thoughts
And twilight forced you to go on a walk
Your legs start running and your leg gets caught
Canopy 19 is perfectly placed for the reasonably frightening
Fall from the aftertaste, you'll have to slip away
I am unhappy to say
Behold as the crook in the hammock plays

All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast
The shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast
The shadow of a snake pit on the wall

Behold as a crook in the hammock plays
Cruelly with the base and the scales
And fiddles with the feet on a balancing act
Gagged, bound and crafting a tale
Trailing wrapped in a gasp

Cruelly with the base and the scales
And fucking fiddles with her feet on a balancing act
She was gagged, bound and crafting a tale
Trailing wrapped in a gasp

All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast
The shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast
The shadow of a snake pit on the wall
