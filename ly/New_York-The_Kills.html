		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wait for me, stay for me
Medicate my bad days
Heat on my high, I'm waste
Speak for me, bleed for me
Steal me away
From all the bad guys 'cause I'm nice

Down here on the Bowery
The city's got me feeling high
Got me where you want me
In your midnight eye
Always remember, honey
When you need a ride
You got me, got me, got me throwing
Got me running wild, 'cause

Eh, you taste just like New York
Before a storm takes hold
You were raised like you were high and armed
And now I'm alone
But eh, I bust my lips on yours
How sweet, the night is dark enough
We're only seeing stars

You're made for me, come back, babe
Leaving nothing to harm me every time you go
I can't keep my eyes on the road
I'm awake and want it, I'ma take something
Let it be you, you, you, you

But eh, you taste just like New York
Before a storm takes hold
You were raised like you were high and armed
And now I'm alone
But eh, I bust my lips on yours
How sweet, the night is dark enough
We're only seeing stars

You taste just like New York

Boom, boom, boom
What you do, do, do to me
Rippin from the deepest root of me
It's easy for you to see
You got me where you want me
Boom, boom, boom
What you do, do, do to me
Rippin from the deepest root of me
It's easy for you to see
You got me where you want me

Eh, you taste just like New York
Before a storm takes hold
You were raised like you were high and armed
And now I'm alone
But eh, I bust my lips on yours
How sweet, the night is dark enough
We're only seeing stars

You taste just like New York
You taste just like New York
You taste just like New York
And now I'm alone
But eh, I bust my lips on yours
How sweet, the night is dark enough
We're only seeing stars
