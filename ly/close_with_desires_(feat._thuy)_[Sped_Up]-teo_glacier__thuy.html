		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We go back and forth like it's nothing (nothing)
Seems that we already hit the summit (already hit the summit)
I could try to chase you up but I already tried (I already tried)
Ain't worth my time (ain't worth my time)
Ain't worth my

Time and time again, babe (time and time again)
Messages on read, babe (messages on read)
I can't read between the lines, the lines (I can't read between)
And I gave you my best, babe (I gave you my best)
You still up and left, babe (you still up and left)
Maybe right person wrong timing (timing)

But I can't be stuck on someone
Who don't love me no more (love me no more)
Trust me no more (trust me no more)
Want me no more (want me no more)
And I can't be falling for somebody
New if I can't (new if I can't)
Forget about the past (forget about), forget what we had
I can't be stuck on someone
Who don't love me no more (love me no more)
Trust me no more (trust me no more)
Want me no more (want me no more)
And I can't be falling for somebody
New if I can't (new if I can't)
Forget about the past (forget about), forget what we had

Through all the good we had
I think we moved too fast
So many scars from my past
Covered up
You never noticed
Feel these walls closing
Hard to fix it when you broken
And I know you tired of chasing
Save your breath your wasting it

Time and time again, babe
Messages on read, babe
You can't read between the lines, the lines
I know you gave your best, babe (know you gave)
And I still up and left, babe
Maybe right person wrong timing (wrong time)

But I can't be stuck on someone who (I can't be)
Don't love me no more (love me no)
Trust me no more (trust me no)
Want me no more (want me no)
And I can't be falling for somebody (falling for)
New if I can't (no, if I)
Forget about the past (forget about it), forget what we had (forget about it)
I can't be stuck on someone (stuck on someone)
Who don't love me no more (love me no more)
Trust me no more (trust me no, want me no) (trust me no)
Want me no more (want me no)
And I can't be falling for somebody (I can't be falling)
New if I can't (new if I can't)
Forget about the past (forget about), forget what we had
