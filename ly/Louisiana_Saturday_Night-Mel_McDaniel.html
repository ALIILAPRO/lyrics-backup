		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, you get down the fiddle and you get down the bow
Kick off your shoes and you throw 'em on the floor
Dance in the kitchen 'til the morning light
Louisiana Saturday night

Waiting in the front yard sitting on a log
A single shot rifle and a one eyed dog
Yonder come my kinfolk, in the moonlight
Louisiana Saturday night

Well, you get down the fiddle and you get down the bow
Kick off your shoes and you throw 'em on the floor
Dance in the kitchen 'til the morning light
Louisiana Saturday night

My brother Bill and my other brother Jack
Belly full of beer and a possum in a sack
Fifteen kids in the front porch light
Louisiana Saturday night

When the kinfolk leave and the kids get fed 
Me and my woman, gonna slip off to bed
Have a little fun when we turn out the lights
Louisiana Saturday night

Well, you get down the fiddle and you get down the bow
Kick off your shoes and you throw 'em on the floor
Dance in the kitchen 'til the morning light
Louisiana Saturday night

Yeah, you get down the fiddle and you get down the bow
Kick off your shoes and you throw 'em on the floor
Dance in the kitchen 'til the morning light
Louisiana Saturday night

Get down the fiddle and you get down the bow
Kick off your shoes and you throw 'em on the floor
Dance in the kitchen 'til the morning light
Louisiana Saturday night
