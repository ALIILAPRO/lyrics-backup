		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You found someone new, before me
And you didn't try nearly as hard
And maybe that's the problem
I don't know how to take it away from you
Without giving someone else my heart

All I do
Is get over you
And I'm still so bad at it

I let myself want you
I let myself try
I let myself fall back into your eyes
I let myself want you
I let myself hope
I let myself feel things I know that you don't

You're not mine anymore
But I'm still a little bit yours

Maybe if I'd said
The right things
It never woulda gone this way
And maybe that's the problem
'Cause I still kinda think it was up to me
When I never coulda made you stay

All I do
Is get over you
And I'm still so bad at it

I let myself want you
I let myself try
I let myself fall back into your eyes
I let myself want you
I let myself hope
I let myself feel things I know that you don't

You're not mine anymore
But I'm still a little bit yours
You're not mine anymore
But I'm still a little bit yours

All I do
Is get over you
But I'm still so bad at it

We outgrew
The love we knew
But I still wish I had it

I let myself want you
I let myself try (I let myself try)
I let myself fall back into your eyes (I fall back into your eyes)
I let myself want you
I let myself hope
I let myself feel things I know that you don't (I know that you don't)

You're not mine anymore (anymore, anymore, anymore)
But I'm still a little bit yours (little bit, bit, little bit yours)
You're not mine anymore (anymore, anymore, anymore)
But I'm still a little bit yours
