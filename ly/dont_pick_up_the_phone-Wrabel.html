		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh yeah, this listening
Yeah

Don't pick up the phone
I'm gonna keep calling
It's four in the morning
And I'm gonna keep calling

Just let it ring
I'll keep talking
That's enough for me
Be too much for me to know you're listening

There's so much to say
So I'm gonna keep calling
This is all a mistake
But I'm gonna keep calling

Just let it ring
And I'll keep talking
That's enough for me
It'd be too much for me to know you're listening

It's been two years, five months, five days
And I'm gonna keep calling
Don't pick up the phone
Don't pick up
