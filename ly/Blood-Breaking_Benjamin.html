		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every endless word
I have nothing here
Sick of all that was
Tired of all that is
Every hated love
I have broken in
Sick of fucking up
Tired of falling in

And all that I regret
I have before, I will again

It's over now
(Are you running away?)
I come apart
(As I light the way)
It's in my blood
(Let the sky fall down!)
I won't let go
(My oblivion!)

Counting every breath
I am my own fear
Nothing ever was
Nothing ever is
Every halo lost
I am worn within
Nothing left to harm
Nothing left to live

And all that I regret
I have before, I will again

It's over now
(Are you running away?)
I come apart
(As I light the way)
It's in my blood
(Let the sky fall down!)
I won't let go
(My oblivion!)

Face the monster i've become
(And fight, hate will not become!)
In the ground we rise to burn
(Maybe your life will let me love!)
Forgive my heart

It's over now
I come apart
It's in my blood (let the sky fall down!)
I won't let go (my oblivion!)
