		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who knew?
Who knew you had that side to you?
You knew
You knew that I'd die for you
Who knew?
Who knew? What a bitter truth
Thought it was us and now it's me and you

You moved the clouds so I could see through
Dark days, you led the way, pulling me through
It didn't matter, you sung out of tune

I said, "Do you know I'm in love with you?"
She said, "That's nice", it ripped me in two
She left, oh my God, what's a guy to do
Spread her wings just like the angels do

Who knew?
Who knew you had that side to you?
You knew
You knew that I'd die for you
Who knew?
Who knew? What a bitter truth
Thought it was us and now it's me and you

Who knew?
Who knew you had that side to you?
You knew
You knew that I'd die for you
Who knew?
Who knew? What a bitter truth
Thought it was us and now it's me and you
