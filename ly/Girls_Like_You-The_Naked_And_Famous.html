		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Run, whirlwind run
Further and further away
Into the sun
In, 20 minutes
Everyone will remember you when you're gone
And your heart, is a stone
Buried underneath your pretty clothes
Don't you know people write songs about girls like you?

What will you do when something stops you?
What will you say to the world?
What will you be when it all comes crashing
Down on you little girl?
What would you do if you lost your beauty?
How would you deal with the light?
How would you feel if nobody chased you?
What if it happened tonight?

How would you cope it the world decided to
Make you suffer for all that you were?
How could you dance if no-one was watching
And you couldn't even care if they were?
What would you do if you couldn't even feel?
Not even pitiful pain
How would you deal if the indecision
Eating away at the days?

Don't you know people write songs about girls like you?
About girls like you
About girl like you
Don't you know people write songs about girls like you?
About girls like you
About girl like you

Everything you say is higher
All the things that make you lighter
Everything you say is higher
See it in the grey you crier

Don't you know people write songs about girls like you?
About girls like you
About girl like you
Everything you say is higher
All the things that make you lighter
Everything you say is higher
See it in the grey you crier
