		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When we look back at it all as I know we will 
You and me, wide eyed 
I wonder
Will we really remember how it feels to be this alive? 

And I know we have to go 
I realize we only get to stay so long 
Always have to go back to real lives 
Where we belong 

And I know we have to go 
I realize we only get to stay so long 
Always have to go back to real lives 
Where we belong 

When we think back to all this and I'm sure we will 
Me and you, here and now 
Will we forget the way it really is 
Why it feels like this and how? 

And we always have to go I realize 
We always have to say goodbye 
Always have to go back to real lives 

But realizations are the reason why 
We want to live another life 
We want to feel another time 
Another time

Yeah another time 

To feel another time

When we look back at it all as I know we will 
You and me, wide eyed 
I wonder
Will we really remember how it feels to be this alive? 

And I know we have to go 
I realize we always have to turn away 
Always have to go back to real lives 

But real lives are why we stay 
For another dream 
Another day 
For another world 
Another way 
For another way 

One last time before it's over 
One last time before the end 
One last time before it's time to go again
