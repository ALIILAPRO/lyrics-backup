		  Sick thoughts

We might just be unkind
But that's just how we're designed
You got me so fucked up
Think about you most of the time
Then I think about losing my mind

I wanna stop before we're caught
But don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
And I got things that I want
But you're on top
On top
On top

We're psychos forever
In diamonds and leather
We'll never get better

That's why I got these
Sick thoughts, sick thoughts
Sick thoughts, sick thoughts
Look what you've caused
You've got 'em too

Wanna know what's makin' you numb
Beautiful when the damage is done
You know me, I won't budge
I'm about to start taking what's mine
Then I'll think about losing my mind

I wanna stop before we're caught
But don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
And I got things that I want
But you're on top
On top
On top

We're psychos forever
In diamonds and leather
We'll never get surrender

That's why I got these
Sick thoughts, sick thoughts (sick thoughts)
Look what you've caused (you caused)
You treat me rough (me rough)
You've got 'em too

Sick thoughts, sick thoughts (sick thoughts)
Sick thoughts, sick thoughts (sick thoughts)
Look what you've caused (you caused)
You've got 'em too

Hour after midnight
Think about you
Don't know how it started
Always bleeds through

Feel you runnin' on my mind
Creepin' up and down my spine
No one thinks like you and I, I

'Cause I got these s-i-c-k thoughts, you got 'em
Look at me, look what you started
I'm so sick and broken-hearted, hearted
Cause we got these s-i-c-k thoughts, we want 'em
Look at us, look what we started
I'm so sick and broken hearted

Sick thoughts, sick thoughts (sick thoughts)
Look what you've caused (you caused)
You treat me rough (me rough)
You've got 'em too

Sick thoughts, sick thoughts (sick thoughts)
Sick thoughts, sick thoughts (sick thoughts)
Look what you've caused (you caused)
You've got 'em too

Sick thoughts
