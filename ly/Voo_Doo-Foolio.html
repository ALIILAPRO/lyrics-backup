		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, 6
Fuck it, now I'm playin' with that woo

My grandma do voodoo (Magic)
Fuck it, now I'm playin' with that woo
(Playin' with that woo)
We just chopped the head off a goose
6 the livin' proof (Ayy)
You can't walk a mile in my shoes
You can't even hang with my crew

I'm just tryna get bigger (Bigger)
Stayin' independent, gettin' richer
(Richer)
I can't fall victim to the system (On bro)
Lil' Foolio a killer
Homies tryna knock me out the picture (Fuck)
I'm just tryna take care of my sisters
And provide for my brothers
If you playin' cut then I'ma cut you (Cut)
I'm heartless, I'll never love you
(Fuck you) never been a buster
If you ain't from the 6, nigga, fuck you
(Fuck you)
If Kojack got a problem, I'll bust 'em
(Kojack) i been thuggin' since a 6 (6)
I swear I ain't never had shit (Bitch)
Snotty nosed bad ass jit
Mama short up on the rent (Damn)
She ain't never know I had a stick (Nah)
Zion, bro, I can't imagine this
Nigga knock, I jumped the fence (Ayy)
Really I'm a bitch if I flinch
In that dirty water like I'm Flint
(Michigan) with Josin in the tint
Shot a nigga, why would I repent? (Fuck it)
Pull up on the two, I was hit
I don't wanna get killed (Ayy)
But fuck it, bro, I'm really in the field
(Really in the field)
'Bout my respect, I'll do a hundred years
(Ayy) it is what it is (Uh)
Everything gotta stay concealed (Ayy)
I'ma ride 'til there really
Ain't no wheels (Ayy)
And if I sign this deal (What?)
I'ma still ride with my steel (Ayy)
Never gave a fuck about a mil' (Nah)
Judge handin' out them years (Fuck)
God can't even feel how I feel (Nah)
I can't even drill how I drill (On bro)
Niggas hate me in my hood (Why?)
I'm thinkin' that everything was good
(Fuck 'em)
Guessin' I got shit misunderstood
(Fuck 'em) wish a nigga would (Why?)
Refused to be the nigga sayin' I could
I just want to make it out the hood (On bro)

My grandma do voodoo (Magic)
Fuck it, now I'm playin' with that woo
(Playin' with that woo)
We just chopped the head off a goose
6 the livin' proof (Ayy)
You can't walk a mile in my shoes
You can't even hang with my crew
My grandma do voodoo (Ay)
Fuck it, now I'm playin' with that woo
(Ayy)
We just chopped the head off a goose (Ayy)
6 the livin' proof (Uh)
You can't walk a mile in my shoes (Ayy)
You can't even hang with my crew
My grandma do voodoo (Ayy)
Fuck it, now I'm playin' with that woo
(Playin' with that woo)
We just chopped the head off a goose
6 the livin' proof (Uh)
You can't walk a mile in my shoes
You can't even gang with my crew
