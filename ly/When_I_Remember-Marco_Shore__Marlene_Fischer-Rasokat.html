		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Laying here
In my bed
Thinking about
Everything that I had
And the way how I feel
Can't be explained
Drown in my emotions
I hate feeling this way
Oh oh
Please get me out of here
Oh oh
And take away this fear
Oh oh
Can't do this any longer
Pull me out of this water
When I remember
What you have done for me
I know I'm blessed
Looking back on all these memories
Hold on to the good times
And know there's more to come to me
Thankful for you
Thankful for you
Sometimes I feel
Misunderstood
Still knowing
All your plans for me are good
Maybe these moments
Will never end
Remember
I can't fall deeper than in your hands
Oh oh
Please get me out of here
Oh oh
And take away this fear
Oh oh
Can't do this any longer
Pull me out of this water
When I remember
What you have done for me
I know I'm blessed
Looking back on all these memories
Hold on to the good times
And know there's more to come to me
Thankful for you
Thankful for you
