		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you're waiting and you're so damn nervous
I know you're hoping that I could explain this
Look in my eyes
I will try and show you

I know you think I am the devil in this
I know you're thinking that you don't deserve this
Look in my eyes

What did you want me to be
When I see you falling
How did you want me to see
Your life and your lying
How did you want me to feel
When I see you trying
Trying so hard to fit in
To the world you are buying

I know you're thinking that you should have been there
I know you're thinking that no one cares
Just look in my eyes
I will try and show you

I know you think I should be saying I'm sorry
You arent the person I thought you'd be
Just look in my eyes

What did you want me to be
When I see you falling
How did you want me to see
Your life and your lying
How did you want me to feel
When I see you trying
Trying so hard to fit in
To the world you are buying

Just take a look at who you are
Dont blame me for the Hardest part
I told you when the
Rain starts falling it all starts crashing
Down and life will run you right into the ground
Just take a look at who you are
