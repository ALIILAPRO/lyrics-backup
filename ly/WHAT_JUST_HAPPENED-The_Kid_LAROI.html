		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know if we just crossed the line
'Cause I don't even know what just happened
Everything I said last night was lies
'Cause I don't even know what just happened

Two beans, one blunt and a double cup
Then you walked in, I'm in trouble now
I said some things about you and us
I said some things that you shouldn't trust
Yeah, we both know you don't give a fuck
Friends with my girl, but you wanna fuck
What's your excuse? I'ma blame the drugs
I care, I care, I don't care enough

Stop it, but you won't, won't, won't
Love it, 'cause you're cold, cold
Yeah, you don't like bein' 'lone, lonely
You knew what you were doing, you were dead wrong

I don't know if we just crossed the line
'Cause I don't even know what just happened
Everything I said last night was lies
'Cause I don't even know what just happened

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
'Cause I don't even know what just happened

Lost in a dark place, did I call when I was wasted?
And what did I say to you?
Uh, all I remember was how the liquor tasted
Then I woke up in my bed tryna retrace it
Tell me we just talked 'til it's late in the mornin'
I got missed calls, if you rang, I ignored it
I told myself that I did what I was supposed to
Guess it'll only be you that knows the whole truth

Stop it, but you won't, won't, won't
Love it, 'cause you're cold, cold
Yeah, you don't like bein' 'lone, lonely
You knew what you were doing, you were dead wrong

I don't know if we just crossed the line
'Cause I don't even know what just happened
Everything I said last night was lies
'Cause I don't even know what just happened

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
'Cause I don't even know what just happened
