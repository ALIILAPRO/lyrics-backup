		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see you on the blue skies
I need a little sunshine
I fill into your brown eyes
I told you I was your light
No, I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna listen all that much
Is it falling apart?
I don't wanna talk about it
I just wanna hold your hand

Oh you know when you're alone
I am holding on and on and on and on
Oh you know when you're alone
I am holding on and on and on and on
To your soul, your soul

Soul shine
You must've been so tight
Don't cry, I must've been so blind

Oh you know when you're alone
I am holding on and on and on and on
Oh you know when you're alone
I am holding on and on and on and on
To your soul, your soul, your soul, your soul

No, I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna listen all that much
Is it falling apart?
I don't wanna talk about it
I just wanna hold your hand

Oh you know when you're alone
I am holding on and on and on and on
Oh you know when you're alone
I am holding on and on and on and on
To your soul, your soul
To your soul, your soul
To the soul, your soul
To the soul, your soul

No, I don't wanna talk about it
I just wanna hold your hand
