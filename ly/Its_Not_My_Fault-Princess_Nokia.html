		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pow, pow

Yes, I'm God's favorite flavor (taste)
I'm blessed and highly favored
He gave me all the blessings and them blessings turn to paper (money)
That paper turn to money
Got hands that stuck in honey
I'm sexy playboy bunny
I'm shining, yes I'm sunny (hi there)

You don't have a fan for a OnlyFan
But your boyfriend pay me monthly (bling bling)
While you're talking shit he's subscribing it 
Now I got him spanking that monkey (click)
I'm a pretty bitch on some petty shit
So don't try me I'm always hungry (so pretty)
Curvy when I get that munchie (yeah, yeah)
Thick thighs on my money hustle

It's not my fault (it's not my fault)
That I'm that bitch (that I'm that bitch)
So talk that shit (so talk that shit)
Cuz I'm still rich (cuz I'm still rich)
It's not my fault (it's not my fault)
That I'm that bitch (that I'm that bitch)
So talk that shit (so talk that shit)
Cuz I'm still rich (cuz I'm still rich)

I'm a rock star like Mur (woo)
Industry calling I give 'em the curve (hits)
They hang on to me and my every last word (yes please)
I'm sick in the head and I'm very disturbed (haha)
Publishing deal, I get new deal, I eating good meals
My body too real, they worship (uh) real fresh skin
Good peal I buy you steal
You was scared but Gwen Stefani go bananas (that shit is)
Now I pose in front of cameras (b-a-n-a-n-a-s)
That's designer on pajamas, big boother I grab that hammer
My poster is in the slammer
Got that J. Lo glow and glamour (from the block)
When they see me they all clamor (thank you)
They in love-ed they enamored

It's not my fault (it's not my fault)
That I'm that bitch (that I'm that bitch)
So talk that shit (so talk that shit)
Cuz I'm still rich (cuz I'm still rich)
It's not my fault (it's not my fault)
That I'm that bitch (that I'm that bitch)
So talk that shit (so talk that shit)
Cuz I'm still rich (cuz I'm still rich)

Ohh, I did it again like, ohh
I signed a new deal like, ohh (okay)
My publishing real like, ohh (okay)
I own that I'm real like, ohh
I hit it again like, ohh
I say he my friend like, ohh
I giggle again like, ohh (go ahead)
He busting my walls like, ohh

It's not my fault (it's not my fault)
That I'm that bitch (that I'm that bitch)
So talk that shit (so talk that shit)
Cuz I'm still rich (cuz I'm still rich)
It's not my fault (it's not my fault)
That I'm that bitch (that I'm that bitch)
So talk that shit (so talk that shit)
Cuz I'm still rich (cuz I'm still rich)
