		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Damn, that's Surreal right there?

I got all kinds of drugs for when I get lonely, lonely
When I get lonely, lonely (I got all kinds of drugs)
When I get lonely, lonely
I got all kinds of drugs for when I get lonely, lonely
(I got all kinds of drugs)
When I get lonely, lonely
When I get lonely, lonely (I got all kinds of drugs)
Yeah, aye

When I'm low, yeah, she put me up
I'm sellin' shrooms when I'm in the cut
I got a choppa wit' me in the clutch (Yeah)
I'm 'bout to make these niggas give it up (Yeah)
Yellow bone, and she stuck up
I'm like fuck that, drink this nut up
These drugs, they gon' be there for me when you won't
These drugs, they gon' get me higher when you don't
Yeah, bellis in my lungs
Hit a xanny, I'm too high, perkys for the road
Pop a bean, I'm on beast mode
Pink molly for a freak hoe

I got all kinds of drugs for when get lonely, lonely
When I get lonely, lonely (I got all kinds of drugs)
When I get lonely, lonely 
I got all kinds of drugs for when I get lonely, lonely
(I got all kinds of drugs)
When I get lonely, lonely
When I get lonely, lonely (I got all kinds of drugs)

Ay, ay, pray to the deacon, think my demons tryna wake me up
Call me Lil' Kodak, off a jigga when I'm booted up
The stars aligned, now it's my time, you never do enough
I got the drugs, send me the addie, I ain't pullin' up
I get high by myself, I don't need no one else
My bank account on tilt, these rookies like to steal
Mad 'cause I know the deal, life of a outsider
Bitch we up in the hills, all black like bike riders
I pull up wit' the mob, we had to jugg and rob
Trappin' was like a job, now we eat shish kabobs
Sit back and laugh at it, now we the trendin' topic
I know they see me now, like, "Boy, that nigga poppin'"
I call up Yung Bans, pull up in minivans
And if that nigga talkin', we'll pop you and your mans
Bitch I don't fear nobody, I feel like Killa Cam
I'm in a black Coupe, zoomin' like Batman

I got all kinds of drugs for when I get lonely, lonely
When I get lonely, lonely (I got all kinds of drugs)
When I get lonely, lonely
I got all kinds of drugs for when I get lonely, lonely (I got all kinds of drugs)
When I get lonely, lonely
When I get lonely, lonely (I got all kinds of drugs)

Damn, that's Surreal right there?
