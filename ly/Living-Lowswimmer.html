		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No matter how bad it's gotten
I'll remember the mornings right
I'll get the coats and you get the water
Get in the car and drive it a yard and back

Is this good, is it? Get me out
Could we live in separate houses?
That would be nice ‘cus I'm tired of living
But you said, lying
"trust me, like, I'll be fine"

But could you be happy now?
I guess nothing happens now

Drifting at sevens every effort wide
The way we were heading
Not exactly ascеnsion, right?
Everything led you on
So would you be willing to
Kill mе for real this time
Or else we'll be on again, off again
Ross-and-Rachel-ing life

So could you be happy now?
I guess nothing happens now
We could be living now
But we won't admit it out loud
