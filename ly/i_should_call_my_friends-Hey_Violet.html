		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Laughed out loud in the chain smoke
We were so broke (in my apartment)
One more night with the old crew like we used to
(On my stained-ass carpet)
As the Summer fades to an Autumn daze

Cried my tears on your shoulder, but it was over
(Before it started)
'Cause Eli's getting married now
Fiona's sleeping safe and sound
And Jeff found a way downtown
I can't help but wonder why I'm

All alone again with no makeup on
Still the same old mess, still don't give a (hey)
I wish that I could see you now, maybe I'll reach out
All alone again, I should call my friends
(I should call my friends)

Snuck out late to the graveyard, we were so gone
(On cheap Prosecco)
Life goes on and it's alright but in the late night
(I hear their echoes)

Couple kids making dumb mistakes
Burnouts in Casey's car
And I know things have to change
I can't help but wonder why I'm

All alone again with no makeup on
Still the same old mess, still don't give a (hey)
I wish that I could see you now, maybe I'll reach out
All alone again, I should call my friends

Summer always fades away
I never thought we'd drift apart
Even when the seasons change
You know I'll never be too far
Kelli's probably staying out all night dancing in the moonlight 
Somewhere out in NYC
Yeah, everybody found their thing
And then there's me

All alone again with no makeup on (oh, oh)
Still the same old mess, still don't give a (hey-, what?)
I wish that I could see you now, maybe I'll reach out
All alone again, I should call my friends

(I should, I should)
Uh-uh, uh-uhh
(I should, I should)
I should call my friends
I should call my friends
All alone again
I should call my friends
