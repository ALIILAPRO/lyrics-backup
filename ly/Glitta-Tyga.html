		  Wrist game glitta big chain glitta
Motivate my niggas, wake up in the AM and chase that skrilla
Hated by many yeah the city still mine I just state my opinion
They say how you stay skinny but you stay in the kitchen
They say the shit ain't a game but you playing with the digits
Motivate my niggas can't complain, when your chick name Jenner

Wrist game glitta motivate my niggas
Hated by many when these bitches wanna tattoo their name on your dick
And you can't take your bitch nowhere, she so famous
Niggas want more, all I do is motivate 'em
It's all I do, niggas want more, can you blame 'em?
I was just like you

Now my wrist game glitta big chain glitta
Motivate my niggas wake up in the AM and chase that skrilla
Can you taste that feeling? Cream filling in my cake got the cake with the sprinkles
Motivate my niggas, why you hatin' my nigga?
We had no A/C now we laid up chillin' gettin' paid how I'm working motivate my niggas
Wrist game glitta, champagne sipper, lane to lane switcher in that Mulsanne
Had the Wraith for a minute
Exchange for the Bentley more space for the bitches
What's your name?
I came with the realist I left with the same motivate my niggas
And we all gang, just a gang of niggas that all bang
When we come play its like a ball game ballers
Wrist game glitta, call us crazy for the Ben Franks nigga
I'mma Ben Frank flipper for them Ben Franks nigga
I ain't crazy baby, nah I'm insane nigga
I'm kamikaze, comma crazy on a Kawasaki poppin' wheelies I'm money hungry
Just went out to dinner, everything taste funny but these millions

See my wrist game glitta big chain glitta
Motivate my niggas wake up in the AM and chase that skrilla
Can you taste that feeling? Cream filling in my cake got the cake with the sprinkles
Motivate my niggas, why you hatin' my nigga? Yeah we chase that skrilla
Hated by many and the city still mine I just state my opinion

Wrist game glitta huh?
You a snake and you slither huh?
Hot on the plate still sizzle huh?
Wrist game, big chain glitta huh?

Wrist game glitta big chain glitta
Motivate my niggas wake up in the AM and chase that skrilla
Hated by many yeah the city still mine I just state my opinion
They say how you get millions but you stay independent
Hmm, said the shit ain't a game I ain't playing with you niggas

Now my wrist game glitta big chain glitta
Motivate my niggas wake up in the AM and chase that skrilla
Can you taste that feeling? Cream filling in my cake got the cake with the sprinkles
Motivate my niggas why you hatin' my nigga?
We had no A/C now we laid up chillin'
Got fans worldwide got fans on the ceiling

Wrist game glitta huh?
You a snake and you slither huh?
Hot on the plate still sizzle huh?
Wrist game big chain glitta huh?
