		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Great John on the beat by the way

Gettin' high got me stuck in my feels
Still clutchin' the steel
Still tryna separate fake from the real
And they still tellin' me "Chill"
Now I'm sippin' Wock', stopped poppin' them pills
From the bottom, she toppin' me still
I show it, I don't gotta say how I feel

Think I'm racist, all black in the field
Like, "How is he famous still with all the drills?"
Got the juice, I ain't lettin' it spill
I fell back and they mention me still
Whenever we step, it's a hit or a kill
They like, "Sleepy, you trippin', we know that you will"
Uh, bitch, stop tellin' me, "Chill"
Like Danny Glover, I make movies for real, uh
Momma, you good on the bills
And grandma just wanna see that I prevail
Probably mad that I ain't go to Yale
But fuck it, your grandson doin' well
Used to hate that I ain't wear a belt
But I couldn't buy all the drip
Me and bro tryna find us a lick
Shooter Gang, bitch, you know who I'm with
We clutchin', like, "Boy, who you runnin' to get?"
Extra clips, we be doublin' it
Same bitch let me fuck, she was dubbin' and shit
Now she see me, she huggin' and shit
She told me she love me, she buggin' and shit
Baby girl got a man, but she with it, uh
Just give me the digits
And call me when he not around, I can kick it
Said he flexin' that bread, but don't spend it
Don't mean I might buy you a Birkin for business
And baby, you know how I'm livin'
So I can't be trustin' these niggas and women
Can't be trustin' these-, look

Gettin' high, got me stuck in my feels
Still clutchin' the steel
Still tryna separate fake from the real
And they still tellin' me, "Chill"
Now I'm sippin' Wock', stopped poppin' them pills
From the bottom, she toppin' me still
I show it, I don't gotta say how I feel

Yeah (huh)
She already know how I feel (she do)
I take her to one of them places (I do)
He a killer, he got one of them faces
Come with the pussy, I come with the payment
She ain't comin' if she under the ages (nah)
Uh (uh), I call Gino and he come with an Asian (yeah)
I'm off the Perc, yeah, I'm goin' through phases (look)
Nigga, I'm over the standin' ovations (uh)
I want money, not congratulations
You better find somebody else to play with
'Cause the killers runnin' out of patience (bow)
And a nigga like me (a nigga like me)
You'll never see a nigga like me (nah)
I take care of home and I deal with the streets
And I never mix the business with beef (nah)
That's like the number one rule (it is)
I took her, the kids in the middle of coupe
I battle demons in my sleep
I wake up and help them make it to school (huh, yeah)
I wake up and help them make it to school

Gettin' high, got me stuck in my feels
Still clutchin' the steel
Still tryna separate fake from the real
And they still tellin' me, "Chill"
Now I'm sippin' Wock', stopped poppin' them pills
From the bottom, she toppin' me still
I show it, I don't gotta say how I feel
