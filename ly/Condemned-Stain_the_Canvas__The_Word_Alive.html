		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're All Condemned

My total pessimism is pasted to my hand
The only way to get away from it it's fuel and match
I feel like getting psycho
Is this insanity?
How can I wake up from this nightmare if I'm not asleep?

I'm biting my tongue, I'm cutting myself and I cannot feel any urge
We're lying to ourselves, pretending it's fine to be dead, I guess we'll never learn
I'm waiting for a God, who keeps laughing at us all.
Why would you beat a dead horse, 
I've passed the point of no return.

We're all condemned now
Cross my heart and find out if I still bleed
Cause I'm awake but now I'm not alive
This situation's killing me
Hope begun to fade away, I'm locked in chains
And nothing feels the same these days, can't drown my pain
We're all condemned now
Shout it out loud
We're All Condemned
We're All Condemned

Twinkle twinkle little star,
Take your knife and cross my heart
Cross my heart,
I can't feel you if you don't
I can feel it in my bones
So just hurt me, choke me, hurt me 'til I'm gone

I'm biting my tongue, I'm cutting myself and I cannot feel any urge
Leave me with my hunted brain until this shit will end and then give me a call

We're all condemned now
Cross my heart and find out if I still bleed
cause I'm awake but now I'm not alive
This situation's killing me
Hope begun to fade away, I'm locked in chains
And nothing feels the same these days, can't drown my pain
We're all condemned now
Shout it out loud
We're All Condemned

We can play pretend
Everything will be alright
While all you ever loved is crumbling right before your eyes
We can play pretend
Everything will be alright
But deep inside we're dying to live as we used to when it was fine
My dreams are rent asunder
Can't go anywhere but under
That's why I spare to sleep
But the reality scares me more than any fantasy
Cross my fucking heart
My heart

I'm burying myself 
Because everything else is already dead 
A cold place is waiting for us
I'm turning to dust
This ain't a nightmare so I'll never wake up

Fucked up, everything's just fucked up, fucked up
We're all condemned
Hope begun to fade away, I'm locked in chains
And nothing feels the same these days, can't drown my pain
We're all condemned now
We're all condemned now
