		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  4 in the morning
And my roommate's still a-snoring
So I take a walk out on the Boulevard

The wind above me
Seems to push and pull and shove me
But it shows me all the places I could fly

I want to be something
Before I die
I feel it burning me inside

I want to be something
I don't know why
I want to know that at least I tried

I see so clearly
That the odds are stacked against me
And that nobody else believes in me at all

I'm all alone here
And I have to face my own fear
I have no choice but to keep on keeping on

I want to be something
Before I die
I feel it burning me inside, whoa

I want to be something
I don't know why
I want to know that at least I tried

And if my dreams all come true someday, true someday
I won't forget how I feel today, I feel today
I'm blown away

I wanna be somethin'
I wanna be somethin'
I wanna be somethin'
I wanna be somethin'
I wanna be somethin'
I wanna be somethin'
I wanna be somethin'
I wanna be somethin'

Here I am, here I am

I want to be something
Before I die
I feel it burning me inside, whoa

I want to be something
I want to feel something
I want to know that at least I tried
