		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I tell myself
I wanna see you on your knees
Begging for forgiveness please
Oh, I swear, that I'll do better
Give me a couple months
and I'll get my shit together
But I
Don't like to watch you cry
Blame it on my water sign
I lie
I'd crawl back in a minute
You can call me easy
If you'd like
We've tried everything
Strangers, enemies
Sick of melodies
I write about you
We've tried no contact
I still want you back
Can we iron out the creases
I look past your broken pieces
I don't think so
And I just know
That we're out of
Time
You come so close
I want you but don't
What if you've grown
And I
Would come right back
If you asked me to
But I don't wanna be that girl
That you know will forgive you
I tell myself
Maybe they won't give me shit
For crying in their arms
And then forgiving him
Oh, I
I just need a minute
To have a little fun without 'em in my business
But they
Don't like to watch me cry
I ignored the warnings signs
I lie
I'd crawl back in a minute
You can call me easy if you like
We've tried everything
Strangers, enemies
Sick of melodies
I write about you
We've tried no contact
I still want you back
Can we iron out the creases
I look past your broken pieces
I don't think so
And I just know
That we're out of
Time
You come so close
I want you but don't
What if you've grown
And I
Would come right back
If you asked me to
But I don't wanna be that girl
That you know will forgive you
I don't think so
And I just know
That we're out of
Time
You come so close
I want you but don't
What if you've grown
And I
Would come right back
If you asked me to
But I don't wanna be that girl
That you know will forgive you
I can't be that girl
I won't be that girl
