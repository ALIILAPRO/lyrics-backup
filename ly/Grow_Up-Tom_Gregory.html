		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was out 'til four and got up at 12
Don’t remember much
But my heads gonna melt
Please don’t call me
Please don’t call me

I’m not moving out I won’t pay no rent
Got no mortgage plan or a loan to spend
You don’t know me
You don’t know me

And I wish I could wait and buy more time
Cus I’m a little lost, I’m a little lost in this life

You know I never wanna grow up
You know I never wanna grow up, grow up
You know I never wanna grow

I can eat all day and not put on weight
Wear my hair messed up and I still look great
It’s beyond me
It’s beyond me

I can hang around and just sleep all day
Cus I got no money or a life to pay
You don’t own me
You don’t own me

And I wish I could wait and buy more time
Cus I’m a little lost I’m a little lost in this life

You know I never wanna grow up
You know I never wanna grow up, grow up
You know I never wanna grow up
You know I never wanna grow up, grow up

And I wish I could wait and buy more time
Cus I’m a little lost, I’m a little lost in this life
And I wish I could wait and buy more time
Cus I’m a little lost, I’m a little lost in this life

You know I never wanna grow up
You know I never wanna grow up
You know I never wanna grow up
You know I never wanna grow up

You know I never wanna grow up
