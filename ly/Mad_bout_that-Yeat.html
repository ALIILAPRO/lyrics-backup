		  (Keep it up, Sharkboy)
Ayy, huh? Ayy, yeah (ayy)
Ooh, ooh, ayy, ayy, yeah, yeah (ayy)

I was sorry 'bout that, bitch, but now I'm mad 'bout that
I was sorry 'bout that, bitch, but now I'm mad 'bout that (ayy, ayy)
Bitch, I'm mad 'bout that (ayy)
This bitch mistake me for a broke, bitch, I'm mad 'bout that (ayy, ayy)
Bitch, I'm mad 'bout that (yeah)
Why'd you try to steal my flow? Bitch, I'm mad 'bout that (yeah)

Bitch, I got Chrome Hearts socks on my feet
Bitch, I got diamonds, they hit when I speak
Flossin' the diamonds, I ain't brushin' my teeth, yeah
Yeah, I heard that bitch wanna have sex with me
I call my bizzy Balenci 'cause B
I heard they wake up and listen to me (ayy, yeah)
SRT, bitch, I got widebody (keep it up, Sharkboy)
I bought a Tonka truck 'cause my money got big body
Yeah, huh, fuck what you love, fuck what you say 'bout it
Talk to the doves, I'm high as them, probably
Yeah, bitch, I just went, ran it up, bitch, I went bonkers
I feel like a lil' ol' kid in this big ol' Tonkers
Yeah, my bitch like a old, old bitch, she put on the chompers (eat it up, eat it up)
I got a whole lot of kids, 'bout to put all they ass in some Pampers
I rock my clothes one time, I don't got no hampers
I pay people to make me money, I don't do answers
I don't be rappin', I just be talkin', this shit banter
If he shit talkin', light him up like he's a lantern

(Keep it up, Sharkboy)
Ayy, huh? Ayy, yeah (ayy)
Ooh, ooh, ayy, ayy, yeah, yeah (ayy)

I was sorry 'bout that, bitch, but now I'm mad 'bout that
I was sorry 'bout that, bitch, but now I'm mad 'bout that (ayy, ayy)
Bitch, I'm mad 'bout that (ayy)
This bitch mistake me for a broke, bitch, I'm mad 'bout that (ayy, ayy)
Bitch, I'm mad 'bout that (yeah)
Why'd you try to steal my flow? Bitch, I'm mad 'bout that (yeah)

Whoa
Ooh
