		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe it's my issues playin' tricks on me
Do I like attention more than what I need?
Don't wanna make you doubt
But I hate when you make me feel like this
Calling her your friend but friends don't talk like that
Tell me that I'm jealous and I overreact
I'm childish but I'm honest, I still love you like I promised
Where it feels like you've forgotten

Why won't you surprise me?
Fight for me?
Why are you so sure that I'll be yours tomorrow?
Cry for me
Tell me you'll die for me
Show me you'll be sad if I'm not yours tomorrow

Spill your darkest secrets, things that you don't show
Before when you get drunk, you used to call and let me know
Say what we got is special
You would never, ever let me go

If you're still in love
Just as much

Why can't you surprise me?
Fight for me?
Why are you so sure that I'll be yours tomorrow?
Cry for me
Tell me you'll die for me
Show me you'll be sad if I'm not yours tomorrow

Hm, hm
Hm, hm
Show me you'll be sad if I'm not yours tomorrow
