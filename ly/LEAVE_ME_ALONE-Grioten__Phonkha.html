		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitch I gave you my heart now I'm heartless
I don't wanna fuck with a bitch that ain't toxic
I don't give a fuck, I run that shit up
All these motherfucking bands for a dance get topless
Flexing on these motherfucking hoes because they don't me lone
Better pull up with a stick if you gon run the fucking poll
I be walking through the halls while you're tipping on your toe
While you're battling your demons, ima leave you fucking cold
Bitch I started here, now I'm there, you changed me
I don't really trust no bitch, don't face me
Look what you've done, I can't fucking rest in piece
Now I now I got a goth bitch looking at me
Two knives, switchblade get the fuck out my face
I don't want to be with you, bitch give me a break
Write you down on my death note, when you give me your name
Yeah bitch I'm gonna be the best, there ain't nothing to tame bitch
Woah, like woah, bitch leave me alone
Woah, like woah, you're blowing up my phone
Damn, all I see is repetition
PR FUNK made this shit a religion
Came up from the bottom bitch you know I'm on a mission
Fucking tired of these bitchass labels tryna pitch in
No friends in the industry it's all about the business
Two faces motherfuckers boutta end up in a sentence
Writing all these bars cause these bitches fucking messing with my feelings
Bitch I gave you my heart now I'm heartless
I don't wanna fuck with a bitch that ain't toxic
I don't give a fuck, I run that shit up
All these motherfucking bands for a dance get topless
Flexing on these motherfucking hoes because they don't me lone
Better pull up with a stick if you gon run the fucking poll
I be walking through the halls while you're tipping on your toe
While you're battling your demons, ima leave you fucking cold
Woah, like woah, bitch leave me alone
Woah, like woah, you're blowing up my phone
I'm heartless
