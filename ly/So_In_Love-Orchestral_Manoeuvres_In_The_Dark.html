		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Talk to me, don't lie to me
Save your breath
Don't look at me, don't smile at me
Just close your eyes

I was so impressed by you
I was running blind
I would fall for every trick
Every twist of mind

Heaven is cold
Without any soul
It's hard to believe
I was so in love with you

Don't say your prayers, don't build your hopes
Just walk away
Don't phone me up, don't call around
Don't waste your time

You were so in awe of me
You were so divine
You would do just anything
To still be mine

Heaven is cold
Without any soul
It's hard to believe
I was so in love with you

All the things you said to me
I was so obsessed
You were always talking, talking
God, I did my best

Heaven is cold
Without any soul
It's hard to believe
I was so in love with you

(I was so in love with you) Heaven is cold
Without any soul
It's hard to believe
I was so in love with you

(I was so in love with you) Heaven is cold
Without any soul
It's hard to believe
I was so in love with you

I was so in love, I was so in love, I was so in love with you
So in love with you
