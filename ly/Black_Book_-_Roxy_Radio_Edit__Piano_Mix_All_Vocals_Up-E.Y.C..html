		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey baby I've been thinking about us   'Cause lately seems like   Something's on your mind   But darlin' in me you can trust   Sometimes the words are hard to find   But I got to tell you I saw you with another   Not just any man but he was my friend   And now I know why you   Wouldn't look me in the eye   So when I tell you this don't be surprised     Today I look you out my black book   I'm not a fool to see how you were treating me   I took you out my black book   We had it going on but now the feeling's gone   I took you out my black book   Black book bye, bye baby   I took you out my black book     So baby don't try to change my views   Because I saw the two of you but that's okay   I just turned the page on you   'Cause that's what you made me do   You've been lying sneaking   You've been cheating all this time   I don't need you girl 'cause   A real woman I will find   Who won't play these games   Games, games, games, games   So when I tell you this   Don't be surprised     Today I took you out my black book   I'm not a fool to see how you were treating me   I took you out my black book   We had it going on but now the feeling's gone   I took you out my black book   Black book bye, bye baby   I took you out my black book    You've been lying sneaking   (Lying sneaking cheating on me all this time)   You've been cheating on me all this time   (Baby don't you know you disappoint a guy)   I don't need you girl 'cause a   Real woman I will find   (Lying sneaking cheating on me all this time)   Who won't play the games   Games, games, games, games   (Real woman who won't play no games of mine)   So when I tell you this don't be surprised    Today I took you out my black book   I'm not a fool to see how you were treating me   I took you out my black book   We had it going on but now the feeling's gone   I took you out my black book   Black book bye, bye baby   I took you out my black book
