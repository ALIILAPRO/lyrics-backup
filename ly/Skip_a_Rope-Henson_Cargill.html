		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Skip a rope, skip a rope
Oh, listen to the children while they play
Now ain't it kinda funny What the children say
Skip a rope

Daddy hates mommy, mommy hates dad
Last night you shoulda heard 
The fight they had
Gave little sister another bad dream
She woke us all up with a terrible scream

Skip a rope, skip a rope
Oh, listen to the children while they play
Now ain't it kinda funny What the children say?
Skip a rope

Cheat on your taxes, don't be a fool
Now what was that they said about a golden rule?
Never mind the rules just play to win
And hate your neighbor for the shade of his skin

Skip a rope, skip a rope
Oh, listen to the children while they play
Now ain't it kinda funny What the children say?
Skip a rope

Stab 'em in the back that's the name of the game
And mommy and daddy are who's to blame

Skip a rope, skip a rope
Just listen to your children while they play
It's really not very funny what the children say
Skip a rope, skip a rope
Skip a rope, skip a rope
