		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Circles, keep runnin' in circles
Feels like every dream you've ever had just slowly fades away
Hopeless, some days feels so hopeless
Just another day, another struggle, 'nother win to chase

Yeah, I get that sometimes life can bring you down
And you try to win the fight, but you don't know how

Whenever you're fallin' and you don't know where you're goin'
Even if your wings are broken, soon enough, you'll fly again
When everything's failin' and your eyes just won't stop rainin'
Even if your fire's out, yeah, soon enough, you'll burn again

You know in the ups and downs, I'll be there
When the lights go out, I'll be there
In the coldest town, I'll be there for you
In the highs and lows, I'll be there
When you lose control, I'll be there
It'll be alright, yeah, I'll be there for you (I'll be there for you)

Donde te encontrés al borde
Y tocando fondo, hacéte amigo de la soledad
Vive, intenta y sonríe
Es un paso, avanza y tiempo pa' dejar lo malo atrás

Es hoy, conexión, con vos mismo, con el interior
Trabajar en tu mejor versión y poner a volar el corazón

Whenever you're fallin' and you don't know where you're goin'
Even if your wings are broken, soon enough, you'll fly again
When everything's failin' and your eyes just won't stop rainin'
Even if your fire's out, yeah, soon enough, you'll burn again

You know in the ups and downs, I'll be there
When the lights go out, I'll be there
In the coldest town, I'll be there for you (I'll be there)
In the highs and lows, I'll be there
When you lose control, I'll be there
It'll be alright, yeah, I'll be there for you

In the highs and lows, I'll be there
When you lose control
It'll be alright, I'll be there for you
