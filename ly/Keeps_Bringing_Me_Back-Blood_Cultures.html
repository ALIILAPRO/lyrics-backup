		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It keeps bringing me back
It keeps bringing me back
It keeps bringing me back
It keeps bringing me back
Back to life
 
The night, she calls my name
A whisper heard inside a shallow grave
Digging through the dirt, I hear her say
"Let's turn back time to when the dawn was day"
 
This is the beginning of the end of us
Each and every memory has turned to dust
Give up everything we had to have some more
Falling from the heavens to be at your door
 
It keeps bringing me back
It keeps bringing me back
It keeps bringing me back
It keeps bringing me back
Back to life
 
The moon, it lights our way
There is no turning back from this mistake
We've both been here before, but somethings changed
We're cutting to the bone, but feel no pain
 
This is the beginning of the end of us
Each and every memory has turned to dust
Give up everything we had to have some more
Falling from the heavens to be at your door
 
It keeps bringing me back
It keeps bringing me back
It keeps bringing me back
It keeps bringing me back
Back to life
 
It keeps bringing me back
