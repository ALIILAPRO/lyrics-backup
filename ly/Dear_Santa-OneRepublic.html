		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dear Santa, make my wish come true
There's only one thing on my list

It's that time of the year
When I miss you the most
Sitting next to the fire, the mistletoe
I should be feeling the cheer
While I'm holding you close
Singing carols and drinking coco

All the snow outside is falling
I'm here waiting for you, darlin'
It's all I want this year

Dear Santa, make my wish come true
There's only one thing on my list
To have my baby home for Christmas
Dear Santa, there's nothing I won't do
I don't need a lot, just one wish
Bring my baby home for Christmas

Yeah, baby home for Christmas
Bring my baby home for Christmas

Wrapped the presents with bows
Put the lights on the tree
Should be jolly in here when sleigh bells ring
So I'll dream and I'll hope
Wishing by Christmas Eve
We'll be happy and you're here with me

All the snow outside is fallin'
I'm here waiting for you, darlin'
It's all I want this year

Dear Santa, make my wish come true
There's only one thing on my list
I want my baby home for Christmas
Dear Santa, there's nothing I won't do
I don't need a lot, just one wish
Bring my baby home for Christmas

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Bring my baby home for Christmas

Santa, all I'm asking for's my darling here with me
It's all I want this year

Dear Santa, make my wish come true
There's only one thing on my list
To have my baby home for Christmas
Dear Santa, there's nothing I won't do
I don't need a lot, just one wish
Bring my baby home for Christmas

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah
Bring my baby home for Christmas
Bring my baby home for Christmas, oh-ohh
Bring my baby home for Christmas

Dear Santa, make my wish come true
Bring my baby home for Christmas
Bring my baby home for Christmas
