		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  People, they come, and people, they go
When the leaves change and the colors they show
Can you hold on through the seasons?
Through the seasons, oh
Through every high and through every low
A beautiful lie, it never gets old
Can you hold on through the seasons?
Through the seasons, oh

My fault, that's the truth, I won't lie
Fucked it all up, now I'm tryna make the wrongs right
I hate that I hurt you, oh-oh-oh
Talk shit, yeah, we get outta line
But I get a little warmer when I'm inside
White flag, can we truce? Oh-oh-oh-oh

Whatever weather, if it rain or shine
Whether it's pain, pleasure, good and hard times
We might go 'round and 'round, but I won't back down (oh)

People, they come, and people, they go
When the leaves change and the colors they show
Can you hold on through the seasons?
Through the seasons, oh
Through every high and through every low
A beautiful lie, it never gets old
Can you hold on through the seasons?
Through the seasons, oh

You slipped a couple times, but it's fine
'Cause if I started pointin' fingers, you would see mine
I don't wanna judge you, oh-oh-oh-oh
You see from the side when I'm blind
You're the one I'm callin' when I need a lifeline
But I don't wanna lose you, oh-oh-oh

Whatever weather, if it rain or shine
Whether it's pain, pleasure, good and hard times
We might go 'round and 'round, but I won't back down (oh)

People, they come, and people, they go
When the leaves change and the colors they show
Can you hold on through the seasons?
Through the seasons, oh
Through every high and through every low
A beautiful lie, it never gets old
Can you hold on through the seasons?
Through the seasons, oh

Whatever weather, if it rain or shine
Whether it's pain, pleasure, good and hard times
We might go 'round and 'round, but I won't back down 
(Through seasons, oh)
Whatever weather, if it rain or shine
Whether it's pain, pleasure, good and hard times
We might go 'round and 'round, but I won't back down 
(Through seasons, oh)
