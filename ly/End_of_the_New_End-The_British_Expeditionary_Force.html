		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel lost at home because you're still gone, oh I'm sure you'll be fine
But the sun's about to rise and I'm out searching on a bike at a quarter to five
cnd the morning will break me if you're still unfound, unfound, unfound, unfound
Oh I'm sure you'll be fine, oh I'm sure you'll be fine
Just ran out of credit, or just ran out that's it
Oh I'm sure you'll be soon, oh I'm sure you'll be soon

I'll be sure that you'll be soon
I'll be sure till the morning after
I'll be sure that you'll be fine
Oh I'm sure you'll be fine, oh I'm sure you'll be fine

You're in my blood and in my lungs. I've got you under, under my skin
I try to swim out the mess I'm in, I try to swim but I'm wading further in
What it would be a sight to see if you were seen coming through the door
Like the first few minutes of sun is following a week of heavy downpour
