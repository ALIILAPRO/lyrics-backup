		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What was I thinking?
All this rage, it's the end of the world
Spreading my hatred, I must sound insane 
To every boy and every girl

Colors are the thing that make the world better
I've been seeing things in black and white
If we work together we can live forever
If we do it right tonight

Look at our oceans, the whales have gone away
Corporations ran amok
Look at our planet, now just shades of grey
No one seems to give a fuck

And colors are the thing that make the world better
I've been seeing things in black and white
If we work together we can live forever
If we do it right tonight

'Cause colors are the thing that make the world better
I've been seeing things in black and white
And if we work together we can live forever
If we do it right tonight

'Cause fucking once again we'll call
We'll fucking get rich on you mothertrucking
And one last time, you're going to fucking die
