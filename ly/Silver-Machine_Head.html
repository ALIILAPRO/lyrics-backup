		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yes  I hold some keys of gold 
A cigarette  a silver bullet 
Angels crying day and night 
The world is our stage 
Look inside and try and find the part of me that tore 
I wish I knew what I got through behind 

Take my hand across this land 
Escape this  all the hell inside 
Create this man to make my stand 
And break this hardened shell inside 

I see the man in me 
The lines along my face are drawn in 
I believe reflections bleed 
The sorrows of the souls 
Let me know the hurt that shows 
And wish it all away 
Cause now you'll see all this pain in me collide

Take my hand across this land 
Escape this all the hell inside 
Create this man to make my stand 
And break this hardened shell in

I see the walls around me fall around me 
And everything's alright 
I see the god among me fall among me 
And everything's beside 
I see the walls around you, tie and bound you 
Drown 'cause you're so cold, cold, cold 
Take my hand across this land 
Escape this all the hell inside 
Create this man to make my stand 
And break this hardened shell inside 
So take my hand and cross this land 
And break this hardned shell in, hardened shell in, hardened shell inside
