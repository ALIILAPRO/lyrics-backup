		<p>
		  I don't care what you say 
you can give it away 

Your money don't mean much to me. 
I've been out on my own 
gonna got it alone now 

'Cause that's the way it's got to be. 
Ev'rybody tells me how I can beat the odds for now. 
Well 
I've been standing by the fire 
but I iust can't feel the heat. 

Heartbeat - I'm looking for a heartbeat 

Heartbeat - I'm looking for a heartbeat 
beating like mine. 

Looking at me 
it's easy to see 

You think you know iust how I feel. 
If you do to me wrong and it won't take me long 

Before my restless heart will heal. 
I'm looking for a love 
love like mine 

They tell me it's so hard to find 

But I can feel it in the rhythm of the heartbeat in the street. 

Heartbeat - I'm looking for a heartbeat 

Heartbeat - I'm looking for a heartbeat 

Beating like mine 
beating like mine. 
Tell me what you feel now without the heartbeat 

Tell me is it real now without the heartbeat? 

Heartbeat - I'm looking for a heartbeat. (12x
