		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here we go again
Can’t help falling
Though I said I would not return
I never learn

Past and the future tense
Fade in your presence
Til nothing else exists
There’s no end

I just need some time
Outside of my mind
Maybe that’s the key
Feeling nothing’s ecstasy
It’s ecstasy

I just need some peace
Some sense of release
Take me there tonight
Into paradise
Paradise


What do you do when you know
Just how far it can go
All these heights we push to climb
To the sublime

But can’t keep on pretending
This feeling has no ending
In this world where we are gods
Forever Lost

I just need some time
Outside of my mind
Maybe that’s the key
Feeling nothing’s ecstasy
It’s ecstasy

I just need some peace
Some sense of release
Take me there tonight
Into paradise
Paradise

I can’t let go…
The feeling that you give me
Only when you’re with me
Its pure tranquility
You lift me

Caught within your rapture
Nothing seems to matter
Only you’ve the answer
To my love yeah

I just need some time
Outside of my mind
Maybe that’s the key
Feeling nothing’s ecstasy
It’s ecstasy

I just need some peace
Some sense of release
Take me there tonight
Into paradise
Paradise
