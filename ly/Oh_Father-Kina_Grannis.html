		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The count down
We're up against the road
Oh father, oh father
I haver never known
A darkness so immense
Oh father, oh father

A mountain high
Tell me how to go
Oh father, oh father
Are we falling now
No victory to show
Oh father, oh father

All along
I have been trying to hear you in me
All along
You will be the one that I'll become

Once more now
Its an hour and ahead
Oh father, oh father
Put the pedal down
Legs turning in the light
Oh father, oh my father

We are the ones now
We're flying through the trees
Oh father, oh my father
Watch me somehow
Lay your safety over me
Oh father, oh father
Oh father, oh father
Oh father, oh father
Oh father, oh father

All along
I have been trying to hear you in me
All along
You will be the one that I'll become

I never wanted anything
Apart from what you've given me
[x5]

All along
I have been trying to hear you in me
All along
You will be the one that I'll become
