		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here I come with the new style kicking
Just can't help it 'cause it's so damn wicked
Insane in the brain with a mind like Cujo
Ya better run 'cause I'm about to get loco
Feelin' this way is an everyday thing
See ya talkin' shit, but you don't know me
Ya look around; ya see we got the most juice

[Chorus]
Watch these fuckers jump when I get loose
I get loose
Watch these fuckers jump when I get loose
I get loose
Watch these fuckers jump

I guess it's okay; I guess not
Talkin' all that shit like a big shot
Come by the masses or come by the few
Ain't got nothin' but love for this crew
And I can see that's why you're so jealous
And I can see that's not your excuse
And I can see that's why you're so jealous

[Chorus]

Are you down with phat sound, bitch?
