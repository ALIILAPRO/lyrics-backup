		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  noodles and butter noodles and butter you are my favorite treat
noodles and butter there is no other nothing else that I wanna eat
I don't like 

chocolate cake like others do
or lemon drops or pepermint chew
or little cakes or sugar lumps (no no no no no)
no candy bars or whipping cream
no lollypops or tangerines
no root beer floats or bubblegum (no no no no no no no no no)
I just want

bubblegum or licorice whips
or anything dipped in a whip cream dip
none of that seems good to me (no no no no no)
no cocont pie or bluberry tart
or anything from the pastry cart
the only thing that I really want is
noodley and buttery as well

you can keep your sugar sweets
make yourself a tower of trashy treats
noodles and butter you're the only one
you're the only one 
the only one I need
I don't like
