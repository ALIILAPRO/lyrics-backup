		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How could you?
How could you?
How could you?
How could you?

Our ice cream's not melted yet
Why don't you concede?
And go turn the heating up, baby
By a couple of degrees
You wouldn't even be in my kitchen
If you didn't like the heat
You think you're playing it cool but you're tripping
You got to let yourself breathe
Just because you want to go on denying yourself
You just microdose
When I long to see how high we can get

When will it ever be a good time?
When is it ever gonna be the right time?
How dare you sentence me
To a lifetime without dancing
When my body's built for feeling
And keeping good time and keeping good time

I'm totally in love with you
I'm head over heels
I know, I know I shouldn't really be dancing
At a time like this
Oh but I can be a selfish mademoiselle
You gave me the name, I'm wearing it well
I shouldn't be able to just block out all of the pain (all of the pain)
And everyone cry and not feel the same

You better make the time to make this up to me
I'm waiting in line to get you on your feet
I'll be happy making the movie, if you wanted that
When I'm already lost in the groove

When will it ever be a good time?
When is it ever gonna be the right time?
How dare you sentence me
To a lifetime without dancing
When I'm already lost in the groove (I'm already lost in the groove)

I'm long gone, long gone
I'm long gone, life's too short
I'm long gone, long gone
I'm long gone, life's too short
I'm long gone, long gone
I'm long gone, life's too short
I'm long gone, long gone
I'm long gone, life's too short
I'm long gone, long gone
I'm long gone
