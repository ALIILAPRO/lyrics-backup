		  Mississippi Queen
You know what I mean
Mississippi Queen
She taught me everything

Went down around Vicksburg
Around Louisiana way
Where lived the Cajun Lady
Aboard the Mississippi Queen

You know she was a dancer
She moved better on wine

While the rest of them dudes were gettin' their kicks
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was gettin' mine

Mississippi Queen
If you know what I mean
Mississippi Queen
She taught me everything

This lady she asked me
If I would be her man
You know that I told her
I'd do what I can

To keep her lookin' pretty
Buy her dresses that shine

While the rest of them dudes were makin' their friends
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was loosin' mine

You know she was a dancer
She moved better on wine

While the rest of them dudes were gettin' their kicks
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was gettin' mine

Yeah, Mississippi Queen
