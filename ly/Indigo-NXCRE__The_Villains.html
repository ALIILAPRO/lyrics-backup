		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say you don't know why
You want to be with me
Yeah you said it's just the times
When we're far from
And I say time is now
Now
And I say it's time now
To go far
Far
Silence consumes the hearts
Of the people who stay in the dark
We find shelter in ourselves
When we're far from
And I say time is now
Now
And I say it's time now
To go far
Far
I'm losing my way can you help me escape
I'm finding a way to be fine with it
I'm losing my way can you help me escape
I'm finding a way to be fine with it
I'm losing the time but nothing feels the same
Same
And I say it's time now
To go far
Far
Wait for me
Baby wait for me
I'll go away with you
Away with you
Wait for me
Baby wait for me
I'll go away with you
Away with you
