		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Face the dead)

Spellbound in a seance with the silence
To summon the end (to summon the end)
Obliterated by a single touch
My breath returns to dust
No reprieve, darkness unleashed
And every night I feel the specter lurking in my dreams
It's not safe to sleep
There's nothing left for me
(Nothing left)

Feed, watch claws tear flesh 
The jaws of revenge (the jaws of revenge)
The vengeance of an ancient martyr's blood
I feel it tracking us
Bones like branches snap
The forest will feed on our depravity
No absolution (absolution)

Spellbound in a seance with the silence
To summon the end (to summon the end)
Obliterated by a single touch
My breath returns to dust
No reprieve, darkness unleashed
And every night I feel the specter lurking in my dreams
It's not safe to sleep
There's nothing left for me

Listen to the rising tide of fever from my tongue
As you have come to steal the vessel
But the curse won't be undone
I promise once you hear this silence
Nothing ever sounds the same
I am flowing through your veins

I am motion
I am motion
I am retribution

I converge on the altar
Draw me under the skin
Wake in the morning nightmare
Cave in, there's nothing left to breathe
Escape from the temple
Shroud me in sacrifice
Lost in the scarlet moonlight
And I know there's nothing left for me
