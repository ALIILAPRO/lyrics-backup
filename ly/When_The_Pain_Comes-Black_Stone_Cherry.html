		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who set the world on fire?
When did we get so violent?
The situation's hit frustration today
Sometimes I feel so helpless
And then my thoughts get selfish
But my collection of perceptions have changed

I'm not broken, I just notice
Sometimes we take it too far
To find who we are
When the pain comes (pain comes)
I will not be afraid
I am here to stay
Even when the pain comes (pain comes)

When did it get so cold in here?
That no one knows us solely
I feel divided, undecided, insane
Truth is that I'm still fighting
With thunder comes the lightning
Just know the weather does get better someday

You can't judge me, please just trust me

Sometimes we take it too far
To find who we are
When the pain comes (pain comes)
I will not be afraid
I am here to stay
Even when the pain comes (pain comes)

Sometimes we take it too far
To find who we are
When the pain comes (pain comes)
I will not be afraid
I am here to stay
Even when the pain comes (pain comes)

Sometimes we take it too far
'Cause that who we are
Yeah, when the pain comes (pain comes)
I will not be afraid
'Cause I am here to stay
When the pain comes
