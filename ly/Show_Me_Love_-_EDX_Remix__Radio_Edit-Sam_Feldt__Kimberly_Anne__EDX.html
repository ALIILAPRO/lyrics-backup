		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heartbreaks and promises
I've had more than my share
I'm tired of giving my love
And getting nowhere, nowhere

It's been so long since I touched a wanting hand
I can't put my love on the line that I hope you'll understand

So baby if you want me
You've got to show me love
Words are so easy to say 
But you've got to show me love
But you've got to show me love

I'm tired of getting caught up
In those one night affairs
What I need is somebody
Who will always be there

Don't you promise me the world
All that I've already heard
This time around for me baby
Actions speak louder than words

So if you're looking for devotion
Talk to me
Come with your heart in your hands
'Cause my love is guaranteed

So baby if you want me
You've got to show me love
Words are so easy to say 
But you've got to show me love

Words are so easy to say 
But you've got to show me love
