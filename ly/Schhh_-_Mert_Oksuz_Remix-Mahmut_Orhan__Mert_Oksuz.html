		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Our shadows blending
My hand is shaking
When touching your face
I feel your pain
Your fire's burning and my heart is melting
This song
 
Is not about us, is not about us
Another man to forgive, another story to live
Is not about us, is not about us
Another man to forget, another love to regret

'Cause it's not about us
Oh, no no no, oh, no no no
Oh, oh
Oh, no no no, oh, no no no

Our shadows blending
My hand is shaking
When touching your face
I feel your pain
Your fire's burning and my heart is melting
This song

Is not about us, is not about us
Another man to forgive, another story to live
Is not about us, is not about us
Another man to forget, another love to regret

'Cause it's not about us
Oh, no no no, oh, no no no
Oh, oh
Oh, no no no, oh, no no no
