		  Hello earth
Hello earth

With just one hand held up high
I can blot you out
Out of sight

Peek-a-boo,
Peek-a-boo, little earth
With just my heart and my mind
I can be driving
Driving home
And you asleep
On the seat

I get out of my car
Step into the night
And look up at the sky
And there's something bright
Traveling fast
Look at it go
Look at it go

Hello earth
Hello earth

Watching storms
Start to form
Over America
Can't do anything
Just watch them swing
With the wind out to sea

All you sailors
(Get out of the waves, get out of the water)
All life-savers,
(Get out of the waves, get out of the water)
All you cruisers,
(Get out of the waves, get out of the water)
All you fishermen
Head for home

Go to sleep, little earth
I was there at the birth
Out of the cloudburst
The head of the tempest
Murderer
Murder of calm
Why did I go? 
Why did I go? 

Tiefer, tiefer
Irgendwo in der tiefe
Gibt es ein licht

Go to sleep little earth
