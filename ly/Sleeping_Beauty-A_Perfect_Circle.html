		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Delusional
I believe I can cure it all for you, dear
Coax or trick or drive or
Drag the demons from you
Make it right for you sleeping beauty
Truly thought
I can magically heal you

You're far beyond a visible sign of your awakening
Failing miserably to rescue

Sleeping beauty

Drunk on ego
Truly thought I could make it right
If I kissed you one more time to
Help you face the nightmare
But you're far too poisoned for me
Such a fool to think that I can wake you from your slumber
That I could actually heal you

Sleeping beauty
Poisoned and hopeless
You're far beyond a visible sign of your awakening
Failing miserably to find a way to comfort you

Far beyond a visible sign of your awakening
Hiding from some poisoned memory

Poisoned and hopeless
Sleeping beauty
