		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shake it up, Shake it down; 
Move it in move it round, disco lady
Move it in move it out 
Move in it and about, disco lady

Shake it up, shake it down
Move it in, move it around, disco lady

Hey sexy lady,
Said I like the way you move your thang,
Lord have mercy girl,
You dance so fine, and you're right on time
Girl you ought to be on T.V. On soul train
When you get the groove,
There ain't no stoppin', 
Just can't help it, but I'm finger poppin'

Shake it up, shake it down; 
Move it in, move it round, disco lady
Move it in, move it out; 
Move it in, round about, disco lady

Shake it baby, shake it, 
Baby shake your thang; (One time)
Shake it baby, shake it, 
Baby shake your thang,

You got me groovin, (Wanna hustle baby)
I feel like movin, (Wanna hustle baby)
You got me movin, (Wanna hustle baby)
Can't sit still I'm groovin (Wanna hustle baby)
(I like that funky stuff)

Shake it up, shake it down, 
Move it in, move it round, disco lady
Move it in, move it out,
Shove it in round about, disco lady

Hey sexy lady, (Shake it up, shake it)
Girl, you drive me crazy, (Shake it up, shake)
You dance so fine and your right on time (Shake it up, shake)
Girl you drive me right out of my mind (Shake it up, shake)
If it wasn't for the girl sittin' next to me, (Shake it up, shake)
I'd jump right up and outta my safety seat (Shake it up, shake)
You got me hypnotized, soul mesmorized (Shake it up, shake)
Girl, your movin' me girl your groovin' me (Shake it up, shake)

(Shake it up, shake)
(Shake it up, shake it down)

Shake it on down, 
Move it up, move it down to the ground

(Shake it up, shake)
(Shake it up, shake)
(Shake it up, shake)
(Shake it up, shake)
(Shake it up, shake)

Shake it up, shake it down; 
Move it in, move it round, disco lady
Move it in, move it out; 
Shove it in, shove it out; disco lady

Hey, you've got me soulset in this discothek 
Girl, your movin' me girl your groovin' me 

Move it in, move it out; 
Shove it in round about, disco lady

Shake it baby
