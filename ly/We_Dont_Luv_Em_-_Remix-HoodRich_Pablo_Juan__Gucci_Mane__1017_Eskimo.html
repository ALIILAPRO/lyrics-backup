		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, yeah
MONY POWR RSPT, nigga it's a money set
You know what I'm saying? Everybody getting money, nigga
(Danny Wolf) yeah, Pablo Juan

The money go where I go
Smoking on gelato
Foreign car swerving, pothole
Bad bitch, she from Chicago
She freaky, she gon' bust it
She thick as fuck, I'm lusting
I got her from my cousin
So what? 'Cause we don't love 'em
Fuck that, I wanna hit from the back
Backwood smoking, it's fat
Dressing like I got a sack
I pull up, jump out the back
Bad bitch and her ass fat
Four door coupe, it got a hatch
On the Xans, I might crash that

Car got gadgets, my bitches got asses
Expensive glasses like I'm teaching class
Too fresh to take out the trash
Fresh to death, where is my casket?
I always stay with assassins
I'm always laced with the fashion
Teacher gave me an F, that's fantastic
VS diamonds on me, look how they flashing
Rocking Saint Laurent, I guess I be dabbing
I got the Louis V, Supreme collabing
Bought a mansion way away like a cabin
Taking all my swag, I feel like your daddy
You a beggar, I'm a hustler
I'm the dealer, you the customer
Catch up, little nigga, I'm mustard
Smoking the Backwoods, they coming from Russia
I ain't never really trust you
Knew I should've never trust you
You ain't real, you a buster
These niggas was always sus
These niggas start snitching for nothing
These niggas wanna live by the gun
Guess what, you gon' get what you want
El Patr√≥n, nigga, I want a ton

The money go where I go
Smoking on gelato
Foreign car swerving, pothole
Bad bitch, she from Chicago
She freaky, she gon' bust it
She thick as fuck, I'm lusting
I got her from my cousin
So what? 'Cause we don't love 'em
Fuck that, I wanna hit from the back
Backwood smoking, it's fat
Dressing like I got a sack
I pull up, jump out the back
Bad bitch and her ass fat
Four door coupe, it got a hatch
On the Xans, I might crash that

If come ride it's tinted
Don't test the water chilly
My pinky a quarter ticket
Had to grind smart to get it
Limited 'sclusive edition
They waitin' in line to get it
Danny your time, I did it
I didn't get a dime, a visit
I been had the sauce, I'm drippin'
'Fore I had a pot to piss in
My car just lost the ceiling
My girl just lost her feeling
Gucci getting richer than Richie
Bitches say Gucci saddity
She just did her ass and her titties
Well skeet on her face 'cause she pretty
I tell her, go'n, like the road runner
Might stash your phone number
Ho get the wrong number
I'm stacking all winter
I'm stuntin' all summer
And I need a grown woman
'Cause I got grown money, Wop

The money go where I go
Smoking on gelato
Foreign car swerving, pothole
Bad bitch, she from Chicago
She freaky, she gon' bust it
She thick as fuck, I'm lusting
I got her from my cousin
So what? 'cause we don't love 'em
Fuck that, I wanna hit from the back
Backwood smoking, it's fat
Dressing like I got a sack
I pull up, jump out the back
Bad bitch and her ass fat
Four door coupe, it got a hatch
On the Xans, I might crash that
