		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wherever I stay
There's a feeling of so far away
I got no home town
I never put roots down

I bet you feel safe
Keeping your life in a cage
While I take my chances
But always collapses

I really don't know what it needs
To put my smile on
To turn the lights on
It always seems I'm falling down
They think I'm crazy
They think I'm crazy

There's a child in me,
Still hiding behind the old tree
But aren't we all hiding
'Till the moment we're dying
And maybe I'm free
But freedom just means that I'm lost
It feels like I'm driving
Without ever arriving

I really don't know what it needs
To put my smile on
It always seems I'm falling down
They think I'm crazy
They think I'm crazy

Wherever I stay
There a feeling I'm so far away
I got no home town
I used to run so fast
