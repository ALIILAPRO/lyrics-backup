		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a light that shines on Persephone,
Always a fire in her eyes,
And the last time that I went to her
I could tell things weren't right. 

I just don't care to see your years go wasting,
There's no longer magic in your eyes. 

In your time, you could outshine everybody else around,
But your off-stage ways might be a bore -
You take a bow, you take a fall.

I came to be here in the footlights,
To live with you through every song,
And your face displays a peaceful field.
I can't believe the curtain has to fall. 

Now I know your years were never wasted,
Tonight I saw the magic in your eyes.
