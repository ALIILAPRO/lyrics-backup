		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is gonna hurt but I blame myself first
'Cause I ignored the truth
Drunk off that love, fuck my head up
There's no forgetting you

You've awoken me, but you're choking me
I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me, and now honestly, I got nothing left

I loved you dangerously
More than the air that I breathe
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me
Baby, I loved you dangerously
Mm, mm
I loved you dangerously

Usually, I hold the power with both my hands
Tied behind my back
Look at how things change, 'cause now you're the train
And I'm tied to the track

You've awoken me, but you're choking me
I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me, and now honestly, I got nothing left

'Cause I loved you dangerously
More than the air that I breathe
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me
Baby, I loved you dangerously

You took me down, down, down, down
And kissed my lips with goodbye
I see it now, now, now, now
It was a matter of time
You know I know, there's only one place this could lead
But you are the fire, I'm gasoline

I love you, I love you, I love you
I loved you dangerously
Ooh, more than the air that I breathe
Oh, now, knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me
Oh, oh baby, I loved you dangerously

Mm, mm
Ooh, I loved you dangerously
Ooh, ooh, I loved you dangerously
