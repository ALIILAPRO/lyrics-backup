		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They ain't takin' over, over
They ain't takin' over, 'ver

Lost track of the times when I felt the pain
But every time that I reach for the sky
Felt a rush of blood in my veins
And the wheels turned inside my brain
They ain't takin' over, over
I'm fighting the lows that creep in my mind
I try to remember that life was a ride
Down one minute, next one you're high
Like a wave crashing into the night
They ain't takin' over

I know I've been here before
But not going down in this storm
So long, farewell to my darkest days
Listen to me now as I wash away my fears

They ain't takin' over
They ain't takin' over
They ain't takin over me
Lock away my demons, demons
Chains off and now I'm dreamin'
Wash away my fears they ain't takin' over
They ain't takin' over
They ain't takin over me
Lock away my demons, demons
Chains off and now I'm dreamin'

I'm out of the box, don't fit in the lane
There's too many people that countin' the day
Who doubt me every step of the way
I'm so tired of the shit that they say
They ain't takin' over, over
Yeah, I do this for me, not ever for them
I'll never be sorry, won't ever pretend
'Cause every word I write is the truth
Can you say the same thing about you?
They ain't takin' over

I know I've been here before
But not going down in this storm
So long, farewell to my darkest days
Listen to me now as I wash away my fears

They ain't takin' over
They ain't takin' over
They ain't takin over me
Lock away my demons, demons
Chains off and now I'm dreamin'
Wash away my fears they ain't takin' over
They ain't takin' over
They ain't takin over me
Lock away my demons, demons

Uh, beartrap don't act like you know me
You don't even know my real name
All I want's serenity
All you want is fortune and fame
And the code to the gate
Which I don't even like to give away
'Cause I've been goin' through some shit
I never thought I would i stay in the Hills
I don't even go to Hollywood
Toxic people in my life, man
I probably should cut 'em all off
Better off if they was gone for good
(Gone for good) as I wash away
As I wash away my fears

They ain't takin' over
They ain't takin' over
They ain't takin over me
Lock away my demons, demons
Chains off and now I'm dreamin'
Wash away my fears (My fears)
They ain't takin' over
They ain't takin' over
They ain't takin over me
Lock away my demons, demons
Chains off and now I'm dreamin'

Locked away my demons, demons
Chains off and now I'm dreamin'
