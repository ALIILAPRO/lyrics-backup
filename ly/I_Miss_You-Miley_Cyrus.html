		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sha la la la la, sha la la la la
You used to call me your angel
Said I was sent straight down from heaven
And you'd hold me close in your arms
I loved the way you felt so strong

I never wanted you to leave
I wanted you to stay here holdin' me

I miss you, I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear every once in a while
And even though it's different now
You're still here somehow

My heart won't let you go
And I need you to know
I miss you, sha la la la la
I miss you

You used to call me your dreamer
And now I'm livin' out my dream
Oh, how I wish you could see
Everything that's happenin' for me

I'm thinkin' back on the past
It's true that time is flyin' by too fast

I miss you, I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear every once in a while
And even though it's different now
You're still here somehow

My heart won't let you go
And I need you to know
I miss you, sha la la la la
I miss you

I know you're in a better place yeah
But I wish that I could see your face, oh
I know you're where you need to be
Even though it's not here with me

I miss you, I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear every once in a while
And even though it's different now
You're still here somehow

My heart won't let you go
And I need you to know
I miss you, sha la la la la

I miss you, I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear every once in a while
And even though it's different now
You're still here somehow

My heart won't let you go
And I need you to know
I miss you, sha la la la la
I miss you (I miss you)
