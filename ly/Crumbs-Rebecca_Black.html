		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So cherry chaotic, the taste of losing control
I'm chasing down the drip, sip down the rabbit hole
Now I'm staring down the metal barrel of your gun
I surrender on a bender, you're the drug

You're bad and I deserve it
When will I ever learn?
I get off on getting hurt

You can make a mess
And I'll pick up the crumbs
And there's nothing you could do to make me love you less
At your worst, you're still my best
In my body, out of my head
In my ribs and under my chest, mess
And I'll pick up the crumbs
And there's nothing you could do to make me love you less
At your worst, you're still my best
In my body, out of my head
In my ribs and under my chest

Drain me out slowly
I'll thank, thank you for your time
Drink me unholy
Chain me, chain me for my crimes

Drip wax and let it burn, ah
When will I ever learn?
I get off on getting hurt

You can make a mess
And I'll pick up the crumbs
And there's nothing you could do to make me love you less
At your worst, you're still my best
In my body, out of my head
In my ribs and under my chest, mess
And I'll pick up the crumbs
And there's nothing you could do to make me love you less
At your worst, you're still my best
In my body, out of my head
In my ribs and under my chest

You're bad and I deserve
You're bad and I deserve
Get off on getting hurt, mm
You're bad and I deserve

Bad and I
Bad and I
Bad and I
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad

You can make a mess
And there's nothing you could do
In my ribs and under my chest

You're bad and I deserve
You're bad and I deserve
Get off on getting hurt
You're bad and I deserve
You're bad and I deserve
You're bad and I deserve
Get off on getting hurt
You're bad and I deserve
