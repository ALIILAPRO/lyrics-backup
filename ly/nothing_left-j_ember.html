		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Blood down by the river
Under crystal clear skies
I asked you for forgiveness
Oh, but I didn't know why

Holding hands with the Devil
Walking down an empty road
Holding hands with the Saviour
Walking home all alone

I thought I saw you in the mirror
I had your voice as the wind blew by
It told me there ain't nothing left
Nothing left for you, nothing left for me
It told me there ain't nothing left
Nothing left to do, nothing left for free

Tears drip, bones rattled
Oh, the horizon glides by
I'm gearing up for battle
The battle of my mind

Seen it all but the answer
Still searching for a sign
Seen it all but disaster
But disaster comes to find

I thought I saw you in the mirror
I had your voice as the wind blew by
It told me there ain't nothing left
Nothing left for you, nothing left for me
It told me there ain't nothing left
Nothing left to do, nothing left for free

It told me there ain't nothing left
Nothing left for you, nothing left for me
It told me there ain't nothing left
Nothing left to do, nothing left for free
