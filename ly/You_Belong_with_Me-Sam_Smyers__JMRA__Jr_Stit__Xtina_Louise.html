		  You Belong With Me Lyrics

You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset She's going off about something that you said 'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do

I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like And she'll never know your story like I do

Cause she wears short skirts I wear T-shirts She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
 Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one Who understands you Been here all along So, why can't you see?
 You belong with me You belong with me

You belong with
You belong with
You belong with me

You belong with
You belong with
You belong with me


Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself Hey, isn't this easy?

And you've got a smile That can light up this whole town I haven't seen it in a while Since she brought you down
 You say you're fine, I know you better than that Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?

Cause she wears high heels I wear sneakers She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one Who understands you Been here all along So, why can't you see? You belong with me

Oh, I remember you driving to my house In the middle of the night I'm the one that makes you laugh When you know you're 'bout to cry
 I know your favorite songs And you tell me 'bout your dreams Think I know where you belong Think I know it's with me

You belong with
You belong with
You belong with me

You belong with
You belong with
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor All this time how could you not know, baby? You belong with me You belong with me
