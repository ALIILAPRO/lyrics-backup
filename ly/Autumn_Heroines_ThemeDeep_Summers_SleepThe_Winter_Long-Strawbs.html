		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  July the fourth in the market town 
Farmers have come for miles around 
Bringing their wives and children. 

A farmer stands with his youngest son 
Watching their sheep driven from the pen 
The slaughterhouse is waiting. 

Look they're turning back 
They're frightened 
Dogs are snapping at their heels 
Jumping on each other's backs 
Hear their squeals. 

The young boy stands looking quite dismayed 
How can they know they're just animals 
Come pull yourself together. 

The farmer tells him to look inside 
Row after row of raw carcasses 
Their blood runs in the gutters. 

Listen to their silly bleating 
Farmer beats them with his stick 
Milling by the open door 
Don't be sick. 

The young boy 
Takes a look around 
See people watching blankly 
And he pities them 
For they too 
Look like sheep 
And he tells himself 
When he grows up 
When he becomes a farmer 
He will just plant seeds of love 
He will just plant seeds of love 
He will just plant seeds of love 
And he will harvest peace
