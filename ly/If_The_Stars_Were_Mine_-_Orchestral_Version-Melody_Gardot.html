		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If the stars were mine
I'd give them all to you
I'd pluck them down right from the sky
And leave it only blue
I would never let the sun forget to shine upon your face
So when others would have rain clouds you'd have only sunny days
If the stars were mine
I'd tell you what I'd do
I'd put the stars right in a jar and give them all to you

If the birds were mine
I'd tell them when to sing
I'd make them sing a sonnet when your telephone would ring
I would put them there inside the square, whenever you went out
So there'd always be sweet music whenever you would walk about
If the birds were mine
I'd tell you what I'd do
I'd teach the birds such lovely words and make 'em sing for you
I'd teach the birds such lovely words and make 'em sing for you

If the world was mine
I'd paint it gold and green
I'd make the oceans orange for a brilliant color scheme
I would color all the mountains, make the sky forever blue
So the world would be a painting and I'd live inside with you
If the world was mine
I'd tell you what I'd do
I'd wrap the world in ribbons and then give it all to you
I'd teach the birds such lovely words and make 'em sing for you
I'd put those stars right in a jar and
Give 'em all to you

(Make it over for the new king)
(Make it over for the new king)
