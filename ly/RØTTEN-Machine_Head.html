		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My mouth is cracked and dry
The words are choking by
My teeth are gritting at the rage I'm feeling
My stomach tied in knots
Jaw clenched and muscles taut
About to explode inside, the anger building

I've sat with gun in hand
Barrel to temple, can't understand
Bleeding an open sore
These wounds I can't ignore
I am the misbegotten
Let this horror be forgotten
Everything is rotten to the core
Everything is rotten to the core
Everything is rotten to the

Black blood red pill
Razor and scar
Love, cut, hate, kill
This is a war

I stare into the black, anxiety attack
My heart is racing as my throat's constricting
With every cut and scrape
My skin it palpitates
Lying awake I feel the terror grip me

This nightmare never ends
Suffer my demons, weather the bends
Drowning in misery and negativity
Walk shores of the downtrodden
Anthems to the misbegotten
Everything is rotten to the core
Everything is rotten to the core
Everything is rotten to the

Black blood red pill
Razor and scar
Love, cut, hate, kill
This is a war, war

Powerless life, endless
Infected, dejected

The lying liars say their spineless vile hypocrisies
The burning pyres blaze their timeless animosity
Will you stand beside me
And fight to change the world?

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Everything is rotten to the core
Everything is rotten
Anthems to the misbegotten

Everything is rotten to the core
Everything is rotten to the core
Everything is rotten to the core
Everything is rotten to the core
Everything is rotten

(Powerless)
Everything is rotten to the core
(Life endless)
Everything is rotten to the core
(Infected)
Everything is rotten to the core
(Dejected)
Everything is rotten to the core
(Life endless)
Everything is rotten to the core
(Infected)
