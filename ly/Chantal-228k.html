		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There ain't no beast up in the east 
West side ain't nothing to leave 
Watching down your cold new state 
Like no one's causing new mistakes

I got something for ya 
It ain't no chantal goya

Make it go like it's ok
And no one gives a god damn play 
Falling down for something new 
Isnâ€™t no kind of sad issue

I got something for ya 
Take me to your best side 
And I'm just soooooooo 
In your soul
And I'm just soooooo 
In your soul

And holding tight to something lose 
It gives no time for something true 
It ain't no kind of sad excuse 
For breaking down upon the rules 
I got something for ya
It ain't no chantal goya

Embracing lines
As if it was that easy
I ain't got the sound of the Cudi

I got something for ya 
(I got something for ya) 
And nobody is in the rest 
I ain't got no interest...

And I'm just soooooo 
In your (?)
And I'm just soooooo 
In your (?)
And I'm just soooooo 
In your (?)
And I'm just soooooo 
In your (?)

I got something for ya 
I I got something for ya 
I got something for ya 
I got something for ya 
I got something for ya 
I I I got something for ya 
It ain't no chantal goya
