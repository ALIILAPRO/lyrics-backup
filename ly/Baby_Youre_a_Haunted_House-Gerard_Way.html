		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, you're a haunted house
Better find another superstition
We're gonna stay in love somehow
'Cause, baby, you're a haunted house now

And your heart will stay forever
When your last remains are few
In the dark, we dance together
And I'd like to be waiting with you

Oh, Baby, you're a haunted house
Better find another superstition
We're gonna stay in love somehow
'Cause, baby, you're a haunted house now

And the nights, they last forever
And days are always making you blue
In the dark, we laugh together
'Cause the misery's funny to you

Oh, Baby, you're a haunted house
Better find another superstition
We're gonna stay in love somehow
'Cause, baby, you're a haunted house now

I'll be the only one who likes the things you do
I'll be the ghost inside your head when we are through
Sometimes you scare me, but I come around to you
I'll say hello, hello, (hello)
And I'll find a way to scare you too

Baby, you're a haunted house
Better find another superstition
We're gonna stay in love somehow
'Cause, baby, you're a haunted house now

Oh, baby, you're a haunted house
Better find another superstition
You better go and take a bow
'Cause, baby, you're a haunted house
Baby, you're a haunted house
Baby, you're a haunted house, now
