		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go
 
Candy Pop, you're making my heart stop
Addicted to your sugar with the cherry on my top, oh
Candy Pop, you're making my heart stop
Addicted to your sugar, you're the cherry on my top, oh
 
Holy moly mama
Are you sweating in the sauna
Do you listen to your parents
Do you listen to Nirvana
On vacation, the Bahamas
Do you sympathize with trauma
You can simplify your life
And masturbate with the piranhas, go
 
Candy Pop, you're making my heart stop
Addicted to your sugar, you're the cherry on my top, oh
Candy Pop, you're making my heart stop
Addicted to your sugar, you're the cherry on my top, oh
 
Holy moly Ally
Are you sweating in the valley
Do you study astrology
Do you tend to dilly dally
Grab a drink at tender alley
Drop a bomb in Southern Cali
I will skip the introduction
And see you at the finale, go
 
You and me baby, sitting in the tree
K-i-ss baby -ing
You and me baby, sitting in the tree
K-i-ss baby -ing-g-g
 
Candy Pop, you're making my heart stop
Addicted to the sugar, you're the cherry on my top, oh
Candy Pop, you're making my heart stop
Addicted to the sugar, you're the cherry on my top, oh
 
Addicted to your sugar, you're the cherry on my top
Girl
Addicted to your sugar, you're the cherry on my top
Girl
 
Candy Pop
