		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Molly, jaw locking I can't feel shit
I been popping pills all year, yeah
She been popping pussy like a pill, yeah
I say fuck the block, I'm in the hills with the shit
I'm still livin' hood, but you know a nigga rich
I be lowkey, but you know I'm with the shits
I put binaries on all my new sticks

All my hand guns, huh, huh, came with switches
My opps ain't on nun', yeah, yeah, they all some bitches
C-O-D, U-A-V, I got the drop on all them bitches
I'm on hots, I'm with thots when I'm in yo' city
Blacked out, Opiumed out, full Rick
Diamonds everywhere, yeah, this a full kit
I'm all in her, yeah, yeah, this a full bitch
I know she can tell, I been going through it
Yeah, I been going through it
The only way I express myself is through my music

Please don't push me to the edge
Yeah, I'm 'bout to lose it
I'm 'bout to lose it
I'm 'bout to lose it
I'm 'bout to lose it
I'm 'bout to lose it
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh

I'on open doors for no hoes, I'm disrespectful
If I'on wanna talk, I'll let my choppa tell you a lecture
Let the choppa walk like a dog, it's gon' fetch you
He said that he fell off, but I make them .223's catch 'em
She know I got them racks
It ain't none for me to catch him
I been going through it
Me and all my hoes been getting to it
VETEMENTS, New Rock, yeah, on my toes, these ain't no Louis
Even though I been swagging, I been still going through it, yeah

Molly, jaw locking I can't feel shit
I been popping pills all year, yeah
She been popping pussy like a pill, yeah
I say fuck the block, I'm in the hills with the shit
I'm still livin' hood, but you know a nigga rich
I be lowkey, but you know I'm with the shits
I put binaries on all my new sticks
