		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I only thought it for a minute but it got me down
That kind of feeling when you've got something to cry about
And all the talking turned to screaming that I couldn't help
This isn't me, me, me
I only thought it for a moment but it's crippling
I guess the gravity have growing out of sinking in
What if I'm missing the capacity for all of it
This isn't me, me, me

And I'm so scared of losin' all control
Don't you tell me it's better to let go
When the weight of the world feels so close
It's only me, me, me

Audrey told me that she thinks I might be in my head
How I'm overthinking everything I never said?
How it's killing me a little to be different, oh?
It isn't me, me, me

But I'm so scared of losin' all control
Don't you tell me it's better to let go
When the weight of the world feels so close
It's only me, me, me

Hard to sleep, could it be
Only me, only me?
Hard to sleep, could it be
Only me, only me?
Hard to sleep, could it be
Only me, only me?
Hard to sleep, could it be
Only me, only me?
Mm-mm, mm-hmm

I'm so scared of losin' control
When they tell me it's better to let go
When the weight of the world feels so close
It's only me, me, me
And I'm so scared of losin' all control
When they tell me it's better to let go
When the weight of the world is so close
It's only me (me), me (me), me
It's only me, me, me
