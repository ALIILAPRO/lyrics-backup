		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were just a dream inside my head
I can't believe, can't believe that I wasn't dead
Already heading for the end of time, oh fuck

Soon enough is never gonna be soon enough, I wanna come home
True enough, I couldn't tell you when I felt enough to let them know
I was singled out, pointed out, taken outside
Given up, holdin' up, lookin' for the upside
Oh, just a minute I can feel my heartbeat coming on again

(Whoa) I wasn't ready
(Whoa) I wasn't anything
(Whoa) and then you showed me
(Whoa) we could be anything

You were just a dream inside my head
I can't believe, can't believe that I wasn't dead
Already heading for the end of time
I found you, you are

We could be star-made
We were written in the very dust around us
Look at this, look at me, lookin' at you
Always and all ways is all I want from you

(Whoa) I wasn't ready
(Whoa) I wasn't anything
(Whoa) and then you showed me
(Whoa) we could be everything

You were just a dream inside my head
I can't believe, can't believe that I wasn't dead
Already heading for the end of time
I found you, you are mine
You were just a dream inside my head
I can't believe, can't believe that I wasn't dead
Already heading for the end of time
I found you, you are mine

(Whoa) I wasn't ready
(Whoa) I wasn't anything
(Whoa) and then you showed me
(Whoa) we could be everything

You were just a dream inside my head
I can't believe, can't believe that I wasn't dead
Already heading for the end of time
I found you, you are mine
You were just a dream inside my head
I can't believe, can't believe that I wasn't dead
Already heading for the end of time
I found you, you are mine
