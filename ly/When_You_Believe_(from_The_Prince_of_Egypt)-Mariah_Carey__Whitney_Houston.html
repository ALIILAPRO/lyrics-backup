		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Many nights we prayed
With no proof, anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood

Now, we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains
Long before we knew we could, whoa, yes

There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe

(Ooh) mmm, yeah
In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer birds
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My hearts so full, I can't explain
Seeking faith and speakin' words
I never thought I'd say

There can be miracles
When you believe (when you believe)
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill (mmm)
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (you can achieve)
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe

They don't always happen when you ask
And it's easy to give in to your fears
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see your way clear through the rain
A small but still, resilient voice
Says hope is very near, oh (oh)

There can be miracles (miracles)
When you believe (boy, when you believe, yeah) 
(Though hope is frail) though hope is frail 
(It's hard) it's hard to kill (hard to kill, oh, yeah)
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (you can achieve, oh)
When you believe somehow you will (somehow, somehow, somehow)
Now you will (now I, now I, know)
You will when you believe (when you)
(Oh oh)
(You will when you believe)
(Ooh-ooh) (just believe)
(Just believe)
You will when you believe
