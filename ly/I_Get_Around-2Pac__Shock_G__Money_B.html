		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I get around)
Aw, yeah
'Round and 'round, 'round they go
I get around
Still clown with the Underground, when we come around (I get around)
'Round and 'round, 'round they go
Stronger than ever (I get around)

Back to get wreck
All respect to those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
'Cause, oh, they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why, your girl keeps paging me (what she say?)
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me, lady, take it easy
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me, I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayo, bust it, baby, got a problem saying, "Bye-bye" (I get around)
Just another hazard of a fly guy (word)
You ask why, don't matter, my pockets got fatter
Now everybody's looking for the latter (I get around)
And ain't no need in being greedy
If you wanna see me, dial the beeper number (I get around)
Baby, when you need me 
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie (I get around)
But when you learn you can't tie me down
Baby doll, check it out, I gets around

What you mean you don't know? I get around ('round and 'round, 'round we go)
The Underground just don't stop for hoes, I get around (I get around)
Still down with the Underground, I get around ('round and 'round, 'round we go)
Yeah, ayo, Shock, let them hoes know

Now you can tell from my everyday fits, I ain't rich
So cease and desist with them tricks (tricks)
I'm just another black man caught up in the mix (mix)
Trying to make a dollar out of fifteen cents (a dime and a nickel)
Just 'cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets
Baby, I can see, that you don't recognize me (I get around)
I'm Shock G, the one who put the satin on your panties (I get around)
Never knew a hooker that could share me, I get around

What's up love? How you doing? (All right)
Well I've been hanging singing, trying to do my thing
Oh, you heard that I was banging?
Your home girl you went to school with, that's cool
But did she tell you 'bout her sister and your cousin? Thought I wasn't (uh)
See, weekends was made for Michelob
But it's a Monday, my day, so just let me hit it, yo (I get around)
And don't mistake my statement for a clown
We can keep in the down low long as you know, that I get around

('Round and 'round, 'round we go)
2Pacalypse Now don't stop for hoes, I get around (I get around)
('Round and 'round, 'round we go)
Why I ain't call you? Ha ha, please (I get around)

Fingertips on the hips as I dip, gotta get a tight grip, don't slip
Loose lips sink ships, it's a trip
I love the way she licks her lips, see me jocking
Put a little twist in her hips 'cause I'm watching
Conversations on the phone 'til the break of dawn
Now we all alone, why the lights on?
Turn 'em off, time to set it off, get you wet and soft
Something's on your mind, let it off
You don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me (I get around)
Well, if I couldn't have it (silly rabbit) why you sweating me?
It's a lot of real G's doing time (I get around)
'Cause a groupie bent the truth and told a lie (uh-uh)
You picked the wrong guy, baby, if you're too fly (I get around)
You need to hit the door (uh), search for a new guy
'Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clowned, baby doll, are you down?
I get around

'Round and 'round, 'round we go (I get around)
'Round and 'round, 'round we go (uh) (I get around)
'Round and 'round, 'round we go (I get around)
'Round and 'round, 'round we go (I get around)

'Round and 'round, 'round we go
'Round and 'round, 'round we go
'Round and 'round, 'round we go
'Round and 'round, 'round we go (I get around)

I get around
I get around
I get around
I get around
