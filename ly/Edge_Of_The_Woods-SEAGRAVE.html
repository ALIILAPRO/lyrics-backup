		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you know what makes me tick
Set me off for the hunt
I hear your Words of doubt flood my head
Stifled breath breads weakness
String em up high
Just tell me why
At all costs
Ignorance is inherent
Yea yea
Slain the prey
For our survival
Proved on the plains
To take my seat as the king
The trees have open ears
Sit an hear their cries to be
Bringer of death
Your Time has expired
Overwhelming heat
Held in fear don't look here
I'd rather hear your last beat
As you become nothing more than meat
At the edge of the woods
You become the prey
You should have slit me when you
Had the fuckin chance
The whites of your eyes are all I see
In the hell of night
With me
I'll make you fuckin
Kneel before the reaper
You're at the fucking end of your life
Kneel before the reaper
Caught at the end of time
Kneel before the reaper
Until we meet again
Your death was in delusion
In delusion
They look to me
Beseeched
You are not one to be missed
They won't fuckin listen to your pleas
A pathetic heap of cowardice
Hail the fury
For I have dethroned god
