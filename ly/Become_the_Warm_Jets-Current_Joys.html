		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can hear it when that old song starts to play
Cutting through my body in familiar ways
Is it me or is it you who can't relate
Cause I can feel it when those warm jets take
me away

The useless seems to matter more and more
My life is just something I can ignore
Consumed and enthused by all that came before
Cause I can feel
it when those warm jets start
to roar

Give me everything I ever need
Or just enough so I can go to sleep
Is it me or is it you who came to see
The scene where all the warm jets swallow me
