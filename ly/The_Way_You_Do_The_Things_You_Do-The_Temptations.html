		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You got a smile so bright
You know you could have been a candle
I'm holding you so tight
You know you could have been a handle
The way you swept me off my feet
You know you could've been a broom
The way you smell so sweet
You know you could've been some perfume

Well you could've been anything that you wanted to
And I can tell
The way you do the things you do
The way you do the thing you do, ah baby 
The way you do the things you do

As pretty as you are
You know you could've been a flower
If good looks were minutes
You know that you could be an hour
The way you stole my heart
You know you could have been a crook
And baby your so smart
You know you could have been a school book

Well you could've been anything that you wanted to
And I can tell
The way you do the things you do 
The way you do the thing you do, ah baby
The way you do the things you do)

You make my life so rich
You know you could've been some money
And baby you're so sweet
You know you could have been some honey

Well you could've been anything that you
Wanted to and I can tell
The way you do the things you do 
The way you do the things you do 
You really swept me off my feet 
The way you do the things you do
You made my life complete 
The way you do the things you do
You made my life so bright 
The way you do the things you do
You make me feel alright 
The way you do the things you do
You make me feel alright 
The way you do the things you do
