		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Those folks, believe one thing of themselves
Thinking that they're aristocratic
But yet at the same time they're just hiding and are masked
Behind their own belief of themselves
(Neenyo, slow it down)

Oh, oh, ooh-oh
I'll see you in the mornin' (see you in the mornin')
Oh, oh-whoa

You and me always feel right
When we get close we ain't never gotta force it
Woke up, with you here on my mind
Picture us now drinkin' coffee on a Sunday
Sunrise on the City of Angels
Every day more friends are feelin' like strangers
But you and me always feel right (right)
Gotta go home but I'll see you in the mornin'

Yeah, I know you from the city of the angels (angels)
Take a shot for me and now I see your angle ('gle)
I know you ride for me because our love is tangled
I've tried to get away but, baby, I can let go (go)
'Cause your vibe is like no other, I seen this before
Tainted ways just like the cover
And you reap what you've sowed
If you treat me like another
Not certified but I'm your lover, boy

You and me always feel right (right)
When we get close, we ain't never gotta force it (yeah)
Woke up with you here on my mind (mind)
Picture us now drinkin' coffee on a Sunday (ooh-ohh)
Sunrise on the city of Angels
Every day more friends are feelin' like strangers
But you and me always feel right (right)
Gotta go home but I'll see you in the mornin'

Oh, oh, ooh-oh
I'll see you in the mornin' (see you in the mornin')
Oh, oh-whoa (mornin'), oh-whoa, oh

And I'm not afraid
We're face to face
And the time slows down (and the time slows down)
It's all okay, yeah, yeah
Tell Uncle Ricky to turn up the music
And I love how you get in my head
