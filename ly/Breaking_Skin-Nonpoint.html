		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need more than just blood and air to survive
There's a hole so deep and cold, it will never see the light of day

Until you feel the skin break
Eyes are always falling on you
But that itch, it keeps calling, calling
Yeah, eyes are always falling on you 
And that itch, it keeps calling, calling

I need more than just blood and air to survive
(How can I give you any more when there's nothing left)
There's a hole so deep and cold, it will never see the light of day
(How can I give you any more when there's nothing) 

Until you feel the skin break
Eyes are always falling on you
But that itch, it keeps calling, calling
Yeah, eyes are always falling on you 
And that itch, it keeps calling, calling

We're weaker than we care to admit
We scratch and itch
We're graveyard shifting
Biting and barking, fueling and sparking
That fire, that itch
And breaking the skin again

Until you feel the skin break (those eyes)
Eyes are always falling on you (that itch)
But that itch, it keeps calling, calling (those eyes)
Yeah, eyes are always falling on you (that itch)
And that itch, it keeps calling, calling
