		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just as a sun burns
We can all emit a light
Cause it's something we're born with
Feeling my mind quake
From the colours inside
And the graceful designs
I can feel my body floating out from other lives
As I suspended I awakened mine
I heard a heavenly call to all the pleads I made
They said it's time I learned they said it's time I
Changed
Earth has screamed and my throat bares the weight
I can only relay the message
A species lost but can be atoned
Sifting sand by the grain
But not alone
Colours in the air they gleam
A sight that brings me to tears
I can see them almost every day
If only everybody saw the same
They can
Maybe they would feel the love like me
Planetary blissfulness
I dream
Is something I can only dream to achieve
I will try my best either way
I will do what I can
In life
In this life
As beings we have stumbled around in pain
Looking up for creators to answer
I feel like everything we know is illusionary
But that can change
We can change
We as a race can learn again
When we hear "to love is to prosper"
We as a race will learn again
We can learn we will learn to
Grow
To grow
Colours in the air they gleam
A sight that brings me to tears
I can see them almost every day
If only everybody saw the same
They can
Maybe they would feel the love like me
Planetary blissfulness
I dream
Is something I can only dream to achieve
I will try my best either way
I will do what I can
We as a race can learn again
We as a race will learn again
We can learn
We will learn
To
Grow
