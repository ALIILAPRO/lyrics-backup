		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Make me feel
I need you to make me feel

Grasping towards the sun
To reach the light of day
I've fallen in the dark
Afraid I'll have to stay

And now I'm faced with
Ultimate despair
I need you to make me feel
To make me fucking care
I'm growing numb
I'm growing numb

Eroded soul
A twisted knife
Weathered by
The pain of life
Overthink
And doubt it all
I've lost my wings
Afraid to fall

And every day
I'm growing numb
I can't
I'm growing numb
Can't feel
I'm growing numb
I can't feel a thing

The heavens
Cry tears of fire
The heavens
Have denied my way

If this is the end
Then take from me what you will
A hollow vessel
With no blood left to spill

I will hide from the spotlight
I will stay in the dark
Pain cannot finish
If pain never starts

Pain cannot finish
If pain never starts

Make me feel
I need you to make me feel
Make me feel
