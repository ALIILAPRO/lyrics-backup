		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We could call it Kama Sutra
You tryna tie me up (trynatie me up)
Shawty thinking about the future
I'm just tryna pour up
Come out of them jeans
And make me a believer (woop woop)
Put it on me
I ain't never gone leave ya
Kama Kama Sutra
Kama Kama Sutra babe (yeah)
Kama Kama Sutra
Tryna tie me up
Tie me up (tryna tie me up)

In the bathroom
Taking pictures
Paparazzi she's a A lister
And her girlfriend, that came with her
And my bet is yes, she came with her
Call 911 on me if I don't put a ring on this girl
Call 911 cause when she do me like this

We could call it Kama Sutra
You tryna tie me up (trying tie me up)
Shawty thinking about the future
I'm just tryna pour up (yeah)
Come out of those jeans
And make me a believer (woop woop)
Put it on me
I ain't never gone leave ya
Kama Kama Sutra (Kama Kama Sutra)
Kama Kama Sutra babe
Kama Kama Sutra (Kama Kama Sutra)
Tryna tie me up
Tie me up

Fur handcuffs
Got the zip up
That's that freaky shit that I'm in to
Black tripod, pink blindfold
I ain't even know she was so nympho
Call 911 on me if I don't put a ring on this girl
Call 911 cause when she do me like this

We could call it Kama Sutra
You tryna tie me up (trying tie me up)
Shawty thinking about the future
I'm just tryna pour up (yeah)
Come out of those jeans
And make me a believer (woop woop)
Put it on me
I ain't never gone leave ya
Kama Kama Sutra (Kama Kama Sutra)
Kama Kama Sutra babe
Kama Kama Sutra (Kama Kama Sutra)
Tryna tie me up
Tie me up

I said call it Kama Sutra
You look so beautiful
Hitting on the hookah
I could tell you a freak though
Shots ain't nothing but a free throw
Ducking round here like you the hot shit
Trying tie me up, I'm a hot stitch
But I never call 911
Hands everywhere like I got 6 arm
Like Shiva, but I'm feeling on your Buddha
Uh, shawty think about the future
Found me when ever you around me

We could call it Kama Sutra
You tryna tie me up (trying tie me up)
Shawty thinking about the future
I'm just tryna pour up (yeah)
Come out of those jeans
And make me a believer (woop woop)
Put it on me
I ain't never gone leave ya
Kama Kama Sutra (Kama Kama Sutra)
Kama Kama Sutra babe
Kama Kama Sutra (Kama Kama Sutra)
Tryna tie me up
Tie me up

Shawty I don't mind
You can go ahead and tie
Tie me up, tie me up
