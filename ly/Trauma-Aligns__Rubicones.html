		  Boom!
This is already a psycho system like that
Who picked it like that? Won't you say it to my face you ain't got the wit to deploy I'm completely different
I walk 'round your table , accept you're the reason , the rest of the dead.
Ok to tell that I'm dangerous
I broke out , I'm something else
When I outran the kid
I'm used to those rapid door
I'll destroy TV sets
Though they want the chill it take
To hang with the broadcast
This place is a
Trauma
This is depicted like drama
Jiu Jitsu impact this shock
I dig the danger , I'm about it , it's part of life
Witness this danger , excitement is part of life
I'm into this danger , it's parted me all my life
Act upon the reason, the wreck in this
Trauma
This is depicted like drama
Jiu Jitsu impact this
TRAUMA this is the sentence, my drama
You representing my strategy
Rapid display give me , like there's no more to see
I think so great to be , I get so tense so quick
I should surrender me , acting so mean
Wild li'l V ...oh no
That is the part I like , that is the danger.. oh no
And my ..
Fu.. Fu..Future shock
TRAUMA
Hey offensive like that
A bridging like that
I'll disable his shit and I'm erasing him like that
I'm gonna abc..
This is the awakening
Work with danger life that is the the part I like, a future history time line
This is the awakening
The world
This is the awakening
Don't waste the danger life, that is the part I like, a future history timeline
This is the awakening
