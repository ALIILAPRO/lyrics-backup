		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who shall be remembered
In the ancient house of war?
All the medals, all those stories
In the alley of the greats
Celebrated hero, who has wandered through the dark
She stands before you, all that metal shining bright

Lost in time, returning to the light
Bow before, this lady fights for life (so sister)

Raise your hand
For the lady of the dark
Soldier with no will to kill
With a philanthropic heart (forever)
Break the norm
She's the girl in uniform
Fighting side by side with men
She will fight until the end

Lied to be respected
And to change her brother's fate
Took a bullet, earned her freedom
And a place among the stars
And she served the iron squadron
Served the toughest of them all
No fear of dying
For the frontline she was born

Sacrifice, she took her brother's place
War to war, a place where she belong (so brother)

Raise your hand
For the lady of the dark
Soldier with no will to kill
With a philanthropic heart (forever)
Break the norm
She's the girl in uniform
Fighting side by side with men
She will fight until the end

Don't fear the reaper
Don't fear the war
She spared the life of brothers (of brothers)
She'll fight for honor
She'll fight for life
A lady goes to war

Raise your hand
For the lady of the dark
Raise your hand
For the lady of the dark
Soldier with no will to kill
With a philanthropic heart (forever)
Break the norm
She's the girl in uniform
Fighting side by side with men
She will fight until the end (the end, the end)
