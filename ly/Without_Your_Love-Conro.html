		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hard to ignore all the things we said
I wish I could change it
(I wish I could change it) a little shaky
Our emotions got the best of us lately
(best of us lately)
I got issues, yeah, you got 'em too
Our feelings too bruised to fight

We can say a lot in a little bit
Pressure in our minds made us throw a fit
But got that kind of love
And that ain't counterfeit it's foolish
And useless without your love

We can say a lot (lot, lot, lot)
Without your love
We can say a lot (lot, lot, lot)

Turning pages
Communication made me focus on the basics
(focus on the basics) well let's face it
Being open isn't easy as they say it
(easy as they say it)
I got issues, yeah, you got 'em too
Our feelings too bruised to fight

We can say a lot in a little bit
Pressure in our minds made us throw a fit
But got that kind of love
And that ain't counterfeit it's foolish
And useless without your love

We can say a lot (lot, lot, lot)
Without your love
We can say a lot (lot, lot, lot)

We can say a lot in a little bit
Pressure in our minds made us throw a fit
But got that kind of love
And that ain't counterfeit it's foolish
And useless without your love

We can say a lot (lot, lot, lot)
Without your love
We can say a lot (lot, lot, lot)
We can say a lot in a little bit (little bit)
Pressure in our minds made us throw a fit
(made us throw a fit)
But got that kind of love
And that ain't counterfeit it's foolish
And useless without your love
