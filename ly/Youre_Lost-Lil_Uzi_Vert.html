		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Know I had to tell my girl
This ain't that
Woah, I don't want you back
Yeah, I'm just counting racks
Ya, the money won't bring her back (It won't)
Ya, and I just want her back
Want her back (I want her back)
Yah, say you made your money back flip you lyin'
Skrt-skrt, big Lambo' now I'm drivin'

Give her the D yeah she fight it
Yeah she turn around and she like it
Woah slide on it, ride on it
Turn around girl, bite on it
Diamond chain, you can shine a light on it
I hit your girl, yeah it's tight homie
I'm so fly you fly a kite on me
Stand on my money, you got some height on me
Yeah no that is not my homie
I said no that is not my homie

I was in Miami with my old homies
Fucked on your girl when she got lonely

Skrt-skrt
Yeah my car it go skrt-skrt
Might fuck around and buy a new one
Cowboy status walk with two guns, yeah
Wait, hold up
Diamonds all on my teeth feeling sunny
I'mma walk through the game 'til I run it
I just left out the bank with 100
(Wait, wait, wait 100,000? Yeah)
I know she was with you some time ago
She left you 'cause um boy so broke
Boy you a joke
Boy you a hoax
She got with her boss 'cause boy you a ho
Yeah, he ain't got no money
I swear that, that boy be doin' that most
He say he gon' get me touched
Tryna put on a show
Talkin' that he gotta go
30k down for the low
Everybody be quiet yeah
Gotta keep the blinds closed
Who that knockin' at my door
Runnin' out the back door
Saint Laurent 'cause of Yeezy
Remember life wasn't easy
Remember girls didn't need me
Now they beggin' just to meet me
Bad girl from Waikiki
And she wetter than a squeegee
Long legs just like Dee Dee
Lil nigga just like Dexter
But she know I'mma flex her
And you know I'mma finesse her
Young nigga gettin' money
Girl are you F

I was in Miami with my old homies
Fucked on your girl when she got lonely
