		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh oh
Don't be so sure oh oh oh
Oh ooh oh

Baby na the way that you talk and the things that you say
Wey dey make I feel alright
And I catch a vibe anytime that I look in your face
Tell me why ya look so fine
Baby girl I see you
Wanna ride you like a bicycle
And you dey blow my mind from a mile or two (Mile or two)
And I no go lie you light up my day

And when she tell me my love is your love baby
She no want the Gucci bag or the Fendi
Girl she gimme butterflies in my belly ooh loo
And when she tell me my love is your love baby
If my world was drowning baby she go save me
Girl she gimme butterflies in my belly ooh loo

Your love is crazy girl your love is crazy
You amazed me girl you amazing
Other girls them only really want to play me
But when me dey with you,
I realize love don't cost a dime (Love don't cost a dime)

Your love is crazy
You amazed me girl you amazing
Other girls them only really want to play me
But when me dey with you
I realize love don't cost a dime (Love don't cost a dime)

Best indeed you're the best indeed
When I see you I feel blessed indeed
Only you bring out the best in me
Loving you e be my destiny oh no
Odo I don't know if you love me like I do
Na you dey light my fire too
No no if you double date I no mind

And when she tell me my love is your love baby
She no want the Gucci bag or the Fendi
Girl she gimme butterflies in my belly, ooh-loo
And when she tell me my love is your love baby (My love is your love baby)
If my world was drowning baby she go save me (I go save you)
Girl she gimme butterflies in my belly ooh loo (Oh, no)

Your love is crazy girl your love is crazy (Crazy)
You amazed me girl you amazing
Other girls them only really want to play me
But when me dey with you
I realize love don't cost a dime (Love don't cost a dime)

Your love is crazy
You amazed me girl you amazing
Other girls them only really want to play me (Don't worry, don't)
But when me dey with you
I realize love don't cost a dime (Love don't cost a dime)

Yeah yeah
My baby love don't cost a dime (Love don't cost a dime)
Love don't cost a dime
Love me like that (Love me like that)
