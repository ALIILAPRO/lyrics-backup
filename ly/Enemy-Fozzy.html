		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you remember me
You can't see the things
That make me who I am
You'll never understand

And I gotta keep moving, you're living off my sweat
Moving, the devil's on my back
And these are the days that I dreamed about
And you're always there to remind me

You're my enemy
All that we had has gone away
There are times that fade away
But you'll still be my enemy

The friend you had in me
You turned on so easily
I'm sad to see you go
At least now I know

And I see clearly now
You tried to bleed me
And I see clearly now
You tried to feed on me
