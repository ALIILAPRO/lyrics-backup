		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's always a little doubt
In your eyes
Maybe it didn't hurt enough
Maybe it didn't hurt enough
You always sit in the house
Chasin' a high
Maybe you didn't learn enough
Maybe you didn't learn enough
You say you're not that scared to die
You've seen the other side
And Baby it didn't hurt at all
Ya Baby you know I heard it all
Are you just tryina convince yourself
That you wouldn't even miss this life at all
Maybe you need something else
So I'm taking you home
When my wings are right around you
You see the light
With the darkness all around
I can take you home
Wrap my wings tight right around you
Can't you see I'm the light
In the darkness all around
You feel a little lost
Feel like throwing up
The needle doesn't mind
When you're going up
A pretty little pill
Made you fall in love
Feelin like you're close
But it's not enough
You keep a little piece of heaven
Close enough, that you can touch it
When you're lonely, cold and dark
But will you love it when you're gone
you can't come back from where you're goin
But I'm taking you home
When my wings are right around you
You see the light
With the darkness all around
I can take you home
Wrap my wings tight right around you
Can't you see I'm the light
In the darkness all around
