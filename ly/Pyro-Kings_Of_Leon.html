		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Single book of matches, gonna burn what's standing in the way
Roaring down the mountain, now they're calling on the fire brigade
Bury all the pictures, and tell the kids that I'm okay
If and I'm forgotten, you'll remember me for today

I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
I

All the black inside me, is slowly seeping from the bone
Everything I cherish, is slowly dying or it's gone
Little shaken babies and drunkards seem to all agree
Once the show gets started it's bound to be a sight to see

I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
I, I don't wanna be here holding on
I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
I

Watch her roll, can you feel it?
Watch her roll, can you feel it?
Watch her roll, can you feel it?
Watch her roll, can you feel it?

I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
I, I don't wanna be here holding on (watch her roll)
I (can you feel it?)
I won't ever be your cornerstone (watch her roll)
I
