		  Ju-Ju-June on the beat
June on the beat

She just wanna fuck with me 'cause I'm famous
Closet full of fly shit, that's what them bands did
Niggas hatin' on me, it don't even make sense
Put the Rollie on my wrist so they know what time it is
She just wanna fuck with me 'cause I'm famous
Closet full of fly shit, that's what them bands did
Niggas hatin' on me, it don't even make sense
Put the Rollie on my wrist so they know what time it is

Cuticles in the Carti's, I'm just clearin' my vision
Pushin' the ill line to count millions with niggas
The homies ain't put you on, blood remember them niggas
Paperwork surfaced, quit defendin' them niggas, huh?
Y'all pretend to be killers to keep it jiggy
Drum on the yeeky, it's litty, that bitch pretty
Sacramento nigga, been standin' up for the city
With the right to bear arms, we blammied up in the city, you hear me?
Keep a roll of pink fifties, all crispy
Way of life risky, I can sense some shit fishy
Dope on the digi', we bag it then ship it out
We hoppin' inside of foreigns, we baggin' and spinnin' out, right

She just wanna fuck with me 'cause I'm famous
Closet full of fly shit, that's what them bands did
Niggas hatin' on me, it don't even make sense
Put the Rollie on my wrist so they know what time it is
She just wanna fuck with me 'cause I'm famous
Closet full of fly shit, that's what them bands did
Niggas hatin' on me, it don't even make sense
Put the Rollie on my wrist so they know what time it is

Shout out to Mozzy, I just jumped out a Masi
With a Draco in the Louis and the gang in the lobby
Still rich Crips with me, I never left nobody
I done made niggas rich and you ain't help nobody
And it's blood on my name nigga, fuck the fame nigga
So plan your funeral, 'cause that come with my chain nigga (on God)
And the bitch wanna fuck for some change nigga (How much?)
To me that shit pennies, but it's lame nigga
Big gangster, no bandana though (None)
I took my bitch from Oakland (What else?)
Had a threesome with my Atlanta ho (Okay)
Lam' truck, but I really want the Phantom though (Frrt)
Rich nigga, fuck I'm thinkin', I can have 'em both (Beep)

She just wanna fuck with me cause I'm famous
Closet full of fly shit, that's what them bands did
Niggas hatin' on me, it don't even make sense
Put the Rollie on my wrist so they know what time it is
She just wanna fuck with me 'cause I'm famous
Closet full of fly shit, that's what them bands did
Niggas hatin' on me, it don't even make sense
Put the Rollie on my wrist so they know what time it is

He just wanna fuck with me 'cause I'm the one
He got all the drugs and I got all the guns
He know I'm from Detroit, he know I get the job done
I pull up with them bitches, them niggas go crazy for
DeJ Loaf, little smooth ass DeJ Loaf
Have a nigga on the leash, he do what I say so
Left the Ghost runnin', I might pull up in a tank though
Tank on, got these bitches pissed like a race horse
From the D to the A to the Bay (I know)
That's, that's me, Su, and K Camp
No way, no sir, I don't let the fame get to me (I don't let the fame)
But you gotta be kiddin' me

She just wanna fuck with me 'cause I'm famous
Closet full of fly shit, that's what them bands did
Niggas hatin' on me, it don't even make sense
Put the Rollie on my wrist so they know what time it is
She just wanna fuck with me 'cause I'm famous
Closet full of fly shit, that's what them bands did
Niggas hatin' on me, it don't even make sense
Put the Rollie on my wrist so they know what time it is

'Cause they know what time it is
Ju-Ju-June on the beat
June on the beat
