		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's the most wonderful time of the year 
With the kids jingle belling
And everyone telling you be of good cheer 
It's the most wonderful time of the year 
It's the hap happiest season of all
With those holiday greetings and gay happy meetings 
When friends come to call 
It's the hap happiest season of all 

There'll be parties for hosting 
Marshmallows for toasting 
And caroling out in the snow 
There'll be scary ghost stories 
And tales of the glories of 
Christmases long, long ago 

It's the most wonderful time of the year 
There'll be much mistltoeing 
And hearts will be glowing 
When love ones are near 
It's the most wonderful time of the year 

There'll be parties for hosting 
Marshmallows for toasting 
And caroling out in the snow 
There'll be scary ghost stories 
And tales of the glories of 
Christmases long, long ago 

It's the most wonderful time of the year 
There'll be much mistltoeing 
And hearts will be glowing 
When love ones are near 
It's the most wonderful time 
It's the most wonderful time 
It's the most wonderful time of the year
