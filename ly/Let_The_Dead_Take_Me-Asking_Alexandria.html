		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a lot of stress in the back of my mind
And I can feel it pumping blood 'round, 'round
Like there's something inside
I'm going down, down, think I'm at the end of the ride
'Cause everybody don't mean shit no more

I'm taking one hit just cure my pain
I'm losing my life tryna live again
I'm feeling so fucked up, messed up, spinning around
If they could see me now, yeah

Take me down to the river of the hopeless
Wash my sins, let the dead take me
Take my soul, let me feed on the broken
Cleanse my pain, let the blood run free

I'm going too fast and I'm never gonna stop
My mind is racing and I'm falling from the top
I feel a little psycho, crazy, nothing seems to faze me
I'm losing myself again

I'm taking one hit just cure my pain
I'm losing my life tryna live again
I'm feeling so fucked up, messed up, spinning around
If they could see me now, yeah

Take me down to the river of the hopeless
Wash my sins, let the dead take me
Take my soul, let me feed on the broken
Cleanse my pain, let the blood run free

Oh Messiah, Oh Messiah
Wash away my sins and let the dead take me
Take me down to the river of the hopeless
Wash my sins, let the dead take me

Mm, take me down, down
Take me down, down

Take me down to the river of the hopeless
Wash my sins, let the dead take me
Take my soul, let me feed on the broken
Cleanse my pain, let the blood run free

Take me down to the river of the hopeless
Wash my sins, let the dead take me
Take my soul, let me feed on the broken
Cleanse my pain, let the blood run free

(Stress, stress in the back of my mind)
Down, down at the end of the ride
'Cause everybody don't mean shit

I'm taking one hit just cure my pain
I'm losing my life tryna live again
I'm feeling so fucked up, messed up, spinning around
If they could see me now, yeah

Down to the river of the hopeless
Wash my sins, let the dead take me
Take my soul, let me feed on the broken
Cleanse my pain, let the blood run free

Oh Messiah, Oh Messiah
Wash away my sins and let the dead take me

Take me down to the river of the hopeless
Wash my sins, let the dead take me
Take my soul, let me feed on the broken
Cleanse my pain, let the blood run free

Oh Messiah, Oh Messiah
Oh Messiah, Oh Messiah
Cleanse my pain, let the blood run free
