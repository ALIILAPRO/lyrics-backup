		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've tasted death's desire
I drank the plasma from the wrist
Let go of feelings
Stared into ember eyes
Blackness devoured, these eyes were once mine
Blackness devoured, these eyes were never mine
But I don’t know who's eyes they've become
(Who they've become)
My home has become my tomb
Now bleed me dry
So I can be clean again

Never ending agony
No sympathy
My misery, complete

Never ending agony
The fear it lives on inside you and me
(Inside of me)
Separating death from dreams
No sympathy
(Sympathy)
My misery, complete

I recognize that you're fading
From the deception, you are sustaining

I won't leave you in the dark
Forsake your legacy
I will not leave you in the dark
Desert in your misery

Never ending agony
The fear it lives on inside you and me
(Inside of me)
Separating death from dreams
No sympathy
(Sympathy)
My misery, complete

I recognize that you're fading
From the deception, you are sustaining
Eyes of despair
A face full of lust

Eternal damnation
Eternal damnation

Staring into nothingness
I am bound by fate with blood on my hands
Writing in hopelessness
Ensnared by the desolate screams
(By the desolate screams)
This is your descent

Never ending agony
The fear it lives on inside you and me
(Inside of me)
Separating death from dreams
No sympathy
(Sympathy)
My misery, complete

Between death and dreams
(Eternal agony)
Pain becomes a part of me
(I know I can’t break free)
Between death and dreams
(Eternal agony)
Pain becomes a part of me
(I know I can’t break free)
