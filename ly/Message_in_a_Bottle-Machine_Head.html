		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just a castaway, an island lost at sea oh
Another lonely day, there's no one here but me oh
More loneliness than any man could bear
Rescue me before I fall into despair

I'll send an SOS to the world
I'll send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle, yeah
Message in a bottle, yeah

A year has passed since I wrote my note
But I should have known this right from the start
Only hope can keep us together, yeah
Love can mend your life
But love can break your heart, oh

I'll send an SOS to the world
I'll send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle, yeah
Message in a bottle, yeah

I'm sending out an SOS
I'm sending out an SOS
I'm sending out an SOS
...
