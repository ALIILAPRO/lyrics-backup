		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We’re living under
We’re living under
We’re living under (God's plan)
We’re living under
We’re living under (God's plan)

We’re living under
We’re living under
We’re living under (GOD)
We’re living under
We’re living under (GOD)

[Mantra by Isyana Sarasvati]
Amani tha mala dossa ["We are people full of sin"]
Amani tha il apayla ["Believes one is most holy but we are not"]
Ominara ama doa ["Let us return through the power of prayer"]

His power controls mankind
The one and true mastermind
He rules over space and time
Our spirits go through a journey so divine

His world that we stepped upon
Gave life and has now begun
to fade and once all is done
It’s only then we’ll see all the wreckage that we brought on

We’re living under
We’re living under
We’re living under (God's plan)
We’re living under
We’re living under (God's plan)

We’re living under
We’re living under
We’re living under (GOD)
We’re living under
We’re living under (GOD)

[Mantra by Isyana Sarasvati]
Amani tha mala dossa ["We are people full of sin"]
Amani tha il apayla ["Believes one is most holy but we are not"]
Ominara ama doa ["Let us return through the power of prayer"]

His power controls mankind
The one and true mastermind
He rules over space and time
Our spirits go through a journey so divine

His world that we stepped upon
Gave life and has now begun
to fade and once all is done
It’s only then we’ll see all the wreckage that we brought on

Power controls mankind
True mastermind
Over space and time
Journey so divine

Mastermind!
Mankind!
Mastermind!
Mankind!
Mastermind!
Mankind!

Mastermind!
Mankind!
Mastermind!
Mankind!
Mastermind!
Mankind!

Mastermind!
Mankind!
Mastermind!
Mankind!
Mastermind!
Mankind!

His power controls mankind (His power controls mankind )
He rules over space and time
Our spirits go through a journey so divine

His world that we stepped upon
Gave life and has now begun
to fade and once all is done
It’s only then we’ll see all the wreckage that we brought on
