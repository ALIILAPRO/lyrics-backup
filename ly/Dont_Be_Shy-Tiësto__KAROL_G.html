		  (La, la, la, la, la)
(La, la, la, la, la)
(La, la, la, la, la)
(Ta-ra, ta, ta, ta)

People say I'm not gonna change, not gonna change
I know that you like that 
You know where my mind's at
Can't be tamed, I'm not gonna play, not gonna play
Oh no, I ain't like that
Fuck 'em, I'm a wild cat

Baby, break my heart
Give me all you got
Don't ask "Why, why, why?"
Don't be shy, shy, shy
Is it love or lust?
I can't get enough
Don't ask "Why, why, why?"
Don't be shy, shy, shy

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
Ta-ra, ta, ta, ta
Ta, ta, ta, ra-ra
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
Ta-ra, ta, ta, ta

People say I'm not gonna change, not gonna change
I know that you like that 
You know where my mind's at
Can't be tamed, I'm not gonna play, not gonna play
Oh no, I ain't like that
Fuck 'em, I'm a wild cat

Baby, break my heart
Give me all you got
Don't ask "Why, why, why?"
Don't be shy, shy, shy
Is it love or lust?
I can't get enough
Don't ask "Why, why, why?"
Don't be shy, shy, shy

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
Ta-ra, ta, ta, ta
Ta, ta, ta, ra-ra
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
Ta-ra, ta, ta, ta

Show yourself beautiful
Wanna get emotional, oh-oh
Mmm
Follow me, easy now
We could work a miracle, oh-oh
Mmm, yeah

Baby, break my heart
Give me all you got
Don't ask "Why, why, why?"
Don't be shy, shy, shy
Is it love or lust?
I can't get enough
Don't ask "Why, why, why?"
Don't be shy, shy, shy
