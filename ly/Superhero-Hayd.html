		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Superman will never save you
Spiderman will never catch you
The flash will never run to you
Like I would, When I was with you

You know you've reaped what you have sown
You know you're the reason you're alone
You said I was your superhero
But sometimes superheroes cannot save everyone

Iron man will never heal you
The Hulk will never hold you
Another man will never love you
Like I did, Like I still do

You know you've reaped what you have sown
You know you're the reason you're alone
You said I was your superhero
But sometimes superheroes cannot save everyone

I had to let go
And watch you fall
And I could've saved you
But you didn't want me to

So I let you go
And I watched you fall
And I could've saved you
But you didn't want me to

So I let you go
And I watched you fall
And I could've saved you
But you didn't want me to

You know you've reaped what you have sown
You know you're the reason you're alone
You said I was your superhero
But sometimes superheroes cannot save everyone
