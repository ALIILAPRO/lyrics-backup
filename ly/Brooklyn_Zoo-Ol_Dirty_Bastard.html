		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shit
Word, I'll bust that nigga ass right now
Ain't no, none of them niggas can't fuck with me
What? Nigga, you could never fuck with me, my nigga
I'll fuck you up right now, what? What? What? (Fuck you niggas)
Bust your motherfucking ass, boy
I ain't no motherfucking joke
You know who you talking to? (Yo, word up, bust that nigga ass, word up)
Ol' Dirty Bastard, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'll fuck you up right now
Yeah, what? What? What? (Serve that nigga, yo)
He ain't sayin' nothin', fuck him (he ain't sayin' nothin', fuck him)

I'm the one-man army, Ason
I never been tooken out, I keep MC's looking out
I drop science like Cosby dropping babies
Enough to make a nigga go crazy
In the G building, taking all types of medicines
Your ass thought you were better than
Ason, I keep planets in orbit
While I be coming with deeper and more shit
Enough to make you break and shake your ass
As I create rhymes good as a Tastycake makes
This style, I'm mastered in
Niggas catching headaches, what? What? You need Aspirin?
This type of pain you couldn't even kill with Midol
Fuck around, get sprayed with Lysol
In your face like a can of mace, baby
Is it burning? Well, fuck it, now you're learning
How I don't even like your motherfucking profile
Give me my fucking shit, ch-ch-blaow
Not seen and heard, no one knows
You forget niggas be quiet as kept
Now you know nothing
Before you knew a whole fucking lot
Your ass don't wanna get shot (shot)
A lot of MC's came to my showdown
And watched me put your fucking ass low down
As you can go, below zero
Without a doubt I never been tooken out
By a nigga, who couldn't figure
Yo, by a nigga, who couldn't figure
Yo, by a nigga, who couldn't figure (Brooklyn Zoo)
How to pull a fucking gun trigger
I said, "Get the fuck outta here"
Nigga wanna get too close, do the utmost
But I got stacks that'll attack any wack host
Introducing, yo, fuck that nigga's name
My Hip Hop drops on your head like rain
And when it rains it pours, 'cause my rhymes hardcore
That's why I give you more of the raw
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
Mc's I'll be burning, burning hot
Whoa-hoa-hoa, let me, like, slow up with the flow
If I move too quick, oh, you just won't know
I'm homicidal when you enter the target
Nigga get up, act like a pig trying to hog shit
So I take yo' ass out quick
The mics, I've had it my nigga, you can suck my dick (dick)
If you wanna step to my motherfucking rep
Ch-ch-bloaw-blaow-blaow, blown to death
You got shot 'cause you knock, knock, knock
"Who's there?" Another motherfucking hard rock
Slacking on your macking 'cause raw's what you lack
You wanna react? Bring it on back (back)

Shame on you, when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard, Brooklyn Zoo
Shame on you, when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard, Brooklyn Zoo 
Brooklyn Zoo (what?)
Shame on you, when you step through to (my nigga)
The Ol' Dirty Bastard, Brooklyn Zoo
Shame on you, when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard, Brooklyn Zoo
Shame on you, when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard, Brooklyn Zoo

What? My nigga
Shame on you
Shame-
Shame on you when you step through to
Shame on, shame on, shame on you when you step through to
Shame on you when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard, Brooklyn Zoo
Shame on you when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard, Brooklyn Zoo
What? My nigga
