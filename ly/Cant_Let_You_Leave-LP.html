		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't set you free, no
And the wheels just turn and turn, you see
'Til they grind me to stone
All the promises you can never keep just keep me awake
'Cause I can't be the way you wanted
And I know that your hands don't wanna hold me more
And your eyes don't wanna see, no

It's like the needle from, the needle from the spoon
I just need it from you, need it from you

Can't let you leave, no
Won't let you leave, da-darling
You took it all, and just in case
You took a little more, no lie
Can't let you go (are you satisfied?)
Can't let you go, no no, no (I feel good inside)
Can't breathe, can't sleep, can't eat
Can't live without you here
Baby, I can't let you leave

(Can't breathe, can't sleep, can't eat)
(Can't live without you here)

Don't take my dignity, child
'Cause it's taking all my strength to keep
God willing this time
I gotta rein you in
'Cause you don't understand how you're hurting me bad
And you don't know the fire you started
And you don't see the heat that's rising higher
I'm tired of trying, I'm out of my mind, oh

It's like the needle from, the needle from the spoon
I just need it from you, need it from you

Can't let you leave, no
Won't let you leave, da-darling
You took it all, and just in case
You took a little more, no lie
Can't let you go (are you satisfied?)
Can't let you go, no no, no (I feel good inside)
Can't breathe, can't sleep, can't eat
Can't live without you here
Baby, I can't let you leave

(Can't breathe, can't sleep, can't eat)
(Can't live without you here)

Baby, I can't let you leave

(Nothing I won't give to hold you here)
(I would never harm you)
(Don't ever let me go)

Can't let you leave, no
Won't let you leave, da-darling
You took it all, and just in case
You took a little more, no lie
Can't let you go (are you satisfied?)
Can't let you go, no no, no (I feel good inside)
Can't breathe, can't sleep, can't eat
Can't live without you here
Baby, I can't let you leave

(Can't breathe, can't sleep, can't eat)
(Can't live without you here)
