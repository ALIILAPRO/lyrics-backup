		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Riding down Santa Claus Lane

Vixen, Blitzen, all of his reindeer
Pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing, children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings and say a prayer
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Riding down Santa Claus Lane

He's got a bag that's filled with toys
For boys and girls again
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle
What a beautiful sight
Jump in bed and cover up your head
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Riding down Santa Claus Lane

He doesn't care if you're rich or poor
He loves you just the same
Santa knows that we're God's children
That makes everything right
Fill your hearts with Christmas cheer
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Well, here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Riding down Santa Claus Lane

He'll come around when the chimes ring out
It's Christmas morn' again
Peace on Earth will come to all
If we just follow the light
Let's give thanks to the Lord above
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight
