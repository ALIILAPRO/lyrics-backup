		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A grieving widow's pose, she stands with head held high
Never to re-marry, never gonna' try
'Cause that would end the symphony of sadness that we play
And the songs of wanderlust that she commiserates
So she takes another shot of Crown, it helps to ease the pain
In hopes to ease the void inside, yet somehow it's in vain
'Cause vanity has come along and filled her perfume vial [1]
And every day she dabs a little on her neck and smiles

Behind a mask (so we hide, so we hide)
Behind a mask (so we hide, so we hide)
Open your eyes, let us see the void inside
Open your eyes, let us see

The old man sits alone staring at the screen
And contemplates his failures, done to his family
'Cause depression's bottle's come along and filled his whiskey glass 
With every sip put to his lips, erases all the past
So he tells another little lie and tells another tale
In hopes to spare the family and hide his private hell
But the more the words come out of him, like little cuts and scabs
Tearing at the tender hearts who gaze upon a mask

Behind a mask (so we hide, so we hide)
Behind a mask (so we hide, so we hide)
Open your eyes, let us see the void inside

She puts her feet in well-worn shoes
Walks toward the past
Of the character
Behind a mask

Slowly climb out of your shell
Start to believe
Every now and then those demons
Will come to feast
On your flesh and bones

Behind a mask (so we hide, so we hide)
Behind a mask (so we hide, so we hide)
Open your eyes, let us see the void inside
Open your eyes, let us see
