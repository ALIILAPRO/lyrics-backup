		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where you at?
At my house
Let me see that ass
What you say?
I said "let me see that ass"
That ass
Oh, you on some naked shit
I'm on my way
Stop lyin'
I'm on my way, bye

I'm ashamed of all the things that I was doing for you
Should've known that all these girls the same and they ain't loyal
She a freak
Took her to Nobu, on a beach (yeah)
Just to eat
Louboutins all on her feet (yeah)
Where you get the money for them shoes, girl?
You hit me on my DM like a fangirl (whoa, whoa)
Did you want me or did you want these bands, girl? (whoa, whoa)
Now I know you just another Instagram girl (whoa, whoa)
She almost made me think that all she want is me (yeah)
I hit the club and she the first one that I see
Said that she there 'cause she know promoters in the club (yeah)
Come to find out that my homeboy hit her up (whoa, whoa, whoa)

All this ice, I need a freezer, mhm
Whip it up, egg beater, mhm
Whipping up two-seaters
Said she love me, don't believe her, mhm
Can't be mediocre, mhm
Twenty on her choker, mhm
Fuck her, I don't know her, yeah
Give me face, like poker
Whoa, can't believe I wanted you
Whoa, I can't believe I wanted you, yeah
Girl, I can't believe I wanted you
Girl, I can't believe I wanted you

No, no, no, no I don't need you (I don't need you)
No, no, no, no I don't need you (I don't need you)
Man, I swear these girls are see-through (translucent)
Stevie Wonder, I can't see you (can't do this)
She so hurt, I'm so irked, she get on my nerve (what?)
My head hurt
Matter fact, kick her to the curb (bye-bye)
Found out that she with him, like this verse, get murked (huh?)
My chopper, eagle dispersed, yeah
Probably die before it hurt, ayy
Cartier lens, I'm on lurk, uh
Twenty-thousand for a fur, ooh (yeah)
What would she do for a purse? (huh?)
She said she'll give me a Perc' (thirty)
My new bitch better, so I cannot sweat her
Don't talk to that girl, that's a curve (now what)
Speakin' of sweater, my neck is so frozen it looking just like an iceberg

All this ice I need a freezer, mhm
Whip it up, egg beater, mhm
Whipping up two-seaters
Said she love me, don't believe her, mhm
Can't be mediocre, mhm
Twenty on her choker, mhm
Fuck her, I don't know her, yeah
Give me face, like poker
Whoa, can't believe I wanted you
Whoa, I can't believe I wanted you, yeah
Girl, I can't believe I wanted you
Girl, I can't believe I wanted you

Uzi they, used to make, fun of you (dressin' up)
Yeah, all my hundreds blue
Whoa, little bitch, I'm done with you (I'm done with you)
Hit it from the back while Uzi stand in front of you (yeah)
23, but I had her when I was 22 (what?)
I can't wife that girl, she fucked like twenty dudes (brown boy)
You can't get a kiss, can't get caught tounging you (Lil Uzi)
I got lots of girls, no, there ain't just one of you (that true)
Off-White on my Prestos, all these girls I'm running through (I'm running through it)
I can't text her back, these Franklins what I'm thumbing through (blue hunnos)
Fuck a finger in that bitch, I use a thumb or two (yeah)
Made her number one and you ain't even number two

All this ice I need a freezer, mhm
Whip it up, egg beater, mhm
Whipping up two-seaters (skrrt, skrrt)
Said she love me, don't believe her, mhm
Can't be mediocre, mhm
Twenty on her choker, mhm
Fuck her, I don't know her, yeah
Give me face, like poker
Whoa, can't believe I wanted you
Whoa, I can't believe I wanted you, yeah
Girl, I can't believe I wanted you
Girl, I can't believe I wanted you
