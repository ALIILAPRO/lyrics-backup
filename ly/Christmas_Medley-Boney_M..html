		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Silent Night, Holy Night
Son of God
Love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at Thy birth
Jesus Lord at Thy birth

Jesus Lord at Thy birth
Jesus Lord at Thy birth

Snow falls over the trees
Still and calm is the sea
There is a hush o'er the land
Christmas is almost at hand

Peace alone reigns supreme
Like in some wonderous dream
You feel like newborn so grand
Christmas is almost at hand

Hear ye the message that comes from afar
up in the heavens there shines a new star
it's shining brightly and lights up the night
leading the way to a wonderful sight
no one is lonely and no one forlorn
'cause in the manger the christ child is born

Hear ye the message it's simple and clear
time for rejoycing is finally here
fore with the Christ Child there comes a new day
taking your worries and sorrows away
Bury your hatred and bury your grief
hear ye the message and start to believe

Let's keep the christmas bells ringing, not just one day of the year
Let's keep the christmas bells ringing, not just one day of the year
