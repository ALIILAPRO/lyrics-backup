		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In a burst of ecstasy 
I wanna get out across the sea
Lightning strikes in the distance
My sanity gone, nothing left

Still alive and I know
That your heart is still mine
Holding on to false hope
As the Lighthouse burns, burns to the ground
As the Lighthouse burns, burns to the ground
As the Lighthouse burns, burns to the ground
Burns to the ground
Burns to the ground
Still alive and I know
That your heart is still mine
Holding on to false hope
As the Lighthouse burns, burns to the ground

I dreamt I would never fall
But I'm falling fast 
You were the light in the dark
My way out of this hell

Still alive and I know
That your heart is still mine
Holding on to false hope
As the Lighthouse burns, burns to the ground
As the Lighthouse burns, burns to the ground
As the Lighthouse burns, burns to the ground
Burns to the ground
Burns to the ground
Still alive and I know
That your heart is still mine
Holding on to false hope
As the Lighthouse burns, burns to the ground
