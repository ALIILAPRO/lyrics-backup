		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me tell you a story
About a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend when she's around,
He feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken,
And it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
But did you know that I loved you
Or were you not aware?
Well you're the smile on my face
And I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy,
I'm here to see you smile
But I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while

Who's gonna make you fall
In love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let your
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

Well I can tell you're afraid of
What this might do
'Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't wanna lose it either
But I don't think I can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe
So take my hand
Well did you know you're an angel
Who forgot how to fly?
And did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry
'Cause I know that it piece of you is gone every time he done wrong
I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song, I figure out

What's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
You don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let your
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
Well I will catch you if you fall
And if you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

In love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let your
Let yourself fall oh baby
