(Push the button)
(Push-push the button)
(Push the button)

Busy throwing hints that he keeps missing
Don't have to think about it
I wanna kiss and
Everything around it
But he's too distant
I wanna feel his body
I can't resist it
I know my hidden looks can be deceiving
But how obvious should a girl be?
I was taken by the early conversation piece
And I really like the way that he respects me

I've been waiting patiently for him to come and get it
I wonder if he knows that he can say it and I'm with it
I knew I had my mind made up from the very beginning
Catch this opportunity so you and me could feel it 'cause

If you're ready for me, boy
You'd better push the button and let me know
Before I get the wrong idea and go
You're gonna miss the freak that I control

I'm busy showing him what he's been missing
I'm kind of showing off for his full attention
My sexy ass has got him in a new dimension
I'm ready to do something to relieve this mission

After waiting patiently for him to come and get it
He came on through and asked me if I wanted to get with him
I knew I had my mind made up from the very beginning
Won't miss this opportunity so you and me could feel it 'cause

If you're ready for me, boy
You'd better push the button and let me know
Before I get the wrong idea and go
You're gonna miss the freak that I control

If you're ready for me, boy
You'd better push the button and let me know
Before I get the wrong idea and go
You're gonna miss the freak that I control

(Push the button)
I've been dropping so many hints (push-push the button)
(Push-push)
You're still not getting it (push-push the button)
Now that you've heard everything I have to say (push the button and let-)
(Push-push the button)
Where we gonna go from here? (Push-push the button and let-)
(Push the button)

After waiting patiently for him to come and get it (push the button)
He came over and asked me if I wanted to get with him (push the button)
I knew I had my mind made up from the very beginning (push the button)
Won't miss this opportunity so you and me could feel it 'cause (push-push the button)

If you're ready for me, boy (for me, boy)
You'd better push the button and let me know (let me know)
Before I get the wrong idea and go
You're gonna miss the freak that I control

If you're ready for me, boy (push the button, baby)
You'd better push the button and let me know (push the button, baby)
Before I get the wrong idea and go (push the button, baby)
You're gonna miss the freak that I control (baby)
(I control)

If you're ready for me, boy (ooh)
You'd better push the button and let me know (ooh)
Before I get the wrong idea and go (ooh)
You're gonna miss the freak that I control
