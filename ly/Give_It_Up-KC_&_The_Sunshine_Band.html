		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody wants you
Everybody wants your love
I'd just like to make you mine all night

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, now
Baby give it up
Give it up
Baby give it up
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, now
Baby give it up
Give it up
Baby give it up

Everybody sees you
Everybody looks and stares
I'd just like to make you mine, all mine

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, now
Baby give it up
Give it up
Baby give it up
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, now
Baby give it up
Give it up
Baby give it up
Give it up

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, now
Baby give it up
Give it up
Baby give it up
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, now
Baby give it up
Give it up
Baby give it up

Everybody wants you
Everybody wants your love
I'd just like to make you mine all night

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, now
Baby give it up
Give it up
Baby give it up
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, now
Baby give it up
Give it up
Baby give it up

Can you give it, can you give it, give it up?
Come on baby I need your love
Give it up, some of your love
Come on and play the game of love

Everybody is on me, give it up ??
Come on baby, I need your love
Can I touch you, can I love you
Come on baby, baby, I love you
Can you give it, give it up?
Come on baby give me your love
