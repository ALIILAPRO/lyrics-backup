		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We were gonna go to Paris
We were gonna get tattoos
Told my mama I would marry you
Started building a foundation
Me, you from the ground straight up
We built our walls so strong no one got through

You tell me all the things I wanna hear
When I'm gone, you say you want me near
You look me in the eyes, say that we will stay for life
These feelings that we caught won't disappear

Of all the lies I heard
"I love you" was my favorite
I know goodbyes, they hurt
I need to hear you say it
One time before I go, whisper it slow
Of all the lies I heard
"I love you" was my favorite

Oh-oh-oh, say it slow
Oh-oh-oh, say it
"I love you" was my favorite
Oh-oh-oh, say it slow
Oh-oh-oh, say it
"I love you" was my favorite

You told me you and him were good friends
Known him since you've been at school
Told me I was overthinking like I do
You said I didn't need to worry
We'd get along 'cause he's so cool
Girl, you must've thought I was some kind of fool

You tell me all the things I wanna hear
When I'm gone, you say you want me near
You look me in the eyes, say that we will stay for life
These feelings that we caught won't disappear

Of all the lies I heard
"I love you" was my favorite
I know goodbyes, they hurt
I need to hear you say it
One time before I go, whisper it slow
Of all the lies I heard
"I love you" was my favorite

Oh-oh-oh, say it slow
Oh-oh-oh, say it
"I love you" was my favorite
Oh-oh-oh, say it slow
Oh-oh-oh, say it
"I love you" was my favorite

Of all the lies I heard
"I love you" was my favorite
I know goodbyes, they hurt
I need to hear you say it
One time before I go, whisper it slow
Of all the lies I heard
"I love you" was my favorite
