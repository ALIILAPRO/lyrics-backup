		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Diamond doll face
Dreamer girl
With the messed up coke teeth
Poppies and pearls
Wearing in my new cold sweat
Like some viewed up dead beat minor threat

We got the love in automatic
Bang bang, now hear me shout it
Shoot shoot, you better leave or hang on (hang on)
'Cause we got love's electric magic
Bang bang it's automatic
Shoot shoot, you better leave or hang on
Hang on to yourself

Hang on to yourself
Hang on to yourself

Friday black out guaranteed
Full of cocaine champagne
Enter the sleaze
The passion's black tar silver spoon
On a downer, baby
Fly to the moon

We got the love in automatic
Bang bang, now hear me shout it
Shoot shoot, you better leave or hang on (hang on)
'Cause we got love's electric magic
Bang bang, it's automatic
Shoot shoot, you better leave or hang on
Hang on to yourself

We got the love in automatic
Bang bang, now hear me shout it
Shoot shoot, you better leave or hang on (hang on, now)
'Cause we got love's electric magic
Bang bang, it's automatic
Shoot shoot, you better leave or hang on
Hang on to yourself

Hang on to yourself
Hang on to yourself

(You got to hold)
(You got to hold)
(Hold on now, hold on)
Hang on to yourself
(You got to hold)
(You got to hold)
(You got to, you got to)
