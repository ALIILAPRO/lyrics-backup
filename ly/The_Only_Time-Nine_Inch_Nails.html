		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm drunk 
And right now I'm so in love with you 
And I don't want to think too much about what we should or shouldn't do 
Lay my hands on heaven and the sun and the moon and the stars 
While the devil wants to fuck me in the back of his car 

Nothing quite like the feel of something new 
Maybe I'm all messed up 
Maybe I'm all messed up 
Maybe I'm all messed up in you 
Maybe I'm all messed up 
Maybe I'm all messed up 
Maybe I'm all messed up 
Maybe I'm all messed up in you 
Maybe I'm all messed up 
This is the only time I really feel alive 
This is the only time I really feel alive 

I swear 
I just found everything I need 
The sweat in your eyes the blood in your veins are listening to me 
Well I want to wrap it up and swim in it until I drown 
My moral standing is lying down 

Nothing quite like the feel of something new 
Maybe I'm all messed up 
Maybe I'm all messed up 
Maybe I'm all messed up in you 
Maybe I'm all messed up 
Maybe I'm all messed up 
Maybe I'm all messed up 
Maybe I'm all messed up in you 
Maybe I'm all messed up 
This is the only time I really feel alive 
This is the only time I really feel alive 

Maybe I'm all messed up in you 
(This is the only time I really feel alive)
