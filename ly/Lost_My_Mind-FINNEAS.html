		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're the sound of a song and I can't get you out of my head
You're the calm in the storm, you're the voice sayin', "Come back to bed"
Maybe I'm just too tired to keep runnin'
Maybe you're what I never saw comin'

Am I in your head
Half as often as you're on my mind?
If I don't make sense
Please, forgive me, I can't sleep at night
At least, not alone, not anymore
Not since I found what I never went lookin' for
And now you're in my head
I must have lost my mind

You're the scars on my skin, you're the past I don't wanna erase
You're the words on my lips that have left but I still seem to taste
Maybe I'm just too tired to keep lyin'
Maybe you're all I ever wanted

Am I in your head
Half as often as you're on my mind?
If I don't make sense
Please, forgive me, I can't sleep at night
At least, not alone, not anymore
Not since I found what I never went lookin' for
And now you're in my head
I must have lost my mind

There's an empty space beside me (empty space beside me)
And I'll keep it that way until you're here
I need you here
There was a different face beside me (different face beside me)
But I sent her away
'Cause you're not here, here

Am I in your head
Half as often as you're on my mind?
If I don't make sense
Please, forgive me, I can't sleep at night
At least, not alone
