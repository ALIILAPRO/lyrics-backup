		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time is such a fickle thing
It burns through everything
But it stops when machines fall in love
Life is such a simple thing
Gears and trinkets spin in sync
Then we rust and we fall from above

And like a comet falling to the earth
I'm burning up

Wildlife, you're burning bright
Like a phoenix from the ashes, you'll be born again tonight
Wildfire growing higher
In a forest burnt to cinders, there lies a city made of tinder

Now we're lost in this never-ending odyssey
Our journey vast and endless in this starry sea
An infinite blackness, a hastening madness is all I have to comfort me
And I will bare witness to the narrative illness
That's been plaguing my memories

Alchemist, give me a vessel made of gold
I'll set off in the morning on this voyage to uphold
The warmth in the freezing cold
The freezing cold

Wildlife, you're burning bright
Like a phoenix from the ashes, you'll be born again tonight
Wildfire growing higher
In a forest burnt to cinders, there lies a city made of tinder

Take my hand, we will walk to the edge of the earth
Where constellations overflow, we wonder: what is each star worth
I will wait at the edge of the world and take it all in
Above a sea of clouds where the air grows paper thin
I'm filling my lungs with cosmic dust, 'cus there's no breeze or wind
And I get light-headed when the altitude sickness starts to set in

Halt and catch fire
It's a balancing act, we ignite, we expire
Halt and catch fire
Each second I gravitate, in orbit I'll levitate

And I will find you in the dark
In chaos we resonate, in chaos we resonate

Wildfire burning away in my heart
It's here to stay 'til death-do-us-part
And this is how the fever starts
We go up in flames and light up the dark
Wildlife living in harmony
When the flowers bloom, they'll sing their melody
The seasons bring serenity
I'm wilting away endlessly

And like a comet falling to the earth
I'm burning up

Wildlife, you're burning bright
Like a phoenix from the ashes, you'll be born again tonight
Wildfire growing higher
In a forest burnt to cinders, the ashes linger

I will not evaporate
I'll burn brighter everyday
Like a moth to a flame, I found life in the light
And comfort in shade
I'm not one to hesitate as wildfire floods the way
We learn to swim but it's too late
And in the end we all evaporate
