		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Who don't wanna do nothing with they life

When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Who don't wanna do nothing with they life

When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Who don't wanna do nothing with they life

When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Who don't wanna do nothing with they life

When a fire starts to
When a fire starts to

When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Who don't wanna do nothing with they life

When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Who don't wanna do nothing with they life

When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Who don't wanna do nothing with they life

When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Who don't wanna do nothing with they life

When a fire starts to
When a fire starts to

When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Who don't wanna do nothing with they life

When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Who don't wanna do nothing with they life

When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Who don't wanna do nothing with they life

When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Who don't wanna do nothing with they life

When a fire starts

When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Who don't wanna do nothing with they life

When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Who don't wanna do nothing with they life

When a fire starts to
And it
And it
And it

When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Who don't wanna do nothing with they life

When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Who don't wanna do nothing with they life

When a fire starts to
And it
When a fire starts to

When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Who don't wanna do nothing with they life

When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Who don't wanna do nothing with they life

When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Who don't wanna do nothing with they life

When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Who don't wanna do nothing with they life

When a fire starts

And it
And it
