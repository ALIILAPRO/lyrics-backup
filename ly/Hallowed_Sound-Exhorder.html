		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Days of pain that leave your body shaking
Make you want to tear a hole right through door
Life will peak when rhythms speak
Steady courses end in better days, and you’ll feel the loa coursing through your blood

See the changeling, shifting and shaping
Always there, putting on a show

The hallowed sound from roots deep in the ground
No hurricanes or floods can keep it down

Face to face with troops of doppelgängers, never really knowing just exactly who to trust
Speak your mind, but mind your speech
When ladders give, you’ll lose your teeth
And it’s a long way to the bottom rung

You can fake it, you might even make it
But the damage that was done ain’t gone

It’s so laissez-faire
Just let it be
You couldn’t understand it if you’re not from here

The vestiges claimed before we came back- shame upon your pitiful pride
Can’t you look in my eyes? You fucking goddamn joke
Go take another toke, a line, a bump, your broken record skipped
We just flipped the script, we’ll take it back

Day to day, it’s keep up with the Joneses
And from the looks of things, I see you jones for more
Keep denying things of common knowledge
The spotlight shines on you forevermore

You can shake me, you might even break me
But you’ll never keep me on the floor

The hallowed sound from roots deep in the ground
No hurricanes or floods can keep it down

You can’t shake me
You can’t break me, you goddamn joke
