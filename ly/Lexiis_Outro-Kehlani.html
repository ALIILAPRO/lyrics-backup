		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh huh
Uh
Too much envy in the air
Jealousy over there, they energy hella weird
Gotta keep a distance 'cause them bitches slippin'
And when they do it every day, it turn to repetition
You will not catch me slippin', you will not catch me trippin'
'Cause my grandma go through summer with no air conditioning
So why the fuck would I let myself get in their position?
I try to tell 'em, "Get it right," but they don't never listen
So every time my bitches call about the same nigga, I answer it
As bad as I wanna cancel it, I gotta have her back
When she cryin' until she passes shit, huh
She always tryna get a glass, a sip
I told her, "This is life, you just gotta wake up and grasp this shit," huh
Ain't got no time to make no accidents 'cause you gotta be passionate
If you want something, you gotta go after it
And that's gon' make you the baddest bitch 'cause ain't nobody hand you shit
Can't nobody hold me back no more, huh
Yeah, look, and can't nobody hold me back no more
I've been on the right track so far
Don't even be texting 'em back no more
'Cause my mind on my money
These niggas ain't where it's at no more
I got that much, boy
And you got too many boys in your crew
You niggas got a lot of growin' to do
And you the oldest, you gotta be there to mold 'em into
Something bigger, something better
Problem with these egos now is everybody's shootin' free throws now
Misery love company, don't ever let these niggas keep you down
Matter fact, don't let 'em see you down
'Cause if they see you down, they gon' try to get up
They gon' know that you stuck, exactly what they want
So even if you fuckin' up, you gotta put on that front
You gotta act like you're on top, even if your shit sunk
I know this what you want
