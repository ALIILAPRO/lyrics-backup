		  (Great John on the beat by the way)
Know they plottin' on you
Look, I could spot a fake, look, look

Don't wanna see you winnin', boy, they plottin' on you
Look, I could spot a faker, he is not your homie
Look, don't know if they with me or they plottin' on me
Look, don't know if they with me or they plottin' on me

Huh, look, I don't trust a soul at all (soul at all)
Same niggas who kill you off, they cryin' at your funeral
Huh, look, boy, don't trust these bitches (bitches)
Focus up your senses, they up on you 'cause your business
Look, just 'cause she could suck your dick
Don't means you could trust her neither
Look, no bitin' and no kissin' neither
I got younger bothers that'll split your wig, they'll do you bad (do you bad)
Hollows hit you, leave you on your ass
We fiendin', hit your block, we bleed it, huh
Bitch, I talk to demons, I know you the one that's schemin', huh, look
So beat it, look, don't want no war with us (war with us)
Demons sayin', "Boy, you a savage, you been a warrior"

Don't wanna see you winnin', boy, they plottin' on you
Look, I could spot a faker, he is not your homie
Look, don't know if they with me or they plottin' on me
Look, don't know if they with me or they plottin' on me

Look, way before the rappin', I been drillin', but they know that (know that)
I ain't have to shoot you but I want to push the fro back (fro back)
I'm serious, my demons in my ear
Huh, make a move, I shoot this bitch up, I don't care, huh
Got me answers, zero tolerance
Bitch, I been too good to you, ain't show me no acknowledgement
Ladies see me, scream, 'cause they love me, want me inside of them
Huh, look, I leave 'em ponderin'
Niggas hate on me, watch me kill 'em with my accomplishments (look, look)

Don't wanna see you winnin', boy, they plottin' on you
Look, I could spot a faker, he is not your homie
Look, don't know if they with me or they plottin' on me
Look, don't know if they with me or they plottin' on me
