		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I think we're the brightest stars
And I try to believe we'll find a way
Will life change when our hearts turn colder? (Major Lazer)

All the rhythms in my heart lift me up inside
We can't stay out of trouble, is it worth the blame?
Is it true that the more you give, the more they take?
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say

All your love will make us ache
All your love is worth the chase
All my love, I know they'll let it find us
All my love's up on the mountain tops

All my love
All my love
All my love (hey everybody!)
Up on the mountain top

All the rhytms in my heart lift me up and say
We're just a mess of, broken people, but we love the game
I would do anything for us, it's worth the pain
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say

All your love will make us ache
All your love is worth the chase
All my love, I know they'll let it find us
All my love's up on the mountain tops

All my love (hey everybody!)
All my love
All my love (hey everybody!)
Up on the mountain top

(Hey everybody!)
All my love
(Hey everybody!)
All my love
(Hey everybody!)
All my love
(Hey everybody!)
Up on the mountain top

You're always on my mind
All throughout the day
Day where we can fly
Reach the glory haze, oh hey
High up in the sun and above the sky
Sun and above the sky

All your love will make us ache
All your love is worth the chase
All my love, I know they'll let it find us
All my love's up on the mountain tops

All my love (hey everybody!)
All my love
All my love (hey everybody!)
Up on the mountain top

(Hey everybody!)
All my love
(Hey everybody!)
All my love
(Hey everybody!)
All my love
(Hey everybody!)
Up on the mountain top
