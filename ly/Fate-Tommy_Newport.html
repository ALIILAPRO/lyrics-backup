		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You’re feeling good till you fall 
But it don't matter at all 
If you keep making these mistakes
Oh you 
You can give me the call 
but it don't mean much at all
leave it all up to fate. 

Well there's one door 
ever loving I long for 
maybe that's what i’m wrong for 
why is it that i'm stronger when I’m with you 
don't need to be the only one 
of us that's holding on 
why is it that moments like this 
pass on through

We’re running out of time 
but when did time ever stop us
don't know where we're going but
i'll tell you when to stop
  
You’re  feeling good till you fall 
But it don't matter at all 
if you keep making these mistakes, 
oh you
You can give me the call 
but it don't mean much at all 
leave it all up to fate 
I do 
You know I do 
Yeah I do 
Leave it up to fate with you

I wasn't leaving 
You were ready to go 
You slipped right out of the back 
At the start of the show 
So come on
Can you hear the words I’m saying To you
If either one of us pulls the gun we’ll lose
We’re running out of time 
but when did time ever stop us
Don't know where we're going but
i'll tell you when to stop
  
You’re  feeling good till you fall 
but it don't matter at all 
if you keep making these mistakes
oh you
You can give me the call 
but it don't mean much at all
leave it all up to fate
I do 
You know I do 
Yeah I do 
Leave it up to fate with you
