		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've always read my mind
It's like you've got my thoughts untold
Now I'm thinking with the light on
And we're not some perfect lie
You've shown me all your scars and I'm still learning how to show mine

But I wont let another storm scare me, no

Oh, even in the dark
I know all roads lead to you
Oh, even when I'm lost
I know what will get me (through) You can be my lighthouse shining Making it alright I'm home
When I don't even know
Oh, even in the dark
I know all roads lead to you

Sometimes I get stuck in my own head
I close my heart off and you call me out 
Standing like a ghost in the hallway
You know the right words now to calm me down

And I'm not used to letting someone else in
But I'm not scared of talking when it's you that's listening, no
