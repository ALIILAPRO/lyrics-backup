		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the dark of the night
Those small hours
Uncertain and anxious
I need to call you

Rooms full of strangers
Some call me friend
But I wish you were so close to me

In the dark of night
Those small hours
I drift away
When I'm with you

In the dark of night
By my side
In the dark of night
By my side
I wish you were
I wish you were

Here comes the clown
His face is a wall
No window
No air at all

In the dark of night
These faces they haunt me
But I wish you were
So close to me

In the dark of night
By my side
In the dark of night
By my side
I wish you were
I wish you were
In the dark of night

By my side
In the dark of night
By my side
I wish you were
I wish you were

In the dark of night
These faces they haunt me
Well, I wish you were so close to me

Yes, I wish you were
By my side
