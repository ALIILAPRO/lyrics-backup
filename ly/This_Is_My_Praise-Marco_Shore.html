		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was walking through the valley
In the night I heard your name
In the middle of my sadness
It's your love that changed the game

You turned my sorrows into dancing
You turned my troubles into peace
Your Love is everlasting
I found everything I need

I will follow you even when the paths seem to fade
I will look to you even when I can't see the way
I will trust in you even in my darkest of days
This is my praise
This is my praise

I will follow you even when the paths seem to fade
I will look to you even when I can't see the way
I will trust in you even in my darkest of days
This is my praise
This is my praise

Your Kingdom come
Your will be done
We praise your name forever
Mountains move
The Earth will shake
We praise your name forever

I will follow you even when the paths seem to fade
I will look to you even when I can't see the way
I will trust in you even in my darkest of days
This is my praise
This is my praise

I will follow you even when the paths seem to fade
I will look to you even when I can't see the way
I will trust in you even in my darkest of days
This is my praise
This is my praise
