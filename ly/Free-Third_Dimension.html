		  Running through the lights in my thoughts

Standing on the edge of my time

Everything I know will be gone in a minute

And that's alright



Running through the lights in my thoughts

Standing on the edge of my time

Everything I know will be gone in a minute

And that's alright



I'll write 'cause I'm free

I'm freer then I've ever been before, yeah

Baby I'm free

I'm freer then I've ever been before



I'll write 'cause I'm free

I'm freer then I've ever been before, yeah

Baby I'm free

I'm freer then I've ever been before



Running through the lights in my thoughts

Standing on the edge of my time

Everything I know will be gone in a minute

And that's alright



Running through the lights in my thoughts

Standing on the edge of my time

Everything I know will be gone in a minute

And that's alright



I'll write 'cause I'm free

I'm freer then I've ever been before, yeah

Baby I'm free

I'm freer then I've ever been before



I'll write 'cause I'm free

I'm freer then I've ever been before, yeah

Baby I'm free

I'm freer then I've ever been before
