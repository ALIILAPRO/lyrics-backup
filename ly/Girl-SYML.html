		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl
Perfectly her
Broken and hurt
Soft and asleep in the morning gray
Shake off the night and don't hide your face
The sun lights the world with a single flame
I want you to see this
I want you to see this

Today
And all of your days
I'll wear your pain
Heal what I can in your troubled mind
Sometimes our bodies will hurt for some time
And the beauty in that can be hard to find
I want you to find it
I want you to see this
I want you to see this

So run
Wake up and run
My little one
I wanna tear down these walls that can't hold you inside
And rip out the cords and uncover your eyes
We'll make our escape in the dark of night
I need you to see this

Girl
You'll see the world
And you'll come to learn
That falling in love is a strange work of art
All of your battles will shape who you are
And know that your scars are my favorite part
I want you to know this
