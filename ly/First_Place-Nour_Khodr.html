		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hurt it hurt me before
You said let love grow but not no more
You took time to grow
You stopped blowing up my phone
And now I'm low low
Loaded with emotions
Tryna find out how to cope
It cant be with drinking tho
I've been smoking way too high
Drank so much I damn near choke
Can't find your love in my skull
Think I need it
I can't lie
Love you had for me's no more
It's okay
I knew this would happen one day ayy
I can't lie
I just wish I never met you in the first place
Damn why you had to come and kiss me in the first place
Damn why we hada even mix it in the first place
Damn then we went ahead and slid into third base
Hey i wish I never ever met you in the first place
Damn why you had to come and kiss me in the first place
Damn why we hada even mix it in the first place
Damn then we went ahead and slid into third base
Hey i wish I never ever met you in the
Love
Love don't come my way
It don't come my way
Don't need to stay
Things I should've said
Things I wish I said I need to say
You always been my good love
And I always knew
If I leave find someone knew i still end up right back with you
A Anime, we watched anime till we can't watch
I can't watch no more, it reminds me of you way too much
We came way too clutch
Didn't know losing you'd be way too much
And I can't lie
I just wish I never met you in the first place
Damn why you had to come and kiss me in the first place
Damn why we hada even mix it in the first place
Damn then we went ahead and slid into third base
Hey i wish I never ever met you in the first place
Damn why you had to come and kiss me in the first place
Damn why we hada even mix it in the first place
Damn then we went ahead and slid into third base
Hey i wish I never ever met you in the first place
