		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Life is but a dream
Drifting on a stream
A stream
Consciously it seems
All of what remains

Ego brain
Man-made shame
Shame, love after it rains

You see my pain is real
Watch my world dissolve
And pretend that none of us see the fall
As I turned to sand
You took me by the hand
And declared, that love prevails over all

I am just a man
Fighting other man
For land, for land
While I turn to sand
In spite of the pain

Ego brain
Man-made shame
Shame love after it rains

You see my pain is real
Watch my world dissolve
And pretend that none of us see the fall
As I turned to sand
You took me by the hand
And declared, that love prevails over all

All of what remains

Ego brain
Man-made shame
Shame love after it rains

You see my pain is real
Watch my world dissolve
And pretend that none of us see the fall
As I turned to sand
You took me by the hand
And declared, that love prevails over all
(Love after it rains)
