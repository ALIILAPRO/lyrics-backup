		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  10 am, wake up too late for breakfast
No one here to check in with
I got so many habits, my habits
Clothes all over, messy with a system
Not bothered with opinions
But no one here to listen, to listen

Give me something that I can't resist
Someone to cause someone to miss
Are you that somebody?

I want you to make me hate being single
Make it feel like rainy days when I'm not with you
It's all about those little things, tiny little things
These little things you do
So good they make me hate being single

Show me alone means that I'm lonely
Make me addicted slowly
Every dose controls me, control me
Each kiss, must feel like a reset
Like you're the sun, you rule my seasons
Come on now and get even, get even
 
Give me something that I can't resist
Someone to cause someone to miss
Are you that somebody?

I want you to make me hate being single
Make it feel like rainy days when I'm not with you
It's all about those little things, tiny little things
These little things you do
So good they make me hate being single

Give me what I need
What I need to know
Give me the highs
Just give me the lows
Change my life
I want you to make me hate being single
Give me what I need
What I need to know
Give me the highs
Just give me the lows
Even for the night
Just one night
 
I want you to make me hate being single
Make it feel like rainy days when I'm not with you
It's all about those little things, tiny little things
These little things you do
So good they make me hate being single
I want you to make me hate being single
Make it feel like rainy days when I'm not with you
It's all about those little things, tiny little things
These little things you do
So good they make me hate being single
