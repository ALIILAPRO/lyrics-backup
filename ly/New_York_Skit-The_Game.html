		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo Game, you don't really tell that story about what happened to you and 50 huh?
Nah man, that's been so long, fuck that shit
Yeah, sometimes it's best to leave the past in the past
But y'all was such a good team, man, why don't you tell me?

Yeah, so basically, 50 was on Hot 97 and shit
With Olivia, Lloyd Banks and Young Buck and shit doing an interview
And that's time when I was kicked out of G-Unit and that was news to me and shit
'Cause you know, that shit was uh, like
That shit just caught a nigga off guard
And I think he was kinda hot 'cause I did a interview with Funk Flex a few days before that
Where I was talkin' 'bout, you know, his beef with Fat Joe and, and Nas and The Lox and shit
And I was like, you know, I grew up, you know what I'm saying, on, on Nas and shit
And I wrote, you know what I'm saying, I fuck with The Lox and shit
And Joe always showed me love when I come to New York
So I was like, you know, shit
I mean, I can't just stop fucking with niggas I've been listening to my whole life
'Cause this nigga mad at them niggas for the time being
So, um, he was hot, but anyway, them niggas on the radio, I got hot
So you know at that time, I was in New York with 70 bloods nigga
So we went to the radio station and shit, um, hopped in a bunch of yellow cabs and shit
Hopped out them motherfuckers and we walked up to Hot 97
Before we could get to the door G-Unit security was already coming out and shit
So them niggas pull out guns, so my little nigga Peanut pull out a gun and start bustin' shots in the air
So them niggas start bustin' shots, we start bustin' shots
Niggas runnin' in the snow but we got on fuckin' Converse
And niggas is slippin' and fallin', you know what I'm saying
And then, uh, fuckin' I think Jers got hit, Peanut got hit (ayy, I think they shot Peanut, Blood)
And Jers thought he was hit cause we hopped in the mo'fuckin suburban and shit
And Jers had fuckin' bullet holes in his North Face and shit
He was motherfuckin' whinin' and shit
I'm shot, nigga I'm shot
And shit, and I'm like, nigga you ain't shot you just got holes in your jacket
We went back to the W next morning, I got on a flight
Came back to LA, did 300 bars, and that was it (yeah)

Yeah, I remember that, you shocked the world with that one, bruh
Fuck it, man this light taking long as a motherfucker
Yeah, man, that's crazy man
That's how a lot people be gettin' shot out here too, 'cause long ass lights

Ayy, what's happenin' cuh?
What's happenin'
Oh, haha, niggas out here slippin'
Shit
Y'all niggas lost or somethin', homie?
Nah, we know where the fuck we at, nigga
Oh, oh so niggas pulling out choppers now?
Yeah
Oh yeah, that shit cute
Yeah
Don't worry 'bout it cuh, I know where them niggas gon' be at
We'll get them niggas later
Gas it cuh

See, that's what the fuck I be talkin' 'bout homie
Can't get away from this shit
Shit is everywhere
