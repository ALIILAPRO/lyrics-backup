		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hold, the passion
For many years, i would listen
The heavy weight upon my chest
Like a wailing wall

Code of silence of a dying heart
Don't know where the end begins and the truth starts
When the hammer falls it falls on you
I sit here waiting, waiting

I pull back the veil and I just can't breathe, UH
And I fly away, fly away
Like a song of yesterday

Freezing night an oil lamp burns
The suns fire, will soon return
Broken castles, the flags still flown
Like a living ghost

Code of silence of a dying heart
Don't know where the end begins and the truth starts
When the hammer falls it falls on you
I sit here waiting, waiting

I pull back the veil and I just can't breathe, UH
And I fly away
Break it down, so low you don't know where you been
Try a little harder, now you're the drunk mad man in jail

I fly away
Gonna fly away
gonna fly away
I'm reaching out
Like a song from yesterday
