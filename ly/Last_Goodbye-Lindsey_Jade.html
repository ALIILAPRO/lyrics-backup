		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  2 a.m. 
Lonely drive again
No direction 

cngry thoughts
Speeding through the stops
Imperfection
  
Two headlights appear, they're flashing 
cs metal collides, I hear clashing
c second too long for me to brake

Does it matter who is right?
‘Cause I don't wanna fight
Didn't have to be so heartless
‘Cause we don't know the time 
We'll say our last goodbye
ch-ah, ah-ah, uh ah-ah
We'll say our last goodbye
ch-ah, ah-ah, uh ah-ah

3 a.m. 
Wanna make amends 
Reconnection  

Hard to breathe
Pain is cutting deep
Retrospection

The silence is agonizing
Wish I wasn't uncompromising
c second too long for me to break

Does it matter who is right?
‘Cause I don't wanna fight
Didn't have to be so heartless
‘Cause we don't know the time 
We'll say our last goodbye
ch-ah, ah-ah, uh ah-ah
We'll say our last goodbye
ch-ah, ah-ah, uh ah-ah

The silence is agonizing
Wish I wasn't uncompromising
ch-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah

Does it matter who is right?
‘Cause I don't wanna fight
Didn't have to be so heartless
‘Cause we don't know the time 
We'll say our last goodbye
ch-ah, ah-ah, uh ah-ah
We'll say our last goodbye
ch-ah, ah-ah, uh ah-ah
