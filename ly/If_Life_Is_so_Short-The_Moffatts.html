Isn't it funny 
How times seems to slip away 
So fast 
One minute you're happy 
The other you're sad 
But if you give me one more chance 
To show my love for you is true 
I'll stand by your side 
Your whole life trough 

If life is short 
Why won't you let me love you 
Before we run out of time 
If love is so strong 
Why won't you take the chance 
Before our time has come 
If life is so short 
If life is so short 

Love is a word that explains 
How I feel for you 
And when you're in my arms 
All my dreams come true 
And when you're not around 
You can't hardly see 
These tears that I'm crying 
Now are for you to be with me 

If life is short 
Why won't you let me love you 
Before we run out of time 
If love is so strong 
Why won't you take the chance 
Before our time has come 
If life is so short 
If life is so short
