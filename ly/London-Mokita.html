		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Its been three months since I saw you
Just a few texts here and there
I saw you’re on a beach somewhere

I think I forgot to tell you
I found that list on my phone,
Of places in London you wanted to go

Those tourist shops around camden town
take a late night ride on the underground
See the gardens and drink warm beer
I know you would die… if you knew I was here

I feel so helpless and I feel so far away
If you knew where I was I wonder what you’d say
I feel guilty and I don’t know how to tell you
I saw London without you

Everything here makes me miss you
I can picture us
Still in love
Holding hands on a rooftop bus

I haven’t posted any pictures
Cause there’s a part of me
That still believes
Ill bring you back to these

Tourist shops around camden town
We’ll take a late night ride on the underground
See the gardens and drink warm beer
I would give the world
God I wish you were here
