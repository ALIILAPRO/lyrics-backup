		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As I open my eyes it’s just too hard to see 
I know it’s real as I’m losing grip on reality
I will never know if dying is an act of god 
Or do we even die in the first place

Narcan induced I feel like shit 
Locked in a pharma-psychosis 
Dead asleep but I’m wide awake 
They try to pull the plug but what difference does it make  

I know it’s hard 
To accept my fate 
You can’t run forever 
From the thoughts that keep on bothering me 

Can’t hide this feeling inside 
Cause you’ll be running forever 

Try to wash away all of my pain 
Feels like I’m running forever 

I know it hurts so bad sometimes 
But I’m forced to fucking feel
Every stab you put into me 
I’m toe to toe with my enemy 

Watch and listen as you force me to submission 
And I never know the ending of your personal vision and I 
I’m force fed the excess of content 
Where are the voices of reason 

Break my will to live 
And suffocate the cross to bear and force it into me 
And I’m begging you to pull the plug and end all my suffering 
The more I’m made to feel the pain 
The vultures are circling 

Can’t hide this feeling inside me forever 
How did I wake up and lose it all 
Now I’m left with all these questions 
And there’s something growing inside of my mind 
Instead i burned all of the contacts
Sealing my fate relieving the context

So rest your head the worlds gone to sleep 

Fail 

Think for yourself 
And wake up
