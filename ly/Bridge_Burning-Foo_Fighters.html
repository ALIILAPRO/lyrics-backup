		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  These are my famous last words
My number's up bridges will burn
Oh won't you let me twist your fate?
It's getting kinda late

And I don't wanna wait no more
Oh may I have this dance of days?
Locked in your embrace
You passed your test of faith

Another time, another place, another line upon your face
Another in your wake
Down crooked stairs and sideway glances comes the king of second chances
Now throw him in the flames

Whatever keeps you warm at night (whatever keeps you warm at night)
Whatever keeps you warm inside
Your bridges are burning now
They're all coming down
It's all coming 'round

You're burning them down
It's all coming 'round
They're all coming down
Your bridges are burning now

Oh let me put you in your place
Love it when you say, I'm giving everything away, but
Tell me what's in it for me?

Tell me now what's in it for me?
No one's getting this for free
So tell me now what's in it for me?
Whatever keeps you warm at night (whatever keeps you warm at night)

Whatever keeps you warm inside
Your bridges are burning now
They're all coming down
It's all coming 'round

You're burning them down
It's all coming 'round
They're all coming down
Your bridges are burning now

Gathering the ashes
Everything thrown away
Gathering the ashes
Scatter as they blow away

Gathering the ashes
Everything thrown away
Gathering the ashes
Scatter as they blow away

Your bridges are burning now
They're all coming down
It's all coming 'round

You're burning them down
It's all coming 'round
They're all coming down

Your bridges are burning now (gather in the ashes)
They're all coming down (everything thrown away)
It's all coming 'round (scatter as they blow away)

You're burning them down (gather in the ashes)
It's all coming 'round (everything thrown away)
They're all coming down (gather in the ashes)
Your bridges are burning now (scatter as they blow away)
