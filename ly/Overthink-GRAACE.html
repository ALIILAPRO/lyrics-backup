		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I overthink every touch
I overthink way too much 
I overthink every word 
I overthink everything I’ve ever heard 
I overthink every movement 
I overthink everything I do around them 
Mmmmm

So split split me in two
You think that I don’t but I love you
So cut, cut me in half 
You think that I don’t but I want you back
Mmmm
I want you back

I overthink every look
I regret giving him that he took 
I overthink every feeling
I overthink everything I do around them 
I overthink every demon
I overthink even when I’m dreaming 

Mmmm

So split split me in two
You think that I don’t but I love you
So cut, cut me in half 
You think that I don’t but I want you back
Mmmm
I want you back

How do I say that I love you more than I love myself? X2

But you loved the idea of me 
Never the real me 
But you loved the idea of me
But Never the real thing 
And you love the idea of love
But whenever it gets tough
You’re always giving up 
You’re always giving up 
How do I say that I love you more than I love myself?
