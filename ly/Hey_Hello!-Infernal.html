		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When will you be comming around,
Real men of my heart,
Not a boy, whose simply a toy,
No don't you even just start

Coz I've had to Cue true,
But that is not enough for me

So hey hello! bring me a hero,
Hello, hello I said,
I want a man, not just any will do,
Oh-no hello, hello
Hey hello, give me a hero,
Hello, hello I said,
I want a man, not just any will do,
Oh-no hello, hello

I tell you I'll be prowling tonight,
Looking for a man,
Not the kind who just with me for joy,
One who will understand

Coz I don't wanna be a lonely fool,
I need someone to conquer me

So hey hello! bring me a hero,
Hello, hello I said,
I want a man, not just any will do,
Oh-no hello, hello
Hey hello, give me a hero,
Hello, hello I said,
I want a man, not just any will do,
Oh-no hello, hello

I've waited for ages, for someone courageous,
To enter my life, and kick strat on me
Coz I need revealing, I'm sick of concealing,
The truth is alright I want you to see

So hey hello! bring me a hero,
Hello, hello I said,
I want a man, not just any will do,
Oh-no hello, hello
Hey hello, give me a hero,
Hello, hello I said,
I want a man, not just any will do,
Oh-no hello, hello

I've waited for ages, for someone courageous,
To enter my life, and kick strat on me
Coz I need revealing, I'm sick of concealing,
The truth is alright I want you to see
