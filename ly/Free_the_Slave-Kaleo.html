		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Meet me by the riverside later on the day
Gonna watch the hanging of an honest man
Say he ain't the guilty one but someone has to pay
They will not be pleased before they see him hanged

As he cries out
Turn and face the crowd as he cries out
No one makes a sound as he cries out
'Fore he hits the ground, he cries out
It's your spirit now

Find me in the river
Swing me from the tree
So won't you free the slave in me?

Leave me when the time is near, leave me be please
This is not the way you should remember me
Have you nothing else to say? Final words, the truth
Forgive them, Father, for they know not what they do

As he cries out
Yes, he can't be found as he cries out
No one makes a sound as he cries out
'Fore he hits the ground, he cries out
Where's your Savior now?

Throw me in the ocean
Pass me in the sea
So won't you free the slave in me?

Don't you know, oh, don't you know?
Whoa, they coming home for you
You can run, run on now
Oh, they coming home for you
Until you bleed, oh
Until you bleed, oh

Darkness is coming
Darkness, you should take shelter
You should take shelter
Darkness is coming
Darkness and hell

Is your conscience clear?
Have you seen the brave man hanging from the tree?
Say, who'll be the first to sleep?
