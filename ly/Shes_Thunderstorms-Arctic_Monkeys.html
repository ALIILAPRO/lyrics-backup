		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's thunderstorms
Lyin' on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms

I've been feelin' foolish
You should try it
She came and substituted
The peace and quiet for
Acrobatic blood flow concertina
Cheatin' heart beat
Rapid fire

She's thunderstorms
Lyin' on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
Here is your host
Sounds as if she's pretty close
When the heat starts growing horns
She's thunderstorms

She's been loop-the-loopin'
Around my mind
Her motorcycle boots give
Me this kind of
Acrobatic blood concertina
Cheatin' heart beat
Rapid fire

She's thunderstorms
Lyin' on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms

In an unusual place
When you're feelin' far away
She does what the night does to the day

She's thunderstorms
Lyin' on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
Thunderstorms
Thunderstorms
