		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yeah)

They say I'm trouble, they say I'm bad
Fire in my belly, so don't make me mad

A dirty no-good, down to the bone
I'll take that trophy, back to my zone

So I've got some mischief in my blood
My fashion's wicked? Hands off my gloves

They think I'm callous, a low-life hood
The times are changing, bad is the new good

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest of them all?
Welcome to my wicked world, wicked world

I'm rotten to the core (core)
Rotten to the core
I'm rotten to the core (core)
Who could ask for more?
I'm nothing like the kid next, like the kid next door
I'm rotten to the (core), I'm rotten to the
I'm rotten to the core

Long as I'm leader, of this lost isle
There'll always be a little evil, behind my smile

Don't double cross me, I'll get you hooked
You think I'm kidding? Just take a look

I'm not a sweetheart, I'm not your friend
But you better invite me, or taste revenge

I'm on the hustle, take what I can get
Show me the money, you ain't seen nothing yet

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest of them all?
Welcome to my wicked world, wicked world

(Gimme that)

I'm rotten to the core (core)
Rotten to the core
I'm rotten to the core (core)
Who could ask for more?
I'm nothing like the kid next, like the kid next door
I'm rotten to the, I'm rotten to the
I'm rotten to the core (core)
Rotten to the core (hey, hey)
I'm rotten to the core (core)
Who could ask for more?
I'm nothing like the kid next, like the kid next door
I'm rotten to the (core), I'm rotten to the
I'm rotten to the core
