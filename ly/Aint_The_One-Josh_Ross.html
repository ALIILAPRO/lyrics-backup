		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl, we keep breakin' up and makin' up and breakin' up again
How did we go from picture-perfect to the shape that we're in?
Was it that Gibson in a case, packin' up that Pontiac
Drivin' what felt like a whole world away
To be so damn close but so far to go
They say you always know when you know, well, I know

Someone's gonna build their dream come true
Hometown house with a West Point view
Someone's gonna hit their knee and plant those roots
Sweep you off your feet and fill your daddy's boots
Steal your heart, line your stars, hang your moon, light your sun
It's killin' me, baby, knowin' I ain't the one

Knowin' I ain't

The one that's gonna see you all dressed up in white
Waitin' in that car while you wait for two pink lines
Gettin' all the good out of our goodbye
And I get to be the one to watch someone else live my life

Someone's gonna build their dream-come-true
Hometown house with a West Point view
Someone's gonna hit their knee and plant those roots
Sweep you off your feet and fill your daddy's boots
Steal your heart, line your stars, hang your moon, light your sun
It's killin' me, baby, knowin' I ain't the one

Yeah, knowin' I ain't the one

To be so damn close but so far to go
They say you always know when you know, well, I know

Someone's gonna build their dream come true
Hometown house with a West Point view
Someone's gonna hit their knee and plant those roots
Sweep you off your feet and fill your daddy's boots
Steal your heart, line your stars, hang your moon, light your sun
It's killin' me, baby, knowin' I ain't the one

(Line your stars, hang your moon, light your sun)
(It's killin' me, baby) yeah, knowin' I ain't the one
