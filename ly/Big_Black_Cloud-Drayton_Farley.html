		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a big black cloud, follows me around
I run from the lightning, I run from the sound of that
Big black cloud keeps raining it down on me

That was two longs years and a lifetime ago
I was way too scared I was gettin' close
Here I am now, that was way back when
I was a younger man, no real plans
Then I leveled up on a couple of songs
I sing em every night and their singing along

They say a big black cloud, follows me around
I run from the lightning, I run from the sound of that
Big black cloud keeps raining it down on me

And it's all day long and it's all night too
I stay locked inside, it's all I can do
You know it's better in here than it is out there
Cause in here it's only me that ever has to care
I'll show my face when the coast is clear
I'm always keeping the pace but it's always near

That big black cloud, follows me around
I run from the lightning, I run from the sound of that
Big black cloud keeps raining it down on me

See if I care, just keep raining it down on me
See if I care, just keep ringing it down on me

They say a big black cloud, follows me around
I run from the lightning, I run from the sound of that
Big black cloud keeps raining it down on me
