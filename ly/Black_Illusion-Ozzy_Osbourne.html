		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You load the dice and paint the smile upon your face
With fingers crossed you switch the perfume with the mace
What kind of dreams to you enjoy inside your bed
I'll face the lies and shake the evil from your head

Black Illusion
Is all I ever see
Black Illusion
I bring you misery
Oh yeah
Yeah

You always seem to know the answer to it all
You seem to cheat the truth and never take the fall
Your life is hollow and you simply the rules
The time will come when you will join the other fools

Black Illusion
Is all I ever see
Black Illusion
I bring you misery
Oh yeah
Yeah

I load the dice and fake a smile upon my face
With fingers crossed I switch the perfume with the mace
What kind of dreams do I enjoy inside my bed
You'll face the lies and shake the evil from my head

Black Illusion
Is all I ever see
Black Illusion
I bring you misery
Oh yeah
Yeah
Yeah
