		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Am I'm sorry your sky went black?
Put your knives in babies' backs
Am I sorry you killed the Kennedy's
And Huxley too?

But I'm sorry Shakespeare was your scapegoat
And your apple sticking into my throat
Sorry your Sunday smiles are rusty nails
And your crucifixion commercials failed

But I'm just a pitiful 
Anonymous, yeah

I see all the young believers
Your target audience
I see all the old deceivers
We all just sing their song

Am I sorry to just be alive
Putting my face in the bee-hive?
Am I sorry for Booth and Oswald
Pinks and cocaine too?

Sorry I never check the bag in my head 
For a bomb and my halo was a needle hole
Sorry I saw a priest being beaten
And I made a wish

But I'm just a pitiful 
Anonymous

I see all the young believers
Your target audience
I see all the old deceivers
And we all just sing their song
I see all the young believers
Your target audience
I see all the old deceivers
We all just sing their song
We all just sing their song
We all just sing their song

"Valley of death we are free
Your father's your prison, you see"
"Valley of death we are free
Your father's your prison, you see"

I see all the young believers
Your target audience
I see all the old deceivers
We all just sing this song

Nanananana, nanananana
Nanananana, nanananana
Nanananana, nanananana
Nanananana, nanananana

You're just a copy of an imitation
You're just a copy of an imitation

(The president is dead)
(Let us pray)
