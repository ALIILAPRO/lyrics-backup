		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Chorus)
She Must of came from over seas or out my dreams 
Cause she the finest girl that I have ever seen 
And needless to say she got me speechless today
Ain’t never seen one chick that’s got everything I need
I don’t need accessories if you standing next to me
Never thought that any woman could ever be my necessity
Damn she speakin to me so sexually
Never thought that any woman could ever be my necessity

(Verse 1)
Never thought I would ever feel like I need somebody
From the second I met her felt like I needed her body
Ain’t seen a chick lookin better you must the one they copy 
An She must got her some cheddar, she pulled up in a ducati
Ain’t never seen a chick that ride a motorcycle
Takin you back to my home baby that’s my goal
Yeah She’s wifey material but freaky like a side hoe
I’ll bet all my ethereum that I’m goin all night long
I guess that you could say that I’m attached
But the feelings so unmatched it ain’t no cap
Feel like it’s every day I want that ass
It’s a wrap when I hit it from the back 

(Chorus)
She Must of came from over seas or out my dreams 
Cause she the finest girl that I have ever seen 
And needless to say she got me speechless today
Ain’t never seen one chick that’s got everything I need
I don’t need accessories if you standing next to me
Never thought that any woman could ever be my necessity
Damn she speakin to me so sexually
Never thought that any woman could ever be my necessity

(Verse 2)
I want you so damn bad I feel I need you now
She rolled up 2 zig zags while I went to town
She passed one back to me and that’s when it started to get loud
She say your magisty in fact when she go down I wear a crown
She a queen tho 
Fuckin on a king size mattress full of c notes
I let her take em home even tho I know she don’t need those 
She a self made chick mine as well be famous 
Gettin me so anxious

(Chorus)
She Must of came from over seas or out my dreams 
Cause she the finest girl that I have ever seen 
And needless to say she got me speechless today
Ain’t never seen one chick that’s got everything I need
I don’t need accessories if you standing next to me
Never thought that any woman could ever be my necessity
Damn she speakin to me so sexually
Never thought that any woman could ever be my necessity
