		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A broken heart, a pillow filled with tears
It was hot, babe, hot through all the years
Everybody needs someone to hold
Never thought that heaven can be cold
When you call me baby
I'll be there
A penny for your thoughts, oh to care

Lonely tears in Chinatown
Are too danger, dangerous
You can have this love for free
Lonely tears in Chinatown 
Are too danger, dangerous
If you're ready, go with me
His love is 
D-d-d-danger
D-d-d-danger
You can have the best for free
His love is 
D-d-d-danger
D-d-d-danger
Come on, take the rest of me

Tonight did what
It means to be so young
When two hearts are beating
Just as one
Our love can go a long, long way
There's nothing left for me to say
Nobody makes me crazy, like you do
Take the starts out of the sky for you
