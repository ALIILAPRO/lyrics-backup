		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Your love for me came as a waterfall
Flowin' inside me like never before
Your love for me, somethin' I didn't see
But baby, I know better now

When you walk in the room that very night
A special feelin' just burst inside
It was only you, nobody else
But baby, I know better now

Don't want to love you if you don't love me
Don't want to need you when you won't need me too
Don't want to tell you this now, but it wouldn't be right
If I didn't tell you this tonight

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And now you're back inside my house again
I'm tryin' deeper to explain
'Cause baby, I want to get it on
And baby, you're the one for me

But now that I have got you all alone
After all this talkin' on the phone
I should be strong, there's nothing wrong
I'll tell you this is where you belong, where you
Belong

Don't want to love you if you don't love me
Don't want to need you when you won't need me too
Don't want to tell you this now, but it wouldn't be
Right
If I didn't tell you this tonight

Don't want to love you if you don't love me
Don't want to need you when you won't need me too
Don't want to tell you this now, but it wouldn't be right
If I didn't tell you this tonight

It was just something in your eyes
That made me realize
But now I hear voices deep inside
Tellin' me, tellin' me

Don't want to love you if you don't love me
Don't want to need you when you won't need me too
Don't want to tell you this now, but it wouldn't be right
If I didn't tell you this tonight

Don't want to love you if you don't love me
Don't want to need you when you won't need me too
Don't want to tell you this now, but it wouldn't be right
If I didn't tell you this tonight
