		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm calling his phone up
Just to tell him how much
I really love him cause
He's everything I want
He listens to me, he cares for me
So I truly believe

God sent me an angel
Up from above
That's gonna love me for life
Might as well be perfect only because
It's the only way I can describe, so

If this isn't love, tell me what it is
'Cause I could be dreaming or just plain crazy
If this isn't love, tell me what it is
'Cause I never felt like this baby
If this isn't love
L-O-V-E, what is in me
L-O-V-E, oh if this isn't love
L-O-V-E, what is in me
L-O-V-E, oh if this isn't love

I?m selfish cause I don't
Wanna share him with nobody
Not even those
People that came before me
But see, I never believed

God would send me an angel
Up from above
That's gonna love me for life
Might as well be perfect only because
It's the only way I can describe, so

If this isn't love, tell me what it is
'Cause I could be dreaming or just plain crazy
If this isn't love, tell me what it is
'Cause I never felt like this baby
If this isn't love
L-O-V-E, what is in me
L-O-V-E, oh if this isn't love
L-O-V-E, what is in me
L-O-V-E, oh if this isn't love

So if you got real love
Lemme see you put your hands up
See you put your hands up
The kind of love that fits quite like a glove
Lemme see you put your hands up
See you put your hands up
If this isn't love
'Cause I know I ain't crazy
I know I ain't tripping
I know I ain't slipping
I know that is love
You see me with my hands up
If you think I'm dreaming
I know I ain't dreaming
'Cause this is the reason I love him because
If this isn't love

If this isn't love, tell me what it is
'Cause I could be dreaming or just plain crazy
If this isn't love, tell me what it is
'Cause I never felt like this baby
If this isn't love
L-O-V-E, what is in me
L-O-V-E, oh if this isn't love
L-O-V-E, what is in me
L-O-V-E, oh if this isn't love

Love, L-O-V-E
Love, L-O-V-E
