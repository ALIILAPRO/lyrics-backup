		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh oh oh yeah
Oh oh oh oh oh

Came in the door
Checked in my coat
And who I'm looking for
Is staring in my face

They played our song
We hit the floor
He held me strong
And we danced the night away

I can see the way that he is making feel
This way about his love
I've been looking for something like this
I'm saying ooh oh oh oh ooh oh oh!

If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Say oh oh oh, say oh oh oh!
If you go left right up down
Make you spinning round and round
Say ooh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh!

It's been a long long time
Since I fell, fell
Love has found my way oh oh oh
I've been looking (looking)
I've been searching (searching)
For the man to touch this place, oh ooh oh yeah

Can't deny the way that he is making feel
This way about his love
I've been searching for something like this
I'm saying oh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh!

If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Say oh oh oh, say oh oh oh!
Makes you go left right up down
Makes you spinning round and round
Say oh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh!

If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Say oh oh oh, say oh oh oh!
Makes you go left right up down
Makes you spinning round and round
Say oh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh!

If you feel good
If you're feeling good
Put one hand in the air, say yeah
If you feel good
If you're feeling good
It's 'cause love is in the air
Love is in the air

If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Say oh oh oh, say oh oh oh!
Makes you go left right up down
Makes you spinning round and round
Say ooh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh!

If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Say oh oh oh, say oh oh oh!
Makes you go left right up down
Makes you spinning round and round
Say ooh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh!

Come on and say...

Come on and say...
