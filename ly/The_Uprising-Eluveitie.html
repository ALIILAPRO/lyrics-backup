		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Our estates are under fire
Our villers fall prey to village
How can we stay on the sideline
How long will we tare this lying down?
Refuse to quell the anger
Time has come to take up arms again
The last call to rise up

Bestir
This is the flash of our last hope
Will you ally with us?
Wake up-open your eyes
Reach out
And seize this golden venture

We'vw lost our selves in strife
While the raptor unopposealy
Claws at gallia's free lands
We have to call a hate this
Unite the tribes and rise
Take a look around yourself
And see this time is ours
The last call to rise up

Our lands are under fire
Our villers fall prey to pillage
How can we stay on the sideline
How long will we take this lying down?
It is time to join forces
Let the eagles beak burst on our shields
Unitei this is gallia uprising

"Chieftains the eagles empire stretched out it's talons for our lands.
Bribing us. threatening us.
Today we are gathered here. all my countrymen. and still some of you
Hesitate.
You are'so solicitous about your state in the roman empire.
And while you fight among yourselves for Rome's favour an even greater
Vision is crying out to be seen:
A country of our own. A free Gaul let us stand against the eagle unite the
Tribes!"
