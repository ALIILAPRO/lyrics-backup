		  Yo
This how she move, elastic
Shine like diamonds in a casket
We be trending, but this classic
Shawty real pretty, curves flashin'
난 넘어져도 다시 뭐라던 고개 올려 항시
Don't touch me, baby
I'm covered with thorns 한 송이 장미

Got that base pumpin' (pumpin')
I do not whine I just suck it (suck it)
All these fake hoes fuck it (fuck it)
Throw it back then I drop it (drop it)
Skin so buttery, rub it in
All I gotta say is, "Run it"
Blast the stereo (pump it)
No touchy 'cause
I'm covered with thorns 한 송이 장미

Feel the heat 너도 느낄 수 있니?
달아올라 선홍빛, 달라지는 니 눈빛
I can show you how to please
I can show you how to lead
I'ma pull up with my team

Yeah, I'm getting addicted to power (power)
Stack it up make it a tower (tower)
He wanna do this for hours (hours)
He just want peaches like bowser (bowser)
And boy I want diamonds not flowers
Attitude sweet and sour
They singing my song in the shower
All you can get is a foul
You bitches are cowards
'Cause I don't fuck with a downer

Got that base pumpin' (pumpin')
I do not whine I just suck it (suck it)
All these fake hoes fuck it (fuck it)
Throw it back then I drop it (drop it)
Skin so buttery, rub it in
All I gotta say is, "Run it"
Blast the stereo (pump it)
No touchy 'cause
I'm covered with thorns 한 송이 장미

Feel the heat 너도 느낄 수 있니?
달아올라 선홍빛, 달라지는 니 눈빛
I can show you how to please
I can show you how to lead
I'ma pull up with my team

Turn up the stereo (turn up the stereo)
You're staring, just take a video (take a video)
I see your eyes roll
I am not your rival
Your fans say, "My shh, viral"
Flyest in this aisle
Flyest in this aisle

Pullin' up Louis boot, I strut (strut)
Everywhere I go eyes stuck (stuck)
Been planting now it's time for me to pluck
Slack, you better keep up (keep up)
Better have my money, I'ma chase you with a mop (mop)
Thud, thud, make sure you don't flop
Leave floor with no crumbs, no flaw (flaw)
Oh, hesitate push me to the wall
