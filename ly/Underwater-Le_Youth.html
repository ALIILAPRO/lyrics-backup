		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’m sick of all the space
So far from where I was
Not long ago your skin was mine to hold
I let you climb the walls
I took myself apart
Told me that you couldn’t love something so dark

So if the best of me, is all you care to see
Baby I’m asking you now…

If its death do us part, can you hold me underwater
Keep me deep in the dark, where my heart is yours to slaughter
If its death do us part, can you hold me underwater
Keep me deep in the dark, can hold me underwater (Underwater)

Can you hold me underwater
Can you hold me underwater

You didn’t hesitate
when we were starting new
Told me that there wasn’t one thing I could do
To push you far away
but when it came the time
To see my skeletons, you said it wasn’t right

So if the best of me, is all you care to see
Baby I'm asking you now…

If its death do us part, can you hold me underwater
Keep me deep in the dark, where my heart is yours to slaughter
If its death do us part, can you hold me underwater
Keep me deep in the dark, can hold me underwater (Underwater)

Can you hold me underwater water

If its death do us part, can you hold me underwater
Keep me deep in the dark, where my heart is yours to slaughter
