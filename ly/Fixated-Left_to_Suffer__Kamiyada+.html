		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuck
(Yeah)
I really really want to 
Dig a hole in my chest and stick your ass inside 
You can do anything that you want to 
Fixated at the end of the day it’s still mine x2

I’ve waited so long to feel the rain 
A plan for pain to say the least 
Undeserving open mouths to feed 
You make me sick you’re fucking weak 
You’re fucking dead to me 

It’s funny how all this played out 
Cause I just don’t believe in coincidence 

I know you’re somewhere out there concerned with nothing but yourself 

They want me dead 
Taking a leap of fate 
Your eyes are burning a hole in the back of my skull 
You’re so little 

Intoxicative seduction 

They won’t take me alive 
Beg for your life when you die

Fuck
(Yeah)
I really really want to 
Dig a hole in my chest and stick your ass inside 
You can do anything that you want to 
Fixated at the end of the day it’s still mine x2
