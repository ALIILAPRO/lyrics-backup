		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What a connection to make
And it gets hard to take 
Fast friend, split ends
With so many red flags 
Just makes you seem interesting 

What a connection to make
Expressions to fake 
Keep up the pretence 
With so many loose ends	
Just makes you seem interesting	 

Don't you think the way we met 
Is kind of unreal
I'd say for a reason	
		
Don't you think the way we talk is 
About all the real stuff 
I tell you everything 
I tell you everything 

What a house on fire
Crossed electric wire
A bat out of hell 
With so many meltdowns 
Just makes you seem interesting 

What a friendship shrine
Worship double time 
It's the way I think about it 
With so many undones
Just makes you seem interesting 

Don't you think the way we met 
Is kind of unreal
I'd say for a reason	
		
Don't you think the way we talk is 
About all the real stuff 
I tell you everything 
I tell you everything 

Are you OK
Are you alright
Let's just do something for fun
It's the way I think about it 
Are you OK
Are you alright
Let's just do something for fun
