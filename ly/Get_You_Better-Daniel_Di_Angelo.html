		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  French Braids
I like to pull on her hair when it's this way
She never fuck anyone on the first date
She got a real ass, but her personality real fake
That's real shame
No play, no games
When I go down on her, that's what she callin' a lunch break
I fall asleep in it, I don't wake up 'til the next day
We like to fuck from the first of the month 'til the rent's paid
But I
I'd like to get you better
Fuckin' all the time is wrong when you're not mine baby
I-I-I'd like to get you better
'Cause fuckin' all the time is wrong when you're not mine baby
On the low, when you take it to the door
I don't wanna let you go, then come fallin' for you
On the low, when you take it to the door
I don't wanna let you go, then come fallin' for you baby
Yeah
She got me feelin' some type of way now
I shouldn't let go of heart and a halo just
'Cause I've been sober and she's on an ounce
I've been fuckin' up the sound, partying around
I got bitches goin' back and forth to my bank accounts, really take 'em out
At a steak dinner, with their titties out
And I ain't playing with you, Imma fade it out
We should start up something serious and play it out
Think I'm done with feeling lost, like I faded out
Wanna pull up to the club, when my hand is around you
Babe, I'm tryna feel a wave when around you
Babe, I start to feel dazed when around you
I don't really wanna get played when around you
I
I'd like to get you better
Fuckin' all the time is wrong when you're not mine baby
I-I-I'd like to get you better
'Cause fuckin' all the time is wrong when you're not mine baby
On the low, when you take it to the door
I don't wanna let you go, then come fallin' for you
On the low, when you take it to the door
I don't wanna let you go, then come fallin' for you baby
I like to see when you move that body every day
I like to see when you move that body every day
Fuckin' with me, you gon' move that body every day
Fuckin' with me will have you riding a different wave
I want to see when you move that body every day
Fuckin' with me, every day is like your birthday
I want to see how your body's gonna celebrate
I
I'd like to get you better
Fuckin' all the time is wrong when you're not mine baby
I-I-I'd like to get you better
'Cause fuckin' all the time is wrong when you're not mine baby
On the low, when you take it to the door
I don't wanna let you go, then come fallin' for you
On the low, when you take it to the door
I don't wanna let you go, then come fallin' for you baby
