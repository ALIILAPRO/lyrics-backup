		  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh-oh
I, yeah, yeah

Another Tuesday and we sleep in 'til when it's too late
'Cause summer is whatever you say
So, I don't mind at all, at all
It's a new place if we close our eyes and paint a new way
'Cause somewhere is wherever you say
So summer turns to fall, oh

And when the days feel like the same old circle
We'll bend the lines and make a new one
Just to find the place where time is free
So, baby, come with me
As far as eyes can see
So, baby, come with me
And what is will be

And what is will be
And what is will be

You take a Wednesday and you make it seem
Like it's the first day of the whole-wide week
You got the PCH type of energy without the traffic, ooh-oh
There's never bad days when a good time is whatever we say
And the sun's shining
So, what's your E.T.a? 'Cause I just can't wait to go, oh

And when the days feel like the same old circle
We'll bend the lines and make a new one
Just to find the place where time is free (time is free)
So, baby, come with me
As far as eyes can see
So, baby, come with me
And what is will be

And what is will be, and what is
And what is will be
And what is will be

Ba-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da
