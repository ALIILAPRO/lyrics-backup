		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Last year I thought about
How things can come around
Just like that if everyone is here
To celebrate one day
We have our ups and downs
But when there's love there's always
A way, and, oh, this time of year
We come together to celebrate

Yes, every time the snow is falling down
And it is cold outside
We gather round the fireplace
And no one cares about yesterday

My favorite holiday
It means so much more than words can say
And I claim
That Christmas is a magic day
Sometimes I tend to forget
What glory this holiday represents
But it's better to say
That Christmas is a magic day

This year I think about
How I'm so lucky to have a place
That I can come home to
Yes, I am on my way
We'll put our differences aside
And just enjoy this moment
Of peace, and love, and happiness
We come together to celebrate

Yes, every time the snow is falling down
And it is cold outside
We gather round the fireplace
And no one cares about yesterday

My favorite holiday
It means so much more than words can say
And I claim
That Christmas is a magic day
Sometimes I tend to forget
What glory this holiday represents
But it's better to say
That Christmas is a magic day

Yes, every time the snow is falling down
And it is cold outside
We gather round the fireplace
And no one cares about yesterday

My favorite holiday
It means so much more than words can say
And I claim
That Christmas is a magic day
Sometimes I tend to forget
What glory this holiday represents
But it's better to say
That Christmas is a magic day
