		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Up and down like a red rubber ball
You're always back and forth like the clock on the wall
I want to know about you
I'm spinning all around you

If I stay do you think that we could change your routine?
I know a trick, I've always got a few up my sleeve
This life is controlled confusion
It's just a grand illusion

And you ask me "How do you feel when you're away?"
And you ask me "How do you pass the days?"

Sing along to a song that I know
It goes bah bah bada, sing it over and over
Let it hypnotize you
I'm still here right beside you

Hold my hand, you can follow my lead
You're like a ballerina twirling round on your feet
And watching is so fantastic
I want to ask you 

Would you come here and spin with me?
I've been dying to get you dizzy
Find a way up into your head
So I can make you feel like new again

Would you come here and spin with me?
I've been dying to get you dizzy
Find a way up into your head
So I can make you feel like new again

Now collapse, take delight in the fall and catch your breath
I know you feel the ring from it 
So try and collect yourself now
It's just a euphoric comedown

And you ask me "How do you feel when you're away?"
And you ask me "How do you pass the days?"

Cause I can still remember when you were afraid of the dark
And I told you to come and you followed where I asked you to go, to go

Would you come here and spin with me?
I've been dying to get you dizzy
Find a way up into your head
So I can make you feel like new again

Would you come here and spin with me?
I've been dying to get you dizzy
Find a way up into your head
So I can make you feel like new again
