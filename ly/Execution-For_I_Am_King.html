		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the shadow, behind the light
It was autumn, a cold dark night
A man was walking all alone
With eyes dark as death itself

He was tired and dull
Looking for a branch that can hold
His weight, like a leave in the fall
A rope was there to finish the job
He hung himself
Die
He hears footsteps approaching
Feels shivers down his spine
A teardrop is falling
As he feels the death approaching
The swing of the axe is the last
This is an execution

Everything went silent and even more cold
He woke up with a rope around his neck
The winter was here and the man with the crown
He hung himself
This is an execution
Die
He hung himself
