		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the garden there was you
And there was me everything was perfect
In between

I picture you in the garden
Back then when we started
Used to walk with God
Separating was the hardest
Before our departure when
We had to walk in shame before the deceit
When love was all remain
Before they took our history
And sold it back
Before they formulate a plan
Just to hold us back
In the garden where our dream was so intact
And i feel we have a room and i know in fact
The resonance is at an higher level
We try to spark up demand
We can never let the flame
Of the fire settle (show dem)
We'll ever taste the victory
Got independence but wasn't ready
For the trickery
Like vulture sucking up muammar gaddafi
Up in tripoli i wonder if he knew
Or saw the future vividly
How long this giant want dey sleep for
Promise the change
I wonder who dey keep score
The fall is harder
When the giant starts to stumble
I hate to see the garden
Slowly turning into a jungle
They talk say i be rapper
Make i chill and remain humble
But run away from demons
Doesn't mean they won't confront you
Never meant to take it deep
Just expressing a point of view
Realise this train of thought
Is only meant for just a few
I understand if your plans
Is to come and dance fine
So we back to the program
As we sip the palmwine in the Garden

In the garden there was you
And there was me everything was perfect
In between

I took my dream date
On a trip using imagination

In the garden there was you
And there was me everything was perfect
In between
