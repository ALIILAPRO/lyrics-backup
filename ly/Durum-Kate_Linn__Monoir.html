		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Clock is ticking on the wall
For you and I
Don't you wanna spend the night
And paint the sky
I'm crossing borders
Feeling high
You can't deny
When i look into your eyes
Time passes by

Love is, love is all around you
And sun goes up for you
Everyday i think about you
All i, all i want is you
Love is, love is all around you
And sun goes up for you
Everyday i think about you
All i want is

Dum,dum durum, dum
Durum, dum, durum, dum
Durum, dum, durum, dum
Durum, dum, durum, dum

Feelings stronger than a storm
No wrong or right
It's a story that is born
Right here tonight
All i want, you being mine
We love, we try
Falling deeper everytime
Complete me right

Love is, love is all around you
And sun goes up for you
Everyday i think about you
All i, all i want is you
Love is, love is all around you
And sun goes up for you
Everyday i think about you
All i want is

Dum,dum durum, dum
Durum, dum, durum, dum
Durum, dum, durum, dum
Durum, dum, durum, dum

Dum,dum durum, dum
Durum, dum, durum, dum
Durum, dum, durum, dum
Durum, dum, durum, dum
