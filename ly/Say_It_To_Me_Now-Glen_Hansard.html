		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Scratching at the surface now
And I'm trying hard to work it out
And so much has gone misunderstood
And this mystery only leads to doubt

And I didn't understand
When you reached down to take my hand
And if you have something to say
You better say it now

'Cause this is what you've waited for
A chance to even up the score
And as these shadows fall on me now
I will somehow, yeah

'Cause I'm picking up the message, Lord
And I'm closer than I've ever been before
So if you have something to say
Say it to me now, just say it to me now, now
Oh, oh, oh
