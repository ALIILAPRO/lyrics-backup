		  (This gon' be your favorite song)
I see 'em looking at my woman, oh
If they ain't lookin' I don't want that girl, oh
If they ain't lookin' I don't want her (If they ain't lookin' I don't want her)
If they ain't lookin' I don't want her (If they ain't lookin' I don't want her)
If they ain't lookin' I don't want that girl, naw

Yeah she bad ain't she?
Why would I wanna keep her to myself?
I know you mad ain't ya?
'Cause she only want me and no one else
I tell her put her heels on
So she can show off them legs
But even with her clothes on, she turn heads

I see 'em lookin' at my woman (I see 'em lookin' at my woman) yeah yeah
If they ain't lookin' I don't want that girl, oh
If they ain't lookin' I don't want her (If they ain't lookin' I don't want her)
If they ain't lookin' I don't want her (If they ain't lookin' I don't want her)
If they ain't lookin' I don't want that girl, naw

Bad bitches put your hand up (Hand up) I need to see you
Twerk, twerk it for a real nigga
If you nails done and your weave new
Never be raggedy kind you find in vanity mags
Hundred with everything on me rockin then shaggidy bags
PDA never shame when I kiss her step back like, "Look at that frame on that picture"
With yo bad ass, its her night no glad ass
Pretty face with a fat ass
In a dress straight from badass Tennessee
Who she going home with? You fittin' to see nigga

I see 'em looking at my woman, oh
If they ain't lookin' I don't want that girl, oh
If they ain't lookin' I don't want her (If they ain't lookin' I don't want her)
If they ain't lookin' I don't want her (If they ain't lookin' I don't want her)
If they ain't lookin' I don't want that girl, nah

If they ain't lookin' at my baby
Then it's something wrong with me
If they ain't hating on what we got
I'ma need a new woman
If they ain't lookin' at my baby
Then it's something wrong with me
If they ain't hating on what we got
I'ma need a new woman

If they ain't lookin' I don't want her (If they ain't lookin' I don't want her)
I see I can see 'em look yea
If they ain't lookin' I don't want that girl (If they ain't lookin' I don't want that girl)
No I don't want it
If they ain't lookin' I don't want her (If they ain't lookin' I don't want her)
If they ain't lookin' I don't want her (If they ain't lookin' I don't want her)
If they ain't lookin' I don't want that girl, naw
