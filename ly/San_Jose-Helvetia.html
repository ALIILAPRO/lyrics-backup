		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't remember somehow it's alright
Ignorance cushions my hand
Is it the weather?
Sound like you're doing fine
It's good to hear your voice
We've heard together
Somehow it just seemed right
Then I fucked it all up, again
Holy ghost, I've come to see so far
It's trouble knows no bounds
Oh-ie-ol-di oh-di oh

I don't mean to insult your memories
That thinks it wasn't okay
But I want to make amends with you
I don't claim to know what you will say
But I trust myself so how could I trust you?

San Jose, you curious kinds
Wake up and take control
You're more friends, know you can count on me
Even if I lose my mind
