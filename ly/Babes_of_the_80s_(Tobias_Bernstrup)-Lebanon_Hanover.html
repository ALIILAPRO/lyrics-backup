		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  These days it's crucial
To be silent and comfortable
The exploitation of humanity
They learned to accept it all
In my generation I will never fit in
I should be saint but I want to murder
Murder everyone

Babes of the late 80s
Why are you looking so rundown?
Without posture there's no movement
In my pathetic age group there's confusion
Go and section us into a mental institution
Because we dreamed of a revolution

You would fantasize about
The world elimination
I didn't agree but now I must say
At least you had imagination
People my age have no attitude
I should give in but I want to murder
Murder everyone

Babes of the late 80s
Why are you looking so rundown?
Without posture there's no movement

In my pathetic age group there's confusion
Babes of the late 80s if you
Could put on a frown
How can absence be improvement?
Ooh well, in my age group there's confusion
