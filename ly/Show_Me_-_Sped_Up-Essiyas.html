		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I tried to warn you that I'm going numb
Nights in the studio drinking too much
Emotions are fading it's fucking me up
Know you a homebody calling my phone cuz you say that you don't wanna meet at the club
Baby show me that you love me
Baby show me that you love me
And tell me you won't lie
Or put nobody else above me
Don't go tellin me you found somebody
They don't do it like me shawty
This is not the way I wanna keep on going
Too late we gon keep on stalling
Cuz I don't know if I can deal with all the drama
Hit my line then I'm picking up the phone
Baby show me how you want it
I'm being honest
On my mind and I'm losing all my focus
Just gimme time lemme finish what I started
I'm on the rise they gon see the way we balling
I told you that I got you
So don't stop
Do it how you want it
Wake up
I can't let it fade away
Baby show me that you love me
Baby show me that you love me
And tell me you won't lie
Or put nobody else above me
Baby show me that you love me
Baby show me that you love me
Baby show me that you love me
Baby show me that you love me
And tell me you won't lie, lie, lie
And tell me you won't lie, lie, lie
