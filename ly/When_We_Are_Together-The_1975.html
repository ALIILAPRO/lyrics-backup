		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Our first kiss was Christmas in the Walmart toy department
She said, "I should take you with me when I leave"
And we were searching New York for a fancy new apartment
She said, "Central Park is SeaWorld for trees"

You ask about the cows, wearing my sweater
It's something 'bout the weather that makes 'em lie down
The only time I feel I might get better
Is when we are together

I like socks with sandals, she's more into scented candles, oh
I'll never get that smell out of my bag
It was poorly handled, the day we both got cancelled
Because I'm a racist and you're some kinda slag

You ask about the cows, wearing my sweater
It's something 'bout the weather that makes 'em lie down
The only time I feel I might get better
Is when we are together, oh, together

I'm better at writing, was just a way to get you biting, oh
The truth is that our egos are absurd
I thought we were fighting, but it seems I was gaslighting you
I didn't know that it had its own word

You still ask about the cows, wearing my sweater
You said it's something 'bout the weather that makes 'em lie down
The only time I feel I might get better
Is when we are together
