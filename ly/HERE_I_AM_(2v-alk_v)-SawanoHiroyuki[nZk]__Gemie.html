		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yes, it's so ma-ma-magical
That can't be lo-lo-logical
Isn't it drama-ma-matical?
You know it's not tra-ra-ragical
Yes, it's so ma-ma-magical
That can't be lo-lo-logical
Isn't it drama-ma-matical?
You know it's not tra-ra-ragical
曖昧な返事で街が混んでると
答えを落としても 誰も拾えない
行き場もなく立ち止まった明日じゃ
手を触れないから 今のフレーズを
You＆I そのリフレインばかり
君は遠くで勇気をしまう
作り顔の鏡を見て 頷きはいらない
Now I got over the vice
All the things
I should do is clear
Getting close bit by bit
Heading against with fears
I still don't know what is good,
what is bad
What's real or what is virtual?
Anyway I decide how I'll live
So now I got over the vice
All the things I wanna do is
repainting them plain white
Then we'll get
the peaceful cheers
I still don't know
what's true for you
And what heroes
do or villains do
I'ma stick it out
Cuz I know that I never give up
Yes, it's so ma-ma-magical
That can't be lo-lo-logical
Isn't it drama-ma-matical?
You know it's not tra-ra-ragical
So what if my justice's
gonria hurt you babe
Can't we escape
from the conflict?
That makes me feel so numb
We could dream our time away
But doesn't solve nothing
負けたくないから I'm moving on
You and I have
had so different vibes
And I see myself
small and helpless
My heart was getting lost
But I met you guys, right?
So, here I am
Now I got over the vice
All the things
I should do is clear
Getting close bit by bit
Heading against with fears
I still don't know what is good,
what is bad
What's real or what is virtual?
Anyway I decide how I'll live
So now I got over the vice
All the things I wanna do is
repainting them plain white
Then we'll get
the peaceful cheers
I still don't know
what's true for you
And what heroes
do or villains do
I'ma stick it out
Cuz I know that I never give up

Yes, it's so ma-ma-magical
That can't be lo-lo-logical...
Now I got over the vice
All the things
I should do is clear
Getting close bit by bit
Heading against with fears
I still don't know what is good,
what is bad
What's real or what is virtual?
Anyway I decide how I'll live
So now I got over the vice
All the things I wanna do is
repainting them plain white
Then we'll get
the peaceful cheers
I still don't know
what's true for you
And what heroes
do or villains do
I'ma stick it out
Cuz I know that I never give up
