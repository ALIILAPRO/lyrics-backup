		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If life is a river and your heart is a boat
And just like a water baby, baby born to float
And if life is a wild wind that blows way on high
And your heart is Amelia dying to fly

Heaven knows no frontiers
And I've seen heaven in your eyes
And if life is a bar room in which we must wait
'Round the man with his fingers on the ivory gates

Where we sing until dawn of our fears and our fates
And we stack all the deadmen in self addressed crates
In your eyes faint as the singing of a lark
That somehow this black night

Feels warmer for the spark
Warmer for the spark
To hold us 'til the day
When fear will lose its grip

And heaven has its way
Heaven knows no frontiers
And I've seen heaven in your eyes
If your life is a rough bed of brambles and nails

And your spirit's a slave to man's whips and man's jails
Where you thirst and you hunger for justice and right
Then your heart is a pure flame of man's constant night
In your eyes faint as the singing of a lark

That somehow this black night
Feels warmer for the spark
Warmer for the spark
To hold us 'til the day when fear will lose its grip

And heaven has its way
And heaven has its way
When all will harmonise
And know it's in our hearts

The dream will realise
Heaven knows no frontiers
And I've seen heaven in your eyes
Heaven knows no frontiers
And I've seen heaven in your eyes
