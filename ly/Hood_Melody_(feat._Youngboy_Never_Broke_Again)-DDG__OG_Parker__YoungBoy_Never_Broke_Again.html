		  (G-got it on smash)
(OG Parker)

All of my young niggas losin' they life
'Cause they don't know it's life that is outside the trap
Niggas be tellin' us if we don't dribble the ball
Then maybe a nigga can rap
Niggas on the block, they be movin' that work
He got the weed, the coke, and the Percs
Nigga got a Glock, he don't wanna get murked
If a nigga try me, I'ma put him on a shirt

High off the weed, I can't even see
We killin' each other off shit from the earth
I got a blicky, I keep it with me
I never been shot, but I know that it hurt
Niggas killed my brother back in 2014
Streets know, but the 12 ruled a cold case
That was back in Pontiac, in my old place
Niggas never really make it to an old age
I gotta brin' my Baretta when I wear my jewelry
'Cause I do not know what they thinkin
Niggas be plottin' on me when I'm blinkin'
I be too paranoid, bitch, I be tweakin'
I be too paranoid (paranoid, paranoid)
I gotta move a certain way
Cannot be cool, don't feel a way
Not to be rude, but "Go away"

All of my young niggas losin' they life
'Cause they don't know it's life that is outside the trap
Niggas be tellin' us if we don't dribble the ball
Then maybe a nigga can rap
Niggas on the block, they be movin' that work
He got the weed, the coke, and the Percs
Nigga got a Glock, he don't wanna get murked
If a nigga try me, I'ma put him on a shirt

I know they watchin', emotions run straight out the sack
Protectin' myself in the trenches
I done came all this way
I grew strong from that pain and it hurt
Come around when they see me now
Know these niggas just wan' see me down
Came in, she was lovin' me bad
She got her a bae, don't wan' be with me now
You ain't right and I see it written all in your eyes
Tell no lies, y'all bitches wanna fuck with me now
I ain't make it home, then the sun go down
In the matter of some seconds, then you call my phone
And my past be the reason I ain't never slowin' down
Mastermind how to put another body in the ground
In the car, all alone with seventy-somethin' rounds
Put the Rollie to her ear, let her check for the sound
Ain't no tickin', I been standin' on business
Got it jumpin' out the kitchen
I'm a mechanic steady smokin' out the pound
Slimes with me, got a thirty in the glizzy
And you know I'm sippin', but gon' need another pint by tomorrow
Keep my fingers clean, got pre-rolls, I'm a stoner
They stepped on Elijah but they on the corner

All of my young niggas losin' they life
'Cause they don't know it's life that is outside the trap
Niggas be tellin' us if we don't dribble the ball
Then maybe a nigga can rap
Niggas on the block, they be movin' that work
He got the weed, the coke, and the Percs
Nigga got a Glock, he don't wanna get murked
If a nigga try me, I'ma put him on a shirt

Shorty was with me and I got her lit
But I heard she be hoppin' from dick to a dick
But I'm not trippin', I know how it get
I am not puttin' my trust in no bitch
Can't leave the crib without bringin' my stick
Got too much money, I'm rich then a bitch
They killed my brother, that shit got me sick
Soon as they free him, I'm gettin' him hit
Nigga I made it out
People had faded out
They never came around
Fuck what they sayin' now
Watch who you hang 'round
Keep you a thang around
Ain't no more swangin' now
Niggas just sprayin' now
I don't know shit, I ain't do it
I just rap, I influence
They just wanna know what I'm doin'
Made it out the hood, I'm coolin'

All of my young niggas losin' they life
'Cause they don't know it's life that is outside the trap
Niggas be tellin' us if we don't dribble the ball
Then maybe a nigga can rap
Niggas on the block, they be movin' that work
He got the weed, the coke, and the Percs
Nigga got a Glock, he don't wanna get murked
If a nigga try me, I'ma put him on a shirt
