		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's your name? What's your name?
What's your claim? What's your fame?
What's your name? What's your name?
What's your claim? What's your fame?

D-o-e, came out in the womb with the do-re-mi
I rock the brands in a Versace
Know who I am but I stay lowkey
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
Who the fuck is that? Bitch, it's me
I spit the pitch and I make the face
I am the huntress, I am the queen
I give a little kiss, kiss, kiss
Then I hit 'em with a twist, twist, twist
Then I give a little lip, lip, lip
And I hit 'em with the hip, hip, hip
'Cause I walk in the room and they know my name
I move to the groove and they know my frame
I post on the 'Gram and they know my fame
I walk in the club and they know my
They know my name

What's your name? What's your name?
What's your claim? What's your fame? (Hey)
What's your name? What's your name?
What's your claim? What's your fame?

Welcome to your love (what's your name? What's your name?)
Step into your destiny (what's your claim? What's your fame?)
Welcome to your love (what's your name? What's your name?)
Step into your destiny (what's your claim? What's your fame?)

When I walk in the club all the boys get sick
I drop the floor and I break this wrist
I walk to that boy and I twist this twist
Me know dem care, I blow dem kiss
I'm walking around and them things gon' drop, pop
Shake it all the way to the top, hot
Thirty inch weave to the floor like a mop 
And I bet you them girls gon' drop, pop
Rockin' to the beat, we rockin' to the beat
And breaking all the knees, we drippin' in designer
Workin' for the week, yeah, we can get it freakin'
Bottle full of liquor, litter than a lighter
I walk in the room and they know my name
I move to the groove and they know my frame
I post on the 'Gram and they know my fame
They know my name, they know my fucking name 

(They know my name)
I bet them jaws gon' drop, I bet them bra's gon' pop
(They know my name)
I bet them girls gon' rock, I bet them girls gon' drop
(They know my name)
I bet them boys will gag, I bet them boys will drag
(They know my name)
I bet the world gon' stop, I bet them girls gpn' flop
(They know my name)

Welcome to your love (what's your name? What's your name?)
(They know my name)
Step into your destiny (what's your claim? What's your fame?)
(They know my name)
Welcome to your love (what's your name? What's your name?)
(They know my name)
Step into your destiny (what's your claim? What's your fame?)
(They know my name)
