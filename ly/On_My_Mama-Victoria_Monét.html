		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When they say, "She get it from her mama"
I'ma say, "You fuckin' right"
Body rude, it's unpolite
Done being the humble type
Tell me, is you down?
'Cause I'm tryna go up tonight
Hoes and hoochies left and right
I just wanna live in a fantasy
I think we deserve it, right?
Top all the memories
I've ever made in my life
Permanent ecstasy
Ladies is pimps tonight
Living inside a dream
Let's lay where the lovers lie

I put that on my own mama
On my hood
I look fly
I look good
You can't touch my bag
Wish you could
I look fly
I look too good
Put that on my own mama
On my hood
I look fly
I look good
You can't touch my bag
Wish you could
I look fly
I look too good

On my mama (mama), on my hood (hood)
I look fly (yeah), I look good (good)
Touch my swag (swag), wish you could (could)
I look fly (yeah), I look good, good, good

I'm so deep in my bag
Like a grandma wit' a peppermint
They say, "Ooh, she smell good"
That's just 'cause I'm Heaven-sent
Sex game go stupid (ayy)
Snappin' like a toothpick (ayy)
Man, to tell the truth
Your opinion is irrelevant, but I
I know you think I'm fine
Might be too fine to hit it from behind
Reflection in the mirror don't decline
I can't even lie, lie, lie

I put that on my own mama
On my hood
I look fly
I look good
You can't touch my bag
Wish you could
I look fly
I look too good
Put that on my own mama (put it on my hood, ayy)
On my hood
I look fly (I look fly, I look good, ayy)
I look good (ayy)
You can't touch my bag (touch my bag)
Wish you could
I look fly
I look too good

On my mama (mama), on my hood (hood)
I look fly (yeah), I look good (good)
Touch my swag (swag), wish you could (could)
I look fly (yeah), I look good, good

On my mama (mama), on my hood (on my hood)
I look fly (I look fly), I look good (I look good)
Touch my swag, wish you could (I know you wish you could) 
I look fly, I look good, good (ayy, I look fly, I look good)
