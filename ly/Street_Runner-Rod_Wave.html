		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Pipe that shit up, TnT)
These mixed signals, mixed signals, they're killin' me
I don't know what you want, but I know what I need
The 'goodbyes', the 'hellos', the 'I need you' 'no I don't'
Every time I start to close the door, you knock and I let you in
Lovin' you is my greatest sin
Lovin' you is my greatest sin
Lovin' you is my greatest sin

I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I stay
Yeah, yeah
I don't know if it's worth it, babe

Look, uh
Sorry I missed your call, I was on a jet
I been so zoned out, tryna figure out what's next
So scared to fail, I'm calculatin' my every step (yeah)
Gotta watch my back and keep my strap, but nonetheless (nonetheless)
I think about you when I'm gone (yeah), wishin' I could hold you
Probably home, wishin' someone come and love you how they 'posed to
And I hope you see this letter 'fore it's too late (yeah)
I hope chasin' my dreams don't get in the way
I blame my struggles and my uncles for my hustlin' ways
I'm way in Michigan right now, lookin' at real estate
Lord knows I wanna lay ya down but I'm chasin' cake
Can't go back broke, stay on the go, that's all that's on my brain

She tell me fuck you, I hate you (I don't know why I love you)
Then I love you, can't blame you (I don't know why I stay) (blame you)
She say I love you, but don't trust you, can't change you (I don't know if it's worth it)
I just hope we don't end how they do (You know how they be on that front)
Crash and burn on The Shaderoom

Street runner, gotta stop runnin' sometimes (yeah)
I'm in your city tonight (yeah)
And these lights (these lights), make me feel so inspired (yeah)
Goin' higher and higher and higher (yeah, yeah yeah)
Takin' me higher (takin' me higher, takin' me higher, takin' me higher)
Higher and higher and higher (yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah)

Hey, I'm kinda glad that you didn't pick up (yeah)
I kinda just called to hear your voice, so 
Your voice recording was enough
Uh, I should hang up, what am I doin'? Um
So uh, I feel kinda dumb, but uh
I miss you, I've been thinkin' about you
And I've been thinkin' about our love and how much I miss your touch 
I miss bein' around you, hearin' your laugh and holdin' your hand
I think of you every day
I hope and I wish that you're doin' okay
I want us to go back to the old days
Because, I miss you, and I just thought of you, so I thought I'd call you
To tell you that you crossed my mind 
And I took that as a sign, that I should call and say hi
So that's all, hi
And I hope you don't think I've lost my mind, I hope you don't think I'm crazy
This message is gettin' long so I just say bye, but
The idea of you listenin' to this, the thought of you on the other side of the line
I'm in your city tonight
And these lights make me feel so inspired (I can't hang up)
You ain't higher and higher and higher
