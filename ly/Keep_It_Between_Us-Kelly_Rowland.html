		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say true love, is enough
Forever, forever
Then I'll stay here in your arms
Forever, forever
Not a thing in this world I won't give up
Can't live in this world, if I'm not next to you, to you, to you
Just a plain ol' girl, I don't need nothin'
They say I got it all, but they don't know that all is you, is you

So don't give your love away, away, away, away, oh whoa, oh whoa
And I won't give my love away, away, away, away, oh whoa, oh oh

Just keep it between us

Just keep it between us

Just keep it between us

Just keep it between us

Can't see myself, with no one else
No never, no never
I can make it through, the words with you
So whatever, so whatever
Not a thing in this world I won't give up
Can't live in this world, if I'm not next to you, to you

So don't give your love away, away, away, away, oh whoa, oh whoa
And I won't give my love away, away, away, away, oh whoa, oh oh

Just keep it between us

Just keep it between us

Just keep it between us

Just keep it between us

Know that I don't ever wanna hurt you
And I don't think nobody else deserves you
And I don't think I can see nobody else here with me
Promise to love you, and to cherish, and to nurture
And when the time is right we can take it further
Long as I know that you're here to stay
And never give your love away

Give my love away
I won't give it, give it away
I won't give it, give it away
Don't you give it away baby
