		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Better times are waiting for you
Filled with surprise just like a kaleidoscope
What waits ahead, you will never know

Every morning you wish this could be a better day
Till the rains pouring down from the sky and you sigh
“How come things never truly work out for me”
You want to make a change
See the sun rise and fall but everything is the same
Wonder how everyone keeps stepping up their game
This puzzle of life's right here for you
The missing pieces are hard to find

You know you really gotta take it easy
When you’re feeling lonely
Just open up your heart
I am right here for you
You know you better keep it simple baby
No complexity
You don’t know how much you mean to me

I’ll be the brightest star and light up the dark of the night
I’ll take you to the clearest side of the sky
Whichever song that makes you smile
I’ll sing it for you
No sorrow lasts forever and you’ll be alright
Cauz I’m lighting up the fireworks for you tonight
The missing parts of the kaleidoscope we’ll get ‘em back
The patterns’ keep on changing don’t miss a chance
To share your every view with me I wanna see through your eyes

Better times are waiting for you
Show the world your tender soul
Can’t you tell our bond is so strong
Take my hand you’re never alone

You know I’ll be the brightest star and light up the dark of the night
I’ll take you to the clearest side of the sky
Whichever song that makes you smile
I’ll sing it for you
But don’t you know how much you mean to me

Cauz you’ll be the brightest star and light up the day
The missing parts of the kaleidoscope are in your hands
The patterns’ keep on changing don’t miss a chance
To share your every view with me I wanna see through your eyes

Better times are waiting for you
(Just for you)
Filled with surprise just like a kaleidoscope
You’re never truly alone
Wherever you go
You will have my heart here for you
