		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In my head again
Lost with you
Don't let me forget
To bandage our wounds
As I'm bleeding out
Smile through the pain
What I'm feeling now
It kills me every time you fade
Spin a tale made of lies
Who gave you the right
To destroy the world around me
Through a mirror bathed in light
Who's on the other side
Someone I don't recognize
I can feel the rush
When I'm with you
See the setting sun
Leave stars around the moon
With a moment's time
Brought to a halt
As I realize
This never was my fault
Spin a tale made of lies
Who gave you the right
To destroy the world around me
Through a mirror bathed in light
Who's on the other side
Someone I don't recognize
Spin a tale made of lies
Who gave you the right
To destroy the world around me
Through a mirror bathed in light
Who's on the other side
Someone I don't recognize
