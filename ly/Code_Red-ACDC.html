		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Loading up the battery, raising up insanity
Beating out the old time blues
Crawling up the walls, sleeping on a waterfall
Belting out that tune

Strike one, strike two
Set your guns ablaze
Strike three, call emergency
You're gonna play it safe

Speeding up the road
Tearing up the Highway Code
Ain't gonna slow me down
No need to hesitate
Ain't coming up late
Hit the brakes, don't mess with fate

Hard fight, rough night
Dead in your sight
Fire light, fire bright
Fire in the night

Station to station
Yeah, code red
Battle stations
Ooh, code red
Weapons ready
Code red
Fire one, fire two
Code red

Now pay attention

Reputation on your mind
Enemy within your sight
Fire up, fire straight, fire free
Situation on the line
In the pale moon light
Run quick, run silent, run deep

Hard fight, rough night
Dead in your sight
Fire light, fire bright
Fire in the night

Station to station
Yeah, code red
Battle stations
Code, code red
Weapons ready
Code red
Fire one, fire two
Code red

Hey

Station to station
Yeah, code red
Battle stations
Code, code red
Weapons ready
Code red
Fire one, fire two
Code red

Hey, code red
Code red, hey
