		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [TT] 
Ooo here I am alone, thinkin' aimlessly
Seein' other girls in love & wishin' it were me
If I could only find the key & make love come my way
I would trade this loneliness for true love any day

[Both] 
When love comes knockin' at my heart
I'm surely gonna let it in
When love comes knockin' at my heart
Happiness will surely begin

[TT] 
Oh darlin', 

[MG] Oh darlin'

[TT] 
Oh darlin', 

[MG] Oh darlin'

[MG] 
Emptiness is in the air & all around me gloom
As I gaze through the window of my lonely room
I hate to get up in the mornin' 'cause I know what lies ahead
Where there should be a cheerful smile, there's loneliness instead

[Both] 
When love comes knockin' at my heart
I'm surely gonna let it in
When love comes knockin' at my heart
Happiness will surely begin

[MG] 
Oh if you've never been in love, darlin'
Then you're just like me, now

[TT] 
Don't you get lonely? What am I to be?
Oh darlin', 

[MG] 
Oh darlin'

[TT] 
Oh darlin', 

[MG] Oh darlin'

[TT] Oh darlin', 

[MG] Oh darlin'

[TT] 
Oh darlin', 

[MG] Oh darlin'

[TT] 
My heart's full of envy for the girl who lives next door
She has so many things that I've never had before

[MG] 
She possesses one thing I've never had a chance to get
That's someone to call her own & there's one thing you can bet

[Both] 
When love comes knockin' at my heart
I'm surely gonna let it in
When love comes knockin' at my heart
Happiness will surely begin

[TT] 
Oh darlin', 

[MG] Oh darlin'

[TT] 
Oh darlin', 

[MG] Oh darlin'

[TT] 
When love comes, I'm gonna let it in
Because I know I'll be happy then
Loneliness will be no more
When love comes, gonna open that door
When love comes, when love comes
Oh darlin', when love comes
