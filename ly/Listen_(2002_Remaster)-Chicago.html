		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Listen,
If you think that we're here for the money
You couldn't be right, you know(owowow)
But the bread is not too good here
It could be so natural
I said all you got to do is listen 

Listen,
If you don't hear what you can tell us
If it's good you can tell us all
Or you can smile, that's alright my friend
It could be so nice, you know
If only you would listen 

Listen,
If you don't understand it, no no no no
You got to try to fly
And don't you put me down, please
For creating beyond your mind
I said all you got to do is listen
