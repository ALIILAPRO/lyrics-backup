		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the mist of the morning, while the beast was asleep
Woke up with a plan so brilliant I could not believe
My mother and father, doctor and friends
Don't tell them, don't trust them, they won't understand

If you can't win the battle
It's better to run

Bury it down with my soul, down in my soul
Down with my soul, where they'll never find me
My bones
My bones

Way out in the garden, way out in the fields
So far from these civilized nations, their discord and deals
The birds, they all know it, they showed it to me
Forgotten by man, there stands an old hanging tree
Forgotten by man, there stands an old hanging tree

Its roots are still growing
But it died long ago

Bury it down with my soul, down in my soul
Down with my soul, where they'll never find me
My bones
My bones
My bones
My bones

Follow me
Don't follow me

(Follow me) When I was young I could perfectly see
(Don't follow me) Now I'm as blind, blind as a girl can be
(Follow me) Out of insanity into ecstasy
(Don't follow me) We all sin, so why am I so guilty?
(Follow me) And back to the trenches of the life I lead
(Don't follow me) This hole, the only place that I can be free
(Follow me) And out on the deep blue sea
(Don't follow me) Is where, is where I'll be, don't follow me

In the mist of the morning, while the beast was asleep
I carried out my plan, I carried out my plan
I carried out my plan, I carried out my plan
I carried out my plan, I carried out my plan
