		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jiggy jump to the beat
And keep bouncing
Thirty seconds and counting
Hot one, this choice critical
Situation is difficult
My caliber won't allow me to rhyme on a level where you people can hear me
See me, guess I know you want to be me
In the meantime bounce to the beat see

Music is my life
Cause my life is music
The beat of the drum in your heart

Let's dance
Like you mean it, can't you feel it, don't you know
Let's dance
Cause you need it, better believe it, here we go
Let's dance
Give your all when we're coming together on the floor
Let's dance
You know that you've got what I like

Check it down
Dropping verbal bombs on the beat
Hoping that you people think this sound is unique
Ccause I like to party
You like to party
Come on everybody got to get it started
I got something to get you jumpin'
When I kick a freaky rhyme I get the dance floor thumpin'
Just step back and take time to check
When I rock up on the mic you people never forget
So check it out.
