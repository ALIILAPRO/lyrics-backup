		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pretty fucking good huh?
So we all still having some fun here?
We got some sweat going on out there I fucking hope?
We like to see some fucking action going on
Who?
Yeah yeah yeah, that's where we fucking are man. don't forget it
Cerveza, man! eh?
Metallica, Metallica

Have some fucking Guevara
A little beer for my throat
A little drinking music maestro

Hey y'all can join in if you want

Hail Satan if you please.

I'm just kidding man

Maybe

That's Jason

And he's in a good fucking mood, so you better look the fuck out

So uh, I think he wants to play a little bass for you, is that alright with you?

No, I said is that alright? (shit, yeah!)

OK, let's have some lights there JD my friend. Alright!

So, how you doing Mexico city? alright?. I see a lot of my amigos here
How you guys doing man, how you guys doing? alright? yeah!

What can I say, uh, fourth night in Mexico city.
It's, it's a huge thing for us man, you guys, cause uh
We've been waiting a long time to come to Mexico, you know,
Like ten or eleven years or something
And uh, you guys have been waiting for us, right?
So I'm just glad you showed up to share this with us

Alright alright alright

OK one more thing man real quick OK

This show right here, all these lights and all this stuff man
A lot of people work really hard to make this happen for you guys
And for us every night.
If you get together with me, and make a bunch of noise for the road crew, yeah baby!

Alright, thank yo. Gracia. Let's have a good time tonight man, together . Yeah

Thanks a lot! Salute!
