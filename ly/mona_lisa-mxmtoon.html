		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've always played the part of shakespeare
I hide behind the ink and pen
I build up worlds and choose a savoir (savior, savior)
I write beginning, middle, end

I'm so tired of being a book on the shelf (book on the shelf)
Tired of stories for somebody else (somebody else)
Think that I'm ready to start a new chapter
I've been looking for some way to turn it around (turn it around)
Looking for someone to give me the crown (give me the crown)
And I wanna feel like I finally matter

I wanna be a Mona Lisa
Ah, ah 
The kinda girl that you can dream of
Ah, ah

And I always had the words but I don't wanna say it
Wish I could paint a smile on my face
I wanna be a Mona Lisa

So is there anybody out there
Who could change my point of view?
The way that van Gogh uses yellow
Or the self in Frida Kahlo
I could be that for you

I'm so tired of being a book on the shelf (book on the shelf)
Tired of stories for somebody else (somebody else)
Think that I'm ready to start a new chapter
I've been looking for some way to turn it around (turn it around)
Looking for someone to give me the crown (give me the crown)
And I wanna feel like I finally matter

I wanna be a Mona Lisa 
Ah, ah (be a Mona Lisa)
The kinda girl that you can dream of
Ah, ah (the kind of girl you can dream of maybe)

And I always had the words but I don't wanna say it
Wish I could paint a smile on my face
I wanna be a Mona Lisa

I think I'm ready for my close up, baby
There's nothing left to do
And nothing left to lose
Let me be your muse

Ah-ah (I wanna be a Mona Lisa, baby)
Ah-ah (the kind of girl that you can dream of)

And I always had the words but I don't wanna say it
Wish I could paint a smile on my face
I wanna be a Mona Lisa
