		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'mma slice you like I'm Ichigo, bitch you are rookie ah
Don't touch my shit, Imma blow up bitch
I got racks on stacks in packs I'm rich
If you ain't a goth bitch then get the fuck off of my dick
Bad bitch Valkyrae e-girl my fit
When I walk into the scene you know this shit boutta get lit
Yuh, might hit a lick, bitch I ain't a bitch
Run up to the boys, we know you gon' end up in a ditch
Somebody tell Doja Cat that I just got a bitch yeah
Brand new Bugatti, you know that I ain't ever switch
Got a goth bitch sucking on my red hollow tip
No cap, no snitch, Imma throw u like a pitch
Yeah she give me puppy eyes when she looking at my dick
I say "Hello" to her Kitty, before I put that shit in
Why you actin' so tough? Moving like a Slytherin
One knife to my back, and you might just win
I'mma slice you like I'm Ichigo, bitch you are rookie ah
Don't touch my shit, Imma blow up bitch
I got racks on stacks in packs I'm rich
If you ain't a goth bitch then get the fuck off of my dick
Bad bitch Valkyrae e-girl my fit
When I walk into the scene you know this shit boutta get lit
Yuh, might hit a lick, bitch I ain't a bitch
Run up to the boys, we know you gon' end up in a ditch
Imma slice you like I'm Ichigo, bitch you are rookie ah
Don't touch my shit, Imma blow up bitch
I got racks on stacks in packs I'm rich
If you ain't a goth bitch then get the fuck off of my dick
Bad bitch Valkyrae e-girl my fit
When I walk into the scene you know this shit boutta get lit
Yuh, might hit a lick, bitch I ain't a bitch
Run up to the boys, we know you gon' end up in a ditch
