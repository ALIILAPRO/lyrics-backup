		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I'm tore down
I'm almost level with the ground
Well, I'm tore down
I'm almost level with the ground
Well, I feel like this
When my baby can't be found

Well, I went to the river
To jump in
My baby showed up and said
'I will tell you when'

Well, I'm tore down
I'm almost level with the ground
Well, I feel like this
When my baby can't be found

I love you baby
With all my heart an' soul
A love like mine will never grow old
I love you in the mornin' 
And in the evenin', too
But ev'rytime you leave me
I get mad with you

Well, I'm tore down
I'm almost level with the ground
Well, I feel like this
When my baby can't be found

I love you, baby with all my might
A love like mine is out of sight
I'll lie for you if you want me to
I really don't believe your love is true

Well, I'm tore down
I'm almost level with the ground
Well, I feel like this
When my baby can't be found

A-well I'm tore down
I'm almost level with the ground
Well, I'm tore down
I'm almost level with the ground
Well, I feel like this
When my baby can't be found
