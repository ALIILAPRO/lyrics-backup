		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pray for me Father for I know not what I do
I am the monster, yeah you must have read the news
Don't know how it started but I know just how it ends
Pray for me Father 'cause I'm running out of friends

I'm runnin' out of time forever
I know I'm someone that they won't remember

It's gonna be a lonely night
It's gonna be a long and lonely night
Tomorrow is my last goodbye
So I'll be holy for tonight
It's gonna be a lonely night
It's gonna be the longest of my life
I gotta tell a million lies
But I'll be holy for tonight

What will I think of when I speak my final words?
What will it feel like? And I wonder if it hurts
I've just got a mile and I can taste the kiss of death
What will I think of when I take my final breath?

I'm runnin' out of time forever
I know I'm someone that they won't remember

It's gonna be a lonely night
It's gonna be a long and lonely night
Tomorrow is my last goodbye
So I'll be holy for tonight
It's gonna be a lonely night
It's gonna be the longest of my life
I gotta tell a million lies
But I'll be holy for tonight

It's gonna be a lonely night
It's gonna be a long and lonely night
Tomorrow is my last goodbye
So I'll be holy for tonight
It's gonna be a lonely night
It's gonna be the longest of my life
I gotta tell a million lies
But I'll be holy for tonight

Alright
Alright
It's gonna be a lonely night (lonely night)
Tonight (lonely night)
It's gonna be a lonely night (lonely night)
Alright (yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's gonna be a lonely night
Alright
