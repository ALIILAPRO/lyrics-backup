		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where do we go?
Where is our place?
We opened our eyes
And it's the same

And no one knows
(So it goes)
So we go on and on
And if it's wrong,
Then it's wrong
Living in the why not?

And nothing ever happened
And we were never here
So we make magic
Until we disappear

So we fall
And get up
And we lose our way
Get it back
And we do it all again

And we walk through the darkest 
Part of the wood
And we try to put out fires
We never understood

And nothing ever happened
And we were never here
So we make magic
Until we disappear

Until we disappear

So we make magic
Until we disappear

And nothing ever happened

So we make magic
Until we disappear
