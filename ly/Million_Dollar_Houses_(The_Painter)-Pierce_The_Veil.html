		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So what if I was just a painter
Painting houses on the rich blue coast?
Would you ever try to leave me
For somebody who deserves you most?
'Cause darling I am just a painter
I'm painting houses for the rich old folks
I'm gonna make a million dollars
'Cause nobody's gonna steal you, no
For diamonds and gold
For diamonds and gold

'Cause I've broken bones for you, and for you only
I make money but we just can't keep this home
Give me your heart and your hand and we can run
We can run, we can run baby, run now
We can run baby, run

She's like a bullet through an ocean,
I still remember how you moved so slow
You tried to kill me with a shotgun
Bang! Now we're even
We don't stop till someone's bleeding
(We don't stop till someone's bleeding)

'Cause I've broken bones for you, and for you only
I make money but we just can't keep this home
Give me your heart and your hand and we can run
We can run, we can run baby, run now
We can run baby, run baby, you're my hope

Permanently yours
Sometimes the moon looks brighter than the sun
As times like this run up my wrist
She hates all of the guts and blood
Splash around with me while we move like flames on burning sheets
And your doctor won't stop calling me her medication

But baby no, sometimes things don't work out the way we planned
To live is just to fall asleep
To die is to awaken
Maybe we're meant to lose the ones we love
But I'll fight for you till then
And if they stole you from me,
On my arm there's a tattoo of your name

I've broken bones for you, and for you only
I make money, but fuck money we want love
Give me your heart and your hand and we can run
