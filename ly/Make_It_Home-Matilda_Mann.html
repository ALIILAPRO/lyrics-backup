		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna open letters
I don't wanna pick up calls
I don't wanna walk the dog again
You know I hate the cold
I don't wanna go
To see the lights that
Shine on every street
If you're not here with me

I don't wanna wake up early
When there's snow and rain outside
Everybody's cheerful
But you're not by my side
What's the point in mistletoe
When no one's there to kiss?
That's not what Christmas is

Darling, tell me
You'll come get me
Say you'll make it home
'Cause Christmas isn't Christmas alone

I don't wanna wait forever
For you to get to me
'Cause everybody's strange here
But I guess that's family
And though the fire's burning
It's my favourite time of year
You're still not here

Darling, tell me
You'll come get me
Say you'll make it home
'Cause Christmas isn't Christmas alone

Darling, tell me
You'll come get me
Say you'll make it home
'Cause Christmas isn't Christmas alone
