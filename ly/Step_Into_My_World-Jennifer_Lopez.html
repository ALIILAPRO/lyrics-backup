		  Step into my world
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah
Woah-oh-oh
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah
Woah-oh-oh

Like a moth to a flame, you know you're drawn to me 
I know you better than you know yourself, baby 
Why do you try to resist what you want? 
Honey, I want you to give me what I need, listen closely

I need you to (hold on me)
I need you to (kiss on me)
Feel your body (next to me)
I want you to, I need you to
Want you to give (into me)
Want all of you (everything)
Ecstasy's what I will bring you
If you just

Step into my world
Where there's countless things to see
Endless possibilities
Let me take you to a place where desires flow deep
See an odyssey of dreams
And the best of fantasies
All this for your eyes only
Ooh, step into my world

Close your eyes and let your feelings now take over 
It's alright, I'm intoxicating you though you're sober 
You inside, the thought alone is so overbearing 
Boy tonight, You just follow my lead from here and

I need you to (hold on me)
I need you to (kiss on me)
Feel your body (next to me)
I want you to, I need you to
Want you to give (into me)
Want all of you (everything)
Ecstasy's what I will bring you
If you just

Step into my world
Where there's countless things to see
Endless possibilities
Let me take you to a place where desires flow deep
See an odyssey of dreams
And the best of fantasies
All this for your eyes only
Ooh, step into my world

Where there's no reality
Time itself means nothing
It's so hypnotizing
It brings you to a state of natural high
See how my words, they get to you
Creates the the lift that's haunting you
Yes, that's it, hold on to it
Ooh, welcome to my world

My world
Where desires flow deep
Fantasies

Ooh, step into my world (step into my world)
Where there's countless things to see
Endless possibilities (oh-oh-oh)
Let me take you to a place where desires flow deep
See an odyssey of dreams (odyssey of dreams)
And the best of fantasies
All this for your eyes only
Ooh, step into my world (step into my world)

Oh, oh
Woah-oh-oh
Oh, oh
Woah-oh-oh
