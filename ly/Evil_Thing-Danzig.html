		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I serve my perdition
In this private hell
A thousand angers
Have kept me alive
Carve a hole in your distorted soul
I'm here to bang it
Yea

The blessing is a curse
Seduction and thirst
Feeds the hunger

Take a little caution
When you look my way
See the emptiness in my eyes
And the evil thing
That I bring
Soulless light
Yea

Warning is come upon your heels
Feel your dreams slip away
Take a little caution
In the dead of night
Let the darkness rise again

Want the needing
Want to feel you near

Want you
Need your
Life
Want you, need your
Life
Feed it to me

Yea
Blessing is a curse
Seduction and thirst
Feeds the hunger

Take a little caution
When you look my way
See the emptiness in my eyes

Yea
Yea
Want the needing
Want to feel you near
Want your soul

Want your
Need your
Life
Want you, need your
Life, yea
