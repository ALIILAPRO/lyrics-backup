		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I was a cradle, would you let me rock?
If I was a pony, would you let me trot?
If I was an atom, swimmin' in the trees,
If I go out my cell phone's dead would you put you dogs on me? 

If I was a baby, would you let me fall?
If I was an outlaw, would you have me caught?
If I was a tiger, would you have me caged?
If I was somebody else, would you act your age?

You'll miss out if you're, getting high, no thank you.
Pray it doesn't happen, this time I'll make you see it.
You and I gotta say, this is about me and you, yeah.

If I was a nightlight, would you let me see?
If I was anchor, it'd be news to me.
I was a maybe, giving you next call,
If I tell you the truth now baby,
Listen when I talk!

Then I saw
