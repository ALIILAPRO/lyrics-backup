		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw you laughin' in one of his pictures
Bet you'll be the one with his ring on your finger
There's red and green everywhere but I'm so blue
Cindy Lou Who
Maybe he met you somewhere in the desert
While he was soul searchin', he found someone better
Guess you make him happy like I couldn't do
Cindy Lou Who

Ooh
With your hair so long, lips so red
Ooh
Maybe we met once, I forget
Ooh
Scrollin' five years back, I'm obsessed
Breakin' my heart, 'tis the season, I guess

Ooh
With your hair so long, lips so red
Ooh
If you're waking up now, in his old bed
Ooh
At his family's house, know you're just
Breakin' my heart, 'tis the season, I guess

The snow's gonna fallin' and the trees gonna glistenin'
And I'm gonna puke at the thought of you kissin'
The boy who I love is now in love with you
Cindy Lou Who
I told all my friends, they said, "It can't be true"
Cindy Lou Who
