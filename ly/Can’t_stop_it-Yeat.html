Bag after bag after bag, I can't stop
Yerc after Perc' after Yerc, I can't stop
Hopped inside the Cayenne, boot it up and then I fly
On the phone with my demon, we build it up and then retire
Toxic, toxic, yeah, came in that bitch and we fired
Walk on the muhfuckin' ceiling, I'm bootin' up, baby, the air make me fly
Yeah, they gon' copy my trend, they gon' copy my side, they gon' copy the guy
I would go get me more money, more money, more money, more money, oh, damn

I bought a crib in the sky (yeah, whoa)
Twenty-four seven, this bitch 'bout to die (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Suckin' and lickin', more junky', more bankin'
I run up this bitch with the big ol' tanky
The big body whip, 'bout to pull out, yeah
'bout to sewrve on the side, 'bout to pull up and crank it
I'm gonna pull up the tank
I got the big ol' whips, got the big ol' Glocks
Got the big ol' stick with a binkie
You gon' get whacked, you gon' get whacked like a spanking
I been swervin' on this Earth
Diamonds in my pinkie, yeah, the diamonds on my hair
Don't know why I did this shit, just heard it, then I do it
I don't like all that talkin' back and forth, just keep it murmur
Bye-bye, huh, fuckin' swerve
Yeah, I learned my lesson, for these jakes, I see they shwerms
Thought you was gon' get eat up like a fish get eaten by worm
R-I-P to the Dub man, they gon' try to get that on serve

Bag after bag after bag, I can't stop
Yerc after Perc' after Yerc, I can't stop
Hopped inside the Cayenne, boot it up and then I fly
On the phone with my demon, we build it up and then retire
Toxic, toxic, yeah, came in that bitch and we fired
Walk on the muhfuckin' ceiling, I'm bootin' up, baby, the air make me fly
Yeah, they gon' copy my trend, they gon' copy my side, they gon' copy the guy
I would go get me more money, more money, more money, more money, oh, damn
