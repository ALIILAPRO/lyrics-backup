		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  With every single kiss
I'm going to slit my wrist
With every single cry
I'm going to say goodbye
Goodbye
Slit my wrist

When you see me in the street don't masturbate just let me go
Under the covers think of another I won't be there let me go
You'll never have me it's a sad day in your own mind let me go
I'm not a real man I'm a figment of your imagination whoa just let me go
Whoa just let me go

With every single kiss I'm going to slit my wrist
With every single tear I'm going to say goodbye, my dear
Slit my wrist

Whoa just let me go[x2]
With every single kiss I'm going to slit my wrist
With every single cry I'm going to say goodbye
Goodbye
Slit my wrist
