		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where do you go
When your tides get low
In the summer dress
Of your drunkenness

I go far from here
Where the silence sleeps
In the very deeps
Of the holy blue

And I dream of you
And I dream of you
Dream of you
Dream of you

What do you say
When the rotted day
Is around your feet
In the noisy street

And your eyes fall rain
From pain from pain
I say never again
Never again
Never again

Why do you wander
So light though falling
In the underwater calling

I skate like a bird
Drunk on a word
Almost in love
If I only knew

But the best will drive
Through me and you
Me and you
Me and you
