		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every day the show goes on
In the underground ground
On the stage a song replays
And it travels down down

Down to the recesses of your nightmares
Find me waiting there or are you too scared
Rest in peace is not for me it's not fair
So welcome to the show

Dead but not buried
You're screaming it's alive
When my claws get a grip and you see me in the night
I'm dead but not buried
Remnant of his mistakes
Ignited by revenge till this metal body breaks
Oh oh oh

A carnival of angry souls
That can never come home
They are the only friends I have
And we all want you to go

Down to the recesses of your nightmares
Find me waiting there or are you too scared
Rest in peace is not for me it's not fair
So welcome to the show

Dead but not buried
You're screaming it's alive
When my claws get a grip and you see me in the night
I'm dead but not buried
Remnant of his mistakes
Ignited by revenge till this metal body breaks
Oh oh oh

I'm dead but not buried
Oh oh oh
I'm dead but not buried
Oh oh oh

Restless and the show must go on
It's always a fun time in the shadows
In the silence I can hear your pulse
It's beat will stop when I make it hollow

Dead but not buried
You're screaming it's alive
When my claws get a grip and you see me in the night
I'm dead but not buried
Remnant of his mistakes
Ignited by revenge till this metal body breaks

Dead but not buried
You're screaming it's alive
When my claws get a grip and you see me in the night
I'm dead but not buried
Remnant of his mistakes
Ignited by revenge till this metal body breaks
Oh oh oh

I'm dead but not buried
Oh oh oh
I'm dead but not buried
Oh oh oh
