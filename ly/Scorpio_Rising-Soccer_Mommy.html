		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Kissed you in the park
We'll meet up after dark
In your car with the backseat, southern summer
Ignored all the missed calls from your mother
And kiss me in the park
We'll meet up after dark
And we'll talk until mornin' hits the windshield
And paints yellow lines on the field

Now you want to start
With someone not so far
Oh, she's bubbly and sweet like a Coca-Cola
I watch from my drink as you look her over
The tab don't pop too hard
You're sick of playing cards
With your love, you want warmth and I'm somethin' colder
I'm putting your hands to her heart

I don't think of my life
Anywhere but in your arms tonight
Won't say it this time
Can't even look back in your eyes

Kissed you in the park
We'll meet up after dark
It's a bite of the apple, the touch of your lips
I'm stuck in the bathroom and sick over it
'Cause you're made from the stars
That we watched from your car
And I'm just a victim of changing planets
My Scorpio rising and my parents

I don't think of my life
Anywhere but in your arms tonight
I won't say it this time
Can't even look back in your eyes
