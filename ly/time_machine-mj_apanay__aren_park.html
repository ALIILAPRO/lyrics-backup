		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Starin' at stars
Watching the moon
Hoping that one day they'll lead me to you
Wait every night
'Cause if a star falls
I'll wish to go back to the times that I loved

Why do the stars shine so bright in the sky
If most of the people are sleeping at night
Why do we only have one chance at life
I wish I could go back in time

Pictures remind me of things I forgot
But also of all of the things that I've lost
Can't get them back, they won't fall from above
So I try to forget all the times that I've loved

Why do we remember beautiful lies
We end up regretting them most of our lives
Why do we only have one chance to try
I wish I could go back in time

Each time I fall asleep
I always see you there in my dreams
It's like going back in a time machine
I know when I wake up your time with me will end
So don't let me fall asleep
I don't wanna meet you there in my dreams
I know that we'll never build a time machine
It's time for me
To try, and wake up again

I fall asleep
But honestly
I wanna see you in my dreams
I'm trying to wake up
Again
