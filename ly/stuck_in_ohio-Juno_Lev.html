		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say you'll get out of the midwest
Maybe one day you'll get some rest
Baby it's okay if you hate all your friends
Took you to the ocean
Scared little boy you looked like a pelican
Too many words twisted inside your throat
Wish you'd come with me
Back to the city
But I know you won't
Cause I know
Your heart's stuck in Ohio
Is it true
What he told me about you
Boys on the moon
Fuck in the stars
You left me so soon
For a lover from mars
But I don't blame you
I know your heart's stuck in Ohio
And the straight truth
Is I'd wait for you until I die
Oh
You say you'll get out of the city
That the country's just too pretty
Baby it's okay if you're scared of letting go
I put a letter in a bottle
Begging you to love me more than him
But your heart's stuck in Ohio and
Ohio doesn't touch the ocean
Cause I know
Your heart's stuck in Ohio
Is it true
What he told me about you
Boys on the moon
Fuck in the stars
You left me so soon
For a lover from mars
But I don't blame you
I know your heart's stuck in Ohio
And the straight truth
Is I'd wait for you until I die
Oh
Heart's stuck in Ohio
(Told me about you)
Your heart's stuck in Ohio
(What he told me about you)
Maybe one day I'll move back to Ohio
Can't picture myself without you for so long
I really fucking miss Ohio
Maybe we were meant to be together all along
