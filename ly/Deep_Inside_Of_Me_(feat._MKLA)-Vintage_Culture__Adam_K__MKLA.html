		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me all your feelings
Whisper in my ear
Let go of your demons
Release all your fears

Meet me in the nighttime
Look into my eyes
Heal me with your goodness
Reach into my heart at night
Make out of the darkness
Float into the light
Help me, guardian angel
Don't worry, things will be alright

I wanna go dig, deep inside
I wanna go dig, deep inside your mind
I want you so deep, deep inside
I want you so deep, deep inside of mine

I want you so deep, deep inside

I want you so deep, deep inside
I want you so deep, deep inside
I want you so deep, deep inside
I want you so deep, deep inside

Tell me what you're needin'
I'll show you what I hear
Nothin' in between us
I won't disappear

Meet me in the nighttime
Look into my eyes
Heal me with your goodness
Reach into my heart at night
Make out of the darkness
Float into the light
Help me, guardian angel
Don't worry, things will be alright

I wanna go dig, deep inside
I wanna go dig, deep inside your mind
I want you so deep, deep inside
I want you so deep, deep inside of mine

I want you so deep, deep inside
I want you so deep, deep inside
I want you so deep, deep inside
I want you so deep, deep inside
I want you so deep, deep inside
