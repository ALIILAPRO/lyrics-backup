		  Can't go back
Can't go back
Can't go back
Can't go back
Can't go back (time)
Can't go back (flies)
Can't go back (life)
Can't go back

Don't care if my mind keeps saying
Can't go back
Don't care if my heart keeps saying
Can't go back
Don't care if my brain keeps saying
Can't go back
And I don't care if my veins keeps saying
Can't go back
No, I don't care if my mind keeps saying
Can't go back
Don't care if my heart keeps saying
Can't go back
Don't care if my brain keeps saying
Can't go back
No, I don't care if my veins keeps saying
Can't go back

When there's something pulling, yeah (can't go back, can't go back)
(Can't go back, can't go back)
But then it all gets frozen (can't go back, can't go back)
(Can't go back, can't go back)
Une machine à remonter le temps

Spirit, been looking for some evidence
Lord knows my daughter here, she's Heaven-sent (Heaven-sent)
Yeah, I've had some joys and had many wins
Still look in the mirror like I found a twin
Spirit, I been tryna do some summoning (summoning)
Like why summon her then you summon him?
Time machine I built has been stuttering (st-st-st)
Foolish endeavors

But I don't care if my mind keeps saying
Can't go back
Don't care if my heart keeps saying
Can't go back
Don't care if my brain keeps saying
Can't go back
No, I don't care if my veins keeps saying
Can't go back
And I don't care if my mind keeps saying
Can't go back
Don't care if my heart keeps saying
Can't go back
Don't care if my brain keeps saying
Can't go back
No, I don't care if my veins keeps saying
Can't go back

When there's something

Ice rock, been travelling through Saturn rings
Prayer, I've been tryna do some practicing
Lord knows with life I've been gambling
Three-eyed monster with many chins
Chronic trauma discovering
Mind is master of covering
Fear of your future developments, yeah
Based on your past life experience, mh

I was, I was looking for it
I swear I felt it, I swear
Some, some, some kind of spirit
I swear

Can't go back
You can move forward slower
Can't go back
You can move forward slower
Can't go back
You can move forward slower
Can't go back
You can move forward slower
Can't go back
You can move forward slower
Can't go back
You can move forward slower
Can't go back
You can move forward slower
Can't go back
You can move forward slower
Can't go back
You can move forward slower
Can't go back
You can move forward slower
Can't go back
You can move forward slower
Can't go back
You can move forward slower
