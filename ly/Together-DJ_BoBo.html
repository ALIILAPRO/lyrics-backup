		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Chorus 1]
We are what we are - Together
And we went so far - Together
We are what we are - Together
We all long for a land to be free

The promised land is close to you
The rain is gone, the sky is blue
Hand in hand we can survive
We're fighting for a better life

It's a new generation
Without hate and frustration
Promised land, promised nation
Without pain, without control

[Chorus 2]
Together forever for all the time
Together we welcome the secret sign
Together in freedom we take the chance
Together forever we will be friends

[Chorus 1]

Planet earth is our place
Insanity is lost in space
A world of dreams is what we share
Where honesty is in the air

It's a new generation
Without hate and frustration
Promised land, promised nation
Without pain, without control

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Rapping]
Together forever for all the time
Together we welcome the secret sign
Together in freedom we take the chance
Together forever we will be friends

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

Together forever
We'll be together
We are long for a land to be free
