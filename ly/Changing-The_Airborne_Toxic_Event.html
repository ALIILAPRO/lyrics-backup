		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All these buckets of rain, I've heard enough about.
You say that I lied.
I am a gentleman didn't I ask for a place I could stay?
What were we both thinking?
The next part just got in the way.
You were just always talking about changing, changing
What if I was the same then, same then, 
The same I always was?

All these things that you say,
Like I'll forget about the mind-numbing games that you play.
I am a gentleman, didn't I pay for every laugh, every dime,
Every bit every time and then you feed me some line.
I won't hear one more word about changing, changing
Guess what I am the same man, 
Same man, same man I've always been.

Days pass and turn into weeks, when we don't even speak.
We just lay wide awake and pretend we're asleep.
You go home alone and you're checking your phone
And you're looking at me like I'm something you own.

All these buckets of rain, 
You can't forget about it, 
You say I never tried.
I am a gentleman, 
Didn't I answer every time that you call, 
Pick you up when you fall
But you never listen at all
You were just always talking about changing, changing
Guess what I am the same man, same man.
Changing, changing
Guess what I am the same man, same man.
Changing, changing
Guess what I am the same man, same man.
