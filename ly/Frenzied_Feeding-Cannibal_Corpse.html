		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A fortnight ago
With a penchant for barbaric cruelty and executions
The vainglorious ruler
Horrid insanity, crimes and monstrosities
Overseeing the living in it's death throes
Horrific killing through unspeakable means
Frenzied feeding

A fortnight ago
Sins evermore so grave, perpetuating gruesome murder
The destroyer of all worlds
Atrocious depravity, all consuming agony
Fiending execution of the masses
Cold blooded slaughter satisfies dire need

Beset on a dark course, you shall tremble with fear
The unspeakable parting of your flesh
Hunger, starvation overtaking sensibility
Your fate determined by your death

Tortured and burning, nailed to the plank
Strangled, skinned and boiled alive
Preparing the feast for the bloodthirsty brood
Horrors abound

Impaled by the stake, mutilation enacts
All for the pleasure of evil
Oh, come thee and gather, your hunger now calls
Partake in devouring your kin

Disembowelment
Offal is now offered
Beheaded for all to see
Dismemberment
Limbs served up on platters
Like cattle, they are slaughtered
And shared amongst the mob

Frenzied feeding
Feast or famine
Frenzied feeding
Consume or consumption
Frenzied feeding
Frenzied feeding
