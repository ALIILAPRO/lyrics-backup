		  (La musica de Harry Fraud)

Shorty keep it real, it's better than bein' perfect (perfect)
I pull up in the foreign and my shooter's in suburbans ('burbans)
Icy with a stick on me, like I'm playin' hockey (hockey)
They done dragged me through the mud but them boys couldn't stop me

Slidin' through your hood with my Haan (haan)
You know the vibe (vibe), you know the vibe (vibe)
I be slidin' through your hood with my Haan (haan)
You know the vibe (vibe), you know the vibe (vibe)

I'm a shooter in my city like KD (KD)
Walkin' through the field like I'm AB (AB)
It's not the palace, it's the pit (it's the pit)
Walkin' through your hood with my stick (bbah, bah, baow)
Get it from the mud, dirt cheap (dirt cheap)
Had the block clickin' like Adele first week
Fifty mill' strong if you're talkin' ten year challenge
Money, bitches, power, hunnid, fifties, and thousands (thousands)
Cruisin' with the Uzi like I'm JT (JT)
If you see me with my beanie like a steak peek (steak peek)
Them Coke Wave boys put the pain in it
Max got still for five, Chinx put the yay' in it, haan (yay' in it)

Shorty keep it real, it's better than bein' perfect (perfect)
I pull up in a foreign and my shooter's in suburbans (brr, brr)
Icy with a stick on me like I'm playin' hockey (hockey)
They done dragged me through the mud but them boys couldn't stop me

Slidin' through your hood with my Haan (haan)
You know the vibe (vibe), you know the vibe (vibe)
I be slidin' through your hood with my Haan (haan)
You know the vibe (vibe), you know the vibe (vibe)

Uh, I be in the Lamb' (Yeah), Trill' buy a Lamb'
Switched to a brick, I ain't never did a scam
Knee-deep in ten, knee-deep in my beef
We was hoppin' out of vans tryna stand over your mans (grr)
With a big fire, sell meant fail (Turn up)
Case it 'cause I can, nigga, who gon' stop me? (Who gon' stop me?)
Big old choppy, moppy, clean his oxy
Impatient, God to gangstas, I point my off-free (my off-free)
Niggas close on my foes, could've knee-dot, uh (knee-dot)
I ain't trippin', it's fuck 'em dead, 'cause it was fuck the label
I ain't tryna go like Biggie, they trail me with fifties
Every city, hop out with my Blicky, trigger finger itchy (brrt, brrt)

Shorty keep it real, it's better than bein' perfect (perfect)
I pull up in the foreign and my shooter's in suburbans (brr, brr)
Icy with a stick on me, like I'm playin' hockey (hockey)
They done dragged me through the mud but them boys couldn't stop me

Slidin' through your hood with my Haan (haan)
You know the vibe (vibe), you know the vibe (vibe)
I be slidin' through your hood with my Haan (haan)
You know the vibe (vibe), you know the vibe (vibe)

Haan, shorty keep it real, it's better than bein' perfect (perfect)
I pull up in the foreign and my shooter's in suburbans (brr, brr)
Icy with a stick on me, like I'm playin' hockey (hockey)
Watch how you talkin', all the boys get cocky (get cocky)
