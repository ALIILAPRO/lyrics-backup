		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
I just be chasin' my bag, hello
I just came for the racks, I'm gone
Yeah, she used to throw me, now she really want me
I can tell that she mad I'm on
I just be mixin' the Bape with Vlone
I wish that some niggas would leave me alone
Use to finesse the niggas, now singin' C notes
Now they callin' my phone, I'm busy, lil' bro
Ha, fuck your opinion, that's a side note
Your main bitch, that's my side ho
Shout out my bitch, my die or rider
I hit her, she singin' like Mariah
Be me and fuck a cougar
I got better taste, nigga, fuck what you learned
I just took your ho 'cause she say I'm too nice
You said you want beef, nigga, go to Five Guys

Uh, they statin' opinions like niggas, like Reddit
Hit 'em with that slow gun, I had to go steady
And it's us vers' the world, lil' baby, you ready?
I can see in your vibes, as soon as you meant it
And this life is a test, you better not test it
I'm ahead of these niggas like I'm playin' chess
And bro got the Glock, he gon' aim at your chesty
If he spray, he gon' make you organic like pesties
The bread never switched up on me, that's my bestie
Fuck all you niggas, y'all niggas is messy
She wanna kick it, kick it like Jet Li
Catch us a soul, I know that you feel me
I'm gettin' this green, you know that I'm healthy
And they all on my
And then she be like, "God, oh my"
Every day a new nigga switch up my life

I just be chasin' my bag, hello
I just came for the racks, I'm gone
Yeah, she used to throw me, now she really want me
I can tell that she mad I'm on
I just be mixin' the BAPE with Vlone
I wish that some niggas would leave me alone
Use to finesse the niggas, now singin' C notes
Now they callin' my phone, I'm busy, lil' bro
Ha, fuck your opinion, that's a side note
Your main bitch, that's my side ho
Shout out my bitch, my die or rider
I hit her, she singin' like Mariah
Be me and fuck a cougar
I got better taste, nigga, fuck what you learned
I just took your ho 'cause she say I'm too nice
You said you want beef, nigga, go to Five Guys

She like, hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it lil' bit
Tecca Vercetti, I like your lil' drip
Shawty, you buggin', I got the big drip
I just made a song by the postal, lil' snitch
And I just got a check, that's more money to flip
Don't fuck with your energy, I had to dip
Simple nigga, Apple Watch my wrist
I got Bape on my body, Simons on my hip
How you hate on a nigga obsessed how you live?
Boy you messy, you might need a bib
And you gotta move ghost, niggas watch how you live
I took it as a sign, they told me I'm different
Fell love in my stuff, I was paintin' a picture
Nah, that shit ain't the same, lil' bitch, I be distant
Show me the signs, I 'member I missed it
Yeah, 'member I missed it

I just be chasin' my bag, hello
I just came for the racks, I'm gone
Yeah, she used to throw me, now she really want me
I can tell that she mad I'm on
I just be mixin' the Bape with Vlone
I wish that some niggas would leave me alone
Use to finesse the niggas, now singin' C notes
Now they callin' my phone, I'm busy, lil' bro
Ha, fuck your opinion, that's a side note
Your main bitch, that's my side ho
Shout out my bitch, my die or rider
I hit her, she singin' like Mariah
Be me and fuck a cougar
I got better taste, nigga, fuck what you learned
I just took your ho 'cause she say I'm too nice
You said you want beef, nigga, go to Five Guys
