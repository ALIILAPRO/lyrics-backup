		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You would take a sip of that green, nah
You'll hit the clean with the cut, yes
Goofy smoke my weed, nah
Your gun come with a beam, yes
Alexander McQueen scarf
Not for the drip, I cover the tats
Might gotta shoot a nigga all in his back
Nigga act like he a big dawg
Everything he say out his mouth straight cap
I call Von, he steer with the MAC
I don't sip drink but I do miss Ac'
I know a young nigga that'll work this pack
See him one time and he can't get a pass
None of my shooters gon' put on a mask
They gon' kill whoever they catch
Nigga want gas, I'll put on a tax
Nigga better run when that Hellcat scratch
You can't come around, you don't boot up off x
I can't come down, just give me my meds
Only The Fam', ain't really got friends
I spent two thousand on a pair of pants
I'm real street, nigga, I need romance
I told her come down, she don't suck with no hands
Niggas ain't gang, they really be fans

They say when I talk, sound like I preach
They say they love when I talk to the streets
If you not real, stop talkin' to me
If you not trill, stop talkin' to me, woah
'Posed to be my brother, woah
Showed your true colors
Niggas actin' like they for us
But I thought we had each other, woah

We used to serve in the alley
I talk to my pops on the tablet
I fuck with the T's, they valid
I fuck with the stones, they valid
Prices lower than Cali'
The flight's a thousand and somethin'
But Ralo got caught on the private
I hate all the cops with a passion
Fast car, so I don't gotta stash it
Too high, I keep bands near the glasses
Bitch niggas, they make me the maddest
I done seen niggas snitch on the status
Killers slide in the night like Gladys
From the hood where they flip off a mattress
Where they light crack pipes for mattresses
Where they try to put air in their baggies
Where they'll try lower your standards
Why you tryna get me on camera?
Talkin' bout murders, I vanish
And I want my plug to speak Spanish
And I like my ho to be managed
Where the feds did a sweep, it did damage
Where the feds did a sweep, it did

They say when I talk, sound like I preach
They say they love when I talk to the streets
If you not real, stop talkin' to me
If you not trill, stop talkin' to me, woah
'Posed to be my brother, woah
Showed your true colors
Niggas actin' like they for us
But I thought we had each other, woah
