		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me back to the place
Sittin' there with that look on your face
And your love that you just wrote
A love song on a pink note

It's the little things that make me
Drive until the car breaks down
To make you come and save me
So we can be together right now

Can you reach me from across the globe?
Can you pick me up and take me home?
'Cause I'll never feel like I'm alone
When we're dancing to the same song

And when we're standing in the dark
I know somewhere we got that spark
I'll never feel like I'm alone
When we're dancing to the same song

Woah oh, woah oh
Da da da dancing to the same song
Woah oh, woah oh
Da da da dancing to the same song

Satellite spinning 'round
Bouncing back the melody you sing now
A million miles around the world
The signal is my heart, it's about to burst

And even when the lights run out
And the sun is drowning in the sea
We got the fire in my heart
And it's about to break free

Can you reach me from across the globe?
Can you pick me up and take me home?
'Cause I'll never feel like I'm alone
When we're dancing to the same song

And when we're standing in the dark
I know somewhere we got that spark
I'll never feel like I'm alone
When we're dancing to the same song

Woah oh, woah oh
Da da da dancing to the same song
Woah oh, woah Oh
Da da da dancing to the same song

You got me, I want you
So let's do anything we wanna do
Turn it loud, you feel it now
We can light it up, we're gonna burn it down

Can you reach me from across the globe?
Can you pick me up and take me home?
'Cause I'll never feel like I'm alone
When we're dancing to the same song

And when we're standing in the dark
I know somewhere we got that spark
I'll never feel like I'm alone
When we're dancing to the same song

Woah oh, woah oh
Da da da dancing to the same song
Woah oh, woah oh
Da da da dancing to the same song

Da da da da da da da
Dancing to the same song, da da dancing to the same song
Da da da da da da da
Dancing to the same song, da da dancing to the same song
