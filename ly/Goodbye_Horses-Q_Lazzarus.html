		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He told me, "I see you rise"
But, it always falls
I see you come, I see you go
He say, "All things pass into the night"
And I say, "Oh no sir I must say you're wrong
I must disagree, oh no sir, I must say you're wrong"
Won't you listen to me

He told me, I've seen it all before
I've been there, I've seen my hopes and dreams
A lying on the ground
I've seen the sky just begin to fall
He say, "All things pass into the night"
And I say, "Oh no sir, I must say you're wrong
I must disagree, oh no sir, I must say you're wrong"
Won't you listen to me

Goodbye horses I'm flying over you
Goodbye horses I'm flying over you
Goodbye horses I'm flying over you
Goodbye horses I'm flying, flying, flying, flying over you
