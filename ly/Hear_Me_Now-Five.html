		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you think you're ready
Let the games begin
Just roll the dice now
May the best player win
Mamma told me it's no sin (it's no sin)
(Oh oh) oh yeah

Any way you like it
Just let me know
Don't try to hide it
If you're ready let's go
I won't be lazy with you no no no
Whoa whoa whoa whoa

I tried to call you but you wasn't around
I tried to see you but you was outta town
I tried to find you, tried to track you down
But my phone didn't make a sound
I know you hear me now

Now the show has started
And we're on the road
My tank is full now
I'm about to explode
It's dangerous in overload
(Oh oh) oh yeah

I can keep a secret
Won't tell my boys
What you get up to with your favorite toys
If ya feel me baby make some noise
Whoa whoa whoa whoa

I tried to call you but you wasn't around
I tried to see you but you was outta town
I tried to find you, tried to track you down
But my phone didn't make a sound
I know you hear me now

I know you hear me know 
I know you hear me know 
I know you hear me know 
I know you hear me know 
I know you hear me know 
I know you hear me know 
If ya feel me baby make some noise
If ya feel me baby just enjoy

I tried to call you but you wasn't around
I tried to see you but you was outta town
I tried to find you, tried to track you down
But my phone didn't make a sound
I know you hear me now

I tried to call you but you wasn't around
I tried to see you but you was outta town
I tried to find you, tried to track you down
But my phone didn't make a sound
I know you hear me now
