		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You take my fear and make me fearless
You give me strength when I have none
You know my failures and my secrets
And I know I stand on perfect love

Over and over again
You show me I can't be shaken
I won't be taken
Out by the waves and the wind, I know

Even in the middle of the night
Even when my heart can't see the light
I could find a million reasons why it's true
Even when the oceans pull me out
I know that You're with me even now
You're the only love I've
Found that's true
Nobody's gonna love me like You
Nobody's gonna love me like You

You fill me up when I feel empty
You give me more than enough
When skies are falling all around me
You follow me with perfect love

Even in the middle of the night
Even when my heart can't see the light
I could find a million reasons why it's true
Even when the oceans pull me out
I know that You're with me even now
You're the only love I've
Found that's true
Nobody's gonna love me like You
Nobody's gonna love me like You
You take my fear and make me fearless

I was in a rut, I had given up
It was in my blood
I would trade it all for shame
When You give me love
I took Your words and made a riddle with that
Then I cried a river and You went
And built a bridge over that
(Bridge over that) rainstorms, rainbow
You brought the Skittles to that
You gave me love when I had none
Yea it's simple as that

Nobody's gonna love me like You
Nobody's gonna love me like You
Nobody's gonna love me like You
Nobody's gonna love me like You
Nobody's gonna love me like You
