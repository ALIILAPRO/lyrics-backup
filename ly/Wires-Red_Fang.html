		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Kid, don't lose your cool it's still too soon
To have to choose a brighter doom
It's hard to believe but I can see
How there could be so little left to lose
(Cracking open skulls like cans of beans on Christmas Eve)

Momma's not okay, she lights a candle for every day
That you're away
Today could be the one she burns the motherfucker down
Her final act of grace
In a pointless, endless race

Kid, you're under fire, your life is coming down to the wire
Maybe you'll take the captains hand
Carry a ship through burning sands
Cradle your rifle like a man

Momma, she said to wait, she's lost it all
So you've got to stay to make her pay
She knows the fiend upon the throne
It's a goddamn sucker for the stone
Until the day he dies alone

Succumb
Succumb
Succumb
Succumb

Succumb
Succumb
Succumb
Succumb
