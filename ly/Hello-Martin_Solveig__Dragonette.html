I could stick around and get along with you
Hello, oh-oh-oh
It doesn't really mean that I'm into you

You're alright but I'm here, darling, to enjoy the party
Don't get too excited 'cause that's all you get from me, hey
Yeah, I think you're cute, but really you should know

I just came to say hello

Kinda like this game, but there's something you should know
