		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hold my breath and I freeze as I bite my tongue
There's a rush of blood to my head I must look so dumb

I don't know why I try to be honest
In a room full of sharks and piranhas
Can't escape all the fake
Know there will be blood

I just can't do parties
Now I'm crying in a taxi ride home
I deserve to be alone
Now my cover's blown
I should just go home
All these people I don't know
And I don't even smoke
Yeah, I should just go

Just walked in but I already lost my friends
How can I be myself? I don't know who I am
Words shoot out their mouths like vomit
Drinking lies like gin and tonic
Wishing I could just crawl out of my skin

I just can't do parties
Now I'm crying in a taxi ride home
I deserve to be alone
Now my cover's blown
I should just go home
All these people I don't know
And I don't even smoke
I should just go

I just can't do parties
Now I'm crying in a taxi
And my phone is dying, save me
I just need someone to take me home

I just get this sick in my stomach
Need to go outside 'cause I'm nauseous
Everybody here is so flawless
I just can't do, I just can't do
One more night of this Post Party Trauma
Please stop talking shit, I don't wanna

I'm so sick of the high school drama
I just can't do, I just can't do

(Post party trauma, trauma)
(Post party trauma)
