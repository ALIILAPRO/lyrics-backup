		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  God damn keep the distance
I said 10.steps.back better listen
You ain't worth your existence 
You ain't a threat, you´re a victim 

God damn keep the distance
I said 10.steps.back better listen
You ain't worth your existence 
You ain't a threat, you´re a victim 

I got a pit full of snakes that are willing to bite
Serpents by my side coz they know they´ll be alright   
So who you with tonight?
Damn right, this shit's on sight

I'm the new-era nemesis
Don't you dare eye contact 
With serpents on my head
I keep my enemies close 
So they won't ever forget       
This is Russian roulette
Baphomet, the flock I know you got my back

This low-life scum thought he could fuck with me
His story's been told, I'm a sinner b 
This is Dusk till Dawn' at least you had some drinks for free

And yeah I got him thinking he's in the lead
Till the facade breaks down and I rip a piece
It ain't my fault if he trusting me         

Yeow

God damn keep the distance
I said 10.steps.back better listen
You ain't worth your existence 
You ain't a threat, you´re a victim 

God damn keep the distance
I said 10.steps.back better listen
You ain't worth your existence 
You ain't a threat, you´re a victim 

God damn
God damn

I'm a villain
Bitch hold your breath coz I'm twisted
You ain't a threat, you´re a victim 
A cruel world that we live in
Bitch I said hold your breath, you´re a victim 

Sickness in my chest
Sickness in my soul
Sick because of you     
I got no control
I got no control
Sickness in my chest
Sickness in my soul
Sick because of you
I got no control
I got no control
Sickness in my chest
Sickness in my soul
Sick because of you
I got no control
I got no control
I got no control
I got no control
I got no control
I got no control

God damn keep the distance
I said 10.steps.back better listen
You ain't worth your existence 
You ain't a threat, you´re a victim 

God damn keep the distance
I said 10.steps.back better listen
You ain't worth your existence 
You ain't a threat, you´re a victim 

(God damn)
God damn keep the distance
I said 10.steps.back better listen (God damn)
You ain't worth your existence 
You ain't a threat, you´re a victim 

(God damn)
God damn keep the distance
I said 10.steps.back better listen
You ain't worth your existence 
You ain't a threat, you´re a victim 

God damn
God damn
God damn
