		<p>
		  Yeah, I'm tryna get higher and higher, yeah, either way
Yeah, I'm tryna go free my mind, even if I can't
I ain't ever gon' switchin' sides, I'ma go live my life
I ain't ever gon' switchin' sides, I ain't switch my lane

Everything due, I knew
Niggas ain't gon' wait on you
I been tryna get in tune with you
Bad hoes, yeah, nigga, it's a few I knew
Got the pack goin', shit goin' loose
Fuck a hotel, bring her to the roof
I got the sauce and the juice
Look out for shit I knew
I don't get lucky, bitch, been blessed
Everything tasteful, kiss been chef
Throw up the A, she gettin' F
Yeah, I'm a king, she playin' chess
Real one on one, so it's fuck all the rest
How I'm up now and I'm up next?
How I up racks and I up checks
Send a blank text, now she upset
I just took a ho to the South side
And they know my name when I'm outside
Only worry 'bout me, that's my downside
She got 40, that's that round side
'Bout to pop out, bitch, it's 'bout time
Really runnin' shit, bitch, it's my time
Ridin' on my dick like you not tired
Yeah, she got mileage, she ain't got tires

Yeah, I'm tryna get higher and higher, yeah, either way
Yeah, I'm tryna go free my mind, even if I can't
I ain't ever gon' switchin' sides, I'ma go live my life
I ain't ever gon' switchin' sides, I ain't switch my lane
Yeah, I'm tryna get higher and higher, yeah, either way
Yeah, I'm tryna go free my mind, even if I can't
I ain't ever gon' switchin' sides, I'ma go live my life
I ain't ever gon' switchin' sides, I ain't switch my lane

Yeah, I'm tryna get higher and higher, yeah, either way
Yeah, I'm tryna get higher and higher, yeah, either way
Yeah, I'm tryna get higher and higher, yeah, either way
Yeah, I'm tryna get higher and higher, yeah, either way
Yeah, I'm tryna get higher and higher, yeah, either way
Yeah, I'm tryna go free my mind, even if I can't
