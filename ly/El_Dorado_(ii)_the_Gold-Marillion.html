		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The gold stops us 
The gold always did 
The gold took more lives than Uranium 
Than Plutonium 
Pandemonium 

The thunder approaches 
The heavy sighing of the monster
Come to break the heavy weather 
Come to silence all the singing birds 
Tearing up the sky like paper 
White-welding through dark steel of clouds 
And the release of the sudden rain 

The gold stops us 
The gold always did 
The gold took more lives than Uranium 
Than Plutonium. Pandemonium
The Gold! 

Jet engines and demolition 
And the summer rain 
Like finding a lost child 

The roads are travelled by many 
Like promises of peace 
And some choose not to go 
The fear looks like bravado 
It always did 
I see them waiting, smiling 
On the borders in dawn's mist 
Or lost to the world in their upturned boats 
I'll be free or I'll die trying to be 
Trying to be
