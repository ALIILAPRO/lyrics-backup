		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Why you never stick to the script
That's probably why we ain't on the same page
Of course I want it my way
Or everything is going side ways
You getting me tight
I planned this thing perfect
and now you try to re-write
It better go how I want; and if I don't, my hands are tied
I hate to say that you don't have a say but baby, is it crazy

I'm sorry if I come off
Like I gotta be the one in charge
Everything just feels so much better when it's yours
And I wish I could shake this off

But I think there's a control freak that controls me
Keeping everyone and everything on tight leash
Take it up with her, you ain't gotta fight me
I just play my part, she does all the writing

But I think there's a control freak that controls me
Keeping everyone and everything on tight leash
Take it up with her, you ain't gotta fight me
I just play my part, she does all the writing


This feels like it's more than overthinking
I get so caught up I can't see what's in front of me
I guess I missed the signs I still can't believe
that you messed it up
But you was probably more present than me
I was playing make believe, I know now
It's hard to be genuine when you had this planned out
Same rigid thinking that had me down bad, can't let go of the past
But if you would play your part, then we would prolly last


Either way I'm sorry if I come off
Like i gotta be the one in charge
Everything feels so much better when it's yours
And I wish I could shake this off


But I think there's a control freak that controls me
Keeping everyone and everything on tight leash
Take it up with her, you ain't gotta fight me
I just play my part, she does all the writing

But I think there's a control freak that controls me
Keeping everyone and everything on tight leash
Take it up with her, you ain't gotta fight me
I just play my part, she does all the writing
