		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lot of people tryna plot on me
So forgive me for my honesty
They all show animosity
So forgive me for my honesty

I done put in that work
Put in my time
People don't do what they love
They just following the lines
I do what I want
And I been doing fine
Start following your passion
Stop falling in the line
I done put in that work
Put in my time
People don't do what they love
They just following the lines
I do what I want
And I been doing fine
Start following your passion
Stop falling in the line

"Man Down, Man Down"
Shot's fire, how it pan out?
If I pulled up with a gun homie, maybe then you'd wanna stand down
Never signed no deal, you just mad cause global
Did this music on my own, ain't that funny? I ain't local
16 with no 9-5, I just rise and grind til I'm dead
Maybe when I die I'ma get some peace of mind, but for now I'll go where I'm led
You fill your life with cash and hoes
I'm passed that life so that you know
I'ma pull up tear the game apart, get what I want when I want, call it grab n' go
Life is hard, but I know I'm blessed
"F" in school, but I gained respect
Faced my fears, traveled through my thoughts
Broke all the walls, call that finesse
Cross me once and you'll regret it
Cross me twice and it's over
Cross me thrice and you'll feel the wrath
Yeah the bar is high, but I'm sober

Lot of people tryna plot on me
So forgive me for my honesty
They all show animosity
So forgive me for my honesty

I done put in that work
Put in my time
People don't do what they love
They just following the lines
I do what I want
And I been doing fine
Start following your passion
Stop falling in the line
I done put in that work
Put in my time
People don't do what they love
They just following the lines
I do what I want
And I been doing fine
Start following your passion
Stop falling in the line

Pick up the pen, pick up the pace
None of you people can face me
I know that you hate me
But how can you people not see, you can't phase me
I'm on my own, I got my circle, I got the people who raised me
And you? You ain't do nothing to help me I wouldn't help you if you paid me
I try not get sentimental on every song that I sing
Nor on every verse that I rap
Y'all too slow, go check on your ping
Cause I know what I'm doing, I know what your thinking, but I'm the one doing the work
You cannot try to control me and offer up money, because I know what I'm worth
That's right, I said it out loud, these labels they hittin' me up
They throwing bands, I know it won't last, so I tell em' it isn't enough
I know in my heart it's making them mad
I see them, in fury, they grittin' they teeth
They want me to sign cause they wanna trap me
I tell them accept the defeat

Lot of people tryna plot on me
So forgive me for my honesty
They all show animosity
So forgive me for my honesty

I done put in that work
Put in my time
People don't do what they love
They just following the lines
I do what I want
And I been doing fine
Start following your passion
Stop falling in the line
I done put in that work
Put in my time
People don't do what they love
They just following the lines
I do what I want
And I been doing fine
Start following your passion
Stop falling in the line
