		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't go on, I can't go on
Gotta keep it together
Don't get me wrong, don't get me wrong
'Cause baby, you make me better, hey

With just one look you make me shiver
I just wanna take you home
Wanna go, yeah I wanna go

Now girl, you make me a believer
I wanna take off all my clothes
Wanna go, you make me wanna go

I just can't go on no more
When you look this freaking beautiful
Oh, hands down to the floor, my love
And I'm doing whatever you want

I can't go on, I can't go on
When you look this freaking beautiful
I can't go on, I can't go on
When you look this freaking beautiful

You've got me good, you've got me good
And I'm not going nowhere
Right in your hook, that's understood
But I'mma take you somewhere

I just can't go on no more
When you look this freaking beautiful
Oh, hands down to the floor, my love
And I'm doing whatever you want

I can't go on, I can't go on
When you look this freaking beautiful
I can't go on, I can't go on
When you look this freaking beautiful

So freaking beautiful
Baby, I just can't go on

I can't go on, I can't go on
I can't go on, I can't go on
When you look this freaking beautiful

I can't go on, I can't go on
I can't go on, I can't go on
When you look this freaking beautiful

So freaking beautiful
Baby, I just can't go on
