		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ya thinkin' 'bout callin' in sick
Or just blowin' off work
And drive right by that exit sign
Where I punch the clock from 9 to 5
I'll roll the window down and I'll flip it the bird

Park my truck down at the dock
And see if this cell phone can skip like a rock

You can spend your whole life
Tryin' to make a killin'
But what's it all worth without a little livin'?
Don't wanna look back at all the things I'm missin'
And wake up wishin' I spent more time fishin', yeah
More time fishin', yeah

I don't care if I don't catch a thing
As long as I catch a buzz and a tan, hmm
Just a couple cheap fold up seats
I can sit out on the bank and hold your hand
And a cold can

Yeah, I'm tired of wastin' my time
On traffic jams and boss mans, and chasin' a dime

You can spend your whole life
Tryin' to make a killin'
But what's it all worth without a little livin'?
Don't wanna look back at all the things I'm missin'
And wake up wishin' I spent more time fishin', yeah
More time fishin', yeah

Whoa whoa
Yeah yeah

A little more spin you 'round in the kitchen
A little more Otis Redding, red wine sippin'
A little less 5 A.M.
A little more sleepin' in
A little more take it slow, backroad drive

You can spend your whole life
Tryin' to make a killin' (tryin' to make a killin')
But what's it all worth without a little livin'? (hey, yeah)
Don't wanna look back at all the things I'm missin' (all the things I'm missin')
And wake up wishin' I spent more time fishin', yeah
More time fishin', yeah
Whoa whoa
More time fishin', mm-mm
