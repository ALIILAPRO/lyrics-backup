		  (This is Rock 'n' roll radio, come on, let's rock 'n' roll with the Ramones)

Rock'n, rock 'n' roll radio, let's go
Rock'n, rock 'n' roll radio, let's go
Rock'n, rock 'n' roll radio, let's go
Rock'n, rock 'n' roll radio, let's go

Do you remember Hullabaloo
Upbeat, Shindig and Ed Sullivan, too?
Do you remember rock 'n' roll radio?
Do you remember rock 'n' roll radio?

Do you remember Murray the K
Alan Freed, and High Energy?
It's the end, the end of the seventies
It's the end, the end of the century

Do you remember lying in bed
With the covers pulled up over your head
Radio playin' so no one can see?
We need change, and we need it fast
Before rock's just part of the past
'Cause lately, it all sounds the same to me
Whoah-whoah, oh

Rock'n, rock 'n' roll radio, let's go
Rock'n, rock 'n' roll radio, let's go
Rock'n, rock 'n' roll radio, let's go
Rock'n, rock 'n' roll radio, let's go

Will you remember Jerry Lee
John Lennon, T. Rex and old Moulty?
It's the end, the end of the seventies
It's the end, the end of the century

Do you remember lying in bed
With the covers pulled up over your head
Radio playin' so no one can see?
We need change, and we need it fast
Before Rock's just part of the past
'Cause lately, it all sounds the same to me
Whoah-whoah, oh

Rock'n, rock 'n' roll radio, let's go
Rock'n, rock 'n' roll radio, let's go
Rock'n, rock 'n' roll radio, let's go
Rock'n, rock 'n' roll radio, let's go

(This is rock 'N' roll radio, stay tuned for more rock 'n' roll)
