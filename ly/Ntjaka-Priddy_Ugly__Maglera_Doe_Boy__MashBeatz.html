		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm with my dawgs
My hond, di ntja'ka
Sparapara in a Porsche
Pasop, for the kgata
You don't wanna go to court
For a kop, of the dagga
They shot the homie in the kop
Need a mop, for his matha
With my dawgs
My hond, di ntja'ka
Sparapara in a Porsche
Pasop, for the kgatas
You don't wanna go to court
For a kop, of the dagga
They shot the homie in the kop
Need a mop, for his matha

You should see the odrop (mwah)
See how top, are the mpahlaz (mwah)
Need a drop top slathla
Playing Hop Scotch in the straata (ishu)
Hao short'a kao tlatsa
Watch your walk, ntwana watch your praata
South Ah like the Gaza
Maphra, ntwana you could sata
My grandmama in Luanda
Said, "Mi casa e tu a casa" (avo)
Mfana nothing for mahala (at all)
Turn di rand'ta into kwanza (gwala)
People die for the gwala
Brothers make you sing like Bala (bafana)
Utlwa go lla Palafala
Bafana ba ha bana zaka (sies)
See, my young jita caught a lick
Bantita for a brick
Mamacita bought some tits
A cheetah can't applaud a bitch
Must've thought it was a pit
Named my dog 'Nike', and never saw a tick
None like me, in whatever sport, it is
Tryna sign me, give me effort for a hit
Maverick Seizure doing edits on the pic
Going stupid, 'cause they told me, "Dumb it down"
Be the hottest when the summer come around
I need commas, commas in my bank account
Counting numbers, numbers in a fat amount
My dawg
If you get bitten it isn't my fault
It's the decision of God
Don't get your feelings involved

With my dawgs
My hond, di ntja'ka
Sparapara in a Porsche
Pasop, for the kgata
You don't wanna go to court
For a kop, of the dagga
They shot the homie in the kop
Need a mop, for his matha
With my dawgs
My hond, di ntja'ka
Sparapara in a Porsche
Pasop, for the kgatas
You don't wanna go to court
For a kop, of the dagga
They shot the homie in the kop
Need a mop, for his matha

Qeta ho tsoha hakena planne
Step one? Kena bata
Ha nka thola ya legaqo?
Step two? Glera o naja
You don't wanna go to war
Niggas poor here, o tla sata
In Pitori with the Pounds
Transi ya Matjala? Sosh Plata (faka punyete)
Niggas hot 'cause ba bata
Nna ke mo radio'ng Bachucada
Gold teeth, Don Dada
Might mix the Louis V ka Nevada
Fourty Crooks Alibaba
I do not buy my jewels on Ali Baba
Reposado shots go, "Kra-kra"
All Hail, All Hail
Sean Don over Le Domaine
Gourmet
I be cooking niggas saut√©
Saw loss, I want more gain
Saw a lot, I don't want pain
I just want chains, I just want change
More drip, grew up in the drains
Young trap God ordained
No guts, no glory, it's all game
Vetements
Balmain
Balmains
With the Bulls running Ole
Baby cuzzo got it broad day
Nigga this the colosseum ya bo gabadiya and we hot, propane
With my dawg by the domain
With my dawg, ende re baie
Dalmatian

My hond, di ntja'ka
Sparapara in a Porsche
Pasop, for the kgata
You don't wanna go to court
For a kop, of the dagga
They shot the homie in the kop
Need a mop, for his matha
With my dawgs
My hond, di ntja'ka
Sparapara in a Porsche
Pasop, for the kgatas
You don't wanna go to court
For a kop, of the dagga
They shot the homie in the kop
Need a mop, for his matha
