		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No matter how hard I try
You keep pushing me aside
And I can't break through
There's no talking to you
I'm so sad that you're leaving
It takes time to believe it
After all is said and done
You'll be the lonely one, oh

Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

But I know that I'll get through this
'Cause I know that I am strong
No, I don't need you anymore
No, I don't need you anymore
No, I don't need you anymore
No, I don't need you anymore

Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

No
No
No
