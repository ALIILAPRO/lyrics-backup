		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitch
Jason Rich on the beat, bitch

Diamonds dancin' on my wrist just like Richard Simmons (Simmons)
Got the Patek with the drip like I'm fuckin' winnin' (bitch)
Now them diamonds on my neck synchronized swimmin' (swimmin')
Got my wrist spinnin', lookin' like I'm Richard Simmons (ayy)
Rich Simmons, Raf Simons, thick women, bad bitches
Six figures on your head, flip like a spatula
Gravy got your girl sittin' in the passenger
Think I'm Richard Simmons, ooh, bitch, I feel spectacular

Hit it really quick and then I dip, ayy, ayy
Gravy in this bitch, I'm with the shits, ayy, ayy
You never see me lack, I send your bitch a fax
She came through with the pack, Gravy came through with the snacks (woo)
Pull up to that function in a new whip, too quick
Now your mama lookin' like my new bitch, true shit
She my thicky, she so pretty
Every time I'm in your city Gravy bustin' through that chimney

Diamonds dancin' on my wrist just like Richard Simmons (Simmons)
Got the Patek with the drip like I'm fuckin' winnin' (bitch)
Now them diamonds on my neck synchronized swimmin' (swimmin')
Got my wrist spinnin', lookin' like I'm Richard Simmons (ayy)
Rich Simmons, Raf Simons, thick women, bad bitches
Six figures on your head, flip like a spatula
Gravy got your girl sittin' in the passenger
Think I'm Richard Simmons, ooh, bitch, I feel spectacular

Ayy, white Versace robe when I hop up on a stage
Fuck your bitch, gone in sixty seconds, call me Nick Cage (fuck)
Gravy goin' national, I'm lookin' for the treasure
I don't think I'm sick, but I got 'em under weather (ayy)
Honda, Tesla, Rolls with the roof up
Gin with the fruit punch, Ray Gun juiced up
Fly as fuck, called up my boy and said, "Let's make these hits"
Might just go icy my wrist, might just go cop me your bitch

Diamonds dancin' on my wrist just like Richard Simmons (Simmons)
Got the Patek with the drip like I'm fuckin' winnin' (bitch)
Now them diamonds on my neck synchronized swimmin' (swimmin')
Got my wrist spinnin', lookin' like I'm Richard Simmons (ayy)
Diamonds dancin' on my wrist just like Richard Simmons (Simmons)
Got the Patek with the drip like I'm fuckin' winnin' (bitch)
Now them diamonds on my neck synchronized swimmin' (swimmin')
Got my wrist spinnin', lookin' like I'm Richard Simmons (ayy)
Rich Simmons, Raf Simons, thick women, bad bitches
Six figures on your head, flip like a spatula
Gravy got your girl sittin' in the passenger
Think I'm Richard Simmons, ooh, bitch, I feel spectacular
