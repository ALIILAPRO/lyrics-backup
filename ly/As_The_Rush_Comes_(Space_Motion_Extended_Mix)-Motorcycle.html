		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Traveling somewhere
Could be anywhere
There's a coldness in the air
But I don't care
We drift deeper
Life goes on
We drift deeper
Into the sound

Traveling somewhere
Could be anywhere
There's a coldness in the air
Yeah, but I don't care
We drift deeper into the song
Life goes on
We drift deeper into the sound
Feeling strong

So bring it on, so bring it on 
Embrace me, surround me
As the rush comes
Embrace me, surround me
As the rush comes
Embrace me, surround me
As the rush comes
Embrace me, surround me
As the rush comes

So bring it on, so bring it on 
We drift deeper into the song
Life goes on
We drift deeper into the sound
Feeling strong
So bring it on, so bring it on 

Embrace me, surround me
As the rush comes
Embrace me, surround me
As the rush comes
Embrace me, surround me
As the rush comes
Embrace me, surround me
As the rush comes

Embrace me, surround me
As the rush comes
Embrace me, surround me
As the rush comes
Embrace me, surround me
As the rush comes
As the rush comes
As the rush comes
As the rush comes
As the rush comes
