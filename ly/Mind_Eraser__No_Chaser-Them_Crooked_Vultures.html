		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Run along face lift
If it kills, I got news, it ain't a side effect
Call it a full reject or
A fuel injected, type corrected, teenage obstacle

All I wanna do is have my mind erased
I'm begging you, pleading you, stop comateasing us all
Drug company, where's a pill for me?
I call it mind eraser, no chaser at all
On permanent leave of everything
Law biding dick riding, fun police, leave us alone
Dulling the edge of a razor blade
What does it mean when the knife and the hand are your own?

Give me the reason why the mind's a terrible thing to waste?
Understanding is cruel the monkey said as it launched to space
I know that I'm gonna be your dangerous side effect
Ignorance is bliss, until they take your bliss away

Robotic mom bought me,
DIY kit lobotomy
It's a tuck, taste, dance craze, movie of the week
You'll buy the doll, kick the ball
Then piss on the sheets

All I wanna do is have my mind erased
I'm begging you, pleading you, stop comateasing us all
Drug company, where's a pill for me?
It reads- mind eraser, no chaser, in bright lights
On permanent leave of everything
New age goosestep on a karma collision
Dulling the edge of a razor blade
What does it mean when the knife and the hand are your own?

Give me the reason why the mind's a terrible thing to waste?
Understanding is cruel the monkey said as it launched to space
I know that I'm gonna be your dangerous side effect
Ignorance is bliss, until they take your bliss away

Give me the reason why the mind's a terrible thing to waste?
Your dangerous side effect
I know that I am, your dangerous side effect
I'm not sorry to say we just ran out of give a shit
