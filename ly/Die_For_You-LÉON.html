		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The party's over, time to go
Spinning lights, the music dies, you never showed
Wine stains and glitter on the floor
Grab my shoes, always the last one out of the door

And for a moment it all stopped
My head, my heart, like I forgot that you are gone
And then the feeling brings me back again

I'm losing all my senses every night
Darling, don't you know that 
I would die, I'd die for you?
And I don't want to want somebody new
Darling, don't you know that 
I'd die every night for you?
I'd cry for you

Above me, I can't see the stars
And it feels like we are miles and miles apart
And I know we said we shouldn't talk
But I lost a friend and maybe that's the hardest part

For a moment it all stopped
My restless heart, like I forgot that you are gone
And then the feeling brings me back again

I'm losing all my senses every night
Darling, don't you know that 
I would die, I'd die for you?
And I don't want to want somebody new
Darling, don't you know that 
I'd die every night for you?
I'd cry for you
(I'd cry foe you)

I hate when everybody's going home
And I'm on my own, all on my own
I say, "Couldn't we just have one more before we go?"
Don't wanna go, I wanna feel like I'm flying
I wanna stay in the clouds, stay
Oh when I fall into my bed it takes me up again

And I'm losing all my senses every night
Darling, don't you know that 
I would die, I'd die for you?
And I don't want to want somebody new
Darling, don't you know that 
I'd die every night for you?
Darling, don't you know that 
I'd die every night for you?
I'd cry for you, I'd die for you
