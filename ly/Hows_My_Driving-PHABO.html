		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take you to the Cheesecake in Marina
Just 'cause we don't like to be all in the scene, yeah
Sushi Nishi Bonzai in Calabasas
For my baby, she was craving Japanese, yeah
Ain't nothing too far out of reach, yeah
I'ma reach it, Michael Jordan, Space Jam
From the bleachers, I'm your number one fan
Right on my shoulder, your pain rests
Right next to that angel who said yes to you
Multiple choices, I ain't guess
Even if I think no, I still say yes to you
Lifted your baggage and did reps
That's my baby, my shawty, rider, my dawg and all
And I'm tellin' you
Back against the wall I still find a way to take care of her

It should be illegal the way you ride
You let me take the lead, but how's my driving?
I'll let you see, no limo tint, no hiding
No surprises
Falling for you and I won't fight it
Like a shirt, I'm tucking my pride in, oh
We vibin'
I don't know if we'll crash but I like it, oh
I'm driving you crazy

Dippin' through these South L.A streets
Finally embraced me, I was getting tired of fake beef
Meet a transplant on the daily
Writing for Atlantic and they still haven't paid me, it's fine
Pressure saying, "You can't escape me"
I throw a twenty in the drive wherever it take me
Still got my patience
And I still got my baby and all my loose attachments
Tell me where the poolside is
What city will you fly next?
Feel the rush like Pleasure in the coupe, climb in
Miss the rush of whippin' dope in a new Pyrex, goddamn
I do this for real and not just for the 'gram
You feel like it's real but really she paid for gummy bears
My face is your chair anywhere

It should be illegal the way you ride
You let me take the lead, but how's my driving?
I'll let you see, no limo tint, no hiding
No surprises
Falling for you and I won't fight it
Like a shirt, I'm tucking my pride in, oh
We vibin'
I don't know if we'll crash but I like it, oh
I'm driving you crazy, crazy
