		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don’t underestimate me
I’m more than what you can see
Just when you have counted me out
Think that you’ve taken my crown
I’ll strike without a warning
I’ve got the fire inside me
Then you’ll see what I’m all about
Right here right now

I'm rising up from the ashes
Standing my ground
I'm rising up from the ashes
You know that I'm only getting

Stronger
Stronger
Try to knock me out
But you know I hit harder
Bet you didn’t think
That I could get even 
Stronger
Stronger
Try to knock me out
But you know I hit harder
Bet you didn’t think
That I could get even 
Stronger

Coming out of my cage
Hit you like an earthquake
I’m the thunder shaking the ground
Before you know what’s taking you down           

I'm rising up from the ashes
You know that I'm only getting

Stronger
Stronger
Try to knock me out
But you know I hit harder
Bet you didn’t think
That I could get even 
Stronger
Stronger
Try to knock me out
But you know I hit harder
Bet you didn’t think
That I could get even 

I'm rising up from the ashes
Standing my ground
I'm rising up from the ashes
You know that I'm only getting 

Stronger 
Stronger 
Stronger
Try to knock me out
But you know I hit harder
Bet you didn’t think
That I could get even 
Stronger
Stronger
Try to knock me out
But you know I hit harder
Bet you didn’t think
That I could get even 
Stronger
Stronger
