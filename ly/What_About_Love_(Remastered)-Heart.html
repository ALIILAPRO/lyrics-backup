		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been lonely
I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending and that's all I can do
The love I'm sending
Ain't making it through to your heart

You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying to keep it under control
You got it down and you're well on your way to the top
But there's something that you forgot

What about love?
Don't you want someone to care about you?
What about love?
Don't let it slip away
What about love?
I only wanna share it with you
You might need it some day

I can't tell you what you're feeling inside
And I can't sell you what you don't want to buy
Something's missing, you gotta look back on your life
You know something here just ain't right

What about love?
Don't you want someone to care about you?
What about love?
Don't let it slip away
What about love?
I only wanna share it with you

What about love?
Don't you want someone to care about you?
What about love?
Don't let it slip away
But what about love?
I only wanna share it with you

Oh, no
Oh
Oh, what about love?
Love
Ooh-ooh-ooh
What about love?
Love, love, love
What about
What about
Love
Ooh-ooh-ooh-oh
