		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let them hear us sing
Lost and broken souls 
Trusted priest and king
All of the lies they told 
They can hear our cries
Leave us in the cold
While the children die
Watch them count their gold

So if heaven is filled with the likes of them
We dine in hell instead

We are the young undead
Born in the grave of humankind 
Breathe, fill your lungs with dread 
We have already died
For we are the children of night

Poison in the air
Can't afford the cure 
Children unprepared 
To die in father's war 
Destruction & despair 
What are you crying for? 
We have their thoughts & prayers 
And who could ask for more?

So if heaven is filled with the likes of them
We dine in hell instead

We are the young undead
Born in the grave of humankind 
Breathe, fill your lungs with dread 
We have already died
For we are the children of night

We are the young undead
Born in the grave of humankind 
Breathe, fill your lungs with dread 
We have already died
For we are the children of night

We are the young undead
Born in the grave of humankind 
Breathe, fill your lungs with dread 
We have already died
For we are the children of night

We are the children of night
