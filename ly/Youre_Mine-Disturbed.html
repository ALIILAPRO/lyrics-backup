		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've begun to realize
That whenever I am with you
You deliver me from the pain in my life
Easy now to recognize
All the misery I have been through
It was beating me to submission
'Til the day you arrived
Certainly, I felt alive
Strength I had lost was revived
I'm mending inside and we both know why
'Cause you're mine
I knew I could be whole if you were mine
I'll vanquish any foe because you're mine

Been betrayed too many times
Didn't think I would ever recover
That it'd haunt me for the rest of my life
Then you opened up my eyes
And you helped me rediscover
With what you resurrected
A man who had died
Your power regave me new life
Made me reborn and refined
Rebuilt from inside and we both know why
'Cause you're mine
I knew I could be whole if you were mine
I'll vanquish any foe because you're mine

I never thought I would ever escape
At times, I wanted to die
Feared that it all was just a little too late
For then, I wouldn't survive
I let you in and let go of the hate
My heart recovered now, I
Owe you a debt that I can never repay
I still believe 'cause you're mine

I'm burning inside and we both know why
'Cause you're mine
I knew I could be whole if you were mine
I'll vanquish any foe because you're mine
I can regain control because you're mine
I can take over the world because you're mine
Mine
