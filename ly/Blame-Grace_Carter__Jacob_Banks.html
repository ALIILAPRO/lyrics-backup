		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I blamed it on heartache i blamed it on you
I blamed it on mistakes and your empty truth
Now I can't even wade in the water
I'm in too deep to move

Love is so painful when you're born to lose
I wasn't looking for another
But I can't help but wonder

It was a one-way track
Why don't you love me back?
Why'd your temptation crack, over the truth
You thought you could fill the gaps
Thought I would run right back
I didn't pick this mess, I wouldn't choose
To blame it on you

I blamed it on secrets and words left unsaid
I blamed it on weakness
And the voice in my head
Scared to be left in the shadows
I'm overtaken by fear

Love is so painful when you're not here
And I wasn't looking for another
But I can't help but wonder

It was a one-way track
Why don't you love me back
Why'd your temptation crack, over the truth
You thought you could fill the gaps
Thought I would run right back
I didn't pick this mess, I wouldn't choose
To blame it on you

I'm all in my feelings, I'm so vulnerable
Got so many questions 'bout all
Of the wrong I do oh, I do

It was a one-way track
Why don't you love me back
Why'd your temptation crack, over the truth
You thought you could fill the gaps
Thought I would run right back
I didn't pick this mess, I wouldn't choose
One-way track love me back
Fill the gaps choose
To blame it on you
