		  It's Gravy
Bitch, you maidenless
Uh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, it's Gravy (Dwilly, I'm scared)
Uh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, ayy

Fireworks on my neck
It's a grand finale (finale)
Bad hoes got a full schedule
'Bout to smash and rally (rally)
Shawty throwin' that ass
It's your dear Aunt Sally
I'm feeling generous
Might just add a few folks to your family

Hip, hip, hip, hip, hip, hooray
I done piped a thicky today
Hip, hip, hip, hip, hip, hooray
Pull up, splash, flood the soirée
Hip, hip, hip, hip, hip, hooray
I done piped a thicky today
Hip, hip, hip, hip, hip, hooray
Pull up, splash, flood the soirée

Pull up to the ball, look fabulous
Gravy hit a waltz with your bitch, real scandalous
Got my intern doin' calculus
Frozen 3, uncut on the amulet
Make that ass Shakespeare, Hamlet
Have a lil' vigil with your bitch, yeah, it's candle-lit
I'm the best thing since cannabis
One week trial with your bitch, just dabbled it (whoa)
That subscription canceled
Eatin' good, I'm Hansel
You've been in distress
I've been in your damsel
Caked up, substantial
Mm, good, I'm Campbells
Hit it twice
Then whipped the chariot straight back to Bandsville

Hip, hip, hip, hip, hip, hooray
I done piped a thicky today
Hip, hip, hip, hip, hip, hooray
Pull up, splash, flood the soirée
Hip, hip, hip, hip, hip, hooray
I done piped a thicky today
Hip, hip, hip, hip, hip, hooray
Pull up, splash, flood the soirée

I pull up in the all glass slippers (slip)
Turn Cinderella to a stripper
Wrist doin' tricks like Flipper
Team full of L.A. hoes like the Clippers
Gravy spittin' on Beethoven
7-Eleven, she stay open
Aubrey Plaza, I stay pokin'
Tryna flex with the shades open
I plead the fifth
Came too quick, she keyed the whip
I don't want bread, I need a bitch
Yeah, side-milf said I gotta meet the kids
Everybody love step-Gravy
I'm ballin', y'all spectatin'
Headhuntin', I'm neck-chasin'
My point of view is breathtaking

Hip, hip, hip, hip, hip, hooray
I done piped a thicky today
Hip, hip, hip, hip, hip, hooray
Pull up, splash, flood the soirée
Hip, hip, hip, hip, hip, hooray
I done piped a thicky today
Hip, hip, hip, hip, hip, hooray
Pull up, splash, flood the soirée
