		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My point of view has been altered because I'm
Never looking out through my own eyes
I don't know when I misplaced my own perspective
So now I gotta take back what was mine

So tired of this stagnant place that I keep living in
Don't know how it happened, but I'm wearing thin

I just wanna rock the boat and raise some hell
Set fire to my own damn bed 'cause I never wanna sleep again
I just wanna rock the boat and kiss and tell
Set fire to my own damn mind and leave inhibitions behind
But I don't care about the repercussions
I don't care about the repercussions
Just as long as my blood keeps rushing
I don't care about the repercussions, no whoa

People keep saying that I'm overly dramatic
And everything is actually okay
But I'm living on the verge of panic
And now I gotta find a way to break

So tired of this stagnant place that I keep living in
Don't know how it happened, but I'm wearing thin

I just wanna rock the boat and raise some hell
Set fire to my own damn bed 'cause I never wanna sleep again
I just wanna rock the boat and kiss and tell
Set fire to my own damn mind and leave inhibitions behind
But I don't care about the repercussions
I don't care about the repercussions
Just as long as my blood keeps rushing
I don't care about the repercussions, no whoa

So tired of this stagnant place that I keep living in
Don't know how it happened, but I'm wearing thin

I just wanna rock the boat and raise some hell
Set fire to my own damn bed 'cause I never wanna sleep again
I just wanna rock the boat and kiss and tell
Set fire to my own damn mind and leave inhibitions behind
But I don't care about the repercussions
I don't care about the repercussions
Just as long as my blood keeps rushing
I don't care about the repercussions, no whoa
