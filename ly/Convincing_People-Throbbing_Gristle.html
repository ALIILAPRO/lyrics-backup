		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There was never a way
And there's never a day
To convince people
You can play their game
You can say their name

But you won't convince people
There's several ways
There's several ways
To convince people

It's the name of the game
It's the game of the name
Convincing people
Convincing people

There's several ways
There's several ways
To convince people
And there's several days
And there's never a way
To convince people

There's one way though
That you'll never convince people
And that's when you try
To be someone

Who's not telling
And who's trying to compel
Who's trying to tell you
What you ought to be
Convinced of

So there's several ways
And there's several days
To convince your people
And you are the people

Convincing people
Convincing people
There's never a way
And there's never a day
To convince people

There's several ways
There's several days
We don't want to convince people
Let me tell you

I'll tell you what I want you to do
It's no way, no way, no way
To convince people
