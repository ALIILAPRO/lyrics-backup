		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're a paper doll
I fold you how I want
You're not my noose
I tied this knot
If this won't be
Our fingers laid together
This is total war
Method not objective

You can't ever say I'm breaking the rules
If I can glue them back together
You can't ever say I'm breaking the rules
If I can glue them back together
You can't ever say I'm breaking the rules
If I can glue them back together
Back together

Scars on my fingers, bruises, my neck
Crashin' my trains, warship my wreck
Scars on my fingers, bruises, my neck
Crashin' my trains, warship my wreck

Scars on my fingers, bruises, my neck
Crashin' my trains, warship my wreck
Warship my wreck
Warship my wreck

Cut the hands off
The kamikaze into your soul
Kamikaze into your soul

Scars on my fingers, bruise on my neck
Crashin' my trains, warship my wreck, warship my wreck
Scars on my fingers, bruise on my neck
Crashin' my trains, warship my wreck, warship my wreck

Scars on my fingers, bruises, my neck
Bashin' my trains, warship my wreck
Can't ever say I'm breaking the rules
If I can glue them back together
Can't ever say I'm breaking the rules
If I can glue them back together
Can't ever say I'm breaking the rules
If I can glue them back together
Can't ever say I'm breaking the rules
If I can glue them back together
Can't ever say I'm breaking the rules
If I can glue them back together
Can't ever say I'm breaking the rules
If I can glue them back together
Can't ever say I'm breaking the rules
