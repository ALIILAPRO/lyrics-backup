		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  His own death plays a single song, 
You feel lost but you know where you're from
You're not pretty but you got it going on
Your head swims in electric blues
If all fails, you can't lose

My lover cover his phone
You turned on but there's nobody home
Your feet straight but you're not as natural
Your feet ? static shock
It's real, and he's not

I got out of my ?
I got out of my ?
I've got a plan for the future
And that's whatever ? from my fingers
How cold, she's so old
And I cannot believe that you wanna be here
On your own, in this cradle of love

His own death plays a single song, 
You feel lost but you know where you're from
You're not pretty but you got it going on 

His own death plays a single song, 
You feel lost but you know where you're from
You're not pretty but you got it going on
