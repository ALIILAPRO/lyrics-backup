		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (When you grab and dance with your friends)
('Cause it's true, what's good for you)

(K-l-o-n Los Angeles)
(Clone Radio) 
(We play the songs that sound more like everyone else)
(Than anyone else)
(Clone (Clone))

(Hey alright, it's Kip Kasper)
(Clone radio, LA's infinite repeat)
(How we feelin' out there?)
(How's your drive time commute?)
(I need a saga)
(What's the saga?)
(It's Songs for the Deaf)
(You can't even hear it)

Dead bull with the life from the low
I'll be massive conquistador
Give me soul and show me the door
Metal heavy, soft at the core
Gimme toro, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more
Pressurize, neutralize
Deep fried, gimme some more

Space truckin', four on the floor
Fortified with the liquor store
This one's down, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more

Shrunken head I love to adore
B-movie, gimme some gore
Gimme toro, gimme some more
B-movie, gimme some gore

Uh
Yow
Gimme toro, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more
