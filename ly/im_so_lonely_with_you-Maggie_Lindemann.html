		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lately I've been 
thinkin' I should be alone
'cause the room is getting colder (colder)
I keep holding on
To things no longer here
our love has disappeared (disappeared)

I, I've been fighting by your side
But I'm so lonely
I'm so lonely with you

I was looking for someone like you
But turns out happy endings just aren't true
'Cause times are changing, our love is fading out
But I was looking for someone like you

Baby, let me know
I can't keep this up forever
'Cause we just aren't good together, no

I, I've been fighting by your side
But I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely with you
Why?
Do I always have to be the one that's crying?
Feels like we're dying

I was looking for someone like you
But turns out happy endings just aren't true
'Cause times are changing, our love is fading out (fading out)
But I was looking for someone like you

Nothing really feels the same
But no one can take your place
I'm scared I won't be okay if you leave me

I was looking for someone like you
But turns out happy endings just aren't true
'Cause times are changing, our love is fading out (fading out)
But I was looking for someone like you
