		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Suddenly I heard the phone ring
I knew it was my destiny
Calling me from the Chateau Marmont lobby
"I feel as though I need a change," I said
You left and lit a cigarette
And casually said (wow)

Nothing's impossible (nothing's impossible)
Even with you (even with you)
Nothing's impossible (nothing's impossible)
Even with you

I close my eyes
And there beyond the horizon
I stand beneath the bright lights
And above me, written in the stars
Reads, the future

No-one is gonna stand in my way
Even if I have to leave this whole city aflame
I'd rather be a hustler on an eight ball pocket
Then a tattered tarot card in your fake ol' life and then

Funny how things unfold
'Cause they really, really, really don't have time to go
I had my fortune read
Would you believe what it said

Nothing's impossible (nothing's impossible)
Even with you (even with you)
Nothing's impossible (nothing's impossible)
