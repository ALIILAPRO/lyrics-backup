		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Soaring, is this allowed?
I sure bet my daddy proud,
A little nigga with a shaker smile,
On top of the dreams is where I'm found.
Some figured I was Satan-bound,
Until I came back with the style I found,
Then all of the sudden they fixed they're faces
Cause of who I know, and the trail of places,
That I've stepped, how many niggas wanna hate cause I left?
How could you blame me and my plan of attack,
Cause I'm risking my soul attack, now I'm heard all over the map.
Only rule of thumb, it don't really matter just where you from,
All that really matter is where you're goin' go,
Baby I'm stayin' for somethin',
But you can't rule out this caps of gun
Second chances givin' out for some
All you gotta do is take advantage,
Then maybe you can get yourself a horse and carriage,
Done pimpin' you can think about marriage,
Until then get it in,
Find yourself and let's begin,
I'm a tell you how in a minute,
I'm a show you how I be livin'
From a long time ago, a young nigga, he was timid,
Now I'm in the zone, seein' things so vivid,
I'm a soul, nah homie, not even,
I'm a zone now till I lose feeling,
Remember I'm a be gone way past November,
Even stay up there, up there, floatin', floatin', hopin' I could find peace somewhere.

In my mind, it sounds like ooh,
When I'm gone it feels like ooh,
When I'm zoned, I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright I forget about it all.

Ballin', is this allowed?
Without feeling like Shallow Hal,
Diamonds on the Jesus peace for style,
Back into the city right around,
Greetin' my niggas with dap 'n' pounds,
So if I fall I won't hit the ground,
These are the things that a make me smile,
Knowin' this blunt might burn a while,
I keep myself so lifted,
I am accustomed to new heights,
I feel perfect though they think it's worthless,
See what I might flight, man
Everybody wanna be a critic I have my life and I will live it
Shut your mouth before I fuck it
How are my jokes? They will love it
If I'm seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans,
More than likely I am faded man
Doin' other shit get ready where you goin',
Niggas just stand around hatin'
So my vice ace is when
The lights start flashin' 'n' I'll be soaring all alone 'n',
In the place my mind is going fill with songs and no-ones knowin'
And the devil with the harpin' dress tryin' ask me for one dance,
He think he slick but my guardians protects me from his wrath,
So in my place no hate shall enter, livin' high up there up there
Copin', copin', floatin', I will find peace somewhere

In my mind, it sounds like ooh
When I'm gone, it feels it likes ooh
When I'm zoned, I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright I forget about it all.

In my mind, it sounds like ooh
When I'm gone, it sounds it likes ooh
When I'm zoned, I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright I forget about it all.
