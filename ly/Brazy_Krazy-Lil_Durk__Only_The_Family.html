		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm just tryna get along with my niggas, they finessing and shit
What the fuck these bitches want from a nigga, DMX with this shit
I'ma turn up I can't wait on em I pop me a Perc for the layover
Nut on her face give the bitch a new makeover

I move to Atlanta my goal is to takeover
How you a gangsta but you put the jakes on 'em
They say I can't ride with no guns 'til my case over
I'm in Iraq with my dog like Beethoven

I brought a pound at Summer Jam
Ask Stunna no clowns from Instagram
In the school I be down with the glizzy jammed
No Doe Boy we in that mini van screaming mini man

Blood in my eyes nigga I cant see
Neighborhood hero that's what I'm destined to be
Every killer in the hood turned drug dealer kept investing in me
Gd's, BD's, Foes, Lords plus them O's when they face the east

These niggas don't slide tryna get revenge that shit crazy
They gave bro 10 I seen him cry like that shit brazy
He could've got away but he ain't wash that palm that shit crazy
Some niggas I love had watch me starve that shit brazy
That shit krazy
That shit brazy
That shit krazy
That shit brazy
That shit krazy
That shit brazy
That shit krazy
That shit brazy

Niggas ain't leave me with options
Tryna assassinate my character
That's when I catch the nigga I'ma pop him
Give me my sound back nigga I'm poppa
Fresh outta jail I brought shawty a chopper
Don't play with my name see there be the problem
I done mix Amiri's with the Prada

My daddy ain't raise no hoe and you know that
I can tell what type of nigga you is got a Glock 23 with promag
(Wit'cho goofy ass)
Shawty gon' kill for the skrilla like Kodak
I'm the first nigga from the block with a Rolex
Why you steady counting my pockets yo' poor ass
Let a nigga take yo' shit wit yo hoe ass nigga
(Bitch)

These niggas don't slide tryna get revenge that shit crazy
They gave bro ten, I seen him cry like that shit brazy
He coulda got away but he ain't wash that palm that shit crazy
Some niggas I love had watch me starve that shit brazy
That shit krazy
That shit brazy
That shit krazy
That shit brazy
That shit krazy
That shit brazy
That shit krazy
That shit brazy
