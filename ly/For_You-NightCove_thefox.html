		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now I can feel it coming
The symphony of voices in your head
The time has come for you to shine be ready
Something terrible is coming for you

Time is of the essence
Do not let me down (Down)
So many people in one place
Its time for us to make a presence
Time is of the essence
I won't let you down (Down)
So many people in one place
Oblivious just like you say
So just trust me this one time
I know you won't regret it
I know you are sick, but so am I

And I will be there for you
Through time as it tick, tick, tick, ticks
And I will be there for you
Through time as it tick, tick, tick, ticks
And I will be there for you

My darling
I know that there's certain things
That you should know
I know this comes with a price
That I'm willing to pay
Be ready, something terrible is coming
(Something terrible is coming)
Everything I've worked for
And everything I do
You know that there's a reason that
I do these things for you
I do it for the thrill, I do it for the fun
You've taught me there's a
Twisted usefulness in everyone
Let me prove my point, it will not disappoint
Just give me the word, I am ready
I am poised
Isn't this what a true friend would do?
I promised I would be there for you

And I will be there for you through time
And I will be there for you
