		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  An Angel's song is sung
Mary's time has come to best
The Lord will have a Son
Wise men come to welcome home the child

What child is this, who lay to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping
Whom Angels greet with anthem sweet
While shepards watch our keeping

This, this is Christ, the King
Whom shepards guard and Angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him love
The babe, the Son of Mary, Mary

An Angel's song is sung
Mary's time has come to best

So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh
Come peasant King to own Him
The King of Kings, salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone him

Praise, praise the Son on high
The Virgin sings her lullaby
Joy, joy, for Christ is born
The babe, the Son of Mary, Mary

An Angel's song is sung
Wise men come to welcome home the child

What child is this, who lay to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping
Whom Angels greet with anthem sweet
While shepards, shepards watch our keeping

An Angel's song is sung
Mary's time has come to best
The Lord will have a Son
Wise men come to welcome home the child

Mary's time has come to best
The Lord will have a Son
Wise men come to welcome home the child
