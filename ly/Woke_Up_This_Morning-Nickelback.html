		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I paid my last respects this mornin' on an early grave
Already said goodbye, nothin' left to say
A tiny church a tiny town and not a tear was spent
Not how I wanted it, I'm hating all of this

Well I'm hating, all of this
I'm hating, all of this
All of this, all of this
Now I know why, I hide my love from you some days
No, I don't mind keeping this bottled inside me
You came along and tore this wall down around me
Looks like you found me
Now I know why
I felt like shit when I woke up this morning

I've been a loser all my life, I'm not about to change
If you don't like it, there's the door, nobody made you stay
Ain't a woman on the planet who can deal with it
Just how I wanted it, I'm hating all of this

Well I'm hating, all of this
I'm hating, all of this
All of this, all of this
Now I know why, I hide my love from you some days
No, I don't mind keeping this bottled inside me
You came along and tore this wall down around me
Looks like you found me
Now I know why
I felt like shit when I woke up this morning

All of this, all of this
Now I know why, I hide my love from you some days
No, I don't mind keeping this bottled inside me
You came along and tore this wall down around me
Looks like you found me
Now I know why
I felt like shit when I woke up this morning
