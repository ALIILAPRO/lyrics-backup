		  Oh, Huncho did this?
DJ Durel

Steppin' up (Up), always take the risk (Up)
Livin' life (Life), go hard and don't quit (Go hard)
Drip, splash like the ice on the wrist (Brr, brr, brr, brr)
That's a call I can't miss (Brr, hello)
Set my goals like a go, hit the switch (Go, go)
Work, work, work, check it off the checklist (Work, work, work)

In a position to win (Win), in a position to go (Go)
In a position to win (Win), in a position to go (Go)
In a position to win (Uh, uh), in a position to go (Uh)
In a position to win (Uh), in a position to go (Uh, uh)

'Bout that action ('Bout that action)
Let's get active (let's get active)
That's what I'm askin' (What I'm askin')
Like what's happenin'? (What's happenin'?)
Skrrt skrrt, but don't crash it (No)
My diamonds clashin' (Baow)
Like an accident (Woop, woop)
I take high risks 'cause I'm passionate (High risk, go)
I get it fast, I'm grippin' the bag, I'm dashin' it (I get it fast, woo)
We 'bout to go undefeated in all of the matches (Undefeated, go)
We did it first, you do it the same, exactly (We did it first, hey, yeah yeah)

Woo, woo, woo, woo (Go, uh)
Woo, woo, woo, woo (Hey)
Woo, woo, woo, woo (What?)
Woo, woo, woo, woo (Skrrt skrrt)

In a position to win (Win), in a position to go (Go)
In a position to win (Win), in a position to go (Go)
In a position to win (Uh, uh), in a position to go (Uh)
In a position to win (Uh), in a position to go (Uh, uh, Offset)

I'm a star player, W's over L's
Touch down, the crowd yells
Succeed and we never fail
Whew, we out of here, yeah
Ooh, we gotta prevail
We comin' to raise hell
They hatin', they want us to fail
They was sleepin' on the gang and we bombed on 'em (Bombed on 'em)
We got 35 yards on the fourth on 'em
Skrrt skrrt, whew, hah, we outta here, whew, he gone
It's a touch down, we home
Been through the struggle, we strong
Teamwork, dreamwork, nobody did it alone
We hungry, eat to the bone
Nobody can copy and clone
In the position to win
What you gon' do when you won?
We gotta go a lil' harder
Learn from mistakes, be smarter

In a position to win (Win), in a position to go (Go)
In a position to win (Win), in a position to go (Go)
In a position to win (Uh, uh), in a position to go (Uh)
In a position to win (Uh), in a position to go (Uh, uh)

In a position to win, in a position to go (Go)
I'm turnin' the knob on ten (Ten)
And pushin' the pedal the floor (Floor)
I'm learnin' from all my losses (Losses)
I am the player and coach (Coach)
Look at the dab, it's awesome (Awesome)
Grab your pad, take notes (Notes)
I'm on the boat, they ridin' the wave
With no life vest, come float (Float)
I'm in a position, you in a position
What is you complainin' for? (Why?)
I'm in a position to win
You in a postion to lose for sure (For sure)
I got back my groove, I'm makin' a move
And I get the champion dough (Nah)
We came from the bottom and now we on top and we just gon' keep levelin' up (Up)
We here to go platinum and then we go diamond, go put the gold medal up (Up)
And we be rockin' so much gold 'cause we got the Midas touch (Midas)
Thinkin' that they in the race but they know ain't no competition with us (Nah)

In a position to win (Win), in a position to go (Go)
In a position to win (Win), in a position to go (Go)
In a position to win (Uh, uh), in a position to go (Uh)
In a position to win (Uh), in a position to go (Uh, uh)
