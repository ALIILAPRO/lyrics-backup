		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hear you've been telling all your friends that you're done with me
Like you always knew things wouldn't work out
And I've been hearing things from people that I don't want to talk to
Like it matters who you're sleeping with now

Can I erase from my mind anything that you said or 
Any time that we spent with each other?
I don't want to waste away another cell on a memory 
When you're just another meaningless lover

Forget the nights that we spent laughing 
Until the morning on your bedroom floor 
Without a thought about your roommate asleep down the hall
Forget the days we'd waste in bed, tangled
The smoke still on your breath
Undressed and pinning you up to the wall

And I swore I heard you talking when I was tossing in my sleep
You were always trying to walk in circles around me
I was out one night when I saw you and you froze me where I stood
I would hate you, I would hate you if I could

Forget the nights that we spent laughing 
Until the morning on your bedroom floor 
Without a thought about your roommate asleep down the hall
Forget the days we'd waste in bed, tangled
The smoke still on your breath
Undressed and pinning you up to the wall

I would hate you but I'm not finished yet
I would hate you but I'm not finished yet

Even you, up on that pedestal, the time will come 
When you will deconstruct yourself and remake what you are
When it does you'll remember me and the words I spoke 
And wonder how you ever could have strayed so far

Even you, up on that pedestal, the time will come 
When you will deconstruct yourself and remake what you are
When it does you'll remember me and the words I spoke 
And wonder how you ever could have strayed so far
