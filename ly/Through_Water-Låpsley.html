		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The majority of impacts will be felt through water
Through water
Through water
Next ten years
For the next ten years
This is followed by the failure of litigation and adaptation
Adaptation, litigation
Adapt, adapt, adapt, adapt
Litigation and adaptation

I think about the glass running out of sight
I think about the glass running out of sight
I got a conscience on my left and decisions in my right hand
I got a conscience on my left and decisions in my right hand
I think about the art underneath my feet
I think about the art underneath my feet
To the cars on the road, to the tarmac beneath my feet
To the cars on the road, to the tarmac beneath my feet

Adaptation, litigation
Adapt, adapt, adapt, adapt
Litigation and adaptation
Extreme weather events through crises
Through crises
Connected with the water and the water cycle
Connected with the water and the water cycle
Connected, connected

I think about the glass running out of sight
I got a conscience on my left and decisions in my right hand
I think about the art underneath my feet
To the cars on the road, to the tarmac beneath my feet

Adaptation, litigation
Adapt, adapt, adapt, adapt
Litigation and adaptation
Through water
