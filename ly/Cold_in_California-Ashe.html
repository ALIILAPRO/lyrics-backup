		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just out of reach is the gold your rushing for with bags under your eyes
I’ve been chasing a rainbow, wound up at your door, wanna see the other side

It’s not quite like I imagined, like I did before
When you’re pouring all your heart out
But you’re lying on the floor
All these cigarettes and hotels, could be what you’re looking for
But it’s not what you expected and you’re left wanting more

Don’t mind what anybody told ya
It still gets cold in California
See everybody thinks they know ya
They’re only seeing what they wanna
Don’t mind what anybody told ya
It still gets cold in California

We can dance in the streets with the sun upon our skin and wake up feeling burned
Under stars, we could freeze cause we’ve gotten used to heat where seasons never turn

It’s not quite like I imagined, like I did before
When you’re pouring all your heart out
But you’re lying on the floor
All these cigarettes and hotels, could be what you’re looking for
But it’s not what you expected and you’re left wanting more

Don’t mind what anybody told ya
It still gets cold in California
See everybody thinks they know ya
They’re only seeing what they wanna
Don’t mind what anybody told ya
It still gets cold in California

Talk about the pretty parts
The ones you see on film
Happiness and skinny legs and living on a hill
Don’t talk about the lonely parts, the loneliness you feel
You probably always will

Cause it gets dark in California

I know it well better than most ya
Don’t mind what anybody told ya
It still gets cold in California
See everybody thinks they know ya
They’re only seeing what they wanna
Don’t mind what anybody told ya
It still gets cold in California
