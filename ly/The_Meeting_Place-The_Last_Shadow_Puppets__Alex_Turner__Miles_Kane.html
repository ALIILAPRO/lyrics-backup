		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The colder the night gets
The further she strains
And he doesn't like it
Being this way

And she tried so hard
To steer away
From the meeting place
But her heart had left her there

She clings to his consciousness
Wherever he laid
Struggles to sleep at night
And during the day

He's worried she's waiting in his dreams
To drag him back to the meeting place
His love had left in there
Where the voices still echoes

[Chorus]
I'm sorry I met you darling
I'm sorry I met you
As she turned into the night
All he had was the words
"I'm sorry I met you darling
I'm sorry I left you"

Four weeks they had trolled around
Playing the fools
They knew the time would come
And time would be cruel

Because it is cruel to everyone
He is crying out from the meeting place
He stranded himself there
Where the voice still echo

[Chorus]

I'm sorry I met you darling
I'm sorry I've left you
