		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh run away, the past will bite again
Oh no matter where you dwell
You here again, a captive of the howl
You welcome back to hell

Faithful, as the full moon is rising
Beauty and the beast are colliding

Sharpened edge touch liquid flame
Deepened seed soaks anger's reign
Arching back, shape-shift derange
Father, how I watched you change

Am I savage?
Scratching at the door
Am I savage?
I don't recognize you anymore

Oh tooth is fang, twisting under skin
Oh foul tongue, black breath
Change snap inside, the beast about complete
Change soon infects the rest

Faithful, as the full moon is rising
Beauty and the beast are colliding

Sharpened edge touch liquid flame
Deepened seed soaks anger's reign
Arching back, shape-shift derange
Father, how I watched you change

Am I savage?
Howling at the door
Am I savage?
I don't recognize you anymore
Anymore

Oh inheritance, the past has bit again
Oh the next heir of anarchy
Feel stretching skin so far beyond belief
I feel the ever changing, you, in me

Am I savage?
Scratching at the door
Am I savage?
Howling evermore
Am I savage?
I don't recognize me anymore
Anymore
Anymore ha ha ha
Am I savage?
