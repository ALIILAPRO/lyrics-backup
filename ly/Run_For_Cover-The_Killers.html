		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What have you gathered to report to your progenitors?
Are your excuses any better than your senator's?
He held a conference and his wife was standing by his side
He did her dirty but no-one died

I saw Sonny Liston on the street last night
Black-fisted and strong singing Redemption Song
He motioned me to the sky
I heard heaven and thunder cry

Run for cover
Run while you can, baby, don't look back
You gotta run for cover
Don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man
You know you're not the only one
And don't look back, just run for cover

What are you waiting for, a kiss or an apology?
You think by now you'd have an A in toxicology
It's hard to pack the car when all you do is shame us
It's even harder when the dirtbag's famous

I saw my mother on the street last night
All pretty and strong, singing 'The Road Is Long'
I said 'momma I know you've tried'
But she fell on her knees and cried

Run for cover
Run while you can, baby, don't look back
You gotta run for cover
Don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man
I know you're not the only one
Don't look back, just run for cover

And there was nothing she wouldn't give
Just to trust him with her nightmares, with her dreams
She's running
She's running
Just to trust him
He got a big smile, he's fake news
Just run for cover, you've got nothing left to lose

Run for cover
Run while you can, baby, don't look back
You gotta run for cover
Don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man
You know you're not the only one
And don't look back, just run for cover
Run
Run 
(You know you're not the only)
Run for cover
