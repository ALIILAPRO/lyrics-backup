		  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Awesome as I wanna be
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Awesome as I wanna be

First, you see me ridin' on a sonic boom
Got my guitar shreddin' up my latest tune
There is nothin' you can do to beat me
I'm so good that you can't defeat me

Yeah, I'm awesome, take caution
Watch out for me, I'm awesome as I wanna be
(Yeah) I'm awesome, take caution
Watch out for me, I'm awesome as I wanna be

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Step aside now, you're just gettin' in my way
I got sick chops you could never hope to play
When it comes to makin' music, I'm the ruler
You wish you could be twenty percent cooler

Yeah, I'm awesome, take caution
Watch out for me, I'm awesome as I wanna be
(Yeah) I'm awesome, take caution
Watch out for me, I'm awesome as I wanna be
