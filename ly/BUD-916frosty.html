		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My nigga Deltah in them pots

I can't do no runner-up
(I can't do no runner-up)
Fucked her once, then now we're not in love
(Not in love)
I want you bad, but you called me "Bud"
I'ma go,  I'ma go grab my shades  (Shades)
Bitch wanna take my pesos
It was all a mistake
I'm the one who'll take the blame though
Got drugs on me, let the pain go
Swervin' out in the Range Rove'
Wanna see how my day go?
Double cup for my Faygo

Living inside my dream
Ain't really what it seems, now
Took a sip, it ain't clean (Clean)
So, I see seein' her as bling (Oh)
Got my goal and there's a team now
We're gonna mix the clean down
Throw in a little Balmain
Think I got my style, mane
She leave me on read
I'm regretting everything that I said (Said)
Said, "Hello" to the man on the Moon
(Man on the Moon)
Told me, "Frost, you just gotta stay cool"
(Cool) man, I thought you was my girl (Girl)
Everything I wanted in the world (World)
Now you dead, bitch leave her in a hearse
Tell it to the juror
Dow downing mine, as they wild out
Then the boy bending time now
I never get these people
Why they started acting nice now?
Who were there when the gods give
Told my boy to stop it
Drugs on me, you can't touch
Makin' her go bananas
Look at that man got ran up
(Got ran up, got ran up)
Water, my neck can't stand up
Stack to the bank like stand up
24 karat like Kobe
I'ma put on my whole team
Getting my bread, no whole wheat
Next up, what's that sold me

I can't do no runner-up
(I can't do no runner-up)
Fucked her once, then now we're not in love
(Not in love)
I want you bad, but you called me "Bud"
But-but you called me "Bud"
I'ma go, I'ma go grab my shades (Shades)
Bitch wanna take my pesos
I'ma go, I'ma go grab my shades (Shades)
Got drugs on me, let the pain go
Swervin' out in the Range Rove'
I'm the one who'll take the blame though
Wanna see how my day go?
Double cup for my Faygo

It-It was murder what she wrote
Every night she bring the dope
Even soda pop in the tub
Now she sayin' it's all a joke
Baby girl, you're just a fan
How you talking 'bout weddin' plans?
'Cause you know that I'm in demand
Doesn't matter, I'm alone in my head
(I'm alone in my head)
Crash the whip, I'm already a wreck
Everybody keep on lookin' to me
(Keep on lookin' to me)
You want a show? I ain't booking for free
Thought you had enough but I
Know you want more (Na na, na na na na)
Like, what else is in store?
Why you only want me when
I'm goin' on tour?
Shout-out to my ex, but I'm
Done with that whore, woah, woah
She sucked me for the clout (Clout)
She asked me for a towel
They wanna be like 916
No one can take my style
Let me just point this out (Own route)
We can find our own route (Own route)
Tell me, girl, what's your purpose?
I wanna hear you out
