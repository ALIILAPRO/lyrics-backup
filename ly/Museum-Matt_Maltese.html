		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's the school that you joined at five
The hospital where you came to life
Cemetery park where your friend's friend died
The metal bench by the riverside
Where you were touched for the very first time
She felt your stomach you reclined
There's the station where you made your mind up
You were gonna move away
But you'll never escape
Yes, you might change
But the people you were stay the same

Artifacts of the future
T-shirts worn by your first love
And the ghosts of your past hang around and say hi
In the museum of your
Life's a bitch and a wonder
Take a look in the mirror
All the ghosts of your past touch your shoulder sometimes
In the museum of your life

Tribute bands at the social club
Muscle guys, only out to pull
Recipes on the kitchen counter
Written by the ones now stuck
Six feet under
And time to time to time
They visit me on the bus

Artifacts of the future
T-shirts worn by your first love
And the ghosts of your past hang around and say hi
In the museum of your
Life's a bitch and a wonder
Take a look in the mirror
All the ghosts of your past touch your shoulder and smile
In the museum of your life

Yes, you might change but the people you were
Won't ever change, they're the people you were
Once upon a day, yeah, the people you were
Pop the champagne for the people you were
