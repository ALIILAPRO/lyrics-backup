		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What can I say of Your love
That has not already been said?
Were I to tell all the things You have done
I would run out of breath
So many songs have been sung
But how can I praise You enough?
So here's another one

Why
You love me like You love me
I'll never know
Why
You love me like You love me
Your love is
Better than silver
Better than gold
Better than anything I've ever known
I'll never know
Why
You love me like You love me
I'll never know

Real joy doesn't always feel like laughter, no
Blessings don't always come from the places I thought they would
Your love doesn't look anything like it does in Hollywood
You don't walk out when it's over
That's when I need You the most
I'll never know

Why
You love me like You love me
I'll never know
Why
You love me like You love me
Your love is
Better than silver
Better than gold
Better than anything I've ever known
I'll never know
Why
You love me like You love me
I'll never know
Why
Why
Why
You love me like You love me
I'll never know
Why
Why
Why
You love me like You love me
I'll never know

Even when I turn my back
You love me
Even when I curse Your name
You love me
And even when I broke Your heart
You love me
You love me
You love me
And when I make my bed in hell
You love me
When I don't even love myself
You love me
You're not the kind to cut and run
You love me
You love me
Yeah You love me

Why
You love me like You love me
I'll never know
Why
You love me like You love me
Your love is
Better than silver
Better than gold
Better than anything I've ever known
I'll never know
Why
You love me like You love me
I'll never know
