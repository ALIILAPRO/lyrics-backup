		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say the neon lights are bright
On Broadway (on Broadway)
They say there's always magic in the air (on Broadway)
But when you're walkin' down that street
And you ain't got enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere
They say the girls are somethin' else
On Broadway (on Broadway)
But lookin' at them just gives me the blues (on Broadway)
How ya gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes (on Broadway)
They say that I won't last too long on Broadway (on Broadway)
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home they all say (on Broadway)
But they're wrong, I know they are
I can play this here guitar
And I won't quit till I'm a star
On Broadway (on Broadway)
But they're wrong, I know they are
I can play this here guitar
And I won't quit till I'm a star on Broadway (on Broadway)
On Broadway (on Broadway)
I'm gonna make it, yeah (on Broadway)
I'll be a big, big man (on Broadway)
I'll have my name in lights (on Broadway)
Everybody gonna know me (on Broadway)
All up and down Broadway (on Broadway)
All up and down Broadway (on Broadway)
All up and down Broadway
