		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't let me down.
Don't let me down today.

Will I be there for you?
The worst is yet to come,
It's not gonna be easy but we are stronger than you thought.
Oh this world is not true, I won't try to go back home,
I'm going nowhere, my doubt becomes (your) fear,
Tell them I sold my soul.

Don't let me down today.
They are pissing me of and I pray they're going to make a mistake.
My head's fucked up and I won't be the man you all wanted me to be.
We are all sinking and there will be no escape.

We've talked enough to say:
You're probably the worst thing inside my head,
Don't look away.
This is the world of pain,
You're lost and you're missing the whole concept
Of you and me.

It's not gonna be easy
But we are stronger than you thought,
This world is not true bwah
I won't try to go back home.
Fighting to save ourselves.
Fuck.

This is a world of fucking pain…
This is a world of fucking pain…

We've talked enough to say:
(We've talked enough to say)
You're probably the worst thing inside my head,
Don't look away.
This is the world of pain,
You're lost and you're missing the whole concept
Of you and me.

We've talked enough to say:
You're probably the worst thing inside my head,
Don't look away.
This is the world of pain,
You're lost and you're missing the whole concept
Of you and me.
