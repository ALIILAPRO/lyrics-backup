		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You buy the drink at the bar
You wanna fuck in the car
I'll show you just who you are
You said goodbye at the bar
I guess it's right if it's wrong
Yeah, I see, yeah, I see
It's a one time hit for a nigga, for a nigga like me
Yeah, I see, yeah, I see
It's a one time hit for a nigga, for a nigga like me

Think I'm in the ceiling when you fuckin' with a star (star)
Girl, just drop a pin, I'm pulling up to where you are (pulling up)
Everything I get it come with options 'cause I'm famous
Had a special moment, still can't tell you what her name is (no)
Plug into your socket, let me be the one in charge (I'm the one)
I can be your mirror, I can show you who you are (yes I can)
Can't be seen in public with you, I'm taking a risk
Every time you use your phone, I think you're being slick (whoa)
Focus on the moment, don't know how long we'll live
I know that she going, she got tats on her ribs
There's not a lot of people that can do what I did
Damn near suicidal, almost slit both my wrists
Soon as I pull up, it's just as fast as I'm gone
I've been going off, don't know how long I'll stay on
See it in your eyes, you wanna fuck me 'cause I'm lit
I'll let you decide, you gotta make it quick

You buy the drink at the bar
You wanna fuck in the car
I'll show you just who you are
You said goodbye at the bar
I guess it's right if it's wrong
Yeah, I see, yeah, I see
It's a one time hit for a nigga, for a nigga like me
Yeah, I see, yeah, I see
It's a one time hit for a nigga, for a nigga like me

Yeah, pretty bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom
Lucky, lucky charm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pressure made diamonds look icy
Maneuverin' through the trenches so swiftly
'Bout a bulletproof the chest, solitary
Covered up in chinchillas and LV
All these diamonds on me curb, bitch, fast scene
One and one, I wanna put it on you, girl, rare breed
Totally loaded, fully auto', I'm fully aware of the envy
I'm going for throttle, hittin' the gas, no ignition
Pollution in my club, so I'm on drugs when I hit it
Like a VIP now, you can head on a mission
Gone off the screws, sixteen ounces of Wock'
Bitch a mermaid and she trip down the water
I hit it and she pray to a nigga like a God
Cleaning like a maid every time she give me mop
I know my swagger gotta always be up to par
Smash on this bitch, make money on my day off
(Bitch a mermaid and she trip down the water)
(I hit it and she pray to a nigga like a God)

You buy the drink at the bar (yeah)
You wanna fuck in the car (you wanna fuck in the car)
I'll show you just who you are (I'll show you just who you are)
You said goodbye at the bar (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I guess it's right if it's wrong
Yeah, I see (yeah, I see), yeah, I see (yeah, I see)
It's a one time hit for a nigga, for a nigga like me (for a nigga like me)
Yeah, I see, yeah, I see
It's a one time hit for a nigga, for a nigga like me (Wheezy outta here)
