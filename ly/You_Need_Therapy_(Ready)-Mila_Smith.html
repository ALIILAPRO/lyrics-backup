		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You shouldn’t call me on a Sunday
Must have LOST your mind -
I thought I told you we were over.

Your empty promises
The devil - in - disguise -
I had to shake you off my shoulder.

You say the therapy will help you
“Re-align”
But I don’t see it. 
Cause you don’t mean it.

I’m disappointed 
But I can’t - say-  I’m - surprised.
Cause you’re conceited - 
And I don’t need it. 

I don’t need you here to right your wrongs.
You’re the one that’s shattered
And all alone.

Take your white flag home…

I’ve never felt more free. 
You’ve got no hold on me.
I used to be in agony
Now I’m 10 feet off the ground and I am 
Ready
Ready
Oh 
I’m ready.
Ready…

I’m ready - 
To take control of my own life.
You’re LONELY 
You cry yourself to sleep at night.

I don’t care. 

Won’t be there to console ya, 
Now it’s over over over
And I finally found my closure, yeah.

I don’t need you here to right your wrongs.
You’re the one that’s shattered -
And all alone.

Take your white flag home…

I’ve never felt more free.
You’ve got no hold on me. 
I used to be in agony
Now I’m 10 feet off the ground and I am 
Ready
Ready
Oh 
I’m Ready
Ready…

I’ve never felt more free.
You’ve got no hold on me. 
I used to be in agony
Now I’m 10 feet off the ground and I am 
Ready
Ready
Oh 
I’m Ready
Ready…
