		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In Napoli beside the sea
It happened on a night like this
In Napoli our hearts were free
And we surrendered to a kiss

There 'neath the stars I saw heaven in her eyes
There 'neath the stars I knew this was paradise
All through the night in sweet delight
We shared the tenderness of love
But with the dawn my love was gone
Just like the fading stars above
My lonely heart cries out "Please, come back to me"
Beside the sea in dear old Napoli

There 'neath the stars I saw heaven in her eyes
There 'neath the stars I knew this was paradise
All through the night in sweet delight
We shared the tenderness of love
But with the dawn my love was gone
Just like the fading stars above
My lonely heart cries out "Please, come back to me"
Beside the sea in dear old Napoli
