		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This time you should take me away
We stop at nothing
At all
Take a chance now
Right now
'Cause now I'm losing control
I'm ready to go
This time
You should take me away
To a new place
Where we just might
Keep an eye on the sky
This time
We'll be crossing the lights
Take me somewhere new
Let's do it
This time
This time
This time
You should take me away
To a new place
Where we just might
Keep an eye on the sky
This time
We'll be crossing the lights
Take me somewhere new
Let's do it
This time
This time
Why don't we step out
Of line
Lets just have a
Good time
Forget about the
To do's
And open the doors
This time
You should take me away
To a new place
Where we just might
Keep an eye on the sky
This time
You should take me away
To a new place
Where we just might
Keep an eye on the sky
This time
We'll be crossing the lights
Take me somewhere new
Let's do it
This time
This time
This time
