		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It is like I am trying to speak to you through a spirit trumpet
My voice, nothing more than a vague whisper, too indistinct
It makes you wonder if it was just the wind

I am a ghost to you
And you don't believe in ghosts
But here is where I am bound to dwell
Under your invisibility spell
Hoping to be noticed

It is like I am trying to reach you through a ouija board
But I cannot seem to communicate during the séance
And now you got me blowing light bulbs all together at once

I am a ghost to you
And you don't believe in ghosts
But here is where I am bound to dwell
Under your invisibility spell
Hoping to be noticed

Ooh ooh, do you see me now? Ooh ooh, can you hear me now?
Ooh ooh, do you see me now? Ooh ooh, can you hear me now?
Boo!

I'm a ghost to you
And you don't believe in ghosts
But here is where I am bound to dwell
Under your invisibility spell
Hoping to be noticed
I am a ghost to you
And you don't believe in ghosts
But here is where I am bound to dwell
Under your invisibility spell
Hoping to be noticed
