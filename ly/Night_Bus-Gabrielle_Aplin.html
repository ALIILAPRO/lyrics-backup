		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm on the night bus
I'm thinking about us
The streetlights go fleeting by
The man sat next to me
Is texting somebody
I wonder what that feels like
Maybe I'm reckless
But I just can't shake this
It follows me home at night, at night
It's getting clearer every mile we ride

Suddenly I know
That I'm on my way home
To you for the last time
It's not what you wanted
But I know you got this
And you're gonna be fine
Oh, I've just been watching
The world as it's turning
And that's what it feels like
Suddenly I know
That I'm on my way home
To you for the last time

I'm on the night bus
That's crawling with lovers
Who hide from the cold white light
I see my reflection
Dazed and complacent
She follows me home at night, at night
It's getting clearer every mile we ride

Suddenly I know
That I'm on my way home
To you for the last time
It's not what you wanted
But I know you got this
And you're gonna be fine
Oh, I've just been watching
The world as it's turning
And that's what it feels like
Suddenly I know
That I'm on my way home
To you for the last time

At night, at night, at night
It's getting clearer every mile we ride

Suddenly I know
That I'm on my way home
To you for the last time
It's not what you wanted
But I know you got this
And you're gonna be fine
Oh, I've just been watching
The world as it's turning
And that's what it feels like
Suddenly I know
That I'm on my way home
To you for the last time
