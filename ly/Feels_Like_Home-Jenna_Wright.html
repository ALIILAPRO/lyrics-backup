		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sitting in a parked car dark outside
Overthinking everything inside my mind
I’m out of my head and I’m out of my soul
I know I gotta take a break and gotta let it go
Little did you know that you’re the reason I’m alive
All those stupid conversations up on face time
Too late. When I was at a low
And you didn’t even know you were keeping me alive, cause

Something 'bout you really feels like home
Something 'bout you really feels so safe
I could sit and talk to you all day cus
Something 'bout you feels free free yeah yeah
Something 'bout you really feels like home
Something 'bout you really feels so safe
I could sit and talk to you all day
I’m safe and sound

In the night in the middle of a rainstorm
Take the back way, take some time to be alone
Too afraid, too afraid to get close to you
Too afraid, too afraid of myself
Little did you know that you’re the reason I’m alive
All those stupid conversations up on face time
Too late when I was at a low
And you didn’t even know you were keeping me alive, cause

Something 'bout you really feels like home
Something 'bout you really feels so safe
I could sit and talk to you all day cus
Something 'bout you feels free free yeah yeah
Something 'bout you really feels like home
Something 'bout you really feels so safe
I could sit and talk to you all day
I’m safe and sound

Safe and sound safe and sound
Safe and sound safe and sound
Little did you know that you’re the reason I’m alive
All those stupid conversations up on face time
Too late. When I was at a low
And you didn’t even know you were keeping me alive, cause

Something 'bout you really feels like home
Something 'bout you really feels so safe
I could sit and talk to you all day cus
Something 'bout you feels free free yeah yeah
Something 'bout you really feels like home
Something 'bout you really feels so safe
I could sit and talk to you all day
I’m safe and sound
