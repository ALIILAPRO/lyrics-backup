		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Far in the distance
Where did you go?
Without even goodbyes
How could I know?
But I'm still watching
The leaves falling
Down and down the road
But
You're saying your last words
And go
Reaching the deep end
Why did you go?
I wish every second
That you're back home
I'm still picturing
Your car leaving
On and on the road
Cause
You've said your last words
Now you're gone
I'm still picturing
Your car leaving
On and on the road
