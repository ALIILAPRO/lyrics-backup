		  Resentment

I need a short term fix for a long term problem
Can I learn to love these chains?
I know I had a point but now I forgot it
While I'm circling the drain

No, I can't stop feeling like every day's exactly the same
With a one track mind I don't think I can change
Trapped in memories, stuck on replay, replay, replay

Starts with a spark, then it's a wildfire
Burning me up, burning me up
I dance with demons on a high wire
Lift me up, lifting me up
Resentment

You know I lost my voice when I let the rot in
Hard truth cuts both ways
Pourin' out my heart, all that's unforgiven
Washin' over me like rain

No, I can't stop feeling like every day's exactly the same
With a one track mind I don't think I can change
Trapped in memories, stuck on replay, replay, replay

Starts with a spark, then it's a wildfire
Burning me up, burning me up
I dance with demons on a high wire
Lift me up, lifting me up
Resentment

I've got this chip on my shoulder
So I press the issues on sight
For all who need introduction
Welcome to the eye of the tiger, go

Starts with a spark, then it's a wildfire
Burning me up, burning me up
I dance with demons on a high wire
Lift me up, lifting me up
Starts with a spark, then it's a wildfire
Burning me up, burning me up
I dance with demons on a high wire
Lift me up, lifting me up

It's a wildfire
It's a wildfire (resentment)
It's a wildfire
It's a wildfire (resentment)
