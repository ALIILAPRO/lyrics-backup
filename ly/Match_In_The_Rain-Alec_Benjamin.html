		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Seems you've been changin' lately
I can feel the distance in your touch
There's two people in this hallway
But there's only one of us
That's tryna keep this fire goin'
Should I just give up?
I sense trouble on the horizon
I'm afraid our time is up

The clouds are rollin' in, I feel you driftin' away
And though my intuition tells me that it's too late
That in these conditions, tryna bring back the flame
Is like tryna light a match in the rain
I still want to make you love me, make you love me again
Even though my intuition tells me that it's the end
That in these conditions, tryna bring back the flame
Is like tryna light a match in the rain

Yeah, I can taste it, it's the end
This love's impossible to save
Though you embrace it, I can't face it
So I look the other way
There's trouble in your eyes
But I pretend that we're okay
I wish that we could compromise
But there's just nothin' left to say

The clouds are rollin' in, I feel you driftin' away
And though my intuition tells me that it's too late
That in these conditions, tryna bring back the flame
Is like tryna light a match in the rain
I still want to make you love me, make you love me again
Even though my intuition tells me that it's the end
That in these conditions, tryna bring back the flame
Is like tryna light a match in the rain

Tryna light a match in the rain
Like flyin' a kite in a hurricane
Like ridin' a bike with no air or chain
On a broken road, it's a losing game
Tryna light a match in the rain
Like flyin' a kite in a hurricane
Like ridin' a bike with no air or chain
On a broken road, it's a losing game

The clouds are rollin' in, I feel you driftin' away
And though my intuition tells me that it's too late
That in these conditions, tryna bring back the flame
Is like tryna light a match in the rain
I still want to make you love me, make you love me again
Even though my intuition tells me that it's the end
That in these conditions, tryna bring back the flame
Is like tryna light a match in the rain
