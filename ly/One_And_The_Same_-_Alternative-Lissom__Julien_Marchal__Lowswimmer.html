		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's on the back of my creation
A paperback abdication, it cropped me
One and the same, weakened my hope
It's gotta be one and the same, sure
One and the same

An almanac of speculation
I took the glass elevator, it stopped me
Wanting to say "because I don't"
It's gotta be one and the same, sure
One and the same

Let me have it my words failed back there
Seven hours staring blank and scared
Get me out of here get me out of here

It's gotta be one and the same
It's gotta be one and the same
It's gotta be one and the same
It's gotta be one and the same
