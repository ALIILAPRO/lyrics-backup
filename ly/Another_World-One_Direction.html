		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's not me, it's not you, there's a reason
I'm just tryna' read the signals I'm receiving
Just like a stone on fire, can you feel it
I don't know about you girl but I believe it

Words will be just words
Till you bring them to life

I'll lift you up, I'll never stop
You know I'll take you to another world
I'll build you up, I'll never stop
You know I'll take you to another world

Everyday, in every way
Oh

I'll lift you up, I'll never stop
You know I'll take you to another world

One for me, one for you, whatcha doing?
Girl the music sounds so good when you're movin'
Let me take you higher, let me prove it
'Cause, hey, hey, pretty girl, I believe it

Words will be just words
Till you bring them to life

I'll lift you up, I'll never stop
You know I'll take you to another world
I'll build you up, I'll never stop
You know I'll take you to another world

Everyday, in every way (in every way)
Oh

I'll lift you up, I'll never stop
You know I'll take you to another world
Take you to another world
You know I'll take you to another world

Baby let me find out your secret
Just let me in and let me show you that I keep it
Close to my heart jump in the deep end
Just let me in and let me show you what I'm meaning

I'll lift you up, I'll never stop
You know I'll take you to another world
I'll build you up, I'll never stop
You know I'll take you to another world

Everyday (everyday), in every way (in every way)
Oh

I'll lift you up, I'll never stop
You know I'll take you to another world

Take you to another world

Oh yeah

You know I'll take you to another world

I'll build you up, I'll never stop
You know I'll take you to another world

Yeah

Take you to another world

I'll lift you up, I'll never stop
