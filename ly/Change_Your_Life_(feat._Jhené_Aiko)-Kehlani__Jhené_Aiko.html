		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I heard that you a gang-gang-gangsta
Not one to try to sa-sa-save her
Always focus on your paper
Don't got time to wager with your heart
I'm tryin' to switch up your cadence
Book flights and vaca-ca-cations
Tequila and rela-la-lations
Kissin' on new places, oh whoa

Baby, let me change your life
You wanna see (everything)
That you can be anything you want (anything)
Baby, let me change your life
You oughta be (everything)
You oughta be anything (anything)
Baby, I can make you right
You wanna see (everything)
That you can be anything you want (anything)
Baby, let me change your life
You wanna be (everything)
You wanna be anything (anything)
You could be anything, everything (yeah)

I'm not sayin' that you incomplete, but
Just imagine what we'd be if we became one
You deserve someone that'll take you to another level
Let me put you on
You've got so much potential, I really am fuckin' with you
Just open your heart
I'm tryna get you right, take you to the other side

Baby, let me change your life
You wanna see (ooh, whoa)
That you can be anything you want
Baby, let me change your life
You oughta be (oughta be)
You oughta be anything (anything, yeah)
Baby, I can make you right (ooh, whoa)
You wanna see (I see)
That you can be anything you want (anything)
Baby, let me change your life (let me)
You wanna be (if you wanna be)
You wanna be anything
You could be anything, everything

Look, wanna be a lover? I can teach you love, yeah
Wanna be a hubby? You can wife me up (yeah)
Wanna be a chef? Go on and spice it up
Wanna be a boxer? Beat it up, don't ever need no glove
Wanna retire, different bitches your lifestyle
Used-to-be models, IG honeys all shaped like bottles
But now you seein' that it's more than body, face, and smile (yeah)
You see me, and you look beyond it, you feel inspired (yeah)
I'm here to excel with you
Here to break bread with you
Here to travel the world and sleep in different beds with you
Here to make revenue
Know it's impressin' you

Baby, let me change your life
You wanna see (everything)
That you can be anything you want (anything)
Baby, let me change your life
You oughta be (everything)
You oughta be anything (anything)
Baby, I can make you right
You wanna see (everything)
That you can be anything you want (anything)
Baby, let me change your life
You wanna be (anything)
You wanna be anything (anything, wanna be)
You could be anything, everything
