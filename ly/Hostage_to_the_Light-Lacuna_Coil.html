		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the silence
The whistling gets louder in my ears
(Whisper in my ears)
The wind is blowing stronger
It's hard to keep my feet upon the ground
'Cause I'm ready to fly

Now this is who you are
Angel without wings
Sinner in disguise
Don't wonder why
You have never tried to
Believe in yourself become a hostage to the light

In this light
I'm feeling safe so calm and unafraid
A bird without a cage
And now I have to take these chances
Won't take off without jumping off the edge
'Cause I'm ready to fly

Now this is who you are
Angel without wings
Sinner in disguise
Don't wonder why
You have never tried to
Believe in yourself become a hostage to the light

I'm a hero in the bright light
In this world of false illusions in my head
I'm a zero in the dark night
I'm a prisoner I'm hostage to the light

Now this is who you are
Angel without wings
Sinner in disguise
Don't wonder why
You have never tried to
Believe in yourself become a hostage to the light

A world of false illusions in my head
Deep inside my head, deep inside my head
A world of false illusions in my head
Deep inside my head, deep inside my head
