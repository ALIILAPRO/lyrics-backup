		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You never came within periphery
And I was fine, yeah it was good for me
Just for a time after a distant dream
But now just like that, the distance don’t mean anything

I can’t escape
You told me that this happens all the time
I can’t escape
The ebb and flow and then you flood my mind

I tried letting go
But you just let me in
I tried running away
But you seem to chase me down again
And I can’t escape from your magnetic pull
No matter how many miles away I go
You’re always less than zero

I tried letting go
But you just let me in
I tried running away
But you seem to chase me down again
And I can’t escape from your magnetic pull
No matter how many miles away I go
You’re always less than zero

You never came within periphery
And I was fine, yeah it was good for me
Just for a time after a distant dream
But now just like that, the distance don’t mean anything

I can’t escape
You told me that this happens all the time
I can’t escape
The ebb and flow and then you flood my mind
