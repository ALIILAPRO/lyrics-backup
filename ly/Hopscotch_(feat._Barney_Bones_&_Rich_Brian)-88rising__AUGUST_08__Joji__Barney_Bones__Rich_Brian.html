Hopscotch shawty jumpin' out a cool whip
Hopscotch shawty jumpin' out a cool whip
Hopscotch shawty jumpin' out a cool whip
Hopscotch shawty jumpin' out a cool whip
Hopscotch shawty jumpin' out a cool whip
Hopscotch shawty jumpin' out a cool whip
Hopscotch shawty jumpin' out a cool whip
Hopscotch shawty jumpin' out a cool whip

All she wanna do is go crazy (go crazy)
Showed her how to live, I said, "Boom, nothin' crazy" (nothin' crazy)
Valley girls love a hood nigga, it's amazin' (it's amazin')
Took her to the block so the Rock did Vegas (ayo)
Ayy, she gon' give it up in the back of my truck (ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
With the windows rolled down, yellin', "I don't give a fuck" (ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Keep it light, keep it light, keep it bright (ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Pussy tight, late night off a flight (Midnight Mafia)

Young nigga bought the trap
When I'm hoppin' I go rap
Fifteen bands, diamonds fallin' off my neck
Where the rest? Where the rest? You talkin' 'bout baguettes? (Where it at?)
'Til the homies catch you slippin', rip the Cuban off your neck
No, you don't wanna move back to DC
Shake it, daddy had you drippin' like Fiji
Kill the pussy 'til I'm talkin' like ouija
You got a Range, why you talkin' like you need me? Bitch

Hopscotch shawty jumpin' out a cool whip
Hopscotch shawty jumpin' out a cool whip
Hopscotch shawty jumpin' out a cool whip
Hopscotch shawty jumpin' out a cool whip
Hopscotch shawty jumpin' out a cool whip
Hopscotch shawty jumpin' out a cool whip
Hopscotch shawty jumpin' out a cool whip
Hopscotch shawty jumpin' out a cool whip

Singin' through the block, singin' through the block
Cookin' like the rock, I'm cookin' like I'm bak'
Serve it to my sons, I serve it 'til it's done
I just do my dance when they wanna see me run (see me run, see me run)
Bitch, I am Sean Mendes
I just touched down like mothafuckin' Jets (like the mothafuckin' Jets)
Now I'm in Paris, smokin' baguettes (poppin' pills)
Eating calamari with feelin', gettin' rich (gettin' rich, gettin' rich)
I hop off the train, I hop off the plane
Ain't nothin' wrong, baby, ain't nothin' changed
I talk to dogs and the dogs talk to me
I got the sauce, it's bolognese

Ayy, uh
It's bolognese, bitch (ayy), I'm chillin' with your chick (ayy)
And we quiet, watchin' Les Mis
She got me something, let's just say she left my hotel brainless (ayy)
I like my women short and loud, like the movie trailers (ayy)
My money tall, it's lookin' like it's playin' for the Lakers (yuh)
Cameras on me everywhere I move (when I move)
Joji in the booth, he lookin' cute (he cute as fuck)
She comin' over, we gon' cook some food (cook some food)
Even though we know I'm only eatin' cooch (ayy)
Shout to August even though we never hang when I'm in town (bitch)
Gettin' top by flight attendants, call that shit head in the clouds (ayy)
I get motivated when they talkin' down, it get me down (woo)
I don't call it paradise, man, I just call that shit my house (woo, woo)
Three bedrooms, two bath, one pool, one fireplace
Two palm trees, 37 bitches smashed, uh
One driveway, deep voice, good dick
Don't be surprised that she chose me
I provided what you lacked (ayy)

Hopscotch shawty jumpin' out a cool whip
Hopscotch shawty jumpin' out a cool whip
Hopscotch shawty jumpin' out a cool whip
Hopscotch shawty jumpin' out a cool whip
Hopscotch shawty jumpin' out a cool whip
Hopscotch shawty jumpin' out a cool whip
Hopscotch shawty jumpin' out a cool whip
Hopscotch shawty jumpin' out a cool whip
