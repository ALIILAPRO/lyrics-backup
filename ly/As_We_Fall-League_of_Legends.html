		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me, where do I go?
Tell me, where do I take us?
Your heart is starting to slow
May the water be safer, as I dive in

Blood stains washing underneath the waves (as we fall, as we fall)
I'll be reaching out to keep you safe (as we fall, as we fall)

As we fall
I can't hold on much longer
We're drifting down to the other side
Tried to pull us under
Keep holding out for the other side

Keep holding out for the other side

Tell me where do I go
Tell me where do I take us
Tell me where do I go
Tell me where do I take us
Your heart is starting to slow
May the water be safer, as I dive in
Tell me where do I go
Tell me where do I go 
Tell me where do I go
Tell me where do I take us
Tell me where do I go
Tell me where do I take us
Your heart is starting to slow
May the water be safer, as I dive in

As we fall
I can't hold on much longer
We're drifting down to the other side
Tried to pull us under
Keep holding out for the other side

Keep holding out for the other side
