		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Think of your lifetime as one day,
It's fading away,
The shadows are growing long.

Think of existence as a flame,
And death as rain.
Storm clouds there right along.

At life's eve our flames will cease,
Eternally, unavoidably.
Eventually all paths will lead to the cemetery.

We are but falling leaves in the air, hovering down.
Unaware we are spinning around.
Scattered fragments of time,
Like blinks of an eye.
We are, that's all we are.

Think of your lifetime as one year,
Look, autumn is here.
Getting colder, the winter's impending.

Your conclusion's drawing near,
Certain, austere.
Yes, only the circle's unending.

At life's eve our flames will cease,
Eternally, unavoidably.
Eventually all paths will lead to the cemetery.
To the prior deceased.

We are but falling leaves in the air, hovering down.
Unaware we will hit the ground
Scattered fragments of time,
Like blinks of an eye.
We are, just when we realize that we are alive, we die.
