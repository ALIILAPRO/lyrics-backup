		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, can you feel it?
I can
It's good, hmm, yeah
Now move it, hmmm

Everybody that's on the dancefloor
I want you to put your hands together
And just smoothe your hips from side to side
(Keep the fire burning)
Yeah, that's it, you got it, hmmm-mmm

Now, mister DJ (Keep the fire burning)
I want you to countdown with
It's your time to be a star
(Keep the fire burning)
Ooh ooh ooh
Yeah, can you feel it?

You gotta write it, baby
(Keep the fire burning)
(Keep the fire burning)
Yeah, it's good to me
(Keep the fire burning)
I know you feel it somehow

(Keep it burning hot)
Get up, Larry
Listen

Keep the fires burning, keep the fires burning
Keep them burning hot
Work on your love, yeah (Yeah!)
You gotta give it all you've got

We spend a lot of time searching for love
And never know where it's coming from
And as soon as we get it somehow
We seem to think that our work is done

But the same thing it took to get that love
Are the things that you'll have to do to keep it
You gotta stay on your J.O.B.
You gotta give a little, take a lot
Give it all you got, oh

Keep the fires burning, keep the fires burning
Keep them burning hot
You gotta work on your love, yeah (Yeah!)
You gotta give it all you've got

We say a lot of things that we really mean
To each other when love is new
Lots of promises and all the things we've said
And the things we intended to do

But as time goes by things get cold and dry
There's no more water in the well
And there ain't no way that two can come together
If we stay locked in our cell, oh

Keep the fires burning, keep the fires burning
Keep them burning hot, hmmm
You gotta work on your love, yeah (Yeah!)
You gotta give it all you've got, oh

(Work on it) Oh, you've gotta work on it
(Work on it) Work on it, yeah, yeah
(Work on it)

Keep the fires burning, keep the fires burning
Keep them burning hot, y'all, aha
You gotta work on your love, yeah (Yeah!)
You gotta give it all you've got

We spend a lot of time searching for love
And never know where it's coming from
And as soon as we get it some lord, somehow
We seem to think that our work is done

And the same thing it took to get that love
Are the things that you'll have to do to keep it
You gotta stay on your J.O.B., yeah
You gotta give a little, take a lot
Give it all you got

Keep it burning, keep it burning, oh, lord
(Keep it burning hot) It's good
Oh, keep the fires burning, keep the fires burning
Keep them burning hot
Oh, oh, oh

Keep it burning!
(Keep it burning hot) Aha, yeah yeah, ooh ooh ooh
(Keep the fire burning, keep the fire burning)
(Keep it burning hot) Keep it burning hot

Oooh, so, so, so good
When it's, ooh, so, so, tight, can't take
Good, ooh, ooh, ah

(Keep the fire burning, keep the fire burning)
(Keep it burning hot) You gotta give it all, now give it all
(Keep the fire burning, keep the fire burning)
(Keep it burning hot) I'm warning you, ooh

(Keep the fire burning, keep the fire burning)
(Keep it burning hot) Keep it burning, oh
(Keep the fires burning, keep the fires burning)
(Keep it burning hot) ooh, ah!
