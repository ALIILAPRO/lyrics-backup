		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You ain't coming back I noticed that today
Got a 40 poured up that I think will erase the pain
We both understand now that it'll never be the same
But I can never forget the fact that you went away
Doesn't really matter what the fuck I got to say
You knew you were my homie ever since the hallway
You had my back knowing that I was lonely
And can never forget the fact that you went away

Now you're gone and you left some empty space
There's a room that needs to be filled with your embrace
You saw me cry I saw you cry I couldn't look you in the face
Cause you knew it was too late
And I'm forever sorry if ever made you feel guilty
There is nothing wrong with you
It's something wrong with me
Always kept it one hundred
Never kept it fifty-fifty
You always had the time for me
You always had the time for me

You good?
I'm okey
Cigarette is burning and I think you got the ashtray
When you left you lit a fire like propane
Everything we argued about that was so lame

You ain't coming back I noticed that today
Got a 40 poured up that I think will erase the pain
We both understand now that it'll never be the same
But I can never forget the fact that you went away
Doesn't really matter what the fuck I got to say
You knew you were my homie ever since the hallway
You had my back knowing that I was lonely
And can never forget the fact that you went away

I feel like everybody just keep on leaving me
What do you see in me?
Do you believe in me?
Can you forgive me
I know it's not easy
It's not How It's supposed to be
I know that you're lonely
I know that you think of us cause I do too
I know I said what I said
Overthinking what I should've said
Ain't it obvious
You're in my mind when you're not here
You're always stuck up in my head
Put your weight on my shoulders I can handle it

I wish you the best and you know it
Don't you ever doubt yourself lil homie
You can always call when you need to
I know you left but I'll never leave you

You ain't coming back I noticed that today
Got a 40 poured up that I think will erase the pain
We both understand now that it'll never be the same
But I can never forget the fact that you went away
Doesn't really matter what the fuck I got to say
You knew you were my homie ever since the hallway
You had my back knowing that I was lonely
And can never forget the fact that you went away
