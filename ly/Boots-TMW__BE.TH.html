		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You told me I was way too young
Never fast enough to run
Never good enough for you

You always played the better cards
Never did let down your guard
Never really let me in

These boots are made for walking
and I’ll walk away from you
Cause I am done playing the fool
That was following your rules

These boots are made for walking
and I’ll walk away from you
Cause I am done playing the fool
That was following your rules

These boots are made for walking
And that’s just what they do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you
These boots are made for walking
And that’s just what they do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you


You had me caught up in a game
Never underestimate
Never eat right where you sleep

You really drove the faster car
Never ever got me far
Never let me win the race

These boots are made for walking
and I’ll walk away from you
Cause I am done playing the fool
That was following your rules
These boots are made for walking
and I’ll walk away from you
Cause I am done playing the fool
That was following your rules

These boots are made for walking
that’s just what they do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you
These boots are made for walking
that’s just what they do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

These boots are made for walking
and I’ll walk away from you
Cause I am done playing the fool
That was following your rules
These boots are made for walking
and I’ll walk away from you
Cause I am done playing the fool
That was following your rules
