		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Me personally, I've always been the one to encourage my friends to chase they dreams, like
You know what I'm sayin'?

Get to thinkin' 'bout Eeshan, your time finally here
Miss Bridges told me she miss Daijha, I could've shed a tear
My cousin wrote me and told me he love to see me live
Been gone for twelve summers, locked up eleven years
And brighter days are ahead, see it clear
Sometimes it be like that, keep going
You only get one life to live, it's alright to heal
Stop looking backwards and move forwards (yeah, yeah)

Nothing's promised in this life, you could leave any day, any day
And who the fuck made up hard times anyways? Anyways, anyways
You gotta shoot for the stars, reach for the sky
You can't be stuck on the past when your future is bright
You gotta patch up your pain and live your life
Can't let it bring you down, don't let it pass you by
It'll pass you by, don't let it pass you by (youngin)
Can't let it pass you by, don't let it pass you by
Don't let it pass you by (youngin), don't let it pass you by

Skippin' school, causin' drama, I'm so sorry for it, mama
I tried to do it right, but it was hard times in that bottom
I was broke sleepin' on that couch, my brother hit that lick without me
It's okay, my time comin', one day, I'm gon' be shinin'
Thankful we ain't buy the dreams they sold us
Now we ridin' through that bottom with the doors up
My lil' cousin grab the mic, I hope he blow up
Front my youngin twenty bags and tell him grow up, 'cause-

Nothing's promised in this life, you could leave any day, any day
And who the fuck made up hard times anyways? Anyways
You gotta shoot for the stars, reach for the sky
You can't be stuck on the past when your future is bright
You gotta patch up your pain and live your life
Can't let it bring you down, don't let it pass you by
It'll pass you by, don't let it pass you by
Can't let it pass you by, pass you by (you only get one life to live, you know what I'm sayin'?)
Don't let it pass you by (don't waste your shot, you heard me?), don't let it pass you by

Yeah, whatever, whatever you got love for, you know?
You never know
Shit, might be tomorrow, it might be next year, might be tonight, you heard me?
Do that shit, man
