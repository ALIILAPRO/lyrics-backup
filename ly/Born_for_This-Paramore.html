		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh no, I just keep on falling (Back to the same old)
And where's hope, when misery comes crawling? (Oh my way, eh)
With your fate, you'll trigger a landslide (Victory)
To kill off this common sense of mine

And it takes acquired minds
To taste, to taste, to taste this wine
You can't down it with your eyes
So we don't need the headlines
We don't need the headlines, we just want 
We want the airwaves back, we want the airwaves back

Everybody sing
Like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me do you feel the pressure now?
Everybody live
Like it's the last day you will ever see
Tell me, tell me do you feel the pressure now?

Right now, you're the only reason (I'm not letting go, oh)
And time out, if everyone's worth pleasing (Well ha)
You'll trigger a landslide (Victory)
To kill off the finite state of mind

And it takes acquired minds
To taste, to taste, to taste this wine
You can't down it with your eyes
So we don't meet the headlines
No, we don't want your headlines, we just want 
We want the airwaves back, we want the airwaves back

Everybody sing
Like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me do you feel the pressure now?
Everybody live
Like it's the last day you will ever see
Tell me, tell me do you feel the pressure now?
Everybody sing
Like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me do you feel the pressure?

Alright, so you think you're ready?
OK, then you say this with me, go
We were born for this (we were born for this)

Alright, so you think you're ready?
OK, then you say this with me, go
We were born for this (we were born for this)
We were born for this (we were born for this)
We were born for, we were born for

Everybody sing
Like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me can you feel the pressure?
Everybody live
Like it's the last day you will ever see
Tell me, tell me can you feel the pressure now?
Everybody sing
Like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me can you feel the pressure?
Tell me, tell me can you feel the pressure?

We were born for this (we were born for this)
We were born for this
