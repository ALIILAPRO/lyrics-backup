		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I don't know why I came here tonight
I got the feeling that something ain't right
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
And I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs
Clowns to the left of me
Jokers to the right, here I am
Stuck in the middle with you

Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you
And I'm wondering what it is I should do
It's so hard to keep this smile from my face
Losing control, yeah, I'm all over the place
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you

Well, you started out with nothing
And you're proud that you're a self made man
And your friends, they all come crawlin'
Slap you on the back and say
Please, please

Trying to make some sense of it all
But I can see it makes no sense at all
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor
'Cause I don't think that I can take anymore
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you

And you started out with nothing
And you're proud that you're a self made man
And your friends, they all come crawlin'
Slap you on the back and say
Please, please

Well, I don't know why I came here tonight
I got the feeling that something ain't right
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
And I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs
Clowns to the left of me
Jokers to the right, here I am
Stuck in the middle with you
Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you
Stuck in the middle with you
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
