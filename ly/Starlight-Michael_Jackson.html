		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's indication
That someone else is standing on the ground
Across the nation
There's always people trying to pull you down
Now is the time
For us to spend this evening close together, yeah
Deep in the night
We're holding on to someone else's dream
Girl, can't you see?

We need some starlight, starlight sun
There ain't no second chance
We got to make it while we can
We'll need the starlight, some starlight sun
I need you by my side you give me
Starlight, starlight, starlight, yeah

They're out to get you
There ain't no issue, you're acting like a fool
Love can possess you
And make you see that heart is gonna move
High in the night
This magic's gonna keep us close together, yeah
We'll start to fly
'Cause this is the beginning of your life
Baby, tonight

Give me some starlight, starlight sun
This is the only chance
We've got to make it while we can
You'll need the starlight, starlight sun
I need you by my side so give me
Starlight, starlight, starlight (starlight)

Light up the world, let the love start take charge of this masquerade
Take every memory and show me that this is no lie
(We'll shine so bright)
Give me your starlight tonight

There's indication
That someone else is standing on the ground
Across the nation
There's always people trying to pull you down
Now is the time
For us to spend this evening close together
Deep in the night
We're holding on to someone else's dream
Girl, can't you see

We need some starlight, starlight sun
There ain't no second chance
We've got to make it while we can
You'll need the starlight, starlight sun
I need you by my side so give me
Starlight, starlight
Give me starlight, starlight sun
There ain't no second chance
We've got to make it while we can
You'll need the starlight, starlight sun
I need you by my side so give me
Starlight, starlight
Give me starlight, starlight sun
There ain't no second chance
We've got to make it while we can
You'll need the starlight, starlight sun
I need you by my side so give me
Starlight, starlight, starlight

Give me, give me that sun
Give me, give me that sun, ooh yeah
Give me, give me that sun, ooh yeah
Give me, give me that sun, ooh babe
Give me, give me that sun, we got to be together
Give me, give me that sun, starlight sun
Give me, give me that sun, yeah
Give me, give me that sun, ooh babe
Starlight (starlight)
Starlight (starlight)
Starlight (starlight)
Starlight (starlight)
Starlight
Star, starlight
Starlight (we got to make with while we can)
