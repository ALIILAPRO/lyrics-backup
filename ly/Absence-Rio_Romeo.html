		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I leave tomorrow
Would you be alright
Would you be filled with sorrow
Would you put up a fight
How can I protect you
When I don’t feel alright

If I just vanished
Do you think you’d manage
Or would you disappear right beside me
Do you think you’re ready
When I go unsteady
Lover, please prepare for my absence

If I left the country
Would you search and search
Or would you give up easy
And find me in the dirt
Would I live forever
Or blend right into earth

If I just vanished
Do you think you’d manage
Or would you disappear right beside me
Do you think you’re ready
When I go unsteady
Lover, please prepare for my absence

Absence makes the heart grow stronger
Pray my baby will not squander
Everything to gain by my leaving
And if I can return the favor
Pray my baby always savors
Every moment we were both present

Cause if I just vanished
Do you think you’d manage
Or would you disappear right beside me
Do you think you’re ready
When I go unsteady
Lover, please prepare for my absence
