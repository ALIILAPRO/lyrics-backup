		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Told you I'm moving out to bigger and better things
Guess you never know how good you got it 'til it's gone
Thought I could find somebody new who could take your place
The list goes on, and on, and on

There was Nikki, Nicole, Tiffany, and Heather
But there's only room for you in my world
But you say that I changed like the east coast weather
How the hell did I get caught up?
Messin' with these LA girls

I miss my baby
I'm missin' my baby (LA girls)
I miss my baby
Messin' with these LA girls

I miss the days we'd take a Greyhound to NYC (NYC)
Wish I could have seen that it was perfect how it was
Listen, I don't want this to be the way you remember me
'Cause I know I was wrong, wrong

There was Nikki, Nicole, Tiffany, and Heather
But there's only room for you in my world
But you say that I changed like the east coast weather
How the hell did I get caught up?
Messin' with these LA girls

I miss my baby
I'm missin' my baby (LA girls)
I miss my baby
Messin' with these LA girls

I miss my baby
I'm missin' my baby (LA girls)
I miss my baby
Messin' with these LA girls

1, 2, 3
Talk to me like, ooh ooh ooh
Quit messin' with my baby
Oh ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah!
Ooh, ooh, oh oh
Ooh, ooh

There was Nikki, Nicole, Tiffany, and Heather
But there's only room for you in my world
But you say that I changed like the east coast weather
How the hell did I get caught up?
Messin' with these LA girls

I miss my baby
I'm missin' my baby (LA girls)
I miss my baby
Messin' with these LA girls ('m missing my baby!)

I miss my baby
I'm missin' my baby (LA girls)
I miss my baby
Messin' with these LA girls

I miss my baby
I'm missin' my baby (LA girls)
I miss my baby
Oh oh, these LA girls

I miss my baby (baby!)
I'm missin' my baby (LA girls)
I miss my baby
Messin' with these LA girls
