		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I get like this, I give myself the creeps
Like a newborn cub on little shaky feet
Stumbling around, trying to find some ground
What a joke, always thrashing around
'Til I figure it out and then I choke

I cannot let my feelings keep-keep hijacking my brain
They've got a gun against my head
I'm gonna make my way around this wall, I cannot change
They've got a gun against my head
I cannot let my feelings keep-keep hijacking my brain
They've got a gun against my head
I'm gonna make my way around this wall, I cannot change
They've got a gun against my head

In my head
In my head
In my head
In my head

I was so upset, I saw them selling me out
Right there on Los Feliz Boulevard
They were selling me cheap out there on the street
Poster sized, large as life
There were tears in my eyes and so I drove on by

I cannot let my feelings keep-keep hijacking my brain
They've got a gun against my head
I'm gonna think my way around this wall, I cannot change
They've got a gun against my head
I cannot let my feelings keep-keep hijacking my brain
They've got a gun against my head
I'm gonna make my way around this wall, I cannot change
They've got a gun against my head

(In my head) I gotta bend or we will fall
My reality's a metaphor
Success is big and failure small
And I'm one inch shy of feeling tall

So I drive on home, my tail between my legs, mmm
I'm deadbeat tired and a bit of a mess, mmm
Feeling all refreshed and brimming with hope
All my intentions are good and then I choke

I cannot let my feelings keep-keep hijacking my brain
They've got a gun against my head
I'm gonna make my way around this wall, I cannot change
They've got a gun against my head
I cannot let my feelings keep-keep hijacking my brain
They've got a gun against my head
I'm gonna make my way around this wall, I cannot change
They've got a gun against my head

In my head
In my head
In my head
In my head

I give myself the creeps
I give myself the creeps
