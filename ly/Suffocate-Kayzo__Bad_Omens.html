		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This burden comes with a price
You can't afford to pay
The wheel of fire will burn
Get the fuck out!

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

I found the hay you locked away
It speaks in tongues a human couldn't replicate
You don't know yet what you are
It couldn't go but it couldn't stay
Now we're throwin' you into a bigger flame
I think we may have gone too far

You don't get what you deserve
No, you get what you take
The wheel of fire will burn
And blow up in your face
The burden comes with a price
I don't think you can pay
The wheels of fire will burn
And yet you'll suffocate

The wheels of fire will burn
And yet you'll suffocate

Suffocate

And as I spin out of control
Every second takes me further down the rabbit hole
The devil now holds all the cards
He's listening and takin' note
The gate is closing to a soul you never sold
You were his right from the start

You don't get what you deserve
No, you get what you take
The wheel of fire will burn
And blow up in your face
The burden comes with a price
I don't think you can pay

The wheel of fire will burn
And yet you'll suffocate

This isn't messed up

The wheels of fire will burn
And yet you'll suffocate
