		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll fight for you
Love you enough to die for you
I'll try for you
Yea I believe enough to die for you

There's only one thing that I know
Ain't nobody loves me better
And I don't let it take control
I wanna look at you forever
Baby can I just take you home
Ain't nobody loves me better
And I don't let it take control
I wanna look at you forever

There's only one thing that I know
And I don't let it take control
Baby can I just take you home
And I don't let it take control

I'll fight for you
Love you enough to die for you (whoa)
I'll try for you
Yea I believe enough to die for you

When I look you in the eyes (oh yeah)
Baby I can't look away (I can't)
It couldn't be better tonight (oh no)
Baby let's do this again (let's do it)
I know what I gotta do (I know)
And I'll Take away the pain (I will)
Tell me that you love me too (tell me)
I know what I gotta say

There's only one thing that I know
Ain't nobody loves me better
And I don't let it take control
I wanna look at you forever
Baby can I just take you home
Ain't nobody loves me better
And I don't let it take control
I wanna look at you forever

There's only one thing that I know (oh yeah)
And I don't let it take control (no I don't let it take control)
Baby can I just take you home (baby can I just take you home)
And I don't let it take control (no I don't let it take control)
