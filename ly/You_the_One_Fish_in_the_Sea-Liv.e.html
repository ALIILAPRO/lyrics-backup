		  dont let me confuse you

oh baby boy…you know you’re the only thing that’s on my mind

(collect that peso i gots to collect that peso/ except that money ive gots to get that money)

oh now now baby boy..

(i just want this to last for ever!!!)

forever more!
(ever more)

(oh really? oh really what it sound like?)

and baby
