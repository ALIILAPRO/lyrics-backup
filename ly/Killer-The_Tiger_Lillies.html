		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha 

I could've been a killer
Who thought that he was God
My victims all mere mortals
All filthy dogs 

I could've, I could've, I could've, should've been
A killing, killing, killing, killing, killing machine 

I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha 

I could've been a killer
Who ate his victims' flesh
I could've eat them rotten
I could've eat them fresh 

I could've, I could've, I could've, I could've, I could've, could've been
A killing, killing, killing machine 

I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha 

I could've been a killer 

I could've been a killer
Children suffocate
Then laughed at all the mothers
Whose hearts I did break 

I could've, could've, could've, could've, could've, could've been
A killing, killing, killing, killing, killing machine 

Yeah, I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha 

And I could've been a killer 

I could've been a killer
Who thought that he was God
My victims all mere mortals
All filthy dogs 

I could've, I could've, I could've, should've been
A killing, killing, killing, killing, killing machine 

Yeah, I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
Killing machine
Killing machine
