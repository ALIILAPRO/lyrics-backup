		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Blowin up my phone you know I never pick up
I'm on my own I'm smoking dope I got some liquor in my cup
Can't break my heart it's made of chrome I'm just too in my zone
I tried to warn her ass before but she ain't leave me alone
I'm in a C63 going 125 then I open my eyes I can't believe I'm alive still
I know you saved my life but we both gonna die still
Don't see where I'm going cause I'm rolling off 5 pills

Take a walk through the belly of the beast
Hit the devil and tell his ass he was talking with me
I keep a pistol in my bed sitting right on the sheets
I'm on a level that's somewhere that you ain't never gonna be
Talk to me gotta watch your tone bitch
I could cut you offer quicker than a fuckin lane switch
I could put you on but you gotta know the basics
I could get you knocked for the price of my bracelet

Show me a sign if you hear me
I was really on now I grown so weary
I could see your face but I'm staring at the ceiling
I could feel your touch but you ain't even near me 
I could see better when the lights turn off
I could do better so I wrote this song for you
Black and white leather and I'm smashing on the pedal
Back to back benzes now I'm moving presidential

Ice on my neck should have a price on my head
I been up a couple days I'll go to sleep when I'm dead
I got a lot up on my mind why I had so much I said
I got a lot up in this cup you take one sip and you're dead

Take a walk through the belly of the beast
Hit the devil and tell his ass he was talking with me
I keep a pistol in my bed sitting right on the sheets
I'm on a level that's somewhere that you ain't never gonna be
Talk to me gotta watch your tone bitch
I could cut you offer quicker than a fuckin lane switch
I could put you on but you gotta know the basics
I could get you knocked for the price of my bracelet
