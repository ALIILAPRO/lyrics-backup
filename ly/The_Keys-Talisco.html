		  Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya
You have the magic core
Feel free to see once more

Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya
You have the magic core
Feel free to see once more

We can dance in hell, or
We can drive in hell
It will be over

We can dance in hell, or
We can drive in hell
It will be over

We have the keys
Playground of kids
We are not alone yet
Enjoy my dear

We have the keys
Playground of kids
We are not alone yet
Enjoy my dear

We don't need to have dreams, we enjoy the moments
We have the keys
We have the keys
We don't need to have dreams, we enjoy the moments
We have the keys
We have the keys

Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya
You have the magic core
Feel free to see once more

Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya
You have the magic core
Feel free to see once more

We can dance in hell, or
We can drive in hell
It will be over

We can dance in hell, or
We can drive in hell
It will be over

We have the keys
And there's no joker
We have the keys
And we are across the line

We have the keys
And there's no joker
We have the keys
And we are across the line

We don't need to have dreams, we enjoy the moments
We have the keys
We have the keys
We don't need to have dreams, we enjoy the moments
We have the keys
We have the keys

Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya
You have the magic core
Feel free to see once more

Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya
You have the magic core
Feel free to see once more

We can dance in hell, or
We can drive in hell
It will be over

We can dance in hell, or
We can drive in hell
It will be over

No more pain
And no more rules on your way
And you'll never ever complain

No pain
No rules on your way
And you'll never ever complain

Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya
You have the magic core
Feel free to see once more

Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya
You have the magic core
Feel free to see once more

We can dance in hell, or
We can drive in hell
It will be over

We can dance in hell, or
We can drive in hell
It will be over
