		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it my imagination?
Is it something that I'm taking?
All the smiles that I'm faking
Everything is great
Everything is fucking great

Going out every weekend
Staring at the stars or the ceiling
Hollywood friends, got to see them
Such a good time
I believe it this time

Tuesday night
Glazed over eyes
Just one more pint or five
Does it even matter anyway?

We're dancing on tables
'Til I'm off my face
With all of my people
And it couldn't get better they say

We're singing "til last call
And it's all out of tune
Should be laughing, but there's something wrong
And it hits you when the lights go on
Shit, maybe I miss you

Just like that and I'm sober
I'm asking myself, is it over?
Maybe I was lying when I told you
"Everything is great
Everything is fucking great"

And all of these thoughts and the feeling
Doesn't matter if you don't need them
I've been checking my phone all evening
Such a good time
I believe it this time

Tuesday night
Glazed over eyes
Just one more pint or five
Does it even matter anyway?

We're dancing on tables
'Til I'm off my face
With all of my people
And it couldn't get better they say

We're singing 'til last call
And it's all out of tune
Should be laughing, but there's something wrong
And it hits you when the lights go on
Shit, maybe I miss you

Now I'm asking my friends how I should say I'm sorry
They say "Lad, give it time, there's no need to worry"
And we can't even be on the phone now
And I can't even be with you alone now

Oh how, shit changes
We were in love
Now, we're strangers
When I feel it coming up I just throw it all away
Get another two shots 'cause it doesn't matter anyway

We're dancing on tables
'Til I'm off my face
With all of my people
And it couldn't get better they say

We're singing 'til last call
And it's all out of tune
Should be laughing, but there's something wrong
And it hits you when the lights go on

We're dancing on tables
'Til I'm off my face
With all of my people
And it couldn't get better they say

We're singing 'til last call
And it's all out of tune
Should be laughing, but there's something wrong
And it hits you when the lights go on
Shit, maybe I'll miss you
