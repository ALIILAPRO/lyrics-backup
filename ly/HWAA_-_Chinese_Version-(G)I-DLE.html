		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
In the frozen dark of your winter, yeah
The coldest wind cruelly blows

Reaches up to kiss the highest mountain top
Burying my broken heart in snow
Breaking out of here

Get up, build a fire that'll overtake the ice
Gonna wipe it out
Get up, build a fire that is gonna dry the tears I've cried

And out of all the memories we shared
Grows a garden here instead
There wasn't any sun, there wasn't any moon
But my fire's shining through

Reddest red, all these flowers bloom
When my heart forgets your old distant tune
With my burning flame 
I'll ignite the sun just like the spring has come
Flames come alive

Hwaa 
Burn it up, burn it up
Hwaa 
The red flower grows

Hwaa 
Burn it up, burn it up
Hwaa 
The red flower grows

Yeah, too late to be tellin' me you're sorry
One more ice bullet through my body
Flames searing through what we won't get back
Just like summer buds blooming when winters season's up

It's coming back around, and I won't let you put me down
See you don't wanna be pushing that card to me
Go tell the ice my spring is coming 'round

I'm starting up my fire, stoking it up high
I'll win back springtime that I lost

Reddest red, all my flowers bloom
When my heart forgets your old wordless tune
And now with my flame 
I'll ignite the sun just like the spring has won
Flames come alive

Hwaa
Burn it up, burn it up
Hwaa 
The red flower grows

Hwaa
Burn it up, burn it up
Hwaa
The red flower grows

Higher and higher
The flame of my fire can grow (can grow) and grow
Burning and burning
It's finally time to let go, hwaa

Hwaa
Hwaa
Flames come alive

The new blossom grows
