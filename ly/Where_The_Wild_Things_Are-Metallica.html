		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So wake up sleepy one 
It's time to save your world 
Steal dreams and give to you 
Shop lift a thought or two 
All children touch the sun 
Burn fingers one by one 
By one 

Will this earth be good to you? 
Keep you clean or stain through? 

So wake up sleepy one 
It's time to save your world 
You're where the wild things are yeah 
Toy soldiers off to war 
Big eyes to open too 
Believing now under sun and moon 
But does heaven know you're here? 
And did they give you smiles or tears? 
No, no tears 

Will this earth be good to you? 
Keep you clean or stain through? 

So wake up sleepy one 
It's time to save your world 
You're where the wild things are yeah 

Toy soldiers off to war 
You swing your ass all down (hand puppets storm the beach 
(Fire trucks trapped out of reach, hand puppets storm the beach)
Call to arms, a trumpet's sound (fire trucks trapped out of reach all clowns reinforce the rear)
(Slingshots fire into the air)
Toy horses start the charge (all clowns reinforce the rear slingshots fire into the air)
Stuffed bears hold the hill till death crossfire from the marionettes)
Robots, chessmen standing guard (stuffed bears hold the hill till death crossfire from the marionettes)
We shall never surrender 
All you children touch the sun 
Burn your fingers one by one 
Will this earth be good to you? 
Keep you clean or stain through? 

So wake up sleepy one 
It's time to save your world 
You're where the wild things are yeah 
Toy soldiers off to war 
Off to war off to war 
So close your little eyes
