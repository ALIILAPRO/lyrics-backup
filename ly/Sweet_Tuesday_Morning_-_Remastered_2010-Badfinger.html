		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sweet Tuesday morning
You came and you smiled
And all of my fears, 
They have left me

Sweet Tuesday morning
You came and you smiled
And love is the answer you gave me

I've been to places all around, astound me
I've seen the breaking of the souvenirs
I'm in a brightness I can feel surround me
And it's the first time I've felt it for years

Sweet Tuesday morning, 
You came and you smiled
And love is the answer you gave me....mm-mhm

I've been to places all around, astound me
I've seen the breaking of the souvenirs
I'm in a brightness I can feel surround me
And it's the first time I've felt it for years
