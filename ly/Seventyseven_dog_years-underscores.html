		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Good luck)

You brought your keys to the parking lot
And every time you played one of your songs
You'd make all the pauses extra long
Give the drama some time I guess
I hated it but I took what I could get
In the trunk of your car at 9AM
Waiting for the doors to open up

Oh, what to do?
Now that you're over and out
Have you noticed your hounds have grown so old
Since I learned what you did?
(Pony up motherfucker)
To pay for your sins

I didn't know I was out of the loop
My mother seemed like she'd already had it with you
You were a stranger but I went to up to bat for you
Oh my God, I hadn't even knew
And then I saw her heart break, I cracked it in two
The whole reason we were raised detached from the group
It was always a reaction to you

Oh, what to do?
Now that you're over it now
Have you noticed your hounds have grown so old
Since I learned what you did?
(Pony up, motherfucker)
To pay for your sins

And when you're done with that song of yours
I'd like to sing you mine
Oh, what to do?
Oh, what to do?
And when you meet with that god of yours
I hope you see the light
Oh, what to do?
Oh, what to do?
You must've forgotten those dogs of yours
I see them walking 'round
Oh, what to do?
Oh, what to do?
And did you drop off that Mom of yours
Or is she still in the house?
Oh, what to do?

When you walked in, I got all riled up like our dog
If there's a threat to the pack, then she'll start to bark
And she means well, but it's funny to watch
She's only fifteen inches tall
She couldn't scare a fly off a wall

Oh, what to do?
Now that you're over and out
Have you noticed your hounds have grown so old
Since I learned what you did?
(Pony up, motherfucker)
