		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah
Backwoods, no scammer, back backwoods
No scammer mmm, mmm, yeah, wait
Check it out, she no use hands
Ayy, Teezr, that goes crazy

High like a plane, yeah
Backwoods, no scammer, yeah
If I could I would, yeah, but
She could not use hands, yeah
Smoking on Gs, yeah, not smoking on no tram
Yeah like treadmill, yeah, wanna come
Find your man, yeah
Thought you could tell, I'm wishing you well
But I fill up a whale
With the drip as you tell
Drop 'bout a pound, yeah, say
You could tell, uh, yeah
That was just wrong, uh, yeah

Blue strips, had deep blue strips, on God
Running, running, running home
I just need to follow it through
Hunnids, hunnids, thumbing through
Big racks on me, I couldn't handle them
New D&G, yeah, it go ruthless
'Bout outta the park, Babe Ruth, bitch
Pop an X pill, turn it up, stupid
If you need cash, I'ma do it
"Chill out, smoke up, don't do it"
I just woke up, made music
I don't want no confusion
I done ran inside holding the semi (yeah)
She be going mad, she go nuts
Counting these fucking blue hunnids
Yeah, 'cause she be mad that I won't love her
You see, you feeling alright
Believe what you see, we aight, yeah
Carats and millions tonight, yeah
Yeah, I'm feeling the vibe, yeah
Doing some right, writing the vibes
Living like
Ice, I paid the price, different prize
Needs a new shine need a new shine

High like a plane, yeah
Backwoods, no scammer, yeah
If I could I would, yeah, but
She could not use hands, yeah
Smoking on Gs, yeah, not smoking on no tram
Yeah like treadmill, yeah, wanna come
Find your man, yeah
Thought you could tell, I'm wishing you well
But I fill up a whale
With the drip as you tell
Drop 'bout a pound, yeah, say
You could tell, uh, yeah
That was just wrong, uh, yeah
