		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw a stranger
He was wiry
He was handsome
He was handsome and he was talking in his sleep
He's looking out for me
What a love

I saw a stranger
And he saw me
He was handsome
He was dancing and he
Swept me off my feet
When he grabbed a hold of me
And the morning set us free

Well how are you stranger and
How have you been?
You said, three Hail Marys for
To wash away my sin

But baby, I'm guilty
Silver barrel spinning
Gold teeth shining, guilty
And it's hard to let you in
I don't know how

(One, two, three, four)
She was a stranger
On the forty seven line
I looked into her big room
And she looked into mine
It was like we were the same
It was like we were the same person

I got a stranger
I'm ashamed of
He keeps coming out
He keeps coming out
Every time I dream
Gets angry
(He gets angry and I)
Starts crying

Well how are you stranger
And how have you been
You said
Three Hail Mary's for to wash away my sin

But baby I'm guilty
Silver barrel spinning
Gold teeth shining
Guilty
And it's hard to let you in
I don't know how

I saw a stranger
Pass me on the street
Her eyes were so like yours
And it took me there
Completely unprepared
When I kissed you on the stairs

Oh, stranger
She is right here
She's watching me
She's watching me
Like baby go ahead
She really fucked it up this time
But I know you needed friends so it's alright

Well how are you stranger
And how have you been
You said
Three Hail Mary's for to wash away my sin

But baby I'm guilty
Silver barrel spinning
Gold teeth shining
Guilty
And it's hard to let you in
And I don't know how
