		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Would you like to share your lunch with me?
I'd surely be delighted to be the one you give the last Oreo to
If that's alright with you
Do you wanna sit next to me on the bus home?
I told my mom not to pick me up today
I hope that that's okay

'Cause this kindergarten crush has got my stomach all twisted
Sweeter than sugar, lover, I'm addicted
My brain is doing bunny loops, I'm a disaster
Everything you do just makes my heart beat faster

I'm too scared to talk to you
I try to keep my courage but I end up getting nervous
And my face goes blue
You stick to me like
Every time I wanna tell you how I feel
I freeze up, my knees start to shake
And the way you look is so unreal
(You're my own Achilles heel)

And this kindergarten crush has got my stomach all twisted
Sweeter than sugar, lover, I'm addicted
My brain is doing bunny loops, I'm a disaster
Everything you do just makes my heart beat faster

Oh, this kindergarten crush is gettin' me wrong
I don't know what to do, so I wrote you a song
And this thing is going further than originally planned
So I hope you don't mind if I ask you to hold my hand
