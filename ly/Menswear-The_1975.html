		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "Well I only brought three, what you lookin' at me for?"
She's dressed in white and putting off crying
"Well you're the best man, so what's the plan?
Why don't you talk to Matty about it?"
I said, "I only brought three like I told you before
We're gonna have to ask about"

Free bar, that's the point
Spilling Amaretto 'cause of previous joints
I'm sitting with a girl, fortunate placing
Preceding railing racket off a porcelain basin
And who's he? Giving you the lips?
I've never seen him knockin' about
He looks just like me, but six foot three
So I reckon you could knock him out

"Well, I think I'll say a couple of words if you don't mind
I never really got on with your bird the first time
I met her out, dressed in nowt
Tellin' everybody you were shagging about"
Well, who's this? Going for the kiss
I'm probably gonna yosh in your mouth
Because it's five past three, I can hardly see
And I'm on the verge of passing out
