		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lot of fuck shit goin' on
Know what I mean?
If you, if you seein' some fuck shit, man, you better address it
(Hold up, Spiffy on this mofucker)

Please no cameras, do I look like Adam Sandler?
Where are your manners? You must not want green like Banner
Um, I'm a star, Star-Spangled Banner
You gotta keep a hammer
I'm a monster, is you on Hannah Montana?
Now I'm fuckin' these foreign hoes, I got stamina
Baby, come here, come put on your pajamas
Matter of fact, bick back, we gon' head to Atlanta
Um, and my baby got cute feet, like to rock sandals
Everywhere I go, strapped up like a sandal
R-I-P my brother, now it's time to light a candle (R-I-P)

Bring back that shit back, hold my drink,
Yeah I'm 'bout to wanna veer it off into the jungle
Yeah, show him that I have a bag of money now,
I'll never let another man feed my hunger
Put some respect on my name before, I put a check on your chain
Let that boy think it's a game
Like Crocodile Dundee I'ma take that boy down under
Dressed in all black in the middle of the summer
Way I'm poppin' my shit, man, I think I need a plumber
'Woods gonna roll, tumble
Pussy nigga, what he wanna be, no bumble
Pussy nigga didn't even see this comin'
Fuck the pussy good, she gon' lick this cum up
Good dope, upset the stomach, vomit
Flyin' down right over your bit' like comet

Please no cameras, do I look like Adam Sandler?
Where are your manners? You must not want green like Banner
Um, I'm a star, Star-Spangled Banner
You gotta keep a hammer
I'm a monster, is you on Hannah Montana?
Now I'm fuckin' these foreign hoes, I got stamina
Baby, come here, come put on your pajamas
Matter of fact, bick back, we gon' head to Atlanta
Um, and my baby got cute feet, like to rock sandals
Everywhere I go, strapped up like a sandal
R-I-P my brother, now it's time to light a candle (R-I-P)

Light up, light up
All you niggas life short, everybody wanna bite us
Got a green thumb, lookin' like Midas, everything I touch turn to gold
Tell your bro that your nigga wanna fight him
Now your nigga don't like him
Everybody wanna hop on the Wraith and ride 'em
Tell the boy don't fold
