		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woo! 'Cause You are my everything
And You know my mind my mind
Oh Lord I want to learn Your love
And I see You show the signs
To Your heart Oh Lord
'Cause You are my everything
And You know my mind my mind
Oh Lord I want to learn Your love
And I see You show the signs

My minds racing i can't fake this
Falling, pacing my oh my
Looking, waiting pacing, praying
All my night i need divine direction

Woo! 'Cause You are my everything
And You know my mind my mind
Oh Lord I want to learn Your love
And I see You show the signs
To Your heart Oh Lord
'Cause You are my everything
And You know my mind my mind
Oh Lord I want to learn Your love
And I see You show the signs
'Cause You are my everything
And You know my mind my mind
Oh Lord I want to learn Your love
And I see You show the signs
To Your heart Oh Lord
'Cause You are my everything
And You know my mind my mind
Oh Lord I want to learn Your love
And I see You show the signs

Take me back to what I knew before oh
The love that's true and pure
And You my Jesus calm the storm
Can You take me back to what
I knew before oh Lord?
The love that's true and pure in
You my Jesus calm the storm

Want to know Your love so bad
Want to go so there with You
Want to know Your love so bad
Want to go so there with You ooh, ooh
