		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Warm yourself by the fire, son
And the morning will come soon
I'll tell you stories of a better time
In a place that we once knew

Before we packed our bags
And left all this behind us in the dust
We had a place that we could call home
And a life no one could touch

Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!

We are the angry and the desperate
The hungry, and the cold
We're the ones who kept quiet
And always did what we were told

But we've been sweating while you slept so calm
In the safety of your home
We've been pulling out the nails that hold up
Everything you've known

Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!

So open your eyes, child
Let's be on our way
Broken windows and ashes
Are guiding the way

Keep quiet no longer
We'll sing through the day
Of the lives that we've lost
And the lives we've reclaimed

Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!

Don't hold me up
(I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
Don't hold me up
(I don't need your help)
No! No! No!
Don't hold me up!
(I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
Don't hold me up!
(I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
Don't let me down, down, down, down, down!
