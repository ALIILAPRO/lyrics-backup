		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was in the dead of night
I've been there before
Medicating works sometimes
I'm just trying to lose my train of thought
Only ever feelin' fine, and I'd prefer us to be close
I'd like to look you in the eyes
Not fearing, staring into the void, waitin' for replies
Just waitin' for replies

I've been trying to reach your mind, by strippin' all the poems
I've been watchin' dandelions growin' by the grove
And it's a shame, because I only came here for the love of you
Yeah, it's a shame, because I only came here for the love of you

I was in the dead of night
I've been there before
Medicating works sometimes
I'm just trying to lose repeated thoughts
Oh, you're over there, feeling fine
(I was in the dead of night)
Oh, I'd prefer it if we spoke
(I've been there before)
I'd like to look you in the eyes
Not 3 AM, staring into the void, waitin' for replies
Just waitin' for replies

I only came here to tell the truth
Have one small glass of red, then shoot home
Only came here to tell the truth
Have one small glass of red, then shoot home
I was in the dead of night (only came here to tell the truth)
I've been there before (have one small glass of red, then shoot home)
Medicating works sometimes (only came here to tell the truth)
I'm just trying to lose my train of thought (have one small glass of red, then shoot home)
Only ever feeling fine (I was in the dead of night)
And I'd prefer us to be close (I've been there before)
I'd like to look you in the eyes
Not fearing, staring into the void, waitin' for replies
Just waitin' for replies
