		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's things I haven't told you
I go out late at night
And I was to tell you
You'd see my different side

There's things I haven't told you
I go out late at night
And I was to tell you
You'd see my different side

There's things I haven't told you
I go out late at night
And I was to tell you
You'd see my different side

There's things I haven't told you
I go out late at night
And I was to tell you
You'd see my different side

There's things I haven't told you
I go out late at night
And I was to tell you
You'd see my different side

What the fuck

We don't care 
What you say 
I'm a do my thing 
From day to day 
(Get it?) 

We don't care 
What you think 
'Cause in this world 
It's swim or sink 
(What the fuck)
