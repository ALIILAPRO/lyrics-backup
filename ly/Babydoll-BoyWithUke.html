		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You got them purple socks, with the llamas on
I must have missed your call
And the drama all up in-between the walls
Of Nirvana, wanna make it all my fault
Make a scene

Babydoll, watch me fall
Oh, we could've had it all
Take me down, watch me drown
Clean the writing on the wall
Let the rain hit my face
I've been callin' out your name
Pull the trigger, run away
Run away, run away

No, I don't think we should hang out
I get confused when you're around
It's crazy as hell to say, I know
But I think it's time to let you go

I think it's time to let you go
I think it's time to let you go

Baby, you're making the day go by
So slow I may be mistaken
Waiting for moves to be made
Despite these walls I need to be patient
Lately it seems to be late for everything
I wish I could fake it
You say I'm hard to be there for
But your heart was always so vacant

Babydoll, watch me fall
Oh, we could've had it all
Take me down, watch me drown
Clean the writing on the wall
Let the rain hit my face
I've been calling out your name
Pull the trigger, run away
Run away, run away

No, I don't think we should hang out
I get confused when you're around
It's crazy as hell to say, I know
But I think it's time to let you go

If only I met you in my dreams
If only I was still asleep
We showed up at ten and left at night
'Cause you're the right one, at the wrong time

I think it's time to let you go
I think it's time to let you go
