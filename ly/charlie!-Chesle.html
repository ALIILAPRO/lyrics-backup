		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ooooh oooooh hey! 
ooooh oooooh hey! 
it's been so long since we talked 
said you found God in east Utah
I still drive around in the yukon
finally fixed the trunk to fit the futon 
my hearts beating
I lost meaning 
I stopped believing 
anxiety screaming
I know the reason 
out of control them demons 
you were my home believe me 
you were my home believe me 
ooooh oooooh hey! 
ooooh oooooh hey! 
I know charlie 
lost somebody
i'm somebody 
I know charlie 
lost somebody
i'm somebody 
it's been so long since someone listened
told myself I'm still a victim
all these new prescriptions told me i should be more distant 
I thought I was different but my mind needs some assistance 
I got all defensive, said goodbye to all our friendships 
I've been jaded
and I know 
I won't find you, anymore
I got demons baby
I release them babyooooh oooooh hey! 
ooooh oooooh hey! 
I know charlie 
lost somebody
i'm somebody 
I know charlie 
lost somebody
i'm somebody
