		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take my own life just to save yours
Drink it all down, just to throw it up
Take my own life just to save yours (just to save yours)

Take my own life just to save yours
I got a reputation that I can't deny
You're the superstar, entertain us (entertain us)

Entertain us
But please don't wake me up
I betrayed us
But us don't give a fuck
Kill myself today
Kill it all away
Broken path I made
Please just stay away

I know I fucked up before, but I won't do it again
And I got a lot of things that I wish I woulda said
And I'm the same damn fool when I wear that hat again
I know I fucked up and I can't make it right

Watch yourself, I can't slow down
This is who I am, can't be anyone else
So don't let me go, save yourself
Just save yourself, just save yourself
I was born to raise hell, I was born to take pills
I was born to chase mill's, I was born to cave in
I was born to fuck hoes, I was born to fuck up
I was born to, what a shame

Take my own life just to save yours
Drink it all down, just to throw it up
Take my own life just to save yours (just to save yours)

Take my own life just to save yours
I got a reputation that I can't deny
You're the superstar, entertain us (entertain us)

Cut my thumb up
Count my check, count my check
Let me choke on 
My cigarette, cigarette
Cut my thumb up
Count my check, count my check
Let me choke on 
My cigarettes and heavy debt
