		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Go, go, go)

Oh, let me go
Let me go
Let me go, lover
Let me be
Set me free
From your spell

You made me weep
Cut me deep
I can't sleep, lover
I was cursed 
From the first
Day I fell

You don't want me
But you want me
To go on wanting you
Now I pray that
You will say that
We're through

Please turn me loose
What's the use?
Let me go, lover
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go

You made me weep
Cut me deep
I can't sleep, lover
I was cursed 
From the first
Day I fell

You don't want me
But you want me
To go on wanting you
Now I pray that
You will say that
We're through

Please turn me loose
What's the use?
Let me go, lover
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go
