		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh-ooh
Ooh

Livin' in a daydream
She said, "Love me like you paid me"
You know I'll be gone for so long
So give me all of your love, give me something to dream about

Ooh-ooh

Stay until the morning
'Cause, baby, loving you's the real thing
It just feels right
When you give me all of your love, give me something to dream about
(All of your love, give me something to dream about)
So give me all of your love, give me something to dream about

Ooh-ooh

Livin' in a daydream
Livin' in a daydream
Livin' in a daydream
Give me all of your love, give me something to dream about

Livin' in a daydream
Livin' in a daydream (it's alright)
Livin' in a daydream
Give me all of your love
Give me something to dream about (give me all of your love, ooh-ooh)
Give me all of your love
Give me something to dream about (ooh-ooh, it's alright, ooh-ooh)
Give me all of your love
Give me something to dream about (ow)
