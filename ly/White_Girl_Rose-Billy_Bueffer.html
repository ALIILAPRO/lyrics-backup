		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sipping white girl roseeee
In lights girl, no wayyyy
Living life girl, okay
Get the knife, cut the cocaine
Sipping white girl roseeee
In lights girl, no wayyyy
Living life girl, okay
Get the knife, cut the cocaine
Aight first things first
Know the deal
All say that I’m fake
Let me give you something real
Ain’t nothing here to hide behind
There's nothing to reveal
Just a couple hundred hoes
Who gon put me in my feels, uh
I don’t need your love
I just need some pillies
I just need a couples drugs
Got me in my feely’s
Baby I might need a hug
Love me, Do you really?
Baby, I think it’s the drug
Aye, aye
Now we been up all night
We been on the road
I ain’t tryna start a fight
But you where know we go
When we try to get to heights
And I loved you on the low
But you saw a different sight, Ya
And now you got me tripping
All this time I’m sippin
You thought I was kidding
I knew you the one who slipping
Yeah I do this for a living
I stay praying to the reverend
When I die I go to heaven
I’mma die at 27
Sipping white girl roseeee
In lights girl, no wayyyy
Living life girl, okay
Get the knife, cut the cocaine
Sipping white girl roseeee
In lights girl, no wayyyy
Living life girl, okay
Get the knife, cut the cocaine
But I ain’t here to reminicz, no
I don't really ever miss, tho
So you know, I got a pistol
If you fucking with me, then you get, cold
You can never know my zip code
Gated, and I got a brick road
And I’m climbing to the top, I tip toe
Cause I’m racking money by the ship loads
They know that I got it
This shit don’t come easy
You could get this if you want it
And you can call me cheesy
But believe me, if I’m on it
I win it like I’m needy
Just to tell you I’m beyond it
And why you all dramatic?
If only you would listen
Then it probably ain’t that tragic
I been hella driven
The decision is the magic
Tryna make a living
Out of someone who was average
Sipping white girl roseeee
In lights girl, no wayyyy
Living life girl, okay
Get the knife, cut the cocaine
Sipping white girl roseeee
In lights girl, no wayyyy
Living life girl, okay
Get the knife, cut the cocaine
