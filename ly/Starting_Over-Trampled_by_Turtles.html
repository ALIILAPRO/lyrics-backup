		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two
One, two, three

Starting over ain't so bad
Not the home you thought you had
Amputating heart to heart, burn it to the ground
Make the beds up, go to work 
Fall to pieces, have you heard?
Prairie breaking full of nerve 
Let's get out of town

Oh, it's draining a change of pace 
Hasty visions hide your face
Don't let go
Don't let go

Clouds above me, clouds below 
Where'd you come from? Where'd you go?
Wear your boots out on the road, you could break my heart
At the airport up all night
Blurry vision what a sight 
Get me through just one more night then I'll turn it off
Sure as hell I'll get back to you 
Pieced together ran right through
Don't let go
Don't let go 

Don't fool around and fall apart
Silhouette dreams right from the start 

Cards that play now, let me stay now 
I've been gone so far away
I still stay up much too late, here we go again
I found love it was for free
Singing oceans drowning me 
Can you hear it? Can you see?
You could break my heart
My address you know it don't change
Out of time, out of range 
Don't let go
Don't let go
Don't let go
Don't let go
