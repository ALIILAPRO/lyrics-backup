		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here we are
For several years and all these years ago
You are mine
It just blows me away to know this every time

Remember when I'd said I'll change your mind?
I hope it's changing now, I want you to know

These are the days, oh
These are the days, oh
The best ones of my life

What a dream
Sometimes it's so unreal for all it seems
I am yours
I don't ever want to leave your sunshine anymore

I told you someday I'll change your mind
Our life is changing now, I want you to know

That these are the days, oh
These are the days, oh
These are the days, oh
These are the days, oh
The best ones of my life
Yeah

We have so much
A place inside no one can ever touch
Here we are
I want a year with you for every shining star

I hope to god I finally changed your mind
This life is ours now, I want you to know

That these are the days, oh
These are the days, oh
These are the days, oh
These are the days, oh
These are the days, oh
These are the days, oh
