		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you wanna know what is on my mind?
I don't feel like I belong here lately
Wanna leave it all, put it all behind
'Cause I feel like I am going crazy

I don't wanna lie, I don't wanna die
'Cause I'm scared to say goodbye to you, yeah
Spread my wings and fly, right above the sky
I'm just scared to say goodbye to you

So where can I go now? What can I do now?
Where can I find it? Who is gonna show me the way?
The way
So where can I go now? What can I do now?
Where can I find it? Who is gonna show me the way?
The way

So where can I go now? What can I do now?
Where can I find it? Who is gonna show me the way?
The way
So where can I go now? What can I do now?
Where can I find it? Who is gonna show me the way?
The way

I don't wanna lie, I don't wanna die
'Cause I'm scared to say goodbye to you, yeah
Spread my wings and fly, right above the sky
I'm just scared to say goodbye to you

Tryna figure it out, tryna look all around
I won't find it anywhere I'm looking for it
I don't wanna become the one who can't overcome
So come save me, won't you come save me?

So where can I go now? What can I do now?
Where can I find it? Who is gonna show me the way?
The way
So where can I go now? What can I do now?
Where can I find it? Who is gonna show me the way?
The way

Tryna figure it out, tryna look all around
I won't find it anywhere I'm looking for it
I don't wanna become the one who can't overcome
So come save me, won't you come save me?
