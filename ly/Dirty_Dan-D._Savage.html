I'm as slime as it get, you don't wanna meet the stick
I got thirty in my clip, I get turnt up than a bitch
I got tattoos on my hands, I got cocaine on my wrist
I get high like Dirty Dan, I be poured up than a bitch
I spent hundreds on her bag, I spent hundreds on my fit
They know that I gotta fuck them up every chance I get
Trying to play it like a fan, she gon' ask me for a pic
Tell that bitch to suck a dick, only want me for that bag
I'm gon' skirt off in that Jag' with the police on my ass
See them swerving with the lights on and they coming fast
I'm not worried 'bout the past, I'm just focused on that cash
I got junkies nodding off and they keep on coming back

In the streets like I'm on crack, tell the DJ run it back
I done let her see my stash, gave her dick now she attached 
She got hair down to her ass, uh, pussy get no pass
Caught him posted at that red light, let me get my mask
Suck that dick while I'm driving, freaky bitch done made me crash
If I'm sliding with the opps out, I can't get no pass
Niggas tryna steal my flow, but I'm right back they ass
Stole my drip and my ad-libs, can I get my swag
Finna execute this plan, I just made two hundred bands
Niggas tripping smoking fentanyl, had to ex my mans

I'm as slime as it get, you don't wanna meet the stick
I got thirty in my clip, I get turnt up than a bitch
I got tattoos on my hands, I got cocaine on my wrist
I get high like Dirty Dan, I be poured up than a bitch
I spent hundreds on her bag, I spent hundreds on my fit
They know that I gotta fuck them up every chance I get
Trying to play it like a fan, she gon' ask me for a pic
Tell that bitch to suck a dick, only want me for that bag
I'm gon' skirt off in that Jag' with the police on my ass
See them swerving with the lights on and they coming fast
I'm not worried 'bout the past, I'm just focused on that cash
I got junkies nodding off and they keep on coming back
