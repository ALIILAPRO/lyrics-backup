		  Hey Bob I'm looking at what Jack was talking about
And it's definitely not a particle that's nearby
It is a bright object and it's obviously rotating because it's flashing
It's way out in the distance, certainly rotating in a very rhythmic fashion
Because the flashes come around almost on time

As we look back at the earth it's up at about 11 o'clock
About maybe ten or twelve diameters
I don't know whether that does you any good
But there's something out there
