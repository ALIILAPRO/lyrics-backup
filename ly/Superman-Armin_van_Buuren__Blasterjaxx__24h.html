		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell them like it is
It was going down south
It was going really bad
I must have forgotten that I'm Superman

What is going on?
Why you treat me with silence?
What did I do wrong?
Just give me some guidance

It's been a hell of a crazy week
I've lost my head again and again
When all my friends ask me how I feel
I always tell them

Tell them like it is
It was going down south
It was going really bad
But now I'm so happy, yeah, now I'm so glad
It was going down south
It was going really bad
I must have forgotten that I'm Superman

Must have forgotten that I'm Superman
Must have forgotten that I'm Superman
Must have forgotten that I'm Superman
Must have forgotten that I'm Superman

Guess you're not alone
You don't have any problems
Your just moving on
While I'm found at the bottom

It's been a hell of a crazy week
I've lost my head again and again
When all my friends ask me how I feel
I always tell them

Tell them like it is
It was going down south
It was going really bad
But now I'm so happy, yeah, now I'm so glad
It was going down south
It was going really bad
I must have forgotten that I'm Superman

Must have forgotten that I'm Superman
Must have forgotten that I'm Superman
Must have forgotten that I'm Superman
