		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She said it wasn't my fault
She said we gave it our all
As she walked away
I never saw a girl's eyes so blue, no
Tell me is there something I can do
Than leave another message on the telephone
And you're parked outside with the headlights on

Suddenly I'm standing at your door
And the steps don't feel like they did before
The radio's playing loud
But it's not our song
And suddenly he's all alone with you
He's looking in your eyes like I wanted to
I knock four times and pretend you're not at home
And suddenly I'm all alone (x2)

She said it wasn't the same
She said our life's been so plain
Then she walked away
I want to make things brand new
Tell me is there something I can do
Than leave another message on the telephone
And you're parked outside with the headlights on

Suddenly I'm standing at your door
And the steps don't feel like they did before
The radio's playing loud
But it's not our song
And suddenly he's all alone with you
He's looking in your eyes like I wanted to
I knock four times and pretend you're not at home
And suddenly I'm all alone (x3)

Radio's playing
Suddenly I'm all alone
Radio's playing loud but it's not our song

Suddenly I'm standing at your door
And the steps don't feel like they did before
The radio's playing loud
But it's not our song
And suddenly I'm all alone with her
She's everything I wish you were


Suddenly I'm standing at your door
And the steps don't feel like they did before
The radio's playing loud
But it's not our song
And suddenly I'm all alone with her
She's everything I wish you were
I knock four times and pretend you're not at home
