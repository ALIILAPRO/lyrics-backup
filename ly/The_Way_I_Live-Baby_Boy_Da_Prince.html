		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Chorus]
This is the way I live
Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels
I stack my money, lay low, and chill
Don't need to work hard that's the way I feel, I feel, I
This is the way I live
Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels
I stack my money, lay low, and chill
Don't need to work hard that's the way I feel, I feel, I
This is the way I live

Six months later now we're big dog status
Name elevated but I still act average
Rockin' shows in Dallas, ball like I play for the Mavericks
West Bank rapper and I'm one of the baddest
French Rivera spa and I'm getting in shape man
I think I'm Super M-a-n without a cape man
Grindin' all day hustlin', all for the cake man
I'm a Benjamin stack one inch taller than Great Danes
Thrifty made cheap Ray-Bans like a felon
I'm growin' up now spittin' hotter than Mohellans
And I'm still livin' good never gonna flop
I'm a young little dude, stay runnin' from cops
Emerald Row is the place where I got my props
People love me in the hood they don't want me to stop
So uhh, that's the only way I know how to rock
And I'm a stay rappers like won't stop 'til I drop

[Chorus]

I I's Baby Boy and I done it again
I'm ridin' fly with D-Wizzle in the 'cedes Benz
Twenty two on the ride with the ladies in
Red Bull, Grey Goose, now the ladies bent
Now we go and do our thing under a shady tent
And they don't question what I say 'cause I'm a ladies pimp
See this little one right here this fellow got stripes
And I's gon' repesent, Marrero for life
Money in my pocket but I still act trife
While I in the club they say lil' parlor ain't right
Look I'm doing great that's the way I feel
Hustlin' hard all day that's the way I live

[Chorus]

Thug Life how I live everyday
New Benz new charger new Chevrolet
It's the I way live, real gutta man
Always known for doin' gutta thangs all da girls love me man
Fresh Shades big lot, ooh bad chick
Me and shawty Gucci'd down at the classic, Boosie he da baddest
I Got a down ghetto chick but I be damned if a nigga get married
I mingle with da finest, bling ya with my diamonds you can't see I'm shinin'
I got da best music, 'cause I keep it real
So I hit them Big booty gals when I'm in my crib
In out of jail I run the streets for real
Dis how I live kill me and you gon' get killed
In red monkeys I'm a donkey I love stuntin'
Love money love my city, boys call me country country

[Chorus]
