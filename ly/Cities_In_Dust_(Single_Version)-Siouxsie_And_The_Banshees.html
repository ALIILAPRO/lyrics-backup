		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Water was running children were running 
You were running out of time 
Under the mountain, a golden fountain 
Were you praying at the Lares shrine? 
But oh your city lies in dust, my friend 
Oh, oh your city lies in dust, my friend 

We found you hiding we found you lying
Choking on the dirt and sand
Your former glories and all the stories
Dragged and washed with eager hands 

But, oh oh your city lies in dust, my friend
Oh oh your city lies in dust, my friend
Your city lies in dust

Water was running children were running 
We found you hiding we found you lying
Water was running children were running
We found you hiding we found you lying

Your city lies in dust, my friend
Oh oh your city lies in dust, my friend

Hot and burning in your nostrils
Pouring down your gaping mouth
Your molten bodies blanket of cinders
Caught in the throes 

Oh oh your city lies in dust, my friend
Oh your city lies in dust, my friend

Oh oh your city lies in dust, my friend
Oh your city lies in dust, my friend

Your city lies in dust, my friend
Oh your city lies in dust, my friend
