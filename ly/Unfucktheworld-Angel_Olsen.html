		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I quit my dreaming the moment that I found you
I started dancing just to be around you
Here's to thinking that it all meant so much more
I kept my mouth shut and opened up the door

I wanted nothing but for this to be the end
For this to never be a tied and empty hand
If all the trouble in my heart would only mend
I lost my dream, I lost my reason all again

It's not just me for you
I have to look out too
I have to save my life
I need some peace of mind

I am the only one now
I am the only one now
I am the only one now

You may not be around
You may not be around
You may not be around

I am the only one now
I am the only one now
I am the only one now
I am the only one now
