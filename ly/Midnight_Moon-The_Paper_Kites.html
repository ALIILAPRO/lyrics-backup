		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know a place where we can go
Where the night burns long
But the town runs slow
Down at the roadhouse
You can play anyone that you want to play 
You can dance all night
'Til it turns to day
Take me down
To that roadhouse

And all of the girls
Well, they're wearing a smile
And they'll ask you to sit 
Down and talk for a while

To talk about dreams baby 
And wild lovers
And slow dancing
Under a midnight moon

Half a mile off the 209 
There's an old town dive 
Serving whisky and wine 
Down at the roadhouse
And when the night is warm 
And the moon is high
You can drive on down
You can stay all night right here
At the roadhouse

And all of the boys well they
Drink at the bar
And they'll tell you
That where you been
Ain't where you are

All you need is a dream baby
Or a wild lover
Or a slow dancer
Under a midnight moon
