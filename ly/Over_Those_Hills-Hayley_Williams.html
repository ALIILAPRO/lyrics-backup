		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Over those hills
I bet you're somewhere dreaming
I take my pills
Every night and in the morning
When you wake up
Ever wish I was beside you?
We could look out together on those hills forever

Over those hills
I bet you're somewhere dreaming
I take my pills
Every night and in the morning
When you wake up
Ever wish I was beside you? (beside, beside you)
We could look out together on those hills forever

So this is the feeling
You can't imagine that it's real
Till you feel it
Oh
Almost went numb
Thought I'd had enough
But the hurt is half the fun

Da da-da-da da-da-da da-da-da-da
Da da-da-da da-da-da da-da-da
Da da-da-da da-da-da da-da-da-da

We could look out together on those hills forever
