		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No one knows what I am going through
No one knows what it's like
No one feels the way I do right now
And they donâ€™t understand me
They don't even try
You told me that you would take away
All my fears and you tried
No one knows what I mean when I say
That I would rather be dead than alive

(No one is safe)
