		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, oh
Oh oh oh
We roll tonight 
To the guitar bite
Yeah, yeah, oh

Stand up and be counted 
For what you are about to receive
We are the dealers 
We'll give you everything you need
Hail hail to the good times 
'Cause rock has got the right of way
We ain't no legend, ain't no 'cause
We're just livin' for today

For those about to rock, we salute you
For those about to rock, we salute you

We rock at dawn on the front line
Like a bolt right out of the blue
The sky's a-light with the guitar bite
Heads will roll and rock tonight

For those about to rock, we salute you
For those about to rock, we salute you
For those about to rock, we salute you, yes we do
For those about to rock, we salute you

Oh, salute
Oh, oh yeah

We're just a battery for hire with a guitar fire
Ready and aimed at you
Pick up your balls and load up your cannon
For a twenty-one gun salute

For those about to rock, fire
We salute you
For those about to rock, we salute you
For those about to rock 
Fire (we salute you)
Fire, we salute you
We salute you
Come on, whoa
For those about to rock, we salute you
For those about to rock, we salute you
For those about to rock, we salute you 
For those about to rock, we salute you
Shoot, shoot 
Shoot, shoot

For those of you, for those who rock (ain't gonna get tired, won't take a break, we salute you, yeah)
We salute you 
We salute you
We salute you
Fire
