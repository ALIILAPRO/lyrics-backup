		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Doing nothing with you 
Is better than doing 
anything with anybody 

You don’t have to try 
And I can’t deny 
with you I feel like I’m somebody 


You hit my heart oh hit it like a heart attack 
We talkin’ all the time like we insomniacs 
It’s something that I never ever ever had
I’ve never needed nobody but I 


Wanna spend sleepless nights & 
sleepy days with you. (with you, with you) 
You make me speechless when,
you speak the way you do. (You do, you do) 
Cause nobody knows me better 
And nobody else will ever be (ever be) 
Feeling like I feel the way I do
Ooh, about you 


I want to take you away,
London for the day 
Running through streets down in soho 

I could take all your pictures 
Laugh over dinner 
We could go anywhere you wanna go 


You hit my heart oh hit it like a heart attack 
We talkin’ all the time like we insomniacs 
It’s something that I never ever ever had
I’ve never needed nobody but I 


Wanna spend sleepless nights & 
sleepy days with you. (with you, with you) 
You make me speechless when,
you speak the way you do. (You do, you do) 
Cause nobody knows me better 
And nobody else will ever be (ever be) 
Feeling like I feel the way I do
Ooh, about you 


(Nobody knows me better 
Nobody else will ever be 
Feeling like I feel the way I do about you) x2 

sleepless nights & 
sleepy days with you. (with you, with you) 
You make me speechless when,
you speak the way you do. (You do, you do) 
Cause nobody knows me better 
And nobody else will ever be (ever be) 
Feeling like I feel the way I do
Ooh, about you
