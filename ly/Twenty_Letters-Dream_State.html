		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One night, I'm sat in the dark
Sitting in the coldest empty spaces of my heart
This life is like a riddle we're not meant to know
I used to want to run, but now I never want to let it go
I'm not letting go
Yeah I'm done

I soaked my skin
Made some space in my mind
Wrote it all in twenty letters
I learnt to walk alone
And hold my own
And I've been feeling better in a new direction 

No they're never gonna pull me apart, I'm already undone
(Holding hope) I'm done
(Don't let go) I'm done
No they're never gonna break me
No they're never gonna bring me down
(Holding hope) I'm done
Yeah I'm done 

Done, yeah I'm done
No I can't lose hope and I won't let you go
No I can't lose hope and I won't let you go
I'm undone, already won
No I can't lose hope and I won't let you go
No I can't lose hope and I won't let you go 

I was sat on the fence looking for a sign
I feel the world in my hands
As long as you are mine
As long as you are mine
As long as you are mine

I can't lose hope and I won't let you go
No I can't lose hope and I won't let you go
As long as you are mine

No they're never gonna pull me apart
I'm already undone
I'm done, I'm done 
No they're never gonna break me 
No they're never gonna bring me down
I'm done, I'm done 
No they're never gonna pull me apart
I'm already undone 
I'm done 
No they're never gonna break me 
No they're never gonna pull me down 
My god 
My god 

I'm holding onto hope 
And I can't just let it go
