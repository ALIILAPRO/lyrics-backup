		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You set bar too high
Your expectations have become my failure
A shell you see so shallow but deep inside
My heart beats just the same as yours
The same blood through these clean veins

Can't you see that I'm in pain
It seems my life is always under par
What can I say to change your mind about what I am
Others can see what was hidden from your sight
A kid with courage and heart and his eyes open wide
An inner beauty and a bright light
My focus is not yours

I set my sights on new horizons and let my soul have scope
Can't you see that I have my own dreams
And though they're not the same as yours
They hold value to me, tell me why can't you see
I'm not the means to mend your past regrets
What can I say to change your mind about what I am
Others can see what was hidden from your sight
A kid with courage and heart and his eyes open wide

Inner beauty and a bright light
Judged for how I look, not for the good that I have done
I try the best I can, but it seems that I'm not the perfect son
Shaped by God, and my volition
And the seeds that you have sown
But I ask you once again
When does my life become my own?
