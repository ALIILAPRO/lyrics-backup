		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I put my face on backwards, I do my hair just right
I stumble through the bathroom door, I trip and tie my shoes too tight
I'm coming up to breathe, I'm going out for air
It's not that I have a disease, it's really just that I don't care
I'm looking over my shoulder, having it out with the world
Guess we weren't meant for each other, guess she's not my kind of girl
I left my phone at the movies, I left my socks in the drawer
I left my hope in the sheets, I just don't care anymore
Head in the clouds, chat with the birds
Now I have a crowd, but I don't have the words
Face to the breeze, weak at the knees
Dreaming is easy but I can't go back to sleep
I was sober at midnight, I was drinking by noon
There's a tone in my ears, but I still can't find a tune
I broke my back on vodka, I cut my teeth on gin
I need a glass of water, can't believe how long it's been
Head in the clouds, chat with the birds
Now I have a crowd, but I don't have the words
Face to the breeze, weak at the knees
Dreaming is easy but I can't go back to sleep
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh
Today is not to be, no I can't find the words to speak
I bet it hurts to look at me, I bet it hurts to look at me
Last night is when I peaked, like Jesus Christ, I'm obsolete
I bet it hurts to look at me, I bet it hurts to look at me
Today is not to be, no I can't find the words to speak
I bet it hurts to look at me, I bet it hurts to look at me
Last night is when I peaked, like Jesus Christ, I'm obsolete
I bet it hurts to look at me, I bet it hurts to look at me
