		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know what you're thinking
Popped an Addy now I can't stop blinking
Get piped, get ready for the weekend
All the monsters come out on the weekend
I don't know where to call my home
There's a house where I sleep
When I'm all alone
I feel like I've been underrated, yeah
People wanna talk shit, just say it

Yeah, yeah, oh woah oh
Oh, oh, oh i know what you're thinking
Popped an Addy now I can't stop blinking
Get piped, get ready for the weekend
All the monsters comе out on the weekend

Faygo in my double cup
Faygo in my doublе cup coming at me but
I've already had enough, of you
I think that I've had enough
(I think that I've had enough)
Let me run this up
Let me run these fuckers up
I don't want this baby
I don't want to fall in love, with you
I don't want to fall in love
(I don't wanna fall in love)
Faygo in my double cup
Faygo in my double cup coming at me but
I've already had enough, of you
I think that I've had enough
(I think that I've had enough)
Let me run this up
Let me run these fuckers up
I don't want this baby
I don't want to fall in love, with you
I don't want to fall in love
(I don't wanna fall in love) yeah, yeah, oh
Woah oh oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, oh woah oh
Oh, oh, oh i know what you're thinking
Popped an Addy now I can't stop blinking
Get piped, get ready for the weekend
All the monsters come out on the weekend

I don't know where to call my home
There's a house where I sleep
When I'm all alone
I feel like I've been underrated, yeah
People wanna talk shit, just say it

Faygo in my double cup
Faygo in my double cup coming at me but
I've already had enough, of you
I think that I've had enough
(I think that I've had enough)
Let me run this up
Let me run these fuckers up
I don't want this baby
I don't want to fall in love, with you
I don't want to fall in love
(I don't wanna fall in love)
Faygo in my double cup
Faygo in my double cup coming at me but
I've already had enough, of you
I think that I've had enough
(I think that I've had enough)
Let me run this up
Let me run these fuckers up
I don't want this baby
I don't want to fall in love, with you
I don't want to fall in love
(I don't wanna fall in love)

I know what you're thinking
Popped an Addy now I can't stop blinking
Get piped, get ready for the weekend
All the monsters come out on the weekend
I don't know where to call my home
There's a house where I sleep
When I'm all alone
I feel like I've been underrated, yeah
People wanna talk shit, just say it
