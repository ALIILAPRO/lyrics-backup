		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ladies and gentlemen
Sweeties, puppies and naughties
Welcome, welcome, welcome
Welcome to

Excuse me (yeah)
Pardon me (whoa, girl)
Give me that lobotomy
I'm real up, you real broke (cha-ching)
Example of dichotomy
Swipe, swipe, swipe
Swiper, I'm swiping
Still icing, blow me like Dyson
Pipe, pipe, pipe
Piper, I'm piping
Come quick, McQueen like Lightning

Ooh, huh
We just made a classic
Pop that shit, baby, come and get graphic
Fly to Jamaica, pop a little acid
Now I'm on a jet ski, I can come flaccid (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Take my emotions back to the tissue
I don't really miss you, never have, never will
Touchdown Zurich, mountain top, eat fondue
Shower with your girl, rub down, that's Mountain Dew
Feel like I'm flowing on the beat, only two drinks deep
Call me crazy, yeah, I'm tryna make a girl queef
Bitch, I ain't no virgin, your career hurtin' (no, yeah)
Three mules in Moscow, baby, no swerving

Ooh, yeah
It's Gravy time, uh

I got the WAP
When I step on the block
Everybody fly, Gravy o'clock
She said that I'm hot
Bitch, I ain't hot, lil' bitch, I'm scorchin'
Got it all, baby, you can have a portion
Get head, you the headless horseman
She got taken in the tank in a Porsche
Fuck cookies, man, I just want the fortune
Yeah, you know I'm always on some free shit
I be out in Vail eatin' coochie on a ski-lift
Cleopatra on my dick, never been to Egypt
Slob my knob while I'm listening to Three 6

Excuse me (yeah)
Pardon me (whoa, girl)
Give me that lobotomy
I'm real up, you real broke (cha-ching)
Example of dichotomy
Swipe, swipe, swipe
Swiper, I'm swiping
Still icing, blow me like Dyson
Pipe, pipe, pipe
Piper, I'm piping
Come quick, McQueen like Lightning

I'm a pleasant surprise, eyes on the prize
Bust a lil' move, gon' hypnotize
Bag with a big bae, baby gotta rationalize
Always capitalize
So I swear to God, bro, do not patronize me
Yeah, I'm out here doing big boy shit
If you wanna check the crib, five hundred on the town, payment
With my face on the pavement
Say it with some laymans
I'm real up, boy, you just a lame man
Don't make me make a statement
Realtor call me, we thinking 'bout the Caymans
Yeah, of course bbno$ too good bill hunting
Bitch, I'm Matt Damon

Excuse me (yeah)
Pardon me (whoa, girl)
Give me that lobotomy
I'm real up, you real broke (cha-ching)
Example of dichotomy
Swipe, swipe, swipe
Swiper, I'm swiping
Still icing, blow me like Dyson
Pipe, pipe, pipe
Piper, I'm piping
Come quick, McQueen like Lightning
