		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dreams
Babe
Are made of emotion

Shadows and dark deep devotion
Stay here
My heart is on fire
Oh
I'm born again

My heart is in your hands
My heart is burning

Turning
Over and over
My friend

Are you man enough
But baby
Are you really tough
To take my heart away
My love?
Don't look back
Here I am
Just for you
Are you man enough
Oh baby
Are you really tough?
If you light the flame of love

On the wings of my love we will fly
Love me like there's no tomorrow
Give up the fears and the sorrows
Passion of love stays forever

Didn't I tell you that I need you so?
My heart is burning
Turning
Over and over again

Are you man enough
But baby
Are you really tough

Keep the fire burning in your soul
Oh
My heart is losing its control

What I got is what you need tonight
Are you man enough
But baby
Are you really tough
To take my heart away
My love?
Don't look back
Here I am
Just for you
Are you man enough?
