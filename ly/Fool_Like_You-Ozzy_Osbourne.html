		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hear you breathing though
You're so far away
Can you just go where you're
Going to
I couldn't give a damn or two
About a fool like you
That's true
Are you just too cool no
You're just perfectly cold
And what goes around still
Comes around
I think it's all summed up and
Down in a fool like you
That's true
Today is just another day
You hold your ticket into
Nowhere
It's up to you if you will stay
And turn your day into a
Nightmare

You think you know it you think
You know it all
But you don't even have a clue
And control is still in view for
A fool like you
That's true
Is there a reason for the way
That you are
Or does it just come naturally
To have an idiosyncrasy and be
A fool like you
That's true

You're hearing what you want
To hear
Misunderstanding all you see
An attitude in all of us
Is it really you and me

He's hiding residing deep within
The crowd
A hand out he'll pull you down

You've been found guilty
Committed every crime
But still they say you must go
Free
Looks like haunted i will be by a fool like you
Fool like you
That's true

By a fool like you by a fool like
You
Looks like haunted i will be by a
Fool like you
That's true
By a fool like you by a fool like
You
Looks like you by a fool like
You
Looks like haunted i will be by a
Fool like you
That's true
