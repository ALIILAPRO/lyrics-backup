		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Half the country fell asleep, but they scream, "Woke"
We're distracted by vaccines and TV shows
Politics, celebrity, gossip, popular neat quotes
Black lives, white lives, which lives mean most?
We only dedicate one day to remember our fallen soldiers
The men and women who died young
But if you come out the closet as Caitlyn Jenner
You're a hero and you get a whole pride month
The most dangerous pandemic's propaganda from these clowns
Only mask that's gonna save us is duct tape on they mouths
Don't speak, we don't need to defund police
Need to defund the media who lies through they teeth, like
Big pharma doesn't cure you, dog
'Cause every patient that gets cured is a customer lost
And big oil runs the world, the only wars that get fought
Are with the countries who have natural resources they want
Heard 'em claimin' if a white man braids his hair
And likes rap, he's appropriatin' culture
But if a white man acts too white, he's white trash
He's a racist, he's a bigot, he's a monster

Let's just have the conversation
Not every Liberal is dumb, not all Republicans are racist
The government wants everybody fighting with their neighbors
'Cause they know that if we get along, we'll probably go against 'em

They can't stop us
'Cause we're ready to fight
Try to brainwash us
But we won't let freedom die
The whole world's brainwashed
Everybody pick a team, start a riot in the streets
The whole world's brainwashed
It's us against them, it ain't you against me

How did monkeys become people and people turned into sheep?
They put fluoride in the water that's keeping us all asleep
Claim they want what's best for us, I find that hard to believe
'Cause they been selling us cigarettes since we was 18
Fake news, fake woke, distract, and divide
You're either right or you're left or you're black or you're white
Big tech don't need a microchip to hack in your life
'Cause the phone inside your pocket is a trackin' device
And I don't know what I'm more sick of
Rappers or Joe Biden lookin' like he ate a hundred Xanax for dinner
'Cause censorin' the president and kicking him off Twitter
Is a bigger threat to freedom than foreign ballistic missiles
You don't trust the police or the government
But you want people givin' up their right to own a firearm
Why would you be comfortable if police and the government
The only people on the planet with the right to buy a gun?
White privilege gettin' amplified to reinforce the vision
It convinces white people that they're favored by their skin
And black people gettin' angry 'cause they're told they're treated different
So the conflict is between us and never with the system

Let's just have the conversation
Not every Liberal is dumb, not all Republicans are racist
The government wants everybody fighting with their neighbors
'Cause they know that if we get along, we'll probably go against 'em

They can't stop us
'Cause we're ready to fight
Try to brainwash us
But we won't let freedom die
The whole world's brainwashed
Everybody pick a team, start a riot in the streets
The whole world's brainwashed
It's us against them, it ain't you against me

Step one, train the people only to consume
Step two, infiltrate adults with the news
Step three, indoctrinate the children through the schools
And the music and the apps on the phones that they use
Step four, separate the right from the left
Step five, separate the white from the black
Step six, separate the rich from the poor
Use religion and equality to separate 'em more
Step seven, fabricate a problem made of lies
Step eight, put it on the news every night
Step nine, when people start to fight and divide
Take control, this is called situational design

They can't stop us
'Cause we're ready to fight
Try to brainwash us
But we won't let freedom die
The whole world's brainwashed
Everybody pick a team, start a riot in the streets
The whole world's brainwashed
It's us against them, it ain't you against me
