		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Small town witch come to mess me up yeah)

See black, see bloom
Died on an impulse over you
Caught like a corpse 
Crawling round a dream and loving you
And she hangs on youth
Crushing any feet to fit the shoes
Stepping it out with a size 12 mouth 
And cursing you

Small town witch come to mess me up
Small town witch come to mess me up
Small town witch come to mess me up again

She whored and she graced
Bitching with the bottle, saving face
Blowing it out as the jury's doubt is laid to waste
See black, see bloom 
Choked up on a heartburn, bleeding through
How does it feel when the ones that feed are biting you

Small town witch come to mess me up
Small town witch come to mess me up
Small town witch come to mess me up again
