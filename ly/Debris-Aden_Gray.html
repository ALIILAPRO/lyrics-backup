		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  See I thought I would do good on my own
but now every time that I'm alone
I just keep on checking on my phone
I guess sometimes it's better not to know
It's been two weeks since I've seen your face
And everything has stayed the same
You get to go back to your old ways
At least you understand...
You've got to save yourself from me
Your love is all I need
Why don't you save yourself from me
Your love is all I need
Cause I've been going back and forth
Deep inside my mind
I wish I could understand
The way I feel sometimes
Cause I'm a hundred miles away
From any sight of land
Maybe I'll get there someday
Maybe I'll understand
You've got to save yourself from me
Your love is all I need
Why don't you save yourself from me
Cause my heart will combust and fuck it all up and I'll turn us to dust so I can live my life in the debris
