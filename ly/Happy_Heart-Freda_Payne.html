		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a certain sound, always follows me around 
When you're close to me, you will hear it 
It's the sound that lovers finally will discover 
When there is no other for their lover 

[Chorus] 
It's my happy heart you hear, singing loud & singing clear 
& it's all because you're near me, my love 
Take my happy heart away; make me love you, make my day 
In your arms I want to stay, oh my love 

Feeling more & more, like I've never felt before 
You have changed my life so completely 
Music fills my soul now; I've lost all control now 
I'm not half, I'm whole now, with your love 

[Chorus] 

It's my happy heart 
Can't you hear my happy heart 
Oh oh please take my happy heart 
Please take my happy heart
