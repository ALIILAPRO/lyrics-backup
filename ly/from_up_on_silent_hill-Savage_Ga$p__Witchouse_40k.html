		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got
Blood stains on my Prada kicks, boy
Bitch boy
Ima smack you in your fuckin shit, boy
You can call me what you want
You know I'm really him, boy
And you're  fire when I mute it
Call that silent hill boy
Like I'm chainsaw man
I'm bout to let it R.I.P boy
See a whole lotta red
I'll stomp you in my ricks boy
If you're  subbing to her twitch, she probably let me hit boy
I got shawty in the room
Call that silent hill four

Bitch i'm in my body bag
Put me on that shit then ima body that
I Hit the psyche ward
Look around like where my shawty at?
The Perc taste like Halloween candy
Yum, I'll eat that
Gaspare what the hell you doin?
Bitch don't call me that
Slythrin my pockets
Cause the green is what I get in them
Ricky on my jeans and ur bitch wanna get in them
The all black fit
Boy I pop out like the enderman
The devil wears Prada
Naw acne what I'm Drippin in

Nose bleed 'em, blood up on his body, make 'em backtrack
Demons on em, trick 'em out his treats, he'll get his bag snatched
Carve his pumpkin, like a jack he with the ghosts
I'm picking Locks with Oogie Boogie, Shock and Barrel through his home
Crawl out the tomb with 'em
He got a body with bugs in it
Turn 'em to ash every time that I'm rolling up
Bag em, I cook 'em up, lacing your plug with it
Hungry for blood, see his blood I ain't full enough
Dig it up, I want his jewelry, leaving his body alone in the woods (woods)
Walk out the cut with the crooks, he runnin' his mouth on me, now he on foot

I got
Blood stains on my Prada kicks, boy
Bitch boy
Ima smack you in your fuckin shit, boy
You can call me what you want
You know I'm really him, boy
And you're fire when I mute it
Call that silent hill boy
Like I'm chainsaw man
I'm bout to let it R.I.P boy
See a whole lotta red
I'll stomp you in my ricks boy
If you're  subbing to her twitch, she probably let me hit boy
I got shawty in the room
Call that silent hill four
