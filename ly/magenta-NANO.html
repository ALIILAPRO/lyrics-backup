		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember again

Inside a world of broken words
you cannot hide
you try to find the reasons why,
as days collide
the seconds keep on passing,
without a sound, you turn around
and as you walk away
I call to you
Don't you let go
take a look around,
you are not alone
if you'd only stop
and close your eyes
find the answers,
you'd find the answers
when you feel like the world
if falling in
and you can't seem to find
the way back in
don't cry
just hear these words
and remember again

Outside, you're trembling
as you stand,
in the falling rain
you try to find
where you belong,
as you drown the pain
You hear the voices crying
inside a world monochrome
but their eyes are bleeding
tears of magenta
Don't you let go
take another breath
when you're lost again
if you'd only break
the walls within
find the courage,
you'd find the courage
when you feel like the world
if falling in
and you can't seem to find
the way back in
don't cry
just hear these words
and remember again
Another silent prayer fades
as the night slips past
I try to reach out to the light
through the glass as it shatters

Don't you let go
take a look around,
you are not alone
if you'd only stop
and close your eyes
find the answers,
you'd find the answers
when you feel like the world
if falling in
and you can't seem to find
the way back in
don't cry
just hear these words
and remember
Don't you let go
take another breath
when you're lost again
if you'd only break
the walls within
find the courage,
you'd find the courage
when you feel like the world
if falling in
and you can't seem to find
the way back in
don't cry
just hear these words
and remember again
you'd find the answers
find the answers
