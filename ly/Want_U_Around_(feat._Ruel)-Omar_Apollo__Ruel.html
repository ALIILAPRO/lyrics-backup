		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, I want you around
And baby, I want you around

I'm done with you
And baby, I promise I'll be what you wanted
But now and here
Heart took some damage I wish I could vanish from you
You
You
You

And baby, I want you around (baby, baby)
(I want you 'round) baby, I want you around

I'm missing you
Took me for granted, ain't that what you wanted?
I disappeared
Told me you promise, I can't even stand it
You
I miss you, baby
You
Love
You
Miss you, miss you, miss you

And baby, I want you around (baby, baby)
(I want you around)
(I want you 'round) and baby, I want you around

Baby, I need you to notice me
See your name on my phone 'fore I go to sleep
Are you tryin' to push me away?
What else are you tryna gain?
Oh, oh, whoa

Say what you want about me, oh
Say what you want about me, yeah
Ah

Baby, I want you around (I want you around)
And baby, I want you around (want you around)
(Want you around)
(Want you around)
(Oh) (ooh)
(Yeah, yeah)
