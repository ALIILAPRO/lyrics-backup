		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How do you sleep at night?

We, we buried the hatchet right
Into my back and look what you've done
The last one that's laughing
The last one that's standing is
The one with the gun
And I thought you were different
But you kept a knife hidden
In your silver tongue
You buried the hatchet right into
My back and now

I'm slowly building up my throne
From all the sticks and stone you have thrown
But all your words still haunt
Me like a ghost yeah, mm

How do you sleep at night, night, night
You made your bed, now lie, lie, lie
'Cause you cut me in cursive
I wear еvery word baby
Look what you've done, oh
How do you sleep at night, night, night

Wе're like a fox and a rabbit
You're acting like Alice
You're chasing me down
With your proverbial damage
I'm broken and branded and now

I'm slowly building up my throne
From all the sticks and stone you've thrown
But all your words still haunt
Me like a ghost yeah, yeah

How do you sleep at night, night, night
You made your bed, now lie, lie, lie
'Cause you cut me in cursive
I wear every word baby
Look what you've done, oh
How do you sleep at night, night, night

When you were never fed love
On a silver spoon
You learn to lick it off knives, you do
You do when you were never fed love
On a silver spoon
You learn to lick it off knives, you do
You do

How do you sleep at night, night, night
You made your bed, now lie, lie, lie
'Cause you cut me in cursive
I wear every word baby
Look what you've done, oh
How do you sleep at night, night, night
(How do you sleep at night)
