		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not really into niggas telling me what to do, tsunami, like, y'all finna like this song
Hold on, I talk back
Hold on, I talk back

What you thought?
Abide by a nigga?
I can't do that
Obey who?

Abide by a nigga?
I can't do that
Hold on, I talk back

The fuck
Hold on, I talk back
Yep
Hold on
I

Back up
I can't do that
Abide by a nigga?
I can't do that

I can't do that
Sit up laying in the house?
I can't do that
I can't do that

Hanging up the whole summer
I can't do that
You hanging up the whole summer?
That shit whack

A five-star dinner
I could do that
Let's go!
From the projects to mansions, I been that

Been her
Ooh, he thirsty, he begging, I like that
Come here
Eat me straight off the bone, we could do that

Nasty nigga
Hold on, I need that
I could do that
Hold on, my ass fat

Fat, fat, fat
I speak facts
I need that
So you need that?

So you need that
Hold on, I need that
I could do that
Hold on, my ass fat

Fat, fat, fat
I speak facts
I need that
So you need that?

Smoking white cloud hookah, with my ass out
Aye
Hell nah, we ain't chilling in yo trap house
Boo

Tell my other nigga, come and pick me up
Pick me up
Point me to the sluts, I know you eating ass so
What's up, nigga

Throw it back, put it in rotation
Get up make it clap like a standing ovation
Throw it back, put it in rotation

Get up make it clap like a standing ovation
Hold on, I talk back

Hold on, I talk back
What you thought, abide by a nigga
I can't do that
Obey who ?

Abide by a nigga?
I can't do that
Hold on, I talk back
The fuck

Hold on, I talk back
Yep
O$o Blanco on the beat bitch
Throw it back, put it in rotation

Rotation
Play that shit back Phaded
throw it back, put it in rotation
Rotation

I know you like it baby
throw it back, put it in rotation
Rotation
I know you like it, make it clap like a standing ovation
