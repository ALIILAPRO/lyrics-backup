		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel fantastic, bombastic,
Ecstatically astounded
How a girl can really lose her brain
I feel surrounded, confounded
Emotionally dumbfounded
To think you've nearly won your game
Oh yeah, you said that I have
Been gone too long
Don't try to tell me
That I was wrong (re-e-mix)
Totally, wrong for me
Got the hurt in my face
Now I know the only thing to do
Is to give myself some space
I bet she never told you everything that drifted through her mind
All the secret thoughts
Well I bet you never caught her sliding with another man
Because I did
No no, I hate to see the way the finger points at me
I'm at fault, I don't think so
After all is said and done girl
You know you've had your fun
Why don't you leave it there
I feel fantastic, bombastic,
Ecstatically astounded
How a girl can really lose her brain
I feel surrounded, confounded
Emotionally dumbfounded
To think you'd nearly won your game
I feel fantastic, bombastic,
Ecstatically astounded
How a girl can really lose her brain
I feel surrounded, confounded
Emotionally dumbfounded
To think you've nearly won your game
Oh yeah
You say you had a girl, with problems
Tell me, did it lead to heartache and confusion? (re-e-mix)
Did you wake up in tears
Not knowing where you are?
Did you, get it in the ear, like I did?
Like I did
I bet she never told you everything that drifted through her mind
All the secret thoughts
Well I bet you never caught her sliding with another man
Because I did
No no, I hate to see the way the finger points at me
I'm at fault, I don't think so
After all is said and done girl
You know you've had your fun
Why don't you leave it there
I feel fantastic, bombastic,
Ecstatically astounded
How a girl can really lose her brain
I feel surrounded, confounded
Emotionally dumbfounded
To think you'd nearly won your game
I feel fantastic, bombastic,
Ecstatically astounded
How a girl can really lose her brain
I feel surrounded, confounded
Emotionally dumbfounded
To think you've nearly won your game
