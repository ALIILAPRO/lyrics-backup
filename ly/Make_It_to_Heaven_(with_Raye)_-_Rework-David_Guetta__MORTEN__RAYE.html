		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I take one more shot
If you take one more shot
Ooh, baby
We might just make it to heaven
If you stay up all night
If I stay up all night
Ooh, baby
We might just make it to heaven

To heaven
To heaven

In the dark, in the dead of the night
I will cry, I will cry
I will cry like the doves cry
'Til you gave me your drug
Somehow sobers me up
Hold me up, hold me up
Now I'm upside down
I think I love it
Taste of his kiss
Always I drink you
If we're under covers
Let me be the thing that you drink to

If I take one more shot
If you take one more shot
Ooh, baby
We might just make it to heaven
If you stay up all night
If I stay up all night
Ooh, baby
We might just make it to heaven

To heaven
To heaven

Now I'm upside down
I think I love it
Taste of his kiss
Always I drink you
If we're under covers
Let me be the thing that you drink to

If I take one more shot
If you take one more shot
Ooh, baby
We might just make it to heaven
