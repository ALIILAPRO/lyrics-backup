		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is not a movie
And things just ain't the same as your favorite video
Try standing back and move me
And next to you's a very nice place to go

Talk, talk to Suzie!
I went through a million choices
Talk, set it up for Suzie!
I listened to a million voices

And they said, "Don't let me down"
They said, "Don't let me down again"
No, no

Countdown, countdown
Countdown to the disappointment
I'm yours tonight

Countdown, countdown
Countdown to the disappointment
I'm yours tonight
Oh, no no no

Read not what the stars say
There's an evil lurking round every door
It's not enough to make you leave me
I never wanted you to go

Talk talk to Suzie!
I went through a million choices
Talk, set it up for Suzie!
I listened to a million voices

And they said, "Don't let me down"
They said, "Don't let me down"
They said, "Don't let me down again"
No, no

Countdown, countdown
Countdown to the disappointment
I'm yours tonight

Countdown, countdown
Countdown to the disappointment
I'm yours tonight

Oh, time has nearly gone
So take another breath
And taste this one more time again
One more time again

Countdown, countdown
Countdown to the disappointment
I'm yours tonight

Countdown, countdown
Countdown to the disappointment
I'm yours tonight
Oh no no no oh
