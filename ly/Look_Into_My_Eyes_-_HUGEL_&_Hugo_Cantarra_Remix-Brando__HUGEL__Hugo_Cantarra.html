		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look into my eyes
Can you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you?
Don't you know it's true?
That it's no one else but you
Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you baby?

It's hard for me to demonstrate
That I might work, wanna stay up late
Club girls call, want a serenade
So I hop, hop on just to feel the need
Lie, there ain't no lie
I'm just a man and I'll always want you

It's hard for me to love you like I do
When I'm always on the road
Baby, you should know
It's hard for me to love you just to prove
I ain't jealous when you go
Yeah, oh, oh, oh

Look into my eyes
Can you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you baby?
Don't you know it's true?
That it's no one else but you
Would I lie to you baby?
Would I lie to you baby?

Back of the car, you start to jump on me
Like heaven, you are, just finally know me
And I, I fell in love again
And I, ain't looking for a friend

It's hard for me to love you like I do
When I'm always on the road
Baby, you should know
It's hard for me to love you just to prove
I ain't jealous when you go
Yeah, oh, oh, oh

Look into my eyes
Can you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you baby?
Don't you know it's true?
That it's no one else but you
Would I lie to you baby?
Would I lie to you baby?
Look into my eyes
Can you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you baby?
Don't you know it's true?
That it's no one else but you
Would I lie to you baby?
Would I lie to you baby?
Look into my eyes
Can you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you baby?
Don't you know it's true?
That it's no one else but you
Would I lie to you baby?
Would I lie to you baby?
