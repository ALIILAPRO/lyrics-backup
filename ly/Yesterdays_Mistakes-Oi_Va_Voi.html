		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't need another resolution to feel
As though I'm going somewhere
Somewhere

You said you needed me
Or at least that's what I thought
At times the memories seem to be
Knocking at my door

I've seen the film a million times
Feels like I wrote the storyline
I refuse to replay the mistakes
That we made yesterday

I like to think I'm stronger now
Victim of common sense
The truth is that I know
I still confuse the past
With the present tense

Condensing what we had
To a single frame that sticks in my mind
As I try to move on
The same image comes back every time

They were yesterday's mistakes
And they were yesterday's mistakes
Yesterday's mistakes somewhere

Forgive my selfishness
I'd be grateful if you can
Forget my ingratitude
You think I'm twice the girl I am

They say we should forgive but not forget
What has gone before
I refuse to replay
The mistakes that we made yesterday

And they were yesterday's mistakes
Yesterday's mistakes
They were yesterday's mistakes

I refuse to replay
The mistakes that we made yesterday
I refuse to replay
The mistakes that we made yesterday

I refuse to replay
The mistakes that we made yesterday
I refuse to replay
The mistakes that we made yesterday

I refuse to replay
The mistakes that we made yesterday
I refuse to replay
The mistakes that we made yesterday
