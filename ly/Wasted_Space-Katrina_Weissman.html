		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know it's cold but I will loop around the block
Mannequin in a window broken mirror on the sidewalk
And do you know I see your face carved in every block of ice
Slip off the curb into your mouth, rub my legs from your eyes
I don't even want your love, just a body is enough
Just want something to get by
Let me hold you down
This one last time
I'll let you leave me
I'll let you lie
I got wasted space
To lay beside me every night
And I don't wanna be alone
So sick of being alone
My hands are stained by citrus, they could rub the marble raw
And we felt so right in summer, us against the hum
Do you know I say your name
Two in the morning stuck in bed
You're the dent in the mattress
You're the existential dread
And I don't even want your love, just a body is enough
Just want something to get by
Let me hold you down
This one last time
I'll let you leave me
I'll let you lie
I got wasted space
To lay beside me every night
And I don't wanna be alone
And you got the best part of knowing me
I'm a Russian doll of who I used to be
I'm hollowed out and you're better off without my need
And I'm pissed off and sorry to ask you to comfort me
Let me hold you down
This one last time
I'll let you leave me
I'll let you lie
I got wasted space
To lay beside me every night
Oh and I, I don't wanna be alone
No, I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone
