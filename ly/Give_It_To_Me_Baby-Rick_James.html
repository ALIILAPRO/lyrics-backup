		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I came home last night
You wouldn't make love to me
You went fast to sleep
You wouldn't even talk to me
You said I'm so crazy
Coming home intoxicated
I said I just wanna love you
I just wanna love you baby
That is why I'm so elated

C'mon girl, give it to me baby
Give it to me baby
Give it to me baby (give it to me baby), I betcha
I'll make you hot till you've had enough
Give it to me baby (give it to me baby)
Just give it to me baby
Give it to me baby (give it to me baby), I betcha
I'll make you hot till you've had enough

Give it to me
Give me that stuff that funk that sweet that funky stuff (say what)
(Give it to me)
Give me that stuff that funk that sweet that funky stuff (say what)
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Give me that stuff
That sweet, funky stuff
Yoh ho, aw

(Give to me, baby)

When I was high as the sky
Out all night just dancing
You say let's go home (c'mon Rick, I'm tired, let's go home)
That's the time I start romancin'
You say "how can I love you?" (how can I love you, baby?)
"When your body keeps on moving"
I say "wait til I squeeze you" (oh)
Maybe then you'll start to groovin' (c'mon girl)

Give it to me baby (give it to me baby)
Give it to me baby (give it to me baby), I betcha
I'll make you hot like you had enough
Give it to me baby (give it to me baby)
Just give it to me baby
Give it to me baby (give it to me baby), I betcha
I'll make you hot like you had enough

Give it to me
Give me that stuff that funk that sweet that funky stuff (say what)
(Give it to me)
Give me that stuff that funk that sweet that funky stuff (say what)
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Give me that stuff
That sweet, funky stuff
Yoh ho, aw

(Hey Girl)
Give it to me what you say
Give it to me what you say
(Give it to me) what you say
(Give it to me) what you say
(Hey girl)
Give it to me what you say
Give it to me what you say
Give it to me
Give it to me (hey girl)
Give it to me what you say
Give it to me what you say
Give it to me
Give it to me (hey, girl)
Give it to me what you say
Give it to me right away
Give it to me
Give it to me (hey, girl)
Give it to me what you say
Give it to me what you say
Give it to me
