		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My soul is fading
We got it all wrong
This world managed to teach us how to sing our song
And my soul is fading
But I know what pure graces it could be
But I know what pure graces it could be

Violence with more violence with more violence
Your soul is fading

My soul is fading
We got it all wrong
This world managed to teach us how to sing our song
And my soul is fading
But I know what pure graces it could be
We got it all wrong

But I know what pure graces it could be

My soul is fading
No more sorrow, no more pain, we could build a brighter tomorrow
My soul is fading
We got it all wrong
We traded ours souls for pleasure that don't belong

Violence with more violence with more violence
Your soul is fading

My soul is fading
We got it all wrong
This world managed to teach us how to sing our song
And my soul is fading
But I know what pure graces it could be
But I know what pure graces it could be

My soul is fading
We got it all wrong
This world managed to teach us how to sing our song
And my soul is fading
But I know what pure graces it could be
But I know what pure graces it could be

My soul is fading, but I know it's not too late
But I know what pure graces it could be

My soul is fading
No more sorrow, no more pain, 
We could build a brighter tomorrow
My soul is fading
We got it all wrong
We traded ours souls for pleasure that don't belong
