		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, baby (baby)
Ooh, baby
Oh yeah

I need a lover to give me
The kind of love that'll last always
I need somebody uplifting
To take me away, babe, oh yeah, yeah

I want a lover who knows me, yeah
Who understands how I feel inside (ooh, baby)
Someone to comfort and hold me
Through the long lonely nights
'Til the dawn
Why don't you take me away

Dream lover come rescue me
Take me up, take me down
Take me anywhere you want to, baby now
I need you so desperately
Won't you please come around
'Cause I wanna share forever with you, baby

(Ooh)
With you, baby

I don't want another pretender, no
To disillusion me one more time
Whispering words of forever
Playing with my mind, no no
No-no-no, no no, baby

I need someone to hold on to (ooh, baby)
The kind of love that won't fly away 
I just want someone to belong to everyday of my life
Always
So come and take me away

Dream lover come rescue me (yeah)
Take me up, take me down (oh, baby)
Take me anywhere you want to, baby now
I need you so desperately (I need you so desperately)
Won't you please come around
'Cause I wanna share forever with you, baby (sugar)
(With you)

Oh yeah

Baby, come and take me away

Dream lover come rescue me (yeah)
Take me up, take me down
Take me anywhere you want to, baby now
I need you so desperately (I need you, baby)
Won't you please come around (won't you please?)
'Cause I wanna share forever with you, baby (please)

I need you so, I need you so (dream lover come rescue me)
(Take me up, take me down) take me up
(Take me anywhere you want to, baby now)
(I need you so desperately)
Come on, baby (won't you please come around)
('Cause I wanna share forever with you, baby)
