		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When ever I chance to meet, old friends on the street
They wonder how does a man get to be this way
Always got a smiling face, anytime and any place
And every time they ask me why I just smile and say

'Cause you've got to kiss an angel good morning
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good morning
And love her like the devil when you get back home

Though people may try to guess, the secret of our happiness
But some of them never learn it's a simple thing
The secret I'ma speaking of, is a woman and a man in love
And the answer is in this song that I always sing

'Cause you've got to kiss an angel good morning
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good morning
And love her like the devil when you get back home

Kiss an angel good morning
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good morning
And love her like the devil when you get back home
