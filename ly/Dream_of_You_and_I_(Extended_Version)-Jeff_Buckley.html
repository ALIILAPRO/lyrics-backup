		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is, uh
Based on some music that I heard in a dream
That I saw in a dream
Called, it's going to be called "you and I", ouch!
'Cause it's what the people in the dream were saying

You and I, you and I, you and I
All for you

It's like that, I heard the people singing that in a dream
Yeah, and it was a dream where I was in an auditorium at a college
And everybody was congregated and singing the same words
And there was this, y'know a bunch of
This band on stage and they were like, y'know, sorta spacey Deadhead band
With teen- y'know, like, guys in their twenties, like a bunch of grunge guys but
Kinda playing this, this, other thing, not like what I'm playing here on guitar
And the people kept on beating out, uh
Rhythms on drumsticks
This really great rhythm, it was in like, 7/4, this really cool space jam
And what it was, it was a song
I dreamed that this song was about, uh, about this guy, uh
Or, y'know, the person in the song is singing to his lover
Supposedly
That uh, y'know, he's completely theirs
The lover has forbidden anybody to have contact with him
The lover has taken away his freedom, taken away his days and nights
Taken away his, y'know, his dreams
Uh, sent away his friends
Forbidden him to, y'know, get close to his parents, all that stuff
And what it was, it was an AIDS rally
And that song was about AIDS
Or about something like that
So every time the refrain came around
The people would say "you and I, you and I, you and I"
And they point to the sign that said, y'know, like
It said AIDS with a circle with a slash through it
And they go "all for you"
They go like, point to the sign, so that was the dream
I woke up with it
'Kay?
Anyway, as long as you got that on tape, I'll remember that
