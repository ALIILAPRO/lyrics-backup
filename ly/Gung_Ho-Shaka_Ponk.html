		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Soldier, it doesn't matter
What they say, what they do
Stronger, you better be stronger
Do what I say, not what I do

Gung Ho
Gung Ho

Dj drop the beat and don't stop!
Dj drop the beat and don't stop!
Dj drop the beat and don't stop!

Hey you, dirty skin, time to get back on the ring!
I don't wanna miss a thing, I don't wanna feel a thing!
Dig your father fuckin' grave, slay that motherfucker slave!
Oh, I'm not gonna look away!
Gung Ho!

Dj drop the beat and don't stop!
Dj drop the beat and don't stop!

Freedom glides onto your blade
You've lost a light and fooled your head
I've got a lotta magma running into my veins
I've got a lotta calaveras painted over my skin (Give it away)

I can't give it away! (Hey you! Break that prick, everybody needs some bloody shit!)
I can't give it away! (Hey you! Break that prick, c'mon!)

I slipped down today
But I really can't give it away
I slipped down today
But I really can't give it away

Dj drop the beat and don't stop!
Dj drop the beat and don't stop!

Hey you little cramé, when I look into your eyes, I see nada eyes at all!
Dj drop the beat and don't stop!
Hey you little cramé, when I listen to your voice, I hear nada thing at all!
Dj drop the beat and don't stop!
It makes me think that I might have been wilder than I wanted with your teeny-body-bonzo!
Dj drop the beat and don't stop!
It makes me wonder mucho did it I really wanna go loco, violent, funky?
Hey hey!
Did I really need to go?

Gung Ho (can't give it way)
Gung Ho oh (can't give it way)
Gung Ho (can't give it way)
Gung Ho oh (can't give it way)
Gung Ho (can't give it way)
Gung Ho oh (I can't give it way)
Gung Ho (I can't give it way)
Gung Ho (I can't give it way)
Gung Ho (I can't give it way)

Love is dead (dead!) 
Love is dead (dead!) 
Love is dead (dead!) 
Love is dead

I can't give it away! (Hey you! Break that prick, everybody needs some bloody shit!)
I can't give it away! (Hey you! Break that prick, c'mon!)

I slipped down today
But I really can't give it away
I broke down today
But I really can't give it away

Dj drop the beat and don't stop!
Dj drop the beat and don't stop!

Yo I'mma get this, and I'mma get that
Yo I'mma get this, I'mma get that
Yo I'mma get this, and I'mma get that
Yo I'mma get this, I'mma get that
