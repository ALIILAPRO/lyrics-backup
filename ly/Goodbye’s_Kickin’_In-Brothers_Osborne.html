		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The echo of the front door slam
Drowns out I don't give a damn
Wasn't losin' sleep at all
Heard that song a hundred times
And ninty-nine I didn't mind
But this time, it just set me off

I've been getting over you just fine
But somehow something must've flipped a switch tonight

Like that first cigarette
Like that second shot of whiskey
Then chase it with regret
Yeah, the goodbye's kickin' in
Went from feelin' right
Just the right amount of tipsy
To the wishing you were with me
Yeah, the goodbye's kickin' in

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, the goodbye's kickin' in

I keep lookin' at my phone
Thinkin' you will, but bettin' you won't
Be the one who breaks down first
Had one too many two drinks ago
It just hit me, I'm alone
It's about to go from bad to worse, burn

Like that first cigarette
Like that second shot of whiskey
Then chase it with regret
Yeah, the goodbye's kickin' in
Went from feelin' right
Just the right amount of tipsy
To the wishing you were with me
Yeah, the goodbye's kickin' in

Whoa, oh, whoa
I'm sayin' goodbye
Sayin' goodbye
Sayin' goodbye

I've been getting over you just fine
But somehow something must've flipped the switch tonight

Like that first cigarette
Like that second shot of whiskey
Then chase it with regret
Yeah, the goodbye's kickin' in
Went from feelin' right
Just the right amount of tipsy
To the wishing you were with me
Yeah, the goodbyes kickin' in

Yeah, the goodbyes kickin' in
