		  (No sad days in LA)
No sad, no bad
No sad, no bad

No sad, no bad days in LA (in LA, in LA)
I'ma sail the seven seas just to separate myself from the fakes (fakes)
No sad, no bad days in LA (in LA, in LA)
So many days alone, on the road 
It was all worth the wait (worth the wait, worth the wait)
No sad, no bad days in LA (no days, no days, no days, yeah)

You was waiting, I was chasing
Stomping out the store, Gucci bracelet
No hesitation, what's the hold up? (What?)
Flyin' in a foreign, doing donuts
Watched my whole life change like a movie
First day in LA, a hundred groupies
My shorty in the ends afraid to lose me (lose me)
They gon' say I changed but I never changed
I just bought a chain, fuck a wedding ring (yeah)
Big body Range, pull up in a tank (tank)
Talkin' down my name, we gon' let it bang
They gon' claim they gang, they ain't really gang (gang)

No sad, no bad days in LA (in LA, in LA)
I'ma sail the seven seas just to separate myself from the fakes (fakes)
No sad, no bad days in LA (in LA, in LA)
So many days alone, on the road, it was all worth the wait
No sad, no bad days in LA (in LA, in LA, in LA)
