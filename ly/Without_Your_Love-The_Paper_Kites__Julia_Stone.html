		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can dance, I can shake
I can move and I can break
Like a fire in the soul
I can burn, I can grow
I can come, I can go
I can rock and I can roll
Down the road, start again
But I know that it ain't nothing

(Without your love, without your love)
That it ain't nothing
(Without your love, without your love)

I can play, I can sing
I can tell you anything
I can run, I can move
To the dark side of the moon
I can cross over seas
I can ride along the breeze
I can be, I can do
What I want
But it ain't nothing

(Without your love, without your love)
And it ain't nothing
(Without your love, without your love)

I can scream, I can fight
I can read and I can write
I can love, I can leave
I can get down on my knees
I can go, I can stay
In the night or in the day
I can lie, I can dream
I can try
But it ain't nothing

(Without your love, without your love)
Yeah it ain't nothing
(Without your love, without your love)

Like a storm in your brain
Like thunder in your veins
I can feel, I can touch
I can tell when it's too much
I can call out your name
I can try and keep the flame
Burning bright, hold a hand
To the night
But it ain't nothing

(Without your love, without your love)
And it ain't nothing
(Without your love, without your love)
We ain't nothing
(Without your love, without your love)
Nothing
(Without your love, without your love)
