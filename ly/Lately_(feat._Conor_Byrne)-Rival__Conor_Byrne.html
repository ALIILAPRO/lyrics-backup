		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Running in circles all over my mind, staying up late cause you stay hard to find
Stare at the ceiling just passing the time I'm hoping that you might just give me a sign
Cause I don't know what to do I'm sitting here just waiting, waiting
Whenever a call comes through I can feel my heart start beating

I haven't been sleeping lately cause of all these late calls
In my head you're creeping lately cause of all these late calls
 
I'm falling inside of this place, closing my eyes but I still see your face
Why does it feel like the walls caving in, then you send a text and I'm ok again
I've been so distant from this for a while, I should have moved on but I stayed in denial 
I don't know why you keep doing all this to me, all this to me
Cause I don't know what to do I'm sitting here just waiting, waiting
Whenever a call comes through I can feel my heart start beating

I haven't been sleeping lately cause of all these late calls
In my head you're creeping lately cause of all these late calls

I don't know what to do, in my head I hear you calling
Whenever I wait for you, I can feel myself start falling

I haven't been sleeping lately cause of all these late calls
In my head you're creeping lately cause of all these late calls
