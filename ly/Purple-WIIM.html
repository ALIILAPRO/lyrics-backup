		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see you with my eyes
I'm all about your vibe though
Gets me every time
I was hoping that it might though
You're just like the tide
You're down but you get high though
Swallow all your pride
Forget about the typos
No mistakes let's keep all the outtakes
Your last was last place you ain't bout to downgrade
Down since Addictions she download my mixtape
Though my MP3 she bout to catch my .WAV

Painted purple skies
Clouds are crystallized
Spiral down my mind
Time in black and white
Stars are so aligned
Dip into my mind
Dip into my mind disappear just you and I
We've been through the lies
Through the truth we unify
If it's Do or Die you can call me crucified
All we do is try maybe we could use some time
Maybe just maybe
Don't pause me don't play me
You raw inspiration I'm sprung can you blame me
Through all my changes you never delete me
We can't keep it PG
I need you you need me

Painted purple skies
Clouds are crystallized
Spiral down my mind
Time in black and white
Stars are so aligned
Dip into my mind
