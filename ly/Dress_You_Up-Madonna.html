		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've got style
That's what all the girls say
Satin sheets
And luxuries so fine
All your suits are custom made in London
But I've got something that you'll really like

Gonna dress you up in my love
All over, all over
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over your body

Feel the silky touch of my caresses
They will keep you looking so brand new
Let me cover you with velvet kisses
I'll create a look that's made for you

Gonna dress you up in my love
All over, all over
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over your body

Gonna dress you up in my love
In my love
All over your body
All over your body
In my love
All over, all over
From your head down to your toes

Gonna dress you up in my love
All over, all over
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over your body

Gonna dress you up in my love
In my love
All over your body
All over your body
In my love
All over, all over
From your head down to your toes

Gonna dress you up in my love
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over, all over
Dress you up in my love
Gonna dress you up in my love
In my love
All over your body
All over your body
Gonna dress you up in my love
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over, all over
Dress you up in my love
Gonna dress you up in my love
In my love
All over your body
Oh yeah, love you, boy
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over your body
All over, all over
From your head down to your toes
Gonna dress you up in my love
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over your body
Dress you up in my love
Gonna dress you up in my love
In my love
All over, all over
Oh yeah, love you, boy
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over your body
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over, all over
