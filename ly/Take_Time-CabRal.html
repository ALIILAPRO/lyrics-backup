		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take Time
You say good things take time
Don’t you girl
Waste time
You don’t wanna waste time
Don’t you girl
To make this last
I know one thing, that things go fast
I know two things, the good don’t last
I know three things, I love your laugh
One look at you, I forget my past
One look at you, I forget I’m trash
If I lose you, Ima get you back
If I lose you, Ima get you
And that’s just facts
Love to think about times we had
Love to think about times we have
More to come as long as this lasts
But knowing me, the things will end up bad
Seem to mess up all the things I have
Try my best but still I come right back
Try my best but still I come right
Take Time
You say good things take time
Don’t you girl
Waste time
You don’t wanna waste time
Don’t you girl
To make you stay
I know that you know, the way I think
I know back then, you would just want me
I know ‘cause of me, the things all changed
But when its dark, I only see your face
Want your heart, but i don’t feel a thing
Want you all, but you don’t feel the same
Want you all, but you don’t feel the
To get this off my mind
Homie told me, good things take time
Sometimes the old me, taking my mind
So I find me phoning, at the worst of times
So ya tell ya homies, that I lost my mind
But you right you know me
Maybe its time
For the loser old me, to go take a hike
But since you left, I ain't feelin’ right now
Take Time
You say good things take time
Don’t you girl
Waste time
You don’t wanna waste time
Don’t you girl
