		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Good morning
Has it been a long night?
Maybe been a long year, maybe been a hard life
Maybe you're not alright
If you got a little red in your eyes
You've come to the right place
People like you, people like me
This is where we all find grace

Come on now
Bet you'll wanna sing hallelujah, bet you'll say an amen
Can't help but celebrate being born again
Somebody who loves you, is waiting at the door
It's home sweet home here in the house of the Lord

Take a load off
You're about to find your rest
It's a crazy world out there, got some hope right here
Out of the wilderness

If you're needing water for your soul
Well, you're in the right place
Doesn't matter if you're rich or poor, whoever you are
This is where we all find grace

Come on now
Bet you'll wanna sing hallelujah, bet you'll say an amen
Can't help but celebrate being born again
Somebody who loves you is waiting at the door
It's home sweet home here in the house of the Lord
Bring your heartache, bring your burden
You can lay them down at the door
There is no fear, you belong here
Step into the house of the Lord
Bring your heartache, bring your burden
You can lay them down at the door
Ain't it so clear, you belong here?
Step into the house of the Lord (hallelujah)

Bet you'll wanna sing hallelujah, bet you'll say an amen
Can't help but celebrate being born again
Somebody who loves you is waiting at the door
It's home sweet home here in the house of the Lord
Bring your heartache, bring your burden
You can lay them down at the door
There is no fear, you belong here
Step into the house of the Lord
