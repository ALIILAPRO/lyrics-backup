		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Parents got divorced when I was, uh, five years old
And I saw my father about three times a year after that
And when he found out that he had cancer, he decided to
To bring me here and he gives me this big pink seashell
And he says to me, "Son, the answers are all inside of this"
And I'm all, "What?"
And then I realize, I realize that
The shell's empty, there's no point to any of this, it's all just a
A random lottery of meaningless tragedy and a series of near escapes

So I take pleasure in the detail
You know a, a Quarter Pounder with cheese
Those are good
The sky about ten minutes before it started to rain
A moment where your laughter becomes a cackle
And I sit back 
And I ride my own mountain
