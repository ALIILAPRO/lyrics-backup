		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How many times do I have to say
To get away, get gone?

Flip your shit past another lass's
Humble dwelling

You got your game, made your shot
And you got away with a lot
But I'm not turned on
So put away that meat you're selling

'Cause I do know what's good for me
And I've done what I could for you
But you're not benefiting
And yet I'm sitting
Singing again, sing, sing again

How can I deal with this
If he won't get with this?
Am I gonna heal from this?
He won't admit to it
Nothing to figure out
I gotta get him out
It's time the truth was out
That he don't give a shit about me

'Cause I do know what's good for me
And I've done what I could for you
But you're not benefiting
And yet I'm sitting
Singing again, sing, sing again

How can I deal with this
If he won't get with this?
Am I gonna heal from this?
He won't admit to it
Nothing to figure out
I gotta get him out
It's time the truth was out
That he don't give a shit about me

How many times can it escalate
Till it elevates to a place I can't breathe?
And I must decide, if you must deride
That I'm much obliged to up and go

I'll idealize, then realize
That it's no sacrifice because a price is paid
And there's nothing left to grieve

Fuckin' go
'Cause I've done what I've could for you
And I do know what's good for me
And I'm not benefiting
Instead I'm sitting
Singing again, singing again, singing again
Sing, sing again

How can I deal with this
If he won't get with this?
Am I gonna heal from this?
He won't admit to it
Nothing to figure out
I gotta get him out
It's time the truth was out
That he don't give a shit about me

How can I deal with this
If he won't get with this?
Am I gonna heal from this?
He won't admit to it
Nothing to figure out
I gotta get him out
It's time the truth was out
That he don't give a shit about me
