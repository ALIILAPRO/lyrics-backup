		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Pressure 
Driving through LA 
I shoulda known better

I quit smoking
It was easier than tryna quit you
And im hoping
That you'll fall in love with somebody new
Cause i know it
If it's up to me i'm not gonna choose
To miss you

Running through places
Flipping through phases
All that i'm craving 
Is you
Trying to change it
Cause i can't face it
All that i'm craving 
Is you

Pressure
Driving through la
I shoulda known better
Than to hit you up this late
Cause i never 
Have the heart to stay
But i should know better
Cause i still can't walk away

Walk away

It's ironic
When i know you couldn't be worse for me
But i want it
The good the bad all the intbetween
I can't stop it
Think i'm in love with the misery
Cause i want it 
no
Running through places
Flipping through phases
All that i'm craving 
Is you
Trying to change it
Cause i can't face it
All that i'm craving 
Is you

Pressure
Driving through la
I shoulda known better
Than to hit you up this late
Cause i never 
Have the heart to stay
But i should know better
Cause i still can't walk away

Walk away
