		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shake your money maker like somebody 'bout to pay ya
I see you on my radar, don't you act like you afraid of shit
You know I got it, if you wanna come get it
Stand next to this money like, ayy, ayy, ayy
Shake your money maker like somebody 'bout to pay ya
Don't worry 'bout them haters, keep your nose up in the air
You know I got it, if you wanna come get it
Stand next to this money like, ayy, ayy, ayy

Shake, shake, shake your money maker
Like you were shakin' it for some paper
Took your mama nine months to make ya
Might as well shake what your mama gave ya
You, you lookin' good in them jeans
I bet you look even better with me in between
I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
But you's a hell of a distraction when you shake your behind
I got J.O. up on my right side pourin' some cups
My whole hood is to my left and they ain't giving a fuck
So feel free to get loose and get carried away
So by tomorrow you forgot what you were sayin' today
But don't forget about this feeling that I'm making you get
And all the calories you burn from me making you sweat
The mile high points you earn when we taking my jet
And how everywhere you turn, I'll be making you wet 'cause you can

Shake your money maker like somebody 'bout to pay ya
I see you on my radar, don't you act like you afraid of shit
You know I got it, if you wanna come get it
Stand next to this money like, ayy, ayy, ayy
Shake your money maker like somebody 'bout to pay ya
Don't worry 'bout them haters, keep your nose up in the air
You know I got it, if you wanna come get it
Stand next to this money like, ayy, ayy, ayy

Switch, switch, switch it from right to left and (and)
Switch it 'til you runnin' right out of breath and (and)
Take a break until you ready again and (and)
You can invite over as many friends as (as)
You want to but I really want you
Just be thankful that Pharrell gave you somethin' to bump to, hey (hey)
Luda, I'm at the top of my game
You want my hands from the bottom to the top of your frame
And I just wanna take a lil' ride on your curves
And get erotic, givin' your body just what it deserves and
Let me give you some swimming lessons on the penis
Backstroke, breaststroke, stroke of a genius, yup
Call me the Renaissance man
Get up, and I stay harder than a cinder block, man, hey
I'm just a bedroom gangster
And I been meanin' to tell ya that I really must thank ya when ya

Shake your money maker (woo) like somebody 'bout to pay ya
I see you on my radar, don't you act like you afraid of shit
You know I got it, if you wanna come get it
Stand next to this money like, ayy, ayy, ayy
Shake your money maker like somebody 'bout to pay ya
Don't worry 'bout them haters, keep your nose up in the air
You know I got it, if you wanna come get it
Stand next to this money like, ayy, ayy, ayy

Release Therapy, rock, rock, rock, rock
Release Therapy, rock, rock, rock, rock

Rock, rock, rock it and make it work, girl
Please don't stop it until it hurt, girl
You, you been lookin' a little tipsy
So if you could just shake it a little this way
See I'm a member of the BBC
The original breadwinner of DTP
And you the center of attention that's distracting the squad
'Cause everybody in the camp is like, oh my God, she can

Shake your money maker like somebody 'bout to pay ya
I see you on my radar, don't you act like you afraid of shit
You know I got it, if you wanna come get it
Stand next to this money like, ayy, ayy, ayy
Shake your money maker like somebody 'bout to pay ya
Don't worry 'bout them haters, keep your nose up in the air
You know I got it, if you wanna come get it
Stand next to this money like, ayy, ayy, ayy
