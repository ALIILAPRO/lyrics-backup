		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can we just be honest?
These are the requirements
If you think you can be my one and only true love
You must promise to love me
And damn it, if you fuck me over
I will rip your fucking face apart

Step one
You must accept that I'm a little out my mind
Step two
This is a waste if you can't walk me down the finish line
Step three
Give me passion, don't make fun of my fashion
Step four
Give me more, give me more, more

If you can't handle a heart like mine
Don't waste your time with me
If you're not down to bleed, no, oh
If you can't handle the choking, the biting
The loving, the smothering
'Til you can't handle it no more, no more
Go home

Can we just be honest?
These are the requirements
If you think you can be my one and only true love
You must promise to love me
And damn it, if you fuck me over
I will rip your fucking face apart

High school sweethearts, line up
They're trying to waste my time
High school sweethearts, shut up
If you're not my type
High school sweethearts, line up
They're trying to waste my time
High school sweethearts, shut up
If you're not my type

Step five
You can't be scared to show me off and hold my hand
Step six
If you can't put in work, I don't know what you think this fucking is
Step seven, this one goes to eleven
If you cheat, you will die, die

If you can't handle a heart like mine
Don't waste your time with me
If you're not down to bleed, no, oh
If you can't handle the choking, the biting
The loving, the smothering
'Til you can't handle it no more, no more
Go home

Can we just be honest?
These are the requirements
If you think you can be my one and only true love
You must promise to love me
And damn it, if you fuck me over
I will rip your fucking face apart

High school sweethearts, line up
They're trying to waste my time
High school sweethearts, shut up
If you're not my type
High school sweethearts, line up
They're trying to waste my time
High school sweethearts, shut up
If you're not my type

Could you hold me through the night?
Put your lips all over my mine
Salty face when I start cryin'
Could you be my first time?
Eat me up like apple pie
Make me not wanna die
Love me rough and let me fly
Get me up, yeah, get me high
Tie me down, don't leave my side
Don't be a waste of my time

Can we just be honest?
These are the requirements
If you think you can be my one and only true love
You must promise to love me
And damn it, if you fuck me over
I will rip your fucking face apart

High school sweethearts, line up
They're trying to waste my time
High school sweethearts, shut up
If you're not my type
High school sweethearts, line up
They're trying to waste my time
High school sweethearts, shut up
If you're not my type
