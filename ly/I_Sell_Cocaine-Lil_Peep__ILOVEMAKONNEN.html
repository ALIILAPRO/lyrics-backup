		  Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm just like, mm-mm, mm
I'm a punkstar

I just like sellin' my drugs (sellin' my drugs)
And gettin' paid (and gettin' paid)
I only talk to the plug (I talk to the plug)
If he have that thing (yeah)
I sell cocaine (I sell cocaine)
I like to sell my drugs (yeah, ayy)
And make my pay (and make my pay, I sell cocaine)
I only talk to my plug (I talk to my plug, yeah)
If he got them things 'cause (got them, yeah, yeah)
I sell cocaine (I sell cocaine)
I just like sellin' my drugs (sellin' my drugs, yeah)
And making my pay (and making, yeah)
I only talk to my plug (I talk to my plug)
When he got them things 'cause
I sell cocaine (I sell cocaine)

I break it down like cement (woo)
A young nigga stay movin' like I can't pay the rent
I pulled up in a Buick, left out in a Sentra
God damn, we make so much, I can't even mention
Last summer in that Hummer, had it all in Montana
A young nigga movin' weight, I stay flamed up like bandanas
Your niggas know me on the block, I make money, tick-tock
I fuckin' had so much coke I was payin' off cops
Because the shit was god damn flying, boy, you know I'm not lying
I look like motherfuckin' giraffe all the way in South Africa
God damn, Makonnen, can you please stop with your flow?
I'm like I'll stand off on the corner and sell my blow 'cause

I like just sellin' my drugs (yeah)
And makin' my pay, yeah (makin' my pay, yeah)
I only talk to my plug (I talk to my plug)
When he got them things 'cause (when he got them things)
I sell cocaine (I sell cocaine)
I just like selling my drugs (selling my drugs)
And makin' pay, uh (and making pay)
I only talk to my plug (I talk to my plug)
When he got them things 'cause (when he got them things)
I sell cocaine

I sell cocaine, I do my thing if it's right
Or if it's wrong, I do my thing all night
I sell cocaine
I sell cocaine, yeah
I sell cocaine, I do my thing if it's right
Or if it's wrong, I do my thing all night
I sell cocaine, I do my thing if it's right
Or if it's wrong, I do my thing all night
I sell cocaine, I just-a sell cocaine
I sell my drugs, unless I sell it my way
Yeah, I'm movin' state to state
This shit come easy to me, yeah
I sell cocaine, I do my thing if it's right
And if it's wrong, I do my thing all night
I sell cocaine, I do my thing if it's right
Or if it's wrong, I do my thing all night
I sell cocaine, yeah, I'm back to selling cocaine
I sell cocaine, ooh, I'm back to selling cocaine
I sell cocaine now, baby, who wants some cocaine?
You want some cocaine over here?
You know I got some cocaine

You know I got that cocaine
Who, who got that cocaine?
Peep, he got that cocaine
Makonnen got that cocaine
We getting racks, yeah, okay
But, we got that cocaine
And you know it's for the low
And you know it's for the
Yeah
You know we got that cocaine, yeah
Yeah, I sell that cocaine, yeah
And, bitch, I look like cocaine, yeah
Bye
