		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once I was a soldier
And I fought on foreign sands for you
Once I was a hunter
And I brought home fresh meat for you
Once I was a lover
And I searched behind your eyes for you
And soon there'll be another
To tell you I was just a lie 

And sometimes I wonder
Just for a while
Will you ever remember me 

And though you have forgotten
All of our rubbish dreams
I find myself searching 
Through the ashes of our ruins
For the days when we smiled
And the hours that ran wild
With the magic of our eyes
And the silence of our words 

And sometimes I wonder
Just for a while
Will you ever remember me

Ever remember me
