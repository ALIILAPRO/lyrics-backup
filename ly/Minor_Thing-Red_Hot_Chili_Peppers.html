		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I change the key from C to D
You see, to me, it's just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything
To readjust you've got to trust
That all the fuss is just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything

It's just a minor thing and I'm a minor king
He knows everything
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

You've got your bit part, Mozart
Hot dart acceleration
Pop art, pistol chasing
Catfight intimidation
Oh, oh, oh, oh

To read a mind you've got to
Redefine the line to make your circle sing, y'all
He knows everything
You make a sound, the spell is bound
To come around, it's just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything

It's just a minor thing and I'm a minor king
He knows everything
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

You've got your bit part, Mozart
Hot dart acceleration
Pop art, pistol chasing
Catfight intimidation
All out interfacing
Black star motivation
Vampire, sugar junkie
Databasing infiltration

I change the key from C to D
You see to me it's just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything
To readjust you've got to trust
That all the fuss is just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything

It's just a minor thing and I'm a minor king
It's just a minor thing and I'm a minor king
