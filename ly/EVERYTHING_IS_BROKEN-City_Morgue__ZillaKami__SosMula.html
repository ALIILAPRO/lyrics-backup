		  (Yung Germ)

Looked death in the eyes 'bout thirteen times
I was in the trenches 'bout thirteen nights (okay)
Felt that my life was dead to rights
Started feel like a fighter after thirteen fights (what's up?)
How can I see when there's blood in my eye? (Huh?)
How can I do when I'm all out of time? (Huh?)
How can I sleep with nowhere to call home? (Huh?)
Wanna be shiny and metal and chrome, but no (okay)
Enemies are gettin' too close to me
If I lost all hope, would you hope for me?
And these leeches'll sink their teeth in me
If I lost all blood, would you don't for me?
All these enemies are gettin' too close to me
If I lost all hope, would you hope for me?
Well, it is what it is, it was what it was
You can't fight back and you can't stand up

And everything is frozen
And everything is broken
Blow my brain out, free me
Come and Kennedy me
And everything is frozen
And everything is broken
Blow my brain out, free me
Come and Kennedy me (sleezy)

Mama, she a whore, dad a drug addict (what?)
Mix that up, that stuff smashin' (smash)
You tried Percocets, you haven't done acid (what?)
Take a deep breath and we blood bath 'em (doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo)
Flashbacks like I'm back in twelfth (sleezy)
Mad packs, I had crack to sell (work)
Flashbacks, I was back in hell (no-no)
Kill myself, go back to jail (boom boom)
No luck gettin' jobs, just gotta stick me (boom)
Why the fuck the government one-punch hittin' me? (Fuck outta here)
Really here thuggin' it, ain't no bitch in me (no, no)
Why I cheat on her and she still wanna sleep with me? (Fuck outta here)
Shoot me 'til my back burns (no-no)
Stab me while my back turned (fuck outta here)
Cook until the crack burn (work)
Maybe I'm just bad germs (sleezy)

And everything is frozen
And everything is broken
Blow my brain out, free me
Come and Kennedy me
And everything is frozen
And everything is broken
Blow my brain out, free me
Come and Kennedy me
