		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm
I know, It's been coming for some time
When it's over so they sy

It'll rain a sunny day
I know shining down like water
I want to know
Have you ever seen the rain

I want to know
Have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day
Yesterday and days before

Sund is cold and rain is hard
I know, been that way for all my time
'Till forever on it goes
Through the circle fast and slow

I know, and it can't stop I wonder
I want to know
Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm

I know, it's been coming for some time
When it's over so they say
It'll rain a sunny day
I know, shining down like water

I want to know
I want to know
