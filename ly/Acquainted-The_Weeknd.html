		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, you're no good
'Cause they warned me 'bout your type, girl 
I've been ducking left and right
Baby, you're no good
Think I fell for you, I fell for you, I fell for you

You got me puttin' time in, time in
Nobody got me feeling this way
You probably think I'm lying, lying
I'm used to bitches comin' right 'way

You got me touchin' on your body
You got me touchin' on your body
To say that we're in love is dangerous
But, girl, I'm so glad we're acquainted, oh
I'll get you touchin' on your body
I'll get you touchin' on your body
I know I'd rather be complacent
But, girl, I'm so glad we're acquainted
We're acquainted

Baby, you're no good
All my niggas think I'm crazy 
'Cause I'm thinkin' 'bout us lately
But really if I could
I'd forget about you, 'get about you, 'get about you

You got me puttin' time in, time in
Nobody got me feeling this way
You probably think I'm lying, lying
I'm used to bitches comin' right 'way

You got me touchin' on your body
You got me touchin' on your body
To say that we're in love is dangerous
But, girl, I'm so glad we're acquainted, oh
I got you touchin' on your body
I got you touchin' on your body
I know I'd rather be complacent
But, girl, I'm so glad we're acquainted
We're acquainted

Mama called me cryin', cryin', cryin', cryin' 
'Cause I won't find somebody that's real, yeah (she wants somebody that's real)
'Cause every time I try to, try to, try to run
The fast life keeps gaining on me, yeah (the fast life keeps gaining on me)
But ever since I met you (ever since I met you)
I couldn't believe what you did
So comfort me, babe (comfort me, babe)
Ain't no rush from me, babe, ooh (ain't no rush from me, babe)

I'll keep on touchin' on your body
I'll keep on touchin' on your body
To say that we're in love is dangerous
But, girl, I'm so glad we're acquainted, oh
I got you touchin' on your body (touchin' on your body)
I got you touchin' on your body (touchin' on your body)
I know I'd rather be complacent
But girl, I'm so glad we're acquainted (girl, I'm so glad we're acquainted)
We're acquainted

Oh, oh, oh-whoa
Oh, oh, oh-whoa
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh

I'm not tryna talk at all
'Cause I'm tryna love you crazy
Put some more inside your cup
And drink 'til you numb the pain

I got you touchin' on your body
These girls keep touchin' on their body
They got accustomed to the life we live
These girls born in the 90's are dangerous
I got 'em thinkin' that they want me
Although they know they not the only
I got 'em wanting to embrace their sins
These girls born in the 90's are dangerous
