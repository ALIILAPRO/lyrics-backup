		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Streams of streets that seem to change you
But you know they'll always find you
Know one ever really knows you
In light of the heart
That beats over your head

Until you listen to it
Until you run right to it
There's no right way to do it
It's the light of the heart
That beats over your head

Turn up the stereo 
I can't hear when you talk so loud
I want to go wherever it goes
I want to be there in the red red red red morning

You found places to stimulate you
But you know they'll never change you
You could run forever
And find that the heart 
Still beats over your head

Turn up the stereo 
I can't hear when you talk so loud
I want to go wherever it goes
I want to be there in the red 
Red morning
