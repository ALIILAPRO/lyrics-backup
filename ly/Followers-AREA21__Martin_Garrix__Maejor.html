		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What about when no one watches?
Do you like yourself when you don't have your phone?
Will you still pretend you're happy?
What you gonna do when your followers gone?
(Oh, no)

Uh, maybe you will see the world
At the different light of day
Maybe you will feel no stress
When you don't care what people say
No pressure, what's a post?
Live a life I will suppose
Feelin' good, no need to pose (ayy)

I saw a pretty girl with my own eyes, not through a screen
And she was more than 2D, if you know what I mean
I started thinkin' with my own mind, not through machines
And ever since I made that change, the world is smilin' at me

It feel like
(Woo) Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It feel like
Ooh
(Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

What about when no one watches?
Do you like yourself when you don't have your phone?
Will you still pretend you're happy?
What you gonna do when your followers gone?
(Oh, no)

All the places we could go
You and I, stuck in the zone
How are we free when we let algorithms take control?
Tell me how we supposed to vibe?
When your life is your device
Let me give you me some advice

Go see a pretty girl with your own eyes, not through a screen
'Cause it's more clear than HD, with no glass in between
I started thinkin' with my own mind, not through machines
And ever since I made that change, the world is smilin' at me

It feel like
(Ayy) Ooh
It feel like
(Ayy) Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It feel like
Go, go, go
Ooh
It feel like
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

All these comments in my brain is kinda stupid (stupid, stupid, stupid)
Sometimes I get why people lose it (I get it)
I wonder if they couldn't show it, would they even do it? (Would you even do it?)
Ha, ha, I guess we're about to find out now

What about when no one watches?
Do you like yourself when you don't have your phone? (Do you?)
Will you still pretend you're happy?
What you gonna do when your followers gone?
When your followers gone?

What you gonna do, man? (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
What you gonna do when your followers gone? (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
When your followers gone
You got no likes, no DMs
It's not going down (ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ayy, ayy, ayy)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

What about when no one watches?
Do you like yourself when you don't have your phone?
Will you still pretend you're happy?
What you gonna do when your followers gone?
When your followers gone?
