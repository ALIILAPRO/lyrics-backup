		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You pinned me down
When I had lost all control
You made me look at myself in the mirror

I am alone in the house you’ve built
Not knowing where to turn with the promise you’ve made to me
Running in circles trying to find my way out of here

I am the martyr with the broken home
Lost, gone, diseased
Fully out of control
I am your first worst nightmare
And I am here to stay

I dug my own grave
(Wasn’t enough for you)
You dug my grave for me

Save me, dear mother conceal me

I am the martyr with the broken home
Lost, gone, diseased
Fully out of control
I am your first worst nightmare
And I am here to stay

I am back
Ive lost control but I am here to stay
And find my way back home
I am back
Ive lost control but I am here to stay
I am back
