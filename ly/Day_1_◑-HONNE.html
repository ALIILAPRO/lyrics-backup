		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You'll always be my day one
Day zero when I was no one
I'm nothing by myself, you and no one else
Thankful you're my day one
Thankful you're my

I got lucky finding you
I won big the day that I came across you
'Cause when you're with me, I don't feel blue
Not a day goes by that I would not redo

Everybody wants to love
It's easy when you try hard enough

You'll always be my day one
Day zero when I was no one
I'm nothing by myself, you and no one else
Thankful you're my day one
Thankful you're my day one

When I first met you, it just felt right
It's like I met a copy of myself that night
No, I don't believe in fate as such
But we were meant to be together that's my hunch

Everybody wants true love
It's out there if you look hard enough, enough, enough

You'll always be my day one
Day zero when I was no one
I'm nothing by myself, you and no one else
Thankful you're my day one

Hour by hour, minute by minute
I've got mad love for you and you know it
I would never leave you on your own
I just want you to know

You'll always be my day one
Day zero when I was no one
I'm nothing by myself, you and no one else
Thankful you're my day one

You'll always be my day one
Day zero when I was no one
I'm nothing by myself, you and no one else
Thankful you're my day one
Day one, day one, day one
Thankful you're my day one
