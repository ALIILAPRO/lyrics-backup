		  Ready to start shit? (OneHunnid on the beat)
(DY Krazy)

God come and take me out, this side all wrong
I don't wanna live here no more, I
I don't move around, then they gon' kill me in my home
The ones you known to be around not on my side
I don't fuck with niggas, never did, why would I lie?
Big dawg who? You got me fucked up, that nigga know he tried
I move by results, not by friends or things that's televised
Up or it's down, handle it like men, nigga I ain't ever hiding

I'm in that Bentley, me and my youngest son
He too young to understand but we still having our one-on-one
Ecclesiastes, I told him everything done under the sun
They'll kill you when you speak the truth
Thug you when you play it dumb
I die today then I'ma leave my son within my Rolls, yeah
Somewhere in the will he's in a big home, yeah
Since I been a child they knew what I'm on (I'm on)
Know you see niggas dying on your iPhone

Hurting you when I smile, oh
I might stall but I never lie, no
I see, they don't deserve me, truthful I speak
They won't murk me
Tell me, tell me
Somebody, can you please tell me?

Why the fuck I feel like I'm the only speaking up, and that's on my own?
'Fore I bow down to these niggas, I'll have my funeral in their town (yeah)

God come and take me out, this side all wrong
I don't wanna live here no more, I
I don't move around, then they gon' kill me in my home
The ones you known to be around not on my side
I don't fuck with niggas, never did, why would I lie?
Big dawg who? You got me fucked up, that nigga know he tried
I move by results, not by friends or things that's televised
Up or it's down, handle it like men, nigga ain't ever hiding

I'm swervin' and it's early
Got a burden on my heart and it's a burden on my mind
Suicide for playing no movies I done seen plenty times
Tired of fucking 'round with groupies
Four lil' boys and two lil' girls and they mine
Life misplacement, blood shooting out
Now that's some shit for my eyes
Shawty dying, Glocks on my mind
I'm being framed right now
Whoever did it admit it if they get it
I done carried on with my life
Seeing Pat wasn't right but still now, what the fuck I'ma do 'bout a wife?
Ya left her ring through the night
My heart wouldn't act right
Trying to explain so she can leave
Fucking with these bitches, tryna run you far from me
'Cause if something was to happen to you I wouldn't even wanna breathe

God come and take me out, this side all wrong
I don't wanna live here no more, I
I don't move around, then they gon' kill me in my home
The ones you known to be around not on my side
I don't fuck with niggas, never did, why would I lie?
Big dawg who? You got me fucked up, that nigga know he tried
I move by results, not by friends or things that's televised
Up or it's down, handle it like men, nigga ain't ever hiding

Fuck
And they know what it is
I ain't ever hiding, 4K Trey
It's the truth, this ain't no rap
Fuck a nigga
