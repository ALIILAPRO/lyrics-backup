		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm no super man
I can take your hand
And fly you anywhere you want to go, yeah
I can read your mind
Like a billboard sign
And tell you everything you want to hear but
I'll be your hero

I, I can be everything you need
If your the one for me
Like gravity, I'll be unstoppable
I, yeah I believe in destiny
I may be an ordinary guy without his soul
But if your the one for me
Then I'll be your hero

Could you be the one, could you be the one
Could you be the one for me? (I'll be your hero)
Could you be the one, could you be the one
Could you be the one for me? (then I'll be your hero)

Searching high and low
Trying every road
If I see your face, I'll barely know, yeah
I put my trust in faith
That you will come my way
And if it's right, it's undeniable, yeah
I'll be your hero

I, I can be everything you need
If you're the one for me
Like gravity, I'll be unstoppable
I, yeah, I believe in destiny
I may be an ordinary guy without his soul
But if you're the one for me
Then, I'll be your hero

Could you be the one, could you be the one
Could you be the one for me? (I'll be your hero)
Could you be the one, could you be the one
Could you be the one for me? (I'll be your hero)

So incredible
Some kind of miracle
And when it's meant to be
I'll become a hero, oh
So I'll wait, wait, wait, wait for you
Yeah, I'll be your hero

I, I can be everything you need
If you're the one for me
Like gravity, I'll be unstoppable (be unstoppable)
I, yeah, I believe in destiny
I may be an ordinary guy without his soul
But if you're the one for me
Then I'll be your hero

Could you be the one, could you be the one
Could you be the one for me? (then I'll be your hero)
Could you be the one, could you be the one
Could you be the one for me? (then I'll be your hero)
