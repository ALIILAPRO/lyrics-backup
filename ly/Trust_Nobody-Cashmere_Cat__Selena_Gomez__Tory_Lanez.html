		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a tell you how I want it
Baby, tell me how you need it
Hope you're good at keeping secrets
Say you're good at keeping secrets
'Cause you know I don't trust nobody
I know you don't trust nobody
Said only I can touch your body
So baby you know, I know, you know, I don't
You know I don't trust nobody
You know I don't trust nobody
Said only I can touch your body
Yeah only I can touch your body
'Cause only you know, I know, you know, I don't
You know I don't trust nobody

Baby, come through on a late night creep
Pull up on you like, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep (skrr, skrr)
Lying down know I'm in the back
Tinted windows sittin' in the back seat
You know I'm a freak right? (yeah, yeah)
Hit you on a free night (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I know what you keep tight (yeah, yeah)
You don't wanna leave, right? (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You don't wanna stay a little late?
I'll give you that tingle in your waist
Hit you when you need a little taste
Better watch my back

I'm a tell you how I want it
Baby, tell me how you need it
Hope you're good at keeping secrets
Say you're good at keeping secrets
'Cause you know I don't trust nobody
I know you don't trust nobody
Said only I can touch your body
So baby you know, I know, you know, I don't
You know I don't trust nobody
You know I don't trust nobody
Said only I can touch your body
Yeah only I can touch your body
'Cause only you know, I know, you know, I don't
You know I don't trust nobody

I pull up in that Jag, I'm not just anybody
I'm tryna holla back, even though I know, you know
I don't trust nobody, I don't trust nobody
But if I touch your body, we'll get right, right in your lobby
Come on down, let's get down, I'm with the shit
Are you down? 'Cause I'm down, when shit get lit
And you got a body like Selena in them jeans (haha) I wanna hit
I'm so open, gone and talk that shit

You must be somebody, 'cause I don't trust nobody
But if I touch your body, I might trust somebody, yeah
You must be somebody, 'cause I don't trust nobody
But if I touch your body, I might trust somebody, yeah
You must be somebody, 'cause I don't trust nobody
But if I touch your body, I might trust somebody, yeah
You must be somebody, 'cause I don't trust nobody
But if I touch your body, I might trust somebody, yeah

I'm a tell you how I want it
(How do you want it?)
Baby, tell me how you need it
(Just how I need it)
Hope you're good at keeping secrets
(I'm good, I'm good)
Say you're good at keeping secrets
(I'm good, I'm good)
'Cause you know I don't trust nobody
(Oh)
I know you don't trust nobody
(I don't)
Said only I can touch your body
So baby you know, I know, you know, I don't
You know I don't trust nobody
(I don't trust nobody)
You don't trust nobody
(I don't trust nobody)
Said only I can touch your body
Yeah only I can touch your body
'Cause only you know, I know, you know, I don't
You know I don't trust nobody

Hahaha
