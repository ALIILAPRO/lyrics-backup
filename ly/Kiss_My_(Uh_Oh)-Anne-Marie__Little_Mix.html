		  (Uh oh, uh oh oh oh)

Don't wanna hear one more lie
That used to work, but not tonight
That's the last time you doing me wrong
(Ah ah ah ah)
Got my stuff, I'm out the door
Now I'm the one you're begging for
Don't know what you got until it's gone
(Ah ah ah ah)

Already know how this goes (uh oh)
Give you my all, then you ghost (uh oh oh oh) 
But when I'm gone, you do the most, yeah (uh oh, uh oh)

Why you only love me when I'm walking away?
Only ever want me when I don't wanna stay
Love the feeling hitting different
I'm not ever looking back
While I'm leaving, see you staring
Go ahead, boy, you can kiss my
(Uh oh, uh oh)
You can kiss my
(Uh oh, uh oh)
You can kiss my

The only time I'm in your head
Is when you're alone up in your bed
Boy, I ain't the one, you got me wrong
(Ah ah ah ah) yeah
You send me roses every day
But I know the game you play
Boy, all you did was make me strong
(Ah ah ah ah)

'Cause I already know how this goes (uh oh)
Give you my all, then you ghost (uh oh oh oh)
But when I'm gone, you do the most, yeah (uh oh, uh oh)

Why you only love me when I'm walking away?
Only ever want me when I don't wanna stay
Love the feeling hitting different
I'm not ever looking back
While I'm leaving, see you staring
Go ahead, boy, you can kiss my
(Uh oh, uh oh) yeah
You can kiss my
(Uh oh, uh oh) oh, whoa
You can kiss my

Tell me about how you want me back
Baby, you can kiss my (uh oh)
Go on and on 'bout the times we had
Baby, you can kiss my (uh oh)

Tell me about how you want me back
Baby, you can kiss my (uh oh, you can, you can)
Go on and on 'bout the times we had
Baby, you can kiss my

Why you only love me when I'm walking away? (Walking away)
Only ever want me when I don't wanna stay (want me, yeah)
Love the feeling hitting different (I don't wanna stay)
I'm not ever looking back (I'm never looking back)
While I'm leaving, see you staring
Go ahead, boy, you can kiss my
(Uh oh, uh oh)
You can kiss my
(Uh oh, uh oh) la, la, yeah, you can kiss my
You can kiss my (ohh)

Tell me about how you want me back
Baby, you can kiss my, you can kiss my
Go on and on 'bout the times we had (yeah)
Baby, you can kiss my, you can kiss my
