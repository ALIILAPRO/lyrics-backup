		<p>
		  Thinking if this is alright
I don't think I can feel anything right now
If only I could stop the time
To fix my soul tell me how
Don't you know that boys do cry too?
Don't believe what they say it's not true
You sure know how I feel tho
Do you really think that you know me that well?
Stuck in my bed feeling like shit
That's my life most of the time
Oh how I wish to go out to the streets
Locked in my room unaware of crime
Don't you know that boys do cry too?
Don't believe what they say it's not true
You sure know how I feel tho
Do you really think that you know me that well?
Unable to talk to anyone
Talking to myself instead
Oh wouldn't we have fun
If we could see into each other's head
Don't you know that boys do cry too?
Don't believe what they say it's not true
You sure know how I feel tho
Do you really think that you know me that well?
Don't you know that boys do cry too?
Don't believe what they say it's not true
You sure know how I feel tho
Do you really think that you know me that well?
