		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the words had all been spoken
And somehow the feeling still wasn't right
And still we continued on through the night
Tracing our steps from the beginning
Until they vanished into the air
Trying to understand how our lives has led us there

Looking hard into your eyes
There was nobody I'd ever known
Such an empty surprise to feel so alone

Now for me some words come easy
But I know that they don't mean that much
Compared with the things that
Are said when lovers touch
You never knew what I loved in you
I don't know what you loved in me
Maybe the picture of somebody
You were hoping I might be

Awake again I can't pretend and I know I'm alone
And close to the end of the feeling we've known

How long you have been sleeping
How long you have been drifting
Alone through the night
How long have I been dreaming
I could make it right
If I closed my eyes
And tried with all my might
To be the one you need

Awake again I can't pretend and I know I'm alone
And close to the end of the feeling we've known

How long you have been sleeping
How long you have been drifting
Alone through the night
How long have I been running
For that morning flight
Through the whispered promises
And the changing light
Of the bed where we both lie
Late for the sky
