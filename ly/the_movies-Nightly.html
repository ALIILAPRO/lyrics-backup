		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Talked until you fell asleep
Now I'm driving home on dopamine
My brain is in the back seat
And my heart's in drive
I'm holding onto every word you said
Don't take it back now

Don't stop, baby, don't tell me that it's over
I can't take it, I'm shaking on the sofa
You know there's nothing like you and I together
'Cause when we touch, something in it moves me
I swear to God, feels just like the movies

(Feels just like)
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Feels just like the movies)

What if you take the night?
Walk around, talk about it
Get in a fight, you know I hate it when you're running high
What if it's wrong, baby, what if it's right?
What if it's love? Baby, give it a try
Don't take it back now

Don't stop, baby, don't tell me that it's over
I can't take it, I'm shaking on the sofa
You know there's nothing like you and I together
'Cause when we touch, something in it moves me
I swear to God, feels just like the movies

(Don't take it, don't take it, don't take it back now)
(Don't take it, don't take it, don't take it back now)
(Don't take it, don't take it, don't take it back now)
(Don't take it, don't take it, don't take it back now)

Don't stop, baby, don't tell me that it's over
I can't take it, I'm shaking on the sofa
You know there's nothing like you and I together
'Cause when we touch, something in it moves me
I swear to God, feels just like the movies

(Don't take it back)
Something in it moves me
(Don't take it back now)
Feels just like the movies
(Don't take it back)
Don't know what you're doing
(Don't take it back now)
Feels just like the movies
