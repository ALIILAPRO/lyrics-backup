		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don’t let nobody tell you who you are
I remember sleeping wishing on a shooting star
After practice over night cleaning working hard coming up short hoping one day I’d go far
I was young dumb broke and I was still naive
I had failed so many times but I still believed
That I would turn into that man everyone could see 
wouldn’t never let nobody tell him what He could achieve
I stayed focused walked right on my path
I told my mom I was leaving and I couldn’t come back
Hopped out my feelings
quit my job graduated and laughed then went to Cali straight broke and hopped right 
in my bag
Now I’m standing here speaking giving all I am
Trying to show you that the change starts with one man 
I ain’t lying cause I did so I know you can so here help the world understand that

This is motivation
For every single chance you ain’t taken
any rule that’s in your way you better break it
Shut up, embrace it
The pain is a pre-requisite without it how the fuck you think you Ever gon’ make it
The sweat is your payment
Fuck an escalator take the stairs to top right from the fucking basement
Your life is a statement 
Leave a legacy and stop waiting
Get yo ass up today and start chasing
This that motivation 

I’m hoping that this hits your soul
They’re just dreams till you sit down and you write your goals
I remember when they said I wasn’t built this strong I bounced back like elastic and put myself on
Now I’m Selling out these tickets to places I don’t know
Going to these places they said that I couldn’t go
Giving all my time to people at these shows
To spread this message and this music that i know brings hope
They feel it
I don’t gotta top a stupid chart or win a Grammy just show that I’m the realest 
I don’t need a co-sign from nobody if they ain’t said nothing by now they pretending not to see it
Any odd I beat, negativity delete it, I don’t care succes it’s the journey I fiending, 
if I say it meant it, 
flow(floor) dirty can’t clean it, 
give a fick about the past cuz I rip’d it
Now I’m bout to fucking hit the top
You fucking people can’t cancel me
Put me in box
Or fucking drive to me to insanity
I’m already crazy, 1/4 of me is all of you so half of me is two of you and 4 of you is all me, you’ll need a whole army if you thinking bout stopping me and 5 lifetimes if you’re thinking you can copy me
I’ve beaten poverty went to war and beat mediocrity my life is mine I’m molding that shit like I’m doing pottery
I’m not scared of failure I embrace it and chase it 
If there’s a 1 percent chance I can do it I take it
I took the hate they all threw sat down and I ate
Then took the motivation from it turnt to one of the greatest
And now every time i drop I know I’m making a statement
Replacing every single person that you got on your playlist
I’m not a product of the system that’s why no one can break it 
I’m trynna change the whole game man fuck being famous dawg
I’m Self proclaimed and I Never changed
I rock the same clothes and still got the same chain
It’s reminder when hooped and I would go and get my jersey 
And those people didn’t even know my name
Well now I know you you see it!
They told me leave I made a promise they would all feel it!
I couldn’t find the change so I said I’ll be it!
So I hope y’all know
This is Dax fucking self proclaimed 4 GOOOOOO!

This is motivation
For every single chance you ain’t taken
any rule that’s in your way you better break it
Shut up, embrace it
The pain is a pre-requisite without it how the fuck you think you Ever gon’ make it
The sweat is your payment
Fuck an escalator take the stairs to top right from the fucking basement
Your life is a statement 
Leave a legacy and stop waiting
Get yo ass up today and 
This is motivation!
