		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You make me dance, bring me up, bring me down
Play it sweet, make me move like a freak
Mr. Saxobeat
Makes me dance, brings me up, brings me down
Plays it sweet, makes me move like a freak
Mr. Saxobeat

Oh, yeah, mmh yeah, mmh yeah, mmh yeah
Oh-oh, yeah, mmh yeah, mmh yeah, mmh yeah

Hey, sexy boy, set me free
Don't be so shy, play with me
My dirty boy, can't you see?
You belong next to me

Hey, sexy boy, set me free
Don't be so shy, play with me
My dirty boy, can't you see? (You are the, you are the)
You are the one I need

(Mr. Saxobeat)
(Mr. Saxobeat)

You make me dance, bring me up, bring me down
Play it sweet, make me move like a freak
Mr. Saxobeat
Makes me dance, brings me up, brings me down
Plays it sweet, makes me move like a freak
Mr. Saxobeat

You are the one I need
Mr. Saxobeat

You are the one I need
Mr. Saxobeat
