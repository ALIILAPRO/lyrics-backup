		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have you ever felt like being somebody else?
Feeling like the mirror isn't good for your health?
Every day I'm trying not to hate myself
But lately, it's not hurting like it did before
Maybe I am learning how to love me more

It used to burn
Every insult, every word (mmm-mm)
But it helped me learn (yeah)
Self-worth I had to earn
So I tried every night to sit with sorrow
And eventually (hmm-mm-mm-mm)
It set me free

Have you ever felt like being somebody else? (Mmm-mm)
Feeling like the mirror isn't good for your health? 
Every day I'm trying not to hate myself (hate myself, oh)
But lately, it's not hurting like it did before
Maybe I am learning how to love me more

Just a little bit, love me more
Just a little bit, love me more
Oh no, love me more
Just a little bit, love me more

I used to cry (alone, yeah)
Myself to sleep at night 
I'd blame the sky (yeah)
When the mess was in my mind
I couldn't see, I couldn't breathe (yeah)
So I sat with sorrow
And eventually, it set me free (oh no)

Have you ever felt like being somebody else?
Feeling like the mirror isn't good for your health?
(If you have, let me hear you right now)
Every day I'm trying not to hate myself (yeah, yeah)
But lately, it's not hurting like it did before (sweet child, oh)
Maybe I am learning how to love me more

Just a little bit, love me more
Just a little bit, love me more
I'm gonna try to love me more
With a little bit of love (love me more, yeah)

Love me more (oh)
Love me more (just a little bit)
Love me more (love me more)
Love me more

(Oh-oh-oh) oh (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Gonna love me more)
 Gonna love me more, yeah
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (gonna love me more)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Gonna love me more)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh, I'm gonna love me more
