		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Things can get sour and strained
In the portrait of a lover's game
The obvious becomes a blur
Oh, when we shout so loud abusive words

And we're in need of some tenderness, mh
Like sun rays through a flying cloud
Did we have to be so featherless, mh?
When skeletons came pouring out
How about we fly towards the source again?
Let's switch from cold to warm again
Let's fly towards the source again
Oh, let's switch from cold to warm again

Now I don't mean to minimize your words
And there's a requisite to trust our hurt
And you been spending so much time with work
It really had me questioning my worth

And we're in need of some tenderness, mh
Like sun rays through a flying cloud
Did we have to be so featherless, mh?
When skeletons came pouring out
How about we fly towards the source again?
Let's switch from cold to warm again
Let's fly towards the source again
Oh, let's switch from cold to warm again

Oh, warm again
