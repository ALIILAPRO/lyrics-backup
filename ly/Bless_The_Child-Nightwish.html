		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was born amidst the purple waterfalls
I was weak, yet not unblessed
Dead to the world
Alive for the journey
One night I dreamt a white rose withering
A newborn drowning a lifetime loneliness
I dreamt all my future. Relived my past
I witnessed the beauty of the beast

Where have all the feelings gone?
Why has all the laughter ceased?

Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child

How can I ever feel again?
Given the chance would I return?

Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child
Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time

I've never felt so alone in my life
As I drank from a cup which was counting my time
There's a poison drop in this cup of man
To drink it is to follow the left hand path

Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child
Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time

Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time

Where have all the feelings gone?
Why is the deadliest sin,
To love as I loved you?
Now unblessed, homesick in time,
Soon to be freed from care, from human pain
My tale is the most bitter truth
Time pays us but with earth & dust
And a dark, silent grave.
Remember, my child
Without innocence the cross is only iron,
Hope is only an illusion 
And the ocean soul's
Nothing but a name

The child bless thee 
And keep thee forever
