		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love You, Lord
For Your mercy never fails me
All my days, I've been held in Your hands
From the moment that I wake up
Until I lay my head
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God

'Cause all my life You have been faithful
And all my life You have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God

I love Your voice
You have led me through the fire
In darkest night You are close like no other
I've known You as a Father
I've known You as a Friend
And I have lived in the goodness of God, yeah

'Cause all my life You have been faithful, oh yes You have
And all my life You have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God

Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
With my life laid down, I surrendered now
I give You everything, oh Lord
Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
Your goodness is running after, it's running after me (oh yeah, oh yeah)
Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
With my life laid down, I surrendered now
I give You everything
Your goodness is running after, it keeps running after me

And all my life You have been faithful
And all my life You have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
Oh, I'm gonna sing of the goodness of God
I'm gonna sing

All my life You have been faithful
(All of my life You've been faithful)
All my life You have been so, so good
(So good with every breath)
every breath that I am able
(Every breath I'm able)
I will sing (I'm gonna sing)
Of the goodness (of the goodness of God, yes I am)
I'm gonna sing of the goodness of God
Oh, I'm gonna sing of the goodness of God
