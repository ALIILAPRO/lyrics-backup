		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They told me I'm lucky
But it must be a joke
Alone with no money
And away from my folks
They said it'd be easy
Find love on my phone
But I'm just unhappy
In some stranger's home

Some people have it figure out
Life in the palm of their hands
Why can't I be like that
I wonder if it's too late now
How'd I get where I am
Did I slip through the cracks?

My friends are all married
With kids on the way
Their jobs are all steady
And I can't relate

Maybe I'm lonely
Or I'm just a fake
But I'm fooling no one
I'm just
A kid in my twenties
A kid in my twenties

They idolize college
But seem to forget
Yeah you'll gain knowledge
But mostly just debt
Still going to parties
I don't know what for
I end up more empty
Than cups on the floor

Some people have it figured out
Life in the palm of their hands
Why can't I be like that
I wonder if it's too late now
How'd I get where I am
Did I slip through the cracks?

My friends are all married
With kids on the way
Their jobs are all steady
And I can't relate

Maybe I'm lonely
Or I'm just a fake
But I'm fooling no one
I'm just
A kid in my twenties
A kid in my twenties

Oh did I get left behind
Cause everything has changed
And seasons pass me by
But I've just stayed the same
While they're all growing up
I'm just

A kid in my twenties
