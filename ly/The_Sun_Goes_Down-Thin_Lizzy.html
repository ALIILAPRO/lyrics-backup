		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There is a demon among us whose soul belongs in hell
Sent here to redeem us, she knows it all to well
He comes and goes, he comes and goes 
she knows it all too well
But when all is said and done
The sun goes down

She tries her best to leave him, but she is still captured by his spell
She knows now she must deceive him, he knows it all to well
She comes and goes, she comes and goes, he knows it all too well
But when all is said and done
The sun goes down

She comes and goes, she comes and goes, 
he knows it all too well
But when all is said and done
The sun goes down

There is a demon within us
The sun goes down
She tries her best to deceive him
The sun goes down
