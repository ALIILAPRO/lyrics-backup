		  (Oh-oh)
Yeah I talk my shit, now they calling me a leader (Oh-oh)
In a private jet, yeah I fly with no visa (Oh-oh)
And I'm tryna get high so I'm calling my dealer (Oh-oh)
Had to put on my team, had to put all my Gs up (Oh-oh)
Y'ain't seen the whole thing, ain't nun' but a teaser (Oh-oh)
Getting way too hot, 'bouta buy a new freezer (Oh-oh)
Was a hunnit for a feat, 'bouta put all my fees up (Oh-oh)
No, no, wins and losses, ion care about neither (Oh-oh)
Got the whole fucking underground whistling, 3 blind mice (Woo-woo, woo-woo)
Had 4, 5 racks in my jeans, now it's 8 or 9 (Ha, ha)
Boy I told you once, I'ma tell you twice (Ha, ha)
(Yeah your money) Yeah your money long but it ain't my height (Huh)
Hm, Melly just hit my line, got murder on my mind 
Told labels I don't wanna talk, if it ain't 6 figures, I ain't gonna sign 
What you think this is, what you think I'm lying?
Yeah they wanted me to sell my soul, but I love my life 
I had a vision and made that shit happen, nah they cannot silence us 
Gimme a beat and I'm making a hit, boy I got the Midas Touch 
All 'bout my business, I made me a company, turned it to mafia 
I got the scene in the palm of my hands, yeah nobody higher than us (Oh-oh)
Yeah I talk my shit, now they calling me a leader (Oh-oh)
In a private jet, yeah I fly with no visa (Oh-oh)
And I'm tryna get high so I'm calling my dealer (Oh-oh)
Had to put on my team, had to put all my Gs up (Oh-oh)
Y'ain't seen the whole thing, ain't nun' but a teaser (Oh-oh)
Getting way too hot, 'bouta buy a new freezer (Oh-oh)
Was a hunnit for a feat, 'bouta put all my fees up (Oh-oh)
No, no, wins and losses, ion care about neither (Oh-oh)
