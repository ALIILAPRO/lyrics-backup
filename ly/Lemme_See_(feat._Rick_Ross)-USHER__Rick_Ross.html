		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bluffin, yeah
I'ma need some lovin'
Lemme see what you got baby
So lemme see you
Usher, baby
I hear you, yeah (bluffin')
Rock with me (I'ma need some lovin')
(It's all or nothing) Fuck with me
So lemme see you, yeah

Hey girl, I'm debating if I should take you home
Should I take you home?
I don't mean to keep you waiting
But I just gotta know
If you're ready

She say she wanna take her skirt off
Be my guest
I decided to take my shirt off
And show my chest
And we been sipping on that Merlot
So you know what's next
The perfect intermission, switching positions
We so explicit oh

You been saying all night long
That you couldn't wait to get me home alone
What you gon' do to me
Don't talk about it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see
Girl I can't wait to get you home
Talk a good game mate, come on
Hollering 'bout what you gon' do to me
Don't talk about it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see

I'll be anticipating
What you would do to me
What you gon' do to me
Sex babe is the occasion
Hands on when you're with me
Give your heart to me, yeah

She say she wanna take her skirt off
Be my guest
I decided to take my shirt off
And show my chest
And we been sipping on that Merlot
So you know what's next
The perfect intermission, switching positions
We so explicit oh

You been saying all night long
That you couldn't wait to get me home alone
What you gon' do to me
Don't talk about it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see
Girl I can't wait to get you home
Talk a good game mate, come on
Hollering 'bout what you gon' do to me
Quit talking about it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see

Got on all my ice, talkin' cash shit
Been ballin' all my life, Lamborghinis, fast whips
She down to ride and she deserves a boss who's down to provide
We run the streets but on G5s, I'm talkin' fly
Boots and blue jeans, Cartier, Louis rings
You wit' a big boy so we do the big things
Had the valet parking, Chanel hoodie on
Looking like Trey Von Martin, George Zimmerman, I'm wanted
She on my wanted poster, Ciroc in my Mimosa
I'm ballin' like LeBron, we shoppin' in Milan
The 458 Ferrari, I park it on the lawn
I let her meet my tongue, she blew up like a bomb
The sex is so explosive, her stuff is supersonic
She my new addition, I swear I'm through it
Rozay and Usher Raymond, girl we the hottest
Rockin' the most ice, I say we the hottest

You been saying it all night long
That you couldn't wait to get me home alone
What you gon' do to me
Don't talk about it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see
I can't wait to get you home
Talk a good game mate, come on
Hollering 'bout what you gon' do to me
Don't talk about it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see

You bluffin' 
I'ma need some lovin'
I'ma need that 
It's all or nothing
All or nothing 
So lemme see it
Lemme see it, uh 
(Bluffin')
You scared (I'ma need some lovin')
You scared
Usher, baby (it's all or nothing)
All or nothing 
(So lemme see it) let me see it, see it
