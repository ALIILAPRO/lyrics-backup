		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't take it, dust is shaking
Aggravated, eyes are vacant
Teeth are grinning, walls are spinning
Having visions, hit my limit

I can't take it, dust is shaking
Aggravated, eyes are vacant
Teeth are grinning, walls are spinning
Having visions, hit my limit
I can't

I can't take it, dust is shaking
Aggravated, eyes are vacant
Teeth are grinning, walls are spinning
Having visions, hit my limit

I can't take it
I can't take it
I can't take it
I can't take it
I can't take it
I can't take it

The deepest wound, that I've known
I've let it go, I've let it go
The deepest wound, that I've known
I've let it go, I've let it go

The deepest wound, that I've known
I've let it go, I've let it go
The deepest wound, that I've known
I've let it go, I've let it go

I've let it go, I've let it go
I've let it go, I've let it go
I've let it go, I've let it go
I've let it go, I've let it go
(I can't)

I can't take it, dust is shaking
Aggravated, eyes are vacant
Teeth are grinning, walls are spinning
Having visions, hit my limit

I can't take it, dust is shaking
Aggravated, eyes are vacant
Teeth are grinning, walls are spinning
Having visions, hit my limit
