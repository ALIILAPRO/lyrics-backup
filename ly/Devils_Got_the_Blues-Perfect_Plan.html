		  DEVIL'S GOT THE BLUES
(Lyrics & Melodies: Kent Hilli, Music: Kent Hilli, Rolf Nordström, Leif Ehlin, Mats Byström, Fredrik Forsberg)

Oh yeah

Oh 
I'm going down
The time has come
You made me wonder where the hell i'm coming from
From higher ground
The day has dawned
You made me wonder when I have to face it all

i can't remember why we said goodbye
give it up 
you're breaking up
i can't remember why we turned this way
we got nothing more to say
I can't stand one more day, no

It's not a
One way road in to paradise
There's no excuse
You know the devil's got the blues
It's just a 
One way down if you pay the price
You stand accused
You're gonna lose
The devil's got the blues
oh, bad bad news

Oh
You'll come around
The day has come
You made me wonder why I never got things done
I hear the sound
I hear it all 
You made me wonder when i have to take the fall

PRE-CHORUS

CHORUS
.. the devils got the blues, oh the devil's got the blues, oh

BRIDGE
Every time u say
The price for all I have to pay
Every-time i hear you calling my name
I know it's bad 
The devil's got the blues

SOLO

BREAK 
Oh yeah, you're gonna lose

CHORUS X 2

OUTRO
The devil's got the blues
Oh, bad bad news
The devil's got the blues
