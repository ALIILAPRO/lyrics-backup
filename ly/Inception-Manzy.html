		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go back to the days when I wasn't faded
I could have a goal and feel like I actually made it
Now, I set them too high crazy
Running out of patience
How do I get them to play me?
Do I have to turn, and become Vader?
Nah I don't rap for the money, the women, the drugs
Put my heart in the pen and wear my gloves
Anyone will change if you don't show them love yeah
Man on a mission, passion is different
Driving with tunnel vision,
All that I see is part of the bigger picture woo
Yeah look what you got
I am the one the people all want
Changing the flow like where do I go?
No one goes harder than me
A freak of nature you better believe
My sound is something that no one can reach
Look at the math you know it complete woo
To form an image you have to be a painter
Yellow signs mean danger!
Don't get what I mean?
I'm making a scene, cause I am a stranger
And no one likes bad behaviour

Eenie meenie minie mo, yeah who questioning the flow?
Step in the mind it's a warzone
Step in the booth I go loco-motive I run you over
My words explosive
So fly I wonder what the grounds for?
Going up levels everyone stuck on the ground floor
See myself at five but like down four
Vision locked, on course
Boom boom hit em with the cold evidence
You know the flow is venomous
It's pretty evident
Vroom vroom drive by like the president
Put you in retirement like your David Letterman
Full of adrenaline lights off in my head again
Inventing all these beats and melodies
A rare specimen, a real gentleman, keep it genuine
Say what I know and keep doubt down low

I'm back with a vengeance
When you found me I know your hand went straight for the kill switch
But you can't kill this
Drive will keep on going till the day I die
Yea the battle is fought in the mind
The battle makes men on the frontline
Guess I'm something else
Cause I'm fighting hell from the inside out
Gods knocking not now
Going crazy lately vision hazy feeling shaky
Shouldn't phase me, I think maybe, they should pay me
No one pays me,
It's amazing on the daily put in work but still feel lazy woo
Riddle me this, riddle me that
What's a song with no meaning cap

Welcome to my Kingdom woo
We've reached the beginning aye
On the rise it's a given woo
You know fans they be singing
Open your mind, let it be blown,
Everyone knows, I got the flow,
Coming to me to copy the notes
Cause I kill that rhythm
Let it be known, don't mean to boast
Gimme a year then call me a goat
Part of the joke, I'm on a roll, I will not go slow woo

This is my inception oh
This is who I am oh
