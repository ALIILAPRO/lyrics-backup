		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To the music,
To the music,
It turned out to be,
Food for the Soul.

Can’t get enough,
Can’t get enough (for the soul),
Can’t get enough, 
Can’t get enough (food for the soul),

Can’t get enough (for the soul),
Can’t get enough (for the soul),
Can’t get enough (for the soul),
Food for the Soul.

Can’t get enough of
Can’t get enough of

When I first experienced the world of electronic music,
My perspective shifted,
A community of people so connected,
On this energetic wavelength,
With an undenying love and connection,
To the music.

To the music,
It turned out to be,
Food for the Soul.

Can’t get enough,
Can’t get enough (food for the soul),
Can’t get enough (for the soul),
Can’t get enough (for the soul),
Can’t get enough (for the soul),
Food for the soul.

Can’t get enough of,
Can’t get enough of,
Can’t get enough of,
Can’t get enough of.
