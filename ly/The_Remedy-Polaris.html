		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heavy hangs the air
Heavy lies the beating heart

Bloodshot, staring with a blank gaze
Deadbeat, carrying a dead weight
Dead-set on living like 
Tomorrow was to blame
And through these holes you'd see 
The blackest soul inside of me
One foot stuck in the past
One planted in my grave

Running circles
Old habits die hard
Each lesson learned never seemed to get too far
Call me reckless
Call me stuck in my ways
I'm torn between the remedies for everything (ah!)

Bloodshot, staring with a blank gaze
Deadbeat, carrying a dead weight
Dry mouth, taste it like a cut vein
Blackout, it all ends the same

So stay away, stay away
Can you tell when I lie right through my teeth?
No escape, no escape
Like a chain, in a way we are all bound to our fate

Don't let it bury me, me
We call this therapy

Running circles
Old habits die hard
Each lesson learned never seemed to get too far
Call me reckless
Call me stuck in my ways
I'm torn between the remedies for everything

Heavy hangs the air
Heavy lies the beating heart
Burden breeds remorse
Black clouds hover low like a curse

Like a curse

Running circles (running circles)
Old habits die hard
Each lesson learned never seemed to get too far
Call me reckless (call me reckless)
Call me stuck in my ways
I'm torn between the remedies for everything

I'm torn between the remedies for everything
I'm torn between the remedies for everything
