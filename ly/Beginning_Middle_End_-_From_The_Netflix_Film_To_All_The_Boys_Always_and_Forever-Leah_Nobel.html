		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes, you get what you've always been wishing for
And most times, it's not on your deadline, but that's alright
I was worn out and jaded from trying on people to love
But you fit so well

When they ask why I can never explain
But a symphony played when you told me your name
And I took that as a sign

Will you be my beginning, my middle, my end?
Will you be my beginning, my middle, my end?
Will you be my beginning, my middle, my end?
Will you be mine?

Mmm, mmm

Sometimes, it's hard to see what the future holds
And most times, it feels like a steep climb, and that's alright
There's magic in details, the tender small gestures of love
And the way they all add up

When they ask why I can never explain
But a symphony played when you told me your name
And it sounded like a sign

Will you be my beginning, my middle, my end?
Will you be my beginning, my middle, my end?
Will you be my beginning, my middle, my end?
Will you be mine?

Five years later and I'm still yours
Ten years later and I'm still yours
Fifty years later and I'm still your beginning and middle and end
Five years later and I'm still yours
Ten years later and I'm still yours
Fifty years later, and I'm still your beginning and middle and end
Beginning and middle and end (oh)

Will you be my beginning, my middle, my end? (Oh)
Will you be my beginning, my middle, my end? (Oh)
Will you be my beginning, my middle, my end? (Oh)
Will you be mine?
