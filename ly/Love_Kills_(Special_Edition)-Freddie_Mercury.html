		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love don't give no compensation
Love don't pay no bills
Love don't give no indication
Love just won't stand still

Love kills, drills you through your heart
Love kills, scars you from the start
It's just a living pastime
Ruining your heartline
Stays for a lifetime won't let you go
Cause love (love) love (love) love won't leave you alone

Love won't take no reservations
Love is no square deal
Hey love don't give no justification
It strikes like cold steel

Love kills, drills you through your heart
Love kills, scars you from the start
It's just a living pastime
Burning your lifeline
Gives you as hard time won't let you go
Cause love (love) love (love) love won't leave you alone

Hey love can play with your emotions
Open invitation to your heart
Hey love kills
Play with your emotions
Open invitation to your heart to your heart
Love kills love kills
Hey hey

Love kills (love kills)
Love kills (kills kills kills)

Love can play with your emotions
Open invitation

Love kills, hey, drills you through your heart
Love kills, scars you from the start
It's just a living pastime
Ruining your heartline
Won't let you go

Love kills, hey, drills you through your heart
Love kills, tears you right apart
It won't let go it won't let go

Love kills, yeah
