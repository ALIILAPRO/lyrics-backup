		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ninety miles on the highway
Every day moving so fast
Taking all the wrong ways out
Never saw you coming
Stopping me in my tracks
Keeping me from the long way down

Doesn't matter just how many times I tried
There could only be a single reason why
So tell me

How do miracles just happen like that?
Happen like that, happen like that
You can say the stars align but
I know that it's more than timing
How do miracles just happen like that?
Happen like that, happen like that
Right before I hit the ground some
How You came along and found me, ooh, ooh
Right before I hit the ground some
How You came along and found me

Some will say it's magic
But I know that You did all that
You're the reason, there's no doubt

Doesn't matter just how many times I tried
There could only be a single reason why
So tell me

How do miracles just happen like that?
Happen like that, happen like that
You can say the stars align but
I know that it's more than timing
How do miracles just happen like that?
Happen like that, happen like that
Right before I hit the ground some
How You came along and found me, ooh, ooh
Right before I hit the ground some
How You came along and found me

There's no doubt when I feel Your love
Call me crazy and out of touch
But I know that it's from above
Tell me

How do miracles just happen like that
Happen like that, happen like that
You can say the stars align but
I know that it's more than timing
How do miracles just happen like that
Happen like that, happen like that
Right before I hit the ground some
How You came along and found me, ooh, ooh
You can say the stars align but
I know that it's more than timing, ooh, ooh
Right before I hit the ground some
How You came along and found me
