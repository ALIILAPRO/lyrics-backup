		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bro put a box in draws, 35s and scores
Phone man if you want that
Don't talk like you're bad, you ain't on that
Combat, juice gon' spill like Cognac
Whip that shit, don't stop 'til I lock that
Heard there's a mash on sale, man cop that
Verbal abuse is long Akh, stop that
Back out the mash and drop that, shot that
If you want buj, man got that
Ban and TT smash it and dot that, chop that
Countryside where the gwops at
Jump in pics, you ain't bro, man crop that
No whip, then pedal bike risk it, he flipped it
Back out my shank and dip it, ballistic
Push in my shank and twist it
Pebs in cling, that's Oreo biscuits
Man's machine coming with lead
Misch and mash for the bread
This grey ting's way too fast
Bitch pull up your drawers, I only want head
Man put dick down in her neck, neck
Bore tongue, that's the best
Ejaculate in her mouth, or pull out ejaculate on her breast

In the field I'm Air Force stepping
More time I just smashed out packs in the ends
Right now I'm tryna get this bread in
Get round there and ching man up, like anything B get wetted
No face, no case and leathers
Four door whip with serious members
My bro wanna lurk on opps, so we go round there on a 125
Bro done whacked man's face
With the longest blade, tryna take man's eye
I heard that the opp boys ran with their shanks again
And I weren't surprised
Creepz Sav ain't on piss, he raps that shit and he ran 10 times
Packs on me, rambz on me, push bike hitting them shoots
Peng gyal on man from the B, feeling me and MSkum, too
My bros ain't down for the stunting
Digga D grab that dots and shoot
Us man ain't like them man
Them man lie and we tell the truth
Like, free all my bros, soon touch road
How many times have I rid on Bush
Like one of them boy gotta go?
Back out my ting and make man swim
Like ching man down on volts
Catch me a opp then stab up his head
Then ten toes back to the Grove
Then ten toes back to the Grove

Friend of a opp is a opp
So I won't find a way to go burn that bridge
My nigga Huncho gave him 22 chings
I can bet you that he's feeling pissed
Get round there samurais and flicks
JaySav put his whole rambz in your wig
My bro Digga D had the whole HR locked off when he crossed that bridge
If I get my hands on a opp
I ain't wetting him once, I'm wetting him numerous times
See a opp right there, tell bro don't jerk the car
Just keep it moving in line
4 and a half, got bags of ball and dust, man slap it in 10s
If I back my splash, he don't back it up
No leg shots, man put it in chests
Like, bros got a thing for dargs, teefing cats I ain't talking no pets
Bruck down a 9 in flake, and whip it in Zs
Let it dry then put it in pebs, cats them call for the meds
