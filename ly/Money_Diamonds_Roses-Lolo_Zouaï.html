		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Money and diamonds and all of the roses
Nothing compares to your love

You give me something to believe in
When all the glamour is deceiving
And I'm too messed up for the fucking show
And I don't want to go
But they're waiting on me, on me

If I swallow my fears
Keep my message in a bottle
Put a lock on my tears
Will I be better by tomorrow?

Money and diamonds and all of the roses
Nothing compares to your love
Shining like glitter but it isn't golden
It can't compare to this love

Hold my waist and keep me sane
I've been afraid of love
Now that you know my name
Liquor in our veins
You still can't save me from myself

If I swallow my fears
Keep my message in a bottle
Put a lock on my tears
Will I be better by tomorrow?

Money and diamonds and all of the roses
Nothing compares to your love
Shining like glitter but it isn't golden
It can't compare to this love

Money, diamonds, roses
Money, diamonds, roses
Money, diamonds, roses
Money, diamonds, roses

Nothing can keep us apart
Don't worry I won't stray far
Hold your hand close to my heart
Money and diamonds and roses
Can't keep us apart
