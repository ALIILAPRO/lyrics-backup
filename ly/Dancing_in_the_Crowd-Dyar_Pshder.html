		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Will you come over and spend the time
Until the sunrise
Your skin is to bright shinning in the dark
Oh god

Why do i have to cry when you're by my side
Oh you're mine
Taking you to rides at the night
And seeing you smile

We're slow dancing in the crowd
While we're the only lighted ones
You're shy and i'm having my perfect time
With you

Take me between your arms
That's where I always belong
I don't want to lie
I'm missing you all the time

Why do i have to cry when I'm by your side
Oh you're mine
Taking you to rides at the night
And seeing you smile

We're slow dancing in the crowd
While we're the only lighted ones
You're shy and i'm having my perfect time
With you
