		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hell is something you create yourself
All is right, all is well
There's no reason not to be yourself
Take a breath, look around

We're born in a universe full of explosions
Raised by the animal, chained to emotion
There's no reason not to have a little fun
One more trip around the sun
We're born in a universe full of explosions

Fear is just a feeling that can fall away
Let it go, let it fade
Life is more than an emergency
Here and now, seize the day

We're born in a universe full of explosions
Raised by the animal, chained to emotion
There's no reason not to have a little fun
One more trip around the sun
We're born in a universe full of explosions

Nothing but a grain of sand
In the sea and on the land
Spinning on a rock back to the nothing (back to the nothing)
There's more stars than grains of sand
So much we don't understand
Spinning on a rock back to the nothing

Hell is something you create yourself
All is right, all is well
Pain is only real if you live to tell
In peace and war
We'll ride the storm

We're born in a universe full of explosions
Raised by the animal, chained to emotion
There's no reason not to have a little fun
One last trip before we're done
We're born in a universe full of explosions
