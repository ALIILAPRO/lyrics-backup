		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Spread your love like a fever 
And don't you ever come down 
Spread your love like a fever 
And don't you ever come down 
I spread my love like a fever 
I ain't ever coming down 

She gave me love like a big fire 
I only saw it once 
She spread her love like a fever 
She's bad, but not enough 

(I'm so low) 
Spread your love like a fever 
(I'm so low) 
And don't you ever come down 
(I'm so low) 
Spread your love like a fever 
(I'm so low) 
And don't you ever come down 
I spread my love like a fever 
I ain't ever coming down 

She spread her love like a big fire 
I only saw it once 
She gave me love like a sister 
She's bad, but not enough 

(I'm so low) 
Spread your love like a fever 
(I'm so low) 
And don't you ever come down 
(I'm so low) 
Spread your love like a fever 
(I'm so low) 
And don't you ever come down 
I spread my love like a fever 
I ain't ever coming down 

Spread your love like a fever 
And don't you ever come down 
Spread your love like a fever 
And don't you ever come down 
Spread your love like a fever
Spread your love like a fever
Spread your love like a fever
Spread your love like a fever
