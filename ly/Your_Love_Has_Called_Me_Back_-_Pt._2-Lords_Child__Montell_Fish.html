		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have you ever heard it?
Have you ever felt so far away?
Have you ever burdened?
I wonder why Your love is here to stay
You hear me, Father
You see all pains, You're here to stay
You know our callings
Here on our boat, we sail away

Sail away sail away
Sail away sail away

Have you ever felt it?
A feeling that you can't ever escape?
Just know you're never left alone
The Father is always there to stay
Such a special feeling
Even if you're gone and ran away
You can always come home
Your Father's always there, don't run away

And even if you feel like no one's there
The Father gave His Son's light for His heirs
And even if you feel like no one's there
The Father gave His Son's light for His heirs

Your love has called me back now
Your love has called me back to You
Your love has called me back now
Your love has called me back to You
Your love has called me back now
Your love has called me back to You
Your love has called me back now
Your love has called me back to You
