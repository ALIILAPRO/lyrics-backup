		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have to say goodbye for now
It doesn't mean that I don't love you anymore
I'm still a young heart
There's so much I don't know and I'm changing

And it's been on my mind some time
I found a way to never let it show
But it was too hard
I'm just a young heart, it's time that I let go

And you are my light and I'm so lonely
But I know that I must go
Lost in the night but it's only a moment
Pray that you'll find your way home
Ohh, oh no

Goodbye my love, no crying
Let's not leave each other like this
'Cause even though our hearts are breaking
And through everything that's changing
I'll keep on loving you
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Loving you
Oh, I'll keep on loving you
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Loving you
Oh, I'll keep on loving you

Remember in the early days
And all the time we had to hide our love away
I was still a young heart
It was so easy for me to fall for you

And though I still need you now
Baby, I won't hold you down

You are my light and I'm so lonely
But I know that I must go
Lost in the night but it's only a moment
Pray that you'll find your way home
Ohh, oh no

Goodbye my love, no crying
Let's not leave each other like this
'Cause even though our hearts are breaking
And through everything that's changing
I'll keep on loving you
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Loving you
Oh, I'll keep on loving you
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Loving you

Told myself I was fine
I could keep holding on
Oh-oh, woo
Oh, I've tried but there's nowhere to hide anymore
I can't stay where we are
I won't stay where we are

Goodbye my love, no crying
Let's not leave each other like this
'Cause even though our hearts are breaking
And through everything that's changing
I'll keep on loving you
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Loving you
Oh, I'll keep on loving you
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Loving you
Oh, I'll keep on loving you
Oh, I'll keep on loving you
