		  Don't, don't
If you'd only believe in me
Don't, don't
If you'd only believe in me, yeah

(It's time to shine, it's time to shine)
It's time to shine
Give 'em what you got baby
Time to show them, all you are
It's time to shine
Gotta give 'em what you got
Gotta show them all, divine
Don't you think like that
I will love you honestly
If you'd only believe in me
Don't you think like that
I will love you forever
If you'd only believe in me, yeah

(In me, yeah)
