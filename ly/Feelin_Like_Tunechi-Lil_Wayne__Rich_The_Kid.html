		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Turn your wife to a groupie (yeah)
He got smoked like a loosie (yeah)
Ride the wraith like a hoopty (yeah)
I been feelin' like, I been feelin' like Tunechi
Coming live from the 504
Bad bitch in my mentions with a mil' on the floor
Big Tunechi, I can't ride the lil' Mazi' no more
Young niggas still grindin', I'm the motherfuckin' GOAT
I been feelin like Tunechi, huh
I been feelin like, yeah, fuck 'em
Let me get in my bag, duffle
Eat that bitch like the Last Supper
Got her feelin like, "ooh," Tunechi
Got me feeling like, "Yeah, fuck 'em"
Got me feelin' like Rich The Kid with grown-ass man money

I took the top off the 'cLaren, I'm letting the guts show
Walk in my bathroom, I step in the drug store
Treat the 200 for y'all like a tug boat, who want smoke?
Yeah, 'cause the bullet be drippin' like snot from a snub nose
I'm aimin' right to your heart like a love note
I told you right from the start, from the front door
I told her right from the pump, it's a gun show
It's me and Lil Richie and a fleet of some bitches
We stick to the code like Leo da Vinci
Many men, they wishing death upon me
Bop, bop, bop, give 'em three wishes
I need me a bitch that be needing them bitches
Fresh plate of pussy, I ain't cleaning the dishes
Chef's plate her bosom, yeah, I skeet on her titties
Creamy delicious, more babies than a pediatrician
Court days, I be leaning, I miss 'em
Nigga trippin' put the beef in the skillet
I pistol-whip 'em, I got teeth on the glizzy
Like, no way, can't believe it, I'm serious
No way, can't believe what I'm feelin'
No play, they don't need to play with me
OJ on this beat like it fit me

Turn your wife to a groupie (yeah)
He got smoked like a loosie (yeah)
Ride the wraith like a hoopty (yeah)
I been feelin' like, I been feelin' like Tunechi
Coming live from the 504
Bad bitch in my mentions with a mil' on the floor
Big Tunechi, I can't ride the lil' Mazi' no more
Young niggas still grindin', I'm the motherfuckin' GOAT
I been feelin' like Tunechi, huh
I been feelin' like, yeah, fuck 'em (fuck 'em)
Let me get in my bag, duffle (duffle)
Eat that bitch like the Last Supper (mmm)
Got her feelin' like, "Ooh," Tunechi (ooh)
Got me feeling like, "Yeah, fuck 'em" (yeah)
Got me feelin' like Rich The Kid (yeah)
With grown-ass man money (yeah)

Weezy F, bitch, don't forget the Baby (Baby)
Big Tunechi watch cost four-eighty (Big Tunechi)
And I'm still screamin', "Fuck you, pay me"
I been feelin' like Tunechi, bought a Maybach Mercedes (Skrt)
I'm in the Trukfit
I'ma fuck on a bitch and I make her lit (make her lit)
Man, I feel like Tha Carter, really rich (really rich)
Keep it real, 100, I could never switch
You just a worker, the boss in this bitch (boss)
I go platinum just talkin' my shit (just talkin' my shit)
My bitch too bad, get a bag if she throw a fit (fit)
I'm the GOAT killer, rappers get their throat slit (throat slit)
Count another fifty mil' like, "Oh, shit" (oh, shit)
Bank account gettin' heavy like a gold brick (gold brick)
I might buy a Bugatti (Bugatti)
Feelin' like Tunechi, baby mama get a big body

Turn your wife to a groupie (yeah)
He got smoked like a loosie (yeah)
Ride the wraith like a hoopty (yeah)
I been feelin' like, I been feelin' like Tunechi
Coming live from the 504
Bad bitch in my mentions with a mil' on the floor
Big Tunechi, I can't ride the lil' Mazi' no more
Young niggas still grindin', I'm the motherhfuckin' GOAT
I been feelin' like Tunechi, huh
I been feelin' like, yeah, fuck 'em (fuck 'em)
Let me get in my bag, duffle (duffle)
Eat that bitch like the Last Supper (mmm)
Got her feelin' like, "Ooh," Tunechi (ooh)
Got me feeling like, "Yeah, fuck 'em" (yeah)
Got me feelin' like Rich The Kid (yeah)
With grown-ass man money (yeah)

Got me feelin' like, "Fuck 'em"
