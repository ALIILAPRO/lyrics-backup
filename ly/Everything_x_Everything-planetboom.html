		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am ready to give my all to Jesus
You're the only one who has freed us
You have set me apart
Loved me right from the start
I give You all that I am
I give You all of my heart

I ain't got no shame i ain't got no pain
'Cause You took it all away
Yeah You took it all away
So I'm going all in you got me now
Imma give You all the praise
Imma shout it out

You are so good you make me complete
You gave it all so I'll give all of me
And all I want is You for all of my days
And I'll give You my praise
I give You all of me

I am ready to take it to another level
For all You've done for me
Ayy, I'm never gonna settle
I give You all my praise
All my heart and desire i give You my life
Now I'm living on fire

I ain't got no shame i ain't got no pain
'Cause you came and changed the game
Yeah you came and changed the game
So I'm going all in you got me now
Imma give You all the praise
Imma shout it out

You are so good you make me complete
You gave it all so I'll give all of me
All I want is You for all of my days
And I'll give You my praise
I give You all of me

If you got the joy of the Lord in your heart
Let me hear you shout
Na, na, na, na (Na, na, na, na)
If you got the joy of the Lord in your heart
Let me hear you sing
Na, na, na, na (Na, na, na, na)
If you got His praise your heart, pour it out
Let me hear you shout
Na, na, na, na (Na, na, na, na)
If He set you free, free indeed, just like me
Let me hear you scream (Here comes the fire)

You are so good you make me complete
You gave it all so I'll give all of me
For all of my days i'll give You my praise
I give You all of me
