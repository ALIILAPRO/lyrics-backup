		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Beautiful people, beautiful people,
Beautiful people, beautiful people,
Beautiful people, beautiful people

Take a look around at all the people
Everyone is trying hard to compete
If they only took the time
But looked a little deeper
They'll find, I'll find, you'll find
That beauty is skin deep
It's not what you wear, it's just who you are
And if we're going far then what will be? 
Yeah, oh, yeah
Beautiful, is it what we need, is it what we need, oh


Everyone collides, but I'll abide
People need to be true to themselves
When will we stop hurting and learn to love one another?
Momma said, don't judge a book, by its cover
Cause soon you will discover
It's unnatural
Psychological, oh, oh
Sing with me, oh with me, work with me
Beautiful, people, beautiful

Is it what we need? Is it what we need?
Is it what we need? Is it what we need?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Deep inside, deep, deep down inside, deep, deep,
Deep inside, deep, deep, down inside
Deep inside, deep, deep down inside, deep, deep,
Deep inside, deep, deep, down inside

All we need is love, beautiful

Deep inside, deep, deep down inside, deep, deep,
Deep inside, deep, deep, down inside
Deep inside, deep, deep down inside, deep, deep,
Deep inside, deep, deep, down inside

All we need is love, beautiful

Is it really hard to love another?
When space and race and colors not the same
It's time that we start open our eyes

And take off the cover
To bigotry, evil mockery and even jealousy
Cause love is so much sweeter
With room to live our lives
Even if we sacrifice
Take one day at a time
We all can be
Beautiful, people
Beautiful

Is it what we need, is it what we need?
Is it what we need, is it what we need?

Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful

It's what's missing it's what's missing,
It's what's missing in this world, beautiful

It's what's missing it's what's missing,
It's what's missing in this world, beautiful

It's what's missing it's what's missing,
It's what's missing in this world, beautiful

It's what's missing it's what's missing,
It's what's missing in this world, beautiful

Beautiful people, beautiful people

Take a look around and tell me what do you see
Take a look around and what, what do you really owe

Deep inside, deep, deep down inside, deep, deep,
Deep inside, deep, deep, down inside
Deep inside, deep, deep down inside, deep, deep,
Deep inside, deep, deep, down inside

All we need is love, beautiful

Deep inside, deep, deep down inside, deep, deep,
Deep inside, deep, deep, down inside
Deep inside, deep, deep down inside, deep, deep,
Deep inside, deep, deep, down inside

All we need is love, beautiful
