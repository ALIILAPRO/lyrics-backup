		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And the endless crowds of people
They walk upon this stone
Where will their memory go
Where did their minds come from
And I was only a child
When I first looked in your eyes
And saw your body rise over the ocean

We saw the golden boy bleed love
Onto the sand like rain
While we were injecting colours
Into our open veins
And deep beneath the water
The dead black silence crawled

Far away across the ocean
The golden boy's beneath the sea
The golden boy swallowed by the sea

And love is sometimes violent
And violence has no constraint
And I can see inside you
Yes I can feel what you think
And with this knife of silver
I will release your soul
And throw it out into the ocean

Nine million miles in a straight line
In a place just like this
In a ship on the water
Where no dimensions exist
My hands are holding your picture
And the image it shifts
I tear it up and scatter it over the ocean
The golden boy that was swallowed by the sea
