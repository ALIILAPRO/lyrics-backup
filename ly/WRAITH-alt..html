		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It’s turning into heresy, you transform to tragedy. Roll the dice with my faith and set the soul on fire. You say it’s all in my head but what’s your true desire. You plant the seeds of fear to sort the weeds from the flowers. You suffocate the weak to fill the pockets of the sour. Its turning into heresy. Its stripped me down to the bone. You transformed to tragedy and turned it into gold. I’m floating away, the wraith calls me by name. I’m floating away, to escape this world of hate. I feel the blood on my face as i suspend in darkness. I feel the call of the wraith, but it will not see triumph. I’ve played the waiting game and i got tired of the odds. The words they preach are lies of men just playing god. I’m floating away, the wraith calls me by name. I’m floating away, to escape this world of hate. Is there a pulse or are we mad? I’ve lost the patience. Fear is god wearing a mask and its contagious, yeah. I’ve lost all my patience, got nothing to say. I’m floating away to escape, this world of hate. Fear is god wearing a mask. I’m floating away, the wraith calls me by name. I’m floating away, to escape this world of hate. I’m floating away. I’m floating away. I’m floating away. To escape, to escape this world of hate.
