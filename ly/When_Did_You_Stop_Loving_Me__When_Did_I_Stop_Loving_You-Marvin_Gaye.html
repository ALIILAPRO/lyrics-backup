		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know when you say your marriage vows
They're supposed to be for real
I mean
If you think back about what you really said
You know, about, honor, and loving
And obeying until death do us part and all
But it shouldn't be that way, it should
It should, it shouldn't be lies because it turns out to be lies
If you don't honor what you said, you lie to God
The words should be changed

Ooh, now as I recall we tried a million times
Again and again and again, and that isn't all
I gave my love to you each time to make amends
Suddenly I start to realize I can't make it
Pretty birds fly away, I had to leave you for my health's sake
What to do? Make you pay, for leaving you my fine is to pay forever
So if a fresh new love comes in I won't say those words again
Instead, I'll say I'll try to love and protect you
With all my heart as long as you want me to baby

Ooh, if I love again I'm gonna try a new way this time
Memories of the things we did, some we're proud of, some we hid
So when two people have to part, sometimes it makes them stronger
Do you remember all of the bullshit, baby?
You say you love me with all your heart
If you ever loved me will all of your heart
You'd never take a million dollars to part
I really tried, you know I tried, oh, baby
Although we tried, all of those promises was nothin' but lies
I really tried, you know how I really tried, we really lied, didn't we, baby?
And on top of that, you have scandalized my name
What I can't understand is if you love me
How could you turn me into the police?
Didn't I love you good and try to take care of you?
Best I could
You were so divine
And your love was like mellow wine
Pains of love, miles of tears
Enough to last me for my lifetime
Broken hearts last for years, soon break away to the noonday sunshine
One thing I can promise, friend, I'll never be back again
But I'm not really bitter, babe (all the love in the world)
I wish you all the luck and all the love in the world
(All the good luck in the world)
Good luck in the world (ooh)
But I know you'll never be satisfied (good luck in the world)
No, you still want me standin' by your side (good luck in the world)

Memories haunt you all the time, I will never leave your mind
Got judgment on your side
You've said bad things and you've lied
Still, I remember some of the good things, baby
Like love after dark and picnics in parks
Those are the days I'll not forget in my life
I'd rather remember, remember the joy we shared, babe
I'd rather remember all the fun we had
All I ever really wanted was to love you and treat you right
All we did was fuss and fight
It don't matter, baby, take a lesson from them all
I never thought I'd see the day
When you'd put me through what you put me through
You tried your best, you say I gave you no rest

When did you stop loving me?
When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me?
When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me?
When did I stop loving you?
