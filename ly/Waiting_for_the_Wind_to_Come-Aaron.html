		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gravity is way too strong
For the birds inside my lungs

How I wish I'd never dared
Crossed the roads of nowhere

'Cause no streets belong 
To the angels of the storm

So don't you ever dare
Cross the roads of nowhere

Once your feet ease on their ground
They sell your dreams at lost and found 

A quiver rushes in your blood
We're the heartbeat of the world

Looking for the dragon's tail
Gambling with the wind to come
Gambling with the wind to come

Gravity is way too strong
For the birds inside my lungs

How I wish I'd never dared
Crossed the roads of nowhere

'Cause no streets can belong
To the angels of the storm

So don't you ever dare
Cross the roads of nowhere

Once your feet ease on their ground
They sell your dreams at lost and found 
Once your feet ease on their ground
They sell your dreams at lost and found 

A quiver rushes in your blood
We're the heartbeat of the world

Looking for the dragon's tail

Gambling with the wind to come
Gambling with the dream to come 
Waiting for the wind to come
Waiting for the dream to come
Waiting for the dream to come
