		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am nothing but the sum of my regrets
Anchored to this hollow shell, numbness swallows me
Flooding horizons in a blaze of frost and snow

You can find me there, wandering out of sight
In a place somewhere between the black and white
Where colors fade, desaturate and myopic gaze
Turns into endless nightfall

This world keeps taking pieces
Dissolve this tundra, it's all I know
This world keeps taking pieces
Alone, I feel the void call to me

It comes in waves, turning like clockwork
Confine me to this empty waste, I can't escape
Coasting dissociated, upon the frozen current
Bleakness fills my clouded eyes yet I see right through
These withered hands, desensitized, burn in the frigid waste
I've spent too long staring into the abyss

Lost myself inside the day and night
Between the black and white
Look beyond the light
That you will find between the black and white
That you will find between the black and white
That you will find (that you will find) between the black and white

I am nothing
But the sum of my regret
This world keeps taking pieces
This world keeps taking pieces

It comes in waves, turning like clockwork
Confine me to this empty waste, I can't escape
Coasting dissociated, upon the frozen current
Bleakness fills my clouded eyes yet I see right through
These withered hands, desensitized, burn in the frigid waste
I've spent too long all alone

It comes in waves, it comes in waves
Confine me to this empty waste I can't escape
Coasting, dissociated
Upon the frozen current, bleakness fills my clouded eyes
Yet I see right through
These withered hands, desensitized, burn in the frigid waste
I've spent too long staring into nothingness

Lost myself inside the day and night
Between the black and white
Look beyond the light
That you will find between the black and white
That you will find between the black and white
I'm lost in time, I'm lost in time
Between the black and white

I am nothing (between the black and white)
I feel nothing

Lost myself inside the day and night
Between the black and white
Look beyond the light
You'll never find between the black and white
That you will find between the black and white
You'll never find, you'll never find
Between the black and white

I am nothing but the sum of my regret
Anchored to this hollow shell, numbness swallows me
Flooding horizons in a blaze of frost and snow

Lost in the folds inside the infinite dreamscape
On the precipice of where worlds collide
Remind me of the feeling lost in the distance
Cleanse me of this soulless existence
