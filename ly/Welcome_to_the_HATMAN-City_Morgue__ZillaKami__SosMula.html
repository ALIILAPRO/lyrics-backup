		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ayo, Shoki this go crazy)
(Tell 'em, 3quinox)

Choppa, choppa, body droppa, yellow kamikaze bombers
Stanley Kubrick style dramas, lethal shooter since a teen
Poppas jailed by petty coppas, rockers turn to grocery stockers
Go out in a blaze for it's too late empty yo' magazine

Drugs on psychedelic waves, a psychonaut, explore 'yo brain
Neurologic damage, sleep paralysis like every day
Say welcome to the Hatman, he gon' take you far away
He right near the coat rack, man, peripherals they turn to shapes

(Ewok, ewok, ewok) uh, uh
Bitch, I'm the Hatman
Kidnappings in the black van (vyoom, vyoom, vyoom)
I'm off a triple stack and a half Xan (gimmie that, gimmie that, gimmie that)
I eat 'em back to back like I'm Pac-Man (gimmie that, gimmie that, gimmie that)
My whip shake like it got Parkinson's (vyoom, vyoom, vyoom)
I fuck a bitch face when I'm off the gin (splash, splash)
I'm like a big ape when I'm walking in (ewok, ewok)
Leave you with a split face when the .40 hit
You could catch Sleez on a battleship (ewok)
Sleeping with a badder bitch (gimmie that, gimmie that)
Sleeping with paralysis (ewok, ewok)
Uh, bitch, I'm sleeping with a attic bitch (splash, splash)
Sleeping with a plastic bitch (splash, splash)
Sleeping with a actress (ewok, ewok, gimmie that, gimmie that)
My whip shake like it got Parkinson's (vyoom, vyoom, vyoom)
I fuck a bitch face when I'm off the gin (gimmie that, gimmie that, gimmie that)
I'm like a big ape when I'm walking in (vyoom, vyoom, vyoom)
Leave you with a split face when the .40 hit (splash, splash)

Drugs on psychedelic waves, a psychonaut, explore 'yo brain
Neurologic damage, sleep paralysis like every day
Say welcome to the Hatman, he gon' take you far away
He right near the coat rack, man, peripherals they turn to shapes

(Good times)
