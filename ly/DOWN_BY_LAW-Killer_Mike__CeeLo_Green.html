		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just think timin' is everything
Like nigga, this it, this, this one right here
That ain't easy
Stay motivated, stay inspired
I owe it to myself, stay down on it
And it ain't been hard throughout the journey
It's been a journey
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Hey-ayy-ah

Hello, hello, my niggas
Hello and hello, my niggas
Please keep it mellow, my niggas
Stop sippin' yellow, my nigga
You itchin' and twitchin', and glitchin', my nigga
Listen, my nigga (shh)
Snakes in your circle and them bitches hissin', my nigga
My nigga don't listen
One thing I hate 'bout my nigga
So I just pray 'bout my nigga
Nigga, it's hard
Niggas done gave up on God
Maybe God gave up on us
Maybe She angry we worshippin' all these false idols
So devils just prayin' on us
This for the junkie, the fiend and the loser
Prayin' to God in the back of a cruiser
I pray that prison can cure your addiction
And devil's affliction don't hurt you no more
Needin' no reason, but I'll let you know
I was so young when I stood at that store
That I did not know that the money you paid me
Was meant for your babies, and now they just poor
It was just business, my nigga
I am not vicious, my nigga
I had no vision, my nigga
I wanted Gucci and Fendi, my nigga
Gucci, Givenchy, my nigga
But none of them crackers, they love us, my nigga
All of them crackers said fuck us, my nigga
Mad 'cause they women in love with the god
They fuck us and suck us, and love us, my nigga
Back to the trap, back to the Dickies and buffs
Lookin' like I drive a truck
Fuckin' my bitch? Shit, better be rich
She buy a new bag of weed
Goddamnit, I don't understand it
But if she's an addict, this Gucci purse gon' get her geeked
Thick with an ass
She is as bad as Shabazz
Pretty as Coretta Scott
All that I got, she got the face of a model
She got the heart of Asada
She from the gutter, my nigga
Wife and a mother, my nigga
Winnin' together, my nigga
Free Leonard Pelletier, my nigga, Obama
Please free our mama, my nigga
Asada, my nigga
Please free Mutulu, my nigga
Heart of a Zulu, my nigga
Free Larry Hoover, my nigga
Free Jeff Fort, my nigga
Fuck all the courts, my nigga
Movin' like Malcolm and Martin the King
Lift Every Voice is the song that I sing
Born in the womb of a beautiful teen
I am a beautiful, wonderful thing
I am a king, my woman's a queen
Master of hearts, say that we are the God
I studied hard like John Henrik Clarke
Even of my days of whippin' it hard
I'll tell the devil that Black man is God
Keepin' it player, just playin' my part
Lean on my Demon and post in teh park
Jewelry all gleamin' like Rakim Allah
My Eric B. is my nine in the car
You try to G me, get nine in your jaw
Bless all the felons that handled the raw
Fuck all the tellers that ran to the law (Hey)
Watch out for the hitters with sticks in the car
My name is Michael, I'm down by law

Won't You help us so, Holy Father? (Holy Father)
And I could show is a martyr
If nobody's gonna live forever, than neither am I
Two shots for the city that raised me (Atlanta, Georgia)
Thanks for the praise that you gave me (something for ya)
Because without it, nobody would've known that I was even alive
I'm down
This shit is so Atlanta
Down by law
