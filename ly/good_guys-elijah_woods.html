		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ya you know it's been some time
Since i had you on my couch
I'm just thinking out loud
Maybe you should come and stay a while
Miss that that little mouth
I could never go without
Damn i mean i really miss your smile
Say you got plans
Baby get it while you can
Cause darlin' i want you now
So come through if you're down
You act like a lady
Know you're crazy
When it's just you and me
Ain't dramatic
Problematic
Baby girl best believe
I know you got another dude
And i'm kinda bad news
But i know that i'm the one you want
And baby he don't gotta know
If you're putting on a show
So gimme everything that you got
The sun's rising
And we're at it again
You on my skin
And i'm gonna dive in
We're just having fun
Now you're thinking i'm the one
But i'm not
I ain't one of the good guys
I ain't one of the good guys
I ain't one of the good guys
You're such a dick
But bet i still know what you like
Been running round my head now you're here in my bed
And you know we got all night
Looking at your outline up against the skyline
Damn it happens every time
Think you fall in love then when the morning comes
I'm gone up out your life
Trust i'm not your type
You act like a lady
Know you're crazy
When it's just you and me
Ain't dramatic
Problematic
Baby girl best believe
I know you got another dude
And i'm kinda bad news
But i know that i'm the one you want
And baby he don't gotta know
If you're putting on a show
So gimme everything that you got
The sun's rising
And we're at it again
You on my skin
And i'm gonna dive in
We're just having fun
Now you're thinking i'm the one
But i'm not
I ain't one of the good guys
I ain't one of the good guys
I ain't one of the good guys
No i'm not baby, one of the good guys
No i'm not baby, one of the good guys
No i'm not baby, one of the good guys
No i'm not
I ain't one of the good guys
