		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad

Oh I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

You know sometimes baby I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes again it seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy
I want you to know
I never meant to take it out on you
Life has its problems
And I got my share
But that's one thing I never meant to do

'Cause I love you
Oh baby
Know I'm just human
You know I have my faults like anyone
Sometimes I find myself alone regretting
Some little foolish things
Simple thing I've done

'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Misunderstood, yeah
No, no please, Lord
Don't let me be misunderstood
Don't let me be misunderstood
