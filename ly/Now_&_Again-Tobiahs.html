		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you want to be
In another world with me
Just take another look around
And you will see

That this is where you belong
This is where you might feel at home
Do you hear us call
Do you hear us calling out

Do you feel it now and again
Feel it coming on my friend
Take away your reason
I'm holding onto dreaming (oh)
Do you feel it now
Do you feel it now and again
Feel it coming on my friend
Take away your reason
I'm holding onto dreaming (oh)
Do you feel it now, oh now again

I will set you free
From all the things that you hold
Where no one's gonna tear you down
We will go

This is where you belong
This is where you might feel at home
Do you hear us call
Do you hear us calling out

Do you feel it now and again
Feel it coming on my friend
Take away your reason
I'm holding onto dreaming (oh)
Do you feel it now again

Do you feel it now and again
Feel it coming on my friend
Take away your reason
I'm holding onto dreaming (oh)
Do you feel it now, oh now again

Do you feel it now oh now, and again, again
Do you feel it now, again
Do you feel it now
Do you feel it now
Do you feel it now, oh now again

Do you feel it now and again
Feel it coming on my friend
Take away your reason
I'm holding onto dreaming (oh)
Do you feel it now
