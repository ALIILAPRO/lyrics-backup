		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah

I done been on my shit, I ain't had no option (oh, oh)
Now I'm the trendin' topic, Margiela when I'm walkin' (yeah, yeah)
Ridin' foreign, I told your bitch to hop in
Bitch, I got my spot, yeah, you thought that we was parking (oh, spot)
Light it up, spark it (woah), she look good, bartender (woah)
She look good in Margiela (woah), I could tell you want cheddar (woah)
What we on? It's uncensored (woah), I ain't doin' no extra (yeah)
You can't ride my wave then act like you don't know Tecca

Let it go, let it fly (fly), dripped in diamonds, colorblind (blind)
Rolls with the blinds, so I never get behind (woah, oh)
I been on my shit (shit), swear that shit gon' multiply (yeah)
I love being home, but I'm on the other side, yeah
Yeah, it took time to glow, yeah, it took a lot to glow, yeah
She wanna go on a trip, yeah, I gotta go on the road
We not goin' in the club, 'cause she wanna play with her nose
I travel around the world, yeah, and she wanna come to a show, yeah

I can't take time, nigga, I can't FaceTime (FaceTime, woah)
I can't fake kick it, nigga, with them fake guys
I can't waste time, nigga, I can't make lies
Gotta be why how I change, I could change lives

I done been on my shit, I ain't had no option (oh, oh)
Now I'm the trendin' topic, Margiela when I'm walkin' (yeah, yeah)
Ridin' foreign, I told your bitch to hop in
Bitch, I got my spot, yeah, you thought that we was parking (oh, spot)
Light it up, spark it (woah), she look good, bartender (woah)
She look good in Margiela (woah), I could tell you want cheddar (woah)
What we on? It's uncensored (woah), I ain't doin' no extra (yeah)
You can't ride my wave then act like you don't know Tecca

Woah, yeah
Woah, yeah-yeah
Woah, yeah-yeah
Woah, yeah-yeah
