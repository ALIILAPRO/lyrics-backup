		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's turning out just another day
I took a shower and I went on my way
I stopped there as usual
Had a coffee and pie
When I turned to leave
I couldn't believe my eyes

Standing there I didn't know what to say
Without one touch
We stood there face to face

And I was dying indside to hold you
I couldn't believe what I felt for you
Dying inside I was dying inside
But I couldn't bring myself to touch you

You said hello then u asked my name
I didn't know if I should go all the way
Inside I felt my life have really changed
I knew that it would never be the same

Standing there I didn't know what to say
First time looked away when I whispered your name

And I was dying indside to hold you
I couldn't believe what I felt for you
Dying inside I was dying inside
But I couldn't bring myself to touch you

I was dying indside to hold you
I couldn't believe what I felt for you
Dying inside I was dying inside
But I couldn't bring myself to touch you

One hello changed my life
I didn't believe in love at first sight
But you've shown me what is life
And I now I know my love (I know this love is right)

And I was dying indside to hold you
I couldn't believe what I felt for you
Dying inside I was dying inside
But I couldn't bring myself to touch you

I was dying indside to hold you
I couldn't believe what I felt for you
Dying inside I was dying inside
But I couldn't bring myself to touch you
