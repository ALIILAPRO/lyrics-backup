		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  People get ready 
There's a train a-comin' 
You don't need no baggage 
Just get on board 
All you need is faith 
To hear the diesel hummin' 
You don't need no ticket 
Just thank the Lord 

People get ready 
For the train to Jordan 
It's pickin' up passengers 
From coast to coast 
Faith is the key 
Open the doors and board on 
There's room for all 
Amongst who loves the most 

There ain't no room 
For the hopeless sinner 
Who'd hurt all man kind 
Just to save his own 
Pitied are those 
Whose chances grow thinner
There's no hiding place 
In the kingdom's throne 

People get ready 
There's a train a-comin' 
You don't need no baggage 
Just get on board 
All you need is faith 
To hear the diesel hummin' 
You don't need no ticket 
Just thank the Lord
