		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  he used to be kind of a happy guy but then one day he said good-bye to the person he used to be and grow wings to set himself free he flew away from all of us away from what he once was a charade of phony smiles he's now a case in the x-files and the chain around his neck is a reminder a symbol of liberty how free he once was in our society he spends the day leaving his white mark on the statues of great man 'cause he remembers how he used to hate them he flies by outside my window there are not many of his kind he flies by outside my window he's the hero of our time he had a dream about this world
