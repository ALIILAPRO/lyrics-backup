		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I watched
Through bitter eyes
As the blood filled
In the cracks, black
A burning effigy
Told me I should
Kneel 'cause

I'm worshipping
With terror, a disease
Bum the sacred oil

They told us
There'd never come a day
They told us that
We need not worry
So we fucked around, thought
This shit would change
And turned our eyes away

I am the power siege
And the rush you
Will feel, thrill
Exploding out of me
Through clenched
Teeth I will scream out

We're suffering
With malice you deceive
Puke sold as salvation

They told us
There'd never come a day
They told us that
We need not worry
So we fucked around, thought
This shit would change
And turned our eyes away

And I watched it slip away
And you watched it slip away
And we watched it slip away

'Cause no one took a stand
