		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Know what I'm sayin'
Get jealous of a nigga or something tryin' to
Check it out, whole lot of jewelry
Trying to surpass me
My time nigga
Real shit
Clams Casino, nigga
Don't do all that talking nigga
A$AP
A$AP nigga, fuck you talkin' 'bout?
Meet me at the finish line bih
Pew

I say motherfuck you niggas for the hate that you investin'
Fuck police 'cause he probably wanna arrest me (check it out)
Fuck the prison system, this injustice was ingestive (slatt)
All black tuxes, get the white collars jealous like
All my role models either dead or in the pen
I had no choice to be the nigga that I am
Stuck with bros, stuck the code
'Cede emblem on the fender (yeah)
Couple fans in the hood I got no choice but to vent
Going in front to back
At events, fuckin' packed
With the hits back to back
Where the gas from the back
Gold on gold, platinum plaques
On the road after that (yeah)
She on a pole on a roll, make it clap, bring it back
Real bitches where you at? Real niggas where you at?
Makin' niggas send a couple real niggas where you at though?
How could I not be negative when I don't trust my relatives?
Niggas want settlements and bitches want like seven kids

Fuck fake people, I'ma go ahead and address it
Fuck you too just because you never said it
God hate evil, you just blowin' all your blessings (A$AP)
Black tux, white collar formal on wedding

Time to divorce (time to divorce)
Line up the courts (line up the courts)
Tuxedo, don't try to support them
No time to support 
When it's time to go off
Come fuck with your boy

I'ma shine through it all
Shine and all
Takeoff, lightyear
Shootin' star
Shine and all, shine and
All

To the cathedral, tux like I'm married (Tux on like I'm married)
Don't got a ring on but it feel like I'm married (ring on my finger)
To the cathedral, tux like I'm married (like I'm married)
Know when that ring involved, know that it married
Fuck views and opinions
I'm willin' to die, seemin' to shake off the image
But when I'm inside, pretendin' to smile
I feel the same high from the vengeance
I mean, I know we're both grown, like who are we kiddin'?
Goodbye to the crack way
The picket fences, kids in the kitchen
Stuck in this world, I feel lost
I'm feelin' trapped in my thoughts
I don't know who to trust, just got my word and my balls
This is hell and a ho
I know this the life that we chose
But lovin' the life that we livin'
We'll make it in the beginnin'
Save me the tux
Save me the tux for the endin'
Endin'
