		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mama done told me son don't play with guns
Do right by God or
Be on the run, she said hold tight
And don't go messing around
Only takes one shot to take a good man down

Papa done told me son don't kill that man
Don't want no blood on your
Christian hands, he said hold tight
Till the Sheriff's in town
When he spoke to me, laid my ear to the ground

Brother done told me kid don't be like him
Serving twenty years in a old state pen
He said hold tight
Till Sheriff's back in town
Only takes one shot to take a good man down

Mama done told me son don't play with guns
Do right by God or
Stay on the run, she said hold tight
Heard the Sheriff's back in town
Only takes one shot to take a good man down

Devil came to me with a plan
You ride shotgun, I'll drive the van
I said hold tight
Think Sheriff's back in town
Only heard one shot before I hit the ground
Only takes one shot to take a good man down
