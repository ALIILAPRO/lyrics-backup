		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Goodbye, evergreen
You know I love you
But everything heaven sent
Must burn out in the end
I promised you

Just as you were in my dream
Now let me off easy
And I'll slip down through the drain
To release my scattered brain, my enemy

Something just isn't right
I cut from the inside
I'm frightened of the end
I'm drowning in my self-defense
Now punish me

Think of me as what you will
I grow like a cancer
I'm pressed out in the rain
Deliver me from the poison pain

Goodbye, evergreen, goodbye, evergreen
Goodbye, evergreen, goodbye, evergreen
You know I love you, you know I love you (you know I love)
Goodbye, evergreen, goodbye, evergreen
Goodbye, evergreen
You know I love you, you know I love you (you know I love)

Goodbye, evergreen, goodbye, evergreen
You know I love you, you know I love you (you know I love)
Goodbye, evergreen, goodbye, evergreen
You know I love you, you know I love you (you know I love)

Goodbye, evergreen, goodbye, evergreen
Goodbye, evergreen
You know I love you, you know I love you (you know I love)

You know I love you
You know I love you
You know I love
