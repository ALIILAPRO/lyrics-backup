		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eternal the kiss I breath
Siphon your blood to me
Feel my wounds of your god
Forever rape mortality
I smell of death
I reek of hate
I will live forever
Lost child pay the dead
Bleeding screams of silence
In my veins your eternity 

I'll kill you and your dreams tonight
Begin new life
Bleed your death upon me
Let your bloodline feed my youth 

First breath born come alive learn to kill
Blood-fest awaits to feed your hunger
Dark side has no rival test your faith in blood
Night hides the hunting packs a feeding frenzy 

I'll kill you and your dreams tonight
Begin new life
Bleed your death upon me
Let your bloodline feed my youth 

I am the first not the last
Condemned by a single kiss
Betrayed eternally I'll rip inside your soul
Contaminating the world
Defying god and son
Black heart that brings your death
Living in infamy 

Drink the flesh of life itself
Prepare to reign a thousand years 

I'll kill you and your dreams tonight
Begin new life
Bleed your death upon me
Let your bloodline feed my youth 

Blame god chosen children
As you die I'm immortal
Faithless no religion
Stalking prey is my confession
Captive blood enslavement
Pain and hunger drives your madness
Drink flesh life itself
Prepare to reign a thousand years
