		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  c fight was fought off the battlefield
Oh where is my brother, where is my brother?
Between the drugs and our habits
Something to discover, some kind of lover
But when I face my loving mother
I feel ashamed, I feel the shame
I think about the end of thinking
With a smile, with a smile

This fight is fought off the battlefield
Oh where is my brother, where is my brother?
Between my drugs and my habits
You will uncover, some kind of lover
cnd when we face our loving mother
Take it in, just take it in
cnd when we find the end of thinking
Give a smile, give a smile
