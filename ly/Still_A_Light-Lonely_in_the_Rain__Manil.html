		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [If there’s still a light, I must find it]
I would always wait for you
‘Cause you were my light
Yeah you were my light
And now it’s so dark
Have we lost our spark?
‘Cause you were my light
Yeah you were my light
I wish I’d known
How you left
Me on my own
But I followed
You caged me in
In the hollows
There’s still a light
There’s still a light
So I hold on for you
I thought you were my light
I thought you were my light
I wish I’d known
How you left
Me on my own
But I followed
You caged me in
In the hollows
There’s still a light
There’s still a light
