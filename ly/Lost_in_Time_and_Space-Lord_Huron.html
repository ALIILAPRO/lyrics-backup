		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lost in time and space
Aimless drifting in a far off place
Hurtling through the vast unknown
Staring straight into the pure, black void

Drowning in the sea of stars
Lost in a galaxy of cocktail bars
Blinded by the neon lights
I lie awake and say your name into the night

I guess she's gone for good
She don't call me like I thought she would
She went west to chase her dreams
She took my money, but she didn't take me

Why go wander unknown worlds?
Stay right here and let the cosmos twirl
Blind without her source of light
I light a flame and say her name into the night

I don't know who I am, I don't know where I am

Lost in time and space
Aimless searching for a long, lost face
Haven't got a thing to lose
If I don't find her, gonna tie that noose

I quit my job and packed my car
Left in a hurry, and I've sure come far
Driving fast with no headlights
I'm wide awake, I say her name into the night

Oh, I'll find a way, I say your name into the night

I don't know who I am, I don't know where I am
I don't know who I am, I don't know where I am
I don't know who I am, I don't know where I am
I don't know who I am, I don't know where I am
