		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you left last summer
You told me things would always be this way
When you left last summer
You told me the love would never go away
And like a fool, I just believed you
I could never see the future
But it's see-through now
I can't deny I fucking need you
But something tells me you look
Better in the rearview, oh

So can you tell me where the love's at?
Fuck that, I don't even wanna feel anymore
And she like "Why you nevеr call back?"
I been busy tryna find my way
Up back from the floor
I been busy tryna keep my ass
Up out of the morgue
Usеd to love you, used to trust you
But I can't anymore
The feeling now's not the same as before
But I'll always love you
You're my dearest, la fleur

A letter titled "where I've
Been" came in today
It said you moved on and you're happy
And you hope I do the same
Is that what you tell yourself
When no one's left around?
I'm making a choice, I'm ending it here
The flower will die but I
Can't interfere, oh oh, whoa

So can you tell me where the love's at?
Fuck that, I don't even wanna feel anymore
And she like "Why you never call back?"
I been busy tryna find my way
Up back from the floor
I been busy tryna keep my ass
Up out of the morgue
Used to love you, used to trust you
But I can't anymore
The feeling now's not the same as before
But I'll always love you
You're my dearest, la fleur
