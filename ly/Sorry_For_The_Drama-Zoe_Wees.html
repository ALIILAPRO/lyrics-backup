		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So-so-so sorry, mom, sorry for all the drama

No, I've never seen
The sunset from the other side of the world
No, I've never been
Where they play around with the diamonds and pearls
Went to school wearin' fake-ass Timbs, had everybody starin'
Two-dollar shades so no one sees me cryin' these tears
'Cause I was tired walkin' 'round fakin' smiles

Drove a car that you couldn't afford
I'm so jealous 'cause they had it all

We were never rich kids, rich kids
And always had a wish list at Christmas
I thought that I was missin' somethin'
And I'm so-so-so sorry, mom, I'm sorry for all the drama
Different, different
I probably should've listened, listened
I thought that I was missin' somethin'
And I'm so-so-so sorry, mom, I'm sorry for all the drama

I wanted something
Saw the tears rollin' down into your purse
Just wanted to fit in
I didn't know how bad it all hurt
And yeah, I was sick in school, no daddy's in the pictures
On the walls, I struggled with my demons
I'm scared
We won't make it to the other side of the world

We were never rich kids, rich kids
And always had a wish list at Christmas
I thought that I was missin' somethin'
And I'm so-so-so sorry, mom, I'm sorry for all the drama
Different, different
I probably should've listened, listened
I thought that I was missin' somethin'
And I'm so-so-so sorry, mom, I'm sorry for all the drama

We were always goin' somewhere
Though it feels like we've been nowhere
We were always goin' somewhere
(And I'm so-so-so sorry, mom, I'm sorry for all the drama) oh
We were always goin' somewhere
Though it feels like we've been nowhere
We were always goin' somewhere
(And I'm so-so-so sorry, mom, I'm sorry for all the drama)

We were never rich kids, rich kids
Always had a wish list at Christmas
I thought that I was missin' somethin'
And I'm so-so-so sorry, mom, sorry for all the drama
Different, different
I probably should've listened, listened (so sorry, so sorry, so sorry)
I thought that I was missin' somethin'
And I'm so-so-so sorry, mom, I'm sorry for all the drama

And I'm so-so-so sorry, mom, I'm sorry for all the drama (sorry)
And I'm so-so-so sorry, mom, I'm sorry for all the drama
