		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is anti-clean rap
Nigga where the green at?
Risks I take you'd swear I had the balls the size of bean bags
Not what you're used to
Bitch I rep the Bruiser
And the label Fool's Gold
Jeans with Medusas
Bitches wanna scoop us
Get pussy like loofahs
Y'all niggas losers cop clothes from the boosters
Hoes wanna choose up
Of course they gon' choose us
So though you need a stylist also you need a tutor
These stupid-ass niggas wouldn't know what to do
So they copy wack niggas, that's what they makes you
The game's so trendy, that's why these labels fails
'Cause they don't care about music, just first week sales

So they say you need a hit
A chart toppin' single
That's why it's called commercial
Because you need a jingle
A smash crowd banger
Play it all night long
You never get on, without a radio song
So this my radio song
This my radio song

She wanna ride the wave, watch me do my swag surf
Party like a rockstar, never bought a makeup purse
Songs with no feelings, but she feel my thang on her
Stripper with a leaky ceiling, I'ma make it rain on her
Taught me how to Dougie, I'd rather see you jerk
Until it skeet skeet, on the walls and her shirt
She'd rather hear a love song about what she getting
But not from Danny Brown, 'cause bitch I ain't tricking
Do the pretty girl rock, and even though you ugly
Getting dirty money, but bitch I ain't Puffy
Ice cream paint job, semi with the hemi
Heavy duty Chevy, not a Beamer, Benz or Bentley
There's no originality, carbon copy singles
He made Black and Yellow, I'ma make it black and emo
That's why these wack rappers, they never last long
Don't care about music, just radio songs

So they say you need a hit
A chart toppin' single
That's why it's called commercial
Because you need a jingle
A smash crowd banger
Play it all night long
You never get on, without a radio song
So this my radio song
This my radio song
