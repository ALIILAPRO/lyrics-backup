		<p>
		  (Whoa, oh)
(Whoa, oh)

World, slow down
Take a moment to breathe
Enjoy the view, trust the journey
We don't know where it could lead

Gotta put one foot in front of another
There's so much for us to discover
Oh whoa, slow down
Just take a moment to breathe

I got the power, I got the power that you need
No doubt about it, got every reason to believe
Won't try to fight it, can't stop the fire inside of me
I got the power, I got the power

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh
I got the power
Ooh, ooh
I got the power

People, get ready
Don't you give up on love
Hold strong, hold steady
Oh, the best is yet to come

Gotta put one foot in front of another
There's so much for us to discover
Oh whoa, slow down
Hey, come on and sing it with me (hey)

I got the power (ooh), I got the power that you need
No doubt about it (ooh), got every reason to believe
Won't try to fight it (no, no), can't stop the fire inside of me
I got the power (ooh), I got the power

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Whoa, oh (I, I, I)
I got the power (I, I, I)
I got the power (oh)
Whoa, oh (I, I, I)
I got the power

(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
