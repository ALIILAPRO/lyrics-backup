		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We are children of the world, watching every day go by
Changes my life, changes your life, keeps us all anticipating
We are searchers of the truth, every man's a boy deep down
Gotta say it how you mean it, there ain't no easy way

Like a bird in the wind, like a tree in the storm
Like the breath of a child from the moment he's born
To the very last day when the curtains are drawn
We are children of the world, asking every question why
From arrival to survival, just to make it worth the waiting
We are faces in the night, watching every day go by
Changes my life, changes your life, there ain t no easy way

In the back of your mind there is always a mark
There's a wandering solo alone in the dark
You can keep it forever or tear it apart

We are children of the world, watching every day go by
Changing my life, changing your life, keeps us all anticipating

We are children of the world, watching every day go by
Like a bird in the wind, like a tree in the storm
Like the breath of a child from the moment he's born
Till the very last day when the curtains are drawn
We are children of the world, watching every day go by
Changes my life, changes your life, keeps us all anticipating

We are children of the world, watching every day go by
Changes my life, changes your life, keeps us all anticipating
