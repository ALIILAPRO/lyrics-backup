		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And the beat goes on
Just like my love everlasting
And the beat goes on
Still moving strong on and on

Do you ever wonder
That to win, somebody's got to lose
I might as well get over the blues
Just like fishing in the ocean
There'll always be someone new
You did me wrong 'cause I've been through stormy weather

And the beat goes on
Just like my love everlasting
And the beat goes on you'd better believe it
Still moving strong on and on

Don't stop for nobody
This time I'll keep my feet on solid ground
Now I understand myself when I'm down
Like the sweet sound of hip music
There'll always be something new
To keep the tables turning
Hey, this super song
There'll never be an ending

And the beat goes on
Just like my love everlasting
And the beat goes on
Still moving strong on and on 
The beat goes on
The beat goes on

Get down playing that fee, sure the beat is real

The beat goes on

Do you ever wonder
That to win, somebody's got to lose
I might as well get over the blues
Just like fishing in the ocean
There'll always be someone new
You did me wrong 'cause I've been through stormy weather

And the beat goes on
Just like my love everlasting
And the beat goes on 
Still moving strong on and on

And the beat goes on
Just like my love everlasting
And the beat goes on
Just like my love, baby
Just like my love, my love, baby, on and on

And the beat goes on

Don't stop the moving
Don't stop the moving

And the beat goes on
Just like my love everlasting
And the beat goes on
Still moving strong on and on 

And the beat goes on
Just like my love everlasting
And the beat goes on
Still moving strong on and on 

And the beat goes on, just like my love, baby
Just like my love, baby, everlasting
And the beat goes on
Still moving strong and I love you 
The beat goes on
The beat goes on
The beat goes on
The beat goes on

And the beat goes on
Just like my love everlasting
And the beat goes on
Still moving strong 

And the beat goes on
Just like my love everlasting
And the beat goes on
Still moving strong and I love you

And the beat goes on
Just like my love everlasting
And the beat goes on
