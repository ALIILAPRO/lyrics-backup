		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This here is a ReMarquable
So So Def Remix
J.E. y'all
Run-DMC, to the beat y'all (uh)
Ah-ha, ah-ha
And me? Y'all know my name (ha)
Come on

See, first of all (yeah, uh-huh)
I know these so-called players wouldn't tell you this (what?)
But I'ma be real and say what's on my heart (yeah)
Let's take this chance and make this love feel relevant
Didn't you know I loved you from the start (yeah)
When I think about all these years we put in this relationship (yeah)
Who knew we'd make it this far? 
Then I think about where we would I be if we were to just fall apart (and what?)
And I can't stand the thought of losin' you, oh (let's go)

Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't gettin' no younger, we might as well do it (we ain't gettin' no younger, girl) (yeah)
Been feelin' you all the while, girl, I must confess (feelin' you all the while) (come on, girl)
Girl, let's just get married
I just wanna get married
Meet me at the altar in your white dress (meet me at the altar, yeah)
We ain't gettin' no younger, we might as well do it (so we might as well do it, yeah)
Been feelin' you all the while, girl, I must confess (and I must confess) (uh-huh, come on)
Let's just get married (baby, lets get married) (uh-huh, check it out)

Said I done it all (ooh, ooh)
But frankly, girl, I'm tired of this emptiness
I wanna come home to you and only you (why?)
'Cause makin' love to just anyone ain't happenin'
I just gotta be with you (hand clap one time)
Do you think about us finishin' somethin' we started so long ago? 
I wanna give you my all
Do you think about maybe us havin' some babies? (Yeah, oh)
Come on won't you be my lady forever, girl (Kings and Queens) (Yeah, yeah, take it back)

What's going on across the seas?
It ain't nothin', I ain't frontin'
Shorty comin' with me
Now I done already gave you the keys to the Range
And your last name 'bout to change
Now you Mrs. Simmons, got a betta livin'
What a difference Rev-Run made
Used to be the snake type, hangin' out late night
Girl, you made me change my life
Ever since you met me, keys to the Bentley
Now they call you the preacher's wife
I'm the type of guy that, take you out and buy that
Ring with the rock that'll break your arm
Players won't try that, now you can't deny that
Triple dub, Rev to the Run dot com (oh-oh)

Meet me at the altar in your white dress (yeah, yeah)
We ain't gettin' no younger, we might as well do it (we might as well do it)
Been feelin' you all the while, girl, I must confess (yeah) 
Girl, let's just get married
I just wanna get married
Meet me at the altar in your white dress (oh, oh-oh, oh) (ha, even though we slow)
We ain't gettin' no younger, we might as well do it (we ain't gettin' no younger, hey)
(Yeah, I knew we had to dance)
Been feelin' you all the while, girl, I must confess (married, married, married, married)
(It's only right)
Let's just get married (all I want you to do is meet me at the altar, hey)

Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't gettin' no younger, we might as well do it (baby, we ain't gettin' no younger)
(If you twenty-five and older, she gotta turn this up)
Been feelin' you all the while, girl, I must confess 
(Feelin' you, feelin' you, feelin' you all the while, all the while)
(If you eighteen to twenty-one, you gotta turn this off) Girl, let's just get married 
I just wanna get married (yeah, yeah)

Meet me at the altar in your white dress (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We ain't gettin' no younger, we might as well do it (we might as well do it, baby) (woah)
Been feelin' you all the while, girl, I must confess (girl, I must confess) 
(Me and ReMarquable, killin' 'em, killin' em)
Let's get married (let's get married, baby, said let's get married, baby)

Meet me at the altar in your white dress (baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, woah-oh)
We ain't gettin' no younger, we might as well do it 
Been feelin' you all the while, girl, I must confess 
Girl, let's just get married (let's get married, baby)
I just wanna get married (woah-woah-woah, woah)
