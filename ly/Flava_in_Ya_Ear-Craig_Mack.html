		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo, Mack, I don't even understand
How they didn't understand you in that Mary joint
(Yeah, I know, man)
Kick that old robotic, futuristic, George Jetson, crazy joint

Just like Uniblab, robotic kickin' flab
My flavor bidder badder chitter-chatter
Madder than the Mad Hatter
I bet you my shit come out phatter
I got the data to turn your body into anti-matter (body into anti-matter)
And just like a piece of Sizzlean
You'll fit inside my stomach with the eggs and grits between (take 'em down, Mack)
The king is what I mean, I mean
My man get a cup and put some change inside your hand (take 'em down, Mack)
Now, hold up, let's make this official (make it official)
Everybody let's agree that MC's need a tissue (wake 'em up)
The funk's my only issue
I bet your mama miss you
And I bet the Mack take off, like an MX missile
No more of your whinin' on the charts climbin'
As I make the funk kickin' out more harder than a diamond (harder than a diamond)
And if you didn't know who's rhymin'
I guess I'm gonna say, "Craig Mack," with perfect timin'
You won't be around next year
My rap's too severe, kickin' mad flava in ya ear

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear (brand new flava in ya ear)
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

Craig Mack, one thousand degrees
You'll be on your knees, and you'll be burnin', beggin' please
Brother, freeze, this man's undisputed
In deep rooted funk smoke that leaves your brains booted
This bad MC with stamina like Bruce Jenner
The winner, tastin' MC's for dinner
You're crazy like that glue to think that you could outdo 
My one-two that's sick like the flu (shake 'em down, Mack)
Boy, I flip, boy, all the time (ha)
'Cause, boy, the rhyme you kickin' ain't worth a dime
Seems like there's no competition in this rap world expedition
You come around, I'll knock you out position (knock 'em out)
No flav could ever dig a grave, for the Mack
The power pack in black, makin' cement crack (make it crack)
And here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear (here comes the brand new flava in ya ear, boy)
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear (flava, flava)
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear (flava in ya ear, boy)
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

Ha, the Mack's dope with more hope than your Pope
But for MC's more knots than rope
I'd like to break it down, down breakin' forsaken
Lords of MC's shakin' with this track that my man's makin'
MC's will run like a bomb threat
I bet, or better yet, make you sweat (what? huh?)
Gettin' hotter than the sun get (yeah)
Craig Mack is the flav that rocks from here to Tibet (boy)
I break all rules with my action
That the Mack sends to MC's, stop relaxin'
This brand new Sherriff that's in town
Is gettin' down, leavin' bodies buried in the ground
I set up rhymes for a decoy
Now I'm a Bad Boy, watch the MC's I destroy, and

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear (flava in ya ear)
Time for new flava in ya ear (flava)
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear (here comes the Mack)

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear (here comes the flava)
It's time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

Ha, boy
