		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look, uh (Great John on the beat, by the way)
Hold on
Look, uh

You can be my quarantine boo
I'm leavin' when it's finished but right now I need you
Like once I get up in it, I'ma kill it, huh
And she said that she love me but right now I got no feelings
I'm prolly somewhere cookin' like a chemist, huh

Like when we chillin'
I seen it on the 'Gram, I'm tired of all these pictures, huh
She know my body different
The type to slide in from the back while she doin' the dishes
If it's right, if I like, I'ma make you my missus
Know I lied, not the type, girl, you know I'm just kiddin'
Started off with sneaky lickin', now she lovin' it, huh
Know you nasty, open up and let me come in it
Yeah, that's my quarantine queen, huh
Everything shut down, you should pull up on me
Give it to you, then it's back to the streets, huh
You know I won't say a word, we gon' keep it in the sheets, look (look)

You can be my quarantine boo
I'm leavin' when it's finished but right now I need you
Like once I get up in it, I'ma kill it, huh
And she said that she love me but right now I got no feelings
I'm prolly somewhere cookin' like a chemist, huh

Don't get addicted, huh
I know them niggas hate 'cause the way a nigga be drippin', huh
I feel offended, why? 'Cause we can't stay outside
So I'ma need you in the crib like four, five
We can fuck to besty, roll the ZaZa and get more than high
I need your love, but only this time, huh
Only this time, huh, don't think you're mine, huh
Just a quick vibe, it won't be a long ride

You can be my quarantine boo
I'm leavin' when it's finished but right now I need you
Like once I get up in it, I'ma kill it, huh
And she said that she love me but right now I got no feelings
I'm prolly somewhere cookin' like a chemist, huh

Yeah
Prolly somewhere cookin' like a chemist, uh
Yeah, yeah
