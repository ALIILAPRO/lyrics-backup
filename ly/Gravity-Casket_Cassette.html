		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did I wait too long
Have you slipped away
In the vacant song
That the haunting plays
I was just too afraid
Of what I could not name
Trying
To stop all the crying, our tears on the pavement
You're lying
To say we're not dying and we can still save it
I'm trying
I'm trying
Defying
Gravity's rainbow
Band-Aids
Turn to hand grenades
I know that I should've stayed
Can't patch up the mess I've made
Trying
To stop all the crying, our tears on the pavement
You're lying
To say we're not dying and we can still save it
I'm trying
I'm trying
Defying
Gravity's rainbow
