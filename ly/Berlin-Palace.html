		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, fire in my blood
I only said that we could be light
Slow down, this slipstream
You're running off into the night, the night
Oh lord, remember me?
I'm not religious but I'm afraid, afraid

Don't make me count my blessings
You'll make me die confessing
Your touch has cured my weakness
This night don't end, we're sleepless

And you said that you feel
Like you've known me forever, forever
Then she fled, nothing's real
But I need this endeavor, endeavor
So I hold on to these memories
Irreplaceable, oh, I know, I know

Don't make me count my blessings
You'll make me die confessing
Your touch has cured my weakness
This night don't end, we're sleepless

New York savior
Built my faith up
Gave me purpose
Fire like a furnace
