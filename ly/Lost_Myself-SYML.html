		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love is in the actions
Like a brace on a broken knee
Give me time and give me patience
That will be enough for me

Breaking through the clouds feels impossible now, oh
Breaking through the clouds feels impossible now, oh
I think I lost myself
Yeah, I lost myself

I wish I was truly free
Like a bird with no rent to pay
No phone and no last name
Yeah, who I'm meant to be

Breaking through the clouds feels impossible now, oh
Breaking through the clouds feels impossible now, oh
I think I lost myself
Yeah, I lost myself

Breaking through the clouds feels impossible now, oh
Breaking through the clouds feels impossible now, oh
But I found myself walking home
