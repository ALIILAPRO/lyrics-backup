		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I like you when
When you take off your face
Put away all your teeth
And take us way underneath
Cause you could die if you take it alone

I watch you taste it
I see your face
And I know I'm alive
You're shooting stars
From the barrel of your eyes
It drives me crazy
Just drives me wild

I kinda like you when
When you make up the real
Take the phone in your room
Stop the tape always soon
Well you could try if you think it will load

I watch you taste it
I see your face
And I know I'm alive
You're shooting stars
From the barrel of your eyes
It drives me crazy
It drives me wild

Every time
Every time you try
Why
It's a beautiful ride
Why
It's a beautiful ride

I watch you taste it
I see your face
And I know I'm alive
Your shooting stars
From the bottom of your eyes
It drives me crazy
Just drives me wild
