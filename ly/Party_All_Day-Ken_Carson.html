		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) , yeah (yeah)

Yeah back on my bullshit, back on my bull
Shawty eat dick up until she get full
She just wanna get high
She just want some more zoot
She just wanna party all day
She don't work and she don't go to school
She be in the mall all day
Don't buy nothin', she wanna get shoes
She ain't fuckin' with you if
You ain't got loot
When I was broke, I was lookin' at you
Now that I'm rich, I'ma buy her some shoes
I'ma fuck on that bitch and
I give her the boot
Fuck on that bitch and I give her the boot
Fuck on that bitch and I give her the boot
I know these niggas be sweet just likе fruit
Put that boy on the plate and
You know he gеt chewed

Put that boy on that plate and
You know he get chewed
Stealin' my swag, yeah
You know he get swooped
O-P-IU-M, you know that my crew
Niggas mad they ain't gang
You just mad it ain't you
Niggas mad they ain't gang
You just mad it ain't you
Niggas talkin' about us
Ain't nothin' else to do
Say you got them racks, well
I got them racks too
Tryna put 'em on me, I'ma put 'em on you
I'm fuckin' these hoes, they comin' in twos
I ain't got no number, I kept all my juice
Shawty suckin' my dick up like a JUUL
And I dive in your bitch
She my personal pool
She my personal ho, she my garden tool
She can't get it from me so
She get it from you
I can't go out like that, bae, I'm sorry, boo
Know your ex mad he lame and you sorry too

Yeah back on my bullshit, back on my bull
Shawty eat dick up until she get full
She just wanna get high
She just want some more zoot
She just wanna party all day
She don't work and she don't go to school
She be in the mall all day
Don't buy nothin', she wanna get shoes
She ain't fuckin' with you if
You ain't got loot
When I was broke, I was lookin' at you
Now that I'm rich, I'ma buy her some shoes
I'ma fuck on that bitch and
I give her the boot
Fuck on that bitch and I give her the boot
Fuck on that bitch and I give her the boot
I know these niggas be sweet just like fruit
Put that boy on the plate and
You know he get chewed

I just fucked on your bitch
I bought her some boots
No, these Bottega, they not Christian Loubs
How can that boy win? No, how can I lose?
I do what I want, I do what I choose
I got all these racks, you know they all blue
Got hoes in the back like chickens in a coop
If you want smoke, we could do what it do
We can fight, we can shoot
What you wanna get into?
We can fight, we can shoot
What you wanna do?
I fucked his bitch, now he mad, we not cool
Hit from the back, she screamin', "Ooh"
Shawty be wet, she don't need lube
She suckin' me up while I count up my loot
'Cause I'm a real nigga and you a lame dude
Send that bitch to you when she got attitude
And she keep it low-key
She will never tell you

Yeah back on my bullshit, back on my bull
Shawty eat dick up until she get full
She just wanna get high
She just want some more zoot
She just wanna party all day
She don't work and she don't go to school
She be in the mall all day
Don't buy nothin', she wanna get shoes
She ain't fuckin' with you if
You ain't got loot
When I was broke, I was lookin' at you
Now that I'm rich, I'ma buy her some shoes
I'ma fuck on that bitch and
I give her the boot
Fuck on that bitch and I give her the boot
Fuck on that bitch and I give her the boot
I know these niggas be sweet just like fruit
Put that boy on the plate and
You know he get chewed
