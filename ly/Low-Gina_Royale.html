		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Low
Buried in the blankets feel so
Cold
Sheltered from the thought of letting
Go
Paralyzed by the fear
So afraid of losing hope

Cmon now tell me tell me where the wildfires are
Are they near are they far are they living in your heart
Does the love run cold
When you're on the road
Oh

And tell me are the scars on your tongue from lying too much
With each word that you twist does your body wince
Do you feel alone
When the lights get low
Oh

Do you feel low? (Low)
When the lights get low? (Low)
Do you feel low? (Low)
When the lights get low?
Tell me do you feel alone when the lights get

Low
Drowning out the pain losing
control
You and I were built to break
Don't you know
Haunted by the memory
You loved me like a ghost
That won't me let me go

Cmon now tell me tell me where the wildfires are
Are they near are they far are they living in your heart
Do you feel alone
When the lights get low
Oh

Do you feel low? (Low)
When the lights get low? (Low)
Do you feel low? (Low)
When the lights get low?
Tell me do you feel alone when the lights get

Low
I was your escape
You were my biggest mistake
I could never tame
You, the wildfire

Blinded by the flame
Take the oxygen away
Still could never tame
You the wildfire

The wildfire
The wildfire

Cmon now tell me tell me where the wildfires are
Are they near are they far are they living in your heart
Do you feel alone
When the lights get low, low, low
