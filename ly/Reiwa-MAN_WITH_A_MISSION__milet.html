		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Today, I think I found a reason why I stray
If yesterday is a fragment we engrave
Tomorrow has the answer which we crave
Why we crave

Today, we try to face the sun to be the brave
To never lose the joy, we truly pray
And let the sadness softly fade away

I want to see you again even in our reincarnation
Here I am, here I am

Hear the sound, see the world changing
Feel the wind, blooming the living
Reiwa
The dawn is breaking

Hear the sound, join the world singing
Feel the wind, hear the souls ringing
Heiwa
Enlight our future forever and ever

Today, we confess our sins below the moon we gaze
To not forget this oath we finally made
To heal and rise, to make a better change

I want to see you again even in our reincarnation
Here I am, here I am

I want to feel you again and I'll find my salvation
Here I am, here I am (here I am, here I am)

Hear the sound, see the world changing
Feel the wind, blooming the living
Reiwa
The dawn is breaking

Hear the sound, join the world singing
Feel the wind, hear the souls ringing
Heiwa
Enlight our future forever and ever

Hear the sound, see the world changing
Feel the wind, blooming the living
Reiwa
The dawn is breaking

Hear the sound, join the world singing
Feel the wind, hear the souls ringing
Heiwa
Enlight our future forever and ever

Hear the sound, see the world changing (forever)
Hear the sound, join the world singing (and ever)
Forever
