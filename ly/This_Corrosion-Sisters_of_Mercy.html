		  Hey hey hey ye hey now no now now
Hey hey hey ye hey now no now now
Hey hey hey ye hey now no now now

Gimme the ring, kissed and told
Gimme something that I missed (gimme the ring)
A hand to hold, wild and what it seems (gimme the ring)
Kill the king with love is the law
And then we'll turn round (gimme the ring)
Gimme dream child
And do you hear me call? (Gimme the ring)
On the loan and on the level
Still on the floor (gimme the ring)
Sing dream child
And do you hear at all?

(Sing)
(Sing)

Hey now, hey now now, sing this corrosion to me
Hey now, hey now now, sing this corrosion to me
Hey now, hey now now, sing this corrosion to me

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

Ooh ooh ooh (hey hey)

Hey now, hey now now now
Hey hey hey ye hey now no now now
Hey hey hey ye hey now no now now
Gimme siren, child and do you hear me?
Gimme siren, child, and do you hear me call?
Sing, child, of right and wrong
Gimme things that don't last long
Gimme siren, child, and do you hear me call?

(Sing)
(Sing)

Hey now, hey now now, sing this corrosion to me
Hey now, hey now now, sing this corrosion to me
Hey now, hey now now, sing this corrosion to me
Hey now, hey now now

On days like this
In times like these
I feel an animal deep inside
Heel to haunch on bended knees
Living on if and if I tried
Somebody send me please
Dream wars and a ticket to seem
Giving out and in
Selling the don't belong
Well, what do you say
D'you have a word for giving away?
Got a song for me?

(Sing)
(Sing)

Hey now, hey now now, sing this corrosion to me
Hey now, hey now now, sing this corrosion to me
Hey now, hey now now, sing this corrosion to me
Hey now, hey now now, sing

Hey now, hey now now, sing this corrosion to me
Hey now, hey now now, sing this corrosion to me
Hey now, hey now now, sing this corrosion to me
Hey now, hey now now

I got nothing to say I ain't said before
I bled all I can, I won't bleed no more
I don't need no one to understand
Why the blood run hold
The hired hand
On heart
Hand of god
Flood land and driven apart
Run cold (hey now, hey now now)
Turn
Cold, burn like a healing hand

Hey now, hey now now, sing this corrosion to me (like a healing hand)
Hey now, hey now now, sing this corrosion to me (like a healing hand)
Hey now, hey now now, sing this corrosion to me (like a healing hand)
Hey now, hey now now (like a healing hand)

Hey now, hey now now, sing this corrosion to me (like a healing hand)
Hey now, hey now now, sing this corrosion to me (like a healing hand)
Hey now, hey now now, sing this corrosion to me (like a healing hand)
Hey now, hey now now (like a healing hand)

Hey now, hey now now, sing this corrosion to me (like a healing hand)
Hey now, hey now now, sing this corrosion to me (like a healing hand)
Hey now, hey now now, sing this corrosion to me (like a healing hand)
Hey now, hey now now (like a healing hand)

Hey now, hey now now, sing this corrosion to me (like a healing hand)
Hey now, hey now now, sing this corrosion to me (like a healing hand)
Hey now, hey now now, sing this corrosion to me (like a healing hand)
Hey now, hey now now (like a healing hand)

Hey now, hey now now, sing this corrosion to me (like a healing hand)
Hey now, hey now now, sing this corrosion to me (like a healing hand)
Hey now, hey now now, sing this corrosion to me (like a healing hand)

Hey now, hey now now, sing this corrosion to me (like a healing hand)
