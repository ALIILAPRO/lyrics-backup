		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say I waste my life away
But I live it to the full
And how would you know anyway?
You're just mister dull
Why don't you get into the things we do today
You could lose twenty years right away
So we say

We don't need no, no, no, no
Parental guidance here
We don't need no, no, no, no
Parental guidance here

Every day you scream at me to turn the music low
Well if you keep on screaming
You'll make me deaf you know
You always chew me out because I stay out late
Until your three-piece suit comes back in date
Get one thing straight

We don't need no, no, no, no
Parental guidance here
We don't need no, no, no, no
Parental guidance here

There's no communication
I'm tired of explanation
Is this message getting through?
You went through the same thing too

Don't you remember what it's like to lose control?
Put on my jacket before you get too old
Let's rock n' roll

We don't need no, no, no, no
Parental guidance here
We don't need no, no, no, no
Parental guidance here

We don't need no, no, no, no
Parental guidance here
We don't need no, no, no, no
Parental guidance here

Oh no
One life
And I'm gonna live it up
