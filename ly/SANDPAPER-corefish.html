		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fake my life
Take a little time to get on your Good side
I just wanna die every day I'm Alive
Busy writing rhymes terrified
Put the key in ignition
Since you broke my heart I'm a Man on a mission
And I lost my start in a dugout, A ditch
So don't play my card, mild mannered militia
So go slay your part, put your Hand on his riches
So take my life and put your Hands up on the table
It's high tide to feel severed From the cable
The tether wasn't able to hold
I'll settle in with solace on the Road
Waste my life while I'm stuck in A shit hole
Make another beat think I'll Solve all the riddles but in truth
Call it how I see and then lose
Dancin' with the devil think he Laying on the fiddle (Agh)
Don't know what to say think I'm Malcom in the middle with The juice
But I feel just like Dewey
What the fuck is this shit, Think my life is a movie (Ugh)
Fake my life
Take a little time to get on your Good side
I just wanna die every day I'm Alive
Busy writing rhymes terrified
Put the key in ignition
Since you broke my heart I'm a Man on a mission
And I lost my start in a dugout, A ditch
So don't play my card, mild mannered militia
So go play your part, put your Hand on his riches bitch
Basic, she know, she can't do Shit without me
Pace through the road till I'm Crumbling down
God she shot me with a beam
Shawty was a demon
Thought I wasn't but I'm really Dreaming
Playing through the seasons
I don't wanna be here
But it's fine maybe we could try Next year
Knew the perc was fake but I Still ate it, I been fiending
Walk inside the party with the Molly get to screaming
Dance around the lobby on a Dolly till I feel it
They tryna make me feel ways
But I don't wanna feel it
Trapped in my home with Nobody surrounding me
We could all get along if you Give me a remedy
Fake my life
Take a little time to get on your Good side
I just wanna die every day I'm alive
Busy writing rhymes terrified
Put the key in ignition
Since you broke my heart I'm a Man on a mission
And I lost my start in a dugout, A ditch
So don't play my card, mild Mannered militia
So go play your part, put your Hand on his riches bitch
(B-b-b-bitch)
I only listen to people who are younger than me
These are the only people with ideas
You cannot give me any advice
I have the ideas!
Nobody older than me, has the
Take my life and put your Hands up on the table
It's high tide to feel severed From the cable
The tether wasn't able to hold
I'll settle in with solace on the Road
