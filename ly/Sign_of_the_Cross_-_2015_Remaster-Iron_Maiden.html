		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eleven saintly shrouded men 
Silhouettes stand against the sky 
One in front with a cross held high 
Come to wash my sins away 

Standing alone in the wind and rain 
Feeling the fear that is growing 
Sensing the change in the tide again 
Caught by the storm that is brewing 
Feel the anxiety hold off the fear 
Some of the doubt in the things you believe 
Now that your faith will be put to the test 
Nothing to do but await what is coming 

Why then is God still protecting me 
Even when I don't deserve it 
Thought I am blessed with an inner strength 
Some they would call it a penance 
Why am I meant to face this alone 
Asking the question time and again 
Praying to God won't keep me alive 
Inside my head feel the fear start to rise

They'll be saying their prayers when the moment comes 
There'll be penance to pay when it's judgment day 
And the guilty'll bleed when the moment comes 
They'll be coming to claim
Take your soul away 

The sign of the cross 
The name of the rose 
A fire in the sky 
The sign of the cross 

They'll be coming to bring the eternal flame 
They'll be bringing us all immortality 
Holding communion so the world be blessed 
My creator my God, lay my soul to rest 

The sign of the cross 
The name of the rose 
A fire in the sky 
The sign of the cross, yeah

The sign of the cross 
The name of the rose 
A fire in the sky 
The sign of the cross 

The name of the rose 
The sign of the cross 

Lost the love of heaven above 
Chose the lust of the earth below 
Eleven saintly shrouded men 
Came to wash my sins away
