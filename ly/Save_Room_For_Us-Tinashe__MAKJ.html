		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heart goes numb
When the days turn to weeks
Only blank shadows
Of the way we used to be

All these times zones between us 
Have grown, oh, they've grown
But these nights don't get easier
When I see ya with her

Just save room for us
Just save room for us, somewhere
Just save room for us, I just
You'll come back for us, someday

Oh, you know it's not the end
We'll fall in love again
'Cause we were built in dreams of gold
Just save room for us
And it may not be today
True love will find a way
Just save a space for me
Oh, whoa

And I know you've moved on
She will never love you
Oh, the way that I do
Now I'm dancing solo
Slowly disappearing
It still hurts when I see you with her

Just save room for us
Just save room for us, somewhere
Just save room for us, I just
You'll come back for us, someday
Just save room for us

And I know you've moved on
She will never love you
Oh, the way that I do
Now I'm dancing solo (solo)
Slowly disappearing
It still hurts when I see you with her

Just save room for us
I know you feel it 
Somewhere, somewhere
Just save room for us, I just
(I know you feel it) you'll come back for us
(Somewhere, somewhere) someday
Just save room for us

You know it's not the end
We'll fall in love again
'Cause we were built in dreams of gold
Just save room for us
And it may not be today (I know you feel it)
True love will find a way (somewhere) 
Just save a space for me (somewhere)
Just save room for us

I know you feel it somewhere, somewhere
