		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One shot heard around the world
Gonna bring it to a head
Gonna show the world what it was
Once said
Whatever the cost
We will never surrender
Leave abandoned the loss
When the rich wage war
And the patriotic whores
Dig their own grave
For their own sake
Another casualty
Another travesty
Another motherfucking German shepherd
Growling with his teeth steppin
Bitch slappin smack rappin
Kick you in the bass drum BOOM Boom
Alpha to Zulu
I'm here to say FUCK YOU
I had a bad day
With her angel wings

I had a bad day
With her angel wings
I had a bad day
With her angel wings
I had a bad day
With her angel wings

Fall in line glorify
Patriotic parasite
Punishment don't fit the crime of
Being bred to lead to slaughter

One shot heard around the world
Gonna bring it to a head
Gonna show the world that it was
Once said
Whatever the cost
We will never surrender
Leave abandoned the loss
When the rich wage war
And the patriotic whores
Dig their own grave
For their own sake
Another casualty
Another travesty
Another motherfucking German shepherd
Growling with his teeth steppin
Bitch slappin smack rappin
Kick you in the bass drum BOOM Boom
Alpha to Zulu
I'm here to say FUCK YOU
I had a bad day

Fall in line glorify
Patriotic parasite
Punishment don't fit the crime of
Being bred to lead to slaughter

One shot heard around the world
Gonna bring it to a head
Gonna show the world what it was
Once said
Whatever the cost
We will never surrender
Leave abandoned the loss
When the rich wage war
And the patriotic whores
Dig their own grave
For their own sake
Another casualty
Another travesty
Another motherfucking German shepherd
Growling with his teeth steppin
Bitch slappin smack rappin
Kick you in the bass drum BOOM Boom
Alpha to Zulu
I'm here to say FUCK YOU
I had a bad day
With her angel wings
I had a bad day
With her angel wings
I had a bad day
With her angel wings
I had a bad day
With her angel wings
