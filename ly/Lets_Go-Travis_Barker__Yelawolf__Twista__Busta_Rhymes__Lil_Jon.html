		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Travis Barker, yeah! Le-Le-Let's go! Lil' Jon, Yelawolf!
Le-Le-Let's go! Twista and my homeboy Busta Rhymes!
Holla at 'em!

Before I
Take another minute just to give everybody a movie never seen
I hit 'em with another elbow
Let me get up everybody that be moving with The Conglomerate
On your marks, are you ready? Let's go
Wow! OK, here we go again you see the way I'm blowin'
And I'm like a mangler the way I be manglin' the beat
They call me Dracula then you see the fangs goin' in
Wow! Uh huh, everybody know that I'mma come and I'mma go
Then I gotta do what I be coming in to do it
Embody the beat, they love the way we givin' 'em a show
Keys to the ignition and step on the gas
And bust a bottle and pour me shot in my glass
Where we at? Where we at? Where we at?
And we back up in the building and we coming with a scorcher
Y'all already know who it is, it's Busta Bust and Travis Barker
Back to the beat, see we gotta go
Hit you with the fire trucks, everybody better know
That we 'bout to let it blow and we gotta get it yo
Everybody if you're really with me
(Let's go)

Hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Ha hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Ha hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Ha hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

I already spit it to the rhythm of the piano
So now I gotta give the drummer some
Put the T up on the track, I be phenomenal
'Cause when it come to havin' a hit I'mma make another one
Blink 182 times when you see the Twista with Travis, madness
Kind of like a savage, ravager
Murder with the art like blood on the canvas and it's
Kind of impeccable how I can spit it and get up
In the middle with intricate patterns of a kick drum
Diabolical, the lyrical flow that'll swallow you
Theoretical thinking that you can get some
I'mma hit 'em with the Lamborghini flow with the speed of a Bugatti
I'm from another planet when I spit a verse
With the weed in my body, and I'mma
Hurt 'em every time I get up in the booth
Sipping on the liquor, 182 proof
Now they wanna say they should've never let me loose
Out of the cage, now come and see what I'mma do
It's Twista the Jason of rap on the track
And I hit you with the Midwest flow
Even if you ain't ready yet, all I gotta say is ready, set, let's go

Hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Ha hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Ha hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Ha hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

Drive by, hit you with the two piece combo
While I'm hangin' out the window of your Daddy's Lambo
Scrambled eggs, I got scrambled ammo
Leave you on top of the water like a banana boat
Yeah, I'm an animal, everybody's edible and Yelawolf
Is headed for your arm and hand and your, head, I'm a cannibal
Good heavens, the man's hoppin' over the fence like a fucking antelope
So, send it to me in a minute when you finish and I'll put him in a vice grip
I put an end to the image and
I'll send it to them via independent fucker with the mic grille
I might scare bam
Pull the trigger back in a submarine with submachine loaded
In an ocean, hot deep
Deep enough to leave the submarine imploded
Promenade motherfucker, vamonos
It's me and I'm sick of the pro-gnosis
Got more bars than Barney Fife
And I'll put you behind them like howdy Opie
I can make your mamma really proud to know me
And your broke daddy is down to loan me
Give me fifty bucks in penny rolls just to be in one of my videos
Yeah homie, let's go

Hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Ha hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Ha hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Ha hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Ha hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Ha hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Ha hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
