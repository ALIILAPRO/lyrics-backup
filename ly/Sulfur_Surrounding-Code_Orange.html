		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's take a good look at you

You wanna see it through my eyes
So I'm coming through
But I've never seen a ground so hollow
Haunted by a chemical compulsion
When I know that there are options
I wanna see it through God's eye
But hate brews in me so easy

I know you want it
You're glued to me so easy
Sulfur surrounding
It puts you away

I had to see it through your eyes
So I'm coming back
To corrode the chords
Communicate the feeling
You wanna see it through my eyes
But your body is blue
It shouldn't be so easy

I know you want it
You're glued to me so easy
Sulfur surrounding
It drags you through hell

You wanna see it through God's eyes
So I'm coming
You wanna see it through God's eye
So I'm coming

Take me over
Take me over
Take me
Take me

I know you want it
You're glued to me so
I know you want it
You're glued to me so easy
But now you've got it
It proved to be so easy
Sulfur surrounding
Surrounding
Surrounding me

Sulfur surrounding
It puts you away

There's nowhere to run
