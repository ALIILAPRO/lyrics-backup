		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm pretty sure as far as humans go
I am a hard, hard pill to swallow
And I know I'm not your intended dose
We're going low, low, low, low

So roll the highlights
Got too high life
Mix the
Low, low, low lights with the
Low, low, lowlifes

On the bright side
Got the wrong insides
Mix the
Low, low, low lights with the
Low, lowlifes

I spent
Ten years, ten years in a bit of chemical haze
And I miss the way that I felt
Nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing

Passed my old street, the house I grew up in
It breaks your heart but four of the Ramones are dead
I felt you at the beginning but needed you at the end
We're going low, low, low, low

So roll the highlights
Got too high life
Mix the
Low, low, low lights with the
Low, low, lowlifes

On the bright side
Got the wrong insides
Mix the
Low, low, low lights with the
Low, lowlifes

I spent
Ten years, ten years in a bit of chemical haze
And I miss the way that I felt
Nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing

Stop me if you have heard this all before
Too many times after too much alcohol
Oh-oh, but you don't know me anymore
We're going low, low, low, low

I spent
Ten years, ten years in a bit of chemical haze
And I miss the way that I felt

Ten years, ten years in a bit of chemical haze
And I miss the way that I felt
Nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing
