		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There are some things
You wouldn't get
Thoughts that sing
Inside of my head
I'll just hide it
I think it's better
To just mask it
When I'm with you
I'm okay
I'm okay
These are the words
That I try to say
I'm okay
I'm okay
Deep inside
I hate the burden
To stay
You'll see me try
To overwork
It's for me to fly
And not be a jerk
I'm so sorry
I apologize
If my mood changes
And I don't realize
I'm okay
I'm okay
These are the words
That I try to say
I'm okay
I'm okay
Deep inside
I hate the burden
To stay
I'm okay
I'm okay
Is this the state
That I am in
I'm okay
I'm okay
Maybe I can
Handle it myself
Please be near
Please stay here
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone
But I don't wanna be
Your responsibility
Maybe I can handle it myself
I'm okay
I'm okay
These are the words
That I try to say
I'm okay
I'm okay
Maybe I can
Handle it myself
