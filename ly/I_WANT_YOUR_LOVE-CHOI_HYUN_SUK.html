		  (TREASURE)
I wanna know you 
Ooh 넌 나의 fantasy
꿈속에 deja vu
Let me crazy 불처럼 타고 싶어
너에게만 말해 to you

My heart is going bomb 내 심장은 춤을 춰
Popping, popping, hit this drum
You're my rhythm, ah, yeah
살며시 눈을 깜빡이면 없어져 깜짝
날 정말 미치게 만들어 baby

Whoa, I just wanna know if you feel it too
너도 나와 같다면 show me your proof
말해줘 yes or no, I can't take control
나 좀 숨 쉬게 해줘

I want your love (yeah)
Yeah, want your, want your love
Don't kill my vibe (yeah)
I'm never gonna stop
I want your love (yeah)
Yeah, want your, want your love
Oh my, oh my (yeah)
You're gonna be the one

(Hey, babe) I want you, what about you?
Zoom, zoom 스며들어 너라는 숲 ooh-ooh
Give it to me utopia 난 born again-gain-gain
내 심장 쿵쿵 bounce 난리 났어 like party rock
어둠뿐이던 내 삶에 빛이 확 'cause of you

이 밤은 아름다워 we got no problem
걱정 따윈 burn it, just tell me true
세상은 우릴 원해 'cause we got something
이 밤의 주인공은 just me and you

Whoa, I just wanna know if you feel it too
너도 나와 같다면 show me your proof
말해줘 yes or no, I can't take control
나 좀 숨 쉬게 해줘

I want your love (yeah)
Yeah, want your, want your love
Don't kill my vibe (yeah)
I'm never gonna stop
I want your love (yeah)
Yeah, want your, want your love
Oh my, oh my (yeah)
You're gonna be the one

You stuck in my mind (you and me 난 느낌, 느낌와)
And I can't get you out (거침없이 넌 미쳐버려 like, let's go)
뜨거워지잖아 (you and me 난 느낌, 느낌와)
넌 날 애태우니까 yeah (거침없이 넌 미쳐버려 like)

I just wanna hold you wanna party
Tell me do you wanna feel my body
You give me the sweetest sound
And you don't need to look around
We can do whatever you want

I just wanna hold you wanna party
Tell me do you wanna feel my body
You give me the sweetest sound
And you don't need to look around
We can do whatever you want
