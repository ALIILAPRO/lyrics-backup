		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got my sights set on you and I'm ready to aim
I have a heart that will never be tamed
I knew you were something special when you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again

I've got a way of knowing when something is right
I feel like I must've known you in another life (ooh)
'Cause I felt this deep connection when you looked in my eyes (I can't wait)
Now I can't wait to see you again

The last time I freaked out
I just kept looking down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh woah woah, I, I can't wait to see you again

I got this crazy feelin' deep inside
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader but I'm reading the sign (that you can't wait)
That you can't wait to see me again

The last time I freaked out
I just kept looking down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh woah woah, I, I can't wait to see you again

I got my sights set on you and I'm ready to aim

The last time I freaked out
I just kept looking down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh woah woah, I, I can't wait to see you again (see you again, see you again)
Oh woah woah, I, I can't wait to see you again
