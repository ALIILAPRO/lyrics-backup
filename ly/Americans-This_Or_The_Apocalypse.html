		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I appeared out of the dark after your father passed
I stood and took the place of all that emptiness
You said that you never thought god existed
But someone had to answer
To coincidences
So we'll just play it safe
And we'll forget that we ever had any questions
I said I'd give you everything I had
When I had nothing left
But I might just bring you down
I went from filling to becoming all that emptiness
That I saw inside you
And I would stay if I could just learn to shut my mouth
Cause everything I said just makes it so much worse
I work my hands down the bone
So everything I touch just feels like stone
Well, yeah, I sold myself short
You don't need me
No one does

Because I'm nothing to no one
I'm no one

I don't care if I make it
I'm stranded
I'm nowhere
I'm straight up sinking
I'm not letting anyone bother trying to patch these leaks
There's nothing to hold
Nothing to keep

My ship has sailed

I got stranded before the storm took over
There's only one way out
I was so tempted to give in a head for clearer weather
There's only one way out
And it's the hardest one to take

Because I'm nothing to no one
I'm no one

I don't care if I make it
I'm stranded
I'm nowhere
I'm straight up sinking
I'm not letting anyone bother trying to patch these leaks
There's nothing to hold
There's nothing to keep

And I prayed every single night before I slept
And now there's just no one to talk to.
