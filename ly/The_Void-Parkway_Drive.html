		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nothing can save us, nothing between
Infinite madness and the spiral of humanity
Nothing controls us, nothing breeds
The void awakens in the quickening of atrophy

Answer no master, never the slave
Carry your dreams down into the grave
Every heart, like every soul, equal to break

It's alive, can you feel it taking hold again?
In your mind, all your demons are rattling chains
Welcome to a world of pain

Nothing kills us, nothing seethes
Extinction riding on the pale horse of destiny
Nothing hates us, nothing can see
Through our eyes, it dives into our minds and sows its disease

Answer no master, never the slave
Carry your dreams down into the grave
Every heart, like every soul, equal to break

It's alive, can you feel it taking hold again?
In your mind, all your demons are rattling chains
Welcome to a world of pain

It's alive, can you feel it taking hold again?
In your mind, all your demons are rattling chains
It's alive, can you feel it?
In your mind, all your demons are rattling chains
Welcome to a world
Welcome to a world of pain
