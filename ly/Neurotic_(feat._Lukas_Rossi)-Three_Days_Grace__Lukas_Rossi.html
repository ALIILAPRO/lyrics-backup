		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't get down from this high 
Somebody check my vital signs
'Cause I'm in trouble this time 
I'm in trouble this time, I'm in trouble
I gotta run for my life before I'm buried alive 
I don't wanna die
Yeah, I'm in trouble this time
I need a lifeline, I'm in trouble

I'm barely breathing
I need some kind of healing
I'm feeling neurotic
But there's a little in all of us
Some say I'm neurotic
I'm addicted to all of it
I'm barely breathing
I need some kind of healing
I'm feeling neurotic

On a one way trip 
There's no way to get out of it
Am I dead or alive? 
It's such a fine line, such a fine line
(It's like the devil's inside)
It's like the devil's inside 
It's like the devil's inside
It's like the devil's

Keeping me from breathing
I need some kind of healing
I'm feeling neurotic
But there's a little in all of us
Some say I'm neurotic
I'm addicted to all of it
I'm barely breathing
I need some kind of healing
I'm feeling neurotic

And I swear I never saw it coming
I always thought I could keep outrunning
My demons, I didn't believe them but they're
Catching up to me

I can't get down from this high 
Somebody check my vital signs

I'm feeling neurotic
But there's a little in all of us 
(And I swear I never saw it coming)
Some say I'm neurotic
I'm addicted to all of it 
(And I swear I never saw it coming)
I'm barely breathing
I need some kind of healing

Neurotic
I think the devil's inside 
I think the devil's inside
I think the devil
I'm barely breathing
I think I'm losing my mind 
It's such a fine line
It's such a fine line
