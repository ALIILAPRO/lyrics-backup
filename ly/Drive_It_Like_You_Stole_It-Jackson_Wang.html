		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  the cigarettes fill my lungs
Alcohol in the room
A girl in a red dress sees me
A girl in a red dress swoons
and I'm not done tonight
and what do you make of it?
and I got a little red Corvette 
parked outside with your name on it

Cigarettes fill your lungs
and this place is getting slow
Don't look like you need someone to love
But look like you need somewhere to go
I'm looking for a time
Throw you the keys, said hold 'em
Girl, if I let you drive it

You better drive it like you stole it
(You better drive it like you stole it, yeah)
You better drive it like you stole it
(You better drive it like it's stolen, babe)

Cigarettes in my lungs
Alcohol in a cup
I took it for the road
I hadn't had enough (yeah)
A girl in a red dress driving
She was my type of startet
We're in the little red Corvette 
parked outside with her name on it

Cigarettes fill your lungs
You've got trophies on your shelf
So what, you've got a reputation?
At least you made one for yourself
And I'm looking for a time
You've got the keys, don't blow it
But, girl, if I let you drive

You better drive it like you stole it
(You better drive it like you stole it, yeah)
You better drive it like you stole it
(You better drive it like it's stolen, babe)

You better drive it like you stole it
(You better drive it like you stole it, yeah)
You better drive it like you stole it
(You better drive it like it's stolen, babe)

Feeling the rush, we switch lanes
Feeling your love, so I stay
Heart beats faster
You keep going

You better drive it like you stole it
(You better drive it like you stole it, yeah)
You better drive it like you stole it
(You better drive it like it's stolen, babe)

You better drive it like you stole it
(You better drive it like you stole it, yeah) yeah
You better drive it like you stole it
(You better drive it like it's stolen, babe)
