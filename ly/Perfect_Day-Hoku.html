		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sun's up, it's a little after twelve
Make breakfast for myself
Leave the work for someone else
People say, they say that it's just a phase
They tell me to act my age
Well, I am

On this perfect day
Nothing's standing in my way
On this perfect day
Where nothing can go wrong
It's the perfect day
Tomorrow's gonna come too soon
I could stay forever as I am
On this perfect day

Sun's down, a little after ten
I pick up all my friends in my Mercedes Benz
Wake up! Don't tell me it's just a dream
'Cause when I've had enough you'll hear me say
Now don't you try to rain on my

Perfect day
Nothing's standing in my way
On this perfect day
Where nothing can go wrong
It's the perfect day
Tomorrow's gonna come too soon
I could stay forever as I am
On this perfect day (ow!)

I'm in the race but I already won
And getting there can be half the fun
So don't stop me 'til I'm good and done
Don't you try to rain on my

Perfect day (perfect day)
It's the perfect day

It's the perfect day
Nothing's gonna bring me down
I could stay forever as I am
On this perfect day
Nothing's standing in my way
On this perfect day
Nothing can go wrong (on this perfect day)

I'm in the race but I've already won
And getting there can be half the fun
So don't stop me 'til I'm good and done
Don't you try to rain on my perfect day
On this perfect day
On this perfect day
