		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We used to play out in the rain
Your mama scolded us
She said that we were bad
I thought I'd better go on home
You watched till I was gone
Oh girl you looked so sad
Can you remember the rain?
Can you remember the rain?
Can you remember the rain?
Can you remember the rain?
I picked you up when you fell and cut your knee
I told you not to cry and held you close to me
You left me for somebody else
Now I must face life by myself
Can you remember the rain?
Can you remember the rain?
Oh baby baby baby baby
Baby baby baby baby
Baby baby baby baby
