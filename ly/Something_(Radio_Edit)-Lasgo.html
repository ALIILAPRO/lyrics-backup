		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna say I'm sorry
'Cause I know there is nothing wrong
Don't be afraid, there is no need to worry
'Cause my feelings for you are still strong

Hold me in your arms
And never let me go
Hold me in your arms
'Cause I need you so

I can see it in your eyes
There is something
Something you wanna tell me
I see it in your eyes
There is something
That you have for me
Is there a reason why?
There is something
Something you wanna tell me
I see it in your eyes
There is something
That you have for me

I don't wanna say I'm sorry
'Cause I know there is nothing wrong
Don't be afraid, there is no need to worry
'Cause my feelings for you are still strong

Hold me in your arms
And never let me go
Hold me in your arms
'Cause I need you so

I can see it in your eyes
There is something
Something you wanna tell me
I see it in your eyes
There is something
That you have for me
Is there a reason why?
There is something
Something you wanna tell me
I see it in your eyes
There is something
That you have for me
