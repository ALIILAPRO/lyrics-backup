		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take a breath
Hold it in
Start a fight
You won't win
Had enough
Let's begin
Never mind
I don't care

All in all
You're no good
You don't cry
Like you should
Let it go
If you could
When love dies in the end

So I'll find what lies beneath
Your sick twisted smile
As I lay underneath
Your cold jaded eyes
Now you turn the tide on me
'Cause you're so unkind
I will always be here
For the rest of my life

Here we go
Does it hurt
Say goodbye
To this world
I will not
Be undone
Come to life
It gets worse

All in all
You're no good
You don't cry
Like you should
I'll be gone
When you fall
Your sad life
Says it all

So I'll find what lies beneath
Your sick twisted smile
As I lay underneath
Your cold jaded eyes
Now you turn the tide on me
'Cause you're so unkind
I will always be here
For the rest of my life

Don't carry me under
You're the Devil in disguise
God sing for the hopeless
I'm the one you left behind

So I'll find what lies beneath
Your sick twisted smile
As I lay underneath
Your cold jaded eyed
Now you turn the tide on me
'Cause you're so unkind
I will always be here
For the rest of my life
