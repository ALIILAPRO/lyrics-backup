		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is my private life 
I have no friends to fear 
I've got no problems no cross to bear 
If you can find me 
Come and get me out of here 

This is my private life 
This is my private life 
This is my private life

These are my private things 
There they are against the wall 
The dirty pictures, religious objects 
These are my private things 
Come and get them out of here 

This is my private bed 
This is where I lie at night 
Staring at a light bulb hanging on the ceiling 
Waiting for a dream to 
Come and get me out of here 

Here in my humble room at night 
I often wonder what goes on out there 
What makes them runs o scared 
I often stare at the people passing by 
But they can't see me through my window shades 
Just like I'm not even there 

This is my private life 
This is my private life 
This is my private life 
There's something dangerous I like 

This is my private life 
I know my problems aren't your fault 
What I really want to know 
Has it always been this way 

This is my private life 
This is my private life 
This is my private life 
Come and get me out of here
