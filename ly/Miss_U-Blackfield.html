		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They said you're in love again
And I tried to hide my pain
I was buried in my bed
With your pictures in my head

You were living another life
It cuts me like a knife
I hope you understand
I'm the one who's left behind

Tomorrow you'll be gone
And I'll miss you
Yeah, I'll miss you
Yeah, I'll miss you

They said you're in love again
And my eyes start to burn
Wherever you are now
I wish you could hear my silent sigh

It's not that I try to blame
It's just kind of a rainy day
I hope you understand
I'm the one who's left behind
