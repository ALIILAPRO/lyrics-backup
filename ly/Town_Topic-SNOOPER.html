		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Operator 
Takes your call 
For free 
 
There's a delay 
In what 
You say 
 
Mix up your words 
Cause they can't 
Hear you 
 
Town topic and 
You are.. it 
 
Operator 
Makes the call 
For you
 
Hard to connect
Rumors 
Infect
 
Privacy breech 
Want to pull 
Your teeth 
 
Town topic and 
You are.. it 
 
It's a disease 
Starts in your ear 
Something you hear 
Causes unease
Spreads to your mind 
Makes you go blind 
Town topic
And you are it  
 
Operator 
Takes your call 
For free 
 
There's a delay 
In what 
You say 
 
Mix up your words 
Cause they can't 
Hear you 
 
Town topic and 
You're.. it 
 
Operator 
Makes the call 
For you
 
Hard to connect
Rumors 
Infect
 
Privacy breech 
Want to pull 
Your teeth 
 
Town topic and 
You're.. it 
 
It's a disease 
Starts in your ear 
Something you hear 
Causes unease
Spreads to your mind 
Makes you go blind 
Town topic
And you are it  
----------------------------------
It's a disease 
Starts in your ear 
Something you hear 
Causes unease
Spreads to your mind 
Makes you go blind 
Town topic
And you are it
