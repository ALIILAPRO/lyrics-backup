		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Took you out Monday Cause I hate my life On Tuesday you felt feelings I ain’t ask for On Wednesday you felt promise But by Friday you’ll forget If you don’t hit me 'til next Monday Then I’ll drink until I’m dead Say you don’t love me? I don’t love me either Say you don’t trust me? I don’t trust me either All the lies you went and fed to me Don’t mean shit cause I’m drinking bottom shelf But I still hate you more than I hate myself I’ll tell your mom I love her Tell your dad that I’m gonna miss him more Won’t be around no more Cause your daughters a whore I’m sorry that I let you down But she ain’t even try I write these words in blood She’s my 13th reason why You say you don’t love me? I don’t love me either Say you don’t trust me? I don’t trust me either All the lies you went and fed to me Don’t mean shit cause I’m drinking bottom shelf But I still hate you more than I hate myself So run, run Fast as I can Pumped up kicks wit a gun in my hand Run, run Fast as you can Run for the hills Fuck all your friends You say you don’t love me? I don’t love me either Say you don’t trust me? Babe I’m in a drunken fever All the lies you went and fed to me Don’t mean shit cause I’m drinking bottom shelf But I still hate you more than I hate myself
