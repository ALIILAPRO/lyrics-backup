		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tepid waves
Of trepidation covering me
As if to provide
A moment of clarity

What lies ahead
Is it another unfolding travesty again?
I'm searching for substance
But I don't even fit into my own skin

You spoke of a world full of purpose
As I choked down every single lie
'Til I sank all the way to the bottom
With a heavy heart like an anchor deep inside

And it's dragging me down
Down
Down
Down

You state your case
But the words fall like broken mirrors
And shifting the blame
Won't provide another place to hide

What lies ahead
Is it another misguided, sad, and failed attempt?
I'm searching for anything
But I haven't even seen the sun in days

You spoke of a world full of purpose
As I choked down every single lie
'Til I sank all the way to the bottom
With a heavy heart like an anchor deep inside

You spoke of a world full of purpose
As I choked down every single lie
'Til I sank all the way to the bottom
With a heavy heart like an anchor deep inside

And it's dragging me down
Down
Down
Down
