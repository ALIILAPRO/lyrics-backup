		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're an ocean and I'm just 
That dream in your head
I'm screaming, "I love you" 
But you see me as a friend
You're an ocean and I'm just 
That cigarette
And I don't wanna see what's
What's real in the end

Oh, you dream instead
Oh, you dream instead
I dream instead

You're an ocean and I'm just 
A silhouette
And the higher that I was 
I left things unchanged

You're an ocean and I'm just 
That cigarette
And I don't wanna see what's 
What's real in the end

Oh, you dream instead
Oh, you dream instead
I dream instead

And we don't wanna see what's 
What's real in the end
What's real in the end
And we don't wanna see what's

Oh, you dream instead
Oh, you dream instead
I dream instead
Oh, you dream instead
