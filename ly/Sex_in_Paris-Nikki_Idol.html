		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dear lady, touch me and call me your fool yeah
You say it's lust while I teach you the rules yeah
Angel or Devil? You know, I'm scorpio
Don't try to resist
Honey, love it

Sex in Paris
I know that you want me so fuck me, lovely
Show me you're mine but don't show me mercy
I'll call you my love if you do it, baby
Sex in Paris

Teach me the bad things a girl do like and
Just wear the cross on your neck tonight
The demon you prayed for is now alive
Your pussy's so good that I die alive

Sex in Paris
I know that you want me so fuck me, lovely
Show me you're mine but don't show me mercy
I'll call you my love if you do it, baby
Sex in Paris

Take me in your room lady
I'm in the mood yeah
You said that you'd die for me
Nobody else but you
Angel or Devil? You know, I'm scorpio so
Tell me, slowly, are you horny?

Sex in Paris
I know that you want me so fuck me, lovely
Show me you're mine but don't show me mercy
I'll call you my love if you do it, baby
Sex in Paris
