		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a kickstand in your mouth
And I'm the tongue slamming on the brakes
Pull the choke in, pull the choke in
As hard as it will take
All your pictures are getting dirty
Don't want anyone else's hand on my gears
And I'll choke on all the diamonds
Like a vulture, on your face

[Chorus:]
So ask yourself before you get in
Know insurance won't cover this
Are you the rabbit or the headlight?
And is there room in your life
For one more breakdown?

You can't escape, can't escape
All your demons, all you demons
Watch out, watch out for your lovers

Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster
I'm late, I'm late
The hands I'm my clock are starting to shake
We're on the line between the devil's tits
We've been driving on E
I'm gonna to be wanted for this crime
Or at least "you're wanted," she'll say

[Chorus]

An unmarked car, can't remember where I parked you
But I love you, can't afford you; take a cab to funeral
Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster
I'm late, I'm late
The hands I'm my clock are starting to shake

You can't escape, can't escape
All your demons, all you demons
Watch out, watch out for your lovers

[Chorus]
