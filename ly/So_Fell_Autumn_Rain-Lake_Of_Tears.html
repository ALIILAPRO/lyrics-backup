		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Leaving with twilight though I was chosen
To wander the way in the darkest of nights
Oh in the summer sun how soon i came to stray
A true damnation when I turned away

So fell autumn rain washed away ali my pain
I feel brighter somehow lighter somehow to breath once
again
So fell autumn rain washed my sorrows away
With the sunset behind somehow I find the dreams are
to stay

So fell autumn rain

Blinded by dawning so you would take me
further away away from the fall
Oh you told me I must never dream again
A true damnation you left me the pain

So fell autumn rain but all things must pass

So fell autumn rain washed away all my pain
I feel bnghter somehow lighter somehow to breath once
again
So tell autumn rain washed my sorrows away
With the sunset behind somehow I f nd the dreams are
to stay

So fell winter
