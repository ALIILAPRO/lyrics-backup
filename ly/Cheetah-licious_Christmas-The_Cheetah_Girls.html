		  Let's deck the halls with spots of Cheetah
Let's have some Christmas fun! Yea
If you wanna be, oh, a Christmas Cheetah
We can show you how it's done!
You be gotta be good

Helping all ya girls
Everywhere that you go
All around the world

Have yourself a very merry

Cheetah-licious Christmas
We just wanna wish you
A Cheetah-licious Christmas now
Cheetah-licious Christmas
Celebrate it with us!
Cheetah Girls will show you how!

Santa's got a new look
He's dressed up in Cheetah spots!
And all the reindeer too!
Chanel's decorating
Aqua's got cookies baking
Dorinda's wrapping presents for you
(Oh you know)

The Cheetah Girls way
Be yourself
Have a Cheetah Holiday
I know you will
You got what it takes
You got growl power
Have yourself a very merry

Cheetah-licious Christmas
We just wanna wish you
A Cheetah-licious Christmas now
Cheetah-licious Christmas

Never hide the Cheetah inside
That's a promise we made
Show how you glitter at Christmas time
Wear your spots your own way
Be a Cheetah Everyday

Give me a C (Christmas with Cheetah)
H (Help all your sisters)
R (Respect each other always)
Give me a I (I do promise to)

T (To Cheetah style everyday)
Give me a M (Merry Christmas, make it Cheetah-licious)
A (Always be true to your word)
Give me a S (Sing now with me)
Yes I'm ready to be, a real Cheetah Girl!
Say everybody have a merry

Cheetah-licious Christmas

A Cheetah-licious Christmas now
