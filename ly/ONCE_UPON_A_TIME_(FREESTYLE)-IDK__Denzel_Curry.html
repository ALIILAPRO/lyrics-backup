		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, when it comes to wordplay, I'm bringing it
Everything I do is spine-tingling
Guaranteed to keep your mind lingering
When it comes down to me and the world, I'm fingering
Me against the world, leave the ocean full of pearls
Oyster, guarantee to get the pussy moister
If the earth don't wanna be saved, I disappoint her
As I constantly try to evolve just like a Togepi
Keep my pockets thick as The Parkers
Professor Oglevee
No one's sick as me
Have the common cold, catch a cold from me
Isn't it ironic the younger me is the older me?
Fans demand that I rap about shit I did at seventeen
Might as well I cut my hair off and take some LSD

Disrespect Zel' and I might have to raise hell
The only way you live is if you saved by the bell
'Cause I'm teaching niggas lessons while they find a way to fail
That's the reason why I think you niggas tripping like you fell
Well, I flip a coin and make a wish
I wish these pussy niggas found a way to hop up off my dick
I flick my wrist and make her disappear
Now that's a fucking trick
I trick a nigga off the liquor to give me the money 'fore I fucking flip him
The diamonds on my neck wet, flippa
She wet but her last man wasn't a good swimmer
Sim Simma, who got the keys to my Bimmer?
And then I check my pockets like, "Oh, it's me, nigga" (skrrt)

Remember to remember
Matter fact, remember the fifth of November
Too many scars upon my face, no Simba
Rappers thinking they the most dark but I'm dimmer
Mos Def and grimmer
Dare to witness 
The superficial, mean and vicious
I'm bad as a infant 
Without a parent having interest
Suspicious intent
Riding around in five percent tint
We'll push your cap back 
And send your soul to new dimensions
The ammunition only ignited my ignition
My ambition is only make right decisions on my mission
My division is separate from my business and my bitches
Every sentence and line is a reflection of time

My times table never was good at the time I was nine
At seventeen, I was forced in a nine to the five
So nine times out of ten, I'm despising the eyes of the greedy ones
All around me like some fucking flies, get away
Bye-bye, 'NSYNC
Lie, lie, instinct
Y'all niggas some fossils telling me how to live my life
Just suck my dick and bump my shit
And stream my shit so I can go and count my grip
Reverse the slavery every time I pull out my whip
Then pull up on a racist race like I am the shit
I limp towards the cake 'cause I am the pimp
Ain't nobody fucking my contracts up like Prince, uh
