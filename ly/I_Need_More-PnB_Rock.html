		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got it on smash
Girl, you keep flexing on your ex, ain't on my level
Hitmaka
Yeah

He can fuck you good, but I can fuck you better (yeah, yeah)
Girl, you keep flexing on your ex, ain't on my level
This shit keep coming, I keep hunnids on my schedule (bands)
Had to risk my life to get this ice all on my bezel (ice, ice, ice)
Pockets swole (but I need more, I need more)
Wrist on froze (but I need more, but I need more)
Copped the Rolls (but I need more, I need more)
Yeah (but I need more)

Who in the hell would thought I would be here
Singin', rappin' and makin' these millions?
When I was just posted up, all on the block
I was trapping right front of the buildings
Mama said, "Boy, you keep stressing me out
Too caught up in these streets, they gon' kill you"
And she put me right out on the streets
But she said I would die, no, I ain't got no feelings
Drop the top, no, I ain't got no ceilings
I got my Glock when I walk in the building
Got a bad bitch and she how I'm comin'
She know I'm a hundred, she know I'm the realest
I get the check, she help me count it up
All of these hunnids, yeah we add it up
We be just popping them tags, yeah
I don't give a fuck what's your past, yeah
You was fucking all them lames
Fucking all those lames, way before you met me
But you know they ain't better than me
They ain't fucking that check up like me
Don't get that pussy wetter than me
And them niggas ain't flexing like me
I'm the one that invest in your goals
Keep it real, girl, you already know

He can fuck you good, but I can fuck you better (yeah, yeah)
Girl, you keep flexing on your ex, ain't on my level
This shit keep coming, I keep hunnids on my schedule (bands)
Had to risk my life to get this ice all on my bezel (ice, ice, ice)
Pockets swole (but I need more, I need more)
Wrist on froze (but I need more, but I need more)
Copped the Rolls (but I need more, I need more)
Yeah (but I need more)

I know these niggas, they hatin' us
All of these bitches, they hatin' us
Balencie', all different flavors
Gucci in all different flavors
When we be fucking, I beat that shit down
You be screamin' so loud, waking neighbors up
I hit it good, you say "Daddy so good
I swear I need that right when I'm waking up"
Get you a bust down, young nigga up now
I just might go cop that Lambo (truck now)
All of these bad lil' bitches wanna (fuck now)
We caught a opp out of bounds, that's a (touch down)
Brr, brr, brr, I still pull up with the stick
My lil' bitch, she super thick
Gave me that pussy, now she lit
I put that ice on her wrist
I got her pullin' up in all them foreigns
Fuck lame lil' nigga, he was boring
When he had you, he ain't know what he was doing
Yeah, I'm the one that invest in your goals
I'm the one, put that dick in your soul
Keep it real, girl, you already know

He can fuck you good, but I can fuck you better (fuck you better)
Girl, you keep flexing on your ex, ain't on my level (your ex ain't on my level)
This shit keep coming, I keep hunnids on my schedule (keep hunnids on my schedule)
Had to risk my life to get this ice all on my bezel (to get this ice all on my bezel)
Pockets swole (yeah, but I need more, I need more)
Wrist on froze (but I need more, but I need more)
Copped the Rolls (but I need more, I need more)
Yeah (but I need more)

Know what he was doin'
But I need more
