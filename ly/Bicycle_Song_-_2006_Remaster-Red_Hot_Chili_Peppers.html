		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here she comes in a suit and tie
Shepard's bush and a leopard's pie
She marching to the funky beat
Of James Brown and his dancing feet
Gonna set your fish on fire
Pistol whipping of desire
So please do not resist your fate
I'll pick you up, yes, it's a date

How could I forget to mention the bicycle is a good invention?
Sitting there in a silent movie
Beside the only girl who really ever moved me
Happy days but sad I'm facin'
Heaven knows that I'm on the case, oh
How could I forget to mention the bicycle?

Somebody told the world
The beauty of your verse
My girl, I heard it first
The beauty of your verse

A sticky finger and a wicked taste
Got a lot of nerve and a lyrical case
Be sure to write it in your book
I promise not to look
Wanna smell your sunny face
Funny place, but it's never a waste
I'd hop this fence to make amends
I hope this movie never ends

How could I forget to mention the bicycle is a good invention?
Make it up, makin' you my business
A funny buttercup, gotta live for forgiveness
Happy days, but sad I'm facin'
Heaven knows I'm on the case, oh
How could I forget to mention the bicycle?

Somebody told the world
The beauty of your verse
My girl, I heard it first
The beauty of your verse

Somebody told the world
The beauty of your verse
My girl, I heard it first
The beauty of your verse
