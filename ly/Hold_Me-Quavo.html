Hold me
I need you to hold me
I need you to hold me
Don't let me go (I'm workin' on dyin')
I need you to hold me
Bnyx (don't let me go)

Do you feel like you can get through the hard times? (Damn)
Do you feel like you can get on your knees 
And just pray to the Lord through the hard times? (Hold me)
You know what you need, I just need you to hold me (hold me)
Listen and feel my heart closely
I was dyin' in too deep like an ocean (splash)
You the only one goin' through the motions (motions)
I was trapped up in all my emotions (ha)
Lost my nephew to gunplay and smoke shit
Lost my dawgs to some petty ass ho shit
I guess you look at me 'cause I'm the oldest
We was the closest (on God)
I ain't never gon' let the streets hold me (streets)
He never gon' hit it, I fold it (never)
It's on me and I ain't got to show it
I just gave it to God, told Him, "Hold it"

Mama, I want you to hold me
Takeoff, promise, don't let me go
Heaven, I want you to hold me
Migo (don't let me go)
Tree, I want you to hold me
Shar, promise, don't let me go
Jada, I want you to hold me
Jamie (don't let me go)

Do you feel like you can get through the hard times?
Lookin' right at the dark when the light shine
I suggest you hold me
We live different lives and races
All in different places (hold me)
I need you to hold me
If you lost and you can't find it
You ain't the only one that's been cryin'
Just pull up on me (hold me)
Yeah, if you lost and you can't find it
You ain't the only one that's been cryin'
Just pull up on me (hold me)
I need you to hold me

Hold me
Don't let me go
We supposed to be fam
Hold me
Don't let me go
We supposed to be fam
Hold me
Don't let me go
Supposed to be fam
Hold me
Don't let me go
