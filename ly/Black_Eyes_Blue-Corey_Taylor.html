		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I stood alone in Trafalgar Square
I looked around I didn't see you there
Before they closed the roads I made it down to Hyde
I just need you now, I need you by my side

I know that there's no other way
I know that there is nothing more that I can say
Make my black eyes blue
I fall for you

Behind the trees, in front of Golden Gates
I was never beholden to the hands of fate
Consternation in the middle of my chest
You know me better than the ones who know me best

I know that there's no other way
I know that there is nothing more that I can say
Make my black eyes blue
I fall for you

London Eyes, they give me Russian looks
Oh, this winter wind is all it took
Lights are coming up just as the sun is going down
This sentiment and all of it is all I want, I need you now

We all need, a little red on our horizon, baby
We all live and breathe
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (red on my horizon)

I know that there's no other way
I know that there is nothing more that I can say (red on my horizon)
Make my black eyes blue
I fall

Ooh, all I need, I need your red on my horizon, baby
You make me live, you make me breathe
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (red on my horizon)

I know that there's no other way
I know that there is nothing more that I can say (red on my horizon)
Make my black eyes blue
Make my black eyes blue (red on my horizon)
Make my black eyes blue
I fall
