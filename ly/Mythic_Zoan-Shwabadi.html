		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They told me I can't be the man that I wanna be
Huh? Nah fuck that
Never waiving my right to autonomy
I'm who I am and you ain't got a say
So forget who I ought to be
We got a problem? Air that shit audibly
Need you to speak the fuck up when you talk to me
Let's do this properly
Come try to son me, you sure as fuck ain't gonna daughter me
Huh? Yeah! I am the truth
Conqueror's haki, I light up the booth
Huh? Yeah! Life what I choose
You wanna fight? Then we light up the roof
Bitch, if I make contact you getting lifted
Like lighting the zoot
Roll with the team at my side
I got so many beasts with me
Think that I ride with a zoo
Slide on your crew
Hit em with a big club
Big back hand with the haki now they hit stunned
If they wanna step to the best, put the fists up
Metal on the hip it kick back, they spit blood
So much weight on my shoulders
If you were me then you couldn't even sit up
I was raised to be a soldier
And put a fucking dragon in the ground like dig dug
So much blood on my name and my hands
Know my legacy's staining the land of my home
But I've grown and I'm making a stand
I ain't hailing a cab if I'm raising my hand
Live my life in the image of greatness
Live up to the name, I ain't failing the man
You ain't fitting the mission
I'm writing your name out the script
As I'm making the plans

Yeah, yeah, had to switch up the plans
Had to switch up, had to switch up the plans
Had to switch up
Had to switch up
Had to switch up

Okay I switched up
Mythic zoan
Yeah I switched up
I'm in my zone
Okay I switched up
Mythic zoan
Yeah I switched up
I'm in my zone
Okay I switched up
Mythic zoan
Take him off his throne
Read your moves
Kenbunshoku haki, I already know
What you do, this ain't nothing new
I see how you roll
Brand new crew, you know how they do
Gomu gomu no
Okay I switched up
Buddy, you been switched off
Badi keep a rocket in his pocket
Make him lift off
Body got that inu inu no mi, I'm a big dog
Turn that little uo uo no mi into fish stock
Yummy
I'm the king in this bitch
Fuck that King, he a bitch
Metal on me like Hiyori
Make it sing in this bitch
They can try and it take it all
But I'll be swinging the fists
Busoshoku on the kanabo
It sting like a bitch

Bitch
