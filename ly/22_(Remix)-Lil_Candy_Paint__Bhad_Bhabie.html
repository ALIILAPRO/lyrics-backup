She havin' deep thoughts, and I can see it
Everything that I say, know I mean it
Said, "I love you," just believe it
I hate it when we argue for no reason
Pourin' up that cup, I think I'm drinkin'
I'm pourin' up for nothin', think I'm fiendin'
She goin' off for nothin', think I'm cheatin'
I can't blame lil' baby, I'm a demon

We out, I order Sprite and put codeine in it
But she don't like that shit when I be ignorant
I'm pourin' up the pint what you had spent on rent
If she don't like her ass, then we fixin' it
Hop in X6 twin-turbo, big as shit
My bitch bad and she boujee and she Snicker thick
Nigga tryna pluck twenty-two, we split his wig
You could try to try my bitch, but you ain't gettin' shit
You niggas desperate for my ho
I keep checkin' on my ho
I ain't never stressin' on my ho
I count these backends with my ho
You be actin' for your ho
You'll get slapped in front of your ho
I can't believe these jokes
Nigga dapped me up sayin', "Bro"
Then tried to talk to my ho
But we ain't stressin' anything
It's still purple everything
It's still purple everything

Blowin' up his phone, I know I'm trippin' for no reason
He gon' call it crazy, but I say I call it fiendin'
He don't want no other hoes 'cause that lil' shit too easy
Know I talk a lot of shit, but he know I don't mean it
My big bro say I'm trippin', but I got a hundred reasons
A hundred fuckin' reasons, I'm never ever leavin'
Nope, I ain't leavin'
Even if we ain't speakin'
And if we ain't speakin', you know I'ma be tweakin'
Need a real bitch, I ain't nothin' like these groupie hoes
Nothin' like these bitches sittin' front row at your fuckin' shows
He need him a real one, somethin' to make him feel some'
I know I ain't trippin', man, about you I might kill some'
(Huh, yeah) kill some', fuck it, yeah, drill some'
Make one call, he still come 'cause I make him feel some'
Yeah, feel some', feel some'
This lil' somethin' different, swear to God it make him feel numb
