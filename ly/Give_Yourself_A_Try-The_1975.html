		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You learn a couple things when you get to my age
Like friends don't lie and it all tastes the same in the dark
When your vinyl and your coffee collection is a sign of the times
You're getting spiritually enlightened at 29

So just give yourself a try
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give?

I found a grey hair in one of my zoots
Like context in a modern debate, I just took it out
The only apparatus required for happiness
Is your pain and fucking going outside
And getting STDs at 27 really isn't the vibe
Jane took her own life at 16
She was a kid who had the box tattooed on her arm
And I was 25 and afraid to go outside
A millennial that baby-boomers like

Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give?

And what would you say to your younger self?
Growing a beard's quite hard
And whiskey never starts to taste nice
And you'll make a lot of money, and it's funny
'Cause you'll move somewhere sunny and get addicted to drugs
And spend obscene amounts on fucking seeds and beans online

So just give yourself a try
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give?
