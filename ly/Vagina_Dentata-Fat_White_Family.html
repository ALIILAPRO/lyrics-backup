		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You ever get a feeling that nobody's listening for a very good reason?
Pockets out of place
Push come to shove, you shrug it off, wrong season

You know 
You only walk 'em home if you're sure that you can watch 'em walk away
You know
You only walk 'em home if you're sure that you can watch 'em walk away

Yes, I'm everything you ever wanted to become
But did not have the courage to be
Yes, it's everything you ever wanted to see undone
But did not have the courage to leave

On bended knee, you beg of me
Unbury all your strength
To forget what you want
You must do what you want
Over and over again

You know 
You only walk 'em home if you're sure that you can watch 'em walk away
You know
You only walk 'em home if you're sure that you can watch 'em walk away

Yes, I'm everything you ever wanted to become
But did not have the courage to be
Yes, it's everything you ever wanted to see undone
But did not have the courage to leave
