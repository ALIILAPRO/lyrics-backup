		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby here I am
I'm the man on the scene
I can give you what you want
But you gotta' come home with me

I have got some good old lovin'
And I got some more in store
When I get through throwin' it on
You gotta' come back for more

Boys will come along a dime by the dozen
That ain't nothing but ten cent lovin'
Pretty little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle now, yes I am

Action speaks louder than words
And I'm a man of great experience
I know you've got another man
But I can love you better than him

Take my hand don't be afraid
I'm gonna prove every word I say
I'm advertising love for free
So you can place your ad with me

Boys will come along a dime by the dozen
That ain't nothing but ten cent lovin'
Pretty little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle now, yes I am

Yeah
Hard to handle now
Oh baby

Baby, here I am 
I'm the man on the scene
I can give you what you want
But you gotta' come home with me

I've got some good old lovin' 
And I got some more in store
When I get through throwin' it on you
You got to come a-runnin' back for more

Boys will come along a dime by the dozen
That ain't nothing but ten cent lovin'
Pretty little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle now, yes I am

Hard
Hard to handle now
Oh yeah, yeah yeah yeah

Boys will come along a dime by the dozen
That ain't nothing but ten cent lovin'
Pretty little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle now, yes I am

Yeah
So hard to handle now
Oh yeah

Baby
Good lovin'
Baby, baby
Ohh, good lovin'
I need good lovin'
I got to have it, oh yeah
Yeah
So hard to handle, now, yeah
