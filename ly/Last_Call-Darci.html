		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been a long week, took the mask off
Double cup pouring up, finna blast off yeah

Been a long week, took the mask off
Double cup pouring up, finna blast off
Baby focused on the Gs, let cash fall
That's all let it go until the last call

Been-Been sipping slow, on the road
Going crazy
Know I'm in the mode, let it go, lil baby
I been in the zone, feeling cold
Couldn't save me know we caught a glow
Going ghost on you lately

Been a long week, like the nights never end
Double cup bleed, going fast on a bend
Focus on the freeze, throw it back, baby
Then come along with me
And we can smash in the Benz
Couldn't really see like the cap on the lens
Got me feeling low, got me crashing again
You know how it goes, I'm a savage again
Tell me why you asking again? (yeah)

Been a long week, took the mask off
Double cup pouring up, finna blast off
Baby focused on the Gs, let cash fall
That's all let it go until the last call

Been-Been sipping slow, on the road
Going crazy
Know I'm in the mode, let it go, lil baby
I been in the zone, feeling cold
Couldn't save me know we caught a glow
Going ghost on you lately

Been a long sec, guess I'm back to my ways
Aye dealing with the stress
Bigger checks on a pay day
Know I'm saying less, still a wreck
Saying mayday guess you know the rest
Still flex on you raging
Love it how you always been mess
Been slaying
Love it how you taking off that dress
Just saying
Guess we been addicted to sex, I'll say it
Still you got me falling for you, yes
No playing

Been a long week, took the mask off
Double cup pouring up, finna blast off
Baby focused on the Gs, let cash fall
That's all let it go until the last call

Been-Been sipping slow, on the road
Going crazy
Know I'm in the mode, let it go, lil baby
I been in the zone, feeling cold
Couldn't save me know we caught a glow
Going ghost on you lately

(Know we got a glow going)
(Gho-Ghost on you lately)
(Know we got a glow going)
(Gho-Ghost on you lately)

Been a long week, took the mask off
Double cup pouring up, finna blast off
Baby focused on the Gs, let cash fall
That's all let it go until the last call
Been sipping slow, on the road, going crazy
Been-Been sipping slow, on the road
Going crazy
