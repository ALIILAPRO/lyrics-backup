		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Always running on the move
Ain't a thing we couldn't do
Ooh, ooh
Sippin' liquor after school
Paper bags to hide the booze
Ooh

We'll make it I swear
'Cause we're halfway there
So let me take it, take it all the way
With my heart on my sleeve
In all honesty
There's something that I gotta, gotta say

Baby I don't deserve it
But I'll give you all I got and I'll make it worth it
Rely on me and baby you won't be nervous
'Cause if we give it a shot then we could be perfect

Making sure nobody knew
Trouble that we got into
Ooh, ooh
Skinny dipping in the pool
Breaking all our made-up rules
Ooh

We'll make it I swear
'Cause we're halfway there
So let me take it, take it all the way
With my heart on my sleeve
In all honesty
There's something that I gotta gotta say

Baby I don't deserve it
But I'll give you all I got and I'll make it worth it
Rely on me and baby you won't be nervous
'Cause if we give it a shot then we could be perfect (if we give it a shot)

Baby you won't be nervous
'Cause if we give it a shot then we could be perfect

Baby I don't deserve it
But I'll give you all I got and I'll make it worth it
Rely on me and baby you won't be nervous
'Cause if we give it a shot then we could be perfect (if we give it a shot)
