		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Out on the fields where the lonely horizons lies
So cold to the touch, every valley is made of ice
Fairest of gods, he was forced to be put on trials
Facing his end staring in to the tricksters eyes

Metal and steel, fire and ice
Was thrown at his naked brow
They all where repelled no matter the might
Nothing could harm him now

God of light so wise and strong
The fairest of them all
His downfall was a mistletoe
Now hope is bound to fall

Loki's plan so evil and so vicious in it's way
Now only tears can save the worlds
from Ragnaroks dismay

In search for the truth he came up with a grand disguise
One conversation that lit up his evil eyes
For Loki, the envy was to much for him to bear
A secret revealed of a flower with skills so rare

Metal and steel fire and ice
Was thrown at his naked brow
They are where repelled no matter the might
Nothing could harm him now

God of light so wise and strong
the fairest of them all
His downfall was a mistletoe
Now hope is bound to fall

Loki's plan so evil and so vicious in it's way
Now only tears can save the worlds
from Ragnarok dismay
