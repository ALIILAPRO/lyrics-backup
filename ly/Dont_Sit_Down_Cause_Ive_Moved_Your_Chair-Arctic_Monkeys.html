		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Break a mirror
Roll the dice
Run with scissors
Through a chip pan fire fight
Go into business with a grizzly bear
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair

Find a well-known hard man
And start a fight
Wear your shell suit
On bonfire night
Fill in a circular hole with a peg that's square
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair

Ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Bite the lightning
And tell me how it tastes
Kung-fu fighting
On your roller skates
Do the Macarena in the devil's lair
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair

Ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh
