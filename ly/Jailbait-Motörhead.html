		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Teenage baby, you're a sweet young thing
Still tied to mama's apron strings
I don't even dare to ask your age
Just enough to know you're here backstage
You're jailbait and I just can't wait
Jailbait, baby come on

Hey!

One taste, baby all I need
My decision made at lightning speed
I don't even want to know your name
It's enough to know you feel the same
Jailbait and I just can't wait
Jailbait baby, get down

Hey!

Love that young stuff

Tell me baby, how you look so fine
Send quivers up and down my spine
I don't care about our different ages
I'm an open book with well-thumbed pages
Jailbait, I ain't too late
Jailbait baby, get down

All right!
