		  Let me teach you how you swing (hey)
I’ve got that good foot movin, just gotta love the way I swing (hey)
Girl move don’t stop keep movin

(Lets move) get in love when Chobo swings
Get you in the mood like red wine
Swing baby swing cause tonight you’re mine
I’m gonna make your whole world stop to spin
Your spending that night with an Afrikaan,

Swing baby swing yeah sweat and burn

We gone swing til we’re old and done done done (Pun Pun Pun no done done done)
