		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wonder if you often think about what you became
Do you ever wonder if you ever truly changed?
Cause honestly I'm lost and I don't know who to blame
I need some help cause I don't know what else to soothe the pain
I watch you raise me as a baby so over protective
Smiling at me, blowing kisses while you hold me restless
When you told me that you loved me I can tell you meant it
And it never took for you to try to ever show your efforts
But we was connected through the heavens though I felt your soul
And that alone is just a feeling some will never know
I bump my head and you consoled me as you held me close
And I wonder where went wrong but I guess I'll never know
Cause ever since I grown I felt like you been kind of giving up
And it seems like everything I do is just not good enough
Shit, we don't have the type of bond we used to have before
And I ain't mad at all 
I just wonder if you recall the day that I was born, when you used to sing to me like

La la la la la la la la
(You used to sing to me like)
La la la la la la la la la
(You used to sing to me)
La la la la la la la la
(Yeah, you used to sing to me like)
La la la la la la la la

I wonder if you often think about what you became
And do you ever wonder if you ever truly changed?
Cause honestly I'm lost and I don't know to blame
Nigga I need some help, cause I don't know what else to soothe the pain
My father died when I was five and I ain't cry at all
I never knew him he just disappeared and I'm not sure if he knew I would grow up to be ruthless, 
I don't hide my flaws
A young woman with a body and a mind like yours, cause we a lot alike
I mean that's prolly' why I felt connected
And when we met I was so innocent but slowly tempted
When you told me that you loved me boy I know you meant it
You sucked the soul out of my body with your own intentions
Now I'm stuck inside a life of prostitution, no discretion
And all you do is beat my ass and leave me slowly breathless
But we don't have the type of bond we used to have before
And I ain't mad at all, 
I just wonder if you recall when I laid in your arms and you used to sing to me like

La la la la la la la la
(You used to sing to me like)
La la la la la la la la la
(You used to sing to me)
La la la la la la la la
(Yeah, you used to sing to me like)
La la la la la la la la

I wonder if you often think about what I became
And do you ever wonder if I ever truly changed?
Cause honestly I'm lost and I don't know who to blame
Listen, I need some help cause I don't know what else to soothe the pain
I used to watch movies about you a whole lot before
I read about you back in school when I was kind of bored
Now I'm ashamed and embarrassed I truly got involved
Cause you gave me a feeling some shit that I never felt before
And I ain't trying to make excuses but inside I'm torn
And you was there for me at times I couldn't find the lord
And all I had to do was inject you and lock the doors
So I can feel some type of peace while I dreamed and go watch the stars
And that alone is just a feeling some will never know
But now I'm rotting, it's not the same as I felt before
We don't have the type of bond we used to have before
But I ain't mad at all 
I just wonder if you recall sticking you in my arms when you used to sing to me like

La la la la la la la la
(You used to sing to me like)
La la la la la la la la la
(You used to sing to me)
La la la la la la la la
(Yeah, you used to sing to me like)
La la la la la la la la

"Yo wassup, this is Joyner, i'm unable to take your call right now
Leave me a brief message and ill get back to you, peace"

"Ey yo, i'm really trying to figure something out 
and you gotta give me a chance to my finger on that shit, cause im really confused man."

"I let you crash on my couch because you told me, you aint had nowhere to sleep last night
and you stole from me my G? On some G shit man? Bro, what kind of shit is that man."
"Really my nigga?"
"Yo, whoopham ass nigga man, when I see I need a fair one G, facts"
