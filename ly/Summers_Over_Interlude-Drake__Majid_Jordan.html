		  Ooh-ooh
Ooh (oh, baby)

Days in the sun
And nights in the rain
Summer is over, simple and plain
I found me some fun that's good for the pain
I already told you, I don't feel the same
I don't feel the same

Anywhere I go
I can't help but show
I don't feel the same
Anywhere I go
I can't help but know

(I don't feel the same)
(Anywhere I go)
(I can't help but know)
