		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I had a dream of a ship that was sailed in the night
Such a sweet, sweet call
The siren soothes my mind
Who am I going to be when the curtain is drawn?
In the cold, cold light they whisper to me, "take it all"

Ooh ooh ooh
The fortune said, 
"Flowers bloom with no regret"

Surround me, body and soul
Pull me into your glow, make me blush
Unbound me, spin me in gold
As the story unfolds in your touch

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Who can breathe me into life?
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Just one more look at you
My heart has been hypnotized

I know a place where it s always so perfect and blue
And the boy says, "Babe, believe me, it's all for you"

Ooh ooh ooh
The fortune said
"Flowers bloom with no regret"

Surround me, body and soul
Pull me into your glow, make me blush
Unbound me, spin me in gold
As the story unfolds in your touch

Ooh ooh oh ooh
Who can breathe me into life?
Ooh ooh oh ooh
Just one more look at you
My heart has been hypnotized

And every color comes to life
As petals fall before your eyes
You kiss me and I m hypnotized

Surround me, body and soul
Pull me into your glow, make me blush
Unbound me, spin me in gold
As the story unfolds in your touch

Ooh ooh oh ooh
Who can breathe me into life?
Ooh ooh oh ooh
Just one more look at you
My heart has been hypnotized
