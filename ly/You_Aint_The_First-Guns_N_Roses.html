		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rolling?
One, two, three
One, two, three
two, three, one

I tried so hard just to get through to you
But your head's so far
From the realness of truth
Was it just a come on in the dark
Wasn't meant to last long
I think you've worn your welcome honey
I'll just see you along as I sing you this song

One, two, three, one
Time can pass slowly 
Things always change
Your day's been numbered
And I've read your last page
You was just a temporary love
But honey you ain't the first
Lots of other come before you woman
Said but you been the worst
Said you been the worst

So goodbye to you girl
So long, farewell
I can't hear you cryin'
Your jivin's been hell
So look for me walkin' 
Down your street at night
I'll be in with another
Deep down inside
Deep down inside
