		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My personality
Is for no one to see
You think you know me but you don’t know nothing at all
Every time that I’ve tried
Not to be so damn shy
The look you gave me told me everything that I thought
Tell me I’m just a letdown
That you don’t want me around
And burn me to the...
I can’t be myself
But I don’t wanna fake and try to be like you
I’ll be someone else
So you don’t have to face the things I’d say and do
I try to seem just fine
I always fall in line
Because I know that’s how you like me more as a friend
No one really hates me
Some say I’ve found the key
To be in peace with me but all of that is a lie
Everyone knows me like that
What’s the point of changing now
When all I have is people
That like me for someone I’m not
I can’t be myself
But I don’t wanna fake and try to be like you
I’ll be someone else
So you don’t have to face the things I’d say and do
It’s always been my way to cope with life anyway
And I think that’s okay
It doesn’t bother me, I know I can’t walk away
I guess I’m destined to be everything that I’m not
I can’t be myself
But I don’t wanna fake and try to be like you
I’ll be someone else
So you don’t have to face the things I’d say and do
I can’t be myself
But I don’t wanna fake and try to be like you
I’ll be someone else
So you don’t have to face the things I’d say and do
