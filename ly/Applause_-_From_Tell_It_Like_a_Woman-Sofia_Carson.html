		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Recognize who you are
Sometimes, I know it's so hard
But you shine
You're a supernova superstar (supernova superstar)

They can't stop you, you were born unstoppable
Dare to know that you're remarkable
Stand up, stand up
Raise your hands up, hands up, yeah

Give yourself some applause, you deserve it
Give yourself some respect 'cause you've earned it
Give yourself some love 'cause you're worth it, you're worth it
Yeah, hell yeah
Let 'em know you know it, go and show you own it
You're bold, you're bad, you're strong
So give yourself some applause, applause, applause
Give yourself some

Realize how far you've come
This time, you won't be outdone
You're on fire
It's your time, I know your time has come
(Let 'em know your time has come)

Believe it, you're the queen, you wear the crown
Feel it, take it in and take a bow
Stand up, stand up
Raise your hands up, hands up, yeah

Give yourself some applause, you deserve it
Give yourself some respect 'cause you've earned it
Give yourself some love 'cause you're worth it, you're worth it
Yeah, hell yeah
Let 'em know you know it, go and show you own it
You're bold, you're bad, you're strong
So give yourself some applause, applause, applause
Give yourself some

Pat yourself on the back, somehow you found the faith
To make it through to, through to another day
Times got tough, but somehow, you survived
You kept your head high

Give yourself some applause, you deserve it
Give yourself some respect 'cause you've earned it
Give yourself some love 'cause you're worth it, you're worth it
Yeah, hell yeah
(Let 'em know you're worth it)
Let 'em know you know it, go and show you own it
You're bold, you're bad, you're strong
So give yourself some applause, applause, applause
(Give yourself some applause)
Give yourself some applause (give yourself), you deserve it (you deserve it)
Give yourself some respect 'cause you've earned it (oh, because you're worth it)
Give yourself some love 'cause you're worth it, you're worth it
Yeah, hell yeah
