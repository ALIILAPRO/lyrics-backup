		  Whoa
What the fuck?
What? What? (Skai)
Let's go, whoa
Let's go, hey (hey)
Let's go (ooh), whoa (ooh)
Yeah, let's go (oh)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa (go)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa (yeah)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa (whoa)
Whoa, whoa, whoa (yeah)

Always on top of this shit, you ain't ever gotta worry 'bout (go)
Always on top of this shit, you ain't ever gotta worry 'bout nothin' (grrah)
Worry 'bout nothin' (grrah), worry 'bout nothin' (yeah)
Worry 'bout nothin' (yeah), worry 'bout (fah-fah)
Pull up on him with my Glock out, Glock out (let's go)
What is you doin', baby? Help me pull up on you right now (slatt, woohoo)
You is a star, girl, yeah, you're shinin' with the lights out (whoa)
I know that you want it, baby, you can pull up and get dicked down (come here, yeah)

Hey, let's lose our mind, let's lose (whoa, whoa, yeah)
Hey, let's lose our mind, let's lose (whoa, whoa, yeah)
Hey, let's lose our mind (ayy), let's lose (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Hey, it's gonna be alright, just let go (whoa, whoa, whoa, swerve)

All they wanna do is bluff, hey (okay)
All they wanna do is talk down 
'cause they don't wanna see me up, hey (grrah)
I don't really give a fuck, hey, I'ma keep countin' these bucks, hey
It's really lookin' too late for the boy
you might as well be stuck, hey, be stuck, huh (let's go, Faygo)
Hey, tell that lil' boy to catch up (go), I'm a well-known finesser
I can't play 'bout my baby, I'ma make you bleed if you test her (ooh)
Niggas wanna act shady, but it don't even really matter (huh)
I just be up in my own world, baby, I be up on Saturn (talk)
Can't kick it with a shrimp man 'cause my whole team got big plans (talk)
"Lil' faygo, how you eatin' and you still built like a stick, man?" (Yeah)
I'ma run up with that stick, man (yeah), let a nigga start trippin' (yeah)
She don't never wanna listen, think I'm out here trickin' (hey)
'Bout to lean like a kickstand, hit him if he think he big, man
Bands gettin' real big, man, blue hundreds, pockets on Crip dance
And I know a couple Crips, man, and I know a couple Bloods (hey)
You do not want to see blood (hey), you do not want to see blood

Always on top of this shit, you ain't ever gotta worry 'bout (go)
Always on top of this shit, you ain't ever gotta worry 'bout nothin' (grrah)
Worry 'bout nothin' (grrah), worry 'bout nothin' (yeah)
Worry 'bout nothin' (yeah), worry 'bout (fah-fah)
Pull up on him with my Glock out, Glock out (let's go)
What is you doing, baby? Help me pull up on you right now (slatt, woohoo)
You is a star, girl, yeah you're shining with the lights out (whoa)
I know that you want it baby, you can pull up and get dicked down (come here, yeah)

Hey, let's lose our mind, let's lose (whoa, whoa, yeah)
Hey, let's lose our mind, let's lose (whoa, whoa, yeah)
Hey, let's lose our mind (ayy), let's lose (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Hey, it's gonna be alright, just let go (whoa, whoa, whoa)
