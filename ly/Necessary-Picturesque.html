		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You knew how to get my attention
I fell for your words for in a second
Lost in the time, felt so damn right
But that's where you left it 

I picked you up in the P.M.
To soon to jump up off of the deep end
You only want me for the weekend 
(You only want me for the weekend)

All that you wanted was all you could take
You left me alone with the pain
I thought those flowers would get you to stay
But roses just die anyway

I should be learnin my lesson 
But I'm not so good with rejection
Don't even know if i wanted you 
But I didn't cross your mind 
Now just I'm stuck with you running through mine
 
Oh you left in the P.M.
Now I'm going off the deep end
Can't even love you on the weekend
(Can't even love you on the weekend)

All that you wanted was all you could take
You left me alone with the pain
I thought those flowers would get you to stay
But Roses just die anyway
I wish that I was necessary
I wish that I was necessary

All that you wanted was all you could take
You left me alone with the pain
I thought those flowers would get you to stay
But Roses just die anyway
All that you wanted was all you could take
You left me alone with the pain
I thought those flowers would get you to stay
But Roses just die anyway
I wish that I was necessary
I wish that I was necessary
I wish that I was necessary.
