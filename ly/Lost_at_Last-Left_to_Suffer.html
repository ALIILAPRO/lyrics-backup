		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am corruption laid before the feet of kings
I am destruction lay me down andtakemy name

The willwaits, has been broken and noone will speak
Truth will reign and forgotten words finally spoken
Tyranny runs deep within me and leads to total collapse
Veins popping out my own head to have relapse

God damn I am fucked
My times running, I am out of luck
You stupid bitch
I’ve come for you

I am corruption laid before the feet of kings
I am destruction lay me down and take my name

My graves been dug
But I have one request
Before you talk down on my name
Learn some fucking respect bitch

Mistaken and forgotten I only bailed cause I needed space
Now you torture everybody and it’s driving me insane
Five years that I’ll never get back
You pretend like you remember you don’t know me like that
You stole our shit you fake ass bitch
Just for some shitty album that will never get you rich

I know you wish that you could write like this
DO IT

The ashes are falling
I always pry
Just understand that if your dead I won’t come running back home

Blood stained hands nailed to the cross

I am the anti christ
Sworn to adjust the eyes
Of the innocent inside to save my peace of mind
I am corruption
Laid before the feet of kings
