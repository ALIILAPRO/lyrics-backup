		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You could open with your failings
Make them understand, show the love notes
Make them picture with their eyes closed
Make them wonder where the time goes

Keep your distance south of river
Draw a line, they are not together
Make it screech, stop, wait, turn red
Make me wonder where the time went

You will not save me a standoff
Be another stranger, land here
I will leave this empty handed
Feeling selfish, common as shit

Leave me question where your heart lands
How you open-wounded withstand
Lead me into some false pretense
I will ruin you in a second
Leave it up to interpretation
Open-ended invitation
In your wedding, I could crash it
Whisper in your ear "God, I missed you"
It's been too much, I can't stand it

Then I'll cry there in the staff room
Selling my seats to your concerts
I won't stomach it if I see you
Walking so tall I can't reach you
Happier pretty picture
With some new pretty little blue

You will not save me a standoff
You will not save me a standoff
