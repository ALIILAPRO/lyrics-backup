		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Making my way out of DLA
Running with the light of the breaking day 
Staring at the sun is it all in vain 
Gonna leave my trouble gonna leave my pain

Going fifty-five down I-10
Ain't no rush baby, to get back in 
Never saw it coming, well, I didn't think twice
Risking everything under Marfa lights

Baby, I tried
Baby, I tried
Baby, I tried

Leaving love in the dead of night
Stayed so long and it never felt right 
Baby, I tried

Everywhere I go it's pouring rain
Shouldn't have to hold on to try to stay sane 
It's so hard when you're falling fast 
Saying things that you never get back 

Baby, I tried
Baby, I tried
Baby, I tried
Baby, I tried

Leaving love in the dead of night 
Stayed so long and it never felt right 
Baby, I tried

Don't wanna fight
Don't wanna fuck
'Cause I'm putting too much of me into us

Making my way out of DLA
Running with the light of a breaking day
