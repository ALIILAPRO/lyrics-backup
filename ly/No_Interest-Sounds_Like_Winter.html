		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Consider if you will an open book 
There are no mysteries there, no matter where you look 
Let it take you by the hand and walk outside 
Lay you open to the world and there's nowhere to hide 

It's a thousand meters high and it's skin is made of chrome 
It leads you with a promise, but it's heart is solid cold 
It shows no interest, and you are powerless 
cnd you're torn up inside 
It shows no interest and you are powerless 
cnd there is nowhere to hide 

Pick yourself up even if you fell sick 
If you lay on the ground you are gonna get kicked 
You will never find solace, it's the truth we all face 
There isn't only goodness in the human race 

It's a thousand meters high and it's skin is made of chrome 
It leads you with a promise, but it's heart is solid cold 
It shows no interest, and you are powerless 
cnd you're torn up inside 
It shows no interest and you are powerless 
cnd there is nowhere to hide
