		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Blah, blah)
(Blah, blah, blah, blah) Brr, boom
(Blah, blah, blah, blah)
(Blah, blah, blah, blah)

All I hear is (blah, blah, blah, blah)
(Blah, blah, blah, blah)
(Blah, blah, blah, blah)
(Blah, blah, blah, blah)

When I got shot, nigga, what did you do?
Instead of point fingers, like "You, you, you"
Niggas be talkin' like they with the shit
Told me you got a grip, nigga, why you ain't threw?
I was confused with myself, tryna think niggas tough
But deep down, I already knew
Shoot by my dolie, portfolio cool
When I catch you, I'm puttin' a hole in your- (boom, boom, boom)
We gon' keep spinnin', no takin' a break
I'ma keep winnin' and makin' this cake (ooh, oh)
God let me here for a reason, no takin' His faith
I feel guilty for takin' his-
Chance that I'm goin', it ain't no debate
Next time, I promise I'm makin' an eighth
Five-hundred K if you catch him right now
Truly, don't really care if I'm makin' a case (hol' on)
We ain't never take bunnies, you got me confused with someone I'm not (grr, boom)
Now you realized you're litty
Stop the callin' my phone, talkin' hot
I don't know nothin' 'bout nobody murder
And I don't know nothin' 'bout nobody shot
They don't know nothin' 'bout gangsters we be
But they stay tryna tell me it's over for Pop

All I hear is (blah, blah, blah, blah)
(They say you talked, you ain't really do it, right?) (Blah, blah, blah, blah)
(Blah, blah, blah, blah)
(Blah, blah, blah, blah) Yeah, grr, yeah, look, uh, baow

Bro got the addy, I got a idea
Tell me it's up and it's stuck in the air
The way they gon' do him, it's not even fair
And the shit that we do, we do not wanna share (baow)
I do not care, it's not for the 'Gram
Only way I won't throw if it's not in my hands
And that nigga my heart and he want his revenge
We don't care if he's shot, we shot him again (grr, baow)
I wanna stop but it's in my soul
He act like a problem, then he gotta go
We won't even catch a nigga at his-, huh (shh)
We gon' wait 'til he goin' home (blow him down)
Nigga, I say what I want 'cause I'm grown
As long as I watch what I say on that phone
And my time is on demon, I stay in that zone
All them niggas I send is never gon' fold (grr, baow)

(Blah, blah, blah, blah, huh, yeah)
(Blah, blah, blah, blah, yeah)
(Blah, blah, blah, blah)
(Blah, blah, blah, blah, baow)
All I hear is (blah, blah, blah, blah)
You know the type of time you on already, nigga
(Blah, blah, blah, blah) Just duck
(Blah, blah, blah, blah) When you see a nigga, just duck
(Blah, blah, blah, blah)
Yeah, I ain't talkin' 'bout it
They say he talked about it or he ain't do it (baow)
