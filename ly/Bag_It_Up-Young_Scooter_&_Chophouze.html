		  Bag it up and sell it (Work)
Bag it up and sell it (Work)
Break it down and sell it (Break)
Break it down and sell it (Bail)

Bag it up and sell it (Work)
Bag it up and sell it (Work)
Break it down and sell it (Break)
Bag it up and sell it (Work)

Bag it up and sell it
Bag it up and sell it (Bail)
Bag it up and sell it (Work)
Bag it up and sell it (Work)
Bag it up and sell it (Break)
Bag it up and sell it (Work)
Bag it up and sell it
Bag it up and sell it

Check it 'fore you mail it
Wrap it up and sell it
Watch out who you serving, could be niggas telling
A hundred fifty bands of money, and that's just off the extras
I got one plug, nigga, I don't need no extra
Whole house naked baggin' bricks like Nino, bitch
Can't trust nobody with them bricks, they known to steal some shit (For real)
Biggest plug is on sixth da ever talk them bricks (Young Scooter)
Quarter brick, half a brick, that's juice and Gucci shit
Finessing this money I'm making these jewels, that's all that I know
When a dry hit out here I make cocaine, Black Migo got dope
They like if you got them bricks then what you rapping for
Akon with me, I got blood diamonds from Africa

Bag it up and sell it (Work)
Bag it up and sell it (Work)
Break it down and sell it (Break)
Break it down and sell it (Bail)

Bag it up and sell it (Work)
Bag it up and sell it (Work)
Break it down and sell it (Break)
Bag it up and sell it (Work)

Bag it up and sell it
Bag it up and sell it (Bail)
Bag it up and sell it (Work)
Bag it up and sell it (Work)
Bag it up and sell it (Break)
Bag it up and sell it (Work)
Bag it up and sell it
Bag it up and sell it

I'm chasing that money, I'm chasing them hundreds, I'm chasing that paper
I'm taking this off and I'm cooking it up and I'll turn it to yay
Hundred thousand rack on a Audemars
Hundred pounds of kush, get it out of here
Hey, what you tripping on, you see that shit that we sippin' on
I get in my zone, I'm sippin' codeine like it was Patrone
And I'm flyer than any nigga you can name
I put that pressure on you, niggas, on the fly to the flame
I wake up every single day and take a drink of champagne
I gotta hustle every day 'cause that's the way I was trained
I got this package coming in, on the back of a plane
I got some very close friends that'll blow out your brain

Bag it up and sell it (Work)
Bag it up and sell it (Work)
Break it down and sell it (Break)
Break it down and sell it (Bail)

Bag it up and sell it (Work)
Bag it up and sell it (Work)
Break it down and sell it (Break)
Bag it up and sell it (Work)

Bag it up and sell it
Bag it up and sell it (Bail)
Bag it up and sell it (Work)
Bag it up and sell it (Work)
Bag it up and sell it (Break)
Bag it up and sell it (Work)
Bag it up and sell it
Bag it up and sell it
