		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Jimmy, L:] 
Doctor

[Jimmy, R:] 
Patient

I'm the doctor, I'm the patient
Don't forget that, it's important
If ya love me, like I love me
Everybody will be sorry

[Bridge]
Well I don't need nothin' before the show
I don't need nothin', well that's not so
I need something before the show
Just a little something to make me Go! 

[Chorus]
Wow Woah oh
Ya know what I want?
Wow Woah oh
Ya know what I want?
Make it stop [Repeat x2]
Pretty please, a prescription
Make it stop [Repeat x2]
Pretty please, a prescription

I don't need no one screwin' up my fun
Over the counter, fill that prescription
I don't need no one screwin' up my fun
Over the counter, fill that prescription

I'm the doctor, I'm the patient
Don't forget that, it's important
If ya love me, like I love me
Everybody will be sorry

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

I don't need no one screwin' up my fun
Over the counter, fill that prescription
I don't need no one screwin' up my fun
Turn down the bass and fill that prescription

I don't need nothin' before the show
I don't need nothin', no that's not so
I don't need nothin' before the show
I don't need nothin', no that's not so
I don't need nothin' before the show
I don't need nothin' but that's not so
I need something before the show
Just a little something to make me Go!

[Chorus]
