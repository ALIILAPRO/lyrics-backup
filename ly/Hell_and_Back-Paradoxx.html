		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Seeing my fears come alive
I feel like i'm dead inside
I feel like i'm dead inside
I went through hell and back
You would never understand
You would never understand
Getting trapped in yourself
I'm screaming, i'm calling for help
It's quiet as a mouse in here
I just gotta get out of here
But i can't
And you can't help me
If i come back please hold me gently
And now i'm Back , I've lived a thousand lives
If i die let it please be by your side
Seeing my fears come alive
I feel like i'm dead inside
I feel like i'm dead inside
I went through hell and back
You would never understand
You would never understand
Getting trapped in yourself
I'm screaming, i'm calling for help
It's quiet as a mouse in here
I just gotta get out of here
But i can't
And you can't help me
If i come back please hold me gently
And now i'm Back , I've lived a thousand lives
If i die let it please be by your side
