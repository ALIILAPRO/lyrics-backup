		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You took out that money
That your Momma had saved
She told me she kept it 
For running away
Oh my
Fortunes can change

You've picked up some tricks
That you learnt on your way
For fear you'd be lonely
If you never changed
Oh my
You lost your faith

We landed on rocks
And that's partly to blame
We wandered the landscape
In this unbearable pain
Oh my
Your fortune can change

At least we agree
That we've wasted our time
We'll give up the hope
That we'll meet down the line
Better off measured
In coffee, and wine

I think on it fondly
Now the truth can be told
Some love is ancient
And it lives on in your soul
A fortune that never grows old

You spent all that money
That your Momma had saved
Told me she kept it
For running away

Never quite found the right way to say
I'm sorry my darling
My mind it has been changed
Release me
From this unbearable pain

And so ends the story 
I had hoped to change
I had to release us 
From this unbearable pain
And promise 
We won't come here again
