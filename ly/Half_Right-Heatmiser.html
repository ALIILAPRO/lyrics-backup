		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, you shouldn't doctor yourself
Well, I pictured somebody else
Someone who looks like
What I look like
Would you say that the one of your dreams
Got in you and ripped out the seams?
That's what I'd say
That's what I'd say

He was a sucker for your double dose
Motherfucker turned white as a ghost
Don't you say hi?
Don't you say hi?
With a broken sink for a face
And a head that just takes up space
He's not half right
He's not half right

It's already half passed
And it wont last

I was sticking up for my friend
And there's nothing much to defend
It's a lost fight
It's a lost fight
'Cause when I talk to you on the phone
Well, it's just like being alone
It's not half right
It's not half right
