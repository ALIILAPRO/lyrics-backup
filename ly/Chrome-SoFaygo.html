		  Skrrt
(I miss you, Bryce)
(Ayy yo, is that twoprxducers?)

I swear that I'm havin' no heart for these hoes 
I fuck 'em and tell 'em to leave me alone
I'm breakin' the bank and I'm livin' like this every day 
And some days, I don't wanna go home
I'm leavin' you shitty, I'm showin' these bitches no pity 
I wanna go straight for the dome
I'm all in your city, if you wanted beef, get up with me 
I knock off his head with the chrome
Knock off his head with the chrome 
Knock off his head with the chrome (knock off his head with the)
Rockin' designer cologne, don't want your heart if it's not chrome (huh, yeah, skrrt)

You're not 'bout your bread, yeah, I can tell these niggas scared, yeah (scared of it)
You know me, I'ma go take me a risk, Russian Roulette, yeah
Can't wait to put water all over my wrist with the fuckin' baguettes, yeah
She hittin' my DM, said she wanna link, I think you know the rest, yeah (rest of it)
And how I went up, believe what you want, but I'm gettin' them blessings
Girl, you better get away with all them feelings, it's gonna get messy
We got two different destinies
Yeah, I know he feelin' some way (woah, okay, okay)
Yeah, my shooter come with a snipe and it came with a scope (go, brrt)
You puttin' the monkey bullets in the chopper then lettin' it go

I swear that I'm havin' no heart for these hoes 
I fuck 'em and tell 'em to leave me alone
I'm breakin' the bank and I'm livin' like this every day 
And some days, I don't wanna go home (yeah, this shit crazy)
I'm leavin' you shitty, I'm showin' these bitches no pity 
I wanna go straight for the dome 
I'm all in your city, if you wanted beef, get up with me 
I knock off his head with the chrome (bah)
Knock off his head with the chrome 
Knock off his head with the chrome (knock off his head with the)
Rockin' designer cologne, don't want your heart if it's not chrome (huh, yeah, skrr)
Knock off his head with the chrome 
Knock off his head with the chrome (knock off his head with the)
Rockin' designer cologne, don't want your heart if it's not chrome
(I just want you to be gone)

I do not want your heart if it's not chrome 
I only wanna see you grippin' this pole
She shakin' that ass, I double back
I might just touch it if she wanna shake it for gold (shake it for, shake it for gold)
All of the hatin', yes, I let it go
And if I say I love you then I really mean that shit 
I'm never switchin' on you, that's fasho
I'm hangin' with demons, I know that you wouldn't believe it 
You run up, you gonna get smoked (do-do-do-fa)
My chopper go do-do-do-fa, he don't want no war with the guys
We'll pop on you, surprise (okay, okay), we'll pop up on a nigga
Got a ho and she lookin' like model figure, if I let that ho go, I won't even miss her
Helmut Lang jacket from Nieman, nigga, what the fuck did you say? Let me hear you clearer
I get head in the car, I can't even steer, I don't go to no bar, I'm not drinkin' beer
But my niggas, they sippin' that Wock' (oh yeah), and he might just throw that shit up (oh yeah)
Said we gotta run this shit up (oh yeah), twin that money, it never enough
I said that we havin' the way

I swear that I'm havin' no heart for these hoes 
I fuck 'em and tell 'em to leave me alone
I'm breakin' the bank and I'm livin' like this every day 
And some days, I don't wanna go home
I'm leavin' you shitty, I'm showin' these bitches no pity 
I wanna go straight for the dome
I'm all in your city, if you wanted beef, get up with me 
I knock off his head with the chrome
Knock off his head with the chrome 
Knock off his head with the chrome (knock off his head with the)
Rockin' designer cologne, don't want your heart if it's not chrome (huh, yeah, skrr)
Knock off his head with the chrome 
Knock off his head with the chrome (knock off his head with the)
Rockin' designer cologne, don't want your heart if it's not chrome
(I just want you to be gone)

Skrr
