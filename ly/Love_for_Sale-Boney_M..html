		  Love for sale
Advertising young love for sale
Love's that fresh, still unspoilt
Love that slowly slimes the soil
Love for sale

Love for sale
Lots and lots of young love for sale
Now if you'd like to try my wares
Follow me and climb the stairs
Love for sale

Like the poet's type of love
In their childish ways
I know every kind of love
Better far than they
If you want the thrill of love
I've been through the mill of love
Old love, new love
Every love but true love

Love for sale
Advertising young love for sale
Love's that fresh, still unspoilt
Love that slowly slimes the soil
Love for sale

Who would buy
Who would like to sample my surprise
Love for sale

Love for sale
Advertising young love for sale

Love for sale
Advertising crazy love for sale
Now if you'd like to try my wares
Follow me and climb the stairs
Love for sale
Love for sale
Love for sale
Lots and lots of young love for sale
Love for sale
