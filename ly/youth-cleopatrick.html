		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  the day I turn 23 I’m getting married
and shortly after
i’m gettin burried
pick up the pace - you know i've got big plans
i’m talking dinner with friends, shit, shave, then six feet of sand
at least thats the plan

once i lit it, they said, you'll regret it
consequence as thin as smoke
i swore to god i wont

this stuff, is tough
got a lot more than you bargained for
and you have a hard time doing things you do
when you got so much more than you wanted to

my friends are wasted
and I don't even care
im in my basement
texting girls that aren't even real
my youth is gone and i know it
pushed it too far i've outgrown it

it seems you and me
have got a tendency
to see past common deeds
and formalities
lying in the centre of the floor
you and me and our 4/4
me and you and our 8 bars
wasting time before we know its ours

my friends are wasted
and I don't even care
im in my basement
texting girls that aren't even real
my youth is gone and i know it
pushed it too far i've outgrown it

my friends are wasted
and I don't even care
im in my basement
texting girls that aren't even here

my youth is fine
until you waste my fucking time
what a waste of fucking time
when you're telling these bitches you love em cus you wanna fuck em then pay em no mind
what could be missing with pissin blue ribbon and talking about women like 24/7 is this shit not hitting my bro?
is this how you want it to go?

first or last, somewhere you've ashed, the cigarette, thats going to take you down.

first or last, somewhere you've ashed, the cigarette, thats going to take you down.
