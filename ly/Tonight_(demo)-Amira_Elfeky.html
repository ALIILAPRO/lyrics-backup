		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You take away this pain from me
The memories that haunted me
Your smile is like a breath of air
I held it in to feel you here
You watched the light leave from my eyes
And wiped my tears when I would cry
No I can't stay and watch you leave
I close my eyes to feel you here
Tonight
I need you tonight
Tonight
I need you tonight
I can not believe you're mine
I'll kiss you for the thousandth time
You run your fingers down my spine
Heart to heart we intertwine
You're every thing I've ever wanted
If you die I hope you haunt me
No I can't stay and watch you leave
I close my eyes to feel you here
Tonight
I need you tonight
Tonight
I need you tonight
I need you tonight
I need you tonight
