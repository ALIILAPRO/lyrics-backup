		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I made all my worst mistakes when
You came up inside my brain
You left me brokenhearted, girl
You left me suicidal, yeah
All I did was everything
But everything just didn't cut
All I did was everything
But everything's just not enough
I don't mind if you're not there
'Cause I'm so scared that you don't care
Spent all my time on you, I swear
Tell me why I'm scared
Baby, it's not fair and

I drown my tears with the
Clothes you left behind you left behind
I drown my tears with the
Clothes you left behind you left behind
And I've been dealing with
All of these nightmares
Sayin' I've been lost and so
Alone because you're not there
And you know my only fear
Is that you don't care (yeah, yeah)
I told you leave me 'lone
Because I'm so scared

I've been feelin' all around, but baby
You're not there
And I just can't stop thinking 'bout
All of the time we shared
And I've been feelin' all around, but baby
You're not there
And I just can't stop thinking 'bout
All of the time we shared

I made all my worst mistakes when
You came up inside my brain
You left me brokenhearted, girl
You left me suicidal, yeah
All I did was everything
But everything just didn't cut
All I did was everything
But everything's just not enough
I don't mind if you're not there
'Cause I'm so scared that you don't care
Spent all my time on you, I swear
Tell me why I'm scared
Baby, it's not fair and

And you probably feel okay
I don't know what else to say
I'm lost, I don't know the way
Don't wanna be found anyway
And I've been dealing with
All of these nightmares
Saying I've been lost and so
Alone because you're not there
And all the memories inside my brain
More like a hell that
I've been trapped inside
It's not the same, I hope that I'll be fine
But I'll be waiting baby, come and save me
I'll come back to you
Back to you if you want me to

I've been feelin' all around, but baby
You're not there
And I just can't stop thinking 'bout
All of the time we shared
And I've been feelin' all around, but baby
You're not there
And I just can't stop thinking 'bout
All of the time we shared

I made all my worst mistakes when
You came up inside my brain
You left me brokenhearted, girl
You left me suicidal, yeah
All I did was everything
But everything just didn't cut
All I did was everything
But everything's just not enough
I don't mind if you're not there
'Cause I'm so scared that you don't care
Spent all my time on you I swear
Tell me why I'm scared
Baby, it's not fair and

I don't mind if you're not there
Cause I'm so scared that you don't care
Spent all my time on you, I swear
Tell me why I'm scared
Baby, it's not fair and
