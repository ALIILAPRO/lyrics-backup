		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well this city's put me through the wash
Mhmmm, I've been living here for you
Well I used to take my women on the rocks
Yeah, they used to wear out my ballroom shoes

Well you know that I had one too many drinks
Oh I found hope on your machine
Well you didn't answer my request
You left my whole world on your string

Well that's your thing so

Well I see the words left on the screen
Yeah, you know they're bursting just for me
Well you know that I've known you since we were three
Oh, we fell in love at seventeen

Well so I say, what did I learn, what did I learn?
I said, oh you learned me the heart
Well your lies will burn in alcohol
To sterilize the perfect parts

Well at least that's a start
