		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How much can we take before we care to settle? 
Thought we were set for a perfect scene 
Everyone is waiting for a failure 
Something I can't please and justify 
The void within my eyes 
Everyone is waiting for something they cannot have 

Why don't you drop your guard 
I'm on my knees 
You got the mindset of a killer 
And it will not take you far 
If I had the answer would that make you stay? 
This is the time and place it is your moment of fate 

If this would be your last breath 
Would it change a thing? 
Dive head first into the fire 

If you just let me I'll find a way 
To ease your mind and for you to stay 
And I will untie your only ropes 
It's hard for me but believe me, I'm trying 

What are you longing for?
What are you longing for? 
What are you longing for? 

If I had the answer 
Would that make you stay 
This is the time and place 
You are waiting for something you cannot have 

If this would be your last breath 
Would it change a thing? 
Dive head first into the fire 

If you just let me I'll find a way 
To ease your mind and for you to stay 
And I will untie your only ropes 
It's hard for me 

If you just let me I'll find a way 
To ease your mind and for you to stay 
And I will untie your only ropes 
It's hard for me, believe me, I'm trying
