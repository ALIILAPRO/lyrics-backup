		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You animal, you ungrateful
You cannibal, eat my soul
Impossible way to love you
Incredible love I show
Unstoppable situation
Decided by my control
Illusion, you feed me fiction
I'm still beggin' you, please don't go

Like antifreeze kill me sweetly
You chemical break me down
My albatross always with me
You, my cynical siren song
You animal got your pray now
You ravenous time to feed
Keep using your words to cut me
I'm your masochist make me bleed

Claw at my walls and I come when you cry
Oh no no you're never gonna love me
You're lickin' your chops and you howl with your eyes
Oh no no you're just like an animal
I love you
I need you
I want to

My enemy on your leash now
Teeth tearing my skin apart
The pain that you give becomes me

Break my heart
Chimera, you show no mercy
So savage, you're breathing fire
You vicious, enchanting monster
Fill my veins with cruel desire

Claw at my walls and I come when you cry
Oh no, no you're never gonna love me
You're lickin' your chops and you howl with your eyes
Oh no, no you're just like an animal
There's blood on your tongue when you kiss me goodbye
Oh no, no you're just like an animal
I love you
I need you
I want to

No!
No!
No!
No!
You're never gonna love me

You're lickin' your chops and you howl with your eyes
Oh no, no you're just like an animal
There's blood on your tongue when you kiss me goodbye 
Oh no, no you're just like an animal
I love you
I need you
I want to
Stop
