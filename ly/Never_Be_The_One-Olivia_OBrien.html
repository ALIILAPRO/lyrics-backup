		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never be the one

We're making out in your Sprinter
Holding me close, it was winter
I put Tame Impala on
You said you only knew one song
Travel the world just to see you
Smoking cigars at LouLou
All I got from that fight we had
Is the heart-shaped rock still in my bag

Always say we'll do it when we're older
But that day keeps getting closer
I don't want this to be over

I like the way
You'll never be the one who got away
Never be the one who had to stay
Never be the one, never be the one
I-I-I-I like the way you'll never be the one
Who broke my heart
We're never gonna let it get that far
Never be the one, never be the one

We need a knife for the tension
All of our friends keep mentioning
The way we love each other
But in what way? Friends or lovers?

Always say we'll do it when we're older
But that day keeps getting closer
I don't want this to be over

I like the way
You'll never be the one who got away
Never be the one who had to stay
Never be the one, never be the one
I-I-I-I like the way you'll never be the one
Who broke my heart
We're never gonna let it get that far
Never be the one, never be the one

I can't hate you
So that's why I can't date you
I hate how it sounds
I never say never but it's never for now

Who got away
Never be the one who had to stay
Never be the one, never be the one
I-I-I-I like the way you'll never be the one
Who broke my heart
We're never gonna let it get that far
Never be the one, never be the one

I-I-I-I like the way you'll never be the one
Who got away
Never be the one who had to stay
Never be the one, never be the one (never be the one)
Never be the one
