		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Blood red lips traced with a tongue they shine,
Cut thought a crowded room.
A look can say a lot sometimes
And so I take all my past attractions
And project on you.

Every disappointment's and mistake,
Some resentment from a one-night heartbreak.
My head is spinning
My hands go damp,
But still I force an introduction

And I ask you to dance.
You feel like home up against me so close,
Though we've just met tonight .
There's still so much that we still don't know,
But I'm fairly certain

That we just might work out right.
Then again it can all go up in flames,
And I'll take you down in the name of love.
But for now let's kiss hard,
Fuck the games.
All or nothing, it's written in blood

[Chorus]
On the way to the wedding,
Dressed in black, she said
"Sorry lover but you can't look back."
She says
"Oh no," she goes,
"Oh no," she goes
"Slow down baby or you're gonna explode."
On the way to the wedding,
Dressed in black, he said
"Sorry lover but you can't look back."
She says
"Oh no," she goes,
"Oh no," she goes
"Slow down baby keep your eyes on the road"

Soft wet skin, hairs raised, body tired;
And the sheets are across the floor.
You tell me that love don't last,
Drawing circles with your fingernails across my back.
As your lips form the words you won't say,

In the distance your favorite song plays.
I turn you over and look in your eyes,
Promise you that this is forever
Or till one of us dies.
You taste like tear stains

And could have beens,
But I love a good train wreck.
Your hair balled up inside my fist,
You tell me don't get too attatched
Like this is just entertainment.

Then again it could go up in flames,
And I'll take you down in the name of love.
Maybe one last kiss just to ease the pain
All or nothing it's written in blood

[Chorus: x 2]

On the way to the wedding (Oh no) [Repeat: x 7]

On the way to the wedding
