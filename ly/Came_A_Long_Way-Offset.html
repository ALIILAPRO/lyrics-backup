		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yes sir, know what I'm sayin'? Hey
Young nigga Metro, know what I'm sayin', make magic, know what I'm sayin'?
For the streets, know what I'm sayin'? Hey!

Came a long way from the choppa and the car (grah)
When I'm on the North they treat me like I'm Escobar (North)
I was kicking doors, never thought of being a star (hey)
Now I pull up in the Rolls with the baddest of them all (bad)
I pour a four, now I sittin' on Mars (Mars)
I lift the doors when I'm pullin' out garage (skrt)
You got exposed, rapping hard they pulled your card (who?)
We sellin' dope, never thought rapping would go far (dope)

I done exploded, turned rapping to an art (boom)
Swimmin' with the sharks (shark), trapping when it's dark (dark)
Better be smart (smart), money make a nigga aim at your body part (grah)
Money make a nigga change, make him lose his heart (change)
Me and Metro bring the pain then we top the charts (pain)
3400 Club Drive where we started
I was seventeen with a .15 carbon (grah)
I turned into a goblin (rah)
I was having dreams of getting rich off of robbin' (rob)
Fucked around, my grandma got sick couldn't solve it (who)
Two years later I got rich and I'm ballin' (woo)
Gotta keep that fire like my shadows it's gone follow me (fire)
I won't let this fame or these chains break my family (nah)
I was in them chains up in Vanguard settlement (chains)
Fuck it, put that ring on my main bitch, you stuck with me (fuck it)
I'ma call the gang, say my name, they gon' plug for me (rah)

Came a long way from the choppa and the car (grah)
When I'm on the North they treat me like I'm Escobar (North)
I was kicking doors, never thought of being a star (hey)
Now I pull up in the Rolls with the baddest of them all (bad)
I pour a four, now I sittin' on Mars (Mars)
I lift the doors when I'm pullin' out garage (skrt)
You got exposed, rapping hard they pulled your card (who?)
We sellin' dope, never thought rapping would go far (dope)

Real shit, did that real shit (real), in the field shit (real)
We ain't tryna kill shit (nah), pay my mama bill shit (mama)
Never miss a meal shit (woo)
Tryna pass through the cash through the generations (woo)
I've been meditating (meditatin')
Pressure what I'm facing (pressure)
Gotta get this paper, ain't no time for conversation (paper)
I'ma get some strain and I'ma pull up with the nation (strain)
Do you know the feeling you when you dodging shell cases (who?)
Get this shit on film, yeah my bitch is not a basic (nah)
We was in the bando, had it beatin' like the bases (bando)
Fuck her with a mask on, Freddy Krueger, Jason (mask)
Bullet-proof tint, President, don't leave no traces (Presi')
Drippin' in Balenciaga sock with no laces (drippin')
No I never flop, I do numbers like The Matrix (never)
Bitch, don't call the cops when this choppa get to baking (woo)
Pull up on the opps, then we chop 'em, then we rake 'em (opps)
Ain't no pump faking (nah)

Came a long way from the choppa and the car (grah)
When I'm on the North they treat me like I'm Escobar (North)
I was kicking doors, never thought of being a star (hey)
Now I pull up in the Rolls with the baddest of them all (bad)
I pour a four, now I sittin' on Mars (Mars)
I lift the doors when I'm pullin' out garage (skrt)
You got exposed, rapping hard they pulled your card (who?)
We sellin' dope, never thought rapping would go far (dope)
