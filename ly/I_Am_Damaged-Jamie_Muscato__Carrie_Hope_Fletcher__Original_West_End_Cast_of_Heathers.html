		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am damaged
But you're different
You're the one we oughta spare
God knows why you wanna save them
But you beat me fair and square

Please stand back now
'Little further
Don't know what this thing will do
Hope you miss me
Wish you'd kiss me
Then you'd know I worship you
I'll trade my life for yours

Oh, my God

And once I disappear

Wait, hold on

Clean up the mess down here

Not this way!

Our love is God
Our love is God
Our love is God
Our love is God

Say hi to God

Where have you been? Miss Fleming told us you'd killed yourself!

You look like hell

Yeah? I just got back

Veronica, what are you doing?
