		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're good at masquerading
The second that I came in
Face straight but legs a shaking
No business, too much pleasure
You can't keep it together
With an angel dressed in leather
When I say kinky I don't mean curls
When I say give me, I mean the world
When I say baby you bite your lip
I know exactly where you get your kicks
Because
Baby I'm giving you the mommy issues
Know I make you wish I put my body on you
Say you'd give me anything
When I call the shots, you call me
Walk into the room and you get mommy issues
The way I move makes you follow my rules
You want me to pull the strings
When I call the shots, you call me
Mommy
Mommy
When I call the shots, you call me
You say you want no other
Picture us under cover
I'll be your confidential lover
Oh, it's so entertaining
Yeah, you love trouble making
But I permit no misbehaving
When I say kinky I don't mean curls
When I say give me, I mean the world
When I say baby you bite your lip
I know exactly where you get your kicks
Because
Baby I'm giving you the mommy issues
Know I make you wish I put my body on you
Say you'd give me anything
When I call the shots, you call me
Walk into the room and you get mommy issues
The way I move makes you follow my rules
You want me to pull the strings
When I call the shots, you call me
M-O-M-M why are you acting shy?
M-O-M-M-Y
When I call the shots, you call me
M-O-M-M why are you acting shy?
M-O-M-M-Y
When I call the shots, you call me
Mommy
