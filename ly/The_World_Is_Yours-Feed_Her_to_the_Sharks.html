		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've come too far to turn back now
This is a song for the broken souls

It's time to rise up, take a stand
Break down the walls and face your fears
There is nothing about you that is ordinary

Get up kid, make a choice and
Turn this life around
You've come too far to turn back now
Erase all the memories of your past
Just let it go

I'm letting go of all my fears, I won't let this world defeat me
I'll walk this road for a thousand years until this heart stops beating

This world is in your hands
Rise up and take a stand

I will not lay down defeated
I will overcome my demons

You are alive, wake up from this dream
Make it reality, the only thing that stands in your way is yourself
You gotta make yourself believe, this possibility
Stand up and fucking scream, the world is yours

I'm letting go of all my fears, I won't let this world defeat me
I'll walk this road for a thousand years until this heart stops beating

Stand up
Stand up
Stand up and face your fears

Just know that you are never alone
Pick up the pieces, believe in yourself
You are not broken
You are the reason this life is beautiful

I'm letting go of all my fears
I won't let this world defeat me
The world is yours and we are free
So open your eyes and live this dream
