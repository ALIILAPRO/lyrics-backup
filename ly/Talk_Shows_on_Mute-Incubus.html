		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take a bow
Pack on powder
Wash em out with buzzing lights
Pay an au-
Dience to care
Impress me personality
Still intransfixed

The electric sheep are dreaming of your face
Enjoy you from
The chemical
Comfort of america
Come one come all
Into 1984
Ya 3 2 1
Lights! camera! transaction!

Quick your time
Is almost up
Make all forget that they're the moth
Edging in 
Toward the flame burn into obscurity
Still intransfixed
The electric sheep are dreamin up your fate

We judge you fom 
The card castle
Comfort of america
Come one come all
Into 1984
Ya 3 2 1 
Lights! camera! yeah!

Come one come all
Into 1984
Ya 3 2 1 
Lights! camera! transaction!
Lights! camera! transaction!
Oh

Come one come all
Into 1984
Ya 3 2 1 
Lights! camera! transaction!
Ho

Your foundation 
Is canyoning
Fault lines should be worn with pride
I hate to say it
Your so much more
Your so much more
Endearing with
The sound turned off
