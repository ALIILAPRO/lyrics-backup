		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry
You'd better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list, he's checking it twice
He's gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you are sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness' sake

Oh, you'd better watch out, you'd better not cry
You'd better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you are sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good, be good for goodness' sake

You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry
You'd better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town, to town

Yes he's on his way
He's got toys all over the sleigh
Santa is coming to town
