		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shall we beat this or celebrate it?
You're not the one to talk things through
You checked your texts while I masturbated
Manelich, I feel so used

Found myself on spencer's butte
Traced your shadow with my shoe
Empty outline changed my view
Now all of me thinks less of you

On the sheet I see your horizon
All of me pressed onto you
But in this light you look like poseidon
I'm just a ghost you walk right through

Saw myself on spencer's butte (all of me wants all of you)
The landscape changed my point of view (all of me wants all of you)
Revelation may come true (all of me wants all of you)
Now all of me thinks less of you (all of me wants all of you)

(All of me wants all of you)

(All of me wants all of you)

(All of me wants all of you)

(All of me wants all of you)
