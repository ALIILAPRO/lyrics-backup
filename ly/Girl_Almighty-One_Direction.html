		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Hey hey, oh no, no)

Her light is as loud as as many ambulances
As it takes to save a savior (whoa whoa whoa)

She floats through the room on a big balloon
Some say, "She's such a fake"
That her love is made up
No, no, no, no

Let's have another toast to the girl almighty
Let's pray we stay young
Stay made of lightning

Am I the only
Only believer?

There's something happening here

The only
Only believer

(There's something happening here)
(I hope you feel what I'm feeling, too)

I get down, I get down, I get down
On my knees for ya
I get down, I get down, I get down
On my knees
I get down on my knees for you

Her light is as loud as as many ambulances
As it takes to save a savior (whoa whoa whoa)

She floats through the room on a big balloon
Some say, "She's such a fake"
That her love is made up
No, no, no, no

Let's have another toast to the girl almighty

Let's pray we stay young
Stay made of lightning

Am I the only
Only believer?

There's something happening here

The only
Only believer

(There's something happening here)
(I hope you feel what I'm feeling, too)

I get down, I get down, I get down
On my knees for ya

I get down, I get down, I get down
On my knees
I get down on my knees for you
