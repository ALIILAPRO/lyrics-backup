		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My world was going under
I needed lotta lotta love, but got a doctor
And I'm out of control, yeah I'm out of control
And I'm out of control, yeah I'm out of control

He gave me pills, to forget i missed ya
Just take some more, more, more, and you'll be better
And I'm out of control, yeah I'm out of control
And I'm out of control, I'm out of control

They say i've got 123, some kind of abc
But that's all part of me
Hey, there's pills for that too

There's pills for heartache,
There's pills to fall in love to
Go ahead take a picture,
Oh I might as well be a statue
A tourist attraction,
I'll just stand there and smile
Blank as a paper,
But there'll be no ups and no downs


You bet I'm stoned, you got me started
And now I'm cold, cold, cold, I'm stone cold hearted
And I'm out of control, and I'm out of control.
Yeah I'm out of control, and I'm out of control.

They say i've got 123, some kind of abc.
But that's all part of me.
Hey, there's pills for that too.

There's pills for heartache
There's pills to fall in love too
Go ahead take a picture
Oh I might aswell be a statue
A tourist attraction
I'll just stand there and smile
Blank as a paper
There'll be no ups and no downs

Now here I am, I'm peeling off the stone
And, piece by piece, the layers falling off
I'm on my knees, and my lips kissing the dirt
If this is me
I love the way it hurts!
Yeah
I love the way it hurts!
I love the way it hurts!
I love the way it hurts!
I love the way it hurts!
Yeah
I love the way it hurts!
I love the way it hurts!
I love the way it hurts!
I love the way it hurts now



There's pills for heartache
there's pills to fall in love too
But I won't be takin' em
Hell no, I won't be statue
If you take a picture
I will stand there and smile
Because I want to
I'll have my ups and my downs
