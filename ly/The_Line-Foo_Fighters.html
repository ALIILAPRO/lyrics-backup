		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yes or no?
What is truth?
But a dirty black cloud coming out of the blue?
I was wrong
I was right
I'm a blood moon born in the dead of night

Break my bones
I don't care
All I ever wanted was a body to share
Heart's gone cold
Brush ran dry
Satellite searching for a sign of life
Like you

Somewhere?
Are you there?

The tears in your eyes
Someday will dry
We fight for our lives
'Cause everything's on the line
This time

Listen close
I can't hide
I'm a page torn from a broken spine
Sun gets low
I get high
Satellite searching for a sign of life
Like you

Somewhere?
Are you there?
The tears in your eyes
Someday will dry
We fight for our lives
'Cause everything's on the line
This time

Are you there?
Are you there?

The tears in your eyes
Someday will dry
We fight for our lives
'Cause everything's on the line
This time

The tears in your eyes
Someday will dry
We fight for our lives
'Cause everything's on the line

Yes or no?
What is truth
But a dirty black cloud coming out of the blue
I was wrong
I was right
I'm a blood moon born in the dead of night
