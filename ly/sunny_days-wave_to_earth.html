		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I've been waiting for this day, yeah
The way I'm walking hand in hand with you, yeah
Just like all the sunlight is watch over me, babe
Yes, it's full of your smile, yeah
I'll give it to you when I collect
Even the love in the air, yeah

The beautiful scenery of the streets
The chirping of birds is nothing without you
I'm nothing without you, hmm
Yeah, I'm nothing without you, oh
We melt this love and recreate it
As we imagine it
That's how we make sunny days, yeah
'Cause you're always mysterious to me

You are my golden age
Everything shines so bright
That my eyes go blind
Our youth never ages here

We melt this love and recreate it
As we imagine it
That's how we make sunny days, yeah
'Cause you're always mysterious to me
We melt this love and recreate it
As we imagine it
That's how we make sunny days, yeah
'Cause you're always mysterious to me
