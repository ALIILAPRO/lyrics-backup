		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You only call when the cup's empty
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You only call when your bed's empty
So do you ever think it's
Time we stop pretending
That these late nights don't leave us empty?
Empty, empty, yeah, yeah i don't wanna feel
Empty, empty, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So do you ever think it's
Time we stop pretending
That these late nights don't leave us empty?

Tell me what you want, tell me what you need
Used to love it when you'd call, now
I don't feel a thing
Another night, another one, 'nother repeat
Come kick it for awhile
Just to watch you leave
Done with shallow nights
I'm diving off the deep end
Tired of treading water, I'm moving forward
Tryna swim wanna feel something, baby
Cut the loose ends
I don't got the time to wait
For you to call again
Okay, I can tell you just want company
I can tell you don't mean a word you say
I'm looking for substance, you
Don't feel the same, no

You only call when the cup's empty
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You only call when your bed's empty
So do you ever think it's
Time, we stop pretending
That these late nights don't leave us empty?
Empty, empty, yeah, yeah i don't wanna feel
Empty, empty, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So do you ever think it's
Time, we stop pretending
That these late nights don't leave us empty?

I won't do this over again
Said at least a thousand times
That this was the end
And trust me, 'cause I swear to God
I'm not giving in
Nothing you could do to change
My mind about this, no
Baby, let's be honest
It ain't love if we're numb
I really need something deeper
Than what we've got when you hit me up and
I'm ignoring every call
Take it as a hint that I
Don't want to be involved
I'd rather be alone than be with you
You don't love me
You just hate sleeping alone
And, baby, we both know
We're not on the same page
So we need to go our separate ways

You only call when the cup's empty
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You only call when your bed's empty
So do you ever think it's
Time, we stop pretending
That these late nights don't leave us empty?
Empty, empty, yeah, yeah i don't wanna feel
Empty, empty, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So do you ever think it's
Time, we stop pretending
That these late nights don't leave us empty?
