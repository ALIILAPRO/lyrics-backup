		  My shirt off (shirt off)

I'm finna take my shirt off (shirt off)

We love to show off (come) everybody shirt off

I take my shirt off and all the hoes stop breathin'
I take my shirt off and all the hoes stop breathin'
I take my shirt off and all the hoes stop breathin'

So Icy Entertainment
God dammit I'm freezin'

My shirt off (Burr) 
My shirt off (Burr) 
My shirt off (Burr) 
My shirt off (Burr) 
My shirt off (Burr) 
My shirt off (Burr) 
My shirt off (Burr) 

My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)

F-r-e-n-c-h-i-e
I'm tatted up come find me
A hundred thou' so icy
We we poppin' bottles
Showin' thug love
If you act up in the club
Then you know we throwin' hollows
What it do partna'
Get to close I spark ya
My wrist inside the club is like a highlighted marker
On beats I'm a monster
So icy I sponsor
This Mary Jane got on the wall like Nina Parker
I'm bout to call Wakka
Tell him bring the chopper (blat)
Fuck seein' the doctor
He'll be screamin' like the opera
It's hot as hell, I gotta take off my shirt
My car, my girls love to wear skirts
The paint color look like dirt
No shirts in that 08' Vert

I take my shirt off and all the hoes stop breathin'
I take my shirt off and all the hoes stop breathin'
I take my shirt off and all the hoes stop breathin'

So Icy Entertainment
God dammit I'm freezin'

My shirt off (Burr) 
My shirt off (Burr) 
My shirt off (Burr) 
My shirt off (Burr) 
My shirt off (Burr) 
My shirt off (Burr) 
My shirt off (Burr) 

My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)

They say money doin' sumthin' to my ego
More money I see I'm getting tatted like amigo (yea)
White girl say she can sniff a brick a day
I tell her eat the cake, eat the cake, Anna Mae
Go go, you better clear the plate (yea)
She said I think I'm dead (why)
Cause I can't feel my face (yea)
And she think she gettin' dollars from the kid
All she get is hard dick, and she swallowin' my kids
I know they feelin' me 'cause I'm movin' like a G move
In my red in black skirt and her brand new Prada matchin' my Evisu
No wife beater so I'm showin' off my sleeveless
Art so I'm a call it goin' with the breezes

I take my shirt off and all the hoes stop breathin'
I take my shirt off and all the hoes stop breathin'
I take my shirt off and all the hoes stop breathin'
So Icy Entertainment
God dammit I'm freezin'

My shirt off (Burr) 
My shirt off (Burr) 
My shirt off (Burr) 
My shirt off (Burr) 
My shirt off (Burr) 
My shirt off (Burr) 
My shirt off (Burr) 

My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)

6-1 deep
No shirt no top (go)
White chain bright lane
VVS white rocks (blow)
I'm a work of art, mane
I'll crush your ice game
Thousand dollars lite, mane
Need to rob a dice game
Tatted like a white mane
Party like a rock band
That so icy bike game
Makin' lames tuck chains
Got damn Gucci Mane
You done did that shit again
Goin' knee deep in the earth so that you can have a chain
My body wrote on like an essay
But homie no Mexican
So Icy entertainment
You can write it on me mane
In the center of the stage with no tank top (no no)
For the block I'm showin' every tattoo I got (yea)

I take my shirt off and all the hoes stop breathin'
I take my shirt off and all the hoes stop breathin'
I take my shirt off and all the hoes stop breathin'

So Icy Entertainment
God dammit I'm freezin'

My shirt off (Burr) 
My shirt off (Burr) 
My shirt off (Burr) 
My shirt off (Burr) 
My shirt off (Burr) 
My shirt off (Burr) 
My shirt off (Burr) 

My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)
My shirt off (whoosh)
