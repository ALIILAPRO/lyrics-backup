		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  God bless she walks in her last winter

When innocence born, it is bound to be broken
The shadows appear and they darken the mind
Dying of fear, dying of knowing

How deep it cuts, enough is enough
Something's got to give
I know my mistakes

God bless she walks in her last winter
The halo 'round her head, it starts to linger
Her fear has died, her heart is still unbroken
There's no remorse, she doesn't mind
She bleeds out

God bless she walks in her last winter
The halo 'round her head, it starts to linger (she bleeds out)
Her fear has died, her heart is still unbroken
There's a voice inside of me getting louder, breaking free
She bleeds out
She bleeds out

Blessed are the ones, free of mind, free of hoping
To walk into worlds never seen, what's to come?
Your destiny is yours to be chosen

How deep it cuts, enough is enough
Something's got to give
I know my mistakes

God bless she walks in her last winter
The halo 'round her head, it starts to linger
Her fear has died, her heart is still unbroken
There's no remorse, she doesn't mind
She bleeds out

God bless she walks in her last winter
The halo 'round her head, it starts to linger (she bleeds out)
Her fear has died, her heart is still unbroken
There's a voice inside of me getting louder, breaking free
She bleeds out

I know my mistakes
God bless she walks in her last winter
The halo 'round her head, it starts to linger
Her fear has died, her heart is still unbroken
There's no remorse, she doesn't mind
She bleeds out, she bleeds out

There's a voice inside of me getting louder, breaking free
She bleeds out, she bleeds out
There's a voice inside of me getting louder, breaking free
She bleeds out, she bleeds out
