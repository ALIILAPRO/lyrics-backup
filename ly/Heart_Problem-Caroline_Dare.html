		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I guess that leaving you was something that I'm doing right
Cause everybody told me I was with the wrong guy
And I ignored them, didn't care about the warning signs
You were sweet to me, that's all that mattered, right
It cost me
My trust & all my sanity
Hush please
I don't need your excuses when you
Hurt me
I'm tired of being let down
Over & over & over again
I think you got a heart problem
You say you know better but you still mess up
Every time you try to love me it goes wrong
You should get it checked out
You should get it checked out
I think you got a heart problem
You say you'll be better but you don't step up
Every time you love me it's never enough
You should get it checked out
You should get it checked out
You confuse me everyday with what you do & say
Your head & heart don't match, they never seem to think the same
You say you're sorry but it just feels like a stupid game
Here's the funny part: I'm shattered in every way
It cost me
My trust & all my sanity
Hush please
I don't need your excuses when you
Hurt me
I don't deserve to be let down
Over & over & over again
I think you got a heart problem
You say you know better but you still mess up
Every time you try to love me it goes wrong
You should get it checked out
You should get it checked out
I think you got a heart problem
You say you'll be better but you don't step up
Every time you love me it's never enough
You should get it checked out
You should get it checked out
You can't
Pop in & out of my life like it's a convenience for you
I've run
Out of my chances I can't give you anymore
It's not fair to me
I gave you my all & you didn't
I gave you my all & you didn't
I gave you my all & you didn't
I think you got a heart problem
You say you know better but you still mess up
Every time you try to love me it goes wrong
You should get it checked out
You should get it checked out
I think you got a heart problem
You say you'll be better but you don't step up
Every time you love me it's never enough
You should get it checked out
You should get it checked out
