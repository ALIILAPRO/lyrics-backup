		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's keep on pretending
That we're nowhere
Creating everything as we go
Let's keep on going
Til we have no fear
We're lost in the sky,
We just don't care

Don't care
Yeah
Don't care
Yeah
Don't care

Don't care
Yeah
Don't care

We're lost in the sky
We just don't care

The sound will not come
Unless we get there
And changing all of us
As it grows 
Let's keep on going 
Until it becomes clear
We're lost in the sky
We just don't care

Don't care
Yeah
Don't care
Yeah
Don't care

Don't care
Yeah
Don't care

We're lost in the sky
We just don't care

Let's keep on pretending
That we're nowhere
Creating everything as we go
Let's keep on going
Til we have no fear
We're lost in the sky,
We just don't care

We're lost in the sky
We just don't care
