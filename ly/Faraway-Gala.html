		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's your name I hear
It's not my head's whid
Like the many tears I shed
It's your name I call
Your name I read
My prayer
My creed
It's your name I hate
Because I love you still
And I can't live this way
It's your name I keep
The only thing
You can't take away from me

I wanna hold you so...
Someday
I'm gonna dive in your eyes...
Deep cast
And I wanna please you so...
Please stay
And I won't lead you...
FARAWAY

Weo-weo-weo-we-he!
Weo-weo-weo-we-he!
Weo-weo-weo-we-e-eo..
Weo-weo-weo-we-he
Weo-weo-weo-we-he!
Weo-weo-weo-we-he!
Weo-weo-weo-we-e-eo..
Weo-weo-weo-we-he

It's your name I feel
The pact
I seal your name
It's your name I call
Under the sky
Salty like the tears I cried

It's your name I hate
Because I love you still
And I can't live this way
It's your name I keep
The only thing
You can't take away from me

I wanna hold you so...
Someday
I'm gonna dive in your eyes...
Deep cast
And I wanna please you so...
Please stay
And I won't lead you...
