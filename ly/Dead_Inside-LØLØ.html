		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sure I looked alright
Maybe on the outside
Baby I was fully dressed wearing a fake smile
Tank running empty from the last guy 
Until you gave me life 

Poison 
I was deadly 
Skin felt cold till you felt me 
I was heavy till you held me 
Until you gave me life 

I was dead inside
Till you made me feel alive
Your hands got me revived
Your lips help me survive 
You under my sheets you remind my heart to beat ya
I was dead inside till you

Made me feel alive
Made me feel alive
Made me feel alive

I was on the other side
I was so gone
Heard you through the flatline saying ‘baby hold on’
Something bout the way you said it made me wanna hold on 
Made me wanna hold on 

I was dead inside
Till you made me feel alive
Your hands got me revived
Your lips help me survive
You under my sheets you remind my heart to beat ya
I was dead inside till you

Made me feel alive
Made me feel alive
Made me feel alive

Something bout the way you say it
Something bout the way you say it
Something bout the way you say it makes me wanna hold on 

I was dead inside
Till you made me feel alive
Your hands got me revived
Your lips help me survive
You under my sheets you remind my heart to beat ya
I was dead inside till you

Made me feel alive
Made me feel alive
Made me feel alive
Made me feel alive
Made me feel alive
Made me feel alive
