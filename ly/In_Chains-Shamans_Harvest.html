		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Angel of death and mercy, come take me from this cage
'Cause these four walls and iron bars have been witness to the rage
Of a thousand broken hearts in chains
Like a cripple without his cane, a king without a crown
The passion that once consumed me
Has turned to ashes on the ground
All that I've been given I give it to you
I can't stand here watching you fail to tell the truth

Somebody break these chains
Wrapped around this heart
I don't want you leaving
I'm begging for mercy, oh to break these chains
Oh heaven help me now
Trade the shackles for a crown
And I'm on my way, way down

Warm the ice that fills my veins, pumping 'til I'm numb
Lead me out of the darkness where it is so hard to escape from
All that I've been given I give it to you
I can't stand here watching you fail to tell the truth

Somebody break these chains
Wrapped around this heart
I don't want you leaving
I'm begging for mercy, oh to break these chains
Oh heaven help me now
Trade these shackles for a crown
And I'm on my way, way down

Listen
Bless my heart and bless my soul
You can set my ass on fire
Mama, won't you call me a doctor?
'Cause my temperature's rising higher and higher
Dip me in that cold muddy water, I think I need to be saved
Unless someone breaks these chains

All that I've been given I give it to you
I can't stand here watching you fail to tell the truth

Somebody break these chains
Wrapped around this heart
I don't want you leaving
I'm begging for mercy, oh to break these chains
Oh heaven help me now
Trade the shackles for a crown
And I'm on my way
