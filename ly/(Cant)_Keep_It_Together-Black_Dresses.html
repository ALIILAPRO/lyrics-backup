		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If everything fit's into place
Seamlessly pieced together in the
Most terrible way
I couldn't keep it together
I couldn't make it last
I couldn't prove I was good
I wonder if anybody could
I can't keep it together
Nothing is meant to last for that long
But it doesn't make me feel better
To put it in a stupid song
I wonder if life is all
About just falling apart
And painfully becoming something else

Breaking down inside every day
Another day of hoping for something
That I can't say
Love confusion hopelessness pain
Just falling
Through a thousand differеnt lives
Of the same thing

I'm a pеrson inside a person inside a girl
I used to be a million different things
A million different dreams and hopes
But now I'm nothing
Splintered, fighting for control
Inside a shattered soul staring blankly
Frightened and all alone
Still moving forward
Broken down from everything
Did I do the right thing?
I wish I had the strength to be
Everything to everybody
I don't know what I need to be
Hopeless dreaming please take care of me
I know there's no more place for me
These ruined lives inside me scream

I couldn't keep it together
I couldn't make it last
I couldn't keep it together
But it's not that bad
