		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can be real with You
Say anything and not be afraid
You made me and You like what You made
You made me and You don't make mistakes
I can be real with You

You take me just as I am
You'd choose me all over again
I am the one You love
I am the one You love
I don't have to prove anything
There's room at Your table for me
I am the one You love
I am the one You love
It's me, it's me
The real me
It's me, it's me

I know You're proud of me
Even though I don't deserve it sometimes
No I'm not a perfect child
But I still make my Father smile
I know You're proud of me

You take me just as I am
You'd choose me all over again
I am the one You love
I am the one You love
I don't have to prove anything
There's room at Your table for me
I am the one You love
I am the one You love
You take me just as I am
You'd choose me all over again
I am the one You love, it's me
I am the one You love
I don't have to prove anything
There's room at Your table for me
I am the one You love
I am the one You love
It's me, it's me, it's me
The real me, oh
It's me, it's me, it's me
The one You see It's me

Your love, Your love never fails
Your love never fails
Your love, Your love never fails
Your love never fails
Oh no
Your love, Your love never fails
Your love never fails
I know it I've seen that
Your love, Your love never fails
Your love never fails
Oh no
Your love, Your love never fails
Your love (Your love never fails)
I've tasted and I've seen
Your love (Your love, Your love never fails)
(Your love never fails)
You keep loving me Your love
(Your love, Your love never fails)
(Your love never fails)
Me without performance
Your love (Your love, Your love never fails)
(Your love never fails)
Me without the talents Your love
Your love (Your love, Your love never fails)
(Your love never fails)
It's the real me, It's the real me
Your love (Your love, Your love never fails)
(Your love never fails)
While I was a sinner Christ loved me
(Your love, Your love never fails)
(Your love never fails)
Your
(Your love, Your love never fails)
(Your love never fails)

Woah ohh
You take me just as I am
You'd choose me all over again
I am the one (I am the one You love)
Even though it's what You know
I'm still the one You love
I don't have to prove anything, hey
There's room at Your table for me
I am the, hey (I am the one You love)
I am the one You love
I am the one You love
I am the one You love
I am the one You love

C'mon let's sing it
Your love Your
Your love, Your love never fails
Your (Your love never fails)
Woah no
(Your love, Your love never fails)
(Your love never fails)
I've seen it in my lowest valley
Your love (Your love, Your love never fails)
(Your love never fails)
I've seen it with my messy decisions
Your love, Your love (Your love, Your love never fails)
(Your love never fails)
Your love, Your love never fails
Your love never fails
Your love, Your love (Your love, Your love never fails)
(Your love never fails)
Oh, Your love (Your love, Your love never fails)
(Your love never fails)
I'm a testimony of Your love
Your love (Your love, Your love never fails)
(Your love never fails)
I'm a testimony
Oh I've tasted and I've seen
I'm a testimony
Your love, Your love never fails
Your love never fails
(Your love, Your love never fails)
(Your love never fails)
