		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hate it or love it
The underdog's on top
Can't see my guys as much
The block got hot and they want that drop
The music ting just popped
Just in time 'cause spot got hot
Stop dat, start dat, get that wop
Gotta take that risk and collect that

Hate it or love it
We're forced to grow up quick in the hood that I live in
There ain't no kidding
Love and hate a similar ting
You can hate or love me, there ain't no difference
It got hard, we made it work
I thought 'bout winnin', you thought 'bout quittin'
Somethin' in my mind told me it wasn't time to slide
Went back and aborted that mission
Flex got slapped with seven
'Cause he got caught in the kitchen slippin'
I held him down and sent some flowers
'Round to his missus
When she was trippin'
The phone was off
Show man the same love as if the phone was rippin'
A lot of man missin' as soon as my bro went jail and the O's stopped flippin'

Hate it or love it
The underdog's on top
Can't see my guys as much
The block got hot and they want that drop
The music ting just popped
Just in time 'cause spot got hot
Stop dat, start dat, get that wop
Gotta take that risk and collect that gwop

Hate it or love it
The underdog's on top
Can't see my guys as much
The block got hot and they want that drop
The music ting just popped
Just in time 'cause spot got hot
Stop dat, start dat, get that what
Gotta take that risk and collect that gwop

Hate it or love it
It can get awkward when these girls ask me
"What do you do for a living?"
They see the chain and get intrigued
I say I do music innit
When I touch the mic, I speak my mind
And that's when the truth start spillin'
My day one done me dirty
I still rock with him, I'm too forgivin'
But it don't get it twisted
I'll cut man off and I'll keep it movin'
I'm anti-social, my people skills, they need improving
You see your own people moving snakey
When they don't feel included
But me and mine are fine if I'm eatin' food, they're eatin' too

Hate it or love it
The underdog's on top
Can't see my guys as much
The block got hot and they want that drop
The music ting just popped
Just in time 'cause spot got hot
Stop dat, start dat, get that wop
Gotta take that risk and collect that gwop

Hate it or love it
The underdog's on top
Can't see my guys as much
The block got hot and they want that drop
The music ting just popped
Just in time 'cause spot got hot
Stop dat, start dat, get that wop
Gotta take that risk and collect that gwop

Hate it or love it
