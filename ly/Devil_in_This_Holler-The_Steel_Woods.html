		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I get here early and I go home late
Lately, what seems like every day
I keep my head up till I stop to pray 
At the top of the hill is a sacred place

But down in the valley is where I roam 
With these faded memories and half written songs
And just when it seems that nothing else could go wrong
That's when I'm reminded we're not alone
 
There's a devil in this holler
There's evil in these hills 
I'm just trying to make a dollar cause I've got to pay my bills 
There might be gold on this mountain but there's fire on the ground
Yeah there's a devil in this holler but he ain't gonna pull me down
 
I throw my hand up when I'm driving in
Speak to the ones that ask me how I've been
By the time that I leave I'm tired and in pain
I put the pedal to the floor on my way home to beat the train
I find my pride at the end of the day
My kids and my bride are why I live this way 
Hand in hand at the table 
Thank God for one more night
If I wake up in the morning I'll be ready for the fight
 
There's a devil in this holler
There's evil in these hills 
I'm just trying to make a dollar cause I've got to pay my bills 
There might be gold on this mountain but there's fire on the ground
Yeah there's a devil in this holler but he ain't gonna pull me down
 
There's a devil in this holler
There's evil in these hills 
I'm just trying to make a dollar cause I've got to pay my bills 
There might be gold on this mountain but there's fire on the ground
Yeah there's a devil in this holler but he ain't gonna pull me down
Yeah there's a devil in this holler but he ain't gonna pull me down
