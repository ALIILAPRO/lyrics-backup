		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was looking for a change of scene
You were looking at a magazine
It was red carpets and limousines
And the grass seemed so much greener
All we wanted was to get there fast
So, we packed up everything we had
Running on hope and a tank of gas
Like dreams ain't just for dreamers
We couldn't wait to leave that life behind
Trying to find salvation in that city limit sign

And one of those LA nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out and shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out

Everybody's somebody someday
Everybody's got a part to play
Everybody's trying to find a way
To say, what needs saying
Everybody's got a friend of a friend
Somebody that can get you in
Begging angels for a sin
In the game that we're all playing
You and I, we're gamblers holding cards that we can't see
And I'm betting on you and you're betting on me

And one of those LA nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out and shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out

Down on the freeway, the sun is out of sight
And I got a feeling tonight might be the night
Yeah, tonight might be the night

One of those LA nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out and shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out
When the stars come out, oh
When the stars come out
