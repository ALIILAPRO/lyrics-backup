		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I knew I loved you that Halloween
When I saw you and I got mad
You came in with someone that wasn't me
And I've never felt pain that bad
So I cried in my car, at the liquor store
And I almost relapsed

We were friends but I wanted more
I was hoping you wanted me back
And you met me for coffee at my favorite place
Right by the railroad tracks
You touched my hand and you felt insane
Our hearts didn't cut us no slack
You never get over a love like that

I first kissed you in that parking lot
In a car you don't have anymore
We had our chance, we missed our shot
I packed up and I left for tour

I said I love you and I always will
And you told me there's no take-backs
I got lost on the stage, on the road and some thrills
I came home feeling like trash
You never get over a pain like that

I won't forget you leaving work
Just to come lay in my bed
I kissed every inch of your pretty skin
Traced the tattoo on your back
You never get over a love like that
I'll never get over a love like that
Tell me that you still love me like that

I knew I love you on that Halloween
When I saw you and I got mad
