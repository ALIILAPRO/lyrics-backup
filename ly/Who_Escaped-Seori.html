		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, you should hurry
They don't wait 
If that made you hopeless
You can breathe 
By my side 
By my side

They say
"Should be busy
On this planet
Be aware and keep alerts
All the time to survive"
We get alive

Don't you know, we fight and leave and lost my way 
And I just used to know
Maybe it started and
You'll know when you open your eyes

We are living in the war
How far were we lying?
We are living in the war
Who will listen to your prayers?
We are living in the war
