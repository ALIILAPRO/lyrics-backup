		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your favorite band
Is back on the road
And this fall they're playing
The Hollywood Bowl
I've already purchased two seats for their show
I guess I'm an optimist

2011
You stole my heart here
And I couldn't listen
To that band for years
'Til that night last summer
When you reappeared
Forgot how bad I wanted this

If I could see the future
I never would believe her
Falling in and out of love and falling in again
We were never any good at being friends

When Harry Met Sally
And you fell asleep
I closed your computer
And stole the top sheet
I was strung out in Austin
For nearly a week
Anxiety like we were kids

I've been thinking too much
And it's ruined my nights
But it's hard when it isn't
To let yourself slide
And my heart doesn't slow down
When you kill the lights
I never learned to call it quits

If I could see the future
I never would believe her
Falling in and out of love and falling in again
We were never any good at being friends

I'll go hungry and crazy and honest for you
I don't always get angry but I'm promising to
If it's all that you want then it's all that I can do
Desire never made any sense
I'll wait for years but I won't wait alone
And then someday you'll wait for my face on your phone
And I'll call and I'll say I think you should come home
'Cause I'm tired of being your ex

Can I take you out
To a concert six months from now?
