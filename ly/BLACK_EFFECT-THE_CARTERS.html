		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you tell us about love?
Hmm, well, there's love of children
Love of self
Love of God
Love of a partner
And all of them have a different shape
But all of them is the same in the end
It's about sensitivity, it's about passion
It's about unconditional giving of self to another person
And there's love of humanity
That's the love that is right now needed most
Love of humanity
But in everything, in all of that love, there is a soul
It's like when you take some eggs and break them
And you, and you take the shells and mix them up
Trying to find the ones that match
When you find the perfect match
That compatibility results in passion
Results in unconditional giving of self
I hope I can say that again

Yeah, yeah
I'm good on any MLK Boulevard
I'm good on any MLK Boulevard
See my vision with a TEC, bitch, I'm Malcolm X
Haters dreadin' my effect, they want that Das EFX
Get your hands up high like a false arrest
Let me see 'em up high, this is not a test
Yes, put 'em up, this is not a test
Now hands where I can see them, fuck a false arrest

This Off-White fit that I rock, shit permanent
The fro that I grow got no perm in it
Hmm, a nigga late but he best dressed
Got slowed down by the weight of my necklaces
Parked the Lexus in the projects, bitch, I'm reckless
Extra magazine, hopped on a jet with my Ebony chick
Blacker than the Essence fest
The behind the back pass is so effortless
LeBron James to you Omaroses
Dapper Dan at 4AM, shit, I am the culture
I made my own waves so now they anti-Tidal
I'm livin' the no sock life to spite you
Since the Kalief doc, they've been at my neck
Y'all can tell 'em Trayvon is comin' next
The SEC, the FBI, or the IRS
I pass the alphabet boys like an eye test

Yeah, yeah
I'm good on any MLK Boulevard (I'm good)
I'm good on any MLK Boulevard (he good)
See my vision with a TEC, bitch, I'm Malcolm X (I'm Malcom X)
Haters dreadin' my effect, they want that Das EFX (yeah)
Get your hands up high like a false arrest
Let me see 'em up high, this is not a test
Yes, put 'em up, this is not a test
Put your hands where I can see them, fuck a false arrest

Higher, higher
Higher, higher
Higher, higher
Higher, higher
Higher

I'm good any way I go, any way I go (go)
I pull up like the Freedom Riders, hop out on Rodeo
Stunt with your curls, your lips, Sarah Baartman hips
Gotta hop into my jeans like I hop into my whip, yeah
Mobbin' in a hoodie like Melo
Come up out that pretty motherfucker like, "hello, Hello"
I will never let you shoot the nose off my Pharaoh, yeah (yeah)

I like purple and Purple Rain
Tryna put red and blue together, bitch, that's on gang
These people tryna get me out the paint
'Cause I cook collard greens and yams better than your aunt
Man, we started with a mustard seed
Now we in the gray 911 with the mustard seats
Sheesh, matte black Puma jet
Shining my light on the world just like "UMI Says"
Got the Richard Mille, all colors
Might hit you with the rose gold all summer
For the culture
They even biting cornrows, put your scarecrows up
I come from the finest crop
Tell 'em the god's on road, watch 'em line the block
The Chitlin' Circuit is stopped
Now we in stadiums, eighty thou' a wop, (yeah) watch

I'm good on any MLK Boulevard (he good)
I'm good on any MLK Boulevard (he good)
See my vision with a TEC, bitch, I'm Malcolm X (I'm Malcom X)
Haters dreadin' my effect, they want that Das EFX
Get your hands up high like a false arrest
Let me see 'em up high, this is not a test
Yes, put 'em up, this is not a test
Now hands where I can see 'em, fuck a false arrest

I know I've only come half the way
But look in the mirror, I see an older me
Not realizing all the years that passed away
But I know I've only come half the way
