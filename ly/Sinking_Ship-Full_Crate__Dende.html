		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't believe I found you
In the middle of these winding roads
Can't believe I found you
And the time is not enough, it hurts
Can't believe I found love, again, again
It seems more like it found us
And I feel it's coming to an end

But I got it
No money can buy what we could be 
It cost too much, time to build and grow that trust
That's what left me in the dust
Packed my bags in search of us
You're my muse, been for months
High of love, running on fumes
Baby, baby

Something keep holdin' on, we been having fun
Even though we know we can't have it
All we do is fall deeper
In the ocean keep sinking on
We both know our ship is going down
We both know the ship is going down, 'own, 'own
Know the ship is going down

And your creator got it all right
In my dream I had you outlined (ooh)
I had to love and let it go
Let it fly by (fly by)
Maybe I put my insecurities on you, I
I guess I really wasn't ready for your true love
We drove fast in slow motion

But I got it
No money can buy what we could be 
It cost too much, time to build and grow that trust
That's what left me in the dust
Packed my bags in search of us
You're my muse, been for months
High of love, running on fumes
Baby, baby

Something keep holdin' on, we been having fun
Even though we know we can't have it
All we do is fall deeper
In the ocean keep sinking on
We both know our ship is going down
We both know the ship is going down, 'own, 'own
Know the ship is going down

Damn
