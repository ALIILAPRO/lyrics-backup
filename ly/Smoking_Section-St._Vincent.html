		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I sit in the smoking section
Hopin' one rogue spark will land in my direction
And when you stomp me out, I scream and I'll shout
"Let it happen, let it happen, let it happen"

And sometimes I feel like an inland ocean
Too big to be a lake, too small to be an attraction
And when you wander in and start to flail a bit
I let it happen, let it happen, let it happen

Sometimes I stand with a pistol in hand
I fire at the grass just to scare you right back
And when you won't run, I'm mad, but I succumb
Let it happen, let it happen, let it happen

And sometimes I go to the edge of my roof
And I think I'll jump just to punish you
And if I should float on the taxis below
No one will notice, no one will know

And then I think
What could be better than love, than love, than love?
And then I think
What could be better than love, than love, than love?

It's not the end, it's not the end
It's not the end, it's not the end
It's not the end, it's not the end
It's not the end, it's not the end
It's not the end, it's not the end
It's not the end, it's not the end
