		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What the hell am I? 
Thousand eyes, a fly 
Lucky then I'd be 
In one day deceased 

Sickman, sickman, sickman 
I can feel the wheel, but I can't steer 
When my thoughts become my biggest fear 
Ah, what's the difference, I'll die 

In this sick world of mine 
What the hell am I? 
Leper from inside 
Inside wall of peace 
Dirty and diseased 
Sickman, sickman, sickman, sickman 
I can see the end is getting near 
I won't rest until my head is clear 

Ah, what's the difference, I'll die 
In this sick world of mine 
Yeah, though I walk through the valley of rape and despair 
Can you see the end? 
Choke on me my friend 

Must to drown these thoughts 
Purity over rot 
Ah, ah, ah

What the hell am I?
Worn eroded pride
Saddened ten miles wide
I'm gonna let it slide

Sickman, Sickman, sickman, sickman

I can feel the wheel but I can't steer
When my thoughts become my biggest fear
Ah, what's the difference I'll die
Oh, in this sick world of mine

Ah, ah, ah
