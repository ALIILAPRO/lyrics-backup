		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, mister policeman
I don't want no trouble
I just wanna drop my jiggelin' down to the floor
Hey, mister policeman
Why you wanna holla at me?
I just wanna drop my jiggelin' down to the floor

No arrest badman mind ya bizz
(No arrest badman mind ya bizz)
No arresta baddaman mind ya business
Down to the floor

(Bring 'em down)

(No arrest badman mind ya bizz)
(No arresta baddaman mind ya business)

Hey, mister policeman
I don't want no trouble
I just wanna drop my jiggelin' down to the floor
Hey, mister policeman
Why do you wanna holla at me?
I just wanna drop my jiggelin' down to the floor

No arrest badman mind ya bizz
(No arrest badman mind ya bizz)
No arresta baddaman mind ya business?
Down to the floor

(Bring 'em down)

(Bring 'em down)

No arrest badman mind ya bizz
No arresta baddaman mind ya business
(No arresta baddaman mind ya business)

Hey, mister policeman
Leave her alone
Mek she whine mash up the town
Look how she sexy, look how she round
Give her the whining crown
Her body illegal, her whining illegal
Her style is so lethal, yeaaa
She ain't a regular kind a gyal
Ya! Yea! Yea!

Hey, mister policeman
I don't want no trouble
I just wanna drop my jiggelin' down to the floor
Hey, mister policeman
Why do you wanna holla at me?
I just wanna drop my jiggelin' down to the floor

No arrest badman mind ya bizz
(No arrest badman mind ya bizz)
No arresta baddaman mind ya business?
Down to the floor

(Bring 'em down)

(Bring 'em down)

No arrest badman mind ya bizz
(No arresta baddaman mind ya business)
No arresta baddaman mind ya business
(No arresta baddaman mind ya business)

So I hit the road and end up in a yardy party
Baby was moving like like a naughty shorty
Need discipline, she need discipline
Need to put her on a lockdown no visiting (Bring 'em down)
Handcuffs maintain the connection
Dis baton is a rod of correction
Discipline, she need discipline
Need to put her on a lockdown no visiting

(No arresta baddaman mind ya business)
(No arrest baddaman mind ya) (Bring 'em down)
(No arrest baddaman mind ya business)
(No arresta baddaman mind ya)

(Bring 'em down)
