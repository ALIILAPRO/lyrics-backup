		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Further down this road
Where is it we are leading the generation we know?
The answers lie down inside the mind of humanity
Its a vast, dark sea
Will we fall forever alone, down in this unknown abyss?
Where we fail is thinking our worth is something much more than this
Hold your breath we're sinking down for miles in an ocean
Full of mortal mistake, where the light is much clearer
Is it time to purge our lungs amongst the shipwreck?
Further we lower us down
The walls are closing in
We're cluttering
All that is meant for us is lost
So bite your tongue
Can we search a little deeper for what our actions will cost
Will we fall forever alone, down in this unknown abyss?
Where we fail is thinking our worth is something much more than this
Hold your breath we're sinking down for miles in an ocean
Full of mortal mistake, where the light is much clearer
Is it time to purge our lungs amongst the shipwreck?
Further we lower us down
We set our feeble minds on the bullshit,
Will we ever escape from where the light is much clearer
Is it time to purge our lungs amongst the shipwreck?
Further we lower us down
Can we find a place where we finally can think for ourselves?
Our thoughts are unspoken
We can fly, yes, we can soar
Staring in the face what we choose to accept, but can't ignore 
(Out thoughts are unspoken)
Life is knocking at your door
This is calling to the human race
We are alone the more we segregate
And I won't be part of this in the end
Hold your breath we're sinking down for miles in an ocean
Full of mortal mistake, where the light is much clearer
Is it time to purge our lungs amongst the shipwreck?
Further we lower us down
We set our feeble minds on the bullshit,
Will we ever escape from where the light is much clearer
Is it time to purge our lungs amongst the shipwreck?
Further we lower us down
