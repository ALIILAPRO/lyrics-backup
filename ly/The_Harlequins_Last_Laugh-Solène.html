		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look at you
Hypnotizing with your glance and
Purple suit
That's blinding me with flash
Cause you're a pretty boy
And I'm a good girl with bad taste
And your food
Seems pretty sweet to me
Baby you're a snake
I'm addicted to your venom
As I shake
Begging in the street
Like that's where I belong
As you throw me on the concrete
Bleeding green
Laughing as you leave
Now you're gone
I gotta get over you
I gotta get over you now
I gotta get over you
But I just can't get it
Pretty boy
You're a devil with a big grin
Hella coy
Smiling as you sin
And baby I'm a clown
Always laughing while you hurt me
And hold me down
Painting hearts along my cheeks
Til I scream
And get ejected from your circus
Violently
The curtains close on me
But baby you're a joke
And I'm a lucky leading lady
It's my show now
And you were just the tease
Yeah
I gotta get over you
I gotta get over you now
I gotta get over you
But I just can't get it
Now you're gone
I gotta get over you
Yeah
I said you're gone now
Now you're gone now
Now you're gone now
Now now now
Yeah-ah-ah
Now you're gone
Now you're
Gone
