		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walkin' around
All over town
Walkin' it out, when you want to
Soldiering my stylus, smiling
Turn it into whatever I choose and
Take me now to the water

Don't be late, I hear it's
Gonna be so very great and
Out the door, I'm a-walkin' like a runaway
All the reasons that I count up
You can't haul away, and
More and more, I'm a-walkin' like a runaway

Kick it around
Stare at the ground
Breakin' it down, when you want to
Soldiering, my days are chosen
Dance around, do whatever I want to
Take me now, it's the water

Don't be late, I hear it's
Gonna be so very great and
Out the door, I'm a-walkin' like a runaway
All the reasons that I count up
You can't haul away, and
More and more, I'm a-walkin' like a runaway

I think I know
Everything you're gonna say
I think you know
Why I wanna runaway

Don't be late, I hear it's
Gonna be so very great and
Out the door, I'm walkin' like a runaway
All the reasons that I count up
You can't haul away, and
More and more, I'm a-walkin' like a runaway

Don't be late, I hear it's
Gonna be so very great and
Out the door, I'm walkin' like a runaway
All the reasons that I count up
You can't haul away, and
More and more, I'm a-walkin' like a runaway

All the reasons that I count up
You can't haul away, and
More and more, I'm a-walkin' like a runaway
More and more, I'm a-walkin' like a runaway
Out the door, I'm a-walkin' like a runaway
