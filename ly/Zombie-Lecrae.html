		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say blessed, say blessed, say blessed
Yeah

I was like a zombie
'Til I was awakened
Chasin' all the Barbies
Tryna get the bacon
Pull up in a new toy
Feelin' like a rude boy
Always acting brazy but my heart feel like a chew toy (chew toy)

Runnin' with my dogs, catchin' plays (catchin' plays)
Take you on a trip down memory lane (memory lane)
Pullin' pistols (pistols), stealin' mama's liquor (liquor)
Seventeen, I think I fell in love with a stripper (bah)
Snortin', sippin', smokin' 'til I'm blown away (blown away)
Granny told me, "Wait on God, He on the way" (on the way)
Walkin' dead, I'm on the ledge and praying I don't fall off
Spirit interferin', now the new me 'bout to go off

In the dark, yeah, I was in the dark, I swear you couldn't tell me nothing
I was after flesh, I guess I was some type of zombie
Demons used to haunt me
Then I heard the voice of God, I'm grateful Jesus called me

I was like a zombie
'Til I was awakened
Chasin' all the Barbies
Tryna get the bacon
Pull up in a new toy
Feelin' like a rude boy
Always acting brazy but my heart feel like a chew toy

I was like a zombie
Zombie, zombie
Zombie, zombie
I was like a zombie
Zombie, zombie
Zombie, zombie

It was dark deep within my heart, I wasn't livin'
Mama stressed thinkin' I was next, they gon' get him
Coulda died, coulda slipped, yeah
Took a ride to the pen, yeah
Granny prayers hella lit, yeah
Aunt Shirley said I was gifted
Runnin' 'round with my slime
Throwin' up my gang sign
Police came to arrest me
Blockin' all of my blessings
Hit the club, shorty told me I was young but
I told her I'ma need a babysitter if she want to

I was in the dark, yeah
I was in the dark, I swear you couldn't tell me nothing
I was after flesh, I guess I was some type of zombie
Demons used to haunt me
Then I heard the voice of God, I'm grateful Jesus called me

I was like a zombie
'Til I was awakened
Chasin' all the barbies
Tryna get the bacon
Pull up in a new toy
Feelin' like a rude boy
Always acting brazy but my heart feel like a chew toy

I was like a zombie
Zombie, zombie
Zombie, zombie
I was like a zombie
Zombie, zombie
Zombie, zombie
