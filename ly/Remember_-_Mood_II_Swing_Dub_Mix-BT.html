		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know how you feel 
I'm feeling it too 
I hold my heart, I dream of you 
I see your face, I feel it too 
Searching skies 
I need you 
I miss you 

Take this and hold 
My love for you 
In separate times we think as two 
In paradise I'll drown in you 
Still searching skies 
I need you 
I want you 

I know how you feel 
I'm feeling it too 
I hold my heart, I dream of you 
I see your face, I feel it too 
Searching skies 
I need you 
I miss you 

Take this and hold 
My love for you 
In separate times we think as two 
In paradise I'll drown in you 
Still searching skies 
I need you 
I want you 

I love you, love you 
I love only you, love you
Remember me near 
There may be times when it's not right 
For me to be there 
But remember me near 
Remember me near 
There may be times when it's not right 
For me to be there 
But remember me near 

Searching for strength 
Can I face this day? 
Blinded by your love we stay 
You're always there - you're in my head 
Still chasing skies 
I need you 
Oh, I miss you 

Just love you, only you, only you

I love you, I love you 
I love only you, love you 

Remember me near 
There may be times when it's not right 
For me to be there 
But remember me near 
Remember me near 
There may be times when it's not right 
For me to be there 
But remember me near
