		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've had it with this damn double vision
My hand's swollen, I can't keep holding on
My heart's sinking and stuck in deadly rhythm
I can't fake it, I can't, can't brush it off

Love, love is dangerous
Love, love is so dangerous

I'm back at it, I just don't seem to listen
I see your lips, I just can't hear the sound
It's all static, just like my television
Her skill's sharp and her eyes cut through the clouds

(I need) love, love is dangerous (hard times, don't be fooled when she says it's)
Love, love is so dangerous (we'll betray the one we care about)
Love (what's left to care about?)
Love is so dangerous (love's cruel so we all pretend to fuck)
Love, love is dangerous

(I need) love, love is dangerous (hard times, don't be fooled when she says it's)
Love, love is so dangerous (we'll betray the one we care about)
Love (what's left to care about?)
Love is so dangerous (love's cruel so we all pretend to fuck)
Love, love is dangerous
