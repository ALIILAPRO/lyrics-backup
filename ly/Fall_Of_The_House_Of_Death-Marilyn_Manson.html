		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We've only reached the third day of a seven day binge
I can already see your name disintegrated from my lips
We've only reached the third day of a seven day binge
I can already see your name disintegrated from my lips

I can't decide if you wear me out or wear me well
I just feel like I'm condemned to wear someone else's hell
We've only reached the third day of a seven day binge
I can already see your name and disintegrated from my lips

I got bullets
In the booth
Rather be your victim, than be with you

I got bullets
In the booth
Rather be your victim, than to be with you, oh

I've reached the third day of a seven day binge
I can already see your name disintegrated from my lips

Rather be your victim, than to be with you, oh oh oh
