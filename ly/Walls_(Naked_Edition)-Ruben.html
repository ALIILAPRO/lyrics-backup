		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've always been a part of these cool kids
I don't know pain the way that you know it
Now, just hear me out

Born as a boy I'm taught not to feel, so
I only found a way to suppress it all
My walls are tall

But the wind has changed
My walls are weakening
They're gonna fall soon
And I'm gonna need you

It's been night for days
And I don't feel the same
They're gonna fall soon
And I'm gonna need you

I'm gonna need you
Yeah, yeah
I'm gonna need you

I haven't hit the ground 'til i do it
I'm not a mess unless you can see the scars
I've heard it all

But you need to understand I don't do this
See I'm a brick away and I had one call
I need you now

'Cause the wind has changed
My walls are weakening
They're gonna fall soon
And I'm gonna need you

It's been night for days
And I don't feel the same
They're gonna fall soon
And I'm gonna need you

I'm gonna need you
Yeah, yeah
I'm gonna need you
I'm gonna need you
Yeah, yeah
I'm gonna need you


I'll need you around, when the wind has quiet down, baby
I'll need you around, when the wind has quiet down
I'll need you around, when the wind has quiet down, baby
I'll need you around, when the wind has quiet down

I'm gonna need you
Yeah, yeah
I'm gonna need you
I'm gonna need you
Yeah, yeah
I'm gonna need you
