		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How long will this take?
How much can I go through?
My heart, my soul aches
I don't know what to do
I bend, but don't break
Somehow I'll get through
Cause I have You

[Chorus]
And if I had to crawl
Well You'd crawl too
I stumble and I fall
Carry me through
The wonder of it all
Is You see me through

Oh Lord, where are you?
Do not forget me here
I cry in silence
Can you not see my tears

When all have left me
And hope has disappeared
You'll find me here

[Chorus]

[Repeat: x2]
When everything I was is lost
I have forgot where you have not
When I am lost
You have not lost me

You have not lost me

[Chorus]
