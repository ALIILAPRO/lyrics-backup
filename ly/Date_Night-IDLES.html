		  Date night
Date night

Patience, I've got no goddamn patience
But I tried to shake shake shake it up
But I shook myself to boredom

Best friend, I do not like your best friend
And all those shades of grey
They turn my blood so cold, cold, cold, cold

When it comes around
We barely scream or shout
Or rarely am I there
And neither of us care

'Cause I I I I I
Guess we was born to fail
I I I I I
Guess we was born to fail

No, no, no you don't
Not a-fucking-gain
With your rhyme and your reason
And your cause

Shepherd, you want to be a shepherd?
Well good for you, go ahead
Your life won't be so tepid

But when it comes around
We barely scream or shout
And rarely am I there
And neither of us care

'Cause I I I I I
Guess we was born to fail
I I I I I
Guess we was born to fail

Yak yak heart attack
Sat in a taxi all clad in black
Yak yak heart attack
Sat in a taxi all clad in black

I I I I I never lie easy
I'm from the migrant crew
I don't live in a menagerie
I don't give a fuck about me or you

'Cause I'm so cold (I'm so cold)
I'm so cold (so cold)
I'm so cold (so cold)
I'm so cold (so cold)

'Cause I I I I I
Guess we was born to fail
I I I I I
Guess we was born to fail

I I I I I (I I I I I)
I I I I I (I I I I I)
I I I I I (I I I I I)
I I I I I I I I (I I I I I)

Yes, no
Yes, no
Yes, no
