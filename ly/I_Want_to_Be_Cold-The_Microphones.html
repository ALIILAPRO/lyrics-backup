		  I WANT TO BE COLD

It’s raining on me and I don’t want it to stop.
I don’t want to breathe anymore.
I want soggy ground.
I want to feel my feet in the sand.
I want water to rise and cover all the land.
I want to swim until my arms give out and
I come to an end.
I hope it happens soon.
I can’t deal with feeling this bad.
I want to be cold and I want it to snow so bad.
I hope your flames don’t grow.
I want to be buried in snow.
I hope your flames don’t grow.
I just want to be cold
I don’t want you to know.
