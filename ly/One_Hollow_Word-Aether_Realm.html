		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In a world where I can’t seem to catch my breath

With the fear and the doubt weighing on my chest

Tears in the fading light

And a glimpse through the fog where we’ve been confined

A glimpse of the other side

 

The soul may depart

But the light in our hearts

Lets your memory echo forever

 

In the coldest nights

In the darkest times

We will carry your memory forth

When the north wind bites

By the moon’s dim light

Look skyward and remember

You spirit of adventure carries on

 

When the search for a meaning’s left me cold

And these aching bones feel old

It’s the memory of brighter days

That takes my hand and lights the way

It fills me with hope

Anywhere that I go

 

In the coldest nights

In the darkest times

We will carry your memory forth

When the north wind bites

By the moon’s dim light

Look skyward and remember

You spirit of adventure carries on

 

A soul in moments from flesh unbound

The hand of chaos from high reached down

Another relic from life it stole

The hand of chaos exacts its toll

 

And there’s nothing I could say that’ll make things right

But I can put the notes together in a way you’d like

Try to match them with a phrase that reminds me of you

And try to make you proud

 

And there’s nothing I could say that’ll make things right

But I can put the notes together in a way you’d like

And look up to the skies and remember

And try to make you proud
