		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I'll go on a walkabout
And find out what it's all about
And that ain't hard
Just me and my own two feet
In the heat I've got myself to meet

A detective of perspective
I need to try and get a bigger eye, open wide
Blood wood flowers in my gaze
Walkabout in a sunny daze
To me now
On a walkabout

You could do it in the city
You could do it in a zone
You could do it in the desert
You could do the unknown
On a walkabout

High desert skies, are what I spy
So fly, you've got to wonder why
The stingrays must be fat this year
Moving slow in my lowest gear

The digeridoo original, man with a dream
I believe the Aborigine
On a walkabout

You could do it with a shuffle
You could do it with a stroll
You could do it with a stride
You could do the unknown
On a walkabout

A walk could cure almost all my blues
Bare feet or in my two shoes
One, two

I think I'll go on a walkabout
Find out what it's all about, can't hurt to try
Use your legs to rock it wide
Take a ride to the other side
