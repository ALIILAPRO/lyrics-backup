		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Noticing the way you look at me
Can't deny this kinda chemistry, you know
Hoping and wishing we are meant to be
Are you looking for a girl like me tonight?

Martinis at the bar
Kissing in the back of your car
Love on the radio
Hoping you're gonna take me home
Better make your move on me
Dripping soft cherry ice cream
Slow motion on the beach
Baby, put your hands on me

Boy, can we go there?
You know we're more than just friends
I gotta know this
Oh, are we falling in love? Oh

Noticing the way you look at me
Can't deny this kinda chemistry, you know
Hoping and wishing we are meant to be
Are you looking for a girl like me tonight?
Noticing the way you look at me
Can't deny this kinda chemistry, you know
Hoping and wishing we are meant to be
Are you looking for a girl like me tonight?

Say you're not looking for anything serious
But I need to know, baby, don't be mysterious

Boy, can we go there? (Can we go there?)
You know we're more than just friends (we're more than just friends)
I gotta know this
Oh, are we falling in love? Oh

Noticing the way you look at me
Can't deny this kinda chemistry, you know
Hoping and wishing we are meant to be (we are meant to be, I know)
Are you looking for a girl like me tonight?
Noticing the way you look at me (oh yeah)
Can't deny this kinda chemistry, you know
Hoping and wishing we are meant to be
Are you looking for a girl like me tonight? (Mwah)
(Are you looking for a girl like me?)
