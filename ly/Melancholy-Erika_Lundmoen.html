		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, I could die for you
Baby, I could die for you
Your black eyes can cry (too)
Baby, I could die for you

Imagine that we are Gods
With the beautiful golden hair
For the people we like drugs
Melancholy in the air
Melancholy in the air
Melancholy in the air
For the people we like drugs
Melancholy in the air

Baby, I could die for you
Your black eyes can cry too
Baby, I could die for you
Oh, maybe simple love is not for you

Is not for you, is not for you
Is not for you, is not for you
Maybe simple love is not for you
Is not for you (cry)

Remember one thing, dear
All the beauty is inside
If you wanna love me, no fear
Magic feelings are to die
Magic feelings are to die
Magic feelings are to die
Magic feelings are to die
Magic feelings are to die

Baby, I could die for you
Your black eyes can cry too
Baby, I could die for you
Oh, maybe simple love is not for you

Is not for you, is not for you
Is not for you, is not for you
Maybe simple love is not for you
Is not for you (we should cry)

Baby, I could die for you
Baby, I could die for you
Your black eyes can cry
Baby, I could die for you
