		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Only a woman can take away your cold hard chill
Break your heart and make you love her still
Leave you thirsty when you've had your fill

Only a woman can sit you high up on a throne
Make you feel so damn alone
Leave you begging baby come back home

And it's only till she's gone
Could you see that you were wrong

'Cause the seasons change and people come and go
But when love is fate best hold that woman close
Take the hard road back and fall down at her door
'Cause that's your woman
That's all I know

Only a woman can make you fly so high you wanna touch the sun
When your wings melt and you come undone
Catches you when you fall, she's the only one

She steals your heart just like a thief
Makes you lay roses at your feet
But you know to kiss the rose, the thorns will make you bleed

And it's only till she's gone
Could you see that you were wrong

'Cause the seasons change and people come and go
But when love is fate best hold that woman close
Take the hard road back and fall down at her door
'Cause that's your woman
That's all I know

You thank God you found her
can't live your life without her
And every little thing about her is all you need
All you need

'Cause the seasons change and people come and go
But when love is fate best hold that woman close
Take the hard road back and fall down at her door
'Cause that's your woman
That's all I know, only a woman
Only a woman
