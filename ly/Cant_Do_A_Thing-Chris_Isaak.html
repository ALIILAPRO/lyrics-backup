		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here I go again
Dreaming
Here I go again
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)

Having a good time baby
Wish you were here
Thinking about you baby
It feels like you're near
And you can't do a thing
To stop me
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
No you can't do a thing, to stop me
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)

Days can be lonely, nights dreams come true
Making love with somebody
Exactly like you
And you can't do a thing
To stop me
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
No you can't do a thing
To stop me
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
Oh try

(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
Can't do a thing to stop me
(Can't do a thing to stop me now) oh
(Can't do a thing to stop me)

I couldn't stop myself if I tried
Because I got you too deep inside

And you can't do a thing, to stop me
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
No you can't do a thing, to stop me
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
Try

(Can't do a thing to stop me now, can't do a thing to stop me)
(Can't do a thing to stop me now, can't do a thing to stop me)
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
Dreamin' (can't do a thing to stop me now)
Dreamin' (can't do a thing to stop me now)
Dreamin'
