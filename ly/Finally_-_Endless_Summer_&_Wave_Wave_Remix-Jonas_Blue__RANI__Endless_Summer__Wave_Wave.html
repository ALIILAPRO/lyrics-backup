		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All of the nights
Tears that I cried
And everything I've been through
I followed all of the signs
And chased every high
I thought love was made to lose

'Til I found somewhere safe in your arms
Far away from the world that I used to know
'Cause the deeper we dive, the more it's do or die
Where'd you come from? Heaven knows

'Cause I found love, found it finally
Never thought it was meant for me
But once you stop looking, then you'll see
That love is gonna find you finally
Finally (finally, finally, finally)

Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
That love is gonna find you, finally

It's like a weight on my chest
All the regrets (mm)
They're starting to float away (way)
You took one hell of a mess
And made it make sense (yeah)
I guess some things are worth the wait, yeah

'Cause I found somewhere safe in your arms
Far away from the world that I used to know (oh)
'Cause the deeper we dive, the more it's do or die
Where'd you come from? Heaven knows

'Cause I found love, found it finally
Never thought it was meant for me
But once you stop looking, then you'll see
That love is gonna find you finally
Finally (finally, finally, finally)

Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
That love is gonna find you, finally

Don't you know that love will find
Don't you know that love will find
Don't you know that love will find
Find you finally, finally?
Finally (finally, finally)
Oh yeah (woo)

Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na (oh)
That love is gonna find you finally

Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na (love is gonna find you)
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na (find you)
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Love is gonna find you, finally
