		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh
It's so
Down low
Oh

I
Cannot
Let go
No

You're looking at your phone again
I'm unsure where we are
I've got your textbook in the car
I know this in my heart

I'm thinking kinda wrong again
I don't want to restart
This ibuprophen in my vein
Is pushing me too far

Oh
It's so
Down low
Oh

I
Cannot
Let go
No

We're coming to the end
So go tell all your friends
We're heading to LA
We'll be there anyday

And don't you get it wrong
I've known it all along 
I'll tell you what I'll do
I'm leaving after school

Think it out you'll be fine
Take a minute to rewind
All the noise in your mind
80's highschool all the time

Having fun next to you
Never knowing what to do
Dreaming of things to come
Will I be your number one 

Oh
It's so
Down low
Oh

I
Cannot
Let go
No
