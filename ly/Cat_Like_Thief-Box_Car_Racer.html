		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This vacation's useless
These white pills aren't kind
I've given a lot of thought on this 13-hour drive
I miss the grinding concrete where we sat past 8 or 9

And slowly finished laughing in the glow of our headlights
I've given a lot of thought to the nights we use to have
The days have come and gone
Our lives went by so fast

I faintly remember breathing on your bedroom floor
Where I laid and told you, but you sweared you loved me more

Do you care if I don't know what to say
Will you sleep tonight or will you think of me
Will I shake this off pretend its all okay
That there's someone out there who feels just like me
There is

Those notes you wrote me
I've kept them all
I've given a lot of thought of how to write you back this fall
With every single letter in every single word
There will be a hidden message about a boy that
Loves a girl

Do you care if I don't know what to say
Will you sleep tonight or will you think of me
Will I shake this off, pretend its all okay
That there's someone out there who feels just like me
There is

Do you care if I don't know what to say?
Will you sleep tonight or will you think of me
Will I shake this off, pretend its all okay
That there's someone out there who feels just like me

Do you care if I don't know what to say?
Will you sleep tonight or will you think of me
Will I shake this off, pretend its all okay
That there's someone out there who feels just like me
There is...
