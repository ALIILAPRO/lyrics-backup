		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lost in your dark
I see you there
What do you see beyond your stare
And you believe that no one else can know

What is this thing you keep inside
Out of the light and wrapped in pride
Always afraid that one day it will show

I'll keep your secrets
I'll hold your ground
And when the darkness starts to fall
I'll be around there waiting
When dreams are fading
And friends are distant and few

Know at that moment I'll be there with you
What are these voices that you hear
Are they too far or far too near
What are these things that echo from the past

Who are these ghosts you see at night
There in the shadows of your life
They only live by the light you cast

I'll keep your secrets
I'll hold your ground
And when the darkness starts to fall
I'll be around there waiting
When dreams are fading
And friends are distant and few

Know at that moment I'll be there with you

I'll be around
When there's no reason left to carry on
And every dream you've ever had is gone
And the dark is deep and black without a sound
And every star has been dragged to the ground
Know at that moment I will be around
Know at that moment I will be around
