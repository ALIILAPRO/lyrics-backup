		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're alone in the crowd
Like a ghost inside
Sleepwalking in the darkness
When you're lost, I'm here
And I wake you up and hold
You when your world shakes

If you're losing your way
Feel like tumbling down
Slipping away, I will turn you around
Learning how to navigate the heart
And we're starting our fire
And never look back
Taking our chance, bet I'm counting on luck
Learning how to navigate the heart

How we so, chasing gold
Me and you, you, unique, unique
How we so, anywhere we go
Me and you, you, unique, unique
Unique, unique unique, unique

Let the world be gone
Sail away with me forever, start tonight
Let the road lead on
Glorious, beautiful, magical

If you're losing your way
Feel like tumbling down
Slipping away, I will turn you around
Learning how to navigate the heart
And we're starting off flying
And never look back
Taking our chance, bet I'm counting on luck
Learning how to navigate the heart

How we so, chasing gold
Me and you, you, unique, unique
How we so, anywhere we go
Me and you, you, unique, unique
Unique, unique how we so, chasing gold
Unique how we so, chasing gold
Me and you, you, unique, unique
How we so, anywhere we go
Me and you, you, unique, unique unique
