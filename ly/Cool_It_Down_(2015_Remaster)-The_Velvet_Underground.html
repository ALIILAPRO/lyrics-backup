		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somebody took the papers
And somebody's got the key
And somebody's nailed the door shut
That says, "hey, what you think that you see?"
But me, I'm down around the corner
You know I'm lookin' for Miss Linda Lee
Because she's got the power 
To love me by the hour
Gives me double you L-O-V-E

Hey baby, if you want it so fast
Don't you know that it ain't gonna last
Of course, you know it makes no difference to me

Somebody's got the time, time
Somebody's got the right
All of the other people
Tryin' to use up the night
But not me, I'm out on the corner
You know I'm lookin' for Miss Linda Lee
Because she's got the power 
To love me by the hour
Gives me double you L-O-V-E

Ooh, hey, if you want it to last
Don't you know, honey, you can get it so fast
But of course, you know it makes no difference to me

Oh-oh, you'd better cool it down
You know you'd better cool it down
You know you'd better cool it down
You know you'd better cool it down

Cool it down, yeah
Ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah

Oh, hey, if you want it so fast
Now lookie-look, baby, don't you want it to last
But of course, you know that it makes no difference to me

Oh, you'd better cool it down
Now baby, better cool it down
Don't you know you'd better cool it down
You know you'd better cool it down
You'd better cool it down
Oh, baby, cool it down
You'd better cool it down
