		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Twenty-ninth of July, weather is clear

One adult asked me

"What is your dream?"
As if my dreams explained who I am
When I said I had no dream
The look on the adult's face was like to the child with no name
The look was familiar to me

Though studying wasn't much of my taste
I tried my best, parents were fond of joy
When I brought good grades to them
Walking on the same path at the same time 
I continued my life with no expression

Many books tell me
Look at the stars in the night sky 
And become the person who shines bright like those stars
But, the stars that I looked up in the sky did not shine at all
So, I continue to walk, looking down on the floor

Suddenly, a strange thing happened to me
As I was walking, a child came up to me and started talking to me
"There is nothing on the floor to look at, raise your head up" 
This child was a bit weird
The child looked at me with a bright smile and had a pure glow from its face 
But it seems like this child had the same expression on its eyes as me

From that moment, we started to hang out a few times
Turning up the music and dancing together was the most exciting part of our hangouts
For the first time, I actually felt alive
Hearts pounding like it is about to burst out 
And this tingling feelings coming up from my fingertips started to take over me
Was there a moment when I wanted something this bad?

One by one, more children started to say my name
The path that I only walked with one another person became a path to many
Slowly, the word 'I' became 'ours'

Wandering around with this unknown fever
As we looked above our heads, stars seem to shine bright
Today
