		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm caught in a swirl
And if I fall it's gonna hurt
It's been around the world
We just gotta keep on going

I'm afraid of change
Stuck in my old ways
Wondering where this life will take me
Wondering what's the meaning lately
I just stay the same (the same)
I make the same mistakes
Never finish what I started
Always end up broken hearted

Night turns into day, dusk turns into dawn
Winter turns to spring, summer turns to fall
What you gonna do? Who you gonna call?
When you're lonely, lonely, lonely

I'm caught in a swirl
And if I fall it's gonna hurt
It's been around the world
We just gotta keep on going

Always on my own (my own)
Wondering what they do all night without me
Wondering if my friends still like me
Anybody else feel like me?

Night turns into day, dusk turns into dawn
Winter turns to spring, summer turns to fall
What you gonna do? Who you gonna call?
When you're lonely, lonely, lonely

I'm caught in a swirl
And if I fall it's gonna hurt
It's been around the world
We just gotta keep on going

Night turns into day, dusk turns into dawn
Winter turns to spring, summer turns to fall
What you gonna do? Who you gonna call?
When you're lonely, lonely, lonely

I'm caught in a swirl
And if I fall it's gonna hurt
It's been around the world
We just gotta keep on going
I'm caught in a swirl
And if I fall it's gonna hurt
It's been around the world
We just gotta keep on going
