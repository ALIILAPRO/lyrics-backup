		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been trying to remember the dreamer
I gave up on so many times
I've been trying to fit in the pieces
In the depths of my mind

I've carried the crosses, too many to deal with
I know the daunting truth and its cries
Carry the losses, always surrounds me
Keeping their memory forever alive

When it's worth dying for
Yeah, you would give up all
'Cause in the end, now you finally see
It sets you free
When nothing else matters
It is worth dying for

When it's worth dying for

Waking up to the truth, been denying
All the threats to our paradise
But I know I can't run, I can't hide from
The wheel of time

I've carried the crosses, too many to deal with
I know the daunting truth and its cries
Carry the losses, always surrounds me
Keeping their memory forever alive

When it's worth dying for
Yeah, you would give up all
'Cause in the end, now you finally see
It sets you free
When nothing else matters
It is worth dying for

Yeah, you would give up all
'Cause in the end now you finally see
It sets you free
When nothing else matters
When it's worth dying for

When it's worth dying for
'Cause in the end now you finally see
It sets you free
When nothing else matters
When it's worth dying for

When it's worth dying for
When it's worth dying for
When it's worth dying for
When it's worth dying for
