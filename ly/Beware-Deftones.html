		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You should know (by now) really
That this could end, really
You should know I could never make it work
Wake up
Let's pretend, really
Really
Babe

Do you like the way the water tastes
Like gunfire
And you knew but you could never say
Then come forth 'cause it's coming round
Round the water

Beware the water

You should know
Babe
At least pretend you did know why
It's not like you watch so go on take a drink
Really
Babe

Do you like the way the water tastes
Like gunfire
You knew but it was never safe
Take one more 'cause it's coming round
Round the water

Beware the water
Beware the water

Teeth are dry
From wind blows
If you come drinking
There you go

Beware the water
Beware the water

Beware the water

Do you like the way the water tastes
Do you like the way the water tastes?
