		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She knows she's in control
Turns the heat up, then she lets me go
She wants me, then she don't
She's the leader and I follow

My love, it's easy for you
Setting the rules and playing it cool
My heart, like a broken cassette
Echoes in my chest, we're getting close
We're getting close

But she's too hot to touch
She's too hot to touch
(She's too hot)

I've got to make my move
And walk towards her, I don't care what I lose
And I'm dying just to prove it, 
But she's elusive no matter what I do

My love, it's easy for you
Setting the rules and playing it cool
My heart, like a broken cassette
Echoes in my chest, we're getting close

But she's too hot to touch
(She's too hot)
She's too hot to touch
(She's too hot)
She's too hot to touch

You make me feel like burning, burning up
No, you can't stop the hurting, too hot to touch
You make me feel like burning, burning up
No, you can't stop the hurting, too hot to touch, oh

(She's too hot)
She's too hot to touch
(She's too hot)
She's too hot to touch
(She's too hot to touch)
She knows that I want it
She knows that I gotta move
She knows that I'm on it
She's too hot to touch
She knows that I want it
And I know what I gotta do
She knows that I want it
She's too hot to touch
