		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I used to have jack, in the fridge and the bank, I'm not goin' back
I had bed bugs, I had roaches and rats, I'm not goin' back
Makin' this cheese cannot be this easy, there must be a catch
I'm spendin' and makin' it back
So maybe it's balance in that

I used to have jack, in the fridge and the bank, I'm not goin' back
I had bed bugs, I had roaches and rats, I'm not goin' back
Makin' this cheese cannot be this easy, there must be a catch
I'm spendin' and makin' it back
So maybe it's balance in that
(I used to have jack)

They know I switch the time zone and bring this shit home, they tippin' they hats
I don't want nothin' in return from none of my bros for scratchin' they backs
Some people wanna be clones, to each his own, go get you some racks
They goin' nowhere too fast
Only God knows how they crash
Soon as I found me a window, I got in where I fit in
If I make somebody a widow, she gon' have her some millis
More money more problems but fuck it we'll take it
When we used to be broke it was shitty
Can't be a nobody in my own city
I ride like the mayor, my windows is tinted
These people ain't playin' my songs out of pity, they actually genuinely fuckin' with me
They pay me in tens, twenties, hundreds, fifties
I'm takin' it all cash, I ain't picky
Don't give me no hard pass, let me figure it out
I'm not a liability nigga
I hustle like I got a mini-me nigga
It's Tall Racks til infinity

I used to have jack, in the fridge and the bank, I'm not goin' back
I had bed bugs, I had roaches and rats, I'm not goin' back
Makin' this cheese cannot be this easy, there must be a catch
I'm spendin' and makin' it back
So maybe it's balance in that

I used to have jack, in the fridge and the bank, I'm not goin' back
I had bed bugs, I had roaches and rats, I'm not goin' back
Makin' this cheese cannot be this easy, there must be a catch
I'm spendin' and makin' it back
So maybe it's balance in that
(I used to have)
