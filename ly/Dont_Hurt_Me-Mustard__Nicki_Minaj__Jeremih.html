		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tryna get up in my head, now that's a headache
I just wanna fuck, I make the bed shake
She wanna spend some time, now that's a Rollie
Shawty ride the dick, just like it's stolen
Met her at the Westin with her bestie
Kissin', they were sweatin', doin' lip things
Had to get up in that lil thang, yeah that lil thang
Let her rock the mic, yeah and her lips sing
They say that it's last call, so let's ball
Tryna have that ass thrown on that pole
Throw it back like retro, like it's retro
Baby, baby, let's go, girl let's go

We take it to my room, yeah
Ain't no need to talk
When that ass on me and the lights off
Baby, I know what to do with it
Give her what she want
Now she wanna fuck a nigga all the time

Oh baby, don't hurt me, hurt me, hurt me
You know I like it naughty, naughty, naughty
When they hear me, want that sexy, sexy, sexy
Want lovin' if you let me, let me, let me
Don't hurt me, hurt me, hurt me
You know I like it naughty, naughty, naughty
When they hear me, want that sexy, sexy, sexy
Want lovin' if you let me, let me, let me

Tryna get up in my head, now that's a headache
I just wanna fuck, and get my cake ate
You wanna spend some time, that's a Rollie
I'mma ride his D, like it's stolen
I met him in the Hills out in LA
Took me for a cruise, yeah, Penelope
Had to sit up on that big thing, that big thing
Super duper freak, yeah, like Rick James
They say that it's last call, for that bar
Tryna get that peach Myx Moscato
Make it clap like when the home team score
Baby don't you hurt me like before

Take you to my room, yeah
Ain't no need to talk
When this thing in your mouth, down south
Baby, you know what to do with it
Gave him what he want
Now he wanna hit your girl all the time

Oh baby, don't hurt me, hurt me, hurt me
You know I like it naughty, naughty, naughty
When they hear me, want that sexy, sexy, sexy
Want lovin' if you let me, let me, let me
Don't hurt me, hurt me, hurt me
You know I like it naughty, naughty, naughty
When they hear me, want that sexy, sexy, sexy
Want lovin' if you let me, let me, let me

All these bitches beggin' me to pass the baton
All these bitches tryna fit my crown and my wand
Bitches still my sons, get your sonogram on
Just a nick of time I did the cover of TIME
Gettin' a million dollars just to stand there and rhyme
Even if you was Curry, bitch, there's still a LeBron
But let's face it, I'm Curry, with rings like LeBron
Added my rings up, that's Mike Jordan
I told bitches when I switched my flow four times
I'd be damned if a bitch nigga eat off mine
All this cake make a broke nigga beat off, huh?
I'm just lookin' for a man, fuck a B-O-Y

Don't hurt me, hurt me, hurt me
You know I like it naughty, naughty, naughty
When they hear me, want that sexy, sexy, sexy
Want lovin' if you let me, let me, let me
Don't hurt me, hurt me, hurt me
You know I like it naughty, naughty, naughty
When they hear me, want that sexy, sexy, sexy
Want lovin' if you let me, let me, let me
