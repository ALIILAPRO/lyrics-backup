		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am outside
And I've been waiting for the sun
With my wide eyes
I've seen worlds that don't belong

My mouth is dry
With words I cannot verbalize
Tell me why
We live like this

Keep me safe inside
Your arms like towers
Tower over me, yeah

Cause we are broken
What must we do to restore
Our innocence
And all the promise we adored?
Give us life again
Cause we just wanna be whole

Lock the doors
Cause I'd like to capture this voice
It came to me tonight
So everyone will have a choice

And under red lights
I'll show myself it wasn't forged
We're at war
We live like this

Keep me safe inside
Your arms like towers
Tower over me

Cause we are broken
What must we do to restore
Our innocence
And all the promise we adored?
Give us life again
Cause we just wanna be whole

(Ah, ah)
(Ah) tower over me
(Ah) tower over me
(Ah)

And I'll take the truth at any cost

Cause we are broken
What must we do to restore
Our innocence
And all the promise we adored?
Give us life again
Cause we just wanna be whole
