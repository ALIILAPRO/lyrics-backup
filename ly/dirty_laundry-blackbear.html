		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My girl don't want me 'cause of my dirty laundry,
And I think that she knows,
I'm out of control,
With all of this money they all want something from me,
It's starting to show,
I'm out of control

Man I can't see shit in the spotlight,
She found receipts from the last night,
In the back of my jeans keep it real right,
I just wanna fuckin' feel right,
Work long all day 'till the night time,
She wants to know what's the deal like,
I think that she knows can't keep sealed tight,
Doin all these things that you want like,
Girls with cocaine on they backsides,
I know, my girl don't want me 'cause of my dirty laundry, let's go

My girl don't want me 'cause of my dirty laundry,
And I think that she knows,
I'm out of control,
With all of this money they all want something from me,
It's starting to show,
I'm out of control

My girl don't want me 'cause of my dirty laundry, I know,
My girl don't want me, no,
I wanna tell you everything I'm hiding,
I can't lie no more,
I wanna tell you everything I'm hiding
I can't lie no more,

(Oh yeah, yeah)
I can't hide it no more,
(Oh)
I can't hide it no more

My girl don't want me 'cause of my dirty laundry,
And I think that she knows,
I'm out of control,
With all of this money they all want something from me,
It's starting to show,
I'm out of control,
(I'm out of control)
My girl don't want me 'cause of my dirty laundry, I know
