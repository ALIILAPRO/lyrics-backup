		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woman
Woman
Have you got cheating on your mind?
On your mind

Something's wrong between us
That your laughter cannot hide
And you're afraid to let your eyes meet mine

And lately when I love you
I know you're not satisfied

Woman
Woman
Have you got cheating on your mind?
On your mind

I've seen the way men look at you
When they think I don't see
And it hurts to have them think that you're that kind

But it's knowing that you're looking back
That's really killing me

Woman
Woman
Have you got cheating on your mind?
On your mind

A woman wears a certain look
When she is on the move
And a man can always tell what's on her mind

I hate to have to say it
But that look's all over you

Woman
Woman
Have you got cheating on your mind?

Oh, woman
Woman
Have you got cheating on your mind?
