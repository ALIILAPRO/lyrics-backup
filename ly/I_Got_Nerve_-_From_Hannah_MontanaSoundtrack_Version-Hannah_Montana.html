		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We haven't met, and that's OK
'Cause you will be asking for me one day
Don't wanna wait in line

The moment is mine believe me

Don't close, your eyes
Cause it's a chance worth takin'
And I think that I can shake it

[Chorus]
I know where I stand
I know who I am
I would never run away when life gets bad, it's
Everything I see
Every part of me
Gonna get what I deserve
I got nerve

Electrified, I'm on a wire
Gettin' together and we're on fire
What I said, you heard
Now I got you spinnin'

Don't close, your mind
The words I use are open
I think that I can show you

I know where I stand
I know who I am
I would never run away when life gets bad, it's
Everything I see
Every part of me
I know I can change the world yeah, yeah, yeah
I know what you like
I know what you think

Not afraid to stare you down until you blink, it's
Everything I see
Every part of me
Gonna get what I deserve
I got nerve

You, need to discover
Who can make you feel free
And I, need to uncover
The part of you that's reaching out for me, hey!

[Chorus]

I know where I stand
I know who I am
I would never run away when life gets bad, it's
Everything I see
Every part of me
I know I can change the world yeah, yeah, yeah
I know what you like
I know what you think
Not afraid to stare you down until you blink, it's
Everything I see
Every part of me
Gonna get what I deserve
I got nerve!

I know what you like
I know what you think
Not afraid to stare you down until you blink, it's
Everything I see
Every part of me
Gonna get what I deserve
I got, I got nerve!
