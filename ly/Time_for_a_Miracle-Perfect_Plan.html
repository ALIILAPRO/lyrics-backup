		  Time for a Miracle
Lyrics & Melodies: Kent Hilli Music: Kent Hilli, Rolf Nordström, Leif Ehlin, Fredrik Forsberg, P-O Sedin, Mats Byström

You hear the drums it echoes war
A beating sound you hit the floor
It's the sound of a cry that's reaching out

You've never felt this fear before
You hear the pounding on your door
With the beat of a drum you start  to crawl

Oh you see them coming
but you stand alone
You hear them calling 
now you're on your own

When the war comes closer
And the fight is all we got 
its time we know that its time
Just one dying soldier
One life is all we got
its time we know that its 
time
Its time for a miracle
Its time for a miracle

You hear the sound a distant roar
You hear the guns an echo wall 
You hit the ground searching for way out
You feel there's something at your door
Is Someone there to save us all
The city cries you cant take this no more

Oh you see them coming
but you stand alone
the last man's fallen 
now you're on your own

When the war comes closer
And the fight is all we got 
its time we know that its time
Just one dying soldier
One life is all we got
its time we know that its time
Its time for a miracle
Its time for a miracle

Were gonna make it til the end
Were gonna fight it once again

Oh you see them coming
but you stand alone
You hear them calling 
now you're on your own

When the war comes closer
And the fight is all we got 
its time 
we know that its time
Just one dying soldier
One life is all we got
its time we know that its 
time
Its time for a miracle 
It's time for a miracle
It's time for a miracle
It's time for a miracle
It's time for a miracle
