		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (All engines running)

We gon' take it to the moon, take it to the stars
How many people you know can take it this far?
I'm supercharged
We 'bout to take this whole thing to Mars (lift off)

Now we gon' take it to the moon, take it to the stars
You don't know what we been through to make it this far
So many scars
We 'bout to take this whole thing to Mars

(Lift off) lift off, takin' my coat off
Showin' my tattoos, I'm such a showoff, huh
I feel the pain and then rolled off
I got the whole city they about to go off
How many niggas with' me up and in this aisle?
How many people wanna roll with me now?
Like you know na na na, you know me by now
Know me, know me by now

We gon' take it to the moon, take it to the stars
How many people you know can take it this far?
I'm supercharged
We 'bout to take this whole thing to Mars

Now we gon' take it to the moon, take it to the stars
You don't know what we been through to make it this far
So many scars
We 'bout to take this whole thing to Mars (lift off, ah, ah)

Like you know na na na, you know me by now
Know me, know me by now
You know, know me by now
Know me, know me by now

Lift off, rappers hear watch the throne
They gon' be pissed off
Earth is boring to 'em
Shit is making my dick soft
When you Earnhart as me eventually you hit a big wall
Five, four, three, two we need fuel, lift off

Now we gon' take it to the moon, take it to the stars
How many people you know can take it this far?
I'm supercharged
I'm 'bout to take this whole thing to Mars

Now we gon' take it to the moon, take it to the stars
You don't know what we been through to make it this far
So many scars
'Bout to take this whole thing to Mars

(Twenty seconds and counting)
(T-minus fifteen seconds, guidance is internal)
(Twelve, eleven, ten, nine)
(Ignition sequence start)
(Six, five, four, three, two, one)
(Zero, all engine running)
(Lift off, we have a liftoff)

Now we gon', now we gon', now we gon', now we gon' (J-jump)
Now we gon' take it to the moon
Now we gon', now we gon' (J-j-jump)
We gon' take it to the moon
Take it to the stars (J-j-jump)
We gon' take it to the moon
Take it to the stars
How many people you know can take it this far?
Take it to the stars
How many people you know can take it this far?
Now we gon', now we gon', now we gon', now we gon', now
