		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I lost all the riches
The diamonds in the mine
It turns out that this was the best thing
To ever happen to me
Errors and glitches
And what a way to find
That such hurt can bring you a greater piece of mind

Ooh
Bring me
Piece of mind
Ooh
Bring me piece of mind

If you've ever lost every part of yourself
If you've left your heart on a lonely avenue
It will be only a matter of time
Before your life comes through for you

If you've ever lost every part of yourself
If you've left your heart on a lonely avenue
It will be only a matter of time
Before your life comes through for you

If you've ever lost every part of yourself
If you've left your heart on a lonely avenue
It will be only a matter of time
Before your life comes through for you

If you've ever lost every part of yourself
If you've left your heart on a lonely avenue
It will be only a matter of time
Before your life comes through for you
