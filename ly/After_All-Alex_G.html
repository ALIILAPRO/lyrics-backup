		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  After all
People come and people go away
Yeah, but God, with me, he stayed
Yeah, but God, with me, he stayed
After all
Things may come and things may go away
Yeah, but God, with me, he stayed
Yeah, but God, with me, he stayed

There are rooms where I can't hang my head
There are tears that I can't cry
In the years you feel the most alone
You will build the walls I climb

After all
People come and people go away
Yeah, but God, with me, he stayed
Yeah, but God, with me, he stayed
After all
Things may come and things may go away
Yeah, but God, with me, he stayed
Yeah, but God, with me, he stayed

Were you young when you lost innocence?
Did the world feel so unkind?
Well the years have passed and I can say
That a love will come in time

People go away
Yeah, but God, with me, he stayed
Yeah, God, with me, he stayed
After all
Things may come and things may go away
Yeah, but God, with me, he stayed
Yeah, God with me, he stayed
