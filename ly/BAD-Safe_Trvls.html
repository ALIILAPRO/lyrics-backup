		  Bad, bad, bad
Shawty want it bad, bad bad
And she been lookin' badder
I been hearin' all these voices in my head like does it even really matter?
Ain't no goin' to the way it was before, cuz I don't wanna play these games no more
She been letting' it all go out on the floor and that is somethin' that I just cannot ignore (No, no)
Bad, bad, bad
Bad, bad, bad
Shawty want it bad, bad, bad and she been lookin' badder
Ain't no goin' to the way it was before, cuz I don't wanna play these games no more
Dancin' with the devil on my shoulder
Cup of liquor on the rocks makes my heart colder
Got no problem goin' home Mr. October
Cuz I ain't feeling' like myself if I'm not sober
Kinda feelin' like the man right now
With a coping mechanism in my hand right now
And she lookin' way too good if you ask me
Got me rollin' up the pressure in the back seat
Shawty want it bad, bad bad
And she been lookin' badder
I been hearin' all these voices in my head like does it even really matter?
Ain't no goin' to the way it was before, cuz I don't wanna play these games no more
She been letting' it all go out on the floor and that is somethin' that I just cannot ignore (No, no)
Bad, bad, bad
Bad, bad, bad
Shawty want it bad, bad, bad and she been lookin' badder
Ain't no goin' to the way it was before, cuz I don't wanna play these games no more
She don't know the hold that she got on me
Dancing' with the devil on my shoulder
Been livin' in my head rent free
But I'm just tryna get a little closer
Shawty want it bad but I'm in my bag
Heard that boy was hatin' we ain't goin' out sad
No we ain't goin' out bad, bad bad
Shawty want it bad, bad bad
And she been lookin' badder
I been hearin' all these voices in my head like does it even really matter?
Ain't no goin' to the way it was before, cuz I don't wanna play these games no more
She been letting' it all go out on the floor and that is somethin' that I just cannot ignore (No, no)
Bad, bad, bad
Bad, bad, bad
Shawty want it bad, bad, bad and she been lookin' badder
Ain't no goin' to the way it was before, cuz I don't wanna play these games no more
