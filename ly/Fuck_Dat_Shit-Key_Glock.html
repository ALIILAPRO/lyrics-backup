		  Sick of these lame ass niggas
(BandPlay)

Ayy, I just want the money, fuck the fame and all that other shit
Yeah, I made a couple millions, still ride with a couple sticks (fah-fah)
Yeah, I keep Nina on my side, you know that she my gutter bitch (yeah)
I got a check and fucked it up, I did it for the fuck of it (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ayy, I just want the money, fuck the fame and all that other shit
Yeah, I made a couple millions, still ride with a couple sticks (fah-fah-fah-fah)
Yeah, I keep Nina on my side, you know that she my gutter bitch (switch)
I got a check and fucked it up, I did it for the fuck of it (the fuck?)

Can't take it with you, fuck this shit (yeah) 
My nigga, fuck this shit (yeah)
I fuck it up and get that shit right back (yeah, phew, phew) 
Oh yeah, I love this shit (yeah)
Can't take it with you, fuck this shit (yeah) 
My nigga, fuck this shit (yeah)
I fuck it up and get that shit right back (phew, phew) 
Oh yeah, I love this shit (I love it)

I hate what I love 'cause sometimes I love that shit too much
Prime example, you can take a look at what's up in my cup
Real nigga give you anything, but still don't give a fuck
Rich nigga, I get what I want, these niggas don't want nothin'
How the hell you hangin' with the opps and tryna hang with us?
Cutthroat La Familia, all my niggas down to slice ya up (gang)
Turn nickels to millions, keep that blicky on me no matter what (phew, fah)
Ayy, get up out your feelings, nigga, go and get a bag or somethin' (the fuck?)

Uh
Ayy, nigga, get up out your feelings, nigga, go and get a bag or somethin'
Yeah (woah)
What you sittin' on your ass for, nigga?
All this paper out here

Ayy, I just want the money, fuck the fame and all that other shit (the money)
Yeah, I made a couple millions, still ride with a couple sticks (fah)
Yeah, I keep Nina on my side (fah), you know that she my gutter bitch (on God, on God, shh)
I got a check (shh) and fucked it up (on God), I did it for the fuck of it (yeah)

I'm sucker free, no sucker shit (yeah), ain't on no sucker shit
I'm rockin' blue diamonds, smokin' Gelato like my brother, bitch
They say if it don't make no money, then it don't make no sense
Well, I been makin' so much damn money, it don't make no sense
Yeah (ayy,let's go)
(I'm rockin' blue diamonds, smokin' Gelato like my brother, bitch) 
I'm rockin' blue diamonds, smokin' Gelato like my brother, bitch

I just want the money, fuck the fame and all that other shit (on God)
Yeah, I made a couple millions, still ride with a couple sticks (yeah, yeah, yeah, fah)
Yeah, I keep Nina on my side (yeah), you know that she my gutter bitch (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I got a check and fucked it up (yeah, yeah), I did it for the fuck of it (yeah, yeah, fuck)

Can't take it with you, fuck this shit (yeah) 
My nigga, fuck this shit (yeah)
Ayy, can't take it with you, fuck this shit (yeah)
