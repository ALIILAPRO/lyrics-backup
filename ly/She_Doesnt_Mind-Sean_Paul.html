		  Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh

Girl, I got you so high, and I know you like
So come and push it on me, if it feels alright
When you drop it low, and break me off
No, she doesn't mind-ind 
She doesn't mind-ind 
She doesn't mind
Girl, I got you so

Push it back pon it, bring it back pon it
Gimme di ting becah me wan' fi lock pon it
Whine it, wiggle it, set di track pon it
Two more shot, now we inna hot panic
Two girl, and dem ready fi jump pon it
True to my word, and me ready fi tump pon it
Ready fi run pon it, ready fi dump pon it
Tag teaming, fiyah truck, we pump on it

Hands up high, we burning up the sky
We got the dance all crazy, got the club on fire
I like the way you dance, you got me in a trance
My baby she don't mind at all

Girl, I got you so high, and I know you like
So come and push it on me, if it feels alright
When you drop it low, and break me off
No, she doesn't mind-ind 
She doesn't mind-ind 
She doesn't mind

Girl, I got you so high, and I know you like
So come and push it on me, if it feels alright
When you drop it low, and break me off
No, she doesn't mind-ind 
She doesn't mind-ind 
She doesn't mind
Girl, I got you so

Whine, you fi wine it, girl
Same time, ah time, she ah time it, girl
Same time, ah line, me ah line it up fi cosign it 
Prime, me ah prime it, girl
Dis ah nuh crime weh mi climb it, girl
Set di temperature, di climate it, girl
Check di rhyme, when me ah rhyme it
Three combine it, dis ah fi we private world

Hands up high, we burning up the sky
We got the dance all crazy, got the club on fire
I like the way you dance, you got me in a trance
My baby she don't mind at all

Girl, I got you so high, and I know you like
So come and push it on me, if it feels alright
When you drop it low, and break me off
No, she doesn't mind-ind 
She doesn't mind-ind 
She doesn't mind

Girl, I got you so high, and I know you like
So come and push it on me, if it feels alright
When you drop it low, and break me off
No, she doesn't mind-ind 
She doesn't mind-ind 
She doesn't mind
Girl, I got you so

Ain't gonna be shy about it
Ain't telling no lie
Girl, I'm a animal, animal
Animal, animal
I'm breaking it down for the night and
I want you to come for the ride
Let's win it all, win it all
Win it all, win it all, let's go

Oh, oh, oh, ohh (she don't mind, girl)
Oh, oh, oh (come on)

Girl, I got you so high, and I know you like
So come and push it on me, if it feels alright
When you drop it low, and break me off
No, she doesn't mind-ind 
She doesn't mind-ind 
She doesn't mind

Girl, I got you so high, and I know you like (let's go)
So come and push it on me, if it feels alright
When you drop it low, and break me off
No, she doesn't mind-ind 
She doesn't mind-ind 
She doesn't mind
Girl, I got you so
