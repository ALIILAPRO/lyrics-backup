		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Call me crazy
Call me cruel
Whatever works for you
Call me reckless
Pull me up
But you can never hold your bluff

You can watch me from a Distance Cause I don't see the difference Let me talk you gotta listen
You'll never take away the feeling

So call me
Anything you want
As long as you call me And don't you ever stop You can put up your guard Or keep me at a far
But if you didn't want me Then you wouldn't call me

Tell me something
Tell me off
Tell me that I'm fucking up Treat me mean
Treat me unkind
As long as I'm on your mind

You can watch me from a Distance Cause I don't see the difference Let me talk you gotta listen
You'll never take away the feeling
CHORUS (repeat)

So Call Me (call me)
So Call Me (call me)
You can put up your guard Or keep me at a far
But if you didn't want me Then you wouldn't call me
