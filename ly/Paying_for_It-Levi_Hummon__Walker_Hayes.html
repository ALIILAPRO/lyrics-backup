		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I bought all your drinks (every one)
We never split one bill (not one time)
I ain't made of green
But I made it rain on your field (hey, hey, hey)

Never saw one penny roll out your purse
The whole time we were hooking up
When you said goodbye I figured
I'd be a little bit richer but

I'm still paying for it
Out the damn wazoo
Like you still on my tab girl 'cause I'm drinking for two
Droppin' all my quarters
On them sad, sad songs
And that cab ain't half price even though I'm riding alone
Ain't just that piggy bank you broke
My heart is achy breaking too
And I'm still paying for it

Met a girl in a bar (Lord, she was cute)
We had a dance or two (couple drinks too)
I had a pretty good chance of taking her home 'til I called her you 

Yeah, the offering plate went by at church
And I almost took a dollar (I hit you back)
Feels like we got divorced (aye)
And I had a real cheap lawyer

And I'm still paying for it
Out the damn wazoo
Like you still on my tab girl 'cause I'm drinking for two (yeah, I've been drinkin')
Droppin' all my quarters
On them sad, sad songs (ew)
And that cab ain't half price even though I'm riding alone
Ain't just that piggy bank you broke
My heart is achy breaking too (come on)
And I'm still paying for it
Woo, here we go

I said my bill folds empty and so is my heart
Ain't no credit left on my credit card (no)
Running out of tears
Running out of gas
At the ATM and it hit me back
With the transaction denied, baby
Why you got me locked outside, baby?
I ain't even got a little jangle
I don't like being broke and single (I don't like it)

Yeah, you're costin' me all kinda things money can't buy
(Gotta do that, babe)
Yeah, I shoulda known what I had before I let her go, yeah
Just like my last dime

I'm still paying for it
Out the damn wazoo
Like you still on my tab girl 'cause I'm drinking for two
(Yeah, I've been drinking for two)
Droppin' all my quarters
On them sad, sad songs
And that cab ain't half price even though I'm riding alone
Ain't just that piggy bank you broke
My heart is achy breaking too
And I'm still paying for it (yeah, woo)
(Yeah) I'm still paying for it (I'm still paying for it) 

(Aye, Levi we got wazoo in the song, bro)
(How 'bout that?)
