		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, the way that she dances on me makes me not wanna leave
You wanna go upstairs but you don't wanna sleep
Oh, right now we're in a rhythm
Your boyfriend's no competition
Turn off your phone and blame it on your battery, hey

Oh-oh-oh-oh
We're getting real, real close
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Can't let this moment go

Hands on your body like there is no one at the party
Just me and you and these empty cups
If you want it like I want it
Let me take you to another room
So it's only us
Turn my television up so nobody can listen
Hands on your body like there is no one a at the party
Just me and you and these empty cups

Oh, girl, do you think they'll notice if we slip away?
Maybe tomorrow they'll all have something to say
Oh, right now we're in a rhythm
We don't need no one's permission
End of the night don't mean we gotta separate, oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh
We're getting real, real close
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Can't let this moment go

Hands on your body like there is no one at the party
Just me and you and these empty cups
If you want it like I want it
Let me take you to another room
So it's only us
Turn my television up so nobody can listen
Hands on your body like there is no one at the party
Just me and you and these empty cups
All of these empty cups
Baby, all of these empty cups

Oh-oh-oh-oh
We're getting real, real close
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Can't let this moment go

Hands on your body like there is no one at the party
Just me and you and these empty cups
If you want it like I want it
Let me take you to another room
So it's only us
Turn my television up so nobody can listen
Hands on your body like there is no one at the party
Just me and you and these empty cups

(Hands on your body like there is no one at the party)
(Just me and you)
All of these empty cups
(If you want it like I want it)
(Let me take you to another room) Oh, baby
Like it's only us
Turn my television up so nobody can listen
Hands on your body like there is no one at the party
Just me and you and these empty cups
