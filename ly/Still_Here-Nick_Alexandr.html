		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I'll just say it
I think you're still playing
Told me you was gonna
Change your ways well let's just face it
I see small things changing
And baby you're about to leave
My mind is fucking racing
Consumed by anxiety yeah
And maybe I'm a little paranoid yeah
And maybe you don't like this side
But I can see the future and clearly
We ain't gonna turn out fine yeah
Cause I've been picking up how you say things
And maybe I'm blind to you baby
I can't believe that I let her play me
I'm still here
But now I think I'm finally seeing clearly
Tried to talk to you it's like you couldn't hear me yeah
Guess she don't really need me
She don't really need me
I'm still here
Tried to show you that I'll be right there regardless
Gave you every part of me, still disregard this
I just never thought that she could be so heartless
But that bitch heartless
I wish I could stay but love is blinding me
Demons on my shoulders got control of me
Maybe she'll regret it when I finally leave
But right now I just feel I've fallen Into deep yeah
There's no saving me yeah
What hurts is I'm still holding on to you
Even after all the shit you put me through
I still think this isn't real yeah
Maybe there's still time to heal yeah
But I can't switch up I can't leave
Even though I know it's killing me
Said you need some time to think
While I'm wishing you could see
You've been distant, real suspicious
Saying that you out with your friends
I don't miss this
I overthink, Im superstitious
I don't know if we can fix this yeah
And maybe I'm a little paranoid yeah
And maybe you don't like this side
But I can see the future and clearly
We ain't gonna turn out fine
Cause I've been picking up how you say things
And maybe I'm blind to you baby
I can't believe that I let her play me
I'm still here
But now I think I'm finally seeing clearly
Tried to talk to you it's like you couldn't hear me
Yeah guess she don't really need me
She don't really need me
I'm still here
Tried to show you that I'll be right there regardless
Gave you every part of me, still disregard this
I just never thought that she could be so heartless
But that bitch heartless
I wish I could stay but love is blinding me
Demons on my shoulders got control of me
Maybe she'll regret it when I finally leave
But right now I just feel I've fallen Into deep yeah
There's no saving me yeah
