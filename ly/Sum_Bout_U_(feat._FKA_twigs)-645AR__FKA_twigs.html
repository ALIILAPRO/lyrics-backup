		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
There's just something about you

It's somethin' 'bout you (somethin' 'bout you)
You do somethin' to me, make me feel some way (feel some way)
The way that I feel about you, nobody'll take your place (take your place)
Baby girl, I need you, I can't move this way
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

There's somethin' 'bout you (somethin' 'bout you)
You do somethin' to me, make me feel some way (feel some way)
The way I feel about you, nobody will take your place (take your place)
Baby boy, I need you, I can't move this way
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

You don't understand my pain
Without you, I'm not the same
Bad ass bitch to keep me sane
That ride-or-die bitch, I ain't playin'
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I just cannot let you go
Me and you gon' get this dough
I just wanna see you grow

Anything you need, I'm always there
I'm all about you, girl, I swear
Life without you is not fair
Uh, huh, huh, huh
Ride with me 'til the wheels fall off
Life without you, I might get lost
Baby, you make me a boss

There's somethin' 'bout you
You do somethin' to me, make me feel some way
The way I feel about you, nobody will take your place
Baby boy, I need you, I can't move this way
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

(Yeah)
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)

'Cause I'm your girl, diamonds and pearls
Purple Rain up in your world
'Cause I would never leave or desert you, oh
So let me put my sugar up on you

You don't understand my pain
Without you, I'm not the same
Bad ass bitch to keep you sane
About you, you know what I'm sayin'
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I just cannot let you go
Me and you gonna get this dough
I just wanna see you grow

It's somethin' 'bout you
You do somethin' to me, make me feel some way
The way I feel about you, nobody'll take your place
Baby girl, I need you, I can't move this way
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
