		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You in the dark 
You in the pain 
You on the run 

Living a hell 
Living your ghost 
Living your end 

Never seem to get in the place that I belong 
Don't want to lose the time 
Lose the time to come 

Whatever you say it's alright 
Whatever you do it's all good 
Whatever you say it's alright 
Silence is not the way 
We need to talk about it 
If heaven is on the way 
If heaven is on the way 

You in the sea 
On a decline 
Breaking the waves 
Watching the lights go down 
Letting the cables sleep 

Whatever you say it's alright 
Whatever you do it's all good 
Whatever you say it's alright 
Silence is not the way 
We need to talk about it 

If heaven is on the way 
We'll wrap the world around it 
If heaven is on the way 
If heaven is on the way 

I'm a stranger in this town 
I'm a stranger in this town 

I'm a stranger in this town 

If heaven is on the way 
If heaven is on the way 
I'm a stranger in this town 
I'm a stranger in this town
