		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The taste of avenging blood
Suffer horror she's with stood
Disgust, the core of her soul
The crime takes a new toll
Rapes the soul

Hear her pain
Listen
To what she'd scream
I'm gonna see you bleeding
Face down in the dirt
I'm gonna give you back what
You've taken with hurt
You coward
I'm gonna spit right into you face
In grace you'll be no more

This scar makes her heart stronger
Your breath makes her days longer
Life gained through your dying eyes
Revenge, life's bitter prize
Feel reprise

Hear her pain
And listen
To what she'd scream
I'm gonna see you bleeding
Face down in the dirt
I'm gonna give you back what
You've taken with hurt
You coward
I'm gonna spit right into you face
In grace you'll be no more

The seasons wither away
The seasons wither away
The seasons wither away
The seasons wither away

And we pray you die (and we pray you die)
We pray you suffocate (suffocate)
In pain you writhe (in pain you writhe)
This day we celebrate (celebrate)
This day we celebrate (this day we celebrate)
Desecrate

This mind and body
This heart and soul
Will not be trampled
Will not crumble
You can't hurt me (hurt me)
Your power's control denied
And you can't rape me (rape me)
That moment's effect has died
You're a fucking shell that's dead in my eyes
Dead!
Dead!
