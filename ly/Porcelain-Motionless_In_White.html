		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  God knows I tried
But broken, I bow to the beast inside
Covered my tracks but couldn't swallow my pride
As sure as the moonlight strikes our skin
I howled a wrecking ball and you were porcelain

An altered state
Sometimes I even scare myself
Is it too late to question fate?

And hope is fleeting
Still tethered to this grim divergence of my being
I can't stop the bleeding
I can barely stand myself

God knows I've tried
But broken, I bow to the beast inside
Covered my tracks but couldn't swallow my pride
As sure as the moonlight strikes our skin
I howled a wrecking ball and you were porcelain
Porcelain
Porcelain

I saw your face, but it couldn't save me
I fell from grace, and I cracked your smile
Don't rescue me, I can't escape it
Ravenously, feed my feral mind
We bend before we break

God knows I've tried
But broken, I bow to the beast inside
Covered my tracks but couldn't swallow my pride
As sure as the moonlight strikes our skin
I howled a wrecking ball and you were porcelain

Porcelain
Compulsions killing me
Giving in
And I can't go back
Porcelain
It's fucking killing me
Giving in
I can't go back

I've broken my vows to reconcile
I shattered your heart, and left a crack in your smile
As sure as the moonlight strikes our skin
I howled a wrecking ball and you were porcelain
Porcelain
Porcelain
