		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What if all my best years are behind me?
What if they ended when I was nineteen?
After all of these years that I've wasted
When I get what I want, will I hate it?

And after all my overthinkin'
I've got nothing here to show
I wanna hang out with the big kids
But I'm afraid of getting' old
Don't tell me it will get better
Don't say it'll be okay
It's not a mood, it's not a phase

It's a quarter life crisis
All of my vices, rise to the surface
They're workin' the night shift
A quarter life crisis
There's nothing like it
I look at my face and I don't recognize it

I'm too young to write it, too old to fight it
I'm stuck in the middle like some fuckin' hybrid
I feel like my mind is twenty five sided
I'll let you know if I ever survive this quarter life crisis

I'm no longer na√Øve, I'm corrupted
And I don't feel as pure as I once did
Maybe if I could turn to religion
I'd believe all my sins were forgiven

Man, I guess all my overthinkin'
Didn't make me very smart
How can I focus on the picture
When I'm one foot in the past?
Still couldn't get my shit together
I guess some things never change
It's not a mood, it's not a phase

It's a quarter life crisis
All of my vices, rise to the surface
They're workin' the night shift
A quarter life crisis
There's nothing like it
I look at my face and I don't recognize it

I'm too young to ride it, too old to fight it
I'm stuck in the middle like some fuckin' hybrid
I feel like my mind is twenty five sided
I'll let you know if I ever survive this quarter life crisis

Ah
Ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah
Ah
Ah-ah-ah

It's a quarter life crisis
Tried to describe this
To other people, they don't realize
It's a quarter life crisis
There's nothing like it
I look at my face and I fuckin' despise it

I'm too young to ride it, too old to fight it
I'm stuck in the middle like some kind fuckin' hybrid
A quarter life crisis, guess I'll just write it
I'll let you know if I ever survive this quarter life crisis

Ah
Ah (quarter life crisis)
Ah-ah-ah
Ah
Ah (quarter life crisis)
Ah-ah-ah
