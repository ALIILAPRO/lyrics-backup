		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We don't have to fall with it
It doesn't have to be this way, you're tryna talk me out of it
Just to see if I break
And say that I'm done, called it a day, tell me do you ever wonder?
How it can feel holding our weight under the pressure we're under

'Cause usually, by now, we're sleeping just fine
But I've never seen that tired look in your eyes
Just promise me you'll sleep on it one more night

'Cause, baby, it's too late
To be packing up your suitcase now
No, you can't just decide to walk away, just when things don't go our way
After all we've been through
If this means anything to you, then stay

Remember in the beginning
I didn't even know your name, pre-drinking in your friend's kitchen
Who'd have known that someday
Years down the line, you would be mine and I'd be here, stopping you leaving
And when we wake up, we'll go back to us and then you'll know every reason

Baby, it's too late
To be packing up your suitcase now
No, you can't just decide to walk away, just when things don't go our way
After all we've been through
If this means anything to you, then stay

You, then stay
You, then stay
You, then stay

'Cause usually, by now, we're sleeping just fine
But I've never seen that tired look in your eyes
Just promise me you'll sleep on it one more night
One more night

'Cause baby, it's too late
To be packing up your suitcase now
No, you can't just decide to walk away, just when things don't go our way
After all we've been through
If this means anything to you, won't you please stay?
Don't be packing up your suitcase now
No, you can't just decide to walk away, just when things don't go our way
After all we've been through
If this means anything to you, then stay
