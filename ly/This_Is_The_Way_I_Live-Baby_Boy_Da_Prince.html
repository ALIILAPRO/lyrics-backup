		  This is the way I live
Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels
I stack my money, lay low, and chill
Don't need to work hard, that's the way I feel, I feel, I
This is the way I live

Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels
I stack my money, lay low, and chill
Don't need to work hard, that's the way I feel, I feel, I
This is the way I live

Six months later now we're big dog status
Name elevated but I still act average
Rockin' shows in Dallas, ballin' like I play for the Mavericks
West Bank rapper and I'm one of the baddest

French Riviera spot and I'm getting in shape man
I think I'm Super m-a-n without a cape man
Ridin' all day hustlin'; all for the cake man
I'm a Benjamin stack, one inch taller than Great Danes

First they made cheap Ray Ban like a felon
I'm growin' up now spittin' hotter than Mohellans
And I'm still living good, never gon' too fly
I'm a young little dude, stay runnin' from cops

Emerald Row is the place where I got my props
People love me in da hood, they don't want me to stop
So uhh, that's the only way I know how to rock
And I'm a stay rappers like I ain't gon stop 'til I drop

This is the way I live
Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels
I stack my money, lay low, and chill
Don't need to work hard, that's the way I feel, I feel, I
This is the way I live

Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels
I stack my money, lay low, and chill
Don't need to work hard, that's the way I feel, I feel, I
This is the way I live

I's Baby Boy and I done it again
I'm ridin fly with D-Wizzle in the 'cedes Benz
Twenty two wanna ride with the ladies then
Red Bull, Grey Goose, now the ladies bent

Now we go and do a thing under a shady tent
And they don't question what I say cause I'm a ladies pimp
See this little one right here? This fellow got stripes
And I's gon represent, my rail room for life

Money in my pocket, but I still act trife
While in da club they say the parlor ain't right
Look I'm doing great and that's the way I feel
Hustlin' hard all day and that's the way I live

This is the way I live
Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels
I stack my money, lay low, and chill
Don't need to work hard, that's the way I feel, I feel, I
This is the way I live

Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels
I stack my money, lay low, and chill
Don't need to work hard, that's the way I feel, I feel, I
This is the way I live

Hey, hey, it's the two-seat rider with the ketchup inside
Red pepper paint must believe my shit ride
They pause like stop signs when they rollin' up
'Cause when the doors open up, they open up

I'm Lamboin' it, I was stashed, off stage I'm throwin' it
My niggas say I'm like Katrina with money, I blow the shit
Real been gravy, three years out of da eighties
Solos, shabo's valley animals played it

Commodores' mirages, not the Nike Huaraches
It cost 250 on up to put your foot inside this
Y'all was wearing rocks that was my time to shine
Don't give me Viesels y'all thinkin' this McDonald's size

I been fly-I-I-I from the crib to the ri-I-I-I-de
Fifty-Four inch screens, 26 inches from the ceiling
Dude, the plasma look like a projector up in da livin' room homie

This is the way I live
Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels
I stack my money, lay low, and chill
Don't need to work hard, that's the way I feel, I feel, I
This is the way I live

Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels
I stack my money, lay low, and chill
Don't need to work hard, that's the way I feel, I feel, I
This is the way I live

Ho, this is the way I live
Ho, this is the way I live
Ho, this is the way I live
Ho, this is the way I live
Ho, this is the way I live, I live, I

This is the way I
She like it
She like it
She like it
She like it

Oh na na na
Oh na na na
Oh na na na
Oh na na na

Groove to the jam
Groove to the jam
Groove to the jam
Groove to the, groove to the
