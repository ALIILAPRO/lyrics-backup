		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My life suffocates
Planting seeds of hate
I've loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fate
I give
You take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth

Anger
Misery
You'll suffer unto me

Harvester of sorrow (language of the mad)
Harvester of sorrow
Uh

Pure black looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to me
Get back which used to be
Drink up
Shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain
Your loss becomes my gain

Anger
Misery
You'll suffer unto me

Harvester of sorrow (language of the mad)
Harvester of sorrow

All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes 
You'll find where murder lies

Infanticide

Harvester of sorrow (language of the mad)
Harvester of sorrow (language of the mad)
Harvester of sorrow 
Harvester of sorrow 
Harvester of sorrow 
Harvester of sorrow 
Harvester of sorrow 
Harvester of sorrow
