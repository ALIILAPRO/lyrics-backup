		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have known you for so long 

All this time, you've been so strong  

You're the best I'll ever know  

I must make a phone call 

I'm always calling you me to make sure you're home  

I know that you're always in big pain 

I wanna take it all away  

This could be the last time  

I'm willing to accept that 

But I will not let go easily 

It's not about me, I know that  

I know that you're always in big pain  

Wanna take it all away  

I wish it was easy 

I wish I could change all the pain 

So I wouldn't have to make that phone call 

To tell them that you you've made it until so far  

I know it gets harder every day  

I wish that you could stay  

This could be the last time  

I'm willing to accept that 

But I will not let go easily 

It's not about me, I know that  

I know that you're always in big pain  

I wanna take it all away  

I am always on your side 

And if you wanna leave tonight  

I'll hold your hand 

Until the end 

You're my best friend  

I know that you're always in big pain  

Wanna take it all away  

This could be the last time  

I'm willing to accept that 

But I will not let go easily 

It's not about me, I know that  

I know that you're always in big pain  

Wanna take it all away  

This could be the last time  

I'm willing to accept that 

But I will not let go easily 

It's not about me, I know that  

I know that you're always in big pain  

Wanna take it all away
