		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, if you don't make it, you just don't make it
Everybody ain't champions
But I am, haha
(Murda on the beat so it's not nice)

Playtime over, this the big league (go)
Playtime over, this the big league (go)
Playtime over, this the big league (go)
Playtime over, this the big league (phew)

Perfect release from the top of the key (three)
Step back, pull up, swish cheese (swish cheese)
Slam (ooh), got the crowd out they seats (up)
One step closer to the big ring

Court-side seats so close, I could triple-referee (haha)
Send to drop the fire, and one, that's three (go)
The reason y'all losin', you don't speak no D (no)
So we ain't gotta play team ball, that's Keith (sure)
Been won a championship in the trap
This Rollie a trophy, I hold it up (got me one)
They let us get up with no points, it's a wrap
Gon' shine every time, it's an open look (over with)

Ah, ah, shake 'em up, cross 'em up, post-move
Defence lock 'em up, fah, fah
Ain't nobody hot as us (pump fake)
Shooter gettin' added up
Twenty-four pointers and the AP shot-clock
Damn, what them rocks in your ear cost? (A lot)
On the grind, don't stop, one day it's gon' pay off (pay off)
Made it from the bottom to the play-offs

Playtime over, this the big league (go)
Playtime over, this the big league (go)
Playtime over, this the big league (go)
Playtime over, this the big league (phew)

Perfect release from the top of the key (three)
Step back, pull up, swish cheese (swish cheese)
Slam (ooh), got the crowd out they seats (up)
One step closer to the big ring

Court-side seats, this the big bag
Hit a Ja Morant shot, get 'em big mad
Real hustle knew one day it was gon' pay off, pay off
Yeah, now I'm ballin' in the play-offs, play-offs
Mansion in Miami, ball at the Celtics
"Gotti, you the MVP," yeah, I nailed it
Bought a Rolls Royce online, they mailed it
No look, pass to the Bagg, how you fail that?

Ah, ah, shake 'em up, cross 'em up, post-move
Defence lock 'em up, fah, fah
Ain't nobody hot as us (pump fake)
Shooter gettin' added up, ah, ah
Shot-clock, buzzer beater, Lambo
Two-seater, we don't do new people (fah, fah)
Feds break, takin' off, lose one
Shake it off, bounce back, then defeat 'em

Playtime over, this the big league (go)
Playtime over, this the big league (go)
Playtime over, this the big league (go)
Playtime over, this the big league (phew)

Like the '02 Lakers, I three-peat (I three-peat)
Mean we don't ever lose, we repeat (what's that?)
Yeah, they hate, but they really wanna be me (wanna be us)
Bet they do a no-look when they see me (when they see us)
Grab the .12 like Ja, I'm a Grizzly (I'm a Grizzly)
Think I'ma fall when I ball, you silly (you crazy)
I might trade all my pendants, ayy (what?)
Ayy, last name James, but my first name Mike (first name Mike)

Playtime over, this the tip-off
They tried to cross me and spit ball
No longer team, he got kicked off
Threw up the alley and watch how I lift off
We got 'em pissed off, look at the score
No Michael Jordans, we in Dior
Bet on the Warriors when they hit the floor
Yeah, get your ligaments torn

Playtime over, this the big league (go)
Playtime over, this the big league (go)
Playtime over, this the big league (go)
Playtime over, this the big league (phew)

Perfect release from the top of the key (three)
Step back, pull up, swish cheese (swish cheese)
Slam (ooh), got the crowd out they seats (up)
One step closer to the big ring

Playtime over, this the big ring (go)
Playtime over, need a big ring (go)
Playtime over, need a big ring (go)
Playtime over, this the big wing (go)
