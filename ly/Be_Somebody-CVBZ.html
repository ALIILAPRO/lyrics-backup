		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanted you in the worst way
I couldn't have you in the first place
You got me sinking through the floor
I'm just trying to get you
On that first date
I drink at home by myself while
You're getting high in the hills
I never stood a chance at all
Never got to show you what I'm made of

So why you wanna run from me now love?
Why you calling all the shots oh
Someday I'm gonna be somebody
You'll see, you'll see
So why you wanna run from me now love?
Why you calling all the shots oh
Someday I'm gonna be somebody
Someday I'm gonna be somebody

Someday I'm gonna be somebody
Fuck your feelings, I don't need them

I wanted you to myself but
You wanted everyone else, girl
I got you running for the door
Baby, this ain't love you're fading
You left a whole lot behind while
I left a hole in the dry wall
Now you're coming back for more
Tell me what you try to get away from

So why you wanna run from me now love?
Why you calling all the shots oh
Someday I'm gonna be somebody
You'll see, you'll see

So why you wanna run from me now love?
Why you calling all the shots oh
Someday I'm gonna be somebody
Someday I'm gonna be somebody

Someday I'm gonna be somebody
Fuck your feelings, I don't need them

So why you wanna run from me now love?
Why you calling all the shots oh
Someday I'm gonna be somebody
You'll see, you'll see

So why you wanna run from me now love?
Why you calling all the shots oh
Someday I'm gonna be somebody
Someday I'm gonna be somebody

Someday i'll be somebody
You'll see, you'll see
Fuck your feelings, I don't need them
