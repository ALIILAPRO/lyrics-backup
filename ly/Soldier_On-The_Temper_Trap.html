		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who wants to know?
All that is gold, is rusted
No one will know
Seasons cease, to change, and

How far we've gone
How far we're going
So here and the now
And the love for the sound
Are the moments that keep us moving

Waves crash along
Battered lonely lighthouse
Tomorrow she's gone
And if not, some, they somehow
Are, these, hands, always

Well this side of, mortality is
Scaring, me, to death
To death

Don't think about it at all
Just keep your head low
Don't think about it at all

Soldier on
Soldier on
Keep your heart, close to the ground
Soldier on
Soldier on
Keep your heart, close, to the ground

Don't think about it at all
Just keep your head low
Don't think about it at all

Yeah
Will you take me tonight
Yeah
Will you take me tonight
Yeah
Will you take me tonight

Yeah
Will you take me tonight
Tonight

Soldier on
Soldier on
Keep your heart, close to the ground
