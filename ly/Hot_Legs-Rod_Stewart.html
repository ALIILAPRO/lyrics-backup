		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who's that knockin' on my door?
It's gotta be a quarter to four
Is it you again, comin' round for more?
Well, you can love me tonight if you want
But in the morning make sure you're gone
I'm talkin' to you
Hot legs, you're wearin' me out
Hot legs, you can scream and shout
Hot legs, are you still in school?
I love you honey

You got a most persuasive tongue
You promise all kinds of fun
But what you don't understand, I'm a working man
I'm gonna need a shot of vitamin E
By the time you're finished with me
I'm talkin' to you
Hot legs, you're an alley cat
Hot legs, you scratch my back
Hot legs, bring your mother too
I love you, honey

Imagine how my daddy felt
In your jet black suspender belt
Seventeen years old,
He's trudging sixty four
You got legs right up to your neck
You're makin' me a physical wreck
I'm talkin' to you
Hot legs in your satin shoes
Hot legs, are you still in school?
Hot legs, you're makin' me a fool
I love you, honey

Hot legs, you're makin' your mark
Hot legs, keep my pencil sharp
Hot legs, keep your hands to yourself
I love you, honey

Hot legs you're wearin' me out
Hot legs you can scream and shout
Hot legs, you're still in school
I love you, honey
Hot legs
Hot legs
Hot legs

Hot legs you're well-equipped
Hot legs oh your pussy's whipped
Hot legs I just love your lips
I love ya
I love ya
I love ya, honey
Hot legs
Hot legs
Hot legs
I love ya honey!
