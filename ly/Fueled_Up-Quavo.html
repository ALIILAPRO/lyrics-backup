		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm goin' back to my moves, I'm goin' back to my old ways
I'm goin' back to my lifestyle, pullin' up back to the Nawf Qua' (ooh)
Never go back to my old bae (no)
Nigga, I gotta go up for Take'
See, you know that I'm outside workin' one
You know that we earned them one
Nigga, we came from none, know that we servin', son
Off this good drank, you know that's the purple one
Walkin' out the bank with a hunnid and sum'n

Narcotics on narcotics, I just took one (yeah)
Livin' like a rockstar but we miss one (yeah)
My cousin jumped out the car, had to keep goin' (ooh)
Now he tellin' the whole world that we ain't blood (ooh)
Nigga, it's all love, yeah, it's all love (yeah)
I guess we got to be together in this small world (yeah)
Nigga, it's all love, yeah, it's all love (love)
Rocket power, I'ma up this shit, let's keep it goin'

Valet the car and I'm keepin' it crunk (skrrt)
I am a star and these bitches be struck
Fire on me now and I'm keepin' it tucked (grrah)
All I can think about is my lil' bruh (damn)
Ridin' around in my bulletproof truck
These savings ain't dangerous, that is a must
Lean on my stick like I'm usin' a crutch (baow)
Jealousy, images, watch who you trust (trust)
To infinity, I got businesss (woo)
I got mansions and amenities
Take advantage, won't get into me (nah)
You can plan it, not offendin' me
He's a fan, not an enemy (woo)
On the planet with the remedy
Fuck who started, I'ma finish it (finish)
I'ma pack out the booth like it's Spirit (go)
Pack out the-pack out the-pack out the booth like it's Spirit
Four pockets full like I got on Amiris (woo)
QC the label, been loaded for years
Huncho the man, the man of the year
We put the A on the map for real (woo)
Young rich nigga done made careers (careers)
Iron sharpen iron, nigga, we playin'
so young nigga, swallow your pills (chyeah)
Been reppin' the same team like LeBron, it's time to redo my deal
Way before, way before I lost my brother, it been time to kill
Can't nobody, nobody take this pressure we apply here (no)
Put it on, put it on the floor and dresser, nigga, it's all here

I'm goin' back to my moves (yeah), I'm goin' back to my old ways
I'm goin' back to my lifestyle, pullin' up back to the Nawf Qua' (ooh, nawf)
Never go back to my old bae (no, yeah)
Nigga, I gotta go up for Take' (yeah)
See, you know that I'm outside workin' one
You know that we earned them one (yeah)
Nigga, we came from none, know that we servin', son (yeah)
Off this good drank, you know that's the purple one (oh)
Walkin' out the bank with a hunnid and sum'n

Do this shit for the fam', 'cause this shit bigger than me
Do this shit for the fam', 'cause this shit bigger than me
Do this shit for the fam', 'cause this shit bigger than me
