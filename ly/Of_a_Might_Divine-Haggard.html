		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Requiem eternam
Et dona eis domine 

Ride, ride, over the land
Sorrow comes without a waring, dear
And do never start to sacrifice your faith
They, they betray
And poisoned voices creep into your mind
For this will be their final stand 

Ride, ride over the land!
Outside - a light!
He awakes in the deep of a stormy night
They have come to get him now
A feast for the raging crowed
With torches still alight 

Supressed by a might divine
"Your science of the dark"
Revoke what has been told
Or at the break of dawn you will feel the holy spark
Of a might divine 

La falce della luna Ã© in lutto questa notte 

"Inside - I cry
All I trusted in should die?"
An instrument to ship the blind
Through the sea of ancient times
Of a might divine 

Now the night breaks
And the final trial awakes
Pressure's getting more and more
Betrayed - all I was living for
Of a might divine 

Supressed by a might divine
"Your science of the dark"
Revoke what has been told
Or at the break of dawn you will feel the holy spark
Of a might divine 

La falce della luna e in lutto questa notte 

Requiem eternam
Et dona eis domine
