		  One, two, three, one, two, three
One, two, three, one, two, three
One, two

One, two, three, one, two, three
One, two, three, one, two, three
One, two

One, two, three, one, two, three
One, two, three, one, two, three
One, two

One, two, three, one, two, three
One, two, three, one, two, three
One, two

One, two, three, one, two, three
One, two, three, one, two, three
One, two

Wear me, wear me out
It's all strung out
You found what carried you

Fall out, everyone fall out
Get lost in this town
Some road that's getting worn
At our feet, at our feet now

'Cause I got older
And we got tired
Heaven I know that we tried
Heaven I know
Heaven I know

Yeah, I got older
And we got tired
Heaven I know that we tried
Heaven I know
Heaven I know
Heaven I know that we tried
Heaven I know
Heaven I know

Longer still, withstanding the most I will
Still be the most I can
Drying out, dragging down now

'Cause I got older
And we got tired
Heaven I know that we tried
Heaven I know
Heaven I know
Heaven I know that we tried
Heaven I know
Heaven I know
Heaven I know that we tried

Ascending, ascending now
Heaven I know
Heaven I know that we tried
Ascending, ascending now
Heaven I know
Heaven I know that we tried

Heaven I know
Heaven I know
Heaven I know that we tried
Heaven I know
Oh, heaven I know
Heaven I know that we tried

One, two, three, one, two, three
One, two, three, one, two, one
