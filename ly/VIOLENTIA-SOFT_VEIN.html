		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Black van, short drive 
Black vans, white stripe
Open bottle, dash lights 
Graveyard, black tights 

Black jacket, steel chain
Eyes wide. small frame  
Heart beat, arrhythmia
Milk skin, anemia 

What's another scar
I know who you are 
Come into my arms 
Come into my arms

What's another scar
I know who you are 
Come into my arms 
Come into my arms
Come into my

Soft dick, no sex
Lovesick, innocence 
Hard dick, warm mouth 
Lovesick, lie down 

Soft flesh, go down 
No lights, no sound 
Drip sweat, soft sigh 
Blood red, eyes white 

What's another scar
I know who you are 
Come into my arms 
Come into my arms

What's another scar
I know who you are 
Come into my arms 
Come into my arms
Come into my


Soft skin, soft vein 
Dull knife, dull pain  
Soft skin, soft vein 
Dull knife, dull pain  


Deep push, small death
Thick ropes, redress 
Deep push, small death
Thick ropes, redress 

What's another scar
I know who you are 
Come into my arms 
Come into my arms 

What's another scar
I know who you are 
Come into my arms 
Come into my arms 
Come into my
