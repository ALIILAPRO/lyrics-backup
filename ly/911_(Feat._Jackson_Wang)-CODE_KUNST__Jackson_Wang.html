		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh-oh-oh, we can take it slow
Oh-oh, stay until the morning
Oh, but just take here this moment, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, we can take it slow
Oh-oh, stay until the morning
Oh, but just take here this moment

I'm asking if it's okay
Turn around for me, baby
My heart in your hand is breaking down
You locked me up with your scent
Love that two piece on you, girl
Look me in the eyes
'Cause we're going down
Too much of you asking why
I do this but know I love you girl
Locking eyes on a rock we smiling
Don't deny but the feelings true
Tell me, tell me, girl
Bae, you can say it now
Know that I need you the most

'Cause, I got you now
Ooh-ooh-ooh, baby
I wanna know, I wanna know tonight
You know that I got you now
Ooh-ooh-ooh, baby
I wanna know, I wanna know tonight

It's always 3AM, you calling
I know you want me, just for now
You know I'm down, down
But why is it now, now
You always leaving a note
Nah, baby, don't want you to ask me why
Every night when you call me mine
Tell me if I'm wrong, oh
Saying that night you don't mind
Even doing nothing killing time
But we know that we wrong

'Cause, I got you now
Ooh-ooh-ooh, baby
I wanna know, I wanna know tonight
You know that I got you now
Ooh-ooh-ooh, baby
I wanna know, I wanna know tonight

I think we know what this about
Don't let it slip away
The things that we feel deep inside
Will never lie to us

'Cause I got you now
Ooh-ooh-ooh, baby
I wanna know, I wanna know tonight
You know that I got you now (ooh, yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, baby
I wanna know (I wanna)
I wanna know tonight (I wanna know tonight)
'Cause, I got you now
'Cause, I got you now
Tell'em I got you now (baby)
