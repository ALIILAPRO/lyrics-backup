		  Step youngin'

10 links on
Probably a mill on me
(Veno gon' cook up, he mix the ingredients)

Pull the curtains down on the Maybach
Niggas hate that
Suitcase full of 8 straps
I used to take straps
They say that nigga ain't rat
Well where that case at
Half of these niggas ain't that
They just can make raps
In public with a fully loaded
Some shit, can get you boated
If you ain't trying to kill something
Then why the fuck you toting
A lot of people picked up
But not too many wrote me
She love that I don't give a fuck
That's why I keep her close
She don't wanna war with me
I got too many soldiers
Quit screaming dog you spoil me
Before I bend you over
I'm eating off of royalties
They know my shit cold
One time for the real niggas
Who ain't never told

Jump back down bitch
We off that clown shit
Skinny brown petite thang
Want me to pound shit
Everything true blue
When I'm in town bitch
Still yelling RIP Scoot
I really miss you
Cutty on some new shoes
Fiber glass Dugg
Draggin down Wilshire
I'm on a Spazz hood
I aint gotta check shit
I know that bag good
Raise your hand if you a bitch
That's what she had Dugg
Shout out to my last wood
Come get yo ass whooped
Everything fast too
Shout out my last two
Still holding for the H
I wish we had drew
I'm still holding for the G
I wish we had wild
Still holding it for the hoggs
I'm in my bag now
Them poles used to kill 6's
They killing feds now
Quit telling niggas I been tripping
I'm on my P's & Q's
Dre keep falling asleep on me
I think he need some juice
Say I don't need no autotune
Just bring me all the blues
Young and turnt the label nigga
That shit that's coming soon
How you think you made a nigga
Like you could fuck with me
Val, Tameka and Shanique
They got a truck a piece
Lou you nephew getting big
And you got another niece
They don't know that shit you did
Fuck that nigga, rest in pee
Just got word
The youngin' in there with a thug
I put 5 on him
But they gone do it on the love
10 secure packs
A whole gallon of some spud
That's a tip nigga
You little bitch nigga

They say that nigga ain't rat
Well where that case at
Half of these niggas ain't that
They just can make raps
In public with a fully loaded
Some shit can get you boated
If you ain't trying to kill something
Then why the fuck you toting
A lot of people picked up
But not too many wrote me
She love that I don't give a fuck
That's why I keep her close
She don't wanna war with me
I got too many soldiers
Quit screaming dog you spoil me
Before I bend you over
I'm eating off of royalties
They know my shit cold
One time for the real niggas
Who ain't never told
