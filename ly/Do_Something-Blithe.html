		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see you looking pretty
I think this drink just hit me
I see you stare then look away
Whispering to all my friends that you want me
I’m Counting every second that this goes on
I know that you know that this could be on


So say what you like
Eye to eye
Won’t be waiting here all night
If you want me right

Why don’t you do something about it
Why don’t you do something about it
Stop making these excuses about it
I know you want it
You know you want it

This lighting does so my favours
This is so out of my nature
But we can skip the small talk baby
You come back to mine and maybe
We can hang out and just chill there’s no pressure
if something happens then whatever
Whatever yeah


We can do what you like
Eye to eye
Won’t be waiting here all night
And you want me, right


Why don’t we do something about it
Why don’t we do something about it
Stop making these excuses about it
I know you want it
You know you want it

Why don’t we do something about it
Why don’t we do something about it
Stop making these excuses abo
I know you want it
You know I want it
So do the math

I see you looking pretty
I think this drink just hit me
I see you stare and look away
So Im gonna take the bait

Ooh
Ooh
Im gonna take the bait

We should do something about it
Dont make excuses babe
Dont make excuses babe
I want you baby yeah

So do the math
