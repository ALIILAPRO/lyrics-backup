		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six, sept, huit, neuf 
(Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six, sept, huit, neuf)
Good, un deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six, sept, huit 
(Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six, sept, huit, neuf)
Sept, huit, neuf (sept, huit, neuf)
Sept, huit, neuf (sept, huit, neuf)
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine

My dearest, Angelica, tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
I trust you'll understand the reference to another Scottish tragedy without my having to name the play
They think me Macbeth, and ambition is my folly
I'm a polymath, a pain in the ass, a massive pain
Madison is Banquo, Jefferson's Macduff
And Birnam Wood is Congress on its way to Dunsinane

And there you are, an ocean away
Do you have to live an ocean away
Thoughts of you subside
Then I get another letter
I cannot put the notion away

Take a break
I am on my way
There's a little surprise before supper and it cannot wait
I'll be there in just a minute, save my plate
Alexander (okay, okay)
Your son is nine years old today
He has something he'd like to say
He's been practicing all day
Philip, take it away

Daddy, daddy, look
My name is Philip
I am a poet, I wrote this poem just to show it
And I just turned nine
You can write rhymes but you can't write mine

(What!)
I practice French and play piano with my mother (uh-huh)
I have a sister, but I want a little brother (okay)
My daddy's trying to start America's bank
Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq (bravo!)

Take a break
Hey, our kid is pretty great
Run away with us for the summer, let's go upstate
Eliza, I've got so much on my plate
We can all go stay with my father
There's a lake I know (I know)
In a nearby park (I'd love to go)
You and I can go when the night gets dark
I will try to get away

My dearest Alexander
You must get through to Jefferson
Sit down with him and compromise
Don't stop 'til you agree
Your favourite older sister
Angelica, reminds you
There's someone in your corner all the way across the sea

In a letter I received from you two weeks ago
I noticed a comma in the middle of a phrase
It changed the meaning, did you intend this
One stroke and you've consumed my waking days, it says

My dearest Angelica
With a comma after dearest, you've written
My dearest, Angelica

Anyway, all this to say
I'm coming home this summer at my sister's invitation
I'll be there with your family if you make your way upstate
I know you're very busy I know your work's important
But I'm crossing the ocean and I just can't wait
You won't be an ocean away
You will only be a moment away

Alexander, come downstairs, Angelica's arriving today

Angelica
Eliza
The Schuyler sisters
Alexander
Hi
It's good to see your face

Angelica, tell this man John Adams spends the summer with his family
Angelica, tell my wife John Adams doesn't have a real job anyway
You're not joining us? Wait
I'm afraid I cannot join you upstate

Alexander, I came all this way
She came all this way (all this way, take a break)
You know I have to get my plan through Congress
Run away with us for the summer let's go upstate
I lose my job if I don't get my plan through Congress
We can all go stay with our father
There's a lake I know (I know I'll miss your face) 
(In a nearby park) (screw your courage to the sticking place)
You and I can go (Eliza's right)

Take a break and get away
Run away with us for the summer (let's go upstate)
Where we can stay (we can all go stay with our father)
If you take your time (look around, look around at how lucky we are to be alive right now)
You will make your mark
Close your eyes and dream
(We can go) when the night gets dark
Take a break

I have to get my plan through Congress
I can't stop until I get this plan through Congress
