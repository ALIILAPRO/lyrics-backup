		  Mad at me
Uh (Uh)
You know what I like
Bitch
Uh, from the back, do it how I like

I like to fuck her while she mad at me 
She throw a fit and throw that ass at me
She said if sex was a weapon I'll let you blast at me
That foreign thing cost two hunnid, grind on my grandpappy
Got my baby mamas DM'ing like "Can you CashApp me? 
I be fuckin' once and vamonos
Think you know designer clothes 
They should put me in the PGA, I play a lot of holes
Tiger Gibbs, I hit a Spanish bitch at Italian Vogue
Flip a ho like eighty, Arsenio, you 'bout to spin the glob (Spin the globe)
Pussy wasn't one but I would switch it off the neck, bitch
Made about like Cuban Mack and Dub C, I'm connected
Lawyers got my back, so you can keep me out the check, bitch 
Pictures of these VV's on IG done got you wet, bitch 
Uh, on the set, bitch

I don't like it when you mad at me, girl, don't be mad at me
I don't like it when you mad at me, girl, don't be mad at me
I don't like it when you mad at me, girl, don't be mad at me
Yeah, I don't like it when you mad at me

I'm tired of sayin' sorry for the same shit
Damn near lost my queen, fucking 'round with that lame bitch
Ashamed of myself 'cause I shamed you
Good or bad, right or wrong, we always bang through
The BS or we went out the ES
You wanna buy the mall, I'ma let her no PS
Cars, purses, diamonds, VS
Real ghetto love, two steppin' at the GS 
You thicky thick, go and shake it for me baby (baby)
Picture perfect, let me take it for you baby (baby)
No cap, I ain't shit without you
And I put that on my momma, I'd die for you baby boo
(Baby boo, baby boo)

I don't like it when you mad at me, girl, don't be mad at me
I don't like it when you mad at me, girl, don't be mad at me
I don't like it when you mad at me, girl, don't be mad at me
Yeah, I don't like it when you mad at me

Damn, I see that lil' look you givin' me, oh yeah
Light the sage, let's exchange energy
Nah, I get stupid, you know your man
Do you forgive me, baby? I know you can, know you can
Don't be actin' like you don't want to (for real)
You may not want me, but I sure want you
And lettin' you stay mad is what I sure won't do
'Cause I'm your nigga and you my boo
No matter what (what)
Girl, you wanna run home, go 'head, batter up
See me, I'm tryna go up, baby, ladder up
I ain't lettin' my ego shatter us
And now both of our mamas all mad of us?
Hell nah, come here

I don't like it when you mad at me, girl, don't be mad at me
I don't like it when you mad at me, girl, don't be mad at me
I don't like it when you mad at me, girl, don't be mad at me
Yeah, I don't like it when you mad at me

I don't like it when you mad at me, girl, don't be mad at me
I don't like it when you mad at me, girl, don't be mad at me
