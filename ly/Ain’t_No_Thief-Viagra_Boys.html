		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I showed up to the party in my favorite coat
On the back was an image of a shrimp on a boat
When you saw what I was wearin', you got real upset
And said, "that's the jacket that I got from my grandma"
Oh, well, I promise I ain't seen you before
And maybe your grandma had bought a couple more
And maybe I helped her at the grocery store
And she gave it to me as a gift
Uh, so quit bitchin', motherfucker

I went out on the porch to light a cigarette
I had six or seven lighters in my left pocket
I took out the one that said, "Shrimp City Beach, 1993"
And you told me that's where you had your birthday party
And that the lighters were given as gifts
But I was there, too
Just dippin' my toes down on the beach, man
And I had that lighter specifically made for me, motherfucker, huh

I ain't no thief (he ain't no thief)
I ain't no thief (he ain't no thief)
I said, I ain't no thief (he ain't no thief)
But he's got the same stuff

Huh, I said, I ain't no thief (he's got the same stuff)
(He ain't no thief)
I ain't no thief (he ain't no thief)
I said, I ain't no thief (he ain't no thief)
But he's got the same stuff

We just got the same stuff

I said, we got
We
We got the same stuff, man
I ain't no thief
We just happen to have the same stuff, motherfucker, uh

I recall buyin' this
I recall buyin' this exact lighter when I was fifteen years old
My grandpappy gave it to me as a present
Because I had just finished Boy Scout trainin'
And he was so proud of me, that he decided
To create this lighter in the exact same image of yours

I said, I ain't no thief
I ain't no thief
I said, I ain't no thief
I ain't no thief
We just, oh

I said, I ain't no thief
I ain't no thief
I said, I ain't no thief
I ain't no thief
We just got the same stuff

Enjoy the music on your radio
I found this jacket right outside your store
