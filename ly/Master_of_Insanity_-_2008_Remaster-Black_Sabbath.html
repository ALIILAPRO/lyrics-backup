		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look all around
Can't you open your eyes
Voices are calling

Killing rain falling down from the sky
Crying with nightmare tears

Out on the street
You'll see blood on the ground
Cities are burning

Feeling the pain cutting right to your soul
Goodbye now
You're caught in his spell

Your freedom is gone
He's taken everything
You ever had
But if you're strong you'll survive
You've got to hold on
Open your eyes

[Chorus]
Behind the lies you will see
The master of insanity
Under the mask there will be
The master of insanity

Innocent minds
They're the victims of shame
Staring in sorrow

Promises lying there
Broken and crushed
Confusion-just disappear

What can you give
To be left all alone
When there's nothing at all

Your freedom is gone
He's taken everything
You ever had
But if you're strong you'll survive
You've got to hold on
Open your eyes

[Chorus]

Behind the lies you will find
He's trying to get inside you
Just open your eyes and you will see
The master of insanity

[Chorus]

Between the lies you will find
that he's trying to get inside you
Out of the night into your mind
He's always right beside you

Yeah, between the lies you will see
The master of insanity
Open your eyes or you will be
The master of insanity
