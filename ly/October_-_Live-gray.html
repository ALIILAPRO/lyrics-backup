		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's in smiles
A lover's eyes
It's in joy when it needs no disguise
It's in fairy tales and lullabies
And stories that hold true

It's in hugs
Apple pies
It's in love that grows old and never dies
These things make me glad to be alive

We'll never be able
To treasure life enough
When death comes
My heart is overcome

We'll never be able
To treasure life enough
But when death comes
I start looking up

Little legs
That sit upon a shoulder
It's in blonde curls that won't be there when she's older
It's in raising up what was raised in us
Spending Sunday in a pew

It's in love
Love overcomes it all
It's in memories of back when we were small
Falling leaves and clear blue skies
And all the things we've made it through

We'll never be able
To treasure life enough
When death comes
My heart is overcome

When death comes
It hurts
And I'm not saying it's good to die
When death comes
It feels so undeserved
And I'm not saying it's wrong to cry

Got to speak
Speak the truth
This world could use a lot less strife
Got to say
Say this too
There's a meaning to this movie screen life

Though I'll never be able
To treasure life enough
But when death comes
I try to find a life that will last
Life is going so fast
Life is going so fast

Dear heart
Stay sober
It is only October
Octobers end, and tired hearts mend
