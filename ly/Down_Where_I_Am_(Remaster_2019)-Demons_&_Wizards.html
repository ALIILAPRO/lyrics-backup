		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Isn't it great to see how life begins
Things may change, let the joy begin
Can you hear this new life crying
Breed it out, it will be worth it
Show me your newborn smile

(Please tell me why)
I don't want to hold you
(Please tell me why)
I don't want to see you
'Cause even your smile hurts
Oh it hurts like hell

Isn't it good to see how life begins
There's no sin and there's no crime
Down where I am there's no bitter end at all
This bitterness is endless, keeps going on and on

I don't want to hold you
I don't want to see you
Even birth can bear disgrace
I don't want to hold you
I don't want to see you
Or even the smile upon your face

I fear my heart and fear my soul
And all the things that are unknown
There's a chance things will turn wrong, my friend
Far too fast I'm losing ground
Well, let's face it here and now
You're not wellcome you should know

I fear my heart and fear my soul
Life goes on it surely will
Without me it will wither
Will I ever see light again
Will I ever see light again
Oh life goes on

I don't want to hold you
I don't want to see you
My tear of joy turned into grief
(I don't want to stand it anymore)

Down where I am that's where darkness rules
The silence shall be only friend
