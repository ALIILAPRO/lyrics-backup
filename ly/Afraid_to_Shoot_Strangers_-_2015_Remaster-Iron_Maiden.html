		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lying awake at night, I wipe the sweat from my brow
But it's not the fear, 'cause I'd rather go now
Trying to visualize the horrors that will lay ahead
The desert sand mound a burial ground

When it comes to the time
Are we partners in crime?
When it comes to the time
We'll be ready to die

God let us go now and finish what's to be done
Thy Kingdom come, thy shall be done on earth
Trying to justify to ourselves the reasons to go
Should we live and let live? Forget or forgive?

But how can we let them go on this way?
The reign of terror corruption must end
And we know deep down there's no other way
No trust, no reasoning, no more to say

Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid to shoot strangers

Afraid 
Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid
Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid
Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid
Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid
Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid
Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid
Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid
Afraid to shoot strangers

Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid to shoot strangers
