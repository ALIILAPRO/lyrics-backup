		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A child of a broken mind
The fear that I hide behind
I hate rejection it's the worst
It gravely hurts me

Living inside my head
I feel like the living dead
I need your affection
It's the best
It greatly helps me

With my back against the wall
Trying so hard not to fall
I'm so tired of sleeping around
Hopeless, in despair
Don't know if I'm here or there
Feeling like I'm up and I'm down

But I'm still alive
I don't have any plans to go anywhere you know I'm alive
I know I'm crazy but I still like it here but I'm still alive
I don't have any plans to go anywhere I don't want to die

A head full of tragic schemes
What keeps me alive is dreams
I dream that someday I'll find the key that sets my mind free

You may think I've lost control
The man with the broken soul
I'm not here to try and make excuses
Just believe me

With my back against the wall
Trying so hard not to fall
I'm so tired of sleeping around
Hopeless, in despair
Don't know if I'm here or there
Feeling like I'm up and I'm down

But I'm still alive
I don't have any plans to go anywhere, you know I'm alive
I know I'm crazy but I still like it here but I'm still alive
I don't have any plans to go anywhere I don't want to die, yeah

But I'm still alive
I don't have any plans to go anywhere you know I'm alive
I know I'm crazy but I still like it here but I'm still alive

I don't have any plans to go anywhere, you know I'm alive
I know I'm crazy but I still like it here but I'm still alive

I don't have any plans to go anywhere, you know I'm alive
I know I'm crazy but I still like it here but I'm still alive

I don't have any plans to go anywhere you know I'm alive
I know I'm crazy but I still like it here I don't want to die, yeah

You know I'm alive
You know I'm alive
