		  Woh, oh oh, yeah, yeah
I love you more than I can say
I'll love you twice as much tomorrow
Woh, woh, love you more than I can say 
Woh, oh oh, yeah, yeah
I miss you every single day
Why must my life be filled with sorrow
Woh, woh, love you more than I can say
Don't you know I need you so
Tell me please, I gotta know
Do you mean to make me cry
Am I just another guy?
Woh, oh oh, yeah, yeah
I love you more than I can say
I'll love you twice as much tomorrow
Woh, woh, love you more than I can say 

Don't you know I need you so
Tell me please, I gotta know
Do you mean to make me cry
Am I just another guy?
Woh, oh oh, yeah, yeah
I love you more than I can say
I'll love you twice as much tomorrow
Woh, woh, love you more than I can say
