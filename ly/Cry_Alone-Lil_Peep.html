		  Cry alone right now
I just did a line of blow right now
I don't wanna cry alone right now
I'm kissing on Styrofoam right now

I don't wanna cry alone right now
I'm kissing on Styrofoam right now
I don't wanna die alone right now
I just did a line of blow right now

I don't wanna cry alone right now
Kissing on Styrofoam right now
I don't wanna die alone right now
I just did a line of blow right now

I hate everybody in my hometown
I wanna burn my old high school into the ground
I hate everybody in my hometown
Tell the rich kids to look at me now

I don't wanna cry alone right now
Kissing on Styrofoam right now
I don't wanna die alone right now
I just did a line of blow right now

Gonna fly back to my hometown
I feel like everybody hate me in my hometown
I hate everybody in my hometown
Tell the rich kids to look at me now

I don't wanna cry alone right now
Kissing on Styrofoam right now
I don't wanna die alone right now
I just did a line of blow right now

Gonna fly back to my hometown
I feel like everybody hate me in my hometown
I hate everybody in my hometown
Tell the rich kids to look at me now
I hate everybody in my hometown
I wanna burn my old high school into the ground
I hate everybody in my hometown
Tell the rich kids to look at me now

I really didn't wanna cry alone out loud
I really didn't wanna cry alone out loud
