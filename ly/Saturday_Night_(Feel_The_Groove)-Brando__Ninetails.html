		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let’s talk about real,
Ten shots down in my feels,
You’re a twelve course meal,
And it’s 3 AM in these hills,

We’re going steady but your lover keep DMing ya,
I don’t mean to be petty but I doubt that they can handle ya
I will not bend if you make it last,
Down stormy ends in my sace flats,
Seeing you here through the looking glass,
I want you so bad,

I’m dripping all black seeking on a Saturday night,
Looking for your bright sequin and the thrill of a fight,
I hope it’s not too late, to pump this place,
In all black seeking on a Saturday night,

Let’s talk about sounds,
Make our way to your house
One sip and we bounce,
Cause I’m tripping on verb and your nouns,

We’re going steady but your lover keep DMing ya,
I don’t mean to be petty but I doubt that they can handle ya
I will not bend if you make it last,
Down stormy ends in my sace flats,
Seeing you here through the looking glass,
I want you so bad,

I’m dripping all black seeking on a Saturday night,
Looking for your bright sequin and the thrill of a fight,
I hope it’s not too late, to pump this place,
In all black seeking on a Saturday night,
