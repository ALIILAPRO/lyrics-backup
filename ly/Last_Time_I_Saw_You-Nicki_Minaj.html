		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Beggin' me to stay and then you walk away
There's something that you wanted to say
I was in a rush, but you said you were crushed
And I said, "I'd be back, it's okay"

I wish I'da hugged you tighter the last time that I saw you
I wish I didn't waste precious time the night when I called you
I wish I remembered to say I'd do anything for you
Maybe I pushed you away because I thought that I'd bore you

Listen, so close, but we were so distant
Wish I'da known in that instant
Ignored the hints or I missed it
I killed it
You'd always be in attendance
No flights, but always attendant
Handwritten letter, you penned it
Them nights we wish never ended
Those rules that we wish we bended
Heartbreak that we never mended
Those messages we unsended
Best friends, we somehow unfriended
Ain't care 'bout who we offended
Parties they wish we attended
Got drunk and laughed, it was splendid

I wish I'da hugged you tighter the last time that I saw you
I wish I didn't waste precious time the night when I called you
I wish I remembered to say I'd do anything for you
Maybe I pushed you away because I thought that I'd bore you

Starlight, starbright
First star I see tonight
Wish I may, I wish I might
Have the wish I wish tonight
Starlight, starbright
First star I see tonight
Wish I may, I wish I might
Have the wish I wish tonight

Bombs away
Bombs away
Bombs away
Bombs away

Dream about you
Dream about you
Dream about you
I still dream about you

I wish I'da hugged you tighter the last time that I saw you (saw you)
I wish I didn't waste precious time the night when I called you (called you)
I knew the moment I met you that I'd always adore you ('dore you)
Maybe I pushed you away because I thought that I'd (I'd)
Bore you
