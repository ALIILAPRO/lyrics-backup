		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You never know
When it says you gotta go
Hellfudge
To them cheap motels down in Baton Rouge
Hellfudge
Roll down the window of the limousine
Hellfudge
I'll pay you fifteen bucks if you perform for me (No more)
Hellfudge
I ain't givin' you one penny more
Gotta buy another TV station for the Lord
Hellfudge
Can you imagine what it's like
To have to flash and pose
Hellfudge
While a fat preacher
Sits and beats off in front of you
Hellfudge
Same one who's so obsessed with
With anti-smut crusades (fancy that)
Hellfudge
Oh Lord,
Someone let the air out of my tires
Hellfudge
I'm stuck-with my pants down
Red handed in sin
But with money like mine
The Lord always forgives me
When I'm dictator
You will ALL
Be under the iron thumb of Jeezus
The law of the land
Executions for witchcraft
Televised live at five
All Rock and Roll is pornography
That mixed coed swimming-phooey
I tell ya
It promotes problems of the flesh
Problems of the flesh
The flesh
The flesh
The flesh
I can't stand it anymore
My fundamentalist army's
Crackin' down full swirl
Hellfudge
Polyester suit nazis
Will control the world
Hellfudge
If you think Khomeini
Is a step back in time
Hellfudge
Just wait til I decide
What you read and who dies
Hellfudge
You think we're finished
Boy, you must be queer
We get a little stronger
Every year
When I bilk your money
I'm moral, man
But I got a little problem
I just can't say no
To that Hellfudge
So take off them clothes
Slowly now, slowly
And twitch your little flounder just like that
Yehhhh, Just like they do
In all the smut rags I pretend to hate so much
Bite down real hard
Smile slut
I own you, Look humiliated, try to cry
I despise you so much I hate myself
Mmmmmm
Tastes almost as good
As one of them green bubblegum cigars
Yeh! Hellfudge
There's a whole lotta Shakin' goin' on in here
But don't tell my cousin, ok
Yeeeeh
Great Balls 'o' Fire
Hellfudge
