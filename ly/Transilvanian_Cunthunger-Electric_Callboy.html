		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have to satisfy the hunger of flesh
Spread your cunt wide
I feel the transilvanian-cunthunger

Lord vagina
Loves sex on fire!

Tonight! Tonight!
Tonight's the night of the dead!
Let up your rotten asses
And fuck the brain in your head
Tonight! Tonight!
The girls are horrified
They look like sexy monsters
It's graveyard party time

Hi it's gentleman in da house
I will fuck every girl in this room tonight
Just get on your knees and take it fucking deep

Meet you for a diner at my slaughter house
Baby my fangs meet your neck
Your blood fills my mouth

In my arms
Let me take you to the other side
Let me show you the better way
Let's fly away!

Let's fly away yeah!

Transilvanian-cunthunger
I feel the beast inside

Tonight! Tonight!
Tonight's the night of the dead!
Get up your rotten asses
And fuck the brain in your head
Tonight! Tonight!
The girls are horrified
They look like sexy monsters
It's graveyard party time

Yeah!
Everybody has to groove to the music
Girls shake their booties
To the sound of horror

Everybody has to groove to the music

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Who's gonna rock this party?
Right now!
