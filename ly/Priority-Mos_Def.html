		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, top priority

Peace before everything
God before anything
Love before anything
Real before everything

Home before anyplace
Truth before anything
Style and state radiate
Love power slay the hate

Truth killer, flaky face
Players say it to they face
Ain't afraid to major straight
Grace at the table straight

Flow greatest like the greatest lakes
Capes all greatest states
Quiet water major waves

Steer the course make a way
And come ashore on a greater day
Home grown from the greatest grain
Full flavor in the native strain
Now put that on your brainy brain

Full exposure to faith and slang
Minimum wage and major gains
Yasiin Dante to Bey
From day to night to day to day they came to play
We came to stay get out the way

Biotch sunspot hot heat rocks
Brooklyn finest, preservation to beat box
Friend or foe poison or detox
When we rock the people I respond priority

Peace before anything
God before everything
Love before anything
Real before everything

Home before anyplace
Truth before anything
Style and state radiate
Love power slay the hate, priority
Love power
