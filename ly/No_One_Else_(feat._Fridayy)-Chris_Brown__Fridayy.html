		  Ooh-ooh

Every type of love blinded me, oh-oh
Face to face, girl, and can't even see (ayy, ayy)
I know you would never lie to me (no)
Trying hard to, but can't even breathe (breathe, oh)
A little bit of oxygen is all we need (need, oh)
A little bit of mind control is what you do to me (oh-oh)
I'm falling hard and harder as you got my heart in your palm
Need you in my arms

Girl, I need you the most when you're gone (ooh)
I've tried to keep you holding on
'Cause I don't wanna see you with no one else
Ooh-ooh-ooh
No, no, no one else (no one else, oh)
Ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah, yeah)
No, no, no one else (ooh, no one else)

Ain't no me without you, lil' mama
Can't wait to wrap my eyes and my arms around you
And slide between your waist and thighs
Pum-pum, ayy, I want more
Can you give me just one more?
Girl, sign me up-up
You give me life
Don't your waste your breath, don't need to say, "It's okay"
We could have been any place or situation, I'll take it (oh)
All I need's to see your face or I'll fall from grace
'Cause I can't go another day

Girl, I (I) need you the most when you're gone (gone, girl, I)
I've tried (I've tried, I've tried) to keep you holding on
'Cause I don't wanna see you with no one else (no)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
No, no, no one else (ooh, no one else, yeah)
No, no, no one else (no one else)

Hey, girl, I just want your body
No, no, girl, you don't need nobody
Oh-oh-oh, girl, let me give you lovin'
And we ain't gotta tell nobody
Go-go-go low when you whine your body (yeah, yeah)
Wanna feel you all up on it
Wanna-wanna-wanna see you ride it for me
No, girl, you don't need nobody
Hey, girl, I just want your body
No, no, girl, don't need nobody
Oh-oh-oh, girl, let me give you lovin'
And we ain't gotta tell nobody
Go-go-go low when you whine your body (yeah)
Wanna feel you all up on it
Wanna-wanna see you ride it for me
No, girl, you don't need nobody

Girl, I need you the most when you're gone
I've tried to keep you holding on
'Cause I don't wanna see you with no one else (no)
No, no, no one else (no, no, no)
No, no, no one else (yeah, oh-woah, oh-woah)
