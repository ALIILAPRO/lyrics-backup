		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see you're still stuck on your same old
Hanging out in places you shouldn't be
You know I'm still stuck on getting older
Living in the past is my specialty

And your 4Runner, is runnin' up north these days?
I bet it gets lonely, no one's there to keep you sane
And the cold weather must be slowing you down
Oh, I still wonder why you'd ever wanna leave this town

I see you're still doing the same old
Hanging out with people like me
You know I'm trying to get a little bolder
So, this town is where I'd rather you be

And your 4Runner, is runnin' up north these days?
I'll say it gets lonely when you're not here past my hallways
Did you drop your crown on your way out now?
'Cause, oh, I swear, something 'bout you is changed

Oh, this town is empty now
And your crown has lost its power
'Cause you've changed
But you've only changed from me

Hm, kept those wise words from the letters you wrote me
And your creased pages of your journal entries
Talking 'bout how you wish your life would change

And your 4Runner, is runnin' up north these days?
I bet it gets crazy moving 'round to never stay
Did I let you down on your way back now?
'Cause, oh, I swear, something 'bout me is changed

Oh, this town is empty now
And your crown has lost its power
'Cause you've changed
But you've only changed from me
Oh, this boy is broken now
Wondering why you let him down
But you've changed
And I'm the only one who sees

Yeah
Whoa
