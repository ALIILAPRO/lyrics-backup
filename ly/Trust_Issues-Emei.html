		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Had a dream where they shaved my head
Top model, makeover stitch
Heads up from the subconscious
New look, still I got upset
Got a doctor on the interweb
Say it means I need a safety net
New faces leaving me on read
New cities getting to my head

Calling them incompetent 'cause I might need control
Recovering perfectionist, I'm learning to let go

I've got trust issues
Jumpin' out the plane without a parachute
Micromanage up until I blow a fuse
Don't like it when they tell me
But I know I do, I've got trust issues

Everybody likes to give advice (calm down)
Optimists are hard to fight
Telling me how to live my life (my life)
Take it chill, give it time
But I'm impatient, like to plan ahead (ahead)
Gotta be ten out of ten (I'm a ten)
When I see it going out of line
Tell myself it's a waste of time

Calling them incompetent 'cause I might need control
Recovering perfectionist, I'm learning to let go

I've got trust issues
Jumpin' out the plane without a parachute
Micromanage up until I blow a fuse
Don't like it when they tell me
But I know I do (I know I do)
I've got trust issues (I know I do)

I've got trust issues

But I know I do
I've got trust issues
