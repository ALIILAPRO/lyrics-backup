		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you fall asleep down by the water
Baby I'll carry you, all the way home

If you fall asleep down by the water
Baby I'll carry you, all the way home

Everybody's gotta love some one
But I just wanna love you dear
Everybody's gotta feel something
But I just want to be with you, my dear

I know it's hard
I know it's hard
I know it's hard to be in this position
If they stop loving you
I won't stop loving you
If they stop needing you
I'll still need you, my dear

If you fall asleep down by the water
Baby I'll carry you, all the way home

If you fall asleep down by the water
Baby I'll carry you, all the way home

You've gotta believe me
When I say
When I say the word forever
And whatever
Comes your way
Oh we'll still be together

I know it's hard
I know it's hard
But I understand you, just take my hand

If you fall asleep down by the water
Baby I'll carry you, all the way home

If you fall asleep down by the water
Baby I'll carry you, all the way home
