		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I felt you underneath the moonlight 
As electric as the rain
Falling still

Trace the colors of our soul
Wake us up when it's all over
Over 

Take you higher 
We'll stay alive to see the light
Until then don't wake me up
If only for tonight

Take you higher
After tonight we'll be above
Until then, don't wake me up 
Don't wake me up 

I'll hold you closer until the starlight 
Fades into the night
One last time

So drain the color from our eyes
Don't wake us up until we say it
It's over 

Take you higher 
We'll stay alive to see the light
Until then don't wake me up
If only for tonight

Take you higher
After tonight we'll be above
Until then don't wake me up 
Don't wake me up 

Come down before the hour 
By tomorrow we'll be lost
Slow now before the hour
And remember this broken song 

Come down before the hour 
By tomorrow we'll be lost
Slow now before the hour
And remember this broken song 

Take you higher 
We'll stay alive to see the light
Until then don't wake me up
If only for tonight

Take you higher
After tonight we'll be above
Until then don't wake me up 
Don't wake me up
