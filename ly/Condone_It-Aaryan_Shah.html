		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I loved you through all of the pain that he brought you, I hope that you know that
You left me on read so now I’m assuming that you’re tryna ignore that
Your bottle is empty so it’s safe to say you forgot who’s important
I’ll never get used to the fact that you want him, I’ll never condone it

Don’t cry again
I won’t wipe your tears this time
You lied to him
Told him you’re out of his life
You said you loved me
I was so stupid
You lied to me
I must have got used to it

I just wanna know the reason that you don’t wanna be with me, and
I hope you know I still believe in the promises you made to leave him
I’m struggling for words here, all I’m saying is I’ve been here
All this time I’ve been real
All this time, All this time I’ve been here

I loved you through all of the pain that he brought you, I hope that you know that
You left me on read so now I’m assuming that you’re tryna ignore that
Your bottle is empty so it’s safe to say you forgot who’s important
I’ll never get used to the fact that you want him, I’ll never condone it

I loved you through all of the pain that he brought you, I hope that you know that
You left me on read so now I’m assuming that you’re tryna ignore that
Your bottle is empty so it’s safe to say you forgot who’s important
I’ll never get used to the fact that you want him, I’ll never condone it

I changed my ways hoping you’d change your mind
My first mistake was letting you waste my time

I don’t ever wanna face it, that you and I will never make it
It’s time for you to finally face it, he never loved you he just faked it
I’m struggling for words here, all I’m saying is I’ve been here
All this time I’ve been real
All this time, All this time I’ve been here

I loved you through all of the pain that he brought you, I hope that you know that
You left me on read so now I’m assuming that you’re tryna ignore that
Your bottle is empty so it’s safe to say you forgot who’s important
I’ll never get used to the fact that you want him, I’ll never condone it

I loved you through all of the pain that he brought you, I hope that you know that
You left me on read so now I’m assuming that you’re tryna ignore that
Your bottle is empty so it’s safe to say you forgot who’s important
I’ll never get used to the fact that you want him, I’ll never condone it

--pain that he brought you, I hope that you know that
--so now I’m assuming that you’re tryna ignore that
--it’s safe to say you forgot who’s important
