		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please don't lose your cool
I'm a thread in the sea,
Not a threat to your pool

Face down with my head in the grass
Set the field on fire, 
Breathe the ash for a while
As you watch me burn

Fixed to a page, I can't unread
You twist your face, I can't unsee
In the pit of my gut
I thought I knew who you'd be
I stow the lock, Swallow the key

Face down with my head in the grass
Set the field on fire, 
Breathe the ash for a while
As you watch me burn

Fixed to a page, I can't unread
You twist your face, I can't unsee
In the pit of my gut
I thought I knew who you'd be
I stow the lock, Swallow the key

If it's a race, I can't compete
You shoot to start, Aim down at me
It was all a blur
I thought I knew who you were
