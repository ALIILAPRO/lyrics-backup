		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now you're gone, it's hotels and whiskey and sad-luck dames
And I don't care if they miss me, I never remember their names
They say if you get far enough away, you'll be on your way back home
Well, I'm at the station, and I can't get on the train

Must be blind love
Only kind of love is stone blind love
Blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
With your blind love
Oh, it's blind love
Stone blind love
It's your stone blind love

Now the street's turning blue, the dogs are barking and the night has come
And there's tears that are falling from your blue eyes now
I wonder where you are
And I whisper your name
The only way to find you is if I close my eyes

I'll find you with my blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
With your blind love
Oh, your blind love
Your stone blind love

It's your blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
Stone blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
With your blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
Stone blind love
Stone blind love
