		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She says 
It helps with the lights out
Her rabid glow 
Is like braille to the night 
She swears 
I'm a slave to the details
But if your life is such a big joke
Why should I care? 

The clock is set for nine 
But you know you're gonna make it eight
So that you two can take some time
Teach each other to reciprocate 

She feels that my sentimental side 
Should be held with kids gloves
But she doesn't know 
That I left my urge in the icebox 

She swears 
I'm just prey for the female
Well then hook me up and throw me baby cakes
'Cause I like to get hooked 

The clock is set for nine 
But you know you're gonna make it eight
All the people that you've loved 
They're all bound to leave some keepsakes 

I've been swinging all the time
Think it's time I learned your way
I picture you and me together 
In the jungle it will be okay 

I'll bring you when my lifeboat 
Sails through the night
That is supposing that
You don't sleep tonight 

It's like learning a new language
Helps me catch up on my mind
If you don't bring up those lonely parts
This could be a good time 

It's like learning a new language
You come here to me
We'll collect those lonely parts 
And set them down
You come here to me

She says brief things
Her love's a pony
My love's subliminal

She says brief things
Her love's a pony
My love's subliminal
