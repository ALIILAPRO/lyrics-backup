		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know how I'm comin', nigga
Free Bank, Free Sheff
Fross, Free Sheba, Free Marlon (Narline)
Free brodie, yo
Yo, free all the guys, you hear me?
Look

Lot of pain, you could feel it
Just try not to get all in your feelings
Any situation, you can kill it
Just remember, you one of the realest
I can't lie, I do get in my feelings
But I still gotta handle my business
When I pull up, them windows is, uh
When I pull up, the windows is tinted
I can't lie, I be stuck in the mix
Pts got me clutchin' a stick
Sippin' medicine, baby, I'm sick
Pass the grabba, this spliff gotta hit
Drop the addy, we spinnin' your strip
Love the .40, that shit got a kick
Yeah, I know that they wanted me dead
So don't act like you proud of me, bitch
My lil' brother keep one in the head
He said, "Fuck it, you know how it get"
You said, I'll never be what I said
I'm like, "Fuck it, I'm makin' it lit"
Good fit, gotta take me a flick
I just do it, tell Nike to quit
Fuck the fame I just wanna be, uh
Fuck the fame I just wanna be rich
Shorty tryna kick it like karate man
Eat a Perky like a Jolly Ranch'
Police say they got me on the bodycam
Had the choppa, shit got out of hand
I don't really know him, he ain't from the land
Young fly nigga, never land
Smoke up, I get high as a kite
Shorty said she gon' ride like a bike
I can't lie, I think shorty my type
Bad lil' bitch and I know what she like
Uh, like, uh, like
Baby, pull up, I'm here for the night
I was broke, ain't seen no one in sight
How you gon' trip 'cause I'm takin' a flight
Uh, flight, uh, flight?
Watch your back, don't get caught at the light
Way too clean, had to dirty the Sprite
Bro, if you lackin', you losin' your life
Got the sauce but ain't usin' right
Said I'm whack, now they sayin' I'm nice
Shorty on me like white on the rice
You do what you can, I do what I like
And my life, you don't know what it's like
'Member I couldn't get no advice
Fuckin' up, now he got you on ice
Lil' bro took your chain, now wearin' your ice
Uh, ice, uh, ice
In the field gotta stay with a pipe
Gotta move like a thief in the night
I can't stick around, girl, I'm leavin' tonight
For the feature I'm switchin' the price
Shit when up, gotta talk to me nice
Walk with me, I'll show you a vibe
If you scared, then you ain't gotta slide
Told that boy, "You should go back inside
You thinkin' of switchin' then stay on your side"
Suicide how she hang with the guys
Beat the case, now they droppin' the charge
But it's hard to believe in a God
'Cause most of my niggas ain't beatin' the odds
But I know they still pray to the Lord
Like, fuck it, I know they still riskin' it all
In my city this shit like a war
If they get up on me, I'm gettin' it off
Uh, off, uh, off

Yeah (uh, uh)
Yeah
Yeah (uh)
Yeah
