		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh yeah

Loneliness is always looking for a friend
It found me once 
And it has been around since then 
Loneliness is never waiting by the door
It sweeps right through 
And it will never be ignored

Why, why was I chosen?
Why am I left without?

The love of my life 
The love that I need
The love that they say is in life for free
The love of my dreams 
The love that I want
Loneliness knows me by name

Loneliness knows everything I keep inside
My endless thoughts in the silence of the night
Loneliness is the one who made me see
Ain't nobody else who can make a change but me, no

Why, why was I chosen?
Why am I left without? (Oh yeah-yeah-yeah)

The love of my life 
The love that I need
The love that they say is in life for free
The love of my dreams 
The love that I want
Loneliness knows me by name (oh)

Less is more and that would be the vacant space 
The cried out tears and a never ending maze
Oh, I have found what only loneliness provides
A strength within knowing I will find

The love of my life 
The love that I need (love of my life)
The love that they say is in life for free
The love of my dreams 
The love that I want
Loneliness knows me by name

The love of my life (love of my life)
The love that I need (love that I need)
The love that they say is in life for free (oh yeah)
The love of my dreams 
The love that I want
Loneliness knows me by name
