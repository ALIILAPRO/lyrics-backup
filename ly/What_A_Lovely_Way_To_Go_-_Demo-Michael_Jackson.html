		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give me some lovin', and I wanna make it
Everything I do
I know my darling's a dreamer
And I wanna say that life is here for you

But I don't need the right to know
Everything you do
I don't need the right to show but feel
Everybody everybody
Everybody oh

Oh, what a lovely way to go
Never let your feelings show
He was gettin' it down (yeah)
Talkin' in threes (Hi)
Hurtin' my mind, but my power was to feel
Oh, what a lovely way to go
Never let your feelings show
He was gettin' it down (yeah)
Talkin' in threes (Woah)
Hurtin' my mind, but my power was feel

Heard you woe a loser
But it seems you that don't
Know the things I know
And if you are believing don't
Repent that you will know where I go

But I don't need the right to know
Everything she does
But she don't need the need to show but feel
Everybody (yeah) everybody (yeah)
Everybody ho

Oh, what a lovely way to go
Never let your feelings show
He was gettin' it down (yeah)
Talkin' in threes (Woah)
Hurtin' my mind, but my power was to feel
Oh, what a lovely way to go
Never let your feelings show
He was gettin' it down (Alright)
Talkin' in threes (Okay)
Hurtin' my mind, but my power was to feel
Hoo hoo

Gimme a chance babe!
Just to see you smile (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
Gimme a chance babe (Gimme a chance babe)
And I'll make it easy for you (Easy for you)
(Easy for you)

I heard you woe a loser
But don't say that you must get all the time
(Hurt so many times)
And don't be just pretending
That it's all knowing love is here inside

But I don't need the right to know
(Don't need)
Everything she does (C'mon girl)
But give me time and I will show (Hee)
To everybody everybody (yeah)
Everybody (Woah) oh

Oh, what a lovely way to go
Never let your feelings show
I start cutting it down (Alright)
Talkin' in threes (yeah)
Hurtin' my mind, but my power was to feel

Oh, what a lovely way to go
(Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee)
Never let your feelings show (Ow)
