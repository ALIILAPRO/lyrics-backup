		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’ve been sitting here
Sipping on the clear
Tequila poured over ice
I see you there
In that dress you wear
Goddamn you looking so fine
I’m in my feels
And you in your heels
And you got me losing my mind
You got me wasting my time
But girl you’re catching my eye

Baby you know that I’m bad
But lemme take you to the back, yeah
I see the look in your eyes
I know you wanna take a crack, yeah
We could dip out of the club
And head on over to my pad, yeah
Hop in the Rari and split
And maybe spend a couple bags, yeah

I’ll tell you all the things I wanna do
We’ll spend the night locked in the hotel room
We’ll have a drink, shit maybe have a few
Let’s toast to me and you

Can I persuade ya?
I wanna take you right back to my place, yeah
Undress you in a hundred different ways, yeah
And we don’t have to tell a fucking soul baby, yeah
Let’s make mistakes, yeah
We’ll go until the bed frame fucking breaks, yeah
I’ll dive into your body like a lake, yeah
And we don’t have to tell a fucking soul baby, yeah

I know I’m not the guy that you can take home to your mom
But honestly I’m only looking for a little fun
We can pour the drink and hit the blunt until we see the sun
Once the night is over, see you later girl, I gotta run

Please don’t get way too attached
You know damn well we ain’t a match, yeah
I ain’t tryna break your heart
I’m only tryna break the back, yeah
If I was looking for love
Then honestly you’d be a catch, yeah
I don’t got anymore trust
I spent all the shit in the past, yeah

I’ll tell you all the things I wanna do
We’ll spend the night locked in the hotel room
We’ll have a drink, shit maybe have a few
Let’s toast to me and you

Can I persuade ya?
I wanna take you right back to my place, yeah
Undress you in a hundred different ways, yeah
And we don’t have to tell a fucking soul baby, yeah
Let’s make mistakes, yeah
We’ll go until the bed frame fucking breaks, yeah
I’ll dive into your body like a lake, yeah
And we don’t have to tell a fucking soul baby, yeah

I’ll tell you all the things I wanna do
We’ll spend the night locked in the hotel room
We’ll have a drink, shit maybe have a few
Let’s toast to me and you

Can I persuade ya?
I wanna take you right back to my place, yeah
Undress you in a hundred different ways, yeah
And we don’t have to tell a fucking soul baby, yeah
Let’s make mistakes, yeah
We’ll go until the bed frame fucking breaks, yeah
I’ll dive into your body like a lake, yeah
And we don’t have to tell a fucking soul baby, yeah

Can I persuade ya?
Can I persuade ya?
Can I persuade ya?
Can I persuade ya?
