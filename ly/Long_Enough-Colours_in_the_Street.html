		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were hiding for long enough
Every lightening you turn it off
In a smile you come across
You’re alive, only lost
Don’t wanna lose you

Broken walls and yet, you know you’re not in a dream
You can hear the air the tears but not the coffee machine
Come and walk with me I’ve been on this road of my own
Let me spare you the feeling of being alone

You were hiding for long enough
Every lightening you turn it off
In a smile you come across
You’re alive, only lost
Don’t wanna lose you
Don’t wanna lose you

You can move and yet it’s like you’re stuck in the sand
I’m not sure but maybe you’re given a hand
I’m a look in the mirror, I’m not different at all
Let me spare you the fear of taking the fall

You were hiding for long enough
Every lightening you turn it off
In a smile you come across
You’re alive, only lost
Don’t wanna lose you
Could never lose you

It’s a long way from home
But I knew
I’m a long way from home
In a loop, I think of you
I’m smiling too
