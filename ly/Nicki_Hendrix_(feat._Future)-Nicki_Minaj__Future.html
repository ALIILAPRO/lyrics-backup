		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Feeling destructive
Leads to destruction
Break it down
Just to build it up again
Lovin' again
From lost lovin'
Break it down
To build it up again

Let me just be honest this one time
We ain't that different
We ain't that different
See the mentions
We made it special, thought I could leave
We ain't that different
We ain't that different

I saw all my missed texts, I wanted to clear 'em
I feel like if he really love you, how you let my love near you?
Girl, open your fears up, I had to tear up
How was I thinkin' 'bout you when I'm shakin' hands with your superior?
I knew you was somethin' serious, wanted to protect you
Never upset you, just wanted to sex you
Never, ever would've left you
Tell me, I'll come back and get you
He give you issues
But never no tissues

(This one time)
We ain't that different
We ain't that different
See the mentions
We made it special, thought I could leave
We ain't that different
We ain't that different
We ain't that different
We ain't that different
See the mentions
We made it special, thought I could leave
We ain't that different
We ain't that different

Don't you walk away from me (from me)
How you let me-e-e walk away from you?
Baby, did you think there were a million mes?
I guess I underestimated you too
Well, sorta
I thought you were smarter
This pussy taste like water
I would've had your daughter, had your empire in order
Nah, you ain't even a starter
I'm Ewing in the fourth quarter
And after I ball then that jet gon' get chartered (yeah)
(Mhm) it's amazing, all my shit is blazin'
Isn't it amazin'? Blazin'
I know you love when I sing
Isn't this shit frightening?
Bling hittin' like lightning, lightning (ooh)
I thought you (knew)
Boy, you should've (known)
I thought you knew, knew

Let me just be honest this one time
We ain't that different
We ain't that different
See the mentions
We made it special, thought I could leave
We ain't that different
We ain't that different
We ain't that different
We ain't that different
See the mentions
We made it special, thought I could leave
We ain't that different
We ain't that different

Feeling destructive
Leads to destruction
Pray I get through
Just to build it up again
Love's up again
Forever for our lovin'
Break it down
To build it up again

Let me just be honest this one time
We ain't that different
We ain't that different
We ain't that different
We ain't that different
We ain't that different
We ain't that different
See the mentions
We made it special, fallin' for weakness
We ain't that different
We ain't that different
