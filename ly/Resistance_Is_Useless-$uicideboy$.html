		  Huh, North
Ooh-ooh

On them meds like Darko, riding, scheming on a mission
Anna for the static in my hood, I bring the friction
Chucky with the blade, fuck a movie, this ain't fiction
I stay stacking up addictions, million dollar drug dependance, yuh
Pimping like I'm skinny when I'm riding through the city
Fuck them undercovers, all them feds got is a theory
9th Ward to Gentilly, I'm the junkie of the century (North)
Chain wet like Lake Eerie, $licky the Scarecrow
That they fearing on that Northside
Gang tied with the 59 (Grey)
Fuck it, just kill em' all, they gonna blame Sam Hyde
Always taper on, what the fuck is taper off?
You see this tattoo on my head, the fuck you resuscitate me for?
Scoping out with that beam, touch your head like I'm a prophet
Slightly nodding off that fent, but rub me wrong, I get it poppin'
Attacking the hood like Benghazi (yeah)
Better fear Grey like a Stasi (yeah)
Hoes they love Young Wetto, screaming "FÃ³llame culo, papi"

Let me tone it down before the ice caps melt
Grab the devil by the horns, for that I might catch Hell
White velvet on my bitch look like Marie Antoinette
Every time she give me head, it's like my dick was a threat
Cheney with the shotgun, I ain't aim at shit
Fuck your Spotify playlists, TikTok trends, y'all lame as shit
You gon' catch these fucking hands like a baseball mitt
You got any last words? I bet they taste like clit
Captain of the grey, I'm going down with the ship
Down with the shit, I split just about everything with $lick
Still in that 7th, ain't nothing has changed
Still wearing FTP fits to the grave (Yeah)
Still fuck the fame, fuck the pressure and pain
Only thing changed is I cut off my mane

Hey Oddy, this is -
You must have got the text message this morning
At 8, we are trying to get you in on this Zoom meeting with -
Was able to manipulate hrr schedule and have that 9 o'clock open
I only gave you guys an hour notice
But we tried to, tried to make it work for - to work her magic
So if you want to jump on this I could sent it to you, okay
Take a look at the Zoom room
And if you don't seem to have it
Just text your cousin, he can send it to you, thank you
