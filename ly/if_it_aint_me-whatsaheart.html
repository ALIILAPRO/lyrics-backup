		<p>
		  Who you looking pretty for?
If it aint me
Tell me who you gonna call?
If it aint me
Theres no one else for you baby
If they aint me
Your friends know you want me Baby that's why they hate me
Why you going out for?
If it aint with me
I'll close the door and
Bring you back to me yeah
No one can see you baby
If they aint me
Your friends know I have you baby
Thats why they hate me

Yeah i'll never let you go this time
You're all mine
I know that it worrys you sometimes
You'll be fine

Tell me baby why you tryna get Away? girl what I got to do
To make you wanna stay?
When you cry you keep
Shouting my name
Please tell me why
I love when you're in pain
Girl I think you got me going insane
I feel it in my brain
I'm all yours to tame
(dont run away)
If feelings were to change
I'd break everything
Just give it to me

Who you looking pretty for?
Tell me who you looking pretty for

Tell me who you looking pretty for?
If it aint me
Tell me who you gonna call?
If it aint me
Theres no one else for you baby
If they aint me
Your friends know you want me Baby that's why they hate me
Why you going out for?
If it aint with me
I'll close the door and
Bring you back to me yeah
No one can see you baby
If they aint me
Your friends know I have you baby
Thats why they hate me
