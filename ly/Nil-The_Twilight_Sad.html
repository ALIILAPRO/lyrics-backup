		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I remember that day
It was her last
And when the tempers that fray
Can't go back

Be careful what you're selling
You can't take a telling
No reason to your lesson

Is that you Son? 
Is what you used to say

Now you're content in your ways, content in your ways,
Who cares if she stays, and counting your days

And I remember that day
It was her last
And when the tempers that fray
Can't go back

Be careful what you're selling
Careful what you're selling
You can't take a telling

Is that you son? It's what you used to say

Now you're content in your ways
Content in your ways
Content in your ways
Content in your ways
Content in your ways
Content in your ways
Content in your ways
Content in your way

There is only one way that it's gonna end
Only one way that it's gonna end
Is that you son? Is what you used to say

And there's a bedroom around the corner
Her bedroom across the hall
If you'd been there, seen her, fall to the ground
Been there, seen her, fall to the ground

Was it mine to give away?
It wasn't mine to give away

If you'd been there, seen her, fall to the ground
Been there, seen her, fall to the ground

No answer. 
When you asked her over
No answer.
When you called over
And I can't wake her no more

Because we all knew who's fault it was
And we all knew who's fault it was
And I won't wake her no more

Because we all knew who's fault it was
And we all knew who's fault it was
And we all knew who's fault it was
And we all knew who's fault it was

And I write your requiem the day your dead
And I write your requiem the day your dead
Time. One day, goodbye.
Another one. Like her

And I write your requiem the day your dead
And I write your requiem the day your dead
And I won't wake no one

Because we all knew who's fault it was
And we all knew who's fault it was

And I write your requiem the day your dead
And I write your requiem the day your dead
Die, one day, goodbye
Another one

And I write your requiem the day your dead
And I write your requiem the day your dead
