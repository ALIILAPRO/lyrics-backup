		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What do I do when I come down?
Don't leave me here alone to drown
Floating around like fireflies
Slowly sinking in my thoughts

Teeth feel like Jaws inside my mouth
Clenching my tongue to stay alive
I can barely close my eyes
I feel the butterflies inside

Everything's blurry
Everyone's glowing, oh no
Glowing

Tell me your story
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
To do

I don't wanna come down
Come down
(I don't, I don't)
I don't wanna come down
Come down
(I don't, I don't)

Fake friends wanna break and steal your light
Goddamn, you can make them feel alright
Fake friends wanna break and steal your light
Goddamn, goddamn, goddamn

Fake friends wanna break and steal your light
Goddamn, you can make them feel alright
Fake friends wanna break and steal your light
Goddamn, goddamn, goddamn

Tell me your story
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
To do

I don't wanna come down
Come down
(I don't, I don't)
I don't wanna come down

Fake friends wanna break and steal your light
Goddamn, you can make them feel alright (come down)
Fake friends wanna break and steal your light (I don't)
Goddamn, goddamn, goddamn (I don't)
