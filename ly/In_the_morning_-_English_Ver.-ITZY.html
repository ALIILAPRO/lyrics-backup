		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shh
Guess who loves you, yeah, that's right
Do I show you, no, not I
Where's the mystery, it's not time
Get you close, I get you close then bam! In the dead of the night

I'm a steal your heart away
You are gonna love me
You won't even know what hit ya till I'm baring my teeth
'Cause I'm so good at playing the role
I won't be the first one to fold
If loving you makes me a felon, whodunit who?
You'll never know

Am I getting you, getting you just a little confused
You know I never could, never could stick to all of the rules
Well it's finally, finally time to make up your mind
Hope you're ready, who knows what could happen in the night

I'm the mafia (ma ma ma ma mafia ya)
We do it like a mafia (ring, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding)
I'm the mafia (ma ma ma ma mafia ya)
We do it like a mafia
Watch your back until the break of day

Target in the night, you don't even know (ay)
Hit you like the mafia (ay)
In the morning light, you don't even know (ay)
Hit you like the mafia

Oscar worthy, got you fooled
Playing innocent but I'm a wolf (no)
You don't have the faintest clue (uh huh)
I been planning for a while, baby all systems are go

Better watch your, watch your heart
'Cause you're no match for me
I'm a break in, break in, break in
Like a caper movie (ready)
Can you read my poker face
Hit me, I'm raising the stakes
Hurry up baby, catch me if you can, haha

Am I getting you, getting you just a little confused
You know I never could, never could stick to all of the rules
Well it's finally, finally time to make up your mind
Hope you're ready, who knows what could happen in the night

I'm the mafia (ma ma ma ma mafia ya)
We do it like a mafia (ring, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding)
I'm the mafia (ma ma ma ma mafia ya)
We do it like a mafia
Hit you like the mafia

Been moving slow undercover baby
You know in the morning
I'm the last one standing, yeah yeah
(MA) my lil' game 
(FI) finishes tonight
(A) I'ma get ya (hahaha)

I'm the mafia (ma ma ma ma mafia ya)
We do it like a mafia (ring, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding)
I'm the mafia (ma ma ma ma mafia ya)
We do it like a mafia
Watch your back until the break of day

Target in the night, you don't even know (ay)
Hit you like the mafia (ay)
In the morning light, you don't even know (ay)
Hit you like the mafia
