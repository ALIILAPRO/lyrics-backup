		  (Going nowhere)
(Going nowhere now)
(Stuck in crisis)
(In-in-in-in)

When I look into the mirror
All I see is an anxious kid
Running through a labyrinth
It's a nightmare

When I look into the future
All I see is the same old shit
Running through my head
Running through my head
Running through my head 

Going nowhere
Going nowhere now
Stuck in crisis
In this fractured house
All of my life
I never can get off the ground
Going nowhere
Going nowhere now

Feel like I'm floating in the darkness
Feel like I'm clinging to a desperate hope
That there's something for me in the unknown
Or is it all gone?

In our corner of the universe
Is there something more than misery?
Coming after me
Coming after me
Coming after me

Going nowhere
Going nowhere now
Stuck in crisis
In this fractured house
All of my life
I never can get off the ground
Going nowhere
Going nowhere now

Will it be this way forever?
Is it all just in my mind?
Can I get my shit together tonight?
