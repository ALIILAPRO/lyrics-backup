		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We took all the drugs hopped in your car and
We took all of 'em
It's inevitable I would change for you
And you knew that I would
Put the blame on you
Put the blame on you that I'm this high
But it's not fair to bring me
Here with all your friends
I know they're watching us (Us)
What's in the bag you handed me?
A yellow pill to handle me
I wanted to stay at home
And I don't like rides
Pressure, but who can handle it better?
It's a man in the trunk
I took the keys from his sweater (Sweater)
We went on a joyride in a dead man's car
I stalked him from courtside to
Find out who he are and I found him
I worried about the pressure
In this ferris wheel
Pay attention to the stands
We had fun with your funnel
Cake flavored skin on mine (Mine)
But you took a joyride and switched
The gears in my heart
It's so many souls I've taken still
I'm going down for life
You made me a murderer
And that's why I murdered her
You said she was in my way
You know that you started this shit
I've got bodies all over the state
With nobody watching and nobody can stop it
(Nobody can stop it)
I think the cops are coming
