		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Then go back
And then decide.

I come to play right down
I'll tell your children not to lay right down

I say parking tickets?! you're crazy! I don't
He says well, they have some outstanding warrants left on you,
And they want to just solve them you know, whatever it'll be.
So they take me in on a chain to long beach.
And now they lock me up in the cell behind the courtroom in Long Beach,
While I'm awaiting to be heard on my traffic offences! parking tickets!
And I panicked, I'm thinking, oh my God, man,
While I'm here, you know, holding me, actually what's to stop them?
I mean what's really to stop them? oh, I assumed that maybe some day
My mother would realize that I should have gotten out!
But ah, she was nice, she would have known but still, what's to stop them?
And I'm panicking
And finally they called, sorry
Oh my god, I am
Scared.

Not a dream
We are using your brain's electrical system as a receiver,
We are unable to transmit to your conscious neural interference,
You are receiving this broadcast as a dream,
We are transmitting from the year 1-9-9
