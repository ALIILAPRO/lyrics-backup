		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She a busy body
Naughty when she talking
Got me on the ropes
She fold like origami
Sippin' sake
Got no clothes on
She a kamikaze writing suicidal love notes
She a love Nazi
I don't wanna know what it would cost me
Not a breath
Not a heartbeat
Tears written down in sharpie
I'm new but she want me
And she use that shit to taunt me
I'm used, she a harpy
It's never gonna stop me
I'm a fool for a girl who converses over coffee but
Love is dead, what's the point?
Over it, all you get
Punishment
So she says "punish me, I'm no good"
I'll be thinkin bout it days and weeks
She wants pain, she wants the agony
I could hit it all day

And I know I don't wanna let her go
Easy cum ain't easy go
(I'll be thinkin bout it days and weeks
She want pain, she want the agony)

I could hit it all day
I could hit it all day
All my vision gone grey
Fifty if she wants shades
I'll be thinkin bout it days and weeks
She want the pain she the want the agony
But love is dead, what's the point?
Over it, all you get
Punishment
So she says "punish me, I'm no good"
I'll be thinkin bout it days and weeks
She wants the pain, she wants the agony
I could hit it all day
