		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If this is apocalypse
Then first there was a genesis
I think I'll let myself exist
Under this bloody moon
Like a moth or butterfly (butterfly)
I'm the queen to my demise
But don't think that I'll go amiss
I'm just getting my groove
But first I gotta let go of the things I tried to be
First I gotta let go of these fakers next to me
First I gotta give up everything I can't control
Get that moderation in my system and move on to the next
On to the next
On to the next
On to the next
Maybe I don't know what's up (know what's up)
Maybe I am mostly wrong (mostly wrong)
But one thing that I know for sure
Is everywhere I go I grow
Knowing me it takes some time
Diamonds are a little shy
But wait and see, I'll hit some gold
cnd I'mma be a sight to hold
But first I gotta let go of the things I tried to be
First I gotta let go of these fakers next to me
First I gotta give up everything I can't control
Get that moderation in my system and move on to the next
First I gotta let go of the things I tried to be (On to the next)
First I gotta let go of these fakers next to me (On to the next)
First I gotta give up everything I can't control (On to the next)
Get that moderation in my system and move on to the next
