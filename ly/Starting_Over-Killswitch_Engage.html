		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you remember what we used to have
As if all our dreams were possible
All that is destined was you and I
But distance has torn us apart
Forgive me for everything I've done wrong
Lead me back to where my heart belongs

Can we start again
Go back in time to where we started
Can we start again

What we have can't be discarded
Do you remember the promises we made
But somehow we have lost our way
Take me back to where our heart belongs

Forever grateful everyday
I know that you doubt my words
I swear there will never be regrets

Can we start again
We thought love was everlasting
Can we start again

What we had just can't be wasted
Silence that were broken
And words that can't be taken back
But you mean so much more to me

Than anything
Anything I have ever known
And this is the hope for tomorrow
That today you will return

Can we start again
Go back in time to where we started
Can we start again
What we had can't be discarded
Can we start again
Do you remember
Can we start again
Can we start again
Go back in time to where we started
