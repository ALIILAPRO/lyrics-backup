Came from the bottom, had to stack my pence
Never goin' broke, that's common sense
With bro, bring a ratchet friend
Rollin' with smoke, just in case of nonsense
In this life they'd rather see me down, oh
That's why I wake up, thank God, oh
Look around, many rivals
Have to bun man's flesh for survival

Who's a plus two, three, four? That's my nines, babe
Never seen you before, how you my mate?
I can't even trust myself in this climate
Animal instincts, no primate
Cuttin' through Euston, dude, I'm used to
Packs flyin' like a rocket from Houston
I can't love you the way that I used to
You know what? I better go get a new you

Shake it, baby, don't break it
You know that I love my gyal petite
To make an entrance we come late to the party (yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
Shake, shake, shake it, baby, don't break it
You know that I love my gyal petite
To make an entrance we come late to the party

If it ain't money, then why you in my mentions?
No, I don't want no lames in my section
What I'm in ain't a rental
That's why she had her eyes on me when she entered
Having brekkie for dinner, how could I give you advice?
You can probably snake me once, but you can't do it twice
Yeah, I made it and I said I always will like Mike
Yeah, I made it and I said I always will like Mike

I put the fashion in fashionably late
Been puttin' work and nothin' ain't changed
Power in me from my ancestry
Got me seein' things I could never have seen
Don't just do this for element
Do it for the squad, family
Don't pretend you're a friend with me
Vibes tell me you're an enemy

Shake it, baby, don't break it
You know that I love my gyal petite
To make an entrance we come late to the party (yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
Shake, shake, shake it, baby, don't break it
You know that I love my gyal petite
To make an entrance we come late to the party

Ah, ah
I'm so highly blessed
Me go broke? I highly doubt it
Big ol' back, but you can't even shake it
They got gun, but they can't even shoot it, ah, ah
This one ah be outside, this one ah bling-bling
She dey feel me the way I dey sing-sing
Show me real love, don't show me fake ting
From this side, life no be joke ting

Shake it, baby, don't break it
You know that I love my gyal petite
To make an entrance we come late to the party (yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
Shake, shake, shake it, baby, don't break it
You know that I love my gyal petite
To make an entrance we come late to the party

Girl, I love you
Girl, I love you
Girl, I love you
