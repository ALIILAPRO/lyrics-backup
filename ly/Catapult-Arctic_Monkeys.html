		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Both sides, in softly came the growl from both sides
And if his whisper splits the mist, just think of what he's capable of with his kiss
Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
Turned your legs to little building blocks, and with his index finger flicks you on your socks

I go high pitched, he'll talk and make your voice sound high pitched
Dread to think if he got you on your own, and whispered in your ear in that baritone
It's the same stone, his heart was cut out of the same stone
That they used to carve his jaw, its impossible not to feel inferior

And he could catapult you back to your daddy or into any hissing misery
And he will tell you how the day after a triumph feels as hollow after the day of tragedy
He'll extinguish any chance of escape when he slaps you on your arse or kisses your nape 
And he's leaving without saying bye

And you will queue up to listen to him pissin'
And hang around to watch some poor girl blub
And then they chase him down the avenue incessantly pestering him to let 'em join the club
He knows how to put a cork in the fuss and just how to shut up, the charming ones of us 
And I've seen him, talking to your lady friend 

There's a dust track waiting for betrayal 
Where he'll teach you all the bits they've missed

Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
You cannot turn away
