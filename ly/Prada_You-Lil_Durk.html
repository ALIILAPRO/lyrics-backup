		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (DY Krazy)

Permanent mark on my heart, girl, you careless
And when you act like you don't care, that shit be scary
And I got caught with four, five hoes, I'm so embarrassed
I put the streets before myself, it gave me leverage
No disloyal in my heart, whatever that is
Came a long way from Amiris, rockin' Ballys
I know some niggas don't take care of they kids, they don't call 'em daddy
And that's a deadbeat, got a Trackhawk with the red seats
Let's get married, need a couple M's, then I'm ready
Give you Chanel sneaks, then a Chanel bag color cherry
And I ain't nothin' like them other niggas, so don't compare me
Actuality, they treated me unfairly

You put your friends in our business
You know they dyin' for attention
'Cause ain't no point in bein' no friend
L-O-V-E, do you love me?
R-E-S-P-E-C-T, don't say fuck me
Tryna L-I-V-E, do you trust me?
If I gave your ass my heart, girl, you lucky
And you better tell the world that you love me
That you love me, yeah
Do you love me?
Do you love me? Yeah

And I don't talk about no weak shit, I don't touch it
Tear your hole up, lay your throat back when I'm bustin'
You told your friends inside your group chat we was fuckin'
I heard your friends say that I treat you like you nothin'
I'm a gangster, but I moan when you suckin'
When we fuckin', I fuck long, I'on't rush it
Fuck my past, you can't hold onto nothin'
When you mad, you say, "Gon' on and fuck her"

I done bought you Gucci, Louis, and Prada too
I done bought you a Prada bag, said I'm proud of you
Play with my bitch and it's bada-bing, then bada-boom
I'm high as hell, I'm takin' Percocets by the moon
Get that Lambo' truck the color Nipsey Blue
And you be feelin' like the man in the empty room
I don't gotta force you for the pussy
