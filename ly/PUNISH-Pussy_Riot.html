		  Okay okay
Uhum why

I, I, I, I gonna tie you up
I might slit your throat (No)
Do what I wanna do
I punish you, I punish you
I'm gonna force you down got it coming now
Do what I wanna do
I punish you, I punish you

Think you're gonna get away with this (No)
Let me hit you with this feminist whip
Had enough, you've had to watch your back
'Cause I'm coming with a leather attack

He said, she said, she was right
Still he tries to put up a fight why?

I'm gonna tie you up
I might slit your throat (No)
Do what I wanna do
I punish you, I punish you
I'm gonna force you down got it coming now
Do what I wanna do
I punish you, I punish you

You say you're sorry when you silence me
Don't be a stupid boy and bow down to be
And I said I'm gonna sit on your face
Come here so I can put you in place

He said, she said, she was right
Still he tries to put up a fight why?

I, I, I, I'm gonna tie you up
I might slit your throat (No)
Do what I wanna do
I punish you, I punish you
I'm gonna force you down got it coming now
Do what I wanna do
I punish you, I punish you

Smack, smack, smack, gonna play with you
I'ma be your boss, you'll be licking my boots
All looking scared, and that's super cut–µ
I'm gonna dominate your world

I'm gonna tie you up
I might slit your throat (No)
Do what I wanna do
I punish you, I punish you
I'm gonna force you down got it coming now
Do what I wanna do
I punish you, I punish you

Ah ah
Oh
