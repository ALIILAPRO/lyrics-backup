		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some folks felt like this before
Illusions, never tried to understand the questions of a man
I'd hope could find
What he's desired, seen the lonely days go by
La-di-da-da-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
For most others, dangers lie across a lover's hand
Please understand the changes that a boy has had to climb
For what in time, leaves him always late to fly
Ba-la-la-lum-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la

He's the lovelorn colors of
Somewhat hapless in his touch
He's the undiscovered night, a parting line

And while he's
Only just been old enough to fall so hard again
Please know that there's no other boy like him you'd hope to find
So, young girl, be kind
On your morning wings, you'll fly
Ba-la-la-lum-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

He's the lovelorn colors of
Somewhat hapless in his touch
He's the undiscovered night, a parting line

Ba-la-la-lum-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Ooh, la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-di-la-la-la
