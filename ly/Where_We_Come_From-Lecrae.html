		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is where we come from
Yeah, we did it (yeah, we did it)
City on my back,  I'm committed
This is where we come from
Yeah, we made it (yeah, we made it)
Now the whole team celebratin' we like

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  (Oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  (Oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh)

Don't mistake the new me for the old me
(Old me) they can't stop me now
I'm with the home team
No beginner, I'm a winner
Took a couple losses, now I'm cookin'
Let me simmer
Yeah, yeah, tunnel vision, all I
See is win, win, win, win
This my city section, where
You been, been, been, been?
We move faster alone but go further together
We can weather any weather forever

A dream team, I done seen things
Confidence is on a hundred thousand
I got family from miles
Runnin' up the mileage (Mileage)
Made it through some trials
And some tribulations
Now me and the team out here celebratin'
Yeah

This is where we come from
Yeah, we did it (yeah, we did it)
City on my back, I'm committed
This is where we come from
Yeah, we made it (yeah, we made it)
Now the whole team celebratin' we like

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh)

One-two, one-two
Forget the things you probably
Thought you knew a new day is approachin'
Turn the gray skies into blue
I grew up on these same blocks
School of hard knocks
Had to get it on the hard top
Took the hard shots
But we made it, anticipated, highly decorated
The home team is winnin', celebrate it
The victory is all mine, all mine
And everything is alright, alright

And you know I done seen things
Confidence is on a hundred thousand
I got family from miles
Runnin' up the mileage (Mileage)
Made it through some trials
And some tribulations
Now me and the team out here celebratin'
Yeah

This is where we come from
Yeah, we did it (yeah, we did it)
City on my back, I'm committed
This is where we come from
Yeah, we made it (yeah, we made it)
Now the whole team celebratin' we like

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh)
