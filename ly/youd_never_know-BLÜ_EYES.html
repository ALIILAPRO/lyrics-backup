		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You'd never know
I was fighting for my life 8 months ago
I shut the door and covered the windows
Cuz the sunlight hurt my eyes
I couldn't even go outside for so so long

And you couldn't tell
But the inside of my head was a living hell
I tried my best explaining how it felt
But nobody ever understood
Doctor said that everything looks good
So I blamed myself

I don't think I've ever been so lonely
Didn't know if I would make it out
The dead of the winter of my life
In the middle of the summertime
And it still haunts me now

But you'd never know
That it took me months to step outside alone
Cuz my body still gets tense when I walk home
Past the spot where it all went dark
It's like a movie flashing back in parts
That cuts deep and slow

Everyone said
You look fine from the outside
But in my mind, I was upside down and screaming
What the hell is wrong with me

Tryna make it make sense
Makin my head spin
Now I pray to forget
Cuz I'm still here screamin
What the hell is wrong with me

But you'd never know
Oh, you'd never know, no no
