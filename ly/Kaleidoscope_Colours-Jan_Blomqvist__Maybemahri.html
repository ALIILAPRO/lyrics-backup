		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Insecurity shows her false composure
Take me on your skin until I am sober
Let me be the first to get it don’t you wait
Hear it in your tone there’s a fire growing
See it in your look there’s desire glowing
Maybe you’re the first, the first to make me feel alright

Here I am, Here I am, Here I am, Here I am
Kaleidoscope colours
Falling so fast, motion sickness
It's not what I took, that look in your eye, I know you did this
The walls start to spin around and around until they melt away
What was once shadows and darkness, disintegrate into the light of day

Insecurities when the bodies sober
Give me something good to let the thoughts be over
im in need of something strong, to feel our senses far away
Heat pours from our eyes there’s a fire blazing.
Spinning like a carousel, worlds interlacing
Maybe you’re the first, the first to make me feel at home

Here I am, Here I am, Here I am, Here I am
Kaleidoscope colours they dance on display
fragmented pixels move like sound
you understand then you don't
Trying to hold onto that feeling,
but you know that you won't
You say this is just a dream
whisper French in my ear,
soft and sweet and then i'll know what you mean.
Kaleidoscope colours, you understand then you don't
trying to hold onto that feeling, but you know that you won't.
