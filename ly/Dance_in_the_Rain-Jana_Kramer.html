		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never thought that I'd find myself lost in this place
Caught in a storm that my broken heart just can't escape
I close my eyes and soak it in and dance, I cry
I'll set these tears free in the wind

And dance in the rain
Let it wash away the pain
No, he ain't coming back
There's nothing to say and nothing to do
But try to be brave
And learn how to dance in the rain

This heart might be empty but
It's still beating tonight
Well I'm not okay but I know
That I will be in time
So I won't give up
No I won't give in
Kiss his memory goodbye
Set him free in the wind

And dance in the rain
Let it wash away the pain
No, he ain't coming back
There's nothing to say and nothing to do
But try to be brave
And learn how to dance in the rain

So I'll spin around with my hands in the air
Yeah, the sky's falling down but I just don't care
I'm gonna dance, I'm gonna dance

Dance in the rain
Let it wash him away
Dance in the rain
Let it wash him away
No, he ain't coming back
There's nothing to say and nothing to do
But try to be brave
And learn how to dance, just dance in the rain
Dance in the rain
