		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We´re on and on

And off again

It's beautiful

But also pain

You lift me up

Before you let me fall

Am I enough?

I never know

Cuz you never tell me the

Things that you´re keeping inside

and you never say

what you thinking or what you decide

I'm not gonna force

to show me the things that you Hide

So I'm just enjoying this

I'm just enjoying this ride

I'm pretty sure

That I can't get enough

Of what you are

Or where we going

it's such a mess

The things you do for love

you second guess

And you´re feeling lost

When you never tell me the

Things that you´re keeping inside

and you never say

what you thinking or what you decide

I'm not gonna force you

to show me the things that you Hide

So I'm just enjoying this

I'm just enjoying this ride
