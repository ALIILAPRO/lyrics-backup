		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lord, don't pay me no mind
Lord, if you choose a time
Lord, don't pay me no mind
I'll take another one and I'll be yours
Lord, if you choose a time
I'll be the child
Lord, don't pay me no mind
Lord, if you choose a time
I'll be the child

It's too late, too late
I won't see you later
If you fade, I'll fade
Fading together
Love is blind
Her love is kind
Her love is mine
Her love is mine
Love wants to give
Hate wants the thrills
Joy hates the pain
But pain, we all need
The pain we need to feel
If wishes were horses
Then beggars will ride
This is my cross to bear
This is my cross to bear
This is my cross to bear
This is my cross to bear

Lord, don't pay me no mind
I'll take another one and I'll be yours
Lord, if you choose a time
I'll be the child
Lord, don't pay me no mind
I'll take another one and I'll be yours
Lord, if you choose a time
I'll be the child

While the government wants to control
Our country will set you free
