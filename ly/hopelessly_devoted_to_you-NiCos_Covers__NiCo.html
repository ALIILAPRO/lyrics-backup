		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Guess mine is not the first heart broken
My eyes are not the first to cry
I'm not the first to know
There's just no getting over you
I know I'm just a fool who's willing
To sit around and wait for you
But baby, can't you see there's nothing else for me to do?
I'm hopelessly devoted to you
But now there's nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
My head is sayin', "Fool, forget him"
My heart is sayin', "Don't let go
Hold on to the end", that's what I intend to do
I'm hopelessly devoted to you
But now there's no way to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm outta my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
