		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I drove up to the city at night and found the place
where you grew up and then where you stayed and we
walked around and stayed up late under city lights,
I spent the night, next to you in the house where you grew up, next to you I miraculousy woke up. In your parents' house I lied in bed with you.
I went back to feel alone there.
I went back to wipe it clean.
I took the lights and radio towers out of my dreams.
And we went all the way up to the small town where
I'm from with foggy air and the wind and the mountain
top and we clung to rocks and looked off and you
held my hand. You almost got to start feeling me.
I finally felt like I was breathing free. Under swaying
trees we fell asleep and we had the same dream, the stars were bright, we dream the same every night.
On my island home I spent some time with you.
I went back and felt alone there.
I went back there by myself.
I gave up on everything that we'd felt.
We found a precious place in the sand right out in th ewind and we lied under a blanket and heard the furious
sound, the roar of waves, the pounding surf, 2 bodies
on the earth, it was intense just getting to be there
next to you. And then I went and had sex with you.
And you trying to get me then. And I was happy to let you in.
I went back and wished I hadn't.
I went back and felt regret.
I went to the beach and I stared west.

Every night when the sun went down in the town
where we lived the empty streets were lit up by
reflected light from a distant sun bouncing off a
glowing ball of rock and we just lied on the roof and
watched the moon, the moon, the blue light of the
moon. We didn't talk and silently we both felt powerful
and, like the moon, my chest was full because we both
know we're just floating in space over molten rock and
we felt safe and we discovered that our skin is soft.
There's nothing left except certain death and that was
comforting at night out under the moon.
I went out last night to forget that.
I went out and stared it down,
but the Moon stared back at me
and in it's light I saw my 2 feet on the ground.
