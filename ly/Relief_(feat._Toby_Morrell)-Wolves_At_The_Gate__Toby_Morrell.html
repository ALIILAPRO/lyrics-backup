		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For we do not have a God who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses
But One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin
Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of Grace 
So we may receive mercy and find help

All who are burdened and seeking respite
All of the hopeless, wretched, and desperate
All who are worn out, and feeling oppressed
Come in and find your rest

We've seen your scars
As it has captured like, like prison bars
Bitter and sharp it runs down, runs down your skin
It doesn't ease it hides, hides wounds within
We aren't deaf we've heard, we've heard your plight
As dark as night
In pain you've cried,
That "Hope has died." 

I know that you're guarded
I've been there before
Sin is crouched at your door
Come find your rest
I've traded all of my sin I once counted worth for healed wounds and rebirth

All who are burdened and seeking respite
All of the hopeless, wretched, and desperate
All who are worn out, and feeling oppressed
Come in and find your rest
Come in and trade your tears
All worry and ease your fears
Your burden is not unknown
Don't run friend you're not alone

For we do not have a God who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses
But One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin
Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of Grace 
So we may receive mercy and find help

For all confined come be set free
For all the blind that long to see
Come and receive the perfect relief
Come and believe He bore your grief
Rise up as the war has ceased
No bondage you have been released

All who are burdened and seeking respite
All of the hopeless, wretched, and desperate
All who are worn out, and feeling oppressed
Come in and find your rest
Come in and trade your tears
All worry and ease your fears
Your burden is not unknown
Don't run friend you're not alone
Come all you weak and contrite
He'll strengthen and clothe you in white
