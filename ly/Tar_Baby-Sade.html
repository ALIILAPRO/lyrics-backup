		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Grandma came to see
Something she could not believe
How could her girl be
So naive

Tar baby, tar baby told
The secret she conceived

Oh, that big old smile of yours
Could turn the wind into a song
How could I have doubted?
Honey it's with me that you belong

Tar baby, tar baby
I love you so
(I love you)

Like a brand new blade
You cut into my life
Cut through two decades (decades)
Like a hot coal on ice (baby, baby, baby, baby, babe)

Tar baby, my tar baby
It maybe, was meant to be
When I look at you
I can't believe my eyes
And with your magic
I think you just might charm the birds 
Out of the skies

Tar baby, tar baby, tar baby
Came good out of grief

A golden thread inside of the web
That I got caught in
Oh, it's a lover's revenge, but out of the pain
Come the best things

You cut into my life
You cut into my life 
(Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, don't you know that?)
You cut into my life (I love you)
You cut into my life

La la la la la ooh
You can turn the wind into a song
La la la la la baby baby baby
It's with me you belong
