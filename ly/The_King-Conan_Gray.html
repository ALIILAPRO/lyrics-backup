		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Crush always making me feel like I got nothing to offer
But I'm the only one that can make you feel right
I'm the only one that you think of at night
Baby, don't lie
You're always talking to me like you're totally bothered
So why you always ring at the end of my line?
Don't you got a girl that can make you feel nice?
It's a dead sign

You see me as your lifeline
Other boys and girls never really made you feel right
And you can't explain why I'm always running your mind
Don't you see the answer's right in front of your eyes?

You like me, oh, obviously
So why you trying to leave when you know that I'm the king?
(You'll see)
'Cause I'm supreme
(Choose me)
Other lovers give you no luck
'Cause I'm the only one that has made you fall in love
(You'll see)
So just shut up
(Choose me)

Babes always flirting away, getting every number
And you can have your fun 'cause I know that it's fake
I know when you're done you'll come running my way
So I let you
Date everyone and complain that you can't find a lover
'Cause I'm the only one when the chemistry fades
I'm the only one at the end of the day
Kinda cliche

You see me as your lifeline
Other boys and girls never really made you feel right
And you can't explain why I'm always running your mind
Don't you see the answer's right in front of your eyes?

You like me, oh, obviously
So why you trying to leave when you know that I'm the king?
(You'll see)
'Cause I'm supreme
(Choose me)
Other lovers give you no luck
'Cause I'm the only one that has made you fall in love
(You'll see)
So just shut up
(Choose me)

I'm the one you're coming to when you're feeling alone
And I'm the only one who's gonna pick up the phone
Looking for the one but it's me all along
(Choose me)
Baby, I'm the one, yeah, that's something you've known
No, I'm not a quitter, yeah, I get what I want
Playing with your heart 'cause you give me the throne
Choose me

You like me, oh, obviously
So why you trying to leave when you know that I'm the king?
(You'll see)
'Cause I'm supreme
(Choose me)
Other lovers give you no luck
'Cause I'm the only one that has made you fall in love
(You'll see)
So just shut up
(Choose me)
