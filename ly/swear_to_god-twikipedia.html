		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Going through my bands, I swear, I swear
I swear to God
I can't tell the even from the odd
It's getting hard looking at the stars
I take the ceiling off my car
One that's making fun of me
They drive a push to start
C-C-C-C-C-Cuff your chick (It's the gang)
(yeah, Pl-Pl-Plugg, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I been tryna get out of the picture
I heard you mad
Because my pockets getting bigger (yeah)
And you can't stick to the scripture (Ha)
But I guess that we can't all be winners
I'll-I'll bring a bag home before dinner
(yeah) if they're watching
Then I swear I'm not a sinner
Bitch, I'm not a babysitter
I can't listen to these kids
You complain about my voice
So we gon' put him in the mix
And they up in my DMs
'cause they ain't heard no shit like this
Before, I guess they want some more
I'm tryna have a chat
To the people that be copying
You can't run away with that
I, I can't double back
Say that I might get you
But it's not like that
What you do in seven days (Ho-Ho-Holy shit)
I'ma do in twenty-four
(Pl-Plugg) hours in a fucking day
I can't waste time many more
If you hear a fucking noise
Know we knocking down your door
Yeah, I'm tryna see some brains
(Spreaded all around the floor)
And I heard you like to talk
About some shit that didn't happen
Y-Y-You say you love action
But you're really passive
Yeah, not good at math
But know a lot about subtraction
I'm the one that's adding though-ough, today

Going through my bands, I swear, I swear
I swear to God
I can't tell the even from the odd
It's getting hard looking at the stars
I take the ceiling off my car
One that's making fun of me
They drive a push to start
Go-Go-Going through my bands, I
Swear, I swear, i swear to God
I can't tell the even from the odd
It's getting hard looking at the stars
I take the ceiling off my car
One that's making fun of me
They drive a push to start

(yeah) had to turn it up (Okay, go)
Walk-in with my family in the club
No, we don't give a fuck (Yuh)
We're too busy getting money up
And they tryna fuck it up
I know lots of people that
Be tryna fuck it up i don't want your love
Hop up on the stage, and they all go nuts

Tryna see it, I'm just tryna see it
I'm just tryna see you
Make sure that we're even
Got a lot up on my mind, want you to see it
Double text me every time
Swear to God y'all geekin'
Okay, like, go, go, go, go
I don't wanna take no photos
I'm wearing chrome to the face though
I'm taking four, four, four, fours
Talking that shit, know he gon' miss
I hit up Saks, bitch, I'm with Lei
Going out sad, go out sad for a bitch
Can't go out sad, walk with a stick
(Okay, yeah)

I could never lack right now
Do it all to leave this town
I keep walking upside down
Eyes on me when you're around
Because I can't tell the difference
Between fake and real
If you tryna fuck me up, you lose your appeal
Bro, don't tell me how to feel
Tell apart the fake from you
