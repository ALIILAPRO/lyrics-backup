		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you smile
Like you smile when you see him?
I wish I was him

Can you talk to me
Like you talk when you talk to him?
I wish I was him

Oh, how I try and I won't find my way
There's a scar in your heart, and I'll bring more pain
Love is just a game, and you play it so well
I want love and you are my pain

Can you make love
Like you make love when you're loving him?
I wish I was him

Will you break my heart
Like you're never breaking him?
I will wear his skin

Oh, how I try and I won't find my way
There's a scar in your heart, and I'll bring more pain
Love is just a game, and you play it so well
I want love and you are my pain

I won't take no for an answer
Even though I know that you love him
I'm never gonna let you out of sight

I'm gonna be your one and your only
It's only that you don't know it
And if it's not me then it's no one else

Oh, how I try and I won't find my way
There's a scar in your heart, and I'll bring more pain
Love is just a game, and you play it so well
I want love and you are my pain
