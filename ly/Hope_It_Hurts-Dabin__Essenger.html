		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hope it hurts when you think of me
Late at night tossing in your sheets
I'm a mess, reading texts from the night that we met
Still a wreck but I won't let it show

I hope it aches when you hear my name
Bite your lip till the memory fades
I forget you're in bed, you're with somebody else
Though you said we would last till the end

So call me heartless, call me cold
I hope your heart breaks sevenfold
Take my place down in the dirt
I hope it hurts, I hope it hurts

Pretend you've crushed me, I don't mind
So do your worst girl, I'll be fine
I hope you get what you deserve
I hope it hurts, I hope it hurts

I hope it hurts
I hope it hurts
I hope it hurts
I hope it hurts
I hope it hurts

I hope it hurts
I hope it hurts
I hope it hurts
I hope it hurts
I hope it hurts

I hope it hurts when you pass my street
See the park where we used to meet
And regret what you said on the night that you left
Every word echoes back in my head

I hope it aches when you see the truth
Feel the hell that you put me through
Left a weight to this day that I still can't escape
Let me down for the last time again

So call me heartless, call me cold
I hope your heart breaks sevenfold
Take my place down in the dirt
I hope it hurts, I hope it hurts

Pretend you've crushed me, I don't mind
So do your worst girl, I'll be fine
I hope you get what you deserve
I hope it hurts, I hope it hurts

I hope it hurts
I hope it hurts
I hope it hurts
I hope it hurts
I hope it hurts

I hope it hurts
I hope it hurts
I hope it hurts
I hope it hurts
I hope it hurts
I hope it hurts
I hope it hurts
I hope it hurts
