		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, they can't keep up with my ocean, this another wave
Got her blocked, she got to watch me from her other page
I can't stop for nothin', I'll figure out another way
The impossible, I did that shit the other day
Doin' whatever it takes to get then win, I don't like losin'
I'm the one that say what I'm gon' do, and then, I do it
I don't feel bad at all, you had your chance, you went and blew it
If I ever bring it up at Saks, I'm ready to prove it

Cuban links gettin' tangled up, pretty girls have fun with us
She act out, I write her up, put her on suspension
She told all her friends about it, now I'm poppin' in they group chat
I hope all us win, I never been no hater, I don't do that (yeah)
Tennis chain gettin' tangled up, they know that they can't hang with us
Multiplyin', addin' up, put it in they face
Ain't no stoppin', I been goin' hard, gotta get it while it's great
Ain't no problem we can't overcome, I'll just charge it to the game

I been out here poppin' it, for real
Yeah, she be lowkey stalkin' me, for real, for real
Uh, we live like the mafia, for real, for real
You just a imposter, you ain't real, for real
I'm not nothin' like them, that's for real, for real
I shot up like lightnin', that's for real, for real
I earned all my stripes out here, for real, for real
Yeah, dedicate my life to this shit, for real, for real

She know I'm the one just ask her, ain't no cappin'
Send me pics before they hit the 'Gram, I give her captions
Shout out to you if you out here tryna run yo' bag up
I'm switchin' my swag up, I'm turnin' up the volume
I been in the cut, I think it's time to drop a album
I'm gon' do whatever I want no matter the outcome
Never let 'em X me out, I'm militant like Malcolm
They was actin' like I need 'em, did this shit without them
I can really take it there, but, that shit ain't even 'bout nothin'
Savin' more then I'm spendin', I'll be ready if a drought come
All of us got fire inside the spot, we keep the house warm
Ever been there for me, ain't no question, I'll look out for you

Cuban links gettin' tangled up, pretty girls have fun with us
She act out, I write her up, put her on suspension
She told all her friends about it, now I'm poppin' in they group chat
I hope all us win, I never been no hater, I don't do that (yeah)
Tennis chain gettin' tangled up, they know that they can't hang with us
Multiplyin', addin' up, put it in they face
Ain't no stoppin', I been goin' hard, gotta get it while it's great
Ain't no problem we can't overcome, I'll just charge it to the game

I been out here poppin' it, for real
Yeah, she be lowkey stalkin' me, for real, for real
Uh, we live like the mafia, for real, for real
You just a imposter, you ain't real, for real
I'm not nothin' like them, that's for real, for real
I shot up like lightnin', that's for real, for real
I earned all my stripes out here, for real, for real
Yeah, dedicate my life to this shit, for real, for real
