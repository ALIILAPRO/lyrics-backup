		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They don’t know who was on that dinger 
I don’t know who pulled that trigger 
I dunno all I know the Feds should stop harassing a innocent Nigga 
Knock down ginger surprise like kinder
My right hand strong & my middle finger
Opp thots chatting they want this Nigga 
That’s why I jeeted Bamz sister 
 
Bro spin this ride Idc rapping 
I was on the run when I kept on tapping 
I was with loose when I splashed him now he’s onda net just chatting 
Big woman ting I’ll tear his fabric 
With hero that means rich badness 
Beef with the yardies crazy madness
Backing a matic I ain’t backing a ratchet
 
I’m Inda O you ain’t rolling 
Me & mac arguing about who’s controlling 
Lock & loaded jumped out smoked him 
Hopefully we get back & able to smoke him 
I can show you some bread like hovis
Probably took a next mans pack & sold it
Cause I’m a robber everyone knows this 
Far from a neek & snitch but bo is
 
Me & my sg’s cleaning 
Top floor lv champagne please miss 
They went for a drop on bro but they missed
Then we done road snap shot free prints 
Talk on my name I dare you editas 
Then I’m gonna pull up where he lives 
Cats need food so I gave out felix 
Kyra and rianna used to beat it 
 
Free all the sliders some turnt lifers 
Cause they put yutes in grinders
Them brothers are tired one got it twice the other got punctured like tires
Warm up my hands in front of fires 
They said I’m the one who conspires
On Halloween Mike myers 3 smarko the police are liars
 
 
Got bro that’s right or wrong
TG & Jugg some frightening dons
Cameraman keeps pissing me keeps shooting the opps I might … this don
Double 07 free James Bond 
He’s good with his hands he’s good with his wand
Free Scratcha they know what he’s on
Can’t get dcat cause he plays with mops 
 
 
Lean with it lean with it 
Just don’t sleep with it 
If you got a thing keep greasing it
In & out weaving it
OD beating it 
Back to K someone else is repeating it
I slimed out him I slimed out I slimed out him
& I slimed out him 
3 Bro Rangz hes out ina bit really on things
make alarm bells ring
 
This ain’t no tic for tat
Attack the block brap brap brap
Lost My friends it turned me mad
My mum knows why I’m dressed in black 
3Ty Man With A Plan
That’s my big bro like bud & ak 
3Crose got bro inda can he was in his teens when he spill some jam
 
I ain’t never petrol bath 
It was me & g splash in a sauna far 
Got my friends on remand sitting down inda marsh 
Some reading pslams others making dua 
Tg use to whip it like mario kart
They all use to skate like Bart 
Get back or step back stretched that rest up warz he really heart
