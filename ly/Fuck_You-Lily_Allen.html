		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look inside
Look inside your tiny mind
Now look a bit harder
'Cause we're so uninspired
So sick and tired of all the hatred you harbor

So you say
It's not okay to be gay
Well, I think you're just evil
You're just some racist who can't tie my laces
Your point of view is medieval

F--k you (f--k you)
F--k you very, very much
'Cause we hate what you do
And we hate your whole crew
So, please don't stay in touch (ta-rah, rah, rah, rah, rah)

F--k you (f--k you)
F--k you very, very much
'Cause your words don't translate
And it's getting quite late
So, please don't stay in touch

Do you get
Do you get a little kick out of being small-minded?
You want to be like your father
It's approval you're after
Well, that's not how you find it

Do you
Do you really enjoy living a life that's so hateful?
'Cause there's a hole where your soul should be
You're losing control a bit
And it's really distasteful

F--k you (f--k you)
F--k you very, very much
'Cause we hate what you do
And we hate your whole crew
So, please don't stay in touch (ta-rah, rah, rah, rah, rah)

F--k you (f--k you)
F--k you very, very much
'Cause your words don't translate
And it's getting quite late
So, please don't stay in touch

F--k you, f--k you, f--k you
F--k you, f--k you, f--k you
F--k you

You say
You think we need to go to war
Well, you're already in one
'Cause it's people like you that need to get slew
No one wants your opinion

F--k you (f--k you)
F--k you very, very much
'Cause we hate what you do
And we hate your whole crew
So, please don't stay in touch

F--k you (f--k you)
F--k you very, very much
'Cause your words don't translate
And it's getting quite late
So, please don't stay in touch

F--k you (f--k you)
F--k you (f--k you)
F--k you (f--k you)
Ta-rah, rah, rah, rah, rah
F--k you (f--k you)
F--k you (f--k you)
F--k you (f--k you)
