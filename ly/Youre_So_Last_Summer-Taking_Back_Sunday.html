		  She said,
"Don't, don't let it go to your head 
Boys like you are a dime a dozen
Boys like you are a dime a dozen" 
She said
"You're a touch overrated, 
You're a lush and I hate it 
But these grass stains on my knees 
They won't mean a thing" 

And all I (all I) 
Need to know (need to know) 
Is that I'm somethin you'll be missin'
(Is that I'm somethin that you're missin') 
(Maybe I should hate for this) 
Maybe I should hate you for this 
Never really did ever quite get that far 
(Maybe I should hate for this) 
Maybe I should hate you for this 
Never really did ever quite get that

I'd never lie to you 
Unless I had to 
I'll do what I got to 
Unless I had to 
I'll do what I go to, the truth 
Is you could slit my throat 
And with my one last gasping breath 
I'd apologize for bleeding on your shirt 

And all I (all I) 
Need to know (need to know) 
Is that I'm somethin you'll be missin'
(Is that I'm somethin that you're missin') 
Maybe I should hate you for this 
(Maybe I should hate you for this) 
Never really did ever quite get that far 
(Maybe I should hate for this) 
Maybe I should hate you for this 
Never really did ever quite get that

Cause I'm a wishful thinker with the worst intentions, 
This'll be last chance you get to drop my name 
Cause I'm a wishful thinker with the worst intentions
This'll be last chance you get to drop my name 

If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar
If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar
If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar
If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar

If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar
If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar
If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar
If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar
