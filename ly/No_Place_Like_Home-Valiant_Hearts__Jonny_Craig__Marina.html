		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well every step I take feels hollow
And I end up looking back at the road that I have followed
And the courage that I've lacked
Won't you take me somewhere I will never go
A place just for us, buried under ice and snow

We walked all night, we never tire
Our feet burn bright as the flames keep rising higher
And higher and higher

There's no place for us to sleep at night
Doors are locked and there's no light
Pull the wool over my eyes, take me home and tell me lies
Under winter solstice skies
Where our worlds will both collide
Tell the wolves I'm on their side and roam the earth with me for life
For life, for life

Now my body succumbs and it weighs me down like lead
I grow pale and numb as the blood runs to my head
Won't you take me somewhere I have never seen
A place just for us, buried under everything

There's no place for us to sleep at night
Doors are locked and there's no light
Pull the wool over my eyes, take me home and tell me lies
Under winter solstice skies
Where our worlds will both collide
Tell the wolves I'm on their side and roam the earth with me for life

Sometimes I start to wander, sleepwalking underwater
Sometimes I start to wonder, if it all makes sense to others
All night spent thinking of you
I tried to take your point of view
You know that I just can't abide
When your true colours come to light
True colours come to light
True colours come to light

Right through my soul, I know
I'll never make it home, oh no
There's no place for us to sleep at night
Lights go on but there's no one inside

There's no one inside

There's no place for us to sleep tonight
Doors are locked and there's no light
Pull the wool over my eyes, take me home and tell me lies
Under winter solstice skies
Where our worlds will both collide
Tell the wolves I'm on their side and roam the earth with me for life

Sometimes I start to wander, sleepwalking underwater
Sometimes I start to wonder, if it all makes sense to others
Sometimes I start to wander, sleepwalking underwater
Sometimes I start to wonder, if it all makes sense to others
