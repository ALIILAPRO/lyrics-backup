		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're a million lonely people
All together on this needle in the sky
Afraid of heights
And your dreams were made illegal
By the laws of lesser evil
We call I, but not tonight

I dare you to love
I dare you to cry
I dare you to run
I dare you to try

I dare you to fall
And lay on the ground
I dare you to feel
I dare you to be

You're an outline of a vision
That you had when we were children
Yesterday
You watch it fade
Let your heart be your religion
Let it break you out of this prison
You became
It's not too late

I dare you to love
I dare you to cry
I dare you to run
I dare you to try

I dare you to fall
And lay on the ground
I dare you to feel
I dare you to be

I dare you
I dare you
