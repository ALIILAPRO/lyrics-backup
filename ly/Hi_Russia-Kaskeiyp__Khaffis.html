		  Hi, that is Russia, like a summer
I'm hot like that
Hi, that is Russia, like a summer
I'm hot like that

Hi, that is Russia, like a summer
I'm hot like that
Hi, that is Russia, like a summer
I'm hot like that

Hi, that is Russia, like a summer
I'm hot like that
Hi, that is Russia, like a summer
I'm hot like that

Hi, that is Russia, like a summer
I'm hot like that
Hi, that is Russia, like a summer
I'm hot like that

Easier alone, you're too much
Let me give you time and my love
Never let me down, 'cause all around did

Gave it to you all and we know
Feeling something fine and great love
Haven't let you down, 'cause all around did

Hi, that is Russia, like a summer
I'm hot like that
Hi, that is Russia, like a summer
I'm hot like that

Hi, that is Russia, like a summer
I'm hot like that
Hi, that is Russia, like a summer
I'm hot like that
