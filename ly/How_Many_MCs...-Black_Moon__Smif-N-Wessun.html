		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm takin' it back, come follow me
On a journey to see a for real MC
The mind tricks the body
Body thinks the mind is crazy
But never sleazy
When I get the flow, I'm Swayze
I break, you take
Whatever type of shit the nigga Buckshot makes
The incredible, lyrical, and original
You can kill it, bull, if you wanna take a pull
Whatever I see I attack ('tack)
Fuck off my back, black, nigga, fuck that
The devil lurks and my heart irks for the Hell
Look into the eyes of a nigga who fell
I hit my head on the concrete to beat the feet
Another dead nigga in the street
Bullseye, direct hit, don't miss
But how Many MC's must get dissed?

"How many MC's must get dissed?"
"How many MC's must get dissed?"
"How many MC's must get dissed?"
"How many MC's must get dissed?"
"How many MC's must get dissed?"
"How many MC's must get dissed?"
"How many MC's must get dissed?"

I can break it down like whatever you want
You want it like this
I hit, ya miss, but you get dissed when I'm pissed
Mister Buckshot rock it not quick
Bitch, get off my dick
I rope 'em up and boot 'em up, then I shoot 'em up
Whatever
I'm clever because I wear my leather in the winter
I enter da stage, nigga cock ya gauge
I bust 'em off somethin' awful
And then I leave the stage
I'm just a crazy maniac murder, a murder type thinkin'
Ya shittin', ya ass thinkin', I see ya blinkin'
I wet 'em then forget 'em, never should've met 'em
But he was talkin' shit to my man
So I had to get 'em
Yep, you can get the fist
Whatever
But how Many MC's must get dissed?

"How many MC's must get dissed?"
"How many MC's must get dissed?"
"How many MC's must get dissed?"
"How many MC's must get dissed?"
"How many MC's must get dissed?"
"How many MC's must get dissed?"
"How many MC's must get dissed?"

I got a nigga on scope through the eye of a needle
But I had the nigga the nigga puckin' on my desert eagle
Pain as a niggas brain, I'm goin' insane
Pound after pound, I come stomp on ya brain
Pick up the pump, better be jetty wit' the loot
Don't try to walk wit' a switch, bitch, like you cute
You just gettin' me sick, my dick and ride on the regular
Pen predator, et cetera, yeah, right
So fuck what you heard it's about gettin' blipped
In 1993 motherfuckers get dissed

"How many MC's must get dissed?"
"How many MC's must get dissed?"
"How many MC's must get dissed?"
"How many MC's must get dissed?"
"How many MC's must get dissed?"
"How many MC's must get dissed?"
"How many MC's must get dissed?"
"How many MC's must get dissed?"
