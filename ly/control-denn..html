		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm waking up
Beside a monster
I don't recognize
I'm sorry I lied
Unconditional
Is harder than it looks
When you're looking at
True evil in a man
And it just makes sense
It makes too much sense
And babe I'm confused
How things got so loose
And out of control
Out of control
Out of control
Out of control
You used to hold me
Tell me I'm pretty
Run in a flower field
That was you and me
Now we just scream
My friends always ask me
Why don't you leave
Why don't you leave
Why can't you let go
Of your control
Why can't you let go
Of your control
Why can't you let go
I say it's warm
Whenever she cheats on me
I feel so cold
But at least I know
Who's the monster
I'm not the monster
Thank god
Thank god
Thank god
