		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another weekend, a new story
I found a diamond in the darkest mine
We started speaking, small talking
Tip toe over the borderline

She left her lipstick on my cheek
I turn around, she vanished in a blink
She home to me, and I can barely sleep
I'm lookin' for, wait that's her, stop that girl

Hey! There's been a robbery
She stole my heart and then took off on me
I said hey, there's been a robbery
She stole my heart, she had enough of me
Everywhere I go, everywhere I go
I put up wanted signs
I said hey, there's been a robbery
I guess I'll never, I'll never know
Who you are
Who you are
Who you are
Who you are

I've got a fever, a cold sweating
It's hard to make it through the day to day
Empty handed, right where you left me
A ciggie's filling up the ash tray

Still got her lipstick on my cheek
I turn around, she vanished in a blink
She home to me, and I can barely sleep
I'm lookin' for, wait that's her, stop that girl

Hey! There's been a robbery
She stole my heart and then took off on me
I said hey, there's been a robbery
She stole my heart, she had enough of me
Everywhere I go, everywhere I go
I put up wanted signs
I said hey, there's been a robbery
I guess I'll never, yeah I'll never know
Who you are
Who you are
Who you are
Who you are

She got her lipstick on my cheek
She vanished in a blink
And I can barely sleep
Mm, yeah
Still got her lipstick on my cheek
I turn around, she vanished in a blink
She home to me, and I can barely sleep
Yeah, wait that's her, stop that girl

Hey! There's been a robbery
She stole my heart and then took off on me
I said hey, there's been a robbery
She stole my heart, she had enough of me
Everywhere I go, everywhere I go
I put up wanted signs
Hey, there's been a robbery
I guess I'll never, yeah I'll never know
Who you are
Who you are
Yeah, I'll never know who you are
Who you are
Yeah, I'll never know who you are
Who you are
Yeah, I'll never know who you are
Who you are
I'll never know
