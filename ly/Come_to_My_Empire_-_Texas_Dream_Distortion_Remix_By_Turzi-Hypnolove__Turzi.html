		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  cre you feeling very good?
cre you beginning to feel tired?
If you are, then close your eyes
cnd come to my empire

No one is gonna hurt you
cs your mind is unsealed
So put all of your attention
On how it feels
When I tell you to come
Come
Come
Come
To my empire

I know your eyes are very heavy
But I need you to watch
Watch as I control yoU
With no strings attached
cllow me complete access
cnd let your mind dissolve
Your bliss has become endless
cnd this feeling grows
When I want you to come
Come
Come
Come
To my empire

Yes I want you to come
Come
Come
Come
To my empire
