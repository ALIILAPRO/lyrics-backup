		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I tried to fit in
But they don't love me as I am so I don't get it, mm
And you tried to tell 'em
How much we love each other and they still don't get it, mm

Give me the keys and le-let's just drive
We're rocking body to body, we can go far
And we'll be together no matter what
We're rocking body to body (body to body)

Run away with me, baby, baby, baby
Just let them talk, we're finally free
Now follow, follow me, baby, baby, baby
Just let them talk and run away with me

Run away with me, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Run away with me, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby

What's wrong about me
I found a friend, a lover, all that I was dreaming, mm
They got to fit in
They should accept the truth and story that we're living in, mm

Give me the keys and le-let's just drive
We're rocking body to body, we can go far
And we'll be together no matter what
We're rocking body to body (body to body)

Run away with me, baby, baby, baby
Just let them talk, we're finally free
Now follow, follow me, baby, baby, baby
Just let them talk and run away with me

Run away with me, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Run away with me, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby

So run away with me
'Cause we're finally free
Now let them talk
Just let them talk, talk, talk

Run away with me, baby, baby, baby
Just let them talk, we're finally free
Now follow, follow me, baby, baby, baby
Just let them talk and run away with me

Run away with me, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Run away with me, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
