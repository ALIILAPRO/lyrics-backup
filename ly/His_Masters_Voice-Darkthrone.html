		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ONLY IN SLEEP SOME RELIEF COULD BE FOUND
NINTH CIRCLE BOUND
GORGEOUS RADIOACTIVE STRUCTURES
HEAVING WITH THEIR DORMANT PULSE

TIED TO THE MAST
WITH HIS MASTERS VOICE
THIS WILL NEVER LAST
HEARING HIS MASTERS VOICE

CLING TO COLLAPSING TOWERS
DEATH FLASHES BEFORE YOUR EYES
REEL AT WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN
LOST LIVES DRAIN (THE) WITHIN

TIED TO THE MAST
WITH HIS MASTERS VOICE
TODAY WILL BE THE LAST
HEARING OF HIS MASTERS VOICE

(HE) HOWLS INSIDE THE GOLDEN CALF I WELDED
VENGEANT GHOSTS ACCOMPANY YOUR CHOICE
WISHING YOU COULD HAVE A LIFE ANEW
THE SILENT CROWDS POINT STEADILY AT YOU
