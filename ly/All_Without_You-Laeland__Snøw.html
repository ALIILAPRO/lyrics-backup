		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me that it's okay
You know it's not okay
We just talking shit
It's all part of the foreplay
I know you don't love me no more
I can tell by the way that you walk out that door
I know that you
Miss my face I
Miss your head
You know you miss my brain I
Miss your sense
I hope you say my fucking name by accident
Hope you moan my Fucking name when you're in bed with him
Like what I do to you?
All i ever did was love you yeah
You had my hypnotized cause
You a demon in disguise
Had me fucked up for these past couple months
God I'm feeling so numb
God I'm feeling so numb
(wait wrong song)
Point is you a bitch
Now I'm getting rich
Got checks coming in
Got baddies throwing it
And I'm doing it all without you
And I'm doing it all without you
Point is you a bitch
Now I'm getting rich
Got checks coming in
Got baddies throwing it
And I'm doing it all without you
And I'm doing it all without you
Tell me that it's okay
You know it's not okay
You turn off my texts but
You turn on when all my songs play
I haven't known you for too long
But you know that what you did to me was just wrong
You know that I
Want you bad
But I think you want him back
Though he only makes you mad
So know you're facing the facts
Hope you remember this time when
He screws you over
Only happy when I'm faded
Only thinking when I'm sober
If I catch you out with him
Just know I won't be mad
But you better things to do
Then let him treat you bad
Maybe i just miss you and that's hard for you to see
Will you come back to me after you leave...
(wait wrong song)
Point is you a bitch
Now I'm getting rich
Got checks coming in
Got baddies throwing it
And I'm doing it all without you
And I'm doing it all without you
Point is you a bitch
Now I'm getting rich
Got checks coming in
Got baddies throwing it
And I'm doing it all without you
And I'm doing it all without you
Point is you a bitch
Now I'm getting rich
Got checks coming in
Got baddies throwing it
And I'm doing it all without you
And I'm doing it all without you
All without you
All without you
All without you
All without you
