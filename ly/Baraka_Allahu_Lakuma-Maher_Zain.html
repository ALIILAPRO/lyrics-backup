		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're here on this special day
Our hearts are full of pleasure
A day that brings the two of you
Close together
We're gathered here to celebrate
A moment you'll always treasure
Let's ask Allah to make your love
Last forever
Let's raise our hands
And make du'a
Like the Prophet taught us
And with one voice let's all say


Baraka Allahu lakuma
Wa baraka 'alaykuma
Wa jama'a baynakuma fi khayr
Baraka Allahu lakuma
Wa baraka 'alaykuma
Wa jama'a baynakuma fi khayr
(May Allah bless everything for you two
And shower His blessings upon the two of you
And may he bring you together in everything that is good)


From now you'll share all your joys
Through hardship support each other
Together worshipping Allah
Seeking His pleasure
We pray that He will fill your life
With happiness and blessings
And grant you kids who'll make your home
Filled with laughter
Let's raise our hands
And make du'a
Like the Prophet taught us
And with one voice let's all say


Baraka Allahu lakuma
Wa baraka 'alaykuma
Wa jama'a baynakuma fi khayr
Baraka Allahu lakuma
Wa baraka 'alaykuma
Wa jama'a baynakuma fi khayr


Baraka Allah, baraka Allah
Baraka Allah, baraka Allah
Baraka Allahu Lakum wa lana
(May Allah bless everything for you all &amp; for us)


Allah barik lahuma
Allah adim hobbahuma
Allah salli wa sallim
'Ala Rasooli Allah
(Allah, bless everything the two of them
Allah, make their love last for ever
Allah, send peace and blessings
Upon the Messenger of Allah)


Allah toub 'alayna
Allah irdha 'anna
Allah ihdi khutana
'Aala sunnat Nabina
(Allah, accept our repentance
Allah, be pleased with us
Allah, guide our footsteps
Along the path of our Prophet)


Let's raise our hands
And make du'a
Like the Prophet taught us
And with one voice let's all say


Baraka Allahu lakuma
Wa baraka 'alaykuma
Wa jama'a baynakuma fi khayr
Baraka Allahu lakuma
Wa baraka 'alaykuma
Wa jama'a baynakuma fi khayr
Baraka Allahu lakuma
Wa baraka 'alaykuma
Wa jama'a baynakuma fi khayr
Baraka Allahu lakuma
Wa baraka 'alaykuma
Wa jama'a baynakuma fi khayr
