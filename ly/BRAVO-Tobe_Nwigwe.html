		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
First off, my name Tob', but it's really Tobechukwu
Got a BM that I keep my seeds up in that keep me fruitful
Grew up wearin' platinum Fubu on the Southwest eatin' fufu
And the hammer that I keep don't come with nails, that hoe'll shoot you, look
I ain't know who Bill Burr was until I met the man
Half my niggas married to the street without a wedding band
I done peeped that all the smoke these rappers want be secondhand
My pops said I'd be broke and barely eat, I shoulda bet the man

Yeah, 'cause I'm way, way, way up
Long ways from the days I'd evade valet stubbs
Couldn't pay, nowadays all the cake I make us
Is enough to buy about a hunnid trucks from Mercedes
Ivory, Sagey, Chukwueze, them my babies
Label heads be tryna sway me, F you pay me
Broke the game 2020, you could see it plainly
Can't nobody play me, I kill e'erything innately
At the helm of the mothership of drip, you can see me leakin'
Shh, be quiet, a real nigga speakin'
Voice of God every word I jot, feel the Spirit breathin'
Best new artist, but the way I cook? Very seasoned
Everything around me movin' like bachata
Usher told me do it my way, Frank Sinatra
Been a shotta, been locked in with my acatas
Now I got 'em ravin' how I'm big on lines, Haloti Ngata
Sheesh, on God, I'm a dog, bro
Need a clergy collar dodgin' fleas from you dog hoes
Adversely I affect a demon with this God flow
Then put semen all up in my queen and yell out, "Bravo"
Yeah, we on baby number cuatro
Yeah, my whole crib look like an art show
Yeah, pockets on avocado
I'm like a bird, let me fly away, Nelly Furtado, bye
