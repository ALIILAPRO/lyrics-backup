		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They just want your head
Moving up and down
Up and down
Up and down

They got inside your head
Flip it upside down
Upside down
Upside down

We can feel an order
Getting in our way
We don't need the rule of yesterday

Breaking down the borders
Tearing down the sides
Hear this one last time

They just want your head
Moving up and down
Up and down
Up and down

They got inside your head
Flip it upside down
Upside down
Upside down

They just want your head
Moving up and down
Up and down
Up and down

They've got inside your head
Flip it upside down
Upside down
Upside down

Up, up and down
Up, up and down
Up, up and down
Up, up and down

Up, up and down
Up, up and down
Up, up and down
Up and down

They just want your head
Moving up and down
Up and down
Up and down

They got inside your head
Flip it upside down
Upside down
Upside down

We can feel an order
Getting in our way
We don't need the rule of yesterday

Breaking down the borders
Tearing down the sides
Hear this one last time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time

They just want your head
Moving up and down
Up and down
Up and down

They got inside your head
Flip it upside down
Upside down
Up and down

They just want your head
Moving up and down
Up and down
Up and down

They got inside your head
Flip it upside down
Upside down
Upside down

We can feel an order
Getting in our way
We don't need the rule of yesterday

Breaking down the borders
Tearing down the sides
Hear this one last time
