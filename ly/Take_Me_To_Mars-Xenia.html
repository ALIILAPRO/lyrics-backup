		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How'd you catch me
I'm a comet coming down, call me crash landing
I said don't get close, I'll cause permanent damage
You take me to Mars
You take me, I feel it when you hold me in your arms
Take me to Mars
You take me, I feel it when you hold me in your arms
You take me to Mars
Baby I'm in love with who you are
Saw you coming straight for me
And you're everything I need
Keep crashing
Over and over again
And over and over till we collide
Feels like a movie scene
On a silver tv screen
You don't know that you saved me
Was all on my own
Heart so alone
Then you came along
And gave it a home
Wishing on stars up above
Waiting to feel what it's like to be loved
Then you came along
You take me to Mars
You take me, I feel it when you hold me in your arms
Take me to Mars
You take me, I feel it when you hold me in your arms
You take me to Mars
