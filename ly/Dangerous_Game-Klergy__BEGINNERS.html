		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh

Was it you? Left your secrets inside
All the lies you can't hide
It's a dangerous game start
Feeling high play with fire
It's a dangerous game

I see your storm rolling in
I see the groung crumbling
But in a chain reaction (ooh)
I see the dark crawling in
I see your wars, it's the end
But in a chain reaction (ooh)
It's a dangerous game

Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, it's a dangerous game
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, it's a dangerous game

(It's a dangerous game)
(It's a dangerous game, Dangerous game)
It's a dangerous game
(It's a dangerous game)
(It's a dangerous game, Dangerous game)
It's a dangerous game
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh
