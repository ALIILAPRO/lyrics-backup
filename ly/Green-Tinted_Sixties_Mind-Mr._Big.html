		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She just woke up but she´s still tired
is that the telephone ringing
The curtains can´t hold back the lite
That´s reaching into her dreams down in her heart.
If it had fingers it´d be tearing you apart.

You be looking groovy in a sixties movie.
Maybe tell the press you died.Little legend baby try your very best to hide.
A green tinted sixties mind.

She keeps memories locked away
but they are always escaping.
Neglect won´t make them fade away.
That´s reaching into her dreams down in her heart.
Don´t need fingers to be tearing it apart.

Gotta face the day there´s no other wayto clear the fog inside your mind.
Fill it up with dreams but all that you can seem to find.
A green tinted sixties mind.

Hanging out with Janis moving to Atlantis
Could have made it if you tried.
What´s the point of force it´s easy as a horse to ride
A green tinted sixties mind.

You be looking groovy...
