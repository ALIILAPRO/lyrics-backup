		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Reshaping me!
Glimmering I notice that a light sheer breaks, from being unseen
Shivering and wondering how long it takes to consume me
That heavy rain
Has doubted me for far to long
You helped me breath again
You helped me breath
It sings my name
Oh so violently
I'm still drawn in
"Please strain through me" i said
I give you this
I feel the stars
Reshaping me
The auroras light is blinding
Straight through my eyes it sees
Oh wa-oh
This message reads
My fate is sealed
I haven't let this go
Is this real!?
Will it wake me up in shade
Alone
What is this feeling I've craved for too long
(Too long)
Another blank face is claimed
Weightlessness can burden those who drift out of reach
I hope to god
It's not me
Cold!
You froze me here in time
Far from erratic
Looks like I found my home
Cold!
Almost taste it
Complete this cycle
I'll carry on
This
Name!
Just a template
For the transcendent
Being
I feel the stars
Reshaping me
The auroras light is blinding
Straight through my eyes it sees
Oh wa-oh
This message reads
My fate is sealed
I haven't let this go
Is this real!?
Will it wake me up in shade
All alone
All alone!
How can it do this!?
I gave my life for you
Tossed aside
A fleeting tomb
Do i even exist anymore?
What the hell is this place I'm searching for?
My line was in your hands
But you cut it!
You clean cut it!
You said
A mist of tears
You said
How am I here
Am I even fucking breathing
Pitch black above
Pitch black below
Infinite emptiness
Auroras soul
The Aurora
