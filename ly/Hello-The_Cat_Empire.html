		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walking down the street 
With some evil in my eye 
And some thoughts in my head 
That were making me feel high 
On my head was a hoodi 
In my ears was some bass 
Was walking by my dog 
When I saw that sexy face 
Come towards me 
With a little cheeky smile 
If she was a phone 
I'd pick her up and dial 
The fire brigade 
Or zero zero zero 
She stopped me in my tracks 
And I said 'mmm hchello hchello' 

I was sleeping in the sand 
With some dreams in my head 
That were causing an extension 
To the towel and my bed 
And the waves were rolling 
Like the curves on those legs 
Of a sweet beach bella 
With that centrefold spread 
In the midst of the slumber 
I heard some footsteps creeping 
And I woke to discover 
The woman I'd been dreaming 
She knelt down beside 
Said 'can I share your pillow?' 
I rolled over and I said 
'well hchello hchello' 
Some like money making 
Some like cars 
And some like the houses 
With the rooftop spas 
And some like to gossip 
About some rich sugar daddies 
But me and my friends 
We like the golden brown honeys 
And some like watching people 
Living on TV 
That's a little strange 
If you're asking me 
'Cause I like to eat and laugh 
And **** and play down low 
These are the things I know 
Well hchello hchello.

Welcome to this night 
Welcome to this song 
Welcome to these rhymes 
That be going on and on 
Welcome to the empire 
And the funky empire tunes 
But most of all welcome 
To the bellas in this room
Well hchello hchello
