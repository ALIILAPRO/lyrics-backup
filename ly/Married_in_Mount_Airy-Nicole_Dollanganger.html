		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was married in Mount Airy
In its prime, sometime in the late 60's
Where he carried me into a lover's suite
And we made love beneath
The mirrored ceilings

And things were merry at Mount Airy
Where they'd sing, "All you have to bring
Is your love of everything"

Don't recall what we were drinking but
I remember thinking
There was something very strange in the air
Don't recall what we were singing but
I remember swinging
With my hands caught in the curls of his long hair

(Don't recall what we were singing)
(But I remember swinging)
(Don't recall what we were drinking)

But I could swear he tasted of Sherry
Contrary to the maraschino cherries (cherries)
With our own color TV, heavenly shag carpeting
A world apart from the ordinary
Something in the air

And things were merry at Mount Airy
Where they'd sing, "All you have to bring is
Your love of everything"

Don't recall what we were drinking but
I remember thinking
There was something very strange in the air (the air, the air)
Don't recall what we were singing but
I remember swinging
With my hands caught in the curls of his long hair
