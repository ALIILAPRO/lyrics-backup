		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I bet this time of night, you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window, lookin' out at the city
And I bet sometimes you wonder 'bout me

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you, and I hope you know that
Every time I don't, I almost do
I almost do

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out, there's no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can't say hello to you and risk another goodbye

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you, and I hope you know that
Every time I don't, I almost do
I almost do

Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
It's probably better off this way
And I confess, baby
In my dreams, you're touchin' my face
And askin' me if I want to try again with you
And I almost do

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you, and I hope you know that
Every time I don't, I almost do
I almost do, ooh

I bet this time of night, you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window, lookin' out at the city
And I hope sometimes you wonder 'bout me
