		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, hey, Paula
I want to marry you
Hey, hey, Paula
No one else could ever do
I've waited so long for school to be through
Paula, I can't wait no more for you
My love, my love

Hey, Paul
I've been waiting for you
Hey, hey, hey, Paul
I want to marry you too
If you love me true
If you love me still
Our love will always be real
My love, my love

True love means planning a life for two
Being together the whole day through
True love means waiting and hoping that soon
Wishes we've made will come true
My love, my love

Hey, hey, Paula
I've been waiting for you
Hey, hey, hey, Paul
I want to marry you too
True love means planning a life for two
Being together the whole day through
True love means waiting and hoping that soon
Wishes we've made will come true
My love, my love
