		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Verse 1]
Bring me quiet, bring me into shelter
Show me loving, show me what you want from me
And I'll cover you!
See you stopping, why you're running so afraid?
You let me down, boy!

[Chorus]
And I bleed heavy for your love
But you're standing, you're standing
And I bleed heavy for your love
But you're standing, you're standing

[Verse 2]
How you treat me, how you let me fall apart
I've been stable, running to an open heart
See me crumble, crumbling is just a start
Won't you let me help boy? Let me help boy?!

[Chorus]
And I bleed heavy for your love
But you're standing, you're standing
And I bleed heavy for your love
But you're standing, you're standing

[Outro]
But you're standing, you're standing
But you're standing, you're standing
But you're standing, you're standing
You're standing
You're standing
You're standing
