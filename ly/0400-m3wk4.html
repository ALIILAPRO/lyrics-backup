		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's four am and i'm heading back from party
Seaveeeennn-
It's four am
And i'm headin' back from party
Seven people with me and we feelin' like an army
All the girls soo high
They are being so damn naughty
Sorry i don't got no time
I'm finna go to watch icarly
I can't walk in straight line
Her body is so perfect
And her soul is so devine
I'm puttin' cat ears on her head
Hentai Heaven all the time
I do smoke weed cuz i'm gangsta
Dark night with cold Arizona
We are just friends but she is callin' me her owner
I'm with the e-girl eatin' sushi watching sunset
Met her in the internet
She got a mom's breast
