		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Once, once I'm started)
Once I'm started (Once I'm started)
Once I'm started, lost in silence
Want your guidance (Want your guidance)
Want your guidance, undivided
Yeah, yeah (Undivided)
I've been lost in the boundaries, solace when you found me
Yeah, yeah
I've been lost in the boundaries, solace when you found me
Stop bringing me to closure (Closure)
Stop hanging up the phone line
Please show me how to hold on (Hold on)
Please show me how to do this right
(Stop hanging up the phone line)
Please show me how to do this right
I feel so far, were you a lie?
Waste my life, I feel so numb
Feel so far, were you a lie? (Were you a lie)
Waste my life, I feel so numb
Now we're running out of time, falling out of line
I'll see you through the haze, see you in another life
In and out of phase, on the other side
(I'll see you through the haze, see you in another life)
Now we're running out of time, falling out of line
I'll see you through the haze, see you in another life
In and out of phase, on the other side
(I'll see you through the haze, see you in another life)
Stop bringing me to closure (Closure)
Stop hanging up the phone line
Please show me how to hold on (Hold on)
Please show me how to do this right
(Stop hanging up the phone line)
Please show me how to do this right
I feel so far, were you a lie?
Waste my life, I feel so numb
Feel so far, were you a lie?
Waste my life, I feel so numb
(Please show me how to do this right)
(Stop hanging up the phone line)
(Please show me how to do this right)
