		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whenever I see your smiling face
I have to smile myself
Because I love you, yes, I do
And when you give me that pretty little pout
It turns me inside out
There's something about you, baby
I don't know

Isn't it amazing a man like me
Can feel this way
Tell me how much longer
It could grow stronger every day
Oh, how much longer?

I thought I was in love a couple of times
Before with the girl next door
But that was long before I met you
Now I'm sure that I won't forget you
And I thank my lucky stars
That you are who you are
And not just another lovely lady
Set out to break my heart

Isn't it amazing a man like me
Can feel this way
Tell me how much longer
It could grow stronger every day
How much longer?

No one can tell me that I'm doing wrong today, whenever I see you smile at me
No one can tell me that I'm doing wrong today
Whenever I see your smiling face my way
No one can tell me that I'm doing it wrong today
No one can tell me that I'm doing it wrong today, no, no, darling
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Ye, ye, ye, ye, ye, ye, ye, ye, ye, ye
