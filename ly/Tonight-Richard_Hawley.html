		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh tonight, oh tonight, oh tonight
I got it really bad

Maybe I'll go out walking, don't feel like staying home
Might take the car up to the hills, and watch the city lights below

Yes tonight, ah tonight, oh tonight
I got it really bad

Maybe I should call her, ah but then she'll know
Just want to drive out into the night, and see where that road goes

Ah tonight, oh tonight, yes tonight
I'm feeling low

Ah the restlessness that's in me, don't do me any good
I know I really should stay home tonight, but I don't think that I could

Not tonight, not tonight, no not tonight
I got it really bad

Not tonight, not tonight, you won't find me tonight
I got it really bad
