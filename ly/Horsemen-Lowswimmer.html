		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Driving home, I heard a noise I liked
The four horsemen in the cab behind
Shooting pains and a split spine i ran

It's a glove that fit's us all alike
But I was further from the finish line
Wishing luck had stood the test of time
Unmanned, I clung on for life

Sick to death of the less divine
You all get what you want on time
I stuck close to the storyline dry land

Still, the horsemen made me pass the time
Watching flashbacks in the afterlife
It was pretty good, but it lacked surprise
Offhand... I went back four times

A grieving wreck to life
Mortal breath on ice reason slept at night
Cheating death done right

Weird, the doorman was all dressed in white?
That's how they get you when
You walk in blind
Watch him go, watch him tread the line
He'll be back
