		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wish I could tell you what's been going through my head
I guess that I'm broken or maybe I'm just not ready yet
They say to your head you'll get better when you're older
But I'm not so sure
Everything I love seems to leave me, don't want it anymore
 
So please don't think it's 'cause I'm leaving
I'm simply working on believing
I'm gonna love you for a long, long time
But all I ask is that you let me try
 
And you can hear every single thought coursing through my veins
And in my eyes it's easy to tell that I'm in pain
I'm trying so hard to just say the right thing
If such a right thing even exists
And if what all I've said so far is the wrong thing
I guess that I can't resist
 
So please don't take this as me lying
I'm just so goddamn sick of goodbyeing
I'm gonna love you for a long, long time
And all I ask is that you let me try
 
Let me try (let me try, try, try, try, try)
Let me try (let me try, try, try, try, try)
Let me try (let me try, try, try, try, try)
Let me try (let me try, try, try, try, try)

You and I will never be prepared for what's to come
And I'm afraid that what I'll say will only make you run
But no amount of honesty could wipe away the love I have for you
That's true
 
'Cause I know we've got something real here
And I need to know you'll still be here
I'm gonna love you for the longest time
And all I ask is that you let me try
 
Let me try (let me try, try, try, try, try)
Let me try (let me try, try, try, try, try)
Let me try (let me try, try, try, try, try)
Let me try (let me try, try, try, try, try)
