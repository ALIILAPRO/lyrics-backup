		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I swear I'm movin’ too fast
Know I've been movin' too fast
Father, can You
Slow me down, me down, me down?
Slow me down, me down, me down?
Slow me down, me down, me down, Lord?
Slow me down, me down, me down, Lord?
I’m not gonna escape from your love
Nothing can replace Your love
So when You're chasin' me
I know that it's for my good
No replacin' me, You got me in Your arms

Resting in You, God resting in Your heart
Resting in You, God
I'm Resting in Your heart

(I'm movin' fast) Movin’ fast
(Movin’ fast) Teach me to slow down
Movin' fast lord, teach me to slow down
