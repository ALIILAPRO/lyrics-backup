		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look what you made me do
Got nothing left to lose
It's like I barely knew you at all (hm)
Isn't it such a shame
We could've drove away
It's like I barely knew you
Or even had you to lose you

You're makin' it worse, it's makin' me hurt
I dive in head-first, you go in reverse
Make me feel like I'm living a lie
But it would be nice without an Irish goodbye

Feel a little, uh, uh
In the middle, uh, uh
Live in riddles, uh, uh
If only you knew
You're something special, uh, uh
It made me mental, uh, uh
Sentimental, uh, uh
Thinkin' 'bout you got my love and my devotion
If I can't love you, then no one else is, me and you

Look what you made me do
Got nothing left to lose
It's like I barely knew you at all (hm)
Isn't it such a shame
We could've drove away
It's like I barely knew you
Or even had you to lose you

You're makin' it worse, it's makin' me hurt
I dive in head-first, you go in reverse
Make me feel like I'm living a lie
But it would be nice without an Irish goodbye
