		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In a dream
The words never came to me
I wish you were here to see what I couldn't
Waiting here
Longing to see again
Knowing that emptiness always fades

'Cause looking outside my window, I know it's changing
And part of me knows I need something more than basic
I'm hoping for more of the nights that I spent pacing

Lost for words
Searching inside my head
Losing myself again, I know it well
Ooh, whoa, breathing in
Cascading through the wind
Knowing in time, things'll make sense

'Cause looking outside my window, I know it's changing
Part of me knows I need something more than basic
I'm hoping for more of the nights that I spent pacing

Why? Oh, why?
Wondering why things have to change
Why? Oh, why?
Wondering why things are the same

Ooh, what a wonderful world, what a wonderful world
Ooh, what a wonderful world, what a wonderful world
Ooh, what a wonderful world, what a wonderful world
Ooh, what a wonderful world, what a wonderful world
Ooh, what a wonderful world, what a wonderful world
Ooh, what a wonderful world, what a wonderful world
