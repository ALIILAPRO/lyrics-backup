		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The song that angels sing
The spell that calls, The Gathering
The magic that might bring
Eternal life, The Gathering

I see a world in anger
I see a world in pain
Each day a different story
But still the message is the same

Hard news I set beside me
Sweet dreams is what I need
What daylight wants to show me
At night, appears to be insane

May I ask you in?
Shall I.
Shall I persuade you?

The song that angels sing
The spell that calls, The Gathering
The magic that might bring
Eternal life, The Gathering

My cards, the ones to choose from
The role they play tonight
Which ones embrace the loved ones?
Which ones will summon for a fight

Show me your precious darlings
And I will crush them all
Wave with your blooded sword and
I'll kiss to show I'm not afraid

May I ask you in?
Shall I
Shall I persuade you?

The song that angels sing
The spell that calls, The Gathering
The magic that might bring
Eternal life, The Gathering
