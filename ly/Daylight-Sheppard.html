		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Turn me all the way up
Turn me all the way up
Turn me all the way up, way up, way up

Pressure mounting, heartbeat pounding
I start counting all the mountains 
I still have to climb
And it keeps me up all night

The second hand is in slow motion
Information overloaded
Wide awake and wired
But I've never been so tired

When all of my stars are broken
All of the dark starts closing
In on my heart
You open up my sky, sky, sky, sky, sky

You hit me like daylight
Making me open my eyes
Your love is like every single color magnified

Some-some-something like magic
Changing my energy flow
Whenever the world around me starts to lose its glow
You light up like a light bulb

Wake up slow, slept in my clothes
My eyelids feel like they're still closed
I've wasted so much time
But you pull back the blinds

You're heaven, you're sunshine, electric pop
All I ever needed, full stop

When all of my stars are broken
All of the dark starts closing
In on my heart
You open up my sky, sky, sky, sky, sky

You hit me like daylight
Making me open my eyes
Your love is like every single color magnified

Some-some-something like magic
Changing my energy flow
Whenever the world around me starts to lose its glow
You light up like a light bulb
(Light up like a light bulb)
You light up like a light bulb

You turn me all the way up
Yeah, you turn me all the way up
And when my world starts to go cold
You light up like a light bulb (ooh-ooh)

You turn me all the way up (ooh-ooh)
Yeah, you turn me all the way up (ooh-ooh)
And when my world starts to go cold

You hit me like daylight
Making me open my eyes
Your love is like every single color magnified (color magnified)

Some-some-something like magic
Changing my energy flow
Whenever the world around me starts to lose its glow
You light up like a light bulb (ooh-ooh)

Turn me all the way up (ooh-ooh)
Turn me all the way up (ooh-ooh)
Turn me all the way up
Way up, way up

Turn me all the way up (ooh-ooh)
Turn me all the way up (ooh-ooh)
Turn me all the way up 
Way up, way up
