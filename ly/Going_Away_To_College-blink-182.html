		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please take me by the hand
It's so cold out tonight, I'll
Put blankets on the bed
I won't turn out the light, just
Don't forget to think about me and I
Won't forget you
"I'll write you once a week," she said

Why does it feel the same
To fall in love or break it off
And if young love is just a game then
I must have missed the kick off
Don't depend on me to ever follow through on
Anything but I'd go through hell for you and

I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody
This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful to me

I'll think about the times
She kissed me after class
And she put up with my friends
I acted like an ass, I'd
Ditch my lecture to watch the girls play soccer
Is my picture still hanging in her locker?

I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody
This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful

I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody
This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful
