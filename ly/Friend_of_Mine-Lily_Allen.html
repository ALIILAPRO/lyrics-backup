		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want us to have a fight
But in the background
I can hear you chatting shite
I hear it every night
And you think you're being really cool
And you've been doing it
Since we were both at school
Now who looks like a fool

You're no friend of mine, girl
And I've known it for a while, girl
You're just a waste of time, girl
Why don't you have another line, girl?

Tell me what did you expect
Have you got no self respect?
Reputation to protect?
Soon you'll be a nervous wreck
Tell me what did you expect
Have you got no self respect?
Reputation to protect?
Soon you'll be a nervous wreck

What happened to the good old days?
I was kinda hoping this was all a stupid phase
Who are you anyway?

I know you've heard this all before
I know some people who are calling you a whore
Don't know you anymore

You're no friend of mine, girl
And I've known it for a while, girl
You're just a waste of time, girl
Why don't you have another line, girl?

Tell me what did you expect
Have you got no self respect?
Reputation to protect?
Soon you'll be a nervous wreck
Tell me what did you expect
Have you got no self respect?
Reputation to protect?
Soon you'll be a nervous wreck

Tell me what did you expect
Have you got no self respect?
Reputation to protect?
Soon you'll be a nervous wreck
Tell me what did you expect
Have you got no self respect?
Reputation to protect?
Soon you'll be a nervous wreck
