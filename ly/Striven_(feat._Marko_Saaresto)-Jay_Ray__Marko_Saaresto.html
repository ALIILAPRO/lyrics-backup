		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like a flickering light
Guiding through a dark room
Like a terminal mind
Set off forevermore hopeful
This vision dances in my head
And I toy with the notion
Of walking into the fire
To revel in my emotion
There's no telling what lies ahead
I've bid farewell to my shadow friends
For something else that's worth more in the end
There's a difference between the buried and the planted
Candles and all prayers for those left stranded
No matter the cost
Despite the worst odds
There is a distance I must go
This moment is all that I control
All that I control is here and now
Soul searching
Reaching deep within me
Solely relying on the wings of fate to carry me
With my head in my hands
My soul remains unawakened
Cut out the noise and set your mind in motion
There's a difference between the buried and the planted
Candles and all prayers for those left stranded
No matter the cost
Despite the worst odds
There is a distance I must go
This moment is all that I control
All that I control is here and now
Clearing the day
Rearranging
Shaping everything
I found the way
For the self to resonate
With the clarity of an open sky
Navigating now by the stars aligned
With serenity, steely-eyed
Fueled by the burning lust for life
There's a difference between the buried and the planted
Candles and prayers for those left stranded
No matter the cost
Despite the worst odds
There is a distance I must go
This moment is all that I control
All that I control is here and now
There is no telling what lies ahead
Some things I just can't pretend
I've bid farewell to my shadow friends
For something else worth more in the end
