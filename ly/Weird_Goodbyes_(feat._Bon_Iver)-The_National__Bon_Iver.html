		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Memorize the bathwater, memorize the air
There'll come a time I'll wanna know I was here
Names on the doorframes, inches and ages
Handprints in concrete, at the softest stages

I don't know why I don't try harder
I feel like throwing towels into water

Get it down to nothing, everything that matters
Fever flashes, eyelashes and traffic patterns
Humidity, history, chemistry and panic
Swimsuits in windows of electric minivans

I don't know why I don't try harder
I've been going down some, some strange water

Move forward now, there's nothing to do
Can't turn around, I can't follow you
Your coat's in my car, I guess you forgot
It's crazy the things we let go of

It finally hits me, a mile's drive
The sky is leaking, my windshield's crying
I'm feeling sacred, my soul is stripped
Radio's painful, the words are clipped
The grief, it gets me, the weird goodbyes
My car is creepin', I think it's dying
I'm pullin' over until it heals
I'm on a shoulder of lemon fields

What was I even leaving for
I keep going back and forth
I think now I'm about to see
Didn't know how sad it'd be

Memorize the bathwater, memorize the air
There'll come a time I'll wanna know I was here
Names on the doorframes, inches and ages
Handprints in concrete, at the softest stages

I don't know why I don't try harder
I feel like throwing towels into water

Move forward now, there's nothing to do
Can't turn around, and I can't follow you
Your coat's in my car, I guess you forgot
It's crazy the things we let go of

It finally hits me, a mile's drive
The sky is leaking, my windshield's crying
I'm feeling sacred, my soul is stripped
Radio's painful, the words are clipped
The grief, it gets me, and the weird goodbyes
My car is creepin', I think it's dying
I'm pullin' over until it heals
I'm on a shoulder of lemon fields
The grief, it gets me, the weird goodbyes
My car is creepin', I think it's dying
I'm pullin' over until it heals
I'm on a shoulder of lemon fields
