		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I heard that's your ride
Took his bitch then I'd rather mine
Took her bitch, now this bitch is mine

Gettin' money, I'mma spazz out
Drive the 'Rari with the ass out
Drive the 'Rari with no tags now
Diamond bracelets, ho you mad now
Look just like me I'm your dad now
Big guns, I won't back down
Gettin' money, I'mma spazz out
Drive the 'Rari with the ass out
Drive the 'Rari with no tags now
Diamond bracelets, ho you mad now
Look just like me I'm your dad now
Big guns, I won't back down

Gettin' money like a cash cow
Rocking Thrasher so I'm rad now
Yeah now they on me 'cause I'm hot now
You was wrong I was right now
Now I'm so up that I'm her type now
And I'm so high everything upside down
And I'm so high everything upside down

Yeah I could drive, drive it fast now
Do the dash, digi-dash now
And I'm balling, yeah I like this last down
And I'm balling, yeah I like this last down
Yeah I could drive, drive it fast now
Do the dash, digi-dash now
And I'm balling, yeah I like this last down
And I'm balling, yeah I like this last down
Yeah I could drive, drive it fast now
Do the dash, digi-dash now

Now you know, watch your stack now
Take a nap, yeah, it's a raft now
Money stuffed all in my jeans
So you know I cannot lack now
Got the chopper with the beam
So you know I will not back down
He got more money than me?
Know that he talkin' that cap now
Say that he movin' a piece?
That boy really do not trap now
I heard that's a lie
Took his bitch then I read her mind
Took her bitch 'cause that bitch was bi
What a wrist, it'll make you blind

Yeah I could drive, drive it fast now
Do the dash, digi-dash now
And I'm balling, yeah I like this last down
And I'm balling, yeah I like this last down
Yeah I could drive, drive it fast now
Do the dash, digi-dash now
And I'm balling, yeah I like this last down
And I'm balling, yeah I like this last down
