		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, three, one, two, three

One, two, three, one, two, three
One, two, three

You know that he trusts you and I know that he loves you
But somehow you convinced me again
My foundation rumbles and all my morals crumble
My father's warnings run through my head (one, two, three)

Your heart's a vine that I've bled trying to climb
Yeah, you're making a ruin of me
Try to survive, keep my spirit alive
But like a knife in the woods
Yeah, you hunt down the good in me
Like a knife in the woods
Yeah, you hunt down the good in me
Like a knife in the woods
Yeah, you hunt down the good in me

One temptation sparked this
Now I can feel the darkness
It's my own fault but you had this planned
All of me, you take now, like criminals and shakedowns
Yeah, you make me forget who I am (one, two, three)

Your heart's a vine that I've bled trying to climb
Yeah, you're making a ruin of me
Try to survive, keep my spirit alive
But like a knife in the woods
Yeah, you hunt down the good in me
But like a knife in the woods
Yeah, you hunt down the good in me, hey
Like a knife in the woods
Yeah, you hunt down the good in me

All of your good is mine
All of your good is mine
All of your good is mine
All of your good is mine

Like a knife in the woods
Yeah, you hunt down the good in me, hey, yeah
