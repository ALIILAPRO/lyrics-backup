		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw the signs
The signal fires that burned atop the hill
Rising tides and violent skies
All the while the world was standing still
Defenseless as a rat in a cage
Living with our backs to the wall
From the minute we wake
(Too sedated to notice)

We're living in a nightmare
A pre-apocalyptic wasteland
Is there no one who can save us
If we refuse to save ourselves?
Our best intentions pave our path to hell
(Pave our path to hell)

What does it mean to be a captive
In the confines of your mind?
What does it mean to be a hostage
To the enemy inside?
We've been here before
I guess we learned nothing
The signs were all but ignored

The planets collide as we all stop and stare
Too jaded to notice

We're living in a nightmare
A pre-apocalyptic wasteland
Is there no one who can save us
If we refuse to save ourselves?
Our best intentions pave our path to hell

I see their shadows dance on the walls
As voices echo in empty halls
It makes my stomach sink
As I close my eyes and beg for sleep

Chaos kills the calm
Fingers through my palms
I can't make it stop
Somebody kick the chair and fucking wake me up

Spare your thoughts and prayers
They'll never be enough
It only tightens the noose
The more we struggle to cut ourselves loose

Every cry rings out like a shot
The streets run red as the forests wither and rot
Declaring with their final breath
Eternal fear is a fate worse than death
(Worse than death)

But no one's gonna save us
If we won't fucking save ourselves
Our best intentions pave our path to hell
We're living in a nightmare
(Never again will we sleep) a pre-apocalyptic wasteland
(Until we are weary and weak) 
And there's no one who can save us (save us)
If we refuse to save ourselves
Our best intentions pave our path to (hell)

And you will see me there when they tighten the noose
I deserve this just like the rest of you
