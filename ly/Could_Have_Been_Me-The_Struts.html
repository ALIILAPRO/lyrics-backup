		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't wanna live as an untold story
Rather go out in a blaze of glory
I can't hear you, I don't fear you
I'll live now 'cause the bad die last
Dodging bullets with your broken past
I can't hear you, I don't fear you now

Wrapped in your regret
What a waste of blood and sweat
Oh-oh-oh

I wanna taste love and pain
Wanna feel pride and shame
I don't wanna take my time
Don't wanna waste one line
I wanna live better days
Never look back and say
Could have been me
It could have been me
Yeah

Don't wanna live as an unsung melody
I'd rather listen to the silence telling me
I can't hear you, I won't fear you
Don't wanna wake up on a Monday morning
The thought of work is getting my skin crawling
I can't fear you, I don't hear you now

Wrapped in your regret
What a waste of blood and sweat
Oh-oh-oh

I wanna taste love and pain
Wanna feel pride and shame
I don't wanna take my time
Don't wanna waste one line
I wanna live better days
Never look back and say
Could have been me
It could have been me
Yeah

Hey
I wanna taste love and pain
Wanna feel pride and shame
Don't wanna take my time (no)
Don't wanna waste one line (hey, hey)
Wanna live better days (just better)
Never look back and say
Could have been me
It could have been me
It could have been me
It could have been me
I wanna taste love and pain
Wanna feel pride and shame
I don't wanna take my time
Don't wanna waste one line
I wanna live better days (just better)
Never look back and say
Could have been me
It could have been me
It could have been me
It could have been me
Yeah
