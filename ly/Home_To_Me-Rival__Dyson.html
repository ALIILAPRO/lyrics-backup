		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hope you don't forget 
Who you can turn to when
When it feels like the walls are gonna cave in
Know I'm not far away anytime you need saving

When your hope is lost I'll help you find your heart
I'll ease your mind
If you're in too deep just put it all on me tonight

Come home to me home to me
I can be everything you need 
Home to me home to me
I can be everything you need 


Hey it's me again 
Remember when I said
That I will always be there anytime you need me 
And I'll come runnin' just as long as I'm breathin'

When your hope is lost I'll help you find your heart
I'll ease your mind
If you're in too deep just put it all on me tonight

Cause I have faith in you
I know that we have been through hell 
Yeah I have faith in you 
So if you're feelin' helpless

Come home to me home to me
I can be everything you need 
Home to me home to me
I can be everything you need 

Everything you need 

Come home to me
Come home to me
Come home to me

Come home to me
Come home to me

Cause I have faith in you
I know that we have been through hell 
But I have faith in you 
So if you're feelin' helpless
Come home
