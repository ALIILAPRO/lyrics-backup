		  HOOK X 2


Bitch i got the sauce
I'm immortalized 
I'm the boss 
I can never live a normal life

I don't gotta lie 
When the truth so sexy 
You feel the vibe 
Now you wanna bring your bestie
Ain't no magic anymore man it's looking like 96
Afraid of how they look that's why they hide in pics
I see a lot of gluten free people 
Got no bread
And their shows like cemeteries 
Man they just so dead 
They really pussy who they kittin tho
Meanwhile I'm the goat If you didn't know 
Cristal by the litre yeah i'm sipping slow
Not even raven simone could see my vision tho
Ya nasty

Bitch i got the sauce
I'm immortalized 
I'm the boss 
I can never live a normal life

I don't gotta lie 
When the truth so sexy 
You feel the vibe 
Now you wanna bring your bestie

Cool
Verse 2

What a life
I paid the price
Matter of fact twice
With some tax
Hold up
You can do the math 
Legacy 
No body standing  next to me 
They can't step to me
But they all wish the best for me 
I get it though
jealousy and all that hate
But like Jay said that's a female trait
How you goin hate somebody 
When we got the same hours 
Nah I don't club
I just want all this power
Like

HOOK X 2


Bitch i got the sauce
I'm immortalized 
I'm the boss 
I can never live a normal life

I don't gotta lie 
When the truth so sexy 
You feel the vibe 
Now you wanna bring your bestie
Cool

Outro 

Bring ya bestie
And they lesbies
They just got 2 9's on they back like gretzky
Bitch im popping 
Look like pepsi
Bitch I got the mother fucking
