		  Girl your all I need
Girl can't you see
Be my fantasy
Your the one I need
Your the one I need
Girl you set me free
Love your energy
Your my therapy

I just need your vibe
Need you right away (yeah)
Girl can you stay
Make me navigate (yeah)
You feeling a way
Every time you stay (yeah)
Everything's ok
You love how we play
(yeah)

Gotta get you on some vibes
Baby don't you fucking lie
I can't even fucking lie
I think I want you to slide
I think you're all in my mind
I can't wait to see you mine
I'll go pick you up in 5
I think its about that time
Ride or die
Need you to be mine this time
I can't even lie, need you by my side
I want you to be my vibe (yeah)
Its our fucking time (yeah)
Break your back tonight (yeah)
Fucking you all night (yeah)
That's just what you like
Toxic but she got them eyes
