		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Silence is deadly
Just a way of life
Hiding from the weaknesses
And their satellites

Faithless and bleeding
Keeping it out of sight
Screaming from the distance
Will I ever get this right

Tell me how to say goodbye
Peel away the shame so I
Can tear apart my ribs to shed the dark
And let the sun inside

Tell me how to say goodbye
Kiss away the stain of lies
Tear apart my ribs so I, so I
Can let the sun inside

(So I, so I)
(So I, so I)

Inhaling my existence
Losing to this parasite
Shattering the chrysalis
No change without a fight

Blinded by this fury
A storm begins to rage
Circling resistance
Feeding shadows to the grave

Tell me how to say goodbye
Peel away the shame so I
Can tear apart my ribs to shed the dark
And let the sun inside

Tell me how to say goodbye
Kiss away the stain of lies
Tear apart my ribs so I, so I
Can let the sun inside

Sun inside
Give me back my life
Let the sun inside
Sun inside
Give me back my life

Tell me how to say goodbye
Peel away the shame so I
Can tear apart my ribs to shed the dark
And let the sun inside

Tell me how to say goodbye
Kiss away the stain of lies
Tear apart my ribs so I, so I
Can let the sun inside

Tell me how to say goodbye
So I, so I
Tell me how to say goodbye
So I, so I
So I can say goodbye
So I, so I
So I can say goodbye
