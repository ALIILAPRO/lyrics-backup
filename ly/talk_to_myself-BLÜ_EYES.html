		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I talked to everybody else how
I talk to myself then
I don't think I'd have any friends

Yeah I can be a bitch
When there's nobody around
Just me and myself and I
Don't know how to quit
Finding every mistake
All over my face
Till I
Start askin

Why am I why I am I why am I like this
Pushin me off of the edge into crisis

If I talked to everybody else how
I talk to myself then
I don't think I'd have any friends
I keep my standards way too high
Even when it makes me cry yeah
Won't settle for anything less
Oh, I wish I could be kinder
Just a little bit nicer
And take a break from raising hell
When I talk to myself

And I say things like
Why can't you get it right, this time
You're running out of time
You're too old for this
You should be skinnier, prettier
Nobody cares anyway
What are you doing with your life?

If I talked to everybody else how
I talk to myself then
I don't think I'd have any friends
I keep my standards way too high
Even when it makes me cry yeah
Won't settle for anything less
Oh, I wish I could be kinder
Just a little bit nicer
And take a break from raising hell
When I talk to myself

If I talked to everybody else how
I talked to myself then
I don't think i'd have any friends
Swear that I'm doing my best but
I'm far from perfection
Tomorrow I can try it again
