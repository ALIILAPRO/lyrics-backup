		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My life trapped in between
A whisper and a scream
A suicide machine of my own making
You let it kill my brain
Like needles in my veins
Consumed in your own embrace
There's no escaping

My fix is the misery
Won't stop till the end of me
I can't feel anything

Killing me one breath at a time
Caught in your web I'm paralyzed
So go on and lay me down to rest
You make it painless, painless

I can't, I can't, I can't
I can't feel any pain
I can't, I can't, I can't

I drift into the grave
Half-coma, half awake
My soul is yours to take
Always forever

I feel you under my skin
The knife is twisting within
Temptation always wins
It's never over

My fix is the misery
Won't stop till the end of me
I can't feel anything

Killing me one breath at a time
Caught in your web I'm paralyzed
So go on and lay me down to rest
You make it painless, painless

Do you know what it's like
To be hollow inside my life, my grave
Do you love me enough to finish me off
Don't leave me here this way

Killing me one breath at a time
Caught in your web I'm paralyzed
So go on and lay me down to rest
You make it painless

Killing me one breath at a time
Caught in your web I'm paralyzed
So go on and lay me down to rest
You make it painless, painless

I can't, I can't, I can't
I can't feel any pain
I can't, I can't, I can't
I can't feel any pain
I can't, I can't, I can't
I can't feel any pain
I can't, I can't, I can't
