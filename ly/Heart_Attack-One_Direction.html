		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, you got me sick
I don't know what I did
Need to take a break and figure it out, yeah

Got your voice in my head
Saying let's just be friends
Can't believe the words came out of your mouth, yeah

I'm tryna to be okay, I'm tryna to be alright
But seeing you with him just don't feel right

And I'm like
Ow, never thought it'd hurt so bad
Getting over you and
Ow, you're giving me a heart attack
Looking like you do
'Cause you're all I ever wanted
Thought you would be the one that's
Ow, giving me a heart attack
Getting over you

Yeah

Baby, now that you're gone
I can't stand dumb love songs
Missing you is all I'm thinking about, yeah
Everyone's telling me I'm just too blind to see
How you messed me up, I'm better off now, yeah

I'm tryna to be okay, I'm tryna to be alright
But seeing you with him just don't feel right

And I'm like
Ow, never thought it'd hurt so bad
Getting over you and
Ow, you're giving me a heart attack
Looking like you do
'Cause you're all I ever wanted
Thought you would be the one that's
Ow, giving me a heart attack
Getting over you

Yeah, every time you look like that
You're giving me a heart attack

But seeing you with him just don't feel right

And I'm like
Ow, never thought it'd hurt so bad
Getting over you and
Ow, you're giving me a heart attack
Looking like you do
'Cause you're all I ever wanted
Thought you would be the one that's
Ow, giving me a heart attack
Getting over you

You're all I ever wanted, yeah
Yeah, every time you look like that (come on)
You're all I ever wanted
You're giving me a heart attack (ow)
