		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some say love is a burning thing
That it makes a fiery ring
Oh, but I know love as a fading thing
Just as fickle as a feather in a stream
See, honey, I saw love
You see it came to me
It put its face up to my face so I could see
Yeah, then I saw love disfigure me
Into something I am not recognizing

See the cage, it called, I said, "Come on in"
I will not open myself up this way again
And lay my face to the soil, and all my teeth to the sand
I will not lay like this for days now upon end
You will not see me fall, nor see me struggle to stand
To be acknowledged by some touch from his gnarled hands
You see the cage it called, I said, "Come on in"
I will not open myself this way again

You see the moon is bright in that treetop night
I see the shadows that we cast in the cold clean light
Now my feet are gold and my heart is white
And we race out on the desert plains all night
See, honey, I am not some broken thing
I do not lay in the dark waiting for thee
Now my heart is gold, my feet are light
And I'm racing out on the desert plains all night

So some say love is a burning thing
That it makes a fiery ring
Oh, but I know love as a caging thing
Just a killer come to call from some awful dream
Ah, and all you folks, you come to see
You just stand there in the glass looking at me
But my heart is wild, and my bones are steel
And I could kill you with my bare hands if I was free
