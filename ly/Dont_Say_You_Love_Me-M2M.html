		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got introduced to you by a friend
You were cute and all that, baby you set the trend
Yes you did, oh
The next thing I know we're down at the cinema
We're sitting there, you start kissing me
What's that about?

You're moving too fast, I don't understand you
I'm not ready yet, baby I can't pretend
No, I can't
The best I can do is tell you to talk to me
It's possible, eventual
Love will find a way (Love will find a way)

Don't say you love me
You don't even know me
If you really want me
Then give me some time
Don't go there baby
Not before I'm ready
Don't say your heart's in a hurry
It's not like we're gonna get married
Give me, give me some time

Here's how I play, here's where you stand
Here's what to prove to get any further than where it's been
I'll make it clear, not gonna tell you twice
Take it slow, you keep pushing me
You're pushing me away (Pushing me away)

Don't say you love me
You don't even know me
If you really want me
Then give me some time
Don't go there baby
Not before I'm ready
Don't say your heart's in a hurry
It's not like we're gonna get married
Give me, give me some time

Oooo
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Oooo
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Don't say you love me
You don't even know me, baby
Baby don't say you love me
Baby, baby
If you really want me, then give me some time (Give me some time)

Don't say you love me
You don't even know me
If you really want me
Then give me some time (Won't you give me some time?)
Don't go there baby
Not before I'm ready
Don't say your heart's in a hurry
It's not like we're gonna get married
Give me, give me some time

Baby, don't say you love me
You don't even know me
If you really want me
Then give me some time (Won't you give me some time?)
Don't go there baby
Not before I'm ready
Don't say your heart's in a hurry
It's not like we're gonna get married
Give me, give me some time

Don't say you love me
You don't even know me
If you really want me
Then give me some time...
