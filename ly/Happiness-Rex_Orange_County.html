		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll be the one that stays 'til the end
And I'll be the one that needs you again
And I'll be the one that proposes in a garden of roses
And truly loves you long after our curtain closes

But will you still love me
When nobody wants me around?
When I turn eighty-one and forget things
Will you still be proud?

'Cause I am the one that's waited this long
And I am the one that might get it wrong
And I'll be the one that will love you the way I'm supposed to
Girl, oh

But will you still love me
When nobody wants me around, around?
When I turn eighty-one and forget things
Will you still be proud?

Proud of me and my short list of accomplishments, say
And me and my lack of new news
Me and my selfishness, oh, me and myself
Wish you nothin' but a happy new version of you

Because I, I, mm
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, yeah

I want you to tell me you find it hard to be yourself
So I can say, "It's gonna be alright", yeah
And I want you to love me the way you love your family
The way you love to show me what it's like
To be happy
