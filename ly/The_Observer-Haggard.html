		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So all the stars
Will guide us on our way
The Sextant as a leader
Has duration for all days 

Look at the amazing sky
In long and profund discoveries
With a strong and a clear mind he's encryping
Secrets of astronomy 

In endless nights
He observes the sky
This publications will change the world 

Galileo Galilei 

Only what my eyes will see, I will believe!
Day and night - seperated by the light 

In Pisa he's required
To teach the theory
That the stars and all the planets
Revolve around the earth
But he believed
In a different truth
The helocentric one
Proposed by Kopernikus
A new age had begun 

The stolen sun
Made their fear rise
And man had sacrificed
A shadow was the reason why 

And all the servants of the cross - they will deny
Will deny the starlight 

In Pisa he's required
To teach the theory
That the stars and all the planets
Revolve around the earth
But he believed
In a different truth
The helocentric one
Proposed by Kopernikus
A new age had begun
