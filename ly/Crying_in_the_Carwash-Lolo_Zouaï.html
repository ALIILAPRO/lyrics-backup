		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Crying in the carwash
Tryna feel something
In a city that never rains
Wishing I could could take the top off
Cover up the tears
And watch them all go down the drain

Feel like the walls are closing
Lights are on I'm not home oh
I don't know where I'm going
Windows rolled up so no one knows

When it rains it's really pouring
Need somewhere to go and feel like I do
Don't invite me I'll be boring
I'm not in the mood to party

When I'm
Crying in the carwash
Tryna feel something
In a city that never rains
Wishing I could could take the top off
Cover up the tears
And watch them all go down the drain

Now I'm crying crying
Lay my head on the glass
Yeah I'm crying crying
No one knows I'm a mess
Crying in the carwash
Trying to feel something
In a city that never rains

So let them fall down
I'll let them fall down
I wish they would fall down
Yeah let them fall down

Feel like my throat is closing
World is ending I been lost but no one noticed (nobody noticed me)
And all I wanna do is scream
(Oh)
I'd rather be anyone but me

When it rains it's really pouring
Need somewhere to go and feel like I do
Don't invite me I'll be boring
I'm not in the mood to party when I'm

Crying in the carwash
Tryna feel something
In a city that never rains
Wishing I could could take the top off
Cover up the tears
And watch them all go down the drain

Now I'm crying crying
Lay my head on the glass
Yeah I'm crying crying
No one knows I'm a mess
Crying in the carwash
Trying to feel something
In a city that never rains

So let them fall down
I'll let them fall down
I wish they would fall down
Yeah let them fall down
