		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If your body's feelin' bad
And it's the only one you have
You want to take away the pain
Go out walkin' in the rain.
You watch the flowers go to bed,
Ask the man inside your head
Your spirit never has to grieve
All ya got to do's believe.
The faith healer
The faith healer

All ya got to do is feel
Your body's going to start to heal
The fingertips of holy fire
Everlasting sweet desire
It don't matter what the doctor said
The healer man will sail away
Immortality for two
The miracles, they will come to you

The faith healer
The faith healer
Can I put my hands on you?
Can I put my hands on you?
The faith healer
The faith healer

Faith, and hope and charity
The simple relativity
He can make you understand
All you've got to do is take his hand
It don't matter what somebody said
Ask the man inside your head
The fingertips of holy fire
Everlasting sweet desire

The faith healer
The faith healer
Can I put my hands on you?(six times)
The faith healer.......(3 times and end)
