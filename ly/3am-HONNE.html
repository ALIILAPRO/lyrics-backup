		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's in the eye of the beholder
And it's you I'm looking at
Oh your freckles paint a constellation
Your whole body is a map
But I know where I'm going
I have known a long long time
And girl you're going with me
'Cause tonight girl you're all mine

There's no point in trying to hide it
I will come and find it
I know it's in there somewhere
Your love for me is out there
I can hear it calling
Where's your sense of belonging?
We could be getting frisky girl
Till three o'clock in the morning

Something caught my attention
Yeah it's you I'm talking 'bout
'Cause your eyes are like an ocean
I can dive straight into that

And I feel like I'm weightless
When I'm 'round you nothing can bring me down
You make me careless
Not a thing, not one thing could stop us now

There's no point in trying to hide it
I will come and find it
I know it's in there somewhere
Your love for me is out there
I can hear it calling
Where's your sense of belonging?
We could be getting frisky girl
Till three o'clock in the morning

Oh baby, why do you keep on fighting me?
You won't know what you got until it's gone
So screw your head back on
Know that you're my girl
You are my number, my number one
My number one
Girl, you're my number one

There's no point in trying to hide it
I will come and find it
I know it's in there somewhere
Your love for me is out there
I can hear it calling
Where's your sense of belonging?
We could be getting frisky girl
Till three o'clock in the morning
