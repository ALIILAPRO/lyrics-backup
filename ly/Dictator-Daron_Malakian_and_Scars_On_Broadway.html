		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I don't need a dictator to control me
Oh, I don't need a invader to destroy me

War is coming
Soldiers marching
God is falling
Your politics will never corrupt me
War is coming
Soldiers marching
God is dying
Your politics will never corrupt me

Oh, I don't need a fake savior to accuse me
Oh, I don't need a crusader to convert me

War is coming
Soldiers marching
God is falling
Your politics will never corrupt me
War is coming
Soldiers marching
God is dying
Your politics will never corrupt me

Your politics, your politics
Your politics will never correct me
Your politics, your politics
Your politics will never corrupt

Your politics, your politics
Your politics will never correct me
Your politics, your politics
Your politics will never corrupt me

War is coming (your politics, your politics)
Soldiers marching (your politics will never correct me)
God is falling (your politics, your politics)
God is dying (your politics will never corrupt me)

Oh, I don't need a dictator
Oh, I don't need an invader
Oh, I don't need a crusader
Oh, I don't need a dictator

Your politics, your politics
Your politics will never correct me
Soldiers marching (your politics will never correct me)
War is coming (your politics, your politics)
