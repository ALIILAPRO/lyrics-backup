		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Face it kid she never really did
And everything you said
Fell like spit into her drink

And while you were sleeping
She was lying there awake
Just wondering how long it would take
Till she could get back to her place
And find some other cloud to drift on

Face it babe boys were made to fly away
No matter what they say
Theyâ€™ll lie right to your face

And while they were flying
You were standing on a chair
Just wondering how you could get up there
And bed an angel in mid-air
Then drag it to the ground and drift on
And drift down

Drift down
