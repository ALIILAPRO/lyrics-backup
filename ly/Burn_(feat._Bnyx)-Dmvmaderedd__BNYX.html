		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's useless
I'm working on fine, and then he acts
They say the in da street
But they really don't have shit

I rap with a passion, to the other niggas
Saying they really rapping, y'all niggas is capping
I'm gonna hit you with a motherfucking Mac-10
I'ma show every nigga who the fuck I am

And I feel like I'm spinning my verse, and I put your ass in a hearse
Used to sell to fiends every first, why every bitch gon' learn
Fuck forever that I never work, sad every day I'm hurt
High every day I'm burnt, sad me and her won't work

All of you getting on my nerves
You gotta see the image first, feel like I'm locked up in a heist
I'm fucked up like when you grab a bitch purse
I'm beating the kitty, I'm making the squirt

I get so lit that I get too turnt
I hope that bitch burn
Yeah, I hope that bitch burn
It's useless
