		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One more drink, one more Bacardi
One more dance at this afterparty
We still going, going strong 
(Going, going strong, going, going strong)
Speed so fast like a Ferrari
We get wild like on safari
We still going, going strong 
(Going, going strong, going, going strong)

And all of these good things, good things, good things
All we need, good things, good things, good things

Tonight, we go all night long
We party like Post Malone
Don't tell me to go-o-o
Yeah, we are never, ever going home, tonight
Ain't nobody kill my vibe
Don't tell me to go-o-o
Yeah, we are never, ever going home

Yeah, we are never, ever going home
Yeah, we are never, ever going home

See the ocean there in your eyes
In slow motion, we see the sun rise
We are, we are in a zone
Five AM and we still are rolling
In the deepest of my emotions
We are, we are in a zone

And all of these good things, good things, good things
All we need, good things, good things, good things

Tonight, we go all night long
We party like Post Malone
Don't tell me to go-o-o
Yeah, we are never, ever going home, tonight
Ain't nobody kill my vibe
Don't tell me to go-o-o
Yeah, we are never, ever going home

Yeah, we are never, ever going home
Yeah, we are never, ever going home

Tonight, we go all night long
We party like Post Malone
Don't tell me to go-o-o
Yeah, we are never, ever going home, tonight
Ain't nobody kill my vibe
Don't tell me to go-o-o
Yeah, we are never, ever going home

(Home) yeah, we are never, ever going home
Never, ever going home
Yeah, we are never, ever going home
