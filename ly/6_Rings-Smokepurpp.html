Nine Seven

Standing in the kitchen with a bitch
Whippin' out bricks look at my rim like six
Standing in the kitchen with a bitch
Whippin' out bricks look at my rim like six
Six rings, six rings, six rings, six rings
Standing in the kitchen with a bitch
Whippin' out bricks look at my rim like six
Standing in the kitchen with a bitch
Whippin' out bricks look at my rim like six
Six rings, six rings, six rings, six rings

Standing in the kitchen with a bitch
Whippin' out bricks look at my rim like six
Remember I was bagging up nicks
Bagging up bricks keep blue
Hundreds like crip
Lil Water, hurricane wrist, hurricane bitch
Hurricane 30 with a dick
Pull up on your block with a truck
Niggas get buck, and I keep a semi tucked
Glock 44 with the beam, fuck
Nigga know what I mean, fuck
Bitch I be serving the fiends, I turn
Your lil' brother to fiend, what, huh
I turn your lil' brother to fiend
I bet I be serving the clean
MOB all of my team
Niggas know I'm sippin' on the wok
(Wok, wok, wok, wok, yo)
Niggas know I shut down your
Whole block, phew, phew, phew, hey
Pull up to your hood I drop
The top, I drop the top, hey
Pull up on your bitch, she
Dropped the top, huh, what

Standing in the kitchen with a bitch
Whippin' out bricks look at my rim like six
Standing in the kitchen with a bitch
Whippin' out bricks look at my rim like six
Six rings, six rings, six rings, six rings
Standing in the kitchen with a bitch
Whippin' out bricks look at my rim like six
Standing in the kitchen with a bitch
Whippin' out bricks look at my rim like six
Six rings, six rings, six rings, six rings
