		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl, you say you want it
And I have no trips about it
And these played-out faces around me
Want you to know where they go
But they ain't got nothing on you
Say "ah" and open your mouth for me
I've got you locked down like police
No three-to-five, you're doing life, so

Please don't knock over my heart
'Cause my heart is full of you
Yeah, my heart is full of you
I'm not worried 'bout tomorrow
'Cause my heart is full of you
Yeah, my heart is full of you

These noisy voices, phony
They say I'm not really for you
'Cause I slept around before you
And I had fun, but now I'm done
So put your arms around me
And I'll put away the snowflakes
And you'll be my only, only
No three-to-five, you're doing right 'cause

Please don't knock over my heart
'Cause my heart is full of you
Yeah, my heart is full of you
I'm not worried 'bout tomorrow
'Cause my heart is full of you
Yeah, my heart is full of you, oh

After a while, I fanned the fire
Then I knew that you were wild
I think that the time is now
Come on, come on, come on
I think that the time is now
Come on, come on
I think that the time is now
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
I think that the time is now whoa oh, oh oh
Come on, take it down

Please don't knock over my heart, don't knock
'Cause my heart is full of you
Yeah, my heart is full of you
Come on, baby, come on, baby, come on, baby
I'm not worried 'bout tomorrow
'Cause my heart is full of you
Yeah, my heart is full of you

I think that the time is now
Bring it down, bring it down, bring it down
I think that the time is now yeah yeah, oh
Think that the time is now final one
I think that the time is now
