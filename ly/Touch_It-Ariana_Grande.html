		  How do I make the phone ring?
Why do I even care?
How are you all around me when you're not really there?
When you're not really there?
How do I feel you on me when you're not on my skin?
Why do you say you want me, then tell me "I'm not coming in"?
Baby, just come on in

'Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone
And I remember all the places you wanna go
Take me all the way
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
'Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave
I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace
Take me all the way
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it

How do you know I'm breathing, when I'm holding my breath?
Why don't we face the danger just for the night and forget?
Baby, let's just forget
Remind me why we're taking a break
It's obviously insane
'Cause we both know what we want
So why don't we fall in love?
Baby, let's fall in love

'Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone
And I remember all the places you wanna go
Take me all the way
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
'Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave
I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace
Take me all the way
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it

Oh, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
Baby, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
Baby, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
Ain't nobody gonna touch it

Remind me why we're taking a break
It's obviously insane
'Cause we both know what we want
So why don't we fall in love?
Baby, let's be in love

'Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone
And I remember all the places you wanna go
Take me all the way
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
'Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave
I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace
Take me all the way
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it

Baby, ain't nobody gonna
Baby, ain't nobody gonna
Baby, ain't nobody gonna
