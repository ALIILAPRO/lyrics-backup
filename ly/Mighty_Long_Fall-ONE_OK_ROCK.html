		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When we met the pain
Stood still
It was us
Then suddenly
It's where'd you go?
The system blew I knew
This side of me
I want a little more
But inside it seems
I'm just a little boy
Nothing else

Don't go
It's a mighty long fall
When you thought love was the top, wow
Oh no, it's a wake up call
When your life went into shock
It seems like gravity keeps pulling us back down

Don't go
It's a mighty long fall
When you know time is up, wow wow

嘘を一つ 愛を二つ
それでなんとか やり過ごしてきたでしょ?
でもそれじゃもう僕を ダマせないでしょ?
じゃどうする?どうしよ!

Don't go
It's a mighty long fall
When you thought love was the top, wow
Oh no it's a wake up call
When your life went into shock
描きたがりな未来に明日はない
いっそどうせ痛むなら
傷め続けよう 続けよう

Get up, get up, get up, get up
Time to make amends for what you did
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Running with the demons in your head
Let's shout it out completely
You never really wanna know
Let's shout it out
We're screaming oh, oh

Don't go 
It's a might long fall
When you thought love was the top
Oh no, it's a wake up call
When your life went into shock, wow
It seems like gravity keeps pulling us back down

Don't go
It's a mighty long fall
When you know time is up, wow wow
(Don't go)
(Don't go)
(Don't go)
(Don't go)
