		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm beautiful, I know cause it's the season
But what am I to do with all this beauty?
Biology, I am an organism, I'm chemical
That's all, that is all

I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
And feel my skin is plump and full of life
I'm in my prime
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe
About to fall, capture me

Or at least take my picture
Kuzurete yuku maeni
I'm pulsing, my blood is red and unafraid of living
Beginning to end

I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
And feel my skin is plump and full of life
I'm in my prime
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe
About to fall

How I feel this river rushing through my veins
With nowhere else to go, it circles 'round

I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
And feel my skin is plump and full of life
I'm in my prime
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe
About to fall, capture me
