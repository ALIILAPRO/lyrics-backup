		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Any time and any season
There's a rhyme and there's a reason
We keep spinning on this tiny rock in circles

Could have spawned in a much less pleasing place
Be squeezed to death in outer space
Or frozen in the system of AMOGUS

Anyway
Humanity is young
Some monkeys found a common tongue
We built the cities, we got overrun by locusts

We just made up a structured lore
But gods weren't there to help us, nor
Osiris, nor Anubis, nor AMOGUS

Stands and books and
Brands and hooks and
The McDonald's meals you used to adore

They're camouflaging
They're sabotaging
I can't take it anymore

Please repost
There's an impostor
Everywhere you go
Please repost
Looking the most
Amogous sussous

Please repost
There's an impostor
Nowhere to report
Could have lost the game that they host
They're in you and they're in me

There's been one impostor since the ancient days
Venting through time and space and taking different names
What if we've been brainwashed to write this song as well
Because these very chords are looking sus as hell

We invented letters but nobody discussed
Why the very first one was looking kinda sus

Well the humanity is doomed
See, in Japan it means the Moon
And the whole language of Sri Lanka's kinda sussy

So leave your cozy sleeping bags
And hurry up to the elec
There's a new task to welcome our new lord and master

Credo in amogum et impostores suspectos
Quo fugiam ab eorum spiritibus

Please repost
There's an impostor
Everywhere you go
Please repost
Looking the most
Amogous sussous

Please repost
There's an impostor
Nowhere to report
Could have lost the game that they host
They're in you and they're in me

Aaargh I can't take it anymore

Please repost, there's an impostor
Please repost, there's an impostor
Please repost, there's an impostor

Now
I'm gonna die in peace
There's a place for me in heaven
For I have a Lego piece 26047
