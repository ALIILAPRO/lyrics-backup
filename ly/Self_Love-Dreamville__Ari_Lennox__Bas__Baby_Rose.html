		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I said
Tired of being cordial
Tired of being normal
Tired of being forced in
Tied up in the moment
I'm leaving with outer purpose
Wearing it on the surface, love
Making it look good
Meanwhile it's been hurting, oh

Self love is the best love
See your love is the worst drug
Self love is the best love
But your love is the worst drug

Ahh, ah-ah-ah (ah)
(Hey, hee) ah, ah-ah-ah (oh)

Tired of all this faking
Wearing all of this makeup
And meanwhile feeling complacent
Fitting in, feeling basic and
Meanwhile tryna replace him
But all these feelings are makeshift
Hard for me to face it
When everything is changing, ay

Self love is the best love
But your love was the worst drug
Self love is the best love
But your love is the worst drug

Ahh, ah-ah-ahh, ah
Ahh, ah-ah-ahh (oh)

Take it in vain, this pain is a feeling that we can't ignore
Dealer man, hand me more
A baby in a candy store
I got secrets that just can't leave tour
How did we go from lost in your arms to 
arms in a conflict?
Long arm my conscience
Lost in my thoughts
The cost of my art, we growing apart
You growing irate
Stuck in the door of my state
I carry my Gemini traits
I bury my face
Shameful hands, took your hand
Led you astray, as you would say
As soon as we clash, you adjudicate
As for the date, it was like last June or May
We were like, "Let's do the break", 'cause

Self love is the best love
But your love was the worst drug
Self love is the best love
But your love is the worst drug

Ahh, ahh, ah-ah-ah
Ahh, ah-ah-ah (oh)
