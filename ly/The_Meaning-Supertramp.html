		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just look at the comfort that you call your home,
Just kidding yourself that you're never alone.
Well maybe there's something, there's one thing you shouldn't have said
So you better beware
And you'd better get, and you'd better get light in your head,
And you'd better get, and you'd better get peace in your bed
If you wanna get, if you wanna get high

You're watchin' the movie go blistering by,
Just look at the sadness, I wish I could cry
Well maybe there's something, there's one thing that I should have said,
Well it better be said.
It's the beckoning, it's the reckoning holding your heart,
It's beginning to, it's beginning to squeeze you apart
Don't you wanna get, don't you wanna get high?

You're holding the world in the palm of your hand,
What you're tellin' your children you don't understand

If you know what the meaning is
If you know what the meaning is
If you know what the meaning is
If you know what the meaning is
If you know what the meaning is
If you know what the meaning is
If you know what the meaning is
Meaning is, meaning is, meaning is?

Oh you better beware
And you'd better get, and you'd better get light in your head,
And you'd better get, and you'd better get peace in your bed
If you wanna get, if you wanna get high.
Just look at the madness that glows in your eyes,
You're frightened your children will steal your disguise

If you know what the meaning is
If you know what the meaning is
If you know what the meaning is
If you know what the meaning is
If you know what the meaning is
If you know what the meaning is
If you know what the meaning is
If you know what the meaning is
If you know what the answer is
If you know what the answer is
If you know what the answer is
If you know what the answer is
If you know what the meaning is
If you know what the meaning is
If you know what the meaning is
If you know what the meaning is?
