		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  California loving
With that Montgomery hustling
I give you that rough loving
It keeps you by and by, by my side

I finally understood
I know that we're still good
I've been tryna get away just to come and see you
And that pussy so good that it makes me tell the truth

I know, and you know
That this thing that we have just aint for sure
There's majesty between your thighs and I like that
I know your body so well, I could paint that

I know you want somebody humble, but I ain't that
Thousand dollar shades don't break that
But I still wanna take you home
Take you home

I wanna take you over
I wanna take you over
Just leave your problems at the door
I've got the cuffs; they're on the floor

A new thing, this aint a new thing
But a you thing, a me and you thing (Between me and you)
Just lay it down on me
Yeah yeah

Hey mama (Hey mama)
Tell me what's under (What's under)
All of your struggles (Your struggles)
I just wanna love ya

Hey mama (Hey mama)
Tell me what's under (What's under)
All of your struggles (Your struggles)
I just wanna love ya

Hey mama
Oh mama
Hey mama
Oh mama
