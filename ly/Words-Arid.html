		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know how you feel
You're still hopeful
for something real
we always knew
this day would end
And leave us silent
once again
I hope you know
the state I'm in
I complicate
most everything
I hope you

I know how you feel
You're still hopeful
for something real
we always knew
this day would end
and leave us broken
once again
I hope you know
the state I'm in
I complicate
most everything
I hope you know
Just what it is
I hope you'll find
Just what you miss
I hope you

It will come to you
At the break of day
It will come to you
It'll wash away
It will come to you
Like the morning sun
It'll come to you

There'll never be another you, there'll never be another chance at bliss
There'll never be another you, there'll never be another time like this

I hear your words
You call my name
There's nothing left for us to say
I hear your words
come sing to me
In broken voice, you'll set me free
I hear your words
You call my name
There's nothing left for us to say
I hear your words
come sing to me
In broken verse, you'll set me free
I hear you

I know how you feel
You're still hopeful
