		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Almost forty-eight hours have passed since the fall of an atomic bomb)
(And an attack upon the cities of man)
(And even now we are only beginning to see the aftermath)
(Of a massive display of destruction and power)
(That has uprooted our fresh outset of peace in civilized society)
(Despite the rubble, there is a predominant sense of wonder and marvel)
(At the awesome nature of this technological terminus)
(That has bewildered the very core of the human psyche)

Sometimes at night I let it get to me
And sometimes I'm sure it gets to all of us
And last night it had me down, I'm feeling numb
I can try, but sometimes that is not enough
No, sometimes that is not enough
No, sometimes that is not enough

And stop calling me out, we're never going to
Put the pieces back together if you won't let me get better
And stop digging it up or we're never gonna
See it all in bloom

And thinking back upon those days
Way, way back when I was young
I was such a little shit
'Cause I was always on the run
Well, you know just what they say
That, "Just like father then like son"
Don't delude me with your sympathy
'Cause I can do this on my own

And this won't be the last time
That I break down and wanna crawl to bed
'Cause the truth is you're the only voice I wanna hear in my head

So, stop calling me out, we're never going to
Put the pieces back together if you won't let me get better
And stop digging it up or we're never gonna
See it all in bloom

And stop calling me out, we're never going to
Put the pieces back together if you won't let me get better
And stop digging it up or we're never gonna
See it all in bloom
All in bloom
All in bloom
