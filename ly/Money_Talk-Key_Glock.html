		  (Let the band play)
The fuck?
Ayy

Money talk, what the fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
Quarter mil' on the Richard, I'm ballin' out
Half a mil' at the trap, this a haunted house
Fucked your bitch, now she walk like a zombie now (uh)
I'm that nigga her nigga be worried 'bout (yeah)
Pay my lil' cuz to gun your big brother down (yeah)
Got them bands, flipped my gang, served the whole town (yeah)
Used to sell pounds, now I sell out shows now (woo)
Yeah, sellin' out shows
Sellin' out fours, I'm back on the road, let's go
Yeah, let's get a bankroll
Until it can't fold, then go get some more, let's go
Yeah, bitch, I'm G.I. Joe (yeah)
Yeah, strapped up just like G.I. Joe, uh
Play with me, your brains get blown
Yeah, yeah, bitch, your brains get blown

Yeah, ballin' too hard, bitch, look at the score, huh (look at the score)
