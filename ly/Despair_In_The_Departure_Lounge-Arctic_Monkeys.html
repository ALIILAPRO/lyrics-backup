		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He's pining for her in a people carrier
There might be buildings and pretty things to see like that
But architecture won't do

Although it might say a lot about the city or town
I don't care what they've got, keep on turning them down
It don't say the funny things she does
Don't even try and cheer him up, because it just won't happen

He's got the feeling again, this time on the aero plane
There might be tellies in the back of the seats in front
But Rodney and Del won't do

Although it might take your mind off the aches and the pains
Laugh when he falls through the bar but you're feeling the same
'Cause she isn't there to hold your hand
She won't be waiting for you when you land

It feels like she's just nowhere near
You could well be out on your ear
This thought comes closely followed by the fear
And the thoughts of it makes you feel a bit ill

Yesterday I saw a girl who looked like someone
You might knock about with
And almost shouted

And then reality kicked in within us
It seems as we become the winners
You lose a bit of summat
And half wonder if you won it at all

And don't say ow 'cause you've got no idea
And she's still nowhere near
And the thought comes closely followed by the fear
And the thoughts of it makes you feel a bit ill

Despair in the departure lounge
It's one and they'll still be around at three
No signal and low battery, what's happened to me?
