		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're in-between a page of life you never dreamed
The answer won't come from that magazine
This time it's real and you're not sure just what to feel
Who can i trust to say
Should i give love now should i take love now

(chorus)
I'm taking the chance
And giving myself to you
If something's not right then tell me i'm wrong
I just want our love to carry on

Sometimes the fear of losing you has been so near
I needed to make this choice on my own
To let love in when i'm so scared when things begin
Don't ever run away i feel close to you now
You know i need you now

(chorus)

I'm taking the chance
And giving myself to you
If something's not right then tell me i'm wrong
I just want our love to carry on
I'm taking the chance
I can't let this feeling leave
I don't want those nights of waiting so long
I'm taking the chance before it's gone

Taking the chance
Taking the chance
Taking the chance
Taking the chance
On you
(repeat chorus)
