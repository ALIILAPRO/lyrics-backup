1st VERSE: Spin out im bout watch em all spin 

They use to diss they my friend now 

Pull out the stick & they chill out chill

Woah no I'm not your m*ther f*cking bro

Them bitches will knock at ya door

You bout to witness Jeho vah ay

You know I'm Michigan made 

Shirt on givenchy 

Surf on Swerve on beat like a wave 

Purging & curving these demons all day 

I put them shits in a maze like

CHORUS: nana na nana they can't catch me just pull up ina tessy test me get messy ohh no gas I'm bout to slide out & crash but I know they coming in last nana na nana they can't catch me


Geez you know im playing for keeps 

Running my city like Meechie

Come stai tutto bene? cause every good here with io

I just came up need a big fat ring 

Told bad leng kiss that ting

Had to get â€˜em right like ding ding 

Yeah they got me once I'm the get back king 

Wap go rrring 

Chop gon sing

I don't really do that chit chat ting
