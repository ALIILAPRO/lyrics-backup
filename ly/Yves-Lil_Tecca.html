What the fuck is you on?
Shawty, she know I'm a don
Beatin' my chest, nigga, King Kong
Jeans Yves, nigga, Saint Laurent
I get a check, nigga, every month
I'm blowin' gas, nigga, every blunt
Nowadays, niggas ain't sayin' none
Niggas ain't sayin' none

They know how I been, they know how I live
Pull up on your block, but niggas ain't there
Talkin' 'bout Tecca, they couldn't compare
And you got a choice in this shit, truth or dare
My life a movie, that shit on demand
I tell that ho, "Better chill, I'm the man"
Blues, she wanna chill off the Xan
I went in half and a nigga can't stand now

If I pull up, it's a man down
I know these niggas be chattin', but fuck it, though
I know these niggas be fanned out
Nigga say he got a bankroll, not a bankroll if it can't pile
One song make a nigga get cocky, lil' nigga better stay in style
I'm in this shit with the Mafia, bitch
Not in the scene, but I'm still in the mix
You said your name, I don't know who you is, is, is, is, is
Got a new number, who callin'? Who this? This, this, this, this
Your bitch a ho, but it's none of my biz-biz-biz, business
My bitch she said I'm too real like Madrid
She probably right, you probably right
I think I want her, but just for the night
I think I want her, but I'm probably high
I never got a real reason why
Niggas say they want the old me, yeah
But these niggas, they don't know me, yeah
How you know I even know me yet?
How you know I even solved me yet?

What the fuck is you on?
Shawty, she know I'm a don
Beatin' my chest, nigga, King Kong
Jeans Yves, nigga, Saint Laurent
I get a check, nigga, every month
I'm blowin' gas, nigga, every blunt
Nowadays, niggas ain't sayin' none
Niggas ain't sayin' none

They know how I been, they know how I live
Pull up on your block, but niggas ain't there
Talkin' 'bout Tecca, they couldn't compare
And you got a choice in this shit, truth or dare
My life a movie, that shit on demand
I tell that ho, "Better chill, I'm the man"
Blues, she wanna chill off the Xan
I went in half and a nigga can't stand now

They know how I live, they know how I been
Pull up on your block, but niggas ain't there
They know how I live, they know how I been
Pull up on your block, but niggas ain't there
But niggas ain't there, but still I don't care, yeah

That's my-, that's my-
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
That's my-, that's my-
