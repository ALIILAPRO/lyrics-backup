		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So don't sit back and watch the days go by
Are you ever gonna live before you die
And when things fall apart
The world has come undone
Leave it all behind
Leave the loneliness alone
You wait forever blind

So come on and leave the years
When you watched the days go by
Come on and leave the fears
That you were afraid to find
Cause while you wait inside
The days go by

So all the memories fade
And the days go by
Forget the lonely yesterdays in mind
I know it's never gonna be the way you like
I know you don't want to think about the endlessness you find
You wait forever blind

So come on and leave the years
When you watched the days go by
Come on and leave the fears
That you were afraid to find
You're waiting for your time
Waiting for your time
All these days gone wrong
Who broke your fall
What a way to learn

So come on and leave the years
When you watched the days go by
Come on and leave the fears
That you were afraid to find
Time is passing by
Time is passing by

So come on and leave the years
When you watched the days go by
Come on and leave the fears
That you were afraid to find
Cause while you wait inside
The days go by
