		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh woah, woah yeah
Yeah, yes yeah

Angel, oh oh oh
Knew you were special from the moment I saw you (saw you)
I saw you, yeah
I said angel, oh oh oh
I feel you're closer every time I call you (call you)
I call you

'Cause all I see are wings
I can see your wings
But I know what I am and the life I live (life I live)
Yeah, the life I live
And even though I sin
Maybe we are born to live
But I know time will tell if we're meant for this
Yeah if we're meant for this
And if we're not

I hope you find somebody
I hope you find somebody
I hope you find somebody
I hope you find somebody to love (oh), somebody to love (oh)
Somebody to love, yeah, yeah, yeah

Said angel, woah oh oh
You'll probably never take me back and I know this, 
Yeah, I know this, aw man
I said angel, woah oh oh
I'm so desensitized to feeling these emotions (emotions)
Yeah, no emotions baby

'Cause all I see are wings
I can see your wings
But I know what I am and the life I live (life I live)
Yeah, the life I live
And even though I sin
We are born to live
But I know time will tell if we're meant for this
Yeah if we're meant for this
And if we're in need 

I hope you find somebody (ooh)
I hope you find somebody (ooh)
I hope you find somebody (ooh)
I hope you find somebody to love (oh), somebody to love (oh)
Somebody to love, yeah, yeah, yeah

And even though we live inside 
A dangerously empty life
You always seem to bring a light
You always seem to bring a light
And even though we live inside 
A dangerously empty life
You always seem to bring me light
You always seem to bring me light

I hope you find somebody
I hope you find somebody
I hope you find somebody
I hope you find somebody to love (oh)
Somebody to love (somebody to love)
Somebody to love, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh
I hope you find somebody (I hope you find somebody, baby)
I hope you find somebody (woah-ooh, woah-ooh)
I hope you find somebody (I hope you find somebo-)
I hope you find somebody to love (I hope you find somebody to love)
Somebody to love (somebody to love)
Somebody to love (somebody to love), oh)

I hope you find somebody (I hope you find)
I hope you find somebody (I hope you find)
I hope you find somebody (I hope you find somebody, babe)
I hope you find somebody to love (somebody to love)
Somebody to love (oh)
Somebody to love, yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)
