		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mind in the mud, heart in the dust
Haven't felt a thing since the
Last time that I fucked
Talkin' like you average‚ sayin'
You a bad bitch baby we gon' find out‚ lie
Down on this mattress
Bitch I'm fuckin' mad‚ maybe
'cause I'm sad
All of these emotions I don't
Know which one to grab
I can't seem to be, everything you need
Colors changing baby crazy deep
Inside my mood ring, yeah
Think I'm having mood swings‚ yeah
Think I'm having mood swings, yeah
Think I'm having mood swings, yeah
Think I'm having mood swings‚ yeah

Life's a bitch, ain't it?
We holdin' hands and we walk alone
Shit makes me anxious
Like misfit's, bein' stuck at home
This shit is painless
Skin deep to the fuckin' bone
I'm not complainin'
I'm just sayin', Shit's gettin' old
Goin' berserk fucking bitches
He has sour patch kids friends in the dirt
Can't love me now when I'm gettin' rich
So kick him to the curb
See you never, don't write me letters
Blood on my shirt
And It's only gettin' worse

Wait, wait

Mind in the mud, heart in the dust
Haven't felt a thing since the
Last time that I fucked
Talkin' like you average
Sayin' you a bad bitch
Baby we gon' find out
Lie down on this mattress
Bitch I'm fuckin' mad
Maybe 'cause I'm sad
All of these emotions I don't
Know which one to grab
I can't seem to be, everything you need
Colors changing baby crazy deep
Inside my mood ring, yeah
Think I'm having mood swings, yeah
Think I'm having mood swings, yeah
Think I'm having mood swings, yeah
Think I'm having mood swings, yeah
