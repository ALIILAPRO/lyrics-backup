		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I lost my heart
Under the bridge
To that little girl
So much to me
And now I moan
And now I holler
She'll never know
Just what I found
That blue eyed girl (that blue eyed girl)
She said "No more" (she said "No more")
That blue eyed girl (that blue eyed girl)
Became blue eyed whore (became blue eyed whore)
Down by the water (down by the water)
I took her hand (I took her hand)
Just like my daughter (just like my daughter)
I'll see her again (I'll see her again)

Oh help me Jesus
Come through this storm
I had to lose her
To do her harm
I heard her holler (I heard her holler)
I heard her moan (I heard her moan)
My lovely daughter (my lovely daughter)
I took her home (I took her home)

Little fish, big fish, swimming in the water
Come back here, man, gimme my daughter
Little fish, big fish, swimming in the water
Come back here, man, gimme my daughter
Little fish, big fish, swimming in the water
Come back here, man, gimme my daughter
Little fish, big fish, swimming in the water
Come back here, man, gimme my daughter
Little fish, big fish, swimming in the water
Come back here, man, gimme my daughter
Little fish, big fish, swimming in the water
Come back here, man, gimme my daughter
Little fish, big fish, swimming in the water
Come back here, man, gimme my daughter
Little fish, big fish, swimming in the water
Come back here, man, gimme my daughter
Little fish, big fish, swimming in the water
