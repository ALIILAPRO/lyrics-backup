		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She was just another lover to me
(Lover to me) stuck in high school
I was climbing the leagues
(Climbing the leagues)
Now I look inside and I don't know
(And I don't know)
She would never listen, was breaking my heart
(Breaking my heart)
Every time I see her, it would tear me apart
(Tear me apart)
Now I look inside, I just see you
(Just see you)

Take your time, I won't ever leave this home
(Ever leave this home)
Close your eyes, grab my hand
Don't let it go (Woah)

Take me, take me, lullaby baby
Save me, save me, 'bout to go crazy
Tell me, tell me where you've been lately
Go to sleep, my lullaby baby
Say you want me, next day, you hate me
Every day, we go through the same thing
Come here and look at what you made me
Go to sleep, my lullaby baby
Ooh, lullaby baby ooh, my lullaby baby

Haven't felt like this in so long
Know the pain (I know the pain)
You take your life around the
Block, it's gonna change, yeah, yeah
Ain't nobody told me this was really it
(Alright)
She say she never knew him, baby girl
I know you did (I know you did)
But I'm only a kid with just
A mic in my hand i say
"Fuck all the rules" and I
Go poppin' a Xan if it wasn't for her
Then I would still have a plan
If it wasn't for pills
I wouldn't ask her to dance
I didn't tell her to stay, I told her
"Fuck off and leave"
'Cause I don't wanna be seen, no
I don't wanna be seen
All I wanted was girls
I never cared 'bout the world
Feel my skin on your skin
It's like a whole 'nother world
You fuck me up in the head
She crossed my name off in red
But when we got to the doors
The king was already dead
I don't care how you feelin'
If you ain't feelin' right
Now the clothes on the floor
Disappear through the night
City of Angels, that's where I belong
(yeah, yeah) stuck in the past
Why can't you just move on? (Move on)
Slept on me all my life
(yeah, yeah) , my time has come (yeah, yeah)
Sorry, game over, I've already won

Take me, take me, lullaby baby (Baby)
Save me, save me, 'bout to go crazy (Oh)
Tell me, tell me where you've been lately
(Oh)
Go to sleep, my lullaby baby (Let's go)
Say you want me, next day, you hate me
Every day, we go through the same thing
(yeah)
Come here and look at what you made me
Go to sleep, my lullaby baby

Ooh, lullaby baby ooh, my lullaby baby
Yeah, lullaby baby yeah, lullaby baby
