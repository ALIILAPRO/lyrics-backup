Run that back, turbo!

They tryna steal your style, dawg
They tryna steal your style, dawg (style, dawg)
Steady bitin' the sounds (steady bitin' sounds)
They tryna steal the sound, dawg (tryna steal the sound)
You a style stealer, we just ride, nigga (ride)
I'm a big dripper, you a sound stealer (sound stealer)
I make hits, nigga, ask around (ask around)
Feel like Godzilla

Designer to the floor (designer to the floor)
I clean up like a washer (I clean up like a washer)
Flawless choker 'round my throat (choker 'round my throat)
Icy cane like Willy Wonka (icy cane like Willy Wonka)
Said you proud and I was honored (I was honored)
I'm rockin' VVS and pointers (VVS and pointers)
Niggas ain't drippin' like GunWunna (drippin' like GunWunna)
Matchin' CC's with my partner (matchin' CC's with my partner)
I served on the corner, I got birds on my collar
Them done solved all my problems, yeah, I really drip harder (drip harder)
I keep syrup in my bottle (bottle), I get brain from a model (model)
I got green avocado ('cado), drug lord like Pablo (Pablo)

They tryna steal your style, dawg (they tryna steal your style, dawg)
They tryna steal your style, dawg (they tryna steal your style, dawg)
Steady bitin' the sounds (steady bitin' sounds)
They tryna steal the sound, dawg (tryna steal the sound, dawg)
You a style stealer (style stealer), we just ride, nigga (yeah)
I'm a big dripper, you a sound stealer (sound stealer)
I make hits, nigga (hits, nigga), ask around (ask around)
Feel like Godzilla

I got shows and they litty, my hoes and they ready
Like white walls on that caddy, I got sauce like spaghetti (sauce)
I ball like I'm Manny (ball) and my palms sticky, sweaty (sweaty)
Niggas soft like a teddy (teddy), talk like broads you too petty (broads)
Yeah, she call me daddy, yeah, I send the addy (yeah)
She ain't use an Addy (nah), pulled up in a hurry (hurry)
Wrist on the Mcflurry (uh), thirty-ball like Curry (curry)
Had to bag for birdy (birdy), count that cash up early

They tryna steal your style, dawg (style, dawg, style, dawg)
They tryna steal your style, dawg (steal your style, dawg)
Steady bitin' the sounds (steady bitin' sounds)
They tryna steal the sound, dawg (tryna steal the sound)
You a style stealer, we just ride, nigga (ride)
I'm a big dripper, you a sound stealer (sound stealer)
I make hits, nigga, ask around (ask around)
Drip like Godzilla
