		  Heart To Stone
Lyrics & Melodies: Kent Hilli Music: Kent Hilli , Rolf Nordström, Leif Ehlin, Fredrik Forsberg, Mats Byström, P-O Sedin

I'm broken
Just don't know where to start
I'm hollow
I feel i'm torn apart

You don't know just what you've done to us
Can't find my way again
Can't find My way again

You should know that this is breaking me
Cause Every hurt from you is just another day

Close your eyes and you will learn to know
She's turning your heart
She's turning your heart to stone 
no disguise you need to let her go
She's turning your heart
She's turning your heart to stone
No, No,No

Take it
Just take my heart again
Break it
I just don't feel the same

You don't know just what you've done to us 
Don't make me hurt again
Can't make it once again

You should know that this is breaking me
Cause Every hurt from you is just another day

Close your eyes and you will learn to know
She's turning your heart
She's turning your heart to stone 
no disguise you need to let her go
She's turning your heart
She's turning your heart to stone
No, No,No

You should know that this is breaking me
Cause Every hurt from you is just another day

Close your eyes and you will learn to know
She's turning your heart
She's turning your heart to stone 
no disguise you need to let her go
She's turning your heart
She's turning your heart to stone..
Noooooooh, She's turning your heart
She's turning your heart to stone
Noooooooh, She's turning your heart
