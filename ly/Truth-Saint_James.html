		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Asking myself what did I do to deserve this 
What did I do to get your love 
What did I do to get your grace 
After so many times I ran away from you 
Why did I do it 
Why did I do it 

I think it was 
I was scared to hear the truth 
Theres only one way and its you 
Cant go to anyone but you 
Theres only one God its you 
I was scared to hear the truth 
I had to give it all to you 
I was comfortable laying in my chains 
Thought I could do it myself 
Thought I could make a change but 
Its hard for me 
Thinking all the times people went left on me
They did nothing but hurt me 
And its hard for me to keep my mind straight 
In the days where I got nothing but your humbling me 
Ain't got a dollar to my name but 
I got a kingdom to my name and 
I got a God who knows my name 

Asking myself what did I do to deserve this 
What did I do to get your love 
What did I do to get your grace 
After so many times I ran away from you 
Why did I do it 
Why did I do it
