		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Does it teach? Can it learn? Are you sure it's right?
One that's young sees the circled "are", does he buy it?
What the fuck! Can't he buy what he wants to hear?
You muzzle us, we'll muscle you! You'll live in demented fear.

Is it good for us or harmful? Does it enlighten or repress?
Our children need to know what's going on and that our world is a mess.
What the fuck! Can't we say what we think anymore?
Clean up the world, and we'll be singing praises forever more...

chorus: 
Can't you see, you're ripping away our independence,
No one cares but you.
There's never a way to stop the music,
If you're hard on us, we're gonna be hard on you, H.O.Y!
Can't you see, you're ripping away our independence,
No one cares but you.
There's never a way to stop the music,
If you're hard on us, we're gonna be hard on you, H.O.Y!

You say teach the children right, who's to say we're wrong?
If your committee is so damn right, why did we write this song?
What the fuck! Can we write what we feel or not?
You muzzle us, we'll kick your ass! You'll see that we can't be bought!

(repeat chorus)
