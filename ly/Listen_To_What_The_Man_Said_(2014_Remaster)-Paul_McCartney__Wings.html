		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alright, okay
Very good to see you down in New Orleans, man
Yeah, here it is
Yeah, yeah

Any time, any day
You can hear the people say
That love is blind
Well, I don't know but I say love is kind

Do do do, do do do do do
Do do do, do do do do do

Soldier boy kisses girl
Leaves behind a tragic world
But he won't mind, he's in love
And he says love is fine

Do do do, do do do do do
Do do do, do do do do do

Oh yes, indeed we know
That people will find a way to go
No matter what the man said
And love is fine for all we know
For all we know, our love will grow
That's what the man said
So won't you listen to what the man said?
He said

Ah, take it away

Oh yes, indeed we know
That people will find a way to go
No matter what the man said
And love is fine for all we know
For all we know, our love will grow
That's what the man said
So won't you listen to what the man said
He said

Oh yes, indeed we know
That people will find a way to go
No matter what the man said
And love is fine for all we know
For all we know, our love will grow
That's what the man said
So won't you listen to what the man said
He said

The wonder of it all, baby
The wonder of it all, baby
The wonder of it all, baby
Yeah, yeah yeah
Ooh
