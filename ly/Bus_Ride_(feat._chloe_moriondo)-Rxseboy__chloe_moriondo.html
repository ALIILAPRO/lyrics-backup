		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You, do you wanna sit next to me on the bus home?
I told my mama to pick me up today
If that's all right with

Lately life at home has not been something I enjoy
I sit there staring at a wall while mama's breaking all my toys
I haven't seen my dad in weeks, wonder if he's still upstairs
I kinda wanna run away, I wonder if they'll ever care
She drives me straight to school, and doesn't ever say goodbye
It's probably 'cause of all the medicines she takes so she won't cry
Alone at lunch, I need a friend, I'm sick of isolation
Lotta yelling in my head, but I'll still have this conversation with you

Do you wanna sit next to me on the bus home?
I told my mama to pick me up today
If that's all right with

My teachers think that I'm okay, but no, I never feel alright
The glass is breaking on the tile, parents do this every night
I'm smart enough to stop a fight
Not enough to pass my classes
Everybody laughin' at me, you're the one with no reaction
So comfortable with you, that I forget my life at home
I hope my mom doesn't get mad when she decides to check her phone
Told her, "I'm not coming home today"
I'd rather take the bus, with someone who won't ever hurt me
I hope that this is worth it

You, do you wanna sit next to me on the bus home?
I told my mama to pick me up today
If that's all right with

You, do you wanna sit next to me on the bus home?
I told my mama to pick me up today
I hope that that's o-

You, do you wanna sit next to me on the bus home?
I told my mama to pick me up today
I hope that that's okay
