		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now the week is done and everybody's up for some fun
Grab your beer and get your sexy ass in the sun
We are the party people, so raise your fucking glass for your favorite season

Sunshine Baby, this is the time 
When we write the stories that are one of a kind
Let's cherish the time like we just don't care
Every time I touch your body it is love in the air

You are the one that I ever wanted 
You are the one that I ever needed
Take my hand, turn the music on 
So get it on 'cause life is what you make it 

You are the one that I ever wanted 
You are the one that I ever needed
Take my hand, turn the music on 
So get it on 'cause life is what you make it 

Every time I get that feeling inside 
I know my friends are around for a crazy party night
Everything I wish is that tomorrow never comes
Till the sun is rising we will dance to the drums

Sunshine Baby, this is the time 
When we write the stories that are one of a kind
Let's cherish the time like we just don't care
Every time I touch your body it is love in the air

You are the one I ever wanted
You are the one I ever needed
Take my hand, turn the music on
So get it on 'cause life is what you make it 

You are the one I ever wanted
You are the one I ever needed
Take my hand, turn the music on
So get it on 'cause life is what you make it 

This is the time, like a treasure in a chest 
That we keep in our hearts
And tonight, everybody feels alive

We are alive, we are alive
I know that we are alive

You are the one I ever wanted
You are the one I ever needed
You are the one I ever wanted
You are the one I ever needed
Take my hand, turn the music on 
So get it on 'cause life is what you make it

You are the one (you are the one)
You are the one 
We're getting down, down, down
This is our time tonight
