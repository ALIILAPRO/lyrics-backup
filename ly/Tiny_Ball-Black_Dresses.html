		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything's inside a tiny ball
Everything's inside a tiny little ball
Of fear and pain
Everything's inside a tiny ball
Everything's inside a tiny little ball
Of suffering

We all live inside a tiny ball
We all live inside a tiny ball
Of pain and suffering

Inside our tiny little walls

Tiny balls for life hell yeah hell yeah
We all live inside a tiny ball

Stuck inside our tiny little walls

Everything's so tiny and small

Tiny little ball

We all live inside a tiny tiny little ball

I know it sounds stupid for a world like this
People do their best
And still comе off so twisted
Up and so heartless
And I know I'm gratеful if
Someone even tries at all
Still ends crumpled up scrunched up
Like a tossed away love letter but

I think

If there was ever a right way to do it

I think

That nobody's ever even done it

And I know

A Stupid Evil Eye for Perfection

Even though

It's unsuited for a world like this

A tiny little ball tiny little ball
