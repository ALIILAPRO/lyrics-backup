		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Softly I will leave you softly 
For my heart would break if you should wake and see me go
So I leave you softly long before you miss me
Long before your arms can beg me to stay
For one more hour or one more day
After all the years I can't bear the tears to fall so 
Softly, as I leave you there
 
Softly I will leave you softly 
For my heart would break if you should wake and see me go
So I leave you softly long before you miss me
Long before your arms can beg me to stay
For one more hour or one more day
After all the years I can't bear the tears to fall so 
Softly, as I leave you there
