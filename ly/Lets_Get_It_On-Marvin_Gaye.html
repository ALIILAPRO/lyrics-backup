		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been really tryin', baby
Tryin' to hold back this feeling for so long
And if you feel like I feel, baby
Then, c'mon, oh, c'mon, whoa 

Let's get it on
Ah, baby, let's get it on
Let's love, baby
Let's get it on, sugar
Let's get it on, woo hoo

We're all sensitive people
With so much to give
Understand me, sugar (ooh ooh)
Since we've got to be here
Let's live
I love you

There's nothing wrong with me
Loving you, baby no no
And giving yourself to me can never be wrong
If the love is true, oh baby

Ooh don't you know how sweet and wonderful life can be ooh (let me love you)
I'm asking you baby to get it on with me ooh ooh (let me love you)
I ain't gonna worry (let me love you)
I ain't gonna push, won't push you baby (let me love you)
So c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby
Stop beatin' 'round the bush, hey

Let's get it on (ooh ooh)
Let's get it on (ooh ooh)
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
C'mon, baby, hey, hey
Let your love come out
If you believe in love
Let's get it on, ooh
Let's get it on, baby
This minute, oh yeah
Let's get it on
Please, please get it on

I know and you know what I've been dreaming of, don't you baby? (ah, ah, ah, ah)
My whole body makes that feelin' of love, I'm happy (my body wants ya, my body wants ya)
I ain't gonna worry, no I ain't gonna push (ah)
I won't push you baby, woo (ah ah)

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, darlin'
Stop beatin' 'round the bush
Oh, gonna get it on (ooh, ooh)
Threatenin' you, baby (ooh, ooh)
I wanna get it on (ooh, ooh)
You don't have to worry that it's wrong (ooh, ooh)
If the spirit moves ya (ooh, ooh)
Let me groove ya good (ooh, ooh)
Let your love come down (ooh, ooh)
Oh, get it on 

C'mon, baby (ooh, ooh)
Do you know the meaning? (ooh, ooh)
I've been sanctified (ooh, ooh), hey hey
Girl, you give me good feeling (ooh, ooh) (so good)
So good, somethin' like sanctified (ooh, ooh) 

Oh dear I, baby (ooh, ooh) 
Nothing wrong with love (ooh, ooh) 
If you want to love me just let your self go (ooh, ooh) 
Oh baby, let's get it on (ooh, ooh)
