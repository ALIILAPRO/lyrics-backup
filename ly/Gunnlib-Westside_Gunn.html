		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ay yo, street sweepers hanging out the Corniches
Walked on water way before Jesus
Cooked the brick with no stove, pushed the gold Demon
Before I tell Kim twice nigga know the reasons
(Right on the tip of my tongue)
Ay yo, I been locked up about a hundred seasons
Turned two to five, it was pure genius
Saint Laurent jean suit, heard the Margiela screeching
Go to B block you know doc got the seasoning
The pole by the prayer rug, leave it
Now we gonna break fast, Lewis for the remix
Ten o'clock count, we make salat up in Neimans 
Five times a day I did a hundred in a Beemer
(Right on the tip of my tongue)
Didn't hit 'em all but it was close enough
Did it broad day so you know it's us
Going down Bailey in the Maybach
Kicked down the door where the safe at
Didn't hit 'em all but it was close enough
Did it broad day so you know it's us
Going down Bailey in the Maybach
Kicked down the door where the safe at
(Right on the tip of my tongue) FlyGod
Ay yo, it's Savator goin' shopping
We ain't wanna kill him all we wanna do is rob him
Back when Hitler 3 dropped you was in a mountain
On a dance floor, creased Timbs like Louboutins
So yo Jones, let us get the pack through
Need to use the phone, I'ma need a thousand mackerels 
Call now, we was all shackled up from PA
Rockin' Off-White I told a verb it was a DJ
(Right on the tip of my tongue)
Didn't hit 'em all but it was close enough

And I'm, awesome
