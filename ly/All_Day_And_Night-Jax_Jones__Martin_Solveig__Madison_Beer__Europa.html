		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You walked away, you left me out here on the floor
You didn't care, you're still the one that I adore
You gave me something like nobody did before
Whoa, whoa

If I close my eyes, all I see
Is you standing there in front of me
You're on my mind constantly
Now I can't get no sleep

All day and night, you keep me up
Non-stop, I'm so done, yeah
I'm giving you more than enough
Of my love, I'm so done, yeah

I blame myself, I broke my own heart loving you
You cut me up and now I'm bleeding from the truth
You left me helpless, now I don't know what to do
Whoa, whoa

If I close my eyes, all I see
Is you standing there in front of me
You're on my mind constantly
Now I can't get no sleep

All day and night, you keep me up
Non-stop, I'm so done, yeah
I'm giving you more than enough
Of my love, I'm so done, yeah

No sleep, na-na-na-na
No sleep, na-na-na-na
I think about you day and night, now I can't get no
No sleep, na-na-na-na
No sleep, na-na-na-na
I think about you day and night, now I can't get no
No, no, no, no sleep tonight
No, no, no, no sleep tonight

All day and night, you keep me up
Non-stop, I'm so done, yeah
I'm giving you more than enough
Of my love (Of my love), I'm so done (I'm so done), yeah
All day and night, you keep me up
(No sleep, na-na-na-na) Non-stop
(No sleep, na-na-na-na) I'm so done, yeah
(I think about you day and night, now I can't get no)
I'm giving you more than enough
(No sleep, na-na-na-na) Of my love
(No sleep, na-na-na-na) I'm so done, yeah
(I think about you day and night, now I can't get no)
