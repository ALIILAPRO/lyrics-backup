		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, fucked-up in the mind
Yeah, can't let shit slide
I don't think they like my kind
Kill them off it feel divine
Yeah, fucked-up, know I am uh
Made it out the valley of the damned
Bust quick move that's 15 bands
Do what I like, he do what he can, yuh

They ain't never reach these heights
Dropped out school, ain't teach me right
I don't wanna talk, pussy, see me fight
Opposition completely wiped
FUCK
Now I know myself
See my eyes know I been through hell
Know how it feels being bottom of the barrel
Now they can't reach I be staying top shelf
WOAH
Touch down in the city
Yeah I got it on me, yeah I got it with me
Muhfuckas hate my fit, I'm drippy
Muhfuckas hate my face, it's pretty
Count my blessings, every day rebirth
Been in this game, bitch boy do your research
If you coming for the team, better see me first
These lil boys ain't ever been leaders

Yeah, fucked-up in the mind
Yeah, can't let shit slide
I don't think they like my kind
Kill them off it feel divine
Yeah, fucked-up, know I am uh
Made it out the valley of the damned
Bust quick move that's 15 bands
Do what I like, he do what he can, yuh
