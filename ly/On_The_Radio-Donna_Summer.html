		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Someone found a letter you wrote me, on the radio
And they told the world just how you felt
It must have fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat
They never said your name
But I knew just who they meant.

Whoa I was so surprised and shocked, and I wondered, too
If by chance you heard it for yourself
I never told a soul just how I've been feeling over you
But they said it really loud, they said it on the air

On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa oh oh oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh

Now, now
Don't it kinda strike you sad when you hear our song
Things are not the same since we broke up last June
The only thing that I want to hear is that you love me still
And that you think you'll be comin' home real soon

Whoa, oh, yeah, yeah
And it made me feel proud when I heard you say
You couldn't find the words to say it yourself
And now in my heart I know I can say what I really feel
'Cause they said it really loud, they said it on the air

On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa oh oh
On the radio

If you think that love isn't found on the radio
Well tune right in you made find the love you lost
'Cause now I'm sitting here with the man I sent away long ago
It sounded really loud , they said it really loud

On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh
On the radio
