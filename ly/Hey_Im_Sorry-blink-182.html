		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hold me down deep under water
Wave goodbye to all your daughters
Break yourself but why even bother?
Fathers pray for princes instead
Have your fill of disappointment
Two more years of unemployment
All your fears come to life and leave you
Boarded up, abandoned, and spent

Everything you've ever hoped
For waiting there
Outside your front door bleeding to death
Everything you've never wanted here
To seem just like that haunted place
They say for everyone's dying breath

Hey I'm sorry I lost the melody (Whoa ah oh)
Hey I'm sorry I lost your memory (Whoa ah oh)
When we fall asleep I sleep all by myself
At the end of the day

Are you alone with all your thoughts
Your suitcase full of books you bought
The war we fought and all the battles lost
In sought in search exceeding expense

Everything you've ever hoped
For waiting there
Outside your front door bleeding to death
Everything you've never wanted here
To seem just like that haunted place
They say for everyone's dying breath

Hey I'm sorry I lost the melody (Whoa ah oh)
Hey I'm sorry I lost your memory (Whoa ah oh)
When we fall asleep I sleep all by myself
At the end of the day

Whoa ah oh whoa ah oh

Hey, I'm sorry I lost the melody (Whoa ah oh)
Hey, I'm sorry I lost your memory
(Whoa ah oh)

Hey, I'm sorry I lost the melody
Hey I'm sorry I lost your memory
Hey, I'm sorry, mistakes and
Tragedy, hey I'm sorry, give back
What's left of me
When I fall asleep I sleep all by myself
At the end of the day (Whoa ah oh)
At the end of the day (Whoa ah oh)
