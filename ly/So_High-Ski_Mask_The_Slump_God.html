		  (A Lau on this beat)
If it's so, let me know
So high, high

You're so high
Let me know how high
We can go high, high
We can go high, high

We can go high, high
We can soar how high
Let you know how high
If you hit my phone, yeah, yeah
But don't hit my phone, yeah, yeah
Bitch, just leave me 'lone, yeah, yeah
I've been in the zone, yeah, yeah
For the ones that know, yeah, yeah, yeah

If it's so, let me know
If it's so, let me know
If it's so, let me know
If it's so

You're so high
Let me know how high
We can go high, high
We can go high, high

We can go high, high
We can soar how high
Let you know how high
If you hit my phone, yeah, yeah
But don't hit my phone, yeah, yeah
Bitch, just leave me 'lone, yeah, yeah
I've been in the zone, yeah, yeah
For the ones that know, yeah, yeah, yeah

Let me know
Let me know
Let me know
