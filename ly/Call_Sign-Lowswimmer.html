		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heard your call sign, LAG's enough
Looked appalled like everything I touch
Didn't fuck up empathy's a long line
Join me will you, sometime, here?

Had the highlights scalped by everyone
Screened the calls like gravity hung up
And at the lunch you held me by the jawline
And everything was alright then
A sucker for a joyride
Misery's a goldmine, and man

You had to be there then
You had to be there when it last looked up
You had to bе there when wе tied it up
To be given a lack-thereof
To be there when the silence stopped
To be there then was not enough
