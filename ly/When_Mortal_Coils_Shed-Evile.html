		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once more a longer day
I recall the void remains
A void that forever stays
They say that time heals well
Yet a wound fixed open dwells
A wound that forever tells
Now the sorrow takes me
Will tomorrow save me
From the day burned in my mind?
How can I journey on when no road lies ahead?
How can I carry on when mortal coils shed?
In dreams return again
Rekindling of hope, my friend
But reality rears its head
Wish for the chance to say
Goodbye' before away
Away before better days
Now the sorrow takes me
Will tomorrow save me
From the day burned in my mind?
How can I journey on when no road lies ahead?
How can I carry on when mortal coils shed?
All I see is your face beckoning
Face of old who we lost reveling
All I feel is the pain, harrowing
That day burned in mind
Take me back to the time you were here
Days of old we could all disappear
Tell me why you had to leave
When mortal coils shed
How can I journey on when no road lies ahead?
How can I carry on when mortal coils shed?
Now the sorrow takes me
Will tomorrow save me?
Darkened hold, restrain me
Will tomorrow save me
From the day burned in my mind?
That day burned in my mind
