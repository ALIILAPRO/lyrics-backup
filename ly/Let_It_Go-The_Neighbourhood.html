		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm from a little city with expensive taste
Where the cars don't run until the engine breaks
Wasn't spending pennies on massive things
But invested in mess with this recipe
Couldn't quite see what the future held
And as days went by it would tell itself
Let it struggle just a little bit more
Let it struggle just a little bit more

Remember what the people said
Remember what the people said
When it's said and done, let it go

Remember what the people said
Remember what the people said
When it's said and done, let it go

Shouldn't try to fix it if it keeps getting better
Just let it go, forget it for ever and ever and ever
Don't ever resent a letter inside a single word written
A little change can play lanes with the right vision
Couldn't tell what would happen next
But as weeks went by look what turned to best
Let it struggle just a little more
Let it struggle just a little bit more, mm hm

Remember what the people said
Remember what the people said
When it's said and done, let it go

Remember what the people said
Remember what the people said
When it's said and done, let it go

If what they said was all pretend then it'd be different
If it depended on if anyone was listening
And I was listening
And when they said that what I wanted was a figment
I had to turn the other cheek but I was listening
Yeah I was listening, listening to all

Remember what the people said
Remember what the people said
When it's said and done, let it go

Remember what the people said
Remember what the people said
When it's said and done, let it go

Remember what the people said
Remember what the people said
I wasn't listening
I wasn't listening, listening at all

Remember what the people said
Remember what the people said
Oh I wasn't listening
I wasn't listening, listening at all (at all at all at all )

At all, at all
