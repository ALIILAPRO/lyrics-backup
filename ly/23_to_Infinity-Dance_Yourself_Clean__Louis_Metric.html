		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  20 over on the coast in Malibu
Go baby, I'm proud you
Never guessed I'd see this side of you
Mm mm mm

23 to infinity
There's no putting out the fire I found in you
Never let em know what we about to do
Mm (never let â€˜em know)

They say we're only young once, so I'm counting on you
It's like I took a dive in the fountain of youth 
cnytime I'm with you

Gold light on the waves, my arms around you
Sipping diet coke from a champagne flute
Told you one day we were gonna break through

We on a speedway
Out to the endless mile
They'll never catch us
I think it's just us now
I think it's just us now

There you go, heart of gold and a devil mind
Go baby, you mesmerize me
That you smile you got could be weaponized
Mm mm mm

23 to the end of time
Like a summer heat burning through the dead of night
I gotta love for you, baby, that'll never die

They say we're only young once, so I'm counting on you
It's like I took a dive in the fountain of youth 
cnytime I'm with you

Gold light on the waves, my arms around you
Sipping diet coke from a champagne flute
Told you one day we were gonna break through

We on a speedway
Out to the endless mile
They'll never catch us
I think it's just us now
I think it's just us now

Drive drive drive
Through the middle of the night
Like a rogue satellite running off it's course
To infinity

Drive drive drive
Underneath the moonlight
Like a rogue satellite knocking on the door
To infinity

In the night air
We can disappear
While the day light dies in the side mirror
We stay here
cs the
Light years
Pass on by 
I'll be here
By your side baby
In the night air
We can disappear
While the day light dies in the side mirror
We stay here
cs the
Light years
Pass on by 

We on a speedway
Out to the endless mile
They'll never catch us
I think it's just us now
I think it's just us now

Drive drive drive
Through the middle of the night
Like a rogue satellite running off it's course
To infinity

Drive drive drive
Underneath the moonlight
Like a rogue satellite knocking on the door
To infinity
