		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And we could run away 
Before the light of day 
You know we always could 
The mountains say, the mountains say

And we could run away 
Before the light of day 
You know we always could 
The mountains say, the mountains say

And we could run away 
Before the light of day 
You know we always could 
The mountains say, the mountains say

And we could run away 
Before the light of day 
You know we always could 
The mountains say, the mountains say

And we could run away 
Before the light of day 
You know we always could 
The mountains say, the mountains say
