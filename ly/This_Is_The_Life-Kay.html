		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Boom boom boom all I need is the base
Louder louder louder put your hands around my waist
Pumpin pumpin pumpin my hearts like an 808 
Pumpin (x3) speakers jumpin out of place
Jumpin out of place
*repeat*
Retched 
We're moving through the crowd
This music is so loud
I only want to see the lights I want to see the lights 
Cause tonight this is the life
Retched 

Retched
It's sad to say......,,?
Boom boom boom all I need is the base 
Louder louder put your hands around my waist 
Pumpin x3 my hearts like an 808 
Pumpin x3 speakers jumpin out of place  
Retched 
It's time to make a move
'Cause we got nothing to lose
Retched 
Retched
