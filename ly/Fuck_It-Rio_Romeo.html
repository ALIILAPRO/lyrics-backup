		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Welcome to the best day of your life
I think I've found a way to ease your strife
Before you turn and walk away
This is how you ease your pain
Just say fuck it
And move on
Listen to my happy little song
Just say fuck it
And come through
Sing along to my happy tune
Fuck off
Fuck this
Fuck you
Real quick
Now you know my witty little trick
Tell your friends and family real quick
And if they disagree with my world view
Tell them they can go fuck themselves too
Just say fuck it
And move on
Listen to my happy little song
Just say fuck it
And come through
Sing along to my happy tune
Fuck off
Fuck this
Fuck you
Real quick
Fuck off
Fuck this
Fuck you
Real quick
Fuck off
Fuck this
Fuck you
Real quick
Fuck off
Fuck this
Fuck you
Real quick
Nice!
