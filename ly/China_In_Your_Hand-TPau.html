		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was a theme she had on a scheme he had
Told in a foreign land
To take life on earth to the second birth
And the man was in command
It was a flight on the wings of a young girl's dreams
That flew too far away

Don't push too far your dreams are china in your hand
Don't wish too hard, because they may come true
And you can't help them
You don't know what you might have set upon yourself
China in your hand

Come from greed never born of the seed
Took a life from a barren hand
Oh, eyes wide like a child in the form of man
A prophecy for a fantasy
The curse of a vivid mind

Don't push too far your dreams are china in your hand
Don't wish too hard, because they may come true
And you can't help them
You don't know what you might have set upon yourself
China in your hand
Whoa, your hand
Your hand

Don't push too far your dreams are china in your hand
Don't wish too hard, because they may come true
And you can't help them
You don't know what you might have set upon yourself
But you shouldn't push too hard no, no

Don't push too far your dreams are china in your hand
Don't wish too hard, because they may come true 
And you can't help them
You don't know what you might have set upon yourself
Because they're only dreams
And you shouldn't push too hard no no
