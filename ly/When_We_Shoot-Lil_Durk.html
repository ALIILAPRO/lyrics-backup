		  (Turn Me Up Josh)
(Young Cutta run it up)

I be with demons, and yeah, I admit it
Get too high, gotta flush my kidneys
Niggas be hoes, gotta mind my business
Call from the feds, they'll run up your minutes
Watch these hoes, they'll do it for a image
Fuck four hoes, tryna turn me a stripper
I don't trust niggas, so I ride with my nickel
Crushed up faces, bustdown emerald
Can't trust twice 'cause it ain't that simple
Ten toes down, I'll ride for my niggas
When you ride through the 'Raq, gotta look at it through mirrors
He got caught 'cause I know he didn't
You know damn well you can't duck them switches
You gotta shoot forward 'cause that bitch be glitchy
I miss my dawg, gotta stay out my feelings
Miss my dawg, gotta stay out my, yeah
Love my block and I love my city, we call hoes eats
Wake up late, mouth 50K, better brush your teeth
I'ma say no when the nigga ask, I know he a leech
Contract with the label, bitch, I'm able, I'm signed to the streets
We ain't no goofies and I told Doodie them pills be havin' me nervous
Nigga had shot my brother, when it come to the money, my shawty be constantly purgin'
Fuck my opps, we on his ass, catch 'em, blast, nobody nervous
We on his ass, ain't no pass, foenem do him dirty
I'm with the killers and I be comfortable 'round them gangsters
I'm with the robbers and I be comfortable 'round them gangsters
I give him a thirty, he pop out the car, he gettin' too anxious
I'on't give him no X when he got his gat 'cause shorty too dangerous

And you can't run when we shoot
You can't run when we shoot
You can't run when we shoot
And you can't run when we shoot

You better not slip, you better not trip
Come out the cut and blick
Them hoes left quick when I wasn't lit
Now them hoes be on my dick
I'm from the Lam', fuck 63rd, but that don't go for Hyp
I'ma get that Lam' truck blue for sixty days, that shit for Nip
And I don't even cheat on my bitch
Them bitches be tweetin' like, "Lil Durk be cheatin'" 
Like bitches don't be on my dick
Why you be sneakin' and dissin' and pillowin'-talkin' 
When you with a bitch?
It be the niggas I used to call brother 
I call 'em and tell 'em, "Let's get it"
Better ride with your blick, yeah

And you can't run when we shoot
You can't run when we shoot
You can't run when we shoot
And you can't run when we shoot
And you can't run when we shoot
You can't run when we shoot
You can't run when we shoot
And you can't run when we shoot
