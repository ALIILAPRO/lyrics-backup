		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been a minute since we met
But I still think you're out of my league
I could never understand how
Someone like you would love somebody like me

I don't know why you put me first
Introduced me to my worth
Showed me how to love myself
Make me feel like there's nobody else
You say it's all a part of love
That we don't ever need to rush
See it's supposed to be easy 
And I know that I'll always be keeping you close, yeah

I'm feeling like I'm always dreaming
I don't know how you're just my type
Do what you're doing I can't get enough
I'll try to measure up, yeah

It's been a minute since we met
But I still think you're out of my league
I could never understand how
Someone like you would love somebody like me

Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

And I don't wanna leave this bed
My heart is beating out my chest
Something I never asked for
You give it all and you give more, yeah

I'm feeling like I'm always dreaming
I don't know how you're just my type
Do what you're doing I can't get enough
I'll try to measure up, yeah, yeah, yeah

It's been a minute since we met
But I still think you're out of my league, yeah
I could never understand how
Someone like you would love somebody like me

You could be with someone else
But you still wanna follow my lead, yeah
I could never understand how
Someone like you would love somebody like me

Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Someone like you
Someone like you, yeah, yeah

Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

It's been a minute since we met
But I still think you're out of my league, yeah
I could never understand how
Someone like you would love somebody like me

It's been a minute since we met
But I still think you're out of my league, yeah
I could never understand how
Someone like you would love somebody like me (love, love, love, love, love)

You could be with someone else
But you still wanna follow my lead, yeah (no-no-no)
I could never understand how (no-no-no-no)
Someone like you would love somebody like me
