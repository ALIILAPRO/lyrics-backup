		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I used to dream every night, now I never dream at all
I'm hopin' that it's 'cause I'm livin' everythin' I want
I used to wake up in a bed between my mom and aunt
Playin' with this Land Before Time toy from Pizza Hut
My dad works nights, puttin' on a stone face
He's savin' up so we can get our own place
In the projects, man that sounds fancy to me
They called me "fat nose," my mom say, "You handsome to me"
Mrs. Glover ma'am, your son is so advanced
But he's actin' up in class and keeps peein' in his pants
And I just wanna fit in, but nobody was helpin' me out
They talkin' hood shit and I ain't know what that was about
'Cause hood shit and black shit is super different
So I'm talkin' hood shit and cool it now like New Edition
Mom and dad wouldn't listen
They left the Bronx so I wouldn't be that
All their friends in NY deal crack
It's weird, you think that they'd be proud of 'em
But when you leave the hood
They think that you look down on 'em
The truth is we still struggle on a different plane
Seven dollars an hour, WIC vouchers, it's all the same
Facebook messagin' hopin' that could patch up shit
But all they get now is, "Can your son read this script?"

There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside, we can follow the road
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside, no one knows
There's a world, there's a world if we go outside
Outside, outside, we can follow the road
There's a world, there's a world if we go outside
Outside, outside, no one knows

Yeah
Dad lost his job, mama worked at Mrs. Winner's
Gun pulled in her face, she still made dinner
"Donald watch the meter so they don't turn the lights off"
Workin' two jobs so I can get into that white school
And I hate it there
They all make fun of my clothes and wanna touch my hair
And my uncle on that stuff that got my grandma shook
Drug dealers roughed him up and stole his address book
He's supposed to pay 'em back
He owe 'em money but his bank account is zero
So my momma made us sleep with Phillips heads under the pillow
Like that would do somethin'
But she's got six kids, she's gotta do somethin'
She don't want me in a lifestyle like my cousin
And he mad 'cause his father ain't around
He lookin' at me now, like
"Why you so fuckin' lucky? I had a father too
But he ain't around so I'ma take it out on you"
We used to say, "I love you," now we only think that shit
It feels weird that you're the person I took sink baths with
Street took you over, I want my cousin back
The world sayin' what you are
Because you're young and black, don't believe 'em
You're still that kid who kept the older boys
From teasin', for some reason

There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside, we can follow the road
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside, no one knows
There's a world, there's a world if we go outside
Outside, outside, we can follow the road
There's a world, there's a world if we go outside
Outside, outside, no one knows

Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Oh, help us, Lord
Oh, I'm screamin' baby, baby
