		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We are the misguided youth
They've backed us into a corner
All our lives we've been infected
They should have never had a chance

Because they're forcing us
To believe
In a world that we shouldn't trust
Delete, rewind and try to change this
State of mind

Give us something to believe in
Give us something to make our own
Give us something to believe in
Give us something to make our own

When will we stand up
And choose our paths

This is the end of the world
At least that's what we're told
This is the end of the world
Board up the windows
And lock your doors

Turn out the lights
Turn out the lights

This is getting old

We are the misguided youth
We sat back and lost our voices

Delete, rewind and try to change this
State of mind
Delete, rewind and try to change this
State of mind

Because they're forcing us
To believe
In a world that we shouldn't trust
Delete, rewind and try to change this
State of mind
And hopefully you knew it all
You knew it all along

Delete, rewind
Delete, rewind

When will we stand up 
We've been through enough
When will we stand up
Have we let them take the best of us
