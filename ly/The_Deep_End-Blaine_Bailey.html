		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well all the ways I was shown
You've never seen in your home
I'm just an okie man with the Cherokee blood
And you're a Texas gal with hair like the sun
Now let me tell you what you don't understand
We come from nothin but a house on the sand
And us poor boys sure have poor ways
I'm gonna make you sit and wonder nearly everyday
But I'm so happy that your path crossed mine
Lord knows I can get out of line
But you're the drug I use to level my head
I know I'm bound for the ruins in this life I've led
So I'll go to the end
Just to show you the love within
This ol broken heart of mine
That you've mended over time
When you held me close
As I was going off the deep end
And you're the light I see in the dark
And like a thief you run away with my heart
Making me lose touch with reality
Cause all I see is you and your beauty
And those eyes they can cast a spell
And me I know all too well
Time will kill me but so do you
Every time I take a look in those baby blues
So I'll go to the end
Just to show you the love within
This ol broken heart of mine
That you've mended over time
When you held me close
As I was going off the deep end
So I'll go to the end
Just to show you the love within
This ol broken heart of mine
That you've mended over time
When you held me close
As I was going off the deep end
