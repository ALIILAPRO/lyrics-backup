		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  True lovers never take it slowly
When they've found the one and only
Nothing can replace this feeling
Knowing someone loves you

It's painted with the pain and glory
Taking from a known sad story
Laying out my life before me
Fearing the unknown

Sharing never showed me much appeal
And now I'm only praying it's for real

So how does it feel 
When I hold you in my arms
And you're lying next to me 
Never wanting you to leave 
Until I'll tell you how it feels
To be cradled like my dreams
And to know that you love me
No more wasting time in asking other people
How does it feel

How does it feel

Forever taken you for granted
You give me everything I wanted 
I'm so afraid that I might lose you
But time will let us see
If everything is real I'm feeling
Well maybe we've been only dreaming
And if it's gonna die to save it
'cause baby I believe

Nothing in the world could make it right
'cause baby loving you brings me to life

And how does it feel 
When I hold you in my arms
And you're lying next to me 
Never wanting you to leave 
Until I'll tell you how it feels
To be cradled like my dreams
And to know that you love me
No more wasting time in asking other people
How does it feel

Whoa, whoa, whoa

Nothing in the world could feel this right
'cause baby you're the best thing in my life

How does it feel 
When I hold you in my arms
And you're lying next to me 
Never wanting you to leave 
Until I'll tell you how it feels
To be cradled like my dreams
And to know that you love me
No more wasting time in asking other people

How does it feel
