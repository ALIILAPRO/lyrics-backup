		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You put baby in the corner
You're so cruel
I think you like to see me suffer
And be a fool for you
I don't know what to do

There must be something in the water
That keeps pulling me under
But I don't wanna drown
No I don't wanna drown

You're poisonous
But I keep needing more of it
It tastes so good so good
A double edged sword
Your desire is torturous
Why my on board to be yours

Like ya

I know I know
I can't take much more
More

There must be something in the water
That keeps pulling me under
But I don't wanna drown
No I don't wanna drown
Oh
There something in, there something in the water
Ah
There something in, there something in the water

Rock like a wave
Dangerous for me
But your siren call my favorite melody
Rock like a wave
Dangerous for me
Cause your siren call

There must be something in the water
That keeps pulling me under
But I don't wanna drown
No I don't wanna drown
Oh
There something in, there something in the water
Ah
There something in, there something in the water
