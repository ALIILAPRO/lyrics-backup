		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Glowin' up kind of love
Dip and slide through the cut
Glowin' up kind of love
We say "Hi," you say "What?"

Ooh-hoo ooh
Ooh-hoo ooh
Oh

Used to care what they'd say
Let 'em into my brain
But I found a new way
Ooh-hoo
Every time I fall down
I pick it up like rebound
Gotta get through somehow

We don't fly like we used to
We take what we've been through
And we can feel brand new
Ooh-hoo-hoo
I know I am a fighter
I feel the fire
I'm shining brighter
Ooh-hoo-hoo

We got the light
We're coming in stronger
We're in it together
If you want it, it's all inside your mind
We got the light
Won't wait any longer
We'll get it together
If you want it then you can paint the sky

Glowin' up kind of love
Dip and slide through the cut
Glowin' up kind of love
We say "Hi," you say "What?"

Glowin' up kind of love
Dip and slide through the cut
Glowin' up kind of love
We say "Hi," you say "What?"

Everywhere that I've been
Yeah, they I'm say different
But I'm good in my skin
Ooh-hoo, hey
If it doesn't feel right
Break it in with tie-dye
And don't you stop 'til sunrise

We don't fly like we used to
We take what we've been through
And we can feel brand new
Ooh-hoo-hoo
I know I am a fighter
I feel the fire
I'm shining brighter
Ooh-hoo-hoo

We got the light
We're coming in stronger
We're in it together
If you want it, it's all inside your mind (inside your mind, yeah)
We got the light
Won't wait any longer
We'll get it together
If you want it then you can paint the sky (hey)

Glowin' up kind of love
Dip and slide through the cut
Glowin' up kind of love
We say "Hi," you say "What"

Glowin' up kind of love (oh)
Dip and slide through the cut (oh)
Glowin' up kind of love
We say "Hi," you say "What?"

(Ooh-hoo ooh) we got the kind of
(Ooh-hoo ooh) we got the kind of love
Ooh-hoo-hoo

We got the light (ooh-hoo ooh)
We got the kind of (ooh-hoo ooh)
We got the kind of love (ooh, ooh, ooh)
We got the light

Glowin' up kind of love
Dip and slide through the cut
Glowin' up kind of love
We say "Hi," you say "What?"

Glowin' up kind of love (ooh-hoo ooh) (we got the kind of) 
Dip and slide through the cut (ooh-hoo ooh) (we got the kind of love)
Glowin' up kind of love
We say "Hi"

We got the light
