		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Machinery, catharsis, technology
Rag-tag, transcendent, slapstick
Try-hard, high-strung, neurotic
Blue-crossed, golden arches, pearly gates
Supermarket, interstate, picket fence
Domestic, citizen's arrest
Vestibule, two-story
Gas station, phantom pain
Art therapist, eggshell white, office party
Parking garage, Molly, retail, micropolitan
Private property, killing point, agenda
Arms, body, legs, flesh, skin, bone, sinew
Good luck
Arms, body, legs, flesh, skin, bone, sinew
Good luck
Arms, body, legs, flesh, skin, bone, sinew
(Good luck)

Arms, body, legs, flesh, skin, bone, sinew
Good luck
Arms, body, legs, flesh, skin, bone, sinew
Good luck
Arms, body, legs, flesh, skin, bone, sinew
Good luck
Arms, body, legs, flesh, skin, bone, sinew
Good luck

I've done the questionnaire like seven hundred times
To get the same results as my friend, huh
We've been inseparable since 2009
She just doesn't know about it yet
(Can you feel it?)

Arms, body, legs, flesh, skin, bone, sinew
Good luck (Can you feel it?)
Arms, body, legs, flesh, skin, bone, sinew
Good luck (Can you feel it?)
Arms, body, legs, flesh, skin, bone, sinew
Good luck (Can you feel it?)
Arms, body, legs, flesh, skin, bone, sinew
Good luck

I've done the questionnaire, like, never in my life
But I've got a ten-foot pole, huh
And if I could I'd poke her with it right between her eyes
May God rest her soul
(Can you feel?)

Arms, body, legs, flesh, skin, bone, sinew
Can you feel?
Arms, body, legs, flesh, skin, bone, sinew
Can you feel?
Arms, body, legs, flesh, skin, bone, sinew
Can you feel? Can you feel?
Arms, body, legs
Can you feel?
(Come on and touch me, oh)

(Stop me if you've heard this one before)
(Girls like us are rotten to the core) (Let's go)
Stop me if you've heard this one before
Girls like us are rotten to the core

Stop me if you've heard this one before
Girls like us are rotten to the core
Stop me if you've heard this one before
Girls like us are rotten to the core (can you feel?)
Stop me if you've heard this one before (can you feel?)
Girls like us are rotten to the core (can you feel?)
Stop me if you've heard this one before (can you feel?)
Stop me if my mom gets off her horse
(Touch me)

Arms, body, legs, flesh, skin, bone, sinew
Arms, body, legs, flesh, skin, bone, sinew
(Everyone's a critic)
Arms, body, legs, flesh, skin, bone, sinew
(Everything is business)
Arms, body, legs, flesh, skin, bone, sinew

Man, he wiggles when he walks
And he wanted it to stop because
His superficial smile, it got everybody up
The band is playing him out, boys are talking signs
I started laughing with the locals (and went back around)
Yeah, the horse I like is whack, she can't run very fast
She's always had my back, I bet my bottom dollar
And I bet my britches off, can you get me back on track? (What?)
I started laughing with the locals!

(Can you feel?)
Stop me if you've heard this one before (can you feel?)
Girls like us are rotten to the core (can you feel?)
Stop me if you've heard this one before (can you feel, can you feel?)
Girls like us are rotten to the core (can you feel, can you feel?)
Stop me if you've heard this one before (can you feel?)
Girls like us are rotten to the core (can you feel?)
Stop me if you've heard this one before (can you feel, can you feel?)
Stop take life, the song is over, turn around (can you feel?)

Baby, I'm delusional, practical is control
Hm, it's the talk of the town, it's the talk of the town
Baby, I'm delusional, practical is control
Hm, it's the talk of the town, it's the talk, talk, talk
Baby, I'm delusional, practical is control
Hm, it's the talk of the town, it's the talk of the town
Baby, I'm delusional, practical is control
Hm, it's the talk of the town, it's the talk of the town
