		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it your bedtime yet? (Yeah)
Did you forget to turn the lights off again? (Yeah, yeah)
Was it something I said that kept you up in your head
That made the shadows grow teeth and take away your sleep

Are you afraid of the dark? (No)
Did you forget to check a lock on the door? (What? Twice)
Was it a creak in the floor that kept you under the covers
And never call for your mother and made you run for your life?

You know I came to save the day
And up until this day my claws
Are coming out

I got my cape on, like superheroes do
About to take off out into the blue
I'm always on time, never gonna lose
You know I won't stop coming after you

(Na-na-na-na-na-na) you know I won't stop
(Na-na-na-na-na-na) coming after you

Is there anyone there? (No)
Did I forget there was only one chair? (Yeah, yeah)
Was it easy enough when it was just you and us
But now the voice outside kinda sounds like you

You know I came to save the day
And up until this day my claws
Are coming out

I got my cape on, like superheroes do
About to take off out into the blue
I'm always on time, never gonna lose
You know I won't stop coming after you

(Na-na-na-na-na-na) coming after you
(Na-na-na-na-na-na) coming after you
(Na-na-na-na-na-na) you know I won't stop
Coming after you

Don't be scared of them, they'll be scared of you
Monsters in your head don't tell you what to do
Don't be scared of them, they'll be scared of you
Monsters in your head don't tell you what to do

I got my cape on, like superheroes do
About to take off out into the blue
I'm always on time, never gonna lose
You know I won't stop coming after you

(Na-na-na-na-na-na) I'm coming after you
(Na-na-na-na-na-na) I'm coming after you
(Na-na-na-na-na-na) you know I won't stop
Coming after you
