		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

I'm from the Bronx, not Benny
I swear I don't even know why I did it
AP cost a hunnid and fifty
I be feeling like I'm drowning with it (drowning with it)
(If you tryna ride the wave)
(You should be afraid that you don't drown in it)
(I be feeling like the king of my city)
(From the Bronx, not Benny yeah, yeah)

500K that's just on the Richie
My nigga you don't wanna play with my city
Niggas die everyday in my city
Whole lotta young, wild niggas
(If you tryna ride the wave)
(You should be afraid that you might drown in it)
I be feeling like the king of my city
And every nigga with me wearing Amiri

Headshot like pow, nigga
Headshot like pow, nigga
Hit him twice make sure you don't miss him
Them bullets in this pistol look like a missile
Headshot like pow, nigga
Hit 'em up, man down, nigga
Send a nigga on a motherfucking mission
It's fucked up, yeah I know they gone miss him
I am not with it, yeah
Try to play with me you might end up missing
VVS's Elliot, not Missy
Sorry miss, these Elliot VVS's
Long johns on just for the crills
Long johns on, crill tuckin'
If you gotta pay the bills fuck it
West side nigga, from the Bronx, yeah
Throw it up like LeBron, yeah
Thirty rounds on a hundred FN's
All my guys came with the shits
And they might get to bussin', yeah
If I like your necklace, yeah
Those guys might take off your necklace
Fuck a fight I ain't with the Tekken
Those guys might want you to check in

I'm from the Bronx, not Benny
I swear I don't even know why I did it
AP cost a hunnid and fifty
(I be feeling like I'm drowning with it)
If you tryna ride the wave
You should be afraid that you don't drown in it
I be feeling like the king of my city
From the Bronx, not Benny yeah, yeah

500K that's just on the Richie
My nigga you don't wanna play with my city
Niggas die everyday in my city
Whole lotta young, wild niggas
If you tryna ride the wave
You should be afraid that you might drown in it
I be feeling like the king of my city
And every nigga with me wearing Amiri
