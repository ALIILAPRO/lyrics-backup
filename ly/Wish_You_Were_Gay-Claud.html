		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Picture this you and me in the morning 
kissing over the coffee you're pouring 
It could be like that every day
hate it that I wish you were

Hoping that I'm a better replacement
for the guys that you're always out chasing
or should I accept things I can't change
hate it that I wish you were

I wish you were gay
so you could just hold me
Call me your babe
instead of your homie  

Don't know what to say
but I wish you were gay

I wish you were gay
so it would be easy
For me to say that
I'm catching feelings 

And I know you're straight
but I wish you were gay 

Now I see you get off of the subway 
haven't seen you in months but it's ok
I'd forgotten but I feel the same
hate that I still wish you were

You walk up and i'm dreading the small talk
with your boyfriend he's chatting my ear off
So I lie and I say I can't stay
hate it I still wish you were

I wish you were gay
so you could just hold me
Call me your babe
instead of your homie  

Don't know what to say
but I wish you were gay

I wish you were gay
so it would be easy
For me to say that
I'm catching feelings 

And I know you're straight
but I wish you were gay

We'd be so good
give me one look
I know you don't mean it when you come to flirt
the dreams that I'm having are just getting worse

I wish you were gay
so you could just hold me
Call me your babe
instead of your homie  

Don't know what to say
but I wish you were gay

I wish you were gay
so it would be easy
For me to say that
I'm catching feelings 

And I know you're straight
but I wish you were gay

I won't trade four roses for your heart 
I won't wait forever in the dark
