		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a song which has no words
It dwells deep inside my hands

There's a place where we belong
It melts between these notes

Don't cry my little boy
We've been there before
Don't be afraid my love
We've been there so many times

There's a song that never ends
Falls down my spine
cgain and again

There's a place
That we'll call home
cnd dance, dance
Till first birds come

Don't cry my little boy
We've been there before
Don't be afraid my love
We've been there so many times
