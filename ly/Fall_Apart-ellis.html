		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Secrets whispered in my ear
All the words I've been dying to hear from you
Listening to my favorite songs
Under the covers we hum along

Lean in, but don't look too close
There are things I don't want you to know
And please
Don't watch me
Unraveling

And now you see me on my bad days
Falling back into my old ways
Spinning in circles in a black haze
I didn't mean to fall apart
I didn't mean to fall apart

Fly high, then sink so deep
These feelings bring out the worst in me
Thought I had it under control
But when it happens it swallows me whole

Get out 
But don't walk away
When you see what a mess I have made
And you
You're watching me
Unraveling

And now you see me on my bad days
Falling back into my old ways
Spinning in circles in a black haze
I didn't mean to fall apart
I didn't mean to
On my worst days

Falling back into my old ways
Spinning in circles on the drive way
I didn't mean to fall apart
I didn't mean to fall
