		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's the evening light
Shining through the curtains
The time before the night
When everything is golden
You're sitting on the chair
Wrapped inside a bedsheet
Playing with your hair
Watching people on the high street
If I wished myself a superpower
I would make this moment last for hours
If I had my will, time would just stand still
Wait for me until I find some magic film
To take a photograph and live inside
The sun is going down
Your skin is like a painting
The light is perfect now
But I can feel it changing
Kids are probably soon
Don't get me wrong, I'm ready
But will I know what to do
When we're no longer two
When us means more than me and you
If I wished myself a superpower
I would make this moment last for hours
If I had my will, time would just stand still
Wait for me until I find some magic film
To take a photograph and live inside
I need some way to prove that this was real
A memory is not enough
I'm scared that I'll forget the way it feels
To be young and in love
Let me stay right here
Just a moment longer
The picture is so clear
Please let this last forever
