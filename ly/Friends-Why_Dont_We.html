		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Friday night, nothin' on
And now I got all of my friends tryna call my phone
And I'm feelin' like I wanna get in my zone
So let me know, let me know, let me know if the party's on

'Cause your friend's daddy got a real big house
Real big house, real big house
Heard they gone away, we can all hang out
All hang out 'til Monday
My friend Freddie got a real fast car
Real fast car, real fast car
Won't take long 'cause it ain't that far, ain't that far

All we want, is a little place that we can
All have fun, and I swear I won't break a thing
All we want, is a little place where we can dance
I know you understand
Let me know it's on and I'll bring my friends
I can introduce them to all your friends
If they get along, we can all be friends
Or I could come alone, just me, you, on our own

And I know they look like they get up to no good
But they ain't nothin' but a lot of fun once you get to know
And I can cook, yeah, you won't even have to do a thing
Tell me what you wanna drink and I'll bring a couple things along

'Cause your friend's daddy got a real big house
Real big house, real big house
Heard they gone away, we can all hang out
All hang out 'til Monday
My friend Freddie got a real fast car
Real fast car, real fast car
Won't take long 'cause it ain't that far, ain't that far

All we want, is a little place that we can
All have fun, and I swear I won't break a thing
All we want, is a little place where we can dance
I know you understand
Let me know it's on and I'll bring my friends
I can introduce them to all your friends
If they get along, we can all be friends
Or I could come alone, just me, you, on our own

Oh, oh, oh, my friends are your friends
Oh, oh, oh, and I swear I won't break a thing
Oh, oh, oh, my friends are your friends

Let me know it's on and I'll bring my friends
I can introduce them to all your friends
If they get along, we can all be friends
Or I could come alone, just me, you, on our own
