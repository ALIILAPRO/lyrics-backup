		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sit there thinking in your room
You feel the pressure
You're goin' crazy too
The walls around you closin' in
You need a change

Claustrophobic feeling scared
You need somebody
But no one seems to care
A one way ticket, a change of pace
You've had enough
Can't take no more

Breaking the chains around you
Nobody else can bind you
Take a good look around you
Now you're breaking the chains

Got this letter, came today
From my baby who left me yesterday
Said she loves me, she'll come back
She wants to try

I won't let her, she'll be upset
I know it's better than something I'll regret
She's been dishonest and insincere
I lost my mind twenty times a year

Breaking the chains around me
Nobody else can bind me
Take a good look around me
Now I'm breaking the chains

Woke up today, I'm alone
I look around, but baby, you were gone
But I don't mind and I don't worry
I will survive

I'm alone now that you're gone
Don't need nobody
To hold or tie me down
I broke the chains
So let me be, I've gotta be free

Breaking the chains around me
Nobody else can bind me
Take a good look around me
Now I'm breaking the chains

Breaking the chains around me
Nobody else can bind me
Take a good look around me
Now I'm breaking the chains
