		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jump around! Jumping free!
It's all depends on you!
Jump around! Jumping free!
Say! Yeah! Yeah! (Yeah! Yeah!)
Jump around! Jumping free!
It's all depends on you!
Jump around! Jumping free!
Say! Yeah! Yeah! (Yeah! Yeah!)
If our hearts
weren't stained black.
Hate and anger
would be a measure
of the people we meet each day.
There's no need to defy.
There's no need to kill.
Lies, bluffs
make them the truth.
Deal with the small
before the big.
There's no need to always be
such a good boy or such a girl!
Just blow!
No! Goody-two-shoes
conscience-Go!
Just stay outta my way!
Go! Get outta my way!
Oh, I've got
so much further to go!
No! Goody-two-shoes
conscience-Go!
Just stay outta my way!
Go! Get outta my way!
Oh, everybody rise up! Yeah!
I might go crazy.
My heart won't even move at all.
It's like memories
just start growing so bright.
I might go crazy.
The future is so scary now.
Maybe one day (Maybe one day)
can overcome. (can overcome.)
Jump around! Jumping free!
It's all depends on you!
Jump around! Jumping free!
Say! Yeah! Yeah! (Yeah! Yeah!)
Jump around! Jumping free!
It's all depends on you!
Jump around! Jumping free!
Say! Yeah! Yeah! (Yeah! Yeah!)
Kick it!

If our hearts
weren't stained black.
Hate and anger
would be a measure
of the people we meet each day.
There's no need to defy.
There's no need to kill.
Lies, bluffs
make them the truth.
Deal with the small
before the big.
There's no need to always be
such a good boy or such a girl!
Just blow!
No! Goody-two-shoes
conscience-Go!
Just stay outta my way!
Go! Get outta my way!
Oh, I've got
so much further to go!
No! Goody-two-shoes
conscience-Go!
Just stay outta my way!
Go! Get outta my way!
Oh, everybody rise up! Yeah!
I might go crazy.
My heart won't even move at all.
It's like memories
just start growing so bright.
I might go crazy.
The future is so scary now.
Maybe one day (Maybe one day)
can overcome. (can overcome.)
Jump around! Jumping free!
It's all depends on you!
Jump around! Jumping free!
Say! Yeah! Yeah! (Yeah! Yeah!)
Jump around! Jumping free!
It's all depends on you!
Jump around! Jumping free!
Say! Yeah! Yeah!
Jump around! ...
Kick it!
