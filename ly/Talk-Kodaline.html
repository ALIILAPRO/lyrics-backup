		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can remember the good old days
When you and me used to hide away
Where the stars were shining or the sun was blinding our eyes

Yeah you filled up my glass
With promises that could never last
But I still find pieces of you in the back of my mind

And all of the things that we once said
Are not in my heart, they're in my head
That was the time to say goodbye
Let's put it to rest yeah, let it die

'Cause we don't, we don't need to talk about this now
Yeah we've been down that road before
That was then and this is now

The crowds in my heart they've been calling out your name
Now it just don't feel the same
Guess it's over, yeah we're done

I heard you made your way downtown
To the place that I've been hanging around
I was looking for your face in the crowd
But trying to keep my head down

Over time our wires crossed
Well you changed and truth got lost
All the things I would change if we could only rewind

You were a moment in life that comes and goes
A riddle, a rhyme that no one knows
A change of a heart, a twist of fate
Couldn't fix it, it's too late

'Cause we don't, we don't need to talk about this now
Yeah we've been down that road before
That was then and this is now

The crowds in my heart they've been calling out your name
But it just don't feel the same
I guess it's over, yeah we're done

Whoa, oh oh oh

We don't, we don't need to talk about this now
We don't, we don't need to talk about this now
We don't, we don't need to talk about this now
We don't, we don't need to talk about this now
