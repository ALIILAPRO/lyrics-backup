		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's no fun here when you're alone
There's no sun here, nothing has grown
Where do we go to get away?
How do we know when to stay?

As soon as we find a space I want to celebrate
If we could leave today
I would just sail away
With You

The sun shines bright
With you
You are my light
With you
I'm never alone
With you
I'm already home

Oh
Oh

It's so fun here, who would've known?
We're overrun here, the flowers have grown
It's beautiful today
Let's go find a way

Soon as we find a space I want to celebrate
If we could leave today
I would just sail away
With you

The sun shines bright
With you
You are my light
With you
I'm never alone
With you
I'm already home
