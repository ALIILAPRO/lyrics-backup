		  Mi-i-ine
Guess what's happening now?
Well
Whoa, oh
Well
Now

Relax, don't do it
When you want to go to it
Relax, don't do it
When you want to come
Relax, don't do it
When you want to suck it, chew it
Relax, don't do it
When you want to come
When you want to come

Relax, don't do it
When you want to to go to it
Relax, don't do it
When you want to come
Relax, don't do it
When you want to suck it, chew it
Relax, don't do it
When you want to come
Ah, ah, ah
Come oh, oh, oh

But shoot it in the right direction (hey-hey-hey-yeah)
Make making it your intention (ooh-yeah, ooh-yeah)
Live those dreams
Scheme those schemes
Got to hit me (hit me)
Hit me (hit me)
Hit me with those laser beams
Ow, ow, ow, laser beam me
Ah, ah, ah

One, two

Relax
Don't do it
Relax
When you want to come
Come, ah, woo
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
I'm comin', I'm comin', hey, hey, hey, hey hey

Relax, don't do it
When you want to go to it
Relax, don't do it
When you want to come
Relax, don't do it
When you want to suck it, chew it
Relax, don't do it (love)
When you want to come
When you want to come
When you want to come

Come-huh
Ow, ow
Ow, ow, ow, yeah
You see her, feel it

Relax, don't do it
When you want to go to it
Relax, don't do it (oh-oh)
Relax, don't do it
When you want to suck it, chew it
Relax, don't do it
One sound when it's time to come (hey)
Come
