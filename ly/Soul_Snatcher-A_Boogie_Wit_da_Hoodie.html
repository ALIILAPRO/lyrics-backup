		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Could've been my back
I know you really love me, I don't know if I love you back
I brought your name up because you know your ass is fat
She call me, "Captain Hook," because she know a nigga packin', hmm
Soul snatcher, no cappin', never lackin'
Got a lot of cash
And I'm goin' with you, you're so official
And you know I miss you
(JoeFromYo and DLo)

Soul snatcher, no cappin' (no cappin'), never lackin' (never lackin')
Got a lot of cash
And I'm goin' with you, you're so official
And you know I miss you
Girl, you know I'm on your ass
I'm a soul snatcher, no cappin', never lackin'
Got a lot of cash
And I'm goin' with you, you know I miss you
And you're so official
Girl, you know I'm on your ass

They lurkin' on me, but, it's okay though
Broski on 'em, I know the opps don't know his name
But he know about ya, he will blow your block out
That's just how he rockin', I would hate to feel your pain
I'm a trendin' topic, take your lady shoppin'
Don't you try to play me, stop it
I already know the game, I got a fuckin' problem
I'm workin' on it, broken-hearted
I don't even love to sing

Soul snatcher (soul snatcher), no cappin' (no cappin'), never lackin' (never lackin')
Got a lot of cash
And I'm goin' with you (goin' with you), you're so official (so official)
And you know I miss you (know I miss you)
Girl, you know I'm on your ass
Soul snatcher, no cappin', never lackin'
Got a lot of cash
And I'm goin' with you, you know I miss you
And you're so official
Girl, you know I'm on your ass

Fuckin' on a baddie made my ex mad
I can't even clean her mess 'cause I'm in Herm√®s
She only do Birkins for her purses, she's so bad
She don't even fly commercial, only private jets (yeah)
She gave me head, I gave her whiplash
She poppin' Perkys like they Tic Tacs
Hellcat painted matte black
Hundred years if I get caught with this backpack
Thirty clip inside the F&N with .223s
Now I got a lot of guap, don't make a movie (woo)
Five hundred choppers, way too many goonies (brrt)
They used to call me dirty
But now I got my money up, they call me, "Odee" (woo)
Now the bitches wanna fuck me and the whole team (yeah)
She call me Captain Hook, I like to put the whole thing, yeah
Put you on my shoulders, I'm a-

Soul snatcher (soul snatcher), no cappin' (no cappin'), never lackin' (never lackin')
Got a lot of cash
And I'm goin' with you (goin' with you), you're so official (so official)
And you know I miss you (know I miss you)
Girl, you know I'm on your ass
Soul snatcher (soul snatcher), no cappin' (no cappin'), never lackin' (never lackin')

And I'm goin' with you, you know I miss you

I'm a soul snatcher, I'm a soul snatcher
I'm a soul snatcher, I'm a soul snatcher
I'm a soul snatcher, I'm a soul snatcher
