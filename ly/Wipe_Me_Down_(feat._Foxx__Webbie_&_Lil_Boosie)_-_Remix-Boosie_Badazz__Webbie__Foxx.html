		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mr. wipe down ya heard me Foxx-a-million
This one be the remix!
Badazz, Savage live, Fox-a-million
Man you already know what it is ya heard me
We still on, we still riding on chrome, we still pullin' up, man up

I pull up at the club VIP
Gas tank on E but all dranks on me (wipe me down)
Fresh kicks fresh white tall tee
Fresh NFL hat fresh bows wit the crease (wipe me down)
Pussy niggaz wanna hit me wit they heat,
Real recognize real real niggaz gon' speak (wipe me down)
Jiggalatin I been rollin 'bout a week
You can tell I got cake by the diamonds in my teeth (wipe me down)
Black shades so you know a nigga rollin
They ain't check me at the door so ain't no tellin' what I'm holdin' (wipe me down)
Bad bitches they gon' bust it wide open
Niggas flashin' they lil' bread but I'm the nigga they approachin' (wipe me down)
Small niggas tall figures y'all niggas crowd niggas
We gon' get mac elevens and dawg niggas (wipe me down)
Y'all niggas call niggas but my nigga all killas
Get ya issue and whoever fall wit ya

'Cause I'm on (wipe me down)
'Cause I'm on (wipe me down)
'Cause I'm on (wipe me down)
'Cause I'm on (wipe me down)
'Cause I'm on (wipe me down)
'Cause I'm on (wipe me down)
'Cause I'm on (wipe me down)
'Cause I'm on (wipe me down)
Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes
Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes
Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes
Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes

B.O.O.S.I.E.B.A.D.A.Z.Z. that's me (wipe me down)
Red bones caramels all of em stop and stare
All of 'em tryna steal my underwear (wipe me down)
I like to floss like Rick Ross got a hit called set it off
When I sang it everybody set it off (wipe me down)
Black mink yea I'm on play wit me I bust ya dome
8 whips on chrome you can gone (wipe me down)
Fresh fade fresh j's on the corner playin' spades
I'm a ordinary person but I'm paid (wipe me down)
Foxx flippin' Webbie smokin' and we chokin' off a whole pound of purple
Famous like a ninja turtle (wipe me down)
Just left New York City hooked up wit P. Diddy
Finna blow past 50 you gone have to (wipe me down)
We the best I'm a fool I'm the hemi man
Red light green light yellow light get it man

'Cause I'm on (wipe me down)
'Cause I'm on (wipe me down)
'Cause I'm on (wipe me down)
'Cause I'm on (wipe me down)
'Cause I'm on (wipe me down)
'Cause I'm on (wipe me down)
'Cause I'm on (wipe me down)
'Cause I'm on (wipe me down)
Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes
Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes
Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes
Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes

Hot drop drop top top drop hoes drop it like its hot
Yea nigga I'm the shit (wipe me down)
You see this ice on my wrist how it glisten
Soon as the light hit you can't lie the ice sick (wipe me down)
Purple got me smellin' funky red monkey
five hundred dollars on em you ain't seen these yet (wipe me down)
Beatin' you can hear me way around the corner
Paint wet wit the 24's on it now that's a bet (wipe me down)
Old ladies baby mommas new fiances
Niggas wife savage life who I'm gonna fuck next (wipe me down)
And I use the Lifestyle or the Magnum or the Trojan
Or go head and use the barrel of the tech (wipe me down)
Man this chain hit me for a couple grand
Oh no I ain't complaining just watch how you wipe my chest (wipe me down)
A bad bitch wanted me to stay there longer
I put that dick up on her but I had a flight to catch (wipe me down)

Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes
Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes

Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes
Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes

Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes
Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes

Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes
Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes
