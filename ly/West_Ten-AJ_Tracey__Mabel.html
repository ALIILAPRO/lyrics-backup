		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't you know I'm walkin' away?
And if you don't want me to stay
Only, only, only, only
(D-D-Daytrip took it to ten, hey)

Don't you know I'm walkin' away?
Now I'm in my own space
Babe you know I ain't waitin' for you
And if you don't want me to stay
Only one thing to say
Babe you know I ain't waitin' for you

Want me, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, me
Want me to say
Want me, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Know I ain't waitin' for you
Want me, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, me
Want me to say
Want me, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Know I ain't waitin' for you

Big ease when it comes to the lyrics
Me I do this ting on the mic with no gimmicks
Came a long way, I was servin' in those Civics
And you were tryna keep me from winnin' but I did it, I did it
Ask about me I did it
Let man stay on my sofa, I did it (I did it)
Buss down my watch and my choker, I did it
I keep a straight face in this poker, I did it, look
Rest assured mans got you (on my life)
If life weighin' you down then I'll spot you (let's go)
Water are you, show you sun never block you
If no one's backin' your beef, then I've got to (of course)
Yeah, back your beef that's my job (bling-blaow)
Just ride for me, don't write off (yeah)
I got your back, hold tight when you climb one (yeah)
I've always been a real nigga to rely on

Don't you know I'm walkin' away?
Now I'm in my own space
Babe you know I ain't waitin' for you
And if you don't want me to stay
Only one thing to say
Babe you know I ain't waitin' for you

Ask about me I did it
Let man stay on my sofa, I did it (want me to stay)
Buss down my watch and my choker, I did it
I keep a straight face in this poker, I did it, I did it (know I ain't waitin' for you)
Ask about me I did it
Let man stay on my sofa, I did it (I did it)
Buss down my watch and my choker, I did it
I keep a straight face in this poker, I did it, I did it (know I ain't waitin' for you)

Live and direct, don't mean that I'm live (wah?)
But live and direct, means I'm buildin' a vibe (yeah)
Touch one of mine, on God I'ma ride
I win and break bread for my fam, I provide (break bread)
Eight-piece, eight P, come and get me (bling-blaow)
Set beast, curl it in from a set piece
Aj make the waves like a jetski (yeah)
Iced out ice everywhere like I'm Gretzky (bling-blaow)
Easy money sniper but check my KD
I ball like KD and rock like AC (let's go)
You know me done shows in DC
Nyc, drop my top like page three (NYC)
Cool breeze match the London sky (look)
Bubble, cruise like a four wheel drive (uh)
Take time when I'm on the mic, it's live (live)
And pressure makes diamonds, try me, I'll thrive

Told you I ain't tryna wait no more
Yeah I've been on you but that don't mean I'm always yours
Boy listen, boy listen
'Cause it doesn't add up, something's missin'
And I finally switch your position
Might be somebody new that I'm kissin', yeah
Sayin' that I'm out of line but you don't know about me
And maybe if you took the time then you would know what I need
Don't know what you came here for
Watch me walkin' out the door
It's over now, babe I ain't yours
Ain't waitin' for your love no more

(Hey)
Don't you know I'm walkin' away?
Now I'm in my own space
Babe you know I ain't waitin' for you
And if you don't want me to stay
Only one thing to say
Babe you know I ain't waitin' for you

Ask about me I did it
Let man stay on my sofa, I did it (want me to stay)
Buss down my watch and my choker, I did it
I keep a straight face in this poker, I did it, I did it (know I ain't waitin' for you)
Ask about me I did it
Let man stay on my sofa, I did it
Buss down my watch and my choker, I did it
I keep a straight face in this poker, I did it, I did it (know I ain't waitin' for you)

Want me, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, me (D-D-Daytrip took it to ten, hey)
Want me to say
Want me, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Know I ain't waitin' for you
Want me, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, me
Want me to say
Want me, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Know I ain't waitin' for you
