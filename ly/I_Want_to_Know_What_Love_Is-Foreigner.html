		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gotta take a little time
Little time to think things over
Better read between the lines 
In case I need it when I'm older

Ooh, oh

This mountain, I must climb
Feels like a world upon my shoulders
Through the clouds, I see love shine
Keeps me warm as life grows colder

In my life, there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far to change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is, I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is, I know you can show me
Ah

Gotta take a little time
Little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
Looks like love has finally found me

In my life, there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far to change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is, I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is, I know you can show me
I wanna know what love is (I wanna know), I want you to show me
(I wanna feel) I wanna feel what love is
(I know, and I know, and I know) I know you can show me

Let's talk about love (I wanna know what love is)
Love that you feel inside (I want you to show me)
I'm feeling so much love (I wanna feel what love is)
And you know you just can't hide (I know you can show me)
(Show me that it's real, yeah) ah

I wanna know what love is (let's talk about love)
I know you can show me
I wanna feel (I want to feel what love is)
And you know you just can't hide (I know you can show me)
I wanna know what love is (oh, I wanna know)
