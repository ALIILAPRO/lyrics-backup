		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why don't you just do as I say
When you know you won't get away 
Why even try
When you will die either way

You'll say save me, save me or try to escape 
Begging for mercy when it's too late
It's you I need
Oh you'll be pleading in vain

It had to be you
It had to be you
I wandered around
And finally found
The somebody who Could make me feel new 
Been waiting for you 
When it's said and done 
You are the one
I'd kill to pursue

I'll drown out your screams 
Prey on your dreams
Take over your mind
Play tricks on your eyes
No one believes

I'll bury your soul 
Take total control 
When it comes time 
Oh you're gonna find 
You've become me

For nobody else 
Gives me this thrill 
With all your faults 
I want you still
It's always been you 
Wonderful you
It had to be you

For nobody else
Gives me this thrill
You can run
But I'm coming for the kill
It's always been you 
Wonderful you
It had to be you
