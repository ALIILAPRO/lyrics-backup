		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sinkin' down to the bottom, need a better view
Got me walkin' 'round my circle, is it bulletproof?
Sometimes I think until I go insane
Can I even trust somebody with the same last name, uh?
Tons of crazy people running from the light, ah
Bad decisions that could come around and bite ya
Wish I could write just a little less
Wish I could cry, end all the noise up inside my head

When it's over, it's over, it's over
It's over

I'm watching all the moves you make
Can't turn back now, it's too late
Check mate, there's no defending
This is the start of the ending
I'm counting all of your mistakes
Caught up in a crossfire hurricane
Check mate, there's no defending
This is the start of the ending
This is the start of the ending

I did it, took a second, but I realized
I been looking for a reason just to sever ties
Only seeing what I wanna see
Got me questioning the things that I started to believe
Paranoid from the drama in my life, uh
Trust issues make it hard to sleep at night, uh
Wish I could whine just a little less
Wish I could cry, end all the noise up inside my head

When it's over, it's over, it's over
It's over

I'm watching all the moves you make
Can't turn back now, it's too late
Check mate, there's no defending
This is the start of the ending
I'm counting all of your mistakes
Caught up in a crossfire hurricane
Check mate, there's no defending
This is the start of the ending

When it's over, it's over, it's over
When it's over, it's over, it's over
When it's over, it's over, it's over
It's over

I'm watching all the moves you make
Can't turn back now, it's too late
Check mate, there's no defending
This is the start of the ending
I'm counting all of your mistakes
Caught up in a crossfire hurricane
Check mate, there's no defending
This is the start of the ending

This is the start of the ending
