		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hmm
I ain't talkin' 'bout my real fans
Talkin' 'bout dirty hoes
Fan hoes, fan hoes
Groupie bitches, groupie bitches
(Damn, Trademark)

Why these bitches cappin' on my name? (Why they do that?)
Makin' posts like we was somethin', baby, all I did was fuck
Why these bitches cappin' on my name? (Why they do that?)
Tellin' people we was somethin', baby, all I did was fuck

They ain't nothin' but some
Fan hoes, groupie bitches, groupie bitches, fan hoes
Fan hoes, groupie bitches, groupie bitches, fan hoes
Fan hoes, groupie bitches, groupie bitches, fan hoes
Fan hoes, groupie bitches, groupie bitches, fan hoes

"Nardo, what's her name? Didn't you hit her?"
I don't be knowin' their names, I go by pictures (I go by pictures)
She cryin' 'cause I played her, go buy tissues (go buy tissues)
She ain't used to guys like me, I know her nigga (uh-huh)
Break her back and I tell Tutu, "Call my phone so I can leave" (so I can go)
She get up and walk me to the door 
Got carpet burn all on her knees (carpet burn all on her)
She kinda tall, well I'm a monkey, look at me, I'm climbin' trees
She say I knocked on her period, look at me, I'm bangin' Bs (bitch, I'm bangin' Blood)
Don't give a fuck about no nigga, call yo' uncle, daddy, brother
I'm the stepper that's gon' stomp when it come time to be a stomper
I don't like the baggy jeans 'cause it be hard to tuck my cutter
Put my finger in that other hole 'cause she like when I do it (like when I do it)
She so petty, she get mad whenever her friends know all my music (friends know all my music)
Make everybody dance, why the fuck they dancin'?
I don't know, I guess this chopper sound like music
I keep that stick by the bed like I'm Aiden (like I'm Aiden)
I wore a rubber, bitch still screamed, "Baby" (bitch still screamed)
You is a nut, honey, you is not my lady
Got her outta character, Wick turned her crazy 

Why these bitches cappin' on my name? (Why they do that?)
Makin' posts like we was somethin', baby, all I did was fuck
Why these bitches cappin' on my name? (Why they do that?)
Tellin' people we was somethin', baby, all I did was fuck

They ain't nothin' but some
Fan hoes, groupie bitches, groupie bitches, fan hoes
Fan hoes, groupie bitches, groupie bitches, fan hoes
Fan hoes, groupie bitches, groupie bitches, fan hoes
Fan hoes, groupie bitches, groupie bitches, fan hoes

Fan hoes, groupie bitches 
Groupie bitches, groupie bitches, fan hoes
Fan hoes, fan hoes, groupie bitches, fan hoes
