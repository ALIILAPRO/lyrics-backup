		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  These scars are far from harmless
I was barely alive
I couldn't find a reason
There was no lifeline
The knife in my back
Every time it gets twisted
I put it all in the past
'Til I rip open stitches
I need therapy
The way it made me bleed
Please don't give up on me
The fire in my eyes
I swear it almost died
Please don't give up on me
My blood out on the pavement
I'm running out of life
I knew i needed saving
Don't know how I've survived
The knife in my back
Every time it gets twisted
I put it all in the past
'Til I rip open stitches
I need therapy
The way it made me bleed
Please don't give up on me
The fire in my eyes
I swear it almost died
Please don't give up on me
I know I'm broken
My youth was stolen
Cut my wounds open
But please don't give up on me
I know I'm broken
My youth was stolen
Cut my wounds open
But please don't give up on me
