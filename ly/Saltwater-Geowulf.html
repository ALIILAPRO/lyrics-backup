		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Saltwater in the afternoon
So scared of seeing you
Saltwater at the end of Spring
So tired of hiding me

Come to the ocean
Even when you're broken

Sunrise when you call my name
Oh I thought you had something to say
When the tide wash me in
You and I no longer a thing
Unrepentantly I've waited for you

Come to the ocean
Even when you're broken
Come to the water
Let it wash you over

Come to the ocean
Even when you're broken
Come to the water
Now that we are older
