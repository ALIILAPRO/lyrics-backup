		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She’s good from the hood
Mama brought her down she's from Kansas wow
I’m shook diving in
Got that country flow bitches wanna know

She's bad my gasoline
Never know what might set her off
Baddest bitch you've ever seen ice cold
But not to me she's a little wild
But that's the shit I need

Bad for me bad for me
Every now and thеn you blow my mind
I'm not tryna lose or waste no time
Bad for mе bad for me
You can really do some damage babe
Cause you're the only one that makes me say

My girl, my girl, my girl
Only one in my world, my world, my world
Taking all the chances
Never could’ve planned this
It's always been you you
You yes

Bad for me bad for me
Every now and then you blow my mind
I'm not tryna lose or waste no time
Bad for me bad for me
You could really do some damage babe
Cause you're the only one that makes me say
