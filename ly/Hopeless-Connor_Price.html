		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been feeling hopeless, have you noticed?
Haven't really been okay
I've been feeling hopeless, have you noticed?
Haven't been myself in days

I wrote this on a Tuesday
I woke up hoping that I could do things, even just a few things
A step up from Monday, sit inside my room
Played loops 'til the room shake, still not feeling nothin'
Maybe if I hit the gym I'll get a second win
On second thought I think I'd rather check up on my friends instead
A couple messages I kept unread
I go to type but instead I live them on read
Why is it the things always left unsaid that speak volumes?
Thinking I should call you, tell you 'bout the place that I fell to
But what if you fall too? I know you all too well
You attached to my emotions
Don't wanna burden you, I guess I'll hold this
I'll figure it all out when I'm at my lowest
But if I'm being honest I hope you notice

I've been feeling hopeless, have you noticed?
Haven't really been okay
I've been feeling hopeless, have you noticed?
Haven't been myself in days

Yeah, lately I forget who myself is
Caught up in opinions of the people I dealt with
Thinking that I need to be the person that they want me to be
'Cause being me is probably just selfish, right?
They tell me write a song about the way that I'm feeling
But this writer's block got me in the way of my healing
Self-doubt like a hundred pounds always hold me down
Can't break through the ceiling
But I'd rather try and fail than never try at all
And I'd rather climb the hill than never climb at all
I'd rather love and lose than not ever love
Ain't about falling down, it's 'bout getting up
You asked me how I'm doing and I said I'm feeling fine
I know you don't believe me 'cause you ask a second time
I still double down and tell you everything's alright, don't you worry
I just need to get outside, clear my mind
The moment that I leave you, you be texting me, checking me
Always want the best for me, my ride or die
If you ain't givin' up on me then why should I?
I went back inside, looked you in the eyes and I told you

I've been feeling hopeless, have you noticed?
Haven't really been okay
I've been feeling hopeless, have you noticed?
Haven't been myself in days
