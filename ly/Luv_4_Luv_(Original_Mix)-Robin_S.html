		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ow I need somebody, somebody yeah

It's so hard to find someone special
That someone you can love and trust
It's so hard to put your love on the line
You know love,  time will show it's face in time
Some people, all they want is fortune
Some people, all they want is fame
Some people all they'll do is break your heart
There's got to be a better way

I'm givin' you love, I
I'm givin' you love for love
If you feel it in your heart
That's the only way to start
It's gotta be love for love, hey

And when you find that special someone
There's got to be a little give and take
It feels so bad to give all your heart
Only to find that love was just in vain
Some people say that love's a gamble
Some people think that it's a game
Some people say that love is just for fools
There's got to be a better way

I'm givin' you love yeah
I'm givin' you love for love
If your love is in your heart
That's the only way to start
I'm givin' you love for love

I'm givin' you love, oh baby
I'm givin' you love for love
If you want me here to stay
Baby that's the only way
It's gotta be love for love, hey

I need your lovin', oh my baby
I want your lovin' maybe
It's gotta be love, it's gotta be love for love
Oh yeah

I, I, I
It's gotta be love for love
If you feel it in your heart
That's the only way to start
It's gotta be love for love
I'm givin' you love, oh baby
I'm givin' you love for love for love
If you want me here to stay
Baby that's the only way
I'm givin' you love for love
I'm givin' you love, oh baby
I'm givin' you love for love
If you want me here to stay
Baby that's the only way
It's gotta be love for love, hey
