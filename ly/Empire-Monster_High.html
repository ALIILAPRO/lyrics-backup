		  N-n-name in the lights
Livin' royal
Take a look at these beautiful diamonds!
And they're shining, and we're climbing
To the top of this kingdom
Nobody can stop us!

Oh, oh, oh
If having everything that I want is wrong
I don't wanna be right
Oh, oh, oh
Sitting high on my throne
In control
This is some kind of life

Empire, empire
Reign over everything, take over everything
Empire, empire
Reign over everything, take over everything
Take over the world, you and I together
Nobody can stop us, stop us, building our
Empire, empire
Reign over everything, take over everything

Empire, empire
Building us an empire, yeah
Empire, empire
Building us an empire, yeah

All I want is everything
Cause we're kings and queens
Why pretend to be anything less
I'm a goddess, don't be modest
When we run this kingdom
It's gonna be monstrous

Oh, oh, oh
If having everything that I want is wrong
I don't wanna be right
Oh, oh, oh
Sitting high on my throne
In control
This is some kind of life

Empire, empire
Reign over everything, take over everything
Empire, empire
Reign over everything, take over everything
Take over the world, you and I together
Nobody can stop us, stop us, building our
Empire, empire
Reign over everything, take over everything

Empire, empire
Building us an empire, yeah, yeah
Empire, empire
Building us an empire, yeah, yeah

We just want the power, the money and the power
Take it if we got a lot of, got the world towers
We just want the power, the money and the power
Stepping on you cowards, we got the world towers

Empire, empire
Reign over everything, take over everything!
Empire, empire
Reign over everything, take over everything!
Take over the world, you and I together
Nobody can stop us, stop us, building our
Empire, empire
Reign over everything, take over everything

Empire
