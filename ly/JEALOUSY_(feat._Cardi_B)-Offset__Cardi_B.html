		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a lot of drama between you and your beautiful wife, Cardi B
Let's talk about some music
Mafia, mafia, mafia, mafia
Jealou-, jealous, jealou-
Jealous ass bitch
Jealous ass bitch
Mafia, mafia, mafia, mafia
Jealou-, jealou-
Jealous ass bitch
Jealous ass bitch

Hatin' ass nigga 'cause I got it out the mud
Hatin' in the family, nigga, be your own blood
Screamin', "Fuck 12" to the D.A. and judge
Never been a dub, never been a scrub
.45 Glock, now, oh, you want the judge?
Better than who? Must be high on them drugs
Coolin' in the mansion with the bubbles in the tub
Heard you undercover, you a bitch, you was a stud
'Set, yes, nigga, don't try me
In a Lamb', I be damned if a nigga try me
Gettin' ham with the fam, man, a nigga gotta eat
Shawty, nuttin', I'ma bust, I'ma trick for a treat
'Fore I bought the Lamb', I was ridin' in the Jeep
Five hundred horses with the stick on a seat
Fuck that nigga, he'll fold when there's heat
Go against the code for the dough, boy, you weak
Go against the grain, man, you know a nigga lame
Cartier frames, I can see a nigga brain
Cartier bracelet, it matchin' with the chain
Dirt up on my name, man, you nigga should be shamed
Knock off her boots when I'm throwin' up gang
Diamonds fruit loops on this watch, and it's plain
My dawg got the juice and I'm smokin' propane
I'm gunnin', I run to the money, Usain
Who talkin'? Who tellin'? Who sang?
I'm sellin' prescription cocaine
She fuck with my pimpin', my cane
I'm Michael, I'm not no Jermaine
Jealousy, that shit gon' eat your heart out
This a AR sawed off, we'll slay your squad out
This the beast you brought out, this a feast, we ball out
I'll eat your heart out, I'll pull your card out
It's simple, put holes in his face like it's dimples
New Kimber, new bop-bop, bop-bop, make it limp him
He play with me, blowin' me, rise in my temper
I got millions of racks in my mansion, my temple
I'm gangsta but with your bitch, I get gentle
Wanksta, take out your teeth like it's dentures
I'm blankin', you eat this Glock, I'm Miss Winners

(Jealous ass bitch)
(Mafia, mafia, mafia, mafia)
(Jealou-, jealous, jealou-)
(Jealous ass bitch)
What the fuck these bitches talkin' 'bout, man? (Jealous ass bitch)
(Mafia, mafia, mafia, mafia)
I mean (jealou-, jealou-)
Who's tellin' us what? (Jealous ass bitch)
(Jealous ass bitch)
Bardi

Look, ain't no bitch finna front on me (no)
Bad body bitch with the jumbo teeth
Yellow Lamborghini like a bumblebee
Girl, nobody listen to you 'less you talkin' 'bout me (woo)
It's always a bird tryna tweet shit (yeah)
You offended when I be on defense (fuck you)
They're too worried 'bout me and my nigga (huh)
You should worry 'bout the nigga yours sleep with, hmm (ah)
Face is given and never not gave
Been to Atlanta, but bitches ain't brave
How bitches mad? I'm the number one pick
It's funny, your nigga the one that's a trade
Bitches is mad stupid (stupid)
They get to the bag and lose it (lose it)
I'm still in the bed, I live on her head
Water and gas included, brrt (grrah)
Bitches don't wanna go Birkin for Birkin
Bitches ain't got enough hits for a Verzuz
Bitches be actin' so different in person
Cartier frames, I can see why she nervous (woo)
This shit a circus, I'm dipped in detergent
I'm sick, get the nurses, my whip got the curtains
I'm dripped out in Hermes
A bitch say my name, then she number one trendin'
I did you a service, bitch

Jealous ass bitch
Jealous ass bitch
Like, huh?
Jealous ass bitch
Man, what the fuck these hoes talkin' 'bout? (Jealous ass bitch)
Hold on, hold on, hold on

Look, let's keep it a bean, let's keep it a buck
If I had a dick, it need to be sucked
All of my opps is runnin' they jibs
Stomach too big, it need to be tucked (ah-ah-ah)
All of that cryin' be keepin' me up
When Bardi's around, they see me and duck
When I make a post, I'm leavin' it up
They came from the hood but they leave in the trunk
Bitch
