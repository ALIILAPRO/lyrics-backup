		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been an angel all summer long
I swear I've done nothing wrong
I want all of your tears to be gone, come along
Cape Cod, Santa Fe
A little houseboat in Marina del Rey
So close to get and so far away, come along

Could the words ever be unspoken?
Could the truth ever untell those lies?
Could a promise ever have been unbroken?
Oh, would it kill you to try?
Kill you to try

C'mon

Don't let me out of this photograph
Since I found you, I can't stop laughin'
Come on, I need you, baby, you're my better half
Come back home

What is it?
What is it I must do?
What is it?
Babe, what is it I must do for you?
Babe, what is it?
What is it must do?
What is it?
Babe, what is it I must do for you?

Show me, I've relied on myself to see it
Call me back to bed to tell you a lullaby
You got no damn right to be so damn heartbroken
Boy, I would kill you to try

Boy, it would kill you to try
Boy, it would kill you to try

Could the words ever be unspoken?
Could the truth ever untell the lies?
Could a promise ever be unbroken?
Oh, would it kill you to try?

What is it?
What is it I must do?
Let me come
Let me come home to you
What is it?
What is it I must do?
(If I tell you, promise me you're leaving)
Let me come
Let me come home to you
(Show me, I'd blind myself to see it)
What is it? (I come home)
What is it I must do? (I come home)
(If I tell you, promise me you're leaving)
Let me come (let me come)
Let me come home to you (Let me come home)
(Show me, I'd blind myself to see it)
What is it? (I come home)
What is it I must do? (I come home)
(If I tell you, promise me you're leaving)
Let me come (let me come)
Let me come home to you (let me come home)
(Show me, I'd blind myself to see it)
What is it? (I come home)
What is it I must do? (I come home)
(If I tell you, promise me you're leaving)
What is it? (I come home)
What is it I must do? (I come home)
(Show me, I'd blind myself to see it)
Let me come (I come home)
Let me come home to you (I come home)
(Oh, tell me, promise me you're leaving)
