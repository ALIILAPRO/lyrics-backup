		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, you and me are a twisted fantasy
Buckle up and take a seat, hold on tight

Situation critical, it's heavy
A million blocks of obstacles, you help me
See a different POV (givin' back all my)
Faith in a catastrophe (it's alright)

Keep on movin' (movin')
Beat the system, autopilot cruisin' (cruising)
Tunnel vision victory, no losin' (losin')
Heaven knows it's one hell of a ride
Better hold on tight, better hold on tight for your life

Baby, you and me are a twisted fantasy
Bodies running on a dream, up all night (all night)
Wired differently, a chaotic energy
Buckle up and take a seat, hold on tight (on tight)

We were built to be two enemies (I know, I know)
But somehow I know, we're meant to be (I know, I know)
This world's a battlefield, I will be your shield
We've got something real, worth disrupting the peace
We'll disrupt the peace, ahh

Yeah, keep on movin' (movin')
Beat the system, autopilot cruisin' (cruising)
Tunnel vision victory, no losin' (losin')
Heaven knows it's one hell of a ride
Better hold on tight, better hold on tight for your life

Baby, you and me are a twisted fantasy
Bodies running on a dream, up all night (all night)
Wired differently, a chaotic energy
Buckle up and take a seat, hold on tight (for your life)

Baby, you and me are a twisted fantasy
Bodies running on a dream, up all night (all night)
Wired differently, a chaotic energy
Buckle up and take a seat, hold on tight (on tight)

Hold on tight (hold on tight)
Hold on tight
