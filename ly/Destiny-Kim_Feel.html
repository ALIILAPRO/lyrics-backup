		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bleed it out 'til someone's sacrifice
Like faith without a fear
Feel like I'm grounded
Last thing I wanted
Hold me like you used to do

Be brave, time to face
Last thing I want is to stop and stare
Destiny, it's all meant to be 
I will never let you go
Never let you fall
Spend your life?

Searching for the light of mystery
A breathtaking moment
Nothing can't hold me
Nothing won't break me
Hold you tight
And always be here

Be brave, time to face
Last thing I want is to stop and stare
Destiny, how would you know?
When I lose myself away 
Bring me back to you

Covered in rain and lost in the dark
I suffer from delusions
But you won't ever be

Be brave, time to face
Last thing I want is to stop and stare
Destiny, it's all meant to be 
I will never let you go
Never let me go
