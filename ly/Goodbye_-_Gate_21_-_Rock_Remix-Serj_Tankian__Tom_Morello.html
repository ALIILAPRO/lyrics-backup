		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  love that you bring, it brings me along. 
the pain that you give, gives me a home. 
do you wanna stay by my side, do you want me to turn and hide. 
we are disappearing inside, 
seeing pictures of our good bye's. 
we, we believe, that love will survive.
the pain that you bring, brings me along. 

do you love me, do you hate me; do you wanna to believe me. 
do you think that you don't need me do you wanna to deceive me. 
I can't take that it's all over; don't want to forget.
I can't take this disappointment, yet I'm the one under pressure. 
Goodbye, goodbye. This night is wonderful.
This dream will exceed that goodbyes aren't for long.
Please follow me to the corners of destiny.
I don't want to break from your side.
Please follow me to the corners of destiny.
I don't want to break from your side.
The falling ground screams goodbye.Goodbye,Goodbye,Goodbye,Goodbye 
please let me see that goodbye's aren't for long...
