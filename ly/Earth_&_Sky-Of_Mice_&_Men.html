		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I felt you dragging me into a shallow grave
The dirt became a place to rest, but it betrays
You'll never stop me, your reign has ended
You'll never hold down that which has ascended
(That which has ascended)

I won't run, I won't turn away
I won't let you get the best of me
I won't fall in your gravity
Open your eyes
You're the earth and I'm the sky

You are a single stone amongst infinity
I am the wind that blows, I am the voice inside the rain
Can you feel the cold wind blowing
Unrelenting, everlasting?
Do you feel it in your bones?
Do you feel it in your soul?

I won't run, I won't turn away
I won't let you get the best of me
I won't fall in your gravity
Open your eyes
I won't run (run), I won't turn away
I won't let you get the best of me
I won't fall (fall) in your gravity
Open your eyes
You're the earth and I'm the sky
