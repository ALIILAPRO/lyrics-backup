		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (Ayy, B)
Yo

Disorientated and should've just rested
Called your phone when I should've just texted
Block down, should've just Tetris
Retail therapy, should've invested
Diamonds dance, they should've been tested
Follow his eyes, you can see the intention
Tension, the G Tech slide with a Jensen
Gated chest with aluminium fencin'
Nay just hopped it, Tae then hopped it
Let me tell you the day a synopsis
Found me the meanin' of life when he lost it
Scorpion kick on the day they crossed it
Doxin' revealin' myself, I'm boxed in
Venomous action toxic
Batman step with the power of cosmic
Strike that one, I'm caustic

Smile, don't cry, pour Henny inside
It's snakes in the grass, reptilian lies
Fake friends weren't there, this really implies
I lost it, gained a Brazilian vibe
This quirky jawn le million slide
Take civilian lives
She gave me the Isaac Newton Law
That brain, you know you got a brilliant mind

By the cul de sac, car coldest hat
It's wet, make the coldest snap
They draw for the pistol, shoulder strap
I'm stuck in the mud, need a shoulder tap
Danger sensed the beholder's back
I'm BK, what type of hold is that?
Score on the news, it's makin' the headlines
Bringin' Ann Boulter back
Just move your queen when I move my knight
That's instant hit when he boots that pipe
Soul, the medulla's mine
I'm stuck in the past, the futuras fine
Won't be the fool this time
I'm seein' the flaws and foolin' the blind
Possession lost when I passed up the time
When it's time, I'm callin' you mine, it's kosher
Heat in the back, it's solar
Hot with the heat, let it fan bipolar
Strike with the heat, let it tan bowler
Look, man, then I look back Ademola
PCP when they drag that motor (stolen), stolen
DDT, that's don't do ticks
I was young, now I'm like Hulk Hogan

Smile, don't cry, pour Henny inside
It's snakes in the grass, reptilian lies
Fake friends weren't there, this really implies
I lost it, gained a Brazilian vibe
This quirky jawn le million slide
Take civilian lives
She gave me the Isaac Newton Law
That brain, you know you got a brilliant mind

Smile, don't cry, pour Henny inside
It's snakes in the grass, reptilian lies
Fake friends weren't there, this really implies
I lost it, gained a Brazilian vibe
This quirky jawn le million slide
Take civilian lives
She gave me the Isaac Newton Law
That brain, you know you got a brilliant mind
