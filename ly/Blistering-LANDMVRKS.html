		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Will you show me the way, my heart is blistering
It's something that won't come easily

I've seen the rise and the fall
I see the lights buried deeper in my soul
I see your lies and you're
faking your smile with everything that you've got

I'll be the one, be the one
Just let me in so i can fix what’s broken
I see the cracks in your heart
you think you're better in the end but you're not

I've braved the worst
for what we used to be
A different person, The same skin
Your eyes don't shine the same

Will you show me the way, my heart is blistering
It's something that won't come easily
Are you standing for something, somewhere
I'm waiting here in the nothingness
I'm calling your name but no one’s listening

You bring the suffering in me
I'll never forgive you if i cannot forgive me
I can't remember how it led us here
don't get me wrong.

I see your smile bringing the suffering
And what we used to be

And your eyes don't shine the same

Will you show me the way, my heart is blistering
It's something that won't come easily
Are you standing for something, somewhere
I'm waiting here in the nothingness
I'm calling your name but no one’s listening

Tell me are you even listening ?

Say what you said to me
Open your eyes you've never tried to see
Many reasons why i've never stopped the bleed
You won't get the message nor the lines between

Motherfucker
You won't get the message again

Say what you said to me
Open your eyes you've never tried to see
You won't get the message nor even the lines in between
