		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Austin man keep doin yo thing
Let these boys keep slippin' man
I'm not into gymnastics but I'm into flippin' things

I told these women that it's all about the team, Jordan and Pippen man
So if you wanna join the team
Now tell me up in this thing, dale!

When I saw her
Walking down the street
She looked so fine
I just had to speak

I asked her name
But she turned away
As she walked
All that I could say was

Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I could say was

Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I could say was

Rollin' up one time, we'll make it up as we go
I know you feel it 'cause I mean what I said said said said
We can do whatever, do whatever we want
If she walk past me I say hehe he he he (he he)

So tell me where you're from, where you wanna go
But she walked past me like ain't said a word
Stood there like man
Girl I don't usually feel some type of way
But this one hear me out it's some kind of place, God!

When I saw her
Walking down the street
She looked so fine
I just had to speak

I asked her name
But she turned away
As she walked
All that I could say was

Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I could say was

Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I could say was

Six inch heels clickin' up and down the street
You know she's comin and when she walks away way way way
Look I'm a big big deal, a little fun's all I need
But I can tell she don't believe what I said said said said said

So tell me where you're from, where you wanna go
But she walked past me like ain't said a word
Stood there like man
Girl I don't usually feel some type of way
But this one hear me out it's some kind of place, God!

When I saw her
Walking down the street
She looked so fine
I just had to speak

I asked her name
But she turned away
As she walked
All that I could say was

Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I could say was

Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I could say was

Mmm mmm yeah yeah
She looks so good but she bad bad
You can that back from the front front
Move it like criss cross, jump jump
Meet me in the middle of the ocean
We can find ourselves and lose a magi rewind
Wawawawa, play
Find ourselves and lose a magic day
Austin, man Armando acabando latinos y gringos gozando me entiendes
For those that thought that we would stop
They don't even have a mind to think with, brainless
Most of them broke but they're famous
Some got hitched but they're nameless
But mamita, forget about that
When I see you
All that I could say was

Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I could say was

Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I could say was

Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I could say was

Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I could say was
