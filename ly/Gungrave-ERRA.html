		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm trapped inside this room
Witnessing your degradation
A soul lost in limbo
This house is your incarceration

I've heard your voice at night haunt these halls
Feet on the stairs
The echoes of your tears 
I've felt nothing since the day you left
It's been like this for years and years

Modern mind, divisive voices redefine (your heart) 
Realign what's broken
Every word, misguided by thoughts left confined (confined)
You could leave it all behind

Crawled into a place in my head 
The only space where I could feel safe and sound
All that you've lived for comes spiraling down
Catatonic
Emaciated
All this pain that you have created
Battered heart
Broken soul
With no other place to go

Modern mind, divisive voices redefine (your heart) 
Realign what's broken 
Every word, misguided by thoughts left confined (confined)
You could leave it all behind 
Modern mind, divisive voices redefine (your heart)
You could leave it all behind 
The small hours loud inside the modern mind, leeching on the lonely heart 

Modernity seems to amplify the boundaries of your heart
You try going back when you mean to restart, and the foundation falls apart 
The foundation falls apart, on and on and on
Spiralling downward. Spiral down. Spiral down. 
Reset the pattern doomed to repeat 
A perpetual cycle, on and on and on 
Catatonic 
Emaciated
All this pain that you have created
