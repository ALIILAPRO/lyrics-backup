		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Great John on the beat, by the way
Live by the gun, you die by the judge,  nigga
Shooter get, shooter get shot
Yeah, you know that? Huh? yeah
Shooters get shot

Look, huh, look
Fuck up my figure, get you wrapped
Like a lyric huh, look, huh, look
Fuck up my wig
Get you punched like some digit's huh, look
Innocent pleadin', courts don't believe me
Think I'm a demon huh, look
Innocent pleadin', courts don't believe me
Think I'm a menace or somethin'


Look, they say I'm a savage and all that
I'm causin' a panic and all that
Look, look
These niggas is rattin' and all that
For shhh, man, I can't tell you all that
Look, this one right here with no effort
I'm saucin' and runnin' this check up
Look, look, Glock right here on my left hand
I reach with my right, leave you stressin'
Look, I get you brrt, the brrat
Life ain't predictable nigga
I stay on attack, huh
This ain't no musical, nigga
(Look) don't diss me on tracks, huh
Said this ain't no musical, nigga
(Look)
So miss me with that, yeah, miss me with that
I'm with all that trappin'
Fast and cashin'
Act tough and the gang gon' get to clappin'
Bitch, fuck you askin' all them questions?
Fuck wit' 'em then you
Duckin' wit' 'em next, and
Know that it ain't
Know that it ain't no remorse
You know that it ain't no
Remorse, it ain't no remorse, huh
Know that it ain't no remorse
It ain't no remorse, it ain't no remorse

Look, fuck up my figure, get you wrapped
Like a lyric huh, look, huh, look
Fuck up my wig
Get you punched like some digit's huh, look
Innocent pleadin', courts don't believe me
Think I'm a demon huh, look
Innocent pleadin', courts don't believe me
Think I'm a menace or somethin'


I'm too official with it
You know that I ain't let up for none
My head is Crippin', definition
You can play if you want
It's your choice, you can say what you want
If gang get up on it, we gettin' it done
If bro throw a shot
Then I'm throwin' a shot
You prolly know me from droppin' your
Homie and making a run
Or prolly the music, don't get me confused
I can really go dumb
Go retarded, shooter gang
We ain't up for no bargain
We finish, we start it
They say I'm a menace or somethin'
Don't fuck with this military drum
Ain't wit' it, don't act like you want it
Look, don't got it
Don't act like you got it
He say he got bodies, he fraudin', no
No, he never hit up a target
Ain't wit' it, don't act like you want it
Look, don't got it
Don't act like you got it
He say he got bodies, he fraudin', no
No, he never hit up a target

Look, huh, look
Fuck up my figure, get you wrapped
Like a lyric huh, look, huh, look
Fuck up my wig
Get you punched like some digit's huh, look
Innocent pleadin', courts don't believe me
Think I'm a demon huh, look
Innocent pleadin', courts don't believe me
Think I'm a menace or somethin'
Look, huh, look
Fuck up my figure, get you wrapped
Like a lyric huh, look, huh, look
Fuck up my wig
Get you punched like some digit's huh, look
Innocent pleadin', courts don't believe me
Think I'm a demon huh, look
Innocent pleadin', courts don't believe me
Think I'm a menace or somethin'


Yeah, my loyal nigga ran down on him
That's a mandatory man down
We get the addy to your granny house
Bitch, then you know we finna camp out
Ayy, they don't want no
Smoke with the gangland
Tryna tell them niggas, "Stand down"
I got some outta towners on the way, way
Flight prolly finna land now
Meet me on Fourth, right by the court
None of the shootin' guards play around
Word to my mother, you niggas is dorks
You know it ain't bool for
Y'all to hang around
Glizzy with magazines hangin' out
We goin' body for body
He goin' molly for molly
His kids in the back
He still shot up the Audi
And somebody take the 40 poppa from me
In blood and find something to calm me
You live by the gun, you die by the judge
He know if they catch him, he childin'
Put some respect on a Akhi
He mixin' his 'Tec with the Wockie
Don't fuck with the text if they need me
'Cause I be really tryna do niggas sloppy
