		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was almost about to lose my faith was still dreaming 
But feared is was too late 
But then you came along to my surprise 
And stole my heart before my very eyes 

[Chorus:]
You took me right out of the blue 
Simply by showing that you love me too 
Only by giving me your everything 
With a love so true you 
Took me out of the blue 

I was wondering what love was all about 
I was trying but couldn't work it out 
But then you came along to my surprise 
And made my frozen mind come alive 

[Chorus:]

You let me out of the darkness 
You brought me out in the sun 
I think you must be the only one for me 
'Cause you took me 

Right out of the blue 
Simply by showing that you love me too 
Only by giving me your everything 
Breathing air below my wings 

You took me right out of the night 
Simply by filling my heart with light 
Only by giving me your energy 
With a love so true you took me out of the blue
