		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is for the busted heart
This is for the question marks
This is for the outcast soul
Lost control, no one knows
Sing it for the can't-go-back
Sing it for the broken past
Sing it for the just found out
Life is now upside down

If you're lookin' for hope tonight, raise your hand
If you feelin' alone and don't understand
If you're fightin' in the fight of your life, then stand
We're gonna make it through this hand-in-hand

And if we fall
We will fall together
Together

This is for the second chance
This is for the new romance
Sing it for the loved in vain
Overcame, it's not too late

If you're lookin' for hope tonight, raise your hand
If you feelin' alone and don't understand
If you're fightin' in the fight of your life, then stand
We're gonna make it through this hand-in-hand

And if we fall
We will fall together
Together (oh)
And when we rise
We will rise together
Together (ooh)

(Ohh, ohh, ohh) Oh
(Ohh-oh, ohh-oh) We will rise together
Yes (ooh), listen

If you're lookin' for hope tonight (and you're all alone)
If you're feelin' alone tonight (and you feel)
If you're in the fight of your life (I can promise)
We're gonna make it happen and (oh yeah)
I will be by your side (by your side)
'Cause love is in the air tonight (can you feel it?)
I'll help you see the light (come on)
Whenever, ever, ever, just as long as we're together, say

If we fall (fall)
We will fall together (ha ha, I got you, my brother)
Together (I see you my sister)
And when we rise
We will rise together
Together

If we fall (if we fall)
We will fall together (take my hand) 
Together (come and stand)
When we rise (when we rise)
We will rise together (we will rise together)
Together (that's all)

Together we are dangerous
Together with our differences
Together we are bolder, braver, stronger
