		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bend but don’t break, feels like I’m broken in a pile of rubble and brick
Stabbing spasms so deep in my bones take me to zero, over and over again
I’m dealing with assholes and snakes in a contest of pulsating dicks
Listen up, and take heed- I’m coming through, and I’m taking no shit, my friend

Both feet on the floor, headed for the door, I’ve got no more to give to your kind
Too weak to notice my two week notice?
GO FUCK YOURSELF- It’s time my time is mine
I don’t give a fuck, you’re outta luck- so don’t fucking whine

Slap to the face, passive aggression by a promise that never came through
Monday will boomerang back to you soon
Feeling so helpless, over and over again with the bullshit and cover your ass
But the coffee’s delicious and free
Tired of feeling as if you don’t fit, so you just wanna quit

Both feet on the floor, headed for the door, I’ve got no more to give to your kind
Too weak to notice my two week notice?
GO FUCK YOURSELF- It’s time my time is mine
I don’t give a fuck, you’re outta luck- so don’t fucking whine

Now I’m the boss

Standing strong- deliver the freight, empowered and steering the wheel
Take it back to beginnings unfinished and complete the job, over and over again
Just forget about the time that is lost- what’s done simply can’t be undone
I said it before, and I say it now, son- WE HAVE WON

Both feet on the floor, headed for the door, I’ve got no more to give to your kind
Too weak to notice my two week notice?
GO FUCK YOURSELF- It’s time my time is mine
I don’t give a fuck, you’re outta luck- so don’t fucking whine

Over and over, the cycle repeating, you’re dying
