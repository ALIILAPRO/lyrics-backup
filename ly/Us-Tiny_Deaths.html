		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you wanna feel safe?
Do you wanna feel love?
Then you're us
Do you ever get low?
Do you ever get high?
Do you ever not know
How you're gonna get by?
Then you're us

And it got so dark
But you run from the light
Cause you don't trust
What you don't know
But it's gotta live in the day
If it's out at night

So you build a wall round what you know
And the only ones there are your own
And you're living shaking underground
And you crave the sun
But it won't be found

So you build a wall
Round what you know
Cause you wanna feel safe
I know
Cause you're us
