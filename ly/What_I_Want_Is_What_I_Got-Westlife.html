		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  all that i want in my life
is the feeling of peace
deep within me truly

i took a chance
i let go
i promised myself
that it wouldn't scare me
miracles appear i know
now i can see it show
'cause i

found out what i dreamt of
and looked it up
at this very moment
what i want is what i've got
found out what was missing
and i looked it up and
at this very moment
what i want is what i've got

life is too short
to hold back
i won't live in the past
being lonely now i know
this is the time
of my life
yes i'm sure what i want 
is what i've got

miracles appear i know
now i can see it show
'cause i

found out what i dreamt of
and i looked it up
at this very moment
what i want is what i've got
found out what was missing
and i looked it up and
at this very moment
what i want is what i've got

now i've found out what i've
been dreaming of
it's the feeling of peace deep within me
cause life is too short to hold back
i made up my mind, i just

found out what i dreamt of
and looked it up
at this very moment
what i want is what i've got
found out what was missing
and i looked it up and
at this very moment
what i want is what i've got

found out what i dreamt of
and looked it up
at this very moment
what i want is what i've got
found out what was missing
and i looked it up and
at this very moment
what i want is what i've got
