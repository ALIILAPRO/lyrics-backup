		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you want my love tell me 'bout tomorrow 
Cause I can't wait one more day 
Cold in the night waiting for a promise 
So all alone I'm hanging on 

Woman don't play this game 
You'll never get my lovin this way 
All this time you've been livin' for the moment 
It works for some, but not for me no 

[Chorus]
It's not enough, to tell me you love me 
It's not enough, to tell me that you care (Yeah) 
It's not enough, to tell me you want me 
Darlin' you know deep inside 
If you want my love, then girl you must show me 
(Not enough) Oh show me girl 

We can make it last if we hold on till tomorrow 
Or will we throw it away 
Empty words you say you want to please me 
But half a heart won't make it right 

It's not enough to tell me you love me 
It's not enough to tell me that you cried (Yeah) 
It's not enough to tell me you're sorry 
Darlin' you know deep inside 
If you want my love, then girl you must show me 
(Not enough) 

Empty words you say you want to please me 
But half a heart won't make it right no 

It's not enough to tell me you love me 
It's not enough to tell me that you care (Yeah) 
It's not enough to tell me you want me 
Darlin' you know 
Not enough to tell me you need me 
It's not enough to tell me that you cried (Yeah) 
It's not enough to tell me you're sorry 
Darlin' you know deep inside 
It's just not enough (Not enough) 

Oh, if you really want to know girl (Not enough) 
What it takes if you want my love
