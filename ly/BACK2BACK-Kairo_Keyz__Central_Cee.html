		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
G5
Yeah, oh, yeah

I hear the money calling
I hear the rolls, I'm up by the morning
She wanna feel important
Buy her Chanel, my baby look gorgeous
I want my engine roaring
I want a foreign, can't wait 'til I'm ballin'
Run to the bands, I ain't walking
Run to the money, the money's important

I hear the money calling
I hear the rolls, I'm up by the morning
She wanna feel important
Buy her Chanel, my baby look gorgeous
I want my engine roaring
I want a foreign, can't wait 'til I'm ballin'
Run to the bands, I ain't walking
Run to the money, the money's important

Baby look up at the stars and the rain
Hit the shala, I might take you to Space
She claims that she loves me but that shit is fake
But how you gon' leave for a little mistake?
My jacket eight bills, for sure it ain't fake
My new bitch she foreign, she flew to UK
I'm like my diamond, I went on my way
I'm switching this rental, it's getting too bait
I step into town, fuck a minimum wage
I'm missing my bros, free them out of the cage
Remember it was me and my bros on the stage
Cop a new train, I might fly out their face (ayy)
I'm missing my bro, man it don't feel the same (ohh, oh)
Remember when they left me out in the rain

I hear the money calling
I-I-I hear the rolls, I'm up by the morning
She wanna feel important
Buy her Chanel, my baby look gorgeous
I want my engine roaring
I want a foreign, can't wait 'til I'm ballin'
Run to the bands, I ain't walking
Run to the money, the money's important

I hear the money calling
I hear the rolls, I'm up by the morning
She wanna feel important
Buy her Chanel, my baby look gorgeous
I want my engine roaring
I want a foreign, can't wait 'til I'm ballin'
Run to the bands, I ain't walking
Run to the money, the money's important

She my lil' freak, got beat for days
I take her to Gaucho, just look how she slaying
I ain't got time to be playing no games
My bag Vuitton, my jacket Balmain
Been in the trap, oh yeah, yeah
A man like me kinda rare
I'm selling white polar bear, yeah
Telling lies over there
It was me, Reissy and us, it's a void
I'm playing my heart, man, that shit ain't a toy
Back in the day, you weren't part of the boys
I want more money than Floyd
Gucci straight out of the store
Remember the times when I couldn't afford
She suck me for time like she jawless

I-I-I hear the money calling
I hear the rolls, I'm up by the morning
She wanna feel important
Buy her Chanel, my baby look gorgeous
I want my engine roaring
I want a foreign, can't wait 'til I'm ballin'
Run to the bands, I ain't walking
Run to the money, the money's important

I hear the money calling
I hear the rolls, I'm up by the morning
She wanna feel important
Buy her Chanel, my baby look gorgeous
I want my engine roaring
I want a foreign, can't wait 'til I'm ballin'
Run to the bands, I ain't walking
Run to the money, the money's important

I hear the money calling (ohh, oh)
I-I hear the money calling (oh, oh)
I-I-I hear the money calling
I hear the money calling
