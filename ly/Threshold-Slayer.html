		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want to see, I don't want to hear
I don't want to feel anything can't you understand
Everything I do doesn't stem from you
It doesn't have a fucking thing to do with you
I just want to die throw it all away
Never have to feel again the way you make me
Lose my fuckin' mind all the fuckin' time
Can't control the violence that's spewing from me
Take it

I can't control the rage that flows from me
I can't shut it down it overwhelms me
I can't stop the rage that flows from me

Can't stop the
Violence I love it
No one's immune to hate that flows from it
Infectious I feed on it
Every fucking endless day
You're either on my side or else 
You're in my way

No one stands a chance when I'm lashing out
Random hate there is no other way
It's my discipline it's my way of life 

Never wanted bliss never wanted you
Never needed anyone I've polluted
Everything you feel everything you are
Everything you'll ever be you repulse me
It's always about you always come at me
With shit I can't identify you know it makes me
Lose my fuckin' mind all the fuckin' time
Can't control the violence that's spewing from me

Take it
Can't stop the
Violence I love it
No one's immune to hate that flows from it

Infectious I feed on it
Every fucking endless day
You're either on my side or else you're in my way
No one stands a chance when I'm lashing out
Random hate there is no other way
It's my discipline it's my way of life
