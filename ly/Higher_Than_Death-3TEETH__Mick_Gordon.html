		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stripped of all our nature
Turned into a creature
Lost our self, seal the mouth
And now we'll never see her

I watched it fall today
They took it all away
How'd they think we could live so small?
Fed with scraps of hate and pain

I'm higher than death
Than death
Now I'm higher than death
I'm higher than death

How should we die?
Our beautiful freedom
Can't keep it alive when you can't find the meaning
Look at us now, beaten and bleeding
There's nothing inside, no truth and no reason
I'm higher than death

Inhale your defiance
Exhale breath of violence
We'll burn the wealth and cut ourselves
And bleed out self-reliance

They live so cowardly
Lets make their towers sway
Shake the earth, watch 'em fall
Sick and tired of apathy

I'm higher than death
Than death
Now I'm higher than death
I'm higher than death

How should we die?
Our beautiful freedom
Can't keep it alive when you can't find the meaning
Look at us now, beaten and bleeding
There's nothing inside, no truth and no reason
I'm higher than death

It's theft, everything they took from us
And left lies, lies, lies
What's left? Motherfucking selfish greed
As they let us die

How should we die?
Our beautiful freedom
Can't keep it alive when you can't find the meaning

Look at us now, beaten and bleeding
There's nothing inside, no truth and no reason
Look at us now, kicking and screaming
Just to find out it's the lies we believe in
I'm higher than death

There's a light that will never fade
Through the smoke, I can see my flame
Another breath then I fade away
Holy Mother, take me over

There's a light that will never fade
Through the smoke, I can see my flame
Another breath then I fade away
Holy Mother, take me over
I'm higher than death
