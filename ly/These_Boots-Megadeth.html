		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You keep saying you got something for me
Something you call love, but I call this
You've been missing when you said been messing
Now someone else is getting all your best

These boots are made for walking
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you

You keep lyin' when you oughta be truthin'
You keep losin' when you ought to not bet
You keep samin' when you ought to be a changin'
Know whats right is right but you ain't played right yet

These boots are made for walking
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you

You keep playing where you shouldn't be playing
And you keep thinking that you'll never get burned, ha
I just found me a brand new box of matches
What you know, she ain't got time to learn

These boots are made for walking
That's just what they'll do
And one of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you
Yeah

Are you ready boots?
Are you ready boots?
Are you ready boots?
Start walking
