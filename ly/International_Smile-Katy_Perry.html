		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Flowers in her hair, she don't care
Peach pink lips, yeah, everybody stares
You think you've seen her in a magazine
It's like she walked right out of your dreams

Black ray-bans, you know she's with the band
Passport stamps, she's cosmopolitan
Yeah, she runs the place like Penny lane
Yeah you lucky if you're on her plane

From Tokyo, to Mexico, to Rio

That girl's a trip, a one way ticket
Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she's got that one international smile
Catch her if you can
Yeah, she's so in demand
Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she's got that one international smile

She's got that, je ne sais quoi, you know it
So tr√®s chic, yeah, she's a classic
But she's footloose and so fancy free
Yeah, she dances to her own beat
'Cause she's the muse and the artist
Always leaves a trail of stardust
'Cause she's a little bit of Yoko
And she's a little bit a, oh no

From LA, Miami, to New York City

That girl's a trip, a one way ticket
Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she's got that one international smile
Catch her if you can
Yeah, she's so in demand
Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she's got that one international smile

Please fasten your seat belts
And make sure your champagne glasses are empty
We are now approaching the runway
So get ready for take off

That girl's a trip, a one way ticket
Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she's got that one international smile
Catch her if you can
Yeah, she's so in demand
Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she's got that one international smile
