		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want your Wall Street
Don't got no degree
Written on the concrete
A-C-A-B
Couldn't really tell you
What I'm tryin' to find
Everyone's so boring
Makes me wanna lose my mind

So call me up tonight
If you need somewhere to get out of the light
These days I feel like I do nothin' right
So come with me and we'll go down the line

I'm thinking of you fondly
When I'm on the train
I really hate your poetry
You hate mine the same

So call me up tonight
If you need somewhere to get out of the light
These days I feel like I do nothin' right
So come with me and we'll go down the line

These days I feel like I do nothin' right
So come with me and we'll go down the line
