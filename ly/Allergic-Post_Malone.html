		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wasted on Sunday
Erase you on Monday, allergic
Allergic
Gave in by Friday
Went straight back to sideways, allergic
Allergic

I took your pills and your drugs just to feel something else
'Cause I can't feel you no more

So sad but true
You're friends with all my demons
The only one that sees them
Too bad for you
So sad but true
Gave a hundred million reasons
But why can't you believe them?
Too bad for you

Yeah we fight and we fuck until we open the cuts
And now we're soberin' up but never sober enough, allergic
Allergic
Instead of holdin' me down you're only holding me up
It shouldn't be so hard, this is impossible love, allergic
Allergic

I took your pills and your drugs just to feel something else
'Cause I can't feel you no more

So sad but true
You're friends with all my demons
The only one that sees them
Too bad for you
So sad but true
Gave a hundred million reasons
But why can't you believe them?
Too bad for you

So sad but true
Gave a hundred million reasons
But why can't you believe them?
Too bad for you
