		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I search for something new
To leave me senseless
I look for something new
To leave me breathless
Find me under myself, killing the surface
Find me under myself

I search for something new
To leave me senseless
I live with something new
To leave me breathless
Find me under myself, killing the surface
Find me under myself

Find me in silence
Pressured to talk some more to you
Find me in hiding, alone
Pressured to wonder loose alone

Always wanna wonder how I fucking carry on
I'm just a different type of hard
Get this shit out from my heart
Way too grown to fucking blunder
Put it out and carry on
Looking this good is tough it's an art
Yeah that shit got me far
I'ma always hide from a feeling
Fuck this shit, I'm dreaming
Karma steady creeping
You just want my attention, cut you like it
You don't want me right here

But you'll find me in silence
Pressured to talk some more to you
Find me in hiding, alone
Pressured to wonder loose alone

Help me find have some piece of mind
Help me find have some piece of mind
Yeah! Find me in silence
Pressured to talk some more baby

Find me in silence
Pressured to talk some more to you
Find me in hiding, alone
Pressured to wonder loose alone
