		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have no record of brighter days
I have no record of brighter days
I have no part, I have no lines
I have no part, I have no lines

I have no record of brighter days
I have no record of brighter days
I have no part, I have no lines
I have no part, I have no lines

I have no part, brighter days
I have no record of brighter days
I have no part, I have no lines
I have no part, I have no lines

When I come home, when I calm down
I have you, and you have me, honey
When I come home, when I calm down
I have you, and you have me, honey

When I come home, when I calm down
I have you, and you have me, honey
When I come home, when I calm down
I have you, and you have me, honey

When I come home, when I come home
When I come home, you have me, honey

When I come home, when I calm down
I have you, and you have me, honey
When I come home, when I calm down
I have you, and you have me, honey

Water's wet and light is light
Got upset and now I'm doing fine
When I come home, when I calm down
I have you, and you have me, honey
