		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You saved me from the deepest blue
I saved you from you
The empty spaces
Your love replaces
I never wanted to feel again

In your room here with arms around me
Holding tight we cannot deny this
I can hear so much in the silence
So alive, the temperature is rising
Summer rain soaking into my skin
Wash away everything before you
Say the words that you've never spoken
We can be anything we want to

I breath you in my oxygen
I feel the heat as you lay by my side
The air that is getting me high
I breath you in my oxygen
Love like a flame that I burn through the night
Your oxygen keeps me alive

I breath you in my oxygen
I feel the heat as you lay by my side
The air that is getting me high
I breath you in my oxygen
Love like a flame that I burn through the night
Your oxygen keeps me alive

Lets do things we'd never do
I'm not afraid to fly
We're not human if we've not been broken
But out of this comes beautiful

In your room here with arms around me
Holding tight we cannot deny this
I can hear so much in the silence
So alive, the temperature is rising
Summer rain soaking into my skin
Wash away everything before you
Say the words that you've never spoken
We can be anything we want to

I breath you in my oxygen
I feel the heat as you lay by my side
The air that is getting me high
I breath you in my oxygen
Love like a flame that I burn through the night
Your oxygen keeps me alive

I breath you in my oxygen
I feel the heat as you lay by my side
The air that is getting me high
I breath you in my oxygen
Love like a flame that I burn through the night
Your oxygen keeps me alive
