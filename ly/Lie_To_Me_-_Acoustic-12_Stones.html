		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Our candle burns away
The ashes full of lies
I gave my soul to you
You cut me from behind

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Your scared if the truth
I'm tired a lies
Its who I am
And where you wanna be...

Don't act like an angel
Fallen again
Your no superhero
I found in the end
So lie to me once again and tell me everything will be alright
Lie to me once again and ask yourself before we say goodbye
Well goodbye...

You said you were there for me
You wouldn't let me fall
All the times I shared with you
Were you even there at all...

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Your scared of the truth
I'm tired a lies
Its who I am
And where you wanna be...

Don't act like an angel
Fallen again
Your no superhero
I found in the end
So lie to me once again and tell me everything will be alright
Lie to me once again and ask yourself before we say goodbye
Well goodbye...
Was it worth it in the end?

Why'd you have to up and run away
A million miles away
I wanna close my eyes and make believe
That I never found you
Just when I put my guard away
Its the same old story
You left me broken and betrayed
Its the same old story...

Don't act like an angel
Fallen again
Your no superhero
I found in the end
So lie to me once again and tell me everything will be alright
Lie to me once again and ask yourself before we say goodbye

Well goodbye
Was it worth it in the end?
Was it worth it in the end?
Its the same old story
Was it worth it in the end?
