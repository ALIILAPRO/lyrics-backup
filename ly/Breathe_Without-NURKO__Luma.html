		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fingertips, on my skin
I run through the memory
'Cause I don't want to believe
You'd give me up, a careless love
When all I wanted to be was someone you couldn't breathe without
Out of my sight, but you live in my mind
When all I wanted to be was someone you couldn't breathe without

Ooh, when all I wanted to be was someone you couldn't breathe without
Ooh, when all I wanted to be was someone you couldn't breathe without (without)

Ooh, when all I wanted to be was someone you couldn't breathe without 
(Wanted to be)

(Wanted to be)

When all I wanted to be was someone you couldn't breathe without
(Wanted to be)

Tell me when you felt this ending
Did you have a reason?
Can I blame it on the seasons changing?
You gave up, but I'm not done
'Cause all I wanted to be
Was someone you couldn't breathe without

Ooh, when all I wanted to be was someone you couldn't breathe without
Ooh, when all I wanted to be was someone you couldn't breathe without

Ooh, when all l wanted to be was someone you couldn't breathe without

(Wanted to be)
When all I wanted to be was someone you couldn't breathe without
(Wanted to be)
