		<p>
		  Kiss me dangerous
Been so lost without you all around me
Get anxious
Lead me
Don't look back, it's all about you

In the dark right now
Feelin' lost, but I like it
Comfort in my sins and all about me
All I got right now
Feel the taste of resentment
Simmer in my skin, it's all about

Bloodstain on my shirt
New bitch on my nerves
Old nigga got curved
Going back on my word
Damn, bitch, you so thirsty
Still don't know my worth
Still stressin' perfection
Let you all in my mental
Got me lookin' too desperate
Damn (you ain't deserve)

Broad day, sunshine
I'll find a way to fuck it up still
Can't cry about the shit that I can't change
Just my mind
Gotta get outta here
Tough crowd, I hate it
Can't stay

In the dark right now
Feelin' lost, but I like it
Comfort in my sins and all about me
All I got right now
Feel the taste of resentment
Simmer in my skin
It's all about

Bloodstain on my shirt
New bitch on my nerves
Old nigga got curved
Going back on my word
Damn, bitch, you so thirsty
Still don't know my worth
Still stressin' perfection
Let you all in my mental
Got me lookin' too desperate
Damn

It's what you say and how you do me
How I'm 'posed to trust, baby? 'Posed to love?
It ain't 'posed to hurt this way
All I need is the best of you
Baby, how I got to say it? Give me all of you

In the dark right now
Feelin' lost, but I like it
Comfort in my sins and all about me
All I got right now
Feel the taste of resentment
Simmer in my skin
It's all about

Bloodstain on my shirt
New bitch on my nerves
Old nigga got curved
Going back on my word
Damn, bitch, you so thirsty
Still don't know my worth
Still stressin' perfection
Let you all in my mental
Got me lookin' too desperate
Damn (you ain't deserve)
