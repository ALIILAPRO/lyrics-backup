		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mm-hm, yeah

Part one, why is it so hard to live?
Part two, I shouldn't have done what I did
Part three, everyone left me alone
Part four, I don't wanna live anymore

Yeah, I'd rather be a freak than somebody's puppet
Release your leash, I don't belong in the circus
They cut each my wings soon as my name was in cursive
Now I'm six feet deep, I guess my life wasn't perfect

In this film I know (I know, I know, I know, I know)
There's no happy endings (there is, there is, there is, there is)
In this film I know (I know, I know, I know, I know)
There's no happy endings (there is, there is, there is, there is)

I'm afraid they're awake
I'm cautious who I'm serenading
Summoned them by mistake
Price you pay for entertaining
Can't decide what is fake
Mercury is retrograding
How much time can I waste
Constantly feeling the same thing?

Ooh
Ooh
(Ah)

Alienate me, I'm not the one you want
(I feel so) alienated like I'm the devil's spawn
A boy with horns (yeah)
Alienate me, I'm not the one you want
(I feel so) alienated like I'm the devil's spawn
A boy with horns
Bang, bang, bang
A boy with horns
Bang, bang, bang
