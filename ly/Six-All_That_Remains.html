		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish I was free of this

I see her in my dreams
Wish that she wasn't there
But she still haunts me and I
Still feel her breath on me
Still want to taste her skin
But I know that won't kill me

Now
Still I choke on her lies
Still from her last caress or goodbye

Now all this sickens me
This 
I can't erase this from me
And now 
And everything I feel
The end of our sick 

Now
Still I feel my strength hurt
To pick, hold my head high

Now
Still I choke on her lies
I rewrite my song

Still I feel my strength hurt
To pick, hold my head high

Still I choke on her lies
I rewrite my song

I wish I was free of this
