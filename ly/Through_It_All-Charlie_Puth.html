		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You could say I lived a crazy life for a man so young
The kind that made me question my faith
Now I'm looking back just wondering where the time has gone
But I guess it's just the price you pay

I've already loved more than I thought I could love someone
I've already felt my heart break
And I've already fell so many times but I got back up
But at least I did it all my way

I've been through it all
Yeah, I've been through it all
Yeah, you won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes
God only knows I've been through it all

Growing up in this wild city you had to fight, oh yeah
Now you know why I'm not afraid, yeah
Maybe it's my recklessness that got me in trouble
But at least I did it all my way

I've been through it all
Yeah, I've been through it all
Yeah, you won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes
God only knows I've been through it all

Yeah, I've been through it all

I've been through it all
Yeah, I've been through it all
Yeah, you won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes
God only knows I've been through it all
You won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes
God only knows I've been through it all
