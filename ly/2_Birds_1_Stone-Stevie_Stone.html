		  Uh-huh 2 Birds 1 Stone
This is where they stopped
Revving up my engine, Revving up my engine
Revving up my engine, Revving up my engine
Revving up my engine, Revving up my engine
Revving up my engine
Revving I'mma make them niggas

Move mother fuckers move give me room then
2 Birds 1 Stone got my second wind
Get em up, get em up
Get em up (up)
In the building bout to tear this mother fucker up
Leaning on the track
Hollering where my dogs at
Where the bad bitches, bring them all back
Get em up, get em up
Get em up (up)
In the building bout to tear this mother fucker up

I'm back, mother fucker I'm back
Nigga don't bet with the gats
And I ran a few laps
All my limbs in tact
Got a knack and I got that crack
Who said I couldn't rap
Cut to the chase
Nigga round up nigga say it to my face
You don't want that race
Time real good but it don't hold weight
If it down hold weight then it don't make sense
Got em in a box just let me vent
Looking for the mo
Y'all niggas acting fashion
All my shit in tips nigga
All my shit be hits nigga
All my shit be tip nigga,
All my shows be havin all your hoes up on my dick nigga
All y'all hoes better sit down
Look now I'mma talk a little shit now
You can go you can tell em how whipped down
Big down your walking in the pit now
You admit now
Where they go tech no tell em greet down
I got a nigga mixed with a pit now
That jaw got the game in my grips now, now
And I ain't talking thousands
Stevie gonna bring the crowd in
Gotta go check my resume then go and put some miles in
I'm a head rocker
Rock it a capella
Somebody better tell em
Man these niggas ain't on my level make em

Move mother fuckers move give me room then
2 Birds 1 Stone got my second wind
Get em up, get em up
Get em up (up)
In the building bout to tear this mother fucker up
Leaning on the track
Hollering where my dogs at
Where the bad bitches, bring them all back
Get em up, get em up
Get em up (up)
In the building bout to tear this mother fucker up

Just look ain't hard to find me
I'm a make a couple niggas rewind me
All my life young nigga been round me
Bout time you niggas start shining
And you know them hoes be hyme
When they see the nigga on they line
These haters always whining
All the while Tech N9ne and them signed them
And I got that loud bitch, yeah
I got that loud bitch
Fuck what the haters say this swisher mix I'm taking now bitch
Ain't gonna be more questions differing, lets talk about how rich
Any body wanna compete when I got em in reach, unleash that pound shit
Bombing with my, renegade I'm a bring a nigga whip fire
Heat seeker bullets spray when I bring em out
Got a nigga pissed off and I can't lie
Roll with em unchained nigga untied
What it feel like with a some some
Up in Denmark then Hong Kong
Grown ticks gon' say that your far from
Strange Land mother fucker hit a home run
You can have that, you can hold that
All I really wanna know where my dough at
Lean picture on my track Kodak
From the middle of the map we know that
Naah
From the middle of the map bitch know that
One Stone my zone you throw back
Two clips all out reload that

Move mother fuckers move give me room then
2 Birds 1 Stone got my second wind
Get em up, get em up
Get em up (up)
In the building bout to tear this mother fucker up
Leaning on the track
Hollering where my dogs at
Where the bad bitches, bring them all back
Get em up, get em up
Get em up (up)
In the building bout to tear this mother fucker up

Revving up my engine, Revving up my engine
Revving up my engine
Revving I'mma make them niggas
