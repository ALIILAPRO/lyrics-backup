		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Young woman, share your fire with me
My heart is cold, my soul is free
I am a stranger in your land
A wandered man, call me sand

Oh sir, my fire is very small
It won't not warm thy heart at all
But thee may take me by the hand
Hold me and I'll call thee sand

Young woman, share your fire with me
My heart is cold, my soul is free
I am a stranger in your land
Wandered man, call me sand

At night when stars light up my sky
Oh sir, I dream my fire is high
Oh taste these lips sir if you can
Wandered man, I'll call thee sand

Oh sir, my fire is burning high
If it would stop sir, I would die
The shooting star has crossed my land
Wandered man, (she whispered Sand)

Young woman shared her fire with me
Now warms herself with memories
I was a stranger in her land
A wandered man, she called me sand

He was a stranger in my land
A wandered man
I called him sand
