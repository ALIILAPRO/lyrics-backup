		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been spending all this money 'cause I
Might not see the sun again
I've been smoking drugs in the slums
Have you running when
I step on the scene, I ain't mean, boy
I just ain't your friend
You been off the shit's
Off some shit that I don't reccomend
I been on my shit
That's why these women on my dick
I ain't even got a job, I get some money
Make it flip see you running like a bitch
Just chasing dreams you'll never get
And I don't need to dream
Because to me my dreams are dead
I can only make it happen
I ain't happy in the end
Just a little satisfaction
If that's all that I can get
See me dressed in my own fashion
I don't have to fuck with trends
It's OmenXI I I, the assassin
Steady clashing 'til the end
Then I'm back into the shadows where
They cannot seem to see
See, to me my life's a battle
And I'll have to face defeat
But until that fucking happens I'll
Keep rapping on these beats
And I'm repping 10 black nails
'til OmenXI I I RIP
Bitch, I started doing me
Because I lost my will to live
But I can't give into the pain because
The pain is not my friend
But it helps me feel alive
So I respect for what it is
And I tried to keep it cool
But now my patience wearing thin


My mind is in constant motion
Thoughts created by the slightest notion
I'm screaming out for hope and
The same thoughts strangle 'til I'm choking
