		  Rest my head, cause my delusion ripped me
Need a grip a little bit, cause i got nothing near me 
Now it’s kinda like a habit, i could never really understand why?

When the sun goes down, i started thinkin bout you
All the time passed by, all alone in my room
But It’s fine.
Hope you’re doin fine.

Be more realistic tho
Now she’s living in the pleasure 
While you living so low
While your pace so slow, 
While you got no glow, 
Either way you living so low…

I'm leaving cause i never gonna be there
(Maybe i’ll never hit that)
I’ll miss it, and if you do, come here
(What have we lost along the way)

I'm leaving cause i never gonna be there
(Maybe i’ll never hit that)
I’ll miss it, and if you do, come here
(What have we lost along the way)

Every time i run for you,
Coming home and felt so blue…
Looking at the white cat, i disappointed every time we had an argue…
This and that and what we’ve been through
Ruminating me with no clue
Hundred sorrys might be 
never gonna worth it
I can’t fix this, you were right,
I’m better off quit.

Be more realistic tho
Now she’s living in the pleasure 
While you living so low
While your pace so slow, 
While you got no glow, 
Either way you living so low..

I’m leaving cause i never gonna be there
(Maybe i’ll never hit that)
I’ll miss it, and if you do, come here
(What have we lost along the way)

I’m leaving cause i never gonna be there
(Maybe i’ll never hit that)
I’ll miss it, and if you do, come here
(What have we lost along the way)


It might be useless
I run over you
I’m sorry to blame you all the time

I hurt you so badly
The way that you did to me 
Things would all be better if i quit

( I’m leaving cause i never gonna be there)

I’m leaving cause i never gonna be there
(Maybe i’ll never hit that)
I’ll miss it, and if you do, come here
(What have we lost along the way)

Looking at the white cat, i disappointed every time we had an argue…
This and that and what we’ve been through
