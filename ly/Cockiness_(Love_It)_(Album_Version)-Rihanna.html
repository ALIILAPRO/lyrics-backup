		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Suck my cockiness
Lick my persuasion
Eat my words and then
Swallow your pride down, down

Place my wants and needs
Over your resistance
And then you come around
You come around
You come around (yeah)

I want you to be my sex slave
Anything that I desire
Be one with my feminine
Set my whole body on fire

Fair maiden Rihanna gate
Taking over your empire
She may be the queen of hearts
But I'ma be the queen of your body parts

No one can do you
The way that I do
Boy I want
(You)
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it

Suck my cockiness
Lick my persuasion
Eat my words and then
Swallow your pride down, down

Place my wants and needs
Over your resistance
And then you come around
You come around
You come around (yeah)

I can be your dominatrix
Just submit to my every order
Enter my diamond matrix
Devour my golden flower

Make me your priority
There's nothing above my pleasure
She may be the queen of hearts
But I'ma be the queen of your body parts

No one can do you
The way that I do
Boy I want
(You)
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it

Homie don't beat it like a bullet
Beat my drum drum
Like a drum line boogie
(I love it when you)
Dive head first if you wanna
Sink to my body
Hold me tight mister lover
(I love it when you)
Do it like I do it
Like I said
Keep it up, boy
We can do this all day
Be my Harlem
And my St. Tropez
Never found nobody
That will do ya this way

No one can do you
The way that I do
Boy I want
(You)
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
