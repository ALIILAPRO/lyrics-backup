		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been three years and six whole months since I saw your face that night
It took five seconds to fall in love and two more to make you mine
Now it's four in the morning, suns set and seven minutes with you and it's heaven
Ain't an hour that rolls by, I love you 24/7, 365
Give you my name, if you wanted to
Key to my heart if you want it too
And I hope and pray that you'll stay right here
'til we're old and gray in our last few years
I'm on a knee I just need a yes
A couple kids and a picket fence
Share the memories like an open book
Every page I read it still got me hooked
And I'm fine spending my whole life on everything you like
Is it obvious that all of this is right?
'Cause it's been three years and six whole months since I saw your face that night
It took five seconds to fall in love and two more to make you mine
Now it's four in the morning, suns set and seven minutes with you and it's heaven
Ain't an hour that rolls by, I love you 24/7, 365
I'll share the last bite of every meal
I'll wipe your tears when you're in your feels
And I'll hold you close through a thunderstorm
When it's cold at night know i'll keep you warm
'Cause I'm fine spending my whole life on everything you like
Is it obvious that all of this is right?
'Cause it's been three years and six whole months since I saw your face that night
It took five seconds to fall in love and two more to make you mine
Now it's four in the morning, suns set and seven minutes with you and it's heaven
Ain't an hour that rolls by, I love you 24/7, 365
I love you 24/7, 365
Now it's four in the morning, suns set and seven minutes with you and it's heaven
Ain't an hour that rolls by, I love you 24/7, 365
