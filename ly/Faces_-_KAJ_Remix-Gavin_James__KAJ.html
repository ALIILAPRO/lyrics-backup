		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Waking up late back in our youth
A picture in my pocket of a rose tattoo
Stood in the cold till our lips turned blue
When every little thought that I thought was you

Do you ever think about way back when
Never getting worried about where we’ve been
All of our nights spent living in sin
When every little heartstring played pretend

Oh I didn’t mean to let you go
Moved too fast when we’re falling slow
I didn’t mean to let you go

How many times do you have to lose
How many times till it gets to you
I close my eyes all I see is you
How many times can a heart get bruised
It’s an empty room
Just empty space that I’ll never use
How many faces will I lie next to
How many times till I get to you

If we could begin and press restart
Drinking it straight in a burnt out car
Wondering if there’s life on Mars
Now I’m only wondering where you are

Feels like running down a one-way street.
Where all those faces meant nothing to me
All of the stars that were left unseen
But now you’re somewhere else not next to me

Oh I didn’t mean to let you go

How many times do you have to lose
How many times till it gets to you
I close my eyes all I see is you
How many times can a heart get bruised
It’s an empty room
Just empty space that I’ll never use
How many faces will I lie next to
How many times till get to you

Oh didn’t mean to let you go
Moved too fast when we’re falling slow
I didn’t mean to let you go

How many times do you have to lose
How many times till it gets to you
I close my eyes all I see is you
How many times can a heart get bruised

Oh, It’s an empty room
Just empty space that I’ll never use
How many faces will I lie next to
How many times till get to you

It’s an empty room
Just empty space that I’ll never use
How many faces will I lie next to
How many times till get to you
