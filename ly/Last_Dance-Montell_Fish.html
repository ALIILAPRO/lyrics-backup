		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If this is my last dance
I want it to be with you
If this is my last dance
I want it to be with you

Do you hear me, love?
I'm cryin' out
Afraid of the end
I'm losing control
But should I pretend?
God, I don't know
If this is the end
I'm losin' control
Losin' control

If this is my last dance
I want it to be with you
If this is my last dance
I want it to be with you
If this is my last dance
I want it to be with you

Darlin', how could you know me so well?
And darlin', how could you know me so well?
And darlin', how could you know me so well?
And darlin', how could you know me so?

That's where I, like
I f-I fell in love with her
Like, after the first moment I've seen her
