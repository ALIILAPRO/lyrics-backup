		  Ritual, sigil hauuughh
Yeah (Hauntaholics) haaahhh (Real Haunted Mound)

Ritual, sigil
My cutter spill blood like a ritual
Ritual, sigil
Where the moon howl and the trees walk
Bitch, I still ride down empty roads
Haunted Mound, we them skinwalkers
Chop, chop, 'round the woods we haunt
Shawty, will you be my ritual?

Scarecrows, doin' rituals
Meet me by the stone where the water flows
Mounted up with my chainsaw
With my Haunted Mound bucks goin' buck, buck
Summoning, be my Sheri Moon
Buried down behind my butcher house
Cancer smoke, need forever lungs
'Round my lane, flowers don't grow
Shawty lick my dick in the graveyard
I up my fuckin' cuttеr, they like
"Aeughhhhh"
Stairs in thе forest, better run
Haunted Mound in your town, it's a ritual

Ritual, sigil
My cutter spill blood like a ritual
Ritual, sigil
Where the moon howl and the trees walk
Bitch, I still ride on empty roads
Haunted Mound, we them skinwalkers
Chop, chop, round the woods we hide
Shawty, will you be my ritual?

Haunted Mound, choppers sing
Every night is Halloween
I'm livin' for the dead
I hope they believe in me
Haunted Mound, cutters sing
Every night is Halloween
I'm livin' for the dead
I hope they believe in me

Ritual, sigil
My cutter spill blood like a ritual
Ritual, sigil
Where the moon howl and the trees walk
Bitch, I still ride on empty roads
Haunted Mound, we them skinwalkers
Chop, chop, round the woods we hide
Shawty, will you be my ritual?

Yeah, yeah! Haaauuugghhhhh!
