		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mmh, how long?
How long have you been away?
Oh, how long?
I can't find the words to say, yeah

I've kept your picture on my shelf
Only there to remind myself
Ohh, I have always cared for you
Do you still love me?

Oh, my flame
Some things will never change
I still hold your vision in my mind
Say you still love me

Oh my love
Will I ever make you see?
Ooh, that somehow
You are still a part of me, oh yeah

Maybe we can compromise
'Cause our love just can't be disguised, ohh
I have always cared for you
Do you still love me?

Oh, my flame
Some things will never change
I still hold your vision in my mind
Say you still love me

Mmh, my flame
Some things will never change
I still hold your vision in my mind
Say you still love me

Mmh, my flame
Some things will never change
I still hold your vision in my mind
Say you still love me

Oh, my flame
Some things will never change
I still hold your vision
