		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm-I'm running away
I'm-I'm running away

I pack up my bags, time to leave this place
Pick up the pieces and take them with me
Haunted by ghosts across the streets
Lost on the highway, my heart's beating quietly

Feels like I'm lost in space
The past became my casket nails
Can I fix it by another way? (The scars will shape you from the inside)

I am turning around
What's inside of you, inside of me
(I'm-I'm running away)
I am turning around
What's inside of you, inside of me
(I'm-I'm running away)

I've lost all I've got
My self anyway
I still miss the smell from the smoke of your ashtray
Give me a sign to show me the way
I promise to change and I'll just take the blame for you

Feels like I'm lost in space
The past became my casket nails
Can I fix it by another way? (The scars will shape you from the inside)

I am turning around
What's inside of you, inside of me
(I'm-I'm running away)
I am turning around
What's inside of you, inside of me
(I'm-I'm running away)

I don't know why you're running away
The scars will shape you from the inside
I don't know why you're feeling dismay
The scars will shape you from the outside

Once again you turned your back on me
I'll never be the one that you want me to be
I become the devil within
I control everything and just turn the inside out
I know you feel what I feel
Every part of you is every a part of me
I will change the way that I am
You'll wanna feel my old self again
Break these chains, so can you hear, me
Sometimes beginnings start with an end

I don't know why you're running away (I'm-I'm running away)
The scars will shape you from the inside
I don't know why you're running away
The scars will shape you from the inside
I don't know why you're feeling dismay
The scars will shape you from the outside

I am turning around
What's inside of you, inside of me
(I'm-I'm running away)
I am turning around
What's inside of you, inside of me
(I'm-I'm running away)
(I'm-I'm running away)
