		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What should I do when it's over?
Questions are blowing up all over my brain
Will it be darker or brighter?
Do I remember your name or your colors?
So I break these chains
I hold my breath but I can't believe it's real

The voices remains the same
Because we clearly not became
Something that we can be proud of
Are we the men that we used to pretend?

I know the faces around me
Are they lost and buried in my memories
And I’m looking for something more than this

Am I the man that I use to pretend?
Am I dreaming or not
Sometimes it feels like you'll never respond

The voices remains the same
Because we clearly not became
But we can try to go forward
And be the person we used to pretend

I know the faces around me
Are they lost and buried in my memories
And I’m looking for something more than this
I wish for better days
Oh, god it's such a lonely and empty place
I believe I can find my wasted memories
And will you remember me?
This world is not the best we've ever made
I wonder if I can trust in every word you said
And will you remember me?
