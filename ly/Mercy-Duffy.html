I love you
But I gotta stay true
My morals got me on my knees
I'm begging, please, stop playing games

I don't know what this is
But you've got me good
Just like you knew you would
I don't know what you do
But you do it well
I'm under your spell

You got me begging you for mercy (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Why won't you release me? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You got me begging you for mercy (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Why won't you release me? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I said release me (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Now you think that I
Will be something on the side
But you got to understand
That I need a man
Who can take my hand, yes, I do

I don't know what this is
But you got me good
Just like you knew you would
I don't know what you do
But you do it well
I'm under your spell

You got me begging you for mercy (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Why won't you release me? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You got me begging you for mercy (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Why won't you release me? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm begging you for mercy (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Why won't you release me? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'm begging you for mercy (show me some mercy, show me some mercy)
Why won't you release me? Yeah, yeah

Down on my knees

Begging you for mercy
