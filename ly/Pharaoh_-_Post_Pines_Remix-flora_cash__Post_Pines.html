		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know
Where to go
When I conquer it all
Will you stay?
Will you pray?
Will you leave me to fall?

I don't know you
I don't know you at all
But I know you
But I know you most of all

I don't know
What to do
So I'm building a wall
For the one
Will you run?
Will you leave me to fall?

I don't care
I don't care
If I'm out of my mind
Yeah
Would you know
That the slow
Might be leading the blind

Who says you're gonna hurt me in the long run
Who said you're gonna bug me on the ride home
Who said you're gonna rock me on the walk home
Who said you're gonna rub me in the dark
Who said you're gonna run me in the [?]
Who said you're rock me in the [?]
Who said you're gonna knock me in the side and
Who said you're gonna knock me in the side
