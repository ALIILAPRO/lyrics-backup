		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, you stole my line
The way that you said, "Wanna get out of here?"
You hopped up and said, "Just drive"
You knew a spot where the sky stays clear
And that sundress strap on your shoulder's fallin' down
Yeah, you sure got me figured out

I'm a sucker for small towns, roads we can ride down
Gettin' all lost on a Saturday night
I'm a fool for a full moon, you sure set the right mood
Findin' that country on the dashboard dial
Oh, if you were tryin' to get me to lean on in for a kiss
You knew just what to do
I'm a sucker for small town nights like this with a girl like you

Yeah, you sure got me good
Right where it looks like you want me to be
Out on this old truck hood
In the middle of Two Lane Town, Tennessee
And if you're tryna trick me into fallin' hard
Oh, it's lookin' good so far

I'm a sucker for small towns, roads we can ride down
Gettin' all lost on a Saturday night
I'm a fool for a full moon, you sure set the right mood
Findin' that country on the dashboard dial
Oh, if you were tryin' to get me to lean on in for a kiss
You knew just what to do
I'm a sucker for small town nights like this with a girl like you

I'm a sucker for small towns, roads we can ride down
Gettin' all lost on a Saturday night
I'm a fool for a full moon, you sure set the right mood
Findin' that country on the dashboard dial
Oh, if you were tryin' to get me to lean on in for a kiss
You knew just what to do
I'm a sucker for small town nights like this with a girl like you
