		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Super
Good
Mmm
Listen

Summer in the wintertime
Smoke back on this beat, act like it's dinnertime
Four packs, no receipt, no LoJack, hold my heat 
In case I have to throw that in the river after sinner time
Uh, I'm good, I'm good, I swear, I'm good, I ain't losing no sleep
I'm hood, I'm Wood, I'm where I wanna be, see no defeat
I pull that off the hip to shoot the shit that piss the vultures off 
The culture's in good hands, goddamn, that man is so in sync
Uh, Justin Timberlake
Seized planet, now good karma on my dinnerplate
I played the backup actor, actively soaked up that after my acumen 
Ruder master flew to interspace

Two times for niggas that ain't gon' lose
Three times for niggas that break wrong rules
One time for niggas that paid those dues
Listen, if you ain't getting it, then shame on you, on you
Girl, I'm tryna put this game on you
Might fuck around, let me scribble my name on you, on you
Seven figures, put my gang on too
Fuck it, if you don't get it, it's a shame on you

Uh, shame on
Ooh, damn, ooh, damn, you can't put the blame on
Nobody but who you see when you turn candleflame on
And that window stain show reflection, please refrain from
Projecting to protect you from accepting your name tarnished
Bitch, you ain't farted
Think you the shit, really this shit ain't for the faint hearted
Think you've been hip, then take a two piece to your brain target
Think you've been slick, the truth defines you reclining, you so lethargic
Run that fade if you hate
Uh, juice box, squeeze that Minute Maid, bust a grape
Uh, rooftop, see, that chain is lame if it break
Uh, goosebumps, leave that nigga dazed 
Put the Glock away and sock on they face, show your pain if you brave
Oops, I done did it again if you late
Uh, roots run deeper than Hussein, who rang?
I rock two chains, who bang?
I block two lanes, Wu Tang
Hop out and swing, true king, ask 'bout me

Two times for niggas that ain't gon' lose
Three times for niggas that break wrong rules
One time for niggas that paid those dues
Listen, if you ain't getting it, then shame on you, on you
Girl, I'm tryna put this game on you
Might fuck around, let me scribble my name on you, on you
Seven figures, put my gang on too
Fuck it, if you don't get it, it's a shame on you

Far more than the minimum
Finish him
Throw hands, swing back like a pendulum
To knock that racket, no Wimbledon
In a long-sleeved Pendleton
Where the palm tree, palm leaves give me shade 
Even when the fray leading brigades defending the innocent
Threw pops in the penitentiary 
Incidentally, all his sons grew up to be gentlemen
With a knack for the penciling
Could scrap with the best of them
Put one straight through your chest for them
Boy, you ain't got no business fucking with these family ties 
On my life, it's about to be a- 
Wait, hold up
Boy, we don't leave no witness 
Word to Guinness, every record that we wrecking toting pistols
It's incidental

Two times for niggas that ain't gon' lose
Three times for niggas that break wrong rules
One time for niggas that paid those dues
Listen, if you ain't getting it, then shame on you, on you
Girl, I'm tryna put this game on you
Might fuck around, let me scribble my name on you, on you
Seven figures, put my gang on too
Fuck it, if you don't get it, it's a shame on you
