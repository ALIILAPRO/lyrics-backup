		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish I'd kept you in the box
Never taken you out or dusted you off
You mirrored all of my flaws
In that reflection so blinding I was lost

Cos you know what I'm like
And you see the night time
You see me at all my worst
And I saw the same from you
I can't erase how you touched
Me and made me burn

I was only there for a one time thing
But you were worse
Than I could ever imagine
Caught me in your web promised
Everything then kept me close
A sentimental distraction
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
You promised everything
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
Yeah you took everything

I wish I'd kept you on the wall
And just admired you from afar
Let time draw over your scars
Your blood rained down
On me and made me fall

Cos I'm just the broken my heart fully open
You caught me in your sick curse
Arms stretched wide open
I clung to you choking
The air left you stole my words

I was only there for a one time thing
But you were worse than I could ever imagine
Caught me in your web promised
Everything then kept me
Close a sentimental distraction
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
You promised everything
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
Yeah you took everything

You found me
On the island of broken toys
In the noise
You picked me out for parts
Wanted something to destroy
For the boys
Now I'm left battered
And bruised from all the surgeries
You caught me up
In the rouse but I went peacefully
Guess you thought you
Had the last laugh
But I'm in your head
And there's no way back

I was only there for a one time thing
But you were worse
Than I could ever imagine
Caught me in your
Web promised everything
Then kept me close
A sentimental distraction
