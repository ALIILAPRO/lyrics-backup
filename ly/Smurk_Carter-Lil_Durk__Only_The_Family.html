		<p>
		  (Banger)
What up, nephew? Man, you know what it is
I wanna start this jawn just by sayin' man, I'm so proud of you, man
But after that, it's all about a second chance (The Melody)
And everybody, especially the real niggas
Real people from the hood, man, from the trenches, they deserve a second chance
'Cause a lot of us got caught up in the motherfuckin' math
(DJ on the beat, so it's a banger)
With these people, man, just tryna lock us up for nothin', you hear me?
So here we are now, I remember back, back, not too long ago
Me and your daddy was in the belly of the beast
And on our paperwork, it said, as our outdate, it said, "Deceased, deceased"
They thought we was gon' die in there
But look at us now, we out here thrivin', livin'
Now you out here, it's your second chance too, nephew (bang, bang, bang)

You know, money and power got the trenches united
Got some members indicted over money and violence
I was raised in the jungle with snakes, rats and some lions (yeah)
Leather Pellys for winters, dope boys and giants
Daddy took over the streets, Larry Hoover was my age
When weed was so cheap, sellin' drugs off MySpace
I'm a gangster at heart, could stop a war with my face
Mama, I said I'm sorry for puttin' you through the mind games, sorry
Only The Family the Navy (yeah)
3-Double-0 is the army (yeah)
Tell 'em re-open Barneys (yeah)
A hundred fifty on Marni (yeah)
A double cup full of lean (yeah)
I need to drink some Dasani (yeah)
'Cause my piss back yellow (yeah)
But my President white (damn)
Plus my 'Rari was white, my Rollie face was just white (white)
My uncle had his own crib, but he stay with the white
I'm in a phase of my life, I can't be praisin' the mice
My auntie prayed to the Christ (Christ) I made a way through the night (yeah)
We bred, I gave her a flight (flight), my brother stayed with a pipe (pipe)
He just ain't have it that night (dang), I hate he played with his life (dang)
His killer paid for his price (bang), I brought it straight from the dice (yeah)
Racketeering his charge, I wish he took my advice

Money is the root of all evil (yeah)
Smurk, I mean Durk, be in the trenches with his people
Cursed, I mean hurt that they just takin' all my people
Chh, baow-baow, ain't beat his case 'cause he ain't legal

Back in 2010, I went to school with a Desert Eagle
Sean John hoodie, with Shawn Carters in my Evisu's
Family treat me different, I had to walk 'round like I'm see through
Niggas treat me like family, I just told you what the streets do (damn)
Young age, I used to run the streets 'cause I'm a bad boy (damn)
Trap house my Waffle House, I trapped right off an Android (brr)
Never duck no niggas or no 12, just the landlord
Didn't have my rent, I left my bitch and she was payin' for it (bitch)
Love brodie to death, he hit that dope, but I can't stand for it (dope)
I took over the trenches for a century, I'm the man to 'em (I'm the man to 'em)
Label said, "Don't make none for the streets, just make some dance music" (cha, cha)
Said, "I can't, I gotta make shit for the streets, I'm the man to 'em'" (nah, nah)
Money over bitches, some reason I'll tend to 'em (yeah)
I ain't never listen, like fuck permission, I carry a Gen4 (Gen4)
Family in the streets, my relationship, I got a handful (yeah)
Count a million cash, I swear to God, it had my hand sore (sss, ahh)
Fuck her from the back, I had her scratchin' up the headboard (yeah)
Nutted on her lashes, I ain't gotta ask her, what she mad for? (Smurk)
Baby, what you sad for? Baby, what you sad for? (Huh?)
The Brabus truck, the one that, hmm, I paid a bag for it (hmm)
I paid cash for it, a duffel bag, boy (yeah), but too much cash'll have 'em paranoid

Money is the root of all evil (yeah)
Smurk, I mean Durk, be in the trenches with his people
Cursed, I mean hurt that they just takin' all my people
Chh, baow-baow, ain't beat his case 'cause he ain't legal
Money is the root of all evil (trenches)
Smurk, I mean Durk, be in the trenches with his people (yeah)
Cursed, I mean hurt that they just takin' all my people
Chh, baow-baow, ain't beat his case 'cause he ain't legal
