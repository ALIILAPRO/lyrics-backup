		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take seven steps back (Back)
I don’t give a damn if
A motherfucker wearing all black
Run that lip don’t know how to act
Face get smacked with a Louisville bat
Now think on that (Think on that)
Wannabe, never has been really
Wanna beef with me (Beef with me)
I chop 'em up and put they body
Parts in a ice box like JGRXXN (Like JGRXXN)
K, R, double E, P
Say hey to the brand new wave
(Brand new wave)
Keep on re-tweetin my shit I'ma remember
Who there from day one
(One) Pussy motherfucker talking shit behind
The screen for fun
I prefer jiu-jit'su, get up pussy boy
You need a gun (Pussy boy, you need a gun)

Lookin' down the barrel of my 22
I never thought it’d come to this
I bet you didn’t too
And rest in peace to all my
Kin who didn’t make it through
I see you soon as I meet my doom
I meet my doom, I me-me-me-me

Russian Roulette when I walk out the door
Enemies lurkin' like COD 4
Problems with trust 'cause I
Been there before
You neva lookin' me in the eyes when I spoke
Nothin' new under the sun
But I’m doin' it better than ever before
Wanna make a hypebeast so mad
That he wanna confront me at one of my shows
Seen them mothafuckas reppin' so flow
Spittin' no flow, hit the flow go
Bury yo' head like a dodo
There’s something special 'bout the
Morning after LSD
Trippin and fuckin’ the night away
I’m saving me from destiny lock up
All of yo' secrets and keep
Seven steps away from me

Lookin' down the barrel of my 22
I never thought it’d come to this
I bet you didn’t too
And rest in peace to all my
Kin who didn’t make it through
I see you soon as I meet my doom
I meet my doom look-look-look-look-look
Lookin’ down the barrel of my 22
I never thought it’d come to this
I bet you didn’t too
And rest in peace to all my
Kin that didn’t make it through
I see you soon as I meet my doom
I meet my doom

Look-look-look-look-look
Look-look-look-look-look
Lookin’ down the barrel of my 22
