		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I could be loud man, I could be silent
I could be young man or I could be old
I could be a gentleman, I could be violent
I could turn hot man or I could be cold
I could be just like the calm before the storm boy,
Waiting for all hell yeah to break loose
I could be innocent or I could be guilty
Doesn't mean that I don't believe in no noose
So I'm singin'

I could be rich like a wandering Gypsy
I could be poor like a fat wallet lost
I could be first man or I could come last
It's not who breaks the ribbon boy it's how you get across
I could be red blue black and white sunset
Or darkest at day boy or brightest at night
I could be the sun boy I could be the moon
I'm made up from the stars boy I'm shining so bright

So I'm singin'

I could be asleep boy or I could be awake
I could be alive and I be the walking dead
I could be ignorant or I could be informed
I could lead my life man or I could be led
I could be anything I put my mind to boy
All I gotta do is give myself half a chance
I can bring love back into my life
And share it with the world if I got some balance

So I'm singin'
