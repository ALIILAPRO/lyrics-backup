		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything, everything's cool now
I wanted you to know that I, I'm fine tonight
Why do you do that to me?
Unfair how after we done, then you care
It's like you know I, I'm fine
But why don't you remind yourself that?

Don't worry 'bout me
You should worry 'bout you, yeah, yeah
Keep doing what you do best, babe
That's loving only yourself, babe
'Cause I've been sleeping okay (No, no, no, no)
Don't worry 'bout me
You should worry 'bout you (Oh, oh)
Yeah, that's your problem, so fix it
'Cause I ain't none of your business
Now I've been sleeping okay (No, no, no, no)

Now that you hurting like hell
You see things that reminds you of me everywhere
Just know that I, I'm fine tonight
You're tryna stay in my life
Ain't got the space or the time
It's too late now, I'm moving on
I'm so unfazed, you ain't what I want, no

Don't worry 'bout me (Don't worry 'bout)
You should worry 'bout you, yeah, yeah
Keep doing what you do best, babe
That's loving only yourself, babe
'Cause I've been sleeping okay (No, no, no, no)
Don't worry 'bout me
You should worry 'bout you (Oh, oh)
Yeah, that's your problem, so fix it
'Cause I ain't none of your business
Now I've been sleeping okay (No, no, no, no)

Don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout me
You're tryna stay in my life
Ain't got the space or the time
It's too late, now I'm moving on
I'm so unfazed, you ain't what I want, no

Don't worry 'bout me (Don't you worry 'bout)
You should worry 'bout you, yeah, yeah
Keep doing what you do best, babe
That's loving only yourself, babe
'Cause I've been sleeping okay (No, no, no, no, yeah)
Don't worry 'bout me (Don't worry 'bout me)
You should worry 'bout you (Oh, oh)
Yeah, that's your problem, so fix it
'Cause I ain't none of your business
Now I've been sleeping okay (No, no, no, no)

Don't worry 'bout me
You should worry 'bout you
Worry 'bout you, worry 'bout you, worry 'bout you
Yeah, you should worry 'bout you
