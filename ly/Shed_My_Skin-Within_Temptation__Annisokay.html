		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Carry on your fire and raise your head
And everything comes to an end when hearts asunder

When you gather like birds of prey
Rejoice what is broken and turning away
There's no rest 'cause these wounds won't heal
I can't let it go, can't let it go
No matter how deep we're falling for our calling
Can't look back 'cause it leads me to nowhere
What is awaiting, I'll embrace it
In the end, all I know, I have to face it

Carry on your fire and raise your head
And save yourself from their collective projection
Carry on your fire and raise your head
And everything comes to an end when hearts asunder

Whoa, forgive me, release me, I shed my skin
This pain's awakening what lies deep within
You kill me as lightning your words strike in
Oh, everything's changing now that I shed my skin
That I shed my skin

I know Heaven is not my home
I feel like I'm choking and I'm playing their game
Oh, I can't hold on to yesterday
I cannot hold on, cannot hold on
No matter how deep we're falling, for our calling
Can't look back 'cause it leads me to nowhere
What is awaiting, I'll embrace it
In the end, all I know, I have to face it
When hearts asunder

Whoa, forgive me, release me, I shed my skin
This pain's awakening what lies deep within
Ohh-oh-ohh, you kill me as lightning your words strike in
Oh, everything's changing now that I shed my skin

We shed our skin
We don't wanna be broken, broken
We shed our skin
We don't wanna be broken, broken

(Oh, I shed my skin)
Carry on your fire and raise your head
And everything comes to an end when hearts asunder

Whoa, forgive me, release me, I shed my skin
This pain's awakening what lies deep within
Ohh-oh-ohh, you kill me, as lightning your words strike in
Oh, everything's changing now that I shed my skin

(That I shed my skin)
That I shed my skin
(That I shed my skin)
That I shed my skin
