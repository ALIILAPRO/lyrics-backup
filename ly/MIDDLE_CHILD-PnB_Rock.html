		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah
Whoa
Oh
Yeah, yeah

Mama had five boys, me, I was the middle child
By the age of thirteen, bitch, I was young and wild
Caught my first case, then I got kicked out my mama house
Got nowhere to stay, bitch I'm runnin' in your fuckin' house (bitch)
With them 30's out (yeah), fuck you talkin' 'bout? (Yeah)
Yeah, runnin' 'round the city, I swear I'm lurking out (lurking out)
Baby I'm high as shit, I'm off a percy now (percy now)
Huh, nigga run up on me, I'ma blow him down

So much cash in my jeans, Louis V, pocket wallet
Niggas hate, niggas bitches, niggas bitches, pocket watchin'
Uh, not talkin' 'bout no pistol, I'm talkin' 30's now (30's now)
Hey, 30's now, 30 bands, 30 now (hey)

Pussy nigga always talkin', why the fuck these niggas talkin'?
I don't know, pull up slow, sticks out the window, look what you started
Huh, yeah, catch a opp, better bounce out, we gon' burn him down (burn him down)
Run him down, 30 rounds, sending rounds (buck, buck, buck)
Hold up, niggas don't want no smoke
Roll up dead niggas when I smoke
Babies, she put it all in her throat
She suck my dick while I'm floatin' the Ghost
New bustdown, yeah, my wrist is on froze (ice)
These niggas is hoes, I keep me a pole
I swear these new bitches be doing the most
Slimin' like I'm drippin' snot from my nose (slatt)
You know I came from the mud with this (mud)
They never showed me no love with this (yeah)
I had to jugg and finesse, was just standing on corner
Was selling them drugs and shit (drugs)
They used to be on some other shit (uh)
Now they see me coming up and shit (uh)
I tell them leeches to suck a dick (uh)
Nowadays they see me dubbin' shit

Mama had five boys, me, I was the middle child
By the age of thirteen, bitch, I was young and wild
Caught my first case, then I got kicked out my mama house
Got nowhere to stay, bitch I'm runnin' in your fuckin' house (bitch)
With them 30's out (yeah), fuck you talkin' 'bout? (Yeah)
Yeah, runnin' 'round the city, I swear I'm lurking out (lurking out)
Baby I'm high as shit, I'm off a percy now (percy now)
Huh, nigga run up on me, I'ma blow him down

So much cash in my jeans, Louis V, pocket wallet
Niggas hate, niggas bitches, niggas bitches, pocket watchin'
Uh, not talkin' 'bout no pistol, I'm talkin' 30's now (30's now)
Hey, 30's now, 30 bands, 30 now (hey)
