		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Say a word for Jimmy Brown
He ain't got nothing at all
Not the shirt right off his back
He ain't got nothing at all
And say a word for Ginger Brown
Walks with his head down to the ground
Took the shoes right off his feet
Threw the poor boy right out in the street
And this is what he said

Oh, sweet nothin'
She ain't got nothin' at all
Oh, sweet nothin'
She ain't got nothin' at all

Say a word for Pearly May
She can't tell the night from the day
They threw her out in the street
But just like a cat, she landed on her feet
And say a word for Joana Love
She ain't got nothing at all
'Cause everyday she falls in love
And every night she falls
And when she does, she says

Oh, sweet nothin'
You know she he ain't got nothing at all, whoa-whoa
Oh, sweet nothin', yeah
She ain't got nothin' at all
Oh, let me hear you

Oh, say a word (oh, sweet nothin')
Say a word for Jimmy Brown
He ain't got nothin' at all, not a thing
Not the shirt, shirt on his back (oh, sweet nothin')
No, he ain't got nothing at all
And say a word for Ginger (oh, sweet nothin')
He walks (he ain't got nothin' at all)
With his head down to the ground 
They took the shoes (oh, sweet nothin')
Took the shoes from his feet, from his feet
And threw poor boy (he ain't got nothin' at all)
Out into the street, and then he said

Oh, sweet, sweet nothin'
She ain't got, she ain't got
She ain't got nothin' at all
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet nothin'
(Ain't got nothing at all) she ain't got
Sweet, sweet nothin' (oh, sweet nothin')
Sweet, sweet nothin' (she ain't got nothin' at all)
Uh, sweet, sweet nothin, got nothin'
Oh, sweet nothin', whoa
(Ain't got nothin' at all) sweet nothin' at all
Oh, let me hear ya

She ain't got nothin' at all
She ain't got nothin' at all
She ain't got nothin' at all
She ain't got nothin' at all
She ain't got nothin' at all, sweet nothin'
Ain't got nothin' at all, sweet, sweet nothin'
She ain't got nothin' at all
