		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You dove straight in the river
The dust spiked the air
One too many second thoughts
How couldn't you care? I guess you're right

Such a blissful existence
Life just happens, then?
It shouldn't be this easy though
I knew that you'd forget i told you man

I'd like to learn to turn my head off

It's all by the letter
I feel like it's rare
I get front and centre, but
I'll be barely there you go ahead

I'd just like to live in the moment once

It's so much furthеr but I like it there
I likе me there i like you there
