		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Good evening 
On the clock with a glock and a bag with a little weed 
Honestly 
Put the rocks and the stacks in the bag it’s a robbery 

They hate what we been doing right 
Taking what we want this life 
Fuck up out my face tonight 
Or it’s off to the heavens that you go 

All The faces I know 
They didn’t fuck with me the same when I was low 
Lessons of gold 
In the stormy days when light was nowhere close 
The faces I know 
They don’t look the same their laced with vain and coke 
That’s how it goes 
It’s their stormy day and the light is nowhere close 

Good evening 
My fading luck has really seen a thing 
The meaning 
Been searching far and wide can’t find a thing 

They hate what we been doing right 
Taking what we want this life 
Fuck up out my face tonight 
Or it’s off to the heavens that you go 

All The faces I know 
They didn’t fuck with me the same when I was low 
Lessons of gold 
In the stormy days and a light was nowhere close 
The faces I know 
They don’t look the same their laced with vain and coke 
That’s how it goes 
It’s their stormy day and the light is nowhere close 

I said last night I was talking to God 
He said don’t be scared motherfucker get on it 
I said thanks God yea I need that a lot 
It’s my state of mind that’s been keeping me hostage
