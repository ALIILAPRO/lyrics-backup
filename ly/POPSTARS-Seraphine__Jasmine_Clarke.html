		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a goddess with a blade
You're about to hear my name
Ringin' in your head, loud, loud, loud, loud
I could take it to the top
I know you don't wanna stop
When I drop it like a bad gal, gal, gal
And when I start to talk like that (like that)
Oh, you won't know how to react (react)
I'm a picture-perfect face with that wild in my veins
You can hear it in my growl, growl, growl, growl

So keep your eyes on me now
I feel like you're likin' what you see
I'm on a whole other level
I bet you wanna come and play with me
We got it all in our hands now
So can you handle what we're all about?
We're so tough, not scared to show you up
Can you feel the rush now?

Ain't nobody bringin' us
Down, down, down, down, down, down
They can try it, but we gonna wear the crown
You could go another round
Round, round, round, round, round, round
Wish you luck, but you're not bringin' us down
We go hard 'til we get it, get it
We go hard, we so in it, in it
We pop stars, only winnin', winnin' now
Ain't nobody bringin' us down, down, down, down

See, any day, I look like magic
I throw one shot and then I grab it (then I grab it)
I'm on the edge like it's a habit, ooh
So what you know about this?
And when I start to talk like that (like that)
Oh, you won't know how to react (react)
I'm on fire with a blade
You're about to hear my name
Ringin' in your head like, woah

So keep your eyes on me now
I feel like you're likin' what you see
I'm on a whole other level
I bet you wanna come and play with me
We got it all in our hands now
So can you handle what we're all about?
We're so tough, not scared to show you up
Can you feel the rush now?

Ain't nobody bringin' us
Down, down, down, down, down, down
They can try it, but we gonna wear the crown
You could go another round
Round, round, round, round, round, round
Wish you luck, but you're not bringin' us down
We go hard 'til we get it, get it
We go hard, we so in it, in it
We pop stars, only winnin', winnin' now
Ain't nobody bringin' us down, down, down, down

Ain't nobody bringin' us down, down, down, down
