		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’mma see you later
Pillow full of makeup

Bad little mama from from the ends
She wanna play pretend
She wanna play pretend
Bad-Bad little mama from from the ends
She wanna play pretend
She wanna play pretend no (Don’t play this game)

Figure your shit out before you come to me
That’s what she told me, now my baby’s gone
I chose the streets over living with you in peace
That’s how it goes, I guess that’s just how it goes

Manifestation of dreams I had since a youngin’
Meant burning all of my lovers, Girl don’t you get too involve (Get too involved)
Fuck your temptation don’t give into the sensation 
Listen I’m warning you baby (Don’t say I didn’t warn you)

Bad little mama from from the ends
She wanna play pretend
She wanna play pretend (This isn’t just another game mama)
Bad-bad little mama from from the ends
She wanna play pretend
She wanna play pretend (Don’t play those games)
Bad little mama from from the ends
She wanna play pretend
She wanna play pretend
Oh-no-no

If you get involved there’s no turning back oh
(Yeah)
I done seen lovers come and go, just thought that you should know that
Every single fairy tail ‘happily ever after’ has ended in blow back
You cooked me dinner but I’m out for the night
Guess you were right, I’m pretending I like it 

Manifestation of dreams I had since a youngin’
Meant burning all of my lovers, Girl don’t you get too involve (Get too involved)
Fuck your temptation don’t give into the sensation 
Listen I’m warning you baby (Don’t say I didn’t warn you)

Bad little mama from from the ends
She wanna play pretend
She wanna play pretend (This isn’t just another game mama)
Bad-bad little mama from from the ends
She wanna play pretend
She wanna play pretend (Don’t play those games)
Bad little mama from from the ends
She wanna play pretend
She wanna play pretend (This isn’t just another game mama)
Oh your heart’ll break mama. No

Who’s really playing pretend?
Talking about lovers again
Every time I think I’m certain, no
I begin to bring the hurting on
Look in the mirror I don’t know who’s looking back
Thought it was over but now I’m texting your friends
Like why we playing pretend?

I know a bad little boy from the ends
He’s gonna fuck your friends
He’s gonna fuck your friends
I know a bad little boy from the ends
He’s gonna fuck your friends
He’s gonna fuck your friends
