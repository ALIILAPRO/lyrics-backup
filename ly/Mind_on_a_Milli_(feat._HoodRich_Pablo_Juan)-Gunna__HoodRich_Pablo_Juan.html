		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?
Wheezy Beats
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

Mind on a motherfuckin' milli'
Ridin' with the motherfuckin' semi
Grind from the start to the finish
Pull up in the foreign, I'll park it in the trenches
It say 230 on the dash
Drivin' real fast, I'ma speed with no limit
No, we ain't going out sad
30 rounds in my bag for these fuck niggas envy

I be gettin' higher than a tree
Still stacking racks, money all that I need
Still selling pounds of that weed
I leave 'em with the bro, when I'm goin' overseas
'Fore I bust it open, shit was already reekin'
We can sip the lean, pop the X, really geekin'
And I'm rocking water like ice, I could freeze it
When your bitch land, I'ma book her at Four Seasons
Niggas hatin' on the kid for no reason
Gunna drip sauce, let her spring it like the season
Rockin' Off White when I'm walkin' in the meeting
A nigga flyin' kites down the road, they some demons
Nigga, stop caking that hoe, she a cheater
I only fuck her once or twice, then, nigga, I'ma leave her
I tried to pop a Percocet and pour me up a liter
I drop a fishscale in a bowl, let it heat up
Chanel on, still can't see us
Nigga, send 'em back, countin' money with my feet up
I been sendin' racks to my cuz on the kiosk
I'ma send that pack down the road, 'til you get out
Let that bitch stick the dope deep in her mizzouth
I been puttin' the shit up at the hizzouse
Drippin' on these bitches through a drizzought
Damn, a nigga made it out the sizzouth

Mind on a motherfuckin' milli'
Ridin' with the motherfuckin' semi
Grind from the start to the finish
Pull up in the foreign, I'll park it in the trenches
It say 230 on the dash
Drivin' real fast, I'ma speed with no limit
No, we ain't going out sad
30 rounds in my bag for these fuck niggas envy

Flyin' a jet, ride foreign, I do that
Hundred thousand worth of ice in my Louis bag
Saint Laurent, kickin' these bitches like "Who that?"
Rich nigga came from the hood, but you knew that
Ice on my neck, it look like a sleet
Plain Jane band on an iced out Patek
Don't cuff that hoe, she a freak
I'm up gettin' money, don't know how to sleep
I fucked that lil' bitch and I fucked up the sheets
Ice all over me like I was a Christmas tree
Mind on a milli', ain't thinking 'bout enemies
Shoot a nigga down like J. F. Kennedy
Sellin' chickens, you can come get a 10 piece
Jumped out the plane with the Fendi
Jumped in the foreign with the semi
Baby Draco hold a 50
Nigga, it's on me and it's in me

Mind on a motherfuckin' milli'
Ridin' with the motherfuckin' semi
Grind from the start to the finish
Pull up in the foreign, I'll park it in the trenches
It say 230 on the dash
Drivin' real fast, I'ma speed with no limit
No, we ain't going out sad
30 rounds in my bag for these fuck niggas envy
Mind on a motherfuckin' milli'
Ridin' with the motherfuckin' semi
Grind from the start to the finish
Pull up in the foreign, I'll park it in the trenches
It say 230 on the dash
Drivin' real fast, I'ma speed with no limit
No, we ain't going out sad
30 rounds in my bag for these fuck niggas envy
