		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Man down, I can't believe
This is really happening
Looking at you look through me
You can't wait to up and leave

You and I got matching scars
I never wanna be apart
Don't point your love at me like that
If you think you'll ever take it back

You tell me I'm not the one
No sign of moving on
Yeah, I know you're not heartless
Your heart was just a mess

And I don't wanna be alone
There's no sign of moving on
Yeah, you know I'm not heartless
My heart is just a mess

I think I found it hard at first
That someone thought I had some worth
Didn't know how to bring you close
Thought I was better on my own

But you and I got matching scars
I never wanna be apart
Don't point your love at me like that
If you think you'll ever take it back

You tell me I'm not the one
No sign of moving on
Yeah, I know you're not heartless
Your heart was just a mess

And I don't wanna be alone
There's no sign of moving on
Yeah, you know I'm not heartless
My heart is just a mess

A mess, you know it is a mess
You know it is a mess, you know

You tell me I'm not the one
No sign of moving on
Yeah, I know you're not heartless
Your heart is just a mess

You tell me I'm not the one
No sign of moving on
Yeah, I know you're not heartless
Your heart is just a mess

And I don't wanna be alone (be alone)
There's no sign of moving on (it's time to move on)
Yeah, you know I'm not heartless
My heart is just a mess

Heart is just a mess
Yeah, I know you're not heartless
