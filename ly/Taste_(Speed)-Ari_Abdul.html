		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want a taste of you

Baby, I'd burn this world for you
And if you leave, I'm coming too, ah-ah
You feel so cold, I'm turning blue
Where'd you go? I wish I knew, ah-ah

Come close
Want you to take
My soul

I want a taste of you
You tear my heart in two
Why do I waste my youth?
Come back, I always do

I hear you whispering my name
You're moving on but I can't change, ah-ah
It feels intoxicating
When you look at me that way, ah-ah

Come close
Want you to take
My soul

I want a taste of you
You tear my heart in two
Why do I waste my youth?
Come back, I always do

I'm begging you
Untie this noose
Want your hands 'round my neck
I'm begging you
Come be my muse
You're all that I have left

I want a taste of you
You tear my heart in two
Why do I waste my youth?
Come back, I always do

I want a taste of you
You tear my heart in two
Why do I waste my youth?
Come back, I always do
