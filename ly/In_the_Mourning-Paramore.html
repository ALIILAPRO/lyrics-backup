		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You escaped like a runaway train
Off the tracks and down again
And my heart's beating like
A steam boat tugging

All your burdens on my shoulders

And in the mourning I'll rise
In the mourning I'll let you die
In the mourning, all my worries

And now there's nothing but
Time that's wasted
And words that have no backbone
And now it seems like
The whole world's waiting

Can you hear the echoes fading?

In the mourning I'll rise
In the mourning I'll let you die
In the mourning, all my sorries

And it takes all my strength
Not to dig you up
From the ground in which you lay
The biggest part of me
You were the greatest thing
And now you're just a memory to let go of

And in the mourning I'll rise
And in the mourning I'll let you die
In the mourning, all my sorries

In the mourning I'll rise
In the mourning I'll let you die
In the mourning, all my sorries
