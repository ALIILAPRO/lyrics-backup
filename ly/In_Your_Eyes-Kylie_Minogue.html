		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What on earth am I meant to do
In this crowded place there is only you
Was gonna to leave now I have to stay
You have taken my breath away

Ooh-ooh
Is the world still spinning around (spinning around)
Ooh-ooh
I don't feel like coming down

It's in your eyes
I can tell what you're thinking
My heart is sinking too
It's no surprise
I've been watching you lately
I want to make it with you

Destiny has a funny way
When it comes and takes all your cares away
I can't think of a single thing
Other than what a beautiful state I'm in (state I'm in)

Ooh-ooh
Is the world still spinning around (spinning around)
Ooh-ooh
I don't feel like coming down

It's in your eyes
I can tell what you're thinking
My heart is sinking too
It's no surprise
I've been watching you lately
I want to make it with you (with you, with you, with you, with you)

With you, with you, with you, with you
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you (want to make it with you)
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you

Ooh-ooh
Is the world still spinning around (spinning around)
Ooh-ooh
I don't feel like coming down

It's in your eyes
I can tell what you're thinking
My heart is sinking too
It's no surprise
I've been watching you lately
I want to make it with you (want to make it with you)

It's in your eyes
I can tell what you're thinking
My heart is sinking too (my heart is sinking too)
It's no surprise
I've been watching you lately
I want to make it with you (want to make it with you)

It's in your eyes
I can tell what you're thinking
My heart is sinking too
It's no surprise (no surprise, no surprise)
I've been watching you lately
I want to make it with you

It's in your eyes
