		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No my niggas don't want peace, bitch we on attack!
"Not my blood", but my niggas like my family lil bitch we never lack!
I got 2020 vision every time that I look back!
Told myself to never make the same mistakes again!
Leave it in the past you're so much more than your regrets!
I can't kick it with no nigga now
I'm too paranoid bitch I can't even trust no preacher now
(Okay okay!)
That's why I gotta keep a heater now
I'm in a two-seater now
Michael Jackson, beat it down
Michael Jordan! three point shot, i don't ever miss
Tri-Triple K, AF1s on my fucking kicks
A couple niggas talkin down, they not stoppin' shit
I'm not 1400 but these niggas wearing Snake Skin!
And I can't take none of these drugs these niggas lace it!
And I can't fuck none of these bitches they too basic
Wish I could run from all my problems i can't face it
Avoid, faces, can't see, Lasik
(Grave hours)
Okay! okay!
No my niggas don't want peace, bitch we on attack!
"Not my blood", but my niggas like my family lil bitch we never lack!
I got 2020 vision every time that I look back!
Told myself to never make the same mistakes again!
Leave it in the past you're so much more than your regrets!
I'm so much more than my regrets
Even late at night can't get to bed
All these memories won't lay to rest
Feels like they won't leave until I'm dead
I'm just gonna keep counting up, no
Alcohol, pour it in my cup, no
I might pop a couple percs
Uh, wait
Never!
Look inside the mirror gotta get my shit together
Everyday I wake up I feel like I'm doing better!
(Better for you!)
I don't need to regret, never!
No my niggas don't want peace, bitch we on attack!
"Not my blood", but my niggas like my family lil bitch we never lack!
I got 2020 vision every time that I look back!
Told myself to never make the same mistakes again!
Leave it in the past you're so much more than your regrets!
