		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Django
Django have you always been alone?
Django
Django have you never loved again?

Love will live on oh, oh
Life must go on oh, oh 
For you cannot spend your life regretting

Django
Django you must face another day
Django
Django now your love has gone away

Once you loved her whoa, oh
Now you've lost her whoa, oh 
But you've lost her forever Django

When there are clouds in the skies and they are grey
You may be sad but remember they'll all soon pass away

Oh, Django
After the showers the sun
Will be shining

Once you loved her whoa, oh
Now you've lost her oh, oh 
But you've lost her forever Django

When there are clouds in the skies and they are grey
You may be sad but remember they'll all soon pass away

Oh, Django
After the showers the sun
Will be shining
Django
Oh, Django
You must go on
Oh, Django
