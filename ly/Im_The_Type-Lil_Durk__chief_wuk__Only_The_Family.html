		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Kill 'em, Shui)

Walk up, push a nigga shit back, we invented that
Real nigga, I ain't with the trollin' on the internet
I'm the type bump into you, see if you really into that
Been certified before a IG, fuck that blue check
I'm the type turn into the plug from the middle man
I'm the type front you what you buy, I might double that
I'm the type lampin' at the crib where your mama at
I'm the type have your baby mama bring a hundred pack

Baow-baow, chicka-chicka, you ain't think I was gon' get you, did you?
Share locations, get up on him close, it make his mental wiggle
I was fightin' attempt, I went to court, threw up my middle finger
Thug life, hit him with that Hellcat, he Suge Knight
Drink a eight of Wock' up, put my Glock up, then goodnight
I can't pop outside without my gun, nigga, then goodnight
You the type of nigga to let your mans die and don't slide
I'm the type of nigga to pop up late, I been here nine times
Threat him, run up on him, baow, I'm the messenger
Foe'nem steady tweakin' off them drugs, they poppin' Teslas
Pop his ass, then wonder, "Did I really fuck my blessin' up?"
God, you know he made do it, he tweakin' like we ain't into it, nigga

Walk up, push a nigga shit back, we invented that
Real nigga, I ain't with the trollin' on the internet
I'm the type bump into you, see if you really into that
Been certified before a IG, fuck that blue check
I'm the type turn into the plug from the middle man
I'm the type front you what you buy, I might double that
I'm the type lampin' at the crib where your mama at
I'm the type have your baby mama bring a hundred pack

I'm the type of nigga pop out with the Glock, I let the switch talk
Turn into V. Roy while I'm on them hits, lettin' the whole clip off
These nigga pussy, man, these niggas baby food, these niggas really soft
Guide me to the toughest nigga in the room, I want the big dog
I'm a real nigga goin' on them things, I ain't never froze
Real nigga sittin' in the cell, I ain't never told
I'm the type of nigga have your main bitch out here dumpin' loads
Fuck her in a trap, that bitch got naked walkin' past them 'bows
Gotta cop the whole four-four-eight 'cause I ain't sellin' Os
Addicted to this cash, hood pharmacist, I don't never close
I don't give a fuck, rob who? Pussy, get killed
Put this Glock on your bitch-ass, then switch clips

Walk up, push a nigga shit back, we invented that
Real nigga, I ain't with the trollin' on the internet
I'm the type bump into you, see if you really into that
Been certified before a IG, fuck that blue check
I'm the type turn into the plug from the middle man
I'm the type front you what you buy, I might double that
I'm the type lampin' at the crib where your mama at
I'm the type have your baby mama bring a hundred pack
