		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Grrah-grrah, boom every opp shot
(War's too nasty) everything dead
Gang, gang, gang

They know Kenzo be buggin' and shit, like
Niggas be bluffin' and shit, like
They know me and Pdot make it
Hot, bitch if we clutching
We uppin' the knocks
Niggas really don't be on they
Block, if they was outside
Niggas would've got dropped
I'ma back out my chop if a Gz in
The spot, if the gun jam up
He get beat with the Glock
And these niggas pussy
Don't rap what they live
We gon' rap about shit that we did
Send shots, get close, knock off his wig
Fuck the dissin', we really do hit's
And this for the opp niggas runnin' they lips
Tryna spin, i'ma throw out thе whip
He parked out the gatеs
He just walked in and slipped
Mezzy flocked it, and emptied the clip
The stitchy is on me, it's stuck to my hip
So don't run, lil' nigga, don't trip
Bitch, I'm into spinnin'
Blitzin' with the blick
Sha Gz not 'ootin', that nigga a bitch
He said know it's him when
I look at his dreads
If I see him, I'm aimin' for heads
Bro hopped out, send shots and they fled
Like this knock go-
Nigga fuck is a grrah-grrah? Bitch, we
Aimin' for mattas, walk ups
We don't do drive-bys
These lil' niggas, they know what we do
If we spot him, we clearing the room
Shit got litter, niggas heard was boom
Bro said, "Don't trip", new pack comin' soon
If I'm posted, I'm packin' her too
I get off a perc' and start actin' a fool
Cuzzie told me, "Chill, just keep it cool"
These niggas be mad 'cause they
Know what we do and it's true, if I see
Him, I'm clutching, I'm upping
I'm letting it boom smoking Lou, this shit
Bussin', it's punchin'
The dead opps got me on the moon
Fuck Mex, I roll him, he dead
I heard lil' Rah got shot in his head
EBK, bitch, I said what I said
They speaking on JB so everything dead
On the set, we been buggin' and boomin'
We ready to flock at a Jet
Nigga, Shex, if I spot him, I'm boomin'
I'm hitting niggas in they neck

They know Pdot be buggin' and shit, like
Why they be runnin' and shit?
Better duck when you run into me
Dump at his face when I jump out the V
I'ma shoot if he throw up the Gz
Most of these opp niggas stay on they knees
Smokin' Dubskii while i'm on they block
None of the Vatos ain't ever threw shots
Beat him down if I don't got the knocks
I told Kenzo B, "They gon' run, nigga, watch"
Movin' tact' on the Sev' with guys
The opps still be talkin'
But they tellin' lies
Like, who hotter? Y'all gotta back
Y'all still ain't do shit since
This nigga got wacked
Fuck Rah-Rah, I roll him, I'm smacked
Slide through the 8th, leave a Gz on his back
They not 'ootin', they just gettin' boomed
Luchi and Dubskii got knocked out they shoes
Know some opps that got put in the news
If they ain't dead yet
Then that pack comin' soon
If I gotta choose, you know i'ma boom
Chase pop out, tryna clear the whole room
Smokin' Mex and this shit gotta kick
Lookin' for Vatos, you know i'ma blitz, gang

Like, like grrah-grrah, boom
Every opp shot 5th to the Sev
(War's too nasty) like, like
Grrah-grrah, boom gang, gang, gang, grrah
