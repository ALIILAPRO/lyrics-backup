		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Coming from the cold
Buried under heat
Lay you on the floor
Heavy like the force between us

Cut me like a rose
Turn me like a beast
Hold me on the floor
Heavy like the force between us

I was a ghost
Hunter in flight
Kneeling

There of the heart
God undertow
Feeling

I was only falling in love
I was only falling in love
I was only falling in love

Coming from the cold
Buried under heat
Lay you on the floor
Heavy like the force between us

Cut me like a rose
Turn me like a beast
Hold you to the floor
Heavy like the force between us

But, I was a ghost
Hunter in flight
Bleeding

There of the heart
God undertow
Feeling

And I was only falling in love
I was only falling in love
I was only falling in love
I was only falling in love
I was only falling in love

Coming from the cold
Buried under heat
Lay you on the floor

I was only falling in love

Cut me like a rose
Turn me like a beast
Hold you to the floor

I was only falling in love
I was only falling in love
I was only falling in love
