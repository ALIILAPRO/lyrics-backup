		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just threw out the winning ticket
Sometimes I smoke it, then I sip it
I got one life, so I'ma live it
That is until my time is up, up, up, up
My President's a neo-Nazi
Don't listen to them, you are not free
There ain't nobody gonna stop me
Let's burn it down and light it up, up, up, up

So we jumpin' off the roof
We burn this shit 'cause it's whatever
They wanna block us from the truth
Because we're stronger when together
But I know, I know that I'm bulletproof
We ain't gonna break under the pressure, the pressure
We jumpin' off the roof
And if I die young, know the truth is forever

And if I die young, know the truth is forever, ooh
Yeah
And if I die young, know the truth is forever
It's forever

They told me get my head out of the clouds
Now we gettin' wild in the crowd
I'll be headed where I never was allowed
Until my time is up, up, up
They laugh at you, then call you a criminal
The real message is subliminal
The coming revolution will be digital
Let's burn it down and light it up, up, up, up

And so we jumpin' off the roof
We burn this shit 'cause it's whatever
They wanna block us from the truth
Because we're stronger when together
But I know, I know that I'm bulletproof
We ain't gonna break under the pressure, the pressure
We jumpin' off the roof
And if I die young, know the truth is forever

And if I die young, know the truth is forever, ooh
Yeah
And if I die young, know the truth is forever

Walkin' on the path, better watch out for the snakes
They be watchin' what you try to do, every move you make
And when they hear the truth, then they tell you that it's fake
If you listen, that decision's a mistake
This is not what it appears
No, you better listen here
They wanna separate us so they weaponize fear
If you try to talk about it, they make you disappear
It's the same shit, just a different year
But we ain't stoppin' never, never
'Cause if I die young, know the truth is forever

Yeah
And if I die young, know the truth is forever
Yeah
And if I die young, know the truth is forever

Forever
And if I die young, know the truth is forever
