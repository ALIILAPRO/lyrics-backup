		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just a Steel-Town girl on a Saturday night
Lookin' for the fight of her life
In the real time world no one sees that at all
They all say she's crazy

Lockin' rhythms to the beat of her heart
Changing woman into life
She has danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance

It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On the wire between
Will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

On the ice-filled line of sanity
It's a place most never see
It's a hard won place of mystery
You touch it but can't hold it

You work all your life for that moment in time
It could come or pass you by
It's a push of the world but there's always a chance
If the hunger stays alive

There's a cold, cold native heat
Struggling, stretching for the beat
Never stopping with her hair
Against the wind

She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On the wire between
Will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
'Cause she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

She's a maniac
Dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
