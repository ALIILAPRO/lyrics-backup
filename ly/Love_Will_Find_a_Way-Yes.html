		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You want to get close to me
The feeling so clear
But I need some time to see
Vision through my tear
You want to get next to me
I need your intrusion
I don't need to be
Blinded by confusion

Here is my heart
Waiting for you
Here is my soul
I eat at chez nous

Love will find a way
If you want it to
Love will find a way
Love will find a way for me and you
 
Love will find a way
Love will find a way
Love will find a way
Love will find a way
 
So you want to get over me
And that's how you feel
Everything you want to be
Seems so unreal
I want to be all of you
And that's the confusion
It's so hard for me
To draw a conclusion
 
Here is my heart
Waiting for you
Here is my soul
I eat at chez nous
 
Love will find a way
If you want it to
Love will find a way
Love will find a way

Love will find a way
If you want it to
Love will find a way
Love will find a way

Love will find a way
I believe that there's a way
If you want it to
Will love find a way
Love will find a way
Will love find a way
Love will find a way
