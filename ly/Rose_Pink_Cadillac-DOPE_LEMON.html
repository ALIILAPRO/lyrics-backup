		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I love the way you dance
Hmm, how you move your feet
Hmm, how you turn your head
How you look me in the eye, my girl

You're a rose pink Cadillac
And I love the way you roll
Sink your wild tiger teeth in my neck
Oh, 'til the blood flows
Life's a long ass journey
With some fool that wrote the map
Everyone's digging for the cross on the page
No one knows where it's at

'Cause I love the way you move
Love what you do
Everything you are to me
'Cause I love the way you walk
Love what you talk
Everything you do is need

Love to know how baby
I could get a chance
Just to look in your eyes
Maybe I could be your man
How you do the things you do
I don't understand
How you do that dance you do with your heart
I'll never know

You're a rose pink Cadillac
And I love the way you roll
Sink your wild tiger teeth in my neck
Oh, 'til the blood flows
Life's a long ass journey
With some fool that wrote the map
Everyone's digging for the cross on the page
No one knows where it's at

'Cause I love the way you move
Love what you do
Everything you are to me
'Cause I love the way you walk
Love what you talk
Everything you do is need

Love to know how baby
I could get a chance
Just to look in your eyes
Maybe I could be your man

'Cause I love the way you move (love to know how, baby)
Love what you do
Everything you are to me (I could get a chance)
'Cause I love the way you walk (just to look in your eyes maybe)
Love what you talk
Everything you do is need (I could be your man)
'Cause I love the way you move (love to know how, baby)
Love what you do
Everything you are to me (I could get a chance)
(Just to look in your eyes)
(Maybe I could be your man)
