		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pretty soon now
Why 'know I'm gonna make a comeback
And like the birds and the bees in the trees
It's a sure-fire smash
I'll speak 
To the masses throughout the media
And if you got anything to say to me
You can say it with cash
'Cause I got the trash and you got the cash
So baby we should get along fine
So give me all your money 
Cause I know you think I'm funny
Can't you hear me laughing
Can't you see me smile 

I'm the man
I'm the man that gave you the hula-hoop
I'm the man
I'm the man that gave you the yo-yo 

Kung fu
That was one of my good ones
Well what's a few broken bones
When we all know it's good clean fun
Skateboards
I've almost made them respectable
You see I can't always get through to you
So I go for your son
I had a giant rubber shark 
And it really made a mark
Didja looka looka lookit alla blood
Give me all your money 
Cause I know you think I'm funny
Can't you hear me laughing
Can't you see me smile 

I'm the man
I'm the man that gave you the hula-hoop
I'm the man
I'm the man that gave you the yo-yo

Right now
I think I'm gonna plan a new trend
Because the line on the graph's getting low
And we can't have that
And you think you're immune
But I can sell you anything
Anything from a thin safety pin
To a pork pie hat
Cause I got the trash and you got the cash
So baby we should get along fine
So give me all your money 
Cause I know you think I'm funny
Can't you hear me laughing
Can't you see me smile 

I'm the man
I'm the man that gave you the hula-hoop
I'm the man
I'm the man that gave you the yo-yo
