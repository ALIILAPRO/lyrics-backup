		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You’re my sweetest addiction
You’re my strongest inspiration
And I love you it’s true
There’s no mountain I could not climb
As long as you are mine
And I thank you for being you

I'll be your best friend, I'll be your guide
Whenever you need me, I'll be by your side

I love you more and more and more each day
I love you more and more and more, more than I can say

You’re my sweetest addiction
You’re my strongest inspiration
And I love you it’s true
There’s no mountain I could not climb
As long as you are mine
And I thank you for being you

Been waiting for you all my life, you are my dream come true
You're the light in the dark and sad world of mine, I’d be lost if not for you

And I love you more and more and more each day
I love you more and more and more, more than I can say

You’re my sweetest addiction
You’re my strongest inspiration
And I love you it’s true
There’s no mountain I could not climb
As long as you are mine
And I thank you for being you

I will never let you go, I will never let you go

You’re my sweetest addiction
You’re my strongest inspiration
And I love you it’s true
There’s no mountain I could not climb
As long as you are mine
And I thank you for being you
You’re my sweetest addiction
You’re my strongest inspiration
And I love you it’s true
There’s no mountain I could not climb
As long as you are mine
And I thank you for being you
