		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another year is running through my veins
Some moments wasted, some will remain
The days are getting shorter and I try to drown my fears
The shadows of the night slowly disappear

Another day to leave it all behind
Good morning life, so beautiful and bright
I'm going back in time to the days when I was young
And now it feels like life had just begun

I'm on my way home, on my way home
Yesterday seems long ago, so long ago
I'm on my way home, sending postcards home
And greetings from the eye of the storm

Another night, the curtain's coming down
I hear the silence just screaming loud
I can see the sunrise rising from the smoke
Will you be there for me, will I ever know?

I'm on my way home, on my way home
Yesterday seems long ago, so long ago
I'm on my way home, sending postcards home
And greetings from the eye of the storm

Rock the highway, Highway Star
And bring me back, just bring me back to my love

I'm on my way home, on my way home
Yesterday seems long ago, so long ago
I'm on my way home feelin' high and low
And greetings from the eye of the storm

It's been way too long
I'm still living in the eye of the storm
