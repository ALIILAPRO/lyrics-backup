		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I don't wanna believe
That maybe this is the end
I know you're kind of a tease
But is this really pretend?
Something tells me I'm wrong
But you, I never can tell
The way you drag me along
The way I put you through hell

Tell me am I insane?
Is this where we belong?
Is it pleasure or pain
How we're still hanging on?
Going out of my head
You know true love is dead
But what you said has got me hanging on

I can't help but walk through your landmines
Ten feet and I'm going outta my mind
I'm not right without you, is that so wrong?
I can't help but walk through your landmines
I'm bleeding and all I need is a sign
I'm out here and I've been waiting so long

Oh, oh-whoa, oh-whoa
You've got me hanging on
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
You've got me hanging

Maybe I'm out of luck
Maybe all of it's bad
I'm not sure why we broke up
It was the best that I had
They say it's all for the best
I think that fate is a lie
And now my hair is a mess
And you're a little bit high

Should I give it a chance?
Is it ever enough?
No more blood on our hands
No more fucking it up
Going out of my head
All the tears that I bled
And what you said has got me hanging on

I can't help but walk through your landmines
Ten feet and I'm going outta my mind
I'm not right without you, is that so wrong?
I can't help but walk through your landmines
I'm bleeding and all I need is a sign
I'm out here and I've been waiting so long

Oh, oh-whoa, oh-whoa
You've got me hanging on
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
You've got me hanging

All I need to know
Is should I stay or is it time for me to go?
I don't wanna waste another minute, no
The story's getting old
All I want to know
Is whether I should stay or is it time for me to go?

I can't help but walk through your landmines
Ten feet and I'm going outta my mind
I'm not right without you, is that so wrong?
I can't help but walk through your landmines
I'm bleeding and all I need is a sign
I'm now here and I've been waiting so long

Oh, oh-whoa, oh-whoa
You've got me hanging on
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
You've got me hanging
