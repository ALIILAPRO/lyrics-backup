		  If it ain't gang I'll burn them bridges 
If it ain't gang I'll burn them bridges
If it ain't gang I'll burn them bridges
If it ain't, if it ain't gang I'll burn them bridges (facts)
For Rack5, I'll risk it
Me plus Hunch, that's violent siblings
Sliding, ride on the opp then bill it
Get me a drop, I'll draw that bait
Tryna turn man off, broad day on the mains
Do it and dash, don't leave no trace
Ain't corn in the ends so we go up

If it ain't, if it ain't gang I'll burn them bridges (facts)
For Rack5, I'll risk it
Me plus Hunch, that's violent siblings
Sliding, ride on the opp then bill it
Get me a drop, I'll draw that bait
Tryna turn man off, broad day on the mains
Do it and dash, don't leave no trace
Ain't corn in the ends so we go up

If it ain't, if it ain't gang I'll burn them bridges (facts)
For Rack5, I'll risk it
Me plus Hunch, that's violent siblings
Sliding, ride on the opp then bill it
Get me a drop, I'll draw that bait
Tryna turn man off, broad day on the mains
Do it and dash, don't leave no trace
Ain't corn in the ends so we go up

If it ain't, if it ain't gang I'll burn them bridges (facts)
For Racks, I'll risk it
Me plus Hunch, that's violent siblings
Sliding, ride on the opp then bill it
Get me a drop, I'll draw that bait
Tryna turn man off, broad day on the mains
Do it and dash, don't leave no trace
Ain't corn in the ends so we go up

If it ain't gang I'll burn them bridges
If it ain't gang I'll, if it ain't gang I'll burn them bridges 

If it ain't, if it ain't gang I'll burn them bridges (facts)
For Rack5, I'll risk it
Me plus Hunch, that's violent siblings
Sliding, ride on the opp then bill it
Get me a drop, I'll draw that bait
Tryna turn man off, broad day on the mains
Do it and dash, don't leave no trace
Ain't corn in the ends

If it ain't, if it ain't gang I'll burn them
If it ain't, if it ain't gang I'll burn them
If it ain't, if it ain't gang I'll burn them
If it ain't, if it ain't gang I'll burn them
If it ain't, if it ain't gang I'll burn them
If it ain't, if it ain't gang I'll burn them
If it ain't, if it ain't gang I'll burn them
If it ain't, if it ain't gang I'll burn them
If it ain't, if it ain't gang I'll burn them
If it ain't, if it ain't gang I'll burn them
If it ain't, if it ain't gang I'll burn them
If it ain't, if it ain't gang I'll burn them
If it ain't, if it ain't gang I'll burn them
If it ain't, if it ain't gang I'll burn them
If it ain't, if it ain't gang I'll burn them

If it ain't gang I'll burn them, burn them bridges (facts)
For Rack5, I'll risk it
Me plus Hunch, that's violent siblings
Sliding, ride on the opp then bill it
Get me a drop, I'll draw that bait
Tryna turn man off, broad day on the mains

If it ain't gang I'll
If it ain't gang I'll burn them bridges
