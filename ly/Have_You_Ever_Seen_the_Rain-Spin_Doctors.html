		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm
I know
And it's been comin' for sometime
Where it's over, so they say
It'll rain a sunny day
I know shinnin' down like water

I want to know
Have you ever seen the rain
I want to know
Have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day

Yesterday and days before
Sun is cold and rain is hard
I know
Been that way for all my time
'Till forever on it goes
Through the circle, fast and slow
I know and it can't stop, I linger

I want to know
Have you ever seen the rain
I want to know
Have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day
