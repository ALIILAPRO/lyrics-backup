		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't say no
It's ripping me apart

In a dark room in cold sheets
I can't feel a damn thing
I lost myself
Between your legs
Your medicine is in my head
You know I'd rather be alone
But then you call me on the phone

Oh the habits of my heart
I can't say no
It's ripping me apart
You get too close
You make it hard to let you go

Yeah
I tell myself, I like that
When you tie my hands behind my back
You're confident I'll give you that
But if you love yourself, you can fuck yourself
Cause I'd rather be alone
But you're fragmented in my bones

Oh the habits of my heart
I can't say no
It's ripping me apart
You get too close
You make it hard to let you go
Oh the habits of my heart
I can't say no
It's ripping me apart
You get too close
You make it hard to let you go

I can't say no
It's ripping me apart
You get too close
