Real badman no model inna shorts
Straight jeans cut off foot pants
Everybody haffi ask where me get my Clarks
Everybody haffi ask where me get my Clarks
The leather hard

Everybody haffi ask where me get my Clarks

Clarks for the leather (yea)

Clarks for the summer
Clarks for the winter
Clarks for the sun
Clarks for the water
Me no wear Nautica (no!)

The new Wallabees hotter than sulfur
Me pattern my daddy from me was a youngster

Real badman no model inna shorts
Straight jeans cut off foot pants
Everybody haffi ask where me get my Clarks
Everybody haffi ask where me get my Clarks
The leather hard
The suede soft
Tooth brush get out the dust fast
Everybody haffi ask where me get my Clarks
Everybody haffi ask where me get my Clarks

'Member proper hygiene and don't forget
Bag of sneakers give you cheesy foot
If yuh know what me know boy 'llow the crepe
'Member pointed mouth will corn you toe
Wear the dessert Clarks for easy step
To my court that can save you boy
Your athlete's foot ah go leave you dead

Real badman no model inna shorts
Straight jeans cut off foot pants
Everybody haffi ask where me get my Clarks
Everybody haffi ask where me get my Clarks
The leather hard
The suede soft
Tooth brush get out the dust fast
Everybody haffi ask where me get my Clarks
Everybody haffi ask where me get my Clarks

Ah which colour that? Mad inna party!
Ah you alone have that style there Daddy
The queen for England haffi love off yardie
