		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You talk about your woman
I wish you could see mine
You talk about your woman
I wish you could see mine
Every time she starts to lovin'
She brings eyesight to the blind

You know her daddy gave her magic
I can tell by the way she walks
Her daddy gave her magic,
I can tell by the way she walks
Every time she start to shakin'
The dumb begin to talk

She's got the power to heal you, never fear!
She's got the power to heal you, never fear!
Just a word from her lips
And the deaf begin to hear
