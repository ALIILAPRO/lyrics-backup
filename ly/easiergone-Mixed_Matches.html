		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna take some time to try to let you know
That when you think it's fine you could be wrong

You wanna take this life
To let it show
That you can numb the pain
And let it go
And i know that you
Don't want
To make It true
But i know that it
Will always get to you

I'll let you get the most
When you don't think you know
Would you tell me that you care
About me now?
If i tell you that its off
Would you know what you want?
Do you think it's better then
Easier when it's gone?
Cause i don't think you know

Tell me that
That i could have
It all be what i wanted then
Get my back
When you think that
It could lead to your happiness
Cause i want to be what you want
Lean back on when you would know
That everything just takes some time
To let it all play out

Cause i wanna see it come to all work out
When you have your doubt
When you know that its over
And you don't wanna have it
Come to break this off
When you played your part
Telling me its for closure

You wanna take this life
To let it show
That you can numb the pain
And let it go
And i know that you
Don't want
To make It true
But i know that it
Will always get to you

I'll let you get the most
When you don't think you know
Would you tell me that you care
About me now?
If i tell you that its off
Would you know what you want?
Do you think it's better then
Easier when it's gone?
Cause i don't think you know
