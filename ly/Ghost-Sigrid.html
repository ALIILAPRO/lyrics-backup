		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't mean to get so sentimental
It's pathetic and I know it, but I can't help it
Wanted you to be just like
The architecture of the person I made in my mind
So why'd you have to go and leave the door just a little bit open?

Wherever you go
I'll follow you home
I'll always be your ghost
Look at me now
Just a shadow
Of who I once was
I know I'm not what you want, but I can't let go
Of that little moment I thought I was yours
Wherever you go
I'll follow you home
I'll always be your ghost

If all we need is love
Ooh-ooh
Then why is it so damn confusing?
If I'd known it back at the start
Would I have been so brave to give you a just place in my heart?
I savor the wounds, pretending like I'm self-soothing, oh

Wherever you go
I'll follow you home
I'll always be your ghost
Look at me now
Just a shadow
Of who I once was
And I know I'm not what you want, but I can't let go
Of that little moment I thought I was yours
Wherever you go
I'll follow you home

Now that you've closed the door that you once left open
Now, yeah
And I'm stood here wanting to knock it
But too scared to have my heart broken again, oh

Wherever you go
I'll follow you home
I'll always be your ghost
Look at me now
Just a shadow
Of who I once was
And I know I'm not what you want, but I can't let go
Of that little moment I knew I was yours
Wherever you go
I'll follow you home
I'll always be your ghost
I'll always, I'll always be your ghost
