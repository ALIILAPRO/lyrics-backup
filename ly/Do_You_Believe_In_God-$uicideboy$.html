		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "One, two, Freddy's coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, grab your crucifix
Seven, eight, gonna stay up late
Nine, ten, never sleep " fuckthepopulation

Pullin' up with the pump
Slugs that'll make you slumped
Drugs always keep me numb
Wake up in the mornin' just to pop some
Bitch, it's FUCKTHEPOPULATION
Bodies in my basement lord of the forsaken
Watchin' bitches fornicatin' (shit)
Lucifer, Beelzebub, Satan
Triple six be my language (ayy)
Smokin' on something that's flagrant (ayy)
Shootin' up something that's tainted (ayy)
Raindrops cover my dreadlocks
Mood 21 Savage, that Red Opps
Might get my face tatted with a tear drop
Shell-shocked leavin' bodies on the sidewalk

Six days 'till my death, on the seventh
Let me be lower level dwelling
Now the devil rocking FTP
Ruby setting trends, but in the end
He wants his breath to cease
Leopard print all on his body
Body hangin' off the Sphinx
Ruby got a plan involving firestorms
Thinnin' out the herd
Ruby got a plan to see the locusts swarm
Poisoning the dirt
Ruby gonna find his death and flirt
Ruby got his motherfucking heart torn
Cut up into thirds
Ruby got a broken oath, he once swore
Take him back to church
Ruby bloody fist up her skirt
