		  Goodbye, Betsy, I'm goin' away
I'm sick of you and there ain't no way
Don't want to know, don't want to see
Don't you ever bother me

Sick of hanging around your pad
Sick of your Mom and sick of your Dad
Yes and Betsy, it's sad but true
Now I'm even sick of you

No way, no way, no way
No way, no way, no way
No way for our love
No way for our love
'Cause I'm sick of you

Good bye, Betsy, I'm going away
I'm sick of you and I don't wanna stay
Don't want to know, don't want to see
Don't you ever bother me

Sick of hanging in around your pad
Sick of your mom and sick of your dad
Yes and Betsy it's sad but true
Now I'm even sick of you

No way, no way, no way
No way, no way, no way
No way for our love
No way for our love

Every evening and every day
Seem to always turn out this way
To get an end, I better find new love
Then you'll pay, then you'll pay, ain't no way
'Cause I'm sick of you

Goodbye, Betsy, I'm going away
I'm sick of you and I don't wanna stay
Don't want to know, don't want to see
Don't you ever bother me
