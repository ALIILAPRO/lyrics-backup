		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me that you miss me
That you're fucking proud and you're glad I ain't 6 feet
Doubled up the crowd, I'm allowed with my mystery
You should turn the sound real loud so you feel me
Pussy you's a clown, down bad's not a prestige
Foul on the whisky
Life that they wish me
House cost the big P
Been a loud mouth no doubt since sixteen
Run around now only flowers that they give me
I don't need no lenses
Lately I've been feeling just fine with my senses
I can't never really take 5, I'm too restless
Seeing all the fuckery just fine, I hope they meant it
Beef with me expensive
Tripping on the same old shit, you'd think they'd learned their lesson
Scarlxrd been the catalyst, that's why they're asking questions
Found out where my passion is, it's locked in my aggression
Moving like a pacifist until I split your head bitch

Ain't no fucking rest for the wicked
(No rest for a bad motherfucker, no)
Ain't no fucking rest for the wicked
(No rest for a bad motherfucker, no)
Ain't no fucking rest for the wicked
(No rest for a bad motherfucker, no)
Ain't no fucking rest for the-, uh, yeah

Started from the bottom
In my old apartment, bathroom roof was always rotten
Had to go in harder now I'll never be forgotten
Sometimes shit gets hard but that's just life, I know I got this
Pussy stays fucked in
Do that shit to cope it, ain't no joke, these Rockstar problems
In my zone I can not fold, I'm hungry never starving
Lost control and let it go, I'm crazy when I'm bossing
Who you know don't give no fucks, I'm always down to start shit
Why would they test?
Scar be on madness tatts on his neck
These niggas trash down bad, ain't a flex
Done with the sadness, I'm here for your head
Going in loud, can't hear what I said, uh
All of y'all dead, uh
I don't want next up
I'm just ascending
All of y'all dead, uh
I don't want next up
I'm just ascending

Ain't no fucking rest for the wicked
(No rest for a bad motherfucker, no)
Ain't no fucking rest for the wicked
(No rest for a bad motherfucker, no)
Ain't no fucking rest for the wicked
(No rest for a bad motherfucker, no)
Ain't no fucking rest for the-, uh, yeah

Oh-la-la, yeah
Oh-la-la, yeah
Oh-la-la
Oh-la-la (oh-lala)
Oh-la-la, yeah
Oh-la-la, yeah
Oh-la-la
Oh-la-la-la-la-la

Ain't no fucking rest for the wicked
(No rest for a bad motherfucker, no)
Ain't no fucking rest for the wicked
(No rest for a bad motherfucker, no)
Ain't no fucking rest for the wicked
(No rest for a bad motherfucker, no)
Ain't no fucking rest for the wicked
(No rest for a bad motherfucker, no)
