		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Decorate your block with red tape, foenem slidin' every day
Bunch o' hollows spittin' out the Glock
I've been servin' fiends all day, out there posted with the gang
Nigga, we was taught to get it off the block
It's a hunnid bands in the safe, now I got expensive taste
Mike Amiri jeans, fill 'em up with knots
I been on my grind every day, don't believe in takin' breaks
I ain't stoppin' 'til we chillin' at the top

Swervin' on the E-Way, I don't care if I crash in this coupe
Shit I'm thinkin' 'bout too real, might lose my mind in this coupe
Can't relapse off these drugs, man R.I.P. to Juice
We was tweakin' off them Percs, I popped my last one with you
Bond tight with my day ones, ain't tryna find no recruits
We was playin' give and take on that front line with my troops
Ayy, like who want smoke? We got plenty guns
Keep two lil' savages on X and they gon' get it done
And them hollow tips do surgery, they gon' clip his lungs
It was goin' down on the set, that's when this shit was fun
I just been ballin' on these niggas, like I'm Kendrick Nunn
Every day my birthday, bitch, it's lit, I just turned 21

Decorate your block with red tape, foenem slidin' every day
Bunch o' hollows spittin' out the Glock
I've been servin' fiends all day, out there posted with the gang
Nigga, we was taught to get it off the block
It's a hunnid bands in the safe, now I got expensive taste
Mike Amiri jeans, fill 'em up with knots
I been on my grind every day, don't believe in takin' breaks
I ain't stoppin' 'til we chillin' at the top

Ever since I stepped up in this game, I've been a bomb threat
I was in the trenches, tryna see a life beyond that
'Cause complacent niggas usually die up in they complex
Nigga, where I'm from, they turn death into a contest
Livin' by the gun, put all my trust into this compact
My niggas went to war but they ain't get no Vietnam checks
Lil' bro want his head, he tryna make his brains ooze
Lil' bitch, I'm from the Northside where they raise goons
Took losses in these streets, shit got me singin' gang blues
I've been a real nigga 'fore this shit became cool
I'm the type to switch my watch up every time I change moves
He the type to get excited 'cause he made the Shade Room

Decorate your block with red tape, foenem slidin' every day
Bunch o' hollows spittin' out the Glock
I've been servin' fiends all day, out there posted with the gang
Nigga, we was taught to get it off the block
It's a hunnid bands in the safe, now I got expensive taste
Mike Amiri jeans, fill 'em up with knots
I been on my grind every day, don't believe in takin' breaks
I ain't stoppin' 'til we chillin' at the top
