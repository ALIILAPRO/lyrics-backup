		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, yo, J, ayy, yo

Gotta grind two-fours, every day of the week
That's the reason I'm strugglin', stayin' asleep (facts)
And I love when I'm takin' wins
But I feel like shit when I lose my streak
Gotta make sure the gang and family eats
That's the reason I'm chasin' a mil' no Meek
I ain't ever been affiliated, but I got bro like he got me
Gotta grind two-fours, every day of the week
That's the reason I'm strugglin', stayin' asleep (facts)
And I love when I'm takin' wins
But I feel like shit when I lose my streak
Gotta make sure, the gang and family eats
That's the reason I'm chasin' a mil' no Meek
I ain't ever been affiliated, but I got bro like he got me

Had to grind and wait my turn
I ain't ever had olders to put me on
C-C-Can't wait 'til I see me a mil'
JBee's been hungry for way too long
And I been through so much shit
Can't you tell by the pain that I put in my songs
Bro got beef, then count me in
I'ma turn that shit to a '2v1'
Me and bro like, Ace and Mitch
He ain't ever been gang, but if they ever touch one of his
Then he promised to me that he's takin' trips
He got me, like I got him
I been juggin' from day 'til night
I can't stop 'til my paper flips
And I been verified in rap, way before Insta' gave me a tick

Gotta grind two-fours, every day of the week
That's the reason I'm strugglin', stayin' asleep (facts)
And I love when I'm takin' wins
But I feel like shit when I lose my streak
Gotta make sure the gang and family eats
That's the reason I'm chasin' a mil' no Meek
I ain't ever been affiliated, but I got bro like he got me

I ain't nuttin' like dem
I camp in the studio day 'til night cah' my grind's intense
I'm one of the hardest, to come out of my city
I swear, I don't care if they take offence (I don't)
I didn't see me a single soul
Them times, I struggled to make me a pent (that's right)
And it's either with me or not
I can't trust that yute, if he sits on a fence
Lately, I've been focused on gettin' my bread
I swear I couldn't care what a pagan says
I ain't ever been affiliated
But I bet my bro, I ain't never been wet
Huh, I don't need no ice, I still look lit in a Nike Tech
They been plottin' to take me out
But they ain't managed to find me yet

Gotta grind two-fours, every day of the week
That's the reason I'm strugglin', stayin' asleep (facts)
And I love when I'm takin' wins
But I feel like shit when I lose my streak
Gotta make sure the gang and family eats
That's the reason I'm chasin' a mil' no Meek
I ain't ever been affiliated, but I got bro like he got me
Gotta grind two-fours, every day of the week
That's the reason I'm strugglin', stayin' asleep (facts)
And I love when I'm takin' wins
But I feel like shit when I lose my streak
Gotta make sure, the gang and family eats
That's the reason I'm chasin' a mil' no Meek
I ain't ever been affiliated, but I got bro like he got me

Gotta make sure, the gang and family eats
That's the reason I'm chasin' a mil' no Meek
I ain't ever been affiliated, but I got bro like he got me
