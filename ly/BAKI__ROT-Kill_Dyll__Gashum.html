		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We are not the fuckin same
Don't compare me to no copies
No competition, Cuz I killed them like I'm Baki
Nobodies talk, all I hear is the static
Actin all hard, til they hear automatics
Pray to your God, if you got one then stop it
I'm sick of the fuckers, that talk like they got it
Talkin that shit say it once then he froze
Saying it twice, get him shot akimbos
Thirsty for cloud, like you fuckers are Hoes
Get off of my dick, lil bitch you get hosed
Leave me alone
I hate when I see that you're calling my phone
You all did me wrong
You talked down on me right inside of my home
I cut to the bone
To feel anything cause i'm always so numb
I pull out the gun and place it right inside my mafucking dome
I don't care what you say
Look into my eyes do you think I fucking play
I know 100 different ways I could take apart your face
I hope you know I'd never lack I keep a blade right on my waist okay
I do all this for fun
I got this bitch on her knees like a nun
you pussy i know if i pull up you'll run
Bitch I hope you fuckin
Rot
Rot
Rot
Rot
Rot
Rot
Rot
Bitch I hope you fuckin
Rot
Rot
Rot
Rot
Rot
Rot
Rot
Bitch I hope you fuckin
Came with the flows
Never came for the Hoes
Fame til it blows
Propane to the nose
Fuck what they think
What they say
What they know
Cocaine in the brain of the lames and the foes
Duckin n fuckin up all the fakes til they go
Mother fuckers are lucky I'm feelin great
Overdose
Can you run it I wonder
You lookin slow in the dome
Put a 40 inside of it then we wait til it blows
Wait til the fade put a Cave in his face
Mother fuckers wanted pain you God damn disgrace
Illuminati I'm catching body on body
I never thought he was salty only wanted a hobby
Shout the pastor he claiming the south
My brother in Europe Kiraw is about to take over anyways
Fuck all the clout
We make it the petty way with or without
Never came for the money only came for the woes
Rain for the funny 23s to the dome
We makin the money makin capitol
If that boy keep on cappin
I'm cappin his dome
You dirty little (Beep)
I know you love the way I spit
Fire in my lungs with the fire on my hip
You dirty little (Beep)
I know you love the way I spit
Fire in my lungs with the fire on my hip
