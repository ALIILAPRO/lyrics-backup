		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl, you give me writer's block
I'm at a loss for words
Uh, my mind's as lost as yours
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
Never seen no ass as large as yours, how much that cost?
That's what I call a Roethlissplurge
You drive me bonkers, I'm about to get my swerve on for sure
Thought I was pimpin' 'til I felt like Nas, the first 
Date 'cause I think I gave you power when I gave you flowers
In a vase, a box of chocolates, throat lozenges, cough drops and Certs
Probably shoulda never let me call that job of yours
To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Shoulda been one of the first signs that caused alert
Man, we jumped in too fast
'Cause since then I just can't be apart from her
'Cause nobody's body's awesomer
I lust her and she loves me 'cause I'm popular
But you know this ain't love

You know this ain't love, oh no (you know this ain't love)
You know this ain't love, oh no (you know this ain't love)
What is it then?
It's desperation
She's lookin' for Mr. Right (hey)
Wants me to be that guy to her
It's desperation
I can't even put up a fight (hey)
'Cause I give in at the sight of her 
And here I go again

You were obviously oblivious to me
I swore I was just invisible to you
'Til I went to the lengths I did to meet you
'Cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning
Now I'm in disbelief, I
Never knew that this could be such misery, ah
'Cause now you see nothin' but me
And I don't see nothin' but you
And I'm about to flip 'cause we are super glued in
We stuck to each others hips and we can't 
Do anything individually, we're just too cling on
Scared to be alone, can't specifically to describe it
I just can't seem to give a reason 
That's definitive, just need ya
Talkin' 'bout I live and breathe ya
And you pretend to be as mentally and physically addicted to me
As Wiz Khalifa is to reefer
Don't wanna be without you
Don't wanna be with you neither, bitch
Put me in a situation in which it's both I wish to seek, 'cause this ain't

You know this ain't love, oh no (you know this ain't love)
You know this ain't love, oh no (you know this ain't love)
What is it then?
It's desperation
She's lookin' for Mr. Right (hey)
Wants me to be that guy to her
It's desperation
I can't even put up a fight (hey)
'Cause I give in at the sight of her 
And here I go again

Just want you to myself, don't wanna share you with no one else
What the fuck you whispering for? 
You get on my nerves, you make me sick
I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz
I mean it's time that we just split and leave the 
Games behind, your frame of mind ain't the same as mine
I think you need to finish developing 
A little more mentally to get the picture
That's a negative, Alicia
I will never give the keys up
To the crib, ever again, no Visa
Not even a gift certificate from Tiffany's
You better have an epiphany, slut
Guess what? What? The lease up
I'm just mad the time it took to discover
You were using me for loot like I used you for looks
Oh, thought you was too good for me, huh? 
Yeah, toots, used to be my Carrie Underwood
I was your lumberjack
But I can't stomach this, I'm leavin' you, I'm not comin' back
She said, "The fuck with that
Where's my Louisville Slugger at?"
She grabbed that fuckin' bat and swung it at my head
I barely ducked and that's
Right when she came up with a kick to the nuts twice
Steel toe, it would of put a hundred-yard field goal through the uprights

You know this ain't love, oh no (you know this ain't love)
You know this ain't love, oh no (you know this ain't love)
What is it then?
It's desperation
She's lookin' for Mr. Right (hey)
Wants me to be that guy to her
Lord, it's desperation
I can't even put up a fight (hey)
'Cause I give in at the sight of her 
It's desperation (and here I go again)
