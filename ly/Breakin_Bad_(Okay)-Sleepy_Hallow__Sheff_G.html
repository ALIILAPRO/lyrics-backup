		  Great John on the beat by the way

You say you be getting cash, okay
What's the facts?
We gon' run up in your stash
Police on me like a rash
You say you be getting packs, okay
Got this and that
Send my shooters where you at
Guarantee you gettin' whacked, look

Cook up like I'm Walter, should've
Been on Breaking Bad, look
Step up in the room, you see the drip
Get hit with splash
She see money coming quick so she
Gon' throw that pussy fast
And I know niggas snitching for the cheese
They a rat
You know me, I'm never switching, yeah
My body different
They like, "Sleepy, you a hero
Why they paint you as a villain?"
'Cause they know my niggas elegant
Shoot up your residence
They love me in my city
Swear they treat me like the president
I ran me up a bag, up a bag, up a bag
I know they don't like it how
I came up from doing bad
Had to run me up a bag, up a bag, up a bag
Got a check like it's Nike
I just do it and never brag


You say you be getting cash, okay
What's the facts?
We gon' run up in your stash
Police on me like a rash
You say you be getting packs, okay
Got this and that
Send my shooters where you at
Guarantee you gettin' whacked, look

Guarantee you gettin' whacked
Guarantee you gettin' done up
I know some niggas patiently waiting
To catch a come-up
Now you look like a stain, once you spotted
You gotta rub off
We jump you, ain't no one-on's
You never get the one up
Move on, bitch, you can die tonight
This just a stain, hold your tongue
Shh, where the funds?
Don't play brave, don't play dumb
Jackpot tonight
Heard you got it, then I need that
I punch you, push your teeth back
Don't want to hear no feedback, nigga

Ain't no chit-chat, you shinin'
Get your shit snatched
Them windows tinted, sliding down, they
Splittin' like a Kit-Kat, look
I'm from the streets you take an L
You gotta get back
And they don't want beef, we pull
Up on 'em with Big Macs, look

You say you be getting cash, okay
What's the facts?
We gon' run up in your stash
Police on me like a rash
You say you be getting packs, okay
Got this and that
Send my shooters where you at
Guarantee you gettin' whacked

You say you be getting cash, okay
What's the facts?
We gon' run up in your stash
Police on me like a rash
You say you be getting packs, okay
Got this and that
Send my shooters where you at
Guarantee you gettin' whacked
Guarantee you gettin' whacked
