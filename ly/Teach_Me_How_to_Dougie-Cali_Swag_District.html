		  Aye! aye!
Teach me how to dougie (aye!)

They be like smooth (what?)
Can you teach me how to dougie?
You know why?
Cause all da bitches love me (aye)
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin'
And for you, you, you to back it up and dougie!

Put your arms out front, lean side to side
They gonna be on you when they see you hit dat dougie right?
Ain't nobody fuckin' with my bro from Morningside
He go by Bubba and he hit dat dance like thunder
I ain't from Dallas but I D-town boogie
I show my moves off now everybody tryna do me
I leave da functions and all the ladies tryna screw me
Now you just do you and I'm a do me (all day)
Niggas love to hate so they try to shoot me
Bitches be stuck to me I think they tryna glue me
I make the party shine bright when it start to gloomin'
This beat was bubblegum so I had to chew it

Teach me how to dougie
T-teach me how to dougie
Teach me how to dougie
T-teach me how to dougie
All my bitches love me
All my, all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me
You ain't fuckin' with my dougie!

Teach me how to dougie
T-teach me how to dougie
Teach me how to dougie
T-teach me how to dougie
All my bitches love me
All my, all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me
You ain't fuckin' with my dougie!

The name is Young!
For them dudes who don't know me
I know I'm from the west but I can teach you how to dougie!
I step up in da club and all these bitches bug me
Only nigga dancin', none of them know me
I hear this crowd screamin' like "aye! Get it Brody!"
So I'm on my shoulders and I take it real low
They like "how he do that? " he can dougie on the floor
And when dat nigga stop they like "dougie some more!"
I'm like a nigga kinda tired so, and I pass it to the bro
M-bone, show these cats how to do dat down south dance
Dat we learned a lil' too fast and bought it to the hood
And got da whole crew ass

Teach me how to dougie
T-teach me how to dougie
Teach me how to dougie
T-teach me how to dougie
All my bitches love me
All my, all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me
You ain't fuckin' with my dougie!

Teach me how to dougie
T-teach me how to dougie
Teach me how to dougie
T-teach me how to dougie
All my bitches love me
All my, all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me
You ain't fuckin' with my dougie!

Back of the party I don't really like to boogie
I'm just tryna get bent and meet a thick red bone
(Mmm) She do her dougie and all 'dem bitches hatin'
But I'm bout to escape with a bitch and head home (fuck it)
She got her friends so it's a two man and
I wanna run it even if her legs long
She like you hubby, I think she love me but
I change the subject and I do my dougie
'Cause I don't give a fuck, blow trees, get money
Me, Smooth, Heff in the back with some playboy bunnies
We gon' make 'em do da dougie in the middle of the bed
And when I asked for some head this bitch looked at me funny (die!)
Bitch you can't tell me nothin'
Starr made the beat and I just took it out the oven
I just hit the dougie when everybody clubbin'
And I hate skinny jeans cause da burner keep rubbin!

Teach me how to dougie
T-teach me how to dougie
Teach me how to dougie
T-teach me how to dougie
All my bitches love me
All my, all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me
You ain't fuckin' with my dougie!

Teach me how to dougie
T-teach me how to dougie
Teach me how to dougie
T-teach me how to dougie
All my bitches love me
All my, all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me
You ain't fuckin' with my dougie!

All my bitches love me
All my, all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me
All my, all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me
All my, all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me
You ain't fuckin' with my dougie!
