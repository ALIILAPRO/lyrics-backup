		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like most babies smell like butter
His smell smelled like no other
He was born scentless and senseless
He was born a scentless apprentice

Hey
Go away, go away

Every wet nurse refused to feed him
Electrolytes smell like semen
I promise not to sell your perfumed secrets
There are countless formulas for pressing flowers

Hey
Go away, go away
Go away

I lie in the soil and fertilize mushrooms
Leaking out gas fumes are made into perfume
You can't fire me because I quit
Throw me in the fire and I won't throw a fit

Hey
Go away, go away
Go away, go away
Go away, go away
Go away
