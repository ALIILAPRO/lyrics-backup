		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stay the night, fall in love, it's on the table
If you know, what I mean, don't be afraid, no
Lay your cards, front of me, if you're able
And you might (might), might get what you want tonight (oh)

I can't say that I, never dreamed of touchin' on you
Ain't that what wild dreams are made of? (ooh, oh yeah)
So many feelings involved
We can't pretend, don't play it off
I wanna feel everything and I want you, whoa

And I want you, babe
Ooh, and I can't lie (yeah)
And I want you, babe
If we could, then we should just
Come together, babe

You and I, it's alright, it's perfect timing (oh, for it)
You've been waitin', and I'm anxious for you to dive in (me too, uh)
I'm doin' for you, what I wouldn't do for anybody
So you might (I might), might get what you want tonight
I won't say that I, never dreamed of touchin' on you (on you)

Ain't that what wild dreams are made of? Yeah
So many feelings involved
We can't pretend, don't take it off
I wanna feel everything, I want you, oh

And I want you, babe (want you, baby)
Ooh, and I can't lie (yeah)
And I want you, babe (woo)
If we could, then we should just
Come together, babe

We should (come)
Come together, baby (oh, please come)
Oh, so don't, don't make wait, wait
We on the same page, you know ain't nothin' in the way, babe
The way that I want you, you

And I want you, babe (want you, but don't tell, no)
Ooh, and I can't lie (ooh, no)
And I want you, babe (baby)
If we could (could), then we should (should) just
Come together, babe

Ooh
Come together, babe
Come, come, yeah
