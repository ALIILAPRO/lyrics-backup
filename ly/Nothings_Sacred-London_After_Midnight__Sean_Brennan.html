		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nothing's sacred, nothing's pure, nothing's sacred anymore
Forget salvation, forget the cure 'cause nothing's sacred anymore

I've seen it all, I've seen it all before
It's such a bore, you sell your souls like whores

You've killed free will, free me of responsibility
You hope, you pray you'll be the one who's saved

But nothing's sacred, nothing's pure, nothing's sacred anymore
Forget salvation, forget the cure 'cause nothing's sacred anymore

I've asked you all, I've begged you all before
Give in to evolution but you'd rather buy absolution

You've killed free will, free me of responsibility
You hope, you pray you'll be the one who's saved

Nothing's sacred, nothing's pure, nothing's sacred anymore
Forget salvation, forget the cure 'cause nothing's sacred anymore

There's no salvation, there is no truth
We are your retribution, we are the brutal youth
We are the future, we are the past
We are your guilt tip, and we are your class

Nothing's sacred, nothing's pure, nothing's sacred anymore
Forget salvation, forget the cure 'cause nothing's sacred anymore
