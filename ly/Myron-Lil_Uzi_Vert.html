		  (Oogie Mane, he killed it)
(Supah Mario on the beat, nigga)

Stay so fresh, so clean, think they like me (like me)
I wear more Supreme than a hypebeast (than a hypebeast)
Only blue, no green don't excite me (excite me)
I could make a ho out your wifey (out your wifey)
Jeremy Scott up on my toes, act like Shockey (whoa)
Made her get down on the bottom and she top me (let's go)
Pull up extra icy, I'm not playin' hockey (bling, blaow)
Niggas think I'm weird and they don't really like me

'Cause I could fuck your bitch and fuck your mom and auntie (yeah)
Your girl's a five but your mom is a dime piece (ayy)
And your auntie, her name is Miss Connie (Miss Connie)
I got one Glock, his name Clyde, the other one named Bonnie (let's go)
These bitches, they think they dandy but they be just lyin' (be just lyin')
That lil' bitch can't throw it back, I swear that ho be tryin'
When I fuck her from the front it sound like that bitch dyin' (on God)
VVS, I need a vest, anemic my diamonds (whoa)
I swear these niggas talk shit but they really be hidin' (woo)
Had that boy bitch on my dick, that ho, she was just ridin'
Diamonds on my neck so wet, that shit look like Poseidon (so wet)
I stand on my money then my height, it turn to 9'10" (yeah)
Yeah, these niggas be bitin' (fuck)
Grra-ta, I'm not really with the fightin'
Yeah, me and her was vibin' (yeah)
Yeah (yeah)
Your bitch call me Myron (call me)

Stay so fresh, so clean, think they like me (like me)
I wear more Supreme than a hypebeast (than a hypebeast)
Only blue, no green don't excite me (excite me)
I could make a ho out your wifey (out your wifey)
Jeremy Scott up on my toes, act like Shockey (whoa)
Made her get down on the bottom and she top me (let's go)
Pull up extra icy, I'm not playin' hockey (bling, blaow)
Niggas think I'm weird and they don't really like me

Ninety thousand, that's a light band (ninety thousand) yeah (that's a light)
I can tell you, it's the real spill (I can tell you) yeah (it's the real)
Fucked your bitch just for a light bill (yeah)
Yeah, banana clip, I won't slip on the peel
And I can't slip, slip, slip, no, no, I can't miss
I got icebergs on my neck, I can sink a ship
Outer space swag, not regular, Titanic my whip
In the hood I'm not regular, I just brought my stick, baby
Oh, you think I give a fuck because I'm rich, baby?
Come on, baby, let's have sex and have a rich baby
She said, "I thought you ain't do that," well, you dismissed, baby (bye-bye)
Uh, young nigga know I ain't changed, Lil Uzi from the 6', baby (yeah)
Uh, I don't think they like me (nah)
But when I drop this song I know they'll get excited (yeah)
She was homie girl, but now that girl is my bitch (mine)
I like them girls that do that scammin' and that swipin'

I just ran up all my bands, I just ran up all my bands
I just ran up all my bands, I just ran up all my bands
She give me head, that bitch migraine (migraine)
She give me head, that bitch migraine (migraine)
She give me head, that bitch migraine (migraine)
She give me head, that bitch migraine (let's go)

Got addicted to the road, got addicted to the stress
Got addicted to the foreigns, got addicted to the racks
Man, these boys be doin' the most
And I swear that is a fact
Man, this girl wanna give me brain
Yeah, we call that bitch migraine
Yeah, we call that bitch migraine
Yeah, we call that bitch migraine (ayy, ayy)
Yeah, we call that bitch migraine
Yeah, we call that bitch migraine
Pack all my shit, then I might migrate
Anywhere you goin', know some niggas gon' hate
I don't run from shit but the damn police
All blue hunnids to wash my face, yeah

Stay so fresh, so clean, think they like me (like me)
I wear more Supreme than a hypebeast (than a hypebeast)
Only blue, no green don't excite me (excite me)
I could make a ho out your wifey (out your wifey)
Jeremy Scott up on my toes, act like Shockey (whoa)
Made her get down on the bottom and she top me (let's go)
Pull up extra icy, I'm not playin' hockey (bling, blaow)
Niggas think I'm weird and they don't really like me
