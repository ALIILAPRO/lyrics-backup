		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Tre made this beat)
(Ayy, pull up, Lam)

I'm just tryna heat the crib up with the stove lights
I'm just reminiscing 'bout my old life
We was running 'round them streets in the cold nights
Reminiscing 'bout my old life
Some nights it do be feeling like you alone, right?
Reminiscing 'bout your old life
It be feeling you gon' die
Certain shit ain't goin' right
Mansion on the hills, long way from scales
Steady tryna kill me, name ringin' bells
When you lose appeals, probably gon' tell
You done poppin' pills, it probably give you the chills
He lost fifty pounds probably in the mail
I gotta hold 'em down, shout out to the jail
Get hit up with some rounds, chopper make you frail
Shawty want a Draco, he don't want Chanel
Watch out for leeches, shootout, screechin'
Ducking polices, moving strategic
Voices, the voices, they say that I'm preaching
Went through them courses, they really ain't believe me

Watch who you call your homie (watch who you call)
Watch who you call your homie (watch who you call)
Watch who you call your homie (watch who you call)
Watch who you call your homie (watch who you)
Watch who you call your brother (watch who you call)
Watch who you call your brody (watch who you call)
Watch who you call your brody (watch who you call)
Watch who you call your brody (watch who you call)

What you was doin' with your profit money?
I said you buy a nigga chain, they say you took it from him
The same bitches tryna fuck the ones who shitted on me
Wanna see the same nigga from back then who shitted on me
Wanna see the family members who turnt up and shitted on me
Wanna see them trap niggas who got money and shitted on me
Wanna see my teachers said I won't be shit, now I'm shittin' on 'em
I was too humble, now I'm cocky with that different money (mm, mm)
You was chose, you was chose
Chose the right road, chose the right road

Watch your homie
Watch your
Watch your homie, oh
Watch your

Watch your homies, nigga
Watch your homies, nigga
Watch your homies, nigga
