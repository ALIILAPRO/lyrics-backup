		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Informer
You no say Daddy Snow me, I'll go blame
A licky boom-boom down
'Tective man says Daddy me Snow me stabbed someone down the lane
A licky boom-boom down
Informer
You no say Daddy Snow me, I'll go blame
A licky boom-boom down
'Tective man says Daddy me Snow me stabbed someone down the lane
A licky boom-boom down

Police-a them-a they come and-a they blow down me door
One him come crawl through through my window
So they put me in the back the car at the station
From that point on I reach my destination
Well the destination reached on the East Detention
Where they looked down my pants and looked up my bottom so
Informer
You no say Daddy Snow me, I'll go blame
A licky boom-boom down

Informer
You no say Daddy Snow me, I'll go blame
A licky boom-boom down
'Tective man says Daddy me Snow me stabbed someone down the lane
A licky boom-boom down
Informer
You no say Daddy Snow me, I'll go blame
A licky boom-boom down
'Tective man says Daddy me Snow me stabbed someone down the lane
A licky boom-boom down

So bigger they are they think they have more power
They're on the phone me say that on hour
Me for want to use it once and now me call me lover
Lover who'll be calling and the one Tammy
I me lovaing her heart down to my belly
Yes Daddy me Snow me, I feel cool and deadly
The one MC Shan and the one Daddy Snow
Together we are love 'em as a tornado

Informer
You no say Daddy Snow me, I'll go blame
A licky boom-boom down
'Tective man says Daddy me Snow me stabbed someone down the lane
A licky boom-boom down
Informer
You no say Daddy Snow me, I'll go blame
A licky boom-boom down
'Tective man says Daddy me Snow me stabbed someone down the lane
A licky boom-boom down

Listen for me ya better listen for me now
Listen for me ya better listen for me now
When me a-rock with a-micro-a-phone, me a-rock it steady
Yes sir Daddy me Snow me are the Article Don
But in the in and out of a dance they say, "Where you come from?"
People then say I come from Jamaica
But me born and raised in the ghetto
That's all I want you to know
Pure black people man that's all I man know
Yeah, my shoes are them tear-up and a-me toes used to show up
Where me are born in on the one Toronto, so
Informer

Informer
You no say Daddy Snow me, I'll go blame
A licky boom-boom down
'Tective man says Daddy me Snow me stabbed someone down the lane
A licky boom-boom down
Informer
You no say Daddy Snow me, I'll go blame
A licky boom-boom down
'Tective man says Daddy me Snow me stabbed someone down the lane
A licky boom-boom down
