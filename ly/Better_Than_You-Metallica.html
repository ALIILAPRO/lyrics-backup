		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I look at you, then you me
Hungry and thirsty are we
Holding the lion's share
Holding the key
Holding me back because I'm striving to be

(Better than you)

Lock horns, I push and I strive
Some how I feel more alive
Bury the need for it
Bury the seed
Bury me deep when there's no will to be

(Better than you)

Oh, can't stop this train from rolling
Oh, nothing brings me down
No, can't stop this train from rolling, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, forever only no

Oh, can't stop this train from rolling
Oh, you can't take it down
No, never stop this locomotion, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, you can't bring it down because 

(I'm better than you)

(Much better than you)

(Better than you)

Can't stop this train from rolling

Forever on and on and on
Forever on and on, on

Better than you yeah ha ha
Better than you
