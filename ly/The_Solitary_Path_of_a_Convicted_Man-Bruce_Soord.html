		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was awoken
I was shaken
And mortified
In the wake of what I'd done

We had the time
We were inseparable
Probably culpable, at least
For what we would become

Oh this path falls away from you
On this path there's just one thing I must do

I walk unaided
As I look around
Breathing in
The depths of what I'd done

All this time in the making
(You know)
It was there for the taking
So I took the bait
And prepared for them to come

Oh this path falls away from you
On this path there's one thing I must do
But yeah I know I'll follow it down
The solitary path of a convicted man
