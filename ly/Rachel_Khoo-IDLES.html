		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No tact, breaking backs
You ain't their problem if you're not paying tax
Run it over, be cool
You ain't their problem if you never went to school
I'm shaking fast
Whip crack, whip crack

They don't care about the summertime
Cheap drugs and expensive wine
They don't care about the summertime
Cheap drugs and dear dear wine

Rachel Khoo, Rachel Khoo
Let's drink to the summer time until we turn blue
I'll tear down every wall of a C-A-R-A-V-A-G-G-I-O
Just for you, it's true it's true
Whip crack, whip crack

They don't care about the summertime
Cheap drugs and expensive wine
They don't care about the summertime
Deal drugs and cheap cheap wine
Let's go, hey

My old man's a dustman
He's a sculptor by his trade
He always wears the trousers
And he carves with a hardy spade
We're sinking fast
Whip crack, whip crack, whip crack, whip crack, whip crack

They don't care about the summertime
Cheap drugs and expensive wine
They don't care about the summertime
Cheap drugs and good ol' good ol' wine

Rachel Khoo, Rachel Khoo
Rachel Khoo, Rachel Khoo
Rachel Khoo, Rachel Khoo

Rachel Khoo, Rachel Khoo
Rachel Khoo, Rachel Khoo
Rachel Khoo
