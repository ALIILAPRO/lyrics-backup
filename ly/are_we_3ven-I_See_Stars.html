		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are we even? Are we even? Are we even now?
Are we even? Are we even? Are we even now?

Up to me, is it up to me?
To untangle you from the floor?
I'm drowning in your shallow creek
And you just watch me from the shore

A storm coming from the horizon
I saw this coming for a long time
You always seem to keep things quiet
Quiet

Hollow
I hear my voice echo through you
You're hollow
Hollow
I hear my voice echo through you
You're hollow, hollow, hollow, hollow

Up to me, is it up to me?
You dangled the truth while keeping score
I'm falling from ten thousand feet
Behind your pain is so much more

A storm coming from the horizon
I know it's hard to swollen sometimes
You know it when the room goes quiet
So quiet

Hollow
I hear my voice echo through you
You're hollow
Hollow
I hear my voice echo through you
You're hollow, hollow, hollow, hollow

Do you break like glass?
Are we even now?
My world is bleeding, world is bleeding
Are we even now?
Do you break like glass?
Are we even now?
My world is bleeding, world is bleeding
We even now?

Are we even? Are we even? Are we even now?
Are we even? Are we even? Are we even now?

Are you hollow?
I hear my voice echo through you
Are you hollow?
Hollow
I hear my voice echo through you
You're hollow, hollow, hollow, hollow

Do you break like glass?
Are we even now?
The world is bleeding, world is bleeding
Are we even now?
