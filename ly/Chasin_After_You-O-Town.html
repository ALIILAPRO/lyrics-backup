		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't get enough
Of everything you are
Oh my good Lord
You got me going far

You slip out the back with your white t-shirt
And your high heels on
You turn the key
I'm beggin' please
Don't turn that engine on

And I say
I keep chasin'
I keep chasin'
I keep chasin' you

You keep me lovin'
You keep me lovin'
You keep me lovin'
All that you do

All that you do
So chasing after you

Why get by
Your head lights and your sway
Remind me to thank your mamma
For what she passed your way
And when we kiss you make me wish
I had that every day

But when it's all it takes and
I won't let you get away

I keep chasin'
I keep chasin'
I keep chasin' you

You keep me lovin'
You keep me lovin'
You keep me lovin'
All that you do

All that you do
So chasing after you

You are my liquid dream
You don't have to believe me
I know that I'm awake
'Cause my eyes can see it
Guess you are a queen so I call you Beyonce
Wigglin' your hips
With your lips like Scarlett
Looks like J. Lawrence and like Farrah Fawcett
Catch her if you can like a quarterback's girlfriend
Katy Perry everything
Miley's always tastin'
I slowed up my heart
But I can't stop chasin'

I can't keep chasin'
I can't keep chasin'
I can't keep chasin' after you

I can't keep chasin'
I can't keep chasin'
I can't keep chasin' after you, you, you, you

Why you playing hard to get
When it's as good as it can get
Do you just like the feeling, feeling
Hot damn
Me always wanting more
Better push down flat to the floor
Heart pounding in my chest
You made me a mess yeah

I keep chasin'
I keep chasin'
I keep chasin' you

You keep me lovin'
You keep me lovin'
You keep me lovin'
All that you do

All that you do

I keep chasin'
I keep chasin'
I keep chasin' you

You keep me lovin'
You keep me lovin'
You keep me lovin'
All that you do

All that you do
So chasin' after you

All that you do
Chasin' after you

All that you do
