		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know what it is that makes me love you so
I only know I never want to let you go
'Cause you started something, oh, can't you see
That ever since we met, you've had a hold on me?
It happens to be true
I only want to be with you

It doesn't matter where you go or what you do
I want to spend each moment of the day with you
Well look what has happened with just one kiss
I never knew that I could be in love like this
It's crazy but it's true
I only want to be with you

You stopped and smiled at me
Asked if I'd care to dance
I fell into your open arms
I fell into your open arms
I didn't stand a chance (I fell into your open arms, I fell into your open arms)
(I fell into your open arms, I fell into your open arms)
I didn't stand a chance (I fell into your open arms, I fell into your open arms)
(I fell into your open arms, I fell into your open arms)
I didn't stand a chance (I fell into your open arms)
I didn't stand (I fell into your open arms)

I just want to be beside you everywhere
As long as we're together honey, I don't care
'Cause you started something, oh, can't you see
That ever since we met, you've had a hold on me?
No matter what you do
I only want to be with you
