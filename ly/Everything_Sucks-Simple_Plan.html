		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It used to be fun
Now it's bringing me down
It's like everything sucks
'Cause you're not around

Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

Drive to the beach
To watch the sunset
It's pointless, I don't even like it
Don't wanna watch another movie
My favorite song
Means nothing to me
I try to medicate
I try to numb the pain
No matter what I do, it's all in vain
My heart was full of love
Now all I do is hate
I fall apart when you're so far away
Please come back to me

It used to be fun
Now it's bringing me down
It's like everything sucks
'Cause you're not around
I never ever should've
Let you run out of town
Now everything sucks
'Cause you're not around
All my friends are asking me
Why I've been acting crazy
It used to be fun
Now it's bringing me down
It's like everything sucks
'Cause you're not around

Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

We used to go out 'til the morning
But now the party's kind of boring
Went back to where
We had our first date
But now I hate the way
The food tastes
Please come back to me

It used to be fun
Now it's bringing me down
It's like everything sucks
'Cause you're not around
I never ever should've
Let you run out of town
Now everything sucks
'Cause you're not around
All my friends are asking me
Why I've been acting crazy
It used to be fun
Now it's bringing me down
It's like everything sucks
'Cause you're not around

Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Everything sucks
'Cause you're not around

Please come back to me
(Please come back to me)
Please I'm on my knees

It used to be fun
Now it's bringing me down
It's like everything sucks
'Cause you're not around
I never ever should've
Let you run out of town
Now everything sucks
'Cause you're not around

It used to be fun
Now it's bringing me down
It's like everything sucks
'Cause you're not around
I never ever should've
Let you run out of town
Now everything sucks
'Cause you're not around
All my friends are asking me
Why I've been acting crazy
It used to be fun
Now it's bringing me down
It's like everything sucks
'Cause you're not around

Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Everything sucks
'Cause you're not around
