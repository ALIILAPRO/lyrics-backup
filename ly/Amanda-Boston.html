		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Babe, tomorrow's so far away
There's something I just have to say
I don't think I could hide
What I'm feelin' inside another day
Knowin' I love you

And I, I'm getting too close again
I don't want to see it end
If I tell you tonight 
Would you turn out the lights and walk away
Knowin' I love you?

I'm gonna take you by surprise
And make you realize, Amanda
I'm gonna tell you right away
I can't wait another day, Amanda
I'm gonna say it like a man
And make you understand, Amanda
I love you

And I feel like today's the day
I'm lookin' for the words to say
Do you want to be free?
Are you ready for me to feel this way?
I don't want to lose you
So, it may be too soon, I know
The feeling takes so long to grow
If I tell you today, will you turn me away and let me go?
I don't want to lose you

I'm gonna take you by surprise
And make you realize, Amanda
I'm gonna tell you right away
I can't wait another day, Amanda
I'm gonna say it like a man
And make you understand, Amanda (oh girl)

You and I
I know that we can't wait
And I swear, I swear it's not a lie, girl
Tomorrow may be too late
You, you and I girl
We can share a life together
It's now or never
And tomorrow may be too late (oh-oh)

And, feelin' the way I do
I don't want to wait my whole life through
To say I'm in love with you
