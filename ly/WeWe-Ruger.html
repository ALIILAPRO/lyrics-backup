		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Aye, yeah
Woyo woyo woyo ahn
(Kuk that ting)

Me n'affi lie, you're an angel in a demon body
That's why me nah hesitate to screw you
She walked through the hallway with her scented body
Cologne make a man nose dey hmm
Can you move to the reggae? No be blues
S'annu yarinya
Make I suck your nunu

Me like the way that you roll it, e jigi like that
And I know that you know that me feel ya
And everybody evil, nobody holy like that
Put your hands on the pole, whine selecta (oh, yeah)
She puff cannabis smoke and she litty
She a baddie of the highest order, crazy gyal
And you know say me I dey jonze, I no dey reason like that
My brain in disorder (gimme that)

Sweet

For me
Twist
Ç'est la vie, vie
Astalavi, vi
Looking pretty

Ooh, baby
Kuku kill me

Ku, Kukuruku beat it
On her knews
She say na we we now

Olomi lara o
Olomi lara o
Omo yen ma lomi lara o
To ba lo peren
Oma kami lara ah
Omo o ma jomi lara
Sweet cute Cuban girl
She a Guantanamera
She give herself to me
And she wants me to tear her
Finish with her she tell me thank you imela (Oshey)
Imela (Oshey)
Imela

Can you move to the reggae? No be blues
S'annu yarinya
Make I suck your nunu
She puff cannabis smoke and she litty
She a baddie of the highest order, crazy gyal
And you know say me I dey jonze, I no dey reason like that
My brain in disorder (so gimme that)

Sweet
For real
For me
Twist
Ç'est la vie, vie
Astalavi', vi
Looking pretty
Me need it now
Ooh, baby
Kuku kill me
Bad gyal RiRi
Kuku kill me now
Ku, Kukuruku beat it
On her knews
She say na we we now
