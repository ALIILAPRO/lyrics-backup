		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's do it, baby
Let's do it, baby
Let's do it, do it

Even if you were a million miles away
I can still feel you in my bed
Near me, touch me, feel me
And even at the bottom of the sea
I could still hear inside my head
Telling me, touch me, feel me
And all the time, you were telling me lies, ay

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart?
Well you could try sleeping in my bed
Lonely, own me, nobody ever shut it down like you
You wore the crown, you made my body feel Heaven-bound
Why don't you hold me? Need me
I thought you told me, you'd never leave me
Looking in the sky I could see your face
Then I knew right where I fit in
Take me, make me
You know that I'll always be in love with you
Right, 'til the end, ohh

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Anybody could've told you right from the start it's 'bout to fall apart
So rather than hold on to a broken dream I'll just hold on to love
And I could find a way to make it, don't hold on too tight
I'll make it without you tonight

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you (oh, hold on)
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Oh, Lord

Have you ever tried? Have you ever
Living without my love
Have you ever tried, have you ever tried?

La, la
La-la-la-la-la, la
La, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la 
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
