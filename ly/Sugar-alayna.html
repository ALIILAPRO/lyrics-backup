		  Woke up in paradise
Found myself in your eyes
Baby I think we made it, we made it
We were loving in lowercase
But now we're seeing better days
Baby I think we made it, we made it
You're my water
You're my comfort and my saving grace
You're the colours that I try to paint
You're the sugar that my body craves (mm, mm)
You're my healer
You're the reason I don't go insane
I'm realizing more everyday
I really need you and that's okay (mm, mm)
So we ride, yeah we ride, yeah we ride
Into the light, syncing up 'til we die
Yeah we ride, yeah we ride, yeah we ride
Into the light, syncing up 'til we die
Feels good to sink in
I'm not less of a person
Maybe it's 'cause we're magic, we're magic
Couldn't lose you if I tried
And we must've tried a hundred times
Maybe it's 'cause we're magic, we're magic
You're my fire
You're setting everything up in flames
You burn my tongue when I get a taste
But I mean it in a good way (mm, mm)
You take me higher
You're the blood pumping through my veins
I'm realizing more every day
I really need you and that's okay (mm, mm)
So we ride, yeah we ride, yeah we ride
Into the light, syncing up 'til we die
Yeah we ride, yeah we ride, yeah we ride
Into the light, syncing up 'til we die
So we ride, yeah we ride, yeah we ride
Into the light, syncing up 'til we die
Yeah we ride, yeah we ride, yeah we ride
Into the light, syncing up 'til we die
