		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Frostbitten branches adorn the sky
Cold winter kisses are so divine
Slowly melting away that frigid heart that tore apart the ties

Visions of sugar plums grace your lips
You had a hunch I was in your grip
Which couldn't be more precise as the biting wind nips at the skin again

Oh, the ground is spinning slow
There on the frozen stream below
True the roads will gather snow
But stay and we'll set the night aglow

Stillness disperses across the night
A solstice as dark as the moon is bright
A quiet sliver of time
Between the aches a moment takes control

Frostbitten branches adorn the sky
Cold winter kisses are so divine
Slowly melting away that frigid heart that tore apart the ties

Oh, the ground is spinning slow
There on the frozen stream below
True the roads will gather snow
But stay and we'll set the night aglow
