Okay, I've been gettin' paid every way, tryna get it right (yeah, yeah)
I just hit the stage, forty days and forty nights
Tired for real (yeah), grindin' for real (yeah)
They say his heart is broken, but his mind on them M's (frrt)
Got out my feelings and got in my bag, okay

I just pulled up on my nigga Jigga like, "Brother we them niggas for real" (for real, brother)
I got fifty million for real (for real, brother), we come out the trenches for real (yeah)

Thank God for my freedom and my life, wish all my niggas was here (free my brother)
For my nigga TWeezie, I roll one twice and I crack a seal

Okay, I've been gettin' paid every way, tryna get it right (yeah, yeah)

Tired for real (Say, tired), grindin' for real (bitch, I grind)
They say his heart is broken, but his mind on them M's (oh, it's on my mind)
Got out my feelings and got in my bag, okay (my bag, my bag, okay)
Got out my feelings and got in my bag, okay (okay, okay, okay, okay)
Get out your feelings and get in your bag (yeah, yeah)
Get out your feelings and get you a bag (go get it)
