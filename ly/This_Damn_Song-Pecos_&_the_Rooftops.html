		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I don't want to hear the good side of this goodbye
If you want to go baby, just leave
Don't tell me that you still care
And that I'll always be special
'Cause those words don't mean a damn thing
And I hate that I'm still up, drunk as fuck
4 A.M. writing this damn song
But I guess I'm okay, not being okay
Give it time and I'll soon move on, mm

You said my life was too fucked up to be with you
But I hear you go to the bar 'til two
And I want to know what he has that I don't
Well I was ready for the real thing
No more shame in this life I live because I would change for you
Don't know the hope you gave to me
But I guess I'm okay
Just need some cocaine and a bottle that'll float my mind
Take a trip to another world where you would be mine

And I don't want to hear the good side of this goodbye
If you want to go baby, just leave
Don't tell me that you still care
And that I'll always be special
'Cause those words don't mean a damn thing
And I hate that I'm still up, drunk as fuck
4 A.M. writing this damn song
But I guess that I'm okay, not being okay
Give it time baby, I'll move on, mm

I found a couple of your long hairs in the passenger seat
Where you looked over and smiled at me
Guess a picture ain't worth as many words as they say
And don't tell me that its okay, I'll find my own way
Don't need your excuses to ease my pain
I guess it's just time for me to work on me

And I don't wanna hear the good side there ain't no good side
You ain't ever gonna see what I see
Don't tell me that you still care
And you'll always be there
'Cause those words are just messing with me
And I hate that I'm still up, drunk as fuck
4 A.M. writing this damn song
But, I guess that I'm okay, not being okay
Give it time, baby I'll move on
