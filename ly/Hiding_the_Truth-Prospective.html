		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I should have known
I should have known
That you would have betrayed
Every piece of my soul
Every piece of my soul

I can taste it, depression is coming
It’s not the first time and won’t be the last
All my senses are drown in this ocean
No emotions

There were times in the past I believed you
Every word that you said was my gold
And once more I’m betrayed
How much can I take
Will this pain lead me back to

You, for all this time it was you
You were leaving me broken and blue
You were hiding the truth
With the way that you loved me
(the way that you loved me)
Was it all just in my mind?
Do I ever cross your heart?
Will someone new stop
The pain that you caused within me?

No one can help me save my breath and fight
I got your back and I will help you find the remedy
The only thing that I know
I promise you I won't return

This is the last time
This is the last time
No one can help me
I won't back down
I won't back down anymore
Don't even waste my time
The remedy is mine
No one can help me save my breath and fight
I got your back and baby you never got mine
I should've known it
I should've seen it
You, it was you
Always hiding the truth

And once more I’m betrayed
How much can I take
Will this pain lead me back to

You, for all this time it was you
You were leaving me broken and blue
You were hiding the truth
With the way that you loved me
(the way that you loved me)
Was it all just in my mind?
Do I ever cross your heart?
Will someone new stop
The pain that you caused within me?

Was it all just in my mind?
Do I ever cross your heart?
Will someone new stop
The pain that you caused within me?
