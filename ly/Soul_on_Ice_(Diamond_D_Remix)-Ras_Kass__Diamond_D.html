		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The waterproof MC, you ain't wettin' me
You need to stop rappin' and start robbin' banks like Steady B
'Cause see, no matter how much green you make
You'll never taste the avocado, just another broke Versace model
Tiger Woods ain't even up to par in the game of survival
That's why I'm in y'all Cristal bottles
Drink Listerine, brush my teeth with amphetamine
So I can sound fresh and say dope things in between
Three strikes to five mics (forever snortin')
I want a woman with the body of a and a personality like Lauryn
Can't even say I didn't know
'Cause while we wanna be N.W.A. they create the N.W.O
How many years (fo' mo'), so them fake John Gotti's
Ain't got no Maseratis, I be at the party sippin' hot toddies
My bumps in Arabic, out Audis in Saudi
I'm thuggish ruggish to the bone
And I'm gonna diss everybody, and I'm gonna diss everybody

You want the truth, can't handle the truth
You want Lexus moonroof, Hennessy 80 proof
Scared to death, playin' the game of life
Soul on ice
You want the truth, can't handle the truth
You want Lexus moonroof, Hennessy 80 proof
Scared to death, playin' the game of life
Soul on ice

I keep the afterparty swervin', not quite like Michael Irvin
Edumacating urban youth, like it or not
These soliloquies explain our people's lack of stability
You keepin' it real, but ain't got a clue what reality really be
See the diameter of your knowledge is the circumference of your activity
Me, I knew the deal before Babyface went solo, baggin' dime pieces
Stackin' dividends and dressin' in more linen than Yoko Ono
But on the low doe, we fightin' over the scraps
Worshippin' the almighty dollar, "In God We Trust," look it over
Now what pyramids got to do with the pilgrims or Jehovah?
Novus Ordo Seclorum means New World Order
That's why I keep my friends close and my enemies closer
We runnin' around in thousand dollar clown suits
Better get some boots when Lucifer turn your city to Beirut

You want the truth, can't handle the truth
You want Lexus moonroof, Hennessy 80 proof
Scared to death, playin' the game of life
Soul on ice
You want the truth, can't handle the truth
You want Lexus moonroof, Hennessy 80 proof
Scared to death, playin' the game of life
Soul on ice

Avoid one-time, got Lela Rochon callin' my Jimmy sunshine
Fifth floor of the Mondrian, so go 'head, fella, pop your Dom
I'm the man whose esophagus transform to a gat like Megatron
Here's a sport unknown to Bob Costas, give it a name and you a hater
But violence don't play that game, man
Guerilla penmanship, the, preacher impeacher
Heat seeker MC when I get pissed like a urethra
My day-to-day, I'm tryna bubble, first place
This paper I chase, "Touch Me and Tease Me" like Case
But in the millennium, this C.R.E.A.M. turns electronic
UPC barcodes on the hand is demonic
They got concentration camps, from Alaska to Jersey
But when the President declare a national emergency
He payin' car notes tryna Rock the Vote
I'm spittin' razor-sharp quotes tryin' to slit a throat

You want the truth, can't handle the truth
You want Lexus moonroof, Hennessy 80 proof
Scared to death, playin' the game of life
Soul on ice
You want the truth, can't handle the truth
You want Lexus moonroof, Hennessy 80 proof
Scared to death, playin' the game of life
Soul on ice

Uh, uh, yeah
I'm rhymin', beats provided by Diamond
