		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So I hopped on a train three in the afternoon
I don't know when I'm coming back,
But I hope that it's soon
See, I never thought (never thought)
That I'd have to leave your side (your side)

It's only physically
But you know that you will be on my mind
Twenty-four hours at a time
'Cause in my eyes, you were mine (you were mine)

No matter where you go, I won't be very far
'Cause in my head I'll be right there where you are
'Cause love has no distance baby
Love, love has no distance baby
No, not when it comes to you and me

See, she wrote me a letter, said the weather wasn't better
But she says that she was doing fine
"I want to see you face to face", 
That's what she wrote to me that day
And I knew that it was all a sign
So I wrote back with this song,
Promise it won't be too long
Wanna make up for all our lost time
'Cause in my eyes, you were mine (you were mine)

No matter where you go, I won't be very far
'Cause in my head I'll be right there where you are
'Cause love has no distance baby
Love, love has no distance baby
No, not when it comes to you and me

So I'm going through these boxes, my life's gone off track
It's been three years, she hasn't written back
But in my eyes, she's still mine
And I know it sounds so stupid to be waiting this long
But I'm still in love, and I know I'm not wrong
'Cause in my eyes, she was mine

No matter where you go, I won't be very far
'Cause in my head I'll be right there where you are
'Cause love has no distance baby
Love, love has no distance baby
No, not when it comes to you and

No matter where you go, I won't be very far
'Cause in my head I'll be right there where you are
'Cause love is no distance baby
Love, love has no distance baby, no
Not when it comes to you and me
