		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh
That's right
Okay
Yeah
Let's go

Don't buy me no ring
See, I got my own
Na na na na, na na na na
All the finer things
Dripping head to toe
Na na na na, na na na na
They wanna be me
Or wanna be mine
Na na na na, na na na na
But I just brush 'em off
'Cause I ain't got the time (yeah)

I'll let you hold me
You don't control me
You want it bad, bad, bad
Want it bad, bad, bad
Keeping you waiting
Special occasion
Oh, are you mad, mad, mad?
Are you mad?

You must not know who you're dealing with
Tell 'em

All the boys necks break when they look at me
'Cause my shape too bomb, call it TNT
Yeah, I got it from my mama, thank G-O-D
I'm a bad little thing, and I ain't sorry

All the boys necks break when they look at me
'Cause my shape too bomb, call it TNT
Yeah, I got it from my mama, thank G-O-D
I'm a bad little thing, and I ain't sorry

Everything is real
But you don't get to touch (no, no)
Na na na na, na na na na
Walking in these heels
I can't help but stunt
Na na na na, na na na na
They wanna be me
Or wanna be mine
Na na na na, na na na na
They don't pay my bills (yeah)
I pay 'em on my own

I'll let you hold me
You don't control me
You want it bad, bad, bad
Want it bad, bad, bad
Keeping you waiting
Special occasion
Oh, are you mad, mad, mad?
Are you mad?

You must not know who you're dealing with
Tell 'em

All the boys necks break when they look at me
'Cause my shape too bomb, call it TNT
Yeah, I got it from my mama, thank G-O-D
I'm a bad little thing, and I ain't sorry

All the boys necks break when they look at me

Yeah, I got it from my mama, thank G-O-D
I'm a bad little thing, and I ain't sorry (no)
