		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been building a house
I filled it with all the things that I could live without
I've been thinking about
How the walls come down
And the ceiling crashed around my feet
Broken on the ground
Was nothing that really mattered to me
Yeah, yeah

And now I see that it's you I needed all along
Maybe I'm too late and don't it always seems to go
I'll be breaking in two
I don't know what I'd do
If I didn't have you
If I didn't have you
Thought I had nothing to lose
But that's not the truth
I don't know what I'd do
If I didn't have you

Even as the words came out
As they fall I wanna take them back
I know I let you down
And it's all that I've been thinking about
I get I messed it up
Like I was far too close to see
Now I know that this
Is all that really matters to me
Yeah, yeah

And now I see that it's you I needed all along
Maybe I'm too late and don't it always seems to go
I'll be breaking in two
I don't know what I'd do
If I didn't have you
If I didn't have you
Thought I had nothing to lose
But that's not the truth
I don't know what I'd do
If I didn't

I swear time's so slow now I
Face it on my own and I
Can't do this alone if I
If I didn't
Say I'm sorry love 'cause I
Know I made you feel like I
Don't need you
Like I could survive

If I didn't have you
If I didn't have you
Thought I had nothing to lose
But that's not the truth
I don't know what I'd do

If I didn't have you
If I didn't have you
Thought I had nothing to lose
But that's not the truth
I don't know what I'd do
If I didn't have you
If I didn't have you
If I didn't have you
If I didn't have you
