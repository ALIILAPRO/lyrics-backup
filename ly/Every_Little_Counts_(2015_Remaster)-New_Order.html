		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every second counts
When I am with you
I think you are a pig
You should be in a zoo
I guess I should've known
I'd end up on my own
Every second counts when I am with you
Every second counts

Every little counts
When I am with you
You make me feel so good
I never felt so new
I saw you long ago
Though you never let it show
Every little counts when I am with you

Every little counts when I am with you

Every second counts
When I am with you
Even though you're stupid
I still follow you
The smile upon your face,
It always stays in place
Every second counts when I am with you

Every second counts when I am with you
Every second...
