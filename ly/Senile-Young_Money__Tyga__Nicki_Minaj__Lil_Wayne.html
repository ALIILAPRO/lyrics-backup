		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  High in the video, fuck with me, hella raw
Raw got a little riddle, riddle, twerk for a star
Started from the (from the), like Christina, got a million
Man, I'm a good guy, turned to a vill-i-a-n
Bully in the pack turned to a rat
Pussy on my jack, I (I) hit a bitch with a car bomb
Bombs in L.A., bombs in the Bay
Nigga, you ain't safe, I (I) run with niggas like O-Dog
All we do is ball (ball), all we do is ball (ball), now I'm passed out
Lean in the drop, ice in the watch
Nigga, that's Ben and Jerry dollars, watch a nigga make a stack house
Gingerbread man, run while you can
All you niggas lame, toolie on me, got killers on speed dial
Infrared blam if a nigga shout
Don't get packed out, probably hear the paparazzi when I back out (back out)

Can you see now? (Can you see now?)
Are you senile? (Senile)
Can you see now? (Can you see now?)
See now? (See now?)
Can you see now? (Can you see now?)
Can you see now? (Can you see now?)
Can you see now? (Can you see now?)
When you see a nigga, don't be actin' senile

Sky Dweller check, helicopter pad
Dropping off a body bag
Money talk, guess I got the gift of gab
Don't interject, don't intercept
You ain't on a jet, you ain't meet a bitch with this kind of money yet
Yeah, I got an Audemar, I ain't set the time once
And I know they say they shine, I ain't seen 'em shine once
All these rappers is my sons, and I'm always nine months
Man if this was baseball, I ain't let 'em slide once (once)
Do you see now, you playin' D now? (now)
Oh, you wanna beat me, how? (how?)
Oh, you the number one draft in the league now?
Ride down your block, doors twelve o'clock
Lambo', the drop, bike niggas ain't stoppin' for a cop (nigga)
I got this shit locked tighter than a bear hug (bear hug)
When them bitches rap, niggas need an ear plug

Can you see now? (Can you see now?)
Are you senile? (Senile)
Can you see now? (Can you see now?)
See now? (See now?)
Can you see now? (Can you see now?)
Can you see now? (Can you see now?)
Can you see now? (Can you see now?)
When you see a nigga, don't be actin' senile

I ride with the heat, trunk full of beat
Bomb like the Middle East, I got (got) killers in the street

Ride with the heat, trunk full of beat
Bomb like the Middle East, I got (got) killers in the street

Ride with the heat, trunk full of beat
Bomb like the Middle East, I got (got) killers in the street

Ride with the heat, trunk full of beat
Bomb like the Middle East, I got (got) killers in the street (in the street)

Nigga got a problem, see about it (see about it)
Knock a nigga off, beat the body (beat the body)
I'm just makin' all these deposits
Neighborhood nice and quiet, thought I saw Mr. Rogers, nigga (Rogers, nigga)
I could sell salt and equalize it, wait
I said I could sell salt and equalize it (equalize it)
Boy, I got every award but a Heisman
Do a drive by on you niggas, make a U-turn for survivors
Take a newborn from his mama, stick a shoe horn in vaginas
Got the coupe on Yokohamas, got the super soaker chopper, uh (uh)
We'll kidnap the kingpin (kingpin), like, "Who is your supplier?"
Nigga better know the fire, nigga better know somebody
I know niggas that'll kill ya for a little notoriety (notoriety)
I can make a lion say "meow"
I'm in this motherfucker gettin' money 'til I'm senile, Tunechi

Can you see now? (Can you see now? Oh)
Are you senile? (Senile, haha)
Can you see now? (Can you see now?)
See now? (See now?)
Can you see now? (Can you see now?)
Can you see now? (Can you see now?)
Can you see now? (Can you see now?)
When you see a nigga, don't be actin' senile (senile)

Can you see now? (Can you see now?)
Are you senile? (Senile)
Can you see now? (Can you see now?)
See now? (See now?)
Can you see now? (Can you see now?)
Can you see now? (Can you see now?)
Can you see now? (Can you see now?)
When you see a nigga, don't be actin' senile (senile)
