		  Uh, okay

If I got one thing right it was you and me
But I go in through the window so nobody sees
Pull me closer please
I don't even need you to explain
How much longer will you keep me on your chain?

I'm running out of options (okay)
You're running through my mind with a shotgun
I think she might be robbing
She can take what she want
I just wanna make you late
Would you wanna waste that?
I know you like my goofy ass
How could you hate that
I can see what's underneath
And I love you more now
Now I know how (yeah)

If I got one thing right it was you and me
But I go in through the window so nobody sees
Pull me closer please
I don't even need you to explain
How much longer will you keep me on your chain?

Too bad it's good
Or else I'd be gone
My down she cured
And then we go back to your place, don't lie
You wanna get high so we gonna get high
And then I see a laugh on your face so I might die

So I might die
So I might die

If I got one thing right it was you and me
So I'll go in so nobody sees
Pull me closer please
I don't even need you to explain
How much longer will you keep me on your chain?

How much longer
