		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They threw her from the Circus train
Wrapped in cowhide and rusty chains
Blinded by an astronaut
She's convinced that I wrote paper 53
I know longer do what I'm told
I've purposefully burnt my only road

God has lied to me
He promised
He promised we'd be free
Now the son of the morning is here
Preaching hate and gifting
Rubes with fear

She eats cotton candy and guards A box of snakes
The super universe, lullabies  And peacock fakes
I can't hold the one book Without the rest
I cover her horns, as long as  She remains my guest

God has lied to me
He promised
He promised we'd be free
Now the son of the morning is here
Preaching hate and gifting
Rubes with fear

God has lied to me
He promised
He promised we'd be free
Now the son of the morning is here
Preaching hate and gifting
Rubes with fear
