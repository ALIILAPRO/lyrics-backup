		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Liar, liar
You're a liar, liar
Liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar

You can set my heart on fire
Always play your cards so cool
I'm out here just walking the wire
You act like I'm nothing to lose

It's like drunk calls in the afternoon
It's like rainfalls in the heat of June
Always bad news when it comes to you
You're a liar, liar, liar, liar

Ooh, look at what you've done to me
You're a liar, liar
Ooh, killing off my fantasy
You're a liar, liar
Can't keep my heart from caving in
You played your hand again and again
Ooh, look at what you've done
You're a liar, liar, liar, liar

I've been blinded by desire
Every move I follow you, ooh
Built you up like you're some messiah
This love ain't a game for two

It's like drunk calls in the afternoon
It's like rainfalls in the heat of June
Always bad news when it comes to you
You're a liar, liar, liar, liar

Ooh, look at what you've done to me
You're a liar, liar
Ooh, killing off my fantasy
You're a liar, liar
Can't keep my heart from caving in
You played your hand again and again
Ooh, look at what you've done
You're a liar, liar, liar, liar

Liar, liar
You're a liar, liar
Liar liar
You're a liar, liar
Ooh, look at what you've done to me
Ooh, killing off my fantasy
Oh oh

Ooh, look at what you've done to me (you've done to me)
You're a liar, liar
Ooh, killing off my fantasy (my fantasy, my fantasy)
You're a liar, liar
Can't keep my heart from caving in
You played your hand again and again
Ooh, look at what you've done
You're a liar, liar, liar, liar
