		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Saddle up, we're calling up the pain
Stilling doubt to single out the strain

You came, you saw, you sawed her brain
You cut out all the parts that held your stain

Still inclined, you're billing wine the blame
She's crying now, you're climbing down your claim
Sitting up, you've counting up your names
Is sin enough to bend 'em off the frame?

You came, you saw, you sawed her brain
You cut out all the parts that held your stain
You clipped, you clawed, to no applause (weigh above)
You lost the will and bought the lye and gauze (weigh apart)

So tried to be somebody
So tried to be somebody (so fly to flee)
So tried to be somebody (so long and leave)
So hard to be somebody
So tried to be somebody (run, you wreck, and then you run) (you wreck, and then you run)
So far to feel somebody (you wreck, and then you run) (you wreck, and then you run)
So tried to be somebody (you wreck, and then you run) (you wreck, and then you run)
So hard to be somebody (you wreck, and then you run)(you wreck, and then you)
