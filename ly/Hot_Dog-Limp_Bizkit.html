		  Ladies and gentlemen!
Introducing the Chocolate Starfish
And the Hotdog Flavored Water
Bring it on
Get the fuck up
Yeah, check, one, two
Listen up, listen up
Here we go (here we go)

It's a fucked up world and a fucked up place
Everybody's judged by their fucked up face
Fucked up dreams, fucked up life
A fucked up kid with a fucked up knife
Fucked up moms and fucked up dads
It's a fucked up cop with a fucked up badge
Fucked up job with fucked up pay
And a fucked up boss, this is a fucked up pay
Fucked up press wit fucked up lies
While Lethal's in the back with the fucked up eyes

Hey (it's on)
Everybody knows it's on
Hey (it's on)
Everybody knows it's on

Ain't it a shame that you can't say "Fuck"
Fuck's just a word and it's all fucked up
Like a fucked up punk with a fucked up mouth
A nine inch nail, I'll get knocked the fuck out
Fucked up AIDS from fucked up sex
Fake-ass titties on a fucked up chest
We're all fucked up, so what you wanna do?
We fucked up me and fucked up you

You wanna fuck me like an animal?
You'd like to burn me on the inside?
You like to think that I'm a perfect drug?
Just know that nothin' you do will bring you closer to me

Ain't life a bitch?
A fucked up bitch
A fucked up soul with a fucked up stitch
A fucked up head
Is a fucked up shame
Swinging on my nuts
Is a fucked up game
Jealousy filling up a fucked up mind
It's real fucked up
Like a fucked up crime
If I say "Fuck" two more times
That's forty six "Fucks" in this fucked up rhyme

Hey (it's on)
Everybody knows it's on
Hey (it's on)
Everybody knows it's on

You wanna fuck me like an animal?
You'd like to burn me on the inside?
You like to think that I'm a perfect drug?
Just know that nothin' you do will bring you closer to me

Hoo-haa, haaw
Listen up baby 
You can't bring me (bring me) down
I don't think so, I don't want some 
You better check your (check it) self 
Before you wreck yourself
Kiss my starfish, my chocolate starfish punk 
Kiss my starfish, my chocolate starfish

You wanna fuck me like an animal?
You wanna burn me on the inside?
You like to think that I'm a perfect drug?
Just know that nothin' you do will bring you closer to me
