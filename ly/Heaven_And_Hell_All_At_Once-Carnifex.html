		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  At war with peace
Tides of depression
I don’t know where they’ll carry me
Of wrath and tears
To truly live, embrace your fears
Stare into the empty night
Consider your existence
Consider mans plight
This is where you die
Let go of pain
See life from the other side
Natural cycle
Rain and sorrow
The world won’t let you forget
Let go of fear
Let the earth lay you to rest
All the gods, all the heavens, all the hells are inside you
Masks of eternity, I’ve worn so many
Utter darkness and bitter majesty
I’m filled with the souls of dead solider
And for them the war is never over
Never over
Hourglass of life
Hands of time hold the broken shards
You will not win this fight
You will never take this life
One dimensional spacial existence
It’s the universe
You can’t resist this
Let the wind, carry me across this land
Hidden all over, you’ll never know where I am
Dark December waters, they drag me down
Vanished from this life, erased without a sound
Erased without a sound
All the gods, all the heavens, all the hells are inside you
Masks of eternity, I’ve worn so many
Utter darkness and bitter majesty
Let the wind, carry me across this land
Hidden all over, you’ll never know where I am
Dark December waters, they drag me down
Vanished from this life, erased without a sound
