		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Saw the drift sparse in your iris
I was in it
I saw the sparkle in your iris
How I need it

The way you fix me
With your hazel eyes
The way you hold me
With your weary lies

I think I'm falling in love
Holy, let me go
I think I'm falling in love
With your attitude

Saw the sparkle in your iris
I was in it
I felt the smoothness of your curved lips
You think I need it?

The way you fix me
With your weary lies
The way you hold me
With your hazel eyes

I think I'm falling in love
Do you let me go?
I think I'm falling in love
Do you let me go?

The way you fix me
(Do you want it?)
With your hazel eyes (do you want it?)
(Do you want it?)
(do you want it, baby?)
The way you hold me
(Do you want it)
With your weary lies

I think I'm falling in love
Do you let me go?
I think I'm falling in love
With your attitude
