If I finally let you smash, you put your back in it
Watch this pussy string you out, like it got crack in it
It look good in the mirror, way I practice it
I wanna feel the whole shit, don't give me half of it
Drunk text lead to rich sex (yeah, yeah)
Then that group sex where my bitch wet (yeah, yeah)
You know I'm nasty
Got me touching on my own body
If R&B don't mention me, don't mention nobody
I been fly since like, fifteen, without a co-pilot
We been fucking for a year, before they know'd about it
Boy, you know that pussy good, but don't go boast about it
Boy, you know that pussy wet when you swim deep inside it
I suggest you wear a vest if you plan on surviving
Ya day was long, the sex was good
So tell me all about it
If you too tired, be my bike, relax and let me ride it
Coupe sex, with no roof sex (yeah, yeah)
Hula hoop sex, on a loop sex (yeah, yeah)
Give it to me nasty, yeah (no)
Ooh, oh, oh, you gon' dive in this pussy, you gon' overdose
Fuck me good after we eat, then we gone roll the smoke
Ooh, oh, snatch my soul up in the Rolls, so I can go ghost

Baby, when I smash you, put your back in it
Get that first nut, then I'm back in it
Can you go deep? You keep asking it
Don't take a whole Perc', she want half of it
Drug sex, drug sex, yeah, yeah
Rich sex, rich sex, yeah, yeah
I know you nasty
She be touchin' on her own body

You know you can't compare me to no other (no, no, no, no)
Fuck so good I call you by your government (ooh)
Fuck so good, I fuck just for the fuck of it (ooh)
Fuck so good you just can't get enough of it
Oh, nah, nah, he gon' slide by
Your girl can say, "Bye, bye"
I can't take this for me
I know you want me and it's clear
Baby, tell me you decided
It's in your heart you feel it, know that you can't fight it
When we together you know that we always vibin', vibin'
I feel up on you, get excited
Wanna take control, babe? It's fine with me
Look me in the eyes when inside me
Ride or die, need you right beside me
Any time I front, boy you remind me

Baby, when I smash you, put your back in it
Get that first nut, then I'm back in it
Can you go deep? You keep asking it
Don't take a whole Perc', she want half of it
Drug sex, drug sex, yeah, yeah
Rich sex, rich sex, yeah, yeah
I know you nasty
She be touchin' on her own body
