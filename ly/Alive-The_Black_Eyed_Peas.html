		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got so much love
For you darlin' and I,
I wanna let you know how I feel

And its true that I love you
And it's true your the only one and I do,
I adore you
And its true girl
You make me feel alive-i-i-ive
You make me feel alive-i-i-ive
You make me feel alive-i-i-ive
You make me feel alive-i-i-i-ive

You say, you say, you say
That I'm the only one
You say that I'm your number one
Now your gone and I feel numb
Tell me where do we go wrong
You are my best friend and boyfriend
Now its seems like you're my worst friend
I gotta do soul searching
Without you I'm a whole different person
I ain't acting like I used to
I don't feel loved like I used to
It was your love I was used to
Why did I have to lose
Your love your love your love
Your love is what it was
That had me feeling buzzed
You are my true love

And its true that I love you
And it's true your the only one and I do,
I adore you
And its true girl
You make me feel alive-i-i-ive
You make me feel alive-i-i-ive
You make me feel alive-i-i-ive
You make me feel alive-i-i-i-ive

Hey girl your the only one
Supposed to be my number one
Now your gone I feel so numb
Tell me how do we go wrong
First friends then we became best-friend
You used to be my girlfriend
Now your my worst friend
Yeah I gotta do a lil' soul searching
Without you I'm a whole different person
I don't even act like I used to
I don't even feel loved like I used to
I guess its your love that I used to
And I feel bad that I had to lose you
I get so many things that I wanna (sa-sa-sa-sa)
I guess this mean that I'm missing you
Sorry for the things that I did to you
I'm so lost without you

And its true that I love you
And it's true your the only one and I do,
I adore you
And its true girl
You make me feel alive-i-i-ive
You make me feel alive-i-i-ive
You make me feel alive-i-i-ive
You make me feel alive-i-i-i-ive

La di di da la di da la da
La di da la di da
La di di da la di da la da
La di da la di da

I got so much love

La di di da la di da la da
La di da la di da

I got so much love

La di di di di di di di da la la la la

And its true girl

You make me feel alive-i-i-ive
You make me feel alive-i-i-ive
You make me feel alive-i-i-ive
You make me feel alive-i-i-i-ive

So easy to fall in love with you
And all the things that you do
Baby girl your so remarkable
So special, so wonderful
So special, so wonderful
So special, so wonderful

Baby girl your so remarkable
So speci-al-al-al-al-al-al
