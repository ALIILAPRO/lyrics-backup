		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I might sound crazy now
But I'll say it anyhow
Cause I want you to hear my heart baby
Iâ€˜ll never win no prize
For pretty words and rhymes 
But you'll feel what I'm feelin' baby
Thought I knew what beautiful was

There's the sun, there's the moon
There's million dollar skyline views
Then there's Rocky Mountain highs
Oceans rollin' wild and blue 
There's the sun, there's the moon
Then there's you

Baby just think about
Could you imagine life without
cll those things, all those beautiful things
Now you know what I'd feel like
With no you in my life
Like the stars with no sky to hold 'em
That world ain't one I want to live in girl

There's the sun, there's the moon
There's million dollar skyline views
There's Rocky Mountain highs
Oceans rollin' wild and blue 
There's the sun, there's the moon
Then there's you

Thought I knew what beautiful was

There's the sun, there's the moon
There's million dollar skyline views
There's Rocky Mountain highs
Oceans rollin' wild and blue 
There's the sun, there's the moon
Then there's you
