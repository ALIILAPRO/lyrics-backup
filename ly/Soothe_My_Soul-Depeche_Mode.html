		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm coming for you
When the sun goes down
I'm coming for you
When there's no one around

I come to your house
Break down the door
Girl, I'm shaking
I need more

There's only one way to soothe my soul (there's only one way to soothe my soul)
There's only one way to soothe my soul (only one way to soothe my soul)
Only one way (only one way)
Only one way (only one way)
Only one way (only one way)
Only one way (only one way)

I'm coming for you
I need to feel your skin
I'm coming for you
To stop this crawling

I'm taking my place
By your side
I'm not leaving
Until I'm satisfied

There's only one way to soothe my soul (there's only one way to soothe my soul)
There's only one way to soothe my soul (only one way to soothe my soul)
Only one way (only one way)
Only one way (only one way)
Only one way (only one way)
Only one way (only one way)

I'm coming for you
My body's hungry
I'm coming for you
Like a junkie

I can't stop
The desire in me
I'm not waiting
Patiently

There's only one way to soothe my soul (only one way to soothe my soul)
There's only one way to soothe my soul (only one way to soothe my soul)
There's only one way to soothe my soul (there's only one way to soothe my soul)
Only one way to soothe my soul (only one way to soothe my soul)
There's only one way (only one way)
There's only one way to soothe my soul (only one way to soothe my soul)
Only one way (only one way)
Only one way
