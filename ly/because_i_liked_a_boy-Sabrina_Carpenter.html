		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I said I wanted Thin Mints and you said you knew a guy
You showed up with a boom box and stars in your eyes
Who knew cuddling on trampolines could be so reckless
We bonded over Black Eyed Peas and complicated exes

Fell so deeply into it
It was all so innocent

Now I'm a homewrecker, I'm a slut
I got death threats filling up semi-trucks
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
All because I liked
I'm a hot topic on your tongue
I'm a rebound gettin' 'round stealin' from the young
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
All because I liked a boy

I'm not catastrophizing
Everything's derailing
Was only tryna hold you close
While your heart was failing
It's not internet illusions just
Two kids going through it
You said I'm too late to be your first love
But I'll always be your favorite

Now I'm a homewrecker, I'm a slut
I got death threats filling up semi-trucks
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
All because I liked
I'm a hot topic on your tongue
I'm a rebound gettin' 'round stealin' from the young
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
All because I liked a boy

All because I liked a boy
Fell so deeply into it
It was all so innocent
Dating boys with exes
No, I wouldn't recommend it

I'm a homewrecker, I'm a slut
I got death threats filling up semi-trucks
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
All because I liked a boy
And all of this for what?
When everything went down, we'd already broken up
Please, tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
All because I liked a boy

Ah (a boy), ah (a boy) 
All because I liked a boy
