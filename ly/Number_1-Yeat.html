		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah my diamond, money yeah yeah yeah
Yeah my-

Yeah, two tone
Yeah my diamon flooded yeah yeah
Molly, yeah I’m too high can’t be in public
Yeah yeah me hungry, yeah money starving
Yeah rock the G-Star jeans
Yeah and yeah bitch keep coming
I was counting up racks I was upside store
Got a brand new balenci hat I stole
Give me your money, yeah I take what I owe
Got a nice bustdown yeah GI JOE
No looking out down on the road
What if he told?
Don’t break the code, can’t fuck with hoеs
You sniffing on coke, I'm rubbin they nose
Yеah, they gotta go

Change it, yeah switch it up
Fill me cup
I walked in the lean and I cannot get up
Came in the studio chopping it up
I’m sniffing my molly, my tropical drugs
Hidin my feelings they came from above
Some people gon hate, some people gon love it
Same ones that’s loving same
Once thats hating
They give me that money, tell momma I made it
I’m paving the way
Yeah I’m using the pavement
I’m go harder, I’m making a statement
I made this song on stove, bacon
Won’t ever give up, I gotta be patient
Sometimes I wanna say shit
You not in my conversation
We don’t have no correlation
Baby can't you fight temptation
She love my nut she love to taste it
This is real music this is amazing
I’m not from this earth
Yeah I came from a space ship
I’m in my own world, you can’t even say shit
My word your bitch i gotta go off, only wish
Dripping so crazy, swimming with the fish
I got some money, friends with benefit's
They wanna be me, they look at my fish
She want my semen, she wanna have kids
I’m one of the hardest
Who the hell like this
Hurry up with my drugs cause
I really gotta piss

Just take my
You damn sold your soul (yeah you did)
This is a story that they never told
I forgot to tell you it
Was murder that she wrote

Yeah, two tone
Yeah my diamond flooded yeah yeah
Molly, yeah I’m too high can’t be in public
Yeah yeah me hungry, yeah money starving
Yeah rock the G-Star jeans
Yeah and yeah bitch keep coming
I was counting up racks I was upside store
Got a brand new balenci hat I stole
Give me your money, yeah I take what I owe
Got a nice bustdown yeah GI JOE
No looking out down on the road
What if he told?
Don’t break the code, can’t fuck with hoes
You sniffing on coke, I'm rubbin they nose
Yeah, they gotta go
