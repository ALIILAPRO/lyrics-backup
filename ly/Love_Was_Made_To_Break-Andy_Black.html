		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We fill our lives with empty memories
We've had enough, we've had enough
We risked it all, didn't get anything
I'm giving up, I'm giving up

It started with hatred
You left me here departed
Distorted, we played it
But in my gut I'll save it

Pick up the pieces before you let this go

Fading in, fading out
The feeling's gone, it's like we're enemies
Checking in, checking out
We're strangers now but I don't believe that
Love was made to break
No I don't believe that love was made to break

We rise and fall with our misery
I built the wall, I built the wall
A siren's call that brought you here to me
We lost control, we lost control

So when this comes crashing
And we are losing chances
Won't see it in our eyes
'Til it's too late to fix this

Pick up the pieces before you let this go

Faded in, faded out
The feeling's gone, it's like we're enemies
Checking in, checking out
We're strangers now but I don't believe that
Love was made to break
No I don't believe that love was made to break

It seems we live for a fight
But I can feel it tonight
So now I'm leaving so now
But I feel terrified

'Cause I am losing my mind
Trying to make it alright
Trying to see this all through
To the other side
To the other side
To the other side

Whoa oh oh oh

Fading in, fading out
The feeling's gone, it's like we're enemies
Checking in, checking out
We're strangers now but I don't believe

Faded in, faded out
The feeling's gone, it's like we're enemies
Checking in, checking out
We're strangers now but I don't believe that
Love was made to break
No I don't believe that love was made to break

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
