		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This an empty place bol, trust me, don't go there
The Jezebel dwell there, way to many hoes there
It's not for everybody, so you shouldn't poke your nose there
The watch say Panerai, the sweater say, "Mohair"
If Five-O ask you where you going, say, "Nowhere"
Mind your fucking B-I, I'm trying to make some dough here
Trying to make moves and you fucking up my flow here
Asking for an answer when you know nobody know here
We ran up into Macy's cause they had a lot of Lo there
Thirty deep, rent-a-cop screaming that it's no fair
We was boosting everything from Tommy Hil to Wu-Wear
Prada wasn't even on my mind cause I was new there
Ask Ramona Africa, she'll tell you not to move here
When OG worked the tower, he would let us boost there
It's like they had us locked inside a zoo and let us loose there
A bunch of fucking animals that have our fucking roots here

The weak get overthrown when animals are home
When you realize you're all alone
Boy, you better hide that hungry you
When you realize you're all alone

Yeah, this is an empty place bol, trust me, don't walk there
Or you gon' end up with your body lined in chalk there
Keep your head down and don't even try to talk there
Anybody don't belong there, in the dark there
When papi run up on you, best believe you take a loss there
They playing Aventura while they got you in their crosshair
If you ain't trying to run it, then we taking it by force here
And I ain't gotta problem telling you that I'm the boss here
It's a place in the road that people call the fork there
One is living righteous and the other serving pork there
You gon' get vicked if you dumb enough to floss here
Muhfuckers out here, addicted to the warfare
We carry baseball bats, but ain't no fucking park here
I had to take an F because they charged me with assault here
Silencio papa, there's way too many narcs here
Especially when I'm 'bout to let this bulldog bark here

The weak get overthrown when animals are home
When you realize you're all alone
Boy, you better hide that hungry you
When you realize you're all alone

Yeah, Pack Pistol Pazzy
Yo, Buckwild, what's the word papa?
Ditc, yeah, yeah, yeah
You muhfuckers don't want war
Pistol Gang Pazzy
