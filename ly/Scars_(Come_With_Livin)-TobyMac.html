		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No, no
Yeah I'm
Just beepin' right now
I gotta go
Hey

Had you on my mind
Had a little time
Know we kinda overdue 
Turnin' back the pages
To our younger days, yeah
I can still imagine you 

Boomin' like a thunder
Chasin' life with wonder
With fire that could light a room
Bottom kinda fell out
Waited for the rebound
But you never made a move

When life cuts so deep
Try and remember

You are not alone
We've all been there 
Scars come with livin'
You are not alone
We've all been there (been there, been there, oh), oh
So lift your head, lift your head
Lift your head to where your help comes from
Yeah, you, you're not alone
We've all been there
Scars come with livin' 

Life ain't got no sequel
We all broken people
The only road to found is lost 
Oversimplifyin' 
Ain't no shame in tryin' 
Passion never counts the cost 

Now you won't take my phone calls
You won't text me back at all
I just wanna see you
I can't stand to see you gone
Yesterday I missed you
Yesterday I played your song
I'm oversimplifyin', I'm oversimplifyin'

But try and remember

You are not alone
We've all been there 
Scars come with livin'
You are not alone
We've all been there (been there, been there, oh), oh
So lift your head, lift your head
Lift your head to where your help comes from
Yeah, you, you're not alone
We've all been there
Scars come with livin' 

(Scars come, scars come, oh, scars come
Oh, scars come with livin'
Scars come, scars come, oh, scars come
Oh, scars come with livin')

It doesn't matter who you are 
This world gon' leave some battle scars 
It doesn't matter who you are 
This world gon' leave some battle scars 
It doesn't matter who you are 
This world gon' leave some battle scars 
It doesn't matter who you are 
This world gon' leave some battle scars 

You, you're not alone
We've all been there
Scars come with livin'
You, you're not alone, you're not alone
So lift your head up 
To where your help comes from
Lift your head up 
Oh, scars come with livin'
Lift your head up 
To where your help comes from
Lift your head up 
Oh, scars come with livin', (lift your head up)

It doesn't matter who you are 
This world gon' leave some battle scars
It doesn't matter who you are 
This world gon' leave some battle scars 
It doesn't matter who you are 
This world gon' leave some battle scars
