		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There are moments that the words don't reach
There is suffering too terrible to name
You hold your child as tight as you can
And push away the unimaginable
The moments when you're in so deep
It feels easier to just swim down

The Hamiltons move uptown
And learn to live with the unimaginable

I spend hours in the garden
I walk alone to the store
And it's quiet uptown
I never liked the quiet before
I take the children to church on Sunday
A sign of the cross at the door
And I pray
That never used to happen before

(If you see him in the street, walking by himself)
(Talking to himself, have pity)

Philip, you would like it uptown, it's quiet uptown

(He is working through the unimaginable)

(His hair has gone grey)
(He passes every day)
(They say he walks the length of the city)

You knock me out, I fall apart

(Can you imagine?)

Look at where we are
Look at where we started
I know I don't deserve you, Eliza
But hear me out
That would be enough

If I could spare his life
If I could trade his life for mine
He'd be standing here right now
And you would smile, and that would be enough
I don't pretend to know
The challenges we're facing
I know there's no replacing what we've lost
And you need time
But I'm not afraid
I know who I married
Just let me stay here by your side
That would be enough

If you see him in the street, walking by her side
Talking by her side, have pity

Eliza, do you like it uptown? It's quiet uptown

(He is trying to do the unimaginable)
(See them walking in the park, long after dark)
(Taking in the sights of the city)

Look around, look around, Eliza
(They are trying to do the unimaginable)

There are moments that the words don't reach
There is a grace too powerful to name
We push away what we can never understand
We push away the unimaginable
They are standing in the garden
Alexander by Eliza's side
She takes his hand

It's quiet uptown

(Forgiveness)
(Can you imagine?)
(Forgiveness)
(Can you imagine?)
(If you see him in the street, walking by her side)
(Talking by her side, have pity)
(They are going through the unimaginable)
