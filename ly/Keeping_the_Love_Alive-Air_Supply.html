		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Both of us are holding back
So afraid to fall in love and lose again
We've both been hurt before
Saw love walk out the door
In the end

Actin' as cold as ice, when we wanna be
It's just a foolish game we play
You couldn't hurt me bad enough
To make me give it up and walk away

[Chorus]
We can't stop, the feeling's too strong
We've got the will to hang on
Can't stop, we struggle and fight to survive
Keepin' the love alive

We try to forget the past, so many times
It's hard to make those memories leave
With all we have at stake 
We'll bend until we break
Cause we both believe

[Chorus]

If we stand the test of time
Love will be the lasting kind

[Chorus]
