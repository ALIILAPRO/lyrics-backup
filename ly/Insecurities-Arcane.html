		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Know you're keeping it safe
Casuing all of this nuisance
Influence from your new friends
Built a lot your...
Insecurities
Insecurities, Yeah

You're acting it like it's a movie
Make up this break up shit starting to confuse me
Consumed by your...
Insecurities
Insecurities
Yeah, Yeah

See you found you some new pride
Gassed up off of your new life
New ways severed old ties
Stop with all of your true lies
I know that you love to pretend (Pretend)
You feed off attention to brag (To brag)

Used to let this shit slide thru
Argue
Come Through
Enough of all this "Miss you"
"Fuck you"
"I love you"
I'm sober off the high I was on
Mistreated, bit broken, but strong

I've been out on queen street know I'm out here putting time
Rolled the dice, I took a chance, put everything on line
Patience been my virtue Mama praying for my life
I got all my exes trying to link me but I'm nice
I'm nice
I'm nice

Know you're keeping it safe
Casuing all of this nuisance
Influence from your new friends
Built a lot your...
Insecurities
Insecurities
Yeah

You're acting it like it's a movie
Make up this break up shit starting to confuse me
Consumed by your...
Insecurities
Insecurities
Yeah, Yeah

Gave you my good side
Now you're paying the price
Gave you, gave you my good side
Now you're paying the price
