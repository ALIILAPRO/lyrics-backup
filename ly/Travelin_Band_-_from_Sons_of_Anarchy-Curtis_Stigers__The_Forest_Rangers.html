		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Seven thirty seven comin' out of the sky 
Won't you take me down to Memphis on a midnight ride 
I want to move 
Playin' in a travelin' band 
Yeah! 
Well I'm flyin' 'cross the land tryin' to get a hand 
Playin' in a travelin' band 

Take me to the hotel baggage gone oh well 
Come on come on won't you get me to my room 
I want to move 
Playin' in a travelin' band 
Yeah! 
Well I'm flyin' 'cross the land, tryin' to get a hand 
Playin' in a travelin' band 

Listen to the radio talkin' 'bout the last show 
Someone got excited, had to call the state militia 
Want to move 
Playin' in a travelin' band 
Yeah! 
Well, I'm flyin' 'cross the land, tryin' to get a hand 
Playin' in a travelin' band 

Here we come again on a Saturday night 
With your fussin' and your fightin' won't you get me to the rhyme 
I want to move 
Playin' in a travelin' band 
Yeah! 
Well, I'm flyin' 'cross the land, tryin' to get a hand 
Playin' in a travelin' band 

Won't you give myself a hand?
