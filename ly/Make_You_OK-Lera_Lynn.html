		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember you most as so severe
And all the grit you wore to disappear
I never know which you I'd find
Some days you'd show up all redesigned

I remember you sometimes let come undone
I'd sing and you couldn't help but let tears run
And it felt to me like heaven had opened the skies
A man so harsh and heavy letting love pour from his eyes

I saw your love beneath the pain
I saw you fight through every day
Oh why couldn't I make you okay?

In a melody you were finally free
You'd forget the guilt and for a moment see me
These days I'm singing, searching all the eyes
For that same freedom I am too deprived
Didn't get it then but I sure do now

And I'm terrified I'm becoming you somehow
And everyone I ever love just gets dragged around
Hanging on to promises of higher ground

But I saw your love beneath the pain
I saw you fight through every day
Oh why couldn't I make you okay?

Ooh, I saw your love beneath the pain
Ooh, I saw you fight through every day
Oh why couldn't I make you okay?
Oh why couldn't I make you okay?
