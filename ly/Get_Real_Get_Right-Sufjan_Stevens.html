		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you want it
I know you really wanna get it right
Have you forsaken, have you mistaken me for someone else?
Saturday night you sleep with a rifle at your side
Delivering speeches, delivering speeches left and right
Follow those created deaths
Fortune save me from his wrath
Spaceship out the house at night
Prophet speak what's on your mind

You know you really gotta get right with the Lord
You know you really gotta get right with the Lord

Visit the future, visit the future from the outer space (space space space space)
A ring of fire, a ring of fire falling on your face (face face face face)
You dream of the dark age, you dream of the dark age of your youth
Consider the danger, consider the danger, as it moves
Prophet, loyal priest and king
(I know you want it, I know you really want it)
Snake-skinned master at your feet
(I know you want it, I know you really want it)
Barricade the bathroom doors
(I know you want it, I know you really want it)
Find some things you can't ignore
(I know you want it, I know you really want it)

I know you really gotta get right with the Lord
You know you really gotta get right with the Lord
You know you really gotta get right with the Lord
You know you really gotta get right with the Lord

I know I've caused you trouble
I know I've caused you pain
But I must do the right thing
I must do myself a favor and get real
Get right with the Lord
I know I've lost my conscience, I know I've lost all shape
But I must do the right thing
I must do myself a favor and get real
Get right with the Lord
I know I've always loved you
I know I've always been
But I must do the right thing
I must do myself a favor and get real
Get right with the Lord

Get real, get right for you will not be distracted by the signs
Do not be distracted by them
Do your self a favor and get real
Get right with the Lord
Get real, get right for you will not be distracted by the signs
Do not be distracted by them
Do yourself a favor and get real
Get right with the lord
Get real get right with the Lord
Get real get right with the Lord
