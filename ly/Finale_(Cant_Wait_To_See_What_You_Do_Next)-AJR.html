		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't you go, we need you here
You'll brighten up this shitty year
Well, congratulations on your bit of success
We can't wait to see what you do next

Come outside, come outside
You fell over, now you're high
You've been outside, been outside
So go ahead and do it one more time
Come outside, come outside
You went hard, and you did fine
You've been outside, been outside
So go ahead and do it one more time (do it one more time)

They wanted, they wanted
They wanted, they wanted
They wanted heaven from me
I gave 'em hell
Now they want something bigger
I'm overwhelmed
And if you're just as hopeless
I wish you well
We can't wait to see what you do next

Come outside, come outside
You fell over, now you're high
You've been outside, been outside
So go ahead and do it one more time
Come outside, come outside
You went hard, and you did fine
You've been outside, been outside
So go ahead and do it one more time (do it one more time))

Don't you go (don't you go)
We need you here (we need you here)
You'll brighten up this shitty year
Well, congratulations on your bit of success
We can't wait to see what you do next

They wanted, they wanted
They wanted, they wanted
They wanted heaven from me
I gave 'em hell
Now they want something bigger
I'm overwhelmed
And if you're just as hopeless
I wish you well
We can't wait to see what you do next

We can't wait to see
We can't wait to see
We can't wait to see
We can't wait to see

Can you wait a sec?
Let me catch my breath
Let me catch my
I can't remember how I got here
Can you wait a sec?
Let me catch my breath
Let me catch my
I can't remember how I got here, got here

They wanted heaven from me
I gave 'em hell
Now they want something bigger
I'm overwhelmed
I think it's time to go now
I think my curtain's falling
Just don't forget about me
When you get out of college
If it's my final album
And if I am forgotten
I hope I made you smile
That's all I ever wanted

Congratulations on your bit of success
Welcome to the Neotheater
We can't wait to see what you do next
