		  (Internet money, bitch)
Hahaha

I know that we ain't getting along
But I wanna see you on you're own tonight
Girl, D-N-D your phone (do that shit)
I'm tryna get you on your own tonight
Bad and you know it
You tell me that you're with it, gotta show me now
Mix the Hennessy with emotions
I'm tryna let go, can you hold me down?

You got it, you got it, girl, and you know that shit
Tell me you want the world, can give you all that shit
Let's get off that Hennessey, let me pour that shit
I'm tryna make memories, give me all that shit
Let's make something, shawty take drugs 'til the sun come up
In a Wraith truck, give me brain, uh, give me all that, uh
Give me all that, do it how you want it
I don't even gotta ask 'cause you bad and you know it (you know it)

I know that we ain't getting along
But I wanna see you on you're own tonight
Girl, D-N-D your phone (do that shit)
I'm tryna get you on your own tonight
Bad and you know it
You tell me that you're with it, gotta show me now
Mix the Hennessy with emotions
I'm tryna let go, can you hold me down?

She wanna be my one and only
But I can't be the one she wanted
Baby, I'm sorry, sorry, I don't care
Baby, I'm sorry, sorry, I want better
Don't give a fuck, let's get drunk, and then fuck, fucked up
I just wanna feel love
I'm gon' face one to feel some, 'cause she takes some
I don't got time to wait on you

I know that we ain't getting along
But I wanna see you on you're own tonight
Girl, D-N-D your phone (ooh-ooh)
I'm tryna get you on your own tonight
Bad and you know it
You tell me that you're with it, gotta show me now
Mix the Hennessy with emotions
I'm tryna let go, can you hold me down?

I said, "Baby, you better show me" (baby)
Tired of these hoes, feel like the old me (yeah)
I remember the last thing you told me
"I know you for everybody, so I might move doley"
Back on my old shit (old shit), put that in motion
Pussy so wet, feel like an ocean (oh, yeah)
Yo can't play with me, yeah, act like I don't notice (wow)
Bitches change and act like I don't notice (yeah, she changed)

I know that we ain't getting along
But I wanna see you on you're own tonight
Girl, D-N-D your phone 
I'm tryna get you on your own tonight
Bad and you know it
You tell me that you're with it, gotta show me now
Mix the Hennessy with emotions
I'm tryna let go, can you hold me down?
