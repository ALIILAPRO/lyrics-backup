		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It’s in the light that you left him
It’s in the light that you left on my door in the morn, and I know why
But, you don’t know me like that, no
It’s in the light that you left him
It’s in the light that you left on my door in the morn, and I know why
But, you don’t know me like that, no
‘Cause it’s the only thing I wanted when I had it in the morning, so
Girl, it’s the only thing that’s stopping me and I don’t ever want to say no
Because it’s too late, you’re too late about it
Tell me how it was when you were younger
And though I don’t wait, no, I can’t wait around it
Tell me how it was when you were younger
It’s in the light that you left him
It’s in the light that you left on my door at the morgue, and I know I died
But, you don’t know me like that, no
‘Cause it’s the only thing I wanted when I had it in the morning, so
Girl, it’s the only thing that’s stopping me and I don’t ever want to say no
Because it’s too late, you’re too late about it
Tell me how it was when you were younger
And though I don’t wait, no, I can’t wait around it
Tell me how it was when you were younger
I don’t know why I didn’t mind
So, tell me how it was when you were younger
I don’t know why I didn’t mind
So, tell me how it was when you were younger
I don’t know why I didn’t mind
So, tell me how it was when you were younger
I don’t know why I didn’t mind, no
