		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pain, sweet pain let's learn something from it
I see the top brother and I might just summit
I've been pining and pining for so damn long
Thinkin' it's about time someone else is strong
Thinkin' it's about time someone else is strong

Humble yourself holy roller
If you don't you're gonna' come down hard
Make amends with the boy you were, but not the man you are
We heard hymns creeping through all the trees that we grew up in
Lost so much faith through time, can't remember them

You're so tired but the top is nigh
Keep on going you'll soon arrive

How looking at the stars in the valley tend to lend a man hope
Have you wishing all the highways from this point lead home

There are mighty fine inclines and a snakey stretch of road to scale
You go wherever you go, I'll be wishing you well

You're so tired but the top is nigh
Keep on going, you'll soon arrive
You're so tired but the top is nigh
Keep on going, you'll soon arrive

Pain, sweet pain let's learned something from it
I see the top brother and I might just summit
'Cause I've been pining and pining for so damn long
Thinkin' it's about time someone else is strong
