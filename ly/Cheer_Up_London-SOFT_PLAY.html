		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, you!

Put another 0 in your paycheck
Are you done digging your grave yet?
Put another 0 in your paycheck
Are you done digging your grave?
Put another 0 in your paycheck
Are you done digging your grave yet?
Put another 0 in your paycheck
Are you done?

You're dead, already, dead, dead, already-ready
Dead, already, dead, dead, already-ready
Dead, already, dead, dead, already-ready
Dead, already, dead

Put another 0 in your paycheck
Are you done digging your grave yet?
Put another 0 in your paycheck
Are you done digging your grave? What!
Put another 0 in your paycheck
Are you done digging your grave yet?
Put another 0 in your paycheck
Are you quite done?

You're dead, already, dead, dead, already-ready
Dead, already, dead, dead, already-ready
Dead, already, dead, dead, already-ready
Dead, already, dead

Cheer up, London
It's not that bad
Cheer up, London
You're already dead and it's not that bad
Cheer up, London
It's not that bad
Cheer up, London
It's really really not that bad, is it?
How could it be
So bad
When you're already dead?

You're dead, already, dead, dead, already-ready
Dead, already, dead, dead, already-ready
Dead, already, dead, dead, already-ready
Dead, already, dead

Cheer up London
Mind The Gap
Thank you
Good night, see ya
