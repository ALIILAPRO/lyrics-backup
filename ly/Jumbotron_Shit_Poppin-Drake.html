		  (Wake up, F1LTHY)
Yeah

We ain't even out in Turks, she finna take sand
Ridin' 'round with F&N, we like to hold hands (Oogie Mane he killed it)
Boat was too sipped out, he ain't leave the bed
Damn near dipped a pint of Tech in a Code Red
If I tell this bitch to pull up, she gon' moped it
My dawgy, don't smoke on shit unless it's unleaded
I don't back and forth over no net, so just go on and dead it
See me when you see me, if it's smoke, dawgy, unleash it

Thick Moroccan bitch, this my fav', I'ma go on and beat it
Lookin' in the mirror, kiss my face, I'm too conceited
Send a girl home, call another, dawg, I'm too slime
She ain't wanna eat it on her first day, it's haram
I don't fuck with drugs, poppin' X for the first time
That shit kicked in, like a two-time world champ
Booted up, that shit hit up and downs, like a skate-ramp
She vapin' in my room, that shit lit up like a glow-lamp
Who want smoke? Okay, cool, it's they whole camp
Big shit poppin', we the ones to get your shirt damp
Niggas try to take a nigga spot, now it's too cramped
Up, 8 AM, geekin' hard, I'm a real vamp
These niggas got me fucked up, dawg, I'm too amped
Hmm-hmm, make this bitch lick me like a mail stamp
Hmm-hmm, strapped up, fuck it, I'ma die lit
Too slime, posted at the crib in a snake pit
Every time I tell you how I feel, I don't fake shit
Brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt (bih)
Brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt, okay
Everybody got a stick, we don't run fades

We ain't even out in Turks, she finna take sand
Ridin' 'round with F&N, we like to hold hands (Oogie Mane he killed it)
Boat was too sipped out, he ain't leave the bed
Damn near dipped a pint of Tech in a Code Red
If I tell this bitch to pull up, she gon' moped it
My dawgy, don't smoke on shit unless it's unleaded
I don't back and forth over no net, so just go on and dead it
See me when you see me, if it's smoke, dawgy, unleash it
