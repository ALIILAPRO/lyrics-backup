		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (In her drawers)

If you're looking for love
Know that love don't live here anymore
He left with my heart
They both walked through that door, without me
If you're trying to find pity, well you need to look somewhere else
'Cause I surely can't help you
I'm hurting myself
I've turned into someone else

I used to believe love conquers all
'Cause that's what I've seen in movies
Come to find out it's not like that at all
You see real life's much different

I don't want to see you go
I only want to see you smile
It hurts so much just thinking of
Felt like this for awhile
I can't stand to see us fail
We tried, we lied, cannot pretend 
To take us back to what we had to make us feel alive again
Hold me close, don't let me go, I hope
Tell me now is not the end

If you're looking for love
Know that love don't live here anymore
He left with my heart
They both walked through that door, without me
If you're trying to find pity well you need to look somewhere else
'Cause I surely can't help you
I'm hurting myself
I've turned into someone else (someone else, someone else, someone else) 
(Someone else, someone else, someone else, someone else, someone else)
(Someone else, someone else, someone else, someone else, someone else)
I've turned into someone else

I used to believe love conquers all
'Cause that's what I felt when you held me
I thought you'd catch me if I fall
And fill me up when I'm empty

I don't want to see you go
I only want to see you smile
It hurts so much just thinking of
Felt like this for awhile
I can't stand to see us fail
We tried, we lied, cannot pretend 
To take us back to what we had to make us feel alive again
Hold me close, don't let me go, I hope
Tell me now is not the end

If you're looking for love
Know that love don't live here anymore
He left with my heart
They both walked through that door, without me
If you're trying to find pity well you need to look somewhere else
'Cause I surely can't help you
I'm hurting myself
I've turned into someone else (someone else, someone else, someone else)

Love is patient, love is selfless (love)
Love is hopeful, love is kind (love)
Love is jealous, love is selfish
Love is helpless, love is blind

Love is patient, love is selfless
Love is hopeful, love is kind
Love is jealous, love is selfish
Love is helpless, love is blind

Love is patient, love is selfless
Love is hopeful, love is kind
Love is jealous, love is selfish
Love is hopeless, love is blind, yeah yeah
Ooh yeah

I've turned into someone else!
