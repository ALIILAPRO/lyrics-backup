		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The curtain open's, it's time to start the show
Come one, come all, step right in, speak your peace, then go

Might not even know you're here
Might not even see or hear
At the end of the rope
At the end there is no hope

Death is not Serene
No matter what they're saying
Death is not Serene
Why is no one praying?

The IV drips just like the sands of time
Drop by drop, giving life, to the line
Another shot, another pill
Slow death by chemi-kill
Just to ease the pain
Wake up and do it again

Death is not Serene
No matter what they're saying
Death is not Serene
Why is no one praying?
Death is not Serene
There's no peace in pain
Death is not Serene
Here I now lie in vain

Seeing faces, don't know the name
Hearing voices, not from where they came
Sensing the touch, the hand of fate
The taste of death, why can't this wait

The scene has played the actors hit the mark
Telling lies we are at peace, but pain won't stop
Pray for my sins, pray for my soul
To my god I give control
Now I seek the light
No more pain to endure tonight

Death is not Serene
No matter what they're saying
Death is not Serene
Why is no one praying?
Death is not Serene
There's no peace in pain
Death is not Serene
Here I now lie in vain
