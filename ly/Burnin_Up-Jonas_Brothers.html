		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm hot, you're cold
You go around like you know
Who I am, but you don't
You've got me on my toes (toes, toes)

I'm slippin' into the lava
And I'm tryna keep from goin' under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up, for you, baby

Come on, girl

I fell (I fell)
So fast (so fast)
Can't hold myself back (back, back)
High heels (high heels)
Red dress (red dress)
All by yourself
Gotta catch my breath

I'm slippin' into the lava
And I'm tryna keep from goin' under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up, for you, baby

Walk in the room
All I can see is you
Oh
Starin' me down
I know you feel it too

I'm slippin' into the lava
And I'ma try to keep from goin under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up, for you, baby

Slippin' into the lava
And I'm tryin' to keep from goin' under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up, for you, baby

Burnin' up in the place tonight
And the brothers singin' loud (and were feelin' right)
Get up and dance (don't try to fight it)
Big Rob's for real (and that's no lie)
Stop, drop and roll (and touch the floor, it keeps on burnin' up)
More and more
I got JB with me (layin' it down)
Come on, boys, bring the chorus around

I'm slippin' into the lava (burnin' up, burnin' up)
And I'm tryin' to keep from goin' under (yeah)
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter? (Come on, Nick)
'Cause I'm burnin' up
Burnin' up for you, baby
Burnin' up, burnin' up, for you, baby
