		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A common line 
I closed my eyes 
But couldn't let it go 
The perfect time 

I dropped my guard 
And lost but won somehow 
It's rather sad 
It feels like we've never 

Made it together since 
One word ahead 
And you'd be dead 
I held you in my throat 

I stumble by 
Attached to you 
I couldn't let it go 
It's rather sad 

It's really sad 
It feels like we've never 
Made it together since 
We'll never have the guts to discover 

We'll choke on it and die
