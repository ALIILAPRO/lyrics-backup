		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come to me baby, I got something to say
I been changin' your direction ev'ry step of the way
Now I bring emotion and I bring desire
And I bring the potion to set you on fire
I know you need me, there can be no doubt
You got me held inside your love and I can't get out
We must surrender to the powers that be
The angel in you and the devil in me

Warm ride , warm ride, baby just the way you are
Warm ride , warm ride, we can reach the highest star

Now I warn you women, we are two of a kind
And we both know what's coming
We got one thing in mind
I bring the pleasure, satisfaction you learn
And I got the strength to make you burn, baby, burn

Warm ride, warm ride, baby just the way you are
Warm ride, warm ride, we can reach the highest star

Why are we waiting for this love on the rise
And why am I searching for the magic that's in your eyes
We must surrender to the powers that be
The angel in you and the devil in me

Warm ride, warm ride, baby just the way you are
Warm ride, warm ride, we can reach the highest star

Warm ride, warm ride, baby just the way you are
Warm ride, warm ride, we can reach the highest star

Warm ride
