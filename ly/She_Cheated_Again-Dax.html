		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To be honest I didn't even want to make this
I knew the topic I would talk about was frowned upon and heavily debated
Everybody thinks I'm happy but I'm not, and this here is my confession
How I let a girl destroy me and then push me to the point of this depression

Yeah I'm talking about that do or die (yeah)
Yeah I'm talking 'bout that suicide (yeah suicide)
Got all these cars man but who gon' ride?
Fucked my friend a couple times
Told me all those fucking lies
So I wrote a song so you could find out how I felt inside
I swear to God I almost shot myself a couple times
I should be dead
So I had a talk with God and he told me it'd be hard
So I asked if I could stay and he could take you instead (amen)

Remember all the shit that you was telling me?
How you loved me and want nobody above me
Now it's funny all the shit that you promised is just a memory (fucking lie)
You gave me something to believe in
Then you broke me into pieces and it's fucking with me mentally
(I can't think straight)
Yeah, and I can't trust no other bitch because
I'm starting to see women as the enemy (I swear)

I saw you texting with the dude and it was cool
Because you told me you and him were just friends
Then I caught you in the bed, let it slide, took you back
And then you went and fucked the same dumb nigga again
What the fuck bitch? I gave my all to you
There's a kid that no ones knows about and me and you both know I am the father too
That means I am a part of you, you went and broke my heart in two
Then stabbed me in the back and watched me bleed and pulled an audible

Fuck! How you think this gon' end?
'Cause I been dealing with depression, social media attention
They expect me to be happy but I'm fucking depressed
I swear I'm fucking depressed
All the money in the world don't mean a thing
If you can't share it with somebody that you love and that you fucking respect (Dax)
Do you know how it feels to be awake
But all you want to do is go back to sleep? (Do you?)
Because reality is suffocating pushing on your chest
So all you want to do is go and live your life in your dreams? (can you relate?)
Do you know how it feels when the person that you love doesn't love you back?
When they say the right things but their actions are the opposite
Of everything they tell you every day to relax? (I need help)

Bitch I would've killed for you! Yeah
Man fuck all of this music shit I'd pass up on a deal for you!
Other niggas tried to fuck, I swear I only saw the real in you!
You cheated twice and now I can't deal with you!
It's Dax

Dear God
I ask that you give me the strength, to trust again
Please help me relieve this burden from my heart
I know time heals all wounds and some just take longer than others
So I'm going to trust you with this process
Amen

Everybody put your hands up if you can relate
We all been there, this is for you
