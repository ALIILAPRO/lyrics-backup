		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Staying out all night
We're all taking drugs
Acting stupid, having fun
'Til the sun is coming up
Might be too depressed
Lost in A.D.D.
You're too optimistic
But that's alright with me

I'm tryna get focused
Too excited but I gotta slow down
The moment that I saw you
Everything was true
I'm no longer empty, girl
You made me feel so new

Run to the moon
It feels like I'm living in another world
Only you
Pull me back in
Pull me back into myself
Myself

Just like the sky
When I met you, I lived a thousand lives
I'm wide awake in the middle of the night
I drank too much and I got too high

What year is it today?
It's funny how time slips away

Living in New York
It can grind you down
I tell you, it will grind you down

Run to the moon
It feels like I'm living in another world
Only you
Pull me back in
Pull me back into myself

Run to the moon
It feels like I'm living in another world
Only you
Pull me back in
Pull me back into myself
Myself
