		  Oh
Oh, oh, oh (blatt, blatt, blatt)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh (uh)
Oh, oh, oh (uh)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh (uh-uh, uh)

Yeah, not livin' enough (ayy)
This blunt, I'm takin' a puff
I'm startin' to feel like it's us
No trust, so do as you must (yeah), for real
Don't know when I stay out of town
I get dough when I stay out of town
Five hunnid chops, I got five hunnid rounds
Five hunnid plots, I got five hunnid pounds, yeah

I'm trustin' nothin' I'm told, honestly
I'm trustin' half what I'm shown
I don't pop out, but it's each to they own
My bitch, she hate when I be on my phone
Think she forgot, I got me on my phone
Not safe for me to forget that I'm known
Argue 'bout bullshit, know that you grown
Don't know, the only reason I condone it

I know how it works, I know you a flirt
She send me the flick, tagged not safe for work
Don't get your feelings hurt while tryna lurk
My bitch want Chanel, then shit, grab a purse
She told me she bad, I say, "You could do worse"
I'm born to be blessed, I live with a curse
When shit is a mess, I'm rollin' up first
I smoked on my blunt, then I hit the church
'Cause nobody get where you comin' from
You know how it get when you goin' numb
You know what we on, matter how you judged
Dealin' with bullshit, out of love
My life a story, it's not a punch-in
My life a party, it's not a function
I never needed no introduction
Know I'm a star, I'm still adjusting

And I can't go out like that
You know that's why I'm clutchin'
And I see it why they overreact
But all this shit ain't nothin'
Told me you gon' send the bread you owe me
Talkin' like you got an option
She said, "It's like you don't know you a star"
I tell her that I'm still adjusting

Yeah, not livin' enough (ayy)
This blunt, I'm takin' a puff
I'm startin' to feel like it's us
No trust, so do as you must (yeah), for real
Don't know when I stay out of town
I get dough when I stay out of town
Five hunnid chops, I got five hunnid rounds
Five hunnid plots, I got five hunnid pounds, yeah

I'm trustin' nothin' I'm told, honestly
I'm trustin' half what I'm shown
I don't pop out, but it's each to they own
My bitch, she hate when I be on my phone
Think she forgot, I got me on my phone
Not safe for me to forget that I'm known
Argue 'bout bullshit, know that you grown
I don't know, the only reason I condone it (yeah, yeah)

Oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh
