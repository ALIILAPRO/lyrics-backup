		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He's told me a million times he's sorry
I always take him back though soon I know
He'll spend the night with you and leave me crying
You don't love him but you won't let him go

Oh whiskey if you were a woman
I'd fight you and I'd win lord knows I would
Oh whiskey if you were a woman
I'd drive you from his tangled mind for good

No matter what you do I'll do it better
You'll never be the woman I could be
But you don't have a heart or any feelings
So I can't even ask for sympathy

Oh whiskey if you were a woman
I'd fight you and I'd win lord knows I would
Oh whiskey if you were a woman
I'd drive you from his tangled mind for good

Oh whiskey if you were a woman
I'd drive you from his tangled mind for good
