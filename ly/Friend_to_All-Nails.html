		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Always out for yourself
Your opinion is someone else's

Friend to all, friend to all, you're not a fucking friend to all
Friend to all, friend to all, you're not my fucking friend at all

Friend to all, friend to all, you're not a fucking friend to all
Friend to all, friend to all, you're not my fucking friend at all

Social climbing cocksucker
Five faced motherfucker
Sucking up to another
In my eyes you are a peasant
Pushing some bullshit agenda
Come to us and get rejection

You don't fucking stand for shit

Friend to all, friend to all, you're not a fucking friend to all
Friend to all, friend to all, you're not my fucking friend at all
