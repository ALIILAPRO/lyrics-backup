		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I didn't know why
Why happiness was fleeting in my life?
'Til you, my butterfly
I found you and you led me to the light (oh-oh-oh)

Oblivious to things around me
It's only in your arms I can see
That everything means nothing without you (without you)

Oh, they don't feel the things we're feeling
It's got us dancing on the ceiling
It's really not that hard for me to choose

Because I
Wouldn't have it any other way
Oh, oh, any other way
Because I
I wouldn't have it any other way
No, not any other way, oh, oh, oh

I've always been cynical
But you came in like a miracle
'Cause you made me feel again, breathe again
My heart is finally making sense

Oblivious to things around me
It's only in your arms I can see
It's really not that hard for me to choose

Because I
Wouldn't have it any other way
Oh, oh, any other way
Because I
I wouldn't have it any other way
No, not any other way, oh, oh, oh
