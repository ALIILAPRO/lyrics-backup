		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (Banger, uh)
(DJ on the beat so it's a banger)

Yeah
Sippin' Don, Don, Don
Sippin' Don, Don Perignon
Baby, I'm gone, gone, gone
Go infinity and beyond, baby, I'm the one, one, one
They was tryna count me out
Had a couple real ones with me when I was in the motherfuckin' drought
Got a couple steppers that'll lay your face down on the motherfuckin' ground
Don't think I won't do it myself, nigga, just been a while
Momma ain't raised no sucker, lil nigga, .30, let it howl
You are what you drink so I guess I got a dirty mouth

Bitch, I'm from up north, but I like chillin' in the Dirty South
You niggas ain't gettin' money, lil nigga
You still trapped in the house
My niggas movin' that white and them P's out the trap house
Maybach so big, it's so hard to back out
Talk down on the gang, that's the type of shit, make you crash out
Two hundred on the 'Rari dashboard, let a nigga, yeah, mash out
Don't do no Tom Ford, but I got an Audemar on my wrist
Gave the Richard Mil' to two hundred, gave the AP to Chris
My niggas out here trappin', yeah, every day we take a damn risk
Pneumonia in my neck, yeah, pneumonia in my fists
Everyday, I feel blessed, no stress, baby, I feel bliss
R.I.P. Juice WRLD, free Melly and Melvin, baby, "6 Kiss"
I'ma put the Corvette and the Bentley in the shop, get wide-body kits
How dare you test my gangster, lil' nigga? Know that we body shit
Always talkin' tough on the internet, but ain't really 'bout shit
Big Bird in this bitch, I'm the Ferragamo falcon

Sippin' Don, Don, Don
Sippin' Don, Don Perignon
Baby, I'm gone, gone, gone
Go infinity and beyond, baby, I'm the one, one, one
They was tryna count me out
Had a couple real ones with me when I was in the motherfuckin' drought
Got a couple steppers that'll lay your face down on the motherfuckin' ground
Don't think I won't do it myself, nigga, just been a while
Momma ain't raised no sucker, lil nigga, .30, let it howl
You are what you drink so I guess I got a dirty mouth
