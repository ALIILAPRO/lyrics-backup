		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Me plus you, I'ma tell you one time
Me plus you, I'ma tell you one time
Me plus you, I'ma tell you one time

One time
One time

When I met you girl my heart went knock knock knock
Now them butterflies in my stomach won't stop stop
And even though it's a struggle love is all we got
So we gonna keep keep climbin' till the mountain top

Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
My breath is your breath
And your heart (is my heart)

You're my one love
My one heart
My one life for sure
Let me tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
And I'ma be your one guy
You'll be my number one girl always makin' time for you
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)

You look so deep
You know that it humbles me
You're by my side and what troubles them don't trouble me
Many have called but the chosen is you
Whatever you want shawty I'll give it to you

Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
My breath is your breath
And your heart (is my heart)

You're my one love
My one heart
My one life for sure
Let me tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
And I'ma be your one guy
You'll be my number one girl always makin' time for you
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)

Shawty right there
She's got everything I need and I'ma tell her one time
One time, one time
Give you everything you need down to my last dime
She makes me happy
I know where I'll be
Right by your side 'cause she is the one
For me

You're my one love
My one heart
My one life for sure
Let me tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
And I'ma be your one guy
You'll be my number one girl always makin' time for you
I'ma me tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)

Me plus you, I'ma tell you one time
Me plus you, I'ma tell you one time
Me plus you, I'ma tell you one time

One time
One time
