		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say, I'm craving hope in this darkness you say, I'm just a joke, just a joke
She is my spice or burst swimming in the river, stinks too much
You try to let go of us but the truth is that you really don't want us
But the truth is that you really don't want us

My darling, in fire my darling, rose in fire
You say, my darling, rose in fire you say, my darling, rose in fire
She is my spice or burst swimming in the river, stinks too much
You try to let go of us but the truth is that you really don't want us

But the truth is that you really don't want us
But the truth is that you really don't want us
But the truth is that you really don't want us
