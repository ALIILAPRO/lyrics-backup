		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And the peace, it is back in our house
It came straight from your mouth
In to mine, it tasted nice

It’s over now
Just like we promised in our vows
There’s a larger sense of being proud
We’ll soak it in, you spit it out

For you,
I’m deadly over you
The weight feels lighter on the ground
I’m deadly over you
I just wait here laying down
For the hereafter to come by and calm me down

Andthedogs
Theycangoaloneforwalks
Theycaneatgrass just like thecows
Untilweretireandsettle down

And the lice
They are whispering poems to me
I hear them whisteling in my ears
When they are gone it stays with me

For you,
I’m deadly over you
The weight feels lighter on the ground
I’m deadly over you
I just wait here laying down
For the hereafter to come by and calm me down
