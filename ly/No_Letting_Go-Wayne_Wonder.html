		  Ooh-ooh
Where do you wanna, baby?
Where do you wanna, baby?
Whoa-oh-whoa-whoa
Whoa-oh-whoa-whoa, mmm
Where do you wanna, baby?

Got somebody, she is a beauty
Very special, really and truly
Take good care of me like it's her duty
Want you right by my side, night and day

No letting go, no holding back
Because you are my lady
When I'm with you it's all of that
Girl, I'm so glad we've made it
No letting go, no holding back
No holding back, no, yeah
When I'm with you it's all of that
All of that (yeah, yeah, baby)

They say good things must come to an end
But I'm optimistic about being your friend
Though I make you cry by my doings
With Keisha and Anisha
But that was back then

No letting go, no holding back
Because you are my lady
When I'm with you it's all of that
Girl, I'm so glad we've made it
No letting go, no holding back
No holding back, no, yeah
When I'm with you it's all of that
All of that, yeah, yeah, yeah

Really appreciate you loving me
After all that we've been through
Really appreciate you loving me
All times, time

Got somebody, she is a beauty
Very special, really and truly
Take good care of me like it's her duty
Want you right by my side, night and day

No letting go, no holding back
Because you are my lady
When I'm with you it's all of that
Girl, I'm so glad we've made it
No letting go, no holding back
No holding back, no, yeah
