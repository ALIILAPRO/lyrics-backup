		<p>
		  No lemme clarify, whatchu meant when u said goodbye
Cuz it’s about time that ya boy commit another crime
But i still gotta wonder why (why?)
How come every time I hear you rhyme i wanna die?
Motherfuckers walkin round like they own shit, but they ain’t shit
Ima beam em in they eye give em lasik
They too basic, I’m intermediate
The greediest mc to rock a mic man, you hearing this?
So serendipitous, ya never sippin this
The way he flip it mighta thought he was a gymnast
My shit ridiculous and oh so meticulous
I’m stackin benjamins ain’t neva gettin sick of this
Thats chump shit, I gotta fat pee-zocket
I take the lead boppin down the street boutta chop it
Cuz when he grab the mic, you best believe he never drop it
I’m shameless with my shit, like a bought a fit at hot topic
I tried to stop it, but it’s about to blow
Now come and grab ya misses cuz she kissing where the pistol go
The super sonic shit this kid be kicking call it: “DYNAMO”
Man i could do this shit with both of my eyes closed
Just keep the blinds low
I’ll blow my head off so y’all can see just where my mind go
See when I do it man it’s strictly off the cuff
I never gave a fuck I’m foreva out da cut….

I said I never gave a fuck, foreva out da cut
I said,
I said I never gave a fuck, foreva out da cut
I said I never gave a fuck, foreva out da cut
I said I never gave a fuck, foreva out da cut…

R. E. I. D.
This ain’t the end
Its somethin’ else
Yea
Who tha fuck you know do everything themselves?
No one, thats who
Its reid
Try to top it
Matta fact, try to stop it
Its dynamo
MAC DRE QUOTE
When somebody at the totally opposite walk of life
Is sitting in front of me singin’ my lyrics, word for word
And vibin’, and just knowin’, feelin’ it
And this person is, is nothin’ like me
Color, dress, curls, whatever, it’s nothin’ like me
But he’s sittin in front of me, singin’, word for word, knowin’ all the words
I’m like, yeah.
-is it like communicating’? that type of thing?
It’s definitely a communication thing
