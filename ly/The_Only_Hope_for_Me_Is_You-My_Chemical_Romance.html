		  Remember 
Remember me 
Remember me 
Remember me 
Remember me 
Remember me 

Where, where will we stand?
When all the lights go out
Across these city streets
Where were you when
All of the embers fell
I still remember there
Covered in ash
Covered in glass
Covered in all my friends
I still
Think of the bombs they built

If that's the best that I could be?
Than I'd be another memory
Can I be the only hope for you?
Because you're the only hope for me
And if we can't find where we belong
We'll have to make it on our own
Face all the pain and take it on
Because the only hope for me is you alone

How it should you be
Many years after the disasters that we've seen
What we have learned
Other than people burn in purifying flame

I say it's okay
I know you can tell
And though you can see me smile
I still
Think of the guns they sell

If there's a place that I could be
Than I'd be another memory
Can I be the only hope for you?
Because you're the only hope for me
And if we can't find where we belong
We'll have to make it on our own
Face all the pain and take it on
Because the only hope for me is you alone

The only hope for me
The only hope for me is you
The only hope
For me is you
The only hope
For me is you
The only hope
For me is you
The only hope

If there's a place that I could be
Than I'd be another memory
Can I be the only hope for you?
Because you're the only hope for me
And if we can't find where we belong
We'll have to make it on our own
Face all the pain and take it on
Because the only hope for me is you alone

The only hope for me is you 
The only hope for me is you 
The only hope for me is you 
The only hope for me is you 
The only hope for me is you 
The only hope for me is you 
The only hope for me is you 
The only hope for me is you alone

Remember me 
Remember me 
Remember me
