		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm in trouble I'm an addict
I'm addicted to this girl
She's got my heart tied in a knot
And my stomach in a whirl
But even worse I can't stop calling her
She's all I want and more
I mean damn,
What's not to adore

I've been playing to much guitar
I, I've been listening to jazz
I called so many times
I swear she's going mad
And that cellular-er will be the death of us
I swear, I swear

And oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oooh oooh oooh

I'm running my mouth just like I got her
But I surely don't
Because she's so-o-o-o-o-o-o
Rock and roll!
And out of my league
Is she out of my league?
Let's hope not

I'm in trouble
I'm so cliche
See that word just wares me out
Makes me feel like just another boy
To laugh and joke about
But even worse I can't stop calling her
I love to hear that voice
And honestly, I'm left with no choice

I've been playing to much guitar
I, I've been listening to jazz
I called so many times
I swear she's going mad
And that cellular-er will be the death of us
I swear, I swear

And oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oooh oooh oooh

I'm running my mouth just like I got her
But I surely don't
Because she's so-o-o-o-o-o-o
Rock and roll!
And out of my league
Is she out of my league?
Let's hope not

And oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oooh oooh oooh ooh ooh oooh oh
