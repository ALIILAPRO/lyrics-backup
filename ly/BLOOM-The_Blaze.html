		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What do you do my friend (friend, friend, friend, friend)
Hope your feeling well (well, well, well, well)
Give me the best you can (can, can, can, can)
Won't need your time in hand (hand, hand, hand, hand)
You need to take a breath (breath, breath, breath, breath)
To try and kill the pain (pain, pain, pain, pain)
I'll get you like a mouse (mouse, mouse, mouse, mouse)
Like the warm summer rain (rain, rain, rain ,rain)

Oh my I want to breath (breath, breath, breath, breath)
As long as you're alive (life, life, life, life)
I will beyond to live (live, live, live, live)
We're guarded for your love (life, life, life, life)
The memories we share (share, share, share, share)
Makes the trouble and shivers 
Ask why we were scared 
'Cause we might live forever (ver, ver, ver, ver)
