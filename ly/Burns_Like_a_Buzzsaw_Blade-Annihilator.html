		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Excess perversion, and we'll never let it end
You and I are making a private legend
We've got the hunger, got the thirst
You want it slow, our bodies glow, nails rake my back

Tongue licks sweet parade
Animal lust and it burns like a buzzsaw blade
Dripping wet, we laugh at this charade
Screams of love in the air tonight and it burns like a buzzsaw blade

Gratification, do you want some more
On the bed, entangled on the floor
Feel my eyes burn, we writhe until the dawn
Tease and please, humility is gone

Tongue licks sweet parade
Animal lust and it burns like a buzzsaw blade
Dripping wet, we laugh at this charade
Screams of love in the air tonight and it burns like a buzzsaw blade

Come on
What are you waiting for...

Excess perversion, and we'll never let it end
You and I are making a private legend
Feel my eyes burn, feel everything
On my knees, but I reign as your king

Tongue licks sweet parade
Animal lust and it burns like a buzzsaw blade
Dripping wet, we laugh at this charade
Screams of love in the air tonight and it burns like a buzzsaw blade
