		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  God save the prom queen
Teenage daydream
Just another dressed up heartbreak
God save the prom queen
Only eighteen
Turned her tears to diamonds in her crown

She's the first in line at the party
She's the first in line at the club
And she's got that body, always gotta flaunt it
Everybody's looking up
When she walks by you wanna be her
And your boyfriend pretends not to see her
'Cause she's got that fire, doesn't even try
Her booty has its own zip code
All the peasants bow down

God save the prom queen
Teenage daydream
Just another dressed up heartbreak
God save the prom queen
Only eighteen
Turned her tears to diamonds in her crown
(Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)

Take a look at the future
Who knows what's ahead?
There's a house on a hill with an indoor pool
And a millionaire in her bed
And the years go by and she still dreams
She's the hottest girl in town
And the makeup's stronger, gotta wear it longer
Just to keep a man around

God save the prom queen
Teenage daydream
Just another dressed up heartbreak
God save the prom queen
Only eighteen
Turned her tears to diamonds in her crown
(Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)
Diamonds in her crown
(Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)

And she lives her dreams through the magazines
And her daddy's gone and she needs someone
And she's got the looks and the boys on hooks
But she'd trade it all for a heart that's whole

God save the prom queen
(Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)
God save the prom queen
(Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)

God save the prom queen
Teenage daydream
God save the prom queen 
She turned her tears
She turned her tears to diamonds in her crown
