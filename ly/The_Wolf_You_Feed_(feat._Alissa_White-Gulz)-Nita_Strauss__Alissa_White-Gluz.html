		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The dark, the night
Only linger when you won't open your eyes
To seek and find
A world whose bark outweighs it's bite
Bite the hand! Life's a battle you command
A great divide
Dictates the howling of the mind

Though the moon outruns the sun
She reflects her light

Tell me everything you need to kill the numb
And find the strength to become
A storm that never loses speed
When it's said and done
You become the wolf you feed

The wolf you feed

Two halves, un-whole
Twisting stories to be told
Tightropes we tread
Bridge heaven and hell inside our heads
Heads held high
Contemplating fight or flight you ask me why
I say the answer lies inside

Though the moon outruns the sun
She reflects her light

Tell me everything you need to kill the numb
And find the strength to become
A wolf that never needs to feed
It's said and done
You've become the wolf you need

Tell me everything you need
(Tell me everything you need)
To kill the numb
And find the strength to become
(Strength to become)
A wolf that never needs to feed
It's said and done
You've become the wolf you need

The wolf you need
