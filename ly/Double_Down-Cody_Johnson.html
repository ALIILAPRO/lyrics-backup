		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This hole in the wall is my ace in the hole
I take it on the rocks and I get on the road, yeah
Love's a losin' game and since you dealt the cards
I've come to know this hand like the back of this bar
And in the back of this bar

I double down on the missin' you
On the wishin' you were still here with me
I double down, callin' off all bets
What I can't forget, I let the whiskey drown
'Cause your memory hangs around
Until I get a double down

You're in every song (you're in every song)
I can't turn it down (I can't turn it down)
'Cause I see you in every face of this honky tonk crowd
One sip at a time, I'll make you disappear
It's gonna take a little more than just an ice-cold beer

So I double down on the missin' you
On the wishin' you were still here with me
I double down, callin' off all bets
What I can't forget, I let the whiskey drown
'Cause your memory hangs around
Until I get a double down

Yeah, I double down, one shot won't do
Better make it two, bartender, hit me
I double down, callin' off all bets
What I can't forget, I let the whiskey drown
'Cause your memory hangs around
Until I get a double down

'Til I get a double down
