		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woo ooh, woo ooh, woo ooh
Woo ooh, woo ooh, woo ooh

Once upon a time, it was paradise
Once upon a time, I was paralyzed
Think I'm gonna miss these harbor lights
But it's time to let it go
Once upon a time, it was made for us
Woke up one day, it had turned to dust
Baby, we were found, but now we're lost
So it's time to let it go

I want my house in the hills
Don't want the whiskey and pills
I don't give up easily
But I don't think I'm down

So won't you slide away
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away
Back to the ocean, la la la, you'll slide away
So won't you slide away
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away
Back to the ocean, la la la, you'll slide away

Once upon a time, it was paradise
Once upon a time, I was paralyzed
Think I'm gonna miss these harbor lights
But it's time to let it go
Once upon a time, it was made for us (for us)
Woke up one day, it had turned to dust
Baby, we were found, but now we're lost
So it's time to let it go

Move on, we're not 17
I'm not who I used to be
You say that everything changed
You're right, we're grown now

So won't you slide away
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away
Back to the ocean, la la la, you'll slide away
So won't you slide away
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away
Back to the ocean, la la la, you'll slide away

Move on, we're not 17
I'm not who I used to be
You say that everything changed
You're right, we're grown now
