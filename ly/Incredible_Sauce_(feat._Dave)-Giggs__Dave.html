		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My whole team's makin' some changes
Man's just cuttin' them off, these hungry niggas are cravin'
And I'm just dumbin' them hogs, they're pigs and I can smell bacon
Hate, just sick of this shit, I guess they ain't had the trainin'
And I'm levelin' up to my bitches, up in the stadium
She wanna go all the way up, but look bitch, I'm single and datin'
I put my drink in the cup and I'm wavy, I'm different gravy (gravy)
Sometimes I think about stuff, like they're fakin', they didn't aid me (yeah)
Pussy, you're callin' my bluff?
You been losin' and you still lose
I'm Gang Starr, it's Guru
Your gang talk tough in the studio
My man's outside with a screw loose
Eviction, niggas are hulu
My bitch look sexy in Miu Miu
I snap my finger, she flew there
That lifestyle she can get used to
I see that there's no respect there
We 'bout to clean it all up
Just be patient, 'cause we gon' get there (gon' get there)
We 'bout to even the odds (odds)
Just crept there (crept there)
And I'm with all of the dawgs (yeah)
We got PetCare (mm)
Eatin' that corn on the cob

I'm Henry in the Champions League
It's on me if I stand on street
I need a pack to land on me
All cats don't land on feet
All good if her face is pretty
But I'm judging her hands and feet
Girl say I got handsome features
Young boy in a bando cleanin'
I'm hittin' up Bernice Burgos
You can't knock a man for dreamin'
I ain't puttin' no women on pedestals
He got sauce, that sauce ain't credible
I'm sittin' in Matsuhisa
Restaurant's old, but the sauce incredible
Don't provoke him, MC soak him
Gonna get sauced, incredible

I find these niggas offensive
Nowadays and I'm just more to myself
And I don't care for who I keep friends with (that's right)
I made a call up to God, said my prayers, 'cause our niggas sendin' (sendin')
Think I'm soft and I'm cuddly, I can't get wet, 'cause I turn to gremlin (jeez)
There's no happy endin'
Fuck trendin', nigga, I'm trendy (trendy)
It's school days and it's assembly
Gangly lent me extendo
Said "Hold that", but it's just temporary
My bitch don't like when I'm friendly
Her friends don't like to offend me
And I don't like to offend them
So now we're makin' good memories
Who can I trust? It's only, it's only us (it's only us)
Baby, just don't fall in love
I hustle for days, it's me (yeah)
I need somethin' to play with (jeez)
I'm so fuckin' ragin'
This nigga had so many chances and I couldn't save him (save him)
Your company ain't cut for this table (yeah)
It's Giggs, the hustler staple

I'm Henry in the Champions League
It's on me if I stand on street
I need a pack to land on me
All cats don't land on feet
All good if her face is pretty
But I'm judging her hands and feet
Girl, say I got handsome features
Young boy in a bando cleanin'
I'm hittin' up Bernice Burgos
You can't knock a man for dreamin'
I ain't puttin' no women on pedestals
He got sauced, that sauce ain't credible
I'm sittin' in Matsuhisa
Restaurant's old, but the sauce incredible
Don't provoke him, MC soak him
Gonna get sauced, incredible

Ganja and it's doused in chemicals
We're sellin' relief, it's medical
We're sellin' relief, it's chronic
We fuck, but it's still platonic
You must be smokin' chronic
I beef my shadow, I feel like Sonic
Buy a Hermes bag and olive
Princess treatment, want it you got it
Try and rob my man, but he saw that comin' like That's So Raven
My girl can't call my phone and tell me she gonna go Afro Nation
I grew up with yardies, Asians, grew up with Somalis
Ha, bear with me, be patient
Time in black and my cash Caucasian
Ha-ha, yeah, lingerie on a special occasion
