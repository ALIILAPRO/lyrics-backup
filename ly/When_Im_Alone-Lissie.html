		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I turned my back
You were gone in a flash
Like you always do
You've always gone off somewhere else

And when the phone rang
And I thought it was you
And I sprung like a kid who just got out of school
But it's almost always never you, never you

I screamed like a child
My insides went wild

When I'm alone with you
You make me feel, you make me feel
When I'm alone with you
You are the one, you are the one

And when I reach out and I only grab air
And it kills me to think that you never did care
And it's hopeless
You've always run off somewhere else

I'm throwing a tantrum
Why are you such a phantom?

When I'm alone with you
You make me feel, you make me feel
When I'm alone with you
You are the one, you are the one

When I'm alone with you
You make me feel, you make me feel
When I'm alone with you
You are the one, you are the one

Remind me of home
When you're around me
Next time you leave
Don't go without me
No, don't go
No, no
Yeah, yeah

(When I'm alone with you)
You make me feel, you make me feel
(When I'm alone with you)
You are the one, you are the one

(When I'm alone with you)
You make me feel, you make me feel
(When I'm alone with you)
You are the one, you are the one
