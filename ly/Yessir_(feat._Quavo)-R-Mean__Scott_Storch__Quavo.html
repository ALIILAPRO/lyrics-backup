		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Big racks, big pack, drop a stack on it (racks)
Big player, I can drip with the MAC on me (player)
Bad lil' bitch with the sack on her (sack)
Posted in the back, I attack on her (yeah)
Beach house on the island, yeah (beach)
North side, where we wylin', yeah (yeah)
She a hood thing, she stylin', yeah (woah)
Good brain, no college, yeah (yessir)

Big yachts right by the pier (yachts)
Let my money talk, ain't no convo here (money)
Big guap, that guala, yeah
He ain't got no money, get him out of here (he broke)
She know that she bad and bougie, ayy (she know)
I be throwin' bands like I'm Juicy J (bands)
My girl got a girl and that girl got a bad bitch
Gave 'em all the same room key, ayy (woo)
R dash and huncho, yessir (yessir)
Get the bag pronto, yessir (yessir)
Shawty bust it down, I'm the one-one-one (one)
That booty go dumb, du-du-dumb, dumb-dumb

Big racks, big pack, drop a stack on it (racks)
Big player, I can drip with the MAC on me (player)
Bad lil' bitch with the sack on her (sack)
Posted in the back, I attack on her (yeah)
Beach house on the island, yeah (beach)
North side, where we wylin', yeah (yeah)
She a hood thing, she stylin', yeah (woah)
Good brain, no college, yeah

I roll with a sack, baby (sack, baby)
Let me take you back to the trap, baby (trap, baby)
R-mean and huncho across the map, baby ('cho)
It's a hundred bands in my lap, baby (facts)
Jumpin' out, we flexin' the ice necklace (flex)
Put you on the road, you and your bestie (road)
Designer your clothes, you get the message (woah)
Hopin' out, exposed, the cameras is pressin' (exposed, flash)
Yessir, livin' like a boss, yessir (boss)
Chromeheart, denim, it's a cross, yessir (cross)
You know a nigga blessed, yessir (blessed)
Wake up everyday about a check, yessir (yessir)

Big racks, big pack, drop a stack on it (racks)
Big player, I can drip with the MAC on me (player)
Bad lil' bitch with the sack on her (sack)
Posted in the back, I attack on her (yeah)
Beach house on the island, yeah (beach)
North side, where we wylin', yeah (yeah)
She a hood thing, she stylin', yeah (woah)
Good brain, no college, yeah

Yeah, it's a family ting, you know?
Yessir
