		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitches think I'm crazy but I'm normal
I just come off as a psycho maniac when I'm performing
That's an act so I won't bore you to death
'Cause I adore you, and it's the summer so

Can you meet me by the lake
At the park, or in your room?

Can you meet me by the lake
At the park, or in your room?

You can bring your bitches, I'mma bring my niggas
You can practice liking I, I'mma practice that guitar, baby
It's summer camp Golf Wang where the talking trees are
You and girls can roll if you

If you meet me by the lake
At the park, or in your room?

Can you meet me by the lake
At the park, or in your room?

If you meet me by the pier, bring a peer, we can menage
Ooh, your girl friend Nicki gots the back I like to massage
I'll be in the city with them actresses the Nissan
Is down there in the bottom of the lake
I'll make sure you have a good time, a good time
I'll make sure it's a good time, a good time for you

Can you meet me by the lake
At the park, or in your room?

Can you meet me by the lake
At the park, or in your room?

Love sick, where's the clinic aid, we're young
Fun is what we're having, fuck it, pour a glass of lemonade
It's snow cone and Pop Tarts I got and I got you
Let me take a dip and you can take a break
That's only if you meet me by the lake

Could you meet me by the lake? (Drown today)

Meet me at the lake around ten (Come through)
Meet me at the lake around ten (It's cool, wanna kick it)
Meet me by the lake at ten
If I'm not there just call
And if you need a way there
I'll ride you on my handle bars

Meet me at the lake around ten (Come through)
Meet me at the lake around ten (It's cool, wanna kick it)
Meet me by the lake at ten
If I'm not there just call
And if you need a way there
I'll ride you on my handle bars

Kissing under moonlight
I can bring you to my tree house
We'll be fucking on the rooftop
If you're not down, we can just make out

Meet me at the lake around ten (Come through)
Meet me by the lake at ten
If I'm not there just call
And if you need a way there
I'll ride you on my handle bars
