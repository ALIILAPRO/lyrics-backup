I'm in my 'Gac
I wanna dance
I'm on that 'Gac, I wanna dance
Come get yo' man
Before I put him in a trance
I'm in my 'Gac
I'm on that 'Gac, I wanna dance
Come get ya man

And he keep on making them noises (yeah)
Damn, fuck, shit ooh (fuck, oh)

Drop me a pin where you at (at)
I'm gonna come 'round like a 'Lac (like a 'Lac)
I get in my 'Gac on that 'Gac ('Gac on that 'Gac)
He call me Megan the Mack (Megan the Mack)
It's turning him on how I rap (turning him on how I rap)
He doggin' it out, make it fat (make it fat)
And he tell me, "Girl, you the best" (girl, you the best)
But I already know what I am, yeah, yeah

Getting high like a fire (high like a fire)
Bitch, I pull up on ya boo (bitch, I pull up on ya boo)
Tell his ass get inside
Let a real bitch slide (let a real bitch slide)
Got him drinking out the fire (yeah)
He know I'm dropping that game
But I'm not gone tell him a lie

Drank, drank, I been drankin'
I hit you up when I'm faded
I know you tired of me playin'
I call you back to back
Call you back until you call me
Call me back baby
I know it's late, you been waiting
My Cognac kisses make you crazy
These other bitches can't fade me

You look good, you look good to me
Give me hug, it feel good to me
Hold me up, you too good to me
Cut 'em off, I know you would for me
He like, "Damn, goddamn girl
You should let me gone be ya man girl"
And he know I only agree
When I'm getting full of the drink

Went Courvoisier crazy
Got him thinking he my baby
Don't care what he saying (no)
I'm speaking all body language (body)
Fall in love would be dangerous (yeah)
Fuck you like I've been dranking (uh)
Cognac on my blankets (yeah)

Come get yo' man
Before I put him in a trance

My Cognac kisses make you crazy
These other bitches can't fade me
