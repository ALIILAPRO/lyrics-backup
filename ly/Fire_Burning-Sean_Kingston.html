		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somebody call 9-1-1
Shawty fire burning on the dance floor, whoa
(Fire burning, fire burning) What a gwaan?
Kingston
Let's go, hey (hey, hey, hey)
RedOne (hey, hey)

Shawty got that super thang
Hotter than the sun of the south of Spain
Got me soon as I walked through the door, oh
My pocket started tickling
The way she dropped it low, that thang
Got me wanna spend my money on her, her

She get it, pop it, lock it, drop it
That birthday cake
Got a candle, need to blow that crazy flame away
Now take my red, black card and my jewelry
Shawty is cool like the fire, cool like fire

Somebody call 9-1-1
Shawty fire burning on the dance floor, whoa
I gotta cool her down
She gon' bring the roof to ground on the dance floor, whoa
She's fire burning, fire burning on the dance floor
That little shawty's fire burning on the dance floor
She's fire burning, fire burning on the dance floor
That little shawty's fire burning on the dance floor
(Fire burning, fire burning)

That body is a masterpiece
The order is one in every hundred years
But ain't no doubt I'm taking it home, home
I'm afraid we'll blow them legs
Little mama game is about to change
She'll be on covers over the world, world

She get it, pop it, lock it, drop it
That birthday cake
Got a candle, need to blow that crazy flame away
Now take my red, black card and my jewelry
Shawty is cool like the fire, cool like fire

Somebody call 9-1-1
Shawty fire burning on the dance floor, whoa
I gotta cool her down
She gon' bring the roof to ground on the dance floor, whoa
She's fire burning, fire burning on the dance floor
That little shawty's fire burning on the dance floor
She's fire burning, fire burning on the dance floor
That little shawty's fire burning on the dance floor

She got that fire in her dance 
That'll make them fella's run around (hey)
No exit pon the dance floor so them boys want more (hey)
She got that fire in her dance 
That'll make them fella's run around
Madem, give them a run, everybody, sing it now, hey
No exit pon the dance floor so them boys want more
What a gwaan?
Let's go
Madem, let's go, hey

She get it, pop it, lock it, drop it
That birthday cake
Got a candle, need to blow that crazy flame away
Now take my red, black card and my jewelry
Shawty is cool like the fire, cool like fire

Somebody call 9-1-1
Shawty fire burning on the dance floor, whoa
I gotta cool her down
She gon' bring the roof to ground on the dance floor, whoa
She's fire burning, fire burning on the dance floor
That little shawty's fire burning on the dance floor
She's fire burning, fire burning on the dance floor
That little shawty's fire burning on the dance floor

Somebody call 9-1-1
