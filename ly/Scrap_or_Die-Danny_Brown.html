		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lookin' at the house for a bout a whole month
Family live there got put out last month
My uncle sniffing blow while I'm rolling up a blunt
His homie in the basement smoking crack wit' my aunt
Tonight's that night we bout to get right
Piled up in a van wit' a couple flashlights
Metal crowbars gonna get us through the door
We come to take everything fuck the landlord
So now we at the place skullys on bare face
Bout to leave this bitch bare and strip the whole place
My unc' took outside he ripping down the gutters
So we inside tearing up this motherfucker
Bust open the walls just to get the wiring
Took the hot water tank and left over appliances
Aluminum siding and had to come back
'Cause the furnace so big it wouldn't fit in the back

Now its copper by the pound (pound)
Wire by the inch (inch)
Got a check on the first 
And its gone by the fifth (yeah)
Scrap or Die Nigga
And you might be laughing at it 'cause you know the shit is true (tru)
Rusty flat bed truck the color of doo-doo (uh ha)
Scrap or Die Nigga

Early morning next day at the junkyard
Got four loads bout to get broke off
But these niggas slick I swear I'm going off
Put the work on the scale and I swear that bitch was off
'Cause I know we had way more than that
Fuck it, split it up, ay I get more than that
These niggas always slick on that bullshit
Cheat you out a couple bucks on some dope fiend shit
So we back in the hood plot the next lick
Got a school closed down and I think we should hit it
Just waiting on my unc' to get back from the clinic
And we gone go over there and see whats up wit' it
Now we up in it taking old computers
Until we fucking heard, "Don't move or I shoot ya"
Fucked up hook caught us tryna cash in
Now we gotta B&E case of trespassing

Now its copper by the pound (pound)
Wire by the inch (inch)
Got a check on the first 
And its gone by the fifth (yeah)
Scrap or Die Nigga
And you might be laughing at it 'cause you know the shit is true (tru)
Rusty flat bed truck the color of doo-doo (uh ha)
Scrap or Die Nigga
