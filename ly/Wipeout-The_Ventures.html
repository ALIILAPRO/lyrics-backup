		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a man who leads a life of danger
To everyone he meets he stays a stranger
With every move he makes another chance he takes
Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow

Secret Agent Man
Secret Agent Man
They giving you a number
And taken' away your name

Beware of pretty faces that you find
A pretty face can hide an evil mind
Oh, be careful what you say
Or you will give yourself away
Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow

Secret Agent Man
Secret Agent Man
They giving you a number
And taken' away your name

Swinging on the Riviera one day
And then later in the Bombay Alan next day
I know you let the wrong words slip
While kissing persuasive lips
Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow

Secret Agent Man
Secret Agent Man
They giving you a number
And taken' away your name
