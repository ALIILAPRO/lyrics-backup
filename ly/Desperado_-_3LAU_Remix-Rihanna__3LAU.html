		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Desperado
Sitting in a old Monte Carlo
A man whose heart is hollow, uh
Take it easy
I'm not tryna go against you
Actually, I'm going withcha

Gotta get up out of here and 
You ain't leaving me behind
I know you won't, 'cause we share common interests 
You need me, there ain't no leaving me behind
Never, no, no, just want outta here, yeah
Once I'm gone, ain't no going back

If you want
We could be, runaways 
Running from any sight of love
Yeah, yeah, there ain't nothing
There ain't nothing here for me
There ain't nothing here for me anymore
But I don't wanna be alone

(Oh)
(Oh)
(Oh)

Desperado
Sitting in an old Monte Carlo
We've both had our hearts broken, uh
Take it easy
I'm not tryna go against you
I can be a lone wolf witcha

Gotta get up out of here 
And you ain't leaving me behind
I know you won't, 'cause we share common interests 
You need me, there ain't no leaving me behind
Never, no, no, both want outta here, yeah
Once we're gone, ain't no going back

If you want
We could be runaways
Running from any sight of love
Yeah, yeah, there ain't nothing
There ain't nothing here for me
There ain't nothing here for me anymore
I don't wanna be alone

Dear desperado
Yeah, I don't wanna be alone
Dear desperado
Yeah, I don't wanna be alone

If you want
We could be runaways
Running from any sight of love
Yeah, yeah, there ain't nothing
There ain't nothing here for me
There ain't nothing here for me anymore
But I don't wanna be alone

If you want
We could be runaways
Running from any sight of love
Yeah, yeah, there ain't nothing
There ain't nothing here for me
There ain't nothing here for me anymore
But I don't wanna be alone

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
