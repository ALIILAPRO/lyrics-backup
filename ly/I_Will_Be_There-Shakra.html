		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never had this feeling
I always dreamed about
Lost and left alone on my own
Another day of longing
Another day in tears
‘Til I looked into your eyes and lost my mind

You showed me all the reasons
That life is worth living for
You took my hand and said
You’ll never let me go, won’t let me go

You are the sun in my sky
That dries my tears when I cry
And I will be there, I’ll be there for you
You are my light in the night
For ever I’ll hold on tight
And I will be there, I’ll be there for you

The day on which you leave me
Will be the day I die
You know my broken heart would fall apart
Another day without you
Would be a day in tears
Please don’t never ever go away

You showed me all the reasons
That life is worth living for
Oh baby we should be
Together for all the time, for all the time

You are the sun in my sky
That dries my tears when I cry
And I will be there, I’ll be there for you
You are my light in the night
For ever I’ll hold on tight
And I will be there, I’ll be there for you

You are the reason I live 
And I swear you can believe
That I will be there, 
I’ll be there, I’ll be there for you!
