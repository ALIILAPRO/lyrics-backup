		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it the way I talk sweet?
The way my skin is soft?
Or how I can be a bitch?
Make you keep your fingers crossed?
Is it the way that I praise you?
The way that I please you?
Or how fast I change my mind
And get scared that I might leave you?

Could spend your whole life, but you couldn't
Describe what makes a woman
She's always been a perfect mystery
Could spend your whole life, but you couldn't
Describe what makes a woman
And that's what makes a woman to me

Is it the way I cut my hair
And put no makeup on?
I feel most beautiful
Doing what the fuck I want
Is it that my intuition
Is never really off?
I need tissues for my issues
And Band-Aids for my heart

Could spend your whole life, but you couldn't
Describe what makes a woman
She's always been a perfect mystery
Could spend your whole life, but you couldn't
Describe what makes a woman
And that's what makes a woman to me

That's what makes a woman to me
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Is it the way we keep
The whole world turning
In a pair of heels?
Yeah, that's what makes a woman

There it is, Katheryn
