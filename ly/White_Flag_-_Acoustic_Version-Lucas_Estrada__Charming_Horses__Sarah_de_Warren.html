		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you think that
I shouldn't still love you
Or tell you that
But if I didn't say it, well
I'd still have felt it
Where's the sense in that?

I promise
I'm not trying to make your life harder
Or return to where we were (or return to where we were)

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

Yeah, yeah
Oh (I'm in love)
I'm in love and surrender

I know I left too much mess and
Destruction to come back again (to come back again)
And I caused nothing but trouble
I understand if you can't talk to me again (talk to me again)

And if you live by the rules of 'it's over'
Then I'm sure that that makes sense (that makes sense)

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

Ah, ah
Oh (I'm in love)
I'm in love and surrender

And when we meet
Which I'm sure we will
All that was there
Will be there still
I'll let it pass
And hold my tongue
And you will think
That I've moved on

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I'm in love
I'm in love and surrender (ah)
Yeah
I'm in love
I'm in love and surrender (ah)

I will go down with this ship (ah)
And I won't put my hands up and surrender (ah)
There will be no white flag above my door (oh, ah)
I'm in love and always will be

I'm in love
I'm in love and surrender
