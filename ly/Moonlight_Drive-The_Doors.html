		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's swim to the moon, uh-huh
Let's climb through the tide
Penetrate the evenin' that the
City sleeps to hide
Let's swim out tonight, love
It's our turn to try
Parked beside the ocean on our
Moonlight drive

Let's swim to the moon, uh-huh
Let's climb through the tide
Surrender to the waiting worlds
That lap against our side
Nothin' left open and no
Time to decide
We've stepped into a river on our
Moonlight drive

Let's swim to the moon
Let's climb through the tide
You reach your hand to hold me
But I can't be your guide
Easy, I love you as I
Watch you glide
Falling through wet forests on our
Moonlight drive, baby
Moonlight drive

Come on, baby, gonna take a little ride, down
Down by the ocean side, gonna get real close
Get real tight
Baby gonna drown tonight
Goin' down, down, down
