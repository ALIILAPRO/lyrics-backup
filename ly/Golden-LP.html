		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If it wasn't love
Then it wasn't love
Are we really done
Is there more to come
If it's not enough
Then it's not enough
If it wasn't us
Then it wasn't us

There's something about when you know it, you know it
Don't let it be gone in a moment, a moment
Don't try to be cool, baby show it, show it
Just own it, own it

We are golden
We're not broken
We are golden
We're not broken, yeah
Golden

When you're coming back from a heart attack
All that history, all that chemistry
From the what could be to the what are we
It's so deep

There's something about when
You know it, you know it
Don't let it be gone in a moment, a moment
Don't try to be cool baby show it, show it
Just own it own it

We are golden
We're not broken
We are golden
We're not broken, yeah

Again and again and again and again
Again and again and again and again

Ohh, don't get broken before it gets beautiful
Ohh, don't get broken before it gets beautiful
Ohh, don't get broken before it gets beautiful, ayy, ayy
Ohh, don't get broken before it gets beautiful
We're so beautiful

We are golden
We're not broken, yeah
We are golden
We're not broken, yeah

Again and again and again and again
Again and again and again and again

Golden
