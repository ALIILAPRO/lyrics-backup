		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  At first flash of Eden
We race down to the sea
Standing there on freedom's shore

Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun

Can you feel it
Now that spring has come
And it's time to live in the
Scattered sun

Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun

Waiting for the sun

Waiting
Waiting
Waiting
Waiting
Waiting
Waiting
Waiting
Waiting
Waiting for you to
Come along
Waiting for you to
Hear my song
Waiting for you to
Come along
Waiting for you to tell me what went wrong

This is the strangest
Life I've ever
Known

Can't you feel it
Now that spring has come
That it's
Time to live in the
Scattered sun

Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun

Waiting for
The sun
