		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your smoke in my hair
Hot and dirty like the L.A. air
That face, baby, it ain't fair
But you don't know what you don't know
What you don't know, uh

Ooh-ooh, so you wanna talk about power?
Ooh-ooh, let me show you power

I eat boys like you for breakfast
One by one hung on my necklace
And they'll always be mine
It makes me feel alive
I eat boys like you for breakfast
And I know that you tried your bestest
I never said it's right
But I'm gonna keep doing it

I'm sick, yeah, I'm sick
And honestly, I'm getting high off it
Do you wanna see a magic trick?
'Cause you don't know what you don't know
But I know

Ooh-ooh, so you wanna talk about power?
Ooh-ooh, let me show you power

I eat boys like you for breakfast
One by one hung on my necklace
And they'll always be mine
It makes me feel alive
I eat boys like you for breakfast
And I know that you tried your bestest
I never said it's right
But I'm gonna keep doing it

I eat boys, I eat boys
I eat boys, I eat boys

Your smoke in my hair
Hot and dirty like the L.A. air
That face, baby, it ain't fair
But you don't know what you don't know
What you don't know

I eat boys like you for breakfast
One by one hung on my necklace
And they'll always be mine
It makes me feel alive
I eat boys like you for breakfast
And I know that you tried your bestest
I never said it's right
But I'm gonna keep doing it
