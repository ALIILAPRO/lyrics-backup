		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wake up
I don't feel too bright
But I'm already halfway recovered when I look to my right
I take a gum
And roll on up to you
To tell you that we slept our way right through the morning dew
But it's allright

Sunday you make my mind drift away
Sunday I may have given you away

I think less, but I feel much more
I visit places in my head I've never visited before
But there are things
Sunday can't change
Like the fact that when I see you girl
You put a smile on my face
And thats allright
Yes itâ€™s 

Sunday you make my mind drift away
Sunday I may have given you away
To a very special girl and she really likes you, too
And together we use you to do that thing that we do


Sunday you make my mind drift away
Sunday I may have given you away
To a very special girl and she really likes you too
And together we use you to do that thing that we do
