		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feel it heavy in my bones now
Feel like everybody goes out
And smiles for the 'gram, yeah, tried but I can't
Prayer in the shape of Prozac
Try to medicate the lows that
Come and meet me in the night time, losing track of my time

Mama said gonna be all right
But mama don't know what it's like in my mind
Mama said that the sun gon' shine
But mama don't know what it's like to want to die

I can't carry this anymore
Heavy from the hurt inside my veins
I can't carry this anymore
Wonder what it's like to be okay

Would you like me if I drank that?
If you wanted I could take that
I'll do anything for love, I don't feel like I'm enough
You can probably see right through me
'Cause I can promise if you knew me
You would probably walk away, no you wouldn't want to stay, oh

Mama said gonna be all right
But mama don't know what it's like in my mind
Mama said that the sun gon' shine
But mama don't know what it's like to want to die

I can't carry this anymore
Heavy from the hurt inside my veins
I can't carry this anymore
Wonder what it's like to be okay

I know I'll be fine, it's just that
Every time this comes back
Tell my maker up above that
I have had enough and

I can't carry this anymore
Heavy from the hurt inside my veins
I can't carry this anymore
Wonder what it's like to be okay
