		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You gotta D Stackz beat)
Nigga, this is what that jungle do
You been plottin', nigga, wasn't you?
I shoulda never even fucked with you

Yeah, I started in the back, had to skip the line though
I'ma keep that shit a stack 'til my fuckin' time go
Niggas throw you in the shade 'cause they wanna shine though
Nigga throw me in the grave in a Ferragamo
Man I can't believe they killed my fuckin' bro Quado
Shit was so deep I had to say that with my eyes closed
That shit made me wanna treat a nigga like he John Doe
Nine on me, Rondo, now that nigga John Doe, ha

This is all I ever wanted, nigga
Why would I let you take it from me, nigga?
I ain't stupid, ain't no dummy nigga
A couple fingers on a couple triggers
Fuck with you, why would I fuck with you?
You been plottin', nigga, wasn't you?
I shoulda been watchin' from the jump with you
Fuck it, this is what that jungle do

Started, what I started
Anybody want a problem, this is my shit
Tell 'em if they want a problem I'm from Highbridge
Got a nigga with a shotgun up in my whip
Makin' bitches go retarded with this hard dick
Why you think my name is Artist? I'm an artist
I woke up to a m√©nage, I'm just bein' honest
I get money, if I want it, I'ma cop it
If a nigga want static let him have it
Have you ever seen a mini semi-automatic?
It go dumb like a drum, hear the beat blastin'
When it come to that fire, I'm a fuckin' dragon, ha

Nigga, this is what that jungle do
Nigga, this is what that jungle do
You been plottin', nigga, wasn't you?
I shoulda never even fucked with you

I was walkin' in the rain with my Timbs on
Steppin' over puddles full of pain, it's a big storm
Thirteen on my Balmains, it's a big storm
In the club love to make it rain
Like what nigga, we don't fuck withcha
Know I'm all about my bucks nigga, I don't trust niggas
Ever since I was a young nigga comin' up, nigga
Ain't nobody show me love nigga, so it's fuck niggas
It's just us, nigga

Nigga, this is what that jungle do
Nigga, this is what that jungle do
That jungle turned me to a monster
That jungle made me go harder
That jungle turned me to a monster
That jungle made me go harder
That jungle turned me to a monster
That jungle made me go harder
That jungle turned me to a monster
That jungle made me go harder

Jungle turned me to a monster
Nigga, this is what that jungle do
Nigga, this is what the jungle do
Been plottin', nigga, wasn't you?
Shoulda never even fucked with you
