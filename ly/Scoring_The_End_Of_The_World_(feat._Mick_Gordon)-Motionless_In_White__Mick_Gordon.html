		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Long live our symphony, in infamy, where dissonance remains
We score the final scene, adrenaline now coursing through our veins

Long live our symphony, this infantry survived a thousand suns
Silent, they still attack, we fire back with notes instead of guns

We echo, reverberate
Then leave them behind
(Fight)

Landmines composed in command lines
Amplify or die, it's us or them (oh)
This enclave's tearing through the airwaves
Screaming a war-torn requiem
Be not afraid

Trapped in hypocrisy's cacophony, all tension no release
When it's so hard to see the harmony, it's time to end the peace
(So stop the peace)

Stop their choir, change their key
Hit back hard in our reprise
Bring their fanfare to its knees

And we'll leave them behind

Landmines composed in command lines
Amplify or die, it's us or them (oh)
This enclave's tearing through the airwaves
Screaming a war-torn requiem
Be not afraid

Don't fall back, orchestrate the fallout
Score the ending of the world on this battleground
Survive yet another militant strike
Half-dead, but we're living up to the hype
Half-dead, as the speakers detonate like

Landmines composed in command lines
Amplify or die, it's us or them (oh)
(It's us or them)
This enclave's tearing through the airwaves
This is our war-torn requiem

The dawning of a new age
These aren't just notes on a page
These are the weapons of rebirth (requiem)
The dawning of a new age
Where we will take back the stage
To score the ending of the Earth
We're not afraid

Don't fall back, orchestrate the fallout
Score the ending of the world on this battleground
