		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alright!
I guess you're caught by surprise
Because I keep turning up
When you just didn't expect me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

'Cause I
I'm like obsessed by your life
And I don't know what to do
If I'm not focusing on you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (OK!)

I know you told me to stay away
But I'm a freaky girl and I wanna stay
I wanna get, get, get with you like you're mine
I don't care I want you dead or alive

OoOo 
There's something hidden in your eyes
And I don't think you're being wise
'Cause you shall hide nothing from me
And baby, let me tell you why
Dead or alive
Why
I don't care, I want you dead or alive

Tonight
I will be lurking around
Because I know you'll be down
I want your undivided attention
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (OK!)

I know you told me to stay away
But I'm a freaky girl and I wanna stay
I wanna get, get, get with you like you're mine
I don't care I want you dead or alive

OoOo...
