		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Driftin' round the streets like we own them, sizzling hot and my crew is steady holdin' to what we got. It's like fire on ground, sun is blazing and theres love all around.

I see it all from the ceiling, too close the edge got to lean in, I want you to feel what I'm feelin' right now.

Oh babe, can you please meet up with me. I cant cool down now, but I know how to fall back now.

It's a great sunny day, walking in the sun with my friends, started feeling again, again.

It's a great sunny day, walking in the sun with my friends, started feeling again, again.

Day's s about to end, but night's forgiving. all the stupid things that you've done means nothing to anyone.

I love It when my skin gets warm. The sun is fading and theres love all around.

I see it all from the ceiling, too close the edge got to lean in, I want you to know what I'm feelin' right now.

Oh babe, can you please meet up with me. I cant cool down now, but I know how to fall back now.

It's a great sunny day, walking in the sun with my friends, started feeling again, again.

It's a great sunny day, walking in the sun with my friends, started feeling again, again.
