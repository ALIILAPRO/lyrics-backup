		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ahhhhh
Relevance is taken
All relevance is taken
Blown away by the fast misfortune
Past gold days take a step back try again
Who's to say that you won't return in flames you spread only just to burn your hands

You wana sprout to the top to perch and stare down
Ha ha ha
Good luck kid
Every step is immersed to last so you'll drown
Good luck kid

Oh
You can bite the hand that feeds it'll just be toxic
As if it'd ever reach down to you
They were given A key to the lock but they tossed it
Those demons stare to convey a reaction
You left your eyes wide open
They see you're true intentions
Tell me your name!?
That's all irrelevant
Let me reclaim!
You fuckin piece of shit!
You've got no light left to offer me
Recite the prayers I follow you
You can repeat the words i say too,
But I'm afraid they'll burn your tongue right through

Can you feel
The colour in your veins?
It's gone pitch black
This isn't destiny
It's just what you became
Pure scum extract

You wana sprout to the top to perch and stare down
Ha ha ha
Good luck kid
Every step is immersed to last so you'll drown
Good luck kid
If all you ever do is fall cuz you lost your wings
What feathers born would call you king?
Then just accept defeat in
This world has long forgotten

As you collapse, there's no one left to blame
So Let my warnings stain
Damned are the ones who share your
Name
Damned!
Fuckin damned by the sea
Condemned by the trees
They're hissing, "thin branches can't support their leaves"
Dead broken
Gone are the dreams and aspirations
Have fun down there! Ha
Dead broken
Your relevance is taken
Damned!
Your creation is destruction
Damned!
All hope has been abandoned
Now

You wana sprout to the top to perch and stare down
Ha ha ha
Good luck kid!
Every step is immersed to last so you'll drown
Good luck kid!
If all you ever do is fall cuz you lost your wings
What feathers born would call you king?
Then just accept defeat in
This world has long forgotten you
Your creation is destruction
Your relevance is taken
