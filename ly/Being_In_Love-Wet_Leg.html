		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need a lie down
Only just got up
I feel so uninspired
I feel like giving up
I feel like someone has
Punched me in the guts
But I kinda like it 
'Cause it feels like being in love

Being in love
Being in love
Being in love

I lost my appetite
I cannot sleep at night
I cannot concentrate
I do not feel too great
The world is caving in
And I'm kinda struggling
But I kinda like it 
'Cause it feels like being in love

Being in love
Being in love
Being in love
Being in 
La la la la, la la la la la
La la la la, la la la la la

I tried to meditate 
But I just medicate
Pour me another drink
Don't wanna have to think
I think I lost my shit
Some kind of fucked up trip
But I kinda like it 
'Cause it feels like being in love

Being in love
Being in love
Being in love
Being in love
Being in love
Being in love
Being in love
Being in
La la la la, la la la la la
La la la la, la la la la la
