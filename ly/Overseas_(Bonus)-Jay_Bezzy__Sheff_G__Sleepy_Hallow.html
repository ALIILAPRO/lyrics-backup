Huh, look
I just be focused on bringin' packs in
They like, "What's on his hip?"
They know he packin', huh, look
Run up, tell 'em, run up, boy, I wish they would, huh
Run up, tell 'em, run up, boy, I wish they would, huh
I was born a winner, I would never forfeit, huh
Push me to the limit, why would you wan' go there, huh
I done took her places, she was never brought here, look
Never go there, thought she'd never go there, huh

Yeah, check the carats on the diamond ring, huh
I could make her feel good, no vitamins, huh
And she got that fire, I'm the fireman, huh
She don't want no liar, want an honest man, uh
So let's be honest, uh
You know I'm on it
Fuckin', pull on your bonnet
Don't want 'em showin' love
So don't act like you don't want it
I know I'm fucked up, I answered my demons callin', uh

I done seen the realest people fold
Heart cold, like I left it in the snow
If you real, take you places you want go
If you mine, best believe I make it known
'Cause I could take you overseas
You won't get over me
Love you for life, I'm freakin' you just like I'm Jodeci
I treat you right, and best believe I need you close to me
Up in my bed late night, that's where you supposed to be

Look
I just be focused on bringin' packs in
They like, "What's on his hip?"
They know he packin', huh, look
Run up, tell 'em, run up, boy, I wish they would, huh
Run up, tell 'em, run up, boy, I wish they would, huh
I was born a winner, I would never forfeit, huh
Push me to the limit, why would you wan' go there, huh
I done took her places, she was never brought here, look
Never go there, thought she'd never go there, huh
