		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All my dark dreams 
Drift like smoke in the breeze 
The fear grips me as I fall towards my sleep 
Here comes the nightmare that never ends 
Here is the dream that makes monsters of men 

Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh

In the house of my soul 
In rooms of ugliness and cold 
Memories locked away 
All the doubts and fears I never faced 

Now they come again 
I am falling down to meet with them 
Fears within us all 
Mine awake and they stand up tall 

Look for the truth 
Deepest cut of all from you 
Knife of the truth 
Blade of hatred slicing through 

Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh

I pray my sleep will break 
Maybe this time I won't wake 
Weakness I hide so well 
This dagger in my mind will tell 

It's my final stand 
I make a fist out of each hand 
To shadows of the past 
Take a breath and I scream attack

Look for the truth 
Deepest cut of all from you 
Knife of the truth 
Blade of hatred slicing through 

Here is the truth 
Deepest cut of all from you 
Knife of the truth 
Blade of hatred slicing through 

Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, yeah

Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh

Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh

Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
