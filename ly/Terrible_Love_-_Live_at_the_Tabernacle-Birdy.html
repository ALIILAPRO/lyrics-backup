		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' in
It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' in
its quiet company, its quiet company

And I can't fall asleep without a little help
It takes a while to settle down
My shivered bones
Until the panic sets

It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break

Company
Its quiet company
Its quiet company

But I won't
follow you into the rabbit hole
I said I would
but then I saw
your shivered bones
They didn't want me to

It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' in
It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' in

It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
