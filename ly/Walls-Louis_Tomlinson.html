		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nothing wakes you up like waking up alone
And all that's left of us is a cupboard full of clothes
The day you walked away and took the higher ground
Was the day that I became the man that I am now

But these high walls, they came up short
Now I stand taller than them all
These high walls never broke my soul, and I
I watched them all come falling down
I watched them all come falling down for you
For you

Nothing makes you hurt like hurtin' who you love (hurting who you love)
And no amount of words will ever be enough (never be enough)
I looked you in the eyes, saw that I was lost (saw that I was lost)
For every question "why", you were my "because" (you were my "because")

But these high walls, they came up short
Now I stand taller than them all
These high walls never broke my soul, and I
I watched them all come falling down
I watched them all come falling down for you
Falling down for you

So this one is a thank you for what you did to me
Why is it that 'thank you's' are so often bittersweet
I just hope I see you one day and you'll say to me, "Oh, oh"

But these high walls, they came up short
Now I stand taller than them all
These high walls never broke my soul, and I
I watched them all come falling down
I watched them all come falling down for you
Falling down for you

Nothing wakes you up like waking up alone
