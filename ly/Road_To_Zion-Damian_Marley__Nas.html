		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, man
Jah will be waiting there, we ah shout
Jah will be waiting there
In this world of calamity
Dirty looks and grudges and jealousy
And police weh abuse dem authority
Media clowns weh nuh know 'bout variety
Boom

The youngest veteran ah go murder dem slow
Ragga muffin sent to call me from the bush bungalow
Unnuh watch it, mek I clear out my voice now, Figaro
Emerge from the darkness with mi big blunt a glow
Mi hammer dem ah slam and spectator get low
Some bwoy coulda big like Bam Bam Bigelow
Bust off trigger finger, trigger hand and trigger toe
Ah two gun me have, me bust dem inna stereo
'Cause

I got to keep on walking on the road to Zion, man
Ay, we gots to keeps it burning on the road to Zion, man

Clean and pure meditation without a doubt
Don't mek dem take you like who dem took out
Jah will be waiting there we ah shout
Jah will be waiting there
In this world of calamity
Dirty looks and grudges and jealousy
And police weh abuse dem authority
Media clowns weh nuh know 'bout variety
Single parents weh need some charity
Youths weh need some love and prosperity
Instead of broken dreams and tragedy
By any plan and any means and strategy, say

I got to keep on walking on the road to Zion, man (yeah, yeah)
Been waiting to do this track with you man, yeah
Haha, yeah, yeah (you know), they know
You got to keep on walking on the road to Zion, man (yeah)
You gotta keep walking, y'all, yeah, yeah
You gotta keep

Sometimes I can't help but feel helpless
I'm havin daymares in daytime
Wide awake try to relate
This can't be happenin like I'm in a dream while I'm walkin'
'Cause what I'm seein is haunting
Human beings like ghost and zombies
President Mugabe holding guns to innocent bodies
In Zimbabwe
They make John Pope seem Godly
Sacrilegious and blasphemous
In my lifetime I look back at paths I've walked
Where savages fought and pastors taught
Prostitutes stomp in high heel boots
And badges screaming,"Young black children stop or I will shoot!"
I look back at cooked crack
Plus cars that pass by
Jaguars mad fly
And I'm guilty for materialism
Blacks is still up in the prison trust that
So save me your sorries, I'm raising an army
Revolutionary warfare with Damian Marley
We sparkin' the ions, marching to Zion
You know how Nas be, NYC state of mind I'm in

In this world of calamity
Dirty looks and grudges and jealousy
And police weh abuse dem authority
Media clowns weh nuh know 'bout variety
Boom

The youngest veteran ah go murder dem slow
Ragga muffin sent to call me from the bush bungalow
Unnuh watch it, mek I clear out my voice now, Figaro
Emerge from the darkness with mi big blunt a glow
Mi hammer dem ah slam and spectator get low
Some bwoy coulda big like Bam Bam Bigelow
Bust off trigger finger, trigger hand and trigger toe
Ah two gun me have, me bust dem inna stereo
'Cause

I got to keep on walking on the road to Zion, man
Ay, we gots to keeps it burning on the road to Zion, man

Clean and pure meditation without a doubt
Don't mek dem take you like who dem took out
Jah will be waiting there we ah shout
Jah will be waiting there

Clean and pure meditation without a doubt
Don't mek dem take you like who dem took out
Jah will be waiting there we ah shout
Jah will be waiting there

In this world of calamity

Ay, say

You got to keep on walking on the road to Zion, man
You know
You got to keep on walking on the road to Zion, man
