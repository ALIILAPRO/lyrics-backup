		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Guess I'm just afraid
I'm not the kind who makes it last forever
And in my selfish way I think I'm clever
Until you cry

Do you wanna leave?
You can let it go because you're strong
But one day without your love seemed so long
And I sigh, how I sigh

If this is love, darling
Now's the time to wake up
Hurting words can't really shake up someone's life

If this is love, darling
It's time to stop pretending
We'll never have a happy ending while we cry

Isn't it a shame
How one excuse still leads into another
After all this time we hurt each other?
Isn't it a shame?

Time to make a change
Time to find the things we both believe in
Talk about the staying, not the leaving

If this is love, darling
Now's the time to wake up
Hurting words can't really shake up someone's life

If this is love, darling
It's time to stop pretending
We'll never have a happy ending while we cry

If this is love, darling
Now's the time to wake up
Hurting words can't really shake up someone's life

If this is love, darling
It's time to stop pretending
We'll never have a happy ending while we cry
