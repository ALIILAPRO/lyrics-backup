		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Giving up my self control
'Cause tryna keep away is hopeless
Baby, will you let me know?
Let me know if it's showing
Giving up my self control
How I let myself get too wild
Hold me down or let me go
Don't forget me baby, don't be senile

She said that she wanna be my lover
Love me like I'm family or brother
That's my uh, I can't treat her like no other
Yeah that's my uh
She can't treat me like no other
This ain't no regular
This ain't no regular whip
She ain't no regular
She ain't no regular bitch
This ain't a regular Glock
That ain't no regular clip
Boy you a regular opp
I send a regular hit
Jail tests my patience
In ninth grade, I dropped out and started chasing
And my dog ain't been the same since they laced him
Yeah, my dog ain't been the same since they laced him
Say what you want, I used to play for fun
I started playing with guns
Run up on niggas and aim it up
Play with us, please don't play with us
Savage, bet I'll spray it up
Bad bitch wanna lay with us
I don't know what I'm capable of
Baby, I been doing so much
Why it never feel like enough?
You know I be in the cut
You should stay away, this ain't what you want
I ain't tryna be alone, but I do better on my own

Giving up my self control
'Cause tryna keep away is hopeless
Baby, will you let me know?
Let me know if it's showing
Giving up my self control
How I let myself get too wild
Hold me down or let me go
Don't forget me, baby, don't be senile

I came up from nada
Nike turned to Prada
Robber robbed the robbers
Shooter shoot the shottas
Bitch, I got a daughter, I'm a Poppa
I just hope I don't get locked up
In the spot with a choppa
Shit got real, you ain't pop up
I'm too sick, need a doctor
I be ballin', need a sponsor
She don't love me, she just want bucks
I don't really love her, I just wanna fuck
I can't sleep, gotta stay up
Can't lay up
We got demons on us
They be in the cut

Giving up my self control
'Cause tryna keep away is hopeless
Baby, will you let me know?
Let me know if it's showing
Giving up my self control
'Cause tryna keep away is hopeless
Baby, will you let me know?
Let me know if it's showing
