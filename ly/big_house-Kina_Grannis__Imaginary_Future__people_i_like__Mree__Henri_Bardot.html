		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Resting all the time
Big bed in the center
A living room designed to make dying feel better
Told me you would try to make it out this winter
The wolverines, the lions
The big house in November
Remember when you said
That if it got like this
You'd go below the freeway to score some heroin
Would it be tone deaf to cry
And make it all about me
When I can see you're hurting
You're saying words that don't make sense
I try to understand you by watching what your eyes do
Spacing out the lines
Folding up the letters
The check you left behind
Even though you never met her
Cheers at old Gillette
You called me on a landline
Stuck inside a tv on the heels of such a long fight
Would it be tone deaf to cry
And make it all about me
When I can see you're hurting
You're saying words that don't make sense
I try to understand you by watching what your eyes do
Said you could use a final trip
So she pushed you to the kitchen
And you stood up for a second
