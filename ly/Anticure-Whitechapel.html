		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Into a dream from which we'll never wake up
Undo the changes that left us jaded
Let's never open our eyes
 
I'm sorry I have to let you know
They don't look at us the same
Their skin is burned, their mind is somewhere else
What do you see that I don't see
This house is poisoned beyond repair
And the souls of our past life are trapped on the inside
I know you're unwell but I'm turning my back on you
 
With you it stays the same, you run away from everything
For once in your life, listen to what I say and we will fall
 
Into a dream from which we'll never wake up
Undo the changes that left us jaded
Let's never open our eyes
But our eyes are closed no matter what you've created
I refuse control from a delusional sadist
 
I refuse this relation
I'm above what you are, I'm a father's son
I'll cut our throat if you don't let me go
I refuse this relation
 
Undo these changes
That left us jaded
Into a dream, we'll never open our eyes
 
Into a dream from which we'll never wake up
Undo the changes that left us jaded
Let's never open our eyes
But our eyes are closed no matter what you've created
I refuse control from a delusional sadist
 
I refuse this relation
I refuse this relation
