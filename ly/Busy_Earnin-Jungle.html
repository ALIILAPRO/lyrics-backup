		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So you come a long way
But you'll never have me
Never have things for a normal life
It's time, too busy earnin'
You can't get enough

This busy earnin'
You can't get enough

You think that all your time is used
Too busy earnin'
You can't get enough

And I get always
But I bet it won't change, no
Damn, that's a boring life
It's quite, busy earnin'
You can't get enough

This busy earnin'
You can't get enough

You think that all your time is used
Too busy earnin'
You can't get enough

Just busy earnin'

You can't get enough

You think that all your time is used
Too busy earnin'
You can't get enough

You think that all your time is used
Too busy earnin'
You can't get enough

Just busy earnin'
You can't get enough, no
Just busy earnin'
You can't get enough
