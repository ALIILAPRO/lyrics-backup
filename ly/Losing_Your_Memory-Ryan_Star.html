		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're losing your memory now
You're losing your memory now
You're losing your memory now
You're losing your memory, now

Call all your friends
And tell them you're never coming back
Cause this is the end
Pretend that you want it
Don't react
The damage is done
The police are coming too slow now
I would have died
I would have loved you all my life

You're losing your memory now
You're losing your memory now
You're losing your memory now
You're losing your memory, now

Where have you gone,
The beach is so cold in winter here
And where have I gone,
I wake in Montauk with you near
Remember the day
Cause this is what dreams should always be
I just want to stay
I just want to keep this dream in me

You're losing your memory now
You're losing your memory now
You're losing your memory now
You're losing your memory

Wake up, it's time, little girl, wake up
All the best of what we've done is yet to come
Wake up, it's time, little girl, wake up
Just remember who I am in the morning

You're losing your memory now
You're losing your memory now
You're losing your memory now
You're losing your memory

You're losing your memory now
