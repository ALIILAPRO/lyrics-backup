		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where does my lover lie
I don't love, I just lie
So pray, pray for me

And where you run
I run in tow
And where you're from
I long to know

How does a child know
Where mother's weakness goes
And where, and where the trouble grows

Well you will speak
And it shall be so
And what you say
Will be all I know

There was a time of weeks
I thought dogs barked at me
And I, and I had lost my mind

And the devil had put
His mark on me
And calls his branches
Shake your trees

That's not me from a-trying
That's the devil and his lying
Trying to make me lose my mind
So pray, oh pray for me

So you got my letter late
From when I permanently etched my name
Right, right into your soul

I cannot love
I want to be alone
I will not love
I want to be alone

That's not me from a-trying
That's the devil and his lying
Trying to make me when I'm trying to be good
So pray, pray for me

But where he runs
I run in tow
And where you're from
I long to know

And you will speak
And it shall be so
I cannot love
I want to be alone

Pray, pray for me
