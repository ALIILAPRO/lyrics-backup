Bust it ba-by
Ayy, can I please talk to my bust it babies real quick homie?
Let me bring you in my world (Plies, Ne-Yo)
And let you know what I call my lil' bust it baby

She got me speedin' in the fast lane
Pedal to the floor Mayne
Tryna get back to her love (her love)
Best believe she got that good thang
She my little hood thang
Ask around, they know us
They'll know that's my baby (buss it)
Everybody know that my baby (buss it)
Everybody know that's my

If I wasn't married to the streets, it'd be you
Yo' lips, what make you so cute
Love when you poke yo' mouth out when you mad too
Save your number in my phone under lil' boo
Like your sex, but more in love of what you do
Turn me on how you stare at me when we through
When you give it to me, I don't wanna turn ya loose
Scared to moan 'round you, so all I can say is, "ooh"
My favorite panties of yours, the ones that see-thru
One wit the pink trim on 'em and they light blue
Speakin' for the goons, thank God for makin' you
Buss It Baby is what I call you

She got me speedin' in the fast lane
Pedal to the floor Mayne
Tryna get back to her love (her love)
Best believe she got that good thang
She my little hood thang
Ask around, they know us
They'll know that's my baby (buss it)
Everybody know that my baby (buss it)
Everybody know that's my

Yeah, yeah, yeah, so now
They say, "he's an entertainer (slow down)
You're just one more (he don't respect you)
He just gon' hurt you (and neglect you)"
Well let 'em say what they wanna (yeah)
I made a promise (yeah)
To do you right and I'm gonna (ayy)
Girl I'll do everything I can
To prove I'm a better man
Than your friends think I am (ayy, ohh)

She got me speedin' in the fast lane
Pedal to the floor Mayne
Tryna get back to her love (her love)
Best believe she got that good thang
She my little hood thang
Ask around, they know us
They'll know that's my baby (buss it)
Everybody know that my baby (buss it)
Everybody know that's my

I jus' gave her a nick name it's Wet-Wet
'Cause when we finished, she mess up all the bed sets
She got somethin' to relax me when I'm under stress
Never told her or let her know it but she the best
She like to spell her name wit her tongue on my chest
If you would told me it was this good, I'd never guessed
She full of surprises, I don't know what she'll do next
But while she sleep, I sneak and put hickies on her neck
And when she go out, she shut down the whole set
Love to see her in heels wit the slit in her dress
She like to do her own hair and get her own checks
My Bust It Baby, I keep her on deck

She got me speedin' in the fast lane
Pedal to the floor Mayne
Tryna get back to her love (her love)
Best believe she got that good thang
She my little hood thang
Ask around, they know us
They'll know that's my baby (buss it)
Everybody know that my baby (buss it)
Everybody know that's my
