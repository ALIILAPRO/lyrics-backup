		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't feel it when they talk on me, I won't take it
Get the fuck from 'round me, let's face it
You can't dive in this back in my basement
If you don't get what I'm saying, I'm not changing for you
Problems, I got too many of 'em
So I'm running through the days to catch up on 'em, I got plenty of 'em
No one hates me more than I do
So I'm the only one that decidin' when the end is coming

I push myself to the edge
Lookin' for the end, hopin' this time I won't break
I push myself to the edge
Feel it in my chest
None of y'all can stand in my way

I push myself to the edge
Lookin' for the end, hopin' this time I won't break
I push myself to the edge
Feel it in my chest
None of y'all can stand in my way
I push myself to the edge
Better come correct when you stand up in my face
I push myself to the edge
Lookin' for the end, hopin' this time I won't break

N-nah you, fuck that you aimin', we bust back
Won't do representin', we bombin' and trust that
On my mama, it's a problem whenever we come back
Y'all don't want that precision, with this it is unmatched, I
Notice how they look at me
I run myself right through the walls, I don't worry 'bout that at all
Understand I'm everything that you couldn't be
Because I put myself through hell, I'm guessin' that you can tell

I push myself to the edge
Lookin' for the end, hopin' this time I won't break
I push myself to the edge
Feel it in my chest
None of y'all can stand in my way

I push myself to the edge
Lookin' for the end, hopin' this time I won't break
I push myself to the edge
Feel it in my chest
None of y'all can stand in my way
I push myself to the edge
Better come correct when you stand up in my face
I push myself to the edge
Lookin' for the end, hopin' this time I won't break

Holding myself back
Hoping I don't crash

For the last time my hands on my brakes
None of this shit was planned as my fate
Run your mouth, get you into your grave
And none of y'all can stand in my way

I push myself to the edge
Lookin' for the end, hopin' this time I won't break
I push myself to the edge
Feel it in my chest
None of y'all can stand in my way
I push myself to the edge
Better come correct when you stand up in my face
I push myself to the edge
Lookin' for the end, hopin' this time I won't break

Hoping this time I won't break
