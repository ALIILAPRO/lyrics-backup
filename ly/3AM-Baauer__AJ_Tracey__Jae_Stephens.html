		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I vibes in the night time
When you come through it's looking like the right time
When its 3AM I just need a lifeline
Call your phone babygirl, I got the right mind
I ain't tryna wife b, I'm just tryna live life
I blow money when I get it so I live nice
She got the cake I'm just looking for a quick slice
And when the day breaks I won't even think twice 

I need a girl with a waist
I'm a starboy, I could never shine with a waste
No pasa no pasa
Girl don't worry about beef I got my guys in the place
Me and the moon good friends see
So I sleep in the day and come alive in the wakes
A peng ting with a vibe is what it takes
I ain't cuffin' no girls that's a line for the jakes

Girl let's have a couple light drinks
Nothing heavy, I'm incredible, general, trust mana levy
My money big bro here little like Debbie
I need a P1 black not a Chevy
And I'ma drink 'til the end of the day
My niggas in the block I'm tryna get dem all away
I don't care what you done
I don't care what you say
Mi nuh fear next man get the fuck out of my way

What a man, what a man, what a man you've got to be
Yeah you talk a lot of noise, I'll believe it when I see
There's a couple other boys but are you the one I need
You don't wanna waste my time, that's a guarantee

A viben, they whining
I'm stress free my dawgs violent
As a youngen I would duck from the trident
Feds tried to nick me a couple times but I'm silent
Colorful, Gucci
Tag her in my top and it's vibrant
Dope foreign and my car is a migrant
Water on my knickers if I'm playing in the hydrant
Brown skin looking all gold and maple
Wifed her in Feb got me March through April
I got my health and I'm grateful
Badman step far from me when am hateful
Slide through the darkness
Moon on my back
Big batty girl I'ma spoon up and that
Get my hair twist, sip lemonade causal
I'm a starboy you could never read it in a manual

What a man, what a man, what a man you've got to be
Yeah you talk a lot of noise, I'll believe it when I see
There's a couple other boys but are you the one I need
You don't wanna waste my time, that's a guarantee

I know what you need
I know what you want
You just got that something you can't find in everyone
I know what you could be
'Cause I know what you are
People talking 'bout you
They feel power from afar
They can see it in the dark

What a man, what a man, what a man you've got to be
Yeah you talk a lot of noise, I'll believe it when I see
There's a couple other boys but are you the one I need
You don't wanna waste my time, that's a guarantee
