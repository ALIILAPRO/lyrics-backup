		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, Lord knows I'm filthy rich
All this ice is like fifty bricks
Rap niggas throwing hissy fits
I give my bitch a stack just for a Christmas gift
And my bitch so bad, she on my Christmas list
'Member I prayed, really I wished for this
To get the crib with the maid and with the picket fence
I'm with some niggas that mad, we taking risks for this
I'm talking, Lord knows that I repent for this
But Lord knows if I get penned for this
I probably won't get home until I'm fifty- six
They say, I do not know why they be gassing these suckers
But fuck 'em 'cause I am not feeling their shit
Difference between me and most of these rappers
I'm talking about work that I really put in
Talking about pistols I put on my hip
And I'm talking about foreign I really could whip

Fighting strong, fighting strong
Fighting harder, fight stronger
Fighting strong, fighting strong
Fighting harder, fight stronger
