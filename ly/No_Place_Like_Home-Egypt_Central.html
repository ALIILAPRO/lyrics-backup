		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Deep lows
That come like twisted fate
The world around you changed
the black and grey have faded
Scared crows
The lions hiding fears
The voice of death appears
No guarantee we make it
No guarantee we make it

Damn sure isn’t Kansas anymore
And it feels like we won’t ever
Find the place we’re looking for
There’s danger in the skies
And I know you’re losing hope
But I promise you we’ll find the road back home.

Wake up
The wicked woods of red
Are only in your head 
A click of faith could save us
Don’t run
The curtain’s coming down
If we want our own way out
Brick by brick we make it
Brick by brick we make it
Brick by brick we make it

Damn sure isn’t Kansas anymore
And it feels like we won’t ever
Find the place we’re looking for
There is danger in the skies
And I know you’re losing hope
But I promise you we’ll find the road back home.

We’ll find the road back home
There’s danger in the skies
And I know you’re losing hope
But I promise you we’ll find the road.

Damn sure isn’t Kansas anymore
And it feels like we won’t ever
Find the place we’re looking for
There’s danger in the skies
And I know you’re losing hope
But I promise you we’ll find the road back home.
We’ll find the road back home.
