		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh
There was Heaven in your eyes
I was not baptized
Everything's alright when
She calls me back, she calls me back
Lost for a long time
Two parallel lines
Everything's alright when
She calls me back, she calls me back (yeah)

Look at me and don't you lie
I could be your sacrifice
But don't you hold your head up high
For bullshit, I do not have time
I can be an old tattoo
To remind me when I get bad news
And I do not exist to die
But live to die while saving you

Does it bite at your edges?
Do you lie awake restless?
Why am I so obsessive?
Hanging onto every sentence
This town's the same as you left it
Your page was blank but I read it
I still dial 822-993-167

Oh
There was Heaven in your eyes
I was not baptized
Everything's alright when
She calls me back, she calls me back
Lost for a long time
Two parallel lines
Everything's alright when
She calls me back, she calls me back

The radio is taunting me
Every song a minor key
And I don't get much sleep most nights
I'm seeing you in every dream
If only I could wake you up
If only I could fall asleep
I'll love you when the ocean's dry
I'll love you when the rivers freeze

Does it bite at your edges?
Do you lie awake restless?
Why am I so obsessive?
Hanging onto every sentence
This town's the same as you left it
Your page is blank but I read it
I still dial 822-993-167

Oh
There was Heaven in your eyes
I was not baptized
Everything's alright when
She calls me back, she calls me back
Lost for a long time
Two parallel lines
Everything's alright when
She calls me back, she calls me back
When she calls me back

All the pain I should have saved
Oh, I was too afraid of living life in your footsteps
In your heart or in your head
Oh, I was too afraid of living life in your footsteps
Living life in your footsteps
Living life in your footsteps

Still she calls me back
Still she calls me
