		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuck

I was an existential criminal, so innocently cynical
Ignorant as fuck but a proud individual
Originally meant to live a God-damned miracle
Might've been metaphysical, but I think it was medical
Testing my hypothesis
Never finding a theory

Emulating animals and mental aboriginals
A miserable fuck but a loud Tao mystical
An enemy of ritual traditionally integral
To Biblical originals, but literally pitiful
Too impatient for outpatient
Paging Dr. Leary

Did you lose yourself? 
It's always in the last place that you'd check
(How you could you forgive it if you don't forget it?)
I might find myself by retracing my steps

But I don't remember, well, I forgot myself
I don't remember, I don't remember 2012
I don't remember how I forgot myself
I don't remember, I don't remember 2012
I don't remember 2012, I don't remember
Wow, the whole year's a blur

I think I bought into the comedy and brought a lot of oddity
An odyssey I thought to be consider a commodity
And not until anomaly abolished my monotony
Did I applaud autonomy and modify a lot of me
I'll escape this reality
Be the next Houdini

Oh, glory be Satori but it's hallucinatory
And it's sure to be a story I can tell in purgatory
I said, once I've lost it can there be a Mahaprajnaparamita?

Did you lose yourself? 
Well, it's always in the last place you'd check
I might find myself by retracing my steps

Wow, I don't remember how I forgot myself
I don't remember, I don't remember 2012
I don't remember how I forgot myself
I don't remember, I don't remember 2012
I heard the world would turn to hell
Compared to that, I'm doing well

I don't remember how I forgot myself
I don't remember, I don't remember 2012
I don't remember how I forgot myself
I don't remember, I don't remember 2012
I don't remember 2012, I don't remember 2012
