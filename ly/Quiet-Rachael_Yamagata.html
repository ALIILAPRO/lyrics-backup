		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby says I can't come with him
And I had read all of this in his eyes
Long before he even said so 
Why go, I asked?
You know, and I know why
And it'll be just as quiet when I leave
As it was when I first got here 
I don't expect anything 
I don't expect anything

Take care I've been hurt before 
Too much time spent on closing doors 
You may hate me, but I'll remember to love you
Goodbye 
Don't cry
You know why
And it'll be just as quiet when I leave 
As it was when I first got here
I don't expect anything
I don't expect anything

All the waves of blame arrange as broken scenery
As they steal your best memories away
What if I was someone different in your only history?
Would you feel the same
As I walk out the door
Never to see your face again
Never to see your face again

And it'll be just as quiet when I leave 
As it was when I first got here
It'll be just as quiet when I leave 
As it was when I first got here
I don't expect anything
I don't expect anything
I don't expect anything
I don't expect anything
I don't expect anything
I don't expect anything to change when I leave
