		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't stand in line, I don't pay for clubs, fuck that, yeah
But I'll wait for you
I don't like to drink, I don't like to think, fuck that, oh-oh
But I ponder you, oh
I'm bending it over
You're my four-leaf clover
I'm so in love, so in love
There's no one above, up above
Forever's a long time, yes

My blue jeans
Will last me all my life
Oh, yes
So should we
I'm spending all, yeah, this time
Oh

Met you at the shop, sun was gettin' hot, I'm lonely (lonely), yeah (yeah)
I'm in the city on my own (city on my own)
Never would've thought you'd be the one, I got a homie (oh)
But that's the way it goes (that's the way it goes)
I'm reaching nirvana (I'm reaching nirvana)
Goodbye sweet Rwanda (goodbye sweet Rwanda)
High school was never for me (high school was never for me), yeah
I say let it be, let it be (oh)
Forever's a long time (a long time), yeah

My blue jeans
Will last me all my life
Oh, yes
So should we
I'm spending all this time

You don't even know me
You don't even know me, yes
I'm hanging from the tree
I'm hanging from the tree

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
