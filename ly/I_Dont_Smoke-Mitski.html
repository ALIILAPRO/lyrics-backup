		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't smoke 
Except for when I'm missing you 
To remember your mouth, how it 
Tasted true 
And I don't smoke 
Except for after I've held you, baby 
Being with you 
Makes the flame burn good 

So if you need to be mean 
Be mean to me 
I can take it and put it inside of me 
If your hands need to break 
More than trinkets in your room 
You can lean on my arm 
As you break my heart 

I'm what's left of when we 
Swam under the moon 
Now the rest of my days are just 
Waiting for when 
You come down and tell me 
I was meant for you, baby 
Being with you 
Makes the flame burn good 

If you need to be mean 
Be mean to me 
I can take it and put it inside of me 
If your hands need to break 
More than trinkets in your room 
You can lean on my arm 
As you break my heart 

Just don't leave me alone 
Wondering where you are 
I am stronger than you give me 
Credit for 

If your hands need to break 
More than trinkets in your room 
You can lean on my arm 
As you break my heart
