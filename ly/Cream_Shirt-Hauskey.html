		  (So fast, so fast, so fast)

It's hard to see the last day
I wish we had known
So much childish stuff I wish I'd outgrown
Found the cloud in the sky
While it was still bright
You turned to me and said something like

I think it might be like this forever
Sitting in the sun on the grass, yeah, yeah
And you're wearing nothing but
That cream shirt
And then it all was gone so fast

I shoulda taken the time to breathe it all in
Drank a little red wine, got out of my skin
Feared every low while we were still high
You turned to me and said something like

I think it might bе like this forever
Sitting in thе sun on the grass, yeah, yeah
And you're wearing nothing but
That cream shirt
You're wearing nothing but that cream shirt

(Forever, forever now)
(Forever, forever now)
(Forever, forever now)
You turned to me and said something like

I think it might be like this forever
I think it might be like this
(Forever, forever) I think it might
Be like this forever
Sitting in the sun on the grass, yeah, yeah
(Forever, forever) And you're
Wearing nothing but that cream shirt
And then it all was gone so fast

So fast, so fast, so fast
So fast, so fast, so fast

(Forever, forever, Forever, forever)
(Forever, forever, it might be like
This, be like this, be like this)
(Forever, forever)
