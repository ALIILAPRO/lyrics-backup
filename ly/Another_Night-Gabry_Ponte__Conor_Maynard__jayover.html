		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All or nothing
Give me all your love, I wanna feel it
Wanna feel it
When we're touching
Pulling you so close I feel you breathing
Feel you breathing

And I know when I look inside your mind
You don't want somebody for the night
So I hope that you read between the lines
'Cause I've been given all the signs

Won't you stay another night?
Won't you stay another night?
Won't you stay another night?

On to something
I know you feel every word I'm saying
That I'm saying (oh)
Feel it coming
Give your all of me, I hope you take it
Can you take it? (Oh)

And I know when I look inside your mind
You don't want somebody for the night
So I hope that you read between the lines
'Cause I've been given all the signs

Won't you stay another night?
Won't you stay another night?

Oh girl, I swear you got a hold on me
I feel it every time your body's close to me
I swear you got control of me
And I don't wanna waste your time

Won't you stay another night?
Won't you stay another night?
Won't you stay another night?
