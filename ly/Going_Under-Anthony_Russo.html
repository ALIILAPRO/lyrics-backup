		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Forgot what it's like to hold ya
With nothing on my brain
Just right here in the moment
The rest fades away
It's a miracle when you find some
Time inside of all of these days
It's so beautiful can try to
Make it last forever cause nothing lasts forever babe
Don't rush babe take it all in
It feels good when you gotta be nowhere
I'm going under if you wanna come with
Whatever's outside we won't let it in
Lean back let the moment sink in
It feels better when you think about nothing
I'm going under if you wanna come with
Whatever's outside we won't let it in
The world can wait on us
Let's take the long way up
With your skin on my skin
Under oatmeal linen yeah that dopamine's hitting
Like ou ou ou
Yeah
Take you to paradise
Until you come alive
Ou ou ou
Yeah
Under that morning light
Don't rush babe take it all in
It feels good when you gotta be nowhere
I'm going under if you wanna come with
Whatever's outside we won't let it in
Lean back let the moment sink in
It feels better when you think about nothing
I'm going under if you wanna come with
Whatever's outside we won't let it in
Laying right here
Saying nothing
Wouldn't mind if
If tomorrow never came
Laying right here
Saying nothing
Wouldn't mind if
If tomorrow never came
Don't rush babe take it all in
It feels good when you gotta be nowhere
I'm going under if you wanna come with
Whatever's outside we won't let it in
