		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought that dreams belonged to other men
'Cause each time I got close
They'd fall apart again
I feared my heart would beat in secrecy
I faced the nights alone
Oh, how could I have known
That all my life
I only needed you?

Oh
Almost paradise
We're knocking on heaven's door
Almost paradise
How could we ask for more?
I swear that I can see
Forever in your eyes
Paradise

It seems like perfect love's
So hard to find
I'd almost given up
You must've read my mind
And all these dreams
I saved for a rainy day
They're finally coming true
I'll share them all with you
'Cause now we hold the
Future in our hands

Oh
Almost paradise
We're knocking on heaven's door
Almost paradise
How could we ask for more?
I swear that I can see
Forever in your eyes
Paradise

And in your arms
Salvation's not so far away
It's getting closer
Closer every day

Almost paradise
We're knocking on heaven's door
Almost paradise
How could we ask for more?
I swear that I can see
Forever in your eyes
Paradise

Paradise
Paradise
