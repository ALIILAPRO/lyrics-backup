		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I lose control because of you babe
I lose control when you look at me like this
There's something in your eyes that is saying tonight
I'm not a child anymore, life has opened the door
To a new exciting life

I lose control when I'm close to you babe
I lose control don't look at me like this
There's something in your eyes, is this love at first sight
Like a flower that grows, life just wants you to know
All the secrets of life

It's all written down in your lifelines
It's written down inside your heart

You and I just have a dream
To find our love a place, where we can hide away
You and I were just made
To love each other now, forever and a day

I lose control because of you babe
I lose control don't look at me like this
There's something in your eyes that is saying tonight
I'm so curious for more just like never before
In my innocent life

It's all written down in your lifelines
It's written down inside your heart

You and I just have a dream
To find our love a place, where we can hide away
You and I were just made
To love each other now, forever and a day

Time stands still, when the days of innocence
Are falling for the night
I love you girl I always will
I swear I'm there for you
Till the day I die, yeah

You and I just have a dream
To find our love a place, where we can hide away
You and I were just made
To love each other now, forever and a day

You and I just have a dream
To find our love a place, where we can hide away
You and I were just made
To love each other now, forever and a day
