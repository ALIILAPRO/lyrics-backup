		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's groove tonight 
Share the spice of life
Baby slice it right 
We're gonna groove tonight
 
Let this groove get you to move
It's alright (alright) alright
Let this groove set in your shoes
So stand up (alright) alright
Gonna tell what you can do with my love
Alright
Let you know girl
You're looking good you're out of sight
Alright   
Just move yourself
And glide like a seven-forty-seven 
And lose you're self in the sky
Among the clouds in the heavens 
('Cause)
 
Let this groove light up your fuse
It's alright (alright) alright
Let this groove set in your shoes
So stand up (alright) alright
Let me tell you what you can do with my love
Alright
Gotta let you know girl
You're looking good you're out of sight
Alright 
Just tell the D.J. to play your favorite tune 
Then you know it's okay
What you found is happening now (Oh)
 
Let this groove get you to move
It's alright (alright) alright
Let this groove set in your shoes
So stand up (alright) alright
You will find a piece of mind 
On the floor take a little time 
Come and see you and me
Make a little sign
I'll be there after a while 
If you want my love we can boogie on down
Down boogie on down
Down boogie on down
Down boogie on down
On down
Boogie on
 
Let's groove tonight 
Share the spice of life
Baby slice it right 
We're gonna groove tonight
 
Let this groove light up your fuse
It's alright (alright) alright
Let this groove set in your shoes
So stand up (alright) alright
Let me tell you what you can do with my love
Alright
Gotta let you know girl
You're looking good you're out of sight
Alright 
Just tell the D.J. to play your favorite tune 
Then you know it's okay
What you found is happening now 
(Oh)
 
You will find a piece of mind 
On the floor take a little time 
Come and see you and me make a little sign
I'll be there after a while 
If you want my love we can boogie on down
Down boogie on down
Down boogie on down
Down boogie on down
On down Boogie on
