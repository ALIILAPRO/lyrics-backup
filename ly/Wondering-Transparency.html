		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been wondering what you look like
In the heavens dressed in pure white
Where the Father has a table where I can sit alone with you
I hear the angels singing loud
I wonder if I'll join the crowd cause I just wanna praise Your Holy Name
You deserve the fame
Holy is the Lord Almighty
Holy is the Son of God
Holy is the lamb who was slain
You're the King who called my name
And I sing my testimony
You're the God who came to show me the way
To show me the way
And you took my heart in Your hands like clay and I look upon to the King of Kings
I lay, I lay it down to You
Your Word is so true
I've been wondering what You sound like
When You call me up to the front line
When I hear You say well done my servant
You've endured till the end
Then He gives me the crown of life
You've been faithful through the days and nights
Enter in because you kept up the good fight
Now you're here by my side
Holy is the Lord Almighty
Holy is the Son of God
Holy is the lamb who was slain
You're the King who called my name
And I sing my testimony
You're the God who came to show me the way
To show me the way
And you took my heart in Your hands like clay and I look upon to the King of Kings
I lay, I lay it down to You
Your Word is so true
I can stay here all of my days
With the angels God we will praise
In Your hands is where I will stay
I don't wanna miss anything
And I sing my testimony
You're the God who came to show me the way
To show me the way
And I sing my testimony
You're the God who came to show me the way
To show me the way
And you took my heart in Your hands like clay and I look upon to the King of Kings
I lay, I lay it down to You
Your Word is so true
