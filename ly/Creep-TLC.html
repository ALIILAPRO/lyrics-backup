		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (Creep) oh ah, oh ah, oh ah yeah
(Creep) oh ah, oh ah, oh ah yeah

(Creep) oh ah, oh ah, oh ah yeah
(Creep) oh ah, oh ah, oh ah yeah

(Creep) the twenty second of loneliness
And we've been through so many things
(Creep) I love my man with all honesty
But I know he's cheating on me
(Creep) look him in the eyes
But all he tells me is lies to keep me near

I'll never leave him down though I might mess around
It's only 'cause I need some affection, oh
So I creep, yeah
Just creepin' on the down low 'cept nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah, 'cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show, oh

So I creep
The twenty third of loneliness
And we don't talk, like we used to do
Now this is pretty strange
But I'm not buggin' 'cause I still feel the same
Yeah, yeah
I keep giving loving 'til the day he pushes me away
Never go a stray

If he knew the things I did, he couldn't handle me
And I choose to keep him protected, oh
So I creep, yeah, just creepin' on the down low
'Cept nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah, 'cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show, oh

So I creep (I creep, yeah) yeah, 
Just creepin' on the down low
'Cept nobody is supposed to know (but you know, I'm gonna need some attention)
(Yeah, yeah) so I creep, yeah, 'cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show

So I creep, oh ah, oh ah, oh ah 
So I creep, oh ah, oh ah, oh ah, yeah
So I creep, oh ah, oh ah, oh ah
Baby, oh ah, oh ah, oh ah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

So I creep (I creep around), yeah
Just creepin' on the down low

So I creep (I creep around), yeah 
(Because I need attention) 'cause he doesn't know what I do
I don't mess around with my affection
So I creep (oh ah, oh ah, oh ah), yeah
Just creepin' on the down low, yeah (oh ah, oh ah, oh ah)
So I creep (oh ah, oh ah, oh ah), yeah
'Cause he doesn't know what I do (yeah, oh ah, oh ah, oh ah)
So I creep, yeah
Just creepin' on the down low
'Cept nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah
