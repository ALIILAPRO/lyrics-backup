		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Slam your brakes when I
Walk through the place
Scoot down the line if you wanna get inside
Move back, who's that? Open up two tabs
Drinks on me like a belly shot
Very hot, fan me
Better make way 'fore I pass out
Pretty girls frontin' on the floor
With they backs out work that
You gotta wham that
You gotta make a nigga wanna know
Where ya makin' plans at
Downtown livin' at the Trump
Everyday's good when you make an income
So I mix the drink I keep movin on my feet
Cuz I can go on and on and on
One shot, two shot, get on my team
He was a married man 'til he gave me a ring
Club doesn't peak 'til around about 3
So won't you lock it down
Feel the burn like

Likes when I talk to him rude
He likes when I've had a few
Shots cuz I give him attitude
B-B-Bitch better open my door
Tell him if he really want my
Ass then he gotta kiss more
The bar's up high so if
You not at least 6'5"
Then you might as well not even apply
I am feeling you though
If your nigga coolin' in the
Back with a rack
Make him give it up to me like kudos
Lame ass niggas don't do those
Rule number uno: keep that uh uh tight
You know he all yours if you
Movin' up on the floor
And he looks back twice
That man better get on my team
We ain't married yet he good up on his knees
I might not peak 'til around about 3
But once you bite down I'll
Make a sound like
