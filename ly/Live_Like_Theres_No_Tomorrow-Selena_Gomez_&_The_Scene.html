		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If time came to an end today
And we left too many things to say
If we could turn it back
What would we want to change
And now's the time to take a chance
Come on, we gotta make a stand
What have we got to lose
The choice is in our hands

And we can find a way
To do anything, if we try to

Live like there's no tomorrow
'Cause all we have is here, right now
Love like it's all that we know
The only chance that we ever found
Believe in what we feel inside
Believe and it will never die
Don't ever let this life pass us by
Live like there's no tomorrow

If there never was a night, a day
And memories could fade away
Then there'd be
Nothing left, but the dreams we made
Take a leap in faith and hope you fly
Feel what it's like to be alive
Give it all that we've got
And lay it all on the line

And we can find a way
To do anything, if we try to

Live like there's no tomorrow
'Cause all we have is here, right now
Love like it's all that we know
The only chance that we ever found
Believe in what we feel inside
Believe and it will never die
Don't ever let this life pass us by
Live like there's no tomorrow

Be here by my side
We'll do this together
Just you and me
Nothing is impossible
Nothing is impossible

Live like there's no tomorrow
'Cause all we have is here, right now
Love like it's all that we know
The only chance that we ever found
Believe in what we feel inside
Believe and it will never die
Don't ever let this life pass us by
Live like there's no tomorrow, oh

Live like there's no tomorrow
'Cause all we have is here, right now
Love like it's all the we know
The only chance that we ever found
Believe in what we feel inside
Believe and it will never die
