		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish we could cut all ties with the morning light
Because our secret's in the dark,
And though I don't take it to heart,
I just need more time
To appreciate what we'll leave behind
Like the feeling when you're holding me still with your eyes
It's as real as the stars that freckle the sky

But how long will we fall,
For how long will we fall,
Before we can climb?

And will this get too hard,
Will we even get far,
Will our words suffice?

I wanna know what it's like
Let's just erase all the downsides
If not forever then just for tonight
Give me all of you
Trust me, I know that we'll be fine

We'll be fine
We'll be fine

And all of the light we're missing
thanks to the sun's indifference
Oh limited time is hard to survive
With no sacrifice 

But conversation's flowing
Further than every ocean
Oh please tell me why
Please tell me why
This feels so right

But how long will we fall,
For how long will we fall,
Before we can climb?

And will this get too hard,
Will we even get far,
Will our words suffice?

I wanna know what its like
Let's just erase all the downsides
If not forever then just for tonight
Give me all of you
Trust me, I know that we'll be fine

Oh there's no need to clarify
I know I'll have your heart in time
It's just so hard when you're all I desire
I just want all of you
Trust me, I know that we'll be fine

We'll be fine
We'll be fine
We'll be fine

I wanna know what its like
Lets just erase all the downsides
If not forever then just for tonight
Give me all of you
Trust me, I know that we'll be fine

Oh there's no need to clarify
I know I'll have your heart in time
It's just so hard when you're all I desire
I just want all of you
Trust me, I know that we'll be fine, we'll be fine

I just want all of you trust me I know
That we'll be fine,
We'll be fine

I just want all of you trust me I know
That we'll be fine.
