		  Sail away
Sometimes I really wanna sail away
Leave all those things I did in yesterday
Is there a place I can stay?
Sometimes I really wanna sail away

Sail away
Sometimes I really wanna sail away
Leave all those things I did in yesterday
Is there a place I can stay?
Sometimes I really wanna sail away

I get inside my head so much it happens
And honestly I'm past it
I lost sight of the magic
I think it might be time to break some habits
Be a little less dramatic
The past was only practice

I'll tell you how I'm feeling right now
If you want me to let it go, just say so

Sail away
Sometimes I really wanna sail away
Leave all those things I did in yesterday
Is there a place I can stay?
Sometimes I really wanna sail away

Lately all my nights are feeling scripted
Smokin' things to keep me lifted
It's pain that I'm releasing
Please tell me a lie I can believe in
And offer me some healing
Won't you please give me a reason?

I'll tell you how I'm feeling right now
If you want me to let it go, just say so

Sail away
Sometimes I really wanna sail away
Leave all those things I did in yesterday
Is there a place I can stay?
Sometimes I really wanna sail away

I could use a holiday
Just a little getaway
I could really use an escape
I'm sick of feeling stuck inside
Been tryna find my paradise
I'm just tryna sail away

Sail away
Sometimes I really wanna sail away
Leave all those things I did in yesterday
Is there a place I can stay?
Sometimes I really wanna sail away
Sail away
Sometimes I really wanna sail away
Leave all those things I did in yesterday
Is there a place I can stay?
Sometimes I really wanna sail away
