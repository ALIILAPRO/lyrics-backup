		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remembering me, discover and see
All over the world, she's known as a girl
To those who are free, the mind shall be key
Forgotten as the past, 'cause history will last

God is a girl, wherever you are
Do you believe it, can you receive it?
God is a girl, whatever you say
Do you believe it, can you receive it?

God is a girl, however you live
Do you believe it, can you receive it?
God is a girl, she's only a girl
Do you believe it, can you receive it?

She wants to shine, forever in time
She is so driven, she's always mine
Clearly and free, she wants you to be
A part of the future, a girl like me

There is a sky, illuminating us
Someone is out there that we truly trust
There is a rainbow, for you and me
A beautiful sunrise, eternally

God is a girl, wherever you are
Do you believe it, can you receive it?
God is a girl, whatever you say
Do you believe it, can you receive it?

God is a girl, however you live
Do you believe it, can you receive it?
God is a girl, she's only a girl
Do you believe it, can you receive it?
