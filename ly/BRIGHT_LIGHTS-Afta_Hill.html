		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uhuh,
Yeah-yeah
Afta ay
Never afraid of the lights (Nah)
Never took shame in my height
5’9 dreamer in the draft like a caramel kite
Homeland memories clear, dream of them parable nights
Gramma would preach, like yeah I know be careful right
Rest In paradise, see I had a bullet to bite
All of those innocent kids caught in the enemy’s sight
Meant ever word, never been the regrettable type
ورود ممنوع, my timing’s impeccable right?
Pecking order changed with Tehranto
Born the head hancho,
Destiny choosing me was the heaviest pill to swallow
Seeing my peers perish from violence, ODs and sorrow
Overdose industry, ripping labels from pill bottles
Fuck an apostle, I’m him,
Dpeaking with god she a beautiful woman, and this a beautiful hymn
(Yeah, yeah)
Let the children sing
Got my money up inshallah double it
Homies say I’m more sought after than trouble is
Future Grammy winner, sounds good goddamn doesn’t it?
Driven and high what can I say I’m a gas guzzler
Cut the baseline, sneaking back door
Couple thousand clicks on my dashboard
Got reps like OGs calling glass for it
Bank shotta filling stamps in my passport
Yeah, uh
They say this a lost art
Two of every trophy hung up on my lost ark
Split through the screens, hater held with my off arm
The words biographical I’m Sartre when I jot poems
Rap game Paco De Lucia in top form
You see the long hair, you see the shot form
Nothing but net, I got em heated like hot forums
Album on the way, you should see what I got for em
