		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down

I've never been one for playing games
You can move your mouth forever
But the words sound just the same
Something like
Bang bang you're dead
Couldn't we just make love instead
Say yes 'cause it's what we do best
And I've had such a hard day

Take me where their eyes can't find us
Without you I may as well just

How much do I have to say
What more do you have to see
What will it take to make you love me
Oh well you're not the first
You're not the last
You're not even the one who loves me the best
But all I think about is you

Take me where their eyes can't find us
Without you I may as well just

Take me where their eyes can't find us
Without you I may as well just

Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down

Please don't wander from my door
I've never been one for playing games
You can move your mouth forever
But the words sound just the same
Ow
Bang bang you're dead
Couldn't we just make love instead
Say yes because it's what we do best
And I've had such a hard day

So don't bring me down
Won't you give me break
Somebody give me a break now!

Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down

Sweet little boy with oh such a big mouth
Harsh words can get you into hot water
When people don't understand you baby
I'm always here for you
And I
And I will never bring you down, down, down, down
Down my baby

Trust me
I want you to trust me
Oh, oh trust me
'Cause I won't bring you down
(Don't bring me down)
I won't bring you down
Do you trust me
Yeah
