		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know where you're going
But do you got room for one more troubled soul
I don't know where I'm going
But I don't think I'm coming home
And I said, I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead
This is the road to ruin and we're starting at the end

Say, yeah
Let's be alone together
We could stay young forever
Scream it from the top of your lungs, lungs, lungs

Say, yeah
Let's be alone together
We can stay young forever
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young

Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh

Cut me off, I lost my track
It's not my fault, I'm a maniac
It's not funny anymore, no it's not

My heart is like a stallion, they love it more when it's broken
Do you wanna feel beautiful, do you wanna, yeah

I'm outside the door, invite me in
So we can go back and play pretend
I'm on deck, yeah I'm up next
Tonight I'm high as a private jet

'Cause I don't know where you're going,
But do you got room for one more troubled soul
I don't know where I'm going, but I don't think I'm coming home
And I said, I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead
This is the road to ruin and we're starting at the end

Say, yeah
Let's be alone together
We could stay young forever
Scream it from the top of your lungs, lungs, lungs

Say, yeah
Let's be alone together
We can stay young forever
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young

Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh

My heart is like a stallion, they love it more when it's broken
Do you wanna feel beautiful, do you wanna, yeah

I'm outside the door, invite me in
So we can go back and play pretend
I'm on deck, yeah I'm up next
Tonight I'm high as a private jet

Yeah
Let's be alone together
We could stay young forever
Scream it from the top of your lungs, lungs, lungs

Say, yeah
Let's be alone together
We can stay young forever
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young

I don't know where you're going,
But do you got room for one more troubled soul
I don't know where I'm going, but I don't think I'm coming home
And I said, I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead
This is the road to ruin and we're starting at the end
