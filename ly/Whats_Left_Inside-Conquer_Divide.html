		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Face down,
I'm somewhere far away
And I'm lost now
'cause you just see me for all my mistakes

I was never good enough, no
You never had to say the words,
it was right on your face; you just pushed me away

And every time I heard that door swing
I remember wishing I was anywhere else
In spite of myself

Tell me was it worth this?
'cause god knows I'm not perfect

Are you happy now, are you happy now?
Can you look me in the eye and tell me everything is fine?
Are you happy now, are you happy now?
You just can't apologize, leave me broken inside

What's left inside
What's left inside
What's left inside
Cause I don't know what's left inside
What's left inside
I take a look at myself
And I don't know what's left

I'm counting the time,
cutting the tension with a knife
Too consumed by the lies,
to see that your life is passing you by

It was never good enough, no
you never had to say the words
It was right on your face; you just pushed me away
And how was I supposed to feel?
I was sixteen and wishing I was anyone else
but I can't change myself

Tell me was it worth this?
I know you'd care if I was perfect

Are you happy now, are you happy now?
Can you look me in the eye and tell me everything is fine?
Are you happy now, are you happy now?
You just can't apologize, leave me broken inside

What's left inside
What's left inside
What's left inside
'Cause I don't know what's left inside
What's left inside
I take a look at myself
And I don't know what's left

No, you can't live through me, oh
'cause this is who I am

And I will never be
what you want me to be, 

who you wanted to be!

Are you happy now, are you happy now?
Act like everything is fine but your whole life has been a lie
Are you happy now, are you happy now?
You just won't apologize cause you were always right

What's left inside
What's left inside
What's left inside
'Cause I don't know what's left inside
What's left inside
What's left inside

No, there's nothing left inside
No, there's nothing left inside
No, there's nothing left inside
There's nothing left inside
There's nothing left inside
