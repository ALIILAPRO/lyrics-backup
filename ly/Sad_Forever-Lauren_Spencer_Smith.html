		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know the sun is out
I got a couple songs people like to talk about
And I should be happy
I know people say
"It comes and goes", but, if I'm feeling it every day
It's more than a bad week

Will I be sad forever?
Will I be sad forever?
If my hopes and dreams all came together
Would I wake up one day feeling all better?
Will I be sad?
Will I be sad forever?

I know that through the screen
You only see some of the surface shit I let you see
Truth is, I'm breaking
I've tried everything, still got empty hands
If you think I'm faking it, I'm sorry in advance
Even when I laugh, I cry
I know it's fucking dark, but I wonder sometimes

Will I be sad forever?
Will I be sad forever?
If my hopes and dreams all came together
Would I wake up one day feeling all better?
Will I be sad?
Will I be sad forever?

And ever?
And ever?
And ever?
And ever?
And ever?
And ever?

Call it a phase
Call it whatever
I just wish someone would give me an answer
Will I be sad?
Will I be sad forever?
