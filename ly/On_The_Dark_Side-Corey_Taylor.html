		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dark side's coming now, nothing is real
She'll never know just how I feel
From out of the shadows, she walks like a dream
Make me feel crazy, make me feel so mean

Ain't nothin' gonna save you from a love that's blind
Slip through the dark side, cross that line

On the dark side, oh yeah
On the dark side, oh yeah
Hey

Dark side's coming now, nothing is real
She'll never know just how I feel
From out of the shadows, she walks like a dream
Make me feel crazy, make me feel so mean

Ain't nothin' gonna save you from a love that's blind
Slip through the dark side, cross that line

On the dark side, oh yeah
On the dark side, oh yeah

Ain't nothin' gonna save you from a love that's blind
Slip through the dark side, cross that line

On the dark side, oh yeah
On the dark side, oh yeah
Hey

R-O-C-K in the USA
R-O-C-K in the USA (what I like about you)
R-O-C-K in the USA (you hold me tight)
R-O-C-K in the USA (never wanna let you go)
R-O-C-K in the USA (wanna come over tonight, yeah)
R-O-C-K in the USA

She got the way to move me, Cherry
She got the way to move me, Cherry
She got the way to move me, Cherry
She got the way to move me

On the dark side, oh yeah
On the dark side, oh yeah
On the dark side, oh yeah
On the dark side, oh yeah
On the dark side, oh yeah
On the dark side, oh yeah
