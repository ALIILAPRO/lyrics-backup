		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Words don't come easy to me
How can I find a way to make you see I love you
Words don't come easy
Words don't come easy to me
This is the only way for me to say I love you
Words don't come easy

Well, I'm just a music man
Melodies are so far my best friend
But my words are coming out wrong
Girl, I reveal my heart to you and
Hope that you believe it's true 'cause

Words don't come easy to me
How can I find a way to make you see I love you
Words don't come easy

This is just a simple song
That I've made for you on my own
There's no hidden meaning you know when I
When I say I love you honey
Please believe I really do 'cause

Words don't come easy to me
How can I find a way to make you see I love you
Words don't come easy
It isn't easy, words don't come easy

Words don't come easy to me
How can I find a way to make you see I love you
Words don't come easy
Don't come easy to me
This is the only way for me to say I love you
Words don't come easy

Words don't come easy
