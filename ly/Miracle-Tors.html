		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh, so bittersweet,
Yeah, well, she comforts me,
I, I, I'm right between,
Holy and the edge of the water,

Sleeping on the backseat,
People walking past me,
I was never someone who could turn out the lights,
I wonder why,

Oh, oh, oh in my dreams,
Yeah well she comforts me,


They say it's a work of art,
Every time I fall apart,
But it can get so lonely, 
So I'll open every scar,
Stories written in the dark,
Hoping you feel the same,


Oh I've been waiting for a miracle,
Maybe I'm, Maybe I'm too late,
I got so scared I might have missed it all, 
Lately I'm starting to lose faith,
Every second I wait,
Every minute I try,
Every hour I waste a day goes by,
Oh I've been waiting for a miracle,
Maybe I'll make it there someday, 


Oh, oh, I'll leave tonight,
Drive through the warning signs,
Cold wind to keep my eyes,
Open till I get where I'm going,

I'm not gonna slow down,
Till I see I my hometown,
Reflected in the mirror like a light in the sky,
I know this time,

Oh, oh, I wont think twice,
Drive through the warning signs,

They say it's a work of art,
Every time I fall apart,
But it can get so lonely,
So I'll open every scar,
Stories written in the dark (writing stories in the dark),
Hoping you feel the same,


Oh I've been waiting for a miracle,
Maybe I'm, Maybe I'm too late,
I got so scared I might have missed it all, 
Lately I'm starting to lose faith,
Every second I wait,
Every minute I try,
Every hour I waste a day goes by,
Oh I've been waiting for a miracle,
Maybe I'll make it there someday, 

Morning light,
Now I understand that,
Nothing ever happens,
Overnight,
That's alright, 


Oh I've been waiting for a miracle,
Maybe I'm,Maybe I'm too late,
I got so scared I might have missed it all, 
Lately I'm starting to lose faith,
Every second I wait,
Every minute I try,
Every hour I waste a day goes by,
Oh I've been waiting for a miracle,
Maybe I'll make it there someday
