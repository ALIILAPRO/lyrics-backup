		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see you

You're not dead, just dead to me
Loyalty is a chain that's binding
It's sad, sad but true
Like a match to the fuel destroying everything around you

Twist the blade
Leavin' a wound that never heals inside me
Twist the blade
Let it die, vengeance is hereby mine

Don't you feel better when, better when
You see right through me? Yeah
So don't pretend, don't pretend
You ever knew me
Who I really am, really am
Guess you're just another bad friend
Just a bad friend, fuck it

Watched you fall, fall from grace
Face to face with the shadow of your mistakes
So you cut, cut and run
Look what you've done, belief is the death of reason

Twist the blade
Leavin' a wound that never heals inside me
Twist the blade
Let it die, vengeance is hereby mine

Don't you feel better when, better when
You see right through me? Yeah
So don't pretend, don't pretend
You ever knew me
Who I really am, really am
Guess you're just another bad friend
Just a bad friend
A bad friend (bad friend)
A bad friend (bad friend)
A bad friend (bad friend)

Drop the dead weight
I'm moving past this
When I'm gone who's gonna carry your casket?
Who?
Who's gonna carry your casket?
Who?
No one will carry your casket
