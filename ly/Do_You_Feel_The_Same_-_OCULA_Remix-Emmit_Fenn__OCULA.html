		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw a humming bird and it said hi
It danced in circles round the window light
And I thought of you, I thought of you
I felt the rain fall on my face
Running rivers down the interstate
And I thought of you, I thought of you
I thought of you
I thought of you
I heard the flowers bloom in Paris now
And all the butterflies dance for the crowds
And I thought of you, I thought of you
And there's a couple dancing in the park
For a moment they forget where they are
And I thought of you, I thought of you
I thought of you
Sunset skies on an endless day
When you hold me tight it all feels the same
Feels the same, feels the same
The world stops spinning every time you stay
Now I can't stop thinking, do you feel the same?
Feel the same, feel the same
Sunset skies on an endless day
When you hold me tight it all feels the same
Feels the same, feels the same
The world stops spinning every time you stay
Now I can't stop thinking, do you feel the same?
Feel the same, feel the same
