		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I don't know what you're gonna do
Don't know about me
One, two, three, let's go

Tell me what you want me to
So get around me

So run for the gold, run for the money, run for the infinity
We'll never return and be free
But every time that I come around there's too many little things they know about us
No, I can't play

And I don't wanna be your friend
Baby, but there's no other way
I'm the one so baby, don't prentend
And I don't wanna make it bad but there's no other way
I don't want you to make me mad

Got my boys in the water
Got my girls bending over, tight
Got my boys in the water, got my boys in the water

Got my boys in the water
Got my girls bending over, tight
Got my boys in the water, got my boys in the water

Then we fall in the replay
For the night calling
Where princes rule the world
The party ain't jumping
But we should get lost before you

So run for the gold, run for the money, run for the infinity
We'll never return and be free
But every time that I come around, there's too many little things they know about us
No, I can't play

And I don't wanna be your friend
Baby, but there's no other way
I'm the one so baby, don't prentend
And I don't wanna make it bad but there's no other way
I don't want you to make me mad

Got my boys in the water
Got my girls bending over, tight
Got my boys in the water, got my boys in the water

Got my boys in the water
Got my girls bending over, tight
Got my boys in the water, got my boys in the water

And I don't wanna be your friend
Baby, but there's no other way
I'm the one so baby, don't prentend
And I don't wanna make it bad but there's no other way
I don't want you to make me mad

Got my boys in the water
Got my girls bending over, tight
Got my boys in the water, got my boys in the water

Got my boys in the water
Got my girls bending over, tight
Got my boys in the water, got my boys in the water
