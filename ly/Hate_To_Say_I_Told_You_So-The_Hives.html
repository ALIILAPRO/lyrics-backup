		<p>
		  Do what I want 'cause I can and if I don't
Because I want to 
Be ignored by the stiff and the bored because I'm gonna
Spit and retrieve 'cause I give and receive
Because I want to 
Gonna get through your head 
What the mystery man said because I'm gonna

Hate to say I told you so, alright
Come on
I do believe I told you so

Now it's all out and you knew 
'Cause I wanted to
Turn my back on the rot 
That's been planning the plot because I'm gonna
No need for me to wait because I wanna
No need two, three, too late because I'm gonna

Hate to say I told you so, alright
Come on
I do believe I told you so

Do what I please gonna spread the disease
Because I want to 
Gonna call all the shots 
For the no's and the not's because I wanna
Yeah

Ask me once I'll answer twice 
'Cause all I know I'll tell because I wanna
Sound device and lots of ice I'll spell my name out loud
Because I want to
Oh yeah
