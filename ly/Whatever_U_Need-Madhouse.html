		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Speak my heart when I hear your name
Speak enough time with the heat
Late leaves, fall down as I feel the rain
Feelings didn't change like the seasons peaks
NeXt morning I feel everything
I'm upside down with no handles
Pieced together by the changing ways
Ain't the same city that I once knew
There's that feeling inside again
Craving your imperfections 
Like sculptures made from finer things
You're not a bridge to burn

I'll say it first
Don't want hurt

I got whatever you need
Whatever you need, whatever you need
I got whatever you need
Whatever you need, whatever you need

Speak my heart when you do your thing
Hard to think straight when I'm around you
Freeze, inject you into my veins
Chasing the addiction that I have for you
These days I'm all over the place
If I want you I gotta have you
Get it dripping from your lips, get a grip 

There's that feeling inside again
Craving your imperfections
These shades of you couldn't let me in
Nobody's gotta hurt

I'll say it first
Don't want hurt

I got whatever you need
Whatever you need, whatever you need
I got whatever you need
Whatever you need, whatever you need
I got whatever you need
Whatever you need, whatever you need
I got whatever you need
Whatever you need, whatever you need
I got whatever you need
Whatever you need, whatever you need
I got whatever you need
Whatever you need, whatever you need
