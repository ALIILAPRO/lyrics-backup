		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She pulled me in so easily
Right from the start
She played me like I was a melody
One bang on the drum and she funks me with a sweet kiss

She's touching me with lovers caress
No I can't fight it
She's got my soul
She's captured me

Holds me hostage when I hear that beat
I won't take these shackles off my feet
'Cause they're the only thing that make me feel free
That's why

I'm a slave to the music
No I won't stop 'til my heart pops out
I'm a slave to the music
No I won't give in 'til I stop breathing

She got me rockin'
She got me movin'
She got me dancin'
She got me rockin'

She got me movin'
She got me dancin'
I don't wanna be saved
Slave to the music

I don't wanna be saved
I'm a slave to the music, yeah yeah
It's 4 'o clock,
And I'm barely alive

But keep on givin'
It's the only way to survive
But I can't help but shuffle my feet
Moving like a zombie, chasin' the beat

She lures me in oh sweet surrender
Locks me down like a repeat offender
I won't take these shackles off my feet
'Cause they're the only thing that make me feel free

That's why
I'm a slave to the music
No I won't stop 'til my heart pops
I'm a slave to the music

No I won't give in 'til I stop breathing
She got me rockin'
She got me movin'
She got me dancin'

She got me rockin'
She got me movin'
She got me dancin'
I don't wanna be saved

I'm a slave to the music
I don't wanna be saved, no no
I'm a slave to the music
If you feel for me put your hands out now

If you feel for me put your hands out now
? your hands out
If you feel like a zombie, shout it out now
If you feel like a zombie, shout it out now

She got me rockin'
She got me movin'
She got me dancin'
She got me rockin'

She got me movin'
She got me dancin'
She got me rockin'
She got me movin'

She got me dancin'
She got me rockin'
She got me movin'
She got me dancin'

I don't wanna be saved
I'm a, I'm a slave to the music
I'm a slave to the music, yeah
I'm a, I'm a slave to the music

I'm a slave to the music, yeah yeah
Don't want to be saved now
