		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Break from this 
Three days since I've gone 
Fallen out of place 
Lay down by the lake house I grew on 
Time takes on her age 
Step back, rebuild 
All the damage has been done 
I could find my strength 
Let them refill all their thoughts of heavy lungs 

And though it seems I've lost my time 
Drifting through the pines 
Finding my way home 

Take from this 
Three years since I've flown 
Calling out my fate 
Lay down by the lake house I grew up 
Running out the same 
Take up a hobby anything to keep yourself warm
I could find my strength 
Step back rebuild all the damage has been done 

So it seems I've lost my time 
Drifting through the old headed pines 
Looking for a place to go 
Finding my way, 
Home.
