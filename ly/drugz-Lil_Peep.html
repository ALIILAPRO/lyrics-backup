		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I do them drugs, I don't give a fuck what you think
I got blood, I got mud, I got bud, I got drank
Only do it for the pain, it be fuckin' up my brain
I don't really give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, mane, ayy (ayy)

Yeah, I do them drugs, I don't give a fuck what you think
I got blood, I got mud, I got bud, I got drank
Only do it for the pain, it be fuckin' up my brain
I don't really give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, mane, ayy

I fly by in a hoop, don't shoot, my group don't do that goop like I do
I tell 'em that's cool, I got no rules, they makin' moves like I do
I don't need food, but I take blues and I make news like five do
Get in my room, lil' bitch, I'm rude but they can't do what I do

Yeah, I do them drugs, I don't give a fuck what you think
I got blood, I got mud, I got bud, I got drank
Only do it for the pain, it be fuckin' up my brain
I don't really give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, mane, ayy
