		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say you don't want me
You call me good for nothing
Straight to my face
You say you don't need me
You call me good for nothing
A waste of space

Don't remind me
I'm minding my own damn business
Don't try to find me
I'm better left alone than in this
It doesn't surprise me
Do you really think that I could care
If you really don't like me?
Find somebody else
It could be anyone else out there

Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna miss you again
One thing
When you're angry, you're a jerk
And then you treat me like I'm worth nothing
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna miss you again
It'll happen again
I'll watch it happen over and over again

You say you don't want me
You call me good for nothing
Straight to my face
You say you don't need me
You call me good for nothing
A waste of space

I watch the walls caving in on me
I'm sick of feeling so fucking lonely
By now I've given up all hope
I guess I'm better off alone

Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna miss you again
One thing
When you're angry, you're a jerk
And then you treat me like I'm worth nothing
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna miss you again
It'll happen again
I'll watch it happen over and over again
