		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll pretend that I want you for what is on the inside
But when I get inside I'll just want to get out
I'm your first and last deposit through sickness and in hell
I'll never you promise you a garden, you'll just water me down

I can't believe that you are for real
I don't care as long as you're mine

When I said "we" you know I meant "me"
And when I said "sweet" I meant "dirty"
When I said "we" you know I meant "me"
And when I said "sweet" I meant "dirty"

I'm unsafe
I'm unsafe
I won't repent
So I memorize the words to the porno movies
It's the only thing I want to believe
I memorize the words to the porno movies
This is a new religion to me

I'm a VCR funeral, a dead memory waste
My smile's a chainlink fence that I have put up
I love the enemy, my love is the enemy
They say they don't want fame
But they get famous when we fuck

When I said "we" you know I meant "me"
And when I said "sweet" I meant "dirty"
When I said "we" you know I meant "me"
And when I said "sweet" I meant "dirty"

I'm unsafe
I'm unsafe
I won't repent
So I memorize the words to the porno movies
It's the only thing I want to believe
I memorize the words to the porno movies
This is a new religion to me

I never believed the devil was real
But God couldn't make someone filthy as you

When I said "we" you know I meant "me"
And when I said "sweet" I meant "dirty"
When I said "we" you know I meant "me"
And when I said "sweet" I meant "dirty"
When I said "we" you know I meant "me"
And when I said "sweet" I meant "dirty"
When I said "we" you know I meant "me"
And when I said "sweet" I meant "dirty"

You are the church, and I am the steeple
When we fuck, we are all God's people
You are the church, and I am the steeple
When we fuck, we are all God's people
