		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, what is your name?
What are you doing?
Send it home that is a Saturday night
Hey, what do you think that you are falling?
Look around you, everybody don't lay

Oh, we go do this alright
Everyday, all day, all night
Oh, welcome to this part of life
Every boy, every girl, all night

We like to party, dance with somebody like you
We like to, we like to, we like to
We like to party, get super naughty with you
We like to, we like to, we like to

We like to dance, we like to party
We like to drink and kiss somebody
We like to dance, we like to party
We like to drink and kiss somebody

Say, I'll make the move, why don't you follow?
Come on, lover, let me see what you got
Yeah, we go tonight until tomorrow
Someone come and theyâ€™ll be ready or not

Oh, we go do this alright
Everyday, all day, all night
Oh, welcome to this part of life
Every boy, every girl, all night

We like to party, dance with somebody like you
We like to, we like to, we like to
We like to party, get super naughty with you
We like to, we like to, we like to

We like to dance, we like to party
We like to drink and kiss somebody
We like to dance, we like to party
We like to drink and kiss somebody

I'll be there when you're looking up for me
I'll be there in the spotlight
I'll be there when you're looking up for me
But I wanna be there all night

I'll be there when you're looking up for me
I'll be there in the spotlight
I'll be there when you're looking up for me
But I wanna be there all night

We like to party, dance with somebody like you
We like to, we like to, we like to
We like to party, get super naughty with you
We like to, we like to, we like to

We like to dance, we like to party
We like to drink and kiss somebody
We like to dance, we like to party
We like to drink and kiss somebody

We like to party, dance with somebody like you
We like to, we like to, we like to
We like to party, get super naughty with you
We like to, we like to, we like to

We like to dance, we like to party
We like to drink and kiss somebody
We like to dance, we like to party
We like to drink and kiss somebody
