		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We were talking on the phone
About the years that have gone
Everyone's got heartache to share
We're going crazy in here

I'm so happy that you're with me
It just feels good to be free
There's no egos
It's just you and it's just me

There's some people that are crazy
They've got demons in their heads
There's some people that are crazy
They're my friends

Stay with me till the end
With me till the end
Stay with me till the end
With me till the end

I was talking to be alone
Abused, addicted and stoned
Everyone's got heartache to share
We're going crazy in here

I'm so happy that you're with me
It just feels good to be free
There's no egos
It's just you and it's just me

There's some people that are crazy
They've got demons in their heads
There's some people that are crazy
They're my friends

Stay with me till the end
With me till the end
Stay with me till the end
With me till the end

I'm so happy that you're with me
It just feels good to be free
There's no egos
It's just you and it's just me

There's some people that are crazy
They've got demons in their heads
There's some people that are crazy
They're my friends

I'm so happy that you're with me
It just feels good to be free
There's no egos
It's just you and it's just me

That you made me what you made me
And I'm stronger in the end
That you made me what you made me
You're my friend

Stay with me till the end
With me till the end
Stay with me till the end
With me till the end
