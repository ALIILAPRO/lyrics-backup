		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What you, what you gon' do?

Strung out on a feeling, my hands are tied
Your face on my ceiling, I fantasize
Oh, I can't control it, I can't control it
(I can't control it)
I try to replace it with city lights
I'll never escape it, I need the high
Oh, I can't control it, I can't control it
(Oh)

You keep makin' it harder to stay
But I still can't run away
I gotta know, why can't you, why can't you?
I wanna know, why can't you, why can't you?
I wanna know, why can't you, why can't you?
I gotta know, why can't you, why can't you just let me go?

Let me go
Let me
Let me go

Prisoner, prisoner
Locked up, can't get you off my mind, off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times, million times
Oh-whoa, why can't you
Why can't you just let me go?
Get down, get
Let me go
Let me
Get down, get
I wanna know, why can't you, why can't you?
Get down
Let me, let me
Prisoner, prisoner
Locked up, can't get you off my mind, off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times, million times
Oh-whoa, why can't you
Why can't you just let me go?

Can't get you off my mind
Why can't you just let me go?
Million times
Why can't you
Why can't you just let me go?

I tasted heaven, now I can't live without it
I can't forget you and your love is the loudest
Oh, I can't control it, I can't control it
(Can't control it)

You keep making it harder to stay
But I still can't run away
I gotta know, why can't you, why can't you?
I wanna know, why can't you, why can't you?
I wanna know, why can't you, why can't you?
I gotta know, why can't you, why can't you just let me go?

Let me go
Why, why, why

Prisoner, prisoner
Locked up, can't get you
Get down, get
Why, why, why
Prisoner, prisoner
Locked up, can't get you off my mind, off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times, million times
Oh-whoa, why can't you
Why can't you just let me go?

Get
Let me, let me
Let me go
Let me go
