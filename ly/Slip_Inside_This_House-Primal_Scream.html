		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Enter, enter, enter, enter)
(Enter, enter, enter, enter)

Finer worlds that you uncover
Plant the path you want to roam
Live where your heart can be given
And your life starts to unfold

You think you can't you wish you could
I know you can, I wish you would
So trip inside this house as you pass by
Trip inside this house as you pass by

If your limbs begin dissolving
In the water that you tread
All surroundings are evolving
In the stream that clears your head

Come disciples to thee unending
Subtle strong ties of rhythm power
Trip inside this house as you pass by
Trip inside this house as you pass by

(Enter, enter, enter, enter)
(Trip, trip, trip inside)
(Trip, trip, trip inside)
(Enter, enter, enter, enter)
(Enter, enter, enter, enter)

Sweep the shadows from your eyes
Sweep the realm of dark aside

Trip inside this house as you pass by
Trip inside this house as you pass by
Trip inside this house as you pass by
Trip inside this house as you pass by

Trip, trip, trip inside
Trip, trip, trip inside
Trip, trip, trip inside
Trip, trip, trip inside
