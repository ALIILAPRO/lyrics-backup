		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon and under the sun
Whether near to me, or far
It's no matter darling, where you are
I think of you night and day

Day and night
Why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go?
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you night and day

Night and day
Under the hide of me
There is oh such a hungry yearning, burning inside of me
And this torment won't be through
Till you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day

Night and day
Under the hide of me
There's oh such a hungry yearning, burning inside of me
And this torment won't be through
Till you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day
