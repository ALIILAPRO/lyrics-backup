		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been drivin' for an hour
Just talkin' to the rain
You say I've been drivin' you crazy
And it's keepin' you away
So just give me one good reason
Tell me why I should stay
'Cause I don't want to waste another moment
In sayin' things we never meant to say

And I take it just a little bit
I, hold my breath and count to ten
I, I've been waitin' for a chance to let you in

If I just breathe
Let it fill the space between
I'll know everything is alright
Breathe
Every little piece of me
You'll see
Everything is alright
If I just breathe

Well it's all so overrated
In not sayin' how you feel
So you end up watchin' chances fade
And wonderin' what's real

And I give you just a little time
I, wonder if you realize
I've been waitin' 'til I see it in your eyes

If I just breathe
Let it fill the space between
I'll know everything is alright
Breathe
Every little piece of me
You'll see
Everything is alright
If I just breathe
Breathe

So I whisper in the dark
Hopin' you'll hear me
Do you hear me?

If I just breathe
Let it fill the space between
I'll know everything is alright
Breathe
Every little piece of me
You'll see
Everything is alright, yeah yeah

Everything is alright
If I just breathe, breathe
I've been drivin' for an hour
Just talkin' to the rain
