		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Early in the morning and I can't do right
Had a little fight with my baby last night and it's early in the morning
Don'chu know it's early in the morning
Early in the morning
I ain't got nothing, no nothing but the blues

I went to your girlfriend's house
But she was out
I knocked on your daddy's door
But he began to shout and he said
It's early in the morning
Don'chu know it's early in the morning
Early in the morning
I ain't got nothing, no nothing but the blues

I went to Dooky Chase to get somethin' to eat
Waitress looked at me said, "Harry, you sure look beat"
And I said, It's early in the morning
Don'chu know it's early in the morning

Early in the morning
Early in the morning
Early in the morning
Early in the morning
Early in the morning
Early in the morning
Early in the morning
Early in the morning

Ain't got nothing, but the
Ain't got nothing, but the
Ain't got nothing, but the
Ain't got nothing, but the
Ain't got nothing, but the
Ain't got nothing, but the
Blues
