		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been wonderin'
Am I the only one
To see it comin'?
We've been doin' it wrong
For so long

Ain't it funny
How we keep complainin'
But do nothin'?
Well, we know that we'll make it
Go away

We're watchin' the clouds changin' shapes
Wait for the storm and taste the rain
But if we're standin' still, now, it'll be too late

If you're prayin' for a change
You better not wait
Keep turnin' the pages
There's choices you make
Only once in your life
Once in your life

If you're prayin' for a change
You better not wait
Keep turnin' the pages
There's choices you make
Only once in your life
Only once in your life

Are we takin'
More than we can give?
Celebratin'
Like there's no risk
It's a risk

We're watchin' the clouds changin' shapes
Wait for the storm and taste the rain
But if we're standin' still, now, it'll be too late

If you're prayin' for a change
You better not wait
Keep turnin' the pages
There's choices you make
Only once in your life
Once in your life

If you're prayin' for a change
You better not wait
Keep turnin' the pages
There's choices you make
Only once in your life
Only once in your life

When we fade, the sky's turnin' gray
Would you leave us behind
Or take a leap of faith?
I still see your color just the same
Do you see us shine?

If you're prayin' for a change
You better not wait
Keep turnin' the pages
There's choices you make
Only once in your life
Once in your life

So if you're prayin' for a change
You better not wait
Keep turnin' the pages
There's choices you make
Only once in your life
Once in your life

If you're prayin' for a change
You better not wait
Keep turnin' the pages
There's choices you make
Only once in your life
Only once in your life

I've been wonderin'
Am I the only one
To see it comin'?
We've been doin' it wrong
For so long
