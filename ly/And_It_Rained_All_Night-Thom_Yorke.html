		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And it rained all night and washed the filth away
Down New York air conditioned drains
The click click clack of the heavy black trains
A million engines in neutral

The tick tock tick of a ticking time bomb
Fifty feet of concrete underground
One little leak becomes a lake
Says the tiny voice in my earpiece
So I give in to the rhythm
The click click clack
I'm too wasted to fight back
Tick tack goes the pendulum on the old grandfather clock

I can see you
But I can never reach you

And it rained all night and then all day
The drops were the size of your hands and face
The worms come out to see what's up
We pull the cars up from the river

It's relentless
Invisible
Indefatigable
Indisputable
Undeniable

So how come it looks so beautiful?
How come the moon falls from the sky?

I can see you
But I can never reach you

I can see you
But I can never reach you
