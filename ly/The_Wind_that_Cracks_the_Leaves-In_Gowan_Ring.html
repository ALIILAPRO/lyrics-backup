		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The wind that cracks the leaves
Has scattered all the seed
Lo, the light limned low
Low to the ground

The time is all I own
And time is come and gone
The limbs of life left low
Low to the ground

To the ground
To the ground
To the ground

The sight that holds my eyes
Has made the lovers blind
Alike their love laid low
Low to the ground

I sound the oath to sit
In thrall of weathers wit
Ally the languished lips
Low to the ground

To the ground
To the ground
To the ground

The seed that left the tree
Will carve a thousand leaves
And let them all to cleave
Low to the ground
