		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All out of time, infinite light
Try not to care if it turns out right
Given the ends, never made sense
To sift through yourself for anyone else

Up until three
Know it's all the same to me
And I'll put up with anything
But you can't change your mind

Because i'm fading now
My dreams just stress me out
When you're feeling low, like you told me
You just lie awake in your mind
Nothing helps
In the end

Sleep through the day, staying up late
Always inside, running in place
Never know why,
Hoping to find,
Some peace from this weight
To take it away

Call me right back
Someday soon we'll all be on track
See you in the summertime
If we don't lose our minds

Because I'm fading now
My dreams just stress me out
When you're feeling low
Like you told me
You just lie awake in your mind
Nothing helps
In the end

It's alright
I can tell the feeling changes
All the time
I can't make it stop
Oh, this life
Holds you to your promises
Takes everything just to exist
Won't ever make sense of it
