		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got in trouble for you
It all came outta the blue
You where laughin’ and smilin’ 
And fakin’ and lyin’ 
All at the same time
You where leavin’ me back 
So I packed my own bag
The question is: Why did I stay for so long?
Never thought I’d be so wrong
Soon as I turned you were gone
This is why I’m making this song
Hey

Cz’ I know that you wanna go
Next time I’m takin’ it slow
I seek for forgiveness, Baby 
But how do I believe? 
How can I trust anybody now?

I’m just tryna make you listen 
Baby, you don’t know the difference
Maybe I’m just stuck inside my head
Because of you 
I cannot trust a soul
No more
I hate this feelin’
I feel so alone

I got in trouble for you
It all came outta the blue
You where laughin’ and smilin’ 
And fakin’ and lyin’ 
All at the same time
You where leavin’ me back 
So I packed my own bag
The question is: Why did I stay for so long?
Never thought I’d be so wrong
Soon as I turned you were gone
This is why I’m making this song
Hey

Cz’ I know that you wanna go
Next time I’m takin’ it slow

I know that I gotta pray
I know that I’m gonna fall 
I know that
I know that you wanna go
I know that I love you babe
I know that you wanna go
I know that I gotta pray
I know that I’m gonna fall
I know that I love you babe
