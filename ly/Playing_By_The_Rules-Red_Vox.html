		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well I’ve been playing by the rules, and I just can’t get out of bed
I’ve been saying more than you, but I don’t have any more left
Yeah I'm a sucker and a fool and I'm in way over my head
I’m on a different point of view, but I’m just so out of my depth

Well I can play it kinda cool but I'm just like anyone else
And I'm ok to play the fool If you don't think anything less 
I’ve been deflated through and through but I can't have any regrets
Well I've been playing by the rules, but I don’t know who’s keeping check
