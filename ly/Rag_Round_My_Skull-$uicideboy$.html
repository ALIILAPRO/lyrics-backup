		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drugs in my veins with two hoes on my lap
I ain't gotta roll a thing
I got these bitches for that
I got that smoke by the ounce
I got them pills by the bottle
And if I ever run out
This junkie right here will rob ya
Trappin' out the ocean just so
I don't lose focus
I'm always sippin' purple potion
Keep them Backwoods in motion
Yeah, I use and I sell
Yeah, I'm straight out of Hell
You drop my name in any city
Bet it's gonna ring bells
Chop it up quick like a brick
I ain't got time for the small talk
Poppin' up quick, then I dip
See I don't wanna be bothered
Just know I hate you motherfuckers
And that's from the heart
Bunch of blowfish motherfuckers, and
We are the sharks, ho

Fuck all of y'all, bitch
I don't give a fuck if $uicideboy$
Never going to do shit
Still put the pistol in my mouth
Blow the back of my head out
Now I'm going to head out
Slit my fucking throat
Throw me in a shark tank
Either that or you can leave my
Bloody body in the motherfuckin' boat
Fuck everything and fuck myself
Fuck what you think
Leave me hanging by a belt
Brain banging with the pain
Grey staining is the game
Flames gaining my domain
Staying in the same lane
I ain't never going to change
See me dancing in the street
When that motherfucking blood rains
Everybody else is dealt with, bitch
Keep your fame and your wealth and shit

Grey, five nine grey, five nine
Grey, five nine grey, five nine
Grey, five nine grey, five nine
Grey, five nine grey, five nine
