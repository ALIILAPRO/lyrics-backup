		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Top secret 
Cant keep it 
Learn how to fool your friends 
In night class
 
Hot chase 
No breaks 
Nobody knows I'm in 
In spy school 
 
Sweaty seat 
Learning to creep 
I really hope I pass 
Pass this test 
 
Pick your nose 
Everybody nose 
Cant get away with it 
This class sucks 
 
Big test 
Hack your pets 
Turn em into your own spy dog 
 
Mind control 
Give up your soul 
Learning to hack 
Into the main frame 
 
Try and get away (just cant do it) x 3
 
Top secret 
Cant keep it 
Learn how to fool your friends 
In night class
 
Hot chase 
No breaks 
Nobody knows I'm in 
In spy school 
 
Sweaty seat 
Learning to creep 
I really hope I pass 
Pass this test 
 
Pick your nose 
Everybody nose 
Cant get away with it 
This class sucks 
 
Try and get away (just can't do it) x 3
 
Big test 
Hack your pets 
Turn em into your 
Own spy dog 
 
Mind control 
Give up your soul 
Learning to hack into the main frame 
 
Music for spies 
Dance in disguise  x2 
 
Try and get away (just cant do it)
