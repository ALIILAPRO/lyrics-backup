		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fly away with you
Oh darlin'
Fly away with me
My baby
Sing and play with you
My friend
Sing and play with me
My lover.
Baby
Baby
You're my really disco band
I like you
Baby
Baby
Just a really disco band
I like you.
Running down with you
My soldier
Running down with me
My sailor.
Smiling high with you
My cirriots
Smiling high with me
My radio.
Baby
Baby
You're my really disco band
I like you
Baby
Baby
Just a really disco band
I like you.
Left - right

I like together
Keep on try
Keep on try
Keep on try
Do it forever.
Left - right
Left - right
Left - right
I like together
. . .
Fly away with you
Oh darlin'
Fly away with me
My baby

Hey
You understand everybody clap your hands
Do you need your love come with me and sing a song.
Sit down on the chair think about your dance affairs
Nowthat sing is over. tuInin' back and sing all over.
