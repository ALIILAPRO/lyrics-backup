		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In your garden, in your bed
Tell me why, oh, why you left
Lit a fire in my head
Tell me why, oh, why you left

'Cause when I'm gone
I'm gonna tell you why
When I'm gone, I'm gonna tell you why
When I'm gone, I'm gonna tell you why
When I'm gone, I'm gonna tell you
'Bout my other lover you never wrote to me
And oh, my other you never wrote
Oh, my other you never called for me
And oh, my other

Never let me go, oh woah oh oh oh
Never let me go, oh oh oh oh

Cut me out and pull the thread
Tell me something sweet instead
These old flowers faded red
Why come back and leave again?

'Cause when I'm gone
I'm gonna tell you why
When I'm gone, I'm gonna tell you why
When I'm gone, I'm gonna tell you why
When I'm gone, I'm gonna tell you
'Bout my other love you never wrote to me
And oh, my other you never wrote
Oh, my other you never called for me
And oh, my other

I am sideways
Counting down to the mess you made
Well, it's somehow too late

'Cause when I'm gone
I'm gonna tell you why
When I'm gone, I'm gonna tell you why
When I'm gone, I'm gonna tell you why
When I'm gone, I'm gonna tell you

Never let me go, oh woah oh oh oh
Never let me go, oh oh oh oh
