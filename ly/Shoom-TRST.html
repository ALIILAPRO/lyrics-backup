		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish I could eat your sun as
I see you in a model light as
Curse your chance to softly
May pick it up and waste of time fuck
I wish to go life spend making
That's a golden heights
I wish for a second best
It's all that's set in time
In here sit inside
Your simple side
Your simple side's in me.
In her miss assign
This can't be mine
This can't be right
It's in me
Thinner curate side
This simple side

Old words in the sun
This can't be right,
This can't be right
It's in me
They know I scream it whoa oh oh
They know I screamed it whoa oh oh
Sometimes it go x 8
Whoa oh oh x 2
Why push away me, push away it could,
Push away life, oh shoom
Why push away me
Push away it could, push away life
Why push away me, push away it could,
Push away life, oh shoom
Why push away me
Push away it could, push away life
