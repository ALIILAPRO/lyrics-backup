		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's watch it burn
Let's watch it burn
Let's watch this city burn the world

Let's watch this city burn
From the sky lies the top the world
Til there's nothing left of her
Let's watch this city burn the world

Body doused in ash
With two empty cans of gas
The only evidence they have
Is the police sketch of my mask
And its hardly time to ask
If you can save my heart for last

And its hard to face the facts
When the darkness fades to black
It's not just make believe
When they make me take a seat
And they put amphetamines
In the air and make me breathe

So come on and grab your children
Look out for burning buildings
And villains who pillage
They're killing by the millions
And billions of people die
For a lost cause

So now I pray for my nation
That's destroyed under god

(It's the end of the world)
All my battles have been won
But the war has just begun

Let's watch this city burn
From the sky over top the world
Till there's nothing left in her
Let's watch the city burn away

The city looks so pretty
Do you wanna burn it with me?
Till the skies bleed ashes
And the fuckin' sky crashes

We make ashes just with matches
To ignite the flame
And all the hopes of the youth
Deemed fuckin' insane

Take the pill
And go get drunk
And go get killed
Double dose
As in life as in death
Breathing till there is no breath

I will not die in the night but in the light
Of the sun and the ashes
Of this world in my lungs

But who am I to say
Lets all just run away
Go grab your friends and pray
We're gonna rule the world today

(It's the end of the world)
It's the end of the earth
We've been done since our birth

Let's watch this city burn
From the sky over top the world
Till there's nothing left in her
Let's watch the city burn the world

(Let's watch it burn) [Repeat: x2]
The city looks so pretty
Do you wanna burn it with me?
The city looks so pretty
Do you wanna burn it with me?
The city looks so pretty
Do you wanna burn it with me?

We use the trees as torches
(Do you wanna burn it with me?)
Dot the streets with corpses
(Do you wanna burn it with me?)
We watch the city fuckin bleed
(Do you wanna burn it with me?)
And Bring the world to its knees
(Do you wanna burn it with me?)

Let's watch this city burn
From the sky over top the world
Til there's nothing left in her
Let's watch this city burn the world
Let's watch this city burn
From the sky over top the world
Til there's nothing left in her
Let's watch this city burn the world

Let's watch it burn
Let's watch it burn
Let's watch this city burn the world
