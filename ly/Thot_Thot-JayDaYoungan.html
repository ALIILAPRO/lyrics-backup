		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Heartbeatz on the track)

Pulled up, drop top, Backwood, hot box
Pickin' up my thot thot, tryna hit a hot spot
Extra clips, hot Glocks, fuck 12, cops watch
Bitch, we got the block hot, they think we gon' stop, not
I don't talk on cellphones, bro called through a jail phone
Bitch, blow up my phone, she ask when I'm comin' home
I can't leave her 'lone, she just like my backbone
I used to be on bond, trappin' 'til the pack gone

Designer gear come mismatched
Stop callin' for your bitch back
Glock right by my six-pack
I'm poppin' Percs like Tic-Tacs
Can't lie, I got my shit snatched
But I came for my shit back
Pull up like, "Let me get that"
Got somethin' for they bitch ass
Bitch I brung them knots out
Don't make us bring them Glocks out (them Glocks out)
Tryna catch the opps out
Fuck school, I dropped out (I dropped out)
Bad bitch, she jocked out
Good dick got her knocked out
She hate when I pull out
She like it in her mouth
I love the microphone
She tell me she like my songs (she like my songs)
Let her suck all on my balls
Yeah, while I write this song (I write this song)
You better not stop until I say
I know it might be long (it might be long)
I put it all across her face
Then fuck her all night long

Pulled up, drop top, Backwood, hot box
Pickin' up my thot thot, tryna hit a hot spot
Extra clips, hot Glocks, fuck 12, cops watch
Bitch, we got the block hot, they think we gon' stop, not
I don't talk on cellphones, bro called through a jail phone
Bitch, blow up my phone, she ask when I'm comin' home
I can't leave her 'lone, she just like my backbone
I used to be on bond, trappin' 'til the pack gone

Bro called through a jail phone
She ask when I'm comin' home
Trappin' 'til the pack gone
Trappin' 'til the pack gone
