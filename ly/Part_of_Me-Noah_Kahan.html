		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I forgot the things I've done
It's just good to be alive
And I can stay grateful for the sun
Though it's getting in my eyes
And how was Salt Lake City dear?
Do you feel me? Mm

'Cause now you let your heart get filled
With someone else's love
And now, you've let your head get held
In someone else's arms
And if I died tomorrow, babe
Would you feel me?
Feel me

'Cause you were only a little bit of light
And you were only a minute of my time
I don't miss you
I miss the way you made me feel

Like I lost part of me out there
My mind, my mind
When the space between our bodies disappeared
My mind, my mind
Even through the pain
I can't recall your face
Just the ache of knowing everything was gonna change
Got so close to love with you, my dear
But I don't miss you
I miss the way you made me feel

And there was something in the air
As we drove your parents car
Fire we both knew was there
But couldn't bring ourselves to start
I screamed the words inside your head
And hoped you'd feel me
Feel me

'Cause you were only a little bit of light
You were only a minute of my time
I don't miss you
I miss the way you made me feel

Like I lost part of me out there
My mind, my mind
When the space between our bodies disappeared
My mind, my mind
Even through the pain
I can't recall your face
Just the ache of knowing everything was gonna change
Got so close to love with you, my dear
But I don't miss you
I miss the way you made me feel

I know
That the moment I chase is a race that I've already lost
It's long ago
And you were only a break from the fear of being alone
But I'm sure
Feeling the ache is better than nothing at all

Feels like I lost part of me out there
My mind, my mind
When the space between our bodies disappeared
My mind, my mind
Even through the pain
I can't recall your face
Just the ache of knowing everything was gonna change
Got so close to love with you, my dear
But I don't miss you
I miss the way you made me feel
