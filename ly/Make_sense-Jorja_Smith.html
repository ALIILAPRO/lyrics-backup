		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm just tryna make sense of this
Wasn't waitin' for somethin' else that I could fall for
I weren't wishin' for a love like this, no
You're openin' up for me, so I can

Funny how it happens when the rain falls, rain's outside
And it never would've happened if I stayed in on this night
If you only wanna walk when the sun's up, you would never know what burns
Only gonna happen when the rain's done, never know what you'll find

A home in you I found
A home in you I found

Why I couldn't make sense of this is
'Cause a love like this is nothin' I have known before
I've known nothin' but sink or swim
And you're holdin' me up, so I am

Funny how it happens when the rain falls, rain's outside
And it never would've happened if I stayed in on this night
If you only wanna walk when the sun's up, you would never know what burns
Only gonna happen when the rain's done, never know what you'll find

A home in you I found
A home in you I found

(Funny how it happens when the rain falls, rain's outside)
(And it never would've happened if I stayed in on this night)
(If you only wanna walk when the sun's up, you would never know what burns)
(Only gonna happen when the rain's done, never know what you'll find)
