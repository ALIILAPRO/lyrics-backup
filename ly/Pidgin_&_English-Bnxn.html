		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got my issues, I admit that
You got some things that hold you back
But we are acting like we children
Looking to blame for what we lack
Before we lose everything we have tomorrow
Can we forget what went wrong yesterday, darling

Girl I'm the streets I thought I could be discreet
But I messed up something sweet
Just what I need is some time to tell you please
I'm on my knees this was never to be
I did rubbish and it is just what it is
With a heart that's full of needs and my lungs that barely breathe
You're what I need I admit it, I admit
No one could ever love me better than you did
No one could ever love me better than you did

Who could have thought these feeling would cease
But then I miss you laying in my sheets
Se you no see as my heart e dey bleed
I don't wanna lose you to what I did
And for your heart I place the highest bid
Gimme an offer I just can't resist
Na for Pidgin and English I Dey speak
You know I ain't speaking Japanese

I got my issues, I admit that
You got some things that hold you back
But we are acting like we children
Looking to blame for what we lack
Before we lose everything we have tomorrow
Can we forget what went wrong yesterday, darling

It's my fault and I blame me I don't blame the alcohol
I really should have known better wasn't thinking at all
Maybe with my penis but not with my brain and I know
This was off the limits now I gotta watch as you go
It's the apology I couldn't say to you I know
If I could take back what I did I would do it for sure
If I could get you the world I would do it for you
It's loyalty you deserve I'ma give it to you

Who could have thought these feeling would cease
But then I miss you laying in my sheets
Se you no see as my heart e dey bleed
I don't wanna lose you to what I did
And for your heart I place the highest bid
Gimme an offer I just can't resist
Na for Pidgin and English I Dey speak
You know I ain't speaking Japanese

I got my issues, I admit that
You got some things that hold you back
But we are acting like we children
Looking to blame for what we lack
Before we lose everything we have tomorrow
Can we forget what went wrong yesterday, darling
