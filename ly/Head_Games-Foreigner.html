		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Day light, alright, I don't know, I don't know if it's real
Been a long night, and something ain't right
You won't show, you won't show how you feel
No time ever seems right, to talk about the reasons why you and I fight
It's high time to draw the line, put an end to this game, before it's too late
Head games, it's you and me, baby
Head games, and I can't take it anymore
Head games, I don't want to play the head games
A daydream, for hours it seems, I keep thinking of you, yeah thinking of you
These daydreams, what do they mean
They keep haunting me, are they warning me
Daylight turns into night
We try and find the answer, but it's nowhere in sight
It's always the same, and you know who's to blame
You know what I'm saying, still we keep on playing
Head games, that's all I get from you
Head games, and I can't take it anymore
Head games, don't want to play the head games

So near, so far away, we pass each other by 'cause we don't know what to say
It's so clear, I'm sorry to say
But if you want to win, you gotta learn how to play
Head games, always you and me, baby
Head games, till I can't take it anymore
Head games, instead of making love
Head games, oh
Head games, always you and me, baby
Head games, till I can't take it anymore, no more
Head games, instead of making love, we play
Head games
Head games, in the first degree
Head games, yeah, always you and me
Head games, why do you do it, baby
Head games, you put me trough it baby
