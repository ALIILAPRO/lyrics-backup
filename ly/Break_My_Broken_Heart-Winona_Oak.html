		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I could I would've warned you
But it's scaring me how it all can't stop
It's so easy 'til there's no way out
If I could I wouldn't tell you
But it honestly doesn't matter much
'Cause I know you probably figured out

Fools fallin' in the dark like crazy
You know, nothin' you can do will save me
No, might as well

Break my broken heart
Give me all you got, all you got
Break my broken heart
Watch me fall apart, fall apart
Ooh, ooh, I'm still breathing
Ooh, ooh, so what's one more scar?
Break my broken heart

Can we be this way forever?
Got your silhouette locked inside my head
Can we be the ones to last as stone?

Fools fallin' in the dark like crazy
You know, nothin' you can do will save me
No, might as well

Break my broken heart
Give me all you got, all you got
Break my broken heart
Watch me fall apart, fall apart
Ooh, ooh, I'm still breathing
Ooh, ooh, so what's one more scar?
Break my broken heart

Go on, go on (ooh)
Go on, go on (ooh)
Go on, go on (ooh)

Break my broken heart
Give me all you got, all you got
Break my broken heart
Watch me fall apart, fall apart
Ooh, ooh, I'm still breathing
Ooh, ooh, so what's one more scar?
Break my broken heart
