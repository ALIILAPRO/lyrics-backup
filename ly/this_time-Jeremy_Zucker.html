		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe I'm a hypocrite, nope, I'm just an idiot
Safe to say I'm losing it, right on time
Coffee and a cigarette, lurking on the internet
Safe to say I'm over it, I'm over it

'Cause lately I can't focus, and everybody knows it
No, I don't think I'm fine without you in mind
This heart is used to breaking, but now my body's aching
I'll try to be alright without you this time

This time (you're the only one I love)
Oh, this time, oh-oh (you're the only one I'd ever trust)

Mind and body never felt united
And I'm blanking out until I get excited
Think I dropped my phone in a Carolina
Somewhere far from home, at least it's in one of two states

'Cause lately I can't focus, and everybody knows it
No, I don't think I'm fine without you in mind
This heart is used to breaking, but now my body's aching
I'll try to be alright without you this time

This time

You're the only one I love, yeah
You're the only one I'd ever trust (can you hear me?)
You're the only one that runs
You're the only one that's good for us

'Cause lately I can't focus, and everybody knows it
No, I don't think I'm fine without you in mind
This heart is used to breaking, but now my body's aching
I'll try to be alright without you this time
