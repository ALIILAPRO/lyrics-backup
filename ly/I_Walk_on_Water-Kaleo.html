		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I, I walk on water
High above all beneath

Fly, before I could tell you
Oh that I, I walk on water
I walk on water
Life, in such a hurry
Thrive as long as you can
Goodbye to all my worries
Oh cause I, I walk on water

Put your trust in me, put your trust in me
Put your trust in me, put your trust in me
I walk on water
I feel stronger, I feel stronger than I used to

My feet, my feet don't touch the ground

I don't worry, I don't worry any longer

When your heart dies, your soul cries out for more
She said walk on, walk on to the water
I went further, I went further than before
We don't need to have fear of going under
Because I can hold you now, anytime

Put your trust in me, put your trust in me
I put my trust in you, put my trust in you
I walk on water
(I put my trust in you, put my trust in you)
(I walk on water)

(I put my trust in you, put my trust in you)
(I walk on water)

(I put my trust in you, put my trust in you)
(I walk on water)

Brother, brother
I must tell you
(Follow me, follow me, follow)
I walk on water (follow me, follow me)
(Follow me, follow me) (follow me, follow me)
(Follow me, follow me) (follow me, follow me)
I, I walk on water
High, above all beneath
