		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get up, get the hell on outta here
Cut the ropes that bind you
Stand up, straight into your fear
Leave the past behind you

Your cautious ways, have spawned your nothing

Life, is just an empty stage
Where do you go from here
Living, puts the words upon the page
Open to a new frontier

Your mundane life, is history
You'll seize the day, it's mystery

Cut the ripcord, don't look back
Burn the bridges down
Grab the handle, clench your fist
Beat the bastards down

Fire, there's fire in your heart
Flames of passion burn
Higher, raging from the start
And now there's no return

Go have your way, your fantasy
Embrace the day, it's destiny

Cut the ripcord, don't look back
Burn the bridges down
Grab the handle, clench your fist
Beat the bastards down
Cut the ripcord, no turning back
Bum the bridges down
Grab the handle, crack the whip
Beat the bastards down beat em' down

Cut the ripcord, don't look back
Burn the bridges down
Grab the handle, clench your fist
Beat the bastards down
Cut the ripcord, no turning back
Burn the bridges down
Grab the handle, crack the whip
Beat the bastards down
Beat em' down
