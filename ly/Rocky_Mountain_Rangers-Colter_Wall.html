		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Unfit was I for the Scarlett Mounties,
Dandy dude townies,
Drunkard down and outies
But I knowed some boys that I once called family 
Mounted high in the year of 85

Major Stewart went down and he left his cows 
Back in Fort McLeod
When the news circled round
That the Métis had enough 
And there's rustlers on the prowl
And Assiniboia needs us boys 
To straighten her out

Rocky Mountain Rangers
Riding o'er the plains sir
Of all the western Calvalry
There's none any stranger 
Rocky Mountain Rangers
Well equipped for danger
Mounted high in the year of 85

One evenings patrol on cypress hills 
We drank up our fill 
And the hour was still 
When a Winchester shot 
Like the ringing of a bell 
Some boys of Gabriel Dumont's are shooting us to hell 

So it's raise up your six-guns 
Lest we be undone
Rake some fur, slack them reins 
Let your ponies run, run
How I survived I may never understand son 
Wooly times in the year of 85

Rocky Mountain Rangers
Riding o'er the plains sir
Of all the western Calvalry
There's none any stranger 
Rocky Mountain Rangers
Well equipped for danger
Mounted high in the year of 85

Disbanded in the year of 85
