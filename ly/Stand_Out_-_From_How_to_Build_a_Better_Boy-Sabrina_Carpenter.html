		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't sweat on the little things just
Keep your eye on the bigger things cause
If you look a little closer 
You're gonna get a better picture

Your heart beats like a marching drum
It's telling you to keep on walking on and
You gotta find a little fire
Shine your light a little brighter
You and I were meant to fire like rockets in the night

Keep your head up 
Shoot the clouds down
Throw it all in
Break your own ground

And if your gonna make a mess make it loud
And if your gonna take a stand
Stand out

Life is our game
We can go play
Shake up the rules
Don't be afraid

And if your gonna make a mess make it loud
And if your gonna take a stand stand out

Stand out 
Oh oh oh oh
[x4]

Stand out

Jump on to the roller coaster
Up up, now
We're getting closer
We can be the silver lining 
For every treasure that is hiding

We're coming on at the speed of light yeah
Boom boom
It's like dynamite 
We're gonna start a revolution 
Don't stop keep moving

You and I were meant to fire like rockets in the night

Keep your head up 
Shoot the clouds down
Throw it all in
Break your own ground

And if your gonna make a mess make it loud
And if your gonna take a stand
Stand out

Life is our game
We can go play
Shake up the rules
Don't be afraid

And if your gonna make a mess make it loud
And if your gonna take a stand
Stand out

Stand out 
Oh oh oh oh 
[x8]

Stand out

Be the voice
Be the cause
Be the change
Be yourself 
thats the best you can be

You and I were meant to fire like rockets in the night

Keep your head up 
Shoot the clouds down
Throw it all in
Break your own ground

And if your gonna make a mess make it loud
And if your gonna take a stand
Stand out

Life is our game
We can go play
Shake up the rules
Don't be afraid

And if your gonna make a mess make it loud
And if your gonna take a stand
Stand out

Stand out 
Oh oh oh oh 
[x8]

Stand out
