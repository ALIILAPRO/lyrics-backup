		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love the fish, I think it's fun
I think that I love the fish because I think it's fun
There's lots of fish for you to catch
I think that fishing and I are just a perfect match

Fish are swimming in the pond
And fish are swimming in the place where all the water is
Won't you come and fish with me?
Let's go to where the fish are in and go to there and catch fish

Let's take a boat out on the lake
Together now with all our friends
Let's make memories of catching fish with all our friends
Look, there's a bluegill and a carp
And there's a sunshine bass as well
And a spotted bass, and there's another carp over there

Let's take a boat out on the lake
Together now with all our friends
Let's make memories of catching fish with all our friends
Look there's a Guadalupe bass
And there's a hybrid striped bass
And a black acara, and another carp over there

I cast my line into the lake
And maybe I'll catch a fish 'cause there are fish in the lake
I love the water and the boat
When I go out on the lake it's what I love the most

Fish are swimming in the pond
And fish are swimming in the place where all the water is
Won't you come and fish with me?
Let's go to where the fish are in and go to there and catch fish

Oh man, I fucking love fishing
Right here with all my friends
When you're out there fishing with the guys the fun never ends
Look, there's a blue tilapia and there's an alligator gar
And a longnose gar and there's another carp over there
Let's take a boat out on the lake together now with all our friends
When you're out there fishing with the guys the fun never ends
Look there's a bowfin and a carp
And there's a walleye and a carp
And a flathead catfish and another carp over there
