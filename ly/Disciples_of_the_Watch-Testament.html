		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cast to the fire
Banned by the light
Worship and listen to me
Condemned in his mind
In his evil place
Your fate is all that you'll see
I am the one
To show you the path
Salvation is in the fields
Listen up children and follow me
Or I'll let you pay the price
Of malachi!

Disciples of the watch
Obey!
Or I'll burn you to that cross!

Holding the mass
The demon is cast
To resurrect your soul
Calling to him
Is like an evil sin
A prophet is what they're told
Taking the land under command
Killing friend or foe
Feel the might of his evil wrath
Desecrate your soul!

Disciples of the watch
Obey!
Or I'll burn you to that cross!

Cast to the fire
Banned by the light
Worship and listen to me
Condemned in his mind
In his evil place
Your fate is all that you'll see
I am the one
To show you the path
Salvation is in the fields
Listen up children and follow me
Or I'll let you pay the price
Of malachi!

Disciples of the watch
Obey!
Or I'll burn you to that cross!
