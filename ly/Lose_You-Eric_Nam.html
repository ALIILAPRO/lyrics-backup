		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eyes wide shut dreaming about you
Hot blood rush turning a cold blue
See you touch but I'm feeling nothing, I'm feeling nothing

I'm in California, you, you out in Georgia
But we both in the same room
Staring at perfection, I'm about to wreck it
It's just something I gotta do

I think I wanna lose you
Just to find my way back to you
I think I wanna break up
Just to make it all up to you
I don't wanna let go, let go
But I gotta let go, let go
I think I wanna lose you
Just to find my way back to you

I can't blame you if you hate me
You might think I'm some kind of crazy
Asking me "did you even love me?"
"Did you even love me?"

'Cause I'm in California, you, you out in Georgia
But we both in the same room
But I, if I stay with you, we won't make it
It's just something we gotta do

I think I wanna lose you
Just to find my way back to you
I think I wanna break up
Just to make it all up to you
I don't wanna let go, let go
But I gotta let go, let go
I think I wanna lose you
Just to find my way back to you, ooh

I don't wanna let go (let go, let go, let go)
But I gotta let go (let go, let go, let go)

I think I wanna lose you (lose you)
Just to find my way back to you (find my way)
I think I wanna break up (break up)
Just to make it all up to you, oh
I don't wanna let go, let go (let go)
But I gotta let go, let go
I think I wanna lose you
Just to find my way back to you, oh, oh
