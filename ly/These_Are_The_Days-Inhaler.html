		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm stranded here again, another Friday night
Turn up the music, black out the lights
Best kinda scene, I shouldn't have been
Bandits in charge of the silver machine and
One of our friends is along for the ride
Hangin' from the window, out of his mind
I don't want my luck to fall at my feet
Don't wanna feel a thing, just wanna hear you scream, yeah

These are
These are the days that follow you home
These are the days that kiss you on your broken nose
These are the days, I don't miss the feeling of being alone
These are the days, these are the days

We were breakin' the limit, then we broke down
Turned to the left to some no-name town
Everybody's got a dream, I like it best when I'm in it
Comin' 'round the corner, I'll be there in a minute
And I'm comin' up on somethin' sweet
I'm leavin' with the first person I meet
I'm holdin' out, I'm hangin' on
For that moment where it all goes wrong, yeah

These are
These are the days that follow you home
These are the days that kiss you on your broken nose
These are the days, I don't miss the feeling of being alone
These are the days, these are the days

And we can do anything we want for a while
They say
And tell you to behave with a smile
Don't turn
Don't turn and run away
Don't hide
'Cause we can do anything we want for a while

I think we're gonna be okay
Yeah, I think we're gonna be okay

These are
These are the days that follow you home
These are the days that kiss you on your broken nose
These are the days, I don't miss the feeling of being alone
These are the days, these are the days

These days
I think we're gonna be okay
