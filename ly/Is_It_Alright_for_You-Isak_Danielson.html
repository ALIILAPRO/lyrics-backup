		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Spilling out my coffee, singing in the wrong tune
Nothing goes the way it should
Waiting for the days to leave
So dreams can come, take care of me

Losing my directions, breathing under water
Acting like somebody else
Is this really happening, who can tell

I can feel your eyes gazing at me
Under your spell, what do you need
And tell me this, is it alright for you

When I'm in my wildest dreams
I wake up thinking that you're touching me
In the silence I hear you speak
"Isak, remember me"
I don't know if we'll ever meet
I don't even look before I cross the street
'Cause you're the only thing I see

Forgetting who my friends are, falling into Mozart
What do I believe in now?
Diving into darker seas
Maybe it's my destiny

Losing my ambitions, loving how the pain feels
Maybe I am meant to bleed
Am I dying in reality, who can tell

I can feel your eyes gazing at me
Under your spell, what do you need
And tell me this, is it alright for you

When I'm in my wildest dreams
I wake up thinking that you're touching me
In the silence I hear you speak
"Isak, remember me"
I don't know if we'll ever meet
I don't even look before I cross the street
'Cause you're the only thing I see
