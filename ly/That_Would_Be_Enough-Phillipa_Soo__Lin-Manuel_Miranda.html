		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around

How long have you known?

A month or so

Eliza, you should have told me

I wrote to the General a month ago

No

I begged him to send you home

You should have told me

I'm not sorry

You knew you'd fight
Until the war was won
The war's not done
But you deserve a chance to meet your son
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now

Will you relish being a poor man's wife
Unable to provide for your life?

I relish being your wife
Look around, look around

Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough

And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile
Or a fragment of your mind, look out world
That would be enough

I don't pretend to know
The challenges you're facing
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind

But I'm not afraid
I know who I married
So long as you come home at the end of the day
That would be enough

We don't need a legacy
We don't need money
If I could grant you peace of mind

If you could let me inside your heart
Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
In the story they will write someday
Let this moment be the first chapter
Where you decide to stay
And I could be enough
And we could be enough
That would be enough
