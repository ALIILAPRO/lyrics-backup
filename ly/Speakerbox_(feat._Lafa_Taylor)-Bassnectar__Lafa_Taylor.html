		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  With the likkle guns, come
All them wanna bust guns
On the run when I come with that warrior song
Got my back to the sun, when I rise
I'm the one, chosen for the day proud
I'm the warrior's son

With the likkle guns, come
All them wanna bust guns
On the run when I come with that warrior song
Got my back to the sun, when I rise
I'm the one, chosen for the day proud
I'm the warrior's son

We about to go
We about to go up
We about to go
We about to go up
Like up, like up, like up, like up-up-up-up-up-up
Like woo!

Got the whole spot going up like that
Laid back hot in the cut like that
We can turn the dance floor into an elevator
In a millisecond have it going up like that

We can switch up like that
Front to the full back, front to the back
Speakerbox blast go rat tat tat tat
In fact we about to go roll up like woo!

Speakerbox blast, speaker-speakerbox blast, go
Speakerbox blast go rat-tat-tat-tat!
Speakerbox blast go rat-tat-tat-tat
Laying back in the, back in the cut like that
Speakerbox blast, speaker-speakerbox blast, go
Speakerbox blast go rat-tat-tat-tat!
Speakerbox blast go rat-tat-tat-tat
In fact we about to go up like

Got the whole spot going up
Got the, got the, got the,, got the whole,
Got the whole spot like,
Got the whole block going up,
Bass, got the whole, got the whole block like,
Everybody in the party going up,
It's a, it's ab, it's about to get hot
Like hot, like hot, like hot, like,
Got the whole spot going up like, woo!

With the likkle guns, come
All them wanna bust guns
On the run when I come with that warrior song
Got my back to the sun, when I rise
I'm the one, chosen for the day proud
I'm the warrior's son

With the likkle guns, come
All them wanna bust guns
On the run when I come with that warrior song
Got my back to the sun, when I rise
I'm the one, chosen for the day proud
I'm the warrior's son
