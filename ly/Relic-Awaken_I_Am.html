		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why do I find that it's harder to tell the truth when it's tearing me apart?
Like a moth to a flame I can't help that I'm drawn to you. 

Now I notice part of me could tell where I was wrong,
When I felt the best part of me leave the day you said that you were gone,
But I'm where it all started and I'm still falling, this is all there is. 

I can feel your blood in my veins, 
And I feel your voice in every breath you're calling my name, 
And it never seems to end. 

I'm giving in this time, it's alright.
If we're born to live and live to die, 
Then I don't want to lie to buy a little time, 
If that's what it takes for me to feel alive.

Now I know that things I did were wrong,
But I felt the best part of me leave the day you said that you were gone,
But I'm where it all started and I'm still falling, this is all there is.

I can feel your blood in my veins, 
And I feel your voice in every breath you're calling my name, 
And it never seems to end. 


Well I've watched you as you've turned from gold to a shadow made of stone,
But how could I ever let you go with your hands around my throat?

I can feel your blood in my veins, 
And I feel your voice in every breath you're calling my name, 
And it never seems to end.
