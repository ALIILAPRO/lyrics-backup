		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every little moment, oh, she dreams of you
Half a million miles of love come true
How can you mend all the heartaches you've made?
What is easy for two, is so hard for one
What is gonna happen when the summer's gone?
How can you mend all the heartaches that you've made?
Baby, how can you mend all the heartaches that you've made?

Someone is breaking Angie's heart
What about the thing called love?
He's breaking Angie's heart
Her heart, her heart

Someone is breaking Angie's heart
One night is not enough
Everybody got to believe in someone
Ooh, Angie

Angie, there will never be another you
If it doesn't fit that your dreams come true
How can he mend all the heartaches he has made?
Tears of love, you wasted for this love affair
And his love will really hurt you, oh, to care
How can he mend all the heartaches he has made?
Baby, how can he mend all the heartaches he has made?
