		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where does love go
When you're not in love
How does it feel when nobody wants it
Tell me does it float around
Like a little lost cloud
When a heart is not its home

What does love do
When it's not being used
Feeling like just don't belong
Tell me is it laying awake
In the middle of the night
Just thinking 'bout what went wrong

'Cause when I look in your eyes - it's just not there
When I hunger for affection - the cupboard is bare
I don't know why I keep hanging on
When love's got the message and its already gone

Why am I always the last to know
Tell me why is it always me alone
Still dancing when the party's over
Why am I always the last to see
Just a fool who believes you're still in love with me
Even love can see it's over
I'm always the last to know

What do I do
Till I'm back on my feet
Do I hang around and try to pretend
That I'm really over you
And it won't take long
Till love says it's my turn again

'Cause when I look in your eyes - it's just not there
When I hunger for affection - the cupboard is bare
I don't know why I keep hanging on
When love's got the message and its already gone

Why am I always the last to know
Tell me why is it always me alone
Still dancing when the party's over
Why am I always the last to see
Just a fool who believes you're still in love with me
Even love can see it's over
I'm always the last to know

The next time I fall
I'll be taking my time
To find out if her heart is mine

Why am I always the last to know
Tell me why is it always me alone
Still dancing when the party's over
Why am I always the last to see
Just a fool who believes you're still in love with me
Even love can see it's over
I'm always the last to know
