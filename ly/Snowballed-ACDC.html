		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Crashed out of the market, out on the floor
Washed up on the shore
Bombed out of the city, out of the door
Blown up against the wall
Put out of the picture, axe about to fall
Walk before you crawl
Dragged down to the bottom, screaming for air
The shark must get his share

You could see it coming
Miles and miles away
Women, drink and money
Are gonna make you pay

Snowballed, ooh yeah
Snowballed, they done it again
Snowballed, making me blind
Snowballed

The howl of the wolf, snow in his eyes
Waiting to take you by surprise
Eye of the needle, heat of the fight
Watch those teeth 'cause they're ready to bite

You can see it coming
Miles and miles away
Women, drink and money
Are gonna make you pay

You've been snowballed, yes, you have
Snowballed, I've been fooled again
Snowballed, that's all
Snowballed
Out of my mind (one more time)

Snowballed
Snowballed
Snowballed
Snowballed
Snowballed, snowballed
Snowballed, snowballed
You've been snowballed
Snowballed
You've been snow
You've been snow
Snow
Ball, ball, balled
