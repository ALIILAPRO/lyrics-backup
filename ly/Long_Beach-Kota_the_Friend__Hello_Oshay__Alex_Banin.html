		  (Hey)
(Hey)
(Hey)

She just want head in the mornin'
She just want lay in the daylight (hey)
She ain't tryna do no fallin'
Don't want love if it ain't right (hey)
Walk on the beach on Sunday afternoon 
And make her feel alive (hey)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah (hey) (hey)

I can change the story if you let me
Promise in the mornin' won't forget me (hey)
Lately I been missin' California
I am far from perfect but you get me (hey)
A lot of miles gettin' in the way
I just want to give you what you want (hey)
I been thinkin' bout you everyday
Catch a plane and wait for me to come through (hey)

She a whole mood, there ain't nothin' that I won't do (hey)
Chillin' in at the bar, while she back it up
A good girl but she actin' up, a good girl but she bad as fuck (hey)
She on ten but I'm catchin' up, she sweat me and I gas her up
I'd be dumb (hey) if I pass it up, those eyes said I had to jump
And her mind said I had to (hey)
One, two, three, I'm inspired by your energy (hey)
Four, five, six, feel your spirit on my finger tips (hey)
And seven, eight, nine, thank your mamma 'cause you so damn fine (hey)
And I don't really want to say goodbye
Let me stay the night again (hey)

She just want head in the mornin'
She just want lay in the daylight (hey)
She ain't tryna do no fallin'
Don't want love if it ain't right (hey)
Walk on the beach on Sunday afternoon 
And make her feel alive (hey)
Oh yeah (oh yeah), oh yeah, oh yeah (hey)

I can change the story if you let me
Promise in the mornin' won't forget me (hey)
Lately I been missin' California
I am far from perfect but you get me (hey)
Lot of miles gettin' in the way
I just want to give you what you want (hey)
I been thinkin' bout you everyday
Catch a plane and wait for me to come through (hey)
Come through (hey)

(Hey) Hit me up and I'll be on the way
Scoop you up and grab you by the waist
(Hey) Take you anywhere you wanna go
I'm aware that you just wanna play
(Hey) I know that we goin' with the flow
Soon I'm 'bout to go and catch a plane
(Hey) Baby won't you open up the door
Tell me you are happy that I came, through (hey)
Never had a thang like you
Lil' brown girl that can hang like you (hey)
Shine so bright in the daylight, moonlight
Makin' that lil' thang shake like you
Love in the back of the whip
Should we take it back to the crib
Shawty like crack no cap (hey)
Don't know how to act with the kid
Keepin' a stack, what it is, what she want (hey)

She just want head in the mornin'
She just want lay in the daylight (hey)
She ain't tryna do no fallin'
Don't want love if it ain't right (hey)
Walk on the beach on Sunday afternoon 
To make her feel alive (hey)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah (hey)

I can change the story if you let me
Promise in the mornin' won't forget me (hey)
Lately I been missin' California
I am far from perfect but you get me (hey)
Lot of miles gettin' in the way
I just want to give you what you want (hey)
I been thinkin' bout you everyday
Catch a plane and wait for me to come through (hey)
Come through

I can change the story if you let me
Promise in the mornin' won't forget me (hey)
Lately I been missin' California
I am far from perfect but you get me (hey)
Lot of miles gettin' in the way
I just want to give you what you want (hey)
I been thinkin' bout you everyday
Catch a plane and wait for me to come through (hey)

Come through
Come through (hey)
Come through
