		  (Hold up, Pluto)
(They said that they wanted that)
How you comin'? (ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob)

I can boss a bitch up for a nut (for a nut)
That lil' bitty watch, it wasn't nothin' (wasn't nothin')
I can boss a bitch up for a nut (for a nut)
That lil' bitty watch, it wasn't nothin' (wasn't nothin')
That lil' bitty watch cost nothin' (cost nothin')
That lil' bitty watch cost me nothin' (cost me nothin')
I can boss a bitch up for a nut (for a nut)
That lil' bitty watch cost nothin' (cost nothin')

Yeah, that skelly AP plain cost me nothin' (nothin')
We mention tickets, we not talkin' bus or plane (woo)
She ripped my Dior shirt 'cause it had nut stains (nut stains)
Love how she slurp, I put two carats in her lip ring (lip ring)
Multi-millionaire motto (motto), fuck a top model (model)
Tuesday taco (taco), Wednesday Cabo (yeah)
Foreign push-start auto, this not a Silverado (not a Silverado)
Rich, I ain't hit the lotto', hit Cash when I'm in Toronto (hit Cash)

I can boss a bitch up for a nut (for a nut)
That lil' bitty watch, it wasn't nothin' (wasn't nothin')
That lil' bitty watch cost nothin' (cost nothin')
That lil' bitty watch cost me nothin' (cost me nothin')
I can boss a bitch up for a nut (for a nut)
That lil' bitty watch cost nothin' (cost nothin')

(Woo, super) Birkin bag, crocodile sandals
Emilio Pucci pajamas (super)
I just swipe for it like a scammer (super)
Birkin bag Kelly crocodile (super)
Ain't had no head like that in a while (whoa)
Herm√®s spillin' like you just walked out the shower
Buy a Birk' for the bitch 'fore I buy her flowers (woo)
Go lurk for it, clutchin' a banana (woo)
Got monkey nuts, spray shit on camera (Pluto)
I ain't got time, might've wear a Rollie (whoa)
Bought a bust down, suck it, hold it up
Give her a lil' clout, I was rushin'

I can boss a bitch up for a nut (for a nut)
That lil' bitty watch, it wasn't nothin' (wasn't nothin')
That lil' bitty watch cost nothin' (cost nothin')
That lil' bitty watch cost me nothin' (cost me nothin')
I can boss a bitch up for a nut (for a nut)
That lil' bitty watch cost nothin' (cost nothin')

I just left your watch in the mud
How the fuck a nig- nigga, nigga like me ain't up? (yeah, ayy)
I just put some diamonds in her butt (butt)
And I seen it shinin' when she nut (nut)
Load the jet with good pounds of musty (ha)
I can't sit on my pocket 'cause it's bustin' (bustin')
Shoot him in his face if you don't trust him (woo)
She just ate cum, we in Hong Kong (woo)
Big shades on just like Farrakhan (woo)
I just met her tongue and it's fire, yeah (woo, yeah)
Yeah, talk to me, bitch (yeah)
Hell to the yeah (yeah, yeah)
I don't drink beer (yeah)
Yeah, nigga, yeah (yeah, yeah)
I supply the tip (yeah)
Ten mil' on a crib (yeah, yeah)
And I'm havin' spill (ayy)
Yeah, nigga, yeah (slatt)

I can boss a bitch up for a nut (for a nut)
That lil' bitty watch, it wasn't nothin' (wasn't nothin')
That lil' bitty watch cost nothin' (cost nothin')
That lil' bitty watch cost me nothin' (ayy, slatt)
I can boss a bitch up for a nut (for a nut)
That lil' bitty watch cost nothin' (cost nothin')
That lil' bitty watch cost nothin' (cost nothin')
I can boss a bitch up for a nut (for a nut, ayy, slatt)

They said that they wanted that
How you comin'?
