		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hollow inside - I didn't sleep too well last night
Step over, turn the light
Hollow inside - I didn't dream too much last night
Step over, turn the light

Knock on the door - these are the interfering themes
Open it up, too soon

Shorter in time - the interactive parts go by
I fear for a while - my head

I fear for a while - that my head will expand
And stretch out in to the stratos wild

Can't you see, those birds in limbo breaks
And of course you hear, listen, the straws
From above you, and underneath in the glow
I can touch them
Spiritualized

Dogs with bones, they are released
One too many to get on
