		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been tryin' to keep myself busy, woah-oh-oh
I've been tryin' to numb all the pain, woah-oh-oh

I have seen the writings on the wall
Telling me this time you're really gone

Oh, why, oh, why, oh, why?
Baby, why, oh, why can't I forget you, forget you?
Oh, why, oh, why, oh, why?
Baby, why, oh, why can't I forget you, can't forget you?

You're all I'm thinkin' of
It's such a lonely love
Oh, why, oh, why, oh, why?
Baby, why, oh, why can't I forget you, can't forget you?

Oh, why, oh, why, oh, why?
Baby, why, oh, why can't I forget you, forget you?
Oh, why, oh, why, oh, why?
Baby, why, oh, why can't I forget you, can't forget you?

Because echos of you all around me, woah-oh-oh
Memories, memories that I can't erase
(Can't erase, can't erase) Woah-oh-oh

I have seen the writings on the wall
Telling me this time you're really gone
Thinking about you doesn't help at all, oh-ooh, oh-ooh

Oh, why, oh, why, oh, why?
Baby, why, oh, why can't I forget you, forget you?
Oh, why, oh, why, oh, why?
Baby, why, oh, why can't I forget you, can't forget you?
Oh, why, oh, why, oh, why?
Baby, why, oh, why can't I forget you, forget you?
Oh, why, oh, why, oh, why?
Baby, why, oh, why can't I forget you, can't forget you?

You're all I'm thinking of
It's such a lonely world
Oh, why, oh, why, oh, why?
Baby, why, oh, why can't I forget you, can't forget you?
