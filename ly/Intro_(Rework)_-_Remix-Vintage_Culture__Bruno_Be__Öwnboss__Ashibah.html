		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me tell you, ooh, you know
Aah, I need a miracle
It's more than physical
What I need to feel from you
I need a miracle

I need a miracle
Let me tell you, ooh, you know
Aah, I need a miracle
It's more than physical
What I need to feel from you
Let me tell you, ooh, you know
Aah, I need a miracle
It's more than physical
What I need to feel it from you
I need a miracle

I need a miracle

I need a miracle

I need a miracle

Tell me that you understand
And you'll take me as I am
You'll always be the one to give me everything
Just when I thought no one cared
You're the answer to my prayer
You lift my spirits high
Come on and rescue me

Let me tell you, ooh, you know
Aah, I need a miracle
It's more than physical
What I need to feel from you
I need a miracle
I need a miracle
I need a miracle
I need a miracle
Miracle, miracle, miracle, miracle
Mirac-mirac-mirac-mirac
I need a miracle

I need a miracle

Let me tell you, ooh, you know
Aah, I need a miracle
It's more than physical
What I need to feel it from you

Let me tell you, ooh, you know
Aah, I need a miracle
It's more than physical
What I need to feel it from you

I need a miracle
