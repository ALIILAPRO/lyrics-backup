		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When everything turns to black
You don't know where to go
You need something
To justify your soul

Silence is broken
Confidence is gone
Everything you're holding on to falls

All the people selling truths
On every corner now
The wait until the fear
Has knocked you down

All the rules are changing now
You're living in sin
Everything around you is caving in
All you're holding on to
Slipping like water through your hands

And you sing
La la la la
La la la la
La la la la
Ya you sing
La la la la
La la la la
La la la la

Far off in the distance
Somewhere you can't see
Allegiances have formed your destiny
Opposition all around
Feeding off your soul
Trying hard to swallow up you whole
And the demons all around you waiting
For you to sell your soul

They're singing
La la la la
La la la la
La la la la
They're singing
La la la la
La la la la
La la la la

Oh la la la la la
Oh la la la la la
