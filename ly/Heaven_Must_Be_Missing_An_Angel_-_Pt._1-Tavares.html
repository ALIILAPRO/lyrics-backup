		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heaven must be missin' an angel
Missin' one angel, child
'Cause you're here with me right now
Your love is heavenly, baby
Heavenly to me, baby

Your kiss, filled with tenderness
I want all I can get 
Of your sexiness
Showers, your love comes in showers
And every hour on the hour
You let me feel your loving power

There's a rainbow over my shoulder
When you came, my cup runneth over
You gave me your heavenly love
And if one night you hear crying from above

It's 'cause heaven must be missin' an angel
Missin' one angel, child
'Cause you're here with me right now
Your love is heavenly, baby
Heavenly to me, baby

Ooh, heaven (heaven)
Ooh, heaven (heaven)
Ooh, heaven (heaven)
Heaven (heaven)

Ooh, I'm captured by your spell
You're different, girl, I can tell
When you're layin' on my pillow, baby
Above your pretty head
There's a halo, that's why I know

Heaven must be missin' an angel
Missin' one angel, child
'Cause you're here with me right now
Oh, your love is heavenly, baby
Heavenly to me, baby

Ooh, my sweet little angel (heaven)
My pretty little angel (heaven)
I love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, baby (heaven)
Say it right now (heaven)

Ooh, heaven (heaven)
Must be missing an angel (heaven)
Missing one angel, child (heaven)
'Cause you're here with me right now (heaven)

Oh, my heaven (heaven)
Missin' an angel (heaven, heaven, heaven)

You must have slipped away
Along the Milky Way
It's 'cause your kiss
Your kiss, filled with tenderness

You came, see O D
On a moonbeam straight to me
Just like showers

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Your heavenly power gets stronger by the hour
Heaven, must be missin' an angel
I'm captured by your spell
Oh, girl, can't you tell
Heaven, heaven, must be missin' an angel

Heaven (heaven)
Heaven (heaven)
Heaven (heaven)
Heaven (heaven)
Ooh, so so good
So so good, so so good, baby

It's just so good, so good, so good
It's just so good, so good, so good (I love the way you move, I love the way you groove)

It's just so good, so good, so good
It's just so good, so good, so good (just like heaven, oh, baby)

It's just so good, so good, so good (heaven, yeah)

Heaven, heaven (talkin' 'bout heaven, yeah)
Heaven, heaven (ooh, my heaven)
Heaven, heaven (ooh, your love is so good)
Heaven, heaven (oh, baby, got to have my love, yeah)
Heaven, heaven (need it bad, Lord, baby, yeah)

Heaven, heaven (I got to have my love, yeah)
Heaven, heaven (sit down, gonna sit down)
Heaven, heaven
