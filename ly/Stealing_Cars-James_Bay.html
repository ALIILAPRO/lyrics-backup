		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All we need is a spark
A second chance, a lifeline
Waiting up in the dark
Holding up for a search light

No I don't know why seasons change
Or how we fell so far
Before our hearts go up in flames
Let's go throwing stones
And stealing cars

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Let the heat of the sun
Reignite your memory
'Cause if we just turn and run
Let them fire the gun

No I don't know why seasons change
Or how we fell so far
Before our hearts go up in flames
Let's go throwing stones
And stealing cars

Sirens and smoke remind us
Maybe the world won't find us
Fall to the Earth in red light 'til it's gone (ooh)
Gone (ooh)

Ooh, ooh, ooh
No I don't know why seasons change
How we get back to the start
Before our hearts go up in flames
Let's go throwing stones
And stealing cars
Oh, let's go throwing stones
And stealing cars, yeah

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh tonight these streets are ours to roam (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh tonight these streets are ours to roam
