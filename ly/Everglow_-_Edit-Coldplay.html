		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, they say people come
They say people go
This particular diamond was extra special
And though you might be gone, and the world may not know
Still I see you, celestial
And I should but I can't let you go

But when I'm cold, I'm cold
Yeah, when I'm cold
Cold
There's a light that you give me when I'm in shadow
There's a feelin' within me, an everglow

Like brothers in blood or sisters who ride
Yeah, we swore on that night we'd be friends 'til we die
But the changin' of winds, and the way waters flow
Life is short as the falling of snow
And I'm gonna miss you, I know

But when I'm cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
I know you're always with me and the way you will show
And you're with me wherever I go
And you give me this feelin', this everglow

Oh, what I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Because I live for this feelin', this everglow

So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh, the light that you gave me will everglow
