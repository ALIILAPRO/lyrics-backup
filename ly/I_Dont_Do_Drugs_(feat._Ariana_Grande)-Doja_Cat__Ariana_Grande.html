		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know you got me fucked up
Got me on stuck, chasing that rush
Had to give in, couldn't give up
I just want you but I don't do drugs

Still I want you, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
All I want is you, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh

Baby, I've been in my bag
You don't really hit me back
'Cause I feel like I'm attached
Should've never kissed you back
Ever since I fell in love
Not quite like being trapped
More like a sickness that
Keeps me addicted bad

Hard for me to let you go (let you go, let you go)
My body wouldn't let me hide it (hide it)
No matter what, I wouldn't fold (wouldn't fold, wouldn't fold)
Fightin' through the thunder, lightning

(Oh)
Forgive me, I brought it upon myself
(Oh)
Needed a fix of you, not just a kiss from you
I needed more

You know you got me fucked up
Got me on stuck, chasing that rush
Had to give in, couldn't give up
I just want you, but I don't do drugs

Still I want you, ooh-ooh (all I want is my baby)
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh (all I want is my baby)
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh (all I want is my baby)
(My baby, my baby)
All I want is you, ooh-ooh (all I want is my baby)
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh (all I want is my baby)
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh (all I want is my baby)
(My baby, my baby)

Tryna stay in my lane
I should play on the safe side
But you fuckin' me up on this FaceTime
Faded, pouring all over you
Know exactly what I wanna do
So baby, can you eat it from the back?
Got me purring like I'm Doja Cat
Keep me in your bag 'cause you wanna hear me say I'm coming back
But this time I want some more, just make it last, ooh-whoa

(Ah)
It's hard for me to let you go (let you go)
My body wouldn't let me hide it
No matter what, I wouldn't fold (wouldn't fold)
Ridin' through the thunder, lightning

(Oh)
Forgive me, I brought it upon myself
(Oh)
Needed a fix of you, not just a kiss from you
I needed more

You know you got me fucked up
Got me on stuck, chasing that rush
Had to give in, couldn't give up (I couldn't give up)
I just want you but I don't do drugs

Still I want you, ooh-ooh 
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh (all I want is you, baby)
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh (all I want is you, oh)
All I want is you, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh (all I really want is you)
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh (yeah)
