		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lately I've been thinking about
Times when we loved too much
I want you back too bad

Can we talk, cause I'm falling inside again
Drowning and drowning in
Cause I (ah I, ah I)

I'm not escaping from your love game
I chose your cold hands and
You chose my brain
Oh that's not working like we used to say
Cause sometimes you're annoying but
I still wanna stay

We live like that
We love like that we play like that

We keep slamming doors making love so so bad
We are going backwards turning upside down
Till the music plays to my heartbeat sound

Promise me we will lose our
Minds together every night
Promise me we will lose our
Way together through the dark

We live like that we love like that
We play like that

We keep slamming doors making love so so bad
We are going backwards turning upside down
Till the music plays to my heartbeat sound

How can we feel the same
How can we feel this way
Baby tell me why we go over and over
Upside down to my heartbeat sound

To my heartbeat sound upside down (yeah)
To my heartbeat sound
