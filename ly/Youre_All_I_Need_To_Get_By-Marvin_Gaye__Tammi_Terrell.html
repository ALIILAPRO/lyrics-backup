		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You're all I need to get by, ah)
(You're all I need to get by, ah)

Like sweet morning dew
I took one look at you
And it was plain to see
You were my destiny

With arms open wide
I threw away my pride
I'll sacrifice for you
Dedicate my life for you (oh)
I will go where you lead (come on, baby)
Always there in time of need (oh, oh)

And when I lose my will
You'll be there to push me up the hill

There's no, no looking back for us
We got love sure 'nough, that's enough
You're all, you're all I need to get by

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Tammi, listen

Like an eagle protects his nest
For you, I'll do my best
Stand by you like a tree
And dare anybody to try and move me

Darling, in you I found
Strength where I was torn down
Don't know what's in store
But together we can open any door (oh, baby)
Just to do what's good for you (come on, darling)
And inspire you a little higher (oh)
I know you can make a man
Out of the soul that didn't have a goal

'Cause we, we got the right foundation
And with love and determination
You're all, you're all I want to strive for and do a little more
You're all, all the joys under the sun wrapped up into one
You're all, you're all I need
You're all I need, you're all I need to get by (oh)

Oh, baby, oh, baby
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, yeah
I need you, darling
Oh, I need you (you're all, all I need)
All your love, oh, ho-ho-ho-ho
I love you, darling (oh, baby)
All I need (you're all I need)
I need your love (you're all I want)
Oh, all your love now (oh, yeah)
