		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got my shades on
Like I'm rocking Barbados
All night
To get you out my mind now, baby
Taking my jeans off
But I'm keeping my shades on
All night (all night)
To keep you out my sight now, baby
Picture perfect pictures
And I'm looking like I just got laid
Got the sunshine on my face
Starting up a party
On the pavement like I just got paid
And it's alright

I got my shades on
Like I'm rocking Barbados
All night
And everybody thinks I'm high
Taking my jeans off
But I'm keeping my shades on
All night
And everybody's blind

'Cause I look so cool like this
And I feel so good like this
Got me feeling brand new like this
You know
'Cause I look so cool like this
And I feel so good like this
Got me feeling brand new like this
You know

Let's talk about that face
He got the big blue eyes and all that bass
Oh father, let me pray
'Cause I won't see another woman like this for a day
I'm like "Oh boy, look at that ass"
"Oh boy, look at that ass"
Get your eyes up to my face
'Cause I see right through your shades

I got my shades on
Like I'm rocking Barbados
All night
And everybody thinks I'm high
Taking my jeans off
But I'm keeping my shades on
All night
And everybody's blind

'Cause I look so cool like this
And I feel so good like this
Got me feeling brand new like this
You know
'Cause I look so cool like this
And I feel so good like this
Got me feeling brand new like this
You know

I oh I oh oh I oh oh I
I got my shades on
I got my shades on all night

I got my shades on
Like I'm rocking Barbados all night
And everybody thinks I'm high
Taking my jeans off
But I'm keeping my shades on all night
And everybody's blind

'Cause I look so cool like this
And I feel so good like this
Got me feeling brand new like this
You know
'Cause I look so cool like this
And I feel so good like this
Got me feeling brand new like this
You know
Uh-oh
