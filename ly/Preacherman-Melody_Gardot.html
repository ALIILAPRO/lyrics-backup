		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh
Ooh

Preacher man, go tell me
Where his body lies
Sitting down by the river, now, child
Left him there to die

One by one we tumble
One by one we fall
If I had a solution, now, honey
I would fix us all

'Cause I believe in a world
Where we all belong
And I'm so tired of seein'
Every good man gone

Take me to that river
Lay me by his side
Let the water wash me clean, now, honey
Man, don't stole my pride

I have seen the darkness
Lord knows I've seen the light
Don't recall the Lord
Sayin' there's a difference
If you're black or white

'Cause I believe in a world
Where we all belong
And I'm so tired of seein'
Every good man gone

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
