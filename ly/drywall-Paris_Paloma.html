		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He's punching walls again, cohesive arguments evade him
Eggshell temperament, no emotional regulation
Hysterical baby, his gaze always evades me
Doesn't know he is paving the road for my escape way every time
I scratch another line

I used to think of him a caring thing, knuckles on his drywall
I've tried all of the parenting
Descent into hysterically, ripping into ribbons
The things he knows he isn't and severing ties

Funny rationality, what would positions in power be?
Led by feelings that seemingly change hourly
I am floored you ever got there
And when he snaps out of it
He drones in monotone, on a power trip
With tell-tale blood still running in his coward lips
From raising strokes that he hopes I'll cower in

I used to think of him a caring thing, knuckles on his drywall
I've tried all of the parenting
Descent into hysterically, ripping into ribbons
The things he knows he isn't and severing ties

Never making good on silent threats
So that he knows that I have nothing
Never making good on silent threats
So that he knows that I have nothing
Never making good on silent threats
So that he knows that I have nothing
Never making good on silent threats
So that he knows that I have nothing
Never making good on silent threats
So that he knows that I have nothing
Never making good on silent threats
So that he knows that I have nothing
Never making good on silent threats
So that he knows that I have nothing
Oh, but he has nothing

I used to think of him a caring thing, knuckles on his drywall
I've tried all of the parenting
Descent into hysterically, ripping into ribbons
The things he knows he isn't and severing ties

I'm severing ties
Severing ties
