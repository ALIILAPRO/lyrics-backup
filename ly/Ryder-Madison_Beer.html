		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Grew up in the same house
So I know why you lash out
Oh, I understand you
More than you think I do
Cracks in the windows
Castles and pillows
And all of the places
I built us to hide

I always left you out
You still loved me somehow
You just wanted a friend
Didn't know it then, but now I do
Our youth down the drain
And I'll take all of the blame
For all of the countless
Times that you cried

Just two kids caught in the crossfire
Close your eyes, I know you're so tired
Just kids, you and I, I know it's hard sometimes
But you'll be alright, and we'll be alright

All that's unspoken
All the years that were stolen
You are still in that house
I shouldn't have left you behind
And I fall to pieces
Sometimes all you need is
A shoulder to cry
And I'm lucky that you're mine

Just two kids caught in the crossfire
Close your eyes, I know you're so tired
Just kids, you and I, I know it's hard sometimes
But you'll be alright, and we'll be alright

Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
We'll never change what time fades
Ah

Just two kids caught in the crossfire
Just close your eyes, I know you're so tired
Just kids, you and I, I know it's hard sometimes
But you'll be alright, and we'll be alright
