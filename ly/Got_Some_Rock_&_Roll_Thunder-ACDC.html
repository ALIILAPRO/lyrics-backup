		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I'm headin' on out
Down to a major town
I'm gettin' hungry, I'm gettin' mean
I'm gettin' down on easy street

Any luck I can find
I'm feelin' dust, I'm gettin' wild
I'm in town, ready to go
I be around and now ya getcha, now ya getcha

Some rock and roll thunder
Some rock and roll thunder
Yes

Hey hey hey

I been workin', deep and rolled
I get high on rock and roll
I get the beat, babe, on easy street
I don't get hang up, I got it made

Down on your luck
I'll turn you round, I'm here to help you
Show you what I've found
Tailor made for you, the party is town
I tailor made for you, come see me what I've found

I got some rock and roll thunder
I got some rock and roll thunder

Hey, hey, what do ya know?
I said feeling great and ready to roll
I got the rock and roll thunder
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey

I got some rock and roll thunder
Rock and roll thunder

Hey, hey, what do ya know?
I said feeling great and ready to roll
I got the rock and roll thunder
The rock and roll thunder
I said the rock and roll thunder
Rock and roll thunder
