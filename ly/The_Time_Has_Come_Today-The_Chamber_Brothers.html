Time has come today
Young hearts can go their way
Can't put it off another day
I don't care what others say
They say we don't listen anyway
Time has come today, hey

Oh
The room will change today (hey)
I have no place to stay (hey)
Thinking about the subway (hey)
My love has flown away (hey)
My tears have come and gone (hey)
Oh, my Lord, I have to run
I have no home (hey)
I have no home (hey)

Now the time has come (time)
No place to run (time)
I might get burned up by the sun (time)
But I'll have my fun (time)
I've been loved and put aside (time)
I've been crushed by tumbling tide (time)
And my soul has been psychedelicized (time)
(Time)
Now the time has come (time)
There are things to realize (time)

Time has come today (time)
Time has come today (time)

Time
Time
Time
Time
Yeah
