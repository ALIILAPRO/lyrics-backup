		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Summered words and lessons learned
An eternities walking you home
Feels like forever ago that I left you there bleeding
Wish I'd known it was more than a game
Oh lord, feels like love just can't hit me the same
But your eyes don't lie
Wouldn't have it any other way
And I don't mind
It's just another thing I heard you saying
Hold my hand
Take a step and make a stand
And I'll call you when it's over
And I'll call you when it's over
Throwing stones and broken bones
And the tears washing off in the rain
Oh come home oh come home
There's lies to be told
But I can't remember the way
Oh lord, I can hardly remember my name
But your eyes don't lie
Wouldn't have it any other way
And I don't mind
It's just another thing I heard you saying
Hold my hand
Take a step and make a stand
And I'll call you when it's over
And I'll call you when it's over
I was hoping you'd be holding
I was hoping you'd be bleeding
I was hoping you'd be death trapped by my side
I was hoping you'd be holding
I was hoping you'd be bleeding
I was hoping you'd be death trapped by my side
But you're eyes don't lie
Wouldn't have it any other way
And I don't mind
It's just another thing I heard you saying
Hold my hand
Take a step and make a stand
And I'll call you when it's over
And I'll call you when it's over
