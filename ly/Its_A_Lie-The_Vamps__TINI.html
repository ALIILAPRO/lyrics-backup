		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A man had never been so good with words
They come from my brain through my fingers
And onto the screens
Seems like a good idea to me
'Cause girl, I'm sure all you want to know 
Is that our song's playing on the radio at quarter past three
Seems like a good idea to me

And you call, so I answer
And you're mad, but there's laughter
Could we live, ever after?
Seems like a good idea to me

Ooh na na na na
Don't tell me you don't want me
'Cause I know it's a lie, lie, lie, lie
Go tell all of your girlfriends
That I was just a waste of time
You know you kinda like it, every time I catch you, right?
Don't tell me you don't want me
'Cause I know it's a lie, lie, lie, lie

Boy, I can't keep holding on this
And I'm kinda falling for your tricks
But before you go, it's only right I let you know
I heard your song playing out loud tonight
I rang but it fell by the wayside
By quarter past three
It seemed like a good idea to me

And you call, so I answer
And you're mad, but there's laughter
Could we live, ever after?
Seems like a good idea to me

Ooh na na na na
Don't tell me you don't want me
'Cause I know it's a lie, lie, lie, lie
Go tell all of your girlfriends
That I was just a waste of time
You know you kinda like it, every time I catch you, right?
Don't tell me you don't want me
'Cause I know it's a lie, lie, lie, lie

(Na na na na)
(Na na na na)
(Na na na na)

You're mine, all mine, all mine
From morning 'til the night
So why'd you even try?
'Cause I know it's a lie
You're mine, all mine, all mine
From morning 'til the night
So why'd you even try?

Ooh na na na na
Don't tell me you don't want me
'Cause I know it's a lie, lie, lie, lie
Go tell all of your girlfriends
That I was just a waste of time
You know you kinda like it, every time I catch you, right?
Don't tell me you don't want me
'Cause I know it's a lie, lie, lie, lie

You're mine, all mine, all mine
From morning 'til the night
So why'd you even try?
'Cause I know it's a lie
You're mine, all mine, all mine
From morning 'til the night
So why'd you even try?
'Cause I know it's a lie
