		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What shall I say
I fear you will betray me
How many ways
Can you prolong this tragedy
Who told you that I would be back
You came here to seize my freedom
I will send you falling slowly
To the earth I see below me

You never knew
With open arms I came to you
Judging me so safe to be with
Mistakes you made that you can't live with
What you get is what you need
When you watch the blood but you don't bleed
You make me feel like a masked delusion
A man whose life's became illusion
