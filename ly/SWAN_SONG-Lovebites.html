		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If this was the last day you could live on this earth
World you still go on, accusing someone for today
It's better to fail than not do anything at all
It is not the length, but depth of life that counts

Oh, brave soldier
Oh, gallant warrior
Valor to those who died in battle to Valhalla
Believe what's in your soul
For death will come to all
You shall rest peacefully in God's Heaven

Floating lotus
You are so graceful
Saintly and glorious
'Til the end of time
Floating lotus
You are so beautiful
Sing me your sweet song
The legend of the swan

If you've never hoped, you've never been though despair
Ignorance is bliss, it's easier to not care
You might think it's meaningless to sacrifice a life
Sometimes the life of one can save so many more

Oh, brave soldier
Oh, gallant warrior
Valor to those who died in battle to Valhalla
Believe what's in your soul
For death will come to all
You shall rest peacefully in God's Heaven

Floating lotus
You are so graceful
Saintly and glorious
Till the end of time
Floating lotus
You are so beautiful
Sing me your sweet song
The legend of the swan

Floating lotus
You are so graceful
Saintly and glorious
'Til the end of time
Floating lotus
You are so beautiful
Sing me your sweet song
The legend of the swan
