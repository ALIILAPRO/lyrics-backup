		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I would like to know
If your world is mine
I'll check your feed, your heart and your spine

And I find
3-storey open ears
On a straitjacket party
Inside:
An empty scrabble board
And a hat from Ed Hardy

Let me show you what I had in mind
I’m feeling like truth is a hologram,
We never never know what it was all about
All this time
Just a hologram

That's a hoax
He's a fag
And you're an infectious little brag
That's a sin
She's a lie
And we're all about to die

I would like to know
If your world is mine
I would like to know
If your world is mine

Let me show you what I had in mind
I’m feeling like truth is a hologram,
We never never know what it was all about

All this time
Just a hologram

Still four white ego kids
Sitting on their knees
Reality is burning
Gotta make it to the streets

Let's have a talk
And stretch it through the night
There's a million things to say
And a million things to hide

3-storey open ears
On a straitjacket party

And I would like to know
