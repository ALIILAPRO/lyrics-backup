		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you got the call that no one wants to have
Sick of hospitals, to paper over cracks
You weren't scared at all but never turned away
Well, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em all

Stop

Stop signs, run 'em
Bills, don't pay 'em
Who would care at all?
Burn your money
Ain't worth nothing on your curtain call

There'll be no bad days
There'll be no bad days
There'll be no bad days
You'll have no more bad days
When you're gone, gone
There'll be no bad days
You'll have no more bad days

So your future's lost
But they can't take your past
And you said no tears 'round here anymore
But I ain't crying
That's you crying
Well, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em all

'Cause there'll be no bad days
There'll be no bad days
There'll be no bad days
You'll have no more bad days
When you're gone, gone
There'll be no bad days
You'll have no more bad days

Stop

There'll be no bad days
There'll be no bad days
There'll be no bad days
You'll have no more bad days
When you're gone, gone
There'll be no bad days
You'll have no more bad days

No, no bad days
No bad days
Bad days
Gone, gone
There'll be no bad days
You'll have no more bad days
