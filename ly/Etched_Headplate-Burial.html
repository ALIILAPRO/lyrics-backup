		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "A hardcore
He's not setting out to hurt people
He's got a lot of love in him
And you know,
For his mother, his brother and his girlfriend
He actually, I think, wants to do the right thing
So its more a question of, will power and self discipline and
Circumstances."

Dark angel,
Fall from the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my heart
From being in love
And after all of the love [for you]
In my life

But it wasn't good enough for you
I can't take no more tears from my eyes
But it wasn't good enough for you
Then I can be an angel,
But it wasn't good enough for you
