		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everywhere I go, I bring the chaos
Just a little extra, that's a payoff
Seven days a week
I don't ever take a day off
Slip, daddy, don't, aye, aye, aye, oh
Everywhere I go, I bring the drama
Blame it on my ego or your karma
I know that you love it
I know that it's your nirvana
Slip, daddy, don't, aye, aye, aye, aye

Trouble is a puppy and I keep her close
That bitch follow everywhere I go
Keep you up on your tippy, tippy-toes
What's the forecast? Tornado

I don't give a damn if you're not at ease
This is not about you, it's all about me
Swallow your pride, fuck off and die
This is not about you, it's all about me

Everywhere I go, I bring the pleasure
Hurt yourself bad, you never felt better
Drip, drip, drown, if I get any wetter
Slip, daddy, don't, oh, oh, oh, aye

Trouble is a puppy and I keep her close
That bitch follow everywhere I go
Keep you up on your tippy, tippy-toes
What's the forecast? Tornado

I don't give a damn if you're not at ease
This is not about you, it's all about me
Swallow your pride, fuck off and die
This is not about you, it's all about me

Trouble is a puppy and I keep her close
That bitch follow everywhere I go
Keep you up on your tippy, tippy-toes
What's the forecast? Tornado

I don't give a damn if you're not at ease
This is not about you, it's all about me
Swallow your pride, fuck off and die
This is not about you, it's all about me
I don't give a damn if you're not at ease
This is not about you, it's all about me
Swallow your pride, fuck off and die
This is not about you, it's all about me
