		  Zombie, Zombie

I'm in love with a zombie
Can't keep his hands off me
I think he's looking at me
But he's looking right through me

You think you're so cool boy
Blood rushing through my veins now
Do you want me for my body
Do you want me for my brain, brain, brain, brain

I'm in love with a zombie (boy)
I'm in love with a zombie (boy)
I'm in love with a zombie (boy)
But his heart is so cold
I'm in love with a zombie (boy)
I'm in love with a zombie (boy)
I'm in love with a zombie (boy)
But his heart is so cold

Cold, cold, freezing, freezing
Got my heart beating, beating
Cold, cold, freezing, freezing
Got my heart beating, beating

I'm in love with a zombie
When he put his hands on me
Send chills through my body
But then he don't call me

And I know that he like me
Cause he chasing me nightly
And I want him to bite me
Cause i know I'm gonna like it, like it, like it, like it

I'm in love with a zombie (boy)
I'm in love with a zombie (boy)
I'm in love with a zombie (boy)
But his heart is so cold
I'm in love with a zombie (boy)
I'm in love with a zombie (boy)
I'm in love with a zombie (boy)
But his heart is so cold

Cold, cold, freezing, freezing
Got my heart beating, beating
Cold, cold, freezing, freezing
Got my heart beating, beating
Cold, cold, freezing, freezing
Got my heart beating, beating
Cold, cold, freezing, freezing
Got my heart beating, beating

Baby all I want is an answer
When I walk past ya
Why you gonna act like I'm Casper
Every boy wanna know, irresistible, kissable
But you think I'm the invisible girl

Keep it down low
We be creeping, freaking
Got me feeling so ah ah
Trying to keep cool, heart beating
You're heart's freezing
But I still want ya-a-a

I'm in love with a zombie (boy)
I'm in love with a zombie (boy)
I'm in love with a zombie (boy)
But his heart is so cold
I'm in love with a zombie (boy)
I'm in love with a zombie (boy)
I'm in love with a zombie (boy)
But his heart is so cold

Cold, cold, freezing, freezing
Cold, cold
Cold, cold, freezing, freezing
Cold, cold
