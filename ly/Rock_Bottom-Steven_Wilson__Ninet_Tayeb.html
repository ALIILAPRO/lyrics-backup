		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel it 
I feel it in my bones 
New life, the unknown 
New life, I will return 

Don't lose hope
Don't lose hope 
Don't lose hope

Stay alive
Stay alive 

I feel it 
I feel it in my bones 
New life, the unknown 
New life, I will return 

Don't lose hope
Don't lose hope 
Don't lose hope

Stay alive
Stay alive 

I feel it 
I feel it in my bones 
New life, the unknown 
New life, I will return 

Don't lose hope
Don't lose hope 
Don't lose hope

Stay alive
Stay alive 

And all you want to do is to fall 
Break apart 
Close your heart 
Surrender and let your bottom rock 
Break apart, break apart

Break apart
Break apart
Break apart
Break apart

Break apart (Don't lose hope)
Break apart (Don't lose hope)
Break apart (Don't lose hope)
Ah-ah

I feel it 
I feel it in my bones 
New life, the unknown 
New life, I'm coming home
