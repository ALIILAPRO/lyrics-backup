		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes it feels like you're my fucking enemy
(You've got your demons in play, you've got your demons)
Sometimes I fantasize that you will die instead of me
(You've got your demons in play, you've got your demons)
I could've loved you to death, but now I dance on your grave
(You've got your demons in play, you've got your demons)
I, I tried, but I can't erase it 

I watched you fucking him
Right then your life was over
Thought you were heaven-sent
Then everything went to hell
I watched you take him then
And I just stood there frozen
You killed what could have been
And everything went to hell

Sometimes it feels like you laugh at all my misery
(You've got your demons in play, you've got your demons)
Sometimes I'm paralyzed by my reckless jealousy
(You've got your demons in play, you've got your demons)
I could've loved you to death, but now I dance on your grave
(You've got your demons in play, you've got your demons)
I, I tried, but I can't erase it 

I watched you fucking him
Right then your life was over
Thought you were heaven-sent
Then everything went to hell
I watched you take him then
And I just stood there frozen
You killed what could have been
And everything went to hell

I watched you fucking him
Right then your life was over
Thought you were heaven-sent
Then everything went to hell
I watched you take him then
And I just stood there frozen
You killed what could have been
And everything went to hell
