		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Morning I woke up with the view of the moon
To untangle my shoulders
A sleepy balloon I'm celebrating
Making it through
Just making it through
And when I grow up
I wanna be like a tree
And change with the seasons
Helping people breathe but
All I've achieved lately is making it through
Just making it through

I froze on the side where you left me
To hold everything still worth protecting
I know now at the end of the ending
That just making it through is the lesson
Just making it through

I didn't know then
That out of ash and destruction
The ground will grow things
I was trying so hard to stay still, terrified that I killed something

I froze like the whole world was ending
Exposed hole in my own panic pretending
And I know now that we needed that ending
You were never gonna stay
And just making it through is okay

Time is supposed to run out, time is supposed to
Sun is supposed to go down, sun is supposed to
Like your mood, like your power, like your battery
Rise, fall, rise, life, death, life again
Sky, ground, sky, day, night, day again
Rise, fall, rise, life, death, life again
Sky, ground, sky

Light, dark, light again, light, dark, light again
Light, dark, light again, light, dark, light again
Light, dark, light again, light, dark, light again
Light, dark, light again, light, dark, light again
Light, dark, light again, light, dark, light again
Light, dark, light again, light, dark, light again
Light, dark, light again, light, dark, light again
Light, dark, light again, light, dark, light again
Light, dark, light again, light, dark, light again
Light, dark, light again, light, dark, light again
Light, dark, light again, light, dark, light again
Light, dark, light again, light, dark, light again
Light, dark, light again
