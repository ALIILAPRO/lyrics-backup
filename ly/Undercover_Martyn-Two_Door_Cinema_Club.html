		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And she spoke words that would melt in your hands
And she spoke words of wisdom

To the basement people, to the basement, many surprises await you
In the basement, people, in the basement

You hid there last time, you know we're gonna find you
Sick in the car seat, 'cause you're not up to going
Out on the main streets, completing your mission

You hid there last time, you know we're gonna find you
Sick in the car seat, 'cause you're not up to going
Out on the main streets, completing your mission

And she spoke words that would melt in your hands
And she spoke words of wisdom

To the basement people, to the basement, many surprises await you
In the basement, people, in the basement

You hid there last time, you know we're gonna find you
Sick in the car seat, 'cause you're not up to going
Out on the main streets, completing your mission

You hid there last time, you know we're gonna find you
Sick in the car seat, 'cause you're not up to going
Out on the main streets, completing your mission

You hid there last time, you know we're gonna find you
Sick in the car seat, 'cause you're not up to going
Out on the main streets, completing your mission

You hid there last time, you know we're gonna find you
Sick in the car seat, 'cause you're not up to going
Out on the main streets, completing your mission
