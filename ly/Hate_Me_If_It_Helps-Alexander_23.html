		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wonder if your therapist likes me
I guess it depends on how much of the truth you tell to her
And I wonder if your brother wants to fight me
Would he change his mind if he saw his big sister at her worst?

So tell your friends I'm evil, write songs that say I suck
And roll your eyes when people ask about us

You can hate me if it helps, make me out to be the villain
Say you're better by yourself, so it feels like your decision
You can tell 'em I'm the bad guy if it helps you sleep okay
Because all you want is closure, but there's nothin' left to say
So you can hate me if it helps
You can hate me if it helps

Do you wonder if I'm with someone new now?
If her clothes are in the drawer you used to take up in my room
Yeah, I bet you think I never think about
You anymore, and God, I wish that that were true

But I tell my friends I miss you, I write songs about how much
Yeah, I know we had our issues, so if you want

You can hate me if it helps, make me out to be the villain
Say you're better by yourself, so it feels like your decision
You can tell 'em I'm the bad guy if it helps you sleep okay
Because all you want is closure, but there's nothin' left to say
So you can hate me if it helps
You can hate me if it helps

I'm sorry I stayed up with you every night
For making you laugh when you wanted to cry
I'm sorry I paid for your SSRI's
For making you happy, I apologize
I'm sorry I put you in front of my friends
Yeah, my bad forgiving you for what you said
So go and be angry but you can't pretend
'Cause I know that you never would
'Cause I know that you never could
Yeah, I know

But you can hate me if it helps
Yeah, you can hate me if it helps
