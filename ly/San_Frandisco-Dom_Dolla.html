		  San Francisco, where's your disco?

San Francisco, where's your disco?

I was supposed to go out there for like a semester of college 
And I ended up never leaving
It's that energy on the dance floor 
That I think has, you know
Helped house music completely thrive from there
There's definitely like the leftover hippie vibes
From the '60s and '70s I think
Uh, it's just a great place to go out
There's something going on every night of the week
The people there are fun and just
Yeah, I love it

San Francisco, where's your disco?

(The hell is going on here?)

I first moved there in 1999
I was supposed to go out there for like a semester of college 
And I ended up never leaving
It's that energy on the dance floor 
That I think has, you know
Helped house music completely thrive from there
There's definitely like the leftover hippie vibes
From the '60s and '70s I think
Uh, it's just a great place to go out
There's something going on every night of the week
The people there are fun and just
Yeah, I love it

San Francisco, where's your disco? 
(Break)

San Francisco, where's your disco?
