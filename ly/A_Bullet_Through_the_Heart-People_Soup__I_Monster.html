		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well everything was going fine
It was so so right
We were with each other all the time
From day 'til night
From day 'til night

Ever since you went with him
You never show your face
You really must have fallen for his charms
Ever since you went with him
You're sleeping at his place
He really must have got into your heart

Bang bang
That magic sound
My heart went bang
And took me to the moon

Bang bang
That magic sound
My heart went bang
It was over much too soon

Last night things grew rather strange
When the moon was full
Then I swear he began to change

Have you heard from him today?
Is he still the same?
Did you get a picture on your phone?
Did you run away from him?
You must have been afraid
How did you survive this on your own?

Bang bang
I took him down
The gun went bang
A bullet through the heart

Bang bang
I took him down
The gun went bang
And now we are apart

Bang bang
I took him down
The gun went bang
A bullet through the heart

Bang bang
I took him down
The gun went bang
And now we are apart

Bang bang...
