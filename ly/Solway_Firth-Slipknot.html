		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Today, up on this hill
I'm counting all the killers
They sway as they swarm
A look of gluttons in their eyes
They mutter as the body loses warmth
They pick your bones like locks inside a tomb
And take great care to not take care of you

Here's an unexplainable one

Here's an unexplainable one

While I was learning to live
we all were living a lie
I guess you got what you wanted
So I will settle for a slaughterhouse soaked in blood and betrayal
It's always somebody else
somebody else was me
You want the real smile?
Or the one I used to practice not to feel like a failure?

I don't need you to do it for me
I don't need you to understand
I don't need you to hide it from me
I just want to feel like any other man
I won't show you the whole story
I won't show you the aftermath
I won't show you my allegory
Don't look away
Here's an unexplainable one

Here's an unexplainable one

Here's an unexplainable one

I'm not ahead of my time
I just drew the first breath
If I'm alive tomorrow
I will alleviate the pressure 
by cutting you out of me
I found my bottom line 
dead on the front lines
I know I'll never go home
So set fire to your ships and past regrets and be free

I don't need you to do it for me
I don't need you to understand
I don't need you to hide it from me
I just want to feel like any other man
I won't show you my whole story
I won't show you the aftermath
I won't show you my allegory
Don't look away
Here's an unexplainable one
What have you done?
What have you done?

Yeah

While I was learning to live
You taught me how to die
I guess I got what I wanted
Another needle in the back through purified scarification
It wasn't somebody else
You fucking did it to me
You want a real smile?
I haven't smiled in years
