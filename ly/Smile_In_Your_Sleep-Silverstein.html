		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I'm lying in your bed
Play the motions through my head
You know that I'm thinking, I'm thinking
And I have reasons to believe
That I'm not the only one you spend this time with
But I'll stay

You say,
You're weak, 
You won't let me down, 
You won't let me down
You lied,
Through your teeth, 
You smiled in your sleep, 
You smile in your sleep

When we met
You said that we were the same 
You know that we're different,
We're different
And all those time you promised me that
Everything would work out in the end 
You were gravely mistaken

You say, 
You're weak 
You won't let me down, 
You won't let me down
You lied,
Through your teeth
You smiled in your sleep, 
You smile in your sleep

You lied
You lied
You lied
You lied
You lied,
Through your teeth 
You won't let me down 
You lied, 
I deserve better then this

I dream of steel
Maroon and warm
Your end (Your end)
Your end (Your end)
You gasp for air

I'll see this through
I'll see through you
You're pale (You're pale)
You're pale (You're pale)
You're pale 
Blue eyes

When your lying in your bed,
Your eulogy's been read,
You know that it's fitting
You lied

You say 
Your weak 
You wont let me down 
You wont let me down 
You lied 
Through your teeth 
You smiled in your sleep 
You smile in your sleep

You smile
You smile
You smile
You smile
I deserve better than this
