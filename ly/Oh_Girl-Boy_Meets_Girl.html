		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, you hold in hand a diamond 
And left holds it tight 
And you hold in your hand our love 
You let it fall from the right 
I fell for the love and it cost me 
Another painful night 
This time I'm afraid you lost me 
And without a fight 

Girl it's so strange, now my life's rearranged 
How you want to say goodbye again- oh 
Girl it's so strange, how your feelings can change 
Are they real or they only pretend? 

Oh girl I don't need you, I never want to see you 
Do you understand? 
Oh girl I don't need you, I never want to see you 
Do you understand? 
Oh girl I don't need you, I never want to see you 
Do you understand? 

And now that you have my heart 
You walk away 
One thing we never learned is 
How to make love stay 
Love is a lethal weapon 
If you use it wrong 
You carry with you my affection 
But it's true we don't belong 

Girl it's so strange, now my life's rearranged 
How you want to say goodbye again- oh 
Girl it's so strange, how your feelings can change 
Are they real or they only pretend? 

Oh girl I don't need you, I never want to see you 
Do you understand? 
Oh girl I don't need you, I never want to see you 
Do you understand? 
Oh girl I don't need you, I never want to see you 
Do you understand? 

Oh girl I don't need you, I never want to see you 
Do you understand? 
Oh girl I don't need you, I never want to see you 
Do you understand? 

You hold in your hand a diamond 
And left held it tight 
Oh, you held in your hand our love 
It fell from the right 
In closing I remind you 
Don't be callous with a heart 
Love is just one step behind you, 
You'll wait for it if you're smart
