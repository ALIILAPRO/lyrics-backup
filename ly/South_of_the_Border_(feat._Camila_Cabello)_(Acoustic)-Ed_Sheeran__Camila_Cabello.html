		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She got the, mm, brown eyes, caramel thighs
Long hair, no wedding ring, hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way
And now I really wanna know your name
She got the, mm, white dress, but when she's wearin' less
Man, you know that she drives me crazy
The, mm, brown eyes, beautiful smile
You know I love watching you do your thing

I love her hips, curves, lips say the words
"Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
I kiss her, this love is like a dream

So join me in this bed that I'm in
And push up on me and sweat, darling
So I'm gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me

He got the, mm, green eyes, givin' me signs
That he really wants to know my name, hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way
And suddenly, I'm glad I came, ay!
Ven para acá quiero bailar, toma mi mano
Quiero sentir tu cuerpo en mi, estás temblando
Mm, green eyes, takin' your time
Now we know we'll never be the same

I love his lips 'cause he says the words
"Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
Don't wake up, this love is like a dream

So join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat, darling
So I'm gonna put my time in (time in)
I won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me

Flawless diamonds
In a green field near Buenos Aires
Until the sun's rising
We won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me, yeah, yeah

Uh
Yeah, yeah

So join me in this bed (this bed) that I'm in (that I'm in)
Push up on me and sweat, darling (oh)
So I'm gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Come south of the border, border
Come south of the border with me
Come south of the border, border
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
