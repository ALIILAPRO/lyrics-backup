		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you're ready
When you're ready
When you're ready
When you're ready

Let's meet each other anew
It breaks everything we thought we knew
Watch how the waves the come in
Crash down with force we feel again

When you're ready
Dive into my lagoon
Waters warm and blue

When you're ready
Dive into my lagoon
Waters warm and blue

Let's find a place to rest
It appears we welcome fear as a ghost
Watch how the ice melts thin
Oh my dear we're here to shed skin

When you're ready
Dive into my lagoon
Waters warm and blue

When you're ready
Dive into my lagoon
Waters warm and blue
