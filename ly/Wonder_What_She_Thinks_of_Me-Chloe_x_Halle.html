		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wonder what she thinks of me when you're coming home
I know that she smells my perfume under your cologne
I wonder what she thinks of me when you stay awake
After you make love to her, but I'm still on your brain

I'm not the jealous type, I like the other guys
I wish you all the best, I'll help you pick her dress
Then you can both go to Paris, you live in the lavish
I'm actually happy for you
So tell me, tell me, baby, all of this is crazy
You've done this before, so who are you to judge me, me?
It's never wrong when you're in love

I wonder what she thinks of me when she sees that mark
On your neck, oh, no, I didn't mean to got that far
I wonder what she thinks of me when she sees my name
On your phone screen, you drop everything just for me

You know behind the scenes you tell me everything
I know you don't forget how much you needed me?
And while you do enjoy Paris, your loving is careless
But it's not ever with me

So tell me, tell me, baby, I know this crazy
You've done this before, so who are you to judge me, me?
It's never wrong when you're in love

Tell me, tell me, baby, I know this dangerous
You've done this before, so who are you to judge me, me?
It's never wrong when you're in, you're in love

(Oh)
(Oh)
(Oh)
(Oh) Love

Tell me, tell me, baby, I know this dangerous
You've done this before, so who are you to judge me, me?
It's never wrong when you're in, you're in love

It's never wrong when it feels right
I'll hold you close and pretend you're mine
I'll be the sun against your skin
I'll be there when she's not listening

You can call me crazy, boy
Oh yeah, we'll both be crazy, boy
Tell me you love me, 'cause I just wanna be your baby
Well, that's the price I gotta pay
I wonder what she thinks of me
