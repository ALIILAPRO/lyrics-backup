		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Running on empty
Ploughing desolate lands
Well ran dry
Still we drown in the silence
While the blood runs from your hands
Poets and preachers
Left in the cold
Ain't no margin in
Feeding a family
From the farming of your soul
So sing yourself to sleep

Turn turn turn
World keeps a turning
Deal us scraps
From your silver spoon
Burn Burn Burn
Songs on the Fire
Carried on the smoke
To the Cheats and the Liars
Turn turn turn
World keeps a turning
Revolution
Coming through
Burn Burn Burn
Warmed by the pyre
Sing another song
For the Cheats and the Liars

The hardest of winters
Paralysed on pause
But how can we fight
When you keep us frozen
Fearing the invisible
Laughing at jesters
Who curse at your name
Rest in the sound
While the show shuts down
Smiling through your shame
So sing yourself to sleep

Turn turn turn
World keeps a turning
Deal us scraps
From your silver spoon
Burn Burn Burn
Songs on the Fire
Carried on the smoke
To the Cheats and the Liars
Turn turn turn
World keeps a turning
Revolution
Coming through
Burn Burn Burn
Warmed by the pyre
Sing another song
For the Cheats and the Liars
