		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm 24
And still ashamed
To say I'm broke
And awfully vain

I'm Rarely home
Cause when I am
I overthink

I'm almost famous and I already hate it
They just wanna see what I'm made of
Will you cover all my bruises with make up
Broken bones are all that I'm made of

Everybody wants to chase the dream
But they don't even know
What that means

Everybody wants a piece of me
Until they start to see
I'm struggling

All alone
I lost control
A couple miles down the road

All alone
I'll find my home
A couple miles down the road

All my days
They end the same
I take a hit to
Ignore the pain

Am I the one
Who needs to change
What's the difference anyways?

I'm Almost famous
They just wanna see what I'm made of
Will you cover all my bruises with makeup
Broken bones are all that I'm made of

Everybody wants to chase a dream
But they don't even know
What that means

Everybody wants a piece of me
Until they start to see
I'm struggling

All alone
I lost control
A couple miles down the road

All alone
I'll find my home
A couple miles down the road

Down the road
My broken bones
Will turn to stone
I'll find my home

Everybody wants to chase a dream
But they don't even know
What that means

Everybody wants a piece of me
Until they start to see
I'm struggling

All alone
I lost control
A couple miles down the road

All alone
I'll find my home
A couple miles down the road
