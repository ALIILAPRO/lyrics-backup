		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need to be cleansed
It's time to make amends
For all of the fun
The damage is done
And I feel diseased
I'm down on my knees
I need forgiveness
Someone to bear witness
To the goodness within
Beneath the sin
Although I may flirt 
With all kinds of dirt
To the point of disease
Now I want release
From all this decay
Take it away

And somewhere
There's someone who cares
With a heart of gold 
To have and to hold
