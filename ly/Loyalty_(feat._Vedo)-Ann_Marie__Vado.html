		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I got you, and you got me yeah yeah

If I got you, you got me
It don't matter what they say
They just wish that they could be the
One that's chillin' at your place
It ain't perfect but it's worth it
Every second of the day
Fuck this drama, count these commas, and
Get high as outer space, yeah
They gon' hate but that's
Okay, got no worries, girl we straight
'Bout my baby I don't play
Put any nigga in they place
It don't matter, we gon' fight, be my Bey
I'll be your Jay
Fuck that drama, on my mama
I'll pay what I gotta pay for loyalty

Boy be the one that I can call on
They sayin' that we ain't gon' make it
Well let's prove 'em wrong
Don't entertain these other niggas
You're the one I want
You and this money is the
Only thing I'm focused on
You're the only one
That get this pussy drippin' like
The month of May
If I got you baby then I know I'm straight
Remain honest and you know I do the same
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

If I got you, you got me
It don't matter what they say
They just wish that they could be the
One that's chillin' at your place
It ain't perfect but it's worth it
Every second of the day
Fuck this drama, count these commas, and
Get high as outer space, yeah
They gon' hate but that's
Okay, got no worries, girl we straight
'Bout my baby I don't play
Put any nigga in they place
It don't matter, we gon' fight, be my Bey
I'll be your Jay
Fuck that drama, on my mama
I'll pay what I gotta pay for loyalty

I need someone that's not gon' change on me
Promise if shit get hard you'll be
There through the rain for me
Someone to keep it real
And tell me how they feel
Give my all 'cause I know that you
Only get freaky for me, call and
Make sure that I eat, oh yeah
'Cause a nigga be busy sometimes, that
Shit be slippin' my mind, oh yeah
Make you better, get you wetter
Girl you know girl I got you
I'm gon' always keep you close
Aw yeah, catch you when you fall yeah
Pick up when you call, yeah
You deserve it all, yeah
When it's all said and done
Baby we'll be the ones that they clone
Girl I know

If I got you, you got me
It don't matter what they say
They just wish that they could be the
One that's chillin' at your place
It ain't perfect but it's worth it
Every second of the day
Fuck this drama, count these commas, and
Get high as outer space, yeah
They gon' hate but that's
Okay, got no worries, girl we straight
'Bout my baby I don't play
Put any nigga in they place
It don't matter, we gon' fight, be my Bey
I'll be your Jay
Fuck that drama, on my mama
I'll pay what I gotta pay for loyalty

If I got you, you got me
It don't matter what they say
They just wish that they could be the
One that's chillin' at your place
It ain't perfect but it's worth it
Every second of the day
Fuck this drama, count these commas, and
Get high as outer space, yeah
