		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Trying to let go, but you won't let me
So I'm closed off, hating all I see
Play the victim so carelessly
You're addicted to uncertainty

Uncertainty

You bring out the lowest that I have in me
I feel the chaos and the gravity
And I can't escape the bitterness, I can't change
You bring out the lowest that I have
Lowest that I have in me

Try to hold back all the anger
But it's a trigger and I can't relax
Losing focus on the things you lack
So you push me to the brink
And I don't know what is next

You bring out the lowest that I have in me
I feel the chaos and the gravity
And I can't escape the bitterness, I can't change
You bring out the lowest that I have
Lowest that I have in me

Lowest of low
I'm so fucking high

Sever all ties
I don't recognize what I've become
Thread is pulled, you've made an animal

You bring out the lowest that I have in me
I feel the chaos and the gravity
And I can't escape the bitterness, I can't change
You bring out the lowest that I have
Lowest that I have in me
Lowest that I have in me
