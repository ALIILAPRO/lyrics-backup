		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give her back shots 'til her back hurt (Back shots)
Thumb through the money 'til my hands hurt (Cash out)
Wanna go on a date? You gotta dance first (Yah, yah)
Take it to the paint, I gotta slam first (Yah, yah)
She be actin' stiff with the booty (On God)
Feelin' like I'm Biggie rockin' Coogi (On God)
Draco make you put up that lil' Uzi (On God)
I don't want no features, niggas groupies (Straight up)
Pass her to the gang, quarterback sneak (Quarterback sneak)
I was in my feelings, now it's, "Fuck Kiki" (Worried 'bout)
Let lil' Tip hit that bitch, on GP (Straight up)
Smokin' gas, nigga, I re-up at the BP

Five foot five (Five), she my ride or die (Die)
Never tell a lie (Lie), we like Bonnie and Clyde (Clyde)
Lookin' at her thigh (Thigh), like, "Do it come with rice?" (Rice)
She don't like FaceTime, she would rather Skype
But I'm out for the night (Straight up)
Out for the night (Straight up)
Out for the night (Straight up)
Out for the night (Straight up)
Yeah, I'm out for the night (On God)
Out for the night (On God)
Out for the night (On God)
Out for the night (On God)

Yeah, you workin' hard (Hard)
And I see you (I do)
And your bills late (Late)
And your rent due (Yeah)
And you never need a man to defend you (Straight up)
You already pissed off, on your menstrual (Straight up)
And you been through (Yeah)
'Cause he been through (Yeah)
You a star player (Yeah)
And he benched you (Yeah)
In your corner, I'd never go against you (On God)
Bought a foreign, now his friends wanna text you (Straight up)
You got off late (Late)
And you worked out (Worked)
You ain't stunt his baby mama 'cause she burnt out (Burnt)
You got rid of him and made sure that we worked out (Facts)
So I put a hunnid racks in your purse now (Racks)

Five foot five (Five), she my ride or die (Die)
Never tell a lie (Lie), we like Bonnie and Clyde (Clyde)
Lookin' at her thigh (Thigh), like, "Do it come with rice?" (Rice)
She don't like FaceTime, she would rather Skype
But I'm out for the night (Straight up)
Out for the night (Straight up)
Out for the night (Straight up)
Out for the night (Straight up)
Yeah, I'm out for the night (On God)
Out for the night (On God)
Out for the night (On God)
Out for the night (On God)
