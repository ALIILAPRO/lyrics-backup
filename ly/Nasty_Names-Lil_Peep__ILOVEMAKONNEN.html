		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Punk star)
Yeah, can you just leave me alone?
Since our love is gone
Nothing left to say
Since you walked away
Can you just leave me alone?
Since our love is gone
Nothing left to say
Since you walked away

I've been chasing love around
That I can't seem to find
Nothing but my heart on the ground
Each and every time
So, tell me, babe
Tell me what's the truth, 'cause
Spendin' my time with you
Tell me, babe
Tell me if you love me
When I'm with you, 'cause
I don't wanna play no games
And say no nasty names
I pictured my life with you
And then you changed the frame

(Punk star)
Yeah, can you just leave me alone?
Since our love is gone
Nothing left to say
Since you walked away
Can you just leave me alone?
Since our love is gone
Nothing left to say
Since you walked away

I don't wanna play these games
Saying these nasty names
I've been in a lonely place
I've been having lonely days
Come on, baby, ride the wave
Get the fuck out my face
Baby, I need my space
You know I need my space
I don't wanna play those games
Saying these nasty names
I've been in a lonely place
I've been having lonely days (punk star)

Yeah, can you just leave me alone? (Leave me alone)
Since our love is gone (our love is gone)
Nothing left to say (nothing left to say)
Since you walked away (you walked away)
Can you just leave me alone? (Just leave me alone)
Since our love is gone (our love is gone)
Nothing left to say (nothing left to say)
Since you walked away

Since our love is gone
I don't wanna play these games
Saying these nasty names
I've been in a lonely place
I've been in a foreign place
I've been having lonely days
I've been having lonely days
Lonely place
I've been having lonely days
I don't wanna play these games
Yeah
