		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do I have any breath pumping in my lungs? 
Is there even one little drop of red blood pushing through my veins? 

Tell me
I wanna know 
Tell me 

Well, if I'm standing here
Still alive and kicking
Then how could I just walk away and 
give back everything we've gained 
Tell me 
I wanna know 
Tell me 

Tell me 'cause I wonder why 
We'd allow a love to die 
cll we do is fuss and fight 
With emotions running high 
What we need is compromise 
With a piece of humble pie 
You don't need to duck and hide 
Look in my eyes

It takes you, you 
It takes me, me
cnd some hu, humility 
Yeah

Why can't we reconcile, tell me 
Why can't we reconcile?
I wanna know 
Why can't we reconcile, tell me 
Why can't we reconcile?

How did things get out of control? 
Why must living here together in this world be so hard

Tell me 
I wanna know
Tell me
Is there any possibility that you and me 
cre not as far apart as we might think we are? 

Tell me
Yeah, I wanna know 
I wanna know
Tell me 

Tell me can we all agree?
On a new philosophy 
People we forgot to be 
Stopping all the mockery
Grow a little olive tree 
Offer an apology 
Will you come and talk to me? 
Look in my eyes

It takes you, you 
It takes me, me
cnd some hu, humility 

Why can't we reconcile, tell me 
Why can't we reconcile?
I wanna know 
Why can't we reconcile, tell me 
Why can't we reconcile?

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Can we start all over please
Let me introduce myself again 
We could show a bit of empathy 
Even if we have to pretend, yeah

Why can't we reconcile, tell me 
Why can't we reconcile?
I wanna know 
Why can't we reconcile, why can't we?
Why can't we reconcile?

Why can't we reconcile?
Why can't we reconcile? 
I wanna know 
Why can't we reconcile?
Why can't we reconcile?

Yeah yeah yeah
Why can't we?
