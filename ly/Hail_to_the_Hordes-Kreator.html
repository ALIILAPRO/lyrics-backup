		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Build me a nation, a fountain of life
And let us be the voice
For what words cannot express
The failed, the outcasts
The sagacious and wise
Will form a bond, impeccable art
Crafted through aeons of time

If night will fall black shadows
Are taking our sight
We carry each other through the darkest
Moments in life, stronger than hate
Stronger than fear, stronger than all
We are one
Hail to the hordes
We are one
Hail to the hordes

Build me a nation, let's make a stand
Live our lives to the full, come let's walk
Hand in hand let us remember
What it once meant

To be no Untertan, no God and no government
If night will fall black shadows
Are taking our sight
We carry each other through the darkest
Moments in life, stronger than hate
Stronger than fear, stronger than all
We are one
Hail to the hordes
We are one
Hail to the hordes

If night will fall black shadows
Are taking our sight
We carry each other through the darkest
Moments of life, stronger than hate
Stronger than fear, stronger than all
We are one
Hail to the hordes
We are one
Hail to the hordes
