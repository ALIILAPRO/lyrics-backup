		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I turn back now
Would you understand?
That I'm a winding path
An idle hand

If if disappear
Could you just forget
That I'm an empty page
A silhouette?

Have I lost the plot
Of everything,
Thrown the punch 
Half-speed swing?

I want to recognize this world
For all it could become
I want to see all of the parts
As more than just their sum
I want to know all of your love
And all that it could be
An infinite blue and evergreen

But do you think about
The years that pass
I can't look away
Darling it happened so fast

Am I destined, now
To fade away
To lose myself
In palest grey?

Have I lost the plot
Of everything,
Thrown the punch 
Half-speed swing?
Did I take a breath
And waste it all,
Pull the cord
Before the fall?

Because I want to recognize this world
For all it could become
I want to see all of the parts
As more than just their sum
I want to know all of your love
And all that it could be
An infinite blue and evergreen

For I moment I could see 
The future
When I looked right in your eyes 
Now It's all that I can think about
Every time I turn away
I miss it
And darling I just canâ€™t run anymore

I want to recognize this world
For all it could become
I want to see all of the parts
As more than just their sum
I want to know all of your love
And all that it could be
An infinite blue and evergreen
