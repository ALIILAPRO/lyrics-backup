		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Someone told me long ago
They were gone before the storm
I know, it's been coming for sometime

Be it so, and so I say
Little rain and sun by day
I know, shining down like water

I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain
Coming down, down this day
Coming down, down this day

Yes for days and days before
So there's is rain and cold is hot
I know, in this place got all my found

Through the circles fast and slow
There for every moment goes
I know, I can't stop, I wonder

I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain
Coming down, down this day

I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain
Coming down, down this day
