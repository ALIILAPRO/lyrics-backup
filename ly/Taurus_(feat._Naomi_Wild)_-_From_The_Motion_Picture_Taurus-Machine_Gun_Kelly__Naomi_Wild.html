		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I seek you out, flay you alive
One more word and you won't survive

I didn't leave a letter on my desk saying goodbye
People think I left, even though I'm still here
Pressure made it's way through my chest to my heart
Like a spark does, fireworks on the new year
Burning me alive, life imitates art
There are flames on my arms tattooed right here
Bury me alive, disappear underground
Where they found me before I ever had this career, mm

I seek you out, flay you alive
One more word and you won't survive
And I'm not scared of your stolen power
I see right through you in the eye

I'm staring at a diamond knowing that they are forever
Even if my body isn't still around to wear 'em
Seats are only full at funerals and not the weddings
Only vows I made the other person couldn't share 'em
Know that I'm a monster like the one under the bedding
Afraid of having kids, I'm scared I'll be just like my parents
These are my decisions now this cross I gotta wear it
Self-inflicting these decisions here, I can no longer bear it, uh

I won't soothe your pain
I won't ease your strain

Look
I'm sick of sitting inside of this room 'cause every thought I got's negative
I'm sick of not being able to sleep and relying only on a sedative
I'm sick of hearing another voice telling me what to do in my head again
Psychiatrist said he's imaginary but I know he's real if I said he is
Fighting with myself, so I can't help that I'm competitive (yeah)
This movie is my life but I still remain uncredited (uh)
I don't care how big I get, I still remain unedited
I built this from the ground up, y'all just living it
Long hair, don't care, I'm not trimming it (ayy)
Fuck vanity, caught up in an image made by the internet
My insanity's imminent (uh)
All sharks I'm swimming with (uh)
What's hell, I've been in it
My happiness is bankrupt, but my credit card's unlimited
Fuck, yeah (I seek you out)
Find you just to remind you
That when you're born an anomaly
Nowadays it's probably gonna be harder to find you
Don't leave the past behind you
Don't forget all of the fans who ride
Go back and open up the catalog to my first songs that rewind you (uh)
Remember the things that drive you (yeah)
Remember the feeling of being alone in a home as a kid every night
With the struggle of having nobody to cry to
Growing up and having trust issues now to everyone I say bye to
Looking up at the sky I found a destination to fly to

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
