		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How you gonna hit me on the 'Gram though?
When you don't even answer my texts
Wasn't even tryna obsess
I just wanted to have sex
I'm too used to getting my way now
You got me all in my head
Wondering if you're up and
Wondering about me too

I'm upset, want me to feel a way and I felt it
And I can't help it
And I'm trying to help it

Uh, trust me, I'd like to turn off my feelings
Why the fuck am I feeling any type of feeling?

Anyway, anyway
Usually I run away, run away
This ain't even like me to be
All in my feelings

I'm frustrated
Usually I run away, run away
Promise it ain't like me to be
All in my feelings, no

Oh, yeah
Uh, listen

This must be some past life shit
The way you got me waiting 'round for ya
To answer me whenever you do you ya
The upper hand was always mine
All you, got me sippin' on Mescal
When I don't even drink at all
God, I know that you're up and ya
Still haven't called, uh

I'm upset (I'm upset)
Want me feel a way and I felt it
And I can't seem to help it (can't seem to help it)
Lord, please let me let it go, oh

Oh, I'm afraid (I'm afraid)
Of what it could mean when
I've lost the control and
I don't want it to mean anything

Anyway, usually I run away, run away
This ain't even like me to be
All in my feelings (all in my feelings, no)
I'm frustrated (frustrated)
Usually I run away, run away
This ain't even like me to be
All in my feelings, no

Don't wanna, don't wanna
Be in my, be in my feelings (uh)
Don't wanna, don't wanna
Be in my, be in my feelings

Anyway, anyway (anyway)
Usually I run away, run away
This ain't even like me to be
All in my feelings (all in my feelings)
I'm frustrated (frustrated)
Usually I run away, run away
Promise it ain't like me to be
All in my feelings, no

All in my feelings
All in my, all in my feelings, uh, yeah

I like my wall up to keep from falling
Can't be falling, keep my walls up
To keep from falling, can't be falling
Like my wall up to keep from falling, keep from falling
Keep my wall up to keep from falling, can't be falling

Now he answers my texts
As I'm writing a song about him
Man, fuck that dude
