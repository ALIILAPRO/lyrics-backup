		<p>
		  I sold bits, I sold raw
Press a brick, never fraud
Hit and miss, bet I score
Why he mad? He ain't sure

I sold bits, I sold raw
I sold hits, sold out tours
Press a brick, never fraud
Said I'll quit, just sold some more
Hit and miss, bet I score
Fuck your bitch when I want
Why he mad? He ain't sure
Different league, different dough
I sold bits, I sold raw
I sold hits, sold out tours
Press a brick, never fraud
Said I'll quit, just sold some more
Hit and miss, bet I score
Fuck your bitch when I want
Why he mad? He ain't sure
Different league, different dough

I'm from the hood, now I live in a mansion
These niggas are mad, I'm countin' these bags while I sit in a Phantom
Word to my jewellers, I spent quarter mill' on my wrist and medallion
They said I'm ugly and now I get money she thinks that I'm handsome
Touched down Dubai with the gang and we had a fun night
Went straight to the Louis V shop, from there we went Club White
Remember them days on the estate when we had to fight over nitties
Now it's tour dates and all these bitches ask me to sign on their titties
Won't see me in a club with no shank, fam I always bring my strally
Before I went jail I was sellin' Stardawg and bricks of Ammy
When I had no packs I had to take a trip to Cali
I ain't even bring no suitcase, I just brought a list of addys
They ain't trappin' like me, we ain't got the same quotes
If you ain't tryna buy a yacht next year, we ain't in the same boat
Niggas know I'm the plug, got bottom shelf and expensive weed
And I got mids, got bandos and dispensaries

I sold bits, I sold raw
I sold hits, sold out tours
Press a brick, never fraud
Said I'll quit, just sold some more
Hit and miss, bet I score
Fuck your bitch when I want
Why he mad? He ain't sure
Different league, different dough
I sold bits, I sold raw
I sold hits, sold out tours
Press a brick, never fraud
Said I'll quit, just sold some more
Hit and miss, bet I score
Fuck your bitch when I want
Why he mad? He ain't sure
Different league, different dough

Uh, I just left mummy's house
The runners down on my feet, two and a Q
Respect from my niggas up in the trap
If it weren't for rap I'd be in there too
The feds they hate me
They know I done some shavings bait, but left no clue
Brought a huntin' knife to war
Cah the three-eight never had no shoes
Told me she's leavin', why?
'Cause I'm a rapper wastin' her time
She hates when I'm up in DXB
'Cause she knows what I do in Dubai
I end up givin' them dick
I step in the club and never say, "Hi"
Then end up bussin' my nut
And book her a cab, I never said, "Bye"
Course I got money, you can tell by the rip in my jeans
I'm at an awards show with my niggas daydreamin' 'bout hittin' the fiends
I ride out sober, me and big homie pull up on the opps, drinkin' their lean
On road he was the baddest, went to jail now he on his deen
My niggas, they tell me to chill
Sayin' I spend too much on jackets
When it's time for guns I buy them, I think I spend too much on mashes
I buy waps but I'm into fashion, rather the Culli' than the Phantom
I got a couple hoes from Glasgow
They just wanna fuck on me and the mandem

I sold bits, I sold raw
I sold hits, sold out tours
Press a brick, never fraud
Said I'll quit, just sold some more
Hit and miss, bet I score
Fuck your bitch when I want
Why he mad? He ain't sure
Different league, different dough
I sold bits, I sold raw
I sold hits, sold out tours
Press a brick, never fraud
Said I'll quit, just sold some more
Hit and miss, bet I score
Fuck your bitch when I want
Why he mad? He ain't sure
Different league, different dough
