		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walk a long road with myself
No one by my side
Put out my hand and reach for help
But nobody saw my signs
Don't want wake up everyday I been trying
I put my face inside my hoodies just to stop all my crying
And I might say that I'm okay but I hope you know that I'm lying
I might just succumb to my thoughts, I think I'm tired of trying
In the spotlight and the lights, they best not dim
I done take so many L's I think it's time for me to win
Feelings come out of my brain and start to crawl throughout my skin
Gotta wipe away my tears because they're falling off my chin, yeah
I finna never take no L's
I don't like to talk to randoms so don't hit up on my cell, nah
You ain't ever seen this side of me I'm coming out my shell
If you talk to me you better watch your tone boy do not yell, nah
Back to the basics, wake up and go to sleep
Don't know who's my friend, I don't know if they even care for me
People always ditch me, I wonder when they're gonna leave
Hood over my head but the wind is blowing all on me
Sticks and stones may break my bones
Don't need friends, better off alone
Leave my side, you can fuck off and go
Got some snakes in the grass I think I need to mow
People say they ride or die but then they stab you in your back and leave
And that's why I don't trust what niggas say, no I can not believe
And now you know why I keep my circle small cus' people lie to me
I finna all watch out for all my brothers, go up finally
You a bitch boy, I could give less, don't give a fuck
You was cappin' on the gang so now we gotta come run it
Shots is gonna fucking shoot at you, yeah we gon let it bust
My bad nigga I'm so sorry didn't mean to cuss, sike
Walk a long road with myself
No one by my side
Put out my hand and reach for help
But nobody saw my signs
Don't want wake up everyday I been trying
I put my face inside my hoodies just to stop all my crying
And I might say that I'm okay but I hope you know that I'm lying
I might just succumb to my thoughts, I think I'm tired of trying
