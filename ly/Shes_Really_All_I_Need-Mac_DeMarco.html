		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Up out of bed at three
And I feel like I'm dying
But if she's there next to me
Then there's no use in crying
'Cause she's really all I need
It's true, my heart is flying
Life can be such a breeze
As long as it's just her and me

Don't bring me down, man
Wearing that frown, man, now
It's tryouts for my brain
Step into my frame now

I smell your arts degree
It's telling me I'm lazy
I'm working so I can eat
So keep that shit away from me
She's really all I need
And up until I'm dying
Life will be such a breeze
As long as it's just her and me

Don't bring me down, man
Wearing that frown, man, now
It's tryouts for my brain
Step into my frame now

Don't bring me down, man
Wearing that frown, man, now
It's tryouts for my brain
Step into my frame now
Don't bring me down, man
Wearing that frown, man, now
It's tryouts for my brain
Step into my frame now
