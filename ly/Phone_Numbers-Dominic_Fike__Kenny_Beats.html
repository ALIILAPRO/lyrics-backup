		  Can you break bread with me?
Break bread with me, break, break
Can you break bread with me?
Break bread with me
Woah, Kenny!

Why you not here with me?
Can you break bread with me?
Why you switch phone numbers like clothes?
Why you can't answer me? (Yeah)
'Cause I got more coming
Why you not here with me? (Why, why?)
Can you break bread with me? (Oh)
Why you switch phone numbers like clothes? (Uh)
Why you can't answer me? (Yeah, why?)
Because I got more coming

Yes, I flew my shawty from Florida to Hollywood
Thought some gold shit looked big on me
Got some goals, it's a list on me
Yellow bitch, I'm rich, I fuckin' roll you
The strippers and the stroll playin' tricks on me
The stones hittin' different
You supposed to be pissed at me (no!)
They from Tiffany (please)
Keep my name out your mouth like some wisdom teeth
And you wonder why, why I'm not there with you
I ain't answer my phone in so long

Why you not here with me?
Can you break bread with me?
Why you switch phone numbers like clothes?
Why you can't answer me? (Yeah)
'Cause I got more coming
Why you not here with me? (Why, why?)
Can you break bread with me?
Why you switch phone numbers like clothes?
Why you can't answer me? (Yeah, why?)
Because I got more coming

Can you break bread with me?
Break, break bread with me (yuh, okay)
Break, break, can you break bread with me?
Break bread with me (huh)
Can you break bread with me?

And yes, I moved lil' shawty from 'round me
She been all in my business as of late
I got rich so goddamn fast
They want this bread, can't catch a break
And yes, I know you're tired of hatin'
I'm tired of starin' at your face
And if a bitch retaliate, we can go tit for tat today
That's on my mama, that's on Big Sean
That's on lil' A from FLA
Out here in LA, tryna make shit shake
Tryna wrap this case (hoe!)
That's a whole 120k to the magistrate for my parents' sake
And you still talkin' 'bout sharing cake
Shut the fuck up

Why you not here with me?
Can you break bread with me?
Why you switch phone numbers like clothes?
Why you can't answer me? (Yeah)
'Cause I got more coming
Why you not here with me? (Why?)
Can you break bread with me? (Oh)
Why you switch phone numbers like clothes? (Uh)
Why you can't answer me? (Yeah)
'Cause I got more coming

Can you break bread with me?
Break, break bread with me (okay)
Break, break, can you break bread with me?
Break bread with me
