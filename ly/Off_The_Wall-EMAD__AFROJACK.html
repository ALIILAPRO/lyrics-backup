		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (verse)
Caught it in the city rushing through 
Upstream 
Are you with me 
Feel that

Caught it in the city rushing through 
Upstream are you
Are you with me 
Feel that

(build-up)
Make that m*********** go

(drop)
Move like this

Upstream are you
Are you with me 
Feel that

F**k that

Move like this

Upstream are you
Are you with me 
Feel that

(verse 2)
Down
Rain
Caught it in the city rushing through 
Upstream 
Are you with me 
Feel that


Upstream 
Are you with me 
Feel that


(build-up)
Make that m*********** go

(drop)
Move like this

Upstream are you
Are you with me 
Feel that

F**k that

Move like this

Upstream are you
Are you with me 
Feel that
