		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They exchanged a look 
An hour later her voice shook 
When her whispering died, she cried 
Never wants to recover, she cried 

Don't talk to me about love 
(yesterdays shatter, tomorrows don't matter)
Don't talk to me about love 
(yesterdays shatter, tomorrows don't matter) 

Since that gaze
Roaring by went her days 
When her whispering died, she cried 
Never wants to recover, she cried 

Don't talk to me about love 
(yesterdays shatter, tomorrows don't matter)
Don't talk to me about love 
(yesterdays shatter, tomorrows don't matter) 
Don't talk to me about love 
(yesterdays shatter, tomorrows don't matter) 

(yesterdays shatter, tomorrows don't matter) 
Don't talk, don't talk to me
(yesterdays shatter, tomorrows don't matter) 

Don't talk to me about love 
(yesterdays shatter, tomorrows don't matter)
Don't talk to me about love 
(yesterdays shatter, tomorrows don't matter)

It couldn't be that good, although they said it would 
Just couldn't be that good 

Don't talk to me about love 
(yesterdays shatter, tomorrows don't matter) 

Be that good 
It couldn't be that good, although they said it would 
Just couldn't be that good 

Be be be that good (*3 to fade)
