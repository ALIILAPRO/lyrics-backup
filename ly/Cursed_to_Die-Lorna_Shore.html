		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Creations emanating between these shifting sands
This universe is turning in the palm of my hands
I will eat the earthen clay exhaling breath of life
Behold the culmination of my regrets

Sentience
To err is human, to forgive divine
A blessing of life
Cursed to die

All will rise and fall, they're flesh and bone
My sins and resolve permeate their desires
I am absolved within their design
My legacy will live on
But is it enough to satisfy my legacy?

Millennia's of waiting
Countless years come to pass
Separated from Chronos
This is my domain
I'm the face of death, my image
This eternal sin
Molded from everything I hold within

Sentience
To err is human, to forgive divine
A blessing of life
Cursed to die

We play the same keys in different times
It's in our nature to die

Powerless to the forces outside of our reach
I am nothing but a man within a dream

All will rise and fall, they're flesh and bone
My sins and resolve permeate their desires

All will rise and fall, they're flesh and bone
My sins and resolve permeate their desires
I am absolved within their design
My legacy will live on

But is it enough to satisfy my legacy?
But it's not enough
It's never enough to satisfy my legacy
