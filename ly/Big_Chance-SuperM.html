		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya

You got your mother's eyes
And your daddy's temper
But I never mind
Being bitten by ya
We almost rolled the dice
Back in last December
Then we thought twice
But now I think about ya

I want a little bit more than nothing
And it might tear us apart
But it's you I'm tired of craving yeah

So love across my mind
But now I'm thinking thinking twice
Oh tell me do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya
Wanna make that big mistake big mistake
Do ya do ya oh

We were out last night
Counting bottles
And it crossed my mind
What's there to stop us
If I could hear you say
If I could hear you say
(Oh yeah yeah yeah)
I wouldn't hesitate
I wouldn't hesitate
(Oh yeah yeah yeah)

You wanna say you do but you don't
You wanna say you will but you won't
You wanna say you can but you can't
You fall to the pressure too many times (yeah)
Again and again, I hope you feel me understand

See I know you wanna ride with the kid (come on)
You wanna say hi with a kiss
You wanna say 'it's us to the end'
Come on over, do you or don't cha
Can't you see it's all in the plan girl

So love across my mind
But now I'm thinking thinking twice
Oh tell me do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya
Wanna make that big mistake big mistake
Do ya do ya oh

I want a little bit more than nothing
And it might tear us apart
But it's you I'm tired of craving yeah
So if I ask ask you
Oh let me ask ask you

Yo yo yo 'cause I don't wanna lose you (you)
Big mistakes the things that we could do (do)
We can go our separate ways if we choose to (choose to)
But that traffic is a hazard tryna move through

I'll say it over and over
Up and down roller coasters
We let it out with emotions
No need to cry out an ocean
'Cause if you ask me
I would say it's all for nothing
I'm in for something it's all love
Keep it a hundred, let me ask ya

Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya
So let me ask you
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya
Wanna make that big mistake

So love across my mind
But now I'm thinking thinking twice
Oh tell me do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya
Wanna make that big mistake, big mistake
Do ya do ya oh

Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya
Wanna make that big mistake, big mistake
Do ya do ya oh
