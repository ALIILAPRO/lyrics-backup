		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're back and forth, we're in and out
There ain't no faith, there's only doubt
When you lie just as much as you breathe
And all the shit you put me through
You cheated and you never told the truth
Now you're acting like a saint as you leave

You're a bitch and I'm an asshole
But baby, yeah, we both know
You ain't folding up your hands down on your knees

So don't don't say you'll pray for me
If you ain't gonna stay for me
Hell, even Heaven sees
That you're all to blame
Keep my name out your mouth
Don't act like you care about
Where I end up for now
'Cause I can't be saved
So don't say you'll pray for me
Don't say anything at all

Neither one of us got angel wings
There's too much fire 'tween you and me
So burn down this house while you leave

So don't don't say you'll pray for me
If you ain't gonna stay for me
Hell, even Heaven sees
That you're all to blame
Keep my name out your mouth
Don't act like you care about
Where I end up for now
'Cause I can't be saved
So don't say you'll pray for me
Don't say anything at all

You're a bitch and I'm an asshole
But baby, yeah, we both know
You ain't folding up your hands down on your knees

So don't say you'll pray for me
Hell, even Heaven sees
That you're all to blame
Keep my name out your mouth
Don't act like you care about
Where I end up for now
'Cause I can't be saved
So don't say you'll pray for me
Say nothing at all
