		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sanity, why must you make a fool of me?
You've been a friend to me, now I think that we're enemies, eh, eh

If I fall on my knees, I hear you laughing
If I call out your name, you don't come

No one home, but the void is loud (this must be the void)
Echoes around my empty house (this must be the void)
Sentences are slowing down
This must be the void they always talk about
This must be the void

Levity, fill me up, let me flow
I'll let you take care of me, you can help me let go

If I fall on my knees, I hear you laughing
If I call out your name, you don't come

No one home, but the void is loud (this must be the void)
Echoes around my empty house (this must be the void)
Sentences are slowing down
This must be the void they always talk about
No one home, but the void is loud (this must be the void)
Echoes around my empty house (this must be the void)
Sentences are slowing down
This must be the void they always talk about
This must be the void

Finally, I have arrived
Finally, I have arrived (and there is nothing to see)
Finally, I have arrived (and there is nothing to breathe)
Finally, I have arrived, arrived, arrived, arrived

No one home, but the void is loud (this must be the void)
Echoes around my empty house (this must be the void)
Sentences are slowing down
This must be the void they always talk about
This must be the void
No one home, but the void is loud (this must be the void)
Echoes around my empty house (this must be the void)
Sentences are slowing down
This must be the void they always talk about
This must be the void
