		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know where you're going but I'll meet you there
I can't blame you for leaving but it's still not fair
And when I don't know what to sing
I'd sing about you

Now I don't know what to do now that you're not here
I don't know how to love, don't know how to feel
But I don't want to believe

I'll believe in you
I'll believe in you

I'll believe in you

If all I can do
To keep her here with me
I'll remember you
Won't you remember me

If all I can do
To keep her here with me
I'll remember you
Won't you remember me

And when I don't know what to think
I'll think about you
