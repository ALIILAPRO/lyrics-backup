		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On stage rockin', I'm stir crazy
Coco flow like 1980s
Come, let's tell a drop lazy
None of that maybe energy (nah)
Energy
Energy

Just vibe
Votin' out forty-five
Don't get outta line (yeah)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Pick a side
Only double lines we cross is dollar signs (yeah)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (hold up) 
Wait, I hear you just got paid
Make it rain energy
She more Cancun, he more St. Tropez

Big wave in the room, the crowd gon' move
Look around everybody on mute
Look around it's me and my crew
Big energy

He was on stop mode, got froze 
Froze front page Vogue, no pose
Chat too much, full clip unload
That's that Kodak energy
Energy
Energy
Energy
Yeah, yeah

Gold links, raw denim
You know that we do it grande
You know that I'm gon' be extra
When that camera go pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop
Keep 'em waitin' like dot-dot-dot-dot-dot-dot
Ooh, la, la, la
That's the way them boys sound when I walk through the block-block-block
Then I Uzi that doozy, shot-shot-shot

We was chillin', mindin' our business
Poppin' our pain and champagne through the ceiling
Sippin' it up, flickin' it up
All this good energy got you all in your feelings, feelings
I'm crazy, I'm swearin'
I'm darin', your man starin'
I just entered the country with Derringers
'Cause them Karens just turned into terrorists

You was on stop mode, got froze 
Froze front page Vogue, no pose
Chat too much, full clip unload
That's that Kodak energy (go, let's go, let's go, let's go)
Energy
Energy (go, let's go, let's go, let's go)
Energy
Yeah, yeah
