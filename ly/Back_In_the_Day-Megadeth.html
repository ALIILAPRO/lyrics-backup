		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where were you when it happened?
Where could you be found?
Were you at the front of the stage?
Or in the underground

From SF out to Old Bridge
NY back to LA
The world of metal changed forever
Back in the day
Well that was back in the day

And if you weren't there
It doesn't matter anyway
Because you wouldn't understand
Live to die and die to play
Every day and place
Leave a path of metal 
Across the world from stage to stage
Well that was back in the day

And if you weren't there
It doesn't matter anyway
Because you wouldn't understand
In denim and leather
We were all part of one force
Knocked Rock and Roll on its ass
And put metal on the course

Higher!
Higher!
Higher!
Higher!

Back in the day
You weren't there
It doesn't mater 
Because you wouldn't understand
This is our way of life
A life that was born free
To follow orders how to live
Was never meant to be
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Peals of thunder, sheets of lighting

The power hits the stage
The music was exciting
The mania raged
On, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
We all had the fever
Our ears started to ring
Feeding this wildfire
Consuming everything

Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Metal's King back then
And still is this today
Others imitate or challenge
But it never goes away
On, oh-oh, oh-oh
