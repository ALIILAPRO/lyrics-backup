		  (Wake the town, tell the people)
(CHASETHEMONEY, CHASETHEMONEY)

You got me, got me workin' (ooh)
I hope it's worth it
You told me you're with him on purpose
You're doin' whatever to hurt me
Ooh, it ain't nobody can do it like you, yeah, nah, nah
Ooh, I need everything cool in the coupe like, yah-yah (oh, yeah)

Merry-go-round like a circus
I wanna buy a new Birkin
She wanna pop a new Perky

Elliantte on my body, diamonds hittin' (hittin')
It's hard to catch a vibe or go outside without you trippin' (vibe)
Got niggas tryna line me, I can't ride without my pistol (line)
I bought my bitch a Kelly crocodile, but not no lizard (hey, hey, hey)
Bringin' up the past, the shit I done done before (past)
Your feet all in the sand, I flew her to Cabo (sand)
Her friend got a lil' Benz, she wanted the Range Rove' (Rove')
I'm watchin' on your 'Gram, you givin' them angles
I'm payin' for it, you ain't never gotta stress about no landlord
You ain't never gotta ask me, "What you plan for?"
Private jet, we're puttin' stamps all on your passport
I got plans for it, leave your man for it

You got me, got me workin' (ooh)
I hope it's worth it
You told me you're with him on purpose
You're doin' whatever to hurt me
Ooh, it ain't nobody can do it like you, yeah, nah, nah
Ooh, I need everything cool in the coupe like, yah-yah

Merry-go-round like a circus
I wanna buy a new Birkin
She wanna pop a new Perky

You know you want me so why you be playin' for? (Why?)
The message sayin' delivered so what you delayin' for? (Hey)
You think I'm out fuckin' around, I'm in the studio (yo)
It's petty shit, tellin' your friends all the info
Now your heart cold, fuck around, buy you a mink coat
All your friends got on Chanel, only hoes squad goals (hey)
I'll go Narco, whack any nigga that seem close
It's a double R hearse, lil' mama, you seein' ghosts (ghosts)
I know you're tight with me, you know the type of nigga I am
I shoot it spitefully, I don't give a damn what they sayin'
You better fight for me, want me or you don't, tell the truth, don't be lyin' to me
Need you to be my peace 'cause these streets get grimy
See you with another nigga, I'll be damned
Better not catch him up in traffic, hope my gun don't jam
You better pick up when you can

(Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system)
(Zero)

You got me, got me workin' (ooh)
I hope it's worth it
You told me you're with him on purpose
You're doin' whatever to hurt me
Ooh, it ain't nobody can do it like you, yeah, nah, nah
Ooh, I need everything cool in the coupe like, yah-yah

Oh, it's him? Yeah
