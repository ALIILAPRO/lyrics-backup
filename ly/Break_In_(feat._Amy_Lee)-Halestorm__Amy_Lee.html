		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put your lighter in the air and lead me back home
When it's all said and done and follow where the air goes
I hear you night after night calling out my name
And I'm finding myself running to meet you
I didn't want to escape
From the bricks that I laid down

You are the only one
The only that sees me
That trusts me and believes me
You are the only one
The only one that knows me
And in the dark you show me
It's perfectly reckless
Damn you leave me defenseless
So break in
Break in

You let me fall apart without letting go
Then you pick up the pieces and you make me whole
I didn't want to escape
From the bricks that I laid down

You are the only one
The only that sees me
That trusts me and believes me
You are the only one
The only one that knows me
And in the dark you show me
It's perfectly reckless
Damn you leave me defenseless
So break in

And take everything I have
Until there is nothing left
Until it's just your voice in my head
And when the lights come on
You see me as I am
You're still inside me

You are the only one
The only that sees me
That trusts me and believes me
You are the only one
The only one that knows me
And in the dark you show me
It's perfectly reckless
Damn you leave me defenseless
So break in
Break in

Put your lighter in the air and lead me back home
