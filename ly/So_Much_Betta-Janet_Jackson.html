		  So much better, I'm for you
So, so much better, I'm for you

Tired of being number two (two)
I can do what she can't do (do)
So much better, I'm for you
So, so much better, I'm for you
So much better, I'm for you
So, so much better, I'm for you

Don't need another (no)
I can prove it
Just let me love you
Watch me do it
Believe in this
Make a wish
Come see your girl (girl)
I'll change your whole world

Tired of being number two

Don't need another (no)

Tired of being number two
I can do what she can't do
So much better, I'm for you
So, so much better, I'm for you
So much better, I'm for you
So, so much better, I'm for you (yeah)

I'm what you been missing (I'm what you been missing)
You might need to jump on this (come on, jump on this)

Might need (so, so much better, I'm for you)
To jump on this (come on, jump on this)
