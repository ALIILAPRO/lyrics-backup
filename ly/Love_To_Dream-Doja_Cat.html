		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know what you mean
You don't fuck with randoms
I got everything, everything but real love
I got in my head, I bet you could get me back out
Or you could leave me there 'cause

We just love to dream
In my fantasy, when you woke up, oh
It's not you, baby, it's just me
I don't believe what I just lost

I don't want to close my eyes
Nobody wants to fall (fall), after they did it all (all)
I wonder if I left my body there, would I
Die right in my sleep (sleep)? But in reality ('ty)
It could feel like anything is possible
When I hear you speak, it really drives it deep
Woke up in a sweat in the middle of the night
It's getting under my skin, baby
I won-wonder why I do

I know what you mean
You don't fuck with randoms
I got everything, everything but real love
I got in my head, I bet you could get me back out
Or you could leave me there 'cause

We just love to dream
In my fantasy, when you woke up, oh
It's not you, baby, it's just me
I don't believe what I just lost
(I say, I say)

And I say, "Ooh, stop it", ay
I look a little like 'Nashe, ay
You look a little exhausted, ay
We should say no to the party, ay (huh)
Take me home in the Bugatti, ay (yeah)
Hope you like a little tears, put it on his tea
Like your my yerba mate, ay
Jump in bed without my bonnet, ah (my bonnet)
Take a minute for the finer things (yeah)
I don't even want to sleep
You just want some weed, blow it in my china bang
I be havin' hella dreams
Wakin' up in sheets feelin' like a tidal wave
Hit me if you want it right away
If he hit me with the morning sex
Sure hit him with apologies
Kicks on him with a pile of J's
Bricks on him with a dick on him
Put a fit on him with the Prada shades
Pics on him and I ride away
(How much do you want it?) Twice a day
(Four times) on the holidays (yeah)
King come through, your dream's come true
And trust me you won't ever fall asleep

I know what you mean
You don't fuck with randoms
I got everything, everything but real love
I got in my head, I bet you could get me back out
Or you could leave me there 'cause (oh, baby, baby)

We just love to dream
In my fantasy, when you woke up, oh (oh, baby, baby)
It's not you, baby, it's just me
I don't believe what I just lost

Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na (ohh)
