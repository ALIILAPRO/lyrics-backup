		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I tried so many times
To be the one for you
On earth I'm done
Baby I'm done with you

Oh I looked around
I wanted to help but I'm blinded
Couldn't find a way
To make us happy
Oh I looked around
I wanted to help but I'm blinded
Couldn't find a way
To make us happy

I hold you tight and strong
Telling you I know
That it is wrong, so wrong, so wrong
On earth I'm done
Baby I'm done with you

Oh I looked around
I wanted to help but I'm blinded
Couldn't find a way
To make us happy
Oh I looked around
I wanted to help but I'm blinded
Couldn't find a way
To make us happy
