		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I came to stand tall
Stare down the barrel of a gun that's aiming
'Cause that's all it ever takes
To change something you know's worth changing

I came here to march with giants
To break myself of my own demons
A thousand feet below
See people that I know
I gave my own blood
To keep the peace before the flood

Oh lord
Take my soul
It's what I want
It's towering tall in my heart
It's towering tall
Confusion
Between good and evil

I don't look down or I will fall
Can't stop now so I keep climbing
And that's all I've ever known (woah)
To never know the bullet I am biting

But I came here to march with giants
To break myself of my own demons
To go where no one goes
To know what no one knows
To give my blood
To find the gold inside the mud

Oh lord
Take my soul
It's what I want
It's towering tall in my heart
It's towering tall
Confusion
Between good and evil

Oh lord
Take my soul
It's what I want
It's towering tall in my heart
It's towering tall
Confusion
Between good and evil

Woah
Confusion
Between good and evil
Woah
