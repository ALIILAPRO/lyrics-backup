		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say ev'ry man need protection
They say ev'ry man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection 
Some place so high above the wall
I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
Is a man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear him cry so loud
Calling out that he's been framed
I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

They say ev'rything can be replaced
Yet ev'ry distance is not near
So I remember ev'ry face
Of ev'ry man who put me here
I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
