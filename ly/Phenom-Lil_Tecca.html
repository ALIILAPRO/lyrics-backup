		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah, ah
Ah, yeah
Ah

I been solo for so long, yeah
I cannot go on
Been a long time since I'm feelin' right
All I know is wrong
And my fans, yeah, got me feelin' right
Always playin' my songs, yeah
Bitch niggas say they like gossip
Whole time I don't know, uh

Now, mud got me feelin' like a phenom
Went to the plug, I tell him need a read out
Drip to the floor, I told him, "Pick your feet up"
Real hot nigga, bitch, I gotta heat up
Real hot nigga, get up out the spot
Wanna take a flick when I step on the block
Star ring on my finger, baby, 'cause I know I'm gon' pop, ayy
All these niggas real still lately, like LeBron, they gon' flop, uh
I don't hear no haters lately 'cause a nigga on top, uh
It's my time, don't gotta watch, uh, to make a hit, bet a lot, uh
Let the heart turn rich, babe, if you want some, just say somethin'

I been solo for so long, yeah
I cannot go on
Been a long time since I'm feelin' right
All I know is wrong
And my fans, yeah, got me feelin' right
Always playin' my songs, yeah
Bitch niggas say they love the gossip
Whole time I don't know
I been solo for so long, yeah
I cannot go on
Been a long time since I'm feelin' right
All I know is wrong
And my fans, yeah, got me feelin' right
Always playin' my songs, yeah
Bitch niggas say they love the gossip
Whole time I don't know, uh

Rap, rap
I feel like Nav, I'ma tap, tap
You in my space, back back
Keyboard space, back back
You gon' regret if you lied
'Cause that might be the last time
We just caught that boy, he end quick like a Vine
I'm just talkin' shit, I don't care if I rhyme
I done just popped that Perc', yeah, that nigga, he flyin'
She say that I'm awesome
She say that she wanna blossom
Just left Barneys, went and bought some
Bust at an opp, yeah, he 'bout to flock some

Oh, that's your shit? Uh-uh
I don't care, uh-uh
Now it's mine, uh-uh
Now you tied, uh-uh
Oh, that's your shit? Uh-uh
I don't care, uh-uh
Now it's mine, uh-uh
Now you tied, uh-uh

I do this shit too easy (easy)
I swear this shit too easy (easy)
I know that nigga don't believe me (don't believe me)
Don't care if that nigga believe me
I can't see these niggas like Stevie (brrt)
Can't love that shawty, she a fifi
No, I don't show expressions, no, niggas can't read me, ayy
Wave, he just walked up in the buildin', 'bout to get up (get up, uh)
'Bout to get up, yeah, we rockin' orange sweater, uh (sweater)
Fuckin' bitches, yeah, that bitch, her name is Heather, uh (uh)
I get her wet, I think that I control the weather, uh

I been solo for so long, yeah
I cannot go on
Been a long time since I'm feelin' right
All I know is wrong
And my fans, yeah, got me feelin' right
Always playin' my songs, yeah
Bitch niggas say they like gossip
Whole time I don't know
I been solo for so long, yeah
I cannot go on
Been a long time since I'm feelin' right
All I know is wrong
And my fans, yeah, got me feelin' right
Always playin' my songs, yeah
Bitch niggas say they like gossip
Whole time I don't know, uh
