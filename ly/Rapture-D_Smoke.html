		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hmm

Imagine a day without women (women)
I bet your first thought was, "Who 'bout to take care of the children?" (Children)
That's just like us, placin' all of their value in rearin'
Lil' versions of our imperfect heart on the surface
Hard to work, we're soft at the core, won't explore past traumas
Just to make sure he could be a good father (yeah)
Imagine they missin' for starters (starters)
We stuck in predicament that we can't fix with our wallets
Now we must deal with our garbage, baggage
Imagine a world with no magic (no magic)
It must feel so apocalyptic (yeah)
Ain't no colder predicament (yeah)
Imagine God, said she sick of it
And took all our women

(This time we're gonna see, I'll save you
This time we're gonna see, I'll save you)
The rapture
(This time we're gonna see, I'll save you
This time we're gonna see, I'll save you)

Imagine a world with no flowers (oh)
Imagine all sand but no beach, no sweet only sour
No leaves on the trees, zero oxygen, I can't breathe, I believe
Heroes often wear moccasins 
Prophets, then prophesize of this day, ain't believe 'em
Just like a nigga that think she won't leave him
Blink of an eye, you went to the sky
I know you see him lookin' down, ain't you disappointed?
It took this for us to get the point and
Took a picture to disappear, missin' mornings
With you wakin' up next to me
Breakfast in bed, should've did that more regularly
Bacon and eggs, be the least we could to show you we appreciate you but it's too late
Heaven got you in your true state
Listen here to what the fool say when you're gone

(This time we're gonna see, I'll save you
This time we're gonna see, I'll save you)
The rapture
(This time we're gonna see, I'll save you
This time we're gonna see, I'll save you)

Imagine you was only dreamin' (yeah)
Imagine you wakin' up, holdin' and squeezin' the show
Wonder just how you feel in every moment
Knowin' that she could be gone and heaven's home to all of her children (yeah)
After that vision I'm willin' to listen
After that sentence to an existence without passion
I'd risk it all to give it all right back to our women
Can't turn our backs on our women
Do more than chill and relax on our women
Secure the bag, and invest the stash
Lil' boy boy be mad, can't place a tag
With a price on a life, with the right woman
Ike with the right, try to fight women
Die, nigga die if you strike women (yeah)
I question if you even like women (yeah)
Your breath could leave you in a second, nigga
Real niggas lay it down, protectin' women
Still recognize that I ain't perfect, got a dozen thanks to her
And cause stress for the women
God bless 'em
Life served me hard lessons (hard lessons)
Just keep in mind this season time ends
The womb is where all life begins, no world without women

(This time we're gonna see, I'll save you
This time we're gonna see, I'll save you
This time we're gonna see, I'll save you
This time we're gonna see, I'll save you
This time we're gonna see, I'll save you
This time we're gonna see, I'll save you
This time we're gonna see, I'll save you
This time we're gonna see, I'll save you
This time we're gonna see, I'll save you
This time we're gonna see, I'll save you
This time we're gonna see, I'll save you
This time we're gonna see, I'll save you
This time we're gonna see, I'll save you
This time we're gonna see, I'll save you
This time we're gonna see, I'll save you
This time we're gonna see, I'll save you
This time we're gonna see, I'll save you
This time we're gonna see, I'll save you
This time we're gonna see, I'll save you)
The rapture
(This time we're gonna see, I'll save you)
