		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The direction of the eye
So misleading
The defection of the soul
Nauseously quick
I don't question
Our existence
I just question
Our modern needs

I will walk, with my hands bound
I will walk, with my face blood
I will walk, with my shadow flag
Into your garden
Garden of stone

After all is done
And we're still alone
I won't be taken
Yet I'll go

With my hands bound
I will walk, with my face blood
I will walk, with my shadow flag
Into your garden
Garden of stone

I don't show
I don't share
I don't need
What you have to give, yeah

I will walk, with my hands bound
I will walk, with my face blood
I will walk, with my shadow flag
Into your garden
Garden of
I will walk, with my hands bound
I will walk, into your garden
Garden of stone
I don't know
I don't care
I don't need you for me to live
