		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Borderline, there she goes
On the left side
Merry-go-round people
Little white lies

I know that it's over, so where do we go?
Where do we go?
Oh, you know that I know that it's over
So where do we go? Where do we go? Oh

Don't let the heartbreak hit you on a Saturday night
Come meet me halfway in between dark and the light
'Cause the voice in my head said I ain't goin' back to my bed

I'm all right, outta line
Hold the door as I walk by
We can fly and watch the floor
As they live life

I know that it's over, so where do we go?
Where do we go?
Oh, you know that I know that it's over
So where do we go? Where do we go? Oh

Don't let the heartbreak hit you on a Saturday night
Come meet me halfway in between dark and the light
'Cause the voice in my head said I ain't goin' back to my bed

Don't let the heartbreak hit you on a Saturday night
Come meet me halfway in between dark and the light
'Cause the voice in my head said I ain't goin' back to my bed

How long will it close?
And there's a light behind the door

I know that it's over, so where do we go?
Where do we go?
Oh, you know that I know that it's over
So where do we go? Where do we go? Oh (oh, oh)

Don't let the heartbreak hit you on a Saturday night
Come meet me halfway in between dark and the light
'Cause the voice in my head said I ain't goin' back to my bed

Don't let the heartbreak hit you on a Saturday night
Come meet me halfway in between dark and the light
'Cause the voice in my head said I ain't goin' back to my bed
I'm all right
