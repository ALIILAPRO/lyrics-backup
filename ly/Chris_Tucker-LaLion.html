		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My Eruption ain't even up for discussion
Spitting out these bars when they hit your head a concussion
Vomit on the carpet your mama covered in onions
And honest I'm Jeffrey Dahmer I'll still be rubbing her bunions
Living just politicking I been feeling unusual
The bodies in my closet getting accustomed to new tools
The new fool
Feeling like I been killing the new school
The coup cool
But I just fucked your bitch in a Honda
I'm a
Sick fucker
I whip it with lips puckered
I'm ripping you chick butter
And love her like Chris Tucker
Just once and I rush the hour
I tower over these cowards
The power loud in my veins like I been on my sixth upper
Fucker
You aint listen when the wisdom appears
Little boy traded airpods for a dick in the ears
Sick of my peers
The realest of fears
Ouija board of you, contorted dude
Appears in the mirror saying

They been tryna get for a dollar and a penny
Man I feel like I'm Chris Tucker
Hiding from the Deebo mama sorry ima reload
Man I feel like I'm Chris Tucker
Money really talking when I'm paying for your coffin
Man I feel like I'm Chris Tucker
Do you understand all the words out my mouth
Man I feel like I'm Chris Tucker
Mother

Back up son call me dad I'm the maverick
Iverson with the braids and a bad bitch
Life lesson do not mess with a mammoth
Load my lungs with the breathe of a savage
Back up son about to cause you some damage
Nah not done I been had the advantage
Money talking wonder
Why I feel like I'm Chris Tucker
Mother

Feeling like a looney toon I been living in shambles
Yelling out like Hootie Hoo I been dropping these anvils
Preparation warning shots innovation and ammo
I been loaded waiting for someone test me like Rambo
Loaded with the opiates
Belly big as notorious
Lay my cards on the table just take a look I'm Exodia
All of you get up outa here
Cataclysm provoked
Fucking with me now is poking fun at the hulk
Pissed off
Living like I been given a rope
They talking to me
Like I'm on TV see we different with shows
I'm living it humble with the checks while you be flexing the gold
Lack of respect has got me sick of watching wannabes grows
Cost this drop diss, all you fake accomplish
Nonsense watch this, all we flex is progress
Lost bliss off this, working til I top best
Mosh pit top 6, what I aim with my spit

They been tryna get for a dollar and a penny
Man I feel like I'm Chris Tucker
Hiding from the Deebo mama sorry ima reload
Man I feel like I'm Chris Tucker
Money really talking when I'm paying for your coffin
Man I feel like I'm Chris Tucker
Do you understand all the words out my mouth
Man I feel like I'm Chris Tucker
Mother

Back up son call me dad I'm the maverick
Iverson with the braids and a bad bitch
Life lesson do not mess with a mammoth
Load my lungs with the breathe of a savage
Back up son about to cause you some damage
Nah not done I been had the advantage
Money talking wonder
Why I feel like I'm Chris Tucker
Mother
Fucker
