		<p>
		  Fuck the cost
Let me at least show you off
You want those Margiela kicks
Yeah, the world is all I'm tryna give
(To you, baby)

Yeah, the weed got us noddin' off
Roll another one, it's not enough
I like how we be in the cut
You like it when I'm rough
You say the dick, it got you stuck
And now my digits runnin' up 'round my ways

Sorry if I come across some type of way
I've been tryna get out of my ways
Know that it don't seem like I care, but you know I care
Took some time aside from my dogs, and I'm well aware
Bitch, I'm from the block (East side shit)
Hit my line if you ever lonely in the night time
I be workin', puttin' work in on my ends
On my ends

Yeah, the weed got us noddin' off
Roll another one, it's not enough
I like how we be in the cut
You like it when I'm rough
You say the dick, it got you stuck
And now my digits runnin' up round my ways
