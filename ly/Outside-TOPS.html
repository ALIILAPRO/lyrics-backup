		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Outside, you don't know why
We tell each other in the middle of the night
Talk about it like you really want to know
What she running 'round for?

Rat-tat, the door unlatch
Someone here to take you back
Outside in the middle of the street
Are you getting what you need?

Thoughts of you
Running through my mind
Open door but it doesn't feel right
You look at me as if you know what it's like
In the shadow of the streetlight

Now I know
I can't go back
You're with her and she doesn't deserve that
But when I look into your eyes
You see something I'm trying to hide

Thoughts of you
Running through my mind
Open door but it doesn't feel right
You look at me as if you know what it's like
In the shadow of the streetlight

Thoughts of you
Running through my mind
Open door but it doesn't feel right
You look at me as if you know what it's like
In the shadow of the streetlight
Shadow, why's it a shame for me to love?

In the shadow of the streetlight
In the shadow of the streetlight
In the shadow of the streetlight
In the shadow of the streetlight
