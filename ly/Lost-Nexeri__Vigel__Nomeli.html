		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm low, low, low, lost
I swear I will be better than I was
I thought that I was special
And we will be together
But I've never been so wrong
I'm low, low, low, lost
I swear I will be better than I was
I thought that I was special
And we will be together
But I've never been so wrong
And I'm low, low, low, lost
I swear I will be better than I was
I thought that I was special
And we will be together
But I've never been so wrong
Tell me was it worth it
My heavy heart is broken
But now you are tеlling me
That your eyes havе opened
Anyway, baby it's too much
And I feel just like a foolish lie
I have done with stupid losers
I'm low, low, low, lost
I swear I will be better than I was
I thought that I was special
And we will be together
But I've never been so wrong
I'm low, low, low, lost
I swear I will be better than I was
I thought that I was special
And we will be together
But I've never been so wrong
