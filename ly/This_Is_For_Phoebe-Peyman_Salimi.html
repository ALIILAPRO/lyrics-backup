		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's hard to find
Some peace of mind
I think about last year
You used to lie back there
On your favorite wall
So numb to feel
The shiver up my spine
I think about last year
Girl it felt so real
Thought we had it all
And when it rained
You'd come down
Making the face that we both knew well
But time
Took us down
The wind would burn your eyes
Couldn't tell if you were smiling
You were not one of us after all
But I loved you nevertheless
And when it rained
You'd come down
(Down)
Making the face that we both knew well
(Down)
But time
Took us down
I can't deny it
The fire you set up
Against the violence
Just breathe it in and out
I can't deny it
Relying on the facts
You can't be dying
I'll see you down the road
Don't wanna let it go
(Don't wanna let it go)
Don't wanna let it go
(Don't wanna let it go)
They say time will pass
And it will ease the pain
Still think about that year
When I was shattered by my own fears
Cause I don't know if time can help
Gonna play pretend just till the end
The wall witnessed it all
I can't deny it
The fire you set up
Against the violence
Just breathe it in and out
I can't deny it
Relying on the facts
You can't be dying
I'll see you down the road
I can't deny it
The fire you set up
Against the violence
Just breathe it in and out
I can't deny it
Relying on the facts
You can't be dying
I'll see you down the road
Don't wanna let it go
(Don't wanna let it go)
Don't wanna let it go
(Don't wanna let it go)
Oh
Oh
Cause I don't know if time can help
Gonna Play pretend just till the end
