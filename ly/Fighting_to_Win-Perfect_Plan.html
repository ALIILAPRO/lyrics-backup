		  Fighting To Win
Lyrics & Melodies: Kent Hilli Music: Kent Hilli, Rolf Nordström, Leif Ehlin, Fredrik Forsberg, Mats Byström

Sometimes you loose
And sometimes you pay
You're Living your hopes and dreams 
To make them true someday

All those Promises made
To have and to hold 
When the world turns down on you and life just seems so cold

Just the sound of your heart remains
If we learn how to break the chains 
We can settle the score and we'll know this is what we've been fighting for
This is the moment 
We learn to survive

So here i stand
It takes a man to change the world
Like the man i used to be
when we were young and wild and free
And we were fighting for our freedom
Never giving in
Theres one thing you should know
i'll be fighting to win

Sometimes its true
In hard times we pray
Were living for love it seems
To get us through someway

If those promises break 
And your life takes it's toll
Just live all your hopes and dreams and make it on your own

So here i stand
It takes a man to change the world
Like the man i used to be
when we were young and wild and free
And we were fighting for our freedom
Never giving in
Theres one thing you should know
i'll be fighting to win

If you're ready to give it all u got
You know that i'll be waiting
If you're ready let's give it all this time

Just the sound of your heart remains
If we learn how to break the chains 
We can settle the score and we'll know this is what we've been fighting for
This is the moment 
We learn to survive

So here i stand
It takes a man to change the world
Like the man i used to be
when we were young and wild and free
And we were fighting for our freedom
Never giving in
Theres one thing you should know
i'll be fighting to win
Theres one thing you should know
i'll be fighting to win
