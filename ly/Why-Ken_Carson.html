		  Damn, why you steal my swag? Uh, mm-mm

Damn, why you steal my swag? (Goddamn)
Damn, I don't even want it back
Damn, why do me like that?
Why do me like that? Uh
Why do me like that? Uh, yeah, uh, damn, uh
Why you steal my swag? Uh, damn, uh, yeah, uh
Why do my like that? Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh
I don't even want it back, uh
You can keep that, uh
You can have that 'cause I'm on some new shit

I got a new bitch i got a new swag
I got a new whip
I got some new drugs and they all came sealed
I got some new pills and
You know they all real
I got some new opps so you
Know I keep that steel
And I kill, I won't spill
Anything for a dollar, anything for a bill
But I don't want no problems
I just wanna chill

Damn, why you steal my swag?
Damn, I don't even want it back
Damn, why do me like that?
Why do me like that? Uh
Why do me like that? Uh, yeah, uh, damn, uh
Why you steal my swag? Uh, damn, uh, yeah, uh
Why do my like that? Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh
I don't even want it back, uh
You can keep that, uh
You can have that 'cause I'm on some new shit
