		  Hol' up

I fall in love with the view everytime I see your legs come up
Like ya left some keeping coming right back for more
I got you open doin' things you ain't never did before
I know just what you want

Girls like you wanna have fun
Baby you can call me later
Feeling like you wanna get done
I'ma hit you with that saber
It's on you tell me what you want
I can bring the party favors
Ain't no rules anything goes

I just wanna take this ride with you oh oh
Take my time with you oh oh
Slow whine with you oh oh
Spend the night with you
All night with you all night with you oh oh
Catch flights with you oh oh
Do the all night with you oh oh
Slow whine with you oh oh
All night with you all night with you

Whine for me baby you whine for me
Drop it down like you want something from me
Just tonight you can belong to me
Just tonight just tonight yeah
Nice and slow like you in love with me
You so fine I need you close to me
Whine for me baby whine for me
