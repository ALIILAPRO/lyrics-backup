		  (Tay Keith, what the fuck goin' on, nigga?)

Crazy, crazy, only ten pack, eighty
Touch out, rock-a-bye baby, say she hate me
I'm like, "Why she hate me?" Ain't did shit to hate me
I'm in Atlanta with switches
Finna pull up on Ced, finna pull up on Baby (switches, switches)
I'm in Atlanta with switches
Finna pull up on Savage, finna pull up on Sremmurd (switches, switches)
I'm in the city with choppas
Finna pull up on Nuk, finna pull up on Tuk
Opps call my phone like, "Finna pull up on you"
Finna pull up on who?
Tell 'em, "Come through," tell 'em come do what they do
Tell 'em come make they move (tell 'em)
Tell 'em, "Come through," tell 'em come do what they do
Tell 'em, "Come make the news"

I ain't feelin' none of these niggas (Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
All that shit they say be flaw
Niggas lie, I know the truth, I be like, "Come on, knock it off"
Call her shark attack, what's in between my legs stay in her jaws
Call me pad man, what's in between my legs stay in her draws
Yeah, we got shots fo' sho', but they is not fo' sho'
They fill that up, we totin' the lil' jawns
We shoot, they gettin' low, it look like limbo
Text on Telegram, it say, "That shit end," it's from my 'migo
Call me cousin'nem and say, "That shit end," and they say, "10-4"
My nigga avalanche, my wrist a avalanche, my mouth a avalanche
My bitch ain't average, my gang ain't average, my car not average
I be on wicked shit, my gang on wicked shit, my bitch on wicked shit
I be on silly shit, hop out this silly quick, I'm tryna split a wig
She say she feelin' me, she want to feel on me, she want a nigga, me
Said he got hit a bunch but end up pullin' through, I say, "You kiddin' me"
Niggas get butterflies when they around the gang, they be so jittery
My nigga, a couple houses, no exaggeratin', I'm talkin' 'bout literally
This gun go bang, bang, my chain go bling, bling, I'm screamin', "Gang, gang"
And it ain't shit changed, I'm on the same thing, I still'll bang, bang
We don't play no games, and we don't drop names, we lettin' shit rain
Ran out of propane, ain't breakin' shit down
We sellin' whole things
Walk in the store, and I got a stick under my arm
Nigga play, he gon' die in the store
Say he gettin' a switchie, but he ain't gon' keep it on auto
The fuck is he buyin' it for?
He ride in a Hemi, police pull him over, he stop
Then the fuck is he drivin' it for?
If I see her, I'm hittin' the bitch, nut, I don't ever see her 
'Cause this nigga hidin' the ho
They really bitches, them niggas just actin' like gangstas
Them nigga be hidin' they ho
When we out of town, they be goin' on live outside
Like we ain't have 'em duckin' before
Bro, be usin' your brain whenever it come to this gang
Or we puttin' that shit on the floor
All these niggas is lame
We know somebody in gang probably be hittin' his ho (fuck her, nigga)

Crazy, crazy, only ten pack, eighty
Touch out, rock-a-bye baby, say she hate me
I'm like, "Why she hate me?" Ain't did shit to hate me
I'm in Atlanta with switches
Finna pull up on Ced, finna pull up on Baby
I'm in Atlanta with switches
Finna pull up on Savage, finna pull up on Sremmurd
I'm in the city with choppas
Finna pull up on Nuk, finna pull up on Tuk
Opps call my phone like, "Finna pull up on you"
Finna pull up on who?
Tell 'em, "Come through," tell 'em come do what they do
Tell 'em come make they move
Tell 'em, "Come through," tell 'em come do what they do
Tell 'em, "Come make the news"
