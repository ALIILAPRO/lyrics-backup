		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We used to play pretend
You and me thought it might never end
Now I wonder where you've been
I sit around and miss you

The fireflies went dark
Turning all the darkness to the shore
Oh, what made us let it go?
I sit around and miss you

I miss you awful bad now
I miss the friend I had now
I miss you

Now when it's getting dark
I walk outside, I ghost out in the park
Always sure we'd leave our mark
I sit around and miss you

I miss you awful bad now
I miss the friend I had now
I miss you
I sit around and miss you
