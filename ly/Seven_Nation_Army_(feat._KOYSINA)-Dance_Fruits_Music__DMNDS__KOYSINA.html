		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm gonna fight 'em all
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Taking their time right behind my back
And I'm talking to myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette

And the message coming from my eyes
Says, "Leave it alone"

And the message coming from my eyes
Says, "Leave it alone"

And the message coming from my eyes
Says, "Leave it alone"

I'm gonna fight 'em all
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
And I'm talking to myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette

And the message coming from my eyes
Says, "Leave it alone"

And the message coming from my eyes
Says, "Leave it alone"

And the message coming from my eyes
Says, "Leave it alone"
