		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come on girls

A school bell rings off the day
Brings in a stray a few girls at play
Cut school pink slips are fine
For a good time there's boys on their mind

A bad girl smoking in school
Breaking the rules acting real cool
Talkin' 'bout all the rock boys
Back seat joys with some boy's toy

At the girlschool, 'cause my baby broke all the rules
At the girlschool, 'cause my baby broke all the rules

Saddle shoes, uniforms blue
Love all the girls in the girlschool
Traffic jam in the hallway
Ooh I'm gonna stay, this makes my day

Well here they come, girls from the school
Breakin' the rules, hot on the loose
My girl left right from school
Came over to my house, wooh

At the girlschool, 'cause my baby broke all the rules
At the girlschool, 'cause my baby broke all the rules
At the girlschool, 'cause my baby broke all the rules
At the girlschool, 'cause my baby broke all the rules

You're staying after school

At the girlschool, 'cause my baby broke all the rules
Girlschool, 'cause my baby broke all the rules
Cut school pink slips are fine
For a good time there's boys on their mind
At the girlschool, 'cause my baby broke all the rules
At the girlschool, 'cause my baby broke all the rules
At the girlschool, 'cause my baby broke all the rules
At the girlschool, 'cause my baby broke all the rules
At the girlschool
