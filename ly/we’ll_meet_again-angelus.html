		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I see through all your lies
The only one I despise
Really don't want us to fight
But it's the only way

Oh, oh, oh we can't just be friends again
Oh, oh, oh that isn't part of the plan
Oh, oh, oh we can't just be friends again
Oh, oh, oh that isn't part of the plan

Running around town
Got your secrets in my head
Got so many ex hoes I wish I never met
And I know that some bitches really
Want me in their bed
And I know some also really want me dead
Catch up, gotta catch my breath
We're reckless, I'm just toxic, dead
I'm a menace, pleasе don't fuck with me
Speeding, driving off the highway

When I liе to her face, she believes me
I don't even have to try, this shit easy
I'm in my prime, can't relax, relieve me
Middle finger any person, nigga
You don't need me
When I lie to her face, she believes me
I don't even have to try, this shit easy
I'm in my prime, can't relax, relieve me
Middle finger any person
Cut them off completely

Oh, oh, oh we can't just be friends again
Oh, oh, oh that isn't part of the plan
Oh, oh, oh we can't just be friends again
Oh, oh, oh that isn't part of the plan
