		  DJ Durel (woo, woo)
Let's go (go)
If you're not from the Nawf, mind ya business (hey)

Suicide doors on the Cullinan (Cullinan)
If I fuck her, she gotta let my brothers in (smash)
I don't love her, I backdoor and hit the friend (woo)
Undercover, hop out and spin many men (grrt)
Got it straight out the mud, we was gettin' it (we gettin' it)
Now the guts it got blood in the Bentley (hey)
I had made 'bout a dub out in Lenox (dub)
If you not from the Nawf, mind ya business (nawf)

Let's get it (Let's go)
No penny pinchin', we stackin' these racks to the ceilin' (woo)
Hurtin' these fuck niggas feelings (hey)
Look at my .30 and it's stickin' out of my shirt (what?)
How the fuck did he get in the building? (huh?)
Huncho really rappin' on Millie DaVillie (woo)
Don't walk out the house without sticks or a milli (nah-nah, nah-nah)
I fuck it up, make it back in a quickie (suu)
I make it back in a (suu, uh)

I make a M in a minute (one minute)
But I get you whacked for a penny (whacked)
I'm back on that set, yeah, a menace (hey)
We back on their necks with no gimmicks (go, go)
I put this mop to your tendons (mop)
Hit the switch on the Glock, now you finished (Glock)
Take the top off like Wayne with no ceiling (hey)
We was stuck in the game with no dealin' (Take-Take-Takeoff)

I put a quart on my wrist, what the fuck? (what the fuck?)
I coulda bought me a double R truck (could've)
Cut up your seats right on top of her tongue
I need a B 'cause a M ain't enough
When I'm ridin' that Rolls, I ride with that drum (grrt)
Keepin' it tucked, they tryna be tough (tough)
No IRS, he givin' it up (Give it up)
Look at the snow, we callin' your bluff (yeah)
And it's a platinum Arabian dial
I'm checkin' your stats and I'm pullin' your files
I look at your diamonds, I'm seein' clouds
No bossin' but you need to throw in the towel
You talkin' 'bout cars and clothes and hoes
And money don't fold, the world is ours
We countin' up 'chos, we stick to the code (stick)
And put work in to get respect and the power

We was stuck in the game like EA (stuck)
We from the Nawf, no TAs (nawf)
Empty your pockets how we play (run that shit)
We doin' the race like a relay (race)
Migo know Spanish, comprende? (Migo)
We got the block caliente (hot)
Fuck who the boss, come get with the sensei (boss)
Bitch, no cap, no pretende (bitch)

I make a M in a minute (one minute)
But I get you whacked for a penny (whacked)
I'm back on that set, yeah, a menace (hey)
We back on their necks with no gimmicks (go, go)
I put this mop to your tendons (mop)
Hit the switch on the Glock, now you finished (Glock)
Take the top off like Wayne with No Ceilings (hey)
We was stuck in the game with no dealin' (woo)

I make a M in a minute (one minute)
But I get you whacked for a penny (whacked)
I'm back on that set, yeah, a menace (hey)
We back on their necks with no gimmicks (go, go)
I put this mop to your tendons (mop)
Hit the switch on the Glock, now you finished (Glock)
Take the top off like Wayne with No Ceilings (hey)
We was stuck in the game with no dealin' (woo)
