		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stronger than reason
Stronger than lies
The only truth I know
Is the look in your eyes
The look in your eyes

Just like a car crash
Just like a knife
My favorite weapon
Is the look in your eyes
You've run out of lies

You've run out of lies you've run out of lies
You've run out of lies you've run out of lies
You've run out of lies you've run out of lies
Get out of my life

I'm chewing on glass
And eating my fingers
I'm not the one
Who's run out of lies

You've run out of lies you've run out of lies
You've run out of lies you've run out of lies
You've run out of lies you've run out of lies
Get out of my life?

Cutting my face
And walking on splinters
I lost my soul
To the look in your eyes

You ran out of lies you ran out of lies
You ran out of lies 

Stigmata
Stigmata
Stigmata

Oh, oh 

Stigmata
You have empty eyes, yes
You have empty eyes, yes
You have empty eyes, they tell me nothing, nothing but lies
You have empty eyes, oh 
You have empty eyes, oh
You have empty eyes, they tell me nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing but lies, oh

You have empty eyes, oh
You have empty eyes they tell me nothing, nothing, nothing but lies
