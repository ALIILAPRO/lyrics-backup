		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Taste the waste
Of our neon disgrace
Deformed children made from corporate gods grace Better
wear your mask because
The air melts your face
No one wins in this human race
I pledge allegiance to my own corruption
Preserving my freedom of self destruction I want
to be the one with the most damage You can’t
tell me how to live on my
Slum planet
My trash hate and lies Piled
as high as I like So welcome
to my Slum planet
I don't care if you live or you die As
long as your willing to buy So
welcome to my
Slum Planet
The only thing here built to last
Is the engine that turns your world to trash My
domain is the future pain
Light your path like a moth to the flame
My trash hate and lies Piled
as high as I like So welcome
to my Slum planet
I don't care if you live or you die As
long as your willing to buy So
welcome to my
Slum Planet
Behind my plastic faces Sealed off
inside glass cases
My machine my machine will grant it All the
dreams of a slum planet
“Today we shall no longer live in shame and regret of our inability to coexist in accord with
nature. We must embrace our superior position upon this planet and recognize it as a
resource for our disposal and no matter how finite of a resource it is, we shall live for today
and not question the limitations of tomorrow as we are the gods of now. Thank you for your
donation”
My trash hate and lies Piled
as high as I like So welcome
to my Slum planet

I don't care if you live or you die As
long as your willing to buy So
welcome to my
Slum Planet
Behind my plastic faces Sealed off
inside glass cases
My machine my machine will grant it All the
dreams of a slum planet
