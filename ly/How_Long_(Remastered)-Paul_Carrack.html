		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How long has this been going on?
How long has this been going on?

Well, if friends with their fancy persuasion
Don't admit that it's part of a scheme,
Then I can't help but have my suspicions
'Cause I ain't quite as dumb as I seem.
And you said you was never intending
To break up our singing this way,
But there ain't any use in pretending.
It could happen to us any day.

How long has this been going on?
How long has this been going on?

Oh, your friends with their fancy persuasion
Don't admit that it's part of a scheme.
But I can't help but have my suspicions
'Cause I ain't quite as dumb as I seem.
Oh, you said you was never intending
To break up our singing this way,
But there ain't any use in pretending.
It could happen to us any day.

And how long has this been going on?
How long has this been going on?
How long?
How long has this been going on?
How long has this been going on?
How long has this been going on?
How long?
How long has this been going on?
