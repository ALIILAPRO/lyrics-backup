		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah we ain't from 'round here
We don't like to sit tight
Party in the spacecraft
Xenon step and sip light gPS your function
You don't know what lit means
Space boys with space dreams
Cake creams and ray beams

I got my team, I got my team, I got my team
I got my team, I got my team, I got my team
I got my team, I got my team, I got my team
I got my team, I got my team, I got my team

I got niggas on-site i got niggas on-site
I got niggas on-site i got niggas on-site

I got my team, I got my team, I got my team
I got my team, I got my team, I got my team
I got my team, I got my team, I got my team
I got my team, I got my team, I got my team

Sometimes when we're mid-flight stratosphere
I bite my finger in anticipation
I can’t wait for sweet release
Oh I can’t wait for sweet release

Yeah we ain't from round here
We don't like to sit tight
Party in the spacecraft
Xenon step and sip light gPS your function
You don't know what lit means
Space boys with space dreams
Cake creams and ray beams

Sorry boy, sorry girl you can not be serious
Thinking cause you tweak that you
Can sit with us
Twist those fisticuffs and fix
To lick our stick
Steal our schtick or flip our cuts?
Nigga what the fuck?
You can't crush the blips and chips like us
(God Damn)
To flip the script now that's a must
Life ain't always tap it
Quick like double-dutch
Go and grab your loofah and your rubber duck
You fuckboy
