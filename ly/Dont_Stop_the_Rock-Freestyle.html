		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a party in the house and we'll be rocking tonight
So bring your body with you baby and I'll make you feel right
It's a freaky celebration of the natural kind
And the pleasure you'll experience will blow your mind

[Chorus:]
Freestyle's here in the house tonight
Move your body from left to right
To all you freaks, don't stop the rock
'cause Freestyle's here & you know we're hot

Everybody will be dancing to the beat on the floor
You will encounter situations never thought of before
Satisfaction's guaranteed if you know what I mean
And when you walk into the door it's such a freaky scene

All you ladies interested in the words I speak
We will be rocking like this every night of the week
And all you fellas tell the ladies don't stop the rock
Because you know that we'll be jamming around the clock

I went to a party, and what did I see
The girls were wearing leather skirts and see-through jeans
I asked the DJ to tell me what was going on
He said Freestyle's having a freak-a-thon

There's a party in the house and we'll be rocking tonight
So bring your body with you baby and I'll make you feel right
It's a freaky celebration of the natural kind
And the pleasure you'll experience will blow your mind
