		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been searching for you all night long
Now we're here alone
I've been waiting
You always were so unpredictable
But I like the tone
That you're taking

Oh, whenever you're near me 
I can't help but get excited
I can't stay away, oh, no
Oh, tell me, baby, what's the game you're dealing
Boy, you know I wanna play, play, play, play, play, play

Oh, no

Oh, my baby
All you gotta do is say the word
Say the word
All you gotta do is say the word for me
Oh, my baby
Say the word
All you gotta do is say the word
Oh, no

Oh, my baby

I've been searching for you all night long
Now we're here alone
I've been waiting
You always were so unpredictable
But I like the tone
That you're taking

Oh, whenever you're near me I can't help but get excited
I can't stay away
Oh, no
Oh, tell me, baby, what's the game you're dealing 
Boy, you know I wanna play

All you gotta do is say the word for me
Say the word
All you gotta do is say the word for me
Oh, my baby
Say the word
All you gotta do is say the word

Oh, no

Oh, my baby
All you gotta do is say the word
Oh, no
Say the word
All you gotta do is say the word for me
Oh, my baby
Say the word
