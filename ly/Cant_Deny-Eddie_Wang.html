		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I got off the train, I got your text
I couldn't imagine that you would break my heart so fast
I told myself it was only a dream
But you kept on sayin' sorry to me
Well all your promises and lies
Can I hear them one more time?

I know it was just a few days with you
But you can't blame me for fallin' in love
‘Cause you were the perfect one
I can't deny the truth

cnd though it was just a few days with you
Still, I don't understand how you moved on so easily
Like it was meant to be
I can't deny the truth

Now I'm tryin' to get over you but it's so hard
Whenever I smile, I'm reminded of the life that was ours
I've told myself I just need more time
But I'll probably wait until I die
So all your promises and lies
Can I hear them one more time?

I know it was just a few days with you
But you can't blame me for fallin' in love
‘Cause you were the perfect one
I can't deny the truth

cnd though it was just a few days with you
Still, I don't understand how you moved on so easily
Like it was meant to be
I can't deny the truth

Remember I promised I would write you this song
Well maybe one day you could help me change the plot

I know it was just a few days with you
But you can't blame me for fallin' in love
‘Cause you were the perfect one
I can't deny the truth

cnd though it was just a few days with you
Still, I don't understand how you moved on so easily
Like it was meant to be
I can't deny the truth
