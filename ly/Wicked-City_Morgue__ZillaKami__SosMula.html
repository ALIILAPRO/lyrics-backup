		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Is that Shoki on the beat?)
(Hellsing)
Yeah

You might fold under pressure
I can't be the one to be a ho, nigga, please stay silent
Put a couple bullet holes in your stretcher
You can't walk around when I'm in your town
Come back

I just want to talk to ya (what's up, ho?)
I just want to talk to ya (what's up, ho?)
I just want to talk to ya (what's up, ho?)
I just want to talk to ya

And I don't like y'all niggas for no reason
And I'm tired of y'all fuck niggas breathin'
You snitch-ass niggas, y'all commitin' treason
Make your leather red, just like it's killer season, bitch
Who the fuck you talkin' to your face?
Push back 1ft buddy, that's an accolade
They done gave me pain, turn it into lemonade
And I can't say the same for you niggas
Got some 5.56s in the bottom of the mag
Told 'em if he see him just to up it when they pass
Ain't gonna be no witnesses, so you don't need a mask
Find some ghost guns in the bottom of the trash

You might fold under pressure
I can't be the one to be a ho, nigga, please stay silent
Put a couple bullet holes in your stretcher
You can't walk around when I'm in your town
Come back

I just want to talk to ya (what's up, ho?)
I just want to talk to ya (what's up, ho?)
I just want to talk to ya (what's up, ho?)
I just want to talk to ya (ewok, ewok)

I don't wanna talk to ya (no-no, no-no)
I'ma put this fuckin' hawk in ya (doot-doot-doot-doot)
I'ma pull up with Godzilla (vyoom-vyoom)
Give you two, three shots like a bartender (bop, bop, bop, bop)
Ah, burn the rubber, see the car fender (vyoom, vyoom, vyoom, vyoom)
Word to mother off the hard liquor (splash, splash)
Kill your mother, kill your godsister (doot-doot-doot-doot)
Kill your brother, kill your pops, nigga (ewok)
Gingerbread man, walkin' dead man (ewok, ewok, ewok)
Watchin' out for the fed's van, I ain't scared, man (fuck outta here)
Bitch, I'm high like Meth' and Redman, suck my eggplant (splash, splash, splash)
I ain't stoppin' at the dead end, pop him in his headband (no-no, doot-doot-doot-doot)

You might fold under pressure
I can't be the one to be a ho, nigga, please stay silent
Put a couple bullet holes in your stretcher
You can't walk around when I'm in your town
Come back (good times)

I just want to talk to ya (what's up, ho?)
I just want to talk to ya (what's up, ho?)
I just want to talk to ya (what's up, ho?)
I just want to talk to ya
