(Yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

VV's got me outside
Lambos got me outside
Chrome Heart got me outside
Louis got me outside
Bad hoes got me outside
Foes they got me outside
Benzos got you outside 
That shit got you outside
These hoes got you outside
Lessons got you outside
Bad hoes got you outside
Young bitch got me outside
Out here playin' outside
Assholes got you outside, 'side, 'side
'Side, 'side, 'side, 'side, 'side, 'side

Suckin' dick while she look up
Ain't wearin' nothin' but a push-up
That'll make a nigga put the Glock down
Make a nerd nigga put the book up
Rolls Royce got me riskin'
Audemar got me whiskin'
Ritz Carlton got me fishin'
Don't treat the bathroom like the kitchen, huh
But if it's Wagyu I'm with the shit then, huh
One of one limited edition, huh
Saville Row all out in Britain, huh
I ain't eatin' unless it got a Michelin, huh
Jesus Piece I ain't even Christian, huh
At Christie's tryin' to get a Titian, huh
Can't appear mid like Egyptian, huh
Tryin' to get a bad bitch attention, huh

VV's got me outside
Lambos got me outside
Chrome Heart got me outside
Louis got me outside
Bad hoes got me outside
Foes they got me outside
Benzos got you outside 
That shit got you outside
These hoes got you outside
Lessons got you outside
Bad hoes got you outside
Young bitch got me outside
Out here playin' outside
Assholes got you outside, 'side, 'side
'Side, 'side, 'side, 'side, 'side, 'side

Six figures got me turnin' up
Outside sittin' on furniture
Eight room villa with the Pergola
I'm tryin' to get inside it like a burglar
Octagon bezel no circular
Stupid ass watch, ain't learn enough
Apple vision pro I'm in the virtual
No jet mean either ain't work enough, huh?
Tryin' to drop a ticket at Lennox
And I graduated from the water tower
Finish line shit is finished
Oak Street the origin of all of ours
Serious business superior work ethic, clearly I'm in it
Bitch, like million a minute 
Material shit got me exterior with it

VV's got me outside
Lambos got me outside
Chrome Heart got me outside
Louis got me outside
Bad hoes got me outside
Foes they got me outside
Benzos got you outside 
That shit got you outside
These hoes got you outside
Lessons got you outside
Bad hoes got you outside
Young bitch got me outside
Out here playin' outside
Assholes got you outside, 'side, 'side
'Side, 'side, 'side, 'side, 'side, 'side (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

List of the shit that I want
Come with some shit that I don't
All part of chasin' a check
All part of wantin' to flaunt
Vertu I pick up my phone
Kick it with bitches in Rome
Whip is expensive as homes
No ceilin' and glitterin' chrome

VV's got me outside
Lambos got me outside
Chrome Heart got me outside
Louis got me outside
Bad hoes got me outside
Foes they got me outside
Benzos got you outside 
That shit got you outside
These hoes got you outside
Lessons got you outside
Bad hoes got you outside
Young bitch got me outside
Out here playin' outside
Assholes got you outside, 'side, 'side
'Side, 'side, 'side, 'side, 'side, 'side
