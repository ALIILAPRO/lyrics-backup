		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have seen 
Too many sad eyes look at me 
The eyes that set me free, 
All the places that I've been. 
 
So thank you for the letters that 
You thought you wrote in vain 
And for the times you chose 
To stand out in the rain 
And wait for me
For me
 
Your words, your words help me to see 
A little honesty, in a world that doesn't share. 
And your eyes tell the story of your pain 
Severity of your disdain, in a world that doesn't care. 
 
You, you understand my pain, 
From this I gather strength 
In that we are the same. 
 
So thank you for the letters that 
You thought you wrote in vain 
And for the times you chose 
To stand out in the rain 
And wait for me 
For me. 
The life I live would never be the same without you here
