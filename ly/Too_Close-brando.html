		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me if we’re getting too close, to the edge,
Cause we got all the time we want, catch your breath,
Why try to deny it, get you to the point you can’t fight it,
And tell me if we’re getting too close

Oh yeah you got this room heating up,
Like a one way trip to the sun,
Tell me how does it feel,

Been fantasizing yeah all about,
Loving your body down,
Want to make sure it’s real

I don’t got plans for the night,
Only got plans for you right, right now,
All these ideas on my mind,
Baby let’s bring them to life

Tell me if we’re getting too close, to the edge,
Cause we got all the time we want, catch your breath,
Why try to deny it, get you to the point you can’t fight it,
And tell me if we’re getting too close

Tell me
Tell me

Tell me
Tell me

Oh yeah we both in trouble now,
My heart don’t have any doubts,
I already knew,
You got me so high feet are clear off the ground,
It’s not hard to figure out,
When I’m right next to you

I don’t got plans for the night,
Only got plans for you right, right now,
All these ideas on my mind,
Baby let’s bring them to life

Tell me if we’re getting too close, to the edge,
Cause we got all the time we want, catch your breath,
Why try to deny it, get you to the point you can’t fight it,
And tell me if we’re getting too close

Tell me if we’re getting too close, to the edge,
Cause we got all the time we want, catch your breath,
Why try to deny it, get you to the point you can’t fight it,
And tell me if we’re getting too close

Tell me
Tell me
