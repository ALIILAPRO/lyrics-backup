		  Anyway, anyway, I'm feeling, mm-hmm
Anyway, anyway, hmm

I can't decipher my feelings
I should've bottled them up
But I spilled them on you
'Cause you wanted me to
And you lapped them up

I missed all of the meaning
Made you think that I'm tough
But that isn't love
It's the opposite of
It's not nearly enough

And I heard the future calling
Do you know where you are?
You always got the worst of me
Now I hold that on my shoulders
When I'm falling apart
I gotta stop this train of thought
Before it runs away

'Cause I don't wanna talk about it anyway
Anyway, anyway, I'm feeling (I want to talk to you)
Even if I got so much to say
Anyway, anyway
I wish you could see me today, but I don't wanna talk about it anyway
Anyway, anyway, I'm dreaming
'Cause if I saw you, what would I even say?
Anyway, anyway (anyway, I fucked all my chances by walking away)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Mm

Always lied, "I just got over it", yeah
But now I know, looking back
We'd all have a chance
If the hindsight I had could be mine in advance
I bet you think I got off lightly
When you watch from afar
But karma got a hold of me
And she is hiding in the shadows
And she feeds off the dark
I gotta try, let in the light
Before it fades away

'Cause I don't wanna talk about it anyway
Anyway, anyway, I'm feeling
Even if I got so much to say
Anyway, anyway
I wish you could see me today
But I don't wanna talk about it anyway
Anyway, anyway, I'm dreaming
'Cause if I saw you, what would I even say? (Hmm)
Anyway, I fucked all my chances by walking away
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Mm, mm, da-da-da-da-da-bum
Mm

But I don't wanna talk about it anyway
(Anyway, anyway, I'm feeling)
Even if I got so much to say
(Anyway, anyway)
I wish you could see me today
But I don't wanna talk about it anyway
(Anyway, anyway, I'm dreaming)
('Cause if I saw you, what would I even say?)
Anyway (anyway, I fucked all my chances by walking away)
Ooh, oh (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Anyway, anyway
Anyway, anyway
Oh, I don't wanna talk about it
Anyway, anyway, anyway
Anyway, anyway
Can we talk about something else?
Anyway, anyway, anyway
