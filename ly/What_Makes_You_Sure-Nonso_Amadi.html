		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What makes you sure
She’s laying here in my arms
Did I write this song pretending I love you
What makes you sure
That I’m not alone at my mum’s
Can you trust me now the way that I trust you

And she says let’s not change the topic like that
If you try I'll knock it right back
Give me some names and numbers
Come on be honest you can be honest
She says let’s not change the topic like that
If you try I'll knock it right back
Since you calling me out I wanna know
What makes you so so sure

Drop

But how you take know say me unfaithful
Loving you girl you’re pretty ungrateful
You know you can trust me lover lover
You know all of your friends don’t like me
That’s why they out there telling you lies
I know you know what’s up
You can’t deny it

And she says let’s not change the topic like that
If you try I'll knock it right back
Give me some names and numbers
Come on be honest you can be honest
She says let’s not change the topic like that
If you try I'll knock it right back
Since you calling me out I wanna know
What makes you so so sure

Drop

Lover turned mafia
She a little bit sassier
Checking my texts I gotta deal my ex
She wanna know what I’m asking her

Lover turned mafia
She a little bit sassier
Checking my texts I gotta deal my ex
She wanna know what I’m asking her

Drop
