		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ooh, Johnny)
(SXBZ beats, baby)
Look

Heart stay frozen (and again)
I'm givin' strokes in a forward motion
Nigga like me had her legs wide open (yeah)
Life's short, true, it's been a long journey (journey)
King Charles had me gettin' up early
(Early)
Puttin' six in the wrist then ripped it (rip it)
Parkers to the cellular district

(Look)
If the police run a check, it's all over
That's another burden on my shoulder (long)
I got the undie stoking
Five stars if I lose composure (five)
I kept movin' and they turned off
They could've found Tunde in Alberta (baow)
If I shoot on your day, it get whacked off
If not it's gettin' worser and worser (big)
Run with it like he's tryna play rugby
Big tools if you say it get ugly (what?)
He had the super duper (yeah)
So I took a man stash, don't judge me
On the late night grind, don't bug me (why's that?)
I'm a whole mood lonely, real cozy, still gettin' my onesie (yeah)
Free TV stunt, it got messy (messy)
Get another way, Fifa stress me (huh?)
Two bills on packs, Red Dan Welbeck, how the hell the game sheg me? (How?)
Bro said he just caught him an opp and he got so close to the goal of the century (hurry)
And when I get into a one-on-one and I press circle but it just won't let me
(Yeah, look)

Heart stay frozen (and again)
I'm givin' strokes in a forward motion
Nigga like me had her legs wide open (yeah)
Life's short, true, it's been a long journey (journey)
King Charles had me gettin' up early (early)
Puttin' six in the wrist then ripped it (rip it)
Parkers to the cellular district

Look, like
(Back, back) back in the day (day)
Shorty ain't give me the snap, I said, "fuck it, she ugly" but really, she ain't (she weren't)
Still keep the wickedest base, if they run into yard then it ain't a debate (finish)
But can't get us out, we of age
Done with the nyash, tryna blow out his face (baow)
Shout out my nigga forever, he gave me a skill when he taught me the game (my brother)
All of them times it was pepper, I get me a phone and I do it again (again)
Used to pull scummies with A, but he get you nicked, wanna do it for days
All of them runners with jakes, gang throwin' up, couldn't handle the chase
Poor from you
Serious cutie (and again, and again)
I'm in a cut with a serious cutie
Blowin' on weed while we make our movie
Suck my dick, yeah, it's truly amazin'
Why, thank you, now let me see you get groovy (jump)
I just shot it in her mouth like bullseye
Top bins like Rooney

Heart stay frozen (and again)
I'm givin' strokes in a forward motion
Nigga like me had her legs wide open (yeah)
Life's short, true, it's been a long journey (journey)
King Charles had me gettin' up early (early)
Puttin' six in the wrist then ripped it (rip it)
Parkers to the cellular district
Look
