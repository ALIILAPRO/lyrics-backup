		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What was the last thing you said?
It took like over a year to get you out my head
And now I can't sleep
Thinking 'bout everything and all the things we did
And I don't think I miss you
I don't miss the shit that we been through
But now I'm stuck with this, try not to reminisce
Or I think I'll start to miss you

I don't know how to explain it
A year of racking my brain and I hated it
It's like I'm holding onto something that you never did
It's like I'll never have something just like we did
It's like I'll never hold hands with someone again
It's like I'll never introduce them to my friends
I guess it's the end

Just fucking look at you
You moved on so fast like, did you want me in the first place?
I wish you the best but only mean that in the worst way
Took you only a month to act like everything was okay
You fell right in love with him like I was just a halfway
Now I'm all on my own, need someone to talk to
My friends all abandoned me 'cause they'd rather choose you
This shit is so draining, need to do something brand new
I get tossed up and used then thrown away like some old shoes

Like fucking look at you
I think that you're right, I'm not the person that I used to be
I can't even hide that fact that this was all because of me
I made my mistakes, I let my head get straight to jealousy
All 'cause I thought I'd be the only one you ever see
But you have to remind me, you have to remind me
'Cause I know you said something, something with meaning
It was as I was leaving, I could've been dreaming
You have to remind me, remind me of one thing

What was the last thing you said?
I swear I didn't mean to leave you on read
But now it's morning, everyone's sleeping
And I can't decide if I should get out of bed
Like I don't wanna miss you
I don't miss the shit that we been through
But now I'm stuck with this, try not to reminisce
Or I think I'll start to miss you

It seems like every day I look at the pictures
A couple years of my life in a camera roll
I'm thinking maybe I really miss it
Reliving memories as I start to scroll
It feels like lately I've been stuck and I can't reach my goals
And I can't get myself out, I've been stuck in a hole
I'm really starting to believe it's the end
(Dude, at this point it doesn't even matter like)

Every time they talk about us they say we went Hollywood but
If there ever was a spot to take I think they probably would 'cause
Every single Zoloft that I take don't do me any good but
Black hair, black nails, she thinks she's misunderstood but
She don't know me like she think she does
And I'll be lying if said I gave a single fuck
And then you push me down and then you pick me up
I'm like one fight away from getting tired and giving up

Just fucking look at you
You moved on so fast like did you want me in the first place
I wish you the best but only mean that in the worst way
Took you only a month to act like everything was okay
You fell right in love with him like I was just a halfway
Now I'm all on my own need someone to talk to
My friends all abandoned me 'cause they'd rather choose you
This shit is so draining need to do something brand new
But after all that was said I don't regret that I knew you
