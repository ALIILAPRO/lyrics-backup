		<p>
		  Talk to me, you never talk to me.
Ooh, it seems that I can speak.
I can hear my voice shoutin' out.

But there's no reply at all.

Look at me, you never look at me.
Ooh, I've been sittin, starin', seems so long.
But you're lookin' through me
Like I wasn't here at all.

No reply.  There's no reply at all.

Dance with me, you never dance with me.
Ooh, it seems that I can move.
I'm close to you, close as I can get.

Yet there's no reply at all.
There's no reply at all.

Be with me.  Seems you're never here with me.
Ooh, I've been tryin' to get over there.
Oh, but it's out of my reach.

And there's no reply at all.
There's no reply at all.

I get the feelin' you're tryin' to tell me;
Is there somethin' that I should know?
What excuse are you tryin' to sell me?
Should I be readin' stop or go?
I don't know.

Be with me.  Seems you're never here with me.
Ooh, I've been tryin' to get over there.
Oh, but it's out of my reach.

And there's no reply at all.
There's no reply at all.

I get the feelin' you're tryin' to tell me;
Is there somethin' that I should know?
What excuse are you tryin' to sell me?
Should I be readin' stop or go?
I don't know.

Maybe deep down inside,
I'm tryin' for no one else but me,
Too stubborn to say, "The buck stops here.
I'm not the one you're lookin' for."

But maybe deep down inside, I'm lyin'
To no one else but me.
Oh, but my back is up.  I'm on my guard
With all the exits sealed.

Listen to me, you never listen to me.
Oooh, and it seems there's no way out.
I've been tryin' but we cannot connect.

And there's no reply at all.
There's no reply at all.
There's no reply at all.
No reply at all.
Is anybody listenin'?  Oh, there's no reply at all...
