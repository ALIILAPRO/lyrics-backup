		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was broke
I was just at home
Now I'm on the road
Talking to Usher at the Grove, yeah
Rocking Balmain, these ain't Joe
When I'm in DC they call me Moe
Always got the pedal to the floor
I got everything up in the store

That's just coke up in her nose, that ain't no booger (yeah)
Looking at that girl I really shouldn't (huh?)
Looking at that girl just like I wouldn't (yeah)
Looking at that girl and then I took it (yeah)
Grab the wheel, grab the wheel, grab it like I'm Tuddie (skrrt)
Nowadays I'm getting money I don't worry (yeah)
All my enemies and my opps they getting buried (huh)
All my enemies and my opps they getting buried (yeah)

Yeah, oh
I won't speak, yeah (shh)
Red bottoms my feet, yeah (red bottoms my feet)
My bitch on fleek, yeah (my bitch on what?)
Lil Uzi a beast, yeah (yeah)
No more (no)
I don't want to play no more (no, no, no)
I don't want to heartbreak no more (yeah)
I don't want to wait no more (yeah)
Ay, rocking shows (huh?)
I might get a lake house with a boat (yeah)
I might rock all white just like the Pope (like the who? woo)
I might rock all white just like the stove (like the stove, yeah)

That's just coke up in her nose, that ain't no booger
Looking at that girl I really shouldn't
Looking at that girl just like I wouldn't
Looking at that girl and then I took it
Grab the wheel, grab the wheel, grab it like I'm Tuddie (ayy)
Nowadays I'm getting money I don't worry
All my enemies and my opps they getting buried
All my enemies and my opps they getting buried

Yeah, oh
I won't speak, yeah 
Red bottoms my feet, yeah 
My bitch on fleek, yeah 
Lil Uzi a beast, yeah 
No more (oh yeah)
I don't want to play no more (no, yeah)
I don't want to heartbreak no more 
I don't want to wait no more (ooh, ooh)
Ay, rocking shows (I was)
I might get a lake house with a boat (I was)
I might rock all white just like the Pope (I am)
I might rock all white just like the stove (I was)

I don't know
Look I'm only 21 I don't know, yeah (yeah)
I don't know (yeah)
You niggas nothing that I know (yeah)
I was broke (I was broke)
I was just at home (just at home)
Now I'm on the road (on the road)
Talking to Usher at the grove
Rocking Balmains these ain't Joe (yeah)
When I'm in DC they call me Moe (yeah)
Always got the pedal to the floor (skrrt, skrrt)
I got everything up in the store (Lil Uzi)

That's just coke up in her nose, that ain't no booger, yeah (yeah)
Looking at that girl I really shouldn't, yeah (yeah)
Looking at that girl just like I wouldn't, yeah (what? Swag))
Looking at that girl and then I took it (my girl)
Grab the wheel, grab the wheel, grab it like I'm Tuddie, ayy (skrrt)
Nowadays I'm getting money I don't worry (yeah)
All my enemies and my opps they getting buried (huh?)
All my enemies and my opps they getting buried (yeah)

And I swear it is my time (woah)
Make her roll weed all the time, yeah
And I mix that lean and that lemon lime (no)
And I swear I won't sweat you that much if you wasn't fine (no ohh)
Then I made you mine 
You always think I'm lying (what else?)
I ain't got time for the lying (it's okay)
Girl get me some time
I can change you life ya

I shouldn't
I wouldn't
I took it
Grab the wheel, grab the wheel, grab it like I'm Tuddie
Nowadays I'm getting money I don't worry
All my enemies and my ops they getting buried
All my enemies and my ops they getting buried, yeah
