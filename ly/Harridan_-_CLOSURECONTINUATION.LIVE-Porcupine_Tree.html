		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gold man bites down on his silver tongue
Takes a deep breath and then blows the candle out
He knows the truth but he keeps it to himself
Here it is
You can only save yourself
Only yourself, yeah

When we bite the dust
We will hide our cuts from the world
When you're in the dirt
You don't show your hurt to the world

Cold man, white knuckles on the wheel, yeah
Well it's all just there to steal
You just gotta take it
Take it, just like the harridan you are

When we bite the dust
We will hide our cuts from the world
When you're in the dirt
You don't show your hurt to the world

It's the time of the almost rain without you
I am in debt tonight
And gone to earth for love
And I, a shadow
And what of us?
And what of me?
And what is left without you?

When we bite the dust
We will hide our cuts from the world
When you're in the dirt
You don't show your hurt to the world

It's the time of the almost rain without you
I am in debt tonight
And gone to earth for love
And I, a shadow
And what of us?
And what of me?
And what is left without you?
