		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a call the other day
It was my sister Carolyn, saying
"Aretha, come by when you can
I've got something that I wanna say"
And when I got there, she said
"You know rather than go through a long drawn out thing
I think the melody on the box will help me explain"

Gotta find me an angel
To fly away with me
Gotta find me an angel
Ooh and set me free

My heart is without a home
I don't want to be alone
I gotta find me an angel
In my life, in my life
Too long have I loved
So unattached within
So much that I know
That I need somebody so
So I'll just go on
Hoping that I find me someone
Gotta find me an angel
In my life, in my life

I know there must be someone
Somewhere for me
Oh, I've lived too long
Without the love of someone
And there's no misery
Oh oh, like the misery
I feel in me

Gotta find me an angel
In my life
(You'll meet him, now don't you worry)
In my life
(Keep looking and just keep cooking)
In my life
(He'll be there, now don't you worry)
In my life
