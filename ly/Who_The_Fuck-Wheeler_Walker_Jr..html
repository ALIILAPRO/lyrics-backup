		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Last thing I remember I was chuggin' some Jack
Took a buncha pills started smokin' some crack
Got a tattoo of a dick on my chest
Woke up in my truck was a hell of a mess

Hungover as hell and my ass it don't feel right
Who the fuck did I fuck last night?
Yeah, my balls are bruised and my dick is a hell of a sight
Who the fuck did I fuck last night?

Got a picture of a pussy and a dick in my phone
So whatever I did I didn't do it alone
They left a pair of boots, size fifteen
So whoever I fucked, they were bigger than me

Hungover as hell and my ass it don't feel right
Who the fuck did I fuck last night?
Yeah, my balls are bruised and my dick is a hell of a sight
Who the fuck did I fuck last night?

Can't believe every night I been doin' the same ol' thing
One of these days I'll get laid
And remember their name

Hungover as hell and my ass it don't feel right
Who the fuck did I fuck last night?
Yeah, my balls are bruised and my dick is a hell of a sight
Who the fuck did I fuck last night?

Who the fuck did I fuck last night?
Who the fuck did I fuck last night?
Who the fuck did I fuck last night?
