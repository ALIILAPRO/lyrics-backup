		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh so you the man who come to sweep the yard, the yard man. 
I like that broom stick your carrying yes baby I like it. 

I want you to take your broom and sweep up my yard. 
You better brush it good or we could fall apart. 

Don't give me no shortcut thing you have all day and night. 
I had to satisfy,so you better do it right. 

Work what you waiting for 
Work put your back in it 
Work just a little more 
Work sure your wanting it now 
Work till your body hurting 
Work working hard and long 
Work when you finish that 
Work I want your god damn tongue 

Go down, go down go down, 
Come up, come up come up come up 
Go down go down go down go down 
Come up come up come up come up 

Its what you come to do, Just remember that 
And don't pick me fruits,you can put them back 
You start of working nice,with your big broomstick 
Now your easing back, like your 'fraid of brick 

Work what you waiting for 
Work put your back in it 
Work just a little more 
Work sure your wanting it now 
Work till your body hurting 
Work working hard and long 
Work when you finish that 
Work I want your god damn tongue 

Go down, go down go down, 
Come up, come up come up come up 
Go down go down go down go down 
Come up come up come up come up 

Oh yes yes baby I like the work you do on my yard. 
You do reel good work yard man. 

I find you lookin' nervous like your afraid to fail. 
Now your making excuse bout your feeling pains 
Just don't waste my time cause you will get me mad. 
Have a bit down there, that could bite your broomstick hard 

Work what you waiting for 
Work put your back in it 
Work just a little more 
Work sure your wanting it now 
Work till your body hurting 
Work working hard and long 
Work when you finish that 
Work I want your god damn tongue 
Work I want your god damn tongue 

Go down, go down go down, 
Come up, come up come up come up 
Go down go down go down go down 
Come up come up come up come up
Come up come up come up come up

Ladies, you know if you don't have a yard man, you can't be a hard man, you know
What I'm talking about. Guys you know what I'm talking about too,not so? 

And if a man want to test you tell him come, come 
And if a man want to test you tell him come, come 
So if a boy want to test you tell him come, come 
And if a man want to test you tell him come, come 

Work, work, work,work,work 
Work, work, work,work,work
Work, work, work,work,work
