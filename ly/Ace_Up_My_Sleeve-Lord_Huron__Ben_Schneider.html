		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I get by on the dreams I conceive
I defy my bad luck with the will to believe
I just know that I'm destined to be something more
I was born with an ace up my sleeve

Take a drag off of my cigarette
It might help pass the time on the road to regret
Let me know when you're ready to leave
I have all that we need, there's an ace up my sleeve
Take my hand, there's an ace up my sleeve

All I know is I'm gonna stay until I go, oh, oh
Wish me well, I won't play with what I'm dealt, dealt, dealt

I've been known to look up at the sky
I feel lost in this world and I want to know why
I'll be fine, don't you worry 'bout me
What's the use? I can't lose, there's an ace up my sleeve
I can't lose, there's an ace up my sleeve

All I know, is I'm gonna stay until I go, oh, oh
Wish me well, I won't play with what I'm dealt, dealt, dealt
