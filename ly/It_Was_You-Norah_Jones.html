		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh, mmm, mmm
Ooh, ooh, mmm, mmm
Ooh, ooh, ooh, mmm
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Enter the nights all remains
Make me get up off my feet
Take the beat out of my heart
Now the people might believe

And I knew, and I knew
And I knew, and I knew it was you
And I knew, I knew
And I knew, I knew it was you
And I knew, and I knew
And I knew, I knew it was you
And I knew, and I knew
And I knew

Moments fall like crimson nights
Some stick to my skin tonight
Take a breath and shake them off
Eyes ahead, don't you wait too long

And I knew, I knew
And I knew, and I knew it was you
And I knew, and I knew
And I knew, I knew it was you
And I knew, and I knew
I knew, I knew it was you
And I knew, and I knew
And I knew it was you

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

And I knew, and I knew
And I knew, and I knew it was you
And I knew, and I knew
And I knew, I knew it was you
And I knew, and I knew
And I knew, I knew it was you
And I knew, and I knew
And I knew, and I knew it was you
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
