		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A little narcotic warm on me
What will I do without the weight of you?

Funeral singers wail
Charity fails, whose child are you now?

The lighthouse keeper grazed the lip
Spread like a fog
Stood in the weather and prayed for a push
But doesn't take the jump again tonight

The book is aching for the tree
Return, return, return to me
All my friends, all my friends
All my friends are weeds and rain

All my friends are half-gone birds
Are magnets, all my friends are words
All my friends are funeral singers
Funeral singers, funeral singers wailing

A spark is aching for the light
Return, return, return tonight
All my friends, all my friends
All my friends are keeping time

All my friends have just quit trying
All my friends are funeral singers
Funeral singers, funeral singers wailing
