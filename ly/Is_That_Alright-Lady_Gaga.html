		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Life is so simple
A little boy, a little girl
Laughing and loving
Tryin' to figure out the world

It felt like summer
When I kissed you in the rain
And I know your story
But tell me again

Nothing you say wouldn't interest me
All of your words are like poems to me
I would be honored if you would take me as I am

I want you
To look right in my eyes
To tell me you love me
To be by my side
I want you
At the end of my life
I wanna see your face when I fall with grace
At the moment I die
Is that alright?
Is that alright?

I hope you're still with me
When I'm not quite myself
And I pray that you'll lift me
When you know I need help

It's a warm celebration
Of all of our years
I dream of our story
Of our fairy-tale

Family dinners and family trees
Teachin' the kids to say, "Thank you," and, "Please"
Knowin' if we stay together that things will be right

I want you
To look right in my eyes
To tell me you love me
To be by my side
I want you
At the end of my life
Wanna see your face when I fall with grace
At the moment I die
Is that alright?
Is that alright?
Is that alright?
