		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We are not the sons of God
We are not his chosen people now
We have crossed the path he trod
We will feel the pain of his beginning

Shadow fingers rise above
Iron fingers stab the desert sky
Oh, behold the power of man
On its tower, ready for the fall

Knocking heads together well
Raze a city, build a living Hell
Join the race to suicide
Listen for the tolling of the bell

Out of the the universe 
A strange love is born
Unholy union 
Trinity reformed

Yellow sun, its evil twin
In the black the winds deliver him
We will sleep to souls within
Atom seed to nuclear dust is riven

Out of the the universe 
A strange love is born
Unholy union 
Trinity reformed

Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns

Burying our morals and burying our dead
Burying our head in the sand
E equals MC squared, you can't relate
How we made God with our hands

Whatever would Robert have said to his God
'Bout how he made war with the Sun?
E equals MC squared, you can't relate
How we made God with our hands

All nations are rising
Through acid bells of love and hate
Chain letters of Satan
Uncertainty led us all to this
All nations are rising
Through acid veils of love and hate
Cold fusion of fury

Divide and conquer while ye may
Others preach and others fall and pray
In the bunkers where we'll die
We're the executioners, they lie

Bombers launched with no recall
Minute warning of the missile fall
Take a look at your last day
Guessing you won't have the time to cry

Out of the the universe 
A strange love is born
Unholy union 
Trinity reformed

Out of the darkness
Out of the darkness
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousands suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousands suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousands suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousands suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousands suns

Holy Father, we have sinned
