		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you feel it creepin' up in your system
You see double when you look with your vision
I see stars 'cause you're one out a million
You're like treasure 'cause I know that you're waitin'

Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it like I know that I feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you take in all the stars in a minute

Can you feel it? (Can you feel it?)
Can you feel it? (Can you feel it?)
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it? (Can you feel it?)
Can you feel it? (Can you feel it?)
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?

Try to run but every time I just need you
I'm so faded when I simply just leave her
'Cause with you, I swear I feel like I can't lose
I will do anything when it comes to you

Can you feel it? (Can you feel it?)
Can you feel it? (Can you feel it?)
Can you feel it like I know that I feel it?
Yeah, I'm fallin' (yeah, I'm fallin')
Yeah, you're fallin'
I can feel it creepin' up from within

Oh, oh, oh

Can you feel it? (Can you feel it?)
Can you feel it? (Can you feel it?)
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it? (Can you feel it?)
Can you feel it? (Can you feel it?)
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
