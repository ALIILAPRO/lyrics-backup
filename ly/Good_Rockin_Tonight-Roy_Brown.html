		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I heard the news, there's good rockin' tonight
Well, I heard the news, there's good rockin' tonight
I'm gonna hold my baby as tight as I can
Tonight she'll know I'm a mighty, mighty man
I heard the news, there's good rockin' tonight

I said, meet me and a-hurry behind the barn
Don't you be afraid 'cause I'll do you no harm
I want you to bring along my rockin' shoes
'Cause tonight I'm gonna rock away all our blues
I heard the news, there's good rockin' tonight

Well, we're gonna rock
We're gonna rock
Let's rock
Come on and rock
We're gonna rock all our blues away

Have you heard the news, everybody's rockin' tonight
Have you heard the news, everybody's rockin' tonight
I'm gonna hold my baby as tight as I can
Well, tonight she'll know I'm a mighty, mighty man
I heard the news, there's good rockin' tonight

Well, we're gonna rock, rock, rock, rock
Come on and rock, rock, rock, rock
Let's rock, rock, rock, rock
Well, let's rock, rock, rock, rock
We're gonna rock all our blues away
