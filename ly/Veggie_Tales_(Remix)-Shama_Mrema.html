		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you like to talk to tomatoes
If a squash can make you smile
If you like to waltz with potatoes
Up and down the produce aisle'
Have we got a show for you!
VeggieTales
Broccoli 
Celery
Gotta' be
VeggieTales!
Lima Beans
Collard Greens
Peachy Keen
VeggieTales!
Cauliflower
Sweet and sour
Half an hour
VeggieTales! 
It's time for veggie tales 

Throwback
Sunday school
Best show vegetables
Every episode so cool 
Learning bout God and Bible
Low key, grown man
High key, still a fan
I play the songs when I can
God's bigger than the Boogie Man 
Barbara Manatee and Pizza Angel come to me
I'm motivated pirate who don't do anything, no
(No seriously, I just stay home and lay around)
Shout out to Larry the cucumber
My boy Bob the Tomato
Y'all stick to DC and Marvel
Larryboy's my superhero
Oh where, oh where, is my hairbrush tho
Oh why, oh why, doesn't everybody have a water buffalo
Keep walking and walking but you won't knock down this wall no
I think all cheeseburgers are precious and the very best show is

VeggieTales
VeggieTales
VeggieTales
VeggieTales
There's never ever ever ever
Ever been a show like
VeggieTales
There's never ever ever ever
Ever been a show like
Veggie Tales!
It's time for VeggieTales

I still don't know what I'd do if my lips left me, man
What y'all know about them Cebus
None of them Marvel heroes got plungers for ears, dawg
It's Laura's fault, she broke the plate
She kept saying she had to demonstrate an Apple chopper, chopped right thru the plate, mane
Yodelehi yodelehi yodelehi hoooooo
