		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Used to pray for a rain just to stay inside
You wouldn't believe it
Every move that I made, I was terrified
After every road I took had a bitter end
I just couldn't see it
I convinced myself tryna trust again

Would be like tryna make a river goin' upstream
Tryna make a mountain into a valley
That's what your love does to me
You make me feel

Like I never had my heart broken
Like I never saw a door closin'
Like I never watched love run away on fire
In the night like a pack of wild horses
Like I never felt the tears rolling
Like I never said here's hoping
I could find me someone who's good at being real
Who could make me feel wide open
Like I never had my heart

Broken, broke-broke-en
Bro-bro-broken-en-en ('cause, you make me, you make me)
Broken-en-en-en-en (uh)
Bro-bro-broken-en-en ('cause, you make me, you make me)

Feel like I never been too much to handle
Roll the dice, you know love is a gamble
Feel like I always had to pour, it's how life moves
Lost fire in yo' heart, I'm tryna re-light that candle
My Cinderella, no questionin', this shit forever
Pain in written letters, sheddin' tears while we sit together
Forget the pressure, know our love hard, I'm sick of lectures
Stuck in rain storms, I could get used to this different weather
Broken pieces, that was all I had
Girl, I promise, now you all I got

Like I never had my heart broken
Like I never saw a door closin'
Like I never watched love run away on fire
In the night like a pack of wild horses
Like I never felt the tears rolling
Like I never said here's hoping
I could find me someone who's good at being real
Who could make me feel wide open
Like I never had my heart

Broken, broke-broke-broke
Bro-bro-broken ('cause, you make me, you make me)
Broken, broke-broke-en
Bro-bro-broken

Like I never had my heart broken (like I, like I never)
Like I never saw a door closin'
Like I never watched love run away on fire
In the night like a pack of wild horses
Like I never felt the tears rolling
Like I never said here's hoping
I could find me someone who's good at being real
Who could make me feel wide open
Like I never had my heart

Broken, broke-broke-broke
Bro-bro-broken-en-en (never had-had my)
Broken-en-en-en-en
Bro-bro-broken-en-en-en-en
