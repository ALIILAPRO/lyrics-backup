		<p>
		  I don't know anything
I don't know anything
I don't know anything
I don't know who I am
I don't know anything
I don't know anything
I don't know anything
I don't know who I am

Why we have to live in so much hate everyday? 
Oh yeah
Why the fighting and the coming down, am I sane?
I don't know
Yeah

I don't know anything
I don't know anything
I don't know anything
I don't know who to be
I don't know anything
I don't know anything
I don't know anything
I don't know who I am

Why we have to live in so much hate everyday?
Oh yeah
Why the fighting and the coming down, am I sane?
I don't know
When the teacher put the ruler down on my hand
I laughed
Cross my heart and hide reliever in trails of blood
I love

I don't know anything
I don't know anything
I don't know anything
I don't know who I am
I don't know anything
I don't know anything
I don't know anything
I don't know who to be

Why we have to live in so much hate everyday?
Oh yeah
Why the fighting and the coming down, am I sane?
I don't know
When the teacher put the ruler down on my hand
I laughed
Cross my heart and hide reliever in trails of blood
I love
