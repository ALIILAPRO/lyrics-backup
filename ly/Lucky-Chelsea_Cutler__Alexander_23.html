		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How lucky am I? How lucky am I? Yeah
To love somebody, to love somebody
How lucky am I? How lucky am I? Yeah
To love somebody, to love somebody like

You are the voice in my head, something I cannot forget
Your word is gospel and I want you
Movin' at the speed of light, two wrongs could still make a right
If you believe it and I want to

How lucky am I? How lucky am I? Yeah
To love somebody, to love somebody
How lucky am I? How lucky am I? Yeah
To love somebody, to love somebody like

Sometimes I wish you would've stayed in my dreams
'Cause now that you're real, now I could lose you
Nothin' lasts forever ain't as bad as it seems
'Cause my favorite thing to do is to do nothin' with you

How lucky am I? How lucky am I? Yeah
To love somebody, to love somebody
How lucky am I? How lucky am I? Yeah
To love somebody, to love somebody like

To love somebody, to love somebody
(How lucky am I? Yeah)
To love somebody, to love somebody

It's not every day you could hear me say, you could hear me
I love somebody, I love somebody
It's not every day you could hear me say, you could hear me
I love somebody, I love somebody, yeah
