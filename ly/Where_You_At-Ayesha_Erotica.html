		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stumbling through the city
ID's gone (Uh-huh)
Gotta find a place to get my party on (Uh-huh)
Need cheap drinks and a place that doesn't card (I don't)
'Cause I plan on going fucking hard
At least I have my cigarettes
But I don't have a lighter (I don't)
I hope no bitches steal my look
'Cause imma have to fight her (I will)
I tried to call Ayesha but her phone is fucking dead (Sorry)
Oh, whatever
I'll try again later
I'll call this twink instead
I'm dirty on the dance floor
Getting rowdy like X-Tina
I'm off three lines and a half a blunt
Bitch you can keep the 'Tina
I'm just tryna suck some dick
Tryna pop my little titties
Then I get a text from Alex
Said he's lost in the Windy City, I said
Hey bitch, where you at?
(I don't know where the fuck I'm at)
Can you hear me?
Am I breaking up?
(I can't hear, are you breaking up?)
Get over here, let's party
(I just wanna party)
Grab my purse, get a ride
And I'll meet you outside
Hey bitch, where you at?
(I don't know where the fuck I'm at)
Can you hear me?
Am I breaking up?
(I can't hear, are you breaking up?)
Get over here, let's party
(I just wanna party)
Grab my purse, get a ride
And I'll meet you outside
Smells like sex, triple X
I'm hoppin' clubs, one to the next
I'm loaded, bomb, paid for good
Pulling more dick than I know I should
I want the hardest wood, I'm cruisin' trade
Sippin' on Vodka Lemonade
I'm gettin' laid, alright
Bikini tops, see-through, real tight
I'm walking through Boystown, but I can't find a bottom
I see some skinny twinks out here but I don't wanna top them
And I can't find Ayesha
'Cause she's probably sucking dick
Bitch, pick-up your goddamn phone
You're gonna make me sick
Hey bitch, where you at?
(I don't know where the fuck I'm at)
Can you hear me?
Am I breaking up?
(I can't hear, are you breaking up?)
Get over here, let's party
(I just wanna party)
Grab my purse, get a ride
And I'll meet you outside
Hey bitch, where you at?
(I don't know where the fuck I'm at)
Can you hear me?
Am I breaking up?
(I can't hear, are you breaking up?)
Get over here, let's party
(I just wanna party)
Grab my purse, get a ride
And I'll meet you outside
Yeah
Uh-huh, uh
Ayesha and Alex
Fuck me 'til I die
