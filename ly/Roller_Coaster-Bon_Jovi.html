		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Roller coaster
I see you thinking twice
Wish I could read your mind
Move up or out of line
Too late for praying
I know we might lose our breath
We might be scared to death
This chance is like a step
Just got to take it
Whoa oh

Countdown to here we go
Oh oh oh
Hold on tight, slide a little closer
Up so high stars are on our shoulders
Time fly's by, don't close your eyes
Kiss by kiss love is a thrill ride
What goes up might take us upside down
Life ain't a merry go round

It's a roller coaster
It's a roller coaster

Can't lie and won't pretend
I know what's round the band
Too late to start again
Won't take it slower
Let's slip right off these tracks
We'll fly or we might crash
Don't look down, don't look back
'Cause it ain't over

Hold on tight, slide a little closer
Up so high stars are on our shoulders
Time fly's by, don't close your eyes
Kiss by kiss love is a like a thrill ride
What goes up might take us upside down
Life ain't a merry go round

It's a roller coaster
It's a roller coaster

Whoa oh
Countdown to here we go
Oh oh
Hold on tight, slide a bit closer
Up so high the stars are on our shoulders
It's a roller coaster
Kiss by kiss love is like a thrill ride
What goes up might take us upside down
Life ain't a merry go round

It's a roller coaster
It's a roller coaster
Roller coaster
It's a roller coaster
