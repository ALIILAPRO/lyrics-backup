(Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)

Lights, camera, action, play your role
Rest in peace Magic, rest your soul
I can't stop the madness, she’s on go
And everybody else knows, yeah
She be stuck on me like Velcro
Earn your stripes like shelltoes
Fuck her with my Nikes on
Know I gotta put my team on
SossHouse, yeah, she's home
Givin' me Georgia Dome, yeah

Outer space love we be geeked up
Alien, yeah, yeah, wait
If you need love when I'm busy as fuck
Then lay with him (yeah)
I got the whole world in my hands
(Damn, damn)
Don't fuck up my plans (Wait, wait)
Hmm, you don't understand (Wait)
I got my own bitch, yeah

This for the team this is for all the times
We ain't have no cheese
Hot boy like Juvenile, 400 Degreez
Police around the block, take off on feet
Grandma be worried about me
When I'm in Queens you was right here
Now you far away like a lightyear
Yeah, what’s my fears?
Losing you is what I fear

Outer space love we be geeked up
Alien, yeah, yeah, wait
If you need love when I’m busy as fuck
Then lay with him (yeah)
I got the whole world in my hands
(Damn, damn)
Don't fuck up my plans (Wait, wait)
Hmm, you don’t understand (Wait)
I got my own bitch, yeah

A lot on my plate, huh
You can't relate, wait
These niggas fake, wait
It's no mistake, yeah
Bitch, I am great, wait this is my fate
Yeah, you fishy like bait
Lil Duval, live my best life, no complaints
So many hoes, fly away to restraint (yeah)
These niggas mad, got my cash filled to hate
(yeah)
But the money keep a smile on my face (yeah)
Fool 4L, boy, you better say your grace

Outer space love we be geeked up
Alien, yeah, yeah, wait
If you need love when I'm busy as fuck
Then lay with him (yeah)
I got the whole world in my hands
(Damn, damn)
Don’t fuck up my plans (Wait, wait)
Hmm, you don't understand (Wait)
I got my own bitch, yeah

(This, I need you to listen to me)
(I need you to bring me what I want)
(I need you to hand over the soss)
(I know you have it)
