		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I come alive
See me fall from grace
In disguise
This is far from over
Wicked lies
Blinding is your game
Fate decides
This is far from over
I'm breathing out
Im breathing in again
Fighting the unknown
Time and time alone
I'm bleeding out
I'm bleeding in again
Crying out alone
This hell is not my home
Oh there's nowhere left to run
There's nowhere left to hide
From the demon inside
Oh i fear what i've become
Goodbye is almost done
Its my demon inside
You live inside
Creeping through my mind
Tensions rise
Feeling you take over
Mental ties
We become the same
Paralyzed feeling
You take over
I'm Bleeding out
Im bleeding in again
Crying out alone
This hell is not my home
Oh there's nowhere left to run
There's nowhere left to hide
From the demon inside
Oh i fear what i've become
Goodbye is almost done
Its my demon inside
I feel him crawl over me
Nothing bleeds deeper than letting go
I pray each day he stays away
Every breath is one less step from killing you
I feel him crawl over me
Oh there's nowhere left to run
There's nowhere left to hide
From the demon inside
Oh i fear what i've become
Goodbye is almost done
Its my demon inside
Oh there's nowhere left to run
There's nowhere left to hide
From the demon inside
Oh i fear what i've become
Goodbye is almost done
Its my demon inside
