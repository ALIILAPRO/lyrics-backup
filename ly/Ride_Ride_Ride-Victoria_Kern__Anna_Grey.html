		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My eyes are closed 
The wind is in my hair 
It's nearly 2am 
And you say, "Don't be scared "
Losing all control
You make me let it go
Let it go (huh, huh, huh)

Blinded by the headlights 
Reality's out of sight
Just trynna get away 
From the voices in my mind 
Losing all control
You make me let it go
Let it go 

Ride, ride, ride 
Into the night
Chasing down the highway 
Never slowing down 
Slowing down 
Huh, huh, huh 
Can you feel the rush?
Huh, huh, huh (huh, huh, huh)

Ride, ride, ride 
Into the night
Chasing down the highway 
Never slowing down 
Slowing down 
Huh, huh, huh 
Can you feel the rush?
Huh, huh, huh

Ride, ride, ride 
Huh, huh, huh
Huh, huh, huh
Ride, ride, ride 
Huh, huh, huh
Huh, huh, huh

Underneath the black skies
Drowning in your blue eyes 
Nothing else feels right
I'm leaving it behind 

Losing all control
You make me let it go
Let it go 

Blinded by the headlights 
Reality's out of sight
Just trynna get away 
From the voices in my mind 
Losing all control
You make me let it go
Let it go 

Ride, ride, ride 
Into the night
Chasing down the highway 
Never slowing down 
Slowing down 

Huh, huh, huh 
Can you feel the rush?
Huh, huh, huh 

Ride, ride, ride 
Into the night
Chasing down the highway 
Never slowing down 
Slowing down 
Huh, huh, huh 
Can you feel the rush?
Huh, huh, huh 

Ride, ride, ride 
Huh, huh, huh
Huh, huh, huh
Ride, ride, ride 
Huh, huh, huh
Can you feel the rush?
Huh, huh, huh
