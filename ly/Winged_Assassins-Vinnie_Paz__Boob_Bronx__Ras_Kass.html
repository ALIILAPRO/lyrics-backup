		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look, you the muhfuckin' tin man
Bullets measured in a straight
Line like a wingspan
That’s my ahki, that's my brother
That's my fuckin’ kinsman
All heads bein' young boys over flim flam
We run through you like Bo Jackson
Muhfuckas aim for the wig and it's no cappin'
Look, I got goons and they chrome magnet
What the fuck the point of
A safety with no action?
I will ride on whoever
Pain is temporary, pride is forever
Why I had to ask you for my bread back?
I ain't shootin' dice
That's a muhfuckin' head crack
You mixed up and the boi dirty
Can’t tie his own shoelaces
And the boi thirty
And why would I even bother to brawl?
The bigger they are thе harder they fall
Stupid!
