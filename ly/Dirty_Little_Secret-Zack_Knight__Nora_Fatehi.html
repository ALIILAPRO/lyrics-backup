		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl I aint looking for no drama
Don't wanna take you home to mama
Just wanna keep it 1 on 1’er

I wanna get your body on me
And make you think of all them bad dreams I heard you like it like madonna Come and let me set you free

Cos you could be my dirty little secret
Be my dirty dealer
Baby till you fall asleep

And I could put your body on the ceiling You dont need a reason  call me till its after 3

I can make you never wanna leave
Bring you to your knees
Come and live your fantasy

Cos I could be your dirty little secret
Be my dirty dealer
You can put the X on me
X on me

Boy I know you wanna get a taste
I Know u wanna see me levitate
But when you come around dont make me wait (na na) u heard its sweeter than a lemonade?

Boy I dont wanna be your one and only
Cause all they wanna do is try to own me But u da one Im calling when I’m lonely Yeah yeah yeah

You said You never had it like this with all dem other gyal That’s why you wanna keep the business it to minimal Could never be my inta habibi if u wanna get with me Then you could be my...

Cos you could be my dirty little secret
Be my dirty dealer
Baby till you fall asleep

And I could put your body on the ceiling You dont need a reason  call me till its after 3

I can make you never wanna leave
Bring you to your knees
Come and live your fantasy

Cos I could be your dirty little secret
Be my dirty dealer
You can put the X on me
X on me

when i see that big back
Body on tik tok
call me round the clock
there will be no hesitation

dont wanna misguide ya
always on time girl
we dont need a label, we dont need no altercation

so Hit me on my line girl so i can be of service i dont wanna lie girl its better when your nervous dont wana make you mine but I wanna make a promise that if you wanna that ectasy

Cause you could be my,
You could be my
CHORUS
