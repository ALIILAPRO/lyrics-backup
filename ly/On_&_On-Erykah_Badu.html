		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, my, my, my
I'm feeling high
My money's gone
I'm all alone
Too much to see
The world keeps turnin'
Oh, what a day
What a day, what a day

Peace and blessings manifest with every lesson learned
If your knowledge were your wealth 
Then it would be well-earned

If we were made in his image
Then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in God 
But they fear us just the same

Oh, on and on and on and on
(My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone)
Woo, on and on and on and on
(All night 'til the break of dawn)
I go on and on and on and on
(My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone)
Ooh, on and on and on and on
(God dammit I'ma sing my song)

I was born underwater
With three dollars and six dimes
Yeah, you might laugh
'Cause you did not do your math

Like one, two, three
Damn, y'all feel that? Oh
Like one, two, three
The world keeps turning
Oh what a day, what a day, what a day

The man that knows something 
Knows that he knows nothing at all
Does it seem colder in your summertime 
And hotter in your fall?
If we were made in his image 
Then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in God 
But they fear us just the same

Oh, on and on and on and on
(My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone)
On and on and on and on
(All night 'til the vultures swarm)
I go on and on and on and on
(My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone)
Ooh on and on and on and on
(Mad props to the god JaBorn)

I am feeling kinda hungry 'cause my high is coming down
Don't feed me yours 'cause your food does not endure
I think I need a cup of tea, the world keeps burnin'
Oh, what a day, what a day, what a day

You rush into destruction 'cause you don't have nothin' left
The mothership can't save you so your ass is gon' get left
If we were made in his image then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in God 
But they fear us just the same

Oh, on and on and on and on
(My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone)
Oh, on, on, on, on and on, on, on
(You can't fuck with me so just leave me alone)
Ooh, ooh, way on and on and on and on
(My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone)
Oh, on and on and on and on, on
(And on and on)
