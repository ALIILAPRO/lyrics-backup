		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Holy verses in his kiss he was your bible
You found nature in his lips
The sex was tribal
He brought purpose to your hips
Your soul's revival such a hopeful Eve
But Adam let you down

He played you fast and reined you in
No slow recital
You waited for him on the strip
But no arrival

Gave it up for him
But only just to let you down
To let you down, to let you down
Gave it up for him
But only just to let you down
To let you down, yeah he let you

Now you wanna run wild
Now you wanna run wild
Now you wanna run wild

Your heart's been dragged from left to right
Your soul's in limbo
To suffocate your open mind
He closed the window
And thus revenge is in your eyes
Spare me the info such a hopeful Eve
But Adam let you down

He played you fast and reined you in
No slow recital
You waited for him on the strip
But no arrival

Gave it up for him
But only just to let you down
To let you down, to let you down
Gave it up for him
But only just to let you down
To let you down, yeah, he let you

Now you wanna run wild
Now you wanna run wild
Now you wanna run wild

You acting D12 crazy, this is so bizarre
That's just what happens
When you suffer from a broken heart
Tight jeans, warm thighs
But your soul is frigid
That's just what happens
When you make someone your true religion
You acting D12 crazy, this is so bizarre
That's just what happens
When you suffer from a broken heart
Tight jeans, warm thighs
But your soul is frigid
That's just what happens
When you make someone your true religion

Gave it up for him
But only just to let you down
To let you down, to let you down
Gave it up for him
But only just to let you down
To let you down, yeah, he let you

Now you wanna run wild
