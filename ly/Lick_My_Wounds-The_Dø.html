		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lick my wounds
Suck the venom
There's our shelter
There's our shed

Broke a tooth and made a move
Before the storm
Caught a bird into my hands
To make a bond
Loving is a poison is a hologram

Bleeding feet and desert beach in ochre sand
Does it make a difference if the pirates land
If we put aside our golden privacy

No one will be left behind, I guarantee
I guarantee

Lick my wounds
Suck the venom
There's our shelter
There's our shed

Trustfully and gracefully I'm lost at sea
Shallow waters don't appear a threat to me
We should row together to an island I know

Rearrange the riddle and reset the core
Reset the core

Lick my wounds
Suck the venom
There's our shelter
There's our shed

Lick my wounds
Suck the venom
There's our shelter
There's our shed
