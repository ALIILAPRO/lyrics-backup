		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  These sounds fall into my mind
These sounds fall into my mind

I can get down, I can get lonely
Every time I think about the highs
Yeah, messed me around and now you keep calling
Wondering if you can make it right

I told you it's the end for you and I
Swear this time we're through but it's a lie
When you call my name, yeah, ooh
That sounds so right, so right, so right

Deep down, wishing you were mine
Deep down, miss you all the time
Dream 'bout what we could've been if we tried, oh
But deep down, wishing you were mine, were mine

Deep down, you got me so
Deep down, I wanna go
Deep down, you got me so, yeah
Deep down, you got me so
Deep down, I wanna go
Deep down, you got me so, yeah

Yeah, need to be strong as soon as I see ya (see ya)
You can turn my tables back around so easy
You got the control (control), just hear when you speak (yeah)
Gets me kinda crazy, kinda foolish, foolish

I told you it's the end for you and I
Swear this time we're through but it's a lie
When you call my name, yeah, ooh
That sounds so right, so right, so right

Deep down, wishing you were mine
Deep down, miss you all the time
Dream 'bout what we could've been if we tried, oh
But deep down, wishing you were mine, were mine

Deep down, miss you all the time
Dream 'bout what we could've been if we tried, oh
'Cause deep down, wishing you were mine, were mine

Deep down, you got me so
Deep down, wishing you were mine (woo)
Deep down, miss you all the time (I miss you, yeah)
Dream 'bout what we could've been if we tried, oh (if we tried)
But deep down, wishing you were mine, were mine

These sounds, swirling through my mind (you got me so)
These sounds, swirling through my mind (I wanna go)
These sounds, swirling through my mind (you got me so)
These sounds, swirling through my mind, these
