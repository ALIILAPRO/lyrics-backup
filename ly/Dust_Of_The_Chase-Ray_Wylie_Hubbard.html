		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So, I come down from Oklahoma with a pistol in my boot
A pair of dice, a deck of cards, a Bible in my suit
I come her as the 'cause of tears, I'm just a crying shame
Seven stud or eternal blood, I'm lookin' for a game

I double crossed the State of Texas and they give me a little time
I taught myself to double cut the cards and hold scriptures in my mind
I learned to love the tumblin' dice and to believe the word
Tombstones or rolling bones, beats anything I ever heard

Patience is a virtue that I don't possess
And I can't deny that Heaven lies beneath a cotton dress
How small a part of time we share 'till we hear the sound of wings
I'm lost in the dust of the chase that my life brings

I have walked through God's green pastures beneath these rich blue skies
I have seen the fall of man and the kingdom hidden from their eyes
I have heard the roar of thunder and I've felt the lightening bolt
And when I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take along Samuel Colt

Every night I kiss the cards and I hold them to my breast
And when I see the King of Hearts I know that I am blessed
And though my eyes are blind sometimes, I know there's something there
So when the times at hand and I kill a man, I, I say a little prayer

So I come down from Oklahoma with a pistol in my boot
A pair of dice, a deck of cards, a Bible in my suit
How small a part of time we share till we hear the sound of wings
I'm lost in the dust of the chase that my life brings

How small a part of time we share till we hear the sound of wings
I'm lost in the dust of the chase that my life brings
