		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it time to kill the lights
You look like trouble and i like that
Save me all your friday nights
Got you chasing my smell
Call me coco mademoiselle
I'll have you heal
Until the sunrise
You hold me near
Look in my eyes
Can't waste all night with you
Just to find the place for two
If the view all around
High
I'm ready cos you knew that the city makes us do crazy things are you down
Met you up at a bar
In that body suit you're goin wild
We don't know just how far
Temperature is risin
I see you fantasisin
I'll have you heal
Until the sunrise
You hold me near
Look in my eyes
Can't waste all night with you
Just to find that place for two
If that view all around
High
I'm ready cos you knew that the city makes us do crazy things are you down
Is it time to kill to the lights
You look like trouble and i like that
Save me all your friday nights
Got you chasing my smell
Call me coco mademoiselle
