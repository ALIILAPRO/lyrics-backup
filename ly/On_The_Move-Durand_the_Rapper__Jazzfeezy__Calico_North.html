		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't sit down right now I'm on the move
Bitches all around in my town say I'm cool
I always stand out in the crowd with the crew
Any nigga talking shit getting loud I got a tool
Stay in your own lane or I'm going to show you what it do
Hustle hard every day these niggas ain't got a clue
I was raised in the streets I ain't ever have to choose
Ain't nobody fucking with me because I'm the truth
I been living this street life you niggas
Ain't ever been about that
I been on the block since I was a
Youngin you ain't ever been around crack
Don't come around trying to think you
Hard you ain't nothing but a clown act
If you got a problem we can knuckle up
Bitch we can take this shit out back
But my niggas ain't really trying to fight
Because they all about that gun play
They'll kill your ass on Monday
You'll be in the ground by Sunday
Go to the funeral see your mom
Tell her that her son gay
But we got to hurry because nobody like
You so the shit probably wont run late
Got bitches on my dick every day theses
Hoes cant get enough of me
Every bitch wants to fuck a dope boy
Getting money that's why they loving me
Some be getting way too comfortable
I'm a player bitch ain't no cuffing me
Only time I really want to see you is
When you bring yo mouth to comfort me
If you seen the shit that I been through
You would understand why I ain't got a heart
Before I can ever sell you weight you
Got to prove to me that you not a nark
What you know about putting 50
Pounds of baking soda in the shopping cart
I'm the biggest dog in the city bitch
I got a lot of bite and a lot of bark
I can't sit down right now I'm on the move
Bitches all around in my town say I'm cool
I always stand out in the crowd with the crew
Any nigga talking shit getting loud I got a tool
Stay in your own lane or I'm going to show you what it do
Hustle hard every day these niggas ain't got a clue
I was raised in the streets I ain't ever have to choose
Ain't nobody fucking with me because I'm the truth
