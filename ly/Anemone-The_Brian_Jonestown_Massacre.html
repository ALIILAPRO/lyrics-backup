		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I 
I think I know how I feel 
'Cause I 
I only play it for-real 
You should be picking me up 
Instead you're dragging me down 
Flying over my head 
You're landing all over town 

You 
You know that I try 
Try to tell you the truth 
Oh baby don't make me cry 
You should be picking me up 
Instead you're dragging me down 
Now I'm missing you more (more)
'Cause baby you're not around 
Now that you're not around 

I 
I want to know how it feels 
'Cause I 
I only play for-real 
You should be picking me up 
Instead your dragging me down 
I could be giving you love (love)
But you're not around 
Glad that you're not around 
Glad that you're not around 
Glad that you're not around 
Glad that you're not around 
Glad that you're not around
Glad that you're not around 
Glad that you're not around 
Glad that you're not around 
Glad that you're not around 
Glad that you're not around
Glad that you're not around 
Glad that you're not around 
Glad that you're not around 
Glad that you're not around
