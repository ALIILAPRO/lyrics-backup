		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heartbreaker, soul-shaker I've been told about you
Steam-roller, the midnight shoulder
What they been sayin' must be true

Red hot mama, oh that charmer
Time's come to pay your dues

Now you're messin' with a a son of a bitch
Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch
Now you're messin' with a a son of a bitch
Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch

Talking jive and poison ivy 
You ain't gonna cling to me
Minute-taker fall-faker 
I ain't so blind I can't see

Red hot mama oh that charmer
Time's come to pay your dues

Now you're messin' with a a son of a bitch
Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch
Now you're messin' with a a son of a bitch
Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch

Now you're messin' with a a son of a bitch
Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch
Now you're messin' with a a son of a bitch
Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch

Now you're messin' with a a son of a bitch
Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch
Now you're messin' with a a son of a bitch
Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch

Now you're messin' with a a son of a bitch
Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch
Now you're messin' with a a son of a bitch
Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch
