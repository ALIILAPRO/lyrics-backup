		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Super trouper lights are gonna find me
But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show
So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming
Suddenly I feel all right
And it's gonna be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight

Tonight the
Super trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun
(Sup-p-per troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun
(Sup-p-per troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the
Super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
(Sup-p-per troup-p-per)
Like I always do
(Sup-p-per troup-p-per)
Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

Facing twenty thousand of your friends
How can anyone be so lonely
Part of a success that never ends
Still I'm thinking about you only
(Still I'm thinking about you only)
There are moments when I think I'm going crazy
(Think I'm going crazy)
But it's gonna be alright
(You'll soon be changing everything)
Everything will be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight

Tonight the
Super trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun
(Sup-p-per troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun
(Sup-p-per troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the
Super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
(Sup-p-per troup-p-per)
Like I always do
(Sup-p-per troup-p-per)
Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

So I'll be there when you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive
And when you take me in your arms
And hold me tight
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight

Tonight the
Super trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun
(Sup-p-per troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun
(Sup-p-per troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the
Super trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
(Sup-p-per troup-p-per)
Like I always do
(Sup-p-per troup-p-per)
Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
(Super trouper lights are gonna find me)
