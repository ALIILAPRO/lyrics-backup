		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Snoop Dogg] 
N**** you need to stop snitchin! 
All that yip-yappin and jaw-jackin 
N**** if you scared, go to church 
You knew the job was dangerous when you took it 

Whattup it's the big boss Dogg 
Snoop D-O-double-G, Eastside L.B.C. 
And I'm bobbin to the beat of my O.G. homeboy Ice Cube 
And I'm C-walkin on the motherf***in concrete 

[Intro: Ice Cube] 
Yo if you're f***ed up, put your cups up 
Ice Cube and Snoop Dogg, n**** what's up 
See he's a gangster, I'm a hustler 
Yo it's either thank ya, or it's f*** ya 

[Ice Cube + (Lil Jon)] 
I'm down with Lil Jon ain't got to pretend (YEAH!) 
"Crunk Juice" n**** run the club that you in (HEY!) 
You scary motherf***ers don't wanna bring the ruckus (NAH!) 
You just spend all your time in the club tryin to duck us (WHAT?) 

And if you walk by n****, I'ma knock fire n**** 
from yo' a**, you can come try n**** (HEY!) 
In the hood, all the way down South (YEAH!) 
I ain't Mike Jones, keep my name out'cha mouth b**** (Mike Jones) 

We can get it crackin if it get to clickin clackin 
Look at Mr. Jackson, n**** with no reaction 
If you scared, go to church, we gon' hit you where it hurts 
That don't work, we'll put you in the dirt 

'Cause a whole lot of rappers make a whole lot of noise (hey) 
Lyrics full of steroids, n****z paranoid (hey) 
And when you get that blowup, it make you throw up 
When you realize your favorite rapper ain't got no nuts 

[Chorus: x2] 
If you a scared motherf***er go to church (GO TO CHURCH) 
If you a gutter motherf***er do your dirt (A DO YOUR DIRT) 
If you a down motherf***er put in work (A PUT IN WORK) 
IF you a crazy motherf***er go berzerk (A GO BERZERK!) 

[Snoop Dogg] 
Click clackin, pistol-packin, Crip raggin folio 
Who the only n**** in the club with the toolio 
You ain't know? Yeah you did; there it was, there it is 
"Is that Coolio?" Naw b****, let me in 

Jibba-jabba snatcher get at ya, spit at actors & rappers 
Hang out with kidnappers and jackers 
Make money off crackers; can you imagine how I keep s*** crackin? 
It's the big boss Dogg I'm back in action and smashin 

I flash with the bling I sur-pa** the supreme 
You don't really wanna have a clash with my team 
I mix hash with the green I'm the, last of the kings 
If I got a b**** with me she got a** in them jeans 

Rollin through yo' neighborhood, my Cadillac so clean 
Servin' all you suckers cause you all dopefiends 
Just like that dopeman, n**** what's up? 
You run up with that bulls*** I'll f*** yo' a** up 

[Chorus] 

[Repeat: x2] 
You scared, you scared 
You scared motherf***er you scared 
You scared (you scared) you scared (you scared) 
You scared motherf***er you scared (you scared) 

[Chorus] 

[Ice Cube + (Lil Jon)] 
It goes one for the money (HEY) two for the show (YEAH) 
Three for the p****, fo' for the glow (HEY) 
Five for the rookies, six for the pros (NAH) 
Seven for the numbers of them f***in zeroes (WHAT?) 

Eight for haters, nine for the cause 
Ten for my n****z, behind big bars (HEY) 
F*** these devils, and they laws (YEAH!) 
Never question the size of Ice Cube's balls
