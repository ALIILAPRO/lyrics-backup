		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl you're kinda freaky
Got something bout your smile
And when you bounce it up and down
I can't believe my eyes I got to give respect
Cause you know how to tease
Keep on walking I'll keep talking
You would not believe what I would do

[Bridge]
With a girl like you
keep your body rocking
I ain't gonna stop I just want you
And you know it's shocking when you rock it
I'm a sick sick man 'cause

Girl I get that cold sweat
Creeping up on me
I ache when you shake it
Girl I'm just a freak

Yeah, you set that cold sweat
Tripping on me
Burning with the fever
Girl, you're killing me

Girl I'm just a freak in need of therapy
I count the ounce in every bounce
And I just want to feast
I love the way you work it

I love the way you grind
Ya got the funk in every pump If you could read my mind
What I would do....

[Bridge]

Down, you're burning me down
You're burning me down
You're burning me down
I love the way you shake now love the way you break
Now keep it coming baby I don't want to hesitate now

You got me hooked every look makes me freeze
180 degrees you make me buckle at my knees
Crazy rumpshaker, sexy move maker baby bring it on
Better sooner than later I feel a cold sweat creeping up on me 
We gotta get it on tell me what it's gonna be

[Bridge]
