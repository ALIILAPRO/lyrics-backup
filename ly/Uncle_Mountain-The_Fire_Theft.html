		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can hear you talking
We're doing all the walking 
I'm stuck here in the middle
At war with good and evil
I can hear you talking 
I'm doing all the walking now
What strange your advice will
Believing you can fly
Rhythm of mind

Don't want to spend my time being afraid of dying
I really want to do good
I drown in a world of pity and sorrow 
Been immersed within the light
What was I looking to find
Run alone to the sea 
I want love if love wants me
I want god if god wants me
I just can't hold on to what I believe
