		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Big Ze shit
Zo shit, no ho shit
Z's up 'til I freeze up
DJ on the beat, so it's a banger

Ayy, money hungry, I went to Beni-hundreds
Ordered up a brick, they whipped it right in front of me
I'm a brilliant youngin, I'm out here road running
Went to Benihanas, I told 'em no onion
I be thuggin' by myself, I never need nobody
I'm off so much molly got me creepin' through sideways
Go and ask the streets about me, fuck what all the blogs say, baby
Jumpin' out with that woolie right in broad day, baby

I was raised by myself, I don't need guys
I was trappin' by myself in my Levi's
Sold a four, how you broke my heart
Mmh, mm-mm-mm
Yeah, they gon' shoot
Yeah, this what they do
(Tsh, grah), hang out that roof
Fuck everybody, that's my mood

Bro want to cut with a MAC on him
2K for the jeans with the patch on it
I was done with the Act', now I'm back on it
Don't sub-tweet, just at homie, yeah
Snitch a part of your charge
Bad bitch give me a massage
Lil' scammer, swipe your card
Keep hammers, I'm livin' large
My heart is full of a scar
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah
I had dreams of being rich as hell
Confused when you talk, can people tell?
I'ma go trap with a digital scale
I'ma talk pounds when they get through the mail
Nigga might tell you not fit for the jail
How you gon' feel when a nigga get killed?
First time countin' a mil', got chills
Back then, eatin' meals on wheels
Die for the gang 'cause I know I will
Made it out with no idea
Shawties got all on in that club door 'cause they didn't ID 'em
Shawty name never in that stuff, he don't go IG
Niggas always talking too tough, nigga, what it is
And I scream, "Free Boona," fuck what he did, yeah

I was raised by myself, I don't need guys
I was trappin' by myself in my Levi's
Sold a four, how you broke my heart
Mmh, mm-mm-mm
Yeah, they gon' shoot
Yeah, this what they do
(Tsh, grah), hang out that roof
Fuck everybody, that's my mood
