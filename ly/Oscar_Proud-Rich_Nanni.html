		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, ayy, ayy
If I broke your heart, it's a custom
You designer now
Bitch, stop all that cryin', denim tears
And I can't wipe em off
I can't take em serious, niggas jokes, like laugh out loud
Ha ha ha
Niggas is some bums, wearing the same clothes everyday
Like Oscar Proud
It ain't shit to talk about
Ain't no star 67 me
Brand new number on the hoe
I don't get 'No call ID's'
Got that lil' boy stuck, steady stalkin
And emailin' me
Got that lil' boy fucked, now he walkin
He couldn't ride for me
Guess I go both ways
'Cause he a bitch, uh, pardon me
On my feet, it's double C's
He want me back, better say please
I'ma still say no
I stand on business, ain't no hoe
Once I lock eyes with yo nigga, green light
'Cause he on go
Everyday a bad bitch, get let free
I'm back outside, get at me
We take a picture, better not tag me
Black Escalade, shakin' ass in the backseat
I got that fye, that nigga tender
Like he work at Zaxby's
I got that fye, gotta' put in work
New nigga got on khakis
Yeah, he work for me
Bad bitch do a lil' twerk for me
If he ain't got no monyun save yo' breath
You can't flirt with me
If I broke yo' heart, it's a custom
You designer now
Bitch, stop all that cryin', denim tears
And I can't wipe them off
I can't take'em serious, niggas jokes, like laugh out loud
Ha ha ha
Niggas is some bums, same clothes every day
Like Oscar Proud
