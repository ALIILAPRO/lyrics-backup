		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Welcome to the show (ah-ah-ah-ah)
We're here to let you know (ah-ah-ah-ah)
Our time is now (ah-ah-ah-ah)
Your time is running out (ah-ah-ah)

Feel the wave of sound as it crashes down
You can't turn away
We'll make you wanna stay

We will be adored
Tell us that you want us
We won't be ignored
It's time for our reward
Now, you need us
Come and heed us
Nothing can stop us now

Oh-oh, whoa-oh
I've got the music in me
Oh-oh, whoa-oh

Don't need to hear a crowd cheering out my name
I didn't come here seeking infamy or fame
The one and only thing that I am here to bring
Is music, is the music
Is the music in my soul

Gonna break out (out)
Set myself free, yeah
Let it all go (go)
Just let it be, yeah
Find the music in your heart (ah)
Let the music make you start (ah)
To set yourself apart

What we have in store? (Ah)
All we want and more (ah)
We will break on through (ah)
Now, it's time to finish you

You're never gonna bring me down
You're never gonna break this part of me
My friends are here to bring me 'round
Not singing just for popularity

We're here to let you know
That we won't let it go
Our music is a bomb and it's about to blow
And you can try to fight
But we have got the light of friendship on our side

Got the music in our hearts
We're here to blow this thing apart
And together, we will never be afraid of the dark
Here to sing our song out loud
Get you dancing with the crowd
As the music of our friendship survives, survives

Got the music in our hearts
We're here to blow this thing apart
And together, we will never be afraid of the dark
Here to sing our song out loud
Get you dancing with the crowd
As the music of our friendship survives, survives, survives
