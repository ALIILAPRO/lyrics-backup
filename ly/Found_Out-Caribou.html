		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  While she waits, she holds her breath
And thinks about the things we said

And sings a modern song she knows
But not remember how it goes

And everything she says she would fall for
She goes on so no one will know

Everything that she says she can fall for
She knows she'll be there on her own

And everything she says she can fall for
She goes on so no one will know

And everything she says she can fall for
She knows she'll be there on her own

And everything that she says she can fall for
She goes and she'll fall on her own

And everything she says she can fall for
She goes and she'll fall on her own
