		  (Great John on the beat, by the way)

Sliding through your city, whatchu on bae?
Been a long day
Run it up, I'm tryna put yo on, bae
Pull up on me, I ain't see you all day, damn
I ain't tryna take no picture, and pose for the gram
I just pulled up on the Benz, skirt off in the Lamb
And baby, I am who I am
Made it happen, ain't come with a plan
She say she my biggest of fans
She makin' it clap but ain't used his hands, damn
How the fuck she did that? Gotta get it on cam'
I get way too high, can't wait till I land

And no we can't lay in the sand
Girl, you know I'm too black for a tan
Damn, said she fell in love with the man
I could put the whole world in your hands, damn
Said she want drip from Paris but she never seen France
Said she want drip from, wait
Bad girls ain't no good and the good girls ain't no fun
She said "I hate you so much", but she still gon' let me fuck
Like, you get the buck, baby, I'm in a rush
At the top all I'm seeing is us
Like, yes, she a baddie, and shit, that's a plus
Drop the addy and shit going up
I hopped out my petakis and got on the bus
In my city with chops in the truck
She like "Bae is you happy to see me or what?"
I'm like "Yeah, but the glock in the cut" 
Sike, nah, that's the Glock in my pants
If I up at the spot gettin' blammed
Like, I heard that nigga done told on his mens
What the fuck y'all supposed to be friends
What the fuck y'all supposed to be cuzz
Man I thought y'all was supposed to be slatt
But you putting your trust in a rat
He ain't doing no time, he just getting you snapped
I be putting my trust in them racks
How I ran that shit up and I'm still moving tact, hold on
Caesar told me not to lack
Like, don't you get turned to a pack, hold on
She let me hit from the back
Back to back to back

Sliding through your city, whatchu on bae?
Been a long day
Run it up, I'm tryna put yo on, bae
Pull up on me, I ain't see you all day, damn
I ain't tryna take no picture, and pose for the gram
I just pulled up on the Benz, skirt off in the Lamb
And baby, I am who I am
Made it happen, ain't come with a plan
She say she my biggest of fans
She makin' it clap but ain't used his hands, damn
How the fuck she did that? Gotta get it on cam'
I get way too high, can't wait till I-
