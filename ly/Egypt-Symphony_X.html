		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Endless sands of Alnantees - etched in
gold, a city lost in time
and from the Sea - A Child speaks of
things unseen,
before the King - a teller of the Rhyme

Five align - hidden in the word a
message locked in time
find the Key - it draws the final line
between what is and what should never
be

Gaze in these eyes my child and see -
here by my side, you're destined to be
Fears in the night flee with the Sun - if
we are One
Kingdom of Gold I lay at your feet -
Ruler of Time and Space you will be
Rivers of Truth forever will run - if we
are One

From the ruins of Atlantis, the Lord of
Night rises from the sands
He seeks the one - his serpent's tail and
twisted tongue -
a bringer of War - Destroyer of the land

Five align - hidden in the word a
message locked in time
find the Key - it draws the final line
between what is and what should never
be

"Rise my minions - from within the deep
abyss
my disciples - thunder this necropolis"

Gaze in these eyes my child and see -
here by my side, you're destined to be
Fears in the night chasin the Sun - now
we are One
Kingdom of Gold now lay at my feet -
Ruler of Time and Space I will be
Rivers of Lies forever will run - now we
are One
