		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I get to thinking
And I can't control
Thoughts on my mind
They're playing on my soul
When I know what I'm believing
And it keeps me strong
People of the world
We've got it going on

And I said hey, what are you thinking
And I said hey, we got to get together
Feel the love now

I wanna sing it out louder
Wanna scream and shout it
We got to get together
Feel the love now
I wanna sing it out louder
Wanna scream and shout it
We got to let this love in

Sure there's gonna be some times
You'll get it wrong
Don't let it get you down
You gotta move along
And when you let the light of hope
Free your mind
All around the world
The sun is gonna shine

And I said hey, what are you thinking
And I said hey, we got to get together
Feel the love now

I wanna sing it out louder
Wanna scream and shout it
We got to get together
Feel the love now
I wanna sing it out louder
Wanna scream and shout it
We got to let this love in

Stand up
Come on and put your hands up
Never gonna give up
We got to get together
Feel the love now

Stand up
Come on and put your hands up
Never gonna give up
We got to get together
Feel the love now

I wanna sing it out louder
Wanna scream and shout it
We got to get together
Feel the love now
I wanna sing it out louder
Wanna scream and shout it
We got to let this love in
