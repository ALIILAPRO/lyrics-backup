		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This ain't what your mother told you, it's night and day
If you're waitin' for a sign to come and hold me
Well, you might as well spend all your night guessin' (oh)
If this ain't what your mother told you, forget what she said (oh-ooh)
If you want this to be real, then show me you want me
Don't play it safe with me (no, love)

Won't work if I'm numb
Won't stop if I love
Who hurts if you don't?
Don't fall from these heights
Won't stop if you won't
Won't learn if you don't
Who else could get me
To fall from these heights?

I don't know where you are, but I don't wanna go to sleep, babe
I know you care, but please, don't take it easy on me, babe
Ooh-ooh, hey
I could be fallin', flyin', I wouldn't know the difference

There's no way that I'll say that I did wrong
But it won't hurt, and now I know that you could be mine
Well, it's taken a while to know what's
Between love and lust
No matter what, you know I love the words
Do what you want, I can't even say what's in my head (hm-mm)

Won't work if I'm numb
Won't stop if I love
Who else could get me
To fall from these heights?

I don't know where you are, but I don't wanna go to sleep, babe
I know you care, but please, don't take it easy on me, babe
Ooh-ooh, hey
I could be fallin', flyin', I wouldn't know the difference

I don't know where you are, but I don't wanna go to sleep, babe
I know you care, but please, don't take it easy on me, babe
Ooh-ooh, hey
I could be fallin', flyin', I wouldn't know the difference
