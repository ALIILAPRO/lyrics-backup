		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been looking all around
Try to figure out what the hell really counts
When everything feels like it's fillin
Up with doubt thoughts heading south
And no one can hear me shout
And the voices in my head so loud
Calm before the storm like a Seattle cloud
The sky so gray try to figure it out
Why I'm so down in this sunlight drought
Yea memories coming back to me
Of a simpler time when I was young and free
Playing games with the kids lived next to me
Didn’t care about time or anything yea
But things Change turned twenty three
Had to figure out what the
Hell was next for me
Do I do the safe thing something guaranteed
Or do I do what I love till my fingers bleed

It’ll all be ok figure out my own way
But for now here I lay and remember a day
When I was young when I was young

Smoke stacks 'cause it's cold outside
Fire burning from the other night
I can smell the coals in my soul
It makes me feel something deep Inside
Memories of a better life
Memories where I felt alive
In these time you can choose to survive
In these times you can choose to thrive
And I wanna make something take something
Take control of my life and display something
Show the world what I love
And go play something
Show the world what I love
On a stage strumming
And I wanna make y’all feel the same
And I wanna take away all the pain
At least for a minute while I play
I wanna make you feel ok

It'll all be ok figure out my own way
But for now here I lay and remember a day
When I was young when I was young
