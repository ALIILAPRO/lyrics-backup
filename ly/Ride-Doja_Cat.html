		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, where is your jealousy? Why won't you cry?
(Why won't you cry?)
This is what's telling me you took me for a ride
And baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride
And baby, you drive me up the wall and down with lies
And baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride
And baby, you drive me up the wall and down

Boy, I'm lookin' at you, don't walk away
Comin' home at like two, then four, then eight
Boy, you lookin' like you don't know my name
Every day you wanna butter me up
Then, you're pushin' me out the way
Yeah, now you wanna be a bad boy, papa
You ain't a man, you're just a handsome knock-off
I saw you sneakin', tryna plant one on her
Oh, you mad all the sudden?
'Cause your man got my number (yeah)
I wish you saw what I saw in you
Never open that door to you and give it all to you
How the fuck I wasn't on to you?
Man, it's a round of applause, but I'm warnin' you, boo

Where is your jealousy? Why won't you cry?
(Why won't you cry?)
This is what's telling me, you took me for a ride
And baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride
And baby, you drive me up the wall and down with lies
And baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride
And baby, you drive me up the wall and down

Maybe I'm a toy 'til you wind me
I be on the run 'til you find me
Bad ting, I don't wanna badmind me
Can't wait 'til you realize, finally
Big mouth but the steam on tiny
I been seein' everythin' unwindin'
And I bought all of your chains in a fistful
Rollie dead on your wrist, untimely
Baby, need somebody to trust in me
Need somebody to love on me, baby, baby, oh
Low key, I love it when you talk to me
But I don't wanna be your one-night thing
Help me, can we? Oh

Where is your jealousy? Why won't you cry?
(Why won't you cry?)
This is what's telling me, you took me for a ride
And baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride
And baby, you drive me up the wall and down with lies
And baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride
And baby, you drive me up the wall and down
