		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She told me add the bassline (Yeah)
And everything will be fine
She told me add the sound of the drums drums
To set the mood and foundation
She told me add the bassline (Oh yeah)
And everything will be fine
She told me add the sound of the drums
To set the mood and foundation (Yeah)

Sweet sounds of July
Sweeter than a blackberry pie
Sweeter than the breeze of the night
The gat plays hit the rewind
Oh here's the Rhodes
Minor 9 insatiable
Sharp 11 losing control
Now here's the vocal (Hey)
Baby let it take over
Ridiculous flow
Meticulous glow
And limitless growth

I got the bassline
I got the drumming drums
And I don't waste time
I'm singing them songs
I got the bassline
I got the drumming drums
And I don't waste time
I'm singing them songs (Yeah)

She told me add the bassline
And everything will be fine
She told me add the sound of the drums
To set the mood and foundation (Yeah)

Let it groove to the soul
Blind it with specifics in the goals
Find out which the illest who knows
Play the beats ganking at the shows

Let the bassline fly
Frequency emotion through the skies
Storms of melodies in the eye
Havoc on the speakers all night

Some rumble to the burst
Everybody's got the groove curse
Everybody's got the groove curse
Everybody's got the groove curse
