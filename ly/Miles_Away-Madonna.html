		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're miles away

I'm not messing about, I've got a mile of self doubt
Yeah, you're not even close yet,
Because you're miles away
Another day in bed, sorting out your head
You don't know what you're thinking about 

You're not right all of the time
Its funny when you're wrong 

You're miles away, no one can stop me
So far, it's funny when you're falling over 

You're the robot voice, and the people's choice
Yeah, you blink and it goes wrong
Because you're miles away
You're not even warm, human after all
You don't know what you're talking about 

You're not right all of the time
Its funny when you're wrong 

You're miles away, no one can stop me
So far, it's funny when you're falling over, oh! 

I'm too skint to pay my debtors
Uh-oh un-opened letters
Feels like a siege I'm under
How did you get my number?
Oh oh, it's for the better
Than on the never ever
I'll get back and back and back
And back and back and back, around we go 

You're miles away, no one can stop me
So far, it's funny when you're falling over 

Miles away, no one can stop me
So far, it's funny when you're falling over 

You're not right all of the time
It's funny when you're wrong 

You're not right all of the time
It's funny when you're wrong
