		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You want to curse us?
You little maggot, this is the last time you will see your fucking planet
You want to curse us?
So come and see if you can reach up to everything you wanted to be
You have been chosen by me to experience the last thing you will ever see
The sound of your agony will fill my ears with ye

Yo, I don't think you will be happy 'cause it's something only for the few
Curse you
Lick my fucking fingers
Come discuss about the end of all known life
Your life is worth nothing anymore right now
Do you still think you are something better then me, you fuck?
You've ruined everything for yourself
So don't think I am the reason for your death

Motherfucker, now you slowly feel it all slipping away from you
You want it all, but now you get nothing except for lead
Bullets to your face, bullets to your heart

Don't try to get out
It's way too late to change something
You will be cursed by us
You will be nobody
Curse us
Take us
Hunt us
Skin us
Do what you want with our heads

No, I don't care if you say this is way too much
No, I don't think that you have suffered enough
Do you know that I don't really give a fuck?
Do you really want to curse us?
You better watch out
'Cause we'll be around you even if you are dead
Pick out the best ones
'Cause they will do everything we want them to
Curse us, curse us, curse us

We will do something that you all can't ignore
This is what we all have been waiting for
Now it's time to suffer
Oh, you son of a bitch, you're fucked
Fuck
Yes, you fucking are, motherfucker

Y'all can never fucking kill me, you cowards
'Cause I am the fucking cursed one

Pricks
What's up motherfuckers
This is it
