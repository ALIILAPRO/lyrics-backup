		  Blame it on the Goose (Goose)
Gotcha feelin' loose (loose)
Blame it on the 'Tron ('Tron)
Got you in the zone (zone)
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol 

Hey she say she usually don't (don't, don't)
But I know that she frontin' (frontin', frontin')
'Cause shawty know what she want (want, want)
But she don't wanna seem like she easy
I hear you sayin' what ya won't do (won't do, won't do)
But you know we probably goin' do (gon' do, gon do')
What you been fiendin' deep inside (don't lie now)

Girl what you drinkin'?
Gon' let sink in
Here for the weekend, thinkin' we can
See what we can be if we press press forward
Just one more round and you're down, I know it
Fill another cup up
Feelin' on yo butt, what?
You don't even care now
I was unaware how fine you was
Before my buzz set in
My buzz set in

Blame it on the Goose (Goose)
Gotcha feelin' loose (loose)
Blame it on the 'Tron ('Tron)
Got you in the zone (zone)
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol 

Blame it on the vodka (ayy)
Blame it on the Henny (ayy)
Blame it on the blue tap (ayy)
Gotcha feelin' dizzy (ayy, dizzy)
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol 

Oopsie
She spilled some drank on me (on me, on me)
And now I'm knowin' she's tipsy (tipsy, tipsy)
She put her body on me
And she keep starin' me right in my eyes
No tellin' what I'm gon' do (gon' do, gon' do)
Baby I would rather show you (show you, show you)
What you been missin' in your life when I get inside

Girl what you drinkin'?
Gon' let sink in
Here for the weekend, thinkin' we can
See what we can be if we press fast forward
Just one more round and if you're down, I'm pourin'
Fill another cup up
Feelin' on yo butt, what?
You don't even care now, I was unaware how
Fine you was before my buzz set in
My buzz set in

Blame it on the Goose (Goose)
Gotcha feelin' loose (loose)
Blame it on the 'Tron ('Tron)
Got you in the zone (zone)
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol 

Blame it on the vodka (ayy)
Blame it on the Henny (ayy)
Blame it on the blue tap (ayy)
Gotcha feelin' dizzy (ayy, dizzy)
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol (hey)
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol

T-Pain
Girl, I know you feel good
Just like you look (look), couple more shots
You open up like a book, I ain't trippin ('cause I'ma read ya)
Shawty, I ain't trippin' (I jus' wanna please ya)
I'ma take a shot of Nuvo, shawty, didn't you know
It's goin' down, we can go and kick it like Judo (Judo)
You know what I mean
Shawty got drunk, thought it all was a dream
So I made her say I, I
Now she got her hand on my legs
Got my seats all wet in my ride (all wet in my ride)
All over my ride (all over my ride)
She look me dead in the eye, eye-eye
Then my pants got bigger
She already knew what to figure
Had her lookin' at her boyfriend like, "Fuck, that nigga"

Blame it on the juice (Goose)
Gotcha feelin' loose (loose)
Blame it on the 'Tron ('Tron) (oh-ooh woah)
Got you in the zone (zone)
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol (alcohol)
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol (alcohol)

Blame it on the vodka (ayy)
Blame it on the Henny (ayy)
Blame it on the blue tap (ayy)
Gotcha feelin' dizzy (ayy, dizzy)
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol (alcohol)
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol

Now to the ballers poppin' bottles (ayy)
With they Henny in they cups (ayy)
Screamin, "Money ain't a thing", if it ain't (ayy)
Throw it up in the sky (in the sky) (ayy)
And hold your drinks up high (high)
And to my independent mama's
Who can buy they own bottles
If you lookin' like a model
When them broke fellas holla, tell 'em, "Bye" (bye)
And hold your drinks up high

You could blame it on the Goose (Goose)
Gotcha feelin' loose (loose)
Blame it on the 'Tron ('Tron)
Got you in the zone (zone)
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol 

Blame it on the vodka (ayy)
Blame it on the Henny (ayy)
Blame it on the blue tap (ayy)
Gotcha feelin' dizzy (ayy, dizzy)
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
