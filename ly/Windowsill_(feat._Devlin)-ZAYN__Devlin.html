		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuckin' on the countertop, window to the floor
She been on my mind, that's for she to tie the rope

She with me when I flow, she with me when I don't
Fuckin' on the countertops, elevated her
She can ride me blind, I'll give anything she want
I'll never let her know, so she come back for more
Are you done yet? 'Cause I'm right here
Are you waitin' for the right time to call me back?

Cigarettes and fuckin' on the windowsill
In my bed, yeah, tell me when you're gettin' here
Only thing I wanna know, oh
Is how far away you are
Cigarettes and fuckin' on the windowsill
Break the glass, go and show me how you really feel
Cut me deep and sew it up
That's the way you show me love

I see the way she lookin' like she lookin' in my soul
Like, stop it, maybe this could lead to something that I won't

She with me when I flow, she with me when I don't
Fuckin' on the countertops, elevated her
She can ride me blind, I'll give anything she want
I'll never let her know, so she come back for more
Are you done yet? 'Cause I'm right here
Are you waitin' for the right time to call me back?

Cigarettes and fuckin' on the windowsill
In my bed, yeah, tell me when you're gettin' here
Only thing I wanna know, oh
Is how far away you are
Cigarettes and fuckin' on the windowsill
Break the glass, go and show me how you really feel
Cut me deep and sew it up
That's the way you show me love

Your cigarettes on the windowsill
You left here from the night before
I take one, never light it up
Night comes and I want you more
So I don't play dumb
If the rain comes, it will more than pour
But I don't want no fake love, just a real freak when I'm on than board
And I'm waitin', impatient
All I can do is man my station
When the body is that hot, it's a curse, damnation
And there ain't no salvation
This girl could walk though hell
And I'm sure she tempt Satan, if she ain't the devil herself

Cigarettes and fuckin' on the windowsill
In my bed, yeah, tell me when you're gettin' here
Only thing I wanna know, oh
Is how far away you are
Cigarettes and fuckin' on the windowsill
Break the glass, go and show me how you really feel
Cut me deep and sew it up
That's the way you show me love
