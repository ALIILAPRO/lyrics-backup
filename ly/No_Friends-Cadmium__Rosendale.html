		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  People say I try too hard
People say I come off really awkward
You know I don't mean no harm
I'm just trying to be myself but

Sometimes I get confused
'Cause I can't read social cues
Threw my inhibitions out the door
I don't have an excuse
I'm just living in my youth
Don't know why people don't like me more

I have no friends but that's okay
I don't need them anyway
I do my best all on my own
And I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone

I have no friends but I'll be fine
I don't need them to pass the time
And when I put my resting bitch face on I look stone cold
I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends

I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone

I have no friends but that's okay
I don't need them anyway
I do my best all on my own
And I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends

You'll never know what's on my mind (my mind)
You'll never know the secrets that I'm keeping
I'll scare you off with my crazy eyes (my eyes)
'Cause all I need is me myself and

I don't got no shame
'Cause my life is just a game
And I don't care who's been keeping score (oh, no)
Everybody thinks I'm strange
It's just something in my brain
Don't know who they're being normal for

I have no friends but that's okay
I don't need them anyway
I do my best all on my own
And I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone

I have no friends and that's a sign
I don't need them to pass the time
And when I put my resting bitch face on I look stone cold
I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends
No friends

I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone

I have no friends but that's okay
I don't need them anyway
I do my best all on my own
And I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends

I don't need anybody's hand to hold at night
As long as I'm with me I know I'll be alright
'Cause I can't love no one else
Spent my love on just myself
Took this people-pleaser heart
And I tore it all apart
Now I'm finally set free
I'm so proud to be me
That's why I don't care I just wanna say
I have no
La la la la la
No friends
La la la la la
La la la la la

I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone

I have no friends but that's okay
I don't need them anyway
I do my best all on my own
And I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends

No friends
No friends
(I'd rather be alone)
No friends
All I need is me myself 
No friends
I have no friends
