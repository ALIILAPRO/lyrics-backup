		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You must be happy with yourself
You think you're so much better than me
Why do you love to see me fail so much
'cause on that day you crawl back on your knees
Tell me who will save you

When there's no one else around
And you can't turn to me
Tell me where will you be
When it's over
And all this pride you hold inside
Is gone
Tell me where will you hide
When it's over
And everything you know is said and done
When it's over, where will you run

Do your memories haunt your dreams
Do they simply seem to have a mind of their own
Tell me what the emptiness brings
When everything you know is everything but gone
Tell me who will save you

When there's no one else around
And you can't turn to me
Tell me where will you be
When it's over
And all this pride you hold inside
Is gone
Tell me where will you hide
When it's over
And everything you know is said and done
When it's over, where will you run

You can't hold your world together now
Everyone sees who you really are
When your castle crumbles at your feet
Don't you run to me

When it's over
And all this pride you hold inside is dying
Where will you hide?
When it's over
And all this pride you hold inside has died
Tell me where will you hide
When it's over
And everything you know is said and done
When it's over, where will you run?
