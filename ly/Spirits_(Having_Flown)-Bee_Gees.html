		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never fell in love so easily
Where the four winds blow I carry on
I'd like to take you where my spirit flys
Through the empty skys
We go alone, never before having flown

Faster than light'ning is this heart of mine
In the face of time I carry on
I'd like to take you where my rainbow ends
Be my lover friend
We go alone, never before having flown

I am your hurricane
Your fire in the sun
How long must I live in the air
You are my paradise
My angel on the run
How long must I wait
It's the dawn of the feeling
That starts from the moment you're there

You'll never know what you have done for me
You broke all those rules I live upon
I'd like to take you to my shangri-la
Neither here or far away from home
Never before having flown

I am your hurricane
Your fire in the sun
How long must I live in the air
You are my paradise
My angel on the run
How long must I wait
It's the dawn of the feeling
That starts from the moment you're there

There I'd like to take you where my spirit flys
Through the empty skies we go alone
Never before having flown
