		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This ain't a joke
This ain't a joke
Devil be coming for throats
Don't you approach
Unless you been down with the ghost
After your soul
Tryna cook you like a roast
Listen up close
I'm tryna make sure that you know
Big bad wolf tryna kick it
Wanna fatten me up like a piglet
I am not the ham sandwich at the picnic
I'm a sheep so I know I'm on the hitlist
Devil just pulled up and popped
But my house built on a rock
I got them weapons that come from the heavens
You fight against GOD you get mopped
For real
Devil start talking go open the Bible
And stand on the word
That's a cheat code
Tear down the lies that he put in your mind
With the scripture now that is a veto
Devil might know me too well
He ringing my bell
I look through the peephole
But he will never prevail
The story will tell that God is my hero
This ain't a joke
Devil be coming for throats
Don't you approach
Unless you been down with the ghost
After your soul
Tryna cook you like a roast
Listen up close
I'm tryna make sure that you know
Devil gone creep
Waiting for the moment you for get that you weak
Turn the heat up like 90 degrees
Only way to beat him is to follow the King
He already got the victory
Tell the Devil keep the same energy
I can see the trickery
He is not the one that he pretend to be
Only one really with divinity
You are just the enemy
Bout to be destroy for infinity
And Beyond
We on Jesus, Champion
Was peon, Be he brung freedom from Kingdom
So be gone
No blessing the devil, We just sneeze on
Allergic like some people to pecans
To you, Ah-choo
Then shoo like a fly over my food
I feel alive when by God step his foot in the room
He play chess to your checkers
Calculated the moves
When he return back to earth you'll be meeting your doom
This ain't a joke
Devil be coming for throats
Don't you approach
Unless you been down with the ghost
After your soul
Tryna cook you like a roast
Listen up close
I'm tryna make sure that you know
