		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Paralyzed
And never coming back
Even when your eyes are open
Everything turns to black

Soon forgotten senses
Incubates the soul
Hiding from the light fantastic
Waiting for the show

Contemplation
Reality starts to fade
Creeping stare behind dead eyes
As the minutes burn the day

Inactive wandering
Still can't get a grip
Can God hear your cry
Before you start to slip

Chasing fear
Human mind unglued
Unaware
That fear is chasing you

Endless waiting
For nothing to appear
Even when your eyes are shut
The visions are so clear

Harmonious dissidence
Obscure reckoning
Did you hear that final note
Of silent suffering

Chasing fear
Human mind unglued
Disappear
The sickness inside of you

Chasing fear
Nothing you can do
Unaware
That fear is chasing you

Loss of function
Withering of the will
Condemned to a state of nothing
Moving in for the kill

Brain cells slowly boil
With memories intertwined
Listening to that empty space
Atrophy of the mind

Chasing fear
Human mind unglued
Disappear
The sickness inside of you

Chasing fear
Nothing you can do
Unaware
That fear is chasing you
