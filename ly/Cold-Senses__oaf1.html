		  (ivvY LeaguE) oh, oh
I don't know what I did wrong
Or why you're so cold
I just wanna feel whole
So please let me know

I don't know what I did wrong
Or why you're so cold
I just wanna feel whole
So please let me know
Turn my heart into stone
You're the reason I froze where will she go?
No nobody knows
I don't know what I did wrong
Or why you're so cold
I just wanna feel whole
So please let me know
Turn my heart into stone
You're the reason I froze where will she go?
No nobody knows

Catch me, 'cause I'm falling
You could text me, it's an option
Are you okay? Right now
Got a headache, turn the lights out
I’m all in, you're folding
I forgot what you told me
Buying drugs like they're groceries
We're not friends, you don't know me
Fuck the goalie get the ball and I go score
2020 did me wrong I am so bored
Counting money on the train I feel like Lorde
Even though you bring me pain
I'm still all yours

I don't know what I did wrong
Or why you're so cold
I just wanna feel whole
So please let me know
Turn my heart into stone
You're the reason I froze where will she go?
No nobody knows
I don't know what I did wrong
Or why you're so cold
I just wanna feel whole
So please let me know
Turn my heart into stone
You're the reason I froze where will she go?
No nobody knows
