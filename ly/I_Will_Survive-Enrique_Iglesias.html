		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You like to think
That you're the only one
Who understands my needs
And you tell everyone
That I can't live without you
Even for one day
But who gave you the right
To talk about the way
I feel so deep inside?
Now I realize
You were never mine 
We were never right
Baby you will find

I will survive
I'm gonna make it through
Just give me time
I will get over you
I will survive
No matter what you do
Just wait and see
I will get over you
'Cause baby I will survive
'Cause baby I will survive

What makes you think
That I don't see the ways
You made a fool of me?
Don't laugh behind my back
'Cause what goes around
I promise you comes back
Now I realize
You were never mine
We were never right
Baby you will find 

I will survive (oh yeah)
I'm gonna make it through
Just give me time (just give me time)
I will get over you
I will survive (I will survive)
No matter what you do
Just wait and see
I will get over you
'Cause baby I will survive

I will survive
I'm gonna make it through
Just give me time
I will get over you
I will survive
No matter what you do
Just wait and see
I will get over you

I will survive (I will survive)
I'm gonna make it through
Just give me time
I will get over you
I will survive
No matter what you do (no matter what you do)
Just wait and see
I will get over you

I will survive 
I will survive
I'm gonna make it through
I will survive, yeah
I will get over you

'Cause baby I will survive
