		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just came in here to have some whiskey and
Beer and to say howdy to you all
Now you all know me, this is Hank Jr, you see
Hat and shade beard and all
Now I have heard, mmm hmm
I've gotten the word about all these silly
Imposters running 'round
Let me tell you something
Now they ain't real
They ain't got no scars
They ain't got no feel why they don't know
Nothing about whiskey bent and hell bound

Now I'm looking for a lover and
I'm looking for some fun
My name is Bocephus, I'm a son of a gun


Some of us are born with it
Some of us don't ever ever get it
Thank God I'm a guitar man
And it's true I love the money
And it's true I love all the honeys
But the thing I really love is
To get down with the band

Not everybody loves me but those
That do will fight
Right to the end they're guitar
Friends from legendary Saturday nights
I learned something from Lynyrd Skynyrd
From my Daddy and Ernest Tubb too
I do country-rock, I do blues

Now I'm looking for a lover and
I'm looking for some fun
My name is Bocephus, I'm a son of a gun

Some of us are born with it
Some of us don't ever ever get it
Thank God I'm a guitar man
And it's true I love the money
And it's true I love all the honeys
But the thing I really love is
To get down with the band

Oh boy, ain't no rookies on this record
I say my name is b-O-C-E-P-H-U-S
