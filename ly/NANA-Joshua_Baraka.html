		  Oh Nana baby 

You know I wanna love you daily 

You know you're my one and only 

I wanna love you till I can't no more 

More more  

 

My girl  

She a Cinderella dance till her shoe fall off 

She nah care for money even you're big and tough 

She do it for the love 

She a likkle shy 

Till she tipsy,dirty dancing yeah 

Nana you already know 

When I see you it's going down for sure 

No PDA Girl this ain't for show 

What we do nobody gat to know 

Nana you already know 

When I see you it's going down for sure 

No PDA Girl this ain't for show 

What we do nobody gat to know 

 

Oh Nana baby 

You know I wanna love you daily 

You know you're my one and only 

I wanna love you till I can't no more 

Oh Nana baby 

You know I wanna love you daily 

You know you're my one and only 

I wanna love you till I can't no more 

More more 

 

 

Gano Mazima baby nze sikulimba 

Naye guno Omukwano sigwakutimba 

Byona tubikole naye nga tuli feka 

 you and I don't even tell your bestie Gina 

Evil eyes around we should keep it on the low 

Sing songs for you yeah you're my angel 

I give the world to ya baby call me Caesar  

When you see me turn a little girl you're such a teaser 

Pleaser 

Nana you already know 

When I see you it's going down for sure 

No PDA Girl this ain't for show 

What we do nobody gat to know 

 

Oh Nana baby 

You know I wanna love you daily 

You know you're my one and only 

I wanna love you till I can't no more 

Oh Nana baby 

You know I wanna love you daily 

You know you're my one and only 

I wanna love you till I can't no more 

More more
