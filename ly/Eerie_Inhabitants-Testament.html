		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Intro & Guitar Solo]

A world of chaos
A world of fear
A world of anger and corruption
When all is lost
And millions starve
Is this humanity's destruction?

Life! A game that people play
Cryout! Will they see another day?

No one help us,
The children pray
Nobody listens to their crying
This great depression
When will it end?
To live like this is worse than dying

Life! A game that people play
Cryout! Will they see another day?

Your destiny is over
Your fate has declined
Refuse to discover
What so many could find
Death's endless toil
As I long for rest
Life's now forsaken
Condemned to repress!

[Guitar Solo]

No sign of Heaven
No sign of Hell
Just the sign of pain and sorrow
This generation inhabits all
To form an order for tomorrow

Life! A game that people play
Cryout! Will we see another day?
