		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm about to put a hurtin' on a bitch soul
We took an eighth of psilocybe, let it all go
Stuck in the middle of the earth, it ethereal
I'm bout to take a little
Trip and never come home
She dug a knife up in my
Chest until the blood flow
I'd rather lick it off
And swallow every drop, oh
Everybody thinkin' I'm the devil
But I'm really woke
By woke I mean I'm not susceptible to
Brain control but I know that
She tied a knot up in the gum with the tongue
Make me wanna take another
Cigarette in my gun
I'm sick of puttin' it in my mouth
Just saying fuck it I'm done
I know I never be the one
To say the devil won
'Cept for one mage if I'm gonna be a Teller
Like I'm really feelin' like I'm
Tryna dip and reincarnate
I look up in the sky, and I think
When I'm done
I really wanna take a dive in the
Lake and say goodbye to everything

Fuck a halo, keep a heater with you
Pocket rocket
Pop and hope your people with you
Leave 'em bloody red, really ain't an issue
Think his auntie sad, get that bitch a tissue
Heard his army mad, I could give a fuck
All my compas pulling up in armored trucks
You be talkin' Migos, but ain't one of us
Hit a fifty cell, really I'm the plug
Just another day in the 6-1-4
Now they in Columbus talkin' Mexico
Choppin' up the kilo then we slittin' throats
Trap be in the kitchen cookin' up a GOAT
No that ain't no slang for a fuckin' pack
Even if it was, boy, you couldn't cap
Even if you did, it'd hit you with the tax
Shout out all my homie, made a mill' off wax

Yuh, yuh, ayy
Death by dishonor, you crossed the wrong one
Your wig get pushed back
Underground Underdog need ten flat to
Be in the same room pop by the cut with a
Stick and the stained booth
Fuck what you heard, baby, I've been around
Po-po 'round, we need a moment of silence
Runnin' from the piece to get
Away from the sirens
Ain't a damn thing changed 'cause
We love the violence
Baby Bone, I'm an animal
Made a hundred thousand racks at the Seminole
Eat a rapper up sick like I'm Hannibal
Got a bitch right off of the banana boat
Shakewell, make bail, set sail
Send a rapper to Hell
Broke ass rappers, man, they want me to fail
I made all the right moves
I'm never taking an L

Yeah, yeah usually, I would just make the
Decision to kill 'em
Rest is for the willin' when
You on the ceiling
Will he ever give a dividend again?
I'm moving diligent, this independent, mane
A minimum of dank, I'm on a bigger rank
I thank the lord for every saint
I can't describe a cannibal
I eat a rapper chapter one
I get up on you, read you like a poem
Shit is sticky since I got a system
I'm a killer, make a million off of this
(yeah)
That's how deep the pen and coffin is (yeah)
So all my villains break a law to this (yeah)
Pray your lord forgives a kid with confidence
I count the karma for my sons in orphanage
I'm bringing all them in 'til we all begin
There's no bargaining so quit arguin'
