		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give you this, give you that
Blow a kiss, take it back
If I looked inside your brain
I would find lots of things
Clothes, shoes, diamond rings
Stuff that's driving me insane

You could be preoccupied
Different date, every night
You just got to say the word
But you're not into them at all
You just want materials
I should know because I've heard
When girls say

I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy
I want, I want, I want, and that's not me
I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you

You've got everything you need
But you want accessories
Got to hold it in your hand
If I changed the world for you
I bet you wouldn't have a clue
Don't you know that I can't stand
When girls say

I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy
I want, I want, I want, and that's not me
I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you

Oh, and all the girls say

I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy
I want, I want, I want, and that's not me
I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you

Be loved by you
I wanna, I'll stay true
I wanna, if you knew
What you put me through
But you want, you want, you want me to love you too

I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy
I want, I want, I want, but that's not me
I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you

Oh, and all the girls say

I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy
I want, I want, I want, and that's not me
I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you
I want, I want, I want, and all the girls say
I want, I want, I want, and that's crazy
I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you
