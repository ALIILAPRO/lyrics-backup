		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been spending some time
Thinking I'd be alright
Don't know if I could
Really make it tonight

Lie awake in the dark
Come down then I start
Thinking about you
Is almost breaking my heart

I don't know where I went wrong
Or what's going on
Baby I feel like
Our love's lost tonight

Should I stay, should I go
Well I really don't know
Lately I've been missing you so

Baby, you don't understand
Our love lies lost
But you're still
Holding my hand

Oh and then you walk away
Just tonight
I want you to stay

You're turning me on
You turn me around
You turn my whole world
Upside down

You're turning me on
You turn me around
You turn my whole world
Upside down

Every time I hurt you
Well it's hurting me too
Don't know if
I could really stay here tonight

Tired of thinking of you
And everything that you do
Tell me what am I supposed to do
Well I just wanted to say that

I need you today
Tell me it's all gonna work out alright

I don't know where I should start
But with all of my heart
Baby let me
Be your lover tonight

Baby you don't understand
Our love lies lost
But you're still
Holding my hand

Oh and then you walk away
Just tonight
I want you to stay

You're turning me on
You turn me around
You turn my whole world
Upside down

You're turning me on
You turn me around
You turn my whole world
Upside down

Oh you know you're turning me on
You turn me upside down 
You turn me around
you know you're turning me on
You turn me upside down 

You're turning me on
You turn me around
You turn my whole world
Upside down

You're turning me on
You turn me around
You turn my whole world
Upside down

You're turning me on
You turn me around
You turn my whole world
Upside down

You're turning me on
You turn me around
You turn my whole world
Upside down
