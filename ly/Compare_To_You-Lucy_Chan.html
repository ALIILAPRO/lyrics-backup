		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't believe that it's true
I guess I've fallen for you
My hearts all about you
Think you feel it too

Everywhere that I go
You're there, where's my loophole
I guess what we've got is hard to find
And you're all that's on my mind

Oh, and I'll never be like that
With anyone but with you, it's a fact
I know that I'm a mess without you here
When I'm with you there's not a thing I fear

Seems like all the time in the world slows down
When I'm with you, wish I was your girl
Nothing in this world will ever compare to you
Compare to you

Sunday nights I spend with you
Heaven knows this love is true
Twin flame kind of evening
We're singing in your car, driving

Feel fearlessly brand new
Every day since March of 22'
You shine a bright light through
No time for anything but you

And I'll never be like that
With anyone but with you, it's a fact
I know that I'm a mess without you here
When I'm with you there's not a thing I fear

Seems like all the time in the world slows down
When I'm with you, wish I was your girl
Nothing in this world will ever compare to you

Oh and I'll never feel like that again
Unless I'm with you it's a fact
I know that I'm a mess without you here
When I'm with you there's not a thing I fear

Seems like all the time in the world slows down when I'm with you
Wish I was your girl
Nothing in this world will ever compare to you
Compare to you

Oh, I think that it's you
