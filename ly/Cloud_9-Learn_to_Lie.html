		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  With my eyes closed, I'm soaring
I try to take it in
Ride this cloud with me
It's like we're running
But my feet don't touch the floor
I try to take it in
Before it blows away
My words are tripping over my tongue
I feel like I've been standing here too long
It's in my fingertips and down to my toes
I'm feeling out of my mind and it shows
With my eyes closed, I'm soaring
I try to take it in
Ride this cloud with me
It's like we're running
But my feet don't touch the floor
I try to take it in
Before it blows away
Before it blows away
Away
Away
Away
Away
It's like I'm falling
And that's okay
It's like I'm falling
And that's okay
With my eyes closed, I'm soaring
I try to take it in
Ride this cloud with me
It's like we're running
But my feet don't touch the floor
I try to take it in
Before it blows away
I try to take it in
Ride this cloud with me
It's like we're running
But my feet don't touch the floor
I try to take it in
Before it blows away
