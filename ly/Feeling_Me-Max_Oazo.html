		  Feeling me baby
Give it up, give it up
This could be something, ain't enough (Ain't enough)
Feeling me baby
Give it up, give it up
This could be something, ain't enough (Ain't enough)

I know you been feeling me baby
Won't you give it up
And we both know that this could be something
But that ain't enough
'Cause when the leaves are falling down (Are falling down)
I need to see you'll be around (Be around)

I gotta know that you'll be there
Give it up, give it up
You gotta show me that you care, ain't enough (Ain't enough)
I gotta know that you'll be there
Give it up, give it up
You gotta show me that you care, ain't enough (Ain't enough)

Feeling me baby
Give it up, give it up
This could be something, ain't enough (Ain't enough)
Feeling me baby
Give it up, give it up
This could be something, ain't enough(Ain't enough)

I gotta know that you'll be there
Give it up, give it up
You gotta show me that you care, ain't enough (Ain't enough)
I gotta know that you'lll be there, give it up
You gotta show me that you care, ain't enough

I gotta know that you'll be there
Give it up, give it up
You gotta show me that you care, ain't enough (Ain't enough)
I gotta know that you'll be there, give it up
You gotta show me that you care, ain't enough (Ain't enough)
