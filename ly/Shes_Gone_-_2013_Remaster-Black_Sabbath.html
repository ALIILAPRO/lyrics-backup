		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been a long, long time, waiting for you 
I didn't want to see you go, oh, no, no 
And now it's hurting so much, what can I do? 
I wanted you to be my wife 

The days are passing slowly, since you've gone 
Your memories are all I have, yes, I have 
I sit here waiting, but you'll never show 
Without you, I can't carry on, ooh, my baby 

You said you'd always love me, all of my life 
And then you said your last goodbye, yeah, goodbye 
Why the sudden changes? Why all of the lies? 
I should have seen it in your eyes 

The endless hours of heartache waiting for you 
My summer love has turned to rain, oh, the pain 
The silent emptiness of one-sided love 
My life means nothing now you've gone, ooh, my baby
