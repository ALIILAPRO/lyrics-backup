		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bare bones, I'm half of what I was
I thought I was careful
But it wasn't enough
Don't you let me go
Baby, I can tell
You're enjoying the power that you have
Just be careful, you might bleed me out

You're a shot to the chest
I don't know what to do (ooh)
And I keep fighting myself
While I'm fighting for you (ooh)
I used to look for every exit sign
But it's too late now to get out, so
I keep fighting myself
While I'm fighting for you

Floating around in troubled waters
Knowing the edge is around the corner
But I won't let go
Baby, you can tell
That I'm too foolish for my own best
Hopelessly searching for nothing

You're a shot to the chest
I don't know what to do (ooh)
And I keep fighting myself
While I'm fighting for you (ooh)
I used to look for every exit sign
But it's too late now to get out, so
I keep fighting myself
While I'm fighting for you

I used to look for every exit sign
But it's too late now to get out, so
I keep fighting myself
While I'm fighting for you
