		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's twilight and I wake up hot 
My body's soaked in a cold, cold sweat 
I reenact the lurid scenes 
And clawed engravings in my head 

Oh, I can't punch hard enough and I run 
I can't kick high enough and I run 
I can't shoot straight enough and I run 
I can't hold on enough and I run 
Oh, I can't stay down enough and I run 
I can't take pain enough and I run 
I can't bleed fast enough 
I can't die dead enough 

The air is thick, but the oxygen's thin 
My heart is beating like a drum, boom! 
And ice is flowing through my veins 
Explosives on my lips and in my lungs 

Oh, I can't punch hard enough and I run 
I can't kick high enough and I run 
I can't shoot straight enough and I run 
I can't hold on enough and I run 
Oh, I can't stay down enough and I run 
I can't take pain enough and I run 
I can't bleed fast enough 
I can't die dead enough 

I don't know what I'm running from 
And I don't know where I'm running to 
There's something deep and strange inside of me I see 

I don't know what I'm running from 
And I don't know where I'm running to 
Something's compelling me to run into the dark 

And now I am more driven than before 
And now I live just to settle score 
And now I feel the nearness of your breath 
Now I introduce you to your death  

I am more driven than before 
I live just to settle score 
I feel the nearness of your breath 
I introduce you to your death 
I can't punch hard enough 
I can't kick high enough 
I can't shoot straight enough 
I can't hold on enough 

I can't stay down enough, die dead enough 
I can't take pain enough, die dead enough 
I can't bleed fast enough, die dead enough 
I can't die dead enough, die dead enough
