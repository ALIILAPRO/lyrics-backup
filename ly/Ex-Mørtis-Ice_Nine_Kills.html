		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, God damn

Deep, deep down in the forest
A resurrection awaits
May God have fucking mercy
When these five poor fools press "play"

On a tape that's draped in dread
Can you hear the Evil Dead singing

"A cold wind blows as the angels cry
The living will descend and the dead will rise
From way below, way below, way below"
Well, God damn

Deep, deep down in the cellar
Feel your spirit disengage
May God have fucking mercy
'Cause you just have to turn the page

With the woods all splattered in red
Can you hear the Evil Dead singing

A cold wind blows as the angels cry
The living will descend and the dead will rise
From way below, way below, way below
So go, go, go, don't wave goodbye
We're saving you a seat where the dead don't die
From way below, way below, way below
The woods are alive

So cross the Book of the Dead off your reading list
(Necronomicon ex-mortis)
Join the Army of Darkness, don't resist
(Necronomicon ex-mortis)
Now you'll choke on your words
Swallow this

Groovy

A cold wind blows as the angels cry
The living will descend and the dead will rise
From way below, way below, way below
So go, go, go, don't wave goodbye
We're saving you a seat where the dead don't die
From way below, way below, way below
Singing

A cold wind blows as the angels cry
The living will descend and the dead will rise
From way below, way below, way below
So go, go, go, don't wave goodbye
We're saving you a seat where the dead don't die
From way below
