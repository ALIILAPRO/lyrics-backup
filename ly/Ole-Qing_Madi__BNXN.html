		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah
Out in the rain my loner (yeah, yeah)
Put am for head, they say I'm selfish
Out in the rain once more, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Washam away my feelings dirty
I'm just craving on somebody's babe
Oh no no
I can't get that love, love for myself

Say, everybody's fine but they can't be you (ahh)
Even if they wanted to do
Even if they try as they envy you (ahh)
But you belong to someone
And I'm singing
I'm just craving for somebody's babe
Oh no no
I can't get that love, love for myself

Ole ole
Pack all my things come stay your house
Put am for head I'm a loner
Ole ole
Na pressure me, na pressure na
If na your babe I want am
Ole ole
Pack all my things come stay house
Put am for head I'm a loner (ole, ole, baby, wait before you)
Na pressure me, na pressure na (ole, ole)
If na your babe I want am (ole, ole)

Baby, wait before you interject
You got the right impression, baby, I'm impressed
The feelings choke e wan dey suffocate
But you carry man and I came with my babe
Before the camera catch me for 4k, mh
Kato bere foreplay
Something wey go sweetie my body, mh
If later you call but not later than half past six
My girl won't like this (yeah, yeah)
Make group chat dey talk e my gist
Come try this hopeless romantic
But deep down we should not be doing this
Kin to pari o
I know you dey feel like Ronaldinho
Shey you wan do mission impossible
I hope you know
Nobody has to know

Ole ole
Pack all my things come stay your house
Put am for head I'm a loner
Ole ole
Na pressure me, na pressure na (ole o)
If na your babe I want am (ole)
Ole ole
Pack all my things come stay house
Put am for head I'm a loner (ole, ole)
Na pressure me, na pressure na (ole, ole)
If na your babe I want am (ole, ole)
