		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please tell me what is taking place
'Cause I can't seem to find a trace
Guess it must have got erased somehow

Probably 'cause I always forget
Every time someone tells me their name
It's always gotta be the same

(In my World)
Never wore cover-up
Always beat the boys up
Grew up in a 5000 population town

Made my money by cutting grass
Got fired by fried chicken ass
All in a small town, Napanee

You know I always stay up without sleepin'
And think to myself
Where do I belong forever
In whose arms, the time and place?

Can't help if I space in a daze
My eyes tune out the other way
I may switch off and go in a daydream

In this head my thoughts are deep
But sometimes I can't even speak
Would someone be and not pretend? I'm off again in my World

I never spend less than an hour
Washin' my hair in the shower
It always takes 5 hours to make it straight

So I'll braid it in a zillion braids
Though it may take all friggen day
There's nothin' else better to do anyway

When you're all alone in the lands of forever
Lay under the milky way
On and on it's getting too late out
I'm not in love this time this night

Can't help if I space in a daze
My eyes tune out the other way
I may switch off and go in a daydream
In this head my thoughts are deep
But sometimes I can't even speak
Would someone be and not pretend? I'm off again in my World

Take some time
Mellow out
Party up
But don't fall down
Don't get caught
Sneak out of the house

Can't help if I space in a daze
My eyes tune out the other way
I may switch off and go in a daydream

In this head my thoughts are deep
But sometimes I can't even speak
Would someone be and not pretend? I'm off again in my World

Can't help if I space in a daze
My eyes tune out the other way
I may switch off and go in a daydream

In this head my thoughts are deep
But sometimes I can't even speak
Would someone be and not pretend? I'm off again in my World
