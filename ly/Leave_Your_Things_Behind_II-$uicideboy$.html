		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a sense of meaning
In the nonsense that you say
There's a sense of meaning
In the nonsense that you say
Crazy I subliming
As my heart becomes your prey
Crazy I subliming
As my heart becomes your prey
There's a sense of meaning
In the nonsense that you say
There's a sense of meaning
In the nonsense that you say

Allow me to collect myself
I'm all over the place
Put my brain on the shelf, throw me away
(Throw me away)
My hands always hiding my face
Never knew why
I guess it's 'cause I feel erased
Sever new ties
I'm best when I feel I'm replaced
Get the glue
Might have to clean up this mess tonight
Black skies, not a star in sight
That's why I get scarred from light
My demons escape to the place
Where there's blue skies
They leave me behind with no trace
Get the noose tied my neck snapped
And my body hangs in the new light
The end only comes when it's time

Baby, I've longed to see you
Baby, can't think of nothing but you
I'm caged in, walls cave in
Sinking I, I can't swim
Do you think of me when you're fucking him?
Do you think of (Fuck)
'Cause it's only you I want
I'm hurt, and I can't front
Seems like I can't get enough
Of you ripping me apart
You got me broken and on my own
Hopin' you call my phone
Wait, you're blocked
'cause I'm trying to move on
To be frank, I fell in love with a ho
But, I need you
