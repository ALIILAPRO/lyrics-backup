		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ooh, ooh)

I wanna thank the storm that brought the snow
And thanks to the string of lights that make it glow
But I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas

It barely took a breath to realize
We're gonna be a classic for all time
I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas

Sweet gingerbread made with molasses
My heart skipped and I reacted
Can't believe that this is happening
Like a present sent from God
Sleigh bells singing Hallelujah
Stars are shining on us too

I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas

Thought I was done for, thought that love had died
But you came along, I swear you saved my life
And I wanna thank you, baby
'Cause you make it feel like Christmas

Sweet gingerbread made with molasses
My heart skipped and I reacted
Can't believe that this is happening
Like a present sent from God
Sleigh bells singing Hallelujah
Stars are shining on us, too

I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas

I never thought I'd find a love like this
But I found forever in that very first kiss
I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas
Oh (oh, thank you, baby)

I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas
