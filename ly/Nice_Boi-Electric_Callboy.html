		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It is a fact, I've always tried to fulfill their needs
Just a fact, they treated me like shit indeed
They made me a misfit, they made me a loser
Made me a puppet, need someone to abuse but
You never meant to be their enemy
Instead of this that's how they'd like you to see
Ignore the treachery, you have to deal with it
Kill this switch, one day this sick kid's killin' it

I'm such a nice boy
Got this knife in my hand
Wanna end your life
I hope you understand

I wanna rip your fucking face off
(Face off)
I got your blood on my hands
(I got your blood on my hands)
At anytime you wanna face off
(Face off)
Then I'll make you confess
(Then I'll make you confess)

Hello again, I know we barely know each other
But it's a fact, they always judge a book by its cover
I've tried to be perfect, I just need a friend
Ask myself if it's easier to be someone else but
What is broken sometimes can't be fixed
So tear down their walls, every punch is like a brick so
Ignore the treachery, you have to deal with it
Kill this switch, one day this sick kid's killing it

I'm such a nice boy
Got this knife in my hand
Wanna end your life
I hope you understand

I wanna rip your fucking face off
(Face off)
I got your blood on my hands
(I got your blood on my hands)
At anytime you wanna face off
(Face off)
Then I'll make you confess
(Then I'll make you confess)

So, fuck all the wannabes, fuck all the hate you feel
Make a decision and turn into something real
You know you're not alone
Take your chance, reach your goals
Nothing can hold you back
Fuck
Fuck
Nothing can hold you back
Nothing can hold you back
Fuck
Fuck
Nothing can hold you back

I wanna rip your fucking face off
(Face off)
I got your blood on my hands
(I got your blood on my hands)
At anytime you wanna face off
(Face off)
Then I'll make you confess
(Then I'll make you confess)

I'm such a nice boy
Got this knife in my hand
Wanna end your life
I hope you understand
