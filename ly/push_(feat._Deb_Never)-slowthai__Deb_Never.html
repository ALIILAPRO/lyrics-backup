		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Out of the dark he found a road
To quietly walk alone
Harder the days he learned to know
The calm comes after the storm

Sit back and watch the rain
Breathe out before tomorrow
Slow down before you break
And you're cast aside

Meet me at the back of the bus
Beep beep with my hat and my gloves
See me, I'm erratic on drugs
Do stuff I regret, feel embarrassed tomorrow
Wah gwan? What ya under?
Far side of the yonder, far cry from a younger
Hard times made me stronger
And these drinks makes me drunker, drugs made me fonder (yeah)
Selling drugs gets you richer
That's a royal flush on the river
Go HMP for a winter, I grew up 'round toxic
And people can't see 'cause they live in a pond with some dumb fish
I was with sharks outside the park
When it's dark, lighters spark, nobody wanna try it with us
Pop out like a jack-in-the-box saying, "This what you wanted?"

Same ones that'll praise you up
Be the same ones to say you're done, it's all love
Non-stop, you get cropped like bud
'Cause no one wanna see you blossom on top
From the bottom, yeah, I climbed a lot
And people tryna break my thumbs, what's good?
Be the barber, gotta line it up
When push comes to shove, you gotta push

System lagging, think we need a reboot
Feeling stranded, got me feeling feeble
You're never there when I really need you
Always land on my feet like a cat out a tree
Watch it crumble to sand while I'm gritting my teeth
Shit flies with the magpies
He drowned, got baptized
Oh well, I guess that's life
So now I gotta pass time
So quiet, hear a penny drop
Riot in my head and it's loud as fuck (ah)
Fuck the people tried doubting us
I fall on my knees with my hands to God
Bite the hand that feeds you
If I said I loved you I would never leave you
If I said I loved you it's because I need you
Call you pancake like I need my treacle

Same ones that'll praise you up
Be the same ones to say you're done, it's all love
Non-stop, you get cropped like bud
'Cause no one wanna see you blossom on top
From the bottom, yeah, I climbed a lot
And people tryna break my thumbs, what's good?
Be the barber, gotta line it up
When push comes to shove, you gotta push

Sit back and watch the rain
Breathe out before tomorrow
Slow down before you break
And you're cast aside
