		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never in your motherfuckin' life (never)
Everything fuckin' with this (swear to God)

Ayo, all I had was a plan, a product, and the people to pitch it to (uh-huh)
Apple bags in a small corner store, digital (what up?)
Ambition to get it all, 'cause broke is brother to miserable
Death is they daddy, if you dumb, then you probably missed a jewel (stupid)
This is school for fools seekin' inspiration
A cool masterclass in murder, don't accept no cheap imitations (nah)
Your chick chasin', left her knees with chafin'
You know the steez, after I hit her with D, she passed the Chase PIN (money)
Pay to pocket, these 85erss try to watch it
Though they dumb and deaf and got limited sight in they optics (uh-huh)
Get shot movin' on some opp shit (bah, bah)
Bein' on top is the only option
You viewed as a flop if you not king
Stay on point or niggas be robbin' you for your watch, ring and choker chain
Know the game choose the dough over savin' a Lois Lane
That road is lame, hell no, we don't flow the same (nah)
My mark on the track is like pus out a open vein (ugh)
You hope I came to play, but I didn't
I'm more vicious, catch you eatin' food for thought
Blow your brain on the dishes (bah, bah, bah, bah)
Another rapper gettin' slain, it's tradition
I had to listen to my intuition to make it out of the flames of hell's kitchen
I hear a snake hiss, they disguise it as well-wishin'
I been around friend or foe and I can tell the difference
Gettin' dirty dough off a zoe lately been the religion (uh-huh)
My right palm itchin', strong wisdom, on rhythm

I put it all on the table (uh-huh)
I'm able to leave your vital signs unstable
We fire at ya idle mind, it's me first before they pay you (bah, bah, bah, bah)
Born king, understood I was a god at day two (uh-huh)
I put it all on the table (yeah)
I'm able to leave your vital signs unstable
Fire at ya idle mind, it's me first before they pay you (bow, bow, bah, bah, bah)
Born king, understood I was a god at day two

Niggas think this shit is sweet
I roam streets with chrome heat
And always keep one in the dome piece
Fuckin' with me ain't safe
Get caught up at the wrong time at the right place in the right space
My trigger finger got the itch
My Glock came with a switch
I finger-fuck the shit 'cause life's a bitch
I keep the honeys comin' quick, money comin' quicker
Got these funny-ass niggas feelin' real bitter
It's the ones that smoke blunts witcha
In the picture, now they wanna grab their gun and come and get ya
Trust me, Joey won't slip
I got the big four-five with the hollows loaded in the clip, huh
So you better stop, look and listen
'Cause you the one to be a victim on my opposition
Bless my enemy and rob him for his ammunition
Now any weapons formed against me, surely missin', uh

I put it all on the table (uh-huh)
I'm able to leave your vital signs unstable
Fire at ya idle mind, it's me first before they pay you (bah, bah, bah, bah)
Born king, understood I was a god at day two (uh-huh)
I put it all on the table (yeah)
I'm able to leave your vital signs unstable
Fire at ya idle mind, it's me first before they pay you (bow, bow, bah, bah, bah)
Born king, understood I was a god at day two

Ayy, yo
