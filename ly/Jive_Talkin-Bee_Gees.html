		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's just your jive talkin'
You're telling me lies, yeah
Jive talkin'
You wear a disguise
Jive talkin'
So misunderstood, yeah
Jive talkin'
You really no good

Oh, my child
You'll never know
Just what you mean to me
Oh, my child
You got so much
You're gonna take away my energy

With all your jive talkin'
You're telling me lies, yeah
Good lovin'
Still gets in my eyes
Nobody believes what you say
It's just your jive talkin'
That gets in the way

Oh my love
You're so good
Treating me so cruel
There you go
With your fancy lies
Leavin' me lookin'
Like a dumbstruck fool
With all your

Jive talkin'
You're telling me lies, yeah
Jive talkin'
You wear a disguise
Jive talkin'
So misunderstood, yeah
Jive talkin'
You just ain't no good

Love talkin'
Is all very fine, yeah
Jive talkin'
Just isn't a crime
And if there's somebody
You'll love till you die
Then all that jive talkin'
Just gets in your eye

Jive talkin'
You're telling me lies,yeah
Good lovin'
Still gets in my eyes
Nobody believes what you say
It's just your jive talkin'
That gets in the way

Love talkin'
Is all very fine, yeah
Jive talkin', just isn't a crime
And if there's somebody
You'll love till you die
Then all that jive talkin'
Just gets in your eye, yeah yeah

Oh jive talkin'
Jive talkin'
Oh jive talkin'
