		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna say goodbye
Baby won't you give me just a second chance,
Cause I just need another try
Played so many games with you
And now I know I've been so wrong

And when you're not around
Always puts me down
Never knew I'd feel so lonely
Now I need you by my side
Cause only you can make my world
Go on and on and on.

Can't get over, I can't get over you
Tell me you will come back baby
Can't get over, I can't get over you
Tell me you will come back baby

I don't wanna say goodbye
Baby won't you give me just a second chance,
Cause I just need another try
Played so many games with you
And now I know I've been so wrong

And when you're not around
Always puts me down
Never knew I'd feel so lonely
Now I need you by my side
Cause only you can make my world
Go on and on and on.

Can't get over, I can't get over you
Tell me you will come back baby
Can't get over, I can't get over you
Tell me you will come back baby
