		<p>
		  yo this shi-
yo this beat sound like uhh
ahh this sounds like transfor- 
nah nanananah 
sound like 
uhhhhhh

godzilla 
just bitch slapped your drug dealer 
toronto winters 
big chillin in my chinchilla 
6 figures 
told the label needa  send it quicker 
before i bill up, brush my teeth do and i do 10 sit ups 
talking sweet like swishers
boy you isnt that Nigga
talkin big 
like you been him 
I BEEN HIMMA
black hummer 
straight from a black beamer
2 seater
who's sweeter than me ?

i told my opp i got a mop to sweep you off of your feet 
at 9 o clock she sent the drop and then we turn on your street 
we spint the block a couple times and then we put it in P
i cock my glock it stroke my ego no one cocky as me 

i told my mama that im gonna be someone
someday 
she said you gotta find your path i said 
i know one way
but mama wanted me to stay far away from the gun play 
but mama know i don't listen to nothing 

trap kept jumping !
runners kept running 
then i turned on the mic and i found i amount to something 
now a nigga stunnin !
my teachers astonished 
i wasn't a scholar but i went ahead and got it 

i wasn't a scholar but the trap taught me math 
wayne taught me english, lil bit of swag
unc taught me how to fuck hoes
dad taught me cash
now i sing the cocaine blues - johnny cash 

now ima,
 bag droppa
tag poppa 
pill seller 
slick comments fuck around and log off ya 
gucci sweater 
only wear it if the weather awful 
margiela coffin 
i better be buried proper

chinnychinchillin in my chinchilla fur coat
balling like omega and my belt on ferragamo 
that means 24 for you niggas that didn't follow 
told the officer that i ain't steal the car man i just borrowed 
big bottle 
pour on models 
she swallow 
ima big baller
rolling L's ain't no lanzo 
but a nigga from toronto i ain't smoke unless there's fronto
  
asap no rocky 
i'm popping 
if you don't like
why don't you try and stop me 
that's right you here
and i'm rodeo shopping 
say that they'll remember you
i don't see no poppy's 

IM
GODZILLA
JUST BITCH SLAPPED YOUR DRUG DEALER
TORONTO WINTERS BIG CHILLIN IN MY CHINCHILLA
6 FIGURES TOLD THE LABEL NEEDA SEND IT QUICKER
BEFORE I BILL UP NEEDA 
aw yeah 

literally been listening to that on repeat
talkin big like you been him i been himmer
that's LITERALLY my new life motto
talking big like you been him ????
i been himmer

BEEN HIMMA 
SO THESE BITCHES WANNA TAKE MY PICTURE
MAKE IT QUICK I GOT A PACK I GOTTA GO & PICK UP
AND THEN DELIVER 
TILL MY POCKETS ON DOUG DIMMA
TALKIN BIG LIKE YOU BEEN HIM
I BEEN HIMMA
