		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Migo gang, we in the building
Yo!
Now I'm bossin' this shit, you know what I'm sayin'
Turn up!

Yo! Jumpin', jumpin', jumpin', jumpin'
Jump jump, jumpin'
My man always jumping in the gym
No basketball though

Jumping out da gym'
Jumping out da gym
No Clyde Drexler, money jumping out da gym
Jumping out da gym
Jumping out da gym
No Dominee, money jumping out da gym, gone


Money above the rim
Borough bag tewies
Man jumping out da gym no show and kill
Back then she want me now I gotta salt it
'Cause she's seen on Quevo first up in a Aston Martin
Hurricane wrist watch young Quevo break the pot
In the vila shootin' nothing but money, drawn shots
Can nobody tell me come my goon like secret service
Pull up, pop the trunk, it's a flock of birdies
Smoking on purge, I ain't worthy
Sipping on P like Kerby
Already know she thirsty
So I put her in the kitchen dancing dirty
Already know he a coward
Already know he sour
He a snake in the grass so I had to cut him off
I call that Georgia Powell
Looney kick it like that dog
Quit the spraying nigga like lights off
Don't get mad at me 'cause I smash your bid then I passed her like clippers
Hell no, I need no label
A hundred badges sittin on the table
Play your card so good in the hood
I go kiss it, blow a gang in Decatur

Jumping out da gym
Jumping out da gym
No Clyde Drexler, money jumping out da gym
Jumping out da gym
Jumping out da gym
No Dominee, money jumping out da gym, gone

Eighty piece teeth, Jabal with the creese
Shit look who it is, the white don my nigga
Got my nigga Rook in mo dough than Homer Simpson
I can ban ball and tell my stories then that Rumplestil
Blow, out of shine get, but I still diamond glisten
Woo we are twisted, my stereo's roof missin'
Forty k on wrist and I'm ballin' Philly
I done shot mo jumpers than that power pistol
I'm Kevin Garnet except I don't even break a sweat
I'm flyin' lil jet, all glass clear shit
Me and Migos stackin' C notes, DJ Drama
We're on vacation, we sky scrapin' in east Bahamas

Jumping out da gym
Jumping out da gym
No Clyde Drexler, money jumping out da gym
Jumping out da gym
Jumping out da gym
No Michael Jordan, money jumping out da gym, gone

So I don't really care about the day
Man I'm jumpin out of jail with a chain
Who is shot like Arum Abdul Jabar
I lit up like man ultra bar
Twenty bands on me, got my need
Shoot a nigga, lights out, Peter Pete
And I called her bird Beyonc√©
Kinda looked good and you know they gon sing
Thirty ball court and Bernard King
Got fire, got birds, got weeds
We been dreamin with the stirs on the Denim
I dropped three, it wasn't nothing but Jamilas
Many jumpin' ut of jail, y'all many
Do it short so my little to a pickle
And a nigga keep it still like sturdy
Back again monster truck do the robbery scene
In the pan where the words all derr
Got loud kush and that purp
It's still on with a hoe free fire
You go 'cause I up my eye
Shootin' jump side like Brett Berry, Cal Corvin just to tear it
And then a nigga try to take my cal
No passin' trouble, we ready

Jumping out da gym
Jumping out da gym
No Clyde Drexler, money jumping out da gym
Jumping out da gym
Jumping out da gym
No Dominee, money jumping out da gym

On the jail stretchy landings, how I does it nigga?
Got a plug down the loo, don't even use it nigga
Got a plug in every city for my shoes nigga
Walk in the store with straight cash, nigga no issue
They like T James, there's my nigga
You a real nigga but I'll always fuck wit you
My reply is always humble, nigga never brag
Tell that cute bitch show me where the loving's at
You want them Jordan's nigga
I'm on the amp man
Tryin' to bother me ain't safe, nigga F bad
You're slippin' on the fly, nigga call it jetlag
Money makin' moves nigga, call it step back
James

Jumping out da gym
Jumping out da gym
No Clyde Drexler, money jumping out da gym
Jumping out da gym
Jumping out da gym
No Dominee, money jumping out da gym, gone

Jumping out da gym
Jump Jumping out da gym
No steering wheel, money jumping out the gym
