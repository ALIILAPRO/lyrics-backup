		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, it's okay to be
A little broken and beat
But I'm alright with that
You're with me, relax
And you call it weak
Baby, you're just unique
Come out of the black
Never hold it back

You got such sad eyes, turn blue to grey
And it hurts me to see you hurt this way

Oh, go on and cry, baby, crybaby
'Cause you don't have to keep it inside (just cry, just cry)
Go on and cry, baby, crybaby
And there's no reason you got to hide (just cry, just cry)
A real man shows his feelings
Tears they can be healing
And I can be your savior tonight
So go on and cry, baby, crybaby
Just cry

You keep coming home drunk
And I don't know what's up
You can talk to me
Spare those whiskey dreams
Don't have to man up
That phrase kinda sucks
Let yourself be free
And open up to me

You got such sad eyes, turn blue to grey
And it hurts me to see you hurt this way

Oh, go on and cry, baby, crybaby
'Cause you don't have to keep it inside (just cry, just cry)
Go on and cry, baby, crybaby
And there's no reason you got to hide (just cry, just cry)
A real man shows his feelings
Tears they can be healing
And I can be your savior tonight
So go on and cry, baby, crybaby
Just cry, oh

Nothing's the end of the world
Feeling this pain and it's gonna be alright
One day you'll look back and know
It wasn't worth all the heartache
This could be the making of you
So let it all out, let it fall down, yeah

Oh, go on and cry, baby, crybaby (let me see you cry)
'Cause you don't have to keep it inside (just cry, just cry)
Go on and cry, baby, crybaby (let me see you cry)
And there's no reason you got to hide (just cry, just cry)
A real man shows his feelings
Tears they can be healing
And I can be your savior tonight
So go on and cry, baby, crybaby
Just cry, oh

Sweet darling
Let it all out
