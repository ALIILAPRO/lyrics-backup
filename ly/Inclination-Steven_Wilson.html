		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come see the fool
He'll swindle you out of the game
Bow down to him
But don't ever give him your name

He stole it from somebody else
He can fake it forever
The sugar and void in the holdall
It's pulling me down to your level

One at a time I will take you all on
If you've got the time then I've got the inclination

Don't hold it back
Just say what you really think
Ah-ah
One at a time, please spare me
It's the open season, yeah

You gave me a part in a movie
And I gave you a target to aim at

One at a time I will take you all on
If you've got the time then I've got the inclination

(Inclination)
(Ah-ah-ah)
(Inclination)
(Ah-ah-ah)
(Inclination)
(Ah-ah-ah)
