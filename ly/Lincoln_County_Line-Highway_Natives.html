		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need a moment just to slow things down
Feels like my life seems to blow right by
I could wait on the world to stop its turnin'
Or I could I just take a drive
Cross that Lincoln County line
Top of Halls Gap into Ottenheim
Where the moonshine drinks like water
And the air is sweet as wine
Time moves a little slower
In those grassy fields of blue
Cross that Lincoln County line
I'm comin' home to you
Head off of 40 onto 65
Wait for the static on the radio
Hang right to exit on the parkway drive
Bout a hundred miles left to go
Till I cross that Lincoln County line
Top of Halls Gap into Ottenheim
Where the moonshine drinks like water
And the air's as sweet as wine
Time moves a little slower
And your mind can rid the blues
Cross that Lincoln County line
I'm comin' home
Comin' home to you
If I could only stay I know
I'd plant a tree and watch it grow
But livin' out there on the run
Keeps me on this lonely road
But one of these day I'll slow it down
Plant both feet there on the ground
Till they carve my name in stone,
And lay me down
Cross that Lincoln County line
Top of halls gap into Ottenheim
Where the moonshine drinks like water
And the air is sweet as wine
Where time moves a little slower
In those grassy fields of blue
Cross that Lincoln County line
I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home
