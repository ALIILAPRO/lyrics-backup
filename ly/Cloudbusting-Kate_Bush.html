		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I still dream of Orgonon
I wake up crying
You're making rain
And you're just in reach
When you and sleep escape me

You're like my yo-yo 
That glowed in the dark
What made it special 
Made it dangerous
So I bury it 
And forget

But every time it rains
You're here in my head
Like the sun coming out
Ooh, I just know that something good is gonna happen
I don't know when
But just saying it could even make it happen

On top of the world
Looking over the edge
You could see them coming
You looked too small 
In their big, black car
To be a threat to the men in power

I hid my yo-yo 
In the garden
I can't hide you 
From the government
Oh, God, daddy
I won't forget

'Cause every time it rains
You're here in my head
Like the sun coming out
Ooh, I just know that something good is gonna happen
I don't know when
But just saying it could even make it happen, ohh

And every time it rains
You're here in my head
Like the sun coming out
Look, your son's coming out
Ooh, I just know that something good is gonna happen
I don't know when
But just saying it could even make it happen, ohh

Ooh, just saying it could even make it happen

Yeah-yeah-yeah-ohh
We're cloudbusting, daddy
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yo
Yeah-yeah-yeah-ohh
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yo
Yeah-yeah-yeah-ohh

Your sun's coming out 
Yeah-yeah-yeah-ohh
Your son's coming out
