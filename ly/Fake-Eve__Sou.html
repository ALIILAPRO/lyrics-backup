		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm just your play thing
If you wanted me you'd try to invite me
And you'd entice me
If I wanted to I could probably have you but
You never wanted me
And now I
And now I
If I wanted to I could probably have you but
You never wanted me
And now I
And now I
Got a whole new group
Of friends who knew who you were
Before I even knew
And I made the first move
'Cause you wouldn't do it first
No you never do
I'm just your play thing
If you wanted me you'd try to invite me
And you'd entice me
If I wanted to I could probably have you but
You never wanted me
And now I
And now I
If I wanted to I could probably have you but
You never wanted me
And now I
And now I
I'm just your play thing
If you wanted me you'd try to invite me
And you'd entice me
If I wanted to I could probably have you but
You never wanted me
And now I
And now I
I'm just your play thing
If you wanted me you'd try to invite me
And you'd entice me
If I wanted to I could probably have you but
You never wanted me
And now I
And now I
