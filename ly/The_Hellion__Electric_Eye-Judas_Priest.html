		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Up here in space)
(I'm looking down on you)
(My lasers trace)
(Everything you do)

You think you've private lives
Think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape
I'm watching all the time

I'm made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean

I'm elected, electric spy
I'm protected, electric eye

(Always in focus)
(Can't feel my stare)
(I zoom into you)
(But you don't know I'm there)

I take a pride in probing all your secret moves
My tearless retina takes pictures that can prove

I'm made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean

I'm elected, electric spy
I'm protected, electric eye

(Electric eye) in the sky
(Feel my stare) always there
There's nothing you can do about it
Develop and expose
I feed upon your every thought
So my power grows

I'm made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean

I'm elected, electric spy
I'm protected, electric eye
I'm elected, electric spy
I'm elected protective, detective, electric eye
