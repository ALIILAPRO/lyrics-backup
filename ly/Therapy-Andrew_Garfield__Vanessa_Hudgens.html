		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel bad, that you feel bad
About me feeling bad, about you feeling bad
About what I said, about what you said
About me not being able to share a feeling

If I thought that what you thought
Was that I hadn't thought about sharing my thoughts
Then my reaction to your reaction
To my reaction would have been more revealing

I was afraid that you'd be afraid
If I told you that I was afraid of intimacy
If you don't have a problem with my problem
Maybe the problem's simply co-dependency

Yes, I know that now you know
That I didn't know that you didn't know
That when I said, "no", I meant, "yes, I know"
And that now I know that you knew that I knew you adored me

I was wrong to
Say you were wrong to
Say I was wrong about
You being wrong

When you rang to say that
The ring was the wrong thing to bring
If I meant what I said
When I said rings bored me

I'm not mad that you got mad when I got mad
When you said I should go drop dead, ooh
If I were you when I'd done what I'd done
I'd do what you did when I gave you the ring
Having said what I said

I feel bad, that you feel bad (I feel badly about you)
About me feeling bad, about you feeling bad
About what I said, about what you said (feeling badly about me)
About me not being able to share a feeling (feeling badly about you)

If I thought that what you thought (I thought)
Was that I hadn't thought about sharing my thoughts (you thought I)
Then my reaction to your reaction (reacted shallowly)
To my reaction would have been more revealing (when I reacted to you)

I'm not mad that you got mad that I got mad (I'm not mad, you got mad)
When you said I should go drop dead (go drop dead)

If I were you when I'd done what I'd done (if I were you)
I'd do what you did when I gave you the ring (but I'm not you)
Having said what I said (said what I said)

But now it's out in the open
Now it's off our chest
Now it's 4AM
And we have therapy tomorrow
It's too late to screw
So let's just get some rest
