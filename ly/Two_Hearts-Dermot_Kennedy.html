		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We open up at the station on a freezing night
He said, "Honey, I can't do more than a brief goodbye
How could our farewell mean as much as our time?
Honey, I'll be gone, it's better if I'm something that
That you leave behind"
That you leave behind

See, what it was, was a reason to believe in life
What it was, was a week spent under sleepless skies
But sometimes life ain't fair and a love has to die
Her sunny smile was gone, started feeling like something that
That she needs to hide
That she needs to hide

Oh, what a beautiful feeling
To love and know love in return
Oh, but when time gets to stealing now
Two hearts, and one love for one girl

She says, "I'm stuck in the spaces where the demons hide
I've got love, and I've got patience, don't I deserve to smile?
I used to paint these tress now I just scream at the sky"
Honey, I was wrong, guess there's certain things you never
You never leave behind
You never leave behind

Oh, what a beautiful feeling
To love and know love in return
Oh, but when time gets to stealing now
Two hears, and one love for one girl

And so we jump to the theatre in that same old town
She sees his face, and he sees her as the lights go down
The life that they should have had sat between them that night
She left before the lights came on, through the snow she saw him
Already waiting outside
Could love outweigh the pain tonight?

Oh, what a beautiful feeling
To love and know love in return
