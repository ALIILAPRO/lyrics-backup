		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A chill runs up your spine
It crawls into your brain
The freezing touch of fear

It's driving me insane
Although you try to fight
Dragged from the silence where you hide
'Til you... Scream

Scream
I can't wait to hear you
I can't wait to hear you
Scream

It's driving me insane
Although you try to fight
Dragged from the silence where you hide
'Til you... Scream

Scream
I can't wait to hear you
I can't wait to hear you
Scream
