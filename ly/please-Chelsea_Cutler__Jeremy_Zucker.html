		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're still in the shower
Don't know where you're gonna go
I wish I had the power
To make this house feel more like home
I won't sleep a minute
Leave the light on by the bed
The bed you should be in, yeah
It's not how it's supposed to end

Please don't leave me here
I don't know where I started
Please don't leave me here
I don't know where my heart is

I'll see you when I see you
It hurts, you'll never know
'Cause maybe you'll come running
When you're done being alone
I swear I'll wait forever
If it means not letting go
I'll put you under pressure
Were you scared of getting close?

Please don't leave me here
I don't know where I started
Please don't leave me here
I don't know where my heart is

All these bridges that we're burning
Tables that we're turning
I won't let this go to a middle ground
Promises you're breaking
Parts of me you're taking
I don't know myself when you're not around

Please don't leave me here
I don't know where I started
Please don't leave me here
I don't know where my heart is
