		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf, arf
Thraxx
Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf, arf
Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf, arf
Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf

(Yeah)
Well, hey, I guess it's my turn (okay)
When I come around these niggas better fuckin' learn (wassup?)
Pour milk into the ashes, then I drink it out the urn (huh?)
Live fast, die young, 'til I crash and I burn (huh, huh?)
To do it better, make me, your hands is lookin' shaky
You're sweeter than a pastry, lil' nigga, better face yo' fears (okay)
You can't outpace me when you lookin' so shaky
Back up for your own safety, lil' nigga, better wipe yo' tears (okay)
HK G36 to the ribs (what?)
Should I cop the Glock or should I cop the newer Sig? (Yeah)
Should I buy a goat or should I buy a fuckin' pig? (What?)
Doors off the jeep down the street where I live (dirt)
Only white gold, I don't like yellow piss (okay)
Fuckin' white hoes and then they gettin' dismissed (okay)
Last boy tried to do a hit and he missed (haha)
Shot him in the mouth and now he talk just like this (okay)

Life's short, death's long, so whatever (arf)
Life's short, death's long, so whatever (arf)
Life's short, death's long, so whatever (arf)
Life's short, death's long, so whatever (arf, arf, arf)

Issa dog, boy, I need a new chew toy (okay)
Make him swallow teeth and now he look like Andy Roy (okay)
We was eatin' steak while you was eatin' fuckin' soy (uh-huh?)
The dogs don't acknowledge all you little puppy boys (huh, huh, huh?)
It goes arf, arf, arf, arf, arf, like a bitch (what?)
Back to the green like the ESP Grynch (okay)
Pull up on your team and I put 'em in a pit (wassup?)
Back to ally and we dig a fuckin' trench, aye (what?)

Life's short, death's long, so whatever (arf)
Life's short, death's long, so whatever (arf)
Life's short, death's long, so whatever (arf)
Life's short, death's long, so whatever (arf, arf, arf)
Life's short, death's long, so whatever
Life's short, death's long, so whatever
Life's short, death's long, so whatever
Life's short, death's long, so whatever
