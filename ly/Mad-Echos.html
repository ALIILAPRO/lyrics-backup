		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna throw you off
I've been keeping my mouth shut
I've been feeling so closed off
'Cause I'm fucking mad at you
I don't wanna speak my mind
You've been pushing me too far
Tried to keep it all inside
But I'm fucking mad at you

You love to say i can't feel this way, oh
I'm so close to breaking down

(I'm fucking mad) my head is spinning
I think I'm losing my control
My body's shaking can't take it
(I'm fucking mad) my mind is blanking
Don't tell me I should let it go
I'm a time bomb put it off for too long
Watch me explode my head is spinning
I think I'm losing my control
My body's shaking can't take it
(I'm fucking mad) my mind is blanking
Don't tell me I should let it go
I'm a time bomb put it off for too long
Watch me explode

Used to care if I hurt you
But holding all this pain hurts me more
All the things you put me through
Yeah, I'm still fucking mad at you

King of Disappointment echos
New Eyes echos
Saints echos

You love to say i can't feel this way, oh
I'm so close to breaking down

(I'm fucking mad) my head is spinning
I think I'm losing my control
My body's shaking can't take it
(I'm fucking mad) my mind is blanking
Don't tell me I should let it go
I'm a time bomb put it off for too long
Watch me explode my head is spinning
I think I'm losing my control
My body's shaking can't take it
(I'm fucking mad) my mind is blanking
Don't tell me I should let it go
I'm a time bomb put it off for too long
Watch me explode

Fuckin' mad at you fuckin' mad at you
Fuckin' mad at you fuckin' mad at you
