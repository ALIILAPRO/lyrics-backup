		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's the end of the road
And I'm hanging by a wire
On a street with no name
And my feet are getting tired

You set me free
You set me free

I feel like a star when we do it like this
A shot in the dark, but I know I can't miss
The heavens are far, but they've given me wings
It's some kind of beautiful, some kind of beautiful
I'm lost in your eyes and it's five o'clock
Where did the night go? I can't stop
Heaven's a place where the lines get crossed
It's some kind of beautiful, some kind of beautiful

And I searched through the fire
'Cause I knew I was getting closer
In the flames I found love
And at last the journey's over

You set me free
You set me free

I feel like a star when we do it like this
A shot in the dark, but I know I can't miss
The heavens are far, but they've given me wings
It's some kind of beautiful, some kind of beautiful
I'm lost in your eyes and it's five o'clock
Where did the night go? I can't stop
Heaven's a place where the lines get crossed
It's some kind of beautiful, some kind of beautiful

Yeah, I feel like a star
(Said now I feel like a star)
Yeah, some kind of beautiful
(Like a star at night)

I feel like a star when we do it like this
A shot in the dark, but I know I can't miss
The heavens are far, but they've given me wings
It's some kind of beautiful, some kind of beautiful
I'm lost in your eyes and it's five o'clock
Where did the night go? I can't stop
Heaven's a place where the lines get crossed
It's some kind of beautiful, some kind of beautiful
