		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Damn, Mikey)

I heard he been dissin' on the squad, we left his man sleep
Duckin' silver bracelets, be precautious when the feds sweep
I want that brand new Bentley with the red seats
My pops was there for me, so I'll be damned I be a deadbeat, uh
When you said you loved me, girl, you scared me
I'm fakin' smiles, I'm hurt inside, can't let my fans see
They hear me talkin', but I don't think they understand me
Checks and deposits, young nigga swimmin' in them bands deep

Head on a swivel, opposition like a block away
Teeth grittin' off them X pills, so high that I couldn't concentrate
I'm TimTim Gang, don't add a K, 'cause I don't think that's smart to say
Rock out with that TEC, might make a nigga do the Harlem Shake
Make sure that grass low, keep your pole and always watch for snakes
Be careful who you trust, 'cause they'll cross you like Tim Hardaway
Impatient in the slums, I couldn't afford to let my mama wait
Long-distance relationship with God, so it get hard to pray
You can't really plan what's meant to be, I think they call it fate
Like girl, I love you, but it's only so much I can tolerate
Like girl, I love you, but it's only so much that my heart can take
Like let's give it a rest, girl, I just wanna give my heart a break

I heard he been dissin' on the squad, we left his man sleep
Duckin' silver bracelets, be precautious when the feds sweep
I want that brand new Bentley with the red seats
My pops was there for me, so I'll be damned I be a deadbeat, uh
When you said you loved me, girl, you scared me
I'm fakin' smiles, I'm hurt inside, can't let my fans see
They hear me talkin', but I don't think they understand me (uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
Checks and deposits, young nigga swimmin' in them bands deep

Fee say like two hundred racks, but the price keep goin' up
I'm the hottest out the 'Raq, they don't like me blowin' up
Back against the wall, no one to trust
Ain't no limit in these streets, can ride a bike you old enough
Gotta fight, no foldin' up, lack, pay the price, you know what's up
And when they say, "Who winnin'?" Bitch, act like you know it's us
From the soil, you gotta share the same scars to roll with us
Say it's smoke, then roll it up, off the Act', I'm pourin' up
It's crackin' where I'm from, watch what you throwin' up
Just reckless gangbangin', no big homies over us
'Fatuated by dollars, yeah, on that guap, I got a crush
Been racin' to millions, the money talks give me a rush

I heard he been dissin' on the squad, we left his man sleep
Duckin' silver bracelets, be precautious when the feds sweep
I want that brand new Bentley with the red seats
My pops was there for me, so I'll be damned I be a deadbeat, uh
When you said you loved me, girl, you scared me
I'm fakin' smiles, I'm hurt inside, can't let my fans see
They hear me talkin', but I don't think they understand me
Checks and deposits, young nigga swimmin' in them bands deep
