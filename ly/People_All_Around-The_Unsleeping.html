		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am the man who had friends, but they all gone on my hands
I had the love but it gone on my eyes but body on my hands
My family, my son ,my dreams they all died on my knees
Im still 18 and world still green, i live from 1016

I passing times, i passing friends, i passing love but i can`t die
Im full of pain and tragedy, above my head death very high
I think that i just stuck in life, that full of hurt and traitors
I look like young but thousand years,my back is full of scars

People all around people all around screaming you are a satan u r a satan 
But i can`t answer anything 
What the hell are u,go the hell from here, many times was burned many times was killed
But i can`t answer anything

Who am i should be, great philosophy, great historic,soldier, rogue or staying alchoholic
I can be anything, i can see everything, know much as can, try everything, stop cancer, all diesese
New time of technic, computer is my routin, play different games, eat cheeseburgers watch movies on big screen
I can have all i need, its 2016 but friends are dies, my lovers dies im fucking lose control

People all around people all around screaming you are a satan u r a satan 
But i can`t answer anything 
What the hell are u,go the hell from here, many times was burned many times was killed
But i can`t answer 
But i can`t answer
But i can`t answer
But i can`t answer 
But i can`t, i can`t
But i can`t answer anything

People all around people all around screaming you are a satan u r a satan 
But i can`t answer anything 
What the hell are u,go the hell from here, many times was burned many times was killed

But i can`t answer 
But i can`t answer
But i can`t answer
But i can`t answer 
But i can`t, i can`t
But i can`t answer anything
