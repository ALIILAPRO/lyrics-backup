		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a world you're living in
No one else has your part
All God's children in the wind
Take it in and blow real hard

Look around it
Have you found it?
Walking down the avenue
See what it brings
Could be good things
In the air for me and you

We are leaving (we are leaving), we are gone (we are gone)
Come with us to all alone
Never worry (never worry), never moan (never moan)
We will leave you all alone

In the mountains (in the mountains), in the cities (in the cities)
You can see the righteous dream
Look around you (look around you), has it found you? (Has it found you?)
Is it what it really seems?

There's a world you're (there's a world you're) living in (living in)
No one else has your part
All God's children (all God's children) in the wind (in the wind)
Take it in and blow real hard
