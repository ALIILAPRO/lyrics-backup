		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It all comes down to this
I miss your morning kiss
I won't lie, I'm feeling it
You don't know, and I'm missing it
I'm so dumb, I'm must admit
It's too much to hold it in
I can't say no more than this
I just hope your heart hear me now

Gotta let you know how I'm feeling
You own my heart, he just renting
Don't turn away, pay attention
I'm pouring out my heart, oh boy

I, I'm not living life
I'm not living right
I'm not living if you're not by my side
Oh

I, I'm not living life
I'm not living right
I'm not living if you're not by my side
Oh

Let's meet at our favorite spot
You know the one right around the block
From a nice place that you love to shop
Can you get away?
Care to sit down, let's talk it out
One on one, without a crowd
I wanna hold your hand
Make you laugh again, I need to be near you
Gotta let you know how I'm feeling
Own my heart, and she just renting
Don't turn away, pay attention
I'm pouring out my heart, girl

I, I'm not living life
I'm not living right
I'm not living if you're not by my side
Oh

I, I'm not living life
I'm not living right
I'm not living if you're not by my side
Oh

I can't eat, I-I-I-I
I can't sleep, I-I-I-I
What I need, I-I-I-I
Is you right by my side, I

I can't eat, I-I-I-I
I can't sleep, I-I-I-I
What I need, I-I-I-I
Is you right by my side, I (yeah)

It ain't your spit game, it's your dick game
That got me walking 'round ready to wear your big chain
I only argue wit' him when the Lakers on
Other than that I'm getting my Marc Jacobs on
When my pussy game so cold that he always seem to come back
'Cause he know that it be a wrap
When I'm riding it from the back
Wait, oh, let me see your phone
'Cause all them bitches is ratchet
And don't let me get in my truck
'Cause all them' bitches'll catch it
Wait-wait-wait, damn, there I go again
I be trippin', I be flippin', I be so belligerent
Man, this shit that we be fighting over so irrelevant
I don't even remember though, I was probably hella bent, let's go (yeah)

I, I'm not living life (yeah) (I'm not living life)
I'm not living right
I'm not living if you're not by my side (no, no, no)
Oh

I, I'm not living life (yeah)
I'm not living right (I am not living, I am not living)
I'm not living if you're not by my side (ooh, baby)
Oh

I, whoa-whoa-whoa
I, whoa-whoa-whoa
I, whoa-whoa-whoa
If you're not by my side, whoa

I can't eat, I-I-I-I
I can't sleep, I-I-I-I (I can't eat, I can't sleep)
What I need, I-I-I-I (I need to see you, baby)
Is you right by my side, I (ooh)
