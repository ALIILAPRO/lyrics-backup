		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love it when you just don't care
I love it when you dance like there's nobody there
So when it gets hard, don't be afraid
We don't care what them people say
I love it when you don't take no
I love it when you do what you want 'cause you just said so
Let them all go home, we out late
We don't care what them people say

We don't have to be ordinary
Make your best mistakes
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby, be the life of the party
I'm tellin' you to take your shot, it might be scary
Hearts are gonna break
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby, be the life of the party

Together we can just let go
Pretend like there's no one else here that we know
Slow dance, fall in love as the club track plays
We don't care what them people say

We don't have to be ordinary
Make your best mistakes
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby, be the life of the party
I'm tellin' you, take your shot, it might be scary
Hearts are gonna break
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby, be the life of the party

Come out tonight, come out tonight
There's no one standin' in your way
Come out tonight, come out tonight
We don't care what them people say
We don't care what them people say

We don't have to be ordinary
Make your best mistakes
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby, be the life of the party
I'm tellin' you, take your shot, it might be scary
Hearts are gonna break
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby, be the life of the party

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Life of the party
So don't let 'em keep you down
Oh, you know you can't give up
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby, be the life of the party
