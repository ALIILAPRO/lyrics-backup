		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look alive, Sunshine
One oh nine in the sky but the pigs won't quit
You're here with me, Dr. Death Defying
I'll be your surgeon, your proctor, your helicopter
Pumpin' out the slaughtermatic sounds to keep you alive
A system failure for the masses, empty matter for the master plan
Louder than God's revolver and twice as shiny

This one's for all of you rock'n'rollers
All you crash queens and motor babies

Listen up
