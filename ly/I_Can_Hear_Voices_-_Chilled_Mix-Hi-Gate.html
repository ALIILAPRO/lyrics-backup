		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just can't understand it
Won't you tell me why
I'm trying hard to resent
Won't you help me try?

These voices that I'm hearing
Running through my head
My sense is disappearing
Won't you show me how to check?

Voices
Running around my head
I can hear voices
Ooh, voices
Voices
Running around my head
I can hear voices
Ooh, voices

A sense of distortion
A feeling of confusion
Won't you give me the solution
I need it, I need it
These voices that I'm hearing
They occupy my mind
It's bleeding me for the feeding
I'm hoping the two are one

Voices
Running around my head
I can hear voices
Ooh, voices
Voices
Running around my head
I can hear voices
Ooh, voices

I can hear voices
Ooh, voices

I can hear voices
Ooh, voices
