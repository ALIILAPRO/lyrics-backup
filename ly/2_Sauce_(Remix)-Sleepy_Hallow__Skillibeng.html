		  Yo eastside, yo eastside, yo eastside
ayy
She said she don't love me, why she still get naked?
I'm a badmon 
Look, hol' on
(Great John on the beat by the way)
Look

I'm feeling way, way too saucy (too sauce)
Too sauce
Hop out the Wraith, hopped in the Porsche (hopped in the Porsche)
New Porsche, and it's racin' (and it's racin'), huh
She said she don't love me, why she still get naked? (She still get naked)
I'm a badmon, baby, I'm Jamaican (I'm Jamaican)
Yeah (hol' on)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tonight, we don't give a fuck
Tonight, we don't really care, hol' on
Yeah (aight bet), huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tonight, we don't give a fuck
Tonight, we don't really care, hol' on, huh

Wait

I know you heard the shots
I be buggin', tryna murder opps, ayy
I got 'em itchin' to flock
When you see me you better move hot
You know who call the shots
From the bottom, but now we on top, huh
How is you still sleep? Now they lovin', used to hate me, huh
And my kicks clean, ain't nobody ever had these, uh
Crackin', huh
No lackin', know I pack it

You know we super savage
(Wait, wait, hol' on, hol' on)

I'm feeling way, way too saucy (too sauce)
Too sauce
Hop out the Wraith, hopped in the Porsche (hopped in the Porsche)
New Porsche, and it's racin' (and it's racin'), huh
She said she don't love me, why she still get naked? (She still get naked)
I'm a badmon, baby, I'm Jamaican (I'm Jamaican)
Yeah

Tonight, we don't really care, hol' on
