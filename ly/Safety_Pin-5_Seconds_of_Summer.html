		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Runaways, we're the long lost children
Running to the edge of the world
Everybody wants to throw us away
Broken boy meets broken girl

You said you tried it all before
And it only makes it worse
Oh, but this time, maybe this time
Two wrongs make it right

We'll safety-pin the pieces of our broken hearts back together
Patching up all the holes until we both feel much better
Deleted things, I really meant 
So now I'll say the things I never sent
We'll safety-pin the pieces of our broken hearts back together

Throwing rocks at your broken window
Only you can cure my sickness
Raise ourselves and a middle finger
'Cause they all think we're twisted

Once I had a little taste
Now I'm addicted to your fix
Oh, yeah, this time, maybe this time
Two wrongs make it right

We'll safety-pin the pieces of our broken hearts back together
Patching up all the holes until we both feel much better
Deleted things, I really meant 
So now I'll say the things I never sent
We'll safety-pin the pieces of our broken hearts back together

No more waiting, we can save us from falling 
No more waiting, we can save us from falling
No more waiting, we can save us from falling
No more waiting, we can save us from falling
No more waiting, we can save us from falling
This time, maybe this time

We'll safety-pin the pieces of our broken hearts back together
Patching up all the holes until we both feel much better
Deleted things, I really meant 
So now I'll say the things I never sent
We'll safety-pin the pieces of our broken hearts back together

No more waiting, we can save us from falling
No more waiting, we can save us from falling
No more waiting, we can save us from falling
No more waiting, we can save us from falling
