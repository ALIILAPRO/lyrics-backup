		  Whoa

Scotty doesn't know that Fiona and me 
Do it in my van every Sunday
She tells him she's in church but
She doesn't go
Still she's on her knees and
Scotty doesn't know

Oh, Scotty doesn't know 
So don't tell Scotty
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
(So don't tell Scotty!)

Fiona says she's out shoppin'
But she's under me
And I'm not stoppin' 'cause

Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
So don't tell Scotty
Scotty doesn't know 
(Don't tell Scotty!)

I can't believe he's so trustin'
While I'm right behind you thrustin' (ooh)
Fiona's got him on the phone
And she's tryin' not to moan
It's a three way call
And he knows nothin', nothin'

Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Don't tell Scotty 'cause
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know

So don't tell Scotty
We'll put on a show
Everyone'll go
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know 

The parking lot, why not
It's so cool when you're on top
His front lawn, in the snow
Laughin' so hard 'cause
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know

I did her on his birthday
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Don't tell scotty
Scotty doesn't know 

Scotty will know
Scotty has to know
Scotty's gotta know
I'm gonna tell Scotty
Gonna tell him myself
Scotty has to know
Scotty has to know
Scotty has to
Scotty has to
Scotty has to go
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know (don't Tell Scotty!)
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know (don't Tell Scotty, Scotty doesn't know)
Scotty doesn't
Scotty doesn't
Scotty doesn't know

Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty's gotta go

(That is so bad, so bad)
