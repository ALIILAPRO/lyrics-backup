		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Seasons change, the time goes by
Sometimes I feel like I can't keep up
I wonder why?
I've been living in the same old moments
I think that I was hypnotized by the pretty days
I know that it's silly and I have to try to live
I think I'll forget about you
I think I should be cleaning up my apartment
The faint smell of your jacket is killing me
You look so pretty in our homemade films
I'll try not to think about you
I get high when you call me by name
Now I can't stay awake at night
Because of withdrawal
No wonder why
I've been living in the same old moments
I think that I was hypnotized by the pretty days
I know that it's silly and I have to try to live
I think I'll forget about you
I think I should be cleaning up my apartment
The faint smell of your jacket is killing me
You look so pretty in our homemade films
I'll try not to think about you
If the sun is shining down and it looks at me
Telling me the answers to the questions I seek
When I'm looking for the one all I see is you
Well the universe decided that we cannot be
Taking the most important person from me
When I'm looking at the stars
I'll try not to think about you
