		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, turn your lights down low
And pull your window curtain (yeah)
Oh, let Jah moon come shining in
Into our life again
Sayin', "Ooh, it's been a long, long time"
(Long, long time)
I got this message for you, girl
But it seems I was never on time
Still I wanna get through to you, girly
On time, on time (word)
I want to give you some love
I want to give you some good, good lovin'
(Uh, uh, uh)
Oh I, oh I, oh I
Yeah, I want to give you some good, good lovin' (uh)

Turn your lights down low
(Word, w-word, uh)
Never ever try to resist, oh no
(Na, na, na)
Oh, let your love come shinin' in
(Na, na, na)
Into our lives again
(Na, na, na)
Saying ooh, I love you
(I love you, I love you)
And I want you to know right now
(Know right now)
Ooh, I love you
(Uh-uh, yeah, uh)
And I want you to know right now (uh)
That I, that I (na, na, na)
I wanna give you some love (uh, yeah, I)
I wanna give you some good, good lovin' (good, good)
Oh I, oh I, oh I
I wanna give you some good, good lovin' (yeah uh-uh)

Loving you is a like a song I replay (loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful)
Every three minutes and thirty seconds of every day (uh, uh)
And every chorus was written for us to recite (right)
Every beautiful melody of devotion every night
This potion might, this ocean might, carry me
In a wave of emotion to ask you to marry me
And every word, every second, and every third
Expresses the happiness more clearly than ever heard (uh)
And when I play 'em, every chord is a poem
Tellin' the Lord how grateful I am because I know him (what? word)
The harmonies possess a sensation similar to your caress (uh)
If you askin' then I'm tellin' you it's yes (yes, yes)
Stand in love, take my hand in love, Jah bless (right)

I want to give you some good, good lovin' (yeah)

Turn your lights down low (right, right now)
And pull your window curtain (I said, right, right now)
And let Jah love come tumbling in (right, right now)
Into our lives again (uh, uh, said, right, right now)
Sayin' (sayin' ooh)
Ooh, it's been a long, long time (yeah)
I got this message for you, boy
But it seems I was never on time
Still I wanna get through to you, boy
On time (right, right now), on time (said right, right now, uh)
I want to give you some love (wha-what, yeah, wha-what?)
Oh, how I
I want to give you some good, good lovin' (can you hear me?)
Oh I, oh I, oh I (uh, uh, yeah, it's like)
I want to give you some good, good lovin' (uh)

Yeah, it's like
You, you, you, you, you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I want to give you some good, good lovin' (good, good)
Oh I, oh I (uh, yeah-yeah, right, right now)
I wanna give you some good, good lovin' (yo, yo, uh, right right now)

(I wanna, I wanna)
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh yeah
What, what, what (feels so good)

Please, don't forget passionate
Babies in the bassinet
You call, we be ready
Ha ha, Ma steady (feels so good)
Yes, yes
Baby love (it feels so)
