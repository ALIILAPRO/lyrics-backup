		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a crusader
I'm the darkest lady
I'm the taste on your tongue

I'm Darth Vader
I know what I'm made of
?Cause I was warmed by the sun
The sun

You're looking for me
But it's not what you seek
I've got a twisted personality

You're a crusader
You're the darkest lady
I like the taste of your tongue

You are Darth Vader
I know what you're made of
And you were warmed by the sun
By the sun, by the sun, the sun

And I'm looking for you
And I'm glad I found me
A special kind of personality

When the spark goes out of you
And [unverified] fear me
I am your lung

I'm Darth Vader
I know what I'm made of
?Cause I was warmed by the sun
By the sun, the sun, the sun

I was looking for you
I'm not glad I found me
A special kind of personality

Yes, you are the crusader
You are the lady
I want to chase your tongue

You are Darth Vader
I know what you're made of
You are like a lung
A lung, a lung, a lung

(And you were warmed by the sun)
You're looking for me
(By the sun)
But it's not what you seek
(By the sun)
I've got a twisted personality
By the sun

You're looking for me
But it's not what you seek
I've got a twisted personality
(A special kind of personality)
