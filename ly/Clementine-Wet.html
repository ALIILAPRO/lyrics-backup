		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Takes time to put it to the test
Sometimes I only make a mess
Sunshine, forget about the rest
After a while, I still think you're the best

So fun, we said so many times
(Do you love me) like you love Clementine?
Sometimes you make me sad
Some things, they never end

Some things, some things, some things never end
They're always

So, I decide I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
In my life
There's nothing more that's on my mind
I decide I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
In my life
There's nothing more that's on my mind

My body's grieving what's dead and gone
I'm holding on to what's over and done
It's never enough, I see you giving up
You changed my heart, a love that carried me up

Some things, some things, some things never end
They're always

So, I decide I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
In my life
There's nothing more that's on my mind
I decide I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
In my life
There's nothing more that's on my mind
I decide I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
In my life
There's nothing more that's on my mind
