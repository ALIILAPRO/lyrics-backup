		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got to be there, got to be there (got to be there)
In the morning
When she says hello to the world
Got to be there, got to be there (got to be there)
Bring her good times
And show her that she's my girl
Oh, what a feeling there'll be
The moment I know she loves me
'Cause when I look in her eyes I realize
I need her sharing the world beside me

So I got to be there, got to be there (got to be there) 
In the morning
And welcome her into my world
And show her that she's my girl
When she says, "hello world!" (got to be there)
I need her sharing the world beside me

That's why I've got to be there, got to be there (got to be there)
Where love begins
And that's everywhere she goes
I've got to be there so she knows
That when she's with me
She's home (home, she's home)
(Home, she's home) yeah 

(Got to be there) got to be there, got to be there
(Got to be there) got to be there, got to be there
(Got to be there) oh, baby, baby got to be there, got to be there
(Got to be there) got to be there, to be there
(Got to be there) oh, got to be there, got to be there
(Got to be there) got to be there, got to be there
(Got to be there) got to be there
