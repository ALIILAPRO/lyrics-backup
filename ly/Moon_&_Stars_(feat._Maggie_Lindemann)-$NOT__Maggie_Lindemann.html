		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Yung Castor
Ayy, bitch, I'll take you to the fuckin' (ayy, uh)
I'll take you to the fuckin' moon and stars
You feel me? Yuh
Hahaha, ayy, ayy

Okay, I hop up in my coupe, yeah (what's up?)
What's up? Do you wanna go far with me? (With me)
Hold my hand, I ain't really goin' far (uh-uh)
Bitch, I'll take you to the moon and the stars (and the stars)
'Kay, I hop up in my coupe, yeah (what's up?)
What's up? Do you wanna go far with me? (With me)
Hold my hand, I ain't really goin' far (uh-uh)
Bitch, I'll take you to the moon and the stars (and the stars)

Ayy, I ain't really wanna do it now, ayy
I see my name in the back, uh, ayy
I see my name in the back, yuh, ayy
I see my name in the back, now I'm in the fuckin' front
Two-door coupe foreign, no roof for the blunt
Just me and my bitch and we 'bout to make a wish
On a star, no ring, bitch, we go for the swish
I can take you to the moon, you can see the fuckin' stars
You're the fix to my drugs, I ain't talkin' 'bout no love (nah)
What the fuck, nigga? What's wrong with me?
End my life, I just don't wanna bleed

Okay, I hop up in my coupe, yeah (what's up?)
What's up? Do you wanna go far with me? (With me)
Hold my hand, I ain't really goin' far (uh-uh)
Bitch, I'll take you to the moon and the stars (and the stars)
'Kay, I hop up in my coupe, yeah (what's up?)
What's up? Do you wanna go far with me? (With me)
Hold my hand, I ain't really goin' far (uh-uh)
Bitch, I'll take you to the moon and the stars (and the stars)

Ain't no place in this world that I won't go with ya
Turn that suitcase into a home
And I like when we take it too far
But I'd, would rather be closer
Play with me like a video game
Sayin', "You like when I'm taking control"
If my love can't be your face
Then what are we up all night for?

Okay, I hop up in my coupe, yeah (what's up?)
What's up? Do you wanna go far with me? (With me)
Hold my hand, I ain't really goin' far (uh-uh)
Bitch, I'll take you to the moon and the stars (and the stars)
'Kay, I hop up in my coupe, yeah (what's up?)
What's up? Do you wanna go far with me? (With me)
Hold my hand, I ain't really goin' far (uh-uh)
Bitch, I'll take you to the moon and the stars (and the stars)
