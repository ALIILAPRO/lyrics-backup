		<p>
		  (Wheezy outta here)

What if I tell you I don't wanna be a playa
I could be your Clyde if you be my Bonnie, bae
Give you my time only if you show me patience
Teach me how to love you, I ain't used to be being famous
I could let you drive the Bentley, just don't drive me crazy
I can buy you Birkins, let you pick out any flavor 
Yeah, I don't wanna be a playa no more
I don't wanna be a playa, yeah

I don't wanna be a playa, I just wanna buy you flavors
Put Chanely on your waist, I'm already on my way
Bring a friend if you feel anxious
You ain't ready yet, it's okay
If you ain't ready yet, it's okay, girl, yeah
It never used to be this way, just appreciate me, baby
My watch is over two hunnid, I ain't mean to make you feel basic
Gettin' fly everyday like it's a special occasion, look
But, baby, just love me for free, don't try to change me
'Cause you're the only one that could say things to persuade me (that easy)
And you will never get the same me

What if I tell you I don't wanna be a playa (be a playa)
I could be your Clyde if you be my Bonnie, bae
Give you my time only if you show me patience
Teach me how to love you, I ain't used to be being famous
I could let you drive the Bentley, just don't drive me crazy
I can buy you Birkins, let you pick out any flavor 
Yeah, I don't wanna be a playa no more
I don't wanna be a playa

I need a nigga who ain't afraid to make it known (make it known)
Need a nigga who ain't afraid to unlock his phone
For you, it ain't for you if you gon' be on that bullshit and unloyal
Talkin' 'bout some I don't wanna make you crazy, I just wanna give you love
Yeah, you know that you my baby, ain't 'bout no one else but us
You don't wanna be a playa no more
And I ain't tryna be played with no more

What if I tell you I don't wanna be a playa
I could be your Clyde if you be my Bonnie, bae
Give you my time only if you show me patience
Teach me how to love you, I ain't used to be being famous
I could let you drive the Bentley, just don't drive me crazy
I can buy you Birkins, let you pick out any flavor 
Yeah, I don't wanna be a playa no more
I don't wanna be a playa
