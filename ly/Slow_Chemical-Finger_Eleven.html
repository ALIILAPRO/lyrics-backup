		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The wonder of the world is gone I know for sure
All the wonder that I want I found in her

As the whole becomes a part I strike to burn
And no flame returns

Every intuition fails to find it's way
One more table turned around I'm back again

Finding I'm more lost and found when she's not around
When she's not around I feel it coming down

Give me what I could never ask for
Connect me and you could be my chemical now

Give me the drug you know I'm after
Connect me and you could be my chemical

When everybody wants you (The chemical goes slow)

When everybody wants you (The chemical gets)

Slow and
Everybody wants you
So
Slow and
Everybody wants your soul

Give me what I could never ask for
connect me and you could be my chemical NOW

Give me the drug you know I'm after
Connect me and you could be the chemical

You could be the chemical
You could be the chemical
You could be the chemical
You could be the chemicals
