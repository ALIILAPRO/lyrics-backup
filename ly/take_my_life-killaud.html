		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see the way you bleed
I see the way you need
I see the way you feed on outside
Things to fill the deep
The deep within, you must give in
Your heart sinks in it
You sink in it
You try to swim you fail to win
To the poison
I see the way you think
I see the way you breath
I see the pain you see inside
Of me you don't believe, you won't believe
I want to go home the night it getting cold
You tell me what I already know
Let me lock your lips to mine
Twist it turn it take my life
I already feel dead inside
What's more than a blade or knife
Push it pull it take my life
I already feel dead inside
Twist it turn it take my life
Let me lock your lips to mine
I want to go home the night it getting cold
You tell me what I already know
