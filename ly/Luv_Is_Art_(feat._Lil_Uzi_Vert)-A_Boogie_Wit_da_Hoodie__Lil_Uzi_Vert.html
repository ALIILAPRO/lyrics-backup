		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, if you hold me down, then I'm gon' hold you down
But if the money is gone, would you still be around?
(Yeah, I was one side over, I had to hold you down)
Whoa, whoa, yeah
Okay, let's get it now

And I was just up in Starlet's, feel like a privilege now
Me and my boys so deep, no, we not sittin' down
Yeah, I was one side over, I had to hold you down
And me and Bubba the only niggas goin' round for round

But if you hold me down, then I'm gon' hold you down
But if my money is gone, would you still be around?
I don't know what you doin' when I'm not around
You don't know what I'm doin', when I'm out of town
The last time I fucked you, you was mad
I was rubbin' lotion on your body and your ass
Bought you a whole bunch of fly shit so you can brag
And when your friends talk about me, you be so mad
But, you know my body, girl, you know me
You know my body, girl, you know me
Yeah, yeah, you already felt it
And I already seen you naked
But girl don't make me re-up

And I was just up in Starlet's, feel like a privilege now
Me and my boys so deep, no, we not sittin' down
Yeah, I was one side over, I had to hold you down
And me and Bubba the only niggas goin' round for round

And this VV gang pull up in a lemon coupe
He got SI's in this chain, he mixin' up his jewels
And you done fucked on my gang, so I'm not lovin' you
You cannot fuck up my name, so I'm not cuffin' you

And I was just up in Starlet's, feel like a privilege now
Me and my boys so deep, no, we not sittin' down
Yeah, I was one side over, I had to hold you down
I used to hold you down

Yeah, uh, niggas go out sad, that is pitiful (whoa)
Yeah, got some shooters, I swear they'll get rid of you (bow, bow)
Yeah, grown men always tryna pick at you
I got a Glock, if you get shot, I'll show you what this stick'll do
If you was the one that was in my shoes, you prolly would risk it too (whoa)
I must got God on my side, 'cause these niggas be missin' you
You isn't me, poppin' somethin', two up in me
Got my boys in the stu' up with me and we still poppin' shit like an inner tube

You told me you froze up
All I did was kiss you on your shoulder
I do it every time I bone her
And she get upset when I don't post her
But you the one that make me fold up
Under pressure like I stole some'
And I can't lie, I want you closer, yeah
And I would never go expose her

But if you hold me down, then I'm gon' hold you down
But if my money is gone, would you still be around?
I don't know what you doin' when I'm not around?
And you don't know what I'm doin', when I'm out of town
