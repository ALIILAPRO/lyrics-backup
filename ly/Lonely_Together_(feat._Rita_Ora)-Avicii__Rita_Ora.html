		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's you and your world, and I'm caught in the middle
I caught the edge of the knife and it hurts just a little
Yeah, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know that I can't be your friend
It's my head or my heart and I'm caught in the middle

My hands are tied, but not tight enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh Lord, here we go

I might hate myself tomorrow, but I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of the bottle, you're the poison in the wine
And I know I can't change you and I, I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow, but I'm on my way tonight
Let's be lonely together (yeah)
A little less lonely together (yeah)

Eyes wide shut and it feels like the first time (oh)
Before the rush to my blood hurts too much and we flatline (oh)
Yeah and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know just how this ends
Now I'm all messed up and it feels like the first time (oh)

I might hate myself tomorrow, but I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of the bottle, you're the poison in the wine
And I know I can't change you and I, I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow, but I'm on my way tonight
Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together
Let's be lonely together (yeah)
A little less lonely together (yeah)

My hands are tied, but not tight enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh Lord, here we go

I might hate myself tomorrow, but I'm on my way tonight (on my way)
At the bottom of the bottle, you're the poison in the wine
And I know I can't change you and I, I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow, but I'm on my way tonight
Let's be lonely together (yeah)
A little less lonely together (yeah)

Let's be lonely together 
Let's be lonely, lonely love
Let's be lonely, lonely love (a little less lonely together)
A little less lonely love (I can't change you and I, I won't change)
A little less lonely love (I can't change you and I, I won't change)
A little less lonely love
