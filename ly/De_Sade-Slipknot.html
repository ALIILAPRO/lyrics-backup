		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel it now, a new restraint
A fool is only he who fools again, again, again, again
I needed all the pain you saved
To wash across my face like time began, began, began, began
Everybody lies when they say forever
No one else will understand
Pull the stitches tight until we sever
Break me in your open hands

Please forget me not
I need your simple pleasures to be God
And please, my sweet De Sade
Just eat my heart and twist me into knots

I know I never had a chance, a chance
Oh, I know I'm wretched and I stand, stand
Seeking all the things you have
If I die with you it's worth the life, life, life, life
I was just a nothing wanting something
Only you will only do
Everything and more, it comes to nothing
If it doesn't come with you

Please forget me not
I need your simple pleasures to be God
And please, my sweet De Sade
Just eat my heart and twist me into knots

Something dominating nothing
Nothing animated, something used
Fill me, wait a minute, kill me
Feel me, I am in a mood abuse
Carve, carve, carve, I am starve, starve, starved
For the warmth of your will
And the edge of your purest thrill

De Sade, De Sade, De Sade, De Sade
De Sade, De Sade, De Sade, De Sade
