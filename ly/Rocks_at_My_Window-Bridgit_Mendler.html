		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sitting at home
I turn on the TV
It's all reality
And I don't wanna watch stupid people
Got my phone
I check the text between
Between you and me
'Cause I guess you popped into my head
And it shouldn't be Friday night
Why am I here home alone when

We can run away for the weekend
But I'm here alone
Wish you'd go throwing rocks at my window
We could count the stars from your car hood
But I'm here alone
Wish you'd go throwing rocks at my window
Ba ba ba da ba ba
Ba ba ba da ba ba
Ba ba ba da ba ba
Throwing rocks at my window

See it's been
Far too many movies
Sinking into me
So now I wait for my Prince Charming
But I've got this picture in my head
Of the chapel for our wedding
So I guess that I've got it bad
Just one step at a time
Why am I here home alone when

We can run away for the weekend
But I'm here alone
Wish you'd go throwing rocks at my window
We could count the stars from your car hood
But I'm here alone
Wish you'd go throwing rocks at my window

T-H-R-O-W-I-N-G
You're throwing rocks
I wish you were throwing rocks, rocks
T-H-R-O-W-I-N-G
You're throwing rocks
I wish you were throwing rocks, rocks
T-H-R-O-W-I-N-G
You're throwing rocks
I wish you were throwing rocks, rocks
T-H-R-O-W-I-N-G
You're throwing rocks at my window

We can run away for the weekend
But I'm here alone
Wish you'd go throwing rocks at my window
We could count the stars from your car hood
But I'm here alone
Wish you'd go throwing rocks at my window
Ba ba ba da ba ba
Ba ba ba da ba ba
Ba ba ba da ba ba
Throwing rocks at my window

Ba ba ba da ba ba
Ba ba ba da ba ba
Ba ba ba da ba ba
Throwing rocks at my window
