		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna look at the damage left along my face and skin
ヒビが見えた時は叫びたい
Every day they serve as reminders of my past mistakes
このままイタイんだ
ほら、こら、イヤ、したくないよ

こんな障害は初めてじゃないんです
本当に、楽しい暮らししてみたい
All of the king's horses and all of the king's men
They all wanna put me back together again!

弁柄で
(パプラプラパパ)
そんなヒビ綺麗にして

What am I to do?
(ラチュラチュラタタ)
It's all coming back to me, the memory of you...

Don't you try me!
Don't take it lightly!
I'm nothing but a ghost
At the most
You shattered my mind
One thousand times
I'm broken, yet somehow, I'm still alive
You left me covered in gold

I've been pulverized for the past five thousand five hundred days
しかし、苦しい暮らししてみたい
Promise me you'll stay when I eventually forget my name
ほら見て
Look at the marks!
Look at the fracture left on my heart!

Can you feel my pain? 
(ラチュラチュラタタ)
Crazened crazing cracks all over my brain

I don't wanna stop!
(パプラプラパパ)
Look at what I've done with it, I made it into art!

Shining brightly!
There's no one like me!
I'm better than before
Gimme more!
It is my lifeline
Quit asking me why!
'Cause now I know I can be redefined
If I get covered in gold

How unsightly
Why don't you like me?
You know I shine the most
Not to boast!
I've broken my mind
One million times
Now not one mark on me is out of line
And I am made of gold

I've ascended
Just as intended
It doesn't quench my thirst
I'm the worst!
I'm out of my mind
The perfect design
Nobody can defeat me now that I'm
Completely covered in gold

GOLD
