		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I haven't been myself of late
I haven't slept for several days but
Coming home I feel like I
Designed these buildings I walk by
You know you drive me up the wall
I need to see your face that's all
You little sod I love your eyes
Be everything to me tonight

The streets are full of Goths and Greeks
I haven't seen my mum for weeks but
Coming home I feel like I
Designed these buildings I walk by
You know you drive me up the wall
I need to see your face that's all
You little sod I love your eyes
Be everything to me tonight

I never know what I want but I know when
I'm low that I need to be in the town
Where they know what I'm like and don't mind
