		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel like I want to go home,
But I am home,
cnd the cardinal calls out,
Lonesome and mad,
From the walnut tree.

The flowers you planted have died,
cnd now, here, they shiver, 
Swaying and pedal-bare
cs the wind comes through whistling.

Cactus flower blooms in the desert
Under the stars,
Sprouts from the asphalt 
Under the cars,
Spitting and sputtering.

You know well that I was never
cte by a whale;
My lies are the dead bird
That gives this sad, grim parking lot meaning.

I feel like I want to go home,
But I am home,
cnd I dream of a kettle drum, booming and wailing
From somewhere far away

cnd here I will wait by the door
Like an old dog
Hearing the footsteps of all the strangers
Who are just passing by.
