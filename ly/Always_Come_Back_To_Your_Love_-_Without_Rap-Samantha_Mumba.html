		<p>
		  Yeah Check It
What What What
Uh - y'all Like a Hey
Yeah Uh
Come On - Uh
No doubt - Break It

I've been up and down (Uh)
Been going round and round (Uh)
I've been all over town (What What)
But I'll never ever find somebody new for sure

(Yes Yes y'all Left to Right - 
Yes Yes y'all We can rock it all night)

Show Me Where I Belong Tonight (All night)
Give me a reason to stay
No matter if I go left or right (Left to right)
I always come back to your love
(Back to your love)

I've been high and low (Uh)
I don't know where to go (Go baby)
Because I love you so (You're Like A Hey)
And I'll never ever find 
Someone like you for sure

(Yes Yes y'all Left to Right - 
Yes Yes y'all We can rock it all night)

Show Me Where I Belong Tonight (All night)
Give me a reason to stay (Like a Hey)
No matter if I go left or right (Left to right)
I always come back to your love
(Back to your love)

Love

No matter if I go left or right (Left to right)
I always come back to your love
(Yeah)

Love

(Back to your Love)

(Break It)

(Go Way - Left To Right)
(Go Way - Left To Right)
(Go way - I always find your Love)

Show Me Where I Belong Tonight 
Give me a reason to stay
No matter if I go left or right
I always come back to your love
Show Me Where I Belong Tonight (Tonight)
Give me a reason to stay
No matter if I go left or right (Left to Right)
I always come back to your love (Uh)
(Back To Your Love)

Love (Stargate)
Love (2G)

I always come back to your love
