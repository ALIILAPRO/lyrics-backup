		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We won't stop
We don't even know how to stop

Ya see, with positive minds
We create positive vibes
And with those positive vibes
We create positive lives
So if there's somethin' that ya want
Ya know ya gotta get it
Don't ever forget it 
'Cause someday ya will regret it
So keep on pushin' for 'em 
'cause your dreams are ya dreams
And no matter how it seems
There will always be the means
To get what ya want
Yo, and where ya going to
Now. What ya gonna do
I'm a leave that up to you

We gotta keep it goin' on now
Take it to the top now
Never gonna stop
Even if we start to drop now
Here we go again y'all
Can you get this flow 
Never want to go slow so...

How d' ya feel, do ya want to feel alright
Here's the deal, we've got pure delight
Alright, it's alright
Wake you up in to the morning light
Shake you up before you sleep at night
Alright
(You want to feel alright)
It's alright
(We got pure delight)

They say I'm greedy, but I still want more
What you don't need to know
I keep behind closed doors
'Cause, everything I buy can't be sold
And everything I touch turns to gold
You see, because I'm better than the next man
I shine above all those who try to put me down
And pass it to the next man
Who's the best man for keeping it tight
Next time it comes around make sure you do it right

We gotta keep it goin' on now
Take it to the top now
Never gonna stop
Even if we start to drop now
Here we go again y'all
Can you get this flow 
Never want to go slow so...

How d' ya feel, do ya want to feel alright
Here's the deal, we've got pure delight
Alright, it's alright
Wake you up in to the morning light
Shake you up before you sleep at night
Alright
(You want to feel alright)
It's alright
(We got pure delight)
