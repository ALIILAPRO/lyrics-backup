		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm in love with the thought of you when you were twenty-two
My pair of boots and your Converse shoes
Kicked off by the front door
Sipping cheap tequila on the front porch
I'm in love with the history of you and me
How we used to be, the king and queen
Of this small town, young and wild
Something from the nineties on the dashboard dial

But oh, the memory ain't enough
'Cause I can look but I can't touch

A memory can't kiss you outside of your mama's house
Midnight rain on a Chevy hood
A memory can't hold you in a Sarasota sunrise
Even though you wish it would
All it's gonna do is make you lose sleep at night
Wake up and leave you in the past
You can love a memory
But a memory can't love you back

Just when I think I found someone new, it comes out the blue
It kills my buzz and it kills the mood
Those two years, they're long gone
And I should be moving on

But oh, a memory'll make it hard
It's time I realize it don't deserve my heart (heart), oh

A memory can't kiss you outside of your mama's house
Midnight rain on a Chevy hood
A memory can't hold you in a Sarasota sunrise
Even though you wish it would
All it's gonna do is make you lose sleep at night
Wake up and leave you in the past
You can love a memory
But a memory can't love you back

A memory can't tell you how you make it feel
In the moonlight glow of a shotgun seat
A memory can't pick out a diamond ring
And say I do under an old oak tree
All it's gonna do is make you lose sleep at night
Wake up and leave you in the past
You can love a memory
But a memory can't love you back
Can't love you back

You can love a memory
But a memory can't love you back
