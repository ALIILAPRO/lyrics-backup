		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Summer ends, but you're not here
I fake a smile just to hide the tears
And all my friends say I should let go
So how could you love me and leave in the morning?

I wake up with your voice in my head
You're a boy's what they said, "Don't cry"
You take off your clothes in my bed and ghost me like that
Oh why?

When I'm getting fucked up, when I'm alone and I'm drunk
You'll always be the reason
Wish I could tell you, "Good luck"
Go break another man's heart
Goddamn, I hate this season

Summer ends, but you're not here
I fake a smile just to hide the tears
And all my friends say I should let go
So how could you love me and leave in the morning?

Can't you see I'm falling? Whoa
So how could you love me and leave in the morning?

I hold on but you're pushing me out
Say we're good, but I'm not okay
I know you only stay to get high
Still wasting my life away

When I'm getting fucked up, when I'm alone and I'm drunk
You'll always be the reason
Wish I could tell you, "Good luck"
Go break another man's heart
Goddamn, I hate this season

Summer ends, but you're not here
I fake a smile just to hide the tears
And all my friends say I should let go
So how could you love me and leave in the morning?

Can't you see I'm falling? Whoa
So how could you love me and leave in the morning?

So how could you love me and leave in the morning?
