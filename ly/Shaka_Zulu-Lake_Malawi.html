		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When did you last
When did you last feel like this?
When did you last hitchhike through America?
When did you last
When did you last see Alice?
Back in the past down in South Africa

In the eyes of Shaka Zulu
I knew what I would find

No, I'm not going no, I'm not going
If there's a storm coming
There's a storm coming no, I'm not going
Strange winds blowing i will wait for it
I will wait for it
If there's a storm for me
There's a storm for me i will wait for it
Can you wait for me

When you get lost
When you get lost in heaven
When you get lost (heaven)
Trying to see the lights, mmh

In the eyes of Shaka Zulu
I know that you'll be fine

No, I'm not going no, I'm not going
If there's a storm coming
There's a storm coming no, I'm not going
Strange winds blowing i will wait for it
I will wait for it
If there's a storm for me
There's a storm for me i will wait for it
Can you wait for me

Keep these boundaries with you
Where I'm gone if you can pass it
There's a slogan with me there's a slow
