		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shades of all the rage
Grabbing at my body
Death wants me to lay
And it makes no sense at all 
How my fear can paint the walls 

Baby wants to play 
I got nothing for him
Streets will make you pay 
'Til you shoot up from the ground 
Now he never makes a sound

And, oh
I did all I had to do 

And I've got scars 
And I'm burning and exploding
I've got scars 
But I promise you, I'm growing 

Paint the bars of the cage
But I won't stay forever
Calloused remain
From tearing up all these rules
Now I will not suffer fools

And, oh
I did all I had to do 

And I've got scars 
And I'm burning and exploding
I've got scars 
But I promise you, I'm growing 

I've got scars 
I've got scars 

I've got scars 
I've got scars 

And I've got scars 
And I'm burning and exploding
I've got scars 
But I promise you, I'm growing
I've got scars 
And I'm burning and exploding
I've got scars 
But I promise you, I'm growing
I've got scars
And I'm burning and exploding
I've got scars
But I promise you, I'm growing
And I promise you, I'm growing
And I promise you, I'm growing
