		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Enlight your sense of thought, of touch, of real, a shield
An underground for this coward
Building a blood in water scent
It's like some raping, without judgement
Boy in a pocket, balls in a bag
Serve and protect you
His dick his gun, his brain his badge

A faster way to kill them all would take too goddamn long
Absorb through pores the great escape
Aah

Kill that fuck to show him up 
Equal his displeasure now
Stab his ass, a reminded past of what the fuck we live for
Ourselves (ourselves, ourselves, ourselves)

Arm yourself, a branch, a third arm
Expand your health, crawl inside euphoria
Building a blood in water scent
It's like a raping, it's entrapment
Boy in a pocket, balls in a bag
Perverted handle, his getting by is a fisted fuck

A faster way to kill them all would take too goddamn long
Absorb through pores the great escape
Aah

Kill that fuck to show him up 
Equal his displeasure now
Stab his ass, a reminded past of what the fuck we live for
Ourselves

Half assed for most his life
Piss poor little ham
Narc boy, a fake fuck limp dick 
Sucking up to the man, yeah

And the world
We need another cold war

Building a blood in water scent
It's like a raping, without judgement
Boy in a pocket, balls in a bag
Perverted handle, his dick his gun, his brain his badge
Aah

Kill that fuck to show him up 
Equal his displeasure now
Stab his ass, a reminded past of what the fuck we live for
Our fucking selves (ourselves, ourselves, ourselves)
