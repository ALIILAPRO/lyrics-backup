		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alright, come close
Let me show you everything I know
The jungle slang
Spinning 'round my head and I stare
While my naked fool
Fresh out of an icky gooey womb
A woozy youth
Dopes up on her silky smooth perfume

Right, my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air, kick it in the sand
I'd say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

My, my simple sir, this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs
I can't take this place, no, I can't take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space

Truth be told
I've been here, I've done this all before
I take your gloom
I curl it up and puff it into plumes

Right, my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip this smooth air, kick it in the sand
I'd say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

My, my simple sir, this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs
I can't take this place, no, I can't take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space

Hold my hand and float back to the summertime
Tangled in the willows now our tongues are tied
How can I believe you? How can I be nice?
Tripping around the tree stumps in your summer smile

Right, my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip this smooth air, kick it in the sand
I'd say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

My, my simple sir, this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs
I can't take this place, no, I can't take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space
