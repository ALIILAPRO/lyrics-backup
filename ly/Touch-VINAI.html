		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know a thing 'bout love
But I know there's something about you
Tell me what you're thinkin' of
'Cause in my head, it's like I always knew

This is a feeling you feel when it's real and
I just can't help myself when you pull me in
My heart is racin', I'm yours for the takin'
So come take it, I'm givin' in

Every time we touch
Can't get enough
And I don't ask for much
Just want your love

Every time we touch
Can't get enough
And I don't ask for much
Just want your love

It's something that you do to me
Head into to the air I breathe
It's like you know exactly what I need, ooh
Mentally and physically

This is a feeling you feel when it's real and
I just can't help myself when you pull me in
My heart is racin', I'm yours for the takin'
So come take it, I'm givin' in

Every time we touch
Can't get enough
And I don't ask for much
Just want your love

Every time we touch
Can't get enough
And I don't ask for much
Just want your love

Every time we touch
Can't get enough
And I don't ask for much
Just want your love
