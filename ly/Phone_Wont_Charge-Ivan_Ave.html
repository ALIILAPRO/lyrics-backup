		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's ill what comes back around if you hold on
I know I haven't been looking up this whole time
For all I know hope might have hit me up but my shit just won't charge
Looking at my very own like do I really know y'all?

I was with Joyce walking around cooling
When she was in town for a party with Mutual we
Talked about the hardships of being boo'd up
Doom in the back of my mind but I'm feeling super
Then she went on her phone pulled the news up
Another lost soul found a mosque to shoot up
You don't gotta guess the skin colour of the shooter
When the newspapers had him looking all cute and suited up
Wormholes to bullet holes who do you trust?
I don't know shit and my phone won't charge
Houston we got a problem they be shooting like Russ
I ain't get hit cause my phone won't charge
Dreams of putting my mind in flight mode
Meets that feeling of needing that high though
I don't know who be writing the code for the slide show rolling in front of my eyes though
I mute that like a group chat
While I'm working on where to regroup at
It'll never go out of style like a cool hat
1934 you can loop that
it's here

It's ill what'll come back around if you hold on
I know I haven't been looking up this whole time
For all I know hope might have hit me up but my shit just won't charge
Looking at my very own like

Now I gotta talk to them cause my phone won't charge
BBQing with the crew bumping main source
Somebody had to show me cause my phone won't charge
Photos of us BBQin the rain forest
Brainstorming on how to get out the game on them
Dead phone leave it in my Stan Rays on them
By the way it was great seeing your face homie
Still the grind stone rolling in my cell
Sly shit they be sliding big bro the intel
Aw shit they be plotting planet of the incels
While a big booty bot tryna land the sale
And go home
Next day it switched back on
A long text from a ex
Lets scroll

It's ill what comes back around if you hold on
I know I haven 't been looking up this whole time
For all I know hope might have hit me up but my shit just won't charge
Looking at my very own like do I really know y'all?

Hold on
This whole time
Hold on
Do I really know y'all?
