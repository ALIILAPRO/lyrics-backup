		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To all that's out there, look
To all that I had tethered let down

To all have seen the sun over Lorelai
The acetone was melting white

Now I will meet this too
If I repeat it's loop

You called it lots of names
It's all, in equal measure your sea power

Atop the peaks
Touched the moon on the other side
Stood catatonic, held in time

Gotta leave it in the balance, all it stood

Let decay, it's all it stood
Hate the way it got me good
