		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The slayings at Bodom from so long ago
Still carry a secret, of which nobody knows
A seed that was planted as the night turned to dawn
Will now bring me to life as the Reaper's spawn

I'm a bastard of Bodom and I walk alone
As I follow the Reaper, to lead me back home
My victims shall perish on the shores of this lake
As they look upon me, to stare death in the face

I don't need a reason, and I won't tell you why
I'll just take you to hell by the edge of my scythe!

I was born to end life, I can take any form 
A shape shifting demon, killing for sport
Like father, like son, this is my fate
Taking your lives and breeding the hate! 

I don't need a reason, and I won't tell you why
I'll just take you to hell by the edge of my scythe!
