		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Goodbye to my enemies, to my enemies
They try to beat me but I won't surrender
Fear won't be the death of me, d-d-d-death of me
I won't go quietly into the night

My pain is a memory, a m-m-memory
Pouring over like the stormy weather
Won't get the best of me, b-b-b-best of me
I won't go quietly into the light

'Cause I believe underneath
I won't ever lose composure
No defeat, won't retreat
Hold the line until it's over
All my scars are tattoos, they're a work of art
I believe, underneath
I was born to be a soldier

Reaching for my destiny
Goodbye to my enemies

Goodbye to my enemies

Fight 'til the end of me, 'til the end of me
Did you think that it would be that easy?
This ain't a tragedy, a tr-tr-tragedy
I'm not going six feet in the ground

It's not a fever dream, it's reality
Cut me open and my heart's still beating
Healed from my injuries, now I'm on my feet
I'm not going six feet in the ground

'Cause I believe underneath
I won't ever lose composure
No defeat, won't retreat
Hold the line until it's over
All my scars are tattoos, they're a work of art
I believe, underneath
I was born to be a soldier

Reaching for my destiny
Goodbye to my enemies

Goodbye to my enemies

Goodbye to my enemies
