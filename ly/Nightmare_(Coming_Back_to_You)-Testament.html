		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You wanted money, you wanted fame,
You broke the rules before you know the game
Bounds tearing you up like a knife
Wis it was the end of your life, it's a nightmare
Going down that road on account of you
No escape from the things you put me through
I don't know, I don't care, I can't go anywhere,
It's a nightmare coming back to you!

Don't wanna die, just wanna live!
I've got stop taking what they give
So many roads moving all around
I only see the one going down it's a nightmare
Going down the road on account of you
No escape from the things you put me through
I don't know, I don't care, I can't go anywhere it's a nightmare
Coming back to you!

We got to fight, we got to try
When all is gone we'll know the reason why
To kill the enemy we will win the wars
To find the place our life was before, it's a nightmare
Going down that road on account of you
No escape from the things you put me through
I don't know, I don't care, I can't go anywhere
It's a nightmare coming back to you!.. to you!.. to you!..
