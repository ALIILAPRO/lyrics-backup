		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Will you tell me how you feeling?
I can tell that you want me, babe
Will you tell me how you feeling?
But I can feel you and you on the way
(?) Your feelings
I can tell what you want with me
I don't wanna feel it
But I can feel you and you on the way

If I could choose anything
I would be good in bed one day
I would fall into love and stay
I'd fall into love

And it's not fair
I keep on writing a sequel to stories
I know that are not there
I don't wanna die, but I don't wanna live like this

I just wanna feel somethin', I just wanna feel
I just wanna feel somethin', I just wanna feel
Somethin' really real, so that I can really
Feel like a person again
I just wanna feel somethin', I just wanna feel
I just wanna feel somethin', I just wanna feel
Somethin' really real, so that I can really
Feel like a person again, 'gain, 'gain

Verse
I just took a pill, so that I could really feel
Lights be gettin' blindin' like the diamonds in my grills (I'm shinin')
All my opps know drinks ain't the only thing we gon' spill (yessir)
Thank God my niggas didn't let me get behind the wheel (brrt)
Old thing on the phone
Lil' zip for the trip and a shot of Patron (sheesh)
She wanna text back 'cause she miss the cologne
Pasque killed the beat so I had to chamon, look
Had to try again like Aaliyah
Drowned in my feelings but I love to see the ee-ah (true)
This ain't about no signs
Smoke a lil' somethin', eliminate my pride (bitch)

I just wanna feel somethin', I just wanna feel
I just wanna feel somethin', I just wanna feel
Somethin' really real, so that I can really
Feel like a person again, 'gain, 'gain, 'gain
I just wanna feel somethin', I just wanna feel (feel)
I just wanna feel somethin', I just wanna feel
Somethin' really real, so that I can really
Feel like a person again, 'gain, 'gain

Oh, honey, yes
Want you, yes
Fuck you, yes
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Nothin' left
Gave you the rest
Tried my best
Yes, yes, yes, yes

Can you tell me a secret? (Yes, yes, yes, yes)
I know I should be angry (say yes, yes, yes, yes)
Can you tell me a secret? (Yes, yes, yes, yes)
Can you tell me what's wrong with me? (Yeah)
No

I just wanna feel somethin', I just wanna feel (feel)
I just wanna feel somethin', I just wanna feel
Somethin' really real, so that I can really
Feel like a person again, 'gain, 'gain

Oh, I keep a bad bitch on my mind
Ooh-ooh, mm-mm, mm
