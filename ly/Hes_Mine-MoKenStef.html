		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He might be doin' you, but he's thinkin' about me
So lady, think about another lover and go find another brother
I know he's my man, he's all in my hands
It feels good when he calls my name
Don't you wish you had the same?
Feeling disgust workin' your stuff
'Til he thinks about mine, now he's feeling real high
You ask why, 'cause he's mine
Tell you something that just ain't cool
Never fall in love with a man who don't love you
Oh, I wouldn't waste my time telling you something wrong
You been with him one night and now he's coming home

He's mine
You might have had him once
But I got him all the time (you can't sleep at night)
He's mine
You might have had him once
But I got him all the time (don't try to dry your eyes)
He's mine
You may of had him once
But I got him all the time (I got him all the time)

Went out on a date, wasn't out too late
Took you to a room and you gave it up too soon
Played you like a trick, 'cause you let him hit
Now he's coming home to a lover that is strong

I got all his love, baby, don't try to take it
You wanted a piece, you were mistaken
'Cause he belongs to me, baby, can't you see?
I tell you something that just ain't cool
Never fall in love with a man who don't love you, oh
I wouldn't waste my time telling you something wrong
You've been with him one night, now he's coming home

He's mine
You might have had him once
But I got him all the time (he's mine)
He's mine
You might have had him once
But I got him all the time (he's mine)
He's mine
You might have had him once
But I got him all the time (he's mine)
He's mine
You might have had him once
But I got him all the time

We don't have time, playing these games
You had him once, but it's me on his mind
No need to cry, go dry your eyes
Get over it, it was only for one night, ooh yeah

He's mine
You might have had him once
But I got him all the time
He's mine, he's mine
You might have had him once
But I got him all the time (don't try to dry your eyes)
He's mine (ooh, ooh)
He's mine
You might have had him once
But I got him all the time
He's mine
You might have had him once
But I got him all the time
