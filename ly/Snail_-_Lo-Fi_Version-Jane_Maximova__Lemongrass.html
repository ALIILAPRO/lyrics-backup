		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a snail climbing to the top of the cherry dream 
Through the frozen bark waves
A little girl playing on the tree
Is calling me--
The voice I still hear

Hurry, my enchanted princess
Your day has come
It's not a dream
Welcome to my blooming kingdom
Who knows, maybe your love is already here

Grandma knits a long-life scarf 
The shadows play on her freckled fingers 
Childhood floats on the knitted field
Stitch by stitch--   
Her girl is singing

Hurry, my enchanted princess
Your day has come
It's not a dream
Welcome to my blooming kingdom
Who knows, maybe your love is already here
