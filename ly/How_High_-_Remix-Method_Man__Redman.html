		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Latest record? We stole it from somebody else
Takin' it from the top? (Top)
(Hell yeah, we takin' it from the top)
Tippy? (Tippy)
Come on, my people
Sing it, daddy
Hey
Fly robin, fly (we rock)
Ha (yeah, ah), ha ha
Ha ha (aha)
Fly robin, fly
(Taking my mind where it's never gone before)
Fly robin, fly (and so like a mushroom in cow shit)
(And I'm taking it just to get the ultimate high, baby)
(Redman) 
Up, up to the sky (the ultimate high, ohh)
(Method Man)

Excuse me as I kiss the sky
Sing a song of sixpence, a pocket full a rye
Who the fuck wanna die for their culture?
Stalk the dead body like a vulture, Ticalion, hmm
Blacker than your blackest stallion
Hit your housing projects
I represent yo' Shaolin, my nigga
Now yes, Apocalypse now, the gun pow
It be going down, diggy diggy down, diggy down down

While the planets and the stars and the moons collapse
When I raise my trigger finger all y'all niggas hit the deck (yeah)
'Cause ain't no need for that, hustlers and hardcore
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs
The Green-Eyed Bandit can't stand it
With more fruitier loops than that Toucan Sam bitch
Plus the Bombazee got me wide
Messing with them
Is a straight suicide

Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
It's the Funk Doctor Spock smokin' lah on the train
How high? So high that I can kiss the sky
(Up, up to the sky) yeaheah, check it out y'all, uh
(Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane)
Recognize Johnny Blaze, ain't a damn thing changed
How high? So high that I can kiss the sky
(Up, up to the sky) yeah, yeah, Tical

Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four
Three, two, murder one lyric at your door
Tical bring it to that ass raw
Breaking all the rules like glass jaws
Nigga, you got to get mines to get yours
Fucka, we don't need no rap tour
I'd rather kick the facts and catch you with the rap-ture
More than you bargained for
Tical, I stays open like an all night store (yeah, yeah, ah)
For real I keeps it ill like a piece of blue steel
Pointed at your temple with the intent to kill
And end your existence, M-E-T (yeah)
Ain't no use for resistance, H-O-D

I shift like a clutch with the Ruck
Examine my nuts, I don't stop 'til I get enough
Six million ways to die, so I chose
Made it six million and one with your eyes closed
The blindfold cold, so you can feel the wrath
And shatter the glass and second half on your funky ass
And, yo, my man (Tical) hit me now
Bitches used to play me now they can't forget me now
They get me mad, I rock the spot, check Glock
Empty off a licking off a hip-hop
Fuck the Billboard, I'm a bullet on my block
How you dope when you paid for your Billboard spot?

Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
It's the Funk Doctor Spock smokin' la) on the train
How high? So high that I can kiss the sky
(Up, up to the sky) yeah, yeah, ha, word up

As I run a mile with a racist
My style was born in the pissy staircases
Dig it, F a rap critic
He talk about it while I live it
If Red got the blunt, I'm the second one to hit it

Look up in the, I got the verbs, nouns and Glocks in ya
Enter the center, lyrics bang like Ricochet Rabbit
I brings havoc with an AK 'matic, rolling blunts an all day habit
I get it on like Smith & Wes', who clique's the best?
Punks take a sip and test, who splits your vest?
The funk phenomenon, I'm bombing you like Lebanon
Blow canals of Panama just off stamina

Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
It's the Funk Doctor Spock smokin' lah on the train
How high? So high that I can kiss the sky
(Up, up to the sky) yeah, huh, huh, yeah, yeah
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Recognize Johnny Blaze, ain't a damn thing changed
How high? So high that I can kiss the sky
(Up, up to the sky) yeah yeah, word up
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
It's the Funk Doctor Spock smokin' lah on the train
How high? So high that I can kiss the sky
(Up, up to the sky)
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Recognize Johnny Blaze, ain't a damn thing changed
How high?
