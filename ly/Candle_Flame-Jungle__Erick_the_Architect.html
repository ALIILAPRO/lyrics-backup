		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw you there
I know you're there
I cry, you're there
I know you're there

Give me the fire like a candle flame
And better hide because you never change
And you fight the darkness tryin' to feel my hand
In my bed, in my bed
(Let's go)

Feel like the first time I made time in a minute
Rock with it, I'm unintended
How can we put these feelings aside
I gotta match the fires to the flame
The feelings got attached
I got the days falling straight, fall away
All the ways you started dancing on me
Had to take you back home
Time movin' slow we fast forward

Give me the fire like a candle flame
And better hide because you never change
And you fight the darkness tryin' to feel my hand
In my bed, in my bed

Butterflies in the belly is sign it's angelic
And like my aesthetic, most try to get it
Lovin' without limits the message is so vivid
'Round and 'round with me, the baby don't mind spinning, word
Put in work and the referral, shawty could be my girl
Look at this little girl, she precious like little pearls
Hair straighter than pearls
Beautiful 'cause you earned, making this thing worth it

Give me the fire like a candle flame
And better hide because you never change
And you fight the darkness tryin' to feel my hand
In my bed, in my bed

(Rock with me like)
Okay, okay
(Rock with me like)

I saw you there
I know you're there
I cry, you're there
I know you're there 
(Let's go)

Give me the fire like a candle flame
And better hide because you never change
And you fight the darkness tryin' to feel my hand
In my bed, in my bed

(Rock with me like)
Okay, okay
Let's go
