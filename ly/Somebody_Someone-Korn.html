		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't stand to let you win
I'm just watching you
And I don't know what to do
Feeling like a fool inside
Feeling all the love you hide
Thought you were my friend
Seems it never ends

I need somebody, someone
Can't somebody help me?
All I need is to be
Loved just for me

Giving you with this and that
Giving gave nothing back
It's all related to
All the things I do
Feeling like a fool inside
Seeing all the things you tried
I am nothing

I need somebody, someone
Can't somebody help me?
All I need is to be
Loved just for me

I look, I sign
I need someone
Inside to help me out
With what?
I'm trying, I'm crying, I'm prying
In a pile of shit
I'm dying, I'm dying
I'm dying

I need somebody (someone)
Somebody (somebody)
Someone
I need somebody (someone)
Somebody (somebody)
Someone
Someone
