		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Moon so bright, night so fine
Keep your heart here with mine
Life's a dream, we are dreaming

Race the moon, catch the wind
Ride the night to the end
Seize the day, stand up for the light

I want to spend my lifetime loving you
If that is all in life I ever do

Heroes rise, heroes fall
Rise again, win it all
(In your heart, can't you feel the glory?)
(Through our joy, through our pain)
We can move worlds again
Take my hand, dance with me (dance with me)

I want to spend my lifetime loving you
If that is all in life I ever do

I will want nothing else to see me through
If I can spend my lifetime loving you
(Yea-yeah-ah, yea-yeah)
Whoa-whoa-ohh

Though we know we will never come again
Where there is love, life begins
Over and over again
Save the night, save the day
Save the love, come what may
Love is worth everything we pay

I want to spend my lifetime loving you
If that is all in life I ever do
I want to spend my lifetime loving you
If that is all in life I ever do

I will want nothing else to see me through
If I can spend my lifetime loving you
Loving you, hey-ey-ey
Ooh, hey
