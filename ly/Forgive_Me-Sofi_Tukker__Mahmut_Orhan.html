		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were my reason
You were my brain
You were everything to me, everything with me
And that doesn't change

Now there's no reason
Now there is pain
Now you may be temporarily insane

But I am here
Let me help
Okay, maybe not
I'll just let you yell at me all you want
I'll let you make me into something that I'm not
If that helps you carry on

Forgive me

(Me, Me)

Forgive me

Tell me, does it please you
When I'm full of shame
Because of what happened, 'cause of what has been
As though I'm to blame?

But I am here
Let me help
Okay, maybe not
I'll just let you yell at me all you want
I'll let you make me into something that I'm not
If that helps you carry on

Forgive me
(Please forgive)
(Forgive me)
(Me, Me)

Forgive me
Please, please
Forgive

I am here
Let me help
Okay, maybe not
I'll just let you yell at me all you want
I'll let you make me into something that I'm not
If that helps you carry on

Forgive me
(Please forgive)
(Forgive me)
(Me, Me)

Forgive me
(Please forgive)
(Forgive me)
(Me, Me)

Forgive me
