		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Last week you told me 'bout your parents
How you really think they're way too overbearing
And how you want some independence
Go off to college, meet someone that makes your mother anxious
Well, it could be me

Oh, it could be me, be me, be me
It could be me, be me, be me

I try and act like I'm so careless
Hope you don't notice on the inside I'm feeling embarrassed
I'm second guessing what I'm wearing
Just bought this T-shirt but you're dressed up and you look so cool
Maybe I'll never tell you

But it could be me, be me, be me
It could be me, be me, be me

If I gave you all of my heart, would you take it?
Tell me you would 'cause I need to believe, believe, believe

That it could be me, be me, be me
It could be me, be me, be me
It could be me, be me, be me
Oh, it could be me
