		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Saturday, I feel right
I've been drinkin' all day
Yes I got a date, a midnight ride
I had to get it away
Yea

I'm not a loner, I'm not a fool
Don't need a reason, reason to be cool
I got my whiskey, I got my wine
I got my woman and this time the lights are goin' out

(Saturday night)
High
(Saturday night)
High an' dry
(Saturday night)
I'm high
(Saturday night)
High an' dry
Oww

I feel bad, I feel mean
I'm up and down, I'm in between
I'm the bottle, I'm on the line
I'm up and feelin' fine

Ohh I'm not a loner, I'm not a fool
Don't need a reason, reason to be cool
I got my whiskey, I got my wine
I got my woman, and this time the lights are goin' out

(Saturday night)
High
(Saturday night)
High an' dry
(Saturday night)
I'm high
(Saturday night)
High an' dry
Ohh take me high

Saturday, kickin' out
Her train was comin' to me
I gotta move, number one
Saturday night on the run

Well
(Saturday night)
High
(Saturday night)
High an' dry
(Saturday night)
Got my whiskey
(Saturday night)
Got my wine
(Saturday night)
Got my woman
(Saturday night)
High an' dry
You gotta try me tonight
