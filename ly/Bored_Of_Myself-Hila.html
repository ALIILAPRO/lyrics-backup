		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Only happy
When I keep my head down
Come up for air
To see where I'm at now
What'd you expect
Stuck where I started
Why even bother
Making a promise
I could lie
And tell myself
I've never tried
Easier this way
I'll tell myself a lie
I know we've been here before
Said next time I'd love me more
I'm starting to get real bored
Finding myself
Do they all like me more
Deleting posts on the floor
I'm starting to get real bored
Of myself
I'm getting tired
Of being the one that's left behind
Is it a crime
Watching the world just pass me by
I could turn my eyes away
And never cry
Passing by the exit lane
I'm paralyzed
I know we've been here before
Said next time I'd love me more
I'm starting to get real bored
Finding myself
Do they all like me more
Deleting posts on the floor
I'm starting to get real bored
Of myself
It's all the same
I'm getting bored of myself
Nothing will change
I'm getting bored of myself
I'm getting bored of myself
What's it feel like to be ok
Need parts to fix old damage
I know we've been here before
Said next time I'd love me more
I'm starting to get real bored
Finding myself
Do they all like me more
Deleting posts on the floor
I'm starting to get real bored
Of myself
