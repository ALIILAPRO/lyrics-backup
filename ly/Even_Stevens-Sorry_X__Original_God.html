		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want to fight all night, let's just call it even
I don't want to say goodbye if it means you're leaving
I know I pretend like I don't care
But this game we play isn't fair
Never-ending truth or dare, dare, dare
Break my heart, leave me bleeding
Walk away like it's treason
Agree to disagree then
'Cause we both have our reasons
I'll wait until the dust settles
'Cause right now you're on another level
No use in getting even, we both know we are at odds
We're meant for each other only lover only one I want
I could give you everything make my heart sing believe in God
You're so perfect make me want to love and turn right every wrong
I don't want to fight all night, let's just call it even
I don't want to say goodbye if it means you're leaving
I know I pretend like I don't care
But this game we play isn't fair
Never-ending truth or dare, dare, dare
Dare me
Tear me
Who would ever thought true love is scary
You're the only want I want to marry
And the things that haunted me made me tread carefully
Seeing you cry oh nothing feels worse
I said I'd die if it makes you less hurt
I'm on your side I'll make sure this works
I'm just not used to smiling, guess for me it's a first
The only thing I fear is losing you
Remember that our love is bulletproof
I don't want to fight all night, let's just call it even
I don't want to say goodbye if it means you're leaving
I know I pretend like I don't care
But this game we play isn't fair
Never-ending truth or dare, dare, dare
