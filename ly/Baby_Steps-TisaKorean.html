		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She pull my pants down
She ain't got my consent
She got a tongue ring, I know her intent
I know her pussy good because
Her stomach got a pudge
White tee with a white styrofoam cup
Watch me take some baby steps
Walking in the club
Watch me take some baby steps
Walking in the club it's way too packed
There ain't no parking spots around the club
I'm a ladies man, so these hoes show me love

Yeah, I'm in the Charger
But I do not need a plug
I'm always 'round that green
You would think I was a bug
You think that I'm gon pay $20
To get in the club
I ain't talking bout a gallon
When it's time to jugg
I popped a Tylеnol then I downed that alcohol
She got a OnlyFans, shе a thot after all

Like a flower, shawty said she love my scent
I'm at her house so much
You'd think I'm paying rent
From the back, bitch, I'm tryna leave a dent
I ain't finna pay to get in this event

She pull my pants down
She ain't got my consent
She got a tongue ring, I know her intent
I know her pussy good because
Her stomach got a pudge
White tee with a white styrofoam cup
Watch me take some baby steps
Walking in the club
Watch me take some baby steps
Walking in the club it's way too packed
There ain't no parking spots around the club
Ima be good cause these hoes show me love
Watch me take some baby steps
Walking in the club
Watch me take some baby steps
Walking in the club

(In the club, Jugg)
(Alcohol)
