		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just sort of always feel sick without you baby
I ain't got anything to lick without you, baby
Nothing seems to stick without you, baby
Ain't I fallen in love?
It's just the pits without you, baby
It's really just the pits without you, baby
It's like everyone's a dick without you, baby
Ain't I fallen in love?

And all my pals will tell me is that I'm crazy
You bet I'm loopy alright
And I just don't recognize this fool 
That you have made me
Whoa, I ain't seen him for a while
And as you're shrinking figure blows a kiss
I catch and smash it on my lips
Darling, I can't seem to quit
Completely falling to bits
I really might be losing it
The idea that you existed 
All along's ridiculous
I don't know what to say

Baby, we ought to fuck seven years of bad luck
Out the parlour room mirror
Could I have made it any clearer?

It's love like a tongue in a nostril
Love like an ache in the jaw
You're the first day of spring with a septum piercing
Little Miss Sweet Dreams, TN
