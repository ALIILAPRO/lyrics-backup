		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  [x4]
What you gonna do ? (What ?)
Do you wanna go down ? (Uh)
What you gonna do ?
Do you wanna go down ? (Uh)

Because I'm a beast I'ma marry you
Flying from the east to the west coast
Make love on a beach with no curfew
If you are a big fish, I'm a shark

Feeling like it is the scenario
Flying from the east to the west coast
Make love on the beach like a seastar
If you want a big fish, I'm a shark

And I go, go, go
With the seastars
And I go, go, go
With the seastars

[x6]
What you gonna do ? (What ?)
Do you wanna go down ? (Uh)
What you gonna do ?
Do you wanna go down ? (Uh)

Cute girls on a towel doing yoga
Gold chains on my wrist you know I told ya
A weekend on a boat in California (Waaaow)
Please kiss me while I hold you
And so we're going down yelling "Hell yeah !" (Waaaow)
I drown you just because I can't help it
You know we waited for this a long time
Now everywhere we go is my hometown
This is just a gift for my long travel
Cause I had to build my own tunnel

And I go, go, go
With the seastars
And I go, go, go
With the seastars

I will be with you 'til I die, die
When I'm with you it's alright
I'mma be with you 'til I die, die
When I'm with you it's alright

(Gotta' find a way home)

I wonder why no one
No one wants to come
I wonder sometimes
If you really want to come

Cute girls on a towel doing yoga
Gold chains on my wirst you know I told ya
A weekend on a boat in California (Waaaow)
Please kiss me while I hold you
And so we're going down yelling "Hell Yeah" (Waaaow)
I drown you just because I can't help it
You know we waited for this a long time
Now everywhere we go is my hometown
