		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I was like you i might have had less
Thoughts about murdering myself
But when I see you I'm so happy that I went
You sit there as a
Company of rundown longhaired
Your smell, your clothes
Your brand new fingernails
And I hear you whispering about me

But I will avoid your eyes avoid your eyes

Because I know I am the world's ugliest lady
I used to have less worries of life
Worries of life worries of life
Worries of life
But when I see you I'm so happy that I went
I never dressed like you
I don't know what it is
This feeling of belonging
I ran away from school
Haven't we had such a great time together
No I won't reply to any of your emails
I won't i won't
I never, I've just lost interest
And I still hear you whispering about me

But I will avoid your eyes avoid your eyes

Because I know you all just hate me
And now I have a very good life
A very good life a very good life
A very good life
But people like you don't need to be in it
