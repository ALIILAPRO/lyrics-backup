		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  no grasp on reality, attention shaping identities
we've lost our capacities
to construct something tangible
obfuscate the past 
implode it with the future into 
an undifferentiated mass
It's never-ending
a type of never-ending
never-ending present, lost inside
we have all lost our way out long ago

the spectacle is not a cluster of images
rather it's a social relation
mediated by all those images:
images are all there is
the quality of life is being impoverished
embrace the loss of knowledge 
and critical thinking

the spectacle 
is not a cluster of images, rather it's a social relation
mediated by all those images:
images are all there is
the quality of life is being impoverished
we embrace the rash degradation of knowledge and 
critical thought 
critical thought
we are no longer critical

the spectacle is not a cluster of images, rather, it's a social relation
mediated by all those images:
images are all there is
the quality of life is being impoverished
we embrace the rash degradation of knowledge 
and critical thought 
critical thought 
we are not
critical
