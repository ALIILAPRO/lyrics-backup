		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You always check yourself,
In every mirror you see, Day and night
And it is such a shame,Your vanity is to blame,
Oh why don't you knock it off

It is the pointlessness, that's got me loving less,
I can not handle that your such a wannabe,
Your caught up in yourself, and you don't even see

I won't be cryin' when I'm lonely,
Cause I'll be makin' sure I have a good time,
Ain't nothing wrong when I'm alone now,
Cause I'm alone and I'm proud
I won't be cryin' when I'm lonely

I'm sure you don't believe,
That anybody can tell, your a fool
I'll bet that you believe,
They only think that your cool, and a handsome devil to

But baby trust me now, you better turn around,
Cause otherwise your gonna fall and hit the ground,
Cause all this beauty boy, won't last eternally

I won't be cryin' when I'm lonely,
Cause I'll be makin' sure I have a good time,
Ain't nothing wrong when I'm alone now,
Cause I'm alone and I'm proud
I won't be cryin' when I'm lonely

[Repeat: x14]
Lonely 

I won't be cryin' when I'm lonely,
Cause I'll be makin' sure I have a good time,
Ain't nothing wrong when I'm alone now,
Cause I'm alone and I'm proud
I won't be cryin' when I'm lonely
Cause I'll be makin' sure I have a good time,
Cause 't nothing wrong when I'm alone now,
Cause I'm alone and I'm proud
I won't be cryin' when I'm lonely
