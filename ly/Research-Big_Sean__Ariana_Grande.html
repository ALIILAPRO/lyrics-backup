		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  These hoes be doing research
I swear she like, "this piece of hair off in the sink ain't come from me first, no, no."

The way you stressin' got me blowin' indo outdoor
Everytime your intro that's my queue to outro
And I know all my niggas call you crazy
You just misunderstood though
Through all the evil in your eyes swear I can still see the good though
But you unlockin' my cell like you is a cop
How you decode all my V-mails, G-mails even P.O. boxes got me P.O.'d
You saw my emails with CeCe when you wasn't CC'd
I'm on my way to halfway my baby I need you to meet me
You talkin' bout I had the key to your heart
Then I got my first European you took that key then you keyed it
What type of shit do we be in?
Blowin' up TNTn'
Hella drama, TMZ'n
Bitch I'm leavin' then she switched the shit like

I just had to hide, hide, hide, hide
Now you next to me at night, night, night, night
You test me all the time, time, time, time
Say I know what you like, like I did the last time
Do you remember? Do you remember?
Do you remember?
When you had nothing to hide, hide, hide, hide

Watch out these hoes be doing research
I swear she like, "this piece of hair off in the sink ain't come from me first, no, no."
You hang around too God damn long it's like you need work
Man, these hoes be doing research
Doin' research

Okay I know you did some research, well shit I did too
I saw you wearin' Drake's chain like you was part of his crew
I saw you chillin' with Meek Mill up at the Summer Jam oh
I hope my eyes the one that's lying to me girl and not you
I know we all done got a past but there's shit that I can't pass
Seein' you at the Soho house I know you can't afford that tab
When I run into Chris Brown and he laugh cause he know what you know
What I don't, it make me feel like I don't know your ass

I just had to hide, hide, hide, hide
Now you next to me at night, night, night, night
You test me all the time, time, time, time
Say I know what you like, like I did the last time
Do you remember? Do you remember?
Do you remember?
When you have nothing to hide, hide, hide, hide

These hoes be doing research
I swear she like, "this piece of hair off in the sink ain't come from me first, no, no."
You hang around too God damn long it's like you need work
Man, these hoes be doing research
Doin' research
