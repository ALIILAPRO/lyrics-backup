		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm sprung
Dog, she got me
Got me doin' things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin' you
I'm sprung (I'm sprung)
Dog, she got me
Got me doin' things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin' you

You do (you do)
You do (you do)
You do (you do)
You do (you do)
(You do) do do do
(You do) do-do-do do do
(You do) do-do-do, do-do do-do
Ooh

She got me doin' the dishes
Anything she want for some kisses
I'm cookin' for her when she gets hungry
All she doin' is actin' like she want me
She cuttin' off all my homies
Even all my other ronis
She ain't even my main lady
See I been thinkin' bout it lately
Man she really don't deserve me
All she wanna do is hurt me
So I gotta get away from her
But now I'm leaving quickly
Before she come and try to kick me
And I'm takin' everything with me
Well, it all come down to how

I'm sprung
Dog, she got me
Got me doin' things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin' you
I'm sprung (I'm sprung)
Dog, she got me
Got me doin' things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin' you

You do (you do)
You do (you do)
You do (you do)
You do (you do)
(You do) do do do
(You do) do-do-do do do
(You do) do-do-do, do-do do-do
Ooh

So we went our separate ways
It's been a couple of days
But now I'm doin' what I want to
With nobody tellin' me what I'm gon' do
And I'm feelin' so free
With nobody but me, uh
Now I can handle all my business
All of my fellas, can I get a witness?
But I'm feelin' kinda lonely
On top of that, I'm kinda horny
Man, I gotta get back to her
But now I'm leaving quickly
Before she come and try to kick me
And I'm takin' everything with me
Well, it all come down to how

I'm sprung
Dog, she got me
Got me doin' things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin' you
I'm sprung (I'm sprung)
Dog, she got me
Got me doin' things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin' you

(You do) do do do
(You do) do-do-do do do
(You do) do-do-do, do-do do-do
(You do) ooh
(You do) do do do
(You do) do-do-do do do
(You do) do-do-do, do-do do-do
Ooh

She got me doin' what I won't do
Got you sprung and I told you
You don't agree with me
In the end, you'll see that
She got you doin' what you won't do
Now you're sprung and I told you
S-P-R-U-N-G
Now you see she got you
Got you
Got you
Got you
She got you
Got you
Got you
