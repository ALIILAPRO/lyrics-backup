		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE 
I WOULD SEE YOU AGAIN
EVEN WHEN YOU FIND MY LOVE 
I WAS FALLING APART
EVEN WHEN YOU RUN MY LIFE

IT’S ALWAYS THE SAME 
I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE
I WOULD LEAVE IT AT THAT
LEAVE IT TO THE UNKNOWN 
WHAT A SCIENCE I KNOW
LET IT BE WHATEVER NOW

ROUND AND ROUND
ONE STOP ONE
ONE STOP

EVEN WHEN YOU RUN MY LIFE 
I WAS EASY TO BREAK
I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE 
I WAS EASY TO FIND
LEAVE IT TO THE UNKNOWN 
WHAT A SCIENCE I KNOW
EVEN WHEN YOU RUN MY LIFE 
IT’S EASY TO ARRIVE
EVEN WHEN YOU’RE GONE 
IT’S EASY TO ARRIVE

GET A ROCK GET A ROCKET
WHY YOU DIG ‘EM DOWN 
IF THEY’RE GOING TO HEAVEN
I WANNA BE A CHILD
