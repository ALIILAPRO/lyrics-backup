		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't mind
Lettin' you down easy but just give it time
If it don't hurt now, but just wait, just wait a while
You're not the big fish in the pond no more
You are what they're feedin' on

So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you?
So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you?

Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world?
Ain't it good
Bein' all alone?

Where you're from
You might be the one who's runnin' things
Well, you can ring anybody's bell and get what you want
See, it's easy to ignore trouble
When you're livin' in a bubble

So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you?
So what are you gonna do
When nobody wants to fool with you?

Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world?
Ain't it good
Bein' all alone?
Ain't it good to be on your own?
Ain't it fun you can't count on no one?
Ain't it good to be on your own?
Ain't it fun you can't count on no one?
Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world?

Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world

Ain't it fun? Ain't it fun?
Baby, now you're one of us
Ain't it fun? Ain't it fun?
Ain't it fun?

Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world?
Ain't it good, ain't it good
Bein' all alone?
Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world?
('Cause the world don't orbit around you)
Ain't it good, ain't it good
Bein' all alone?

Don't go cryin' to your mama (now to your mama)
'Cause you're on your own in the real world (don't go cryin')
Don't go cryin' to your mama (to your mama)
'Cause you're on your own (hey) in the real world (world)
Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own, this is the real world
Don't go cryin' to your mama (don't go cryin')
'Cause you're on your own in the real world (this is the real world)
Don't go cryin' (this is the real world) to your mama (don't go cryin')
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin' (don't you cry) to your mama (to your mama)
'Cause you're on your own ('cause you're on your own) in the real world
Don't go cryin' (don't you go, don't you go cryin')
Don't go cryin' (you're on your own)
Don't go cryin' (don't go, don't go cryin' to your mama)
Don't go cryin' (don't you cry)
