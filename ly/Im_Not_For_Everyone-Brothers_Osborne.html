		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some people clap on the one and three
Some people clap on the two and four
Some people don't join at all 
'Cause they got no rhythm
And that's alright
Some people, they drink too much
Some people don't drink enough
Some people are just like me
I hope y'all forgive 'em

I'm like scotch and zydeco bands
I'm like B-side Townes Van Zandt
I'm always speaking my mind
When I'm better off biting my tongue
I'm a bad joke at the wrong time
Hell, I'm a legend in my own mind
I'm good for some but I'm not for everyone

If I was sweet tea, it'd be a bit bitter
If you took a drink, you might reconsider
If I was a church, I'd be hanging with the sinners
Talking 'bout Hendrix and Heaven
If I was a bar, I'd be a dive
A free jukebox in a double-wide
Neon lights saying "Come inside"
And I'd be "Open 24/7"

I'm like scotch and zydeco bands
I'm like B-side Townes Van Zandt
I'm always speaking my mind
When I'm better off biting my tongue
I'm a bad joke at the wrong time
Hell, I'm a legend in my own mind
I'm good for some but I'm not for everyone

Yeah, I'm hard to love, it's true
I'm a little more rough than smooth
It's a wonder I found somebody like me, like you

I'm like scotch and zydeco bands
I'm like B-side Townes Van Zandt
I'm always speaking my mind
When I'm better off biting my tongue
I'm a bad joke at the wrong time
Hell, I'm a legend in my own mind
I'm good for some but I'm not for everyone
Yeah, I'm good for some but I'm not for everyone
