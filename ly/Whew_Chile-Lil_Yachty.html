		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This shit sound like motherfuckin' Final Fantasy, goddamn
Zelda, some shit like that
Nintendo 64 type shit, no cap, ha
Go

I don't wanna be friends, that's the old me (uh-uh), ayy
Diamonds in my ears like anchovies (ice)
My big brother by my side like Ginobli (uh-uh, boom)
He a shooter, his percentage just like Kobe (uh-uh, perfect)
Whew, child (uh-uh)
She was suckin' my dick like wow (uh-uh)
Bein' broke never was in style (uh-uh)
Lil' boy, go get your ass a job right now (uh-uh)

Uh-uh
Niggas tryna stop my grind
Sixty racks into number nine's (number nine's)
And I renegade y'all like Columbine (Columbine)
I be paranoid, move wisely (oh)
Now my brothers got my back like Isley (oh)
Just like ice box, got my brother's new ice piece (oh, whoa)
Now hundred horses in that whip, it's like lightnin' (skrrt)
Ooh, so enticing (oh no)
Got that bitch up on her knees like the dice game
Got the money in a chokehold, no fightin' (no fightin')
Diamonds bitin', I know these niggas hidin'

I don't wanna be friends, that's the old me (uh-uh), ayy
Diamonds in my ears like anchovies (ice)
My big brother better by my side like Ginobli (uh-uh, boom)
He a shooter, his percentage just like Kobe (uh-uh, perfect)
Whew, child (uh-uh)
She was suckin' my dick like wow (uh-uh)
Bein' broke never was in style (uh-uh)
Lil' boy, go get your ass a job right now (uh-uh)

It's automatic (auto), transcending (tran')
My bitch know that I am back bendin' (Bend)
Rack spendin', Bentley slingin' (slingin')
Often totin', quick to cause commotion (commotion)
Rob from my brother like the last time
Play with me, he flashin' red like a stop sign (frrp)
Fuck a bad bitch, don't care her skin tone like I'm colorblind (frrp)
Don't make 'em suffer, bro, spare that lil' boy, he ain't know

I don't wanna be friends, that's the old me (uh-uh), ayy
Diamonds in my ears like anchovies (ice)
My big brother better by my side like Ginobli (uh-uh, boom)
He a shooter, his percentage just like Kobe (uh-uh, perfect)
Whew, child (uh-uh)
She was suckin' my dick like wow (uh-uh)
Bein' broke never was in style (uh-uh)
Lil' boy, go get your ass a job right now (uh-uh)

Uh-uh, whew, child (uh-uh), whew, child (uh-uh)
Whew, child (uh-uh), number nine, whew, whew, child (uh-huh)
Don't go (uh-uh), whew, child, whew, child (uh-uh)
Whew, child (uh-uh), whew, whew, child
Whew, child (Let me be), I'm not your friend, don't call me so (uh-uh, whew, child)
Whew, child (uh-uh), oh, no, whew, whew child (uh-uh)
Child (uh-uh), whew, child (uh-uh)
Whew, child (uh-uh)
