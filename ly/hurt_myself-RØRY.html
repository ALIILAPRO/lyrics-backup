		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe if I hurt myself, you could be the bandage
I dont wanna ask for help, you'd call it baggage 
I can't lose my mental health, cos I never had it 
If I hurt my, maybe if I hurt myself 

I learnt love was  destruction,   
No truth and no discussion,
Felt so safe in the chaos 
Fuck I think I was brainwashed 

My tears are just like dust, you sweep under the rug 
My fears my blood would teach me to love

Watch me as I try and breath underwater 
What if I just killed my fathers daughter 
What if I wore my trauma, like a badge of honor 
You'd see me, yeah

Maybe If I hurt myself, you could be the bandage
I dont wanna ask for help, you'd call it baggage 
I can't lose my mental health, cos I never had it 
If I hurt my, maybe if I hurt myself  

I'm dying for attention, you met me with aggression 
And promised me protection, funny how it works out like that 

Cos now i'm your projection, used your love as a weapon 
You'd think I'd learn my lesson, so, why do I run back

Watch me as I try and breath underwater
What if I wore my trauma, like a badge of honor 

Maybe If I hurt myself, you could be the bandage
I dont wanna ask for help, you'd call it baggage 
I can't lose my mental health, cos I never had it 
Maybe if I hurt my, maybe if I hurt myself 

Na na na
Na na na
Maybe if I hurt my, maybe if I hurt myself
