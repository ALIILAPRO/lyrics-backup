		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I doubt you, the first time I let it go
You say virtue but animals are all we know
I've seen my last breath that I will take
And seas will rise but it's a shame to go that way

And how far we've come too late
And how much we've grown so slow
And I know I know that we will turn to dust
I'll hold my head up straight spine
And pray we'll be just fine

My body's breaking
Breaking from the inside out
My structures shaking
Shaking since we tasted doubt
So leave me here
To play my victim card
I'll be right here alone

And how far we've come too late
And how much we've grown so slow
And I know I know that we will turn to dust
I'll hold my head up straight spine
And pray we'll be just fine

Time it keeps running down
The world keeps spinning round

Time it keeps running down
The world keeps spinning round

How far we've come too late
And how much we've grown so slow
And I know I know machines will turn to rush
Let's hold our heads up straight spine
And pray we'll be just fine
