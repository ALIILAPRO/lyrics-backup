		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It seems like weeks since you looked at me baby 
Without that look of distaste 
I don't know why your feelings are changing 
But I've seen it in your face 
All those times when our lips were kissing 
Our tongues were telling lies 
And all those signs that I've been missing 
Were right there in your eyes. 

So come on babe, let's kiss this thing goodbye. 

I sometimes feel when we're together baby, 
Everything has turned out wrong 
And I know you feel exactly the same way 
But still we carry on. 
I've been waiting up by the window 
Watching these cars go by 
And I tell myself that I'll go through the motions 
For the last time tonight. 

So come on babe, let's kiss this thing goodbye. 

Now I'm watching the fumes foul up the sunrise 
I'm watching the light fade away 
And I'm hoping tonight that I'll open the door 
And you'll stand here and say 

Come on babe, let's kiss this thing goodbye 
Better make it sooner than later 
Before it all turns sour 
We'd better kiss this thing 
Goodbye.
