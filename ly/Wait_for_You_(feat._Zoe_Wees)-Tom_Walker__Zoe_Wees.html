		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm just praying you can figure this out
When there's nothing left, you know I'll still be around
And if all of this is dragging you under
I'll remind you of the world and its wonder
I'm just praying we can figure this out

These bitter dreams, they seem to last
And even though it's in the past

I know it's hard for you to talk
Bare your soul and open up
I will wait for you, I will wait for you
Can't pretend to understand
I'll be here to hold your hand
I will wait for you, I will wait for you

I can't imagine everything you've been through
You've taken the bad times and made 'em good
'Cause when everything is dragging me under
You remind me of the world and its wonder
And I'm just glad that we have figured this out

These bitter dreams, they seem to last
And even though it's in the past

I know it's hard for you to talk
Bare your soul and open up
I will wait for you, I will wait for you
Can't pretend to understand
I'll be here to hold your hand
I will wait for you, I will wait for you

I've never met someone as strong as you
I've never met someone as loved as you
I've never met someone like you
I've never met someone like you

'Cause only you could make this into something beautiful
Only you could make a bitter song so sweet
And I can't pretend to understand
But I'll be here to hold your hand
I will wait for you
