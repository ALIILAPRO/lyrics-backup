		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I was twelve I fell right out of a tree
I saw the birds and the bees start laughing at me
I'm not a cat, I can't quite land on my feet
But damn, that'd be sweet

Can't hop a fence to save my life
I've been a gym class disaster since '99
In my defense I always try
But there's some heights you just can't climb

Nothing is harder to get over
Than a tall boy, a tall boy
Nothing is harder to get over
Than a tall boy, than a tall boy (tall, tall, tall)

My type was six-four, Sport shorts, hitting their heads
On every normally sized door, made them forget
To think about me, busy sharing a bed
With a couple Sophie's instead

Can't hop a fence to save my life
I've been a gym class disaster since '99
In my defense I always try
And despite all the heights I've climb

Nothing is harder to get over
Than a tall boy, a tall boy
Nothing is harder to get over
Than a tall boy, than a tall boy (tall, tall, tall)

Be careful falling for a tall boy
You'll be falling for a long time
(Falling for a tall boy)

Be careful falling for a tall boy
You'll be falling for a long time
(Falling for a tall boy, tall boy)

Nothing is harder to get over
Than a tall boy, a tall boy
Nothing is harder to get over
Than a tall boy, than a tall boy (tall, tall, tall)

Be careful falling for a tall boy
You'll be falling for a long time
For a tall boy (tall, tall, tall)
