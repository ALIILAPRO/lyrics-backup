		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We rented a truck and a semi to go 
Travel down the long and the winding road
Look on the map, I think we've been there before
Close up the doors, let's roll once more

Cop's on the corner, look he's starting to write
I don't need no ticket so I screamed out of sight
Drove so fast that my eyes can't see
Look in the mirror, is he still following me?

Let it roll down the highway
Let it roll down the highway
Roll, roll

Look at the sign, we're in the wrong place
Move out boys and let's get ready to race
Four fifty-four's coming over the hill
The man on patrol is gonna give us a bill

Time's real short, you know the distance is long
I'd like to have a jet but it's not in the song
Climb back in the cab, cross my fingers for luck
We gotta keep moving if we're going to make a buck

Let it roll down the highway
Let it roll down the highway
Roll

Roll on

(Let it roll)
(Let it roll)

Let it roll
Let it roll
Let it roll
Let it roll

Let it roll down the highway
Let it roll down the highway
Roll, roll, (let it) roll

Down the highway
Let it roll down the highway
Roll, roll, roll

Let it roll down the highway (whoa)
Let it roll down the highway
Roll, roll, roll
