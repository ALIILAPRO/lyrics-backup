		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a lesson too late for the learnin'
Made of sand, made of sand
In the wink of an eye my soul is turnin'
In your hand, in your hand

Are you going away with no word of farewell?
Will there be not a trace left behind?
Well, I could have loved you better
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
You've got reasons a-plenty for goin'
This I know, this I know
For the weeds have been steadily growin'
Please don't go, please don't go

As we walk, all my thoughts are a-tumblin'
Round and round, round and round
Underneath our feet the subways rumblin'
Underground, underground

As I lie in my bed in the mornin'
Without you, without you
Every song in my breast dies a bornin'
Without you, without you

Well I met this young girl at a folk club
Like you do, like you do
So I bought her a drink and we chatted
Wouldn't you, wouldn't you
And then after the show she invited me home
And she said we were two of a kind
Then she played me every record
That Tom Paxton ever made
And you know that was the last thing on my mind
