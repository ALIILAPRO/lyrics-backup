		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A is for Allah, nothing but Allah
Ba is the beginning of Bismillah
Ta is for Taqwa, bewaring of Allah
And Tha is for Thawab, a reward

Ja is for Jannah, the garden of paradise
Ḥa is for Ḥajj, the blessed pilgrimage
Kha is for Khātam, the seal of the Prophethood
Given to the Prophet Muhammad (SallAllahu alayhi wa-sallam)

Da is for Din, Al-Islam
Religion with Allah since time began
Dha is for dhikr, remembering Allah
And Ra is for the month of Ramadān
Oh Ramadan

Za is for Zakah to cure our greed
When we give our money to those in need
Sa is for Salamun Alaykum
Peace be with you, Wa’alaykum-u-Salam
Sha is for shams, the shining sun
Which Allah placed for everyone
And Ṣa is for Salah, for when we pray
Facing Him every day
Facing Him till we meet our lord

Allah, there’s only one God
And Muẖammad is His Messenger
Allah, la ilaha illAllah

Da is for Duha, the morning light
The sun has turned from red to white
Ta is for Ṭariq, the path to walk upon
And Da is for Dil, a shadow
And A is for Ilm, the thing to know
To make our knowledge grow, in Islam

Gha is for Ghayb, a world unseen
And that we know is not a dream
And Fa is for the opening, Al-Fatiẖa
And Qa for the Qur’an, the book of God
And Ka is for Kalima, a word we’re taught
To teach us what is good and what is not

And La is for the beginning of La-ilaha-illAllah
Ma is for the Messenger, Muhammad-ur-Rasululllah
La-ilaha-illAllah, Muẖammad-ur-Rasululllah

Allah, there’s only one God
And Muẖammad is His Messenger
Allah, la ilaha illAllah

Na is for Nawm, the sleep God gave
To give us rest after the day
Ha is for the Hijra, the journey that the Prophet made
And Wa for Wudu before we pray
To help us wash our sins away
And Ya is for Yawm udDin

Allah, there’s only one God
And Muẖammad is His Messenger
Allah, la ilaha illAllah
Allah, there’s only one God
And Jesus was His Messenger
Allah, la ilaha illAllah
Allah, there’s only one God
And Moses was His Messenger
Allah, la ilaha illAllah
Allah, there’s only one God
And Abraham was His Messenger
Allah, la ilaha illAllah
Allah, there’s only one God
And Noah was His Messenger
Allah, la ilaha illAllah
Allah, there’s only one God
And he created Adam
And we are the children of Adam
Allah, la ilaha illAllah
