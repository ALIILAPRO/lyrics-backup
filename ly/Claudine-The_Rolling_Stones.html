		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again, Claudine 

Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again
She only does it at weekends
Claudine

Now only Spider knows for sure
But he ain't talkin' about it any more
Isn't, Claudine? 

There's blood in the chalet
And blood in the snow
She washed her hands of the whole damn show
Claudine 

She shot him once right through the head
She shot him twice right through the chest
The judge says ruled it was an accident Claudine
Accidents will happen

And Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again, Claudine

Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again, Claudine

Hey go baby
Go baby

Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again, Claudine 
Oh Claudine
Oh Claudine
Oh Claudine

Now I threaten my wife with a gun
But I always leave the safety on
I recommend it Claudine 

Yea she pistol whipped me once or twice
But she never tried to take my life
What do you think about that
Claudine 

Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again
She only does it at weekends Claudine 

Oh Claudine
Oh Claudine
Oh Claudine

What about the children, Claudine?
Poor, poor children 
You're prettiest girl I ever seen
Only see you on the movie screen
Hope you don't try to make a sacrifice of me Claudine
Don't get
Don't get too trigger happy with me Claudine
Itchy fingers

Yeah Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again Claudine 

Yeah Claudine's back in jail again
Claudine's back in jail again Claudine
Uh uh Claudine
Poor, poor, poor Claudine
