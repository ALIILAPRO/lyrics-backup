		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In this motherfucker smellin' like a hundred racks
Smellin' good with this Bond No. 9 (Hitmaka)
Hunnid racks, hunnid racks, hunnid racks, oh my God
Mari beats, turn me up, up

It's all these diamonds on her 'cause she mine (She mine)
Yeah, I do this shit for fun (For fun)
Champagne showers 'til she cum ('Til she cum)
I just popped a perc for everyone (Everyone)
Wraith, watch, PCA drop (Turn up)
Time machine the road, suicide the top (Top)
Downtown parking lot, penthouse shot (Turn up)
You just wifed a thot, she up but she not (Yeah yeah)

I just spent a hundred grand on my jewelry (On my jewelry)
I just spent a hundred grand on my jewelry (On my jewelry)
You say, you say that's your mans, are you sure? (Are you sure-y?)
He done told on the whole squad, no sorry (Turn up, come on)

I just blew a big bag today on my diamonds (Turn up, come on)
Everything too real, be honest (uh uh)
We be pushing the Porsche in the trenches (Skrrt)
Came a long way hopping fences
Cash, credit, shawty fix her titties
But these niggas don't get it, ooh
I just bet a hunnid K on Floyd, oh (Cash)
I ain't going if I ain't on that floor, oh
Hunnid K bust out the plastic (Turn up)
Hunnid K flood out the Patek
West coast we hot in (JoJo)
Fuck around, hide in the attic (Go, go)
Uh uh, tell that DJ play this shit right back, uh-huh (Turn up)
Young fly nigga, pick up where he slack (Where he slack, ayy)
Too hot up in this club, get off my back (Get off my back, ayy)
Don't wanna hit your cup if it's not Ac', Ac'

I just spent a hundred grand on my jewelry (jewelry)
I just spent a hundred grand on my jewelry (jewelry)
You say, you say that's your mans, are you sure? (Sure-y)
He done told on the whole squad, no sorry

Yeah, yeah, look at my wrist, that's a Patek, yeah
Look at my neck, that's another Patek, yeah
Givenchy sweats with a Moncler vest, yeah
Fuck my ex, fuck all my exes, yeah
She cut me off, so I fuck her best friend, yeah
She hit me up and I seen a message, yeah
Smith & Wesson, fuck a Tekken, yeah
Hit his head then that's a dead man, yeah
Hit his head now he a dead man, ooh
Hit his head now learn a lesson, ooh
I'm so blessed now, I'm a blessing, ooh
You a dub now, I'm finessing you

I just spent a hundred grand on my jewelry (jewelry)
I just spent a hundred grand on my jewelry (jewelry)
You say, you say that's your mans, are you sure? (Sure-y)
He done told on the whole squad, no sorry
All these diamonds on her 'cause she mine (She mine)
Yeah, I do this shit for fun (For fun)
Champagne showers 'til she cum ('Til she cum)
I just popped a perc for everyone (Everyone)
