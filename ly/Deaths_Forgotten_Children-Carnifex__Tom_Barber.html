		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The face of death

Frozen in this stasis
Adrift in the gravity
Oh, how the eyes (fool the mind)
Inches from, this peace
Suffocation so suddenly
Feels to embrace me with love like an old feeling

Like the warmth of a mother
(Oh) physical, forget me not
Just like the hands of another
Oh ethereal, just let me rot
The black hole sun fills my eyes
It's secret never told, remaining frozen in time
The breathe of death
Is of salt and the sea
She was met once before
But now I see

The face of death
The face of death
Stare into the face of death

Reaching for the sky
Dying with two open eyes
Drag me back into the light

Frozen water makes my heart grow colder
Eyes open or shut, it's all the same color
Like the sun set and never rose again
Like everything good was just pretend

Sometimes dreaming feels like drowning

Frozen in (this stasis)
Adrift in (the gravity)
Oh, how the eyes (fool the mind)
Inches from, this peace
Suffocation so suddenly
Feels to embrace me with love like an old feeling

When death is so close
I know the feeling
Face forever
End it together
In the end
No ones remembered
No ones remembered

I'll take back the life it tried to take form me
The most you can hope for is the world not ending
Let go of dread, embrace undeath
Free yourself from the disease of being

Let go of dread, embrace undeath
