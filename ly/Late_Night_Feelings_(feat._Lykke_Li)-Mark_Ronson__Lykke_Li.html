		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I weigh the water, I feel it all
I ask myself a million questions in the dark
I lay in silence, but silence talks
It tells me heaven is no closer than it was

My heart keeps pulling in the wrong direction
I'm about to cross the line
Looking for the wrong affection
Night after night
Trying to find a new distraction
Wanna make it last all night
Everything that I've been mixin'
All mixed up inside

When I get too on ya
And I wanna call ya
With late night feelings
When I get too on ya
And I wanna call ya
With late night feelings

On and on and on
Feeling on and on
On and on, on and on
With late night feelings

Make me psychotic, you've pulled away
You take the sane in me and tear it like a page
Write you erotic, and I know your way
Before you answer just to make me go insane

My heart keeps pulling in the wrong direction
I'm about to cross the line
Looking for the wrong affection
Night after night, I'm
Trying to find a new distraction
Wanna make it last all night
Everything that I've been mixin'
All mixed up inside

When I get too on ya
And I wanna call ya
With late night feelings
When I get too on ya
And I wanna call ya
With late night feelings

On and on and on
Feeling on and on
On and on, on and on
With late night feelings
On and on and on
Feeling on and on
On and on, on and on
With late night feelings

On and on, on and on and I feel it all night
On and on, on and on and I feel it all night
On and on, on and on, on and on, on and on, on and on
On and on, on and on and I feel it all night
On and on, on and on and I feel it all night
On and on, on and on, on and on

Oh-oh, keeps pulling in the wrong direction
I'm about to cross that line
Looking for the wrong affection
Night after night
Trying to find a new distraction
I wanna make it last all night
Everything that I've been mixin'
All mixed up inside

When I get too on ya
And I wanna call ya
With late night feelings
When I get too on ya
And I wanna call ya
With late night feelings

On and on and on
Feeling on and on
On and on, on and on
With late night feelings
On and on and on
Feeling on and on
On and on, on and on
With late night feelings

On and on, on and on and I feel it all night
On and on, on and on and I feel it all night
On and on, on and on, on and on, on and on, on and on
On and on, on and on and I feel it all night
On and on, on and on and I feel it all night
On and on, on and on, on and on, on and on, on and on
On and on, on and on and I feel it all night
On and on, on and on and I feel it all night
On and on, on and on, on and on, on and on, on and on
On and on, on and on and I feel it all night
On and on, on and on and I feel it all night
On and on, on and on, on and on, on and on
On and on, on and on, on and on, on and on
