		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just take a nice breath in
Exhale that breath
Just allow yourself now to relax more and more
Because the nicest thing about hypnosis
Is that wonderful feeling of physical and mental relaxation
That can now spread throughout your entire body
Because from this moment in time
There's nothing, nothing but important for you to do except relax
Relax

Just take a nice breath in
Exhale that breath
Just allow yourself now to relax more and more
Because the nicest thing about hypnosis
Is that wonderful feeling of physical and mental relaxation
That can now spread through out entire body
Because from this moment in time
There's nothing, nothing but important for you to do except relax
Relax
