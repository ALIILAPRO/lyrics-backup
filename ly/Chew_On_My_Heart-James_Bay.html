		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take your time
I'll be right here
I know no one could ever love me better
Take all night
You're the truth that
Is breaking me and keeping me together
Together

I wanna be in your touch
Sleep is so tough 
You're burning up my mind
What would it feel like if you tore me apart?
Come on chew on my heart
Come on chew on my heart

I wanna be in your touch
Sleep is so tough 
You're burning up my mind
What would it feel like if you tore me apart?
Come on chew on my heart
Come on chew on my heart

I'm on fire
I'm a hot mess
I'm thinking things that I might start regretting
So hear me out
I need you now
I'm spiraling 
I'm sinking down
Look for me I'm sending up a message
A message 

I wanna be in your touch
Sleep is so tough 
You're burning up my mind
What would it feel like if you tore me apart?
Come on chew on my heart
Come on chew on my heart

I wanna be in your touch
Sleep is so tough 
You're burning up my mind
What would it feel like if you tore me apart?
Come on chew on my heart
Come on chew on my heart

Tear me apart
Tear me apart

I wanna be in your touch
Sleep is so tough 
It's burning up my mind
What would it feel like if you tore me apart?
Come on chew on my heart
Come on chew on my heart

I wanna be in your touch
Sleep is so tough 
You're burning up my mind
What would it feel like if you tore me apart?
Come on chew on my heart
Come on chew on my heart
