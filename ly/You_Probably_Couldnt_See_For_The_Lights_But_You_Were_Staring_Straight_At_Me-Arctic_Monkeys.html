		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One look sends it coursing through the veins
Oh, how the feeling races
Back up to their brains
To form expressions on their stupid faces
They don't want to say hello
Like I want to say hello
Well, the heartbeat's at its peak
When you're coming up to speak

And oh, I'm so tense, never tenser
Could all go a bit Frank Spencer
And I'm talking gibberish
Tip of the tongue but I can't deliver it properly
Oh, it's all gettin' on top of me
And if it weren't this dark
You'd see how red my face has gone, yeah

Everybody's tryna crack the jokes and that
To make you smile
Those that claim that they're not showing off
Are drowning in denial
But they're not half as bad as me
Say anything and I'll agree
'Cause when it comes to acting up
I'm sure I could write the book

And now that you're more than a part in the play
It's slightly easier to think what to say
You had us all standing on our heads
Doin' our best tricks, yeah

Never again
Well, never again, no, will there be another one
Quite as desirable as you
One look sends it coursing through the veins
Oh, how the feeling races
Back up to their brains
To form expressions on their stupid faces
