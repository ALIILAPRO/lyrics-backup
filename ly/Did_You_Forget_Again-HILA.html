		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Summer days are going fast
Warmer days they never last
And I sit here waiting
For you to call my phone baby
Is it weird that I think about you
Maybe my world revolves around you baby
Give me a call you won't regret it
I just wanna spend this day with you
This day out on the blue
Staring up at the sky looking at you
You're my best view
Got my calendar all crossed out
This wasn't how I had it all planned out
Had some frosted flakes
A solo dinner date
Woke up late and replayed the same day
Had a to do list that started with you
Layin in my bed there's nothing left to do
Counted backwards ten times
You should stop by and say hi
I just wanna spend this day with you
This day out on the blue
Staring up at the sky looking at you
You're my best view
Dadadadada da
Dadadadada dadadada
Dadadada dada da
Dadadada da dadadada
You never call me back
Did you forget again
It's hard to say your name
But I'd be glad to see your face
Yeah
I still wanna spend this day with you
This day out on the blue
Staring up at the sky looking at you
Am I your best view
Cause I just wanna
I just wanna
Go somewhere new with you
This one last summer day with you
Summer day with you
