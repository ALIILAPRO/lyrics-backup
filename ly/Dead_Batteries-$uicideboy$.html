		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hit the, hit the, hit the
Hit the tone, cock it back, ho
I gotta holla at
Hollow points in yo' direction, nigga
Ain’t no stoppin' that
Hit the tone, cock it back, ho
I gotta holla at
Hollow points in yo' direction, nigga
Ain’t no stoppin' that
Hit the tone, cock it back, ho
I gotta holla at
Hollow points in yo' direction, nigga
Ain’t no stoppin' that

Bitches know I got the vendetta
Rollin' up the lettuce
$uicidal penned letters
Gone and roll the credit's
Swervin' in a Chevy
Ready to land them hollow points
I'm coming for that fetti, fetti
I hate to disappoint
Just lace me down in grey and black
Lo–loc'ed out
Ridin' in my grandma's Cadillac
Pop–poppin' Roxys
Got a hunnid in my backpack
Fu–full moon, so my eyes lookin' jet black
Just move back, ho

Hit the tone, cock it back, ho
I gotta holla at
Hollow points in yo' direction, nigga
Ain’t no stoppin' that
Hit the tone, cock it back, ho
I gotta holla at
Hollow points in yo' direction, nigga
Ain’t no stoppin' that
Hit the tone, cock it back
(Ayy) , ho, I gotta holla at (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Hollow points in yo' direction, nigga
Ain’t no stoppin' that (Ayy, ayy)

Here I come to paint it grey
Whip look like I drive a pile of ashes
Light the blunt and fucking fade away
Took a minute to get it lit
And then even more to get it finished
Sippin' Gatorade and Tanqueray
I rake the blade and blame the flame
I save the fame for later dames
The gator chained up in the lake
Up early fucking gainin' brain
I train the pain by drainin' cake
I aim to reign my brain is stained
I stay the same, I never change
Don't pop Champagne I'm a-okay
I stay away from flashin' lights
I paved my way straight to the bank

Hit the tone, cock it back, ho
I gotta holla at
Hollow points in yo' direction, nigga
Ain’t no stoppin' that hit the tone
Cock it back, ho, I gotta holla at
Hollow points in yo' direction nigga
Ain’t no stoppin' that

Hit the Hit the cock it Cock it back
Ho-ho, I holla at
