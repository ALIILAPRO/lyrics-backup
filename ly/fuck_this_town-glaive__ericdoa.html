		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh, oh, oh

I turn my home into a ghost town
Maybe that's why every single person going ghost now
I been working too hard, why the fuck would I slow down
People only care about you when it's about to go down

Said, fuck this town and like everyone in it
Say you're mad at me, I'm just minding my business
She wanna dance with the devil but won't pay him a visit
I bet I'll see him soon 'cause the way that I'm living
Said, fuck this town and like everyone in it
Say you're mad at me, I'm just minding my business
She wanna dance with the devil but won't pay him a visit
I bet I'll see him soon 'cause the way that I'm living

You try to find a way to get on by
We don't talk no more, said I crossed the line
Throw your weight on me, yeah
Figure out what to say, calmly
Yeah, you're always someone you're not
Remember three months ago, they didn't care when I talked
And all this shit I can't control, yeah, I wish it would stop
And I'm never coming back, because

Said, fuck this town and like everyone in it
Say you're mad at me, I'm just minding my business
She wanna dance with the devil but won't pay him a visit
I bet I'll see him soon 'cause the way that I'm living
Said, fuck this town and like everyone in it
Say you're mad at me, I'm just minding my business
She wanna dance with the devil but won't pay him a visit
I bet I'll see him soon 'cause the way that I'm living

Fuck this town and like everyone in it
I'm just minding my business
She wanna dance with the devil but won't pay him a visit
You won't pay him a visit
