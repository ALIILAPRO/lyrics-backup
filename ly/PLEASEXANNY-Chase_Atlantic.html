		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
This might be love 
Feel the affection through a chemical rush
Baby, if you hold my hand
We can slow dance away lives, oh

Oh yeah, I didn't need much
Yet I wonder if it's ever enough?
Well it all depends if the next one will get me high
Oh

Oh-oh please, Xanny
I'm so anxious that I need Xannies, yeah
Yeah, I can tell that the anxiety is tearing me apart
Yeah, oh yeah, uh

And oh please, Xanny
I'll do anything, to breathe Xanny, yeah
So go and break up my relationships and break my fuckin' heart
Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh

Oh please, Xanny, don't you leave
Xanny, you will conquer the demons that I fear right now

Uh, pick me up and leave me facedown bleeding, uh
Tell me how the fuck I'm still here beaning
Uh Sunday morning, went to ask again, uh
I relapsed again on Monday evening 
Believe me, if you leave me then I'll be on the ground seizing, uh 
Fighting demons, baby, pick a season
Life with you is just a life without meaning

And oh please, Xanny
I don't want to live in fear Xanny
Oh, I hate that I depend on you when life gets hard 

And oh please, Xanny
I'm so anxious that I need Xannies, yeah
Yeah, I can tell that the anxiety is tearing me apart
Yeah, uh

And oh please, Xanny
I'll do anything, for you Xanny, uh
So go and break up my relationships and break my fuckin' heart
Yeah, uh

I think I took too much
Body after body they just keep piling up
Pilly after pilly, I just can't pop enough
How can I tell my family that I love a drug?
'Cause yeah, I love a drug

I took a chance, yeah
Takin' the whole thing outside
Flew to Atlanta
On the way up I got high
I'm on a bender
You're stuck in my high, yeah
And I'll be staring at the ceiling
Take your pants off

And oh please, Xanny
I don't want to live in fear, Xanny
Oh, I hate that I depend on you when life gets hard

Then you got me singing please
I'm such a fiend, Xanny
But my life can only get better when I break you in half
