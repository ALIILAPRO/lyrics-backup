		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He says that 
He tries to solve all his problems
And he's bringing me down
I just wait around

Forgiveness is an empty thought
I find myself moving on
Moving on 

He looks through my eyes once more
And gives me away like somebody's bride

I'm never gonna think of him 
That way again
I'm never gonna think of him 
That way again

He looks through and disappears
And I wonder if I'm still ashamed
I thought of that through the gloom
But it's just still the same

I'm never gonna think of him 
That way again
I'm never gonna think of him 
That way again
That way again
