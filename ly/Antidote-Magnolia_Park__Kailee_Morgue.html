		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  'Cause I need an antidote, antidote
I think I'm about to choke, 'bout to choke
I need an antidote

I haven't figured it out, a failure to myself
I'm so ashamed I ended up this way
I'm canceling plans, losing all of my friends
I need an angel to save me

Is there something I can do
'Cause the way I am means I'm losing you
Found this is twenty-two
Help me lose my mind

'Cause I need an antidote, antidote
I think I'm about to choke, 'bout to choke
I can tell I need to get it all, get it all
Chasing faces so I have control, have control
I need an antidote

'Til I find the doses
I'm broken, I need an antidote

Where the hell are my friends?
The enemy is my head
I guess I'm at it again
I'm off the deep end
A self sacrifice, a martyr 'til I die
Can't stop me if you try

Is there something I can do
'Cause the way I am means I'm losing you
Found this is 22
Help me lose my mind

'Cause I need an antidote, antidote
I think I'm about to choke, 'bout to choke
I can tell I need to get it all, get it all
Chasing faces so I have control, have control
I need an antidote

'Til I find the doses
I'm broken, I need an antidote
I'm stuck in psychosis
So hopeless
I need an antidote

(Poison me with antidotes)
Give me life until I choke
(Light up myself, lock the door)
I can't feel a thing no more
(I see why I feel alone)
A ghost trapped in the corridor
(Phantom of the overdose)
Who will come and save me

'Cause I need an antidote, antidote
I think I'm about to choke, 'bout to choke
I can tell I need to get it all, get it all
Chasing faces so I have control, have control
I need an antidote

'Til I find the doses
I'm broken, I need an antidote
I'm stuck in psychosis
So hopeless
I need an antidote

I need an antidote
I need an antidote
I need an antidote
