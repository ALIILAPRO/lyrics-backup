		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm on 1800 block
Zoe boy off top, Pompano 
'Cross town, got a yop and a Glock
Bendin' through any hood
Yellow tags, he gone juug
Curry way, what it is
Take the time, in this bitch
Sunland, remix, where the wick, keep it lit
Sniper Gang cutthroat, we the new Death Row
Manor Park, Melrose, Broward County, let's go
Whole hood behind me, Golden Acres, palm tree
Ugly corner, skee-yee, on the scene screaming "Glee"
Say you 'bout it, let me see, rep your hood, let me see
Z's up, let me see, p's down, let me see
Throw it up, let me see

Let me see, let me see, let me see
Let me see, let me see, let me see

Fast music, 954, all the Bloods, da-da-do
All the Crips rockin' blue, 7-4, Larry Hoover
Hit the club, it's a movie, parking lot, start shootin'
Let me see, can you do it? New Patek, red roof
Let me see you throw it back, Driftwood, where he at?
Posted up little Haiti, Haitian boy, crest Haiti
Haitian boy, tell the honk, new donk on chrome
West side, east side, that part
Power heights, 1-11 deep side, sunrise aight
Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see
Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see
Hit a lick, drop a wall, peel all the way back
For a fifth five, dog, Rest in peace Haitian Patt
'Cross tracks 'bout you
Everybody gettin' money
Me and Stack, chasin' cars on the block, servin' junkies
Caillou said it wasn't happenin', B O G, black flaggin'
Deerfield, keep it real, nigga play, they gettin' killed
SG, yes sir, nigga play, they gettin' murked
SG, hell yeah, Haitian boy, ZMF
Baby Snipe, baby Snipe, baby Snipe, bay Snipe
Baby Snipe, baby Snipe, baby Snipe, baby Snipe

Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see
Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see

You get whacked about me, Dade County, Palm Beach
Parkway, Lauderdale, Haitian boy, can you tell?
In VIP, straight killa, yellow bitch, she from Dillard
Throw that ass in a mirror, hella Z's in Rivera
To my lil' tippy joint, can't forget Canal Point
ZB doing city, Polk County, get with me
LP, Franklin Park, Hallandale, Liberia, Dania beach
Carver Ranches, rest in peace to Y Gia
It's on 10's represent, young niggas in the tent
New era what it do? Don't be scared, rep your crew
Lincoln Park, let me see
Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see
All my niggas in the state, everybody goin' feds
Z shit, Opa-lock, 3rd Ave, Homestead
In the Pork & Beans Projects in Ferrari, me and Fred
Nigga made a post 'bout me, four months he was dead
Little Havana, where he at? Where he at? Where he at?
Allapattah, where he at? Where he at? Where he at?

Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see
Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see
