		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Only, only, only, only, only, only you
Only, only, only, only, only, only

Still here, only God knows why
Still here, only God knows why (only God knows why)
Dreams of a beach with a house behind (beach with a house behind)
Deep thought on the speed of life
Sun's in perfect reach each time (oh)
Then I wake up clean to a different light (light, light, light)
And I see problems, jump and hide (hide, hide, hide)
I can't see trap doors in my mind
Blurry signs that I can't define
Like predictin' movements ahead of time
Projectiles comin' from the side
Projectiles comin' for my life
War zone when I close my eyes

La-la-la, it's fingers in my ears
I was not tryna hear
I'm movin' on faith and faith only
Desires crush me numb
I would chase and then some
From love I would run
Like it's just here to disown me

That's why I keep my distance, even if I miss it
Wire me the wisdom to pick up when it phones me
Take my body for a walk, call somebody just to talk
Take a mic and press record and speak the truth only

Only, only, only, only, only, only you
Only, only, only, only, only, only you

I was chasin' highs (I was chasin' highs)
On diagonal (on diagonal)
Started lookin' down (started lookin' down)
Like "where the middle go?" (Where the middle go?)
I been on this grind like it's gonna break my fall (gonna break my fall)
Careerism pot hole, like "where my love ones goes?" (Where my love ones goes?)
Obediently blindly, I trust you and you know (trust you and you know)
I don't wanna judge, but I need to save my soul (need to save my soul)
I question your priorities, isn't in this boat
Wired to a system, born into a cold
Has a way of keepin' self-esteem on the low (self-esteem on the low)
Betting on myself, like "how wise is this hope?" (How wise is this hope?)
Betting on myself, like "how wide is this hole?" (How wide is this hole?)
You tell me it's the wrong choice
You tell me it's the wrong choice, but I-

La-la-la, it's fingers in my ears
I was not tryna hear
I'm movin' on faith and faith only
Desires crush me numb
I would chase and then some
From love I would run like
It's just here to disown me

Only, only, only, only, only, only you
Only, only, only, only, only, only you
Only, only, only, only, only, only you
Only, only, only, only, only, only
