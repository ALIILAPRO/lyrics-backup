(OG Parker)

Come here
I know you from somewhere, I swear
I told her the moment that I approached her, whoa
I said, "Tell me what's your name and where I know you from?
Ah, what's your number? I'll save it, let's talk about this later," for now
Throw that ass in a circle, whoa, whoa, whoa
Throw that ass in a circle, go
Throw that ass in a circle, whoa, whoa, whoa
Throw that ass, come here
Throw that ass in a circle, whoa, whoa, whoa
Throw that ass in a circle, go
Throw that ass in a circle, whoa, whoa, whoa
Throw that ass, come here

Pullin' on your arm while you archin', your Audemars shine
Come here 'cause I want you
Don't procrastinate, just come through (don't procrastinate, just come through)
I take Adderall's to feel comfortable
I swear I come from the jungle, we should've did Jumanji too
I promise, everything I say, I'm honest (look)
Kamikaze, can I come inside in your waterpark?
I just wanna come and give you peace, never give you up
We don't need no key and a V for this car to start
I don't want you feelin' all embarrassed when your pussy fart
You don't wanna fuck with the lights on, fuck you in the dark
All my other bitches call me Artist, so you call me Art
Somethin' like a rugrat, you're my baby
In this foreign car, tunes blastin', goin' one-eighty

Come here
I know you from somewhere, I swear
I told her the moment that I approached her, whoa
I said, "I need a bitch that doesn't look approachable"
So I can nickname her "Favorite"
Look, baby, come here
And throw that ass in a circle, whoa, whoa, whoa
Throw that ass in a circle, go
Throw that ass in a circle, whoa, whoa, whoa
Throw that ass, come here
Throw that ass in a circle, whoa, whoa, whoa
Throw that ass in a circle, go
Throw that ass in a circle, whoa, whoa, whoa

My bros already know, don't gotta talk, it's self-explanatory, huh?
My loyalty's too strong, you know
For my right hand, I'll be someone like they stole something from someone
I, I don't run all my guys, likewise, they don't run
Bitches fuckin' me out of spite to hurt someone else
'Cause I know how it feels to be on the other side now, whoa, whoa
Kai said I didn't get the same V12 'cause he was in the box for so long
Damn, it's some things I had to make right before I give you another song (huh?)
I had to roll the dice and let the chances be
They already tried a couple times, tried to embarrass me
Even had my little me try to belittle me
It's gon' take more than a Glock to get rid of me
Nowadays, I'm takin' pills to stay awake and fall asleep
You lettin' time tell, I got an Audemars to talk to me
I thought about bein' a killer, I swear, even 'til this day
Occasionally fightin' with myself about my own mistakes (woo)
And that's why I need you (I need you)
Come here (come here)
Let me pull on your hair (uh)

(Kamikaze, can I come inside in your waterpark?)
(You don't wanna fuck with the lights on, fuck you in the dark)
(Don't even care when you nasty and your pussy fart)
