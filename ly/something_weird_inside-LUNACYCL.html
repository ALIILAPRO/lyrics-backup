		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something weird moving inside of me
There's nothing clear, my eyes they lie to me
The lines I crossed, I make the gods angry
The lights outside are really blinding me
I'm like a moth, I burn up in the flame
It's not a guess, I know I've gone insane
All the love I had, not here today
Feel like this life be fucking with my brain

I been lonely
I been turned down
I been out here
Fucked on my own
Nothing makes sense
I feel like I'm drowning
The hope that I had
Now it cannot be found

Something weird moving inside of me
There's nothing clear, my eyes they lie to me
The lines I crossed, I make the gods angry
The lights outside are really blinding me
I'm like a moth, I burn up in the flame
It's not a guess, I know I've gone insane
