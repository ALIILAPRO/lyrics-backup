		  Mufasa (hmm?)
You know we finally here, right?
(Where are we?)
It's Friday then
Then Saturday, Sunday, what?

(Learn, their lives again, learn) it's Friday again
(Their lives- to pull us) then Saturday, Sunday, what?
(Learn, their lives again, learn) it's Friday
(Their lives- to pull us) then Saturday, Sunday

It's Friday again
It's Saturday, Sunday, what?
It's Friday again, -gain, -ain, -ain (what?)

I thought the hands of time would change me
And I'd be over this by now, yeah
It's been too long since we got crazy
I'm lowkey spinnin' out

I'm countin' down 'til Friday come
I'm gonna, I'm gonna do too much
Know I'm all in my bag, that's clutch
Feelin' it, feelin' it, feelin' it
Every Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Endless weekend, on a wave, yeah

It's Friday again
It's Saturday, Sunday, what?
It's Friday again
It's Saturday, Sunday, what? (We want that weekend)
It's Friday again
It's Saturday, Sunday, what? (Oh, we want that weekend)
It's Friday again
It's Saturday, Sunday, what?

(Learn, their lives again, learn)
(Their lives-, to pull us)
(Learn, their lives again, learn, learn, learn, learn)

This could be bad for me, 'cause I want more
Wanna feel that bass vibrating through the floor
So keep it playing, I'm on a wave
And I'ma ride it all the way
When it comes like

We want that weekend (again, -gain, -gain, again)
(-Gain, again, -gain, -gain)
Weekend , -kend (again, -gain, -gain, again)
(-Gain, oh)
We want that weekend (again, -gain, -gain, again)
(-Gain, again, -gain, -gain)
Weekend , -kend (again, -gain, -gain, again)
(We, we, we, hey)

We want that weekend
It's Friday again
It's Saturday, Sunday, what?
It's Friday again
It's Saturday, Sunday, what? (Oh, we want that weekend)
It's Friday again
It's Saturday, Sunday, what?
It's Friday again, -gain, -ain, -ain

Every Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Endless weekend, on a wave
Every Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Endless weekend, on a wave
Every Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Endless weekend, on a wave
Every Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Endless weekend, on a wave, yeah

We want that weekend
It's Friday again
It's Saturday, Sunday, what?
It's Friday again
It's Saturday, Sunday, what? (Oh, we want that weekend)
It's Friday again
It's Saturday, Sunday, what?
It's Friday again, -gain, -ain, -ain

It's Friday then
Then Saturday, Sunday, what?
