		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'd go to the moon just to get close to you
But sitting in your room, I feel so far, far, far away
You know what to do to pull me into you
'Cause every time you move, you take my breath, breath, breath away

I wanna hear you, ooh
Suddenly off my feet
So baby you come through, ooh
And I'll play you on repeat, oh oh

You're singing a sad song but you make it sound happy
You got the perfect words to hurt me so, hurt me so good
You're singing a sad song but you make it sound happy
You're playing my heart, and I'm falling apart, just like I knew I would

Tell me why I save every last dance for you
And everything you say, I memorize-ize-ize, it all
You know how to get me higher
Even when I wanna cry
But you're setting me on fire just to wa-wa-warm you up

I wanna hear you, ooh
Suddenly off my feet
So baby you come through, ooh
And I'll play you on repeat, oh oh

You're singing a sad song but you make it sound happy
You got the perfect words to hurt me so, hurt me so good
You're singing a sad song but you make it sound happy
You're playing my heart, and I'm falling apart, just like I knew I would

Everything about you kind makes me sound happy
How many words for you to hurt me so, hurt me so good
Everything about you kind makes me sound happy
And I'm falling apart, just like I knew I would, just like I knew you would

Hear you deep inside of me
Your back and forth is slowly killing me
Don't just leave me quietly (quietly)
Play your song and keep convincing me

You're singing a sad song but you make it sound happy
You got the perfect words to hurt me so, hurt me so good
You're singing a sad song but you make it sound happy
You're playing my heart, and I'm falling apart, just like I knew I would
