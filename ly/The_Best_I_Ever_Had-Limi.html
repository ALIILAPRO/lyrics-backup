		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Away, running away
Still, I can't fight it
And it's on you
You know just when to show up uninvited
Closing my eyes, waiting on you
To come and bite it
So come and bite, ah
Coming to see me
Without a warning
Standing outside at 3 in the morning
Calling my name
You cannot blame me
For trying to be cautious
Now we're in too deep
Can't fall asleep
I know you know that I want this
You know I want ya
Haa
When you call because you miss me but you won't say it
When you're making things really fucking complicated
Even when I don't know if we're gonna make it
Even when I hate it
You're the best I ever had
You're still, you're still, you're still
The best I ever had
You're still, you're still, you're still
The best I ever had
And I know it's bad, yeah
Even when I'm mad
I'm still holding on to you
Your hands around my heart, you're in control
You're the only one I keep so close
Cause no other love has ever felt right
It never felt right, no
Got you on my mind
Got you on my mind and there's nowhere to go
Trying to find a way I can let you go
Breaking my heart, but I still beg for more
Gripping onto my soul
Cause you're the best I ever had
You're still, you're still, you're still
The best I ever had
You're still, you're still, you're still
The best I ever had
And I know it's bad, yeah
Even when I'm mad
I'm still holding on to you
When you call because you miss me but you won't say it
When you're making things really fucking complicated
Even when I don't know if we're gonna make it
Even when I hate it
