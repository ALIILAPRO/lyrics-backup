		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Not 'til you halo all over me
I'll come over
Not 'til it shimmers 'round your skull
I'll be yours

I weave for you
The marvelous web
Glow in the dark threads
All neon like

The cocoon surrounds you
Embraces all
So you can sleep
Foetus-style

And they will assist us
'Cause we're asking for help
And the luminous beam
It feeds you

The soft distortion
Fills you up
Nourish nourish
Your turtleheart

And they will assist us
'Cause we're asking for help
And the luminous beam
It feeds you

Don't get angry with yourself
Don't, don't get angry with yourself
I'll heal you

With a razorblade
I'll cut a slit open
And the luminous beam
Feeds you honey, heals you

Don't get angry with yourself
Don't get angry with yourself
Don't get angry with yourself
Don't get angry with yourself
I'll heal you
I'll heal you
Luminous
I'll heal you
