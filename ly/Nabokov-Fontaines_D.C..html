		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I did you a favor
I bled myself dry
Well, this is what it is now
Pain, pain

He's selling insurance
Selling clouds to the sky
You sold me on living
Living is nothing

But you're so good lookin'
I bled myself dry

(Daze ya)
(Phase ya)
(Happy days, yeah)

(Daze ya)
(Phase ya)
(Happy days, yeah)

I did you a favor (phase ya)
I bled myself dry (happy days, yeah)
Well, this is what it is now (daze ya)
Pain, pure sky (phase ya, happy days, yeah)
I'll be your dog of submission (daze ya)
My mission (phase ya)
To help you forget (happy days, yeah)
I'll be your dog in the corner (daze ya, phase ya)
I will light your cigarette (happy days, yeah)

But you're so good lookin' (daze ya, phase ya)
(Happy days, yeah)
But you're so good lookin' (daze ya, phase ya)
(Happy days, yeah)

Ah, I did you a favor (daze ya, phase ya)
(Happy days, yeah)
I did you a favor (daze ya, phase ya)
(Happy days, yeah)
Ah, I did you a favor (daze ya, phase ya)
I bled myself out (happy days, yeah)

Well, this is what it is now (daze ya)
Pain, pure sky (phase ya)
(Happy days, yeah)
I'll be your dog in the corner (daze ya, phase ya)
(Happy days, yeah)
I will be your dog (daze ya)
In the corner (phase ya)
(Happy days, yeah)

(Daze ya)
(Phase ya)
(Happy days, yeah)
(Daze ya)
(Phase ya)
(Happy days, yeah)
(Daze ya)
(Phase ya)
(Happy days, yeah)
(Daze ya)
(Phase ya)
(Happy days, yeah)
(Daze ya)
(Phase ya)
(Happy days, yeah)
(Daze ya)
(Phase ya)
(Happy days, yeah)
(Daze ya)
(Phase ya)
