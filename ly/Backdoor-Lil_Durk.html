		  (Malik on the beat)
(Ayo Bleu)
No, no, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no
(Turn Me Up Josh)
Whoa, oh, oh

Them niggas act like they don't need us
They do everything we do and they wanna be us
Foenem takin' ecstasy, they tryna T up
He rather go and blow a bag instead of re-up
You weren't on that block when that shit was goin' on
I wasn't worryin' 'bout the other side when that shit was goin' on
And we don't hang with different niggas, don't ask us what we on
The only time we'll beat the case, you pull out camera phones
I used to draw out my name on the Styrofoam
I had to teach the grown niggas, right from wrong
Why the state had told the jury, "They tryna indict us all"
The lawyers got them affidavits, they better sign 'em all, hm
I had a bad bitch off the 'Gram, she let her tittes hang
She told Bans I bought her a Birkin, I told her anything
I always ride around with guns in that Bentley thang
We puttin' stickers on our drums, that's a city thang
I hate the niggas who be tryna switch the block up
I be with the killers who would change a nigga roster
I'm from the part of the city, watch your partner
You ain't did shit to same nigga who shot ya
'Fore you leave that door, gotta pick your Glock up
Can't nut in no more whores, I got that from my mama
Shuttin' down the stores, you do that with these commas
You had me at my lowest, I'm ridin' 'round with choppers

(Oh)
Close that backdoor, I can't get snaked out by my homie (no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah)
Close that backdoor 'cause I know that it's phony (no, no, no, no, no, whoa)
Close that backdoor, can't get snaked by my homie (oh)
Close that backdoor 'cause I know this lil' phony

That's a bet
I'm the voice, that mean Dee-Dee, he the threat
Don't get stretched, 'cause foenem tweakin' off the X
I know what happened to your homie, don't be next
He gotta get back for his block, I tilt my hat
I feel like I'm drownin', got this water 'round my neck
Cocky nigga throwin' ashes on Pateks
Went to the trenches, threw up the Treys on the mat (yeah)
They be callin' me, you hangin' where it's dangerous
I'm just slidin' 'til I rest, just for Uncle Raymond
All my sibling's kids know your uncle famous
I know this shit sound dumb and the strangest
In the trenches, I feel the safest
On the radio, shoutout Nephets
Did it off the love, but I gave 'em faces

(Oh)
Close that backdoor, I can't get snaked out by my homie (no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah)
Close that backdoor 'cause I know that it's phony (no, no, no, no, no, whoa)
Close that backdoor, can't get snaked by my homie (oh)
Close that backdoor 'cause I know this lil' phony
(Oh)
Close that backdoor, I can't get snaked out by my homie (no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah)
Close that backdoor 'cause I know that it's phony (no, no, no, no, no)
