		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Looking in the mirror again and again
Wishing the reflection would tell me something
I, I can't get a hold of myself
I can't get outta this situation
Walking in a straight line thinking about last time
This time I said I would do this right
Said I would never break this promise
And now I'm back to counting on us

We cannot be friends
Cannot pretend
That it makes sense
We cannot be friends
Cannot pretend
That it makes sense

'Cause now I'm in it
But I've been trying to find my way back for a minute
Damn, I'm in it
And I've been trying to find my way back for a minute

Locking all the doors to my house
I'm alone in my head
But I wish you were in my bed
Can't get a read on myself
Gotta change this situation
Something in the way that I felt when I woke up
Told me that I shouldn't give in, give up hope
Told me that I shouldn't fight what I felt
Told me I should not let go 'cause

We cannot be friends
Cannot pretend
That it makes sense

'Cause now I'm in it
But I've been trying to find my way back for a minute
Damn, I'm in it
And I've been trying to find my way back for a minute
'Cause now I'm in it
And I've been trying to find my way back for a minute
And the rain keeps coming down along the ceiling
And I can hear it
But I can't feel it, oh

Took me so long to fall
Now I'm in it, now I'm in it

'Cause now I'm in it
And I've been trying to find my way back for a minute
And the rain keeps coming down along the ceiling
And I can hear it
But I can't feel it, oh
