		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somebody help me.
Lord, I'm in misery.
Somebody help me.
Lord, I'm in misery.
I had enough of the blues,
but the blues ain't had enough of me.

Had me a woman.
Oh Lord, I done her wrong.
Had me a woman.
Oh Lord, I done her wrong.
She got sick and tired of the cheatin',
and now she's up and gone.

That's why she left me,
left me in misery.
That's why she left me,
left me in misery.
Yes, she did.
I had enough of the blues,
but the blues ain't had enough of me.

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

Somebody help me.
Lord, I'm in misery.
Somebody help me.
Lord, I'm in misery.
Uh-uh.
Well, I had enough of the blues,
but the blues ain't had enough of me.
Oh, no.

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

Somebody help me.
Lord, I'm in misery.
Somebody's gotta help me.
Lord, I'm in misery.
Yes, I am.
I had enough of the blues,
but the blues ain't had enough of me.

I had enough of the blues,
but the blues ain't had enough of me.
Oh, no.
I had enough of the blues,
but the blues ain't had enough of me.

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
Ah-ah-ah-ah.
Ah-ah-ah-ah.

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
