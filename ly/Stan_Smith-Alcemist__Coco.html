		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My life is like the speaker, it's getting deeper
My head is like the dancefloor, make it dance more
Yo, Coco, Alcemist, wah gwan?

I feel like I'm living in a rave
My life is like the speaker, it's getting deeper
You can feel it in the bass
My head is like the dancefloor, make it dance more

Like I'm living in a rave
My life is like the speaker, it's getting deeper
You can feel it in the bass
My head is like the dancefloor, make it dance more

Yo, we get in cooking in that lab like an alchemist
Back to dropping heavy on your head, are you down for this?
Take me back to paradise, a place where all my problems dem are paralyzed
I came up grindin', pushing out my sound for this
If you're representing for yourself then make it known
Surrounded by these strangers but my vibe is so alone
I bet we get this stuck up in your dome by the time you make it home
Call my phone becah I'm known to set the tone

I feel like I'm living in a rave
My life is like the speaker, it's getting deeper
You can feel it in the bass
My head is like the dancefloor, make it dance more

Like I'm living in a rave
My life is like the speaker, it's getting deeper
You can feel it in the bass
My head is like the dancefloor, make it dance more

Yeah, yo, listen
Gang shit, came up with that slang shit (yeah)
Ride that man, not plank shit (yeah)
Keep up with them antics (keep up), not in romantic
Feel that kick, Stan Smith
If you speak my language then you might understand this (I holds it down)

Gang shit, came up with that slang shit
Ride that man, not plank shit
Keep up with them antics, not in romantic
Feel that kick, Stan Smith
If you speak my language then you might understand this

(My life is like the speaker, it's getting deeper)
(My head is like the dancefloor, make it dance more)
(My life is like the speaker, it's getting deeper)
(My head is like the dancefloor, make it dance more)

I feel like I'm living in a rave
My life is like the speaker, it's getting deeper
You can feel it in the bass
My head is like the dancefloor, make it dance more

Like I'm living in a rave
My life is like the speaker, it's getting deeper
You can feel it in the bass
My head is like the dancefloor, make it dance more

Yeah, yo, listen
Gang shit, came up with that slang shit
Ride that man, not plank shit
Keep up with them antics, not in romantic
Feel that kick, Stan Smith
If you speak my language then you might understand this

Gang shit, came up with that slang shit
Ride that man, not plank shit
Keep up with them antics, not in romantic
Feel that kick, Stan Smith
If you speak my language then you might understand this

I feel like I'm living in a rave
My life is like the speaker, it's getting deeper
You can feel it in the bass
My head is like the dancefloor, make it dance more

Like I'm living in a rave
My life is like the speaker, it's getting deeper
You can feel it in the bass
My head is like the dancefloor, make it dance more
