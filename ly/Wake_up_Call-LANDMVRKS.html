		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I was not a man just a little kid
But I've met you and I've lost all my innocence
You convinced me that I was wrong
Look at yourself
THIS IS A WAKE UP CALL!
THIS IS A WAKE UP CALL!

I can't breathe from the deepest of my lungs
You convinced me that I was wrong
Thanks to you now I am twice as strong
Tell me why, tell me why
You didn't understand who I am, who I am?
I confess I had sins but I tried to fight the best I can

Please take me home, take me home, please take me home

Please take me home since you forgot
You've never trust me, Am I not enough?
I'm not leaving you
Well, I guess there's something wrong

You were hiding the truth
You played with my heart
You trampled my youth
We were caught in an endless circle
I won't be your guide
I won't be the guy you asked for
Everything in here is spinning around
I'm drowning again
But I'm still hearing the sound of your fucking lies

Please take me home since you forgot
You've never trust me, Am I not enough?
I'm not leaving you
Well, I guess there's something wrong

It was cold and it never felt like home
I can't breathe from the deepest of my lungs
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
You're a lost cause
