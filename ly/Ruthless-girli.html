		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me home, take me back
Take me back to playing teddy bears and butterflies in my hair
Home? What's that?
I got a doll's house with a few cracks
Grew too tall, now I'm poking out the attic
My feet are in the basement 'cause I never wanna hack it
Life, what's that? Life, what's that?

Take me, use me, screw me over
Play me like I like losing
Trip me, trick me, drug me
Say you love me but you like cheating
You're the only one to blame
You made me this way
Guess that's why I'm so damn

Ruthless
You made me, you made me
You made me ruthless
You made me, you made me
You made me ruthless
Only way to do it
When you break me and I lose it
Oh, you made me
You made me so damn fucking ruthless
Fucking ruthless
So damn fucking ruthless

Take my soul, take me down
Take me back to the beginning of this when I was still innocent
Me, sorry who?
I'm a kid in a grown-up suit
Looking in the mirror tryna figure out who's
Banging on the glass 'cause they're tryna break through
Is it me? Is it you? Think it's me, wish I knew

Take me, use me, screw me over
Play me like I like losing
Trip me, trick me, drug me
Say you love me but you like cheating
You're the only one to blame
You made me this way
Guess that's why I'm so damn

Ruthless
You made me, you made me
You made me ruthless
You made me, you made me
You made me ruthless
Only way to do it
When you break me and I lose it
Oh, you made me
You made me so damn fucking ruthless
You made me, you made me
You made me ruthless
You made me, you made me
You made me ruthless
Only way to do it
When you break me and I lose it
Oh, you made me
You made me so damn fucking ruthless

Yeah, it's tragic
All the bad bits
Made me so damn ruthless
No, it's not me
I don't wanna be
Ruthless
