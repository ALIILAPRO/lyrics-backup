		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woo, that get back a motherfucker (nigga know what's goin' on)
Yeah, nigga, that get back a motherfucker (frrt, frrt)
That get back a motherfucker (nigga better duck, nigga)
That get back a motherfucker

Can't give these niggas advice on how to kill 'cause they don't listen to nothin'
Niggas be Macho Man and Hulk as hell 'til you hop out with that button
I ain't givin' these niggas advice on shit but how to go to church on Sunday
Fuckin' off so much cheese, give my young nigga ten just to hit you in the stomach
Just told my nigga, "I'll give you another ten, leave his shit lookin' like lasagna"
"Fatt don't never be in his hood," what you mean? I was just there this Sunday
Nigga it's too much shit goin' on, if it's two dollars, nigga, pay me my money
Back to the 'jects, just me, Traphouse, Band, Wizza, Joe, Jugg, BagHari (Loaf Boyz)
Nigga, this shit the largest
Opps can't keep up, I'm in New York at the Bread Gang dinner, eatin' shrimps with Gotti
Long as I feed my fam' off music, nigga, fuck bein' the hottest
If I get booked for a show in my city, on GG, it's switches in the party
I don't think my city can afford me right now, it's 10K for parties
Even though he finna get out, I'ma say it again, nigga, "Free Marley"
We the ones got this started, Westside first niggas in the city Glocks in the party
The smoke got real, Bagg wanted me in LA Saturday, I was in the hood with two carbons

Woo (yeah), that get back a motherfucker (nigga know what's goin' on, nigga, hrrt)
Yeah, nigga, that get back a motherfucker (frrt, frrt, frrt)
That get back a motherfucker (nigga can't run from these, frrt)
That get back a motherfucker (frrt)

It's really been too long, they should've been handled before my deal
Could've put sixty-thousand on a nigga biscuit, but my uncle told me, "Chill"
I said, "Unc', you right, I'ma just book this flight and get back in the field"
Lace my shoes and grab my fire and show these niggas I'm for real
Know my life can change in a second, gotta watch where I chill
Gotta watch what I say, what I post, these niggas snitches for real
In my city, that jail ain't it, you fuck up, nigga, that'll be your new crib
Nigga, this shit Bread Gang, I'm makin' my bond, I don't give a fuck if it's a mill'
In a suspicious car, I'm shootin' a fully automatic through the back windshield
Really ain't got no time to be lettin' the window down, nigga, just cover up your ears
Nigga, this shit so deep, I can't show some of my niggas my mama new crib
Nigga, this shit so deep, my big brother showin' me some of his murder skills

Woo (yeah), nigga, that get back a motherfucker (nigga know what's goin' on, nigga, hrrt)
Yeah, nigga, that get back a motherfucker (frrt, frrt, frrt)
That get back a motherfucker (nigga can't run from these, frrt)
That get back a motherfucker (frrt)
