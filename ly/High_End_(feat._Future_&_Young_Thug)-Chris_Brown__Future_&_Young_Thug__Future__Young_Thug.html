		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  High end, yeah
You know, what we doin'
I'm set, slatt, set, gang, set

I'm on a high end (jet)
I'm 'bout to fly in (set)
Hop in a Cayenne (skrrt)
I was just glidin' (I was just glidin')
I just be stylin' (stylin', style)
I'm on a high end (I'm on a high)
I'm on a fly end (eh, yeah)
We 'bout to fly in (yeah, ooh)
Jump in the Cayenne (jump in the Cayenne)
Jump in the Cayenne (skrrt, skrrt)
Ran out of molly (ran out of molly)
Gotta go find it (gotta go find it)
Snatch up a thotty (snatch up to a thotty)
In a big body (in a big body)
Dripset Wu-Tang (Dripset Wu-Tang)
We like Shaolin (we like Shaolin)
What's the total? (yeah, yeah)
What's the lick read? (what the lick read)
Rockin' Balenci' (rockin' Balenci')
Whippin' up big B's (whip up big B's)
What's the total?
What's the list read?
Plain Jane watch, Richard Mille (yeah)
Richard Mille cost me 'bout an Aston Martin
Left my Tesla sittin' at the house on the charge
I just met the owners of Chanel and Dior Dor
'Cause they say I'm spendin' too much money in the stores
Pluto

Haha
Everything high end (high end)
I whip the Masi' (Masi')
I pop a half a Perc (half a perc)
Make a deposit ('posit)
I am not from the Earth (from the Earth)
Stay on my fly shit (fly shit)
I'm flyin' private (private)
On my Dubai shit ('bai shit)
On a Ducati, stuntin' on 'em
All of you niggas my little homies
Here's some knowledge for you
Stop tryna wife a thot bitch
All the vampires know that we don't go to sleep
We stay up all night, pop me two or three, pill exotic type
Everything high end, you see the stars
And my Richard Mille cost more than your car
Everything high end (high end)
Everything high end (high end)
And you fake, nigga (fake, nigga)
Should retire (retire)
And you fuck niggas (fuck niggas)
Should get fired up (fired up)
Don't fuck with fed niggas (Fed niggas)
They be wired up (wired up)

Pluto
Everything high end

Uh (pew, pew)
I wanna bargain (on God)
'Bout to hit Cali (yeah)
I want an X pill (uh)
I want a molly (uh)
I'ma get seasick (seasick)
From these diamonds (from these diamonds)
Eyes locked in (uh huh)
I would climb in (let's get it)
She 'bout to climax (yeah)
Put the doors in knap sacks (snacks)
Put some ice on a basic bitch (put some ice on a basic bitch)
Put some hundreds in gem clips (look like a thotty)
Freaky in my car (yeah)
Maybach seat massage (skrrt, skrrt)
Backseat turn to vault (yeah)
Security outside like a guard (damn)
Securin' my spot, I'm a dog (secure)
Secure the spot like a guard (secure the spot)
I'm a big B like a wasp (uh)
Can't come to me, I'm a boss (yeah)
400 racks on my car (uh)
Got a old mink on the floor (damn)
King Tut gotta say it's old (auction)
Spend a milli' at a store (to get tags)
Tat my ribs like King Tut's (now go get that)
Caught my first body, I was a man from there (yeah)
Nigga tried to take my money, I left his ass in there
Then hopped inside the Jag, I did the dash, you know that (skrrt)
I ain't gon' stay on no scene, I let my lawyer handle that (yeah)
Get it
Everything high end (uh)
I see it, it's mine then (I got it)
I like it, I bought it (it's mine)
I'm wet up like faucets
Catch up to not get
We don't let bygones be bygones
