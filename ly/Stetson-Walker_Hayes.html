		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rodeo-deo my Lord
Yeah

Bet you like your country western
Two step to a King George record
Rodeos, a little Cheyenne pepper
Filling out that denim and leather
Don't shoot me down like a Winchester
Wanna sleep with you in the desert
Do a little bit of wild wild wrestling
Wake up with you in my Stetson

Get it, get it, get it, girl
Rawhide, I'm ride 'til you buck me off
Get it, get it, get it
Said, open that gate, I'ma get it like Lane Frost
Get it, get it, get it, girl
Yeah, saddle up, baby, let's slide
Rodeo-deo my Lord

The way you dropping, keep hopping
That W in them Wranglers
Make me wanna take you back home
Make a home on the range girl (hey, giddy up)
Tangled up, all tied down
So tight in a loop with your lasso
Got a heart of gold but let's talk about
That ass though

Bet you like your country western
Two-step to a King George record
Rodeos, a little Cheyenne pepper
Filling out that denim and leather
Don't shoot me down like a Winchester
Wanna sleep with you in the desert
Do a little bit of wild wild wrestling
Wake up with you in my Stetson

Get it, get it, get it, girl
Rawhide, I'm ride 'til you buck me off
Get it, get it, get it
Said, open that gate, I'ma get it like Lane Frost
Get it, get it, get it, girl
Yeah, saddle up, baby, let's slide
Rodeo-deo my Lord
Rawhide

I swear your boots weren't made to walk walk
They're made to knock knock with my Luccheses
Bait off for two in that sunset
When that sunset gets real shady
Watch your campfire shadow silhouette
Sing along with them coyotes
Six-string picking on Willie
'Cause something told me, something told me

That you like your country western
Two-step to a George Strait record
Rodeos, a little Cheyenne pepper
Filling out that denim and leather
Don't shoot me down like a Winchester
Wanna sleep with you in the desert
Do a little bit of wild wild wrestling
Wake up with you in my Stetson
