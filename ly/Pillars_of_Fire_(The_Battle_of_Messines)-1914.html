		  Pillars of Fire (The Battle of Messines)

It were the good tunnels - 26 ways of doom
One million pounds of ammonal were packed into the underground pits
Our artillery, was silenced, for the first time in years, all was quiet.
The sky was a very dark blue in the pre-dawn light

And I swear we heard how the nightingale sings
3 a.m. 7th June
We demolished the bottom of Messines

Trigger down, thorn apart by the whirlpool of flame
nineteen explosions - 10 000 were killed, Colonel said

The boches were stunned, dazed and horror-stricken if there were not killed outright.
Many of them lay dead in the great craters opened by the mines secretly planted by the Moles'
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't

And I swear we heard how the nightingale sings
3 a.m, 7th June
We demolished the bottom of Messines

Trigger down, thorn apart by the whirlpool of flame
10 000 were killed, Colonel said
