		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Guilt is a snake we beat with a rake 
To grow in our kitchen in the pies we bake 
Feed it to us to squirm in our bellies 
Twisting our guts make our spines to jelly 

Stay  yeah  don't want to go now 
Drove the children from their chores 
Handcrafted housewives into whores 
Fear of the beast is calling it near 

Creating what we're hating  it's only fear that is here 
Stay  yeah  don't want to go now 
Come into our home, won't you stay? 
I know the steak is cold but it's wrapped in plastic 

Come into our home, won't you stay? 
I know the steak is cold but it's wrapped in plastic 
I'm only as deep as the self that I dig 
I'm only as sick as the stick in the pig 

Thin and so white, thin and so white 
Daddy tells the daughter while mommy's sleeping at night 
To wash away sin you must take off your skin 
The righteous father wears the yellowest grin 

"Don't want to go now" 
Stay, yeah, don't want to go now
