		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see a fraction of my own reflection and my body is covered in dust.
I see the river but there is no water anymore just ashes and dirt.

Every night I feel like we're dying inside.
But everyone is more concerned about what's happening during the morning.
I don't wanna see you smiling, it's just a facade
When everything is crumbling don't tell me that you didn't see the warnings

Now everything is getting worse
All the iron has turned to rust
I don't want it to run my life
Now and forever

Is everyone blinded?
you don't know why, but you can feel it coming.

I don't want to feel a thing
I want to stay out of it.
Talking to myself again I feel like imma break

I don't want to be the same
I've got to go to hell
If I want to forget the pain I'm feeling once again.

Say no fuckin thing
Say no word
I don't give a damn, you're the worst
Say you feel the pain, You don't know
I'm afraid this is going to last forever

I don't care what this life is gonna be
I'm afraid that there is nothing left to say

Say no fuckin thing
Say no word
I don't give a damn you're the worst
Say you feel the pain, I don't know
I'm afraid this is going to last forever

I'm afraid this is forever
I don't care, now and forever

This is the end of all things

Have you ever been alive? I bet you haven't
But you don't realise
I don't want to hear a thing, now and forever

I don't know why I feel so low
I've been so deep
It's the only thing that I know

And I don't know why I feel so low
We've been too deep
It's the only thing that we know

Say no word your time is done.
