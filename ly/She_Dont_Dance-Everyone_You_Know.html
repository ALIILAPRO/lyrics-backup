		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I used to know this girl, she used to dance
She used to live in my mind and play in my heart
I used to know this girl, she used to move
She used to tell me a lie and then show me the proof

But she don't dance no more
She don't dance no more
No she don't dance no more
Said she don't dance no more (ohh ooh ooh ooh)

So I don't either
I don't either
So I don't either

I used to know this girl, she used to rave
She used to pick me up, and then put me back in my place
I used to know this girl, she was electric
But she don't dance no more, I need to accept it
She used to dance 'til the break of dawn
Play the song, man it's wrong, it won't take you long
Raving non stop baby 'til the day has gone
Maybe I'm the one that messed up
She used to dance 'til the morning come
More then one rum, drinking 'til the dawn is done
Pouring some more liquor 'til we're yawning 
But I'm thinking I'm just tryna get love

She don't dance no more
She don't dance no more
She don't dance no more
Said she don't
Said she don't dance no more
She don't dance no more
Said she don't

I used to know this girl, she used to dance
She used to live in my mind and play in my heart
I used to know this girl, she used to move
She used to tell me a lie and then show me the proof
She used to dance 'til the sun was up
One to love, loved her, we were young and drunk and dumb
Done with this ship
It sunk I'm numb and now I'll just try forget her
She used to dance 'til the morning come 
More then one rum, drinking 'til the dawn is done
Pouring some more liquor 'til we're yawning 
But I'm thinking I'm just tryna get love

She don't dance no more
She don't dance no more
She don't dance no more
Said she don't
Said she don't dance no more

So I don't either
I don't either
So I don't either

(She don't dance no more)
(She don't dance no more)
(She don't dance no more)
(Said she don't)
(Said she don't dance no more)
