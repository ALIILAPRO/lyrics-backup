		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Things are better off this way
Wish you never ever knew my name
Wish I never said, "Hi," 'cause you got really cute eyes
I don't wanna cut ties just to kiss your face
So things are better this way
Get out of my brain
I'm out of my lane
I'm not playing this game
I know I'll be fine
I can tell you tell lies
And I hope you don't mind
That I turn away

'Cause you'll just do it again
And you'll fuck all my friends, and you'll just fuck with my head
And I'm so done with the mess you left embedded in lead
I want you out of my life, I'm sick of all of your lies
I'm sick of all the little things you used to do with my mind
'Cause you'll just do it again
You just love to pretend to be innocent
Fuck you, I think you're insignificant
Don't you look at my eyes, go and say your goodbyes
You fucked up bad, now you're wasting my time

You treated me wrong, I'm so glad you're gone
Why can't I move on?
You filled me with hate, you made my heart break
Still, I can't escape
I tried and I tried but I'm left dead inside
And you're killing me slowly without even knowing
Well, love has a cost, and both of us lost
It went on way too long
Like, it never would end 'til the day that we're dead
And both of us are gone
I tried and I tried, we both had lost our minds
I felt so sick to my stomach
But I know that you love it

'Cause you'll just do it again
And you'll fuck all my friends, and you'll just fuck with my head
And I'm so done with the mess you left embedded in lead
I want you out of my life, I'm sick of all of your lies
I'm sick of all the little things you used to do with my mind
'Cause you'll just do it again
You just love to pretend to be innocent
Fuck you, I think you're insignificant
Don't you look at my eyes, go and say your goodbyes
You fucked up bad, now you're wasting my time

You made my heart break, and my stomach ache
And in my mouth, you left a terrible taste
Why do I love you still?
I got physically ill from every shitty thing you made me feel
Ahem, yup, and it's so cold, but what do I know?
I got somebody in my psyche hitting high notes
I got nobody on my side, I'm a psycho
Might go at night, I'm a boy with a knife, whoa
Thank God every night for my nice home
Even if I wish I'd die, I'm alright, bro
Thoughts stay inside my mind with a light code
Life goes on and on

'Cause you'll just do it again
And you'll fuck all my friends, and you'll just fuck with my head
And I'm so done with the mess you left embedded in lead
I want you out of my life, I'm sick of all of your lies
I'm sick of all the little things you used to do with my mind
'Cause you'll just do it again
You just love to pretend to be innocent
Fuck you, I think you're insignificant
Don't you look at my eyes, go and say your goodbyes
You fucked up bad, now you're wasting my time
