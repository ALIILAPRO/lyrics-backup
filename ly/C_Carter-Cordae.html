		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Huh, yeah, huh
Ladies and gentlemen, uh-huh
Boys and girls, huh
Need y'all to just, uh-huh, rock with me
Uh, yeah, uh

I used to dream about a Dodge Charger
Suicide doors, sittin' on 24's
I was tryna find a job, but shit, why bother?
Being broke can make you try harder
Sittin' in the house watchin' Coach Carter
Plottin' on this fuckin' Cartier, hey
Plus a nigga tryna go farther
I finally arrived and nobody's here, hey

I used to dream about a new Hummer
Back when G.O.O.D. Music dropped Cruel Summer
Back when niggas wondered if I'd do numbers
Check the stats, boy, a nigga doing huge numbers
Got this dime piece suckin' on my cucumber
I ain't doin' too bad for a newcomer
This life shit gave me scars with a bruise under, hmm
Certain shit will make you wonder (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
But that's a part of the game we call life, love is hard to attain
My lil' brother drive a Jeep and I just bought him a chain
A real nigga what I'm is and what I always remain
But this bitch temptation keep callin' my name
I wrote this song in LA, I was driving my Benz
Thinking 'bout this road I'm on to acquiring ends
I'm a fuckin' outlier, I retire these trends
Niggas told me I was stupid just for hiring friends

But, uh, I used to dream about a Dodge Charger
Suicide doors, sittin' on 24's
I was tryna find a job, but shit, why bother?
Being broke can make you try harder
Sittin' in the house watchin' Coach Carter
Plottin' on this fuckin' Cartier, hey
Plus a nigga tryna go farther
I finally arrived and nobody's here, hey

Okay
Listen to these proverbs, the odd words we call rap music
That took me all across the globe, watch people react to it
Figments of imagination, couldn't fathom elation
And describe it with words, so I go illustrate it
Illustrious rhymin' career, for which my rhymes are revered
Clear signs of alignment shows my timing is near
We all here for an assignment, several souls that are migrant
Simply vessels in this climate, solitary confinement
I break free every time that I wake
My fate bleeds and create seeds that eventually blossom to trees
Getting rid of all the extra shit I thought I would need
I put your head on the swivel, wear my heart on the sleeve
But just breathe, the simple exercise can even rectify
Our greatest sins, although my days won't end next to God
I atone for all of my wrongs throughout songs
But let him who is without sin go cast the first stone, motherfucker

I used to dream about a Dodge Charger (Dodge Charger)
Suicide doors, sittin' on 24's
I was tryna find a job, but shit, why bother?
Bein' broke can make you try harder
Sittin' in the house watchin' Coach Carter
Plottin' on this fuckin' Cartier, hey
Plus a nigga tryna go farther
I finally arrived and nobody's here, hey (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
