		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can just take what you want from me (Ooh ooh)
Recognize the pain that's a part of me (Ooh ooh)
(And maybe I)
I'll never understand 'til I close my eyes (Ooh ooh)
Give it everything I can 'til I lose my mind
When it's 2:45, and I'm still up for the night
When it's you and I (I just give up and not try)
I don't want to lose
I don't want to lose myself
Tell me how to use
Tell me how to use your help
Ooh
I don't want to lose
I don't want to lose
I don't want to lose myself
Won't live forever, so why live today?
Fold under pressure, so much I can take
I can't deal with the pressure
When it feels like forever
Trying to breathe under water, yeah
(So, why?)
It's what you wanted, but not what you needed
And my fears keep calling, yeah
I don't want to lose
I don't want to lose myself
Tell me how to use
Tell me how to use your help
Ooh
I don't want to lose
I don't want to lose
I don't want to lose myself
