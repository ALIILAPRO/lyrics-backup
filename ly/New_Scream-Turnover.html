		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can I stay at home, I don't want to go
I don't want to wake up till the sun is hanging low
Stay up through the night, sleep away the light
Just another dream I had that's better than my life

Adolescent dreams gave to adult screams
Paranoid that I won't have all the things they say I need
What if I don't want a pattern on my lawn 
All I know is somethings wrong because everyday 

I'm craving that new scream lusting for more than just, old dreams
I've been dying to feel alive
And I've been wasting all my time, chasing the high

Can I reset my brain if not I'll go insane
I swear to God that I don't think I can go another day
Am I the only one, is this in all of us, I hate the thought that I'm alone
But I hope that your not
Craving that new scream, lusting for more than just, old dreams
I've been dying to feel alive
And I've been wasting all my time, chasing the high

Still craving more than just, the same as how it was, I've been collecting dust
And I've been waiting still craving
