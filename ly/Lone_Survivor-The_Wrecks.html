		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're in the desert
All ties are severed
Despite my best efforts
You're like, you're like, you're like
You're like whatever
Just 'cause I shot first
Don't mean it didn't hurt
Alright, alright
If I, If I

If I knew what I know
I'd never let you get close
I would've kept my composure

I'm a reckless lone survivor
I'm electric, I'm on fire
They all said that I would die here
But I won't

She's cold like a cadaver
I'd do anything to have her
She treats me like I don't matter
She don't know

That I'm a la, la, la, la, la, la
A la, la, la, la, la, la
A la, la, la, la, la, la
Lonely, lonely, lone survivor

I'm a la, la, la, la, la, la
A la, la, la, la, la, la
A la, la, la, la, la, la
Lonely, lonely, lone survivor

You're in the desert
You can't stand my words
There's nothing left to say
You'll get what you deserve
Maybe then you'll learn
That life ain't a game
Darling, where is your shame
I guess I'm on my own

I'm a reckless lone survivor
I'm electric, I'm on fire
They all said that I would die here
But I won't

She's cold like a cadaver
I'd do anything to have her
She treats me like I don't matter
She don't know

That I'm a la, la, la, la, la, la
A la, la, la, la, la, la
A la, la, la, la, la, la
Lonely, lonely, lone survivor

I'm a la, la, la, la, la, la
A la, la, la, la, la, la
A la, la, la, la, la, la
Lonely, lonely, lone survivor

If I knew what I know
I'd never let you get close
I would've kept my composure

You'll never see it my way
Until you see your mistakes
I hope you keep your composure

I'm a reckless lone survivor
Fuck your exes, fuck your father
I'm the sum of your desires
Say I'm not

You've been making deals with demons
You've been told what you believe in
You ignore me for a reason
Say you don't

Now I'm a la, la, la, la, la, la
A la, la, la, la, la, la
A la, la, la, la, la, la
Lonely, lonely, lone survivor

I'm a la, la, la, la, la, la
A la, la, la, la, la, la
A la, la, la, la, la, la
Lonely, lonely, lone survivor
