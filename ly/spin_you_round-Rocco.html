		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Verse 1]
We’ll take our time
As we watch the stars collide
I scootch a bit closer
Where my hand then moves over to yours
Oh but everytime
We have to say goodbye
My heart cries a little for you
So how bout you stay until 2?
[Hook]
So I could spin you ‘round
Take my hand until the sun goes down
Hold me close so I can love you now
How bout we all just forget (ohh)
All of our obligations
I’d prefer stupid conversations
As as it’s with you babe
As long as i’m with you babe (ohh)
[Verse 2]
She said pretty boy, pretty boy
You got me acting up
I said pretty girl, pretty girl
I won't ask too much
Cause i’d only ask you
Politely if you’d like to dance
Cause my heart is all yours to break
Oh, So why don’t you come on over
[Hook]
So I could spin you ‘round
Take my hand until the sun goes down
Hold me close so I can love you now
How bout we all just forget (ohh)
All of our obligations

I’d prefer stupid conversations
As as it’s with you babe
As long as i’m with you babe (ohh)
