		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And as the soft pretentious mountains
Glisten in the light of the trees
And all the flowers sing in D minor
And the birds fly happily
We'll be once again my love
I need you back, oh baby baby

I can't explain just why we lost it from the start
Living without you girl, you only break my heart

I can feel it, I can hold it
I can bend it, I can shape it, I can mold it
I can cut it, I can taste it
I can spank it
I can beat it, masturbate it

I've been looking for day glow
Always hearing the same ol'
Sticky boredom with a book
I can make you do things
You wouldn't think you ever could

I can feel it, I can hold it
I can bend it, I can shape it, and I mold it
I can cut it, I can taste it
I can spank it
I can beat it, masturbate it

I've been looking for day glow
Always hearing the same ol'
Sticky boredom with a book
I can make you do things
You wouldn't think you ever would

I've been looking for day glow
Always hearing the same ol'
Sticky boredom with a book
I can make you do things
You wouldn't think you ever could

Why is that so groovy?
