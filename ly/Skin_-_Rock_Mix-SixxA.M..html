		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Paint yourself a picture
Of what you wish you looked like
Maybe then they just might
Feel an ounce of your pain

Come into focus
Step out of the shadows
It's a losing battle
There's no need to be ashamed

'Cause they don't even know you
All they see is scars
They don't see the angel
Living in your heart

Let them find the real you
Buried deep within
Let them know with all you've got
That you are not your skin
Oh oh, oh oh

And when they start to judge you
Show them your true colors
And do on to others
As you'd have done to you

Just rise above this
Kill them with your kindness
Ignorance is blinded
They're the ones that stand to lose

'Cause they don't even know you
All they see is scars
They don't see the angel
Living in your heart

Let them find the real you
Buried deep within
Let them know with all you've got
That you are not your skin
Oh

Well they don't even know you
All they see is scars
And they don't see the angels
Living in your heart

So let them find the real you
Buried deep within
Let them know with all you've got
That you are not
You are not your skin
Oh oh, oh oh
