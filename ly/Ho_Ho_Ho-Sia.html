		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ho ho ho, bring a bottle of rum
Ho ho ho, cream and whiskey bourbon
Ho ho ho, bring a bottle of booze
We got nothing to lose, ho ho ho
Ho ho ho, bring a friend if you please
Ho ho ho, Santa's hoping to meet
Ho ho ho, all the misfits and us
I hope the misfits show up, ho ho ho

Ho ho ho, it don't get better than this
Ho ho ho, in the land of misfits
Ho ho ho, we're all losin' our lids
We got nothing but this, ho ho ho
Ho ho ho, come be our family
Ho ho ho, this is Christmas, baby
Ho ho ho, bring a friend if you please
Bring them all to their knees, ho ho ho

Ho ho ho, bring a bottle of rum
Ho ho ho, cream and whiskey bourbon
Ho ho ho, bring a bottle of booze
We got nothing to lose, ho ho ho
Ho ho ho, bring a friend if you please
Ho ho ho, Santa's hoping to meet
Ho ho ho, all the misfits and us
I hope the misfits show up, ho ho ho

Ho ho ho, it don't get better than this
Ho ho ho, in the land of misfits
Ho ho ho, we're all losin' our lids
We got nothing but this, ho ho ho
Ho ho ho, come be our family
Ho ho ho, this is Christmas, baby
Ho ho ho, bring a friend if you please
Bring them all to their knees, ho ho ho

Ho ho ho, it don't get better than this
Ho ho ho, in the land of misfits
Ho ho ho, we're all losin' our lids
We got nothing but this, ho ho ho
Ho ho ho, come be our family
Ho ho ho, this is Christmas, baby
Ho ho ho, bring a friend if you please
Bring them all to their knees, ho ho ho
