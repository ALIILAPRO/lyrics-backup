		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stood in the sun
Way after dark
Drinking crushed ice
Drunk on your laugh

I'm just trying to keep up
Already know I'm not enough
You want who you heard about
You want all the acting out

The rockstar, pornstar
Man of the hour
Don't let him out
Where is he now?

Are you waiting
For who you think I am?
I feel translucent with you
Baby, you make me see through
But I'm still breathing
What is a boy to do
I feel translucent and blue
Any time I'm with you

I'm just trying to keep up
Already know I'm not enough
You want who you heard about
You want all the acting out

The rockstar, pornstar
Man of the hour
Don't let him out
Where is he now?

The rockstar, pornstar
Man of the hour
Don't let him out
Where is he now?

Am I lost again?
What was it that you meant
When you wished I was dead
I thought that we were friends
Believe you're heaven sent
How could I forget
That you only want 

The rockstar, pornstar
Man of the hour
Don't let him out
Just sing it loud (just sing it loud)

The rockstar, pornstar
Man of the hour
Don't let him out
Just sing it loud (just sing it loud)
