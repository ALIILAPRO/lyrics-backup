Published by northern goody two tunes, ltd./capac - ascap

Late night hustle goin' down in the city
A one way street on the wrong side of town
Young and foolish, man don't you know
All we could see were

Ladies in the night, walkin' a straight line
Ladies in the night, workin' overtime
Ladies in the night, doin' the hustle
Ladies in the night, flexin' their muscles
Ladies in the night, big city, big city girls

We worked out a deal with some chicks on the corner
Back at the room it was never to be
No one had money and the girls got so uptight

Ladies in the night, walkin' a straight line
Ladies in the night, workin' overtime
Ladies in the night, doin' the hustle
Ladies in the night, flexin' their muscles
Ladies in the night, big city, big city girls, so tough

Baby I know, it's just what I see
Baby I know, it's not what I need
Big city, big city girls

The next thing you know, things got rough, babe
They carved out a warnin' with a switch blade knife
The message was clear, if you wanna play, you gotta pay

Ladies in the night, walkin' a straight line
Ladies in the night, workin' overtime
Ladies in the night, doin' the hustle
Ladies in the night, flexin' their muscles
Ladies in the night, big city, big city girls
