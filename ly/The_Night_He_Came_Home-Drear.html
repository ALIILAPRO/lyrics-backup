		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What makes you think your safe around here
I'll kill anything alive
And there's no man that I'll fear
I got that model bitch obsessed
I don't wanna hear your words
come and put that kevlar to the test
H.k smg for everyone that mention me
I don't feel a thing
I never felt no sympathy
That's a story untold
I sink my blade into his skin
That's the night he came home
