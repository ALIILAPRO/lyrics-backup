		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Smile an ever lasting smile
A smile can bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you gone
'cause that would bring a tear to me
This world has lost its glory
Let's start a brand new story
Now my love
You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say

It's only words
And words are all I have
To take your heart away

Talk in ever lasting words
And dedicate them all to me
And I will give you all my life
I'm here if you should call to me
You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say

It's only words
And words are all I have
To take your heart away

It's only words
And words are all I have
To take your heart away

This world has lost its glory
Let's start a brand new story
Now my love
You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say

It's only words
And words are all I have
To take your heart away

It's only words
And words are all I have
To take your heart away

It's only words
And words are all I have
To take your heart away
