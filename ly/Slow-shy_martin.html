		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've spent way too much time moving on
Tried a couple of therapists
Even got rid of some stuff
It's like my mind got a mind of its own
'Cause I've been busy getting over
Getting over someone

It's not like my brain's not rushing every time you get too close
It's not like I can't imagine losing myself in your arms
It's not like my skin isn't longing after the weight of your touch
It's what if I mess this up

So just take it slow
'Cause I'm scared to let go
And my heart is struggling
Not to get hurt again
Just take it slow

So I left me with a broken heart
That I've passed on to someone
And broke a new one apart
Things can be good and I'm still not here enough
And that's why I'm terrified
Having you by my side

It's not like my brain's not rushing every time you get too close
It's not like I can't imagine losing myself in your arms
It's not like it ain't a habit thinking "But what if?" too much
Like what if I mess this up?

So just take it slow
'Cause I'm scared to let go
And my heart is struggling
Not to get hurt again
Just take it slow
