		  Hey, what's the big idea?

Yo Mika

I said
Suckin' too hard on your lollipop
Or love's gonna get you down (girl)
I said
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Or love's gonna get you down

Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Or love's gonna get you down
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Or love's gonna get you down
Say love, say love
Or love's gonna get you down
Say love, say love
Or love's gonna get you down

I went walkin' with my mama one day
When she warned me what people say
Live your life until love is found
'Cause love's gonna get you down
Take a look at the girl next door
She's a player and a down right bore
Jesus loves her, she wants more
Oh bad girls get you down

Singing
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Or love's gonna get you down
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Or love's gonna get you down
Say love, say love
Or love's gonna get you down
Say love, say love
Or love's gonna get you down

Mama told me what I should know
Too much candy gonna rot your soul
If she loves you, let her go
'Cause love only gets you down
Take a look at a boy like me
Never stood on my own two feet
Now I'm blue, as I can be
Oh love couldn't get me down

Singing
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Or love's gonna get you down
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Or love's gonna get you down
Say love, say love
Or love's gonna get you down
Say love, say love
Or love's gonna get you down

I went walking with my mama one day
When she warned me what people say
Live your life until love is found
Or love's gonna get you down

Singing
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Or love's gonna get you down
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Or love's gonna get you down
Say love (say love), say love (say love)
Or love's gonna get you down
Say love (say love), say love (say love)
Or love's gonna get you down

Mama told me what I should know
Too much candy gonna rot your soul
If she loves you, let her go
'Cause love only gets you down

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, lollipop
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, lollipop

Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Or love's gonna get you down
Say
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Or love's gonna get you down (lollipop)
