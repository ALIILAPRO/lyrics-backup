		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I get along without you very well
Of course I do
Except when soft rains fall
And drip from leaves, then I recall
The thrill of being sheltered in you arms
Of course I do
But I get along without you very well

I've forgotten you just like I should
Of course I have
Except to hear your name or someone's laugh
That is the same
But I've forgotten you just like I should

What a guy, what a fool am I
To think my breaking heart could kid the moon
What's in store, should I phone once more?
No, it's best that I stick to my tune

I get along without you very well
Of course I do
Except perhaps in spring, but I should
Never think of spring
For that would surely break my heart in two
