		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We live in every moment but this one 
Why don't we recognize the faces loving us so

What's God if not the spark that started life 
Smile of a stranger 
Sweet music, starry skies 
Wonder, mystery, wherever my road goes 
Early wake-ups in a moving home 
Scent of fresh-mown grass in the morning sun 
Open theme park gates waiting for

Riding the day, every day into sunset 
Finding the way back home

Once upon a night we'll wake to the carnival of life 
The beauty of this ride ahead such an incredible high 
It's hard to light a candle, easy to curse the dark instead 
This moment the dawn of humanity 
Last ride of the day
Last ride of the day

Wake up, dead Boy 
Enter adventureland 
Tricksters, magicians will show you all that's real 
Careless jugglers, snakecharmers by your trail 
Magic of a moment 
Abracadabra

Riding the day, every day into sunset 
Finding the way back home

Once upon a night we'll wake to the carnival of life 
The beauty of this ride ahead such an incredible high 
It's hard to light a candle, easy to curse the dark instead 
This moment the dawn of humanity 
Last ride of the day

Once upon a night we'll wake to the carnival of life 
The beauty of this ride ahead such an incredible high 
It's hard to light a candle, easy to curse the dark instead 
This moment the dawn of humanity 
Last ride of the day

Once upon a night we'll wake to the carnival of life 
The beauty of this ride ahead such an incredible high 
It's hard to light a candle, easy to curse the dark instead 
This moment the dawn of humanity 
Last ride of the day
