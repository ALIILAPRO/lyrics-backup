		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hoo
Hee

All alone she's in the ego zone
The word is out that you're doing wrong
On the move got fire in your shoes
By word of mouth you are on the news
You're living on sunset time (you're livin' on sunset time)
(Hoo)

Feeling bad
You're living much too fast
The truth, the truth that you're on the pass
In the raw they don't know what you saw
From word of mouth you're breaking every law

Sunset driver
Midnight rider
Friday's brighter
Morning rider
You're a Saturday nighter (oh)

On the go, got fever in your soul
You better not shout where you gonna go
Living hot, doing what you should not
The break's on me then what do you got
We're livin' on sunset time (we're livin' on sunset time)
(Want that dime)

Shoot the breeze, you feel that she's the tease
Your night is free, what you wanna be?
Who's to trust when living dangerous?
Tonight is your night, but this is what you lose

Sunset driver
Midnight rider
Friday's brighter
You're getting higher
You're a Saturday nighter (oh)
(Hoo)
(Hee)

You are there when the night's in town
Standing there with the top of the round
They don't care about the things in which you saw
You're like the cinema, you think there's nothing wrong (hoo)

Go in town, you do it every time
The word's got out that you're on the line
On the moon, got fever in your shoes
The night's on you, what are you gonna do?

Sunset driver
Midnight rider
Friday's brighter
Got to reach that driver, you're a Saturday nighter (oh)

(Hoo)
(Hee)
(Hoo) (hee)
(Hoo)
(Hee)
(Hoo)
(Hee)

(That's it, Jerry)
(That's fine)
