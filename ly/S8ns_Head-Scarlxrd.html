		  Weh di bloodclaat do yuh? Siddung, siddung
Plague
Hey, okay

Sick of these twisted games
Sick of these twisted games
Sick of these twisted games
Sick of these twisted games
Sick of these twisted games
Sick of these twisted games
Sick of these twisted games
Sick of these twisted games
Sick of these twisted games
I'm sick of this shit (Blergh!)

Satan's head hangin' in my living room
Satan's head hangin' in my living room
Satan's hеad hangin' in my living room
The bitch with the horns ain't shit

Gimme that crown
Gimmе that crown
Gimme that crown
Gimme that crown
You ain't put in work for crowd
All I ever really hear is the thirst from your mouth
Gimme that crown
Gimme that crown
Gimme that crown
Gimme that crown
I only get this loud from the shit that I've seen
I'm surprised I ain't drown

Satan's head hangin' in my living room
Satan's head hangin' in my living room
Satan's head hangin' in my living room
The bitch with the horns ain't shit

?
Okay, y'al ready, okay, okay
Tu-Tu-Tu-Tu

Sick of these twisted games
Sick of these twisted games
Sick of these twisted games
Sick of these twisted games
Sick of these twisted games
Sick of these twisted games
Sick of these twisted games
Sick of these twisted games
Sick of these twisted games
I'm sick of this shit

Take me to a place that's far from here
I'm the new level that you all fear

I killed him, I killed him, with the sacrifice of my children
I killed him, I killed him, I'mma forge alliance of a villain
I killed him, I killed him, put it through the wire my wisdom
I killed him, I killed him, couldn't take me down when I'm building

Satan's head hangin' in my living room
Satan's head hangin' in my living room
Satan's head hangin' in my living room
The bitch with the horns ain't shit.
