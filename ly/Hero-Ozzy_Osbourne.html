		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want to be a hero
I don't ever want to let you down
No I don't want to let you down

I can try to take you higher
But I don't want to wear your broken crown
You know it brings me down

Don't think you'll ever understand me
I don't even understand me
Don't have the power to anoint you
And I don't want to disappoint the fools no more
The fools no more

I couldn't answer all your questions
And if you're lost I couldn't find the way
I couldn't find your way

You know you'll have to face the music
You change your tune, you don't know what to play
So don't you run away

Everybody's talking crazy
So think I am a devil maybe
I don't want to hear about it
Don't want to have to scream and shout it

Fools no more
The fools no more

So I don't want to be a hero
Don't want to sit upon your crippled thrown
I've got a life of my own

I am not your destination
Or a road that's gonna lead you home
So baby please don't go

Please don't go
Please don't go
Please don't go...
