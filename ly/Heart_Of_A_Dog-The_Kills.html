		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  From sea to mountain valley
From flesh to palms a swaying
Dreamers dreaming on
No matter what they're saying (oh)

I need you
Don't ask me why it is
I want strings attached
Unnatural as it feels

I'm loyal, oh oh, I'm loyal

From starry eyes colliding
From Mars to someone crying
I'm never far away
No matter what I'm hiding

I get lost
But I always come around
It's a strange fear
Allows me to be found
I'm loyal, oh oh, I'm loyal
I'm loyal, oh oh
I got the heart of a dog

Yeah

It's life or death why I chew through the chain
It don't matter my love's the same
Go so far but never long
Can't break the spell in my heart
I'm loyal, oh oh, I'm loyal
I'm loyal, oh oh
I got the heart of a dog

From bars to beds of laying
From boots of lead to changing
I'm hooked from deep inside
Call when you're ready 'cause I'm ready to ride

I'm loyal, oh oh
I'm loyal, oh oh
I got the heart of a dog
