		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hmm, yeah
Yeah, hey
Ooh-ooh, yeah
Oh yeah

I know in my heart
I know in my mind
We weren't meant to be
Are you feeling me, yo?
I'm the girl in your life
I'm the one you call wife
And I need to know
Are you feeling me, yo?
Is there anyone else?
That can do it the best
Give you things you need
Well it must be me
I've got very good dreams
And the fantasies
But I need to know
Are you feeling me, yo?

Boy, are you feeling me? (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I'm feeling you (mmh)
Something in my heart (yeah)
Tells me you're the one (oh)
Are you feeling me? (Me)
'Cause I'm feeling you (you)
Something in my heart (yeah)
Are you feeling me, yo?

I'm crazy for you (what?)
I'm falling for you (whoa)
I've got feelings for you (what?)
Are you loving me, yo? (Whoa)
Tell me if it's our time (what?)
Do I blow your mind? (Whoa)
'Cause I need to know (what?)
Put my life on the line (whoa)
I'ma give you my heart (what?)
All the love that I own (whoa)
But before I do that (what?)
Are you feeling me, yo? (Whoa)
Anything for you (what?)
'Cause I'm big on you (whoa)
But I need to know (what?)
Are you loving me, yo? (Whoa)

Boy, are you feeling me? (Boy, ooh)
'Cause I'm feeling you (you)
Something in my heart (ohh)
Tells me you're the one
Are you feeling me? (Me, yeah)
'Cause I'm feeling you
Something in my heart
Are you feeling me, yo?

Hmm, yeah (Are you feeling us, yo?)
Hey, ooh (Are you feeling us, yo?)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Are you feeling us, yo?)
Ooh, yeah (freaky, freaky, freaky, freaky, switch)
Are you feeling me? Baby, baby, yeah
(Yo, lemme talk to 'em for a minute) oh yeah

Who is the best making these beats?
Who can it be? (Hey, hey)
Are you feeling us, yo?
Are you feeling us, yo?
Are you feeling us, yo?
Oh, oh

Who is the best making these beats?
Who can it be? (Hey, hey) (T, T)
Are you feeling us, yo?
Are you feeling us, yo?
Are you feeling us, yo?
Oh, oh

Who is the best making these beats? (What? Whoa)
Who can it be? (Hey, hey) (what? Whoa)
Are you feeling us, yo? (What?)
Are you feeling us, yo? (Whoa)
Are you feeling us, yo? (What?)
Oh, oh (whoa)

Who is the best making these beats? (What? Whoa)
Who can it be? (Hey, hey) (what? Whoa)
Are you feeling us, yo? (What?)
Are you feeling us, yo? (What?)
Are you feeling us, yo? (What?)
Oh, oh

You never saw it coming (hey)
