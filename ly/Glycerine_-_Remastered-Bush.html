		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It must be your skin, I'm sinking in
Must be for real 'cause now I can feel
And I didn't mind, it's not my kind
It's not my time to wonder why
Everything gone white, everything's grey
Now you're here, now you're away
I don't want this, remember that
I'll never forget where you're at

Don't let the days go by
Glycerine
Glycerine

I'm never alone, I'm alone all the time
Are you at one or do you lie?
We live in a wheel where everyone steals
But when we rise, it's like strawberry fields
If I treated you bad, you'd bruise my face
Couldn't love you more, you've got a beautiful taste

Don't let the days go by
Could've been easier on you
I couldn't change though I wanted to
Should've been easier by three
Our old friend fear and you and me

Glycerine
Glycerine
Don't let the days go by
Glycerine
Don't let the days go by

Glycerine, glycerine
Oh, glycerine, glycerine

Bad moon white again
Bad moon white again
As she falls around me

I needed you more, you wanted us less
Could not kiss, just regress
It might just be clear, simple and plain
Well, that's just fine, that's just one of my names

Don't let the days go by
Could've been easier on you, you, you
Glycerine
Glycerine
Glycerine
Glycerine
