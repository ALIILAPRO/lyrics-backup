		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't need a man, I need a puppy
Allergic to you every time you touch me
Emotional maturity for dummies
I don't have the time to pretend you're funny
I'm back and I'm better
I put the teddy bear you gave me in a blender
I drew a dick on all your sweatshirts

I hate you so much right now

Deal with it, boy, you got to
I don't want you, do what you want
But just deal with it, 'cause I'm so over you
Deal with it, boy, you got to
I don't want you, do what you want
But just deal with it, 'cause I'm so over you

I don't need a man, I need a rabbit
I need a new toy just to cleanse my palette
Big bad bitch, I'm the baddest
We both know it wasn't love, it was just a big bad habit
Stringing you along like a puppet
I can see the desperation, got you right where I want ya
Beg for it, plead, you can suck it

I hate you so much right now

Deal with it, boy, you got to
I don't want you, do what you want
But just deal with it, 'cause I'm so over you
Deal with it, boy, you got to
I don't want you, do what you want
But just deal with it, 'cause I'm so over you (ah)

Ah-ah-ah, ooh-ooh-ooh
I hate you so much right now
Ah-ah-ah, ooh-ooh-ooh
I hate you so much right now

Find me in a ball gown with a champagne glass
With a man on my arm, I don't care what his name is
I've really levelled up now
I got jets on my back
Everything I do, outrageous
You text me that you miss me
I say who the fuck is this, I deleted your number (oops)
Oh gee, that's a bummer

I hate you so much right now

Deal with it, boy, you got to
I don't want you, do what you want
But just deal with it, 'cause I'm so over you
Deal with it, boy, you got to
I don't want you, do what you want
But just deal with it, 'cause I'm so over you (ah)

Ah-ah-ah, ooh-ooh-ooh
I hate you so much right now
Ah-ah-ah, ooh-ooh-ooh
I hate you so much right now
Ah-ah-ah, ooh-ooh-ooh
I hate you so much right now
Ah-ah-ah, ooh-ooh-ooh
I hate you so much right now
