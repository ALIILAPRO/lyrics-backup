		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I met you that day June oh you were everything I dreamed about
Said that you could only stay 'til two and that your momma would be freaking out
Driving though street lights listening to b-sides thinking baby I don't want it end
I never wanted anyone but you but we could never get the timing down

Every time that we get close
Oh I cant stand the thought of letting go

Remember way back when in August
That summer night out at your cottage
Always in the right place at the wrong time
Things change but it's alright
The truth is I still get nostalgic
And I go back to the first night

Met someone about a month ago
He's kinda boring but he treats me nice
Think you and him might wear the same cologne
I kinda like it but it don't feel right
Funny how one night and a quick goodbye
Got me calling you at 3 am like
Come through when I'm home alone
I know we shouldn't but it crossed my mind

Every single place I go
I see your face and wonder if you're close

Remember way back when in August
That summer night out at your cottage
Always in the right place at the wrong time
Things change but it's alright
The truth is I still get nostalgic
And I go back to the first night
And I go back to the first night

In another life I'd say it, you're the only one i want
In and out my life I hate this, when's it gonna be just us?
Sick and tired of these day dreams
I want love to have some meaning oh
Are you thinking about the same thing?
Do you go back?
'Cause I go back to the first night

Remember way back when in August
That summer night out at your cottage
Always in the right place at the wrong time
Things change but it's alright
The truth is I still get nostalgic
And I go back to the first night
And I go back to the first night
