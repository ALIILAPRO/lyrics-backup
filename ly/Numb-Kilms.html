		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been alone for a long time
I've filled with despise and doubts
God I love you
But your words are Gasoline
And I am ready to die
'Cos, I'm half alive
Like a corpse in the grave
I can't feel anything
Dead inside
I can't hear any sound
No, I can't hear it
(Broke my heart and let it numb)
But it don't leave me a scar
Then would you set the fire and
(Watch me burn inside your mind)
It feels like I should die over and over again
(Dead)
'Cos, I'm half alive
Like a corpse in the grave
I can't feel anything
Dead inside, I can't feel
I can't feel
So would you promise me to
(Broke my heart and let it numb)
But it don't leave me a scar
Then would you set the fire and
(Watch me burn inside your mind)
It feels like I should die over and over again
(Broke my heart and let it numb)
Over and over again
(Watch me burn inside your mind)
It feels like I should die over and over again
When this tears falling down
I kneel myself to the ground
Forgot what I've become
I stand here all alone
I'll never be alright
But time will pass it by
And I... and I
I want you to promise me to
(Broke my heart and let it numb)
(Broke my heart and let it numb)
But it don't leave me a scar
Then would you set the fire
(Watch me burn inside your mind)
It feels like I should die over and over again
(Broke my heart and let it numb)
But it don't leave me a scar
Then would you set the fire
(Watch me burn inside your mind)
It feels like I should die over and over again
