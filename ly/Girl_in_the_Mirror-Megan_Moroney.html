		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The girl in the mirror
She's lost her damn mind
She's gotten too used to
Cryin' all the time
He puts her down
She puts him pedestal high
The girl in the mirror
She's lost her damn mind

She looks just like me but I don't recognize her
She's got the same eyes but they're heavy and tired
He just walked out and she's standing right here
She loves the boy more than she loves the girl in the mirror

The girl in the mirror used to know who she was
Now she's up wondering why she's not enough
He put out her fire in the name of young love
The girl in the mirror used to know who she was

She looks just like me but I don't recognize her
She's got the same eyes but they're heavy and tired
He just walked out and she's standing right here
She loves the boy more than she loves the girl in the mirror

She's wearing the dress that I wore out tonight
I'm the girl in the mirror, that's why

She looks just like me but I don't recognize her
She's got the same eyes but they're heavy and tired
Why it didn't work, well, it's perfectly clear
I loved the boy more than I love the girl in the mirror
You can't love the boy more than you love the girl in the mirror
