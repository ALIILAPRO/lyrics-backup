		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This lighter don't work, no
No flame to spark my goal
My Nike's laced in dirt, oh
I've ended up treading on my own soul

My headphone's only working on the left side
But I try to live the right life
My eyes wide and I strive
To stop my demons gripping
Ripping from the inside
This road is dark and I can't
Find the batteries for my flashlight
I'm blind eyed and I'm tired

These drugs don't work
The pain, it takes control
A blood-stained shirt
I feel like I'm always being
Chased by the devil

I tried to talk but I can't seem
To get my spoken words right
And I t-t-t-t-t-t-try to keep
My stutter light
And this life it can be ish right
Cut you like a flick knife
Twist and make you sick right
And I think, maybe I'll be better off alone
So I redirect the calls from my phone
I learned so many lessons from depression
But in essence, i'm just wishing that these
Bad thoughts were gone

(I'm blind eyed) (I'm blind eyed)
(I'm blind eyed)
Sometimes I bleed, sometimes I crawl
Sometimes I slip, sometimes I fall
Sometimes my back is up against
The wall so hard
That whole building could fall
Sometimes I bruise, sometimes I break
Sometimes I'm true, sometimes I'm fake
Sometimes I'm hoping for a moment
When the floor would just start opening
And swallow me for goodness sake
I think I'm gonna break 'cause I ache
And it's bait I'm awake in
A world full of pain
Superman no cape and I'm pressing the breaks
But the breaks, they break
And I'm driving my universe into a lake
And the weight, the weight of the world
Don't wait
We make mistakes when it's all at stake
We cook out cake, we eat our cake
Sometimes no time for double takes but
(That's just the way life goes sometimes)
But I don't want to end up in the gutter
Being battered by my troubles
Face down in puddle where
The sun don't shine
So I'm coming and giving it back
Upon the track and attacking 'em
Stacking up beats like I did with
This one I pack it in
And I'm praying, oh lord
Take this pain away
