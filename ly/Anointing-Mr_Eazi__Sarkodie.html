		  I hope I can hear both lines
Zaga Dat (Wat else)
Don't - don't mute anything
It's your boy Eazi (Obidi Pon Obidi)
Ehn Ehn
Ahh Ahh (Nah)

My girl, my girl
She no be number one
'Cause my girl, my girl
She be the perfect one
She's no too fat, she's no too slim, oh
She be the perfect one
She's no too light, no too dark, oh
Any time wey I see her
Any time wey I see her
When I'm holding her hand
Or when we're doing something else

She dey tell me she dey feel, she dey feel, she dey feel, she dey feel, she dey feel, oh
She dey feel the anointing
Any time wey I give her oh
She dey feel the anointing
Feel, she dey feel, she dey feel, she dey feel, she dey feel, oh
She dey feel the anointing

Any time wey I kiss her, oh
She dey feel the anointing

Ah ha
Oh oh
Ah ha
Yeah

My girl, my girl, baby me and you
My girl, my girl, against the world
Nobody, nobody dey here
You be the only one
Make you no fear

Any time wey I see her
Any time wey I see her
When am holding her hand
Or when we're doing something else

She said she dey feel, she dey feel, she dey feel, she dey feel, she dey feel, oh
She dey feel the anointing
Any time wey I give her oh
She dey feel the anointing
Feel, she dey feel, she dey feel, she dey feel, she dey feel, oh
She dey feel the anointing
Any time wey I kiss her, oh
She dey feel the anointing

Mehn ago fi show you shades of love
Black to gray
I go love move but I have to stay
Sweet seduction
Stimulate your mind
Sweetie de naa me to no, you're one of a kind
It's kind of dangerous
It's so dangerous
Need a love guru to explain to us
Nsem bebree but then I don't discuss
This be love e no be lust, 'cause

Any time wey I see her
Any time wey I see her
When am holding her hand
Or when we're doing something else

She said she dey feel, she dey feel, she dey feel, she dey feel, she dey feel, oh
She dey feel the anointing
Any time wey I give her oh
She dey feel the anointing
Feel, she dey feel, she dey feel, she dey feel, she dey feel, oh
She dey feel the anointing
Any time wey I kiss her, oh
She dey feel the anointing

Every night and day me kiss you, oh eh
Every night and day me kiss you, oh eh
Let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, oh eh
Let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, show you the way oh eh
