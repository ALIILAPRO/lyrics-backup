		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How can I go on
When I know I gave it all
Have I given too much?

Something inside your heart is pushing me aside
And it seems so un-you baby
But it's so hard on me

What is it I'm seeing in your eyes?
The story that I'm reading says goodbye

[CHORUS]
Tell me baby where did we go wrong?
How did we lose a love so strong?
What can I say to make things right?
Baby hold on - don't leave tonight
There's no reason why this part of us should die
Don't say goodbye

Searching for answers
But they're oh so hard to find
'Cause I'm still loving you, baby
Oh, are you still loving me?

Baby don't you turn and close the door
Is it you don't love me any more?

[CHORUS]
Don't leave me now
All alone
Don't bring me down
'Cause I'm not that strong 
I need your love to carry on

[CHORUSx2]
There's no reason why this part of us should die
Don't say goodbye
