		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sorcerers of madness
Selling me their time
Child of god sitting in the sun
Giving peace of mind
Fictional seduction
On a black snow sky
Sadness kills the superman
Even fathers cry

Of all the things I value most of all
I look inside myself and see
My world and know that it is good
You know that I should

Superstitious century
Didn't time go slow
Separating sanity
Watching children grow
Synchronated undertaker
Spiral skies
Silver ships on plasmic oceans
In disguise

Of all the things I value most in life
I see my memories and feel their warmth
And know that they are good
You know that I should

Watching eyes of celluloid
Tell you how to live
Metaphoric motor-replay
Give, give, give
Laughter kissing love is showing me the way
Spiral city architect
I build, you pay

Of all the things I value most of all
I look upon my earth and feel the warmth
And know that it is good
You know that I should
You know that I should
You know that I should
You know that I should
You know that I should
