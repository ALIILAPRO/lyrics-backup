		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Signing blank checks
Really wanna make it
Deal with the devil but I think I'm gonna break it
I'm sick of everybody's stupid fucking faces
I want your tongue inside my teeth like you're my braces
Sunglasses inside the club
We play the songs but we keep on fuckin it up
I need to be the one everybody will love
I need to be the one everybody will love
Come on boys
Let's go dancing
I said come on boys
Let's go dancin dancin dancin dancin
Come on boys
Let's go dancing
I said come on boys
Let's go dancin dancin dancin dancin
I got my hands tied
Brain is feeling deep fried
So please be gentle when ur ripping out my insides
Everybody smokin ciggies on the curbside
Just let me know it when you think we made it big time
I know you love me
I would love me too baby
I wouldn't say it
If it wasn't true baby
Showtime but my hands are feelin too shaky
Showtime but my hands are feelin too shaky
