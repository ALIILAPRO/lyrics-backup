		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Intracranial inflammation tormenting my addled gray matter
Brings the pressure that builds till my skulls set to shatter
The vexating, purulent ulcer that plagues the seat of my reason
Pyosisifying my seething brain while the pain keeps increasing

Unaffected by chemotherapy, the infection accelerates
Vomiting, vertigo, assailing me, as my condition deteriorates
Suppurating my sanity, as the pus and my cerebrum coalesce
We must endeavor surgery for pyo-egress...open the abscess!

Fermenting my faculties into a yellowish mass of necrosis
Liquefying my lobes give way to acute cerebro-thrombosis
This consuming malady I lament with a gangrenous consciousness cursed
Pyomorphic longitudinal fissure swells to the brim of a skull fit to burst

Purulent precentral gyrus, consumed by this affliction
Swelling, seething, distended virus, incurable by prescription
Dissect my festered intellect, operate to end my distress
A condition impossible to correct, unless...

Open the abscess!!!

This blistered, bulbous inflammation, a blight upon my brain
My mind made up of suppuration, to end this throbbing pain
Crack the cranium, lance the boil, aspirate the pus
Or let me leave this mortal coil in which I am trussed
