		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have you been broken-hearted once or twice
If it's yes how did you feel at his first lies
If it's no you need this good advice

Never marry a Railroad man
He loves you every now and then
His heart is at his new train. No, no, no
Don't fall in love with a Railroad man
If you do forget him if you can
You're better off without him ah

Have you ever been restless in your bed
And so lonely that your eyes became wet
Let me tell you then one thing
