		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The love I know not above forgotten overnight 
Live in the light 
Air tight

The love I've no question of impossible designs 
Live in the light
Thinking you're right

Ooh they call you Gloria
Live in the light
Air Tight

Ooh they call you Gloria
Live in the light
Thinking you're right

Even if your lips have lost their red
You can always paint the rose instead
You can make it easy
You don't know what you want, if you wanted
Even if your respirators leave
I never stuck around to breathe

I'm not afraid of the light
I never wanted to die
I want to live in a world where there's only one day

I'm not afraid of the light
I never wanted to die
I want to live in a world where there's only one day

You gotta live in a world where there's only one day
So maybe death is a girl and she's only one dance away

The love I sought not enough, erotic enterprise
Live in the light
Air tight

The love a cross section of imaginary lines
Live in the light
Thinking you're right

Ooh they call you Gloria
Live in the light
Air Tight

Ooh they call you Gloria
Live in the light
Thinking you're right

Even if the love was not in vain
Even if the gods forgot their names
You can make it easy
You don't know what to want, if you wanted
Even if the sun's about to show
I never stuck around to know

I'm not afraid of the light
I never wanted to die
I want to live in a world where there's only one day

I'm not afraid of the light
I never wanted to die
I want to live in a world where there's only one day

You gotta live in a world where there's only one day
Death is a girl and she's only one dance away
