		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everyone think they hot until you put the fire to them
Came out my mama and I was covered in lighter fluid
Think I could walk on water since I saw Messiah do it
Thank God I walked on water it must be the lion of Judah

I think you'd wash your hands if you really saw Pilate do it
I know depression feel like Goliath when fighting through it
I might've blew my mind if I didn't tie to what Jireh's doing
I saw the fire column in the sky and I'm flying to it
Everybody think they hot 'til the fire come
You not a gremlin cuz you could order a hired gun
If you offended and grab a sword then you'll die from one
Don't get it twisted
You just a wick to the wicked

Everyone think they hot until you put the fire to them
Came out my mama and I was covered in lighter fluid
Think I could walk on water since I saw Messiah do it
Thank God I walked on water it must be the lion of Judah

I suffered lots of the pain
I was like a moth to the flame
I thought I might feel accomplished if I just cop me a chain
If not then cop me a dame
If not then pop up with fame
Get props and probably out rap you
Walk off and call you a lame
That was my passion
You saw the movie crash
It's a fact I was crashing
Daddy was a dragon, mom a semi-automatic
Met the captain, lit the flame, just like a candle
Like if Lazarus was turned into the ashes on the mantle
Everybody think they hot 'til the fire come
Spirit inside of me gave the fuel for the fire tongues
He took my piety and replaced it with quiet love
I was an enemy, now Messiah a friend of me

Everyone think they hot until you put the fire to them
Came out my mama and I was covered in lighter fluid
Think I could walk on water since I saw Messiah do it
Thank God I walked on water it must be the lion of Judah
