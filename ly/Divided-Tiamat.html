		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The marriage has gone to my head 
The wedding trumpets are dead
Replaced by a static noise 
So loud that I can't hear my own voice
Will those signs lead me out of here 
Well, just take me somewhere 
To the planes where angels sing 
Trough the chime and the clattering 

For what it's worth the truth might hurt you
There is a little you can do
When shadows fall I will desert you
Then that's what you will do

For what it's worth the truth might hurt you
And with a tear of morning dew
My temples born anew 

Lead me inside
Lead me inside 
Lead me inside out of the cold 
Let me inside 
Feel me inside 
When the seed is sown
Our love's dead by dawn 

And as the day begins 
The sun is soothing my skin 
And I am divided 
I am divided 
For love 

I have to say
That all of this time 
I waited for someone like you 
Your are my dream 
Your are my dream
Your are my dream
