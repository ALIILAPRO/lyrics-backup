If you know me like you know me, I can't get tired of thuggin'
I choose you over any bitch, and I can't deny it in public
And I can't deny the way I feel, that's why I can't hide the struggle
Felt like I was locked up in immigration when I got denied in London
When I took a trip to the UK, I was thinkin' 'bout us
How I was gon' flip them euros to US dollars to get you a truck
And you ain't gotta worry about none of these hoes 'cause I ain't scared to say I'm stuck
And I ain't gotta clear up none of these rumors 'cause you got my trust
And I like the way your body is, you ain't gotta get shit tucked
Sneak a nut inside while you ain't lookin', I tell you the condom bust
We keepin' the personal business off the internet, that's why they onto us
I want your heart while being real with you, not none of that designer stuff

Denied in the UK
Got denied in the UK
Got denied in UK
Got denied in the UK

Walk around the crib with your panties on and your toes out
I told her that she doing somethin' right when when she in these hoes' mouth
They tried to get her post some lingerie, can't pay her no amount
I post Atlanta tour, in sixty seconds, that shit was sold out
My cameraman got locked up for some weed, some shit he ain't know about
They told him to knock when you wanna talk, he went to sleep snorin' loud
I asked 'em how long we got left, they say it's gon' be awhile
I'm tryna turn up, I'm tryna go crazy and see the crowd

Got denied in the UK
Got denied in UK
Got denied in the UK
Got denied in UK
