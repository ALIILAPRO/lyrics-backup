		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Someone tell the author 
What I really think of her
Cause I'm afraid that all my unprecedented thoughts 
Won't lead anywhere 
 
I've stood in acquiescence
For too long in our friendship 
I question the expense 
Of saying what I've penned
What if my narrative would bring us to the end?

Well, I don't wanna stay here
I wanna be in your arms by the sea
Studying your freckles curiously 
Focused on your eyes so delicately

I just wanna stay outside till 6am 
Even though I hated it then
I've only gone and stumbled into a dream
But will I ever be the one that you see while falling asleep 
 
Are you caught in self reflection 
Or fighting the intention to follow what is told
Are you afraid of living life in bold?
How else do you plan on emphasising what they wrote 

So, I don't wanna stay here
I wanna be in your arms by the sea
Studying your freckles curiously 
Focused on your eyes so delicately

I just wanna stay outside till 6am 
Even though I hated it then
I've only gone and stumbled into a dream
But will I ever be the one that you see while falling asleep 

When unfamiliar faces 
Tell you where your place is
I promise I'll be patient
With you and all your 
Hyperbolic statements 
I'll always be waiting
Waiting 

I don't wanna stay here
I wanna be in your arms by the sea
Studying your freckles curiously 
Focused on your eyes so delicately

I just wanna stay outside till 6am 
Even though I hated it then
I've only gone and stumbled into a dream
But will I ever be the one that you see while falling asleep
