		  (P-P-P-P-P-P-P-PARTY, PARTY)

Yeah 
Settle down, settle down, settle down
Girl, it's all over your face, there's someone taking my place (ooh)
Guess that's something that I'm dealing with now (oh)
I guess there's nothing that I can do now (oh woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
I see you in the city (city)
Do they know you're with me? (With me)
Uh, are you with me baby? (Baby)
Girl, you're with me baby (girl)
'Cause baby, close just isn't close enough (yeah)
Maybe my passion just ain't enough (yeah)
I can't feel that you love me, ooh, oh
I can't feel that you love me, oh (yeah)
Maybe, baby, I'm not listening (yeah)
Maybe I just don't got what you need (yeah)
I can feel that you love me, no (yeah)
I can feel that you love me, no more

Love me no more
Love-love me no more
Love me no more
Love me-me-me, girl
