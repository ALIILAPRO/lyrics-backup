		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somehow I can't see a thing
I was only trying to mix all the colors, yeah
Finding which one is my type
Is it blue? Is it red?
Or in between the black and white?

Questioning what could it all mean
Painting over my life
It never came to me easy
I can't seem to get it just right

Let's mix your dark with touch of light
And we'll make art with this heart of mine
And the best part is still your tone, oh
You're never monochrome

I'm surrounded by so many hues
They all must be heaven-sent (heaven-sent, heaven-sent)
And they're countless colors some like new
Show me yours in our world with our love, yeah

Oh-ooh, oh-wha, oh-ooh
Which color are you right now?
Oh-ooh, oh-wha
Get deeper and deeper
To the center of your playground (yeah)

You're ultraviolet
You walk in the room and brighten up my day
Baby, you're vibrant
With touch of maroon and lemon drop haze

Oh-uh, girl, I need your shade, your touch dramatic
Oh-uh, like what's your hue? It's iridescent
Oh-uh, no, I don't need no monochromatic
Baby, your brighten my shade
I want it no other way

Let's mix your dark with touch of light
And we'll make art with this heart of mine
And the best part is still your tone, oh
You're never monochrome

I'm surrounded by so many hues
They all must be heaven-sent (heaven-sent, heaven-sent)
And they're countless colors some like new
Show me yours in our world with our love, yeah

When life gets too loud or too watered down
We search for the lost and found
And eventually we'll see finer things
And make a color, we ain't ever seen, baby

I'm surrounded by so many hues
They all must be heaven-sent (heaven-sent, heaven-sent)
And they're countless colors some like new
Show me yours in our world with our love, yeah

Oh-ooh, oh-wha, oh-ooh
Which color are you right now?
Oh-ooh, oh-wha
Get deeper and deeper
To the center of your playground
