		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah

Praise the Lord when I'm countin' up grace, it's amazin' (it's amazin')
Spin the block if I pull up on Satan (on Satan)
'Cause I'm the from the A, can I please get an amen? (Amen, amen, amen)
Thank you Lord, we done came a long way from the basement (from the basement)
At the bottom we was shiverin', shakin' (shakin')
It was too cold, can I please get an amen? (Amen)

'Cause I've been there (been there), I was in there (I was in there)
Like swimwear, never should've went there
Runnin' through the woods, it was very intense there (runnin' through the woods)
Had to thank God that I seen that fence there (gotta thank God)
Never would've made it, I was starvin' like Marvin (never would've made it)
Strapped in the jungle, with the apes, I'm Tarzan (strapped in the jungle)
Everybody knows I how the boys in the hood do (everybody know)
If I ever jugged you, beg my pardon (I'm sorry)
Yeah, Jesus took the wheel when I gave 'em them keys, that's valet parkin' (wheel, wheel)
Adam tried to leave when he finally see Eve
That's Olive Garden
I had to go leave that pirate ship
I was tired of that arguin' (arguin', arguin', arguin')
Then I dropped thirteen on a Space Jam rocket, I'm no like James Harden

Praise the Lord when I'm countin' up grace, it's amazin' (it's amazin')
Spin the block if I pull up on Satan (on Satan)
'Cause I'm the from the A, can I please get an amen? (Amen, amen, amen)
Thank you Lord, we done came a long way from the basement (from the basement)
At the bottom we was shiverin', shakin' (shakin')
It was too cold, can I please get an amen?

Yeah
Countin' up a hunnid
2012 money
Give it to my kids, tell 'em, "Keep the thing runnin'"
I forgot I made it 'til I hollered at my cousin
I remember we was hidin' under the cars, they was bussin'
Hard courts like the corpse of the guy, yes, of course
But I wasn't livin' for 'em, now I'm caught up in the courts
And the system (system)
Mama tried to tell me I should listen (boy)
Baby mama trippin', say my kids need attention
I forgot to mention that my partner got to snitchin'
Now I'm independent, teach you pray to God, He forgive me
Lord, please
Pray for all the folks in the bunk
Cryin' late at night for all the boats they done sunk (amen)

Praise the Lord when I'm countin' up grace, it's amazin' (it's amazin')
Spin the block if I pull up on Satan (on Satan)
And I'm the from the A, can I please get an amen? (Amen, amen, amen)
Thank you Lord, we done came a long way from the basement (from the basement)
At the bottom we was shiverin', shakin' (shakin')
It was too cold, can I please get an amen? (Amen)
