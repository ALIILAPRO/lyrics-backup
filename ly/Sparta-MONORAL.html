		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’m gonna make it up to you
So help me carry through
Moving back and forth
I’m taking back my youth

If you mind I don’t mind
If you mind I don’t mind
I will break these diamonds
Swallow your spine and
Fight them all
If you mind I don’t mind
If you mind I don’t mind
I will break this silence
Follow your words and
Fight them all

Come and face my crimes
I’ll let my mines appear
Disillusion is near
So now I lie to make it disappear
Standing on my feet

I will break these diamonds
Swallow your spine and
Fight them all
I will prove them wrong
And make it disappear

I’m gonna hate them like you would
Deceiving silent rules
Waited for so long
I want my time to fool

'Cause I can make it on my own
And save my shaking throne
Moving back and forth
I’m taking back my youth

If you mind I don’t mind
If you mind I don’t mind
I will break these diamonds
Swallow your spine and
Fight them all
If you mind I don’t mind
If you mind I don’t mind
I will break these diamonds
Swallow your words and
Fight them all

Come and face my crimes
I’ll let my mines appear
Disillusion is near
So now I lie to make it disappear
Standing on my feet

I will break these diamonds
Swallow your spine and
Fight them all
I will prove them wrong
And make it disappear

Come and face my crimes
I’ll let my mines appear
Disillusion is near
So now I lie to make it disappear
Standing on my feet

I will break these diamonds
Swallow your words and
Fight them all
I will prove them wrong
And make it disappear
