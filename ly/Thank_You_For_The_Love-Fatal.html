		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thank you for the love
Thank you for the heart
There'll never be a long and lonely night again
When you need my love
When you need my heart
There'll never be a long and lonely night again
(Yuh, yuh)
Fatal
Baby we should kick it
I know lately you been tripping
Off the way that i been moving
But don't worry i aint dippin'
I could never lose your love
Baby i can't get enough
I been geeking off the way that you been telling me "let's fuck"
Baby got me feeling purple, tryna ride me full circle
With the sex she tryna have
We can never fly commercial
She my little love bug, she so nasty when we fuck
Got the heart of an angel, with the mouth of a thug
She my half, she my soldier, and she love to say "I told ya"
Lately I been thinking 'bout the ways that I could fold ya
Baby tell me bout your pasts
Baby tell me bout your trauma
I know it's not the easiest, so tell me when you wanna
I aint tryna rush ya, baby really there's no pressure
The way you pitching me your love you'd swear i was a catcher
I aint tryna be exact nah i aint tryna measure
But I gotta lot of love for you, I'm tryna give you pleasure
With every single thing you do I swear my heart be racing
Done put me onto better things, but now i need some saving
You'll never be alone again and baby that's a promise
I could give you everything and that's just being modest
I just gotta know am I someone you miss
I just wanna know should I hold onto this?
All of those fights and I still reminisce
Shit
Thank you for the love
Thank you for the heart
There'll never be a long and lonely night again
When you need my love
When you need my heart
There'll never be a long and lonely night again
Thank you for the love
Thank you for the heart
There'll never be a long and lonely night again
When you need my love
When you need my heart
There'll never be a long and lonely night again
