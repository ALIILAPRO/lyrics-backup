		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I gave my life to You
You gave it back it's true
And I lay down everything for You
I put my trust in You
And You follow through
With everything You say to me
Your promises are here to stay, oh
Your promises are here for me, oh
Your promises are here to stay, oh
Your promises are here for me, oh
I gotta believe You came for me
You came to set the captives free
I gotta believe You are my everything
Say goodbye to what I know cause in You I am new
I gave my heart to You
You gave it back brand new
Cause I laid down every piece to You
Even in the valley, You are close beside
And You light my path that You provide
Your promises are here to stay, oh
Your promises are here for me, oh
Your promises are here to stay, oh
Your promises are here for me, oh
I gotta believe You came for me
You came to set the captives free
I gotta believe You are my everything
Say goodbye to what I know cause in You I am new
You won't forsake me no
Your love has changed me and Your grace sustains me to love those who hate me
I have found favor in His eyes and He gives me strength to fight
I gotta believe You came for me
You came to set the captives free
I gotta believe You are my everything
Say goodbye to what I know
I gotta believe You came for me
You came to set the captives free
I gotta believe You are my everything
Say goodbye to what I know cause in You I am new
