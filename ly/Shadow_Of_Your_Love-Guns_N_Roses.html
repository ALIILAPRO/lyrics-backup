		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Took my chances carelessly
Choked on my own cigarette
You can hand me another bottle of whiskey, baby
But you ain't seen the worst yet

Now I'm reckless, gonna have some fun
And the woman who is dead
Who was out all night, no I'm not the only one

And I ain't standing, never standing
In the shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love, oh no

Stole my changes helplessly
I said yeah, but I got no regrets
Money it was on the table
So I booked with all the bets
Living like a lemon ain't so hot
And you aren't my idea
Of one high-rolling shot

So I am not standing, I'm never standing
In the shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love, oh no

Big dark clouds hanging over your head
Hope you've heard, baby, all I've said
You got told, or even just read
No use crying, you're as good as dead

Now I'm reckless, gonna have some fun
And the woman who is dead
Who was out all night, no I'm not the only one

And I ain't standing, never standing
In the shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love

Shadow of your love
Shadow, shadow
Shadow of your love
I know
