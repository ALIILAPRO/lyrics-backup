		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And she says

I just want to see the real you 
Show me what your limits are, what you will do 
Answer that you're looking for won't thrill you 
Wishing on a shooting star as it kills you
Separated by the start of a new plague 
We've been living in the dark need a new day
So we fail at the sights that the news play 
And fall apart to the sound of the new age
And I wish you'd believe it when I say 
Things are hard right now but it's okay 
When it heals then you'll feel much less pain 
Just the scars to remind you to this day
I Keep picking up the pieces 
To see if they still fit 
But I know something's missing 
We both know how this ends

My bed is cold she likes it hot I guess he's everything I'm not, never forgot 
It's okay it's okay 
I guess I knew it from the start I knew you'd break my Fucking heart, I played my part 
It's okay okay
We just want to leave in the worst way
Didn't want to be here in the first place 
I'm just gonna surf to a new wave 
And fall apart when your heart strikes doomsday
So you sleep all day and I can't rest 
Couldn't be what you want just the next best 
And I told you everything, shoulda left it at
My dreams, so you couldn't pull my heart out my chest but
It's beating right there on the floor 
As you say, "just a little more" 
"I'll always love you don't forget"
Is the worst lie that you've told yet
But I hope you remember me
Cause I remember everything 
Please don't talk to me like that 
I know you're never coming back

My bed is cold she likes it hot I guess he's everything I'm not, never forgot 
It's okay it's okay 
I guess I knew it from the start I knew you'd break my Fucking heart, I played my part 
It's okay okay

(It's okay, It's okay)
It's okay that you left me in pieces 
It's okay that you left me in doubt 
It's okay that I don't know the resasons
But now I have to let this out

It's okay that I hate you
It's okay that I hate you
It's okay that I hate you
I don't hate you, I just hate this

It's okay that I miss you
It's okay that I miss you
It's okay that I miss you
I'll never say I miss you again

I'm doing fine I swear to God

My bed is cold she likes it hot I guess he's everything I'm not, never forgot 
It's okay it's okay 
I guess I knew it from the start I knew you'd break my Fucking heart, I played my part 
It's okay okay
