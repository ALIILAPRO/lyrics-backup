		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Death, hard to ignore
One million lost five months into the war

Pain, fell one by one
Three years remained, it had only begun

Unable to restore
A map redrawn
Unlike what came before
The future of warfare has dawned

Do, what must be done
Send off your son, life cut short by a gun

Gas, cover the fields
Gone with the wind, reveal lethal ideals

And as the end draws near
November dawn
With losses so severe
Cease-fire, their forces withdrawn

Great war enter
Front and centre
Grand endeavour
Lost forever

November 11th settling the score
From 15 to 20 million
Almost half of the dead civilian
A new world will dawn from empires fallen
The end of the war to end war
