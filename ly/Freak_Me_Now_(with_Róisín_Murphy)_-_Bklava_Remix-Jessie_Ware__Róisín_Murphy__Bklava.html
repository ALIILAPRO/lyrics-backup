		  Baby, keep heating me up
Oh, no, don't you go cool me down
Baby, keep heating me up
Oh, no, don't you go cool me down
Baby, keep heating me up
Oh, no, don't you go cool me down
Don't you go, cool me down
Uh-uh, freak me now

What makes you wanna fly
Must be something 'bout tonight
That sparkle in my eye, you are a jewel, baby
Ooh, baby, do what you do, baby
Come make a move baby
You know I want you

The way that he makes you wanna pack your case and leave tonight
I don't know what he does or doesn't do, but he can do it right
I don't care if it is tonight, I'll see you in the afterlife
Oh, yeah (Oh, yeah)
Oh, yeah (Oh, yeah)

Baby, keep heating me up
Oh, no, don't you go cool me down (don't cool me down)
Baby, keep heating me up
Oh, no, don't you go cool me down (freak me now)
Baby, keep heating me up
Oh, no, don't you go cool me down
Don't you go cool me down
Uh-uh, freak me now

Strike if you're hot like fire
Put it in this gasoline
Let me know if you want that oochie-coochie or that in between
Tell me if you wanna love
You wanna touch, you wanna ah
(Fan the flame!) Fan the flame!
(Baby, what's your name?) What's my name?

Baby, keep heating me up
Oh, no, don't you go cool me down (don't cool me down)
Baby, keep heating me up
Oh, no, don't you go cool me down (freak me now)
Baby, keep heating me up
Oh, no, don't you go cool me down
Don't you go cool me down
Uh-uh, freak me now!

(Bring that body over here)
(Put your ass on the floor)
(Bring your back up off the wall)
(Then gimme, gimme some more)
(Bring that body over here)
(Put your ass on the floor)
(Bring your back up off the wall)
(Then gimme, gimme some more)

I'll be your F-R-E-A-K undercover
I'll be you L-O-V-E-R like no other
Like no other, like no other
I'll be your F-R-E-A-K undercover (oh, boy)
(Yeah-yeah)

Baby, keep heating me up
Oh, no, don't you go cool me down (don't cool me down)
Baby, keep heating me up
Oh, no, don't you go cool me down (freak me now)
Baby, keep heating me up
Oh, no, don't you go cool me down
Don't you go cool me down
Uh-uh, freak me now

(Bring that body over here)
(Put your ass on the floor)
(Bring your back up off the wall)
(Then gimme, gimme some more)
(Bring that body over here)
(Put your ass on the floor)
(Bring your back up off the wall)
(Then gimme, gimme some more)
