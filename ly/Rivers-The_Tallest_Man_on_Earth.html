		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So there's longing in the shoulders now
There was a wildness in that time
Can't we now say
Oh, sweet were the hours but ours to find
There was no way to live in simple dreams
There was no straightness to our line
Gravel in hand
Darling, we're moving the mountains around

This is the fire of leaving pains
When the love is gone, but the need remains
Into the shivering cold of day
When the house is gone, but the street remain
Oh, I guess it's true
I guess these rivers never knew

And thn so finally the nightime comes
There is no lot to cast a blame, no need to hide
No fear who I'd meet in some grocery lane

This is the fire of leaving pains
When the love is gone, but the need remains
Into the shivering cold of day
When the house is gone, but the street remain
Oh, I guess it's true
I guess these rivers never knew

And I'll sing of seasons till you turn me off
I see their way of letting go
They'll be the same
And whatever changes, these changes I know

This is the fire of leaving pains
When we're not that strong and the need remains
Into the shivering lights of day
When the house is gone, but the fields remain
Oh, I guess it's true
I guess these rivers never knew
