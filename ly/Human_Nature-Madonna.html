		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself

And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
It's human nature (It's human nature)
And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
I'm not your bitch don't hang your shit on me (It's human nature)

You wouldn't let me say the words I longed to say
You didn't want to see life through my eyes
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)
You tried to shove me back inside your narrow room
And silence me with bitterness and lies
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)
Did I say something wrong?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex
(I musta been crazy)
Did I stay too long?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't speak my mind
(What was I thinking)

And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
It's human nature (It's human nature)
And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
I'm not your bitch don't hang your shit on me (It's human nature)

You punished me for telling you my fantasies
I'm breakin' all the rules I didn't make
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)
You took my words and made a trap for silly fools
You held me down and tried to make me break
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)

Did I say something true?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex
(I musta been crazy)
Did I have a point of view?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about you
(What was I thinking)

And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
It's human nature (It's human nature)
And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
I'm not your bitch don't hang your shit on me (It's human nature)

Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself

Did I say something true?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex
(I musta been crazy)
Did I have a point of view?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about you
(What was I thinking)

And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
It's human nature (It's human nature)
And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
I'm not your bitch don't hang your shit on me (It's human nature)

And I'm not sorry (I'm not apologizing)
It's human nature (Would it sound better if I were a man?)
And I'm not sorry (You're the one with the problem)
I'm not your bitch don't hang your shit on me (Why don't you just deal with it)

'Cause I'm not sorry (Would you like me better if I was?)
It's human nature (We all feel the same way)
And I'm not sorry (I have no regrets)
I'm not your bitch don't hang your shit on me (Just look in the mirror)

And I'm not sorry (I don't have to justify anything)
It's human nature (I'm just like you)
And I'm not sorry (Why should I be?)
I'm not your bitch don't hang your shit on me (Deal with it)
