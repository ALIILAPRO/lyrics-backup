		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna be a face, I don't wanna have a name
Like everybody else
I just wanna erase what I hate about myself
Like everybody else
Won't hurt you
Like everybody else
Desert you

I just wanna be close to you
I want us to feel nothin'
Pretend that I'm someone else
Put the blame on me, I wanna be at fault

Tie up my wrists like I'm nothin'
These words scenes will never come out
This is what I deserve, tell me what you think I'm worth
God made me wrong, so I have to lose control
Like everybody else

I don't wanna be a face, I don't wanna have a name
Like everybody else
I just wanna erase what I hate about myself
Like everybody else
Won't hurt you
Like everybody else
Desert you
Like everybody else

I just wanna be used by you
You know I have nothing else to do
Remind when to feel something
Put the blame on me, I wanna be at fault

Tie up my wrists like they're nothing
Tie up my hands like it's nothing
This is what I deserve, tell me what you think I'm worth
God made me wrong, so I have to lose control
Like everybody else

I don't wanna be a face, I don't wanna have a name
Like everybody else
I just wanna erase what I hate about myself
Like everybody else
Won't hurt you
Like everybody else
Desert you
Like everybody else
I don't wanna be a face, I don't wanna have a name
Like everybody else
I just wanna erase what I hate about myself
Like everybody else
Won't hurt you
Like everybody else
Desert you
Like everybody else

Like everybody else
Like everybody else (everybody else)
Like everybody else (everybody else)
Like everybody else (everybody else)
Like everybody else (everybody else)
Like everybody else (everybody else)
Everybody else
Everybody else
