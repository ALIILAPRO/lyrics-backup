		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I might've spent six months lying on my living room floor
I might've been sick, then well, then sick some more
I might be prouder of me
Than I ever have been

I've been learning 'bout letting go
How to do it without my claws scratching the surfaces
I've been learning 'bout wasting time and closing some doors
Hoping to open more down the line

I knew from miles away that I would detonate
I tried some magic tricks to skip my fate
And then gave up the ball as a defender
The trick was simply to surrender

I've been learning 'bout letting go
How to do it without my claws scratching the surfaces
I've been learning 'bout wasting time and closing some doors
Hoping to open more down the line

It's okay, it's okay
Make mistakes, make mistakes
It's okay, it's okay
Make mistakes, make mistakes
It's okay, it's okay
Make mistakes, make mistakes
It's okay, it's okay
Make mistakes, make mistakes
It's okay, it's okay
Make mistakes, make mistakes
It's okay, it's okay
Make mistakes, make mistakes
It's okay, it's okay
Make mistakes, make mistakes
Make mistakes, make mistakes
