		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want to hear about it anymore
It's a shame I've got to live without you anymore
There's a fire in my heart
A pounding in my brain
It's driving me crazy

We don't need to talk about it anymore
Yesterday's just a memory
Can we close the door?
I just made one mistake
I didn't know what to say
When you called me "baby"

Don't say goodnight
Say you're gonna stay forever
Oh-whoa, all the way

Can you take me high enough
To fly me over (fly me over)
Yesterday?
Can you take me high enough?
It's never over
And yesterday is just a memory
Yesterday is just a memory

And I don't want to live without you anymore
Can't you see I'm in misery?
And you know for sure
I would live and die for you
And I'd know just what to do
When you call me "baby"

Don't say goodbye
Say you're gonna stay forever
Oh-whoa, all the way

Can you take me high enough
Can you fly me over (fly me over)
Yesterday?
Can you take me high enough
It's never over
And yesterday is just a memory, I'm running

(Oh-woah)
I was running for the door
(Oh-woah)
The next thing I remember
(Oh-woah)
I was running back for more
(Oh-woah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't say goodbye
Say you're gonna stay forever
Oh-whoa, all the way (all the way)
(All the way, yeah)

Can you take me high enough
Can you fly me over (fly me over)
Yesterday?
Can you take me high enough?
It's never over
Whoa-oh, Whoa-oh, Whoa-oh, Whoa-oh

Can you take me high enough
Won't you fly me over (won't you fly me over)
Yesterday?
Can you take me high enough?
It's never over
Whoa-oh, Whoa-oh, Whoa-oh, Whoa-oh
