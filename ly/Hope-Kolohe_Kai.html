		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We need miraculous vibes
Love to conquer
These craziest times for us
The murder and crime
Children hunger
Surrounded by guns and drugs
cnd I know deep inside
That we'd all like to just go back
To the days when our lives 
Felt a little bit more in tact, yeah 

Why do we hate and kill one another 
Why do we feed the flames
The roadway to joy is to rediscover
We are all the same
I  believe
That one day we'll see love
Wrapped around the globe
With hearts full of hope 
I  believe 
That everything we've lost
Is something we will find forever
What the world needs is hope, hope, yeah
Hope, Hope
Yeah what the world needs is
Hope, Hope, Hope, yeah

I can see the skies are rolling
The sun's fires got the whole world constantly glowing, oh yeah
cs it sets down in Lahaina
The sun rises down in cfrica
cnd the children they play
How is it we're the same but some, they are better
Does the paper in your pocket really make you a greater man
We all bleed the same
When will freedom ring

Why do we hate and kill one another 
Why do we feed the flame
The roadway to joy is to rediscover
We are all the same
I  believe
That one day we'll see love
Wrapped around the globe
With hearts full of hope 
I  believe 
That everything we've lost
Is something we will find forever
What the world needs is hope, hope, yeah
Hope, Hope
Yeah what the world needs is
Hope, Hope, Hope, yeah

Hope
Hope
Hope
Hope
