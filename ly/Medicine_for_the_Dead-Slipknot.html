		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What happens in the dark feels the way the blackout never does
Turning the gears, sharpen the blades of sheer terror, these fevered ones
Tell me the secret things, show me the bloody kings
Let's play a game where the winners always lose their heads

Time screams by, life is mine
Time screams by, life is-

Your condition is a symptom
We'll have to give you medicine for the dead (drink me)
Your condition is a symptom
We'll have to give you medicine for the dead (drink me)

Before it could begin the shooting stopped, the silence always comes
Now where do we go? Because you're walking the streets
It's no better (there's something wrong)
Pull at your privacy, a product of lunacy
Don't be surprised when the losers want to win the day again

Time screams by, life is mine
Time screams by, life is-

Your condition is a symptom we'll have to give you
Medicine for the dead (drink me)
Your condition is a symptom we'll have to give you
Medicine for the dead

Where does it end and tell me where does it go?
If evil exists, then only evil can know
When do we run and are they letting us in?
Where does it end and tell me where to begin?

Your condition is a symptom
We'll have to give you medicine for the dead (drink me)
Your condition is a symptom
We'll have to give you medicine for the dead (medicine for the dead)
Your condition is a symptom
We'll have to give you medicine for the dead (drink me)
Your condition is a symptom
We'll have to give you medicine for the dead (you'll have to drink me)
