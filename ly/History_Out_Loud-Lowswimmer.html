		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This room was amazing man
But the top bunk was taken now
Were you there for the meltdown?
It all went pretty south

I'm all in history out loud
It's coming

On balance I'd not done well
Thought I had the technique down
But I took the letters out and
I made it say out loud

It's spinning me out when I get back in town
You're taking me out
It's really been all turning inside out
