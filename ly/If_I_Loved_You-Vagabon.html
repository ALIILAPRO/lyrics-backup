		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I loved you
Time and again I would try to say
All I'd want you to know

If I loved you
Words wouldn't come in an easy way
Round in circles
I'd go

Longing to tell you
But afraid and shy
I'd let my golden chances pass me by

Soon you'd leave me
Off you would go in the midst of day
Never, never to know 
How I loved you

If I Loved You
