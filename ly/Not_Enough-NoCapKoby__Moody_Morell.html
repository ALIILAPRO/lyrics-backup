		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I Remember when I seen you I just fell in love
All this Shit you did to me I had enough
You touching me , addicting, your just like a Drug.
My heart is stuck, 
But Your not Enough 
I Remember when You treated me just like your home
All these different feelings when I should’ve known
Every time Im with you Why I feel alone?
Im on my own 
And It’s set in stone

Every time I wake up
Every time  I wake up here you always putting Make-up, on your face & all your tears 
Baby clear your face up
I don’t really like it here
I just wanna make up
Baby Pick up 
Let’s not Break-Up
Why This Always happening to You
(oh no)
It’s not about your Face ,It’s what you do (ohh)

All i Ever wanted was to make it up
All i Ever wanted was to make it up

Your not enough 13X

All i Ever wanted was to make it up
All i Ever wanted was to make it up

You don’t Ever Listen or pay attention 
(pay attention)
Baby You Not solid Like You say You is
(say you is)
Tell me who the f*ck you think you playing with? (Playing With)
I know you don’t love me you just say that shit (ohh)
This Shit Just So Toxic, You and I
You Stuck In The Middle, Pick a side
I Did My part But You ain’t Moving Right
I swear this shit gone cost my suicide



Every time I wake up,
Every time I wake up here you always putting Make up, on your face & all your tears 
Baby clear your face up
I don’t really like it here
I just wanna make up
Baby Pick up 
Let’s not Break-Up
Why This Always happening To You
(oh no)
It’s not about your Face ,It’s what you do (ohh)

All i Ever wanted was to make it up
All i Ever wanted was to make it up

Your not Enough 13x

All i Ever wanted was to make it up
All i Ever wanted was to make it up
