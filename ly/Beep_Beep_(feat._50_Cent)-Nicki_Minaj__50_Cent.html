		  (Murda on the beat so it's not nice)
Ayo

I drop a bag on the Rolls with the temp tags
My niggas locked, scammin' money out their pen pals
I know a bitch bust it open in the club
Introduce you to the plug, ten plates feel like ten cash
I got a call, told him, "Meet me in the backstreets"
Got out the Jeep just to fuck him in the backseat
I'm not impressed, I said, "Yo, the D mad weak"
Hit my niggas up, I got him robbed and that ass beat
I told him that he had the chance of a lifetime
Who wanna be a millionaire? I'm your lifeline
These bitches always checkin' for me like a Nike sign
Niggas always frontin' when they only did some light time

Beep, beep, beep, is that bleep? (Bleep)
Is that you talkin' to me? It's that deep? (Deep)
If I don't even know you exist, is that beef? (Beef)
When niggas get their jaw broke, wait, is that teeth? (Is that teeth?)

Murder, murder, murder, murder, mm (murder)
Murder, murder, murder, murder, mm (murder)
Murder, murder, murder, murder, mm (murder)
Murder, murder, murder, murder

When niggas out smackin' shit, it's hard to find me
I'm different shit, I'm with the shit, I'm nineties grimy
I should spend that shit and then they spin that shit
If niggas ain't there, they gon' double back to finish it
Say, we got some kind of beef, what kind of beef? Please remind me
Niggas all pussy, whole clique punani
A lil' bread with me, you can't hide behind money
Got a lot of this shit, I ain't runnin' out of this shit
Nah, nah, you don't want to stop me, I don't stop
Have my niggas come to spin your block around the clock
You don't see 'em out there, nigga, fuck it, make it hot
In front of the buildin', let up thirty shots
We gon' catch him in traffic

Beep, beep, beep, is that bleep? (Bleep)
Is that you talkin' to me? It's that deep? (Deep)
If I don't even know you exist, is that beef? (Beef)
When niggas get their jaw broke, wait, is that teeth? (Is that teeth?)

Murder, murder, murder, murder, mm (murder)
Murder, murder, murder, murder, mm (murder)
Murder, murder, murder, murder, mm (murder)
Murder, murder, murder, murder

Wait, is that teeth?
