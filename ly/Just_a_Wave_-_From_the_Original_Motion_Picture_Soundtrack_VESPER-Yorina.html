		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rain is falling on the floor
But the flower doesn't grow
The field is hard and empty
You say it's better than before
But I am not so sure
The hope juste seems to've left me
Lately I've been thinking
Are we really sinking ?
Or is it just a wave we surf
A wave back to the shore
Lately I've been dreaming
No we're not really sinking
Cause this is just a wave we surf
A wave back to the shore
A cold bliss
Is blowing/bringing down the snow
But the white is not that pure
And it all just melt so quickly
You say it's better than before
But I feel insecure
The hope has truly left me
Lately I've been thinking
Are we really sinking ?
Or is it just a wave we surf
A wave back to the shore
Lately I've been dreaming
No we're not really sinking
Cause this is just a wave we surf
A wave back to the shore
