		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Slow motion
Blinds are see through
Let your mind go
Imagine that I kiss you

Turn off the lights and open up your eyes now
You can take a glimpse into my soul for tonight

Do you got the heat off girl? (Yes I do)
Can you turn up the temperature? (You bet I could)
Colombian with a swagger (yes I am)

Whatever it takes to make this thing work we gonna
Whatever it takes to make this thing work we gonna

There's a spy by my window (yup)
I know it's you (uha)
You like to keep an eye on me (I do)
I know you like to keep an eye on me

There's a spy by my window
I know it's you (it's me)
Won't you like to keep an eye on me
I know you like to keep an eye on me (I do girl)
Keep an eye on me
But if you want it got to let it be

I know you
Dream about me
And it turns me on to think about it
This is the finest game
It ain't even got a name
I just wanna see how far it takes us tonight

Do you got the music on girl? Yes I do
Can you get a little closer? You bet I could
Colombian with a swagger, yes I am

Whatever it takes to make this thing work we gonna
Whatever it takes to make this thing work we gonna
Whatever it takes to make this thing work we gonna

There's a spy by my window
I know it's you (it's me)
You like to keep an eye on me
I know you like to keep an eye on me (I do girl)

There's a spy by my window
I know it's you (it's me)
Won't you like to keep an eye on me
I know you like to keep an eye on me (I do girl)
Keep an eye on me
But if you want it got to let it be

When the dog's away that's when the cat's play
Yup yup you'll be my girl, I'll be the spy
Like the James Bond flick girl I'm ready to ride

When the cat's away that's when the mouse play
Yup yup you'll be my girl, I'll be the spy
Like the James Bond flick girl I'm ready to die, die die

There's a spy by my window
I know it's you
You like to keep an eye on me
I know you like to keep an eye on me 

There's a spy by my window
I know it's you
Won't you like to keep an eye on me
I know you like to keep an eye on me 
Keep an eye on me
But if you want it got to let it be

Lipstick's on
Stockings up
Skirt's short
Heels are high
Take your time
Buckle up

Close your eyes and enjoy the ride
Close your eyes and enjoy the ride
Close your eyes 
Close your eyes and enjoy the ride
