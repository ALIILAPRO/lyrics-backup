		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What can I do for you?
What can I do that no one else can do?
What can I do for you?
What can I do for you?

Human man
You are so much fun
I hadn't planned
On finding you quite this entertaining
I like your band 
And I like your song
I like the way
Human beings play
I like playin' along
Oh, oh, oh, oh-whoa

What can I do for you?
What can I do that no one else can do?
What can I do for you?
What can I do for you?
