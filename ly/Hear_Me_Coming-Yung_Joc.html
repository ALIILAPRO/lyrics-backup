		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Chorus: x2]
All the hoes lose they mind when they see me stunting
Dope Boys lose they mind when they hear me coming
All the haters get to running when they hear that choppa drumming, Blllluuupp, blllluup bumping

[Young Joc]
Y'all ready know, ya ain't even gotta wonder
I was voted number one rapper to drop this summer
A one hit wonder, how the hell ya figure that?
My rhymes like crack, fiends screaming, "Gimmie that!"

I'm being like a monkey, and that '73 dope
Need a desert eagle, reefer smelling like a skunk
Got a b**** named Judy, with a real big booty
Blue star keep a n**** riding cuji

If it's a problem, I suggest you let it go
Got some killas over there, more hellan than the lord
I beat the block up
You can hear me when I'm coming

If it's a problem then the choppers start drumming, drumming

[Chorus: x2]

My n****s flip birds
Your n****s flip burgers
My n****s got work
Your n****s just workers

My n****s, we get heard
Your n****s is unheard of
My n****s murder
Your n****s get murdered

My n****s win n****s
Your n****s get drenched
My n****s play the field
Your n****s ride bench

My n****s is quarterbacks
Your n****s just receive
With a single flinch boy, your n****s retreat
My n****s take the coke and they let the s*** cook

Your n****s experiment with dope and get hooked
Now ain't that something, let the story get told
As the plot thickens and the script unfolds

[Chorus: x2]

I get back around three
We can do it more again
Message to them hater middle finger to the wind
Let my chain swang, with a limp in my walk

Baby hush ya mouth, respect a pimp when he talk
Everybody know that I do it for the hood
Help feed the hungry, now my homies all good
Word on the street, Joc got the heat

Suede on the seat, 28's on the feet
Two bottle of Crys, baby go on spend money
When ya add it up now I'm drinking red money
My wrist gone froze

Make em jump out of they clothes
Go ahead drink tonight, 'cause tomorrow you gotta go

[Chorus: x2]

Ha ha ha, n****
Rookie of the year, play ya position n****, 
Y'all f*** boys stop ya hustling, y'all n****s know how we do it.
Y'all know what it is.

All the way from the motherf***ing west side to the south side n****.
ML king, Fabora, Four-five, the whole Four block, Three-tweny.
What's up Koolaide? Yeeaahh.
Rest in peace my n**** Steve, Chris Terry, Lil' Mike, Black Horace, we gonna take it to the 

Motherf***ing south side n****.
College Park! Ya know what I'm talking about. Born and raised, Shady P n****. What it is. 
I see ya out there Tony V. Carl Moe, what up n****? Fresh stat from college park. I see ya n****. Ain't nothing but love, ya'll know how we do it. Yung Joc! Block entertainment. B****! Shorty Slick, where ya at? Ya up next n****. And I'm outta here.
