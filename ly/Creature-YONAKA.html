		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is this love, is this just a movie?
Call your bluff, is it all you want it to be?
Am I afraid, or is this growing pains?
Yeah, foot off the brakes
It's time to accelerate

Come on over to your house, maybe move in
Paint a picture for your mind, you'll fit right in
I could be your Harley Quinn, baby, dive in
It's exciting, if you don't fight it

I'll be anything you like, make a true believer
Boy, I won't ever leave ya
I lose control of my mind, something they don't teach ya
And I become a creature
I become a creature

What did you expect?
I'm not your experiment
Say you love me when I'm lovely
When I'm ugly, you repent
I'm a rush of your life
A broken paradise
I'm like needles in your skin
(As you wash your sins)

Come on over to your house, maybe move in
Paint a picture for your mind, you'll fit right in
I could be your Harley Quinn, baby, dive in
It's exciting, baby, won't you fight it?

I'll be anything you like, make a true believer
Boy, I won't ever leave ya
I lose control of my mind, something they don't teach ya
And I become a creature

I, I, I, I, I
I'm a warning sign
Run, run, run, run, run, run
Run for your life
I lose control of my mind, something they don't teach ya
And I become a creature

If I'm what you want then you should know
(I'm watching, I'm starved of that cold)
But I love you more than is possible
(I trip, so you end in a hole)
If you take a dip with me
I will fill your fantasies
But will you still love me tomorrow
When I'm a creature?

I'll be anything you like, make a true believer
Boy, I won't ever leave ya
I lose control of my mind, something they don't teach ya
And I become a creature

I, I, I, I, I
(Ah)
I'm a warning sign
Run, run, run, run, run, run
(Ah)
Run for your life
I lose control of my mind, something they don't teach ya
(Ah)
And I become a creature
(Ah)
