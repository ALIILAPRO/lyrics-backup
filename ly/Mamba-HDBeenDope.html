		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Violation) aye look it ain't done 'til
I say it's finished
No moves 'til I say it's moving
Y'all niggas lose we ain't
Doing what y'all doing understand me?
Fuck are they on, man?

Oh you thought I was done? (Oh my god)
No (Oh my god)
Gotta face it I'm the one (Oh my god)
Hoe (Oh my god) i want the check, want the
Check, want the check, huh
Give me my respect, my respect, my respect
Huh
Medals on my, neck on my neck, on my neck
Huh tell 'em I'm the best, I'm the best
I'm the best fuck what they talking 'bout?

Pushеd back, look back beam on a bitch, hoe
Took that, shook that wings on a bitch
I don't lean on a list
I hit thе scene with a chip
Put the work in, ain't no rest
I'm AC Green on bitch, huh running it now
And I won't be done in a while
I verted they wondering how
I heard 'em they muttering doubt
Something coming better tell 'em if I leave
I'll be right back like, huh – wait
Tell 'em if I leave I'll be right back like

Oh you thought I was done? (Oh my god)
No (Oh my god)
Gotta face it I'm the one (Oh my god)
Hoe (Oh my god) i want the check, want the
Check, want the check, huh
Give me my respect, my respect, my respect
Huh
Medals on my, neck on my neck, on my neck
Huh tell 'em I'm the best, I'm the best
I'm the best fuck what they talking 'bout?

Wait y'all still in denial?
Dudes like me come once in a while
Do what I please why would I run it by you?
Due to hype think these niggas might try you
Unlikely? Nope come get me
Better hurry up, I'm busy
I'ma buddy buck no kizzy
They said that it's funny luck
No really it's us
You wanted war that you wasn't prepared for?
That's tough
You wanted more but forgot what we care for?
That's trust now you getting mopped up like
Damn and you gotta watch us like
Damn whenever I pop up like–

Oh you thought I was done? (Oh my god)
No (Oh my god)
Gotta face it I'm the one (Oh my god)
Hoe (Oh my god) i want the check, want the
Check, want the check, huh
Give me my respect, my respect, my respect
Huh
Medals on my, neck on my neck, on my neck
Huh tell 'em I'm the best, I'm the best
I'm the best fuck what they talking 'bout?
