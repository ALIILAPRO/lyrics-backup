		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The way your body moves
Over my bed when I start to shake at the thought of you
But the thought alone's enough to get high

Like nothing matters
I choke but I can't wait to touch her
The perfect picture
The devil hiding under covers
But when I'm with ya
I see and I get lost in the light

You taste like cold and lonely nights
My voice it breaks from screaming how 
Are you holding me down
You steal like it's second nature
I tear myself to apart
To make you proud

Stop holding me down
Holding me down
Holding me down
I tear myself to apart
To make you proud
Stop holding me

A spark ignites the room
You haunt me
Alone but I can't shake 
The feeling I'm dreaming
Can't sleep 
My thoughts are creeping on you

Like nothing matters
I choke but I can't wait to touch her
The perfect picture
The devil hiding under covers
But when I'm with ya
I see and I get lost in the light

You taste like cold and lonely nights
My voice it breaks from screaming how 
Are you holding me down
You steal like it's second nature
I tear myself to apart
To make you proud

Stop holding me down
Holding me down
Holding me down
I tear myself to apart
To make you proud
Stop holding me

The way your body moves
Over my bed when I start to shake at the thought of you
But the thought alone's enough to get high

Like nothing matters
I choke but I can't wait to touch her
The perfect picture
The devil hiding under covers
But when I'm with ya
I see and I get lost in the light

You taste like cold and lonely nights
My voice it breaks from screaming how 
Are you holding me down
You steal like it's second nature
I tear myself to apart
To make you proud

Stop holding me down
Holding me down
Holding me down
I tear myself to apart
To make you proud
Stop holding me.
