SHY BOY
I'M NOT GONNA BITE BOY
YOU LOOK LIKE A NICE BOY
KNOW I'M JUST YOUR TYPE

BAD GIRL
MAKE ME WANT IT BAD GIRL
BEST YOU EVER HAD GIRL
KNOW I'M JUST YOUR TYPE

I'LL TAKE ANY EXCUSE TO DANCE
ANY EXCUSE TO DANCE
ANY EXCUSE TO
SHOW MY WHAT'S IN YOUR HANDS
AND LET ME

FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK

CHORUS
(FUCK)
I SEE YOUR BOYFRIEND LOOKING AT ME I CAN TELL HE TRYNA (FUCK)
SUPER FLIRTY TALKING DIRTY I KNOW HE JUST WANNA (CUM)
I AIN'T EVEN THAT MAD
I JUST WANT IT SO BED
(FUCK)
AND I DON'T GIVE A

(FUCK)
SAW YOUR GIRLFRIEND IN THE BATHROOM AND SHE SAID SHE WANNA (FUCK)
SUPER FLIRTY TALKING DIRTY I KNOW I CAN MAKE HER (CUM)
I AIN'T EVEN THAT MAD
I JUST WANT IT SO BED
(FUCK)
BUT I DON'T GIVE A

BOYS IN THE BACK
WITH THE SLEEVES AND THE TATS
HITTING BUMPS IN THE BACK
ARE MY TYPE

GIRLS IN THE CLUB
WITH A BUM BUM BUM
SNORTING LINES W THE ONES
ARE MY TYPE

HE WANNA LICK IT LICK IT
COME BE MY LITTLE MUSH
HE WANNA CLICK IT CLICK IT
GIVE ME A HUNDRED BUCKS
