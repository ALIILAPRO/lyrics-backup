		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The signs above my head are clear to all 
An underachiever but a true believer 
Who never had a hope in hell 
I am the soldier, I am the soldier 
Who fought in the war for nothing 
I am the damage that a dream does 
I am the damage that a dream does 

Sing it out, sing it out 
You're not alone 
You are not, you are not the only one 
You were lost and now you're found 
Sing it out, sing it out 

Sing it out, sing it out 
You're not alone 
You are not, you are not the only one 
You were lost and now you're found 
Sing it out, sing it out 

If I sing a song for economics 
The numbers never add up 
I am debt, I am loss, I am written off again 
And again, and again, and again 
So I walk this line alone 
I endure cause I've always known 
The only way things will ever change 
Is if I try and I'm right and I'm right and I'm right 

Sing it out, sing it out 
You're not alone 
You are not, you are not the only one 
You were lost and now you're found 
Sing it out, sing it out 

Sing it out, sing it out 
You're not alone 
You are not, you are not the only one 
You were lost and now you're found 
Sing it out, sing it out 

Sing it out, sing it out 
You're not alone 
You are not, you are not the only one 
You were lost and now you're found 
Sing it out, sing it out 

Sing it out, sing it out 
You're not alone 
You are not, you are not the only one 
You were lost and now you're found 
Sing it out, sing it out
