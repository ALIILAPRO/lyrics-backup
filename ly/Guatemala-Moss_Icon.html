		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sing along. the earth cliffs. all of them. sing strong, you are the color. you are the sound. you are the color. you are the sound that you see. Expose bank. expose bank. Eroded. cyclic rivulet gravitation, pulling. downstream. bound. soil cloud dripped and ripped. dripped and ripped. along and in between the large rocks that are still holding fast. incessant pull against the soft water. Sing Along. Sing Strong. (falling high for neo)-Tropical. towering, tree universal, fell. in the Amazon, there was no one there to hear. there was no one there to hear. you collect the woolen sunlight and sing.
