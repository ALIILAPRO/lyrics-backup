		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've been running for so long, still breathing
Hoping soon to find a song worth singing
Every chapter of this node, they're reading
But you slowly losing hope on bleeding

I'll carry on
My darkest desire
When life sings to you through devil's choirs
Fear (Hey!) wont (Hey!)
Steal what burns in you (Hey!)

I'll carry on
And wait for the fire
My desire, devil's choir
My desire, devil's choir

Raise another broken glass to failure
A simple promise of a crimson savior
Take a look into the life you're leaving
I promise you this isn't pain you're feeling

I'll carry on
My darkest desire
When life sings to you through devil's choirs
Fear (Hey!) wont (Hey!)
Steal what burns in you (Hey!)
I'll carry on and wait for the fire

Rawr
(Come on)

I'll carry on
My darkest desire
When life sings to you through devil's choirs
Fear (Hey!) wont (Hey!)
Steal what burns in you (Hey!)

I'll carry on
And wait for the fire
My desire, devil's choir
My desire, devil's choir

I'll carry on
And wait for the fire
My desire, devil's choir
My desire, devil's choir
My desire, devil's choir
My desire, devil's choir
