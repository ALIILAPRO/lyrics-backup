		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Only think about him on the weekdays and weekends
Only in the mornings and evening
Only when I wake up or sleep in, oh my God
Should've read the warning on the label, I don't
Said, "Proceed with caution", but I won't
Guess I do it often, I know I'm already gone (know I'm already gone)

It's sad but true
I'd go to hell and back if I could go there with you
What do I do?

Oh my God, I'm a fool
Keep on coming back to you
I'm so stupid for you
I'm so stupid for you
You're so bad for my health
But I just can't help myself
I'm so stupid for you
I'm so stupid for you

I have a list of all my habits, habits
Wish I didn't have it so bad, it's
'Cause all of them are you and the bad things that you do
Ooh, I wonder how you do it, make me feel stupid
Try to fight it off but it's useless
I'm so foolish foolin' around with you (foolin' around with you)

It's sad but true
I'd go to hell and back if I could go there with you
What do I do?

Oh my God, I'm a fool
Keep on coming back to you
I'm so stupid for you
I'm so stupid for you
You're so bad for my health
But I just can't help myself
I'm so stupid for you (I'm so stupid for you)
I'm so stupid for you

I'm so stupid for you
For you, for you (I'm so stupid for you)
I'm so stupid for you
For you (mm), for you

It's sad but true
I'd go to hell and back if I could go there with you
What do I do?

Oh my God, I'm a fool
Keep on coming back to you
I'm so stupid for you
I'm so stupid for you (I'm so stupid for you)
You're so bad for my health
But I just can't help myself (just can't help myself)
I'm so stupid for you
I'm so stupid for you (I'm so stupid for you)

I'm so stupid for you
For you, for you
I'm so stupid for you
For you, for you
