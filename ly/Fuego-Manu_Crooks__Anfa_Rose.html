		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, oh yeah
So

I'm on the move
I got it poppin' like no one else and I kept my cool
See we can go to Kumasi, just me and you
And don't you stress about flaws baby, just gotta embrace 'em
I'm just tryna stretch you out, look
I don't wanna be that nasty dude
I gotta be that classy dude
I don't wanna be the nigga go ahead and go slap a dude
I don't even wanna wreck the mood
I'm just really tryna set the mood
She like hey, hey
You run around like you the man, and you known
You come around, you don't do a thing, you a phony
I told that bitch, do not play that shit, I'm grown
I told that bitch, I'll be rich as fuck and beyond

The sun out shining so the girls out
Summer dresses so it's all out
And you impressive, got my thoughts wild
But I'm already taken, got a girl now
And she so, fuego
I don't need to leave, I'll stay home
And we gon' lay low
And see the whole world from our bedroom

Damn
I know what I did eventually drove you crazy
No lie, you were number one, my lady
You was way back even before the navy Mercedes
The boy that ran around suddenly got wavy
See I'm going on a world tour
And if it's loyalty that you asking, girl, then shit, I'm here for it
Let's catch flights, let's kill time
We can see places 'round the world
There ain't no pimping around my girl, shit shit
'Cause honesty and trust, this is what I call rich
And now we on
The flyest one in the room and shit you know it
I ain't tryna be the one to steal your moment
The feeling I get inside is so euphoric
I'm out here for it
My heart you own it
But I told that bitch, do not play that shit, I'm grown
I told that bitch I'll be rich as fuck and beyond

The sun out shining so the girls out
Summer dresses so it's all out
And you impressive, got my thoughts wild
But I'm already taken, got a girl now
And she so, fuego
I don't need to leave, I'll stay home
And we gon' lay low
And see the whole world from our bedroom

Get in my zone
Switch off your phone
My space ship coupe
Go zoom zoom zoom
Don't leave me alone
I'm on my own tonight
Don't leave me alone
Don't leave me alone
Get in my zone
Switch off your phone
My space ship coupe
Go zoom zoom zoom
Don't leave me alone
I'm on my own tonight
Don't leave me alone
Don't leave me alone
