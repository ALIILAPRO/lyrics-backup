		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your lips are silent
Under lock and key
When the darkness holds you
Let your mind run free

If you need somebody
You'll be safe with me
From your minds trenches

In a touch, I gave you all I could
In my heart, I'm just as scared as you
In a rush, we felt the current pull
In a hush, I give my warmth to you 

Cold blood (would you come alive?)
Cold blood (would you come alive?)
Hold on (would you come alive?)
Cold blood (would you come alive?)

When my mind is empty
And I'm light on feet
When the light's are whispering
And the river speaks

If you need somebody
Wrap yourself round me
Let the waves subside

In a touch, I gave you all I could
In my heart, I'm just as scared as you
In a rush, we felt the current pull
In a hush, I give my warmth to you 

Cold blood (would you come alive?)
Cold blood (would you come alive?)
Hold on (would you come alive?)
Cold blood (would you come alive?)

I'll run for you
I'll make us alive
I'll build you up
For you I bleed dry 

Cold blood (would you come alive?)
Cold blood (would you come alive?)
Hold on (would you come alive?)
Cold blood (would you come alive?)
