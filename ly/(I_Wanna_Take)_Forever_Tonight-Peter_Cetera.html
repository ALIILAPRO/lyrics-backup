		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feel your breath on my shoulder
And I know we couldn't get any closer
I don't want to act tough, I just want to fall in love
As we move into the night I get crazy
Thinking how it's gonna be with you baby
I don't want to play rough I've been loving you enough
Oh, baby

I want to take forever tonight
Want to stay in this moment forever
I'm gonna give you all the love that I've got
I want to take forever tonight
Fill you up, fill you up with love
When we close the door all I need is in your eyes
I want to take forever tonight

Touch my lips, I'm on fire
You're the only one I'll ever desire
Turn the lights down low, make the world go slow
When I'm holding you tonight it's so easy
Nothing moves me like you do when you tease me
And to rush would be a crime
I just want to spend some time with you baby

I want to take forever tonight
Want to stay in this moment forever
I'm gonna give you all the love that I've got
I want to take forever tonight
Fill you up, fill you up with love
When we close the door all I need is in your eyes
I want to take forever tonight

And when I'm here beside you
I want to see what drives you out of your mind
I never want to leave I only want to be with you
'Cause I love how you feel your love is so real

I want to take forever tonight
Want to stay in this moment forever
I'm gonna give you all the love that I've got

I want to take forever tonight
Want to stay in this moment forever
I'm gonna give you all the love that I've got
'Cause I can't live without you
