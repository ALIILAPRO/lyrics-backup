		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know where I am
I don't know this place
Don't recognize anybody
Just the same old empty face

See these people they lie
And I don't know who to believe anymore

But there comes you to keep me safe from harm
There comes you to take me in your arms
Is it just a game?
I don't know
Is it just a game?
I don't know

Pleading eyes that break my heart
So homesick I can't feel
But I know I must play my part
And tears I must conceal

There comes you to keep me safe from harm
There comes you to take me in your arms
Is it just a game?
I don't know
To keep you safe from my bow

Take my hand and my heart races
Flames illuminate our faces
And we're on fire
Blow a kiss to the crowd
They're our only hope now

And now I know my place
And now I know my place
We're all just pieces in their games
