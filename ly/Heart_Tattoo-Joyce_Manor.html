		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want a heart tattoo
I want it to hurt really bad
That's how I'll know
I'll know it's real
A real tattoo

I wanna say "what's up dad?"
Who knows how you'd feel about that
What do you want me to say?
It's never going away
My heart tattoo

That's what I'll
That's what I'll do
I'll get a heart
A heart tattoo

I want a heart tattoo
I'll never get it removed
That's how I'll know
I'll know it's real
A real tattoo

I know that it looks bad
But it's the only one I have
What do you want me to say?
It's never going away
My heart tattoo

That's what I'll
That's what I'll do
I'll get a heart
A heart tattoo
(I know that it looks bad)
A heart tattoo
(But it's the only one I have)
A heart tattoo
(I know that it looks bad)
A heart tattoo
(I know)ï»¿
