		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Saw you today after so much time
It felt just like it used to be
Talking for hours about a different life
Surrounded us in memories
Now we were close, never close enough
Where are we now?
'Cause if it's torn, we can stitch it up
Don't rule it out, oh no no

I'll come around if you ever want to be in love
I'm not waiting but I'm willing if you call me up
If you ever want to be in love, I'll come around

Wanted to ask if we could have been
But my tongue wouldn't break the seal
You always had something effortless
In school, you were the biggest deal
Now little cuts close and open up
Time is slipping by
I'm always thinking 'bout the two of us
You play on my mind, always playing on my mind

I'll come around if you ever want to be in love
I'm not waiting but I'm willing if you call me up
If you ever want to be in love, I'll come around

(Ooh oh ooh, ooh oh)

We were young, we were side by side
Don't know when we started losing touch
If you want, we can walk a while
Maybe that would be enough
Used to talk, drink into the night
I would wake up on the front room floor
All alone you'd be in my bed, made me crazy
Made me want you more

I'll come around if you ever want to be in love
I'm not waiting but I'm willing if you call me up
I'll come around if you ever want to be in love
I'm not waiting but I'm willing if you call me up
If you ever want to be in love, I'll come around
