		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well I look at justice in a different light
I been to jail, it didn't make me right
Try and conform but won't be deaf blind dumb
Been beaten down, just harder I've become

Death church rising
Hate church rising
Lost church rising
Death church rising

Hey Jesus can you help me with my pain
Mainline me some religion, keep me sane
Christ suffering upon my TV screen
Send in your money to the faith obscene

Death church rising
Hate church rising
Lost church rising
Death church rising

Strength, truth and honor. words I strive to live
Your faith's profane, it takes never gives
'Cause I'm gonna die standing upon my feet
You're gonna die grovelling on your knees

Death church rising
Hate church rising
Lost church rising
Death church rising
