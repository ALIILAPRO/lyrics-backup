		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tonight, give me yourself tonight if you feel alright
Laying in the passenger seat with your legs on mine
Shine like a star in the night, in a world so dark (Yeah)
You and I both know nothing could change my heart
But you give me reasons to love again
You put the stars and moon in place for my heart
It's true, your love is astonishing
You light the darkest places, you are my star
You are my star
You are my star
You are my star
Tonight, give me yourself tonight if you feel alright
Laying in the passenger seat with your legs on mine
Shine like a star in the night, in a world so dark
You and I both know nothing could change my heart
But you give me reasons to love again
You put the stars and moon in place for my heart
True, your love is astonishing
You light the darkest places, you are my star
Babe, hop in and we go out for a ride, yeah
They say you cannot fit in my life, I say
Fuck 'em and we go for a drive, hoping for the best, no lie
Text me and I'm popping outside, send the lil' addy, and I'll slide
You've been on my mind ever since the day we met, yeah
I look in your eyes, they tell me stories for days, yeah
Fuck 'em and we go for a drive, hoping for the best, no lie
Love me 'til your love runs dry, hold you to my side all night
You are my star
You are my star
You are my star
Tonight (Tonight)
Give me yourself tonight if you feel alright (Alright)
Laying in the passenger seat with your legs on mine
Shine like a star in the night, in a world so dark (So dark)
You and I both know nothing could change my heart
But you give me reasons to love again
You put the stars and moon in place for my heart
You are my star
