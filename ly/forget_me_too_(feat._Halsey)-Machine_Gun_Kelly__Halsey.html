		  (Let me take my fuckin' bracelet off)

You want me to forget you
Okay, forget me too
You tell me you hate me
Baby, yeah, I bet you do

Damn
I saw you walk in the room and I tried my best
Not to panic while I'm lookin' for the back door
I smell the perfume and it's obvious
I'm gonna stay and put my key in the back more
I can't, I can't, I can't pretend to forget you're
The reason I punched a hole in the wall back home
And then, and then, and then a couple hours later we're in Room 29 at The Chateau

I left before you woke up
I don't feel right (see you sober)

You want me to forget you
Okay, forget me too
You tell me you hate me
Baby, yeah, I bet you do
I'm keepin' you waitin'
But I won't wait on you
Want me to forget you
Okay, forget me too

I've wasted so much time
Waitin' around for your phone calls every night
My bad dreams are silk screens
'Cause I taste blood when you bleed
It's eatin' me alive
We'd both be better off alone
Still think I'd get you on the phone
With one last breath in me
I'd die before I'd let you leave

You left before I woke up
Why don't I ever see you sober?

You want me to forget you
Okay, forget me too
You tell me you hate me
Baby, yeah, I bet you do
I'm keepin' you waitin'
But I won't wait on you
You want me to forget you
Okay, forget me too

Hey you
Tell me why you do the things that make me (hate you)
It's an emotional kaleidoscope when I (face you)
Permanent calligraphy, I just tattooed your name on me forever

You want me to forget you
Okay, forget me too
You tell me you hate me
Baby, yeah, I bet you do
I'm keepin' you waitin' (waitin')
But I won't wait on you
Want me to forget you
Okay, forget me too
