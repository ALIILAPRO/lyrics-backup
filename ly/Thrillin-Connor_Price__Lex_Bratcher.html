		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walk in feeling like the villain
Bad guy now what a feeling
Want me to lose no kidding
Red jacket so Thrillin

Yeah I got the grey clouds when I'm coming round
Yeah, even if the sun is out
Unannounced a hundred thousand thunderclouds
Crowd loud the claps sounds like 100 rounds
Pop pop pop, that's a packed house
Pop pop pop, that's how that sounds
Line going down the block where it wrap round
Pull up in a matte Maybach and it's blacked out
Batmobile, the Joker is driving this
I'm at yo heels and nope can't hide from this
That won't heal I hope you surviving this
I guess I'm still the bad guy like Billy Eilish is
One time for the punks and the losers
Two times for the ones we neglected
Three times for the cuts and the bruises
Fourth time came back with a vengeance

Walk in feeling like the villain
Bad guy now what a feeling
Want me to lose no kidding
Red jacket so Thrillin

Walk in feeling like the villain 
They gone get to talking when I'm done (Dunne) I can feel it
When they go low she-go to the ceiling 
Like all my coin (Alma Coin) how they Rose to the millions 
Yeah I be setting the deals
Certain amounts, these Maleficent bills
It's working out how I'm treading the mills 
With hella (Hela) records to build, I grab the bag, then I mack
Black and white Cadilac, Cruella de Vill 
It goes vroom
They don't even know I don't roll with a crew 
Queen make it snow with the flows that she do
I got to crunch them all (chrunchem Hall) so if I shall fall, black magic was involved
If I lose my temper, you lose ya head
Light the room like bender, Azula bred
Dudes stay jealous of who Lexis is
And even if you choose, to hoot too soon you'll lose yo Ren

Walk in feeling like the villain
Bad guy now what a feeling
Want me to lose no kidding
Red jacket so Thrillin
