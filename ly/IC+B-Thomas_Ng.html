		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

Other girls got me feelin' all the same
Little crush but that shit fades away
But when you move I go a bit insane
Love when you say my name

Left, right, back, front, up all night
Keep you awake all through the night
Iced coffee and breakfast, I know what you like
Yeah, yeah

Girl, I'm goin' crazy for you
Wanna do some crazy things to you
I don't mean to be rude
Just wanna do some crazy things to you, yeah

You act so innocent when we're on the phone (we're on the phone)
But, you actin' different when it's us all alone
Girl, the feelin's so nice
Wake up, look in your eyes
Hope you got your sleep cause we'll be rockin' the ride, yeah

Left, right, back, front, up all night
Then wake up in the mornin' feeling you nice
Iced coffee and breakfast, I know what you like, yeah

Girl, I'm goin' crazy for you
Wanna do some crazy things to you
I don't mean to be rude
Just wanna do some crazy things to you, yeah

(Tell me what to do)

(One) love it when I hear you laugh, yeah
(Two) love to feel your hips move like that
(Three) so sweet but you're oh-so bad, yeah
(Four) drive me crazy, let me take it right back to
(One) love it when I hear you laugh, yeah
(Two) love to feel your hips move like that
(Three) so sweet but you're oh-so bad
(Four) drive me crazy let me take it right back to 
One
