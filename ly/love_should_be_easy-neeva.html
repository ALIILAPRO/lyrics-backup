		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Verse 1
Do you even like this party? 
I guess you like I'm not around 
You can sing along 
Don't mind me 
I will get lost inside this crowd

Bridge
You unread me
You misread me 
Then you left me
But you forgot to say

Why you ache me, do you hate me?
Very greatly, for leaving me this..

Hook
Love should be easy 
Love it should be easy

Not a grey suited guy with a gun and one eye 
It should be easy 

Vers 2
Need to know why I got ghosted 
I long for talking to my friend
Remember that night you hosted?
No invitation in my hand, no

Bridge
You unread me
You misread me 
Then you left me
But you forgot to say

Why you ache me, do you hate me?
Very greatly, for leaving me this..

Hook
Love should be easy 
Love it should be easy
Not a grey suited guy with a gun and one eye 
It should be easy 

Hook
Love should be easy 
Love it should be easy
Not a grey suited guy with a gun and one eye 
It should be easy
