		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't envy, I will survive
And I've been begging, begging myself
Please don't close your eyes
I don't have tears, I cried it all
I heard a voice that's inside me
She says, "Please take what you want"

And I've been begging you, begging you
Please show me, please show me who I am
I'm begging you, begging you
Please show me, please show me who I am
I'm begging you, begging you
Please show me, please show me who I am
I'm begging you, begging you
But

I have no fear for no-
I have no fear for nobody
I have no fear for nobody
I have no fear for nobody, nobody now
I have no fear for nobody
I have no fear for nobody
I have no fear for nobody, nobody now

I'm staying here and I'm not lying
And I've been beating, beating on my chest
I'm ready to fight
This is not a dream, this is the truth
This is my story and I count it
We don't give a fuck 'bout you

But I've been begging you, begging you
Please show me, please show me who I am
I'm begging you, begging you
Please show me, please show me who I am
I'm begging you, begging you
Please show me, please show me who I am
I'm begging you, begging you
But

I have no fear for no-
I have no fear for nobody
I have no fear for nobody
I have no fear for nobody, nobody now
I have no fear for nobody
I have no fear for nobody
I have no fear for nobody, nobody

'Cause I'm begging you, begging you
Please show me, please show me who I am
I'm begging you, begging you
Please show me, please show me who I am
I'm begging you, begging you
Please show me, please show me who I am
I'm begging you, begging you
Please show me, please show me who I am
I'm begging you, begging you
Please show me, please show me who I am
I'm begging you, begging you
Please show me, please show me who I am
I'm begging you, begging you
Please show me, please show me who I am
I'm begging you, begging you
But

I have no fear for nobody
I have no fear for nobody
I have no fear for nobody, nobody now
I have no fear for nobody
I have no fear for nobody
I have no fear for nobody, nobody now
