		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bring that break funk
'Cause I'm here giving what you want
Like spread got time to stop got
Time to peel back the roof on my new drop top
The day looking good to me
Got girls want to know cause I freak like jodeci
Besides that let's get with the ground
Want to hear that again then press rewind

If you want to get with me
You've gotta let go baby
If you want to get with me

I don't know what it is but you make me high
A burning feeling that starts inside
It really doesn't matter who's wrong or right
We can go all night, we're going all night

Base vibration
Check it out when my rhyme began
I'll drop my rhyme upon this beat
And make you people move your feet
Everybody from the front to the back, c'mon
Feel the rhythm when I bounce the track
I've gotta hit that, don't want to sit back
I really want to see your hands, could I get that, c'mon

If you want to get with me
You've gotta let go baby
If you want to get with me

I don't know what it is but you make me high
A burning feeling that starts inside
It really doesn't matter who's wrong or right
We can go all night, we're going all night

I don't know what it is but you make me high
A burning feeling that starts inside
It really doesn't matter who's wrong or right
We can go all night, we're going all night

I don't know what it is but you make me high
A burning feeling that starts inside
It really doesn't matter who's wrong or right
We can go all night, we're going all night
