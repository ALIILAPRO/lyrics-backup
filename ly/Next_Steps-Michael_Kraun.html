		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Verse
Uh, bring it back to the borough.
Name another cat that be rapping this thorough.
95 flow, spilling whiskey on the shirt though.
Legends don't die, I'll spit fire out the urn though.
Uh, at a bar by my lonely.
Talking to the bartender, hoping she'll console me.
I know I'm such a puzzle but I'm hoping she can solve me.
(Have another beer till the fear disappears, homie.)
Uh, I ask if they have spotify.
And an iPhone charger -- phone bout to die. 
Yeah, I wanna listen to some death cab.
A-M-C, breaking bad bitches -- no meth lab.
A visit to my heart, here's a guest pass, for your bitch ass.
I'll be famous soon in case yo' bitch ask.
Wait, what number am I on your list as?
If I'm not top ten. Then we are not friends  uh.

Chorus
I'm in my own city feeling out of place.
Starbucks on every corner, we still ain't awake?
Just another fucking day, just another day.
Stumble down the subway stairs through the summer haze.
And think about my next steps, yeah.
And think about my next steps.
And think about my next steps.

Verse
I get my phone back from the bartender.
And now I'm lonely and I'm drunk so my heart's tender.
So I send you a text, see if you're still awake.
You told me I should come through like the old days.
Now I'm lying in your bed, and it's clear to me.
That for all of this time, you were missing me.
And I guess it makes sense cause our history.
But I didn't hit you up to fuck, I wanted company.
(Seriously? Fuck you I hate you!)
I know you think I'ma fuck you then date you.
But I think I'd get bored and then replace you.
Girl, I'm not an animal, it's in my DNA to.
And now I'm here drinking till I erase you.
Cause I don't think there's anything I could've done to save you.
So I leave the bar, and walk through the town.
Don't wanna hear my thoughts -- turn the music loud.

Chorus
I'm in my own city feeling out of place.
Starbucks on every corner, we still ain't awake?
Just another fucking day, just another day.
Stumble down the subway stairs through the summer haze.
And think about my next steps, yeah.
And think about my next steps.
I'm thinking.
