		  Honeybee
Could you imagine where our lives would lead?
That silly ring, it wasn't meant to be
Luckily you saw in me
Something I couldn't see

Honeybee
I can't imagine how my life would be
If all your gravity did not hit me
Oh, don't you see?
Darling, my honeybee

But here we are
After all the messes and confessions
To the stars
That we never really owned as ours

And if our world comes tumbling down
I never could forgive myself for leaving out
You're the one
You are the only one

Such a fool
I took your love and I bent all the rules
You took the blow and didn't let it show
Stuck around to let me know
Built a family of our own

Look around
We made a garden of the love we found
So many reasons I would fight to stay
You're the courage when I fade
Take a look at what we've made

But here we are
After all the messes and confessions
To the scars
That we never really owned as ours

And if our world comes tumbling down
I never could forgive myself for leaving out
You're the one
You are the only one

Won't you decide?
Won't you decide?
I want you to soar
Don't doubt anymore
(Little by little, we meet in the middle)
Won't you decide? (What's your name?)
Won't you decide?
(I hope you can hear me, I needed you near me)
I want you to soar (you save my life)
Don't doubt anymore (let's keep this between you and I)

And if our world comes tumbling down
I never could forgive myself for leaving out

And if our world comes tumbling down
I never could forgive myself for leaving out
You're the one
You are the only one

And if our world comes tumbling down (the world comes tumbling down)
I never could forgive myself, I'll say it now (I never could forgive myself)
You're the one
You are the only one
