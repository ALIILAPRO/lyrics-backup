		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  By the time I get to Phoenix she'll be rising
She'll find the note I left
Hanging on her door
She'll laugh when she reads the
Part that says I'm leaving
'Cause I've left that girl
So many times before by the time I make
Albuquerque she'll be working
She'll probably stop for lunch and
Give me a call
But she'll just hear the phone keep
On ringing, on the wall, that's all
By the time I reach
Oklahoma she'll be sleeping
She'll turn softly and call my name out low
And she'll cry just to think
I'd really leave her
Though time and time again I
Tried to tell her so
She just didn't know I would really go
