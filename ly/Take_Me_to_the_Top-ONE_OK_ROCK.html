		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me to the top, take me to the top
Take me to the top, take it
Take me to the top, take me to the top
Bring me up to pull me down
Take me to the top, take me to the top
Take me to the top, take it
Take me to the top, take me to the top
You're the one to push me over

Let's go

I've never what you really needed
You won't stop, you can't stop, can't let go
Everybody knows
Come with me and listen close
Take me now, I'll take you home
Way too close when I'm far away from you
And all the crazy shit we do

Take me to the top, take me to the top
Take me to the top, take it
Take me to the top, take me to the top
Bring me up to pull me down
Take me to the top, take me to the top
Take me to the top, take it
Take me to the top. take me to the top
You're the one to push me over
I wonder why

Oh, you do this to me every time
Slowly creeping into my mind
Oh, I can see it in your eyes
Suffocating till the day we die

The way too close when I'm far away from you
And all the crazy shit we do
Take me to the top, take me to the top
Take me to the top, take it
Take me to the top, take me to the top
Bring me up to pull me down
Take me to the top, take me to the top
Take me to the top, take it
Take me to the top, take me to the top
You're the one to push me over
I wonder why
I wonder why
I wonder why
