		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maureen
It's hard to explain
I'm never gonna see you again
And you'll never meet my new friends

Maureen, I miss you
I just can't explain
I'm never gonna see you again
I wish you could meet my new friends

Walking along the subway listening to
Loving you is easy acapella
You were a souped-up car in that rent-a-go-cart town
And I miss you Maureen

We're as thick as thieves

Maureen, Maureen
Remember when my mother said to me
"Sade, don't you come home too late
'Til you're back, I stay awake"

And Maureen
With the boys you could tell at a glance
You'd say, "he looks good
Let's hope he can dance"
Wicky-wacky party to the

Where are we going tonight
And what will you be wearing?
Shone like a souped-up car in that rent-a-go-cart town
And I miss you Maureen, I miss you girl

You were my best friend
Never gonna see you again, Maureen
And you'll never meet my new friends
You really were a pearl in my world, Maureen

Maureen
It's hard to explain
You'll never call 'round to see me again
You'll never meet my new friends

Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
