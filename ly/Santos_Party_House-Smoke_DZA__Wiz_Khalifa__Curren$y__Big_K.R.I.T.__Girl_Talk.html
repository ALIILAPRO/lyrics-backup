		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, my bank branch know me first name basis
House party lookin' like a Thursday at Aces
(Right) good gracious, all these blue faces
Told them niggas hold they breath
They can't take it
Stans and Lavers, that's Adidas paper
Authentic Harlem
They ain't wanna see us caked up (Uh, huh)
The rates' up, the gigs' up too
Double header in France
Went for a bag and I picked up two
Back across the water, bosses aura
Belaire Rose flowin' like faucet water
Get love from the plug, he endorse my order
Finesse a few plays, get mo' bucks
Fast as a 'Rari
Bad broad hoppin' out of planes
Put my pot down
Now I'm 'bout to twist another strain
Uh, disappear like David Blaine (Right)
Got a few things I can do
With this Mary Jane like

Pull up in my ride, sick wit' it (yeah)
We gon' prolly get rich to this (Right)
Every time that your girlfriend play this
She gon' prolly get lit to this (Right)
She gon' prolly get lit to this (Really)
She gon' prolly get lit to this (yeah)
Every time that your girlfriend play this
She gon' prolly get lit to this

She wanna roll (Uh)
What she say, she can come but she can't stay
I'll smash on you, but I can't lay
Back shots, still got my sweatsuit on
In my hi-tops
Fo' chains and my Plain Jane watch
Her homegirl watch from the rooftop
I'm the true new season, new coupes out
What you 'bout? I'm on a new route
Bitches shakin' ass lookin' like
Uncle Luke house
Roll so many O's, it's just "Ooo" now
Andretti, couple more Chevy's
In the paint shop, they almost ready
When they hit the streets, you'll know
'Cause all of sudden, nigga turn ice cold
Big paper get where small money can't go
(Big paper get where small money can't go)

Pull up in my ride, sick wit' it (yeah)
We gon' prolly get rich to this (Hol' up)
Every time that your girlfriend play this
She gon' prolly get lit to this (Now)
She gon' prolly get lit to this
(That right, yeah)
She gon' prolly get lit to this
(That right, yeah)
Every time that your girlfriend play this
She gon' prolly get lit to this (Ugh)

I got a priority flow, I'm right at yo do'
Kickin' flavors wrapped in paper
They ain't labeled before southern lights
Ain't a device that could disable the glow
I school a bitch, get down with
You went and catered the ho
I'm on a level that never be
Like planets you'll never see
I sit somewhere in between
Rhythms and melodies
Allow me to primp, primp
Get out with a pimp limp
Put it on a blimp for a
Bitch that done jumped ship
I got this here on cruise control
Ooze the type of cool that Eskimos would know
Rose the type of bread that
Only Huck could fold
Blindfold folk at my house before
I entered the code
â€˜Cause a lame break and enter
Where he ain't enter before
But I block 'em like a center the ball
The way I shine, like I shine like the sun
Ain't been shinin' at all
2AM in the morning, bet she know who to call
Krizzle

Pull up in my ride, sick wit' it
We gon' prolly get rich to this
Every time that your girlfriend play this
She gon' prolly get lit to this
She gon' prolly get lit to this
She gon' prolly get lit to this
Every time that your girlfriend play this
She gon' prolly get lit to this

Roller skates, paper chase
Foreign cars, paper planes
Iron gates, large estates
My name hold weight, my money straight
Roller skates, paper chase
Foreign cars, paper planes
Iron gates, large estates
My name hold weight, my money straight
(yeah)
