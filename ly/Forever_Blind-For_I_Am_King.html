		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bury me 
Please let me lay
Don't you look away
Bury me 
Please let me lay
Don't you look away

No one has come out alive
Against this serpent of pleasure and delight
When you ever make a mistake
I will drag you down into my lake
You can run and you can hide
But I will be on your side 
I want your blood 
I want your tears  
And I can feel
Feel
Feel your fear

You pulled my teeth to stop the biting
You drained my venom to stop the lying
Although we're meant to coexist
I don't want to live like this
I don't want to live like this

The mystery that rules your mind
You are wasting some precious time
With a tail that rattles 
I inject you with the curse of the snake
You can run and you can hide
But I will be on your side 
I want your blood 
I want your tears  
And I can feel
Feel
Feel your fear

You pulled my teeth to stop the biting
You drained my venom to stop the lying
Although we're meant to coexist
I don't want to live like this
I don't want to live like this

You know the truth, I can see it in your eyes 

Liar
You fucking liar

I have seen enough
Enough is enough

Let's go

Bury me 
Please let me lay
Don't you look away
Bury me 
Please let me lay
Just walk away
