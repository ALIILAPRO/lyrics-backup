		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The devil has designed my death
And is waiting to be sure
Plenty of his black sheep died
Before he finds a cure

Oh Lord Jesus
Do you think I served my time?
The eight legs of the devil now
Are crawling up my spine

The firm hand
Of the devil now
Is rocking me to sleep
I force my blind eyes open Lord
But I'm sinking in the day

Oh Lord Jesus
Do you think I served my time?
The eight legs of the devil now
Are crawling up my spine

I go to sleep each evening now
Dreaming of the grave
I see the friends I used to know
Crawling up my leg

Oh Lord Jesus
Do you think I served my time?
The eight legs of the devil now
Are crawling up my spine

Oh Lord Jesus
Do you think I served my time?
The eight legs of the devil now
Are crawling up my spine

Oh Lord Jesus
Here's the news from the fires below
The eight legs of the devil will not
Let my people go
