		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You like to feel a way about it all
I don't feel like I care anymore
You like to kiss and tell, about it all
I don't know you that well
And I'm not tryna get to know you

One more night 'til I let you down
I let you down, you gotta go
One more night 'til I'm sayin' bye
You been around long enough

I close my eyes, don't wake me no more
I break the ties, I'm gone for good now
No, no, no-no, no, no, no
No, no, no-no, no
I close my eyes, don't wake me no more
I break the ties, I'm gone for good now
No, no, no-no, no, no, no
No, no, no-no, no, no-no-no-no-no

(Now, now)
You like to feel a way about it all
I don't feel like I care anymore

And that's how bad I feel
It's a shame that you want more (shame that you want)
It's not that you were bad for me
So don't be paranoid

One more night 'til I let you down
I let you down, you gotta go (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
One more night 'til I'm sayin' bye
You been around long enough

I close my eyes, don't wake me no more
I break the ties, I'm gone for good now
No, no, no-no, no, no, no
No, no, no-no, no
I close my eyes, don't wake me no more
I break the ties, I'm gone for good now
No, no, no-no, no, no, no
No, no, no-no, no, no-no-no-no-no

No, no, no-no, no, no, no
No, no, no-no, no, no-no-no-no-no
No, no, no-no, no, no, no
No, no, no-no, no, no-no-no-no-no

You like to feel a
You-you-you, you like to feel a
You like to feel a
You-you-you, you like to feel a
