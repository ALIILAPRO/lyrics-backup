		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You
You made me numb
Numb numb
I tried
I tried to feel
The pain, the pain

Phone blowing up from 4 different can I come over
She shaped like the s sign from a dollar
Giving me the cake like it's been october
Cute face hoe make her scream call me daddy
Make her waist turn left right no warning
First date, call her back home, watch a movie
Never know the plot cuz we never see the movie

This ain't the life that I need
No I can't be on for long
I'm trynna wipe my memory clean

You gave my nickname to somebody
You can scream it like you used to
But I know that he won't fuck you like I did
(like I did)

You
You made me numb
Numb numb
I tried
I tried to feel
The pain, the pain

All I want is myself back to me
I don't want her symphony
All I feel is emptiness inside
Distance wont do shit to me
A new head lays on my bed every week
I think I'm losing myself
Will I find myself or will I die?
Cuz

You
You made me numb
Numb numb
I tried
I tried to feel
The pain, the pain

You
You made me numb
Numb numb
I tried
I tried to feel
The pain, the pain
