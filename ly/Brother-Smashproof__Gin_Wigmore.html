		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got some questions in my mind.

I got my elbow on the window-sill, 
Hand on my face looking out to the world. 
A lot of questions lay awake in my brain 
And I'm still trying to suss out what ima say. 
And if I do speak on something's if it's you 
Stone cup all that hates so here goes. 
Why is it that when some guy makes it outta a hood life
They're like; No we can't let ya. 
And allow five-oh to rape girls and compensate them 
Like David Bikem is so wrong and expect us working people 
To fund your wages for you to uphold the law, which is what exactly? 
That I really need to know. 'Til then I'll stare outta my window. 
Hehe probably wont get an answer for that one.

I got some questions in my mind that definitely need 
Some answers right now 'cause I gotta know. 
Got all the pieces to the puzzle but can't seem 
To make it fit so I'm lost, tell me where to go.

But you turned your back and you went away. 
It's making me crazy I feel so alone. Why did you turn your back. 
Why did you go away? Cause you were my brother, and you should of stayed.

Listen I lay awake at night looking up 
At the ceiling tryna clear my mind. 
I can't sleep with the shit that I've seen today. 
Seen a dude in the dairy get stabbed for change. 
Passed away. His parents wont pass the pain, 
And feel like you just came let the rain in. 
Feels like you just let it happen man 
Take away a kids life away just because he tagged, damn. 
Why you let us get ahead, if you let us pull us 
Back right before we see the end. Please tell me understand 
Why you took away my friend, son to brother, 
Lost my brother, I gotta know.

I got some questions in my mind that definitely 
Need some answers right now cause I gotta know. 
Got all the pieces to the puzzle but can't seem 
To make it fit so I'm lost, tell me where to go.

But you turned your back and you went away. 
It's making me crazy I feel so alone. 
Why did you turn your back? Why did you go away? 
'Cause you were my brother and you should of stayed.

Listen I gotta few things on my mind 
Can't really explain to you but I gotta try. 
First I wanna know other things why you letting your little brother
Slang rocks out side who drops and do what ever. 
Do you really think's making it better 'cause what 
I see is a cold world living, your little sister known as a hood rat, 
But you can overlook that, proves to us all you wanna do is fit in. 
Why you lettin' your daddy abuse your children 
When they go school bruised they're making excuses. 
Why is the majority of friends that 
You have all gang affiliated, hurting the innocent.

I got some questions in my mind that definitely 
Need some answers right now cause I gotta know. 
Got all the pieces to the puzzle but can't seem 
To make it fit so I'm lost, tell me where to go.

I got some questions in my mind that definitely 
Need some answers right now cause I gotta know. 
Got all the pieces to the puzzle but can't seem 
To make it fit so I'm lost, tell me where to go.

I got some questions in my mind that definitely 
Need some answers right now cause I gotta know. 
Got all the pieces to the puzzle but can't seem 
To make it fit so I'm lost, tell me where to go.

But you turned your back and you went away. 
It's making me crazy I feel so alone. 
Why did you turn your back? Why did you go away? 
'Cause you were my brother and you should of stayed.
