		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's that big drip!
(Zombie on the track)
I got a bunch of niggas in the studio
That's gang-gang though (facts)
Everybody good over there, you heard?
Uh, uh, ay, uh

Never been a hater (never that)
I just, stick to my paper like a stapler (ooh)
Yellow bone smoking purple, LA Lakers, uh
If she give me pussy on a wake up
Double cup of carrot juice
Oh, that's my savage juice
I just copped a Audemar
Oh, and a Patek too
Dripping in that iceberg
Or in a cabber too
Ay bro, don't you cuff that hoe
'Cause I done had her too (I done had her)
They say that they packin', oh we packin' too, uh (oh we packin' too)
Run up like, what's poppin? And what's brackin'? Too, uh (brackin' too)
Said I would get rich and made it happen too, uh (I made it happen too)
Take a picture with your bitch and tag her too, uh (I gotta tag her too)
Savage mode, uh (savage mode)
Rack it and roll, uh (rackin' it and roll)
Clappin' a hoe, uh (clappin' a hoe)
Now you can go, uh (now you can go)
She poppin' a bean, uh (poppin' a bean)
Lickin' on lean, uh
Off-white, off night, cookies and cream

Ooh, ooh
That's that big drip (that's that big drip)
Big wrist (ooh)
Big body, big whips (ooh)
Big Glocks (ooh)
Big guap, big notch (ooh)
Big goons (ooh)
Small problems, big moves (ooh)

Ooh, uh, sauce it up (sauce it up)
All this drip, I could fuck around and wash him up (have him washed up)
Hellcat sound like Mufasa when I start it up
That's a wild body, bitch it's hard to park it up (hard to park)
Uh, buss it like a baby leg, spark it up (spark it up)
Ay, homie tuck your chain it don't spark enough (it don't spark enough)
Ay, homie tuck your chain it don't spark enough
Like what you doin'? Fuck this nigga doin' bro?
This nigga got Cubic zirconia stones, man
Nigga really tryna stunt
My nigga you a lil' nigga, you heard? You a little homie
(You should get your money back) get your money back
Double cup a Hennessy we call it money-gnac (that Henny)
Suwoo! Where all of my bloodies at? 
I took her to the crib and I had fun with that (Yeah I fucked her)
Now come and get your mother back, I'm done with that (your mother)
Yo, I just copped a pocket rocket (grrr), yeah
For all you niggas pocket watching, ay (why you watchin' me?)
Why your rollie tick-tick-tocking?, Ay (why your rollie tick?)
Ay, uh, I fuck her during tax season, perfect timing (perfect timing)
I bagged your bitch in Fashion Nova new designer (new designer)
Uh, man I like them tatted bitches, "Hi, Kehlani" (Kehlani)
I woke up in that pussy, her new name Bugatti (Bugatti)
Uh, bitch, I got that drip, my new name Tsunami

Ooh, ooh
That's that big drip (that's that big drip)
Big wrist (ooh)
Big body, big whips (ooh)
Big Glocks (ooh)
Big guap, big notch (ooh)
Big goons (ooh)
Small problems, big moves (big moves)

Yeah, I'm Young M.A. but she call me papi (she call me papi, ooh)
(She call me papi and I call her mami)
Yeah, I'm Young M.A. But she call me papi (Tati)

(Zombie on the track)
