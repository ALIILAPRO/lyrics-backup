		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fallin' out of love with you
Fallin' out of love with you
Why we fallin' out of love? ooh-ooh, ooh-hoo
Why we fallin' out of love? ooh-ooh, ooh-hoo

I thought you were a good thing
I thought that we would last, oh
(As long as I'm with you) I almost bought you a ring
(It will be okay)
(As long as I'm with you) But baby, I was so wrong
(It will be okay)

Fallin' out of love with you, ooh-ooh, ooh-hoo
Why we fallin' out of love? 

So then I just
Began destroying every part of me that was left
