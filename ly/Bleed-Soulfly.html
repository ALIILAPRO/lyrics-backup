		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What goes around comes around 
You better realize 
You kill life, you kill life 
Why? Why?
I see your eyes, I see your lies 
I see you hide, inside

What goes around comes around 
Now it's your time 
How long can you lie?
How long can you hide?

How long can you live with your soul bleed?
How long can you live with your soul

Bleed bleed bleed bleed bleed bleed 

What goes around comes around 
No more lies 
You kill life, you kill life 
Why? Why?
I see a mother cry 
I see a brother cry 

Bring it on 
Bring it 

I'll make you bleed and you're bleeding now 
Motherfucker

I got my pride and that's all I need 
I'll make you bleed with another blow without the radio 
Don't take advantage of this process 
You might have to digest a blade made for your ass to fade 
I'm living on instinct 
Never think when I'm rushin' bones crushin' 
When I put your sorry ass in a package 
You piece of shit sealed and delivered from a savage 
And now you sweat because you're goin' down 
You envious clown fuckin' bleed
