		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll keep the pictures saved in a safe place
Wow, I look so weird here, my face has changed now
It's a big shame
So many feelings struggling to leave my mouth
And it's not that rare for me to let myself down
In a big way

But I had enough time and
I found enough reason to accept that

It's not the same anymore
I lost the joy in my face
My life was simple before
I should be happy of course
But things just got much harder
Now it's just hard to ignore
It's not the same anymore
It's not the same anymore
It's not the same, but
It's not a shame 'cause

I spend a long time puttin' up with people
Puttin' on my best face
It's only normal when you stop things in the wrong way
It's only four o'clock, and still, it's been a long day
I just wanna hit the hay
People knockin' on me like every day
I'm tired of takin' stress
If only there could be another way
I'm tired of feelin' suppressed
And when they want me the most
I'm tired of actin' like I care, but I do
And I can't wait to hit the bed
But tomorrow makes me scared

'Cause it's not the same anymore
I lost the joy in my face
My life was simple before
I should be happy of course (of course)
But things just got much harder
Now it's just hard to ignore
It's not the same anymore (it's not the same)
(It's not the same, it's not the same)
It's not the same anymore (it's not the same)
(It's not the same, it's not the same)

Oh-oh
Oh-oh

I kept the feelings inside
I open up when shit gets built up this high
She makes it easy to cry
The words fall out of me and there's no more disguise
I miss the days when I was someone else
I used to be so hungry
Right now, my stomach's full as hell
And I've spent many months just hating on myself
I can't keep wishin' things would be different
Or leaving problems on the shelf
I wish I didn't need to get help
But I do
But I do
Oh

I been so hard on myself, yeah
Even my family can tell
And they barely saw what I felt
I wouldn't wish this on my enemy or anyone else

It's not the same
(It's not the same, it's not the same)
It's not the same as before
It's not the same anymore
And it's fine because

I've learned so much from before
Now I'm not short on advice
There's no excuses at all
No point in feelin' upset
Won't take my place on the floor
I'll stand up straight like I'm tall
It's up to me, no one else
I'm doin' this for myself
It's not the same anymore
It's better
It got better
It's not the same anymore
It's better
Yeah, yeah

Oh
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
