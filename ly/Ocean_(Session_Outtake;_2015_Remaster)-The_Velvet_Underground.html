		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here comes the ocean
And the waves down by the shore
Here comes the ocean
And the waves down by the sea

Insects are evil thoughts, thought of by selfish men
Nearly drives me crazy 
I am a lazy son
And I never get things done
'Cause we're made up of water but

Here comes the wave 
Down by the shore
Washing the eye of our land
That has been down by the sea 
Way down by the sea, down by the shore
Way down by the sea

Here comes the ocean 
And the waves down by the shore
Here comes the ocean 
And the waves down by the sea

Insects are evil thoughts, thought of by selfish men
It nearly drives me crazy
Now I am a lazy son
I never get things done
'Cause we're made up of water but

Here comes the wave 
Down by the shore
Washing the eye of our land
That has been down by the shore
Way down by the sea
Down by the shore
Down by the sea

Here come the waves

Here come the waves

Here come the waves

Here come the waves

Here come the waves 

Thank you
