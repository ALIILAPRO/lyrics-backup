		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Of all the boys I've known, and I've known some
Until I first met you, I was lonesome
And when you came in sight, dear, my heart grew light
And this old world seemed new to me

You're really swell, I have to admit you
Deserve expressions that really fit you
And so I've racked my brain, hoping to explain
All the things that you do to me

Bei mir bist do schön, please let me explain
Bei mir bist do schön means you're grand
Bei mir bist do schön, again I'll explain
It means you're the fairest in the land

I could say "Bella, bella", even "sehr wünderbar"
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

I've tried to explain, bei mir bist do schön
So kiss me and say you understand

Bei mir bist do schön, you've heard it all before
 but let me try to explain
Bei mir bist do schön means that you're grand
Bei mir bist do schön, it's such an old refrain
 and yet I should explain
It means I am begging for your hand

I could say "Bella, bella", even "sehr wünderbar"
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

I could say "Bella, bella", even "sehr wünderbar"
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

I've tried to explain, bei mir bist do schön
So kiss me and say that you will understand
