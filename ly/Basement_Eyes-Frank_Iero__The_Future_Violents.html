		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been here before, so proud yet insecure
And it's sad to realize that we used to get high
But now we just get down
What washed up on the shore was unrecognizable
To the crowds gathered 'round
Try to expose what they found
But they never understood

If you wanna believe in something
It's that nothing lasts forever
If you wanted to fight for something
Start a war against time passing by
And the pearl in your eyes
That still can't hold my gaze

We weathered every storm
But we're shattered at the core
And it breaks my heart to doubt who you are
But I'll try and keep the faith

If you wanna believe in something
It's that nothing lasts forever
If you wanted to fight for something
Start a war against time passing by
And the pearl in your eyes
That still can't hold my gaze

If you wanna believe in something
It's that nothing lasts forever
If you wanna believe in something
It's that nothing lasts forever
It's that nothing lasts forever
If you wanted to fight for something, start with us
'Cause it kills me to know
That we used to feel low
But now you just lay down
Oh, and it's time that we all stood up

If you wanna believe in something
It's that nothing lasts forever
If you wanted to fight for something, start with us
I just wanna believe in something
I just wanna believe in something
