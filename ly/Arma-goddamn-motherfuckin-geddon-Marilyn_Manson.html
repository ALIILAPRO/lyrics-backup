		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Death to the ladies first, then the gentlemen
All sorts of tax-free face-lift-abortion-nervous-break-dance
Satanic girls gone wild
Truly fuckin' suicidal

First, you try to fuck it.
Then, you try to eat it.
If it hasn't learned your name,
You'd better kill it before they see it
First, you try to fuck it
Then, you try to eat it
If it hasn't learned your name,
You'd better kill it before they see it

It's arma-goddamn-mother-fuckin-geddon
(Fuck! Eat! Kill! Now do it again!)
It's arma-goddamn-mother-fuckin-geddon
(Fuck! Eat! Kill! [etc])
First, you try to fuck it
Then, you try to eat it
If it hasn't learned your name
You'd better kill it before they see it
It's arma-goddamn-mother-fuckin-geddon

I've got a black eye of a soul
My morals in a hole
I wish I was still dead
But the TV said its just a tropical depression
Pointless intervention, legal separation
Call my dealer or my lawyer, "We've got a situation!"

First, you try to fuck it
Then, you try to eat it
If it hasn't learned your name,
You'd better kill it before they see it
First, you try to fuck it
Then, you try to eat it
If it hasn't learned your name,
You'd better kill it before they see it

It's arma-goddamn-mother-fuckin-geddon
(Fuck! Eat! Kill! Now do it again!)
It's arma-goddamn-mother-fuckin-geddon
(Fuck! Eat! Kill! [etc])
Is it the news?
Or is it the noose?
Results may vary,
Side effects are very
It's arma-goddamn-mother-fuckin-geddon

Arma-goddamn-mother-fuckin-geddon
Arma-goddamn-mother-fuckin-geddon
Arma-goddamn-mother-fuckin-geddon
Arma-goddamn-mother-fuckin-geddon

It's arma-goddamn-mother-fuckin-geddon
(Fuck! Eat! Kill! Then do it again!)
It's arma-goddamn-mother-fuckin-geddon
(Fuck! Eat! Kill! [etc])
Fuck the goddamn, the TV and the radio
And fuck making hits, I'm taking credit for the death toll
It's arma-goddamn-mother-fuckin-geddon
It's arma-goddamn-mother-fuckin-geddon
It's arma-goddamn-mother-fuckin-geddon
