		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One night it was over
Woke up I was sober
You were done getting closer

One night it was over
Woke up I was sober
You were done getting closer

I still think about you when I'm feeling lonely
I still think about you when I'm with somebody
You've been on my mind
I wish that I could turn back time
I wish that I could turn back time
Time
Time
I wish that I could turn back time
Time
Time
I wish that I could turn back time
Time
Time
I wish that I could turn back time
Time
Time
I wish that I could turn back time
Time
Time

I still think about you when I'm feeling lonely
I still think about you when I'm with somebody
You've been on my mind
I wish that I could turn back time
I wish that I could turn back time
Time
Time
I wish that I could turn back time
Time
Time
I wish that I could turn back time
Time
Time
I wish that I could turn back time
(One night it was over)
I wish that I could turn back time
(Woke up I was sober)
I wish that I could turn back time
(You were done getting closer)
I wish that I could turn back time
(One night it was over)

I still think about you when I'm feeling lonely
I still think about you when I'm with somebody
You've been on my mind
I wish that I could turn back time
I wish that I could turn back time
