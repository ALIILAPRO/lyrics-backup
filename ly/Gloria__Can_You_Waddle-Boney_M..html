		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gloria, can you waddle, ah, ah?
Hey, baby can I dance with you?
I will show you something very good
I'm your gander you're my goose

And this is something new for you, oh hear me!
Gloria, can you waddle, ah, ah?
Gloria, can you waddle, ah, ah?
Hey, baby come and dance with me

It's an old dance of the early sixties
All the guys and all the girls were freaked
By this dance of our gees, oh hear me!

Gloria, can you waddle, ah, ah?
Gloria, can you waddle, ah, ah?
Gloria, can you waddle, ah, ah?
Gloria, can you waddle, ah, ah?

Hey, baby can I dance with you?
I will show you something very good
I'm your gander, you're my goose
And this is something new for you, oh hear me!

Gloria, can you waddle, ah, ah?
Gloria, can you waddle, ah, ah?

Can you waddle, ah, ah?
Can you waddle, ah, ah?
Can you waddle, ah, ah?
Can you (Gloria) waddle, ah, ah?

Can you waddle, ah, ah?
Gloria, can you waddle, ah, ah?
Gloria, can you waddle, ah, ah?
Gloria
