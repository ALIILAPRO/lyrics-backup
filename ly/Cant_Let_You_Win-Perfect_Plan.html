		  CAN'T LET YOU WIN
(Lyrics & Melodies: Kent Hilli, Music: Kent Hilli, Rolf Nordström, Leif Ehlin, Mats Byström, Fredrik Forsberg)

Huh
Hmmm

Back on the streets again
that's where I've been spending time
Back to the loaded gun 
I'm on the run
Got back on my feet again 
Been saving to win this time
Cause i know, and someday you'll know
I just can't let go

Cause Nobody else can save
Your life someday
You can call it destiny
I'm somebody else's thrill
who's in for the kill

Now I
Can't let u win
Don't you know that i'm under the gun
And now I'm 
Playing to win
Don't you know that i've already won
You can run
When it's time
But i'm staying 
I can't let you winI can't let you win

I walk on the streets of pain
Thats where i've been biding my time
After the night's begun 
I'm still number one
Hmm, I'm going back, gonna rise again
I'm not giving in this time
Cause i know, and someday you'll know
I just can't let go

PRE-CHORUS 

CHORUS
But i'm staying.

BRIDGE
I can't let you winhmmm
No-one can fight my battles
 I'm not giving in
I'm in for the win
No one can say what matters
So just turn away
U stand in my way

SOLO

PRE-CHORUS

CHORUS X 2

OUTRO
I can't let you win
I can't let you win
I can't let you win
I can't let you win
