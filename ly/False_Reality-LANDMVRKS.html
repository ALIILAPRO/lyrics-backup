		  False Reality!

Don't be so blind, we are nothing at all
Everything is fake and I can't stand it anymore
It's been a torture, (ha!) being so wrong
Feeling like I'm no one, and everyone at once
Living life through the eyes of others
Being trapped when I lose my composure
Everybody pretend
Bury the truth so they can fake themselves

It's all fake and no one cares
All is fake and no one cares

If you show me a sign I'll never look away
We've lost the feeling, lost the meaning anyway
Throw me away into a different world
You've dug your grave into this false reality

Yeah, had to move
I said I was fine, I was lying to you
We knew for a fact it wasn't shatterproof
But we acted like no one knew
See the cries
See the rubble
I don't want to feel that forever
Everyday I fight against your rules
Everyday another lie about you
Everyday's another fake life
Everyday I fight against your rules
I don't want to feel that forever
Wake the fuck up it's now or never

It's all fake and no one cares
All is fake and no one cares

If you show me a sign I'll never look away
We've lost the feeling, lost the meaning anyway
Throw me away into a different world
You've dug your grave into this false reality

See the cries
See the rubble
See the lies
See me crumble
Everyday is like another mistake
Iâ€™ll never fade away
Your lies are for ever
Throw me in a different world
