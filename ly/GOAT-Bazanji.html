		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
They wanna know how to get like me
Dream so big that I cannot sleep
Put in that time and I put in that grind
I'm the best in the world that's all I see
Never back down I'm standing strong
They gonna talk but they all been wrong
What they gon' say when I keep going up?
What they gon' do when I don't fall off?
Look at my skills, looks at my flaws
Never been perfect, I'm not a God
But I'm a GOAT
I been the greatest whenever I spoke
Looking around and they doing the most
Whatever I touch I turn it to gold
Tell 'em there's levels to be in the game
They wanna compete but they not coming close, no
Imma keep goin' again and again
Whatever I want Imma get
They gon' be saying they knowing a friend of a friend
Whenever I become the best
I don't be spending my time on the internet
I just be living it out in the flesh
I don't need nothing to motivate me
Winners are never gon' wait for success, yeah
Look at my neck, shinin'
Look at my bank, commas
Look at my wrist, AP
Who is the GOAT? I am
Look at my neck, shinin'
Look at my bank, commas
Look at my wrist, AP
Who is the GOAT? I am
Aye
Got more money and I got more problems
All that I want is peace and quiet
They all been bothering me
So I gotta keep my phone on silent
No matter the outcome
Already know that I always keep on trying
They wanna do business
But I gotta be a partner, not no client
I'm not like the rest
Too damn smart and they still wanna test me
Move to the MIA and I'm running my team like Messi
Everyone good all around me
I'm giving out bands like candy
Not Halloween but they still be fake
No wonder they don't understand me
I still got a long way to go
All that I do is for me not for show
I don't like putting no pressure on me
But lately I needed it all just to grow
I had to step out of my comfort zone
Give it some time and leave it alone
Now that I'm back and I'm ready for more
I'll give 'em a reason to call me the GOAT, yeah
Look at my neck, shinin'
Look at my bank, commas
Look at my wrist, AP
Who is the GOAT? I am
Look at my neck, shinin'
Look at my bank, commas
Look at my wrist, AP
Who is the GOAT? I am
