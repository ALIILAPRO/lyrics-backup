		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A new responsibility 
Fuels Illumination 
A time to throw the old away 
Start again 
Failure fuels the fire 
Where there's a will there is a way 
To get back up 
Listen as the voice calls to you 
You feel it rumbling 
Pulling from the inside 

Eyes wide open yet no one sees 
With open ears no one's listening 
All mouths are moving still no one speaks
Trying to tame a fire using gasoline 

A cold and eerie desolate place 
Where the mind was enslaved 
Leaving that stale misleading state 
Break away 

With failures fueling the fire along the way 
To conquer or falter 
Begins from the inside 

Eyes wide open yet no one sees 
With open ears no one's listening 
All mouths are moving still no one speaks
Trying to tame a fire you're pouring gasoline

Why are the souls so distant 
While spirits stand all alone 
How do you starve the flesh from chaos 
Stop feeding it 

Starving the flesh from chaos 

Eyes wide open yet no one sees 
With open ears no one's listening 
All mouths are moving still no one speaks
Trying to tame a fire you're  pouring gasoline
