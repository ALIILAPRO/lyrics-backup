		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  99, I've been waiting so long
Oh 99, where did we go wrong
Oh 99, (I) I love you

99, I keep breaking your heart
Oh 99, how can we be apart
Oh 99, (I) I love you

I never thought it would happen, I feel quite the same
I don't want to hurt you anymore
I never knew it would work out, no one to blame
You know I love you, 99

99 (whoo-ooh), you keep holding my hand
Oh 99, they don't know who I am
Oh 99, (I) I love you

I never thought it would happen, I feel quite the same
I don't want to hurt you anymore
I never knew it would work out, no one to blame
You know I love you, 99

99 (whoo-ooh), I can't take it no more
Oh 99, oh, we were so sure
Oh 99, (I) I love you

99 (whoo-ooh)

I love you

99
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

I love you
