		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've been doin' that nine-to-five straight line walkin'
Yeah, it's been a long time
Yeah, it's been a long time
Since I've seen that lettin' down your hair
Double-dog-dare look in your eyes
Oh, and you've been burnin' it at both ends
Been a hot minute since you flipped that switch
Girl, it ain't nobody's fault, let's shut the world off
And turn it back to when

It was you, me, and whiskey all night long
Sinkin' to the bottom of them country songs
Fire burnin' hot 'til the last drop's gone
Let's turn it up, turn it up
'Til we take that Black Label buzz too far
And say them things that stay in the dark
Ain't nothin' as sweet, ain't nothin' as strong
As you, me, and whiskey all night long

I see you still got that knock-it-back shot glass
Girl, you ain't missed a beat
You already let a little four letter slip
And your hands are all over me
And you're already talkin' dirty and it's only 10:30
We know where it goes from here
I can't find this me in a red wine glass
Yeah, and I can't find it in a beer

It's you, me, and whiskey all night long
Sinkin' to the bottom of them country songs
Fire burnin' hot 'til the last drop's gone
Let's turn it up, turn it up
'Til we take that Black Label buzz too far
And say them things that stay in the dark
Ain't nothin' as sweet, ain't nothin' as strong
As you, me, and whiskey all night long

Yeah, baby
Whiskey all night long

You, me, and whiskey all night long
Sinkin' to the bottom of them country songs
Turnin' this house to a honky tonk
Let's turn it up, turn it up
'Til we take that Black Label buzz too far
And say them things that stay in the dark
Ain't nothin' as sweet, ain't nothin' as strong
As you, me, and whiskey all night long
Yeah
Whiskey all night long
