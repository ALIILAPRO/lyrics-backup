		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo, what's up? If you trying to get into contact with me
Leave a quick message after the beep
And I'll make sure to get back to you
In one handshake, peace

Hey Mijo, it's me again
I've been tryin' to call you already five to six times
You're not pickin' up your phone and I'm worried
Ya son las tres de la mañana, babe, ¿dónde estás?

I know I always bring this up but now it's time we talk
Mijo, please take a lil minute, sit back and relax
Listen to my words, I ain't tryin to be your mom
Te quiero mucho por favor and I deserve to know what's up
All those late night calls, when you gotta bounce
Your homies coming first, what's that all about?
I fell in love with a gangster, yeah, that's right
But I don't think you realize how I hurt inside
Always worryin', mi pelon, if you're comin home
That's why I call you so much when you leave me alone
I don't wanna bug and this I promise you
But in this situation, it's so hard to trust you
I care about you so much, lovin' you like crazy
All I really want is to have your little baby
Tell me that you love me, you will never leave me
Soy la reina de tu vida and you're happy to be with me

Daddy, let me know that I'm your only girl
The only man that I need in this gangster world is you
And I wouldn't trade it

So why you think I would lie, won't you tell me, girl?
The only one that I need in my gangster world is you
And I wouldn't trade it

You see, I know it's been a struggle, I can see in your eyes
Tear drops, they fall, get me every time
Baby girl, don't cry, understand that I try
The only hope that I hold in my gangster life
I hold you dear to my heart though I'm out in the night
Tryin' to make a lil' money then come home to a fight
A little fuss, can't trust that's it's never enough
When embraced by your touch in this thing called love
Although I leave so prestige with my hand on my heat
I got a jar full of boulders so we all could eat
Comprehend that I spend most my time in the streets
And all these other wicked women don't matter to me
It's not like I'm just tryin' to get up and leave
I work hard every minute in the face of defeat
I stomp my feet with pride, knowing that you're by my side
What you think, I was just let you walk on by?

Daddy, let me know that I'm your only girl
The only man that I need in this gangster world is you
And I wouldn't trade it

So why you think I would lie, won't you tell me, girl?
The only one that I need in my gangster world is you
And I wouldn't trade it

I understand what your tellin' me but it's so hard
Always fuss and we fight 'til we back at the start
Te amo te quiero mi crazy vato gangero
Sé lo que yo tengo contigo pero te tengo
I know you mean well when you hold me tight
The only one who can handle me right during a fight
And I cherish all the times that I spend with you
Hold your pictures in my hands when I pray for you
If this is gangster love then I'm down for whatever
Lay me down on the cama and enjoy that we're together
Turn on the candles, hickies on my cuello
Mi firme veterano, mi firme pandillero
Always down to ride for you, like Bonnie and Clyde would do
I'll always stand with you, forever be true
Keep you on my mente, siempre mi vida
I'm a gangster's wife to an anybody killa

Daddy, let me know that I'm your only girl
The only man that I need in this gangster world is you
And I wouldn't trade it

So why you think I would lie, won't you tell me, girl?
The only one that I need in my gangster world is you
And I wouldn't trade it

Hello, mijo, where are you?

Hey baby, I just called to tell you
I'm right here on the border, daddy's comin' home
