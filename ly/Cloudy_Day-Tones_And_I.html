		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Am I living?
Oh, what a funny thing to say
But there's alive and then there's living
Am I living for today? Mm

And I'm gettin' older
With every memory I make
Now that I'm older with these moments 
Will I live for them or just throw them away, away?

But your mama always said 
Look up into the sky
Find the sun on a cloudy day
But your mama always said 
Look up into the sky
Find the sun on a cloudy day
On a cloudy day

But your mama always said 
Look up into the sky
Find the sun on a cloudy day
(On a cloudy day)
But your mama always said 
Look up into the sky
Find the sun on a cloudy day
(On a cloudy day)

And am I wiser
For holding close the friends I make?
But if I'm wise then why this feeling
Of a child that I can't shake?

And I'm gettin' older
With every memory I make
Now that I'm older with these moments 
Will I live for them or just throw them away, away?

But your mama always said 
Look up into the sky
Find the sun on a cloudy day
But your mama always said 
Look up into the sky
Find the sun on a cloudy day
On a cloudy day

But your mama always said 
Look up into the sky
Find the sun on a cloudy day
(On a cloudy day)
But your mama always said 
Look up into the sky
Find the sun on a cloudy day

But your mama always said 
Look up into the sky
Find the sun on a cloudy day
But your mama always said 
Look up into the sky
Find the sun on a cloudy day
(On a cloudy day)

But your mama always said 
Look up into the sky
Find the sun on a cloudy day (ooh)
But your mama always said 
Look up into the sky
Find the sun on a cloudy day
Day, day, day

Oh, oh, oh
On a cloudy day
