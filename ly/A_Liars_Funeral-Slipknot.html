		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The season at an end
A harvest of seclusion and regret
The burning can begin
A period of ash is what you get
The quiet is a curse
But my respect was shown to you by force
Another day too late
Another neck too eager for the rope

Liar
Liar

Yesterday was hard
Tomorrow's just a promise of the same
When friends have all subscribed
To spitting on the ground to say my name
Fire on the ice
December in the summer kills the heart
Your hate is no surprise
I guess I have to die to play my part

Liar
Liar

Close your eyes and join the blind
Slit your wrists for peace of mind
Turn your back and show us the truth
There's only one way to remember it for you
Burn, burn, burn the liar
Burn, burn, burn the liar
Burn, burn, burn the liar
Burn, burn, burn the liar

Hold the weight
Never trust the one beside you
Carried away
You know just as much as I do
Hold the weight
Do it all for what you really love
Carried away
Use you up until you've had enough

Hold the weight
Never trust the one beside you
Carried away
You know just as much as I do
Hold the weight
Do it all for what you really love
Carried away
Use you up until you've had enough

Clench your teeth and tighten your grip
Stand up straight, don't let it slip
Burn, burn, burn the liar
Burn, burn, burn the liar

True victims and survivors learn to make war
Don't wanna be the sad man singing anymore
I did it all wrong, so I'd get it all right
We're wasting all the candles, the dead need no light

Liar
Liar
Liar
