		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where you can hear a country song from far
And someone play the honky-tonk guitar
Where all the lights will go out one by one
The people join the song and the wind takes it away

Where the Mississippi rolls down to the sea
And lovers found the place they'd like to be
How many times before the song was ending
Love and understanding everywhere around

Mississippi
I'll remember you
Whenever I should go away
I'll be longing for the day
That I will be in Greenville again
Mississippi
You'll be on my mind
Every time I hear this song
Mississippi roll along
Until the end of time

Now the country song forever lost its soul
When the guitar player turned to rock 'n' roll
And every time when summer nights are fallin'
I will always be callin', dreams of yesterday

Mississippi
I'll remember you
Whenever I should go away
I'll be longing for the day
That I will be in Greenville again
Mississippi
You'll be on my mind
Every time I hear this song
Mississippi roll along
Until the end of time
Every time I hear this song
Mississippi roll along
Until the end of time
