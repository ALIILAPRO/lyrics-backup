		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Turn it up
Yeah, here we go, alright

Living reckless, living fast, don't have time for regret
Might've pushed it to the limit, but I'm not dead yet
Drop it
I'm not dead yet
Yeah, I'm not dead yet

(Unresponsive) incoherent while I'm flirting with death
(Paralyzed) in the depths while I try to repent
(Felt like a kick) to the chest, finally woke up again
(I've been using) my confusion 'cause my sanity's spent

Take a look around, there's nobody left
This isn't paradise, my vice could be the end
Vitals are critical, the dark's creeping in
If this is do or die, it's time to start again

All my worries were a waste of time
Made the world so blurry I was going blind
I can finally see like the others
Think that I just discovered
A way to let you see under
Under the surface now
Under the surface now

(Complicated) all the basics, forgot how to breathe
(Turned distortion) to 11, couldn't make out a thing
(In the abyss) going deeper, it's okay, I insist
(Out of focus) gotta figure out how to see quick

Take a look around, there's nobody left
This isn't paradise, my vice could be the end
Vitals are critical, the dark's creeping in
If this is do or die, it's time to start again

All my worries were a waste of time
Made the world so blurry I was going blind
I can finally see like the others
Think that I just discovered
A way to let you see under
Under the surface

Let me say it loud and clear so you never forget
Might've pushed it to the limit, but I'm not dead yet

All my worries were a waste of time
Made the world so blurry
(Ohh-oh-ohh) let's go

All my worries were a waste of time
Made the world so blurry I was going blind
I can finally see like the others
Think that I just discovered
A way to let you see under
Under the surface now, now
Under the surface

Under the surface now
