		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Doesn't know what to do anymore
Jesus makes love to the spike
A trick for a fix and feeling so sick
Just can't seem to get right
Once he was the king of his world
A world without any order
Sold it all without thinking twice
Just for a spoonful of water
Ride, ride on through
Ride, ride through you
Ride, ride on through
Ride, ride through you 
Ceremonious ritual
Raising of the veins
Always early and feeling so late
Waving goodbye to the rain
Ride, ride on through   
Ride, ride through you  
Ride, ride on through   
Ride, ride through you  
Slowly scratching away at the world
Fearless when he is stoned
Obsessed by dreams of what could've been
Trapped in his kingdom alone
Ride, ride on through   
Ride, ride through you  
Ride, ride on through   
Ride, ride through you
