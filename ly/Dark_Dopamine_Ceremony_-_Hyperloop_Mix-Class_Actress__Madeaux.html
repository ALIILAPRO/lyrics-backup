		  Dark Dopamine Ceremony
Love me like a flying dream
Let's make out in the tunnels under LA
Hyper-loop back to my place
I just wanna chill with you come over bring the pills
send a car pick me up it's snowing in the hills
I am losing patience with this conversation

Can't drug it away Gotta love it
Or the pain gonna stay and I'm over it over it

Dark Dopamine Ceremony
Love me like a flying dream
Let's make out in the tunnels under LA
Hyper-loop back to your place

I just wanna chill with you come over bring the pills
send a car pick me up it's snowing in the hills
I am losing patience with this conversation

Can't drug it away Gotta love it
Or the pain gonna stay and I'm over it over it

I just wanna chill with you
send Tesla Pick me up
it's snowin in the hills for you 
snowin in the hills for you

Cant drug it away gotta love it
or the pain gonna stay and i'm over it over it
