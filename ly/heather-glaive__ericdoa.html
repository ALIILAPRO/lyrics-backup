		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whoa, whoa, oh
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I don't like how you talk to me so constantly
And you probably thinking, "Wait, wait, what could he offer me?"
I need all these changes, get off of me
They watching me like, "Where will he go?" like, "What will he do?"
I heard this rumor 'bout him, but I don't know if it's true
'Cause I've never been better, I gave that bitch Astrid my sweater
But I bought another and gave it to Heather

I got it on me, lil' baby, I make 'em lay down
Grown men askin' me questions like what I make now
Yeah, I want everything inside his pockets, like it's a shakedown
And if he swing, man, we get to jumpin' like it's a playground, ayy
I don't know what you want from me
Bringing up times when you wanted me
Anything you want, I got all those things
Ha, yeah, I got all those things

I got a hard head but it's not nothing new
You hit me up last night look for something to do
I think it's fucked up that you're making me choose
Ayy, I've had enough, it's quite rough being stuck to you
Shut your mouth, I'm tryna get up, but I don't know how
From dawn 'til dusk, we'll be at your house
Get his shit turned up, jump inside the crowd
I'm MIA, no one ever seems to know where I be at
They on my ass, I don't do much, I smile at her and I just laugh
They always mad, so I just brush it off and act like I can't help it
After everything that happened, how come I cannot be selfish? I swear

I got it on me, lil' baby, I make 'em lay down
Grown men askin' me questions like what I make now
Yeah, I want everything inside his pockets, like it's a shakedown
And if he swing, man, we get to jumpin' like it's a playground, ayy
I don't know what you want from me
Bringing up times when you wanted me
Anything you want, I got all those things
Ha, yeah, I got all those things
