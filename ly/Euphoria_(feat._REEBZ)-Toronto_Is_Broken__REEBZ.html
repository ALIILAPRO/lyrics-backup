		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I found out
Nothing really matters to me
We’re all fading into obscurity

Break you down
Call me your king
Who doesn’t give a fuck
I was spat out by the mouth of a god

No truth in what we believed in
For so long
Learn to embrace this devastation
In chaos I am reborn

Now I’m breaking apart
I feel the thrill
Done playing my part
I can’t keep still
Now I’m tearing apart
The great moth’s wings
Welcome the dead
Standing, rotting, waiting

(I was spat out by)
(I was spat out by)
(Nothing matters to me)

I was spat out by the mouth of a god

Euphoria

Break you down

I spit you out from my-

No truth in what
We have believed in
We decay in the dark
Emerge from corruption
Empire of destruction
I embrace this devastation
From the chaos I carve
I am reborn again

Euphoria
Euphoria
I spit you out from my-

(There is no light now)
(There is no light now)
(There is no light now)

No need to fight now
There is no light now
All my flesh and blood will cease to flow
Know this cruel comprehension
There will be no ascension
Lying cold underground
All alone

I spit you out from my mouth
I was spat out by the mouth of a god

The mouth of a god
The mouth of a god
The mouth of a god

Break you down
Call me your king
Who doesn’t give a fuck
I was spat out by the mouth of a god

No truth in what
We have believed in
We decay in the dark
Emerge from corruption
Empire of destruction
I embrace this devastation
From the chaos I carve
I am reborn again

Euphoria

(Embrace the moment and it all ends)
Embrace the moment and it all ends
Embracing your trivial existence

(Trivial existence)
(Empire of destruction)

Break you down
Call me your king
Because I was spat out by the mouth of a god
