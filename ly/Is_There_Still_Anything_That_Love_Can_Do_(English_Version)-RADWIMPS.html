		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Born with nothing in my hands
I stumble upon this place
Falling through a crack in time
I was writhing in pain

When those who make it in this age
Are only those who learn how to take
And everyone is giving up
Where do we all take a breath?

Governors and Gods alike
Trying to turn the other cheek
But even if you look away
The truth is always facing you

Courage and the strength of hope
The magical bond we share
We grow up only to forget
How we ever used them here

But same as you were on that day
I see you still standing there
Glowing in your innocence
You were always standing there

When the world turns its back on you
You find a way to stand and fight
Ready to face it all
I see you here, shining bright

I need to know if there's still anything that love can do
I need to know if there's still anything that I can do

You are the one who found my courage and I knew
I wanna pay it back and spend it all on you
You gave me love we share, it's all because of you
You are the reason, let me share this love with you

I need to know if there's still anything that love can do
I need to know if there's still anything that I can do

What if our destiny
Was just a roll of the dice
Or if it's up to the Gods
And if they feel like playing nice

A mission that we didn't choose
Like armor that we can't remove
Or maybe it's a distant wish
Something that we can't refuse

Prayers that are never heard
Reunions that never occur
Arguments that never clear
Hate that doesn't disappear

I hear the voices that forgive
I see them standing hand in hand
But with its arm open wide
The earth embraces all again

I need to know if there's still anything that love can do
I need to know if there's still anything that I can do

You are the one who found my courage and I knew
I wanna pay it back and spend it all on you
This love we raised together, shaped by me and you
You are the reason, let me live this love with you

I need to know if there's still anything that love can do
I need to know if there's still anything that I can do

So insignificant just you and me
So why were we given this dream?
And if this life is just going to end
Tell me, why were we allowed to feel hope?

And if it's just gonna slip out of my hands
Then why even give it to me?
'Cause ain't it sad how we try to hold on
Knowing one day, it'll be gone
Or maybe it's beautiful?

Answer me!

All these love songs we hear
Already they've been sung to death
All the movies that we've seen
They said everything they can
But somehow you and me fell into this wilderness
But still, I need to know

I need to know if there's still anything that love can do
I need to know if there's still anything that I can do
