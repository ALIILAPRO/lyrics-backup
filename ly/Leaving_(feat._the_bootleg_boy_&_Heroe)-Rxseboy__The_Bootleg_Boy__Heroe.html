		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Forgive me
My heart is leaving
Please make it stop
That's all I ask

Babe, I don't know what's going on
We've been in love forever and ever
But I feel like something is wrong
I used to look in your eyes, you'd look into mine
The feelings were strong
But now when I look in your eyes, there's nothing inside
And I'm sorry my feelings are gone
I don't know how to describe it
My heart is beating in silence
I used to love all the warmth
I'd sit on your porch and finish assignments
You would tell me 'bout the big things
I fell in love in an instant
Thought that we'd go to the grave and love every day
But lately the feeling is different

Save me
I feel low lately
Feel dead inside me
'Cause you're all I've have

I don't wanna lose the love that we built
And I don't wanna coexist with the guilt
I just wanna take it back to the start
Back when no one else could pull us apart
Things changed, I admit I was absent
New crowd, I was picking up habits
Three months, I was packing my baggage
Came back, realisation was tragic
Yeah, honestly, it felt like maybe I just hadn't lived before
Felt I had nothing to give before
Nowadays, I wanna smile for no reason
You're in denial, it's not easy
I know I made you feel so awful
So, believe me, I'm sorry

Forgive me
My heart is leaving
Please make it stop
That's all I ask

(Forgive me
My heart is leaving
Please make it stop
That's all I ask)
