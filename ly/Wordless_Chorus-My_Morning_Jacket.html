		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So much going on these days
Forget about instinct, it's not what pays
Pleasure, up and down my smile
A carton of eggs think, it's all worthwhile
Tell me spirit, what has not been done? 
I'll rush out and do it, or are we doing it now?

Ah, ooh, ah, ah, aha
Aha, ooh, ah, ah

Fissure is the thrill of the day 
Forget about feeling, that's not what pays
But you know, all of this can change
Remember the promise as a kid you made

Ah, ooh, ah, ah, aha
Aha, ooh, ah, ah

We are the innovators, they are the imitators
C'mon, hey, don't you know how we started
We forgot about love, but weren't brokenhearted

Ah, ooh, ah, ah, aha
Aha, ooh, ah, ah

Ah, ooh, ah, ah, aha
Aha, ooh, ah, ah

Ah, ooh, ah, ah, aha
Aha, ooh, ah, ah

Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ahaha, yeah, yeah, yeah
