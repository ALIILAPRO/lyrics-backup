		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I fought the good battle
Did my best to please God
Now I'm off to paradise

I'm diving in wonder
For this peace I have inside
Goes beyond the earth and skies

The Father sees
Every trial
Every tear
He Turns into smiles

The Father speaks
Listen and follow
He's there every step
He's there every mile

Now I'm here
Like a child in a courtyard
Finally!
Lord I thank You for it all! 

Now I'm here
Like a child in a courtyard
Finally!
Lord I thank You for it all! 

I fought the good battle
Did my best to please God
Now I'm off to paradise

I'm diving in wonder
For this peace I have inside
Goes beyond the earth and skies

The Father sees
Every trial
Every tear
He Turns into smiles

The Father speaks
Listen and follow
He's there every step
He's there every mile

Now I'm here
Like a child in a courtyard
Finally!
Lord I thank You for it all! 

Now I'm here
Like a child in a courtyard
Finally!
Lord I thank You for it all!
