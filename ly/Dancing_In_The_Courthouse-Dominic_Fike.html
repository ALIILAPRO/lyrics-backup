		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Weather controls your day
People make up your mind
Until you can't even tell
When someone gives you a sign
But we make the ground our grave by layin' in it
We make our problems faith by facin' 'em
We make the wind our wings by raisin' your arms
At the top of the world, yeah

Girl, I'll try (I'll try)
Make 'em dance for it in the courthouse
Make a stand for it or a dog pound
Be the landlord of the whole town
Put up, on edge
Make the judge jump and hit the two-step (hit the two-step)
And make the jury come up with two dances (two dances)
Twistin' loose ends, you standin', make up a nuisance

Ayy, hell or high water, we cover for you like camouflage
And it's not over 'til the fat woman sing hella high (hey)
Tap dancin' in my (hey)
Until I feel a change in my day to day on a daily basis
We make the love that keeps our world spinnin'
We make the gods our friends by cursin' em
We make the wind our wings by raisin' your arms
At the top of the world, yeah

Girl, I'll try (I'll try)
Make 'em dance for it in the courthouse
Make a stand for it or a dog pound
Be the landlord of the whole town
Put up on edge
Make the judge jump and hit the two-step (hit the two-step)
And make the jury come up with two dances (two dances)
Twistin' loose ends, you standin', make up a nuisance

Since I'm through plannin', she livin' like a loose cannon
Then lose, man, that's so funny, I should do standup
I'm rude and a superhero like Bruce Banner
But truth is, ain't nothin' that you could do

Put up on trial
Make 'em dance for it in the courthouse (courthouse)
Make a stand for it or a dog pound (dog pound)
Be the landlord of the whole town
Put up on edge
Make the judge jump and hit the two-step (hit the two-step)
And make the jury come up with two dances (two dances)
Twistin' loose ends, you standin', make up a nuisance

Girl, I'll try 
Make 'em dance for it in the courthouse (in the courthouse)
Make 'em dance for it in the courthouse
