		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were six-foot tall in the mosh pit
Lord knows I've been that man
Keep your head low, blend in
But looks like you've got other plans

Roll your sweater sleeves up
Put your drink on the counter
Give the people what they want
What they want is a man who will give
Everything he's got
Steal the show from the opener
Your ex said you can't dance
Now you're showing her

Oh, you're a dancing dream
A mean machine
A ballerina
Oh, and the camera phones are flashing now
Leave it all on the floor
You can leave it
Leave it all on the floor
You can leave it all
Leave it all on the floor

What else is in store?
(All eyes on you, all eyes on you)
They're begging for more
(More! More! More! More!)

Well, you got spin moves, handstands
Making all the fans chant
We came here to listen
Now we'd rather watch this man dance
You're their sweetie pie, golden boy
You're their buttercup
Your ex said you can't dance
Now you shut her up

Oh, you're a dancing dream
A mean machine
A ballerina
Oh, and the camera phones are flashing now
Leave it all on the floor
You can leave it
Leave it all on the floor
You can leave it all
Leave it all on the floor

Oh, you're a dancing dream
A mean machine
A ballerina
Oh, and the camera phones are flashing now
Leave it all on the floor
You can leave it
Leave it all on the floor
You can leave it all
Leave it all on the floor
