		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You change like seasons
Red Yellow Silver Gold
Don't want these reasons
It's time to let you know
It's sad to see dishonesty
Is the first place that you go
When you're backed into a corner
It's hard t say this but

You're so SHADY
The sun's up but your still cold
And all your yes no maybe's
Damn its really getting old cause
Second best never comes in first
One of us is gonna get hurt yeah
You're so SHADY
The sun is up but you're still cold
Yeah you're so Shady
Yeah you're so Shady
Yeah you're so Shady Ooh Oh

The same old story
you say that you're at home
But I saw your story
And girl you're not alone
It's sad to see dishonesty
Is the first place that you go
When you're backed into a corner
I don't wanna say this but

You're so SHADY
The sun's up but your still cold
And all your yes no maybe's
Damn its really getting old cause
Second best never comes in first
One of us is gonna get hurt yeah
You're so SHADY
The sun is up but you're still

Running out of time
Thought that we were fine
I'm losing my mind Ohhhhh
Guess we lost our light
Thought that we were fine
Im losing my mind Ohhhhh

You're so SHADY
The sun's up but your still cold
And all your yes no maybe's
Damn its really getting old cause
Second best never comes in first
One of us is gonna get hurt yeah
You're so SHADY
The sun is up but you're still cold
Yeah you're so Shady
Yeah you're so Shady
Yeah you're so Shady
Yeah you're so Shady
Yeah you're so Shady
Yeah you're so Shady
