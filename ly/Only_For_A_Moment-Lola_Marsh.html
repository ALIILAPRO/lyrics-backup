		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lost and found
My mind, but only for a moment
All my crimes
Are safe beneath my heart

And I try, oh, I try
To pretend that I am fine
Tell me why, oh, tell me why
I need you by my side

And suddenly I'm bored, I'm dancing in the dark
Counting all the billboards and the city lights
I'll keep all my affection in a paper cup
Oh, I, oh, I

You stayed only for a moment
I said stay with me a while
You faded like a pretty snowflake
That I was holdin' in my hand

You stayed only for a moment
I said stay with me a while
You faded like a pretty snowflake
That I was holdin' in my hand

Rest your eyes
Better days are comin', I can feel it
All my lies are safe beside you now

And I try, oh, I try
To pretend that I am fine
Tell me why, oh, tell me why
I need you by my side

And suddenly I'm bored, I'm dancing in the dark
Counting all the billboards and the city lights
I'll keep all my affection in a paper cup
Oh, I, oh, I'm
Runnin' after bluebirds, show you what I've got
Save all my tomorrows from the lonely nights
Can you hear me cryin'? Baby, I'm alright
Oh, I, oh, I

You stayed only for a moment
I said stay with me a while
You faded like a pretty snowflake
That I was holdin' in my hand

You stayed only for a moment
I said stay with me a while
You faded like a pretty snowflake
That I was holdin' in my hand

Lost and found
My mind, but only for a moment
