		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’d kiss you in public if we lived on the moon
nothing but craters and you
We’d build a house, with no people to judge
how we cook, how we clean, or
how we fall in love

All that I know is I want you forever
and nothing like this could be wrong
If people on earth think that they know us better than we do
then I'll live on the moon with you

I’d hold your hand if we lived on the moon
walking down the avenue
we’d never think twice about who we’d offend
and we’d never say we’re just friends
no we’d never say we’re just friends

All that I know is I want you forever
and nothing like this could be wrong
If people on earth think that they know us better than we do
then I’ll live on the moon with you
