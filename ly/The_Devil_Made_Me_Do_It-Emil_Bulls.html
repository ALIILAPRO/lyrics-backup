		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll burn it all down
Oh, yeah

I just knew instinctively 
This would end in Hell for me
But I was born to play with fire
So let the flames burn higher

Tell me what-
Whatcha gonna do when the sirens sing?
Whatcha gonna do in the face of sin?
Whatcha gonna do when temptation tips the scales?
Whatcha gonna do swept up in the game?
Whatcha gonna do to escape the shame?
Whatcha gonna say when you're the one to blame?

(The devil made me do it)
(The devil made me do it)

I swear to God, it's true
The devil made me do it
I am not the one to blame
The devil made me do it
The devil made me do it
He has his hold on me
Don't you see?
He gave me the candy bars
I am not the one to blame
The devil made me do it
The devil made me do it
The devil made (me)
I swear to God

Of all the things that I have lost
My mind is what I miss the most
Shattered by desire
It wanders somewhere in the mire

Tell me what-
Whatcha gonna do when the sirens sing?
Whatcha gonna do in the face of sin?
Whatcha gonna do when temptation tips the scales?
Whatcha gonna do swept up in the game?
Whatcha gonna do to escape the shame?
Whatcha gonna say when you're the one to blame?

(The devil made me do it)
(The devil made me do it)

I swear to God, it's true
The devil made me do it
I am not the one to blame
The devil made me do it
The devil made me do it
He has his hold on me
Don't you see?
He gave me the candy bars
I am not the only one to blame
The devil made me do it
The devil made me do it
The devil made (me)
I swear to God

Yeah, it's the curse of a lifetime
I swear to God
The devil draws my lifeline

(The devil made me do it)
(The devil made me)

It's true
The devil made me do it
I am not the one to blame
The devil made me do it
The devil made me do it
He has his hold on me
Don't you see?
He gave me the candy bars
I am not the only one to blame
The devil made me do it
The devil made me do it
The devil made (me)
I swear to God
The devil made me
