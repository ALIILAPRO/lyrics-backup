		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Turn up the sunshine, turn up, turn up the sunshine
Turn up the sunshine, turn up, turn up the sunshine
Turn up the sunshine, turn up, turn up the sunshine
Turn up the sunshine, turn up, turn up the sunshine

We can make it further, we running and don't look back
It's a light at the end of the tunnel if you stay on track
But I know any minute when your fingers turn it up like snap
So hard to lose like that (hey)

Let's do it all around the world
We gotta turn up the sunshine, we gotta turn up the sunshine
Think about it
All the boys and girls
You gotta turn up the sunshine, you gotta turn up the sunshine
Said it's been a long night, a long night
Waiting for the light, waiting for the light
Let's do it all around the world
We gotta turn up the sunshine, we gotta turn it up
Make it hard to lose like that

You want it, you got it, I'm with it if you do it like that
It's brighter now when the colors of the rainbow flash
We gotta keep it moving, make a change so it don't change back
So hard to lose like that

Let's do it all around the world
We gotta turn up the sunshine, we gotta turn up the sunshine
Think about it
All the boys and girls
You gotta turn up the sunshine, you gotta turn up the sunshine
Said it's been a long night, a long night
Waiting for the light, waiting for the light
Let's do it all around the world
We gotta turn up the sunshine, we gotta turn it up
Make it hard to lose like that

If this weather makes you frown
And some people get you down, remember
Love's like sound, it's better when it's loud
And if there's no song inside
We can bring the light together
Day or night, we're shining from inside

Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the sunshine

Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the sunshine

Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the sunshine

Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the, turn it up
Turn up the sunshine

(Let's do it) all around the world
We gotta turn up the sunshine, we gotta turn up the sunshine
Think about it
All the boys and girls
You gotta turn up the sunshine, you gotta turn up the sunshine
Said it's been a long night, a long night
Waiting for the light, waiting for the light
Let's do it all around the world
We gotta turn up the sunshine, we gotta turn it up
Make it hard to lose like that
