		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Punch my face, im not okay
Wasted
Tie me up as i decay
Wasted
We're not the same as yesterday
Wasted
Speeding car, falling rain
Wasted
Fucked up, she throwing up
Taxi, i call it up
I know, I'm not enough
I be, wasted love
Fucked up, she throwing up
Taxi, i call it up
I know, I'm not enough
I be, wasted love
Fucked up, she throwing up
Taxi, i call it up
I know, I'm not enough
I be, wasted love
I feel dead when you're away
Wasted
We will sink in shallow graves
Wasted
You're my pain, you're my toothache
Wasted
Cut your tongue on paper planes
Wasted
Fucked up, she throwing up
Taxi, i call it up
I know, I'm not enough
I be, wasted love
Fucked up, she throwing up
Taxi, i call it up
I know, I'm not enough
I be, wasted love
Fucked up, she throwing up
Taxi, i call it up
I know, I'm not enough
I be, wasted love
Fucked up, she throwing up
Taxi, i call it up
I know, I'm not enough
I be, wasted love
Fucked up, she throwing up
Taxi, i call it up
I know, I'm not enough
I be, wasted love
