		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've tried to fix my problem
I've tried it on and on
I've tried to feel ok
But everything I know was wrong
And all I want is progress
My mind accepting my thoughts
And all I can do is try to understand we are more than one

Broken down again
I'll try to fix myself until I get replaced

Give me time to mend
I'm using all I have so nothing's left to waste

I need to shut this down and reboot myself
Delete the errors in the way that I have felt
So I'll defrag and I'll decompress
Then I'll finally lay claim to whatever might be left

Broken down again
I'll try to fix myself until I get replaced

Give me time to mend
I'm using all I have so nothing's left to waste

Scared of how it ends
I know what's in your plans but I can still pretend

Watch the rust progress
And just accept the fate that I cannot escape
(I cannot escape)
(I cannot)

Broken down again
I'll try to fix myself until I get replaced

Give me time to mend
I'm using all I have so nothing's left to waste
