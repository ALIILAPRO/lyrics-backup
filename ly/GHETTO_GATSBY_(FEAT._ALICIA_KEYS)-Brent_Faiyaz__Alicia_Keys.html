		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm sorry I've been out of touch
You said I be out of town too much
Flying in the wind, I'm Gatsby (uh)
I'm probably faded when you see me on the TV, I can't help that
I'm just playing cards I was dealt bad
But I got models in the Sprinter
I can't buy you happiness if you ain't got it
Move you to a place, still ain't what you wanted
New new face, still not Lauren London
But you're still a dime if you ask me
Uber XL, love stains in the backseat
Windows down, I would hate to drive past me
I got models in the Sprinter

(Uh)
Sprinter
Count it up
In the Sprinter, Sprinter
It's never enough
I just overpaid for a Maybach
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Told you hit up Baby for the new strap
Yeah, I got it on me, on me
My life is gold and I love the rush
I like your bitch on me (oh, baby), on me
I need it all the time, I don't play 'bout mine

I'm sorry I've been outta touch
You said I be out of town too much
Flying in the wind, I'm Gatsby (uh)
I'm probably faded when you see me on the TV, I can't help that
I'm just playing cards I was dealt bad
But I got models in the Sprinter
I can't buy you happiness if you ain't got it
Move you to a place, still ain't what you wanted
New new face, still not Lauren London
But you're still a dime if you ask me
Uber XL, love stains in the backseat
Windows down, I would hate to drive past me
I got models in the Sprinter

Uh
They said they be balling, why they lying?
Tryna stunt like they be on the pines
Fuck a wine-and-dine, we do dinner now
Read between the lines, we be in and out
Bring the car out front and walk me out
Driver ain't outside my house
I'm staying in tonight, I'm feeling really nice
Good views, good weed, wearing plenty ice
Blew three hundred thousand on me yesterday
Know me, baby, you could check my resume
Been rich, been paid, all this art inspire me
Been fire, can't nobody fire me
Been I, we know who you tryna be
Dumb fly, ain't nobody high as me
Baby, I'm a choosy lover, Isley
Rely on me like pages in your diary
