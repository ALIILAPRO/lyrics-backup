		  Na, na, na, na, ooh
Oh, no, oh, ayy

Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be online, I'll be a-all day
I'll be a-all day
Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be online, I'll be a-all day
I'll be a-all day

Yeah, yeah, yeah
This the type of shit that you been waiting all year for
Back in town for a minute, if you with it (yeah)
Got a lot of time, I just need somewhere to spend it
I just press a button and the top go missing
I kept the slip so you know it's not rented, yeah, oh, oh
What you wanna do?
Worried 'bout your friends, they saw you this afternoon
I been reading your mind
No fair, but you gotta let me know
I'm all ears and I got a lot of room in my whip
If you wanna take it there, I'm on my way

Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be online, I'll be a-all day
I'll be a-all day
Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be online, I'll be a-all day
I'll be a-all day

(Dolla $ign, Dolla $ign)
Drop top the Porsche, put that bitch in sport
Out here in the field, oh yeah (yeah)
I'm already here, yeah
Come outside, looking like a snack
Hurry up, get in, hell yeah (yeah)
Come with me on this mission
Riding down the coast (ooh yeah)
I want that for sure (ooh yeah)
You say, "Play Khalid" (ooh yeah)
I say, "Pass the weed" (ooh yeah)
Pull up to the crib, oh
Said you've never been before
Put you in Provocateur
Girl, I made you mi amor
You said you left your ex, that dude was always gassy
You said before me, you ain't never been this happy
You took an L with him and winning ever since (ever since)
You hit my phone, I'm on my way, I cancel plans, yeah, yeah

Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be online, I'll be a-all day
I'll be a-all day
Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be online, I'll be a-all day
I'll be a-all day

You tryna make a move, tonight I got the time
Tell me what you wanna do
Call the squad if you wanna rendezvous
They gon' push up on it, on it, I only got room for two
From the 'jects on the set, it's a Porsche, not a 'Vette, I confess, I'ma flex
Ayy, show some respect
Get away so we can make sense of your life
You was in park but I just put your shit in drive
Now coast like there's no tomorrow
Moving too fast, I'm hoping to drive slow (yeah)
I don't want you to wonder where I go
Can learn a lot from this and it's something that I know

Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be online, I'll be a-all day
I'll be a-all day
Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be online, I'll be a-all day
I'll be a-all day
