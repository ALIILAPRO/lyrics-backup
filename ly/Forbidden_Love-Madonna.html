		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Love without guilt, love without doubt)
(Love without guilt, love without doubt)
(Love without guilt, love without doubt)
(Rejection, love without doubt)
(Love without guilt, love without doubt)
(Love without guilt, love without doubt)
(Love without guilt, love without doubt)
(Rejection, love without doubt)

(Don't go near the fire, don't go in the dark)
I don't, don't care if it's not right
(Don't give in to your desire, 'cause he's gonna break your heart, let go)
(Let go) To have your arms around me
(Don't go near the fire, don't go in the dark)
I want to feel what it's like
(Don't give in to your desire, 'cause he's gonna break your heart, let go)
(Let go) Take all of you inside of me

In your eyes (in your eyes), forbidden love
In your smile (in your smile), forbidden love
In your kiss (in your kiss), forbidden love
If I had one wish, love would feel like this (love would feel like this)

(Don't go near the fire, don't go in the dark)
I know that you're no good for me
(Don't give in to your desire, 'cause he's gonna break your heart, let go)
(let go) That's why I feel I must confess
(Don't go near the fire, don't go in the dark)
What's wrong is why it feels so right
(Don't give in to your desire, 'cause he's gonna break your heart, let go)
(let go) I want to feel your sweet caress

In your eyes (in your eyes), forbidden love
In your smile (in your smile), forbidden love
In your kiss (in your kiss), forbidden love
If I had one wish, love would feel like this (love would feel like this)

If I only had one wish
Love would always feel like this
Wishing on the stars above
Forbidden love
If I only had one dream
This would be more than it seems
Forbidden love (forbidden love)

(Love without guilt, love without doubt)
(Love without guilt, love without doubt)
Rejection (love without doubt)
Is the greatest aphrodisiac

In your eyes (in your eyes), forbidden love
In your smile (in your smile), forbidden love
In your kiss (in your kiss), forbidden love
If I had one wish, love would feel like this (love would feel like this)
In your eyes (in your eyes), forbidden love
In your smile (in your smile), forbidden love
In your kiss (in your kiss), forbidden love
If I had one wish, love would feel like this (love would feel like this)

(Love without guilt, love without doubt)
Love should always feel like this
Heaven forgive me, never forbid me (love without doubt)
Love should always feel like this (rejection)
Heaven forgive me, never forbid me
Love should always feel like this (rejection)
Heaven forgive me, never forbid me
