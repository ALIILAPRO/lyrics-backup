		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Okay I'm ready

Breathe in, breathe in
Breathe out, shake that ass
Speed up, go fast
Slow down
Breathe in, breathe in
Breathe out, shake that ass
Speed up, go fast
Slow down
4, 4, 4, 4
4, 4, 4, 4
Million, on me, JAY-Z
Count up, fuck nigga, pay, me

Pull up, walk in
Everybody yell like "watch out"
Got it too lit like "pipe down"
No I can't wait need it right now
Get guap, only ones, what she like now
Count it up, from the morning to the night now
That's the reason that niggas wanna fight now
'Cause my diamonds, shine like a lighthouse
Pull up, walk in
Everybody yell like "watch out"

Breathe in, breathe in
Breathe out, shake that ass
Speed up, go fast
Slow down
Breathe in, breathe in
Breathe out, shake that ass
Speed up, go fast
Slow down
4, 4, 4, 4 (ayy, ayy)
4, 4, 4, 4 (ayy, ayy)
Million, on me, JAY-Z
Count up, fuck nigga, pay, me

Woah fuck your bitch, I'm bored
Rockstar that's of course, white girl like Lorde
She don't really get too impressed, Honda Accord
'Long as she get her beauty rest then I'm aboard
Got that girl wet, she need three towels (ayy)
Call my phone like, every day, on speed dial
Hundred thousand, new watch, got like three dials
I don't eat out, hit once, leave out
Breath in, breath in, breath in
Breath out, shake that ass
Speed up, go fast
Slow down
Back it up, rack it up
Told that bitch, back it up
Thirty nails, hammer tucked
So there's no way that you jamming us (no way)

Breath in, breath in
Breath out, shake that ass
Speed up, go fast
Slow down
Breath in, breath in
Breath out, shake that ass
Speed up, go fast
Slow down
4, 4, 4, 4 (ayy, ayy)
4, 4, 4, 4 (ayy, ayy)
Million, on me, JAY-Z
Count up, fuck nigga, pay, me

Pull up, sauce, got the, drip
Foreign, broads, like 'em, mixed
Bull-dog, with a, pit
Bull-dog, with a, grip
4, 4, 4, 4 (ayy, ayy)
4, 4, 4, 4 (ayy, ayy)
Million, on me, JAY-Z
Count up, fuck nigga, pay, me
All these niggas yeah, hate, me
Covered in that water, waist, deep
Pull up in that Lamb', just, me
My niggas pullin' up, eight, deep

Breath in, breath in
Breath out, shake that ass
Speed up, go fast
Slow down
Breath in, breath in
Breath out, shake that ass
Speed up, go fast
Slow down
4, 4, 4, 4 (ayy, ayy)
4, 4, 4, 4 (ayy, ayy)
Million, on me, JAY-Z
Count up, fuck nigga, pay, me

Breath in, breath in
Breath out, shake that ass
Speed up, go fast
Slow down
Breath in, breath in
Breath out, shake that ass
Speed up, go fast
Slow down
4, 4, 4, 4 (ayy, ayy)
4, 4, 4, 4 (ayy, ayy)
Million, on me, JAY-Z
Count up, fuck nigga, pay, me

Pull up, walk in
Everybody yell like "watch out"
Got it too lit like "pipe down"
No I can't wait need it right now
Get guap only ones, what she like now
Count it up from the morning to the night now
That's the reason that niggas wanna fight now
'Cause my diamonds, shine like a lighthouse
Pull up, walk in (ayy)
Everybody yell like "watch out"
Got it too lit like "pipe down"
No I can't wait need it right now
Get guap only ones, what she like now
Count it up from the morning to the night now
That's the reason that niggas wanna fight now
'Cause my diamonds, shine like a lighthouse
