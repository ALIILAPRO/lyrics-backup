		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Catherine de Barra, you've murdered my thinkin'
Gave you my heart, you left the thing stinkin'
I'd shake from your spell if it weren't for my drinkin'
The wind bites more bitter with each light of mornin'

I envy the road, the ground you tread under
I envy the wind, your hair riding over
I envy the pillow your head rests and slumbers
I envy to murderous, envy your lover

'Til the light shines on me
I damn to hell every second you breathe
'Til the light shines on me
I damn to hell every second you breathe

I envy the road, the ground you tread under
I envy the wind, your hair riding over
I envy the pillow your head rests and slumbers
I envy to murderous, envy your lover

'Til the light shines on me
I damn to hell every second you breathe
'Til the light shines on me
I damn to hell every second you breathe

'Til the light shines on me
I damn to hell every second you breathe
'Til the light shines on me

Oh, my Catherine 
Your eyes smilin'
Your mouth singin' 
With time I'd have won you
With wile I'd have won you

Your eyes smilin'
Your mouth singin' 
With time I'd have won you

Oh, my Catherine 
With wile I'd have won you
With wile I'd have won you
