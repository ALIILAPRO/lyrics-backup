		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Record scratch, Steve Miller band
Tattooed necks and tattooed hands
Oh, how don't you drown in a rain storm?
Fresh regrets, vodka sweats
The sun is down and we're bound to get exhausted and so far from the shore

You're never gonna get it
I'm a hazard to myself
I'll break it to you easy
This is hell, this is hell
You're looking and whispering you think I'm someone else
This is hell, yes
Literal hell

We don't have to talk
We don't have to dance
We don't have to smile
We don't have to make friends
It's so nice to meet you
Let's never meet again
We don't have to talk
We don't have to dance
We don't have to dance

Bottles smashed, I raised my hand
How can you all even stand?
And why is there joy in this poison? Oh
Faking smiles and confidence
Driving miles to capture this excitement
I can't take anymore

You're never gonna get it
I'm a hazard to myself
I'll break it to you easy
This is hell, this is hell
You're looking and whispering
You think I'm someone else
This is hell, yes
I am in hell

We don't have to talk
We don't have to dance
We don't have to smile
We don't have to make friends
It's so nice to meet you
Let's never meet again
We don't have to talk
We don't have to dance
We don't have to dance
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

You're never gonna get it
I'm a hazard to myself
I'll break it to you easy
This is hell, this is hell
You're looking and whispering
You think I'm someone else
This is hell, yes
Literal hell

We don't have to talk
We don't have to dance
We don't have to smile
We don't have to make friends
It's so nice to meet you
Let's never meet again
We don't have to talk
We don't have to dance
We don't have to dance

We don't have to talk
We don't have to talk
We don't have to dance
We don't have to talk
Talk, talk
We don't have to dance
We don't have to talk
Talk, talk, talk, talk
Talk, talk, talk, talk
