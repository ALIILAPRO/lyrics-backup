		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fear always surrounds you honey
And what if no one cares or what if they care too much
To shut up
To shut up

Disappointment runs you babe
Yeah you try to be optimistic
But it hurts too much to swallow the truth
No one's listening to you

I wanna see your face in the middle of the night
And wake up every morning with you there by my side
I'd give up on my ambition for a children and a wife

You've seen me cry too many times but i wanna be the guy
In a while crocodile just a glimmer in my eye
I'd give up on my ambition for a children and a wife

You've seen me cry too many times but i wanna be the guy
In a while crocodile just a glimmer in my eye
I'd give up on my ambition for a children and a wife

I overdosed in the belly of the beast
Closed my eyes 'til i barely could see
You were still there talking to me
Carry on oh baby i need it

The holy ghost
I pray that i see him
Even though i barely believe in him
Do you think that he's watching me
Or just a memory haunting me

I wanna see your face in the middle of the night
And wake up every morning with you there by my side
I'd give up on my ambition for a children and a wife

You've seen me cry too many times but i wanna be the guy
In a while crocodile just a glimmer in my eye
I'd give up on my ambition for a children and a wife
