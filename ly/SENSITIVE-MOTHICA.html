		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't go out, I stay in bed
Overthinking in my head
It's too loud, I can't pretend
I'm not breaking down again

I'm anxious, so cautious
I'm easily nauseous
I wish I could care less
But I just care too much

Push me, pull me
Break me, can't let go
My hands around your throat
Won't leave me alone

Now I got my guard up
Can't let go
Don't mean to break the skin
I'm just sensitive

Tattoos all over me
My fears don't behave logically
I'm scared of heights, strangers at night
And socially, I'm terrified

Anxious, so cautious
I hate my subconscious
I wish I could care less
But I care too much

Push me, pull me
Break me, can't let go
My hands around your throat
Won't leave me alone
Now I got my guard up
Can't let go
Don't mean to break the skin
I'm just sensitive

I'm just sensitive, a vulnerable bitch
Deadly but delicate, I'm just sensitive

I'm just sensitive, a vulnerable bitch
Deadly but delicate, I'm just sensitive

Push me, pull me
Break me, can't let go
My hands around your throat
Won't leave me alone

Now I got my guard up
Can't let go
Don't mean to break the skin
I'm just sensitive
