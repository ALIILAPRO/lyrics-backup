		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eh, make me proud, make me proud, oh yeah
She's out here fuckin' around now
Off that tequila, again (oh, woah)
She gon' kill me with her mouth, yeah (oh, yeah)
She makes me dance in the moonlight (moonlight)
She keeps some white in that pouch (yeah, yeah)
She makes me sniff til' the sun's up (yeah)
She's never lettin' me down

That's-that's my mamacita, yeah (mamacita)
I won't ever leave her, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Mama, I might keep her, might keep her
I don't love her, but I need her, yeah
That's my mamacita, yeah
That's my mamacita, yeah
Mama, I might keep her, might keep her
That's my mamacita-macita

(That's my mamacita, yeah)

Listen, she's been creepin' in silence
She keeps the blade, so don't try it (yeah)
Never been caught by the law (oh, no)
But that doesn't mean she's not violent (yeah)
She'll make you burn in the rain
She'll cool you down in the fire
She may not tell you the truth (oh, yeah)
But that doesn't make her a liar

That's-that's my mamacita, yeah, woah (mamacita)
I won't ever leave her, yeah
Mama, I might keep her, might keep her
I don't love her, but I need her, yeah
That's my mamacita, yeah
That's my mamacita, yeah
Mama, I might keep her, might keep her
That's my mamacita-macita

(That's my mamacita, yeah)
Mamacita-macita
Oh (that's my mamacita, yeah)

Kind face with a cruel heart (cruel heart)
She can do it better than a pornstar
She don't carry no more Xan bars (Xan, Xan)
She can work that product on her lonesome (she can work that product)
Look her in the eyes and go insane
She been kicking shit, get out her fucking way (yeah her fucking way)
She can take away all of the pain now, now
But she's the baddest nothin' left to say

Oh-no-no-no-no
Oh-no-no-no-no
That's my mama, mamacita (yeah, yeah)

That's my mamacita, yeah (woah)
I won't ever leave her, yeah
Mama, I might keep her, might keep her
I don't love her, but I need her, yeah
That's my mamacita, yeah
That's my mamacita, yeah
Mama, I might keep her, might keep her
That's my mamacita-macita

(That's my mamacita, yeah)
(That's my mamacita yeah)
