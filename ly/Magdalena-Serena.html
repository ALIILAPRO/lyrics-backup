		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll play this game you do
My lipstick seduced you
I also play it too
Aah, aah

Magdalena
A kiss at the sunset on Senna
You like what you see?
I`m Serena
A lover who killed Riviera
Uh, Magdalena!

Magdalena
Magdalena
Magdalena
A lover who killed Riviera
Uh, Magdalena!

Magdalena
Magdalena
A lover who killed Riviera
Uh, Magdalena!

Magdalena
A lover who killed Riviera
Magdalena

So hard to recognize
I`m stuck on you
Babe, when I close my eyes 
I dance with you

I kissed the solitude
I tasted the silence too
Can someone bring it back?
Can someone bring you back?

I'll play this game you do
My lipstick seduced you
I also play it too
Aah, aah

Magdalena
A kiss at the sunset on Senna
You like what you see?
I`m Serena
A lover who killed Riviera
Uh Magdalena!

Mgadalena!
Magdalena
A lover who killed Riviera
Uh Magdalena!

I can 't forget your eyes
I know them good
They never tell me lies
But sometimes they should

You've feed a lonely soul
I love this game you do
Can someone bring it up?
Can someone bring it back?

Magdalena
A kiss at the sunset on Senna
You like what you see?
I`m Serena
A lover who killed Riviera
Uh Magdalena!

Magdalena!
Magdalena
A lover who killed Riviera
Uh Magdalena!

I'll play this game you do
My lipstick seduced you
I also play it too
Aah, aah
