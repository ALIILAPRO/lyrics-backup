		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

She's a friend of mine, and an apple pie
And a sharpshooter, I'm in overtime like
Hey sharpshooter, I feel like I'm intrudin'
She's a friend of mine, and an alibi
In the getaway car, in overdrive like
This sharpshooter, I like the way you move us

She's a real live wire, what's she talking about?
I think I love her
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So don't, don't come back looking for me, me
No, you don't
How come they lookin' for you, you, you?

I just wanna be here
Walking like an animal
I just wanna teach her a thing or two
Let's lose control and alt delete
And one, two, three, four, five
I don't wanna fight, butterflies
Out of sight, out of my mind

I just wanna taste your Chapstick
I just wanna taste your-
I just, I just, I just wanna taste your Chapstick
I just wanna taste your-
I just, I just, I just wanna-
Dance, baby
I just wanna cry lately

I saw her face from across the room
Eyes looking at me, looking at you like
Hey, cherry blossom, yeah, yeah, what's your problem?
I don't want your leather jacket, I just wanna taste your Chapstick
Hey sharpshooter, what, what are we doing?

She's a real wildfire and she's hard to contain
She's going all the way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She's a real live wire, what's she talking about?
I think I love her

(I just, I just, I just wanna) I just wanna be here
Walking like an animal
I just wanna teach her a thing or two
Let's lose control and alt delete
And one, two, three, four, five
I don't wanna fight, butterflies
Out of sight, out of my mind

I just wanna taste your Chapstick
I just wanna taste your-
I just, I just, I just wanna taste your Chapstick
I just wanna taste your Chapstick

(I just, I just, I just wanna) I just wanna be here
Walking like an animal
I just wanna teach her a thing or two
Let's lose control and alt delete
And one, two, three, four, five
I don't wanna fight, butterflies
Out of sight, out of my mind (taste your Chapstick)

I just wanna dance, baby
I just wanna cry lately
