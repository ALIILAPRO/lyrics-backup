		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's go play in the underground
Heard you brought new friends around
So how about we kill the light?
Please don't make me lose my mind 

Cause last time 
Took us awhile to run away from our crime
It's about time we show them who's the bad guy
I'm gonna seek
So you better go hide
Don't mind the voices, they only know lies
Don't ever forget I'm a
Psycho 

Bow down
Shit's about to go down down 
Bow down
Shit's about to go down down
Bow down
Shit's about to go down down 
Bow down
Shit's about to go 

Can't find a way 
To make you feel the way
I feel about the day I'll fade
Today's the day 
Tomorrow ain't the day you need
To praise 
So help me find a way 
To make you feel the way 
I feel bout this whole phase
Drop the crown
Appease the crowd
And take a bow
Before we go down like

Last time 
Took us awhile to figure out those sweet lies
It's about time we show them how to fly high
I know I'm a mess 
And I need to confess 
I don't have a reason to be so depressed
How could you forget I'm a
Psycho 

Bow down
Shit's about to go down down 
Bow down
Shit's about to go down down
Bow down
Shit's about to go down down 
Bow down

Bow down
Shit's about to go down down 
Bow down
Shit's about to go down down 
Bow down
Shit's about to go down down 
Bow down

Can we play for one last time 
Let's watch how our days go by
I know you're probably scared of me
If I were you I would agree
