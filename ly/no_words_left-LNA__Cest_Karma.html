		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have no words left
There are no words left
Used up air sat in my flat for the last week
No buzz
Not even the phone cares to tell something new
Is this what it’s gonna be like?
Will I wear myself out like the shirt
That I’ve owned since I was sixteen
There are holes near the seams
Where I bit my sleeve in fear that there was nothing left for me here
I had my mind set but now
The nights that I’ll always remember turn into dates that I always forget
The days have stretched out
To an infinite nothingness
I should make some space for the unknown
At least that's what my therapist says
(And I know she's always right so it wouldn't hurt to listen I guess)
Hey
I take a plane to ride away
That makes you cry so I get hurt
I wanna travel I wanna see the ocean again
I still have thoughts to put down, there's so much that I haven't said yet
I am aware that all of this sounds like a copy and paste quote from the internet
But I won't let anyone tell me how I'm not trying my best
I am still trying my best
Aren’t we all trying
