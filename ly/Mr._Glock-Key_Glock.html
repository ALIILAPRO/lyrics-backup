		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They got me fucked up

Ayy I'm right back on they ass, yeah
They done made me mad, uh
I been keeping calm
Constantly keep making cash, yeah
I been getting bag, after bag, after bag, yeah
Presidential shit, I ride my Maybach matte black, yeah
Call me Mr. Glock, shooters in the front and back, yeah
Yeah I'm on my Memphis shit
These bitches coming in a pack, uh
These niggas pussy, cash straight cow, cat in hat, yeah 
Baby I'm a player and my daddy was a mack, yeah, huh, yeah
 
And that's a motherfucking fact 
Never leave the house without my motherfucking strap
I was fourteen years old with that motherfucking sack
I don't fuck with none of these rappers, they know that
 
Ayy I'm right back on they ass, yeah
They done made me mad, uh
I been keeping calm
Constantly keep making cash, yeah
I been getting bag, after bag, after bag, yeah
Presidential shit, I ride my Maybach matte black, yeah
Call me Mr. Glock, shooters in the front and back, yeah
Yeah I'm on my Memphis shit
These bitches coming in a pack, uh
These niggas pussy, cash straight cow, cat in hat, yeah 
Baby I'm a player and my daddy was a mack, yeah
 
Smoking mack with my unc', he call it Thrax, uh
Yeah I was thirteen sneaking, geeking, drinking Actavis
A couple niggas play with us
We turned that ass to dust
Don't let them gas you up
Heart cold, no mask or gloves, nigga, uh
Hit yo ass up with some slugs
I run with hustlers and thugs
I got this shit out the mud, nigga
Ayy who want smoke? I got bud
Strapped in the church and the club
What the fuck you niggas thought this was?
 
Ayy I'm right back on they ass, yeah
They done made me mad, uh
I been keeping calm
Constantly keep making cash, yeah
I been getting bag, after bag, after bag, yeah
Presidential shit, I ride my Maybach matte black, yeah
Call me Mr. Glock, shooters in the front and back, yeah
Yeah I'm on my Memphis shit
These bitches coming in a pack, uh
These niggas pussy, cash straight cow, cat in hat, yeah 
Baby I'm a player and my daddy was a mack

I love you Mr. Glock!
I love-I love you too
