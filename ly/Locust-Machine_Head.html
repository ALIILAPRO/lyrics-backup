		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sweet caress grazes my skin
It's loveless, these hooks sink in
Behind an angel's disguise, an insect preys
Mandibles cut like a knife, the reckoning

Forming clouds, their shadow shrouds
Louder the tattered wings they sound
Descending down

Down they come, the swarm of locusts
Skies above converge to choke us
Feast of souls consume the harvest
Young and old, suffer unto the locust

Surrender, these veins are bled
Devoured, nothing sacred
Strings pull the marionettes
See how they dance upon the winds that beget our pestilence

Forming clouds, their shadow shrouds
Louder the tattered wings they sound
Descending down

Down they come, the swarm of locusts
Skies above converge to choke us
Feast of souls consume the harvest
Young and old, suffer unto the locust

Bleeding from my eyes, this plague is sent to erase us
Bleeding from inside, these vermin can't infiltrate us

Faith appears, and holds a candle
Hark, the angels sing

Forming clouds, their shadow shrouds
Louder the tattered wings they sound

Tear the veil, the lies derail
Purity ever will prevail
Trumpets sound the shattered crown
Halos of truth now they surround
The charade comes down

Down they come, the swarm of locusts
Skies above converge to choke us
Feast of souls consume the harvest
Young and old, (suffer unto the locust)

Down they come, the swarm of locusts
Skies above converge to choke us
Feast of souls consume the harvest
Young and old, suffer unto the locust
