		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You think you're funny, right?
Calling me drunk when it's too late at night
Telling me truths that you know all are lies
Yeah, you think you're funny, right? (What?)
You think you're super sly
Flirting with them but telling me you're mine
Buildin' me up, but buttercup, you lied
Now I'm gonna ruin your life

'Cause I've gotten tired of the games that you play
When you tell me you love me then you throw me away
So cry me a river till you drown in the lake
'Cause you may think you're winning but checkmate
Yeah, you may think you're winning but checkmate

Now this is getting fun
I saw you kissing someone else's tongue
You said that I'm the only one you love
Baby, this is getting fun
I'll let you think you won
Date in the park, I'll play it super dumb
Holding your hand, but in the other one
I'm holding a loaded gun
Yeah, baby, you should really run

'Cause I've gotten tired of the games that you play
When you tell me you love me then you throw me away
So cry me a river till you drown in the lake
'Cause you may think you're winning but checkmate
Yeah, you may think you're winning but check-

And I'ma get you gone
Can't play me like your pawn
Set fire to your lawn
Just like you did to my heart
And I'ma wreck your car (And I'ma wreck your car)
And max your credit card (And max your credit card)
A lover on the large (A lover on the large)
You're gonna wish you never harmed me

'Cause I've gotten tired of the games that you play
When you tell me you love me then you throw me away
So cry me a river till you drown in the lake
'Cause you may think you're winning but checkmate

And you did some damage so I'm making you pay
And no one's ever gonna love you anyways
'Cause you're just a narcissist who's totally fake
Yeah, you may think you're winning this heartbreak
But you aren't gonna win it, 'cause checkmate
