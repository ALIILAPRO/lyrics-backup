		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's her hair and her eyes today 
That just simply take me away 
And the feeling that I'm falling further in love 
Makes me shiver but in a good way
All the times I have sat and stared 
As she thoughtfully thumbs through her hair
And she purses her lips, bats her eyes as she plays
With me sitting there slack-jawed and nothing to say 

'Cause I love her with all that I am 
And my voice shakes along with my hands 
'Cause she's all that I see and she's all that I need
And I'm out of my league once again 

It's a master for melody when she calls out my name to me
As the world spins around her she laughs, rolls her eyes 
And I feel like I'm falling but it's no surprise 

'Cause I love her with all that I am 
And my voice shakes along with my hands 
'Cause it's frightening to be swimming in this strange sea 
But I'd rather be here than on land 
Yes, she's all that I see and she's all that I need 
And I'm out of my league once again

It's her hair and her eyes today 
That just simply take me away 
And the feeling that I'm falling further in love 
Makes me shiver but in a good way
All the times I have sat and stared 
As she thoughtfully thumbs through her hair
And she purses her lips, bats her eyes as she plays
With me sitting there slack-jawed and nothing to say 

'Cause I love her with all that I am 
And my voice shakes along with my hands 
'Cause it's frightening to be swimming in this strange sea 
But I'd rather be here than on land 
Yes, she's all that I see and she's all that I need 
And I'm out of my league once again
