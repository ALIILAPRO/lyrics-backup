		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They told me wait my turn, but I need it right now
Everything that I got, I earned, you decide to come around
Everything that I built, you watched it fall down
Used to be cool with a lil' but I need it all now

Can't complain, this life I live amazing
Pave the way, the swag, they tried to take it
Got something to say, I told her she could save it
You running games, I told you I wasn't playing
I already told you before, you're more than replaceable, I don't need you
Basic ho, see-through, don't even know why I see you
You're not the one, afraid I have to leave you
Movie life I live, you only got the preview

I couldn't fuck with that basic ho, so I switched out for a bad bitch
She wanna see what I'm making dough, so I iced out the Patek
I really cannot date the ho 'cause she got too much baggage
Said she got high expectations, but I was more than she imagined
I be happy when I'm on the road, but she tell me come home 'cause she mad at me
And they hate 'cause I got that bag on me, they like how much do you make?
I bet I 10x your salary, runnin' racks up, you run off calories
Couldn't care less if they mad at me, mama said she proud of me

They told me wait my turn, but I need it right now
Everything that I got, I earned, you decide to come around
Everything that I built, you watched it fall down
Used to be cool with a lil' but I need it all now

Can't complain, this life I live amazing
Pave the way, the swag, they tried to take it
Got something to say, I told her she could save it
You running games, I told you I wasn't playing
I already told you before, you're more than replaceable, I don't need you
Basic ho, see-through, don't even know why I see you
You're not the one, afraid I have to leave you
Movie life I live, you only got the preview
