		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put me on the cover, oh, oh, oh
Play me on the radio, oh, oh, oh
Put me on the cover, oh, oh, oh
Play me on the radio, radio

Have you ever met someone made you feel like a no one?
When you look in the mirror, all you want is to change
I was in it for too long, how could I be so wrong?
Thinkin' I don't deserve it, I was so nervous, the lights on the stage

But now it's all over

Put me on the cover, play me on the radio
Wanna show my love that he shouldn't have let me go
Finding pretty boys to kiss in all my videos
I don't want him back but I still want him to know

That, ooh, for all those nights I cried
There's no pain left to hide
This heart is only mine

Have you ever been lucky? Dressed up looking money?
Bumped into your ex, they sent you a text, like "How are you doing?"
It's too late for flirtin', for all of the hurtin'
And now that you're earnin' what you deserve it feels like revenge

'Cause now it's all over

Put me on the cover, play me on the radio
Wanna show my love that he shouldn't have let me go
Finding pretty boys to kiss in all my videos
I don't want him back but I still want him to know

That, ooh, for all those nights I cried
There's no pain left to hide
This heart is only mine

Da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da

And I don't want you to forget
I'll sing about the day we met
But you're not over me yet
Just put me

Put me on the cover, play me on the radio
Wanna show my love that he shouldn't have let me go
Finding pretty boys to kiss in all my videos
I don't want him back but I still want him to know

That, ooh, for all those nights I cried
There's no pain left to hide
This heart is only mine

Play me on the radio, radio
