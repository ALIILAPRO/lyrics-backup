		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You really messed up everything
You really messed up everything
But you can take it all back again
Strike up what's in the box
Why should I be good if you're not?

This is a foul tasting medicine
A foul tasting medicine
To be trapped in your full stop
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (all the good times)
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (all the good times)
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (all the good times)
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (all the good times)

All the good times
All the good times
All the good times
All the good times
All the good times
Take me back again
Take me back
Take me back again
Oh
You really me
Really mess
Ah
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up this time (ah)
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up this time (ah)
