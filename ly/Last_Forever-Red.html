		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lost and alone
Slipping away
Traces of Your soul
Cutting through my mind

You locked me up inside
It's killing me
I hoped that I could find You

Here in my arms with me
In my arms I'm lost inside the dream
I'm searching for a love that will last forever
I know You're a part of me
I'm calling out Your name
Will this last forever, forever? (Forever, forever)

My heart explodes
This pain is all I feel
Am I bending or breaking?
I just want something that's real

You locked me up inside
It's killing me
I hope that I could find You

Lost inside this dream
I'm searching for a love that will last forever
I know You're a part of me
I'm calling out Your name
Will this last forever, forever?

Calling out, calling out Your name
Calling out, calling out Your name
Calling out, calling out Your name
Calling out, calling out Your name
Calling out, calling out Your name (calling out Your name)
Calling out, calling out Your name
Calling out, calling out Your name (I'm calling out Your name)
Calling out, calling out Your name
Calling out, calling out Your name (I'm calling out Your name)
Calling out, calling out Your name 

Lost inside this dream
I'm searching for a love that will last forever
I know You're a part of me
I'm calling out Your name
Will this last forever, forever?

Calling out Your name
Calling out Your name
