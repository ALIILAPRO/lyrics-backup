		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got the weight of the world on my back
It made me slip right through the cracks
It caused a chain reaction
Now I escape to a world here with you
Up is down, red is blue
We see through all the distraction

Maybe I should join a cult
At least they'll tell me it's not my fault
That the world's a fucking circus
That my life feels fucking worthless
Maybe I should join a cult
At least they'll tell me it's not my fault
When it all comes crashing down
We'll see who's laughing now
Now

Maybe you should join a circus
So you'll see just what your worth is
In your palace of lost battles
How could you be so judgmental?
Maybe it's you, maybe it's me
How you won't accept no more apologies
I don't want to understand you
'Cause I know you will stand on me

Maybe I should join a cult
At least they'll tell me it's not my fault
That the world's a fucking circus
That my life feels fucking worthless
Maybe I should join a cult
At least they'll tell me it's not my fault
When it all comes crashing down
We'll see who's laughing now
Now

Maybe it's not a conspiracy
And it's nothing but coincidence
Maybe there's some possibility
That I'm not insignificant
Maybe I've been gettin' brainwashed
But here I get to take off
The face I hide behind

Maybe I should join a cult
At least they'll tell me it's not my fault
That the world's a fucking circus
That my life feels fucking worthless
Maybe I should join a cult
At least they'll tell me it's not my fault
When it all comes crashing down
We'll see who's laughing now
Now
Now
