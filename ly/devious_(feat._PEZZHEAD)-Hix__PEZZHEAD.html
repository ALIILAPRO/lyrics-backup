		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Acting so oblivious
Treat me like i'm hideous
Treat me like you hate me some more
And I thought we were serious?
I might hit a devious lick right at your front door
Acting so oblivious
Treat me like i'm hideous
Treat me like you hate me some more
And I thought we were serious?
I might hit a devious lick right at your front door
Winter lingers like an oil spill
Wrongons live like there is nothing real
The devil plays the mice because
A coward dwells behind the fur
Bite your tongue
You know that you write the truth fucking rough
(Ay, ay) Have you had your drugs?
Do you see the colour fading from the grass?
(Ay, uh) Bite your tongue
You know that you write the truth fucking rough
Have you had your drugs?
Do you see the colour fading from the grass?
(I'm gonna kill myself and it's all your fault)
Acting so oblivious
Treat me like i'm hideous
Treat me like you hate me some more
And I thought we were serious?
I might hit a devious lick right at your front door
Acting so oblivious
Treat me like i'm hideous
Treat me like you hate me some more
And I thought we were serious?
I might hit a devious lick right at your front door
