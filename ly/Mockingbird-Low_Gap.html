		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You ain't nothing mockingbird
You say nice things
But you steal the words
Out of someone else's lip
Do you mean
The things you say
Do you really feel that way
Or would you say 'em to any guy that you meet

Mockingbird mockingbird
Do you really mean the words
You've been singing to me this whole time
Mockingbird Mockingbird
How many of your pretty words
Are just pretty little lies

Are you really interested in me
Or do you just want my company
So you don't have to sleep alone at night
Cause if you aren't
Please tell me soon
I don't want to waste another moon
Pining on somebody that don't care

Mockingbird mockingbird
Do you really mean the words
You've been singing to me this whole time
Mockingbird Mockingbird
How many of your pretty words
Are just pretty little lies

Mockingbird mockingbird
Do you really mean the words
You've been singing to me this whole time
Mockingbird Mockingbird
How many of your pretty words
Are just pretty little lies
