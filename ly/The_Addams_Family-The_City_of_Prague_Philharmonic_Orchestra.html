		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They're creepy and they're kooky
Mysterious and spooky
They're all together ooky
The Addams family

Their house is a museum
When people come to see 'em
They really are a scream
The Addams family

Neat
Sweet
Petite

So get a witch's shawl on
A broomstick you can crawl on
We're gonna play a call on
The Addams family

They're creepy and they're kooky
Mysterious and spooky
They're all together ooky
The Addams family

Their house is a museum
When people come to see 'em
They really are a scream
The Addams family

Neat
Sweet
Petite

So get a witch's shawl on
A broomstick you can crawl on
We're gonna play a call on
The Addams family
