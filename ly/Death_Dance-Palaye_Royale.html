		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never thought I'd be so mean, never thought I'd be alone at nineteen
But all the thoughts are in my head again, head again
All these thoughts are running through my brain and out the door
We've become insane, we've been numbing the pain
But you can see all the things I'm going through
We've become insane, we've been numbing the pain
But you can see all the shit I'm going through

No no no, no no no, I hide my pain inside
No no no, no no no, I bleed to feel alive
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, I am dead inside
No no no, makes it hard to survive

No, you can't find my reasons, no, you can't find my pain
We all got lost in Jesus, but he can't take away my pain
I'm looking for something more
So take me away, from out the door
Now I'm looking for you outside to say

No no, no no no, I hide my pain inside
No no, no no no, I bleed to feel alive
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, I am dead inside
No no no

No, I can't take it
All of these memories
I can't fake it
I'm trying but I am dying
I just want to
Oh, just be myself
I have tried to, but now I'm someone else

No no, no no no, so please be kind
No no, no no, I'm losing my mind
No no,no no, I'm really not fine
Oh no, I'm really not fine

We live in an age where sex and whores are gods
We live in an age where all our bodies are flawed
We live in an age where sex and whores are gods
We live in an age
We live in an age
We live in an age where sex and whores are gods
We live in an age where all our bodies are flawed
We live in an age where all our bodies are flawed
Are flawed, no

No I can't take it
All of these memories
I can't fake it
I'm trying to fight it, but I am dying
I just want to
Oh, just be myself
I have tried to, but now I'm someone else
