		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a dog in this True, baby
Can we call this here a truce, baby?
And you know I got the juice, baby
And you see me in this coupe, baby
You say you off at 2, baby
What you gon' let me do baby?
I'm smokin' on this took, baby
There is no one like you, baby
My baby is the dope

I bet you ain't smoking on the strongest shit right now
I bet you smoking blow can't tell me what you feel right now
I bet you smoking reggie acting like it's kill right now
I just flamed up the loud so I can't even hear right now
My shorties come through sparking out the cut right here right now
We see you holding on the loud weed like it's some fire
You trying to smoke what I smoke, you take a hit and die
I love this shit so much I might just take a hit then cry
I'll be done with this blunt in 4, take your bitch in 5
Truck on 26's, make me skip to 9
My motherfuckin' riches, make me skip the line
I swear that the dope the only thing that get me high

I'm a dog in this True, baby
Can we call this here a truce, baby?
And you know I got the juice, baby
And you see me in this coupe, baby
You say you off at 2, baby
What you gon' let me do baby?
I'm smokin' on this took, baby
There is no one like you, baby
My baby is the dope

I got pints on pints, blunts on blunts
I got swag on swag, stunts on stunts
Troopers pulled us over, we smelled like blunts
I was full off dope, that's my lunch
You need to see this big ass blunt that I'm smokin' on
This all for me partner
You should see this big ass blunt that I'm chokin' on
I'ma need a doctor
I just flamed it up, ain't no changing up
You see how high I am, then why you bring it up?
You know what's in my cup, my cup filled with mud
To those who I influence, just say no to drugs

I'm a dog in this True, baby
Can we call this here a truce, baby?
And you know I got the juice, baby
And you see me in this coupe, baby
You say you off at 2, baby
What you gon' let me do baby?
I'm smokin' on this took, baby
There is no one like you, baby
My baby is the dope
