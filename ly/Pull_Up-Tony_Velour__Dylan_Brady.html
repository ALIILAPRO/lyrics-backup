		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pull up
Late night
Please don't wait up for me
I'll be gone until the morning
Say it's goin' down
On sight
I know that you lonely
And these drugs got me wide open baby
Pull up
Late night
Please don't wait up for me
I'll be gone until the morning
Say it's goin' down
On sight
I know that you lonely
And these drugs got me wide open baby

Uh scratch that
Tellin' me ya heart been cracked
Know its hard to throw away the past
But good things don't hardly last
Through the bad
Can't help but laugh
You the first but
I don't think the last
Time keeps on goin' fast
And I don't know if I can keep track
And that's to bad
Cuz we both know
We ain't finna get none back
I been on my dolo
Stuck off in a bag, aye
You been stuck on mad
Please don't think I went out my way
Just to make you sad

Pull up
Late night
Please don't wait up for me
I'll be gone until the morning
Say it's goin' down
On sight
I know that you lonely
And these drugs got me wide open baby
Pull up
Late night
Please don't wait up for me
I'll be gone until the morning
Say it's goin' down
On sight
I know that you lonely
And these drugs got me wide open baby
