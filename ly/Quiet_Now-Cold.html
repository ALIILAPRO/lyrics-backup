		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On the day you went away from me 
   I remember all the little things 
   When you held my hand and said I'll be ok 
   I can still feel you in everything 
   every movie , every song they play, every time i hear your name I pray 
   the rain
 
   Its a little too quiet now 
   And it's harder everyday 
   I'll stand in the storm till the world is gone to keep you in my dreams 
   It's a little too quiet now 
   And no time can heal this pain 
   I'll stand up to god like I'm super man to keep you close to me 
   It's a little too quiet

   I can still feel you in everything, every night brings back the memories 
   when I close my eyes you wave goodbye to me
