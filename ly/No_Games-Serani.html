		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, girl, I love you
Oh, ayy, oh
It's, it's, it's Serani
Just in case you never know
Just in case you never know, oh, oh
Ayy, oh

Love you, girl
Do you feel the same?
I don't wanna play games
No games, ohh-oh
You're the only one that can out my flame
Baby, just play it straight, straight
No games, ohh-oh

We've been together six months now (the most perfect days)
You pushed for us to exchange vows (made me change my ways)
I gave my life over to you
Then you turned around
After all that we've been through
I was your rebound

Girl, I want you (all time)
I'll forever love you (you're mine)
I'm not mad even though I'm sad ('cause you)
Should give me one more chance

Love you, girl
Do you feel the same?
I don't wanna play games
No games, ohh-oh
You're the only one that can out my flame
Baby, just play it straight, straight
No games, ohh-oh

Is this the life you really want? (Constant delusion)
Your time with me was very fun (there's no illusion)
But I don't know you anymore
When you walked outside that door
You left your happiness

But, girl, I want you (all time)
I'll forever love you (you're mine)
I'm not mad even though I'm sad ('cause you)
Should give me one more chance

Love you, girl
Do you feel the same?
I don't wanna play games
No games, ohh-oh
You're the only one that can out my flame
Baby, just play it straight, straight
No games, ohh-oh

'Cause you're my one and only
I'm still here feeling lonely
Feeling wasted
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ohh-oh
You're my sunshine
I need you back one time
Time, time, ohh-oh

Love you, girl
Do you feel the same?
I don't wanna play games
No games, ohh-oh
You're the only one that can out my flame
Baby, just play it straight, straight
No games, ohh-oh
