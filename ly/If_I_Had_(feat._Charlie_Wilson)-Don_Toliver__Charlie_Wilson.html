		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I had your love in my hand, keep it forever
If I had your love in my hand, keep it forever

I'm tired baby, I'm tired baby
Where I'm basically been waiting for you (no, no, no)
Where I'm basically here waiting up for you (no, no, no)(what'd you do baby?)
Where I'm basically here waiting up for you (what'd you do baby?)
Where I'm basically here waiting for you 

If I had your love in my hand
Keep it forever
If I had your love in my hand
Keep it forever

Know what I'd do
If I had you in my hand
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
What would I do if I had you in my arms (if I had)
If I had you (your love)
Your beautiful
If I had you in my arms
Come get with me baby (if I had)

If I had your love in my arms 
Keep it for us (I love you baby, but I need you right now baby, I need you right now baby)
If I had your love in my hand 
Keep it for us (wanna go with me right now baby?)
Your beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful beautiful, love me baby

Haha, get your ass out of here child
You already really got it
