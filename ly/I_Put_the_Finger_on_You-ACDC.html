		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, yeah

I put the finger on you, yeah
My hands all out of control
Yes, I, I can't stop it gettin' down on you
It's moving on its own accord (yes)
I got fire in my fingertips
Radiating onto you
I can't control it, can't even hold it
It's knocking on your door and you know what it's for

I put the finger right on you
I put the finger right on you
You put your finger on me too
And I put the finger, I put the finger
Yeah, I put the finger, I put the finger

I put the finger on you for sure
It's the key to unlocking your door
Don't you know I've broken through your security
My hands ain't tied no more (you better watch out)
I can't control it, can't even hold it
Sneaking up for your pleasure
You can feel it on your ankle, feel it on your knee
Feel it on your thigh, can you feel me?

I put the finger right on you
I put the finger right on you
You put your finger on me too
And I put the finger, I put the finger
I put the finger
I put the finger on you

I can't control it, can't even hold it
Sneaking up for your pleasure
You can feel it on your ankle, feel it on your knee
Feel it on your thigh, can you feel me?

Put it right on you
Put it right on you
I'll do it if you want me to
Come on put it, come on put it

I put the finger on you
I put the finger on you
I put the finger on you
I put the finger on you
I put the finger on you
I put the finger on you (put the finger)
I put the finger on you
I put the finger on you

I put the finger on you
Gonna hit the spot
I put the finger right on 
You
