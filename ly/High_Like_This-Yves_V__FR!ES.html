		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Why you just call when you high like this
And treat me like this
Don't fuck me like I need it baby)

Now you act like I need it
Those feelings I'm trying to fight
I know that you playing me right
Now you act like I want it
But true love is so hard to find
I know that you mess with my mind

Now you act like I need it
Those feelings I'm trying to fight
I know that you playing me right
Now you act like I want it
But true love is so hard to find
I know that you mess with my mind

Why you just call when you high like this
And treat me like this
Don't fuck me like I need it baby
Why you just call when you high like this
And treat me like this
Don't fuck me like I need it baby

Why you just call when you high like this
And treat me like this
Don't fuck me like I need it baby
Why you just call when you high like this
And treat me like this
Don't fuck me like I need it baby

(Why you just call when you high like this
High like this)
Don't fuck me like I need it baby
(Why you just call when you high like this
High like this)

Now you act like I need it
Those feelings I'm trying to fight
I know that you playing me right
Now you act like I want it
But true love is so hard to find
I know that you mess with my mind

Now you act like I need it
Those feelings I'm trying to fight
I know that you playing me right
Now you act like I want it
But true love is so hard to find
I know that you mess with my mind

Why you just call when you high like this
And treat me like this
Don't fuck me like I need it baby
Why you just call when you high like this
And treat me like this
Don't fuck me like I need it baby

Why you just call when you high like this
And treat me like this
Don't fuck me like I need it baby
Why you just call when you high like this
And treat me like this
Don't fuck me like I need it baby

(Why you just call when you high like this
High like this)
Don't fuck me like I need it baby
(Why you just call when you high like this
High like this)
Don't fuck me like I need it baby
(Why you just call when you high like this?)
