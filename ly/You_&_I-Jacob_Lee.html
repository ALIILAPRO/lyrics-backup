		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why is it easier to hate?
Why is everyone that I adore passing away? 
Every night I stare up at the sun
These days & nights are blending into one

How do I determine who to love?
When trust is just a bet you place before you've seen enough
I have no faith, no, I'm not the same as I once was

I have to say I envy your patience, waiting for the pain to pass
I stumble on my self-sabotage every time I take a step too far

I can feel my hearts grown cold, so I guess that inner flame is out for us
Even when I'm on my own, I can hear you telling me I'm not enough
The only thing I feel
Was never really real
You and I
You and I
Even though I'm feeling lost, it's a better place to be than where I was

Don't you even think of giving up
I'm talking to myself like I am someone I can trust
Even though it's hard to be alone
It's better than the avenue I chose

'Cause there is no way
I can explain
Every choice
That I have made
and I don't know if there's
Someone to blame
For what we both
Never became

I can feel my hearts grown cold, so I guess that inner flame is out for us
Even when I'm on my own, I can hear you telling me I'm not enough
The only thing I feel
Was never really real
You and I
You and I
Even though I'm feeling lost, it's a better place to be than where I was

'Cause I just wanna feel, I just wanna feel loved, loved
'Cause I just wanna feel, I just wanna feel loved, loved
'Cause I just wanna feel, I just wanna feel loved

I can feel my hearts grown cold, so I guess that inner flame is out for us
Even when I'm on my own, I can hear you telling me I'm not enough
The only thing I feel
Was never really real
You and I
You and I
Even though I'm feeling lost, it's a better place to be than where I was
