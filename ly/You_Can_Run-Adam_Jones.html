		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who's that knocking at your door?
You've got lots to answer for
Who's that sleeping in your bed?
Ah

Cross your heart and hope to die
Swear that you won't tell no lie
Cross your heart and hope to die
Ah

Every time you fall asleep
Pray the Lord your soul to keep
You got problems now, my friend
Ah

You can run
You can run
You can run 
I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind

Truth gonna come out, someday
It's gonna wipe that smile right off your face
But you can run
You can run
You can run

You saw things that shook your core
Things you've never seen before
Could've walked away instead
Ah

Now you got no one you can trust
Thinking you sold your soul unjust
Point your finger and deny
Ah

You can run
You can run
You can run 
I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind

Truth gonna come out, someday
It's gonna wipe that smile right off your face
But you can run
You can run
You can run

You can run
You can run
You can run 
I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind

Truth gonna come out, someday
It's gonna wipe that smile right off your face
But you can run
You can run
You can run
