		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Modulistic terror
A vast sadistic feast
The only way to exit
Is going piece by piece
 
You have no choice of life or death
My face you will not see
I'll rip your flesh 'till there's no breath
Dismembered destiny
 
As soon as life has left your corpse
I'll make you part of me
No emotion
Death is all I see
 
Modulistic terror
A vast sadistic feast
The only way to exit
Is going piece by piece
 
Bones and blood lie on the ground
Rotten limbs lie dead
Decapitated bodies found
On my wall, your head!
 
On your trail I close the gap
One more life that soon won't be
No emotion
Your flesh is all I need
 
I'll send you to your maker
Confront the God you seek
A flash of red upon his [sings "your"] chest
Safety out of reach
 
[You have no choice of life or death
 My face you will not see
 I'll rip your flesh 'till there's no breath
 Dismembered destiny]

[Modulistic terror
 A vast sadistic feast
 There's only one way out of here
 Piece by piece]
