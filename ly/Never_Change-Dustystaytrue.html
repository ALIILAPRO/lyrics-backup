		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've just been so Lonely Lonely Lonely lonely
I've been so damn lonely
These niggas acting
Phony phony phony phony
Actin so damn phony
Just get out my way
Swerving thru lanes I been drifting away
And
I can't complain swear that I'll be okay
We are not the same no I'm never gon change Cha a a ange
I just keep going
Though I've been so broken
These niggas done changed yet they knocking my flows in
All smiles can't tell that my heart just been frozen
Stay low low low key, Nah don't cause kno commotion
That's just for promotion
Raw as my emotion
These songs that I'm composing
Stay fire
That's cus I'm chosen
And I don't do the boastin
But all she do is post em
She like me cause I'm open and I ain't off the potion
But I might be, crispy like a white tee
Meditated like tai Chi
Keep a check like Nike
Can't find a nigga that's like me
But I see
Fuck niggas that's high key
Plotting on me most likely can't fuck with me cus I'm icy
I've just been so Lonely Lonely Lonely lonely
I've been so damn lonely
These niggas acting
Phony phony phony phony
Actin so damn phony
Just get out my way
Swerving thru lanes I been drifting away
And
I can't complain swear that I'll be okay
We are not the same no I'm never gon change Cha a a ange
I'm leaning on the fixture
And I've been off the liquor
Sipping on that remy with that henny what a mixture
They follow me like scripture
And I've been getting quicker
Been had the upper hand I hand to hand it like a pitcher
And we never gon faaaaall
All my brothers on caaaaall
We forever gon baaaaall
No it's nothing at aaaaall
I've just been so Lonely Lonely Lonely lonely
I've been so damn lonely
These niggas acting
Phony phony phony phony
Actin so damn phony
Just get out my way
Swerving thru lanes I been drifting away
And
I can't complain swear that I'll be okay
We are not the same no I'm never gon change Cha a a ange
