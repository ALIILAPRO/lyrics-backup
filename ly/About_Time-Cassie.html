		  [Cassie talking]

We've been through this a thousand times
And I've never been more sure then I am right now
{Cassie ugh shhh}
Please don't say anything
Its just about that time

I guess its about time that I'm finally moving on
I don't really care if its right or wrong
And in spite of the way I love your touch
You know its gon be better for both of us
It hurts like hell but I've got to try
You already know the reason why
So no matter who's right or wrong
I think its finally time that I'm moving on

Ohh I can't stop the way {I love you}
I've got to let this go
Although we've {tried}
Doesn't really matter no more
And I don't know what I stay here for
Especially when I know I gotta make a move

I guess its about time that I'm finally moving on
I don't really care if its right or wrong
And in spite of the way I love your touch
You know its gon be better for both of us
It hurts like hell but I've got to try
You already know the reason why
So no matter who's right or wrong
I think its finally time that I'm moving on

don't tell me I should stay {Its too late now}
To think we can make this work somehow
You should know the truth {Its over}
Over and done 
Ohh and I can't believe
All of this time you've had me thinking
Thinking you would call me late night
Knowing damn well you wouldn't do it
Telling me I was still on your mind
I don't know why you had to put me through it
And I'm thinking I'm still livin for your love
It was all over and you knew it
Although its gonna be hard to let this go
Boy this is something I gotta do

I guess its about time that I'm finally moving on
I don't really care if its right or wrong
And in spite of the way I love your touch
You know its gon be better for both of us
It hurts like hell but I've got to try
You already know the reason why
So no matter who's right or wrong
I think its finally time that I'm moving on

Gave you all of my heart
All of my body
All of my soul
All of my precious time
And you know its so hard loving somebody
And I loved you so good baby you can't deny
You know this time that respect just goes away
Let it fade away
And the only way to heal is to give me time and space
And I guess its time

I guess its about time that I'm finally moving on
I don't really care if its right or wrong
And in spite of the way I love your touch
You know its gon be better for both of us
It hurts like hell but I've got to try
You already know the reason why
So no matter who's right or wrong
I think its finally time that I'm moving on
