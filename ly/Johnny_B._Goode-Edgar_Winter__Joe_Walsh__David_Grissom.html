		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Way down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
He never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like ringing a bell

Go, go!
Go Johnny go, go, go!
Go Johnny go, go, go!
Go Johnny go, go, go!
Go Johnny go, go, go!
Johnny B. Goode

He use to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Sit beneath the trees by the railroad track
Oh, sit beneath the trees, linger in the shade
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by, they would stop and say
"Oh my, but that country boy can play!"

Go, go!
Go Johnny go, go, go!
Go Johnny go, go, go!
Go Johnny go, go, go!
Go Johnny go, go!
Now, Johnny B. Goode

Oh, come on Johnny, do it!

Oh, look out!

His mother told him someday he would be a man
And he would be the leader of a rock'n'roll band
Oh, many people coming from miles around
Hear him play his guitar when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name would be in lights
Saying "Johnny B. Goode tonight!"

Go, go!
Go Johnny go, go!
Go Johnny go, go, go!
Go Johnny go, go, go!
Go Johnny go, go, go!
Go, go, Johnny B. Goode!
