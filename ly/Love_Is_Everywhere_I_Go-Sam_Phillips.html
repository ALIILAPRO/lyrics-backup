		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Going down this road again
I finally know
There is no end to the good

Love is everywhere I go 
Looking through you
Love is everywhere I go 
Looking through you
Love is everywhere I go 
Looking through you

Burning light inside my dreams
I wake up in the dark
The light is outside my door

Love is everywhere I go 
Looking through you
Love is everywhere I go 
Looking through you
Love is everywhere I go 
Looking through you

Chasing every fragment I see
Looking through you 
Love is looking for me 
Breaking open the clouds
I'm not stranded in time

Love is everywhere I go 
Looking through you
Love is everywhere I go 
Looking through you
Love is everywhere I go 
Looking through you
