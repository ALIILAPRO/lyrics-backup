		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (This goes out to you), this goes out to you you you yeah yeah, this goes out to you you you yeah
This is dedicated to you you you yeah, dedicated to you you yeah
Dedicated to you you you, dedicated to you you you yeah

It was such a mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow day
When you walk by, the sunshine
Mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow day

I, I can't deny the way you caught my eye
I mean something struck and refilled up the sky
And everything on you intoxicates
It's a mystery, I don't know why
I let you kick in my do not disturb sign
But I guess your mouth in motion got me so high
And I could tell it's pure just by the taste
And you kiss me

So tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away, far away
Don't worry about your loving it won't go to waste, go to waste
Don't ever change your flavor 'cause I love the taste, love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way

'Cause she's just like nothing
That I ever seen before
Baby please don't change nothing
Because your flavors so original
And it all started when she said
Hey hey hey, smacking that strawberry bubblegum
You really got me when you said
Hey hey hey, popping that strawberry bubblegum

This goes out to you you you, this goes out to you you you

So tell why, we're making love like professionals on the first time
Acting unprofessional but it works out
'Cause you don't wanna work here anyway
And baby I, girl I'm all addicted and I won't fight
You and me that's the recipe for a good time
And it ain't really nothing but clothes in the way

Tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away, far away
Don't worry about your loving it won't go to waste, go to waste
Don't ever change your flavor 'cause I love the taste, love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way

'Cause she's just like nothing
That I ever seen before
Baby please don't change nothing
Because your flavors so original
And it all started when she said
Hey hey hey, smacking that strawberry bubblegum
You really got me when you said
Hey hey hey, popping that strawberry bubblegum

My lips are strawberry, strawberry, strawberry bubblegum
My lips are strawberry, strawberry, strawberry bubblegum
She's my little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
My lips are strawberry, strawberry, strawberry bubblegum
Hey, hey, hey, hey, my little hey, hey, hey

Come in, sit down
Let me elevate your appetite
Any flavor you want
Now my selection is the tasty kind
But you, you're delicious on your own
After I break you down my fingers
You're so sweet
That's what you told me when I taste on your lips
Duck under the door
Girl before they pick up your scent
If you'd be strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
If you'd be strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
And then I'd love you 'til I make you pop
Strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
Little girl won't you be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
And then I'd love you 'til I make you pop
Hey, hey, hey

My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum

If you'd be strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
Little girl won't you be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
And then I'd love you 'til I'll make you pop
Strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
Little girl if you'd be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
And then I'd love you 'til I make you pop
