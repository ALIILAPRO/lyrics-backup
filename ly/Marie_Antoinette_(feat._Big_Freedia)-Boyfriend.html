		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Livin' fabulous, livin' lavish, livin' stylish
Flamboyant, extravagant, livin' lavish
Yeah, I'm a bad bitch

I'ma roll up in a golden carriage
Four, five, six white stallions that match what I'm wearin'
I walk in and my status is apparent
And I fan myself with feathers while I yawn, an heiress
My hair and my nails, and the heels that I'm on
I look like the candy I got on my arm
Because it's the candy I got on my arm
I got her imported, she came from Mulan
But nothing I'm on was made in Taiwan
My jacket, my sheets, and my curtains chiffon
Too much of a good thing won't do me no harm
Too much of a good thing won't do me no harm

I want a hundred commas on my check (ching ching)
I wanna spend about a million dollars in one breath
Wanna go so hard, I might just lose my head (Her head)
I wanna live expensive like Marie Antoinette (Antoin-)

Marie Antoin-rie Antoinette
Ma-rie-rie-rie Antoin-rie Antoinette
Marie Antoin-rie Antoinette (Marie, Marie, Marie Antoin-)
Wanna live expensive like Marie Antoinette

Let them eat cake, let them eat cake, let them eat cake (eat it)
Let them eat it (you got to eat that cake)
Let them eat cake, let them eat cake, let them eat cake
Let them eat it (you gotta, you gotta, you gotta eat that cake)
(Eat it) slice, slice, slice, slice, slice, slice
You got to eat that cake

I don't pop bottles, I drink champagne off the font (font, font, font)
And I need a red carpet when I drive on the 405
Don't want no drama in my life
Unless it's front row at the opera house with Madame Butterfly
My chef, my chauffeur, and butler and spy
I come recommended, they come from Versailles
They come when I call, they're all standing by
My shrink and my Xanax in oversupply
Everyone jealous, and I can see why
My diamonds so sharp that I cut like a knife
Too much of a good thing, I can't wait to die
Too much of a good thing, I can't wait to die

You can call me the queen of debt (queen)
'Cause I just spent about a million
Dollars in one breath (ching ching)
And I go so hard I might just lose my head (her head)
Livin' life expensive like Marie Antoinette

Marie Antoin-rie Antoinette
Ma-rie-rie-rie Antoin-rie Antoinette
(Marie) Marie Antoin-rie Antoinette
Wanna live expensive like Marie Antoinette (Marie)

Let them eat cake, let them eat cake, let them eat cake
Let them eat it (you gotta, you gotta eat that cake)
Let them eat cake, let them eat cake, let them eat cake
Let them eat it (you gotta, you gotta)

Swipe it, slide it, I'm out the door
I put it in my car and close the door
Wrap it, unwrap it, and put it on
Can't wait to get to the house and try it on, uh
Livin' fabulous, livin' lavish, livin' stylish
Flamboyant, extravagant, livin' fabulous, livin' lavish
Yeah, I'm a bad bitch
