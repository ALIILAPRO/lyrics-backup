		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Found you 'bout a year ago now
I was headed west and you were living in that place downtown
I was so depressed in LA
Living in the mess I made then you turned it all around
Tell me what have I done
Cause I don't deserve someone like you
You could have anyone
But I'm the one you choose
Uh oh uh oh
It's only gonna burn brighter
Uh oh uh oh
'Cause your love is like wildfire
Uh oh uh oh
It's only gonna burn brighter
Uh oh uh oh
'Cause your love is like wildfire
Drove out to your parents last night
Your mom is such a saint and oh
Your dad is just a stand up guy
And baby I don't like anyone
So why is this different?
Usually try to stay distant
Tell me what have I done
Cause I don't deserve someone like you
You could have anyone
But I'm the one you choose
Uh oh uh oh
It's only gonna burn brighter
Uh oh uh oh
'Cause your love is like wildfire
Uh oh uh oh
It's only gonna burn brighter
Uh oh uh oh
'Cause your love is like wildfire
