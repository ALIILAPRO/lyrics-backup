		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's no need for you to say you're sorry
Goodbye I'm going home
I don't care no more so don't you worry
Goodbye I'm going home

I hate the way that even though you know you're wrong
You say you're right
I hate the books you read and all your friends
Your music's shite it keeps me up all night, up all night

There's no need for you to say you're sorry
Goodbye I'm going home
I don't care no more so don't you worry
Goodbye I'm going home

I hate the way that you are so sarcastic
And you're not very bright
You think that everything you've done's fantastic
Your music's shite it keeps me up all night, up all night

And it will be nice to be alone
For a week or two
But I know then I will be right
Right back here with you

There's no need for you to say you're sorry
Goodbye I'm going home
I don't care no more so don't you worry
Goodbye I'm going home
