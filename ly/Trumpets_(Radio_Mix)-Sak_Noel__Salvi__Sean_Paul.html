		  Bubble it, bubble it
Bubble it, bubble it

You see that gal with the big tic tac she fi gimme the, gimme the
Head to the floor gal gimme the, gimme the
Bend over gal and gimme the, gimme the
Slip down to the ground size big activity

And roll me girl and gimme the, gimme the
Top wine girl and gimme the, gimme the
Body look fine girl gimme the, gimme the
Come me nah waste no time girl gimme the, gimme the

Body look good girl you ever be winnin' it
Turn it up bright gal you never be dimming it
Shake up your body 'cause you're in your element
Pon your body me take up a permanent residence

Rotate your body 'cause me love how you spinning it
Rotate your body 'cause me love how you spinning it
Rotate your body 'cause me love how you spinning it

Make me trumpets blow!

Mama stop watch when you bubble it, bubble it
Serious thing it ain't no comedy, comedy
Man them say you are the comedy, comedy
So me want get some and come trouble it, trouble it
Buzz to bokle a the bubbly, bubbly
Call in two friend and then doubly, doubly
Gal so hot she a bubble it, bubble it
And she know what she got she a carry me remedy

Body look good girl you ever be winnin' it
Turn it up bright gal you never be dimming it
Shake up your body 'cause you're in your element
Pon your body me take up a permanent residence

Sound the trumpets

Rotate your body 'cause me love how you spinning it
Rotate your body 'cause me love how you spinning it
Rotate your body 'cause me love how you spinning it

Make me trumpets blow!
Make me trumpets blow!

Bubbly, bubbly
Bubbly, bubbly
