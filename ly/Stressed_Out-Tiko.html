		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're just stressed

All my friends told me to go
But I don't wanna go if you're not with me

Stressed Out
Time to rest out
I'm feelin' sorta left out
But I got no doubt
That in a little time it will be fine
And so I'll wait all day until I'm next in line

All my friends told me that I was wrong
But I saw a side that no one saw
I'm not feelin' like myself
I just lost the other half
Sorry, at the end of our story
We went down in flames

All my friends told me to go
But I don't wanna go if you're not with me

Stressed Out
Time to rest out
I'm feelin' sorta left out
But I got no doubt
That in a little time it will be fine
Da da na, na na na na na na na

Da da da, da da da da da da
Mm
Da da da, da da da da da da

All my friends told me that I was wrong
But I saw a side that no one saw
I'm not feelin' like myself
I just lost the other half

Huh, stressed out
Ba ba ba ba
