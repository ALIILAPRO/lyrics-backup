		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh

I need to shape myself out
Shape myself out from loving you, loving you
But tell me what do I do? (uh)
When you call me on a Friday night
But you never come through
Never come through

All these chills, all these thrills
Burn like million dollar bills
Got us naked on the floor
Like you never seen before
Heaven's closer than you think
You can taste it if you drink
But you don't (uh)
No, you don't

But that's a you problem
You know it's out my hands
You count on me to solve 'em
'Cause you've been making plans about us
It's simple, get lost in the romance
And just dance, let's just dance, alright
I said that's a you problem
I told you I'm your man
I'm only here for your love, I don't need no plan about us
It's simple, get lost in the romance
And just dance, baby, let's just dance

You need to shake yourself down
'Cause I know you've been missing me, missing me (uh)
And every time you say, "please"
I'm a pull you, pull you, pull you on your knees
On your knees, c'mon

All these chills, all these thrills
Burn like million dollar bills
Got us naked on the floor
Like you never seen before
Heaven's closer than you think
You can taste it if you drink
But you don't
No, you don't

But that's a you problem
You know it's out my hands
You count on me to solve 'em
'Cause you've been making plans about us
It's simple, get lost in the romance
And just dance, let's just dance, alright
Said that's a you problem
I told you I'm your man
I'm only here for your love, I don't need no plan about us
It's simple, get lost in a romance
And just dance, baby, let's just dance

Uh-huh, a you-you problem
Baby-baby, that's a you-you problem
Woah-oh, a you-you problem
Baby-baby, that's a you-you problem
Uh-huh, a you-you problem
Baby-baby, that's a you-you problem
Woah-oh, a you-you problem
Baby-baby, that's a you-you problem

But that's a you problem (problem)
You know it's out my hands
You count on me to solve 'em
'Cause you've been making plans about us (about us)
It's simple, get lost in the romance
And just dance (and just dance)
Oh, let's just dance (let's just dance)
Alright

So that's a you ooh
Uh-huh, a you-you problem (ooh)
Baby-baby, that's a you-you problem
Woah-oh, a you-you problem
Baby-baby, that's a you-you problem
Uh-huh, a you-you problem (yeah)
Baby-baby, that's a you-you problem
Woah-oh, a you-you problem (hey)
Baby-baby, that's a you-you problem
