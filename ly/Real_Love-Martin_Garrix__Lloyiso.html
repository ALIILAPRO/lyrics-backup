		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Oh)

When you smile, you can light up the sky
Give a glimpse of the paradise
When we touch, I forget all the pain
And get lost in your ocean eyes

Oh, I used to run away
Yeah, I was too afraid to open up my heart
This time I will stay, no, I won't hesitate
'Cause there's something about you

I'm only human, but I feel like
This could be some real, real love
Real, real love, oh
I'm only human, but I feel like
This could be some real, real love
Real, real love, oh

Real, real love
Real, real love, oh
Real, real love
Real, real love, oh

Just wanna let you know
You make me lose control
Driving me crazy
I'm only human, but I feel like
This could be some real, real love
Real, real love

When we dance, I get lost in the moment
Weightless in time and space
In your arms, I surrender to fate, yeah
I'm yours through this purple haze

Oh, I used to run away
Yeah, I was too afraid to open up my heart
This time I will stay, no, I won't hesitate
'Cause there's something about you

I'm only human, but I feel like
This could be some real, real love
Real, real love, oh
I'm only human, but I feel like
This could be some real, real love
Real, real love

Real, real love (yeah-yeah)
Real, real love (oh)
Real, real love (oh)
Real, real love (ah)

Just wanna let you know
You make me lose control
Driving me crazy
I'm only human, but I feel like
This could be some real, real love (oh)
Real, real love
