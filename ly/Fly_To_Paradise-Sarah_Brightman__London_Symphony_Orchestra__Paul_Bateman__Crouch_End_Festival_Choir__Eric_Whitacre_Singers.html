		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And all she ever thinks about
Is being any other place than this
'Cause she remembers having wings
But she has forgotten what it's like
To feel a paradise of bliss
 
And all I want to do is fly
Just fly
And all I want to do is fly
Just fly
 
I want to fly
Into the sky
I want to fly to paradise
All through the night
Into the light
I want to fly to paradise
 
And all she ever thinks about
Is memories of swinging through the sky
'Cause she remembers having wings
But she's forgotten what it feels like to fly
 
And all I want to do is fly
Just fly
And all I want to do is fly
Just fly
 
I want to fly
Into the sky
I want to fly to paradise
All through the night
Into the light
I want to fly to paradise
 
When you look into the sky
You might catch her flying by
Flying by
All she wants to do is fly
On her way to paradise
Paradise
