		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Loved you like a sinner
Mister winner
Yeah its gotta real bad after taste

Loved you like a sinner
Mister winner
Yeah its gotta real bad after taste

I don't really wanna talk
If we talk about it
I think that we're gonna be misunderstood 

I just really wanna help your problems
But I got my problems too
I wish you would 

Help me but I dont think that you can 
Cause I cannot help myself

I've been thinkin about all of this drama
And I can't blame nobody else

Ive been runnin
Facin all my demons
Tryin to win

Tryin to be like Jesus but my life is full of sin
If he died for me
Then I should die for someone else
Cause I ain't doin much
I fake my life
And go thru hell

Loved you like a sinner
Mister winner
Yeah its gotta real bad after taste

Loved you like a sinner
Mister winner
Yeah its gotta real bad after taste

Loved you like a sinner
Mr winner
Yeah it's got a real bad after taste
Your strength is growing slimmer
Bedroom lights stay dimmer
Everything alright
Why you been skipping dinner

Prolly gotta problem with addiction

Fuck it like who else just really don't

Sit watch and your TV
Eat yo bullshit
Smoke drink
Pop pills
Now you're gone

Off another drug
Get carried away
Now your body's
Gettin carried away
Mama cryin
Daddy lying
Tryin to save face
I dont know what else that I can say

They loved you
Loved you
Loved you

Loved you like a sinner
Mister winner
Yeah its gotta real bad after taste

Loved you like a sinner
Mr winner
Yeah it's got a real bad after taste
Your strength is growing slimmer
Bedroom lights stay dimmer
Everything alright
Why you been skipping dinner
