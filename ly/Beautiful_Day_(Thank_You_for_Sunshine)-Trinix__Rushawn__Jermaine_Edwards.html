		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna act too high and mighty
'Cause tomorrow I may fall down on my face

So Lord, thank You for sunshine, thank You for rain
Thank You for joy, thank You for pain
It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
So Lord, thank You for sunshine, thank You for rain
Thank You for joy, thank You for pain
It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day

So Lord, thank You for sunshine, thank You for rain
Thank You for joy, thank You for pain
It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day

So Lord, thank You for-
Beautiful, beautiful day
Beautiful, beautiful day
It's a beautiful

So Lord, thank You for sunshine, thank You for rain
Thank You for joy, thank You for pain
It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
So Lord, thank You for sunshine, thank You for rain
Thank You for joy, thank You for pain
It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day

So Lord, thank You for sunshine, thank You for rain
Thank You for joy, thank You for pain
It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day

So Lord, thank You for-
Beautiful, beautiful day
Beautiful, beautiful day
It's a beautiful

So Lord, thank You for sunshine, thank You for rain
Thank You for joy, thank You for pain
It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
