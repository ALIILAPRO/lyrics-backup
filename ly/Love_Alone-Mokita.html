		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now I’m not typically insecure 
But when you found me I was so much more
Every goodbye left me searching for an answer 
I still don’t have the answers
       
Now I know me and you feel some things
And right now I don’t know what that means
I wanna let you in but I don’t know how to
Before I say the things I want to
     
You gotta know my hearts been broken a few times before
If I seem closed off or distant its not personal 
I wanna let you in but I don’t know how to
Before I say the things I want to

I need to know that I’m not falling in love alone this time 
Alone this time 
I need to know that I’m not falling in love alone this time
Alone this time 


No I don’t usually fall so fast 
Or open up so quick about my past 
I guess its just something about you
There’s something different about you

And now you know my hearts been broken a few times before
If I seem closed off or distant its not personal 
I wanna let you in, just show me I can trust you
But before I the say things I want to

I need to know that I’m not falling in love alone this time 
Alone this time 
I need to know that I’m not falling in love alone this time
Alone this time
