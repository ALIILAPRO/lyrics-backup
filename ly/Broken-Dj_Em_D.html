		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hopeless
Feeling broken
Seems like every time I close my eyes
It's another day
Another fight
Feeling Worthless
Feeling helpless
I tried to hold it all inside
But I need your help
Need to make things right
So I'm down on my knees
And I'm falling falling falling
Every day every night every second
I be calling calling calling
Losing everything I have in this life
And I'm dying dying dying
The night is here but the sun will rise
So I'm fighting fighting fighting
For love
For peace
God make me brand new
Cuz I'm in need of you
To heal this broken soul
God make me be whole
Heal this broken soul
So I'm down on my knees
And I'm falling falling falling
Every day every night every second
I be calling calling calling
Losing everything I have in this life
And I'm dying dying dying
The night is here but the sun will rise
So I'm fighting fighting fighting
Selfish
Feeling breathless
Cuz all the wall I build inside
Are full of pain
And full of lies
But your perfect
I don't deserve this
The grace and love you've given me
It's all I want
And it's all I need
So I'm down on my knees
And I'm falling falling falling
Every day every night every second
I be calling calling calling
Losing everything I have in this life
And I'm dying dying dying
The night is here but the sun will rise
So I'm fighting fighting fighting
For love
For peace
God make me brand new
Cuz I'm in need of you
To heal this broken soul
God make me be whole
Heal this broken soul
So I'm down on my knees
And I'm falling falling falling
Every day every night every second
I be calling calling calling
Losing everything I have in this life
And I'm dying dying dying
The night is here but the sun will rise
So I'm fighting fighting fighting
