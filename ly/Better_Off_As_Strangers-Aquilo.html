		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dressed up all in black like a widow, 
Right beside but I’m burning, 
And I won’t speak cos I’m learning, 
What a waste of a warning,
I'm out my head but I’m sober. 

In the spotlight I’m stood right next to you hurting, 
My heart aches like a fathers,
I should go but I’m sorry, 
Well I’m too close to you lately, 
And it feels wrong to be right here. 

We could’ve had the world, 
We could’ve had each other, 
But all that's said and done, 
We’re better off as strangers, 
Now it's quiet when I sleep,
It's quiet when I’m dreaming, 
It's just another week, 
To live without a feeling, 
The feeling of you.

Like a spider spinning webs I got tangled, 
I got chains on my ankles, 
The penny drops when I miss ya, 
And I can’t help but believe in, 
A second chance is misleading, 
And I’m scared that, 
All my memories turn black, 
It’s you and me in a car crash, 
And what a shame that it's like that, 
I’m not sure that I’m over, 
To let it fade well I’m closer. 

We could’ve had the world, 
We could’ve had each other, 
But all that's said and done, 
We’re better off as strangers, 
Now it's quiet when I sleep,
It's quiet when I’m dreaming, 
It's just another week, 
To live without a feeling, 
The feeling of you.
