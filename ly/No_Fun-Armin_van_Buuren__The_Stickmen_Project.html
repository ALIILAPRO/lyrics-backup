		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why do you do it every time?
When all we want to do is fly
Oh, don't you want to feel alive?
You're gonna have to take a side

So come on, don't hold back
So come on, don't you leave
No one's controlling you
No one's controlling me

No, we don't waste no time
No, we don't need no sleep
And we can go all night
Come on

No, you're no fun
No, you're no fun
No, you're no fun
Come on, come on
No, you're no fun

No, you don't need to run away
When everybody calls your name
So tell me what you're gonna say?
And tell me that you're gonna change

So come on, don't hold back
So come on, don't you leave
No one's controlling you
No one's controlling me

No, we don't waste no time
No, we don't need no sleep
And we can go all night
Come on

No, you're no fun
No, you're no fun
No, you're no fun
Come on, come on
No, you're no fun

No, you're no fun
No, you're no fun
No, you're no fun
Come on, come on
No, you're no fun

No, you're no fun
No, you're no fun
No, you're no fun
No, you're no fun
No, you're no fun
