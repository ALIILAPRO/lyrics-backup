		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sittin' in front of your house
Like rain in early dawn
Workin' on a love letter
Got my radio on

Got my eye on your window pane
And I smoked a lot of cigarettes
Mercy, mercy but love is strange
And you haven't even kissed me yet

Look comes to push
Push comes to shove
Shove comes to touch
Touch will come to love

Workin' on a love letter
Listenin' to a love song
I'm writing you a love letter, love letter
Got my radio on, radio, radio

Hope you get the message baby
I know that you're gonna let me in
It's real in your neighborhood
And this is more than I'm gonna bend

Look comes to push
Push comes to shove
Shove comes to touch
Touch will come to love

Why don't sit waitin'
Why don't behavin'
Love's waiting in the car
In the car and rain now

Workin' on a love letter
Listenin' to a love song
I'm writing you a love letter, love letter
Got my radio on, radio, radio

Look comes to push
Push comes to shove
Shove comes to touch
Touch will come to love

Workin' on a love letter
Listenin' to a love song
I'm writing you a love letter, love letter
Got my radio on, radio, radio

Workin' on a love letter
Listenin' to a love song
I'm writing you a love letter, love letter
I got the, I got the, I got the radio, radio

Workin' on a love letter
Listenin' to a love song
I'm writing you a love letter, love letter
Got my radio on, radio, radio
