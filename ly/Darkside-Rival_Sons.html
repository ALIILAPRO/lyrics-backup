		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something's drivin' you out of your mind
Pretty soon you're goin' to get to where you're goin'
Pretty soon you're goin' to get to where you're goin'
Something's drivin' you out of your mind
Something's keepin' you awake at night
Losin' focus when you need to count your flock
Losin' focus when you need to count your flock
Something's keepin' you awake at night

There are no promises to keep anymore
Now that you've gone to the dark side
There are no promises to keep anymore
Now that you've gone to the dark side

Something's got you talkin' in your sleep
Pretty soon you're goin' to give yourself away
Pretty soon you're goin' to give yourself away
Something's got you talkin' in your sleep
Something's put a splinter in your hand
Are you able to protect the ones you love?
Are you able to protect the ones you love?
Something's put a tremble in your hand

There are no promises to keep anymore
Now that you've gone to the dark side
There are no promises to keep anymore
Now that you've gone to the dark side

There are no promises to keep anymore
Now that you've gone to the dark side
There are no promises to keep anymore
Now that you've gone to the dark side
Now that you've gone to the dark side
Now that you've gone to the dark side
Now that you've gone to the dark side
