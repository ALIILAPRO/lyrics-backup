		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No sleep, at it all night
My stupid ring light is burning my eyes and
I've been running my lines
Like 500 times so you think that it's my first try
Watch me lose my mind
I die with every swipe
I'm fading
I hope it's entertaining
Even though we play pretend
We're all liars in the end
Paint my life for my fake friends
I get high on the attention
Even though I play the part
This is way too fucking far
I don't let the screen go dark
I can't lie to my reflection
I can't lie to my reflection
No sleep, been at it all week
I can't find the time to shower or to eat
I'm such a mess behind the scenes
Those are the parts that you'll never see
Watch me lose my mind
I die with every swipe
I'm fading
I hope it's entertaining
Even though we play pretend
We're all liars in the end
Paint my life for my fake friends
I get high on the attention
Even though I play the part
This is way too fucking far
I don't let the screen go dark
I can't lie to my reflection
I can't lie to my reflection
I can't lie to my reflection
Even though I play the part
This is way too fucking far
I don't let the screen go dark
I can't lie to my reflection
