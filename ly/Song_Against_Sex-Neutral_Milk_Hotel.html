		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And the first one tore a picture
Of a dead and hanging man 
Who was kissing foreign fishes 
That flew right out from this hands
And when I put my arms around him
I felt the blushing blood run through my cheeks
And an eeriness surrounded when his tongue began to speak
And he said...Oh boy you are so pretty
Enough to wrap tight in rice-paper string. 
And when I finally kissed him the whole world began to ring
Lost like a bell that's tipping over 
With two cracks along both sides 
And I knew the world was over so I took a look outside
And watched the fires that were reaching 
Up to the weather vane and the tops of trees 
And the waiting scene and the Sunday dream
They're all waiting here for me

Deli markets with their flower stands
And pretty girls and the burning men 
Hanging out on the hooks next to the window displays
And I took out my tongue twice removed from my face 
Across a bridge and across the mountains
Threw a nickel in a fountain 
To save my soul from all these troubled times 
And all the drugs that I don't have the guts to take 
To soothe my mind so I'm always sober
Always aching, always heading towards 
Mass suicide, occult figurines
And wasted gas-station attendants
Attending to their jobs
And a nice drive in the country 
Finds a nice cliff to drop off 
Oh when this life just gets so grating 
All the grittiness of life
But don't take those pills your boyfriend gave you
You're too wonderful to die

And the last one tore a picture
From the pornographic page
When all the pleasure points attacking
All the looks of love were staged
And it's a lie that you've been given
That just hurts you every day
So why should i lay here naked
When it's just too far away
From anything we could call loving
Any love worth living for
So I'll sleep out in the gutter 
You can sleep here on the floor
And when I wake up in the morning 
I won't forget to lock the door
Because with a match that's mean and some gasoline
You won't see me anymore
