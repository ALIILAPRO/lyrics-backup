		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've been dreaming for too long just want to give up
I know that feeling
That's what I'm feeling

Words that I can say just won't be enough
But I want to say it
Just Let me say it

Don't be strong.
For me and for you
Just breakdown
You can breakdown
I am here to hold you
So we can get close to our paradise

Never thought my dreams would take this time
Or make me cry this way
So you've shouted in my arms
Don't know if I can take it more

Words that I can say just won't be enough
But I want to say it
Just Let me say it

Don't be strong.
For me and for you
Just breakdown
You can breakdown
I am here to hold you
So we can get close to our paradise

Breakdown

You can breakdown
Breakdown
Breakdown
You can breakdown
Breakdown
Breakdown
You can breakdown
