		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Really?
Je ne comprend pas
En fait je ne sais pas pourquoi tu me fait comme ça, je crois
Je mérite mieux que toi, tu sais
Mais n'importe ce que tu fais je te veux
Et je me ne comprend pas, vraiment pas
Pourquoi je fais ça?
Pourquoi tu te fais ça?
Fraichement je ne sais pas, je sais plu
Ça doit arrêter, arrêter tout de suite

I'm feeling numb off of all of these Xans, yeah
I know it's time that I fucked up your plans
I wish I was more of a man
I wish I was more of a man
Oh, no, you don't understand
I neglected you again

She said, "Don't forget you owe me one"
Ninety-nine cent dreams, maybe you could show me some
She told me she loved me, but I do not deserve your love
I put me above you and honestly I think I fucked it up
I don't know why

I'm 'bout to ruin the Ozone
I know you're sitting alone
I made mistakes with these white lines
And I'm clouded by all of the smoke
I don't think I'll ever get sober, no
I don't think I'll ever get sober

I'm bored out my mind again
If you need some company, call your friends
You told me I'm sick in the head, yeah
The sickness began with the meds
I might just jump off the ledge or drown in alcohol again

She said, "Don't forget you owe me one"
I need some reasons to live, maybe you could show me some
She told me she loved me but I do not deserve your love
The same person that I need is the one I'm running from
I don't know why

I'm 'bout to ruin the Ozone
I know you're sitting alone
I made mistakes with these white lines
And I'm clouded by all of the smoke
I don't think I'll ever get sober

I'm 'bout to ruin the Ozone
I know you're sitting alone
I made mistakes with these white lines
And I'm clouded by all of the smoke
I don't think I'll ever get sober
I don't think I'll ever get sober

I'm 'bout to ruin the Ozone
I know you're sitting alone
I made mistakes with these white lines
And I'm clouded by all of the smoke
I don't think I'll ever get sober
I don't think I'll ever get sober
Oh, no, no

I'm feeling numb off of all of these Xans
I know it's time that I fucked up your plans
I wish I was more of a man
I wish I was more of a man
Oh, no, you don't understand
I neglected you again
