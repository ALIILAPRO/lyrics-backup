		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's do it
Bitch, I'll drive this Hellcat through your livin' room (wizard)
(Firzt back like he left or some')

Walk in, don't say shit (yeah)
Let's go, nigga
The most I'ma do is just say, "Hi"
It ain't what it said, I'ma say, "Bye" (uh)
I hope he don't want you, no screenshot, bitch
You can't even see me on FaceTime
Bitch just asked if I'm the one that DM'd her on her Finsta
That ain't me, bitch that's a fake jawn

I don't got no Finsta, I'm reckless (uh)
That nigga that hot, he a pepper
She like to talk like a thot when she textin'
I wan' see what that's 'bout when she let me (okay)
Move the wrong way, it's gon' go down in this bitch
I can't calm him down, he a stepper (yeah)
Her and her friends in here, fine as hell
Need to wipe that girl down 'cause she pressure (ooh)
Let him cook, we gon' fuck on the sink or the stove
Hands on your knees and your toes (bitch)
You know I'm a dawg, you can lift up your skirt
Pussy better once you leave it on the clothes
Her pussy so good, have a nigga up four in the mornin'
Outside her house, beatin' on her door
Like

Walk in, don't say shit (yeah)
Let's go, nigga
The most I'ma do is just say, "Hi" (yeah)
It ain't what it said, I'ma say, "Bye" (uh)
I hope he don't want you, no screenshot, bitch
You can't even see me on FaceTime
Bitch just asked if I'm the one that DM'd her on her Finsta
That ain't me, bitch that's a fake jawn

It get lit in this bitch, you here pop Pyrex
I might get on some shit, I'ma walk down here
Talkin' 'bout hop out some shit, it got low mileage
When I fuck 'round with her, she my freak
And you ain't gon' never catch me with my motherfuckin' hand out
That's one thing 'bout me, I'ma eat
I fuck 'round and hit from the back, and I left on my shirt
She done nutted all over my Tee
I got a lil' nephew to raise, you see my big bro in his face
He say, "Long live G"
I pull out that Phantom today, my daughter's Meisah behind me
The car with my niece
Nigga, Lord, please, bitches wanna put me in the orgies
And, everywhere I go, I got a 4D
And, ain't a nigga that can lil' boy me (believe that)

Walk in, don't say shit, yeah (you a bitch-ass nigga)
The most I'ma do is just say, "Hi" (yeah)
It ain't what it said, I'ma say, "Bye" (bitch)
I hope he don't want you, no screenshot, bitch
You can't even see me on FaceTime
Bitch just asked if I'm the one that DM'd her on her Finsta
That ain't me, bitch that's a fake jawn (go)

Yeah, that ain't me, bitch
That ain't DaBaby, that's my baby
