		  Let's go get married
Branch? What?
I mean, let's get Bridget and Gristle married
Yeah, oh, 'cause it would be weird if we got married, (yeah) wow
So weird

Ooh
Keep it comin', love
Keep it comin', love
Don't stop it now, I won't stop it, no
We don't stop it, now, don't stop
Keep it comin', love (we are a family)
Keep it comin', love
Don't stop it, I won't stop it, no (all my brothers and my sisters with me)
We don't stop it, girl, don't stop

Everyone can see we're together
As we walk on by
And we fly just like birds of a feather
I won't tell no lies
All of the people (we are family)
Around us, they say
"Can they be that close?"
Just let me state for the record (we are family)
We're good to love and our family too

Push it real good
Get it, get it
Ooh, baby, baby
Baby, baby
Get up on by
Push it (push it)
Wax it (wax it)
Shave it (shave it)
Pu-push it real good
Get up on

I do my hair, plus, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'?
Feelin' good as
I do my hair, plus, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'?
Feelin' good as hell
It's me he's lookin' for
I can see it in his eyes
(Ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh)

Everybody treats me like I'm just a little baby (yeah, yeah)
But I'm walkin' and I'm turnin' on the daily (sheesh)
I roll the dice, drinkin' cola gettin' wild
Daddy I'm a man now not a little child

Come on, guys, it's time

We are family (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I got all my sisters with me (come on now, Come on now)
We are family (uh, uh)
Get up, everybody and sing (get up, get up, get up, get up)
We are family (yeah, yeah)
I got all my sisters with me (feelin' good as hell)
We are family
Get up everybody and sing
Sing it to me, sing it to me, sing it to me
