		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I'm so happy for you)
(You're doing so good)

I love to see it
All the sweat and tears
That go into you trying
While I'm here smiling
You can't control it
All these urges taking over
You keep fighting
There's no denying

How many miles have been ran for you
Watered and planted the seed
Watch you go and feel your soul
And take over control
The more that you go against me
The harder it gets to breathe
Pick a side, yours or mine
Just know that every time, oh

I win (la la la, la la la la)
I win (la la la, la la)

You hear the static
From the footsteps all around
Inside your attic
Ooh, that's so tragic
Can smell the envy (I can't stand her)
Every time you try to come
And get too friendly
It's kinda funny

I'm in your house, playing mind games
Know what you want them to see
Do your dance for your fans
And let them all believe
The more that you go against me
The harder it gets to breathe
Pick a side, yours or mine
Know that every time

(La la la, la la la la) I win
(La la la, la la) I win
(La la la, la la la la)
(La la la, la la) I win

(Oh my god)
(Not again)
(I win)
(I win)

You can see it on your face
When you're losing every game
You and me, we not the same
Just when you think you've won
But the game hasn't begun
Brought a knife to fight with a gun

I win (la la la, la la la la)
(I want it)
I win
I win

(She thinks she's so cool)
