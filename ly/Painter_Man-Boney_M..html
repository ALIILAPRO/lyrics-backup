		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Went to college, studied arts
To be an artist make a start
Studied hard, gettin' my degree
But no one seemed to notice me

Painter man, painter man
Who want to be a painter man
Painter man, painter man
Who want to be a painter man

Tried cartoons and comic books
Dirty postcards could have done
Here was where the money laid
Classic art has had it's day

Painter man, painter man
Who want to be a painter man
Painter man, painter man
Who want to be a painter man

Did adverts for T.V.
Household shops and brands of tea
Labels all around the cans
Who want to be a painter man

Painter man, painter man
Who want to be a painter man
Painter man, painter man
Who want to be a painter man

La, la, la, la, la, la,
La, la, la, la, la, la, la,
Painter man, painter man
Who want to be a painter man
