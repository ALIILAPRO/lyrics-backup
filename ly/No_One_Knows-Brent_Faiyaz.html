		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say you love me for me
It's hard to believe
I put my heart on my sleeve
You're all that I need

But I don't wanna play your games no more
I changed for sure
And I'm balling on you
Watch me pull off in that foreign
Girl, don't come to my show
Who let you in the door?
No one knows
No one knows

Oh, I bet
That you're missing me now
You know you wish
You were kissing me now

Oh, I bet
That you're missing me now
You know you wish
You were kissing me now

Girl, I love you for you
I thought it was true
What should I do
You played me for a fool

But I don't wanna play your games no more
I changed for sure
And I'm balling on you
Watch me pull off in that foreign
Girl, don't come to my show
Who let you in the door
No one knows
No one knows

Oh, I bet
That you're missing me now
You know you wish
You were kissing me now

Oh, I bet
That you're missing me now
You know you wish
You were kissing me now

But I don't wanna play your games no more
I changed for sure
And I'm balling on you
Watch me pull off in that foreign
Girl, don't come to my show
Who let you in that door
No one knows
No one knows

But I don't wanna play your games no more
I changed for sure
And I'm balling on you
Watch me pull off in that foreign
Girl, don't come to my show
Who let you in that door

No one knows
No one knows
No one knows (no one knows)
No one knows (no one knows, no one knows)
No one knows
No one knows (no one knows)
No one knows
No one knows (no one knows, no one knows) 
No one knows (no one knows)
No one knows (no one knows, no one knows)
