		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Care not for the men who wonder 
Straw that broke your back, you're under 
Cast all them aside who care 
Empty eyes and dead end stare 

Don't you know that none are blind 
To the lie and you think I don't find what you hide? 
What in God's name have you done? 
Stick your arm for some real fun 

For the horse you've grown much fonder 
Than for me, that I don't ponder 
As the hair of one who bit you 
Smiling, bite your own self, too 

And I think that you're not blind 
To the ones you left behind 
I'll be here 
What in God's name have you done? 
Stick your arm for some real fun, uh 

So be yearning all your life 
Twisting, turning like a knife 
Now you know the reasons why 

Can't get high, or you will die 
Or you'll die 
What in God's name have you done? 
Stick your arm for some real fun 

So your sickness weighs a ton 
And God's name is smack for some, yeah
