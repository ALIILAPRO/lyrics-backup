		  Woke up on some evil shit, like bro, come see this shit
(Great John on the beat, by the way)
Huh

I woke up on some evil shit, like bro, come see this shit, huh
Hopped up in that push to start, don't got no key for this
I'm shinin', you should see the wrist, huh, I ain't even trip, huh
When we slide we tryna park 'em like that meter shit, gang

Huh, please don't start, you cannot finish this, huh
Bitch, I'm eatin' with a plate, I say I finished it, damn
Said she love me for my senteces, huh
Everybody say they love me, I ain't feelin' it (ayy)
I go stupid, I don't got no sense
'Cause I make dollars, it's a problem then we hittin' shit, stain
Ran it up like I was shootin' shit
I'm too paid, she gave me top like a toupee, ayy
Say they love me but it's too late
I'm cookin' up, I'm talkin' work, this ain't no souffl√©, wait, whoa
High off this Earth, I'm feelin' moody
Let's make a movie, put that shit in Blu-Ray (Blu-Ray)

I woke up on some evil shit, like bro, come see this shit, huh
Hopped up in that push to start, don't got no key for this
I'm shinin', you should see the wrist, huh, I ain't even trip, huh
When we slide we tryna park 'em like that meter shit, gang

Gang, gang, poke 'em like some meters, uh
I'm bout my, I'm bout my family like I'm Peter, uh
Wait, 'cause they was flexin', I don't see 'em
They was chattin', no Sheff G (look)

I hear 'em chattin' on my name and what I'm doin', huh (what I'm doin')
They disrespectin' and you know I put 'em through it, huh
Yeah, she was frontin', now she put her back into it, huh
No, this ain't Nike but I promise I'ma do it (do it)
They say Sheff G and Sleepy always lookin' demonized
And this old Glock got so much shells, could make some turtles hide
Now we gon', up it without a question (without a question)
With all the sites we still'll slide just like a penguin

I woke up on some evil shit, like bro, come see this shit, huh
Hopped up in that push to start, don't got no key for this
I'm shinin', you should see the wrist, huh, I ain't even trip, huh
When we slide we tryna park 'em like that meter shit, gang (gang)
