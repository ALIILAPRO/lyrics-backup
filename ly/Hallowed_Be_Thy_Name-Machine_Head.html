		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm waiting in my cold cell
When the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life
And it doesn't have much time
'Cause at five o'clock
They take me to the gallows pole
The sands of time
For me are running low
Oh, low, yeah

When the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me

Can it be there's some sort of an error
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end not some crazy dream?

Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me
When I try to speak
Tears they flow but why am I crying?
After all I'm not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end?

As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Someone calls from a cell "God be with you"
If there's a God then why has he let me go?

As I walk all my life drifts before me
And though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul 'cause it's willing to fly away

Mark my words, believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truth

When you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down there is just a strange illusion

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hallowed be Thy name
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hallowed
Be Thy name
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
