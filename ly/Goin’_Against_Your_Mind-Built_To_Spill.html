		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  People think when you don't understand
What it takes to outta be a man

I don't care much for that
I don't know why

Just a fight or just a waste of time
Higher queens that no one wants to find

I don't know much of that
I don't care why

Goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind

Goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind

Goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind

When I was a kid I saw a light
Floating high above the trees one night

Thought ‘twas an alien
Turned out to be just god

If you're not sure who not to believe
Who has better reasons to deceive

Then they'll be glad'r
That's all they do

Goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind

Goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind

Goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind

And he was there
No he was there
