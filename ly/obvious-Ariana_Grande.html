		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love the taste of you in the morning
Keep me warm and nothing else 
Nothing more important
Makes me wanna believe in love (mmm)

I love the thought of us in the evening
Crave the feeling
The way you feel, something 'bout it's healing
I'm praying we don't fuck this up (ah, babe)

Others that I've had, had to impress me before
But I knew you were the real thing when you walked through the door
I didn't think that I would have to spell it out

Don't put the bands, put the bands on me
Oh, my love, oh, my love is free
Ain't no price on my loyalty
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby
Could I be more obvious? (ooh)
Hard to think when I'm under you
Tell you all of my dirty truths
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby
Could I be more obvious?

Maybe if I'm lucky, you might stay the afternoon
If you gotta work, just promise me you'll come back soon
Maybe you should pack a suitcase, too (too)

I love the thought of you never leaving (no)
Days repeating
Getting steps up on the treadmill while you're sleeping
Never thought I'd believe in love again

Others that I've had, had to impress me before (ooh)
But I knew you were the real thing when you walked through the door
I didn't think that I would have to spell it out

Don't put the bands, put the bands on me
Oh, my love, oh, my love is free
Ain't no price on my loyalty
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby
Could I be more obvious? (Ooh)
Hard to think when I'm under you
Tell you all of my dirty truths
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby
Could I be more obvious?
Obvious
