		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Tank God)

I put her on game, put her on game (game)
We do our thing
With Christian Dior and diamond the chains (chains)
We in the Range
Just swervin' the cars, swervin' the lanes
Give a fuck who ain't
These niggas out here don't wild in the paint
I put her on game, she like me 'cause she know I put her on (I put her on)
I put her on (I put her on), yeah
You not gettin' that bread, then we can't get a
Can't get along, oh

I put her on game, she love my game (she love my game)
Underneath these scars is so much pain (so much pain)
These niggas switch up, don't remain the same (remain the same)
I can't believe what they'd do for the fame (do)
I swear fuck 'em, I'ma just do my thing (do my thing)
Niggas, they don't wanna go to practice, but they'll play the game (play the game)
They wanna get me back in my feelings, they wanna gang bang
Ever since I started gettin' that money, they started hatin' (they started hatin')
Baby girl, I could put you on, it drive me crazy (crazy)
I just wanna get you wet, girl, on the daily (on the daily)
But that other nigga who was callin', you with me, baby
Oh, oh, oh (Woo, woo, woo)

I put her on game, put her on game (game)
We do our thing
With Christian Dior and diamond the chains (chains)
We in the Range
Just swervin' the cars, swervin' the lanes
Give a fuck who ain't
These niggas out here don't wild in the paint
I put her on game, she like me 'cause she know I put her on (I put her on)
I put her on (I put her on), yeah
You not gettin' that bread, then we can't get a
Can't get along, oh

Put her on, yeah
You know that I put her on (put her on)
You know that I put her (I put her, I put her)
I put her, I put her, woah (I put her, woah)
As long as you hold me down everywhere we go (everywhere we go)
Lately, I ain't been havin' no heart
I don't wanna sleep with no ho (oh)
Crazy how the world could take you fast
And then it could take you slow (slow)
Girl, I'ma put yo' lil ass on game, you better not treat me wrong (wrong)
She want it, huh, right now, ready to go (ready)
You want it, huh, huh, right now, right in the store (whoa)
Choppa rounds, I shoot out for you, whatever you want
Designer now, I drip you out all new, whatever you want (yeah)
Baby, you a boss, you know a boss do whatever she want
Oh, oh, oh, (woo, woo, woo)

I put her on game, put her on game (game)
We do our thing (thing)
Christian Dior and diamond the chains (chains)
We in the range (Range)
Just swervin' the cars, swervin' the lanes
Give a fuck who ain't
These niggas out here don't wild in the paint (oh, no)
I put her on game, she like me 'cause she know I put her on (I put her on)
I put her on, yeah (woo, woo, woo)
You not gettin' that bread, then we can't get a
Can't get along, oh
