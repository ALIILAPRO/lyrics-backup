		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
I'm not really on this flow normally
This somethin' I'ma try for real
Yeah, yeah
Run up the city
Run up the city, you know that we turn up
I run with the boss, you get caught with a burna
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Run up the city, you know that we turn up
I run with the boss, you get caught with a burna
Come to my crib, but you know I return her
If they catch you lackin', there might be a murder
You just lame, come and hang with a real one
I'm rockin' with bosses, you know we make millions
Boy talkin' crazy, you know that we drill 'em
Empty shoes boxes, you know how we fill 'em

Pull up with a beam in the SRT
Yeah, I cop a new whip now she all on me
Tryna act black but I'm white as can be
Yeah, I'm white Lil Baby, no one harder than me
Make the wrong move now it's R.I.P.
Flexin' these bands it's not hard for you to see
Keep gettin' checks like a MVP
Ball like pro I ain't on JV
Now we livin' lavish
'Member times when we ain't have it
Playin' with a boss got a gun go grab it
Cop a new watch for every time I didn't have it
Come from the mud now they say I'm really cappin'
Tryna make it out of this hood keep rappin'
In the Hellcat, yeah, I'm speedin' into traffic
Spendin' all my money, yeah, I'm tryna make it happen
Spendin' all my money, yeah

Run up the city, you know that we turn up
I run with the boss, you get caught with a burna
Come to my crib, but you know I return her
If they catch you lackin', there might be a murder
You just lame, come and hang with a real one
I'm rockin' with bosses, you know we make millions
Boy talkin' crazy, you know that we drill 'em
Empty shoes boxes, you know how we fill 'em

Change up the flow, yeah, you know how I rock
I ain't rockin' with Durk I ain't on no block
Chillin' on my wrist, yeah, I gotta keep a clock
Makin' big moves on my way to the top
Speakin' of clock I ain't on TikTok
He ain't pad no case now my bro got locked
You know how we do it, my grind don't stop
You know I'm big time, won't run from the cops
Try to give back, know I rock with a strap
Chillin' with a beam but my brodie gotta MAC
I'm just waitin' for time I receive my plaque
If they catch me lackin' I run like track
Really wanna blow I don't know that feelin'
Got you talkin' crazy now my thoughts through the ceilin'
You broke my heart now it's time for the healin'
Won't let it happen, you know I ain't stealin'

Run up the city, you know that we turn up
I run with the boss, you get caught with a burna
Come to my crib, but you know I return her
If they catch you lackin', there might be a murder
You just lame, come and hang with a real one
I'm rockin' with bosses, you know we make millions
Boy talkin' crazy, you know that we drill 'em
Empty shoes boxes, you know how we fill 'em, yeah, yeah
