		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, you know I have seen
A sky without sun, a man with no nation
Saints, captive in chains
A song with no name for lack of imagination

And I have seen
Darker than ebony
And now it seems, that I
Without your eyes could never be

My one desire, all I aspire
Is in your eyes forever to live
Traveled all over, the seven oceans
There is nothing that I wouldn't give

Came from Bahrein, gone to Beruit
Looking for someone comparing to you
Tearing down windows and doors
And I could not find eyes like yours

Rabboussamai fikarrajaii
Fi ainaiha aralhayati
Ati ilaika min haza lkaaouni
Arjouka labbi labbi nidai

Came from Bahrain, until Beirut
Looking for someone comparing to you
Tearing down windows and doors
And I could not find eyes like yours

Oh, you know I have seen
A woman of means in rags and begging for pleasure
Crossed, a river of salt
Just after I rode a ship that sunk in the desert

And I have seen
Darker than ebony
And now it seems, that I
Without your eyes could never be

My one desire, all I aspire
Is in your eyes forever to live
Traveled all over, the seven oceans
There is nothing that I wouldn't give

Came from Bahrein, gone to Beruit
Looking for someone comparing to you
Tearing down windows and doors
And I could not find eyes like yours

Rabboussamai fikarrajaii
Fi ainaiha aralhayati
Ati ilaika min haza lkaaouni
Arjouka labbi labbi nidai

Came from Bahrein, gone to Beruit
Looking for someone comparing to you
Tearing down windows and doors
And I could not find eyes like yours

Rabboussamia fikarrajaii
Fi ainaiha aralhayati
At ilaika min haza ikaaouni
Arjouka labbi labbi nidai

Came from Bahrein, until Beriut
Looking for someone comparing to you
Tearing down windows and doors
And I could not find eyes like yours

My one desire, all I aspire
Is in your eyes forever to live
Traveled all over, the seven oceans
There is nothing I wouldn't give

Came from Bahrain, until Beirut
Looking for someone comparing to you
Tearing down windows and doors
And I could not find eyes like yours
