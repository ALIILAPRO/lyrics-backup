		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Missing you like the tide rushin' me
The second I lost you I was lost at sea
Yeah, the taste on my tongue, bitter sweet
The second, I lost you I was lost at sea

Alone on this island
Got lost on the way 
Without you in my sight, feels like I'm so out of place 
A flashback and rewind
Should feel like a crime
But I can't keep myself
From thinking of us time to time

Missing you like the tide rushin' me
The second I lost you I was lost at sea
Yeah, the taste on my tongue, bitter sweet (bitter sweet)
The second, I lost you I was lost at sea

So show me the way 
Illa illa illa illa illa
Away-oo-way
Illa illa illa illa illa
I'm drifting away 
Illa illa illa illa illa
Away-oo-way
Illa illa illa illa illa

Hey
Castaway, you held me down
But now you left me hanging
Clouding up my sight
You know the fog is never ending
Ain't the same without you on this road we used to grow in
Ain't the same without you here to hold me when I'm lonely
Can't seem to wipe it off my mind
Run my sleeves over my eyes
Where are you going without me?
Left me like a hurricane sinking inside me

Missing you like the tide rushin' me (missing you, missing you)
The second I lost you I was lost at sea (I was lost, I was lost)
Yeah, the taste on my tongue, bitter sweet (bitter sweet)
The second, I lost you I was lost at sea

So show me the way 
Illa illa illa illa illa
Away-oo-way
Illa illa illa illa illa
I'm drifting away
Illa illa illa illa illa
Away-oo-way
Illa illa illa illa illa

Missing you is what I'm doing best right now
Heavyhearted, that's my home address right now 
Corners of my broken heart are razor sharp, believe me
And this pointed edge is only gonna hurt me now
These scars ain't nothing new to me
Goodbyes ain't nothing new to me 
Empty hearts, we fall apart
I seen it all before
I'll see it all again

So show me the way 
Illa illa illa illa illa
Away-oo-way
Illa illa illa illa illa
I'm drifting away
Illa illa illa illa illa
Away-oo-way
Illa illa illa illa illa

Stargazing by the rolling waves 
No more tears falling down my face
Just like sand 
We drift away 
All this time, we were bound to break

Stargazing by the rolling waves 
No more tears falling down my face
Just like sand 
We drift away 
All this time, we were bound to break
