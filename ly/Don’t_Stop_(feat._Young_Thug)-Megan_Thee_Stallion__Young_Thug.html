		<p>
		  Real hot girl shit
Ah, ayy (Buddah bless this beat)

I've got a stank ass walk and a reckless ass mouth (I don't give a fuck)
And my shit so tight, when we fuck, my pussy talk (my pussy talk)
I don't even say, "What's up?" I just tell him what I want (what I want)
'Cause I got another nigga that's gon' do it if he don't (ah)
Attitude bad, pussy too good (yeah)
When he say, "Fuck me" I tell him, "Fuck me good" (good)
Chase these niggas? I wish I would
Bad bitch like me? Hoes wish they could (could)
She a Casper to me, I need glasses to see
In the mall with her daddy, she a bastard to me (yeah)
If you ain't fuckin' him right, bitch, pass him to me
Real niggas love me from the H to the D

Don't stop, pop that cat
Mm, mm, just like that
Mm, mm, shake that shit (bow, bow, bow)
Hm, hm, work it, bitch
Don't stop, pop that cat (bow)
Mm, mm, just like that
Mm, mm, shake that shit (brr, brr, brr)
Hm, hm, work it, bitch

Patek, just for the day
Say she got the gold, roll the Ace of Spades
She catch a cold when she rock chains
But lemme see, Pinky and the Brain (Brain)
Our baby mommas ain't the same
She like, "Baby daddy, ice my chain" (ice)
She 'bout to come and give me top like a crane
You a bitch and a ho, but you gang, ayy
Shake what ya doctor gave ya
And I'ma ice your wrists like a player (ayy)
Doctor Miami add layers
Now the ass is fat like a acre
Come to the spot and we lay up
And I'll cream that pussy like mayos
Ever since I got my cake up
I been runnin' these bitches like a mayor (whew)
Don't stop, hatchback
Shakin' that ass on Snapchat (yeah)
Off the script and shakin' that ass
What you'll do for these rack, racks? (Whew)
Where my thots at?
I just freed this bitch like a bird, yeah (yeah)
Where my thots at?
Let me hit it from the back, say, "Slatt, Slatt"

Don't stop, pop that cat
Mm, mm, just like that
Mm, mm, shake that shit (bow, bow, bow)
Hm, hm, work it, bitch
Don't stop, pop that cat (bow)
Mm, mm, just like that
Mm, mm, shake that shit (brr, brr, brr)
Hm, hm, work it, bitch (hey)

I'm gonna blow him like AC (mwah)
Give me big head like IT (ah)
Lick, lick, lick me 'til I scream
Twist his tongue like I, I mean
I mean my body so out of this world
Change my at name to ASTROGIRL (ASTROGIRL)
People say I'm way too full of myself
You're right, and I ain't even made it to dessert (ah)
Buffy, no angels, star no spangle
Forty inch weave by Kellon don't tangle
Call my drug dealer boyfriend on Tango
Use the Tajín when I'm eating a mango
Yeah, I get jealous
If you ate it real good I can't help it
Any bitch you're fuckin' with, you need to dead it
'Fore I come through and shit get hectic, ah

Don't stop, pop that cat
Mm, mm, just like that
Mm, mm, shake that shit (bow, bow, bow)
Hm, hm, work it, bitch
Don't stop, pop that cat
Mm, mm, just like that
Mm, mm, shake that shit
Hm, hm, work it, bitch

Don't stop, pop that cat
Mm, mm, just like that
Mm, mm, shake that shit (bow, bow, bow)
Hm, hm, work it, bitch
Don't stop, pop that cat
Mm, mm, just like that (bow, bow, bow)
Mm, mm, shake that shit (brr, brr, brr)
Hm, hm, work it, bitch
