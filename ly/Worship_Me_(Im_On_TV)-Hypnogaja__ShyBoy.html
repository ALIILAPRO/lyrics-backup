		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Busy with your empty life

Still don't know just what to try

I can be all that you need

I can can answer all your dreams

I feed off of your despair

Follow me, I'll take you there



Worship me

I'm on TV

Tell me you love me

Worship me

I'm on TV

I know that you love me



I'll distort reality

To give you what you need to see

I've got nothing new to say

But I will say it anyway

I will waste your days away

While the world falls to decay



Worship me

I'm on TV

Tell me you love me

Worship me

I'm on TV

I know that you love me

Worship me

I'm on TV

Tell me you love me

Worship me

I'm on TV

Tell me you love me

(I know that you love me)



I can be your distraction

Keep you away from all the action

Don't turn away, drop to your knees

Just keep your eyes fixed on me

On me, on me, on me

Keep em on me
