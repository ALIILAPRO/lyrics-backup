		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was stopped in London when I felt it coming down
Crashing all around me with a great triumphant sound
Like the dam was breaking and my mind came rushing in
I was stopped in London, oh, I was awakening
I was

I was o'er in Paris when I almost ran away
Two times round the block before I decided to stay
Puffed along a cigarette that went and made me sick
Spent another day pretending I was over it

This time, I know I'm fighting
This time, I know I'm (back in my body)
This time, I know I'm fighting
This time, I know I'm back in my body, oh
I'm back in my body, oh

(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

And all along the highway there's a tiny whispering sound
Saying I could find you in the dark of any town
But all that I am hearing in the poem of my mind
Are sullen, twisted words finding their way in every line

Oh, this time, oh, this time

This time, I know I'm fighting
This time, I know I'm (back in my body)
This time, I know I'm fighting
This time, I know I'm (back in my body)
Lost you in the border town of anywhere
I found myself when I was going everywhere
This time, I know I'm fighting
This time, I know I'm

(Back in my body, oh, oh)
(Back in my body, oh, oh)
(Back in my body, oh, oh)

Oh, this time, oh, this time
Oh, this time, oh, this time
Oh, this time, oh, this time
Oh, this time, oh, this time

This time, I know I'm fighting
This time, I know I'm (back in my body)
This time, I know I'm fighting
This time, I know I'm (back in my body)
Lost you in the border town of anywhere
I found myself when I was going everywhere
This time, I know I'm fighting
This time, I know I'm back in my body, oh
I'm back in my body, oh
I'm back in my body, oh
Back in my body, oh, oh
