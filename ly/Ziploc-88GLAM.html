		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I secure the bag like ziploc
I got big guap, pop them tags, I rip off
Baguettes in my wrist watch
Don't tick-tock, yeah, not at all, yeah
All this sauce, yeah, they pissed off, yeah
Foreign broads in my bed, whoa
Hoes since I wore Hermes, whoa
Presidents all are dead, yeah
Double G's on my head, whoa
(Double G's on my head, whoa)
Hope a nigga don't think I'm nice
I'm the baddest one since Mike
When I threw bands, check the price
Nah-nah

Ride me like a bike, yeah
Diamonds on me and they bite, yeah
On IG, get no likes, yeah
Keep a stick like a dike, yeah
Rover, Range, I snipe, yeah
Brand new Millie, iced, yeah
PJs on this PJ was asleep for the whole flight
New girl with me humble
Please don't fall into the hype
Hunnid racks in a year
Spent that just on gear (whoa)
Now my record clear
See a goat when I wake up
And look into the mirror

I secure the bag like ziploc
I got big guap, pop them tags, I rip off
Baguettes in my wrist watch
Don't tick-tock, yeah, not at all, yeah
All this sauce, yeah, they pissed off, yeah
Foreign broads in my bed, whoa
Hoes since I wore Hermes, whoa
Presidents all are dead, yeah
Double G's on my head, whoa
(Double G's on my head, whoa)
Hope a nigga don't think I'm nice
I'm the baddest one since Mike
When I threw bands, check the price
Nah-nah

Eh, I got hoes since I wore Hermes
I fuck a foreign broad in my bed
All my presidents are dead
Double G's on me I don't wear Guess
Hope a nigga don't think I'm nice
I'm the baddest one since Mike
Run through bands without checking the price
I just got top from another nigga wife
And I'm grindin' for my ice
I'm taking risks everyday of my life
Can't trust a bitch and these niggas is trife
I'm a real nigga, I won't expire
I rock Palm Angels with the fire, then

I secure the bag like ziploc
I got big guap, pop them tags, I rip off
Baguettes in my wrist watch
Don't tick-tock, yeah, not at all, yeah
All this sauce, yeah, they pissed off, yeah
Foreign broads in my bed, whoa
Hoes since I wore Hermes, whoa
Presidents all are dead, yeah
Double G's on my head, whoa
(Double G's on my head, whoa)
Hope a nigga don't think I'm nice
I'm the baddest one since Mike
When I threw bands, check the price
Nah-nah
