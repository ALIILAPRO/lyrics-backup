		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I found you
In the dark
I found you
In the dark

Don't leave me
Here
Don't leave me

Staring at the sun
A love so strong it hurts
Staring at the sun
A love so strong it hurts

I dreamed of you
In the dark
You spoke to me
From afar
What you mean to me
Is clear
And I'll always be near

I found you
In the dark
I found you
In the dark

Don't leave me
Here
Don't leave me

Staring at the sun
A love so strong it hurts
Staring at the sun
A love so strong it hurts

I look into your eyes
See my life defined
Look into your eyes
See your heart in mine
