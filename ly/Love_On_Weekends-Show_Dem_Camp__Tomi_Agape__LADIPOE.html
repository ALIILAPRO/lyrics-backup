		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey what are you up to this weekend
I don't know
Yeah
What have you got planned
If it's gonna be then it's gotta be it
Alive alive alive alive

Alive looking deep in my eyes
Arise in the seal of the night
Feels like I'm drunk Hennessy love
Drunk off your touching loosen up

These brownies we baking up
Funny how we went from laughing out loud to waking up
Now we touching softly on the couch now don't interrupt
Only words coming out my mouth now is whisper don't stop
I'm also trippy awkward tipsy
High off tattoos piercings tricky
Love makes noises
Right there kiss me
Love on weekends is sticky
You make me feel
You make me feel loved
You make me feel
You make me feel loved
Waking up with you's a blessing
Can I get an amen
When you got some sick days of work can we lay in
Cos in the spot there I got you giggling like stop playing
Know I'm lighter on my feet when I get it on the air
So talk to me
Got words for me
Pitch that's a 12 track playlist and I got it on repeat
Your favourite songs on now we tap into the beat
Like I only woke her up just to put her back to sleep back to sleep

Alive looking deep in my eyes
Arise in the seal of the night
Feels like we drunk Hennessy love
Drunk of your touching loosen up

I'm also trippy awkward tipsy you make me feel
High off tattoos piercings tricky you make me feel loved
Love makes noises you make me feel
Right there  kiss me you make me feel loved
Love on weekends is sticky you make me feel loved

I feel like drinking from your fountain
Let me get a mouth full
It's hard for me to reach the heights without you
Cos when I shine you shine I need your full participation
My overriding quest is your leisure
Put some values when I go deep
Lost in your sauce we not gon' sleep
The things you do make me so weak
Weekend vibes on a low-key
No fantasy
Racing pleasure chasing
Aftershocks tremors right legs shaking
Still level pro now never been basic
Love on weekends is play thing

Alive looking deep in my eyes
Arise in the seal of the night
Feels like we drunk Hennessy love
Drunk of your touching  loosen up
Imagine say me ehn
What I like to do on weekends
Is to lock my self in a room with a pie that I really like
Watch films
Smoke a little something
We are not leaving the house the whole weekend mehn trust me
Imagine if  it's one of those Lagos weekends as well when it's raining
Ah God  make I get fuel for gen sha
You understand
Alive alive alive alive
