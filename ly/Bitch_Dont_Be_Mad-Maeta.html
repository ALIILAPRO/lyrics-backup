		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ain't mad
'Cause I know I'm the best shit that you'll have
Putting on Versace in black, black, black, black
Getting that, I told you I would
Remember that baby
Now that I'm laying in these sheets
Got 'em brand new
Feels so fucking good, without you
You wish you didn't play those games
Yeah, yeah
Bitch, don't be mad, oh, oh
Bitch, don't be mad, oh, oh

Now that I'm probably on a beach
I'm on all your screens, I've been making new friends, ah
Coming on top, top, drop, no time for blue shit
Yeah, you took your shot, block, block
Got blocked, you hate that you know
I've been there before, nah, nah
Bitch, don't be mad, yeah

And why your new girl hating on me?
She could have you to herself I wouldn't blink, blink, blink, blink
In fact I hope she does for me
Some sanity
Yeah

Now that I'm laying in these sheets
Got 'em brand new
Feels so fucking good, without you
You wish you didn't play those games
Yeah, yeah
Bitch, don't be mad, oh, oh
Bitch, don't be mad, oh, oh

Now that I'm probably on a beach
I'm on all your screens, I've been making new friends, ah
Coming on top, top, drop, no time for blue shit
Yeah, you took your shot, block, block
Got blocked, you hate that you know
I've been there before, nah, nah
Bitch, don't be mad, yeah

Oh no, no, no, no
Bitch, don't be mad at me, hmm, hmm, hmm
Ooh, no, no, no, no
Woo-ooh, ooh
Woo-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Woo-ooh, ooh-ooh
