		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here's the silhouette 
The face always turned away
The bleeding color gone to black
Dying like a day
Couldn't figure out what made you so unhappy
Shook your head to say no no no
And stopped for a spell
And stayed that way
Oh well, okay

I got pictures, I just don't see it anymore
Climbing hour upon hour through a total bore
With the one I keep where it never fades
In the safety of a pitch black mind
An airless cell that blocks the day
Oh well, okay

If you a get a feeling the next time you see me
Do me a favor and let me know
'Cause it's hard to tell 
It's hard to say
Oh well, okay
Oh well, okay
Oh well, okay
