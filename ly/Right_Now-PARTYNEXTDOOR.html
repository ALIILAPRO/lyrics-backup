		  I gotta keep it super real with ya, shawty
I gotta keep it real, real with ya

Yeah, you can be his forever baby, but tonight you mine
I pay you in cash baby, he just pay you mind
Tell me you love me baby, and tell me it's mine
'Cause timing is money, and money is time, yeah

I took my talents out to South Beach (South Beach)
Now my pockets looking so deep (so deep)
I'm on Biscayne, baby, skirting baby
Yeah, I'm on Biscayne, baby, skirting, baby 
Out in Miami, still getting faded
Shouts to the posse, we just so young and belated
I swear, I'm out here and winning, out here and getting it
That's just the specifics, baby, we get it, we get it

Just let your pussy talk, don't let this feeling fade
Girl, cut them bitches off 
They ain't got shit to say
Just let your pussy talk, don't let this feeling fade
Girl, cut them bitches off 
They ain't got shit to say

'Cause, you the baddest in the game right now
You can have the whole thang if you came right now (right now)
Quit fucking with them lames right now
I could put you on some game right now (yeah yeah)
Yeah, you the baddest in the game right now
You can have the whole thang if you came right now (right now)
Quit fucking with them lames right now
I could put you on some game right now (yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah)

Yeah you can be his forever baby, but tonight you mine
I pay you in cash baby, he just pay you mind
Tell me you love me baby, and tell me it's mine
'Cause timing is money, and money is time

Okay you got it 
Okay you got it
Champagne on that ass, just keep it poppin', keep it poppin'
'Cause you South Beach soaking for the Sauga City kid
Baby, I'm riding around and getting it
Swear I'm riding around, and they sweating it
'Cause I know, I got you for sure
Yeah, couple shots of patron 
had us right in the zone baby, yeah ooh
But that's just the specifics baby, we get it, we get it (oh-whoa)

Just let your pussy talk, don't let this feeling fade
Girl, cut them bitches off 
They ain't got shit to say
Just let your pussy talk, don't let this feeling fade
Girl, cut them bitches off 
They ain't got shit to say

'Cause, you the baddest in the game right now
You can have the whole thang if you came right now (right now)
Quit fucking with them lames right now
I could put you on some game right now (yeah yeah)
Yeah, you the baddest in the game right now
You can have the whole thang if you came right now (right now)
Quit fucking with them lames right now
I could put you on some game right now 

I'm in a room full of dancers, all of us cancers
One looks like Rita, and the other Rihanna
Baby, ooh
I'm in a room full of dancers, all of us cancers
One cleans the cash while the other one dances, oh-whoa

Yeah, you can be his forever, baby, but tonight you mine
I pay you in cash baby, he just pay you mind (alright alright)
Tell me you love me baby, and tell me it's mine
'Cause timing is money, and money is time
(So I say)

You the baddest in the game right now
You can have the whole thang if you came right now (right now)
Quit fucking with them lames right now
I could put you on some game right now (yeah yeah)
Yeah, you the baddest in the game right now
You can have the whole thang if you came right now (right now)
Quit fucking with them lames right now
I could put you on some game right now (yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah)

Go let them bitches talk, don't let this feeling fade
Go let them bitches talk, don't let this feeling fade
Go let them bitches talk, don't let this feeling fade
Go let them bitches talk, don't let this feeling fade
