		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On fragile legs
Felt the bottom drop out
I collapse and decay
cnd discover that I just don't belong
I know a place with enchantment all around
If you take the time to travel to the
End of the rainbow
Cuz this means nothing to me
cnd I'm dying to show you
cll the beautiful things I've seen...

I'm running back to wonderland
I don't care if you understand
I need to feel the magic, the madness,
The chaos, the passion
I'm drinking it all tonight
So let's go
Woah, woah
Won't you follow me down, won't you follow me down
To wonderland
Woah

River of tears
Let it carry me away
Got the current on my side
I'm sailing and I think I belong
Finally see through the looking glass through my own perspective
cnd I'm dying to show you
cll the beautiful things I've seen

I'm running back to wonderland
I don't care if you understand
I need to feel the magic, the madness,
The chaos, the passion
I'm drinking it all tonight
So let's go
Woah, woah
Won't you follow me down, won't you follow me down
To wonderland

CHORUS
