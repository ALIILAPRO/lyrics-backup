		  Yo
Ha, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it like this
Do it, do it (come on), do it, do it, do it (ooh!) Like this 

Mind's blowing up, yeah, let's get it
We gon' rush, rush hard, are you ready?
See the differences, we the greater
No control over me, can you hear me?
Ha, ha, yeah, uh
Follow my moves, come on, do it like this (do it like this)
Blow the whistle and let's go spread this love and P1ece
Don't laugh at the sun (huh)
'Cause you can't stop it burnin' uh (no, no)
I'm switching up the world, gets all of me before I die

To the top whatcha got bring it on
I will never be broken down
Light it up, let it burn like the sun
Shining bright 'til it kills the dark
Singing oh-oh
To the whole wide world oh-oh
Like a mighty echo oh-oh
You can choose how you wanna start

Come on, wake up, follow my lead
Do it like this
Don't you try to back up and just
Do it like this
We gon' dream it loud together
Do it like this, like this 
(Eh-oh) gotta do it like this

Put 'em up like this
Don't you dare be standing there 
Just do it like this
Throw your hands up, baby, come on
Do it like this, like this 
(Eh-oh) gotta do it like this

Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it like this
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it like this

Bite that jealousy no fake
That's green eyed
Do it like me go own way
Every day we play devil's little game of seek and hide
Coming in like a big wave

The door is wide open for you
Enjoy the ride, are you ready?
Wake yourself up if you're a sleeper
Showing off your strength, all your power

To the top whatcha got bring it on
I will never be broken down
Light it up, let it burn like the sun
Now my light's gonna change the world
Singing oh-oh
To the whole wide world oh-oh
Like a mighty echo oh-oh
You can choose how you wanna start

Come on, wake up, follow my lead
Do it like this
Don't you try to back up and just
Do it like this
We gon' dream it loud together
Do it like this, like this 
(Eh-oh) gotta do it like this

Put 'em up like this
Don't you dare be standing there 
Just do it like this
Throw your hands up, baby, come on
Do it like this, like this 
(Eh-oh) gotta do it like this

Oh, we don't really care about what they say
Oh, when we flip it, flip it, we're the one
Oh, together we're the dream team
We're the dream team
We're the, we're the dream team

We are illuminating
Ain't nobody can stop us yeah
Hold your hands here together now

Come on wake up follow my lead (hoo!)
Do it like this (hey)
We gon' make it loud and louder
Do it like this (my step)
Step up to the stage and come on
Do it like this, like this (pop it)
(Eh-oh) gotta do it like this

Put 'em up like this
Don't you give it up and leggo
Do it like this
Don't you try to run 'cause you can
Do it like this (right), like this (uh)
(Eh-oh) gotta do it like this (like this!)

Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it like this (hey, hey, hey)
Do it, do it, do it, do it, gotta do it like this
Gotta do it like this, gotta, gotta do it like this
(Eh-oh) gotta do it like this
