		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drain me dry
Down to the last drop
Pearls before swine, all flowers die
Tapped the last good vein
Don't know how to shut it off

Yeah, once you get me going
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop
Once you get me going
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to

All for your sake
Became the very thing that I hate
I lost my way
Spinning in an endless figure 8

I won't miss the feeling
My flimsy spine, unsuspicious mind
I was only being kind
But you mistook me for weak

And once I get going
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop going
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to

All for your sake
Became the very thing that I hate
I lost my way
Spinning in an endless figure 8

Candle light, candle light
Burning 'til broad daylight
Candle light, candle light
Burning at both ends tonight

How could I? How could I?
If I'm made of thin ice
How could I? How could I?
You'd be wise if you thought twice

All for your sake
Became the very thing that I hate
I lost my way
Spinning in an endless figure

What remains?
And now I think I'm losing my shape
Not a trace
No end and no beginning, figure 8
