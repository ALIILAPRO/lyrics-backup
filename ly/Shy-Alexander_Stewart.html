		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got this song in my head
I wanna sing to you
But I keep stalling instead
I dunno what to do
You make it hard to forget
I've gotta lot to lose
But I'm not giving up yet
The words are overdue
I can't get you outta my mind
I'm losing sleep tonight

I wanna be that guy
Stand up and tell you why
I need you to be mine
BUT you got me paralyzed
They tell me to be brave
What if you walk away
I know the things I should say

But I'm a little bit SHY SHY
Just a little bit SHY SHY

I would just grab your hand
and pull you close to me
When you're talking so fast
Know I'm listening
And when he don't call you back
Maybe its meant to be
Cause I want you so bad
I'd give anything
I cant get you out of my mind
Im losing sleep tonight
Oh god why don't I try

I wanna be that guy
Stand up and tell you why
I need you to be mine
BUT you got me paralyzed
They tell me to be brave
What if you walk away
I know the things I should say

But I'm a little bit SHY SHY
Just a little bit SHY SHY


Let me light it for ya
Like a SUPERNOVA
Losing my composure
So high

Lets not waste a feeling
Staring at the ceiling
Way my heart is beating

I think I'll be that guy
Stand up and tell you why
I need you to be mine
But you got me paralyzed
They told me to be brave
So don't you walk away
I know the things I should say

But Im a little bit SHY SHY
Just a little bit SHY SHY
Just a little bit SHY SHY
Just a little bit SHY
