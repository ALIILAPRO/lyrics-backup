		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thought you heard me
When I said "Stay here"
All the world has gone missing
Except the picture of you
Hanging in my head
Won't you please stay here?

Won't you stay? Won't you stay?
Won't you stay? (Won't you stay?)
Won't you stay? (Won't you stay?)

Won't you stay? (Won't you stay?)
Won't you stay? (Won't you stay?)
Won't you stay? (Won't you stay?)

Won't you stay? (Won't you stay?)
Won't you stay?

Won't you stay? (Ooh)
Won't you stay? (Ooh)
Won't you stay?

Ooh, ooh, ooh
