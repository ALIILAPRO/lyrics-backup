		  Hey, John
Yes, sir
Come on, let's have a drink
If you insist

It's quarter to three
There's no one in the place, except you and me
Set 'em up, Joe
You know, John, I got a little story that you ought to know
Wait 'til you hear 'bout this
We're drinking, my friend
To the end of a brief episode
I'm telling' you, that's what happened

Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road (here's to you, cheers)

I got the routine (oh no, you too)
So drop another nickel in the machine
Man, I'm feeling so bad (wow)
I wish you'd make that music dreamy and sad
I could tell you a lot (you too, right?)
But you've got to be true to your code (okay)

Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

You'd never know it, but buddy, I'm a kind of poet
Yeah, that's right, I've got a lot of things to say
And when I'm gloomy, you simply gotta listen to me
Until it's talked away

Let's have another drink
Bartender, fill it up again, will you?
That's how it goes

John, I know you're getting very anxious to close
(You don't know me well enough)
Tony, thanks for the cheer
I hope you don't mind me bending your ear
'Cause this torch that I found
Must be drowned or it soon might explode

Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road (take it home now)
That long (that long)
Long road

Let's leave it to it
Sleep tight
