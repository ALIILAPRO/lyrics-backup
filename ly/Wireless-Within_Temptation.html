		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's the ultimate sacrifice
Like a god you threw the dice
And then you left us all wireless

I started to wonder, wonder
Why is your smile so callous?
I'm here goin' under, under
Why is your heart so heartless?
I know, I know (I'm such a) fool

It's here, you wear the mark of shame
It's here, just like the mark of Cain

You never cared for us, just our halo
With its glorious force to draw more souls in
You never cared for us, our dreams evaporating
You left us here without a safety-pin
You never cared for us, just our halo

Our bloody halo
Our bloody halo

Try to elevate your demise
You got everything sanctified
All is shattered and is wireless

We're forced through the gauntlet, gauntlet
Like mice in a maze, we're running
We know we go under, under
Like moths to the flames, we're falling
We know, we know (it is) cruel

It's here, you wear the mark of shame
It's here, just like the mark of Cain

You never cared for us, just our halo
With its glorious force to draw more souls in
You never cared for us, our dreams evaporating
You left us here without a safety-pin
You never cared for us, just our halo
Our bloody halo

It will reach for you
It will try to turn you over
The feeling should wake you up
It will reach for you
When it all falls apart
It's frightening, they're watching you
Just watching you

It's here, you wear the mark of shame
You never cared for us, our dreams evaporating
You left us here without a safety-pin
You never cared for us, just our halo

Our bloody halo
Our bloody halo
