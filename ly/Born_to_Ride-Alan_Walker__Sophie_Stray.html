		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Head to my heart, hand on your chest
I have the best of intentions
I've played my part but who did the rest?
No wasting breath on redemption

Who will you love when it isn't me?
'Cause we fall apart inevitably
Sometimes what you want just ain't what you need
And you know me

Baby, I was born to run
Baby, I was born to ride
Ain't nobody ever gonna slow me down
'Cause I'm looking out for number one
Only me, myself and I
Ain't nobody ever gonna hold me down (oh my gosh)
Baby, I was born to ride

Into the wind, head in the sky
Yeah, baby, that's where I'm headed
But you fenced me in for too long a time
So, let's forgive and forget it

I'm not the one, it's easy to see
'Cause we fall apart inevitably
Sometimes what you want just ain't what you need
And you know me

Baby, I was born to run
Baby, I was born to ride
Ain't nobody ever gonna slow me down
'Cause I'm looking out for number one
Only me, myself and I
Ain't nobody ever gonna hold me down
Baby, I was born to ride
