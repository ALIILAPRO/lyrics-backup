		  Ha, I don't really do this diss shit, but, damn
Yeah, haha
Mabu, what the fuck?

Like, I'm Mr. Take Ya Bitch (bitch)
Take her for a trip (trip)
Fly her to New York, sign my name all on her tits (sheesh, haha)
Yes, I took his lady (lady)
I like blue faces so I took his baby

Fuck Blueface, I had to find a new bae
Yeah, aight, with my boo, fuck what you say (fuck what you say)
I might put it in his face, 'cause he wanna taste (sheesh)
This that newborn pussy, make my water break (hah)
Only thing that's broke is my fuckin' water (water)
Gave birth to my kid, but I hate his father (his father)
I used to fuck with blues, now I fuck with ones
Only fuck with white boy's that be totin' guns

I'm Mr. Take Ya Bitch (bitch)
Take her for a trip (trip)
Fly her to New York, sign my name all on her tits (sheesh, haha)
Yes, I took his lady (lady)
I like blue faces so I took his baby

And, no, this not a diss (diss)
But I know Wack 100 ain't gon' like this (this)
'Cause he fuck with snitches and I don't like kids (kids)
And he probably racist and don't like white kids (and don't like white kids)
Hi-Hi-Hit him in the face with the Drac' (Drac'), leave him (leave him)
Show him I take money to the grave, no breathin' (breathin')
Crodie six-deep, now I'm six-deep in his chick
I might take your whole flow and then take ya' bitch (and then take ya' bitch)

I'm Mr. Take Ya Bitch (bitch)
Take her for a trip (trip)
Fly her to New York, sign my name all on her tits (sheesh, haha)
Yes, I took his lady (lady)
I like blue faces so I took his baby

Yeah, aight
So I took his baby
I like blue faces so I took his baby
