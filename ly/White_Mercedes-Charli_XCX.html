		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't say you love me
'Cause I can't say it back
Don't say you're sorry
'Cause you've done nothing bad
Swallow my feelings
But won't swallow my pride
You know I've got a suit of armor on
You'll never see me cry
I hate the silence
That's why the music's always loud
So many problems, I try to drown them out
1000 bottles
Collecting souvenirs
You know it's so hard to admit it
But the only good inside of me is you

I take all of these blue and yellow pills
But nothing seems to last like you
You're chasing after something that you'll never catch
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Like a white Mercedes
Always been running too fast
When your heart is breaking, you keep on taking me back
Hate myself, I really love you
Hurting you feels like I'm hurting as well
All I know is I don't deserve you

You're so forgiving
My friends think you're the best
From the beginning, your friends said it wouldn't last
But this connection, it's something they don't see
You know it's so hard to admit it
But the best damn part of me was always you

I take all of these blue and yellow pills
But nothing seems to last like you
You're chasing after something that you'll never catch
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Like a white Mercedes
Always been running too fast
When your heart is breaking, you keep on taking me back
Hate myself, I really love you
Hurting you feels like I'm hurting as well
All I know is I don't deserve you

I don't deserve you
I don't deserve your love
One day I'll pull through and I'll be good enough
I don't deserve you
I don't deserve your love, oh your love, yeah
I don't deserve you
I don't deserve your love
One day I'll pull through and I'll be good enough
I don't deserve you
I don't deserve your love, oh your love

Like a white Mercedes
Always been running too fast
When your heart is breaking, you keep on taking me back
Hate myself, I really love you
Hurting you feels like I'm hurting as well
All I know is I don't deserve you
All I know is I don't deserve you
All I know is I don't deserve you
All I know is I don't deserve you
