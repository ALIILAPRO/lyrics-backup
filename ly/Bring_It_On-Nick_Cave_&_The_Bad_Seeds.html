		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This garden that I built for you
That you sit in now and yearn
I will never leave it, dear
I could not bear to return
And find it all untended
With the trees all bended low
This garden is our home, dear
And I got nowhere else to go

So bring it on
Bring it on
Every little tear
Bring it on
Every useless fear
Bring it on
All your shattered dreams
And I'll scatter them into the sea
Into the sea

The geraniums on your window sill
The carnations, dear, and the daffodil
Well, they're ordinary flowers
But they long for the light of your touch
And of your trembling will
Ah, you're trembling still
And I am trembling too
To be perfectly honest I don't know
Quite what else to do

So bring it on
Bring it on
Every neglected dream
Bring it on
Every little scheme
Bring it on
Every little fear
And I'll make them disappear

So bring it on, bring it on
Bring it on
Every little thing
Bring it on
Every tiny fear
Bring it on
Every shattered dream
And I'll scatter them into the sea

Woah
So bring it on, bring it on
Bring it on
Yeah, bring it on
Come on (come on)
Oh bring it on
Yeah come on, come on
Oh come, on
Bring it on
Every little fear
And I'll make them disappear 

Woah
Bring it on
Bring it on (bring it on)
Yeah bring it on
Bring it on, bring it on
Yeah bring it on
Every little fear
Bring it on
Every tiny tear
And I'll make them disappear
