		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My hardened heart is frozen
Weathered one too many winters
I no more smell the roses
I woke to watch 'em wither
I'm mister optimistic
But I'm missing my missus
So now I feel my ringless
Fingers reaching for my mistress
I'm afflicted with a wicked disease which I
Never wish to be rid of
This addiction got me stricken to my knees
With obsession yet I've never felt bigger
Once bitten, you're smitten
No kiddin' no way I'll leave
Unless I'm leaving with her
Is the magic real? Are we
A package deal? Slap
A stamp on it, cause they gonna ship us
Honey

I would never try to objectify
But you're a ten
And you got the gentlemen in line
What I lack in size, I can catch in eyes
So my lady claim your five foot seven prize
I'm a

Don't ever let her catch you
With your guard down
You can bet she'll get your heart
And have it carved out
With her skin tight silk stilted in stilettos
Crimson lips glisten in the shadows
Covered in curves, and she don't cut shallow
Got her talons in deep, keep your eyes up
Fellows bear your fangs, baby drain me dry
I won't even try to run away cause I'm your

Watch her hair blow back as
The wind just billows
Wrapped in satin are them massive pillows
No man in the Village ain't heard of her
If a Look Could Kill, she's a murderer
Think I'm hidin'? Nah, I'm really lurkin'
You're the vampire, but you got me thirstin'
So thick, let me be your feeder
Girl please turn me, I'll be your

Short man, tall woman hot damn, good-lookin'
I can't stand, I'm shooken
Lord help, I'm hooked because I'm
A short man, tall woman all glam, full bosom
Yes ma'am, your cushion
Was meant for all my pushin'
