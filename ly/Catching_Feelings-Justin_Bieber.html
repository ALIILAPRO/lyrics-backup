		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sun comes up on another morning
My mind never wakes up without you on it
And it's crazy to me, I even see you in my dreams
Is this meant to be?
Could this be happening to me, yeah?
We were best of friends since we were this high
So why do I get nervous every time you, walk by?
We would be on the phone all day
Now I can't find the words to say, to you
Now what am I supposed to do?

Could it be a possibility? I'm tryna see what's up
It's been me for you, and you for me, maybe now is time for us
Tryna keep it all together, but enough is enough
They say we're too young for love, but I'm
Catching feelings
Catching feelings (girl)

In my head we're already together
I'm good alone, but with you I'm better
I just want to see you smile
Just say the word and I'll
Be right there (be right there)
I ain't never going nowhere
I'm just tryna see where this can take us
'Cause everything about you girl is so contagious
I think I finally got it down
And all that's left to do now is get at the mirror
And say it to her, yeah

Could it be a possibility? I'm tryna see what's up
It's been me for you, and you for me, maybe now is time for us
Tryna keep it all together, but enough is enough
They say we're too young for love, but I'm
Catching feelings
Catching feelings girl

Should I tell her how I really feel? (How I really feel?)
Or should I move in close or just be still? (How will I know?)
'Cause if I take a chance, and I touch her hand, will everything change?
How do I know, if she feels the same, woah

Could it be a possibility? I'm tryna see what's up
It's been me for you, and you for me, maybe now is time for us
Tryna keep it all together, but enough is enough
They say we're too young for love, but I'm
Catching feelings
Catching feelings girl

Catching feelings
Catching feelings
