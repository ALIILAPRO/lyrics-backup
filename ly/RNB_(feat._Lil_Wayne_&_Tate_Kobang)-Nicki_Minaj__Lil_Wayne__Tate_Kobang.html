		  (28 shit)
Brrt, ayy

Creep, creep, my lil' secret, she don't have to be (have to be)
I just need you 'bout it, 'bout it like you Master P (Master P)
Please, that body, body is a masterpiece
Freak, I throw it deep then put that ass to sleep
Cheap, he was cheap, bitch, that wasn't me (me)
Cheat, had to cheat on him, and it's because of me (it's because of me)
Heat, when I'm in the streets, can't get one on me (on me)
She a real nigga bitch, I call her RNB (on me, yeah)

Ayo, real nigga bitch, call me RNB (ooh)
His ex bitches mad and they ought to be
Body a work of art like the Mona Li' (grrt)
See, it's a lot of y'all, only one of me (uh)
We don't make love, we be fuckin', that's G shit
If he gotta put a opp down, I don't see shit
I keep his secrets (yeah), I let him beast it
Kissin' on my thighs and my breast, he two-pieced it (ooh)
I just wanna watch him do his push-ups with his sweats on
Every time he hit it, he gon' nail it like a press-on
When I ride his dick, the only time he gettin' flexed on
Hit it from the back with my pumps and my dress on (ooh)
If you love me, baby, tattoo my whole name
We be laughin' while they hatin' 'cause they so lame
Other niggas shoot they shot, but they got no aim (no aim)

Creep, creep, my lil' secret, she don't have to be (whoa)
I just need you 'bout it, 'bout it like you Master P (Master P)
Please, that body, body is a masterpiece (masterpiece)
Freak, I throw it deep then put that ass to sleep (baow, baow, baow)
Cheap, he was cheap, bitch, that wasn't me (wasn't me)
Cheat, had to cheat on him, and it's because of me ('cause of me)
Heat, when I'm in the streets, can't get one on me (oh, oh, oh)
She a real nigga bitch, I call her RNB, yeah

She my RNB
Fuck her to some R&B, make me wanna sing
That shit sound like harmony when she moan for me
And that cat baby fat like Kamora Lee
Pop that pussy for a real nigga
I'ma mop that pussy like it's spilled, nigga
Make her pop that pussy like a pill, nigga
I'ma make her swap that pussy for a real nigga
If she give the opp pussy, I'ma kill that bitch
I don't adopt that pussy, bitch, I kidnap it
I make her lock that pussy and conceal that clit
Bought to buy a fake booty for a real-ass bitch, yeah

Creep, creep, my lil' secret, she don't have to be (whoa)
I just need you 'bout it, 'bout it like you Master P (Master P)
Please, that body, body is a masterpiece (oh)
Freak, I throw it deep then put that ass to sleep
Cheap, he was cheap, bitch, that wasn't me (wasn't me)
Cheat, had to cheat on him, and it's because of me ('cause of me)
Heat, when I'm in the streets, can't get one on me (oh)
She a real nigga bitch, I call her RNB, yeah (whoa)

Put your ring on, I hope you waiting for me, baby (Onika)
My friends say you ain't shit, they hatin' on my baby (baby)
Off the '42, we fuck around and make some babies (oh, no-no-no)
'Member when them boys pulled you over and we skated? (Baby)
Put your ring on, I hope you waiting for me, baby (brrt)
Your friends say I ain't shit, they hatin' on me, baby (oh)
We was on the block, now it's houses and they gated (oh)
I got a lot of bitches, they ain't fuckin' with my baby
Oh, oh, baby
Oh, baby, yeah
