		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the shade, darkened gaze, every color, it's dismay
Arid sky, it turns to grey, threshold of desertion.
Crimson shards, take their shape, to infect each passageway
Penetrate them into space, there is no survival

With every word you say, the spew that you create
And every smile you fake, you only want to suck me dry
With every breath I have, until there's nothing left
I'm gonna live until you suffocate and watch you die

Contents under pressure(contents under pressure)
Contents under pressure(contents under pressure)
Contents under pressure(contents under pressure)
Contents under pressure

Recreate, purge the hate, internal thoughts manipulate
Null & void, it turns to waste, submission, a diversion
Stark & stale, it rots away, like the sickness it creates
Left hand path that leads the way, record all our transgressions

With every word you say, the spew that you create
And every smile you fake, you only want to suck me dry
With every breath I have, until there's nothing left
I'm gonna live until you suffocate and watch you die

You've dealt the damage done,
You make your living on the blood of another host
Or maybe not enough
You're seeking refuge in the arms of another ghost

You've dealt the damage done,
You make your living on the blood of another host
Or maybe not enough
You're seeking refuge in the arms of another

You've dealt the damage done,
You make your living on the blood of another host
Or maybe not enough
You're seeking refuge in the arms of another ghost

You've dealt the damage done,
You make your living on the blood of another host
Or maybe not enough
You're seeking refuge in the arms of another

You're so predictable (a parasite of sorts)
You build me up to bring me down
You'll never watch me fall (the boughs of flesh is all)
You'll ever claim to take this time.

You're so predictable (a parasite of sorts)
You build me up to bring me down
You'll never watch me fall (the boughs of flesh is all)
You'll ever claim to take this time.

You suffer well, it serves you well
You'll burn in hell, and perish in the dust
You suffer well, it serves you well
You'll burn in hell, and perish in the dust
You suffer well, it serves you well
You'll burn in hell, and perish in the dust
You suffer well, it serves you well
You'll burn in hell, and perish in the dust

Dust!
Dust!
Dust!

With every word you say, the spew that you create

You're seeking refuge in the arms of another ghost

You've dealt the damage done,
You make your living on the blood of another host
Or maybe not enough
You're seeking refuge in the arms of another ghost
