		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lemme see you put your hearts up, yeah lemme see you put your hearts up, yeah
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world

You think you're so small
Like you're itty bitty.
Just one match in the lights of the city
Walking by strangers on the side of the street
Like a quarter in a cup'll get 'em off on their feet, like
You think you're never gonna make your mark
Sit back and watch the world while it falls apart, like
Out of sight out of mind, like, like
It's just a waste of time
Like, like, like

Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
If we give a little love
Maybe we can change the world
I said
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
Sing it if you with me
All you boys and all you girls

Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah

If we give a little love
Maybe we can change the world

Wishing on a shooting star in the sky
We can do anything if we try
Can't resurrect Ghandi
Resurrect but
If we put our heads together
We can do anything like
You don't have to be a billionare
You don't have to have much
To show how much care
Like give a wink
Give a kiss
Like give a little happiness
Like like like

Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
If we give a little love

Maybe we can change the world
I said
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
Sing it if you with me
All you boys and all you girls

Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah

If we give a little love
Maybe we can change the world

Don't let em bring you down now, down now
Don't let em bring you down now, down now
And get up in the love now love now
And get up in the love now love now
Don't let em bring you down now, down now
Don't let em bring you down now, down now
And get up in the love now love now
And get up in the love now love now

Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
If we give a little love
Maybe we can change the world
I said
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
Sing it if you with me
All you boys and all you girls

Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah

If we give a little love
Maybe we can change the world

Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah

If we give a little love
Maybe we can change the world

Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
