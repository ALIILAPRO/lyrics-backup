		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's no more bullfights (whoa, whoa)
Let 'em all fly, flight (whoa, whoa)
When the heavy gets light (whoa, whoa)

We can walk alone, feeling alright
We can walk alone, feeling alright (when the heavy gets light)
We can walk alone, feeling alright
We can walk alone, feeling alright (when the heavy gets light)

Yeah, we rested all week and I saw you that night
You were dancing in the park
Yeah, we rested all week and I saw with my own eyes
You were dancing in the park

We can walk alone, feeling alright
We can walk alone (when the heavy gets light)
Then you let me go
We can walk alone, feeling alright
We can walk (when the heavy gets light)
Then you let me go

Oh lover, that shit is not easy
Waiting for you on the side
Oh lover, that shit is not easy
Anymore

Ooh, ooh, ooh, then you let me go
Ooh (why I stay next to you, walk home)
Ooh (why I stay next to you, walk home)

We can walk alone, feeling alright
We can walk (when the heavy gets light)
Then you let me go
We can walk alone, feeling alright
We can walk (when the heavy gets light)
Then you let me go

Oh lover, that shit is not easy
Waiting for you on the side
Oh lover, that shit is not easy
Waiting for you on the side
Oh lover, that shit is not easy
Waiting here for you all night
Oh lover, that shit is not easy
Anymore

There's no more bull fights (when the heavy gets light)
We can walk alone, feeling alright
We can walk alone, feeling alright (when the heavy gets light)
We can walk alone, feeling alright (when the heavy gets light)
