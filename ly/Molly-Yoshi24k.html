		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shit is crazy how these niggas really think they fuckin' with me
Pull out futuristic whips, ya shits look ugly
I swear this life is lovely

Tell them no they cannot fuck with me
Watch how I pull out the foreigns to get out the jam
Steady thankful, I still pray to the east
While I'm whippin' it with both hands
Touch down out in Mali
Gotta touch the floor and feel the sand
She said her name Molly
She want her name, and she wanna dance
Left her outta body
All I did was touch her with my hand
Two nines they beside me but I rate shorty a ten
Boolin' with my Barbie
But you know that I ain't Ken
Dreaming of Bugattis
But for now I'll settle for a Lamb'

Woke up 30,000 feet up with my feet up
Only time I'm checkin' in
Is on a flight with a couple eaters
OT with the family
I need private jets with the heated seaters
Pull up real quick
Brand new two seater
Who wan' race me?
I flew OT she like Yoshi can you take me?
Why the flight attendant shorty told me she tryin' rape me
Give me all the money in the world
That shit won't faze me
I put all this love in the world
But still niggas hate me
Well fuck it let's do it
Day you try me you gon rue it
Niggas know I'm quick to pull it
On god like Nike I just do it
Dump, I blew it
Tried to plot but niggas blew it
You been plottin', I been knew it
Look now you rottin' in the sewage
They like don't do it
They like Yoshi please don't do it to 'em
All the young niggas on the block
You've been a good influence too
Fuck the haters let 'em niggas watch
And keep on doing you
Since a youngin' been too in tune
Money on me ain't nothin' new

There ain't no way they can stop me
Watch how I pull out the foreigns to get out the jam
Steady thankful, I still pray to the east
While I'm whippin' it with both hands
Touch down out in Mali
Gotta touch the floor and feel the sand
She said her name Molly
She want her name, and she wanna dance
Left her outta body
All I did was touch her with my hand
Two nines they beside me but I rate shorty a ten
Boolin' with my Barbie
But you know that I ain't Ken
Dreaming of Bugattis
But for now I'll settle for a Lamb'
