		<p>
		  Ok then
It was me back then still putting in that work try say I'm dead
Ok then
We was from that place where are armed and dangerous their in smoke
Ok then
Oh I ain't got drip that's cool that's nice but she's your on my
Ok then
Still sip champagne on a weekday DJ reload this if I'm snapping
And I snap too much these days for the rest of the set to be getting a track in
What happened I would say them man are trash but then maybe I'm bragging
If they saw what we did for the bankroll they'd understand why were never caught Lacking
Still make man dash like gatlin
Yeah
It was me and bro with the pattern
Pack of blemz with a short benz for a quick trip we on Saturn
Now the blems turned to Cuban cigars
And we chasing the figures
Circle that's inner
Where we come from places that aint city's
But we talk realer
Got charged with a next wave
How could I force it
Set man like triggered
VV's on neck that's jesus pieces
But we born sinners
Chains get tucked and it ain't on our side
I can't do this part time
I was in a four by four with a ten out of ten and a eighth of the thirty three
No stains on me just waves on me if I pull up she stays on me
Louis my coat and the bapes on feet
We lit at the crib like it's MTV
If I be honest I'm MVP
She can't have my name it's an LTD
Ok then
It was me back then still putting in that work try say I'm dead
Ok then
We was from that place man are armed and dangerous, their in smoke
Ok then
Oh I ain't got drip that's cool that's nice but she's on my
Ok then
True say I got model that's ex that I charged to the game I ain't talking bout Tesla
And she told me I'm way too distant I told her chill bae I been a slow texter
Now they all tell me I'm next up
Wanna move like me when I flex up
If it comes to the work I'm different I been in the lab tryna get it like Dexter
Now she wanna call me arrogant don't matter when she's at my apartment
Shy girl with the first name Maddison bit batty girl now I work at the garden
Trust If step then I do it like harden meaning that I get way further
If I send this boy location then he'll be right there hands on burner
Just look how them boys on guard
They ain't even religious
Last year was about expansion
This year ima serve this vision
That's Spades on a golden bottle we sip that slow
When we getting this work in
Believe I ain't buying no birkins
And she still come get in person
