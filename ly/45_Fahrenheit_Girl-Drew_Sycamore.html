		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Ooh, yeah
Ah
Yeah

Took another ride on the west side
Came across a guy with this skin like the snow
Someone stole his soul in the eighties, he said
Don't know what he meant 'bout the ladies he bit
Wanted to be his in a heartbeat
I said, "Make me one of you, I can always be yours" (always be yours)

Leave me to bleed
'Til I go blind
Swallow me whole
Dead but alive

I'll be your forty-five Fahrenheit girl
Forty-five Fahrenheit girl
Forty-five Fahrenheit girl (forty, forty-five)
I'll be your forty-five Fahrenheit girl (forty, forty-five girl)
Mm

Told me 'bout his childhood in Memphis
Only twenty-five telling tales of the war
He said he could tell I was fearless
I said, "Come and taste the veins on the side of my neck
Then I could be yours in the next life
Make me one of you, I could always be yours" (always be yours)

Child outta dark
His breath is cold
Eyes that will kill
But only your soul

I'll be your forty-five Fahrenheit girl (I'll be your forty-five)
Forty-five Fahrenheit girl (I'll be your forty-five)
Forty-five Fahrenheit girl (forty, forty-five)
I'll be your forty-five Fahrenheit girl (forty, forty-five girl)

(I'll be your forty-five)
(I'll be your forty-five girl)
(I'll be your forty-five)
Forty-five
