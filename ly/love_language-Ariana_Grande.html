		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whoa, I know you're probably thinkin', "What's the use?" 
I promise it's the little things that you do 
That make me wanna give it all to you 
You know I do, babe 

You soothe me
You hold it down with every word you speak, oh babe
Baby, been a minute since I had somethin' so sweet

If you gon' keep speakin' my love language 
You can talk your shit all night 
You're the medication when I'm feelin' anxious 
That's the kind of shit I like 
Teach me how to love you 
I'm unlearnin' what ain't right
I want you to keep speakin' my love language 
Baby, talk your shit all night 

Why 
Would I double back or do the same thing twice?
A question, somethin' that I can't deny 
Left my baggage at the door, I'll claim you mine
All mine 

You soothe me 
You hold it down with every word you speak, oh honey
Baby, it's been a minute since I had somethin' so sweet, mm

If you gon' keep speakin' my love language 
You can talk your shit all night 
You're the medication when I'm feelin' anxious 
That's the kind of shit I like 
Teach me how to love you 
I'm unlearnin' what ain't right
I want you to keep speakin' my love language 
Baby, talk your shit all night 

Baby, pardon my French
But could you speak in tongues?
Never lost in translation
'Cause you know what I want, boy
Treat it just like Givenchy (Givenchy)
It's expensive to taste 
Ain't no need to remind ya 
It's AG in your face 

If you gon' keep speakin' my love language 
You can talk your shit all night 
You're the medication when I'm feelin' anxious 
That's the kind of shit I like 
Teach me how to love you 
I'm unlearnin' what ain't right
I want you to keep speakin' my love language 
Baby, talk your shit all night 

Head over my shoes like whoa
Know you like an inside joke
Runnin' 'cause you just my speed
'Less you want it in slow-mo (in slow-mo)
I'm not what you had before (had before)
Your ex-girlfriend don't want no smoke (no smoke)
I ain't tryna sign no lease
I'm just gon' make you my home
