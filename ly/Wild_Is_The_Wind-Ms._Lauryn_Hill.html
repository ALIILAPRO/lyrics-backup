		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love me, love me, love me, say you do
Let me fly away with you
For my love is like the wind
And wild is the wind
Give me more than one caress
Satisfy this hungriness
Let the wind blow through your heart
For wild is the wind you touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
And you kiss me
And with your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me all things to me
Don't you know you're life it'self
Like a leaf clings to a tree
Oh my darling, cling to me
For we're creatures of the wind
And wild is the wind so wild is the wind
And wild is the wind you touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins you kiss me
And with your kiss my life begins
Daddy you're spring to me all things to me
Don't you know you're life it'self
Like a leaf clings to a tree
Oh my darling, cling to me
For we're creatures of the wind
And wild is the wind so wild is the wind
So wild so wild is the wind
So wild is the wind
