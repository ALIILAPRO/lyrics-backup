		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, ayy, ayy (and this beat from Cash, not from YouTube)
Ayy, ayy 
G-locks for the team, but we ain't sharin' lean
Run through 50K, I ain't save it 'cause it was easy
Pretty girl, where you stay? Might as well be with me
AMG the S, codeine cowboy in the flesh
Caught up like the rest, but they look up to me
Sincere but it go left, tryna burn the bridge that's left, huh
Treat her like the one, tryna turn me to a two
I don't keep receipts, say that shit, she knows it's true

Call me while I'm sleep, cry baby girl, I'm stuck on you
Slimey boy, had you up on me, ignore my calls while you in the stu'
Act funny when you ain't into me, hangin' in my circle too
Miss that ho, I'm raising Hell, break a ho like Memphis Inn
Bentley's talkin' to myself, Ghazi said he sendin' help
Niggas tryna bring me down, really wanna send a belt
I paid three hundred for a line, 'cause they look like they needed help
How you thin I'm talkin' down when I'm the one that needed help?
HEMI boy but I got a driver, he know his backseat melt
Live too fast, need a deep breath
Live too fast, can't even help

Ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy
G-locks for the team, but we ain't sharin' lean
Run through 50K, I ain't save it 'cause it was easy
Pretty girl, where you stay? Might as well be with me
AMG the S, codeine cowboy in the flesh
Caught up like the rest, but they look up to me
Sincere but it go left, tryna burn the bridge that's left
Treat her like the one, tryna turn me to a two
I don't keep receipts, say that shit, she knows it's true
I don't keep receipts, say that shit, she knows it's true
