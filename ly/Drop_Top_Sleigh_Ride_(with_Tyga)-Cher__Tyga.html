		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, are you ready to roll?
From L.A. to the North Pole

Are you ready?
I'm a jingle bell away
And these reindeer just won't wait
Honey, I can't let this party start without you
Are you ready
For some sugar and some spice?
Drippin' diamonds on the ice
If you've never touched the sky, then you're about to

Hey, are you ready to roll?

There won't be no silent night, it's Christmas
Turn it up, it's a vibe, it's Christmas
Tearin' up the town on a candy-cane high
Goin' out tonight on a drop-top sleigh ride

Ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride

Gettin' louder
Feel the bass with every bounce
There's a crowd in every house
Singin' "Let It Snow" to celebrate the season

Hey, are you ready to roll?
From L.A. to the North Pole

There won't be no silent night, it's Christmas
Turn it up, it's a vibe, it's Christmas
Tearin' up the town on a candy-cane high
Goin' out tonight on a drop-top sleigh ride

Ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride

Hey, are you ready to roll?
From Oakland to the North Pole
Everyone drop-top it low
Shake it up like a snowglobe

Uh, it's jinglin', baby (yeah)
Gifts by the tree in the livin' room, baby (woo)
Feelin' like a kid in a candy store, baby
Gotta open one, it's drivin' me crazy (yeah)
Sit on my lap, your Santa's here (here)
Red suit, no beard (no)
Throwin' money to the chandelier
Yeah, I make it rain, dear
Blitzen, Prancer, girl, keep dancin'
Dasher, Vixen, feelin' romantic
Will you ride my sleigh tonight? (Will you?)
Make sure the kids is alright
Okay (okay), let's go (let's go, woo)
Catch me under mistletoe (mwah)
We can make angels in the snow
Now shake that thing like a snowglobe, ayy

There won't be no silent night, it's Christmas
Turn it up, it's a vibe, it's Christmas
Tearin' up the town on a candy-cane high
Goin' out tonight on a drop-top sleigh ride

Ride, ride, ride, ride (it's Christmas)
Ride, ride, ride, ride (it's Christmas)
Ride, ride, ride, ride (it's Christmas)
Ride, ride, ride, ride (it's Christmas)
