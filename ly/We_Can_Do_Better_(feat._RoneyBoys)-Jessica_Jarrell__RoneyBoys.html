		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Turning on the morning news
Hearing stories of abuse
It's not ok
Human rights stripped away

Massive crowds on the street
Marching for equality
We must stop and pray
For the state of our world today

Let the light upon your skin
Ignite the passion from within
To spread some happiness
Injustice can't win

We can do better
Together we can win
Stop the violence
It kills the spirit within
Can we heal what's wrong
Find a way to get along
We've got one life to live
And so much love inside to give
We can do better

There's nowhere that's safe
Even within a sacred space
It's not ok
Will this fear ever go away

When we kiss our kids goodbye
The innocence in their eyes
God, keep them safe
May they live another day

Count your blessings today
Hold your loved ones tight and say
I love and cherish you
Our hearts should lead the way

We can do better
Together we can win
Let's stop the violence
It kills the spirit within
Can we heal what's wrong
Find a way to get along
We've got one life to live
And so much love inside to give
We can do better

Oh oh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
We can do better
Change is what we need

Oh oh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
We can do better
It starts with you and me
We can do better.
