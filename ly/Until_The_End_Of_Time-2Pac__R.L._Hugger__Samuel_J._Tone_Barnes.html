		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come on

Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side
Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
And even though we both came from the same places
The money and the fame made us all change places
How could it be? Through the misery that came to pass
The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask for currency
But you could run to me when you need and I'll never leave
Honestly, someone to believe in, as you can see
It's a small thing to a true, what could I do?
Real homies help you get through
And come to knew he'd do the same thang if he could
'Cause in the hood true homies make you feel good
And half the times we be actin' up call the cops
Bringin' a cease to the peace that was on my block
It never stops, when my mama ask me will I change, I tell her
"Yeah, but it's clear I'll always be the same until the end of time"

Take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again (until the end of time)
So I can fly (I can fly, I can fly, I can fly)
'Til the end of time ('til the end of time)
'Til the end of time (time, 'til the end of time)

Please Lord forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know, I don't hang around the house much
This all-night, money makin' got me outta touch, shit
Ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
My attitude got me walkin' solo, ride out alone in my lo-lo
Watchin' the whole world move in slow-mo
For quiet times, disappear, listen to the ocean
Smokin' Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world?
My phony homie had a baby by my old girl
But I ain't trippin', I'm a player, I ain't sweatin' him
I sex his sister, had her mumble like a Mexican
His next of kin, no remorse it was meant to happen, besides rappin'
Only thing I did good was scrappin', until the end of time

So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again (until the end of time)
So I can fly (I can fly, I can fly, I can fly)
'Til the end of time ('til the end of time)
(Time, 'til the end of time)

Please take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again (until the end of time)
So I can fly (I can fly, I can fly, I can fly)
'Til the end of time ('til the end of time)
(Time, 'til the end of time)

Now who's to say if I was right or wrong?
To live my life as an outlaw all along
Remain strong in this planet full of player haters
They conversate but death row full of demonstrators
And in the end drinkin' Hennessey made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow, eliminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to bleed (please, please, please)
While beggin' me to keep the peace (please)
What I can see is closer to achieve
In times of danger don't freeze, time to be a G
Follow my lead, I'll supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the trainin' to make a G
Remember me, as an outcast, outlaw
Another album out, that's what I'm about more
Gettin' raw 'til the day I see my casket
Buried as a G while the whole world remembers me until the end of time

Lord, take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again (once again, once again)
(Until the end of time) so I can fly 
(I can fly, I can fly, I can fly) so I can fly away, away, away, away
'Til the end of time (away, away, away)
(Time, 'til the end of time) 'til the end of

Lord, take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again (once again)
(Until the end of time) so I can fly 
(I can fly, I can fly, I can fly)
'Til the end of time ('til the end of time)
(Time, 'til the end of time)

If an angel comes down and takes me away
Memories of me and my songs will always
(Until the end of time) because time
(I can fly, I can fly, I can fly)
'Til the end of time
'Til the end of time

Maybe it's the thug in me
