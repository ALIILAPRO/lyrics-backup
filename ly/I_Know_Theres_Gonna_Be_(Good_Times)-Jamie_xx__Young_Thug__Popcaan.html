		  Good times, good times
There's gonna be good times, good times
I know there's gonna be

Worth every day 'til we meet ends
Haffi tun it up pon di weekends
Buss a toast fi ya real friend
Tell me what you drinkin'

I know there's gonna be good times
(And he runnin' up all the money on these hoes) there's gonna be good times
There's gonna be good times, there's gonna be good (good time, yeah)
(Good time, ayy)

Good times, there's gon' be some good times
Remember we used to pull up and let 'em fight? That's that hood time (woo)
Remember when I used to grab on that ass when it was that 'bout wood time? (Fatty)
Yeah if that bitch walk up trippin' she get that mush time (move bitch)
I don't waste time, I don't waste time
I don't have patience, baby
She gon' get on top of this dick
And she gon' squish it like squish, then go fast, she Speed Racer
We gon' ball, Walter Payton (skrrt)
She my boss like I'm Prince's son
Come here bae, I'ma listen
I let her write me my suggestions (hey)
Pop quiz, it's a pop quiz (pop it)
All my money comin' clean, you can't pop this (no)
She got that pussy locked up like locksmith (damn)
Watch her come to my lights like a reindeer (ice)
Me and papi on the same pills (papi)
My diamonds could never stand still (no way)
Where you goin'? Can you come here? (Come here, baby)
I'll always take you back for your sex appeal (good time, hey)

Come have a good time, buss a bad wine (I know there's gonna be good times)
Know say you wan' gimme somethin' long time (there's gonna be good times)
Me deal with di scene rough, somethin' like crime (there's gonna be good times)
I mek ya sing this line (oh yes, baby)

I know there's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times (say what I did, you know bro) (good time, ayy)
There's gonna be good times (therefore, good times)
There's gonna be good

I'ma ride in that pussy like a stroller (uh)
I'll survive in a mothafuckin' gutter (uh)
That's my mothafuckin' woadie, like the Noila
And I'm comin' red like Coke-Cola (red)
I'ma have a very good time
I swear to God I can't never sideline 'lil shorty (what you tell her Thugger?)
She say she likes all of a nigga's rhymes (and what, Thugger?)
Where is my phone? That pussy callin' 
I want you to pass it to Thugger Thugger
Even in the summer time me and lil shawty cuddle (woo)
I swear to God I'ma tip you, don't got to struggle (ayy)
Baby girl sit it down, you not known like an usher (ayy)
I told lil' mama I don't bite but my teeth do
I wanna control you like voodoo
I'm steady screaming free Unfunk and DuLu (and, what?)
Every time I have a good time you do too (good time, hey)

Come have a good time, buss a bad wine (I know there's gonna be good times)
Know say you wan' gimme somethin' long time (there's gonna be good times)
Me deal with di scene rough, somethin' like crime (there's gonna be good times)
I mek ya sing this line (oh yes, baby)

I know there's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times 
There's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good (good time, ayy)

I know there's gonna be good times (good times, there's gon' be some good times)
There's gonna be good times (And he runnin' up all the money on these hoes)
There's gonna be good times (good time, ayy)
There's gonna be good (good times)

Ahh (oh na), ohh, oh
Ahh (oh na), ohh, oh

(Naw that was too funny, haha)
(Oh my days)
(I'm tryna catch a little joke, you know)
(I'm tryna catch me some time)
(It was good, you know?)
We enjoyed it but we never used to like rave to it
