		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't you know
The time flows quickly
So don't let go
And hold me tightly

Don't you know
The time flows quickly
Just don't let go

Just don't let go

Don't let go

Don't you know
The time flows quickly
So don't let go
Hold me tightly

Don't you know
The time flows quickly
Just don't let go

Don't let go

Just don't let go
