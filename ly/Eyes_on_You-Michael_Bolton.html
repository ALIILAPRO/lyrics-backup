		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have never seen the moon light up the sky like this
Waking from a dream seeing everything I almost missed
I can feel my heart, it's finally beating
I was in the dark 'til now

I took every road that I could take
I broke every rule that I could break
I thought I was the one I was living for
I wasn't even searching anymore
I stepped out on the ledge but I'd never fall
Didn't worry 'bout a thing, thought I had it all
This love was a feeling I never knew
'Til I laid eyes on you
'Til I laid eyes on you, oh

I have never seen all the colors in the world like this
Life is something sweet, like the miracle of you exists
I can feel my heart it's finally beating
Living the dark 'til now

I took every road that I could take
I broke every rule that I could break
I thought I was the one I was living for
I wasn't even searching anymore
I stepped out on the ledge but I'd never fall
Didn't worry 'bout a thing, thought I had it all
This love was a feeling I never knew
'Til I laid eyes on you

You woke me up, you showed me love
Are the reasons that I believe in us
I didn't know beautiful 'til now

I took every road that I could take
I broke every rule that I could break
I thought I was the one I was living for
I wasn't even searching anymore
I stepped out on the ledge but I'd never fall
Didn't worry 'bout a thing, thought I had it all (had it all)
This love was a feeling I never knew
This love was a feeling I never knew
'Til I laid eyes on you
'Til I laid eyes on you, oh
'Til I laid eyes on you, oh
'Til I laid eyes on
