		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Born in Scotland raised in Wyndford bought from Hull City
Learnt to cross did not give up the assist king is he
Told his pop when i grow up i wanna play for LFC
Andy Rob Robertson Robertson

We do better with this Scotsman playing in our team
He's come so far since Queens Park and it's there for all to see
He would run 500 miles just to help the team
Andy Rob Robertson Robertson 
Andy Rob Robertson Robertson

Andy Robbo Andy Robbo Andy Robertson
Andy Robbo Andy Robbo Andy Robertson
Andy Robbo Andy Robbo Andy Robertson
Andy Rob Robertson Robertson

Born in Glasgow played for Celtic bought from Hull City
He'll run all day cause that's his way
And he loves a custard cream
The best left back the world did see
And he plays for LFC
Andy Rob Robertson Robertson

We can't lose with this guy playing in our team
He's got pace and an A class crossing ability
Strikers fear him goats adore he even took out Messi
Andy Rob Robertson Robertson 
Andy Rob Robertson Robertson

Andy Robbo Andy Robbo Andy Robertson
Andy Robbo Andy Robbo Andy Robertson
Andy Robbo Andy Robbo Andy Robertson
Andy Rob Robertson Robertson
