		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like a new storm you take me to the exile of my mind 
You're my savior, the unknown, somewhere before my eyes

This is me following your foot steps
Trying to get access into the end
Is it you, the perfect morning after? 
Or just yesterday again? 

I've been searching, I've been waiting for the best day of my life 
Can you feel me, can you save me on the best day of my life? 
No more breaking, breaking, breaking bad, wanna wake up, wake up from the dead
I'll be fightin', I'll be dyin' for the best day of my life

I'll take it to forever and you're burning in my hands
My distraction, my beginning, can't come no matter when

This is me following your foot steps 
Trying to get access into the end
Is it you, the perfect morning after? 
Or just yesterday again? 

I've been searching, I've been waiting for the best day of my life
Can you feel me, can you save me on the best day of my life? 
No more breaking, breaking, breaking bad, wanna wake up, wake up from the dead
I'll be fightin', I'll be dyin' for the best day of my life

Life
The best day of my life 
The best day of my life 
For the best day of my life 
For the best day of my life

I've been hanging on, I'm becoming strong on the best day of my life
This is how I feel, this our mystery on the best day of my life? 
No more breaking, breaking, breaking bad, wanna wake up, wake up from the dead 
I'll be fightin', I'll be dyin' for the best day of my life

For the best day of my life
