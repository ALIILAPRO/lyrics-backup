		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cuz right now baby I'm in the city
This is how the night sound
You say that I been too busy
I said it's my lifestyle
Moving too fast I need to slow down
If you ready we gon find out
You waited for me so long, you ain't moved on
Now that I'm here, all that you want is
Promise
No one else on my mind right now
Do it just how you like right now
You said baby don't lie right now
But I promise
On my way to the club right now
You can't wait for my love right now
Do you wanna go up right now
Up right now
Up right now
Up right now
Let's party till it's over
Yeah your body's all I want
And you come through when I want it
Tonight, girl I'm all yours
Drinking way too often
Ain't stopping till it's over
And I swear I'm being honest
Tonight girl I'm all yours
Tonight girl I'm all yours
Promise
No one else on my mind right now
Do it just how you like right now
You said baby don't lie right now
But I promise
On my way to the club right now
You can't wait for my love right now
Do you wanna go up right now
Up right now
Up right now
Up right now
I don't wanna fall in love no more
I don't wanna fall in love no
I don't wanna fall in love no more
I don't wanna fall in love no
Oh you wanna go up right now?
And you wanna take drugs right now?
Can we fuck up the club right now?
We going, we going right now
Oh you wanna go up right now?
And you wanna take drugs right now?
Can we fuck up the club right now?
We going, we going right now
