		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Spent too many nights
Drunk as fuck with you baby
Yeah, you tryna have my baby
I might turn you to my lady
What’s wrong? What’s right?
Baby girl, I done seen things
Nightmares I done seen, yeah
Yeah, we moving like the dream team
I ain’t doubling back for nothing
I got air on the back of that Hummer
Feel like MJ, I’m stacking this summer
Woo
Hit the three-peat I go take a break
I just copped me a house by the lake
I just got me a spouse in the Bay
Feel like Lou when I step out the bank
What I’m smoking, no question, it stank
I got rich and I put ‘em on game
Fuck her good so she tatted the name
I be knocking the bed outta frame
Mama want her the Bentley with wings
Know the name, serve plenty of fiends
Let her pick out whatever she need
Yeah yeah yeah
Spent too many nights
Drunk as fuck with you baby
Yeah, you tryna have my baby
I might turn you to my lady
What’s wrong? What’s right?
Baby girl, I done seen things
Nightmares I done seen, yeah
Yeah, we moving like the dream team
When you popping, they blow up the phone
Only hit me when I’m in the zone
I be tryna make hits with my bros
Overseas, do a couple of shows
SORIANO just switching the tone
With these lyrics I’m flipping a switch
But these hoes don’t wan leave me alone
Look
I told my brother we bout to go get it, and look what happened, man we did it again
I told my fam that it is what it is, you ain’t gotta fuck with it, no need to pretend
Always knew I was gon’ get it, don’t need to remind you again and again and again
Waking up, all I’m thinking bout is winning
That’s been my goal from the very beginning
Spent too many nights
Drunk as fuck with you baby
Yeah, you tryna have my baby
I might turn you to my lady
What’s wrong? What’s right?
Baby girl, I done seen things
Nightmares I done seen, yeah
Yeah, we moving like the dream team
