		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shielded by a curtain of evergreen
Dwelling under the cypress tree
I've been waiting here since August
Now snow lies upon the branch
Falling on me like a tiny avalanche
It reminds me of how I fell for you
Although the fall left me black and blue

Oh, I'm still waiting for you
Oh, under the tree as lovers do
Oh, I'm slowly being hidden by litterfall
Oh, I'm slowly vanishing once and for all

I'm stuck in the ground, I've lingered for too long
And grew my own roots, I cannot move on
I have become a weeping tree on a gloomy day
Not green, nor yellow, but withering grey

Oh, I'm still waiting for you
Oh, under the tree as lovers do
Oh, I'm all covered up by litterfall
And grown into a withering tree once and for all

But then there was the evergreen
Who as I sang my elegy
Only heard a beautiful melody
Oh, then there was the evergreen
Who's always been there for me
And fell in love with my entity
Our roots intertwined
And my leafless exterior
Came back to life
