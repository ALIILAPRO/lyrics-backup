		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The ancient pharaohs were not too bright they say,
But they made one contribution that I live by to this day,
It's the food pyramid,
And its approved the USDA

Oh grains of the foundation,
So please take my advice,
Of five to eleven servings of bread, cereal or rice,
Three to five of vegetables,
And four fruits is best,
Their antioxidensty fiber help you to digest,
Three servings of yogurt, milk and cheese,
Will help your bones and subsidize the cattle industry

A body needs to grow,
And grow and take regimes,
Why meat can be a tasty treat,
Like fish or even beans

And when you eat your sweets,
Make sure you try,
To limit your servings,
Or you'll

Die!

Everybody!

My body is a pyramid that's made of healthy foods,
So do what we say,
(Yeah!)
Eat right every day,
(Food!),
I, love, you

Buy American!
