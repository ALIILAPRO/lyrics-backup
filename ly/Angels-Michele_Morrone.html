		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A thousand color paintings you have made for us
When I'm done, look at your photograph
Counting all the days we have been separate
I disappear and burn like my damn cigarette
I just wanna fall asleep and dream of you

But listen I wanna tell you that
You should never be scared
Whenever you need I will be there
And it doesn't matter where or when

I wanna wrap you with my wings
And fly like angels with no fears
Chasing the stars until we get so
Tired that we nap on the cloud
In me, you will always find hope

It's all about you, it's alright, it's alright
Two bodies, one soul, it's you and I, it's you and I

Oh, one day you'll understand what I wanted to say
I have no faults in life sometimes a little strange
But I can't stop walking 'cause I live for you

But listen I wanna tell you that
You should never be scared
Whenever you need I will be there
And it doesn't matter where or when
Oh, I wanna wrap you with my wings
And fly like angels with no fears
Chasing the stars until we get so
Tired that we nap on the cloud

It's all about you, it's alright, it's alright
Two bodies, one soul, it's you and I, it's you and I
