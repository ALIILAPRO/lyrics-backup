		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing 'bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, the way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing 'bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby it's no mystery why I surrender
Girl you got everything

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing 'bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, the way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing 'bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
Your smile, your lips and girl the list goes on and on and on

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing 'bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, the way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing 'bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
Your dance, your drive, you make me feel alive

The way you talk, the way you tease
By now I think you see
There ain't nothing 'bout you that don't do something for me
