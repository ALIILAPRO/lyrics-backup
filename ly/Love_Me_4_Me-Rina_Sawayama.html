		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Babe, I've been telling you
If you can't love yourself
How are you going to love somebody else?

Everyday I wanna start over
'Cause I remind me of me
At my worst, all in my mirror
Tell me lies, say it nice

Gotta do right, be nice
Smile just like a lady
I gotta work hard
Make up, head up like a star
I gotta be that angel
Good girl, soft and sexy
Well, I don't care
I don't care who you are

You wanna love me for me
If I made it, I made it easy
You wanna love me for me
If I made it, I made it easy

Every time I let you win
My mind, you find remedies
But you can't fix me, you can't win
So goodbye, goodbye

Gotta do right, be nice
Smile just like a lady
I gotta work hard
Make up, head up like a star
I gotta be that angel
Good girl, soft and sexy
I don't care
I don't care who you are

You wanna love me for me
If I made it, I made it easy
You wanna love me for me
If I made it, I made it easy

"If you can't love yourself
How are you going to love somebody else?"

You wanna love me for me
If I made it, I made it easy
You wanna love me for me
If I made it, I made it easy

You wanna love me for me
If I made it, I made it easy
You wanna love me for me
If I made it, I made it easy
