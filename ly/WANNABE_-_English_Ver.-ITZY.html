		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're nagging non-stop
But I'm my own boss
Gotta let me work it out for myself, don't need your guidance

I do what I wanna
Just leave me to own my own mistakes
And let me breathe 
I need a little freedom to make big girl decisions

I'm so bad, bad
I'ma get all I can get
'Cause good girls always finish last
I'm done with trying to please somebody else

I'm just on my way
Don't need you in my space
Sorry, if I let it slip, but
I don't care what you say

Won't pretend to be someone I'm not
Yeah, I'll be staying true to myself
I wanna be me, me, me
I won't change, I'm loving what I got
'Cause I know I'm perfect just the way I am
I wanna be me, me, me

I don't wanna be somebody
Just wanna be me, be me
I wanna be me, me, me
I don't wanna be somebody
Just wanna be me, be me
I wanna be me, me, me (action)

Errbody, errbody, errbody teaching me (all eyes on me)
Gotta do this and that, always interfering (don't touch me)
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Got flaws, so take it or leave it
I'ma do my thang, just do your thing
'Cause I'm the one and only

They all think that they can be the judge of my life
Nothing else to do but pick apart, criticize
Sorry, I ain't got time for your meaningless opinions
It's none of your business, I do my own business
Won't pretend to be someone I'm not
Yeah, I'll be staying true to myself
I wanna be me, me, me

I won't change, I'm loving what I got
'Cause I know I'm perfect just the way I am
I wanna be me, me, me (hey, hey)

No matter if you love me or hate me (hey, hey)
I wanna be me, one and only me
If you feel me, turn this beat up
I wanna be me, me, me

Won't pretend to be someone I'm not
Yeah, I'll be staying true to myself
I wanna be me, me, me
I won't change, I'm loving what I got
'Cause I know I'm perfect just the way I am
I wanna be me, me, me

I don't wanna be somebody
Just wanna be me, be me
I wanna be me, me, me
I don't wanna be somebody
Just wanna be me, be me
I wanna be me, me, me
