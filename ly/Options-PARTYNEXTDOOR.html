		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Met you in Houston, but you're from Atlanta
No you're from Pennsylvania or somethin'
Fuck all I know is, you're hot and you know this
You make it easy to blow this, you know this, damn
Twerkin' her ass for me
Shaped like a glass for me
It's like God knew what I liked (damn)
Damn right, I know what I like
Sex tape selfie you an actress
Tryna get you wet like a baptist

Girl I need all your love right now, but I'll wait
'Cause I don't wanna seem like I'm hatin'
Baby girl, I really ain't hatin'
You've got options and I'm here to let you know

You got options, bae
Yeah, you got options, bae
Know-know-know you got options, bae
PARTY is an option, bae
Fuck the hug and kisses, bae
This is for my real bitches
Heard you got options
Tell that hatin' nigga to shut the fuck up

Tell that hatin' ass nigga to shut the fuck up
Tell that hatin' ass nigga to shut the fuck up
Fuck all the huggin' and kisses, I fuck all they bitches
Shorty but you not a bitch, you the one I get money with

And you like intrigue me, like you make me want more
Like you make me wanna like be with you
And I don't know how you do it, because no
I've never felt like this about a guy
'Cause guys are so fucking clingy and annoying to me, it pisses me off
They do everything to make me want them, you do the total opposite
You do everything to make me like want to run away from you (yeah, yeah)

You hardly smoke but you wanna smoke my drugs (yeah, yeah)
Don't know how to love but you somehow get by love 
Put eight in the twelve, and we sip and talk gunplay
Church Sunday mornin' and then club until Monday (yeah)
Oh lord, findin' your groceries, your pimp in the parkin' lot (yeah, yeah)
Pimp 'bout to trip 'cause he know that you talk a lot (yeah)
Laughing the whole way, I pull out like skrrt
I got drugs, I got lean, does it look like I care? (Stupid)
Cuttin' the cake, I got ice on the Rollie (yeah, yeah, yeah)
High as I am, don't get stopped by the police
Ride that dick, girl, ride it like it's a pony
Hot right now, what do you don't wanna call me?

Girl I need all your love right now, but I'll wait
'Cause I don't wanna seem like I'm hatin'
Baby girl, I really ain't hatin'
You've got options and I'm here to let you know

You got options, bae
Yeah you got options, bae
Know you got options, bae
PARTY is an option, bae
Fuck the hug and kisses, bae
This is for my real bitches
Girl you got options
Tell that hatin' nigga to shut the fuck up

They sleepin' on you, they sleepin' on you
They sleepin' on you, they sleepin' on you
They sleepin' on you, they sleepin' on you (you)
You just wanna drink and shit
He just wanna think and shit
Always wanna fuck and shit
Always show me love and shit
You just wanna smoke and shit
Tell me when to roll it up and shit
You be on the road and shit
Tellin' niggas "no" and shit
