		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ravens painted black the sky above our hiding place 
 Brought to us some messages and filled our hearts with faith 
  
 Time has come ro arise and wait for the sign of destiny's calling 
 Now we have to be wise and safe for a while then we have to go 
  
 Raven's night is the name of our last fight 
 Evening falls here we are to break down the walls 
 We will fight hard until we die 
 Ravens, give us the sign! 
  
 Wiseman gave us all his guidance by those mighty birds 
 We are all prepared against the evil by his words 
  
 Days are passing away together we wait for destiny's calling 
 Say your last words and pray before it's too late then we have to go 
  
 This is not a legend but the story of our life 
 In this battle we will win or we are gonna die 
  
 Come on HEY come on NOW trust and never fear 
 Come on HEY come on NOW Ravens' Night is here
