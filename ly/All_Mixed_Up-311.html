		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've got to trust your instinct 
And let go of regret
You've got to bet on yourself now star
'Cause that's your best bet
Watch me now with a wicked and wild and I said
We come with the funky style
That gets us known for the show
And we'll mix the hip hop reggae if we say it is so
And fuck the naysayers 'cause they don't mean a thing
'Cause this is what style we bring

Now it's morning but last night's on my mind
There's something I need to get off my chest
And no matter what may come to shine
The dream will always be mine

All mixed up you don't know what to do
Next thing you turn around and find the person is you
Thought a freak might be the thing
But the first could be the last so just get off your ass
All mixed up you don't know what to do
Next thing you turn around and find the person is you
Thought a freak might be the thing
But you know this will pass so just get off your ass

You've got to trust your instinct 
And let go of regret
You've got to bet on yourself now star
'Cause that's your best bet
Watch me now with a wicked and wild and I said
Sick sick bit got to have it
Like bustin' in on a session but you got to call it quits
Sick sick bit just can't quit
Fact that you don't even know makes it fully legit

Now it's morning but last night's on my mind
There's something I need to get off my chest
And no matter what will come to shine
The dream will always be mine

You keep me coming
That is a gal that'll kill 'dem stunning
Keep me coming
That is a gal that'll kill 'dem stunning
Keep me coming
That is a gal that'll kill 'dem stunning
Keep me coming
That is a gal that'll kill 'dem stunning

You make me nervous throat dry
My brain is empty don't know why
But I saw you doing something
Which is really truly nothing
But you could bust me out all day

Many moons since first I saw you
Many moons since first we did the do
Many moons since first I saw you
Many moons since first we did the do

And why did I try when I knew it was no and
Why did I try when I saw it was so
But save it for late we should just let it skate
'Cause the waiting feel is fine
