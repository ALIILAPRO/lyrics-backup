		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have got a heavier heart I must give it away
Maybe it's not too late to regret now
I have gone into the deepest dark
I stained my hands with blood
And if the end won't be painful
I should be grateful

I just wanted to see the sky
Open the one last time
I just wanted to feel the rain
Washing away the pain
Washing away the shame

I know fate's deciding for everyone
And that for everything
That we do there's a reason
All my life I have been asking why
I never thought I would get it together but finally now
As I'm leaving life has a meaning

I just wanted to see the sky
Open the one last time
I just wanted to feel the shine
It could have been divine

Give me one more night
I will make things right
I have changed my ways
All I need is time
Give me one more day
Let me clear the way
I'll make up my crime
I will do my time and

I have done terrible things
I must pay for the sins I've done
And now my world is in pieces
I got lost down in the blazing fire
Traded my soul for a minute of pleasure 
And now I must pay for the worthless treasure

I just wanted to see the sky
Open the one last time
I just wanted to feel the wind
Welcome the virgin snow
Before it's my time to go

I have got a heavier heart I must give it away
Maybe it's not too late to regret now
