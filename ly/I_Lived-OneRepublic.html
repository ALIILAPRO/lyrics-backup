		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hope when you take that jump
You don't fear the fall
Hope when the water rises
You built a wall
Hope when the crowd screams out
It's screaming your name
Hope if everybody runs
You choose to stay

I hope that you fall in love
And it hurts so bad, yeah
The only way you can know
You give it all you have
And I hope that you don't suffer
But take the pain
Hope when the moment comes 
You'll say

I, I did it all
I, I did it all
I owned every second
That this world could give
I saw so many places
The things that I did
Yeah, with every broken bone
I swear I lived

Hope that you spend your days
But they all add up
Mm, and when that sun goes down
Hope you raise your cup, oh
I wish that I could witness
All your joy and all your pain
But until my moment comes
I'll say

I, I did it all
I, I did it all
I owned every second
That this world could give
I saw so many places
The things that I did
Yeah, with every broken bone
I swear I lived

(With every broken bone)
I swear I lived
(With every broken bone)
I swear I 

I, I did it all
I, I did it all
I owned every second
That this world could give
I saw so many places
The things that I did 
Yeah, with every broken bone
I swear I lived
I swear I lived
