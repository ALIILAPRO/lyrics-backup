		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Uh
So used to them grey clouds
I might fuck around, drop the top in the rain
For the squad, we don't play around
We'll lay 'em down, hit his top close range
He just pretend, he not with the gang
'Member back then, ask an opp, what he bang
Runnin' from jakes, block hot like I'm Wayne
Spend a quarter mil' on the watch and the chain
I'm just tryna put a lock on the game
Hot shit from this Glock when it flame (hey)

Young nigga up now, 'member back then niggas clowned on me
Now from the Heaven gates, only way a nigga lookin' down on me
Keep at least two hundred thou' on me, keep at least like thirty rounds on me
With my niggas 'til the wheels fall off, don't care if my ride on E
Gucci slides, Versace robes, palm trees, exotic hoes
Snitchin', he can't right his wrongs, once he play that writing role
Slime shit, we wipe his nose, feds watchin', might strike a pose
Do a hit, take flight, we gone, we just take the dice and roll

So used to them grey clouds
I might fuck around, drop the top in the rain
For the squad, we don't play around
We'll lay 'em down, hit his top close range
He just pretend, he not with the gang
'Member back then, ask an opp, what he bang
Runnin' from jakes, block hot like I'm Wayne
Spend a quarter mil' on the watch and the chain
I'm just tryna put a lock on the game
Hot shit from this Glock when it flames

Soon as I touch down, them pussy feds be hot on me (woo)
Heard niggas got money out on my head, tell 'em, "Come crown the king" (hmm)
Let the work out thaw out for fourteen days, that's quarantine (damn)
I poured my heart out before my lean, baby, no R&B (yeah)
Six-six deuce, MOB Piru, big SooWoo, slime my group
Slatt, slatt, slatt, a-achoo, wipe his nose, God bless you
Blatt-blatt-blatt, I'm not through
Bratt-tat-tat, duck-duck-goose
Two big guns on me for the smoke
That's uncle Snoop and Martha Stew'
Call me Capalotty (woo), Big Slimalini (yeah), Lil' Slime Gotti (uh)
That ain't the 'Ghini, lil' bitch that's a 'Gatti (skrrt)
Promethazine, need a P, I'm the wild me
I hide fettuccine from the federales
I'm like Rick Pitino or John Calipari
I'm leadin' my team, yeah, right to the finals
That money talking and we talkin' private
I'm not correspondin', hold on
Gucci slides and Versace robes (ooh)
I'll slide a nigga, I'll slide a ho (ooh)
I banged on anybody gang
And I ball with all my slime-inos
On gang-gang, on Hollygrove
No plain jane, I smoke Zario
And when the rain came I put the top down
Under the dark clouds, I'm shining gold

Used to the grey clouds
I might fuck around and drop the top in the rain (yeah, yeah)
For the squad, we don't play around
We'll lay 'em down, hit his top close range (top close range)
He just pretend, he not with the gang
'Member back then, ask an opp, what he bang (yeah)
Runnin' from jakes, block hot like I'm Wayne (ooh)
Spend a whole mil' on the watch and the chain
I'm just tryna put a lock on the game
Hot shit from this Glock when it flames, yeah

Polo G, Tunechi Lee (yeah, yeah)
Call me Capalotty
