		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You have broken me all the way down
Down upon my knees
And you have broken me all the way now
You'll be the last you'll see

And some fight you gave
When I pushed you away from me
And in the morning when you're turning
I'll be far to sea

And you have broken me all the way down
You'll be the last you'll see

And what chance had we got
When you missed every shot for me

And in the morning when you're turning
I'll be out of reach
And in the darkness when you find this
I'll be far to sea

And you have broken me all the way down
You'll be the last you see
