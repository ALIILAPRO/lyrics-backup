		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give me a sign when you set up your mind
Give me a sign when, ooh
When you took a decision to be on my mind
Give me a sign then (give me a sign then)

You know I'll be there forever to guide you home
Baby, I'm on your side, every time on your side
Just one step at a time and we'll get it right, you know
Baby, I'm on your side, your side

Sing to me, dum-da-da-da
Just sing your love to me again, your dum-da-da-da
So, baby, you should know, da-da-da
Don't wanna be alone again, your dum-da-da-da

So, baby, I don't wanna be solo, ba-da-da-da-da
Don't you leave me solo, solo, da
I don't wanna be solo, ba-da-da-da-da
Don't you leave me solo, solo, da

Patience and time, that's how you're making it right
I'll give you a time when (give you a time when)
When you're ready to be both the rhythm and rhyme
So give me a sign then

You know I'll be there forever to guide you home
Baby, I'm on your side, every time on your side
Just one step at a time and we'll get it right, you know
Baby, I'm on your side, your side

Sing to me, dum-da-da-da
Just sing your love to me again, your dum-da-da-da
So, baby, you should know, da-da-da
Don't wanna be alone again, your dum-da-da-da

So, baby, I don't wanna be solo, ba-da-da-da-da
Don't you leave me solo, solo, da
I don't wanna be solo, ba-da-da-da-da
Don't you leave me solo, solo, da

Solo
Solo, solo, solo
Solo
Solo, solo, solo

Baby, I don't wanna be solo, ba-da-da-da-da
Don't you leave me solo, solo, da
I don't wanna be solo, ba-da-da-da-da
Don't you leave me solo, solo, da
