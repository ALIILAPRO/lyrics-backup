		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you fall, then I will too
Into nothing ever after
'Til we have to face the truth
I look away, neglect the wounds

All the warning signs we refused to see
Like a hurricane that's drowning me
So we build it up
Just to tear it down
But the pieces don't fit now

We're fallin' apart
We're fading away
Pretending that damage doesn't matter
Ignoring the scars
But now it's too late
We settle for nothing ever after
Let's slip away

We've been dreaming wide awake
Feeding poison to each other
It's too hard to walk away
'Cause it's easier to suffer

So we build it up
Just to tear it down
But the pieces don't fit now

We're fallin' apart
We're fading away
Pretending that damage doesn't matter
Ignoring the scars
When now it's too late
We settle for nothing ever after
Let's slip away

After
After

We're fallin' apart
We're fading away
Pretending that damage doesn't matter
Ignoring the scars
And now it's too late
We'll settle for nothing ever after
Let's slip away

Let's slip away
Let's slip away

We're fallin' apart
We're fading away
Pretending that damage doesn't matter
Ignoring the scars
When now it's too late
We settle for nothing ever after

Ever after
Ever after
Ever after
We settle for nothing
Ever after
