		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Show me love
Don't lie to me
Said you down to ride for me
Yeah, lookin for a good time
Girl I got the remedy
Show me love
Don't lie to me
Said you down to ride for me
Yeah, lookin for a good time
Girl I got the remedy

Girl I got the remedy
I know you down to ride
We got matching energy
That I need on my side
Floating lights above me
You stay unidentified
Take us flying through the night
My luminescent butterfly
Ease your mind
Intertwine
Your design
Is it mine
Fusing up the smoke
But your my antidote
Kisses touching bones
Love is what we spoke
Bring us back to life
On another note
We don't need nobody
Only us alone

Show me love
Don't lie to me
Said you down to ride for me
Yeah, lookin for a good time
Girl I got the remedy
Show me love
Don't lie to me
Said you down to ride for me
Yeah, lookin for a good time
Girl I got the remedy

Took another pill wash it down with 40
Uh girl swallow
I do what I want give a fuck what they tell me 
I don't follow follow 
Where we goin guess we'll find out 
No plans of us slowing down 
Down for me u better say it loud 
Show me how right here right now 
Lust is seeping thru you like it's poison 
You teasing way too much girl that's annoying 
Let me hit once now you're addicted 
Split it wide open like I'm your surgeon 
Cut it off I'll have you
Running back for more
Your sick of it all 
Now I'm your antidote
Oh girl 
That's dangerous
There's no forever us
But tonight you can just

Show me love
Don't lie to me
Said you down to ride for me
Yeah, lookin for a good time
Girl I got the remedy
Show me love
Don't lie to me
Said you down to ride for me
Yeah, lookin for a good time
Girl I got the remedy
