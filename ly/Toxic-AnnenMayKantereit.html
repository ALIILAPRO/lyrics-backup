		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, can't you see I'm calling?
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm falling
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm lovin' it

Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?

With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
Taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?

It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from my devil's cup
Slowly, it's taking over me

Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now?

With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
Taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?
Don't you know that you're 

Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh-ahh-ah
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh-ahh-ah

With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
Taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?

With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
Taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?

Intoxicate me now with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now, I think I'm ready now
Intoxicate me now with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
