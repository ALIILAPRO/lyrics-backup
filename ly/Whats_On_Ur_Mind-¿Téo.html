		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's on your mind
Need peace of mind
Drink in your hand
Lust in your eyes
I'll turn you on girl
I'll touch you right
I want your naked body staying home tonight
What's on your mind
Need peace of mind
Drink in your hand
Lust in your eyes
Girl take me under
Come fuck me right
I want your naked body staying home tonight

The way I
The way I'll love you girl, the way I
The way I'll love you
The way I
The way I'll love you girl, the way I
The way I'll love you

You ain't gon' lead me nowhere, oh no
Somethings don't need closure
The way I, I'm losing your body just lead me where you want me yeah yeah
I am proud to see how it is
You don't even know when you feel like this
Clench my fist and I hold my tongue
Too much I can say, I could leave you numb
'Cause your eyes speak feelings that you've cried
So you don't hide

What's on your mind
Need peace of mind
Drink in your hand
Lust in your eyes
I'll turn you on girl
I'll touch you right
I want your naked body staying home tonight
What's on your mind
Need peace of mind
Drink in your hand
Lust in your eyes
Girl take me under
Come fuck me right
I want your naked body staying home tonight

The way I
The way I'll love you girl, the way I
The way I'll love you
The way I
The way I'll love you girl, the way I
The way I'll love you
