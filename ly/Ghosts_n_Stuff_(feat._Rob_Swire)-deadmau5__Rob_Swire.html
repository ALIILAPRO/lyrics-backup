		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been so long, I've been out of my body with you
I feel alone, feel at home, feel like nothing is true
You take me to a place where my senses gave-way,
Turn it round, shuttin' down, what the people say
Climbing up, coming down, gonna give you some,
Take my hand and let it come, let it come, let it

Take it back when she knows that your doing it right
Cause everybody else knows what their taking tonight

But I just wanna play it right,
We're gonna get there tonight

It's been so far I've been walking the line of my time
Wake me up to the stars we are coming home
I only had a chase but were out of time

We have sold in the cold, physical desires
Set me free, set me out on the run,
lift me up to the sun, to the sun, to the

When your burning down, when your burning down,
It's the way that you think that I know
It's too late

But I just want to play it right
We, were gonna get there tonight
I just want to take you down
We're gonna bring you round

But I just want to play it right
We, were gonna get there tonight
