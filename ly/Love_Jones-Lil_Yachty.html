		  (Earl on the Beat)
(Lousy) I'm gettin' better and better at this shit, ayy
Need my producer credit too, ayy (go)

My bitch two-tone (two-tone, woo)
And I'm with my dawgs like a chew bone (like a chew bone)
Said I fuck her for ten minutes, then I get gone (then I get gone), ayy
She want me around 'cause I'm her ringtone (I'm her ringtone), ayy
My bitch get that pack and she send it home (send it home)
Your bitch spend your money and blow up your phone (blow up your phone, bitch)

Ears blinging (ice), teeth chrome (yeah, yeah)
Me and my bitch got understandings, this ain't Love Jones (this ain't Love Jones)
I'm at the top of my building like I'm King Kong (like I'm King Kong)
Why them niggas who hate on me always unknown? (Bitch)
Seventy racks on a chain, I don't even wear it
You a bird, parrot (brrt), I wear all carats (carats)
I look better in real life, baby (facts, facts)
Bitch Hold me down, I'll buy you a Mercedes (skrrt)
Maybe (go)

Oh, oh
Oh, oh (go, fuck)
Ayy
Ayy

My bitch two-tone (two-tone, go)
And I'm with my dawgs like a chew bone (like a chew bone)
Said I fuck her for ten minutes, then I get gone (then I get gone), ayy
She want me around 'cause I'm her ringtone (I'm her ringtone), ayy
My bitch get that pack and she send it home (send it home)
Your bitch spend your money and blow up your phone (blow up your phone)
Ears blinging, teeth chrome (VV's)
I don't wear no clusters, these is whole stones
From the back, I fuck, she love to moan, oh
