		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Da first nigga to slip's
The first nigga I'm a trip on
Get my flip on lay em down N
Get my dip on out the back door
See my Benzo I'm in it I pull a jack in a minute
Got dem Hoochy's gettin' freaky in the
Backroom 'cause on the microphone I'm
Funky like the bathroom
It's just a new Generation of invincble 'G's
We got mic's N gatz N nutz
Hangin' to our knees at ease nigga freeze
If you step into my area I carry a strong
Mind flo till I'm blind
It's summertime feel m rhyme
Lookin' for a dime need to get my head
Right now watch me flo so tight

It's party time and the sun has got me goin' wild
I loose my mind all these Hunny's running all around
We ridin' deep on da creep better not catch you sleep
CBK we bringin' drama over dem Bumpin' Beats
So throw your hands up ridin' in the cut
No you can't get to much runnin' with see-BLOCK
And it don't stop till we POP 'cause we droppin' dem cutz

It's summertime ain't nothin'
But my crew and me
Having fun and
Trippin' on dem want to be
Now that my head is right
I'm ready for tonight
You can't stop us and
Nothin's gonna get in our way (2x)

Now it's another day in the mid of the summer
Niggas watch me coming as I hit corner
I jump up, step up, I bring it up
I listen come with word is born
It's the mister lookin' real hard the catch
My sister now where they at as I grip
The sack so step back trippin' how I break
The back now just to to set it off as I know
Behavior you catch the track on time you know
The flavour it's the saviour I gave you room
To breathe listen then stop and letem freeze

I'm commin' phat it's Goldie blowin' on dis track
We 'cause no slack 'cause see-be -K has got my back
It's Mr. P. commin' from the east nigga's
Can't set speakin' on dem bumpin' beats
Now watch RED DOGG 'cause he's my hog
Straight from dem Cali-sreetz
So throw your hands up ridin' in the cut
No you can't get to much runnin' with see-BLOCK
And it don't stop till we POP 'cause we droppin' dem cutz
