		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  With this Frankincense 
And this Gold and Myrrh 
We are traveling so far 

For a vision of one child
Born of love 
We are following this star 

So, the three of us travel 
'Round the world 
We are riding toward one dream 

In the darkest night
We see heaven's light
Shining on the new born king 

What's that star that's shining
Oh, so bright
What's this road 
That we must follow 
Why this little town
These three men, so wise 
Who's this child 
That we must follow 
Here to Bethlehem 

There's a song to sing
And a tale to tell

And a world to rise above 
So, we're traveling here to Israel
Just to find this child of love

What's that star that's shining
Oh, so bright
What's this road 
That we must follow 
Why this little town
These three men, so wise 
Who's this child 
That we must follow 
Here to Bethlehem

What's that star that's shining
Oh, so bright
What's this road 
That we must follow 
Why this little town
These three men, so wise 
Who's this child 
That we must follow 
Here to Bethlehem
Here to Bethlehem
