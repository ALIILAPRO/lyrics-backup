		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Ch-Charlie Shuffler

Made it out my momma crib, then bought my moms a crib (uh)
Bought myself a chain, kept it short, 'cause I ain't Jibbs (uh)
She gon' let me fuck, she like that "Lil Boat" adlib (Lil Boat!)
And we at Liv (uh), later I'm in her ribs (uh)
I know she your bitch, but I'm up first 'cause I called dibs (uh)
Niggas hate on me, because I live the way I do (yo)
Hatin' on a nigga, ain't gon' make a better you
Self-made nigga, with a self-made crew (yeah)

Take my bitch from D.R. to Peru (uh)
And I'll take my gang from the county to the moon (uh)
I promise I be ballin', 'til it's 2080 in June (yo)
I'ma keep rocking these chains
Why did I keep callin' me "coon" (uh)
And she ride, did like a room (uh)
And I drop top like is June' (yo)
And you keep askin' we gonna do a song
I'ma keep tellin' you soon (yo)
Big rocks on my wrist, might see a fish dog, it's real water (Lil Boat!)
Niggas better hide their daughter (uh)
Real Raptor, Vince Carter (yo)

Made it out my momma crib, then bought my moms a crib (uh)
Bought myself a chain, kept it short, 'cause I ain't Jibbs (uh)
She gon' let me fuck, she like that "Lil Boat" adlib (Lil Boat!)
And we at Liv (uh), later I'm in her ribs (uh)
I know she your bitch, but I'm up first 'cause I called dibs (uh)
Niggas hate on me, because I live the way I do (yo)
Hatin' on a nigga, ain't gon' make a better you
Self-made nigga, with a self-made crew (yeah)
