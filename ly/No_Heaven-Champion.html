Oh Lord (oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord)...

Oh Lord
Oh boy, oh well I told you
Well I told you, but I thought you'd know
There ain't no heaven
Oh Lord, there ain't no heaven
There ain't no heaven
On the county road

Don't talk about it
Oh boy, don't talk about it
Don't talk about it
If you do, I'll cry
Don't come around me
Oh Lord, don't come around me
Don't come around me
If you do, I'll die

Oh Lord (oh Lord), there ain't no heaven
Oh Lord (oh Lord), there ain't no heaven

Down at the station stood my dear ol' mother
Oh well she keep on, keep on screamin' and a-cryin'
"Oh Lord, I wonder what my son has done"

Oh Lord (oh Lord), there ain't no heaven
Oh Lord (oh Lord), there ain't no heaven

Oh Lord (oh Lord)...

Ah Did you bring me, bring me any silver? (silver, silver...)
Oh did you bring me, bring me any gold? (any gold, gold...)
Oh did you see me, workin' on South Carolina
Oh just to see me work on the county road?

Oh Lord (oh Lord), there ain't no heaven
Oh Lord (oh Lord), there ain't no heaven

(Oh Lord, oh Lord)

Oh Lord (oh Lord)
There ain't no heaven (there ain't no heaven)
(Oh lord, there ain't no heaven)
Oh lord (oh lord), there ain't no heaven
