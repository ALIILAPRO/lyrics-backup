		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have a vision in mind
Leaving my borders behind
Burns before my inner eye
My mission before I must die

Lets set the sail, ride the wind
And our ship will go west
Till over the edge

Won't you fly with me
In my dreams to see
That our world is made to expand
Come and sail with me on the seven seas
And explore with me a new land
A new land

Day after day passing by
How many men have to die?
Wandering our lifetime again
Conquer the world, find new land

Walk in our boots through the night
Follow the eastern star
Till over the edge

Wont you fly with me
In my dreams to see
That our world is made to expand
Come and sail with me on the seven seas
And explore with me a new land
A new land

Won't you fly with me
In my dreams to see
That our world is made to expand
Come and sail with me on the seven seas
And explore with me a new land
A new land
