		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Born to break or to last, is it all in the past?
Is that a scar or a birthmark?
Retracing this cold heart and now I'm all out of thread
And I don't want to die here

Keep chasing echoes of my mind,
Babe it's a fine line,
And I'm so far over it,
And I know it

Beneath it all it's still broken,
Cut me out, cut it open,
I can't do it anymore
I can't do it

I don't pay any mind
To the dew upon the vine
Does that mean that it's not there,
If I can see it at all?
Though the morning light will burn away
All the fog the night creates,
There'll still be a trace of our love left behind 
In the dew upon the vine

Where to go or to hide,
You're only worth your old lies
Confiding in your own mine,
Caught in the cold lie,
I thought you were better man
I thought you were better man

A slip step on the tight rope,
Freaked out by a false hope
That things could be alright
No they're not alright

I don't pay any mind
To the dew upon the vine
Does that mean that it's not there,
If I can see it at all?
Though the morning light will burn away
All the fog the night creates,
There'll still be a trace of our love left behind 
In the dew upon the vine

I'll contain my heart,
It's like lightning trying to put out a spark
I'll contain my heart,
You're like lightning trying to put out a spark

I never payed any mind
To the dew upon the vine
Does that mean that it's not there,
If I can see it at all?
Though the morning light will burn away
All the fog the night creates
There'll still be a trace of our love left behind 

And the driving rain will wash away
All the frightened fires I could not tame
There'll still be a trace of our love left behind 
In the dew upon the vine
