		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Triple X to the O like it's tic tac toe
Whoa
And when I look around it's like I'm at a freak show
Whoa
Flirting with a freak and she took my soul
Whoa
And she don't let me go like Calypso
And she don't wait till we get home
So we could do it here at the disco

Two white cups of the blue she fill 'em up
Too white lines of the pure she live it up
Flaunt that ass in my face I feel it up
Don't talk much but that one look said enough
God damn
'Till the break of the dawn she give it up
Glued to the way she behave so villainous
Moves like a snake and her lips so venomous

Go ahead pick up the pace like whoa
Wanna see what you could take right now
Sit it all up on my face like whoa
Letting me know what it taste like
Working that pole till it breaks like whoa
Wanna go back to your place right now
But I can tell you don't wanna wait that long
So we could do it here at the disco

God damn
Yeah
God damn
And she don't let me go like Calypso
God damn
Yeah
God damn
Triple X to the O like it's tic tac toe
Whoa
And when I look around it's like I'm at a freak show
Whoa
Flirting with a freak and she took my soul
Whoa
And she don't let me go like Calypso
And she don't wait till we get home
So we could do it here at the disco

She work in Miami but she grew up in Colombia
She work in Atlanta but she flying in from NOLA, huh
She in Balasana downward dog but this ain't yoga, nah
Uh huh,  bend it over, huh
For a young high roller, huh, uh huh

Poppin' that back and it's real
Tellin' me too feel how it feel and it feels like whoa
Get the whole room turning heads
Lil' queen came with her friends and her friend's like whoa
Filling my cup full of gin
Wanna try and tempt me to sin, giving in like whoa
We could drive back the crib
Or we could do it here at the disco

God damn
Yeah
God damn
And she don't let me go like Calypso
God damn
Yeah
God damn
Triple X to the O like it's tic tac toe
Whoa
And when I look around it's like I'm at a freak show
Whoa
Flirting with a freak and she took my soul
Whoa
And she don't let me go like Calypso
And she don't wait till we get home
So we could do it here at the disco
