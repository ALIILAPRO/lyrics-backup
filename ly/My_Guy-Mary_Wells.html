		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nothing you could say
Can tear me away from my guy
Nothing you could do
'Cause I'm stuck like glue to my guy

I'm stickin' to my guy like a stamp to a letter
Like the birds of a feather
We stick together
I'm telling you from the start
I can't be torn apart from my guy

Nothing you can do
Could make me untrue to my guy (my guy)
Nothing you could buy
Could make me tell a lie to my guy (my guy)

I gave my guy my word of honor
To be faithful and I'm gonna
You best be believing
I won't be deceiving my guy

As a matter of opinion, I think he's tops
My opinion is he's the cream of the crop
As a matter of taste to be exact
He's my ideal as a matter of fact

No muscle bound man could take my hand from my guy (my guy)
No handsome face could ever take the place of my guy (my guy)
He may not be a movie star
But when it comes to bein' happy we are
There's not a man today
Who could take me away from my guy

No muscle bound man could take my hand from my guy (my guy)
No handsome face could ever take the place of my guy (my guy, my guy, my guy)
He may not be a movie star
But when it comes to bein' happy we are
There's not a man today
Who could take me away from my guy (what d'you say?)

'Cause there's not a man today 
Who could take me away from my guy (tell me more)
There's not a man today
Who could take me away from my guy (what's that?)
There's not a man today
Who can take me away from
