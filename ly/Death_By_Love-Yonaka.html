		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Promise you won't let me go
I could be your demon
Together we could rule the world
It could be our secret

No one else will know it's us
We'll wear gloves and camouflage
Sleep like angels in the night
Hold on to our pillow-knives

It's you and I
It's you and I

I set fire to the guy with a drink in his hand and his jeans all turned up
I took a ride from a guy and his girlfriend cried when my gun went off
And I'd turn suicidal if it meant I'd earn my baby's trust
And when my body drops declare this woman: death by love

(Death by love, d-d-death by love)
(Death by love, d-d-death by love)

Passing out at 3am
Somewhere on the road again
Filling up without paying
Waking up with bloody hands
I could never tell him no!
'Cause he does not like being told

It's you and I
It's you and I

I set fire to the guy with a drink in his hand and his jeans all turned up
I took a ride from a guy and his girlfriend cried when my gun went off
And I'd turn suicidal if it meant I'd earn my baby's trust
And when my body drops declare this woman: death by love

(Death by love, d-d-death by love)
(Death by love, d-d-death by love)

We were driving really fast down the wrong side of the lane
You grabbed me and you told me life would never be the same
You'll never live another day that's quite like yesterday
But I wouldn't want it any other way
'Cause we fight too much and we cry too hard
And we drown our sins and we make new scars
You're a dangerous man, it's a dangerous game
But I wouldn't have it any other way
(Oooh, oooh)

I set fire to the guy with a drink in his hand and his jeans all turned up
I took a ride from a guy and his girlfriend cried when my gun went off
And I'd turn suicidal if it meant I'd earn my baby's trust
And when my body drops declare this woman: death by love

I set fire to the guy with a drink in his hand and his jeans all turned up
I took a ride from a guy and his girlfriend cried when my gun went off
And I'd turn suicidal if it meant I'd earn my baby's trust
And when my body drops declare this woman: death by love
