		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Angel eyes, lips just like a daydream
So sweet, makes a heart scream (ah)
The perfect kind, smile so inviting
Are you sure you wanna try me?

I'm a brat
'Cause I get what I want when I snap
On top and it makes you mad (smile, baby girl) 
Don't talk back
Don't say that shit to a brat
I'm a ten from my tits to my ass
Miniskirt so cute and I'm bad (baby girl, can I smash?)
Don't say that, bitch, I'm a brat

Look at me like I'm a meal just lying on a plate
Licks his lips, they're full of shit, I know he wants a taste
All he sees is "daddy, please" and such a pretty face
I won't go near him, but it's still his lucky day

It's a damn privilege to be
Breathin' the same air, the same air I breathe
On his knees, no pictures, please
Tonight, it's just you and your fantasy

I'm a brat
'Cause I get what I want when I snap
On top and it makes you mad (smile, baby girl) 
Don't talk back
Don't say that shit to a brat
I'm a ten from my tits to my ass
Miniskirt so cute and I'm bad (baby girl, can I smash?)
Don't say that, bitch, I'm a brat

(baby, baby girl)
(Chrissy)

Beggin' and pleadin', I wouldn't care if you're bleedin'
And now he's gettin' too close
I wouldn't touch that man with a ten-foot pole
Like this, then pay me, he wanna if you seek Amy
And now this guy's gotta go
I wouldn't touch that man with a ten-foot pole

It's a damn privilege to be
Breathin' the same air, the same air I breathe
On his knees, no pictures, please
Tonight, it's just you and your fantasy

I'm a brat
'Cause I get what I want when I snap
On top and it makes you mad (smile, baby girl) 
Don't talk back
Don't say that shit to a brat
I'm a ten from my tits to my ass
Miniskirt so cute and I'm bad (baby girl, can I smash?)
Don't say that, bitch, I'm a

B-R-A-T
I know your girlfriend wants me
And we're spendin' your money
It's somethin' that you can't teach
B-R-A-T
I've got her body on me
I really think it's funny
'Cause now we're swappin' undies

I'm a brat
'Cause I get what I want when I snap
On top and it makes you mad (smile, baby girl) 
Don't talk back
Don't say that shit to a brat
I'm a ten from my tits to my ass
Miniskirt so cute and I'm bad (baby girl, can I smash?)
Don't say that, bitch, I'm a brat
