		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cast adrift in space no fear
By a pepper moon
Look at all the waves out here
Did we peak too soon?
All the deadly dreams we had
That I can't believe
The universal messages
That we don't receive

Even though we know it's forever changing
Even though we know we lie and wait
Even though we know the hidden danger
I hope it's not too late

Slowly follow shining stars
Feel the solar flare
I'm on borrowed time right now
And I'm low on air
It's a pity you can't see such a travesty
Gonna give myself to the deep majesty

Even though we know it's forever changing
Even though we know we lie and wait
Even though we know the hidden danger
I hope it's not too late

Even though we know it's forever changing
Even though we know we lie and wait
Even though we know the hidden danger
I hope it's not too late

Even though we know it's forever changing
Even though we know we don't have long
Even though we know there's a hidden danger
I hope we don't go wrong
