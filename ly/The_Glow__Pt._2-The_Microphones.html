		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  the GLOW pt. 2

“I took my shirt off in the yard.”
No one saw that the skin on my shoulders was golden. Now it’s not. My shirt’s back on. “The Glow” is gone. I forgot my body’s song.
My gliding body stopped.
I couldn’t get through September without a battle. I faced “death” with my arms swinging but in the cave I heard my own breath and had to face that I’m still living. I’m still flesh. I hold tight to awful feelings. I’m not dead (yet). There’s no end. My face is red with my blood that flows harshly. My heart beats deafeningly. My chest still draws breath and I still hold it. I’m buoyant. There’s no end. “I’m glowing!”
