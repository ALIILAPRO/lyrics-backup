		  Silent Scream - Damien Dawn (2015)

I’m caught up in your expectations
you try to make me live your dream
but I’m causing you so much frustration
and you only want the best for me
you’re wanting me to show more interest
to always keep a big bright smile
but every day I fail to impress
so I cry once in a while

and the storm is rising inside of me
(dontcha feel that our worlds collide)
it’s getting harder to breathe

just let me be, who I am
it’s what you really need to understand
and I hope so hard for the pain to go away
and it’s torturing me but I can’t break free
so I cry and cry but just won’t get it out
the silent scream

tell me why you’re puttin’ pressure on me
and everyday you cause me harm
that's the reason why I feel so lonely
even though you hold me in your arms
wanna put me in a box of glitter
but I’m just tryna get right out
and now you’re feelin’ so so bitter
because I’ve let you down
and the storm is rising inside of me
(dontcha feel that our worlds collide)
it’s getting harder to breathe
(it hurts deep inside)

and the storm is rising inside of me
(dontcha feel that our worlds collide)
it’s getting harder to breathe
(it hurts deep inside)

just let me be, who I am
it’s what you really need to understand
and I hope so hard for the pain to go away
and it’s torturing me but I can’t break free
so I cry and cry but just won’t get it out
the silent scream
can’t you see how I cry for help                           
cuz you should love me just for being myself                                            
I’ll drown in an ocean of pain and emotion                                            
if you don’t safe me right away
just let me be, who I am
it’s what you really need to understand
and I hope so hard for the pain to go away
and it’s torturing me but I can’t break free
so I cry and cry but just won’t get it out
my silent scream
