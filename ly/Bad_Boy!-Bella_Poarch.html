		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love me a bad boy
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
That drives a Corvette and smokes cigarettes
I know they're the worst, but aren't they the best?
Bad boy
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
They're bad for my head, but so good in bed
I know they're the worst, but aren't they the best?

Bad boys and their trauma
All their issues with their mama
Bad boys bring the drama
Play guitar and think they're Nirvana
Bad manners, bad communication
Show up at parties without invitations
Fuck it, let's face it, they don't want my love
They just want me naked, mm

I've had boys who would shower
Me with chocolates and flowers
But without the chase, it's safe to say I'm bored

'Cause I love me a bad boy
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
That drives a Corvette and smokes cigarettes
I know they're the worst, but aren't they the best?
Bad boy
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
They're bad for my head, but so good in bed
I know they're the worst, but aren't they the best?
Bad boys

(La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la)

Bad boys, I can't learn my lesson
I keep fallin' for messed up intentions
Bad boys, they don't go to Heaven
But they bring it to you

I've had boys who would shower
Me with chocolates and flowers
But without the chase, it's safe to say I'm bored

'Cause I love me a bad boy
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
That drives a Corvette and smokes cigarettes
I know they're the worst, but aren't they the best?
Bad boy
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la (Yeah, mm, yeah, yeah)
They're bad for my head, but so good in bed
I know they're the worst, but aren't they the best?

Bad boys, oh-ooh
Bad boys
B-bad b-b-b-b-boy, bad boy
Takin' the trouble
To blow my bubbles away
Bad boy
