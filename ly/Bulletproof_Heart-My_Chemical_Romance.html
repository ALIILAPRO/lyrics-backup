		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be
These pigs are after me, after you

Run away like it was yesterday
And we could run away
If we could run away
Run away from here

I gotta bulletproof heart
You gotta hollow point smile
We had our run away scarves
Got a photograph dream on the getaway mile

Let's blow a hole in this town
And do our talking with the laser beam
Coming out of this place
In a bullet's embrace
Then we'll do it again

How can they say, Jenny could you come back home?
'Cause everybody knows you don't
Ever wanna come back
Let me be the one to save you

Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be
These pigs are after me, after you

Run away like it was yesterday
When we could run away
When we could run away, run away from here

I'm shooting out of this room
Because I sure don't like the company
You stop your preaching right there
'Cause I really don't care
And I'll do it again

So get me outta my head
'Cause it's getting quite cramped, you know
Coming ready or not
When the motor gets hot
We can do it again

The papers say, Johnny won't you come back home?
'Cause everybody knows you don't wanna give yourself up
Tell the truth and God will save you

Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be
These pigs are after me, after you

Run away like it was yesterday
And we could run away,
And we could run away, run away from here

And though I know how much you hate this
Are you gonna be the one to save us
From the black and hopeless feeling
Will you meet 'em when the end comes reeling?

Hold your heart into this darkness
Will it ever be the light to shine you out
Or fail and leave you stranded
Or are you gonna be the one left standing?
You're gonna be the one left standing
You're gonna be the one left standing

Gravity don't mean too much to me
Is this our destiny?
This world is after me, after you

Run away like it was yesterday
And we could run away, run away, run away
Run away from here
Yeah, away from here
Away from here
