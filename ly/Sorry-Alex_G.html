		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll get my cure
Wait in the car
I won't remember
Who you are
I won't remember
Who you are

I'll get my cure
Wait in the car
I won't remember
Who you are

I look at you
And feel the same
Could you forgive me
For that pain?
Could you forgive me
For that pain?

I look at you
And feel the same
Could you forgive me
For that?

Pariah kid
Lost in a game
Can you forgive me
For that pain?
Can you forgive me
For that pain?

Pariah kid
Lost in a game
Can you forgive me
For that?
