		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lonely, lost, little lamb
That no one understands
Seems to always
Hide at the edge of the room
Self-sequential plans
With diabolical ends
You'll just keep on
Laughing it all away
As I consume you
So you don't have to notice me
For now because I'll keep coming around
You know you're safe but not sound
There's nothing in this town
If no one's ever found
So here's to hoping soon you'll have to leave alone
Selfish, cold, little lamb
My fury knows no end
Watch you plead
As if I care
So take your last breath and see
Sweet misery
No one said that it'd be fair
For you
So you don't have to notice me
For now because I'll keep coming around
You know you're safe but not sound
There's nothing in this town
If no one's ever found
So here's to hoping soon you'll have to leave alone
See me creeping on the other side
See me creeping on the other side
See me creeping on the other side
While you're talk, talk, talking away I will consume you
See me creeping on the other side
See me creeping on the other side
See me creeping on the other side
See me creeping on the other side
See me creeping on the other side
See me creeping on the other side
See me creeping on the other side
See me creeping on the other side
So you don't have to notice me
For now because I'll keep coming around
You know you're safe but not sound
There's nothing in this town
If no one's ever found
So here's to hoping soon you'll have to leave alone
