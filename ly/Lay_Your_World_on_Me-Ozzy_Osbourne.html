		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The black rain is falling
Contaminating the ground
The human race is dying
The dead are scattered around

What is the price of a bullet
Another hole in the head
A flag draped over a coffin
Another soldier is dead

How many victims have fallen
How many more have to die
People dying in masses
Ain't gonna get any by

We've got our marching orders
Defenders of the homeland
Our pride
We've crossed through many borders
In between suicides

War, killing sons and daughters
Another failed attack, there is no turning back
Blood, running down like water
'Cause people gotta wait
Until the judgment comes

Politicians confuse me
I watch the body count rise
Why are the children all marching, Into the desert to die

The human psyche is twisted
The madness rising again
Another aim by a bully
I watch them dying in vain

We've got our marching orders
Defenders of the homeland; our pride
We've crossed through many borders
In between suicides

War, sends our sons to slaughter
Another failed attack, there is no turning back
Blood, running down like water
'Cause people gotta wait
Until the judgment comes

Are you ready?

Black rain, black rain
Black rain, black rain

War, killing sons and daughters
Another failed attack, there is no turning back
Blood, running down like water
'Cause people gotta wait
Until the judgment
You think you got away
Until the judgment comes
