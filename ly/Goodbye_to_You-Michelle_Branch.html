		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do

Of all the things I believed in
I just want to get it over with
Tears form behind my eyes
But I do not cry
Counting the days that past me by

I've been searching deep down in my soul
Words that I'm hearing are starting to get old
It feels like I'm starting all over again
The last three years were just pretend and I said

Goodbye to you
Goodbye to everything I thought I knew
You were the one I loved
The one thing that I tried to hold on to

I still get lost in your eyes
And it seems like I can't live a day without you
Closing my eyes and you chase my thoughts away
To a place where I am blinded by the light but it's not right

Goodbye to you
Goodbye to everything I thought I knew
You were the one I love
The one thing that I tried to hold on to

Do, do, do, do, do, do
Do do, do do (oh)
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do

And it hurts to want everything and nothing at the same time
I want what's yours and I want what's mine
I want you but I'm not giving in this time

Goodbye to you
Goodbye to everything I thought I knew
You were the one I loved
The one thing that I tried to hold on to

Goodbye to you (goodbye to you)
Goodbye to everything I thought I knew (goodbye to you)
You were the one I love
The one thing that I tried to hold on to (the one thing that I tried to hold on to)
The one thing that I tried to hold on to (the one thing that I tried to hold on to)

Ooh-ooh-ooh
The one thing that I tried to hold on to
And when the stars fall I will lie awake
You're my shooting star
