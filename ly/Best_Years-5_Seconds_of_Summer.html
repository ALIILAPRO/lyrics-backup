		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've got a million reasons to hesitate
But darlin', the future's better than yesterday
I wasted so much time on people that reminded me of you
Gave you a million reasons to walk away

But I'll build a house out of the mess
And all the broken pieces
I'll make up for all of your tears

I'll give you the best years
I'll give you the best years
Past love burned out like a cigarette
I promise, darling, you won't regret
The best years

I wanna hold your hair when you drink too much
Carry you home when you cannot stand up
You did all these things for me when I was half a man for you
I wanna hold your hand while we're growing up

But I'll build a house out of the mess
And all the broken pieces
I'll make up for all of your tears

I'll give you the best years
I'll give you the best years
Past love burned out like a cigarette
I promise, darling, you won't regret
The best years
The best years

I'll give you the best years
I'll give you the best years
Past love burned out like a cigarette
I promise, darling, you won't regret
The best years
I'll give you the best years
