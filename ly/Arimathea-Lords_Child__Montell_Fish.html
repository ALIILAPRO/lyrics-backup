		<p>
		  My head you will come back and
I know yeah, I've been trippin' over my head
That You will come back and i know
I've been trippin' over my head
That You will come back and i know
Child, I've been trippin' over my head
That You will come back and i know

They'd been lost, but I will find My child
I will find My child my child
They'd been lost, but I will find My child
I will find My child my child

My head you will come back and
I know yeah, I've been trippin' over my head
You will come back and i know
I've been trippin' over my head
You will come back and i know
Child, I've been trippin' over my head
That You will come back and i know

They'd been lost, but I will find My child
I will find My child my child
They'd been lost, but I will find My child
I will find My child my child

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh

They'd been lost, but I will find My child
I will find My child my child
They'd been lost, but I will find My child
I will find My child my child
They'd been lost, but I will find My child
I will find My child my child
They'd been lost, but I will find My child
I will find My child my child
(Let's go) They'd been lost
But I will find My child
I will find My child my child
They'd been lost, but I will find My child
I will find My child my child
