		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody wanna know where did all the cowboys go?
Musta been the whiskey, maybe it was all the Marlboros
But it ain't none of that, that laid 'em all low
Yeah, believe me I know

It was that midnight stare
Look in her eyes like a knife to the heart
It was that poison kiss
Cherry red lips, oh my God, leaning up against the bar
And I know it wasn't the smoke, it wasn't the drink
And I've got the proof
If you wanna know what killed the cowboy
A girl like you (a girl like you)

Mm, the way she does it wasn't just another rodeo 
Lipstick kiss on the mirror, that was all she wrote 
Yeah, it's supposed to be me riding away
But I'm dying in a bed that she made

It was that midnight stare
Look in her eyes like a knife to the heart
And it was that poison kiss
Cherry red lips, oh my God, leaning up against the bar
And I know it wasn't the smoke, it wasn't the drink
And I've got the proof
If you wanna know what killed the cowboy
Ooh (a girl like you)

Well, she's off in the sunset, she's out on the run
Bet she's halfway to Jackson by now
And I'm heartbroke to hell and I'm drowning the well
While I'm telling the bartender how

It was that midnight stare
Look in her eyes like a knife to the heart
And it was that poison kiss
Cherry red lips, oh my God, leaning up against the bar
And I know it wasn't the smoke, it wasn't the drink
And I've got the proof
If you wanna know what killed the cowboy
A girl like you (a girl like you)
