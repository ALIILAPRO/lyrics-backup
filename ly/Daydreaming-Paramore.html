		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Living in a city of sleepless people
Who all know the limits and won't go too far outside the lines
'Cause they're out of their minds
I wanna get out and build my own home
On a street where reality is not much different from dreams I've had
A dream is all I have

Daydreaming, daydreaming all the time
Daydreaming, daydreaming into the night
Daydreaming, daydreaming all the time
Daydreaming, daydreaming into the night
And I'm alright

Creep past the hours like the shorter hand on the clock
Hanging on a wall of a schoolhouse somewhere
We wait for the bell
And we dream of somewhere else

Daydreaming, daydreaming all the time
Daydreaming, daydreaming into the night
Daydreaming, daydreaming all the time
Daydreaming, daydreaming into the night
And I'm alright

It's not that I won't remember where I'm from
Just don't wanna be here no more
It's not enough (we're only half alive)
I'm gonna go (we're only half alive)
Where the rest of the dreamers go
Where the dreamers go

Daydreaming, daydreaming all the time
Daydreaming, daydreaming into the night
And I'm alright
Daydreaming, daydreaming all the time
Daydreamer, we used to be half alive
Now I'm alright
I'm alright, I'm alright
