		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm your little farm cat,
I just can't help it
Follow you around
With clovers in my mouth
I'm your little shadow Can't be without you Got you a present
The skin of a pheasant
Your little farm cat
I just can't help it
Can't be without you
You've got this way about you
I'll keep my paws off
Until you pet me softly
Want to be wanted
There's nothing wrong with that
Nothing wrong with that Nothing wrong with that Nothing wrong with that Nothing wrong with that
