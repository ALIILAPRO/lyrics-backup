		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I said if we never get a chance to be together
Go with Jah, Tanya loves ya, wha me seh?

It's a pity you already have a wife
And me done have a man inna my life
Rude boy it's such a pity
I say it is such a pity you already have your wife
And me have a one man inna my life
Rude boy it is a pity

I would a like one of these mornings to wake up and find
Your face on a pillow lying right next to mine
I would a cut out the partying the smoking and the rum
And buss a extra wine and make we seal up a son
Well every time mi fantasize me see your lips me see your eyes
Your trigger fornger do something a left the rude girl hypnotized
For you it's just a thing, just another little fling
But for me this is heaven and the angel them a sing

It's a pity you already have a wife
And me done have a man in my life
Rude boy it's such a pity
I say it is pity you already have your wife
And me have a one man in my life
Rude boy it is a pity

For buck you up in a public and can't even touch
It really fuck me up because me check for you so much
The respect when mi have for your woman for your kids
Believe me rude boy my criss, a nuh matey this
Who knows? maybe one day the world will be evolved enough
We'll share you in a civilized manner between the two of us
But until then I would a love see you again,
Me know we have for play it by the stupid rules of men

I said if we never get a chance to be together
Go with Jah, Tanya loves ya, who me seh?

So meet me round the corner, avoid Mitzy and Lorna
You know them a two of the biggest informer
I'm not starving for sex no, nah bawl out 'next no
But the way how you flex really be my interest yo
The you that people see a no the you and me loving
And the you what with me go much deeper than skin
I don't know exactly what it is you're feeling
But I wish this was a permanent thing

It's such a pity you already have a wife
And me done have a man in my life
Rude boy it's such a pity
I say it is such a pity you already have your wife
And me have a one man in my life
Rude boy it is a pity

Me know see you belong to she, you know see me belong to him
Me wouldn't want you this your queen, me would a never this my king
But when you play pon my riddim and when me feel your base a swing
You left me in a turmoil, you have me head a spin
It really make me sad for haffi waste so much water,
I think the two o' we can make a beautiful daughter
But it would be selfish to an innocent little youth
For bring her come and cannot tell her the truth
Tell her the truth
Wha me seh? go with Jah I will always love ya

I said if we never get a chance to be together
Go with Jah, Tanya loves ya, wha me seh?
