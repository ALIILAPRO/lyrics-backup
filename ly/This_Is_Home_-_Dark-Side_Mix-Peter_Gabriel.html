		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I looked into the deepest sky
To find what you'd shown me
Here beside the churning sea
A calm came over me

'Cause I know this is home
Home is where I need to be
I know you are my home

Running down these roads of glass
With no way to see through them
We struggle through the buzz and the grind
Of one thing I'm certain

I know this is home
And home is where I need to be
I know you are my home

More or less
When you strip the whole thing down
Let all the feelings flow
And we're standing there in the garden
Watching the world roll out below
And we flow 
Like a river through the night
All the colors bleed to light

I looked as far as I could see
To see what we're showing
We've scattered like a bag of seeds
Wherever the wind was blowing

Whatever brought us here
In the day or night it'll come and go
But then it's you and I
We just keep moving on
Walking down the road
And when we make it hard
And when I left you scarred
It looks like all has gone
Then the love creeps through
From deep in me and you
Walking down the road
Go back home

Looking for answers
But they're hidden from view
There's no way of knowing
And here I am holding you
There's nowhere else I'm going

I know this is home
And home is where I have to be
I know this is my home

Home, home
This is my home
Home, home
You are my home
