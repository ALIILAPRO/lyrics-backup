		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Real shit, I said, the name of
The game, get the change, fuck the fame
If it ain't about no money
I ain't fucking with you gang
When I was cuffed up in the chains
Niggas ain't give me a holla
Bail 95 hundred
Niggas ain't give me a dollar
That's the number one problem, no respect
No loyalty business over bitches
That's number one and most importantly
The day I fell
I know y'all wouldn't be the
Ones that supported me i call the phone
Ya hitting buttons avoiding me
I was in my cell boiling
Like whеn I touchdown, imma kill something
That's when I caught myself, likе nigga
Get a deal or something
Eat a meal or something
Getting rich will make em sick
The main ones I thought was real
They was fake as shit
Talking bout they never change
I needed help, they never came
Same time you making money off my name
Know what's fucked up in the game
Guess God just had to show me
Who to keep close to me and on
The real you niggas owe me
Shit, my mom the one that told me
"man them niggas ain't gon' ride
When you down doing your time they
Acting out here like you died"
So I'm laughing with a smile
I'm in the game switching
Lanes, and I ain't dissing
On you niggas, nah, i'm just spitting pain
This is real shit
Flowing like the blood that's in my veins
Homie feel this cause it can
Happen to your boys, the same
I'm the only boy to blame
Cause I was down for you niggas
I would ride, I would die
Bust my pound for you niggas like
I was on quarantine, living like a poor fiend
Niggas taking meds
Just to kill the pain like it's morphine
Yea, go ahead sleep on me, you boys dream
And I be at it chasing cabbage
Serving more cream
I had to separate myself from the lames
Had to
Realize that me and niggas ain't the same
Can't complain
I kept it a hundred, sunny or rain
Through the fame or the pain, rega
Real shit, I said, the name of
The game, get the change, fuck the fame
If it ain't about no money
I ain't fucking with you gang
When I was cuffed up in the chains
Niggas ain't give me a holla
Bail 95 hundred
Niggas ain't give me a dollar
That's the number one problem, no respect
No loyalty business over bitches
That's number one and most importantly
The day I fell, i know yall would be the
Ones that supporting me i call the phone
Ya hitting buttons avoiding me
I was in my cell boiling
Like when I touchdown, imma kill something
That's when I caught myself
Like nigga get a deal or something
Eat a mill or something
Getting rich will make em sick
The main ones I thought was real
They was fake as shit
Talking bout they never change
I needed help, they never came
Same time you making money off my name
Know what's fucked up in the game
Cause God just had to show me
Who to keep close to me and on
The real you niggas owe me
Shit my mom the one that told me
"man them niggas
Ain't gon' ride, when you
Down doing your time
They acting out here like you died"
So I'm laughing with a smile
Man the game switching
Lanes, and I ain't dissing
On you niggas, nah, i'm just spitting pain
This is real shit
Flowing like the blood that's in my veins
Homie feel this cause it can happen
To your boy the same
I'm the only boy to blame
Cause I was down for you niggas
I would ride, I would die
Bust my pound for you niggas like
I was on cortine, living like a poor fiend
Niggas taking meds
Just to kill the pain like it's morphine
Yea, go ahead sleep on me, you boys dream
And I be at it chasing cabbage
Serving more cream
I had to separate myself from the lames
Had to
Realize that me and niggas ain't the same
Can't complain
I kept it a hundred, sunny or rain
Through the fame or the pain
Regardless I will remain the same

You know what, this a celebration, imma give
You a pass on the freestyle
We not gonna do that
I s-, I wanna freestyle tho y-You sure?
What you gotta you can't find
A beat right now? N-Not right this minute
Aiight, imma just give them some
Of a real aca
