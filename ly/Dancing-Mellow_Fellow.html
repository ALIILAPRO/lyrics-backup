		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Years ago when I had a chance
I could've held your hand
But I was young and then I blew every circumstance
Yet I still think
I dream of

Dancin', dancin'
Oh, with you, with you
And maybe even share a drink or two
While I tell you the truth

That I don't even care what this is for
As long as I get to share the floor
Oh, with you, with you
With you

In my thoughts and dreams
I do a little swayin' away
Swayin' away with you
Even if I know it'll never realize

Maybe one day I'll wake up
Maybe someday it'll be true
Maybe that day I'll be
I will be

Dancin', dancin'
Oh, with you, with you
And maybe even love you a little more
While we tango across the floor

And I don't even know when I'll see you again
I'll just keep living this dream 'till the end
Oh, with you, with you
With you
