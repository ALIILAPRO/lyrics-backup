		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Backwood on my lip
Bracelet on my wrist
I'm just high as fuck
Got no fucks to give
Dirty in my cup
You can take a sip
East side where I live
They know I'm the shit

They know I'm the shit
They know I'm the shit
People show me love
Been that way since off the rip
Yeah since off the rip
Yeah since off the rip
People show me love
Been that way since off the rip

Backwood on my lip
Bracelet on my wrist
I'm just high as fuck
Got no fucks to give
Dirty in my cup
You can take a sip
East side where I live

They know I'm the shit
They know I'm the shit
They know I'm the shit
Backwood on my lip
Backwood on my lip
They know I'm the shit
They know I'm the shit
Backwood on my lip

Backwood on my lip
Backwood on my lip
Backwood on my lip
People show me love
Been that way since off the rip
Backwood on my lip
East side where I live
They know I'm the shit
They know they know I'm the shit
