		<p>
		  Oh, boy
Yeah, we got 'em like
Oh, boy
Webby (ay, ay)

You better listen when I come through (check, one-two)
It's nothin' new
Couple loose screws, uncut and unglued
And when I bust through, what the fuck is you gon' do? (What?)
And if they want war I've been studyin' Sun Tzu
I hold true
That's like fuckin' with Goku
An ice cold killer, veins poppin' a cold brew
I told you all the shit that I had to go through
Is why my legacy is what they givin' a toast to (baow)
So give me that money direct
Fuck it, I'll double the bet
Better go shop for the deck
Y'all better cover the debt
Or a friendly game will turn to WWF
Cover the jugular when I run up and come for your neck 
(Kill 'em all)
I don't mean this shit literally
More like a figure of speech
How I be killin' these beats
And I be killin' emcee's 'til they admitted defeat
Then I go hit the repeat
I'm a boss so I throw a big pussy off the boat
Where lobster go like Jacques Cousteau
Then wipe the prints and v√°manos
Cut 'em up with the chopper flow
Mop the floor with 'em
Bitch, you better lock the door and then
Baow, kick the motherfucker back down
Bitch, you better fuckin' back down
Fuckin' with Webb and Bus', get a smackdown
Better sit your ass down

Don't you ever disrespect this
Yeah, we the ones you never wanna mess with
Goin' all off script, so motherfuck a setlist
Eat your breakfast
Break your motherfuckin' neck, bitch (what?)
(Break your motherfuckin' neck)
Like oh, boy (oh, boy, oh, boy)
Boy, oh, boy, I'm on that shit again when they listenin'
Yeah, we got 'em like, "Oh, boy" (oh, boy, oh, boy)
Boy, oh, boy, I'm goin' sick again
When they listenin', they don't want it with us

Ayo, Bus'
Show these motherfuckers what time it is

Slide to the right, let me move to the center
And I come and eat your food and I come and eat your dinner
And I been up in the gym, you know I got a little bigger
And I make your wife leave you when I know you won't forget it (sh-sh-shit)
Damn right, better know I'm comin' right back
Let me proceed, you don't want it with me
Hit 'em when you see me
Take away then watch him begging for his life back
Give me room to breathe, you don't want it with me, killer (uh, uh)
Put 'em all to sleep
Give 'em all a little nightcap
Let a brother weave another champagne spiller
See the way they front, better know we gotta fight back
When you know we done just put that statue on the pillar 
(Where my money? Huh)
Every time I come and then I give it to the people (huh)
And I burst your little bubble
And I spit a little evil
And I hurt your little muscles
And I shoot the bullets equal
You don't really wanna tussle when I hit you with the lethal
Slime every single time around me, you know I gotta shine
Yes, you know I'm gonna hit you off (hit you off)
And they love the way I grind 
And I know it really piss you off (piss you off)
And while you thinkin' you the shit
Everybody sayin', "Bitch, you soft" (bitch, you soft)
Better know who you really fuckin' with

Don't you ever disrespect this
Yeah, we the ones you never wanna mess with
Goin' all off script, so motherfuck a setlist
Eat your breakfast
Break your motherfuckin' neck, bitch (what?)
(Break your motherfuckin' neck)
Like oh, boy (oh, boy, oh, boy)
Boy, oh, boy, I'm on that shit again when they listenin'
Yeah, we got 'em like, "Oh, boy" (oh, boy, oh, boy)
Boy, oh, boy, I'm goin' sick again
When they listenin', they don't want it with us
