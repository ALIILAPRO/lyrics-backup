		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got the beat by powers and we just made a banger
Uh

Bitch, who want smoke? (What?)
Hopin' it's a yes but niggas always sayin' no (word)
Hopin' it's a phone but now I'm takin' out the pole (word)
Walk your son to school and then watch TV at your home (okay)
You niggas got me really really aggy (huh?)
My hands are gettin' grabby (huh?)
Oh, that nigga hit me? Well, nigga, not too shabby (okay)
Oh, that nigga dissed me? I pull up in a tank, yeah (huh?)
I wanna see that look all on that motherfucker face (okay)

You can suck my dick, my cock, my balls, my schlong
My rod, my snake, my big ol' long
My dick, my cock, my balls, my schlong
My rod, my snake, my big ol' long

Hey, I wanna punch you in the face (hey)
Nigga, I'm the realest, can't replace me with a fake (okay)
Got a new Glock, I'ma take it on a date (wassup?)
These bullets is a wingman, your bones is on a break (yeah, okay)
Ayy, ain't shit pretty when your glock, it got titties? (Huh?)
Make a nigga hit the schmoney dance with twin Glizzies (huh?)
If you gettin' hit then you ain't stayin' over fifty (okay)
If you gettin' hit then you ain't stayin' over fifty (huh, huh)

You can suck my dick, my cock, my balls, my schlong
My rod, my snake, my big ol' long
My dick, my cock, my balls, my schlong
My rod, my snake, my big ol' long
