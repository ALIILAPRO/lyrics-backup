		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dangerous, beautiful and furious
Baby, we got fast-lane love
Heading for a crash and burn
This energy, let it take a hold on me
I know it's a red flag crush
But I really need that rush

Ah, going with the speed of light tonight
I forget what's wrong or right
This high I'm never coming off
Ah, turn it up on overdrive
Sleepless, always running wild
Don't know how to take it slow

To the moonli-light we go
We pick it now down low, low
On the highway, we will never take it slow
Ready, set, go
In the moonli-light we know
Never felt so, felt so pure
On the highway, we will never take it slow
Ready, set, go

In the moonli-light we know
(Taking it slow)
In the moonli-light we know

Adrenaline is my kind of medicine
Making me fall right off track
I don't wanna turn, look back
Perfect dream, bringing out the bad in me
Something I can't live without
I'ma wear it like a crown

Ah, going with the speed of light tonight
I forget what's wrong or right
This high I'm never coming off
Ah, turn it up on overdrive
Sleepless, always running wild
Don't know how to take it slow

To the moonli-light we go
We pick it now down low, low
On the highway, we will never take it slow
Ready, set, go
In the moonli-light we know
Never felt so, felt so pure
On the highway, we will never take it slow
Ready, set, go

In the moonli-light we know
(Taking it slow)
In the moonli-light we know
