		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's BLS from the west I've Lost Angeles
Tryna' find my way back but the
Map was made of cannabis
Better hurry up and find another
Way to handle this
Burned every tree now there's none
To hang my hammock with
Hey - tryna' patch up all my damages
Staggered through the madness
Throwing hatchets at the manuscripts
Of every maggot on the planet
Tryna' rap and spit
I'd cop your album but I'd rather
Eat a bag of shit
Smoke a spliff that's been
Dipped in the madness
And take a step on your neck
And get it crackin' bitch
It's B-L-S Brandon Bless but he's hazardous
As tobacco is to mammals
He's standing in a buffalo
Flannel in Amsterdam-Ales
Couldn't find a candle to handle
Up as I channel this
Granted now the fandom abandoning
All the analysts
Turned every critic into advocating panelists
No more time for the trash talk
Put your eyes on the black hawk
See the prize that I grasped on
I was born at the height of the rap storm
Now I smack on the back the baby's reborn
On a road I met some detours
But I always kept my feet forward
All I need is a drum beat to seek toward
And keep my heart in my head
Swinging back and forth like a see-saw
Been living life like I'm
Falling down a freefall
Handful of dice who want to
Write like they really raw
I bet it all I be the
Nigga that will win it all
Sendin em' the venom that was
Hidden in my rhythm y'all
Hey - I was born with game
And I grew over time
And the form would change
But the core still remained the same
Now I'm 23 with buckets of change
In the court like when Jordan came
With the dunk from the free throw lane
Now all I need is the
Five-finger ring read 'KING'
And a catalog of classics that we can bang
Then I'm mapping out the atlas
That leads the way

Hey - We don't play
What was blessed with game
So respect the name shahmen

Hey - We don't play
What was blessed with game
So respect the name shahmen

Hey - We don't play
What was blessed with game
So respect the name shahmen
