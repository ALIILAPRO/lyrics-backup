		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dark eyes, white hair, and sharp nails
How I wish I could be drop dead again
Those legs, rats tail, and a serpents tongue
Should do the trick for my next spell

Hocus Pocus

Tell me how you're gonna go
How you're gonna go on and make him fall in love with you
With nothing but a lie. Nothing but a pretty face
Careful what you wish for
Your wicked ways are catching up to you
Watch how your beauty fades and evil shines through

You thought you might have found the perfect victim
The kind of guy that makes you live forever
This type of magic has its irony
A dash of lust wont last the test of time
You think it'll make you immortal
But your spirit faded victims ago
You pulled the Death Card
But you spat in its face
And now it's time to pay for what you've done

Hocus Pocus

Tell me how you're gonna go
How you're gonna go on and make him fall in love with you
With nothing but a lie. Nothing but a pretty face
Careful what you wish for
Your wicked ways are catching up to you
Watch how your beauty fades and evil shines through

Hey Witch!
It's time for this to finally end
A thousand years of, a thousand years of dying slowly
Crawl into my bed
Our souls have finally wed
Now death do you part
You were dead from the start
The moment I found you out
And now you're DEAD!

Tell me how you're gonna go
How you're gonna go on and make him fall in love with you
With nothing but a lie. Nothing but a pretty face
Careful what you wish for
Your wicked ways have now caught up with you
Watch how your beauty fades and evil shines through
