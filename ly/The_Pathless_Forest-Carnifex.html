		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We wander this earth, alone
An asylum of pure solitude
No light reaches the forest floor
I long for nothing in this world, anymore
Few are the days in the land of the living
Long are the nights, for life's grieving
To accept emptiness is to find true meaning
Alone with yourself is life beginning
Stand besides your soul
Your soul

Outside your mind
Conscienceless projections
Like the sands of time
Few are the days in the land of the living
Long are the nights, for life's grieving
Emptiness is true meaning
You must walk this path alone
Letting go of the self you know
In the chaos all is clear
Memories and ashes
We were never really here

The pathless forest leads to nowhere
Nowhere
Buried beneath the roots of the trees
You’ll find the worlds bodies searching for meaning
Rotten bones in rotten holes
All of them died, died alone
Now go, collect the sunset
Hold the light for the last time
Embrace the moon until you’re all mine
I am death, death divine
