		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, nah-nah-nah-nah
Real niggas don't do pullouts, man (nah-nah-nah)
Ayy, uh

Still got the keys to the old way, but life smooth like butter
Still got the keys to the old way, but I use my other 
I'm tryna test drive the Lambo', end up in the hills somewhere
Lost, I got God, I know he'll be here 
Ayy, ain't the same as I used to be
Got a few cars in the garage, I got rich, gotta get used to me
I got tired of people usin' me, be loyal or you losin' me
You had an option, you weren't choosin' me

And they say it take time to get to where you want, but they ain't foolin' me
(New interior, change the leather, would've thought that you would do me better)
And they say it take time but I believe not when you as cool as me
(New interior, change the leather, I still believe you could do me better, for sure)

Ayy, still tryna cop Mulsanne
They say you too insane
I take the coupe, blow out the brains
We are not the same, skrrt, switch lane (ayy)
All my bitches flawless, diamonds 
Pussy good, bad attitude, don't mind it
Switch the clock on a watch, call it perfect timin'
Talk to God, I be lost, I be unwindin'
And I put it down when she want it
I done put her on top but she still climbin'
See the ice in my mouth, she in love with diamonds
And my heart too cold, gotta change
I done put her on the climb, she still grindin'
Know I come from the hood, I'm still slidin'
I done did it too bad, she still ride it
Tryna find somebody better and I still can't find it

Still got the keys to the old way, but life smooth like butter
Still got the keys to the old way, but I use my other
I'm tryna test drive the Lambo', end up in the hills somewhere
Lost, I got God, I know he'll be here
Ayy, ain't the same as I used to be
Got a few cars in the garage, I got rich, gotta get used to me
I got tired of people usin' me, be loyal or you losin' me
You had an option, you weren't choosin' me

And they say it take time to get to where you want, but they ain't foolin' me
(New interior, change the leather, would've thought that you would do me better)
And they say it take time but I believe not when you as cool as me
(New interior, change the leather, I still believe you could do me better, for sure)

Catapult off the top shelf, know I got wealth, I'm a rich nigga
She know I know a shooter, probably know a shooter 
Probably know a shooter brought a stick with him
And a gang member brought a blick with him
Young nigga brought a bitch with him
I'm the shooter the shooter probably know 
From the young nigga, yeah, we brought blicks with us
I got gang ties, I'm a hood romantic
Street nigga, I make the bitch panic
Real problems, put it all on the canvas
Try to hide but I know I'm doin' damage
Tryna find her, Polo, Marco
She know I'm dope like a Narco
Fell in love for the racks in Wells Fargo
Know I like when she holdin' me just like groceries

Still got the keys to the old way, but life smooth like butter
Still got the keys to the old way, but I use my other
I'm tryna test drive the Lambo', end up in the hills somewhere
Lost, I got God, I know he'll be here
Ayy, ain't the same as I used to be
Got a few cars in the garage, I got rich, gotta get used to me
I got tired of people usin' me, be loyal or you losin' me
You had an option, you weren't choosin' me

And they say it take time to get to where you want, but they ain't foolin' me
(New interior, change the leather, would've thought that you would do me better)
And they say it take time but I believe not when you as cool as me
(New interior, change the leather, I still believe you could do me better, for sure)
