		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You
Feel that could be you 
How does it feel 
that could be you 
How does it feel 
What would you do

What’s a king to a God 
I’m like 
What’s a king to a God 
I’m like 
What’s a king to a God 
Godlike 

Don’t get it twisted I still got it 
It’s just 
These days it takes a lot to bring it out of me 

Godlike 
Godlike 

Got to the crib 
And I just connected the scarlett
Back to recording
Gotta be consistent when you give them this kind of performance 
Godlike 
The song bleeds
The tongue is a sword 
Back to making music that the grammys no longer reward 
Godlike 
Sparking minds with the rhymes I used to write in the dark 
Describing all those nights we had to pray for a better tomorrow 
Accepting the fact you gotta continue to starve 
It’s hard to work with what you got when you don’t have nothing at all 
It’s me against the world and a legion of demons 
That grew wings inside my head cause I kept them a secret 
That’s when the glow inside my spirit just slowly depleted 
I had to face them 
So I’m on my knees facing east 
To slowly redeem it 
The heart tells the mind to use love to defeat the evils 
In this game I got the crown
I’m on the throne seated 
But back home I’m uncle Reece to all of my nieces 
Tryna be there when I’m needed 
Long as I’m here and I’m breathing 
I gotta change with the seasons 
My time isn’t yet a luxury 
It hurts me to tell you I’m leaving
Just know I do this cause you’re part of the reason 
When God made me he created a leader
Been a legend since the days of a fetus
Remember when they took my silence for weakness 
But go silent when I finally achieve it 
fuck them
And fuck the world cause I ain’t saving it either 
Somebody tell me what’s the price of my freedom 
Another life I guess 
I’m in Zambia finding it hard to rest 
Far from home but feel like I ain’t even left 
On the dusty streets of LSK 
I went from happiness to being stressed 
I could see the mansions with the views 
The city life and all 
Until we drove further down the road
I started seeing less
More of what I saw next were 12 year olds with their mothers 
Under the blazing sun
Covered in black residue
Selling coal 
Still barely able to provide for a broken home 
Wondering how they cope 
Saw police stations
No hospitals close 
No schools
But to the church though 
All of them go 
But it’s never easy restoring the hope 
Heaven or hell guess we’re living in both 
But it’s like the meek just keep burning the most 
And I’m just blessed to be on my way another show 
Turning my thoughts into memorable quotes 
Before I leave corpse and turn into a ghost 
Satisfied that I played a pivotal role 
Known for touching a soul whenever he spoke 
Although he spoke in code whenever he wrote 
Godlike
And if they paint me as the villain I’m chilled 
cause like devil how the fuck they s‘posed to stop me 
If they think I ain’t real 

Just like devil how the fuck they s‘posed to stop me 
If they think I ain’t real 

Feel that could be you 
How does it feel 
That could be you 
How does it feel 
That could be you

Don’t get it twisted I still got it 
It’s just 
These days it takes a lot to bring it out of me
