		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Colder than the moon
Well it's been so long

And I've been putting out the fire with gasoline
See these eyes so red
Red like jungle burning bright
Those who feel me near

Pull the blinds and change their minds
It's been so long
Still this pulsing night
A plague I call a heartbeat

Just be still with me
But it wouldn't believe what I've been through
You've been so long
Well it's been so long

I've been putting out the fire with gasoline
Putting out the fire
With gasoline

See these tears so blue
An ageless heart that can never mend
Tears can never dry
A judgment made can never bend

See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Just be still with me
You wouldn't believe what I've been through
Well you've been so long

It's been so long
And I've been putting out fire with gasoline
Putting out a fire with gasoline

Putting out fire
We've been putting out fire
Well it's been so long, so long, so long
Yes it's been so long so long so long
I've been putting out fire (it's been so long, so long, so long)
I've been putting out fire (it's been so long, so long, so long)
Yeah, yeah putting out fire (been so long, so long, so long)
Been putting out fire (been so long, so long, so long)
Yeah putting out fire (been so long, so long, so long)
Putting out fire (been so long, so long, so long)
It's been so long (Been so long, so long, so long)
It's been so long (been so long, so long, so long)
I've been putting out fire (been so long, so long, so long)
