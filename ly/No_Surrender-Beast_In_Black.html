		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your eyes have seen more death than life
And the final page is all you write
Evil shadow looms upon your star
A memory forever scarred
Just close your eyes for a moment of truth
See with your heart
And a new hope will bloom

Keep the faith alive
Don't give up the fight
Remember, in the burning heart
There can never be surrender at all

Fearless to the bone
Master of your own creation
Born to walk alone
They will never own your burning heart
No surrender

When the skin is thin and the flesh shows through
Smoking guns take aim at you
Victimized by a fate so dire
Now a messenger of true hellfire
Raging willpower unleashed from below
Nothing can stop you
There's nothing that strong

Keep the faith alive
Don't give up the fight
Remember, in the burning heart
There can never be surrender at all

Fearless to the bone
Master of your own creation
Born to walk alone
They will never own your burning
No, no, no surrender
No, no, no surrender
No

Keep the faith alive
Don't give up the fight
Remember, in the burning heart
There can never be surrender at all

Fearless to the bone
Master of your own creation
Born to walk alone
They will never own your burning heart
No surrender

No surrender
