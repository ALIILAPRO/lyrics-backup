		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wake up every evenin'
With a big smile on my face
And it never feels out of place
And you're still probably workin'
At a nine to five pace
I wonder how bad that tastes

When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell

Now, where's your picket fence, love?
And where's that shiny car?
And did it ever get you far?
You never seemed so tense, love
I've never seen you fall so hard
Do you know where you are?

And truth be told, I miss you (I miss you)
And truth be told, I'm lyin'

When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell

Tomorrow you'll be thinkin' to yourself
Yeah, where'd it all go wrong?
But the list goes on and on

And truth be told, I miss you (I miss you)
And truth be told, I'm lyin'

When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell

Now, you'll never see what you've done to me
You can take back your memories, they're no good to me
And here's all your lies, you can look me in the eyes
With the sad, sad look that you wear so well

When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell

When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell (hope it gives you hell)
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell (hope it gives you hell)
When you hear this song and you sing along, but you never tell (but you never tell)
Then you're the fool, I'm just as well, hope it gives you hell (hope it gives you hell)
When you hear this song, I hope that it will give you hell (hope it gives you hell)
You can sing along, I hope that it puts you through hell
