		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wo-oo-ooh hoh!
I have walked this earth
And watched people

It doesn't scare me at all
I can be sincere
And say I like them

It doesn't scare me at all
An-bithelafter-mer
An-yeah-hoh-oh
An-be-ja-a-a-ha-ha

You can't say no to hope
Can't say no to happiness

I want to go on a mountain-top
With a radio and good batteries
And play a joyous tune and
Free the human race
From suffering

It doesn't scare me at all
I'm no fucking Buddhist
But this is enlightenment

The less room you give me
The more space I've got

It doesn't scare me at all
An-chamel-after
An-yeah-hoh-oh
An-be-ja-a-a-ha-ha

You can't say no to hope
Can't say no to happiness

It doesn't scare me at all
I want to be on a mountain-top
With a radio and good batteries
And play a joyous tune and
Free the
A-human race
From suffering

It doesn't scare me at all
This is an alarm-call
So wake-up, wake-up now
Woo-oo-ooh!
Today has never happened
And it doesn't frighten me

It doesn't scare me at all
An-bithel-after
An-yeah-hoh-oh
An-che-ja-a-a-ha-ha

You can't say no to hope
You can't say no to happiness
Wo-oo-ooh!

It doesn't scare me at all, wo-oo-ooh!
