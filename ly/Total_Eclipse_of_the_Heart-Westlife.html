		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Turnaround, every now and then I get a little bit
Lonely and you're never coming round
Turnaround, every now and then I getta little bit
Tired of listening to the sound of my tears
Turnaround, every now and then I get a little bit
Nervous that the best of all the years have gone by
Turnaround, every now and then I get a little bit
Terrified and then I see the look in your eyes
Turnaround bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart
Turnaround bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
Cause we'll never be wrong together
We can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time (all of the time)
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart
Once upon a time there was light in my life
But now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart

Turnaround, every now and then I get a little bit
Restless and I dream of something wild
Turnaround, every now and then I get a little bit
Helpless and I'm lying like a child in your arms
Turnaround, every now and then I get a little bit
Angry and I know I've got to get out and cry
Turnaround, every now and then I get a little bit
Terrified but then I see the look in you eyes
Turnaround bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart
Turnaround bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
Cause we'll never be wrong together
We can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time (all of the time)
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart

A total eclipse of the heart
A total eclipse of the heart
A total eclipse of the heart
A total eclipse of the heart
