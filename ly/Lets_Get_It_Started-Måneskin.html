		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In this context, there's no disrespect
So when I bust my rhyme, you break ya necks
We got five minutes for us to disconnect
From all intellect, collect the rhythm effect
To lose your inhibition follow your intuition
Free your inner soul and break away from tradition
'Cause when we be out, girlies pull the heat out
You wouldn't believe how, we wow shit out
Burnin' 'til it's burned out, turn it 'til it's turned out
Act it up from North, West, East, South

'Cause everybody, everybody
Just get into it and get it started
Get it started, get it started, get it started
Let's get it started, ha, let's get it started in here
Let's get it started, ha, let's get it started in here
Let's get it started, ha, let's get it started in here
Let's get it started, ha, let's get it started in here
Hey, hey

So lose control, of body and soul
Don't move too fast, people, just take it slow
Don't get ahead, just jump into it
Y'all hear about it, the Peas will do it
And get started, and get stupid
Don't worry about it, people will walk you through it
Step by step like you're into New Kid
Inch by inch with the new solution
They transmit hits with no delusion
The feeling's irresistible and that's how we movin', so

Everybody, everybody, just get into it and get stupid 
Get it started, get it started, get it started
Let's get it started, ha, let's get it started in here
Let's get it started, ha, let's get it started in here
Let's get it started, ha, let's get it started in here
Let's get it started, ha, let's get it started in here, yeah

Let's get ill, that's the deal
At the gate we'll bring the bugged out drill (just)
Lose your mind, this is the time
Y'all test this drill, just and bang your spine (just)
Bob your head like me, apl.de
Up inside the club or in your Bentley so
Get messy, loud and sick
Y'all mind pass normal on another head trip
So, come them now, do not correct it
Let's get ignorant, let's get hectic

And everybody, everybody, just get into it and get started 
Get it started, get it started, get it started
Let's get it started, ha, let's get it started in here
Let's get it started, ha, let's get it started in here
Let's get it started, ha, let's get it started in here
Let's get it started, ha, let's get it started in here, oh yeah
