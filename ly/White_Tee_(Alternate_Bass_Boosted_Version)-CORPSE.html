		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I spilt wine all on my white tee, bitches like me (yeah)
CORPSE, you off the deep end, well, bitch, I might be (yeah)
These girls, they tryna blind me, fuck out my life please (yeah)
I ain't got no time if you ain't beside me (yeah)

Get up 7 AM, but I haven't slept in days
Acid on my vocals, that's the price I gotta pay, yeah
Karma tryna rob me, all about me, fuck away, yeah
Death always upon me when I come up out the shade, yeah

What you tryna say, huh?
What you tryna say?
Oh, you love me and you miss me? Yeah, I get it that's okay
Reluctantly, I get you, but you know it ain't the same
But-but once you fuck me over, no do-overs, we don't play

I spilt wine all on my white tee, bitches like me (yeah)
CORPSE, you off the deep end, well, bitch, I might be (yeah)
These girls they tryna blind me, fuck out my life please (yeah)
I ain't got no time if you ain't beside me

9 lives on 8 cat bitches, 7 witches from The 6 (yeah)
5 are tryna find me, wanna fly out 4 the dick (uwu)
3 times her boyfriend tried me, had 2 tell them they ain't shit (yeah)
1 be blowing up my phone, tryna fight me for a bitch (yeah)

Don't follow me baby, swear I'm going to hell
Think I'm looking for a piece of you in somebody else
'Cause ever since I been leaving, I'm fucked up on something else
We just hooked up on the weekend, I keep her up on the shelf

I spilt wine all on my white tee, bitches like me (yeah)
CORPSE, you off the deep end, well, bitch, I might be (yeah)
These girls they tryna blind me, fuck out my life please (yeah)
I ain't got no time if you ain't beside me (yeah)
