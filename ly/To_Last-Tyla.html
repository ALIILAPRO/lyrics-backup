		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never thought you'd be that way
Holding on to every small mistake
Can't beg for love to stay
Never thought you'd be my first heartbreak
Don't know what more to say
Family askin' where on earth you've been?
Can't beg for love to stay
My first love is now my first heartbreak

You never gave us a chance
It's like you never wanted to last
You never gave us a chance
It's like you never wanted to last
(To last, to last, to last)
(To last, to last, to last)
(To last, to last, to last)
(To last, to last)

Ripped away a part of me
You left me here to bleed
It's the way you say, "Baby, please hold on to me"
Don't want you to be a memory (oh)

You never gave us a chance
It's like you never wanted to last (oh, oh)
You never gave us a chance
It's like you never wanted to last
To last, to last

To last, to last
