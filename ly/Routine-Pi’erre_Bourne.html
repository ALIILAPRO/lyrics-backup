		<p>
		  Aw, shit (yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)

Let's switch positions, stack my commission
Fuck all the bitches, gotta get your riches
(Damn, Pi'erre, where'd you find this?)
She gave me her digits, shoot your shot like ammunition
Money talk, my pockets critics, yeah
Fuck the check up, yeah
Fuck the check up, yeah, fuck the check up, yeah
Private jet us, yeah, new necklace, yeah
They respect us, yeah, 'cause I got my check up, yeah

Said I had a nip and tuck, wait
Band-Aid, she got cut, wait
2 Ms, I got bucks
Chain on ice, Mighty Duck
When you pullin' up, wait, send a Uber truck, wait
Give 'em all stars like Chucks, Postmate a toothbrush
And my money won't shut up, wait
Money talk too much, wait
Thirty bands on this necklace, she wet as fuck
Now I might know what you want from me
Get high from my lows, it was hard for me
I hurt her soul, I'm so sorry
Yeah, just let her go, these hoes 'round me
She won't understand
I just roll this contraband, think about my fam
She just listen to her friends, watch my Instagram

Let's switch positions, stack my commission
Fuck all the bitches, gotta get your riches
(Yo Pi'erre, wanna come out here?)
She gave me her digits, shoot your shot like ammunition
Money talk, my pockets critics, yeah
Fuck the check up, yeah 
Fuck the check up, yeah, fuck the check up, yeah
Private jet us, yeah, new necklace, yeah
They respect us, yeah, 'cause I got my check up, yeah

Got my hands on money like Mancala, ooh (like Mancala, like Mancala)
I'm a dog on the pussy, real Rottweiler, yeah, yeah (real Rottweiler)
Yeah, my family's real top shotta (Real top shotta, real top shotta)
Got your bitch with me, what about her? (what about her? What about her?)
She's not answering in the shower (in the shower, in the shower)
She fuck with the stars like it's Power (Like it's Power, like it's Power)
'Cause I be going hard, need new shower (need new shower, need new shower)
I got all this green and this sour (green and sour, green and sour)

Let's switch positions, stack my commission
Fuck all the bitches, gotta get your riches (huh, huh, wait)
She gave me her digits, shoot your shot like ammunition
Money talk, my pockets critics, yeah
Fuck the check up, yeah
Fuck the check up, yeah, fuck the check up, yeah
Private jet us, yeah, new necklace, yeah
They respect us, yeah, 'cause I got my check up (up)

Make sure to stop in now
We have twelve new flavors of limited edition sauce

Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?
