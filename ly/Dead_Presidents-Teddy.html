		  [Intro]
Castle Life
Say

[Chorus]
All my presidents is dead
Shot him in the head
All I see is red
All I see is red
Presidents is dead
Shot him in the head
All I see is red
All I see is red

[Verse 1]
Coke right on the nose
Talking to a ghost
So I brought the light
That shit start a fight
But that shit do or die
Where do you reside?
I'm searching in my dreams for you
But I saw you on the other side
I saw you in another life
I saw you on the other side
I saw you on the other side
I saw you on the other side


[Chorus]
Presidents is dead
Shot him in the head
All I see is red
All I see is red
Presidents is dead
Shot him in the head
All I see is red
All I see is red

[Interlude]
All I see
All I see
All I see
All I see, yeah

[Chorus]
Presidents is dead (All I see)
Shot him in the head (All I see)
All I see is red (All I see)
All I see is red (All I see)
Presidents is dead (All I see)
Shot him in the head (All I see)
All I see is red (All I see)
All I see is red (All I see)
Presidents is dead (All I see)
Shot him in the head (All I see)
All I see is red (All I see)
All I see is red
