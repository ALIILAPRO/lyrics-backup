		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something isn’t right with us
I’ve been listening paying attention
You don’t listen you be given
You been spending up
Your time out there lying oh no no no
You’re like Novacaine novacaine

Something isn’t right with us
I’ve been listening paying attention
You don’t listen you be given
You been spending up
Your time out there lying oh no no no
You’re like Novacaine novacaine

You don’t fuck with me you
Just fuck with my feelings
Steady wasting time that’s why
Focused on these millions
I keep searching cause it
Feelings like something’s missing
But keep ducking with these
Chicks with bad intentions bad intentions
Damn when I think about it
Really waste a lot time if I think about
Saying I’m drowning in pain let’s
Have a drink about
Seeing pretty face got me think
What may be behind it your fake smiling
There’s no way around it
Tired of getting fake love but
That’s all I’m finding
If you call this shit a
Game well i I’m retiring
Stay focused gotta keep my cool
My natural climate i keep reminding
Staying cool and staying focus on this mula
When I meet you I sized you up like a ruler
Had my niggas saying damn like nigga who her
But til this day I wish I never knew her
I swear these bitch won’t do
Nothing but drive you crazy
Talking shit up on my line all
That lying don’t faze me
You know it hurts when I say
This cause you my baby
But all that love you said you
Had you was just faking
And I really been low you tell lately
Mixed emotions due to the pills I’m taking
Left me broke, uneasy, and shaken
I gotta quit this shit tired
Of hearing hearts breaking

Something isn’t right with us
I’ve been listening paying attention
You don’t listen you be given
You been spending up
Your time out there lying oh
You’re like Novacaine novacaine

Something isn’t right with us
I’ve been listening paying attention
You don’t listen you be given
You been spending up
Your time out there lying oh
You’re like Novacaine novacaine
