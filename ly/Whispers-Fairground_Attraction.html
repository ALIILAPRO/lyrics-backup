		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The way she whispers the stories I have heard
In captivation my eyes are wide with her words
So much respect in here
My heart is blowing up to burst

With one step forward she leads me by the hand
I think I'll make it though stars up in the sky
They show we're all the same and some day soon they say 
We all must die

Tell them all
Wrap them up in fire with your love
Here I am

Somebody told me the answer's in the fight
Grab all you can take everything in sight
Don't care if I sit here forever
Holding nothing but my heart

She whispered to me, "It makes no difference
You get what you give and only then 
Just enough to make you happy no more no less
Too much is too absurd

Tell them all
Wrap them up in fire with your love
Here I am

She speaks in silence her work is never done
But still goes on 'til the battle she has won
But for a moment I thought I saw her
Dancing in the stars
