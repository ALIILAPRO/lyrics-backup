Oh boy you got a nice bicycle

My heart hugs your hairy butt
Guinea pig romance

Hey your goldfish sucks
Alpacas make me angry

Come on everybody 
Put your fucking hands up
What?
Fucking hands up!

I miss you so
I miss you so
Give me an M
For muffin purper-gurk
So hard to be alone
Now I'm on my own

I miss you
I adore you
It's hard to say
In love, muffin purper-gurk

I miss you
I adore you
It's hard to say
In love, muffin purper-gurk
