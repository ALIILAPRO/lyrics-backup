		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh
Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh

My condition's benign (duh, duh, duh)
And as rare as it gets (duh, duh, duh)
They know what it looks like (duh, duh, duh)
But only God knows why it exists (duh, duh, duh)
It's practically harmless (duh, duh, duh)
There's no need for concern (duh, duh, duh)
And I drown in my antibiotics (duh, duh, duh)
Lest it get any worse (duh, duh, duh)

I can't believe it (duh, duh, duh)
Dear God, could you be more subtle next time? (Duh, duh, duh)
And I'll take the bait, 'cause (duh, duh, duh)
For the very first time in my life (duh, duh, duh)
I'm fixing to bite (duh, duh, duh)

Duh, duh, duh
Duh, duh, duh

I'll cover my chest (duh, duh, duh)
I'll laugh all the way home (duh, duh, duh)
'Cause the name of my illness (duh, duh, duh)
Is just one letter short of my own (duh, duh, duh)
I must've been greedy (duh, duh, duh)
Surely I engaged in some cardinal sin ('cause now) (duh, duh, duh)
My favorite animal is engraved on the sides of my ribs (duh, duh, duh)

I can't believe it (duh, duh, duh)
Dear God, could you be more subtle next time? (Duh, duh, duh)
The colorful plastic (duh, duh, duh)
That you put on the end of your line (duh, duh, duh)
Is it really alive? (Duh, duh, duh)
I can't believe it (duh, duh, duh)
Dear God, could you be more subtle next time? (Duh, duh, duh)
And I'll take the bait, 'cause (duh, duh, duh)
For the very first time in my life (duh, duh, duh)
I'm fixing (duh, duh, duh)

(Good luck)
Divine intervention and the gnashing of teeth
The chain 'round my neck and the sign on the back of the Jeep, oh
And now that He's marked me, I know I was terribly wrong
I'm not scared of Death, no
I'm scared of God

I can't believe it (duh, duh, duh)
Dear God, could you be more subtle next time? (Duh, duh, duh)
And I'll take the bait, 'cause (duh, duh, duh)
For the very first time in my life (duh, duh, duh)
I'm fixing to bite (duh, duh, duh)
