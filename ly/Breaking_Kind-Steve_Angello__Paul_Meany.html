		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Starting things off like we do
Was bound to get us nowhere more than lovers
I'm not trying to pretend 
That I'm not just as shallow as the others

Dead end conversations high on chemical sensations
Get me every time, every time
I'm never sure where things go wrong
Except we're still the same old song playing in my mind
Don't be surprised

'Cause if you want the stars
We can turn the night into heaven's light
But if you want this heart
Don't waste your time
If that heart of yours is the breaking kind

If that heart of yours is the breaking kind

If that heart of yours is the breaking kind

Patience, we'll be over soon
And I'll be fine when you find someone better
But if we're staying
Love might be for you
Won't you stay right here
Let's waste away together

Dead end conversations high on chemical sensations
Get me every time, every time
I'm never sure where things go wrong
Except we're still the same old song playing in my mind
Don't be surprised

'Cause if you want the stars
We can turn the night into heaven's light
But if you want this heart
Don't waste your time
If that heart of yours is the breaking kind

If that heart of yours is the breaking kind

If that heart of yours is the breaking kind

If that heart of yours is the breaking kind

If that heart of yours is the breaking kind
