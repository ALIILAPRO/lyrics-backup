		  Nahreel on the beat

All my life all my life I'm waiting (Eh yaya)
All my life I look at you daily (Eh yaya)
All my life you make it amazing (Eh yaya)
All my life your love I'm inhaling (Eh yaya)

Turn around I wanna see your face in the morning (I wanna see your face in the morning)
You turn around I'm not gonna give you a warning (I'm not gonna give you a warning)
Turn around I wanna see your face in the morning
You turn around I'm not gonna give you a warning

I got you anytime you need me hunnie
Around you I treasure every moment
I got you anytime you need me hunnie
Around you I treasure every moment

Look here baby (Look here baby)
Would you come for a moment (Would you come for a moment)
If you still can't baby (If you still can't baby)
Would you come in the morning (Would you come in the morning)

Look here baby (Look here baby)
Would you come for a moment (Would you come for a moment)
If you still can't baby (If you still can't baby)
Would you come in the morning (Would you come in the morning)

All my nights all my nights I'm waiting (All my nights I'm waiting)
All my nights I look at you daily (I look at you daily)
All my night you make it amazing (You make it amazing)
All my night your love I'm inhaling (Your love I'm inhaling)

I'm feeling like like in the night nikuone (Night nikuone)
I'm feeling like I'm gonna have it all in the morning (Morning)
I'm feeling like like in the night nikuone (Night nikuone)
I'm feeling like I'm gonna have it all in the morning (Morning)

I got you anytime you need me hunnie
Around you I treasure every moment
I got you anytime you need me hunnie
Around you I treasure every moment

Look here baby (Look here baby)
Would you come for a moment (Would you come for a moment)
If you still can't baby (If you still can't baby)
Would you come in the morning (Would you come in the morning)

Look here baby (Look here baby)
Would you come for a moment (Would you come for a moment)
If you still can't baby (If you still can't baby)
Would you come in the morning (Would you come in the morning)

I feel I want all your body
I feel I want all your body
I feel I want all your body
I feel I want all your body
I feel I want all your body
I feel I want all your body
I feel I want all your body
I feel I want all your body
