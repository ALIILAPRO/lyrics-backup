		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hello (hello)
Uh, you know you look even better 
Than the way you did the night before (before)
And the moment that you kissed my lips 
You know I start to feel wonderful (wonderful)
It's something incredible, there's sex in your chemicals
Oh (there's sex in your chemicals)

Ooh, let's go
Uh, you're the best way I know to escape the extraordinary (ordinary)
This world ain't for you and I know for damn sure 
This world ain't for me (world ain't for me)
Lift off and say goodbye
Just let your fire set me free

Oh, moonshine, take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time

I know (I know)
Uh, I was with you last night 
But it feels like it's been so long (so long)
And everybody that's around me knows
That I'm not myself when your gone (self when your gone)
It's good to see you again, good to see you again
On top of the world (the world)
Uh, is where I stand when you're back in my life (in my life)
Life's not so bad when you're way up this high
Everything is alright ('thing is alright)
Everything is alright

Oh, moonshine, take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time

Oh, moonshine, your love it makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time

Don't look down, don't you never look back
We are not afraid to die young and live fast
Give me good times, give me love, give me laughs
Let's take a ride to the sky before the night is gone

Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time

Oh, moonshine, your love it makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
