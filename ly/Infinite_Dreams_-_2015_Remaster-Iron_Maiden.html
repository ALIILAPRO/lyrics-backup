		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Infinite dreams, I can't deny them
Infinity is hard to comprehend
I couldn't hear those screams
Even in my wildest dreams

Suffocation, waking in a sweat
Scared to fall asleep again
In case the dream begins again
Someone chasing, I cannot move
Standing rigid, a nightmare's statue
What a dream, when will it end?
And will I transcend?

Restless sleep, the mind's in turmoil
One nightmare ends, another fertile
It's getting to me, so scared to sleep
But scared to wake now, in too deep

Even though its reached new heights
I rather like the restless nights
It makes me wonder, makes me think
There's more to this, I'm on the brink
It's not the fear of what's beyond
It's just that I might not respond
I have an interest, almost craving
But would I like to get too far in?

It can't be all coincidence
Too many things are evident
You tell me you're an unbeliever
Spiritualist? Well, me I'm neither
But wouldn't you like to know the truth?
Of what's out there, to have the proof?
And find out just which side you're on
Where would you end in Heaven or in Hell?

Yeah, oh

Help me
Help me to find my true self without seeing the future
Save me
Save me from torturing myself even within my dreams, ow

There's got to be
Just more to it than this
Or tell me, why do we exist?
I'd like to think that when I die
I'd get a chance, another time
And to return and live again
Reincarnate, play the game
Again and again and again and again
