		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't see where you comin' from
But I know just what you runnin' from
And what matters ain't the, who's baddest but
The ones who stop you fallin' from your ladder, baby

feel like you feelin' now
I'm doin' things just to please your crowd
When I love you like the way I love you
And I suffer, but I ain't gonna cut you 'cause

This ain't no place for no hero
This ain't no place for no better man
This ain't no place for no hero
To call home

This ain't no place for no hero
This ain't no place for no better man
This ain't no place for no hero
To call home

Every time I close my eyes, I think
I think about you inside
And your mother, givin' up on askin' why
Why you lie, and you cheat, and you try to make
A fool outta she

I can't see where you comin' from
But I know just what you're runnin' from
And what matters ain't the, who's baddest but the
Ones who stop you fallin' from your ladder, 'cause

This ain't no place for no hero
This ain't no place for no better man
This ain't no place for no hero
To call home

This ain't no place for no hero
This ain't no place for no better man
This ain't no place for no hero
To call home

This ain't no place for no hero
This ain't no place for no better man
This ain't no place for no hero
To call home
