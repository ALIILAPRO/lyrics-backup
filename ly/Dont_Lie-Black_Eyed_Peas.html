		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Uh, huh
La, da, da, da, da
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

Hey, baby my nose is getting big
I noticed it be growing when I been telling them fibs
Now you say your trust's gettin' weaker
Probably 'cause my lies just started gettin' deeper
And the reason for my confession is that I learn my lesson
And I really think you have to know the truth
Because I lied and I cheated and I lied a little more
But after I did it I don't know what I did it for
I admit that I have been a little immature
With your heart like I was the pre-da-tor
In my book of lies I was the editor
And the author
I forged my signature
And now I apologize for what I did to ya
'Cause what you did to me I did to you

No, no, no, no baby, no, no, no, no don't lie
No, no, no, no, yeah you know, know, know, know you gotta try
What you gonna do when it all comes out
When I'm here to see you, what you're all about
No, no, no, no baby, no, no, no, no don't lie
Yeah you know, know, know, know, you gotta try (stop, st-st-stop, st-st-stop lying)

She said I'm leaving
'Cause she can't take the pain
It's hard to continue this love it ain't the same
Can't forget the things that I've done inside her brain
Too many lies committed too many games
She feeling like a fool getting on the last train
Tryin' to maintain but the feeling won't change
I'm sorry for the things that I've done and what I became
Caught up in living my life in the fast lane
Blinded by lights, cameras, you know the fame
I don't know the reason why I did these things

And I lie and I lie
And I lie and I lie

And now our emotions are drained
'Cause I lie and I lie and a little lie lie
And now your emotions are drained

No, no, no, no baby, no, no, no, no don't lie (no don't you lie)
No, no, no, no, yeah you know, know, know, know you gotta try (you gotta try, gotta try)
What you gonna do when it all comes out (what you gonna do baby)
When I'm here to see you, what you're all about
No, no, no, no baby, no, no, no, no don't lie
Because you know, know, know, know, you gotta try

Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ba da, ba da, ba da, ba da, badabada, badabada, badabada, badabada
Ba da, ba da, ba da, ba da, badabada, badabada, badabada, badabada

Yo, I'm lying to my girl
Even though I love her
And she all in my world
I give her all my attention and diamonds and pearls
She's the one who makes me feel on top of the world
Still I lie to my girl, I do it

And I lie and I lie and I lie (and then I lie) 'til there's no turning back
I don't know why, and I lie and I lie 'til I don't know who I am

No, no, no, no baby, no, no, no, no don't lie (don't you lie)
No, no, no, no, yeah you know, know, know, know you gotta try (you know, you know, you gotta)
What you gonna do when it all comes out
When I'm here to see you, what you're all about
No, no, no, no baby, no, no, no, no don't lie 
No, no, no babe, no, no, no, no (stop, st-st-stop, st-st-stop lying)
