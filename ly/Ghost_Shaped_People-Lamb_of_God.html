		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A message in the bottle smashed right across your head
All those years of screaming out the words you never read
Sucking on a xenon tit, all hail the cretin king
Apprentice to an idiot, a sycophantic dream

They say jump, you ask how high
And watch your freedom die

What will you believe?
Who will you betray?
What will you believe?
Who will you betray?
What's the cost of victory?

You always took the easy road, you always compromised
You never put the effort in to read between the lines
Rutting in a garbage pit, embrace the weaker breed
Join the pack of rabid dogs and lick the hand that beats

On the cattle car, full speed ahead
Your ticket to regret

What will you believe?
Who will you betray?
What will you believe?
Who will you betray?
What's the cost of victory?

A screaming paradigm of dysfunction
A superficial sea of reaction
A violent passion surrogate
You tied the noose around your own neck

What will you believe?
Who will you betray?
What is the cost of victory?

What will you believe?
Who will you betray?
What is the cost of victory?

The cost of victory
