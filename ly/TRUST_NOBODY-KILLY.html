		  Woo
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Woo
Woo, yee, yee

I can't trust nobody (what?)
Scared money don't make money (what? What? Yeah)
I can't trust nobody (hey, what?)
Scared money don't make money (what? What? Woo)

On road taking risks (risks)
One flight out the 6ix (whoa)
Now I'm rocking that Rick (whoa)
You do not know what this is (whoa)
You do not know how it feels (no)
To wake up in them Hills
Appeals coming in the mail
And too many telling the tales (yeah)
Bright lights, bad bitch all love me (bitch)
Pay the price of fate
Take you like it's nothing (what? No, no, no, no, no, no)
Made something out of nothing
Don't ask me no questions, I'm thumbing through these hundreds (bands)
I hit a stain and I made me the man
Too many want to involve me in plans
Business is business, I'm not shaking hands (whoa)
What's going on, man?
Turned a gram to a grand
I got these bands in my pants

I can't trust nobody (what?)
Scared money don't make money (what? What? Yeah)
I can't trust nobody (hey, what?)
Scared money don't make money (what? What? What?)
