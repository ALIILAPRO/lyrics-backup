		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What if I was never broken
What if I was someone else
What if word was meant to
Be said but unspoken
And I would know what lays ahead

I had everything and nothing will remain
I torn apart rest of the word
And walked into the brawl of silence
And no god can heal our wounds

And this thoughts sense away
The dawn of a broken day carries me away
What if I feed the fire
Lined by your touch I fell behind
When a fist full of burns will in fire
In time we'll learn how
To destroy your reflection
Thought but truly my shadow was alone

I take my mask and place it in the dust
The sun burns through my shelter
My flesh peels off there is nothing I can do
But embrace the pain as something new

And this thoughts sense away
The dawn of a broken day carries me away
What if I feed the fire

What if I'm not who I think I am
What if I am something else
What if I can prove to you
That I always been somewhere else
