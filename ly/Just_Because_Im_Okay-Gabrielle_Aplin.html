		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So there's this thing
I don't know what it is, but I can't put it down
See, there's this thing
Wish I could show it to you, but I don't know how
So I keep carrying it 'round

I'm wide awake, wide awake, I can't explain, can't escape
If the issue's on my mind, is the issue only mine?
Don't complain, push it down, but who are you to explain
How I look like I'm doing just fine?

Just because I'm okay doesn't mean it's okay
Inside I'm like a hurricane, but you'd never tell
Even though I'm coping, couldn't feel that same control
And just because I carry it well, don't mean it isn't heavy

Sometimes I feel like I should live with it
Make you believe I'm tough, but now I've woken up
Each further hits me like a tonne of bricks from you
But now I've had enough
You try picking it up

I'm wide awake, wide awake, I can't explain, can't escape
If the issue's on my mind, is the issue only mine?
Don't complain, push it down, but who are you to explain
How I look like I'm doing just fine?

Just because I'm okay doesn't mean it's okay
Inside I'm like a hurricane, but you'd never tell
Even though I'm coping, couldn't feel that same control
Yeah, just because I carry it well, don't mean it isn't heavy

Mean it isn't heavy, no
Don't mean it isn't heavy, oh, no, no
Hmm

Just because I'm okay doesn't mean it's okay
Inside I'm like a hurricane, but you'd never tell
Even though I'm coping, couldn't feel that same control
Just because I carry it well, don't mean it isn't heavy
