		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My ego's telling me to let it go
I say goodbye, I say, but no
And when my mind says, "Yes", my heart is saying, "No"
It's such a chaos in my soul

I am just a lonely, lonely heart, I miss us
Quiet, lonely, sitting in dark, I see us
I'm closing every window of my heart, 'cause it's better
Better to let the past stay in the past, but still, I'm

I'm crying, crying, crying, stuck in yesterday
And I'm lonely, lonely, lonely, same old, same old, different day
I'm crying, crying, crying, such a rainy day
And I'm lonely, lonely, lonely, same old, same old, different day

(I'm crying, crying, crying)
(And I'm lonely, lonely, lonely)
(I'm crying, crying, crying)
(And I'm lonely, lonely, lonely, same old, same old, different day)

You took my breath when you left me
You took my soul when I need it
You made me weak when you hurt me
You took me everything

I am just a lonely, lonely heart, I miss us
Quiet, lonely, sitting in dark, I see us
I'm closing every window of my heart, 'cause it's better
Better to let the past stay in the past, but still, I'm

I'm crying, crying, crying, stuck in yesterday
And I'm lonely, lonely, lonely, same old, same old, different day
I'm crying, crying, crying, such a rainy day
And I'm lonely, lonely, lonely, same old, same old, different day

(I'm crying, crying, crying)
(And I'm lonely, lonely, lonely)
(I'm crying, crying, crying)
(And I'm lonely, lonely, lonely, same old, same old, different day)

I am just a lonely, lonely heart
Quiet, lonely, sitting in dark
I'm closing every window of my heart, 'cause it's better
Better to let the past stay in the past, but still, I'm

I'm crying, crying, crying, stuck in yesterday
And I'm lonely, lonely, lonely, same old, same old, different day
I'm crying, crying, crying, such a rainy day
And I'm lonely, lonely, lonely, same old, same old, different day
