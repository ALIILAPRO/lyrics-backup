		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nothing seems to kill me no matter how hard I try
Nothing is closing my eyes
Nothing can beat me down for your pain or delight
And nothing seems to break me
No matter how hard I fall 
Nothing can break me at all
Not one for giving up though not invincible I know

I've givin' everything I need
I'd give you everything I own
I'd give in if it could at least be ours alone
I've given everything I could
To blow it to hell and gone
Burrow down in and blow up the outside
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside world

Someone tried to tell me something
Don't let the world bring you down?
Nothing will do me in before I do myself
So save it for your own and the ones you can help

I've givin' everything I need
I'd give you everything I own
I'd give in if it could at least be ours alone
I've given everything I could
To blow it to hell and gone
Burrow down in and blow up the outside
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside world

Want to make it understood
Wanting though I never would
Trying though I know it's wrong
Blowing it to hell and gone
Wishing though I never could

Blow up the outside 
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside 
Blow up the outside world

Blow up the outside 
Blow up the outside 
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside world
Blow up the outside 

Blow up the outside 
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside 
Blow up the outside 
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside 
Blow up the outside 
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside 
Blow up the outside 
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside 
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside 
Blow up the outside
