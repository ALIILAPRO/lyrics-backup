		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like raindrops from the desert sky
For you, I've been waiting
Like seeing stars and endless nights
For you I'll be waiting

It's like I can breathe
Finally
Can we stay like this forever?

Want you taking me over
Come a little bit closer
A little bit closer
And wake up together
Bring me up from the under
Come a little bit closer
A little bit closer
Can we stay like this forever?

Want you taking me over
Come a little bit closer
A little bit closer
And wake up together
Bring me up from the under
Come a little bit closer

Can we stay like this forever?
Want you taking me over
Come a little bit closer
A little bit closer
And wake up together
Bring me up from the under
Come a little bit closer
Come a little closer

Like raindrops from the desert sky
For you I've been waiting
With your touch I come alive
For you I'll be waiting

It's like I can breathe
Can we stay like this forever?

Want you taking me over
Come a little bit closer
A little bit closer
And wake up together
Bring me up from the under
Come a little bit closer
Come a little closer
Can we stay like this forever?

Want you taking me over
Come a little bit closer
A little bit closer
And wake up together
Bring me up from the under
Come a little bit closer
Come a little closer
Come a little closer
