		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every time I see your face
I'm lost for words I don't know what to say
You're smiling at me like a wolf
I close my eyes as my skin crawls away
You can keep on making lists
I'll be happy making my mistakes
You'll be taking off your boxers
I'll be busy planning my escape
I won't stay but I can't leave
Some twisted sense of loyalty
You make me love the things I hate
Keep pushing me, pushing me, keep pushing me away
Please keep pushing me, pushing me, keep pushing me away
Pulling wings off butterflies
Just to hide the pain you feel inside
Keep telling yourself you're in charge
Telling yourself it will be alright
And you'll stay happy in the dark
I'll be drifting out towards the light
When you start to speak your mind
I'll just turn around and roll my eyes
I won't stay but I can't leave
Some twisted sense of loyalty
You make me love the things I hate
Keep pushing me, pushing me, keep pushing me away
Please keep pushing me, pushing me, keep pushing me away
Stop breathing down my neck
Do you understand me, yet?
Sometimes you have to lose
I'm living life for me not you
I won't stay but I can't leave
Some twisted sense of loyalty
You make me love the things I hate
Keep pushing me, pushing me, keep pushing me away
I won't stay but I can't leave
Some twisted sense of loyalty
You make me love the things I hate
Keep pushing me, pushing me, keep pushing me away
Please keep pushing me, pushing me, keep pushing me away
