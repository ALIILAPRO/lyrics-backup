		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somebody tell me what has this man got?
He makes me feel what I don't want to feel
And somebody tell me what has this man got?
He makes me give what I don't want to give

On solid ground
I feel myself sinking fast
I grab a hold
But I don't think it's gonna last

I'm slowly losin' my ground
Slowly sinkin' down
Trapped by this thing they call love
Ooh, baby 
(Hooked on this thing called love)
(Hooked on this thing called love)

Somebody tell me what has this man got?
He makes me cry
Lord, I don't want to cry
And somebody tell me
What has this man got?
He makes me lie
When I don't want to lie

He calls me up
And I tell 'em to say that I'm not in
Then I cry all night
If he doesn't call again

I'm slowly losin' my ground
Slowly sinkin' down
Trapped by this thing they call love
Ooh, baby

I'm slowly losin' my ground
Slowly sinkin' down
Trapped by this thing they call love
Ooh, baby

Trapped (hooked on this thing called love)
I can't help myself
Hooked on you, baby (on this thing called love)
I just can't help myself
I can never be happy (hooked on this thing called love)
And love no one else
Baby (hooked on this thing called love)
I love you
