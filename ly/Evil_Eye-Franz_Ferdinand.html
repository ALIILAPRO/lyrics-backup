		  Ooh, What's the color of the next car?
(Yeah, RED, ya bastard)
Yeah, RED, ya bastard
I don't believe in god, but I believe in this shit
Not me
I like to bring them down
Not me
Some fool who dumb dumb do
But not, not, not me

Uh, some people get a freak out of me
Some people can see that I can see
Some people want to see what I see
Some people put an evil eye on me

I have the evil eye
I see your soul
You wear it on your face
It's worn in what you do

What's the color of the next car?
(Yeah, RED, ya bastard)
Yeah, RED, ya bastard
I don't believe in god, but I believe in this shit
Not me
I like to bring them down
Not me
Some fool who dumb dumb do
But not, not, not me

Uh, some people get a freak out of me

It looks so clean
But I can see
The crawling, crawling creatures
Suspended in solution
No, no there's no solution

Uh, some people get a freak out of me
