		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Redcar Lane was the backdrop of my early days
Two dog of cider, Borough Park
Took me a while to find my place in Rye Hills School
Until I sang and played guitar
I love the people there, they always back the underdogs
And that was us down to a tea
The people ask me what it's like to see Los Angeles
I say, "It ain't no Redcar Beach"

Take me home, I just wanna feel ya
Take me home, give me all your light
Take me home, I belong in Teesside
It's long way back
Take me home
Take me home

Too many miles and too many streets away
Too long chasin' the gold
Since I was a child, I left of my trail of enemies
All in the name of hope
I honed my craft in a lion's den by the riverside
I stuck a target on my back
Growin' up 'round here, I learned no one will pity me
And I'm so thankful for that

Take me home, I just wanna feel ya
Take me home, give me all your light
Take me home, I belong in Teesside
Well, it's long way back
Take me home, I just wanna feel ya
Take me home, I said, give me all your light
Take me home, said, I belong in Teesside
And it's long way back
Take me home

Mm, take me home
Oh, take me home, take me home
Take me home

Said, this is my homecoming
This is my homecoming now
This is my homecoming
It's my homecoming
