		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can never truly see
Inside the ones you know
Until you've found them near
The edge of self-control

All I hear are lies, you're lying to yourself
And everything is out of control

You're just a fuckin' slave of discontent
I'm sick of watching you dig this hole

Time waits for no one
Won't stop it, can't be outrun
You know that pain in your head
Won't stop 'til the desperation ends

You've found yourself chasing death
Oblivious until the end
You'll never stop chasing death

Innocence, common sense, I don't see the relevance
Of anything that you've got to say
Parasite, socialite, you're never gonna win this fight
There is no fucking easy way out
No easy way out

I know I should have seen it all coming
But I had to find it out on my own
A whore to incompetence you hide behind
The shadow that once was your throne
Control is a discipline even when
Frustration just stands in your way
The throes of insanity feel just like a war inside you everyday

I know I should have seen it all coming
But I had to find it out on my own
A whore to incompetence you hide behind
The shadow that once was your throne
Control is a discipline even when
Frustration just stands in your way
The throes of insanity feel just like
A war inside you everyday

Time waits for no one
Won't stop, it can't be outrun
There's just no way of knowing
How long paranoia's growing
Can't stop the poison welling
Please just take away this feeling
You know that pain in your head
Won't stop until the desperation ends

You've found yourself chasing death
Oblivious until the end
You'll never stop until you're dead

Innocence, common sense, I don't see the relevance
Of anything that you've got to say
Parasite, socialite, you're never gonna win this fight
There is no fucking easy way out
No easy way out
No easy way out
No easy way out
No easy way out
