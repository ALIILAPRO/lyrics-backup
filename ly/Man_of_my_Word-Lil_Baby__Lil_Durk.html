		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't know what it took
(IRoccOnTheBeat)
You fucked Boona and Wuk
(Nile, I hear you)
(You made this shit, Pharaoh)

How she actin' funny, I bought her her titties?
Niggas she be fuckin' ain't none of my business
Uppin' my pole, that's a part of my fitness
Don't matter where I'm at, bitch, I'm known for the trenches
We the first niggas put drums in the city
We robbed the niggas, put drugs in the city
Fuck where you from 'cause I know that you with it
Check on his ass, I'ma handle my business
Trust you with nothin', fuck you more than once 
And you gotta be a killer just to hang with us
If you talkin' 'bout murders then I'm hangin' up
Run up on 'em, baow, ain't no one-on-one
I got the money, so who I'm runnin' from?
I got a lawyer that cost a honey bun
Before I buy pussy, I buy a hundred guns
Judge told me nigga died with my gun
Twenty ten briefs sayin' Ralph Lauren
Died close, feel like he died in my arms
Reinstated, they denied my bond
A nigga play with Smurk, you're not that smart
Sucked it twice, and I'm still not hard
Niggas cry out loud when they gettin' shot
That nigga worried, don't stand on my block
Fuck what you heard, I'm the man of my block

Stop playin', bitch, I'm Smurk
Bitch get naked, gotta put on my merch
I got your Uber, I kept my word
She freak, actin' like she a nerd
No shirt when I'm off this Perc'
They slide every time we hurt
Lost bro, I know it hurt
We gon' catch him first

Yeah, we run the game, now them boys gotta sit out
After I hit, tell her man, make her get out
Hundred mill' comin', I still ain't gon' chill out
I'm really that, I'ma show 'em how I get down
Hard on a bitch, man, I shoulda been pimpin'
Hard in these streets, the majority with me
He can't be serious, you gotta be kiddin' me
I'm really laughin', these lil' niggas temptin' me
I get offended when niggas say, "Tap in"
I buy the bro'nem Celine just to trap in
I got more clothes in my closet than Saks Fifth
I watched JB make a deuce do a backflip
I know you really don't know, you just act hip
I done took off for real, now how that feel?
Bro ain't never gon' change, I know that's real
This one outta here, straight to the backfield
I sleep good every night, now I'm happy
"How you go where you go?" I'm a trapper for real
"How you know what you know?" I adapted for real
We too rich with the feds, we put shit in the mail
My lifestyle expensive, this shit high as hell
Lil' bro tryna score, so I gave him a lay up
I gotta go somewhere, no, I can't lay up
Bitch, stop playin', you better not tell

Stop playin', bitch, I'm Smurk
Bitch get naked, gotta put on my merch
I got your Uber, I kept my word
She freak, actin' like she a nerd
No shirt when I'm off this Perc'
They slide every time we hurt
Lost bro, I know it hurt
We gon' catch him first
