		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What I've got is what you need
L, O, V, E, love
Say, what I've got is what you need
L, O, V, E, love

I've got the love if you need it, baby
I've got the love if you want it, baby

If you need my love, don't hesitate
Get it, get it

What I've got is what you need
Just some love, L, O, V, E
Say, what I've got is what you need
A little love L, O, V, E

What I've got is what you need
Just some love, L, O, V, E
Say, what I've got is what you need
A little love L, O, V, E

Are you looking for something so divine?
To try to get the shell of your spine
What could it be that you need?
Now there's no need to fear 'cause love is here

Are you looking for something so divine?

What I've got is what you need
L, O, V, E, love
Say, what I've got is what you need
L, O, V, E, love

Are you looking for something so divine?
To try to get the shell of your spine

If you need my love, don't hesitate
Get it, get it

What I've got is what you need
L, O, V, E, love
Say, what I've got is what you need
L, O, V, E, love

What I've got is what you need
L, O, V, E, love
Say, what I've got is what you need
L, O, V, E, love

What I've got is what you need
L, O, V, E, love
Say, what I've got is what you need
L, O, V, E, love
