		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now I find peace of mind
Finally found a way of thinking
Tried the rest found the best
Stormy day won't see me sinking

I can't conceal it like I know I did before
I got to tell you now the ship is ready
Waiting on the shore

Dare to look face the test on the eve
When you set sailing
What you've learned what you've earned
Ship of joy will stop you failing

I can't conceal it like I know I did before
I got to tell you now the ship is ready
Waiting on the shore

Wind is high so am I
As the shore sinks in the distance
Dreams unfold seek the gold
Gold that's brighter than the sunlight
Sail away see the day
Dawning on a new horizon
Gold's insight shining bright
Brighter than the sun that's rising

Three thousand sails on high are straining in the wind
A raging sea below is this voyage coming to an end
