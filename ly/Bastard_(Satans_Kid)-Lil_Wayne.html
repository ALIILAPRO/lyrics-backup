		  This is

Huh, mama used to say this when she stand above my baby crib
Never trust nobody that can bleed for five days and live
Grandma used to say that this world gon' come to a crazy end
Monsters in my closet was the feds taking baby pics
Daddy used to look at me like, "Who the fuck this baby is?"
Uncle used to say, "Your daddy just too young to raise a kid"
Daddy used to treat my mama like they never made a kid
I'm Satan's kid, I'm Satan's kid, I'm Satan's kid (I'm Satan's kid)

Uh, I know the tables turn like tornadoes turn
I know the way it turn, gotta wait your turn
Until you take your turn, fuck a wrong turn
I made the world turn, that's a turn off
I'm on every song that I turn on
I got it turnt up, got it turnt on
I'm on the turnpike, I'm 'bout to turn off
Weed loud as every siren they turn on
Bust down so bright, it's burning
These diamonds so white they German
Your diamonds ain't right, they turning
Cocaine white as my attorney
All types of guns, no type of permits
All types of coffins, all types of gurneys
From my driveway to my front door
It has been quite a journey

It has been quite a journey
From my driveway to my front door
It has been quite a journey

Huh, mama used to say this when she stand above my baby crib
Never trust nobody that can bleed for five days and live

Walking on water, this a new world order
These niggas out of order like a fish out of water
I'ma shoot the chopper like a fisheye camera
I'ma keep shooting 'til the bitch stop recording
Just don't start shootin', I don't feel like arguing
A real sharp, sharp shooter, I don't miss my target
I don't miss my thottie, I just miss my homie
Long walk in closet, I hope you feel like walking
Uh, I know the paper burn like it ought to burn
I know the paper burn for the long term
I know my bih concern when I toss and turn
I know my bih concerned 'bout the long term
I know the paper burn like the fire burn
I know it don't burn unless I confirm
I'm 'bout to cross my heart and watch my heart burn
Crossing me is like watching a cross burn
Swag go head to shoe
Bitch I'm fresh as a designer, yeah
Started from Ragu, made it way up to lasagna, yeah
Killers come behind you, can you say, "Murder for hire?"
Sippin' on purple papaya, gitchi ya-ya, yeah

Mama used to say this when she stand above my baby crib
Never trust nobody that can bleed for five days and live
Grandma used to say that this world gon' come to a crazy end
Monsters in my closet was the feds taking baby pics
Daddy used to look at me like, "Who the fuck this baby is?"
Uncle used to say, "Your daddy just too young to raise a kid"
Daddy used to treat my mama like they never made a kid
I'm Satan's kid, I'm Satan's kid, I'm Satan's kid (I'm Satan's kid)

Uh, I know the tables turn like tornadoes turn
I know the way it turn, gotta wait your turn
Until you take your turn, fuck a wrong turn
I made the world turn, that's a turn off
I'm on every song that I turn on
I got it turnt up, got it turnt on
I'm on the turnpike, I'm 'bout to turn off
Weed loud as every siren they turn on
Bust down so bright, it's burning
These diamonds so white they German
Your diamonds ain't right, they turning
Cocaine white as my attorney
All types of guns, no type of permits
All types of coffins, all types of gurneys
From my driveway to my front door
It has been quite a journey

It has been quite a journey
From my driveway to my front door
It has been quite a journey, nigga
