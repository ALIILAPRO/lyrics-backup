		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wake up to the sun rise sneaking through the window
You're asleep on your pillow right next to mine
cnd I realize that you made my skies
Go from grey to blue the moment I saw you

It's all fine and dandy
When you're holding me
In your arms so tight
It's all fine and dandy
Cause I know I got your love tonight

Baby I don't have to worry
Cause there's no hurry
To rush this love
You're the one that I want for the rest of my life
Oh you're the one my heart calls for everytime

It's all fine and dandy
When you're holding me
In your arms so tight
It's all fine and dandy
Cause I know I got your love tonight

It's all fine and dandy
When your holding me in your arms so tight
cnd it's all fine and dandy
Cause I know I got your love tonight

Yeah I know I got your love tonight
