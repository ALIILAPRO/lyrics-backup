		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It seems like yesterday we were cutting up in class
No worries in the world except chasing girls and burning gas
Then one day you wake up, you're tossing up them caps
Don't it seem like the good times go by too fast?

Yeah, I wish time would tick a little slower
Sometimes it feels like I blink and then it's over
Better soak it in, better make it last
Live it up while we can
'Cause the good times go by too fast

It feels like yesterday I walked in that bar
Wasn't looking for nothin', now look where we are
We're watching our kids growin' up in a flash
Don't it feel like the good times go by too fast?

Yeah, I wish time would tick a little slower
Sometimes it feels like I blink and then it's over
Better soak it in, better make it last
Live it up while we can
'Cause the good times go by too fast

Before you know it your baby's having babies
You're twenty-one, close your eyes then you're eighty
So laugh every laugh like it's your last
'Cause you can't get 'em back
The good times go by too fast

Yeah, I wish time would tick a little slower
Sometimes it feels like I blink and then it's over
Better soak it in, better make it last
Live it up while we can
'Cause the good times go by too fast

Ooh, the good times go by too fast
The good times go by too fast
