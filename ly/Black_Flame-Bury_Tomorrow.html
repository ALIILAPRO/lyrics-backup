		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here I stand, alone, with hate
Here I stand, too long, too late
All I know, is you will leave us all
Here I stand, alone, to fall

Oh my Brother, how could you?
Not look into the eyes of your fellow man
Who stood with you, through it all
And feel nothing in your heart but hate

Red stain on the blade
All sense of worth has been washed away
Sacrifice was all in vain, 
Where's the sense of guilt?
Where's the shame?

Lost soul in the unmarked grave
We have given a name (black flame)
In death we are all the same
Remain, black flame

Lost soul in the unmarked grave
We have given a name (black flame)
In death we are all the same
Remain, black flame

Here I stand, alone, with hate
Here I stand, too long, too late

Burn, and let your soul be free
As the flames rise high and your spirit leaves
Nightmares have become too real
Now the world is screaming and it's hard to hear

Red stain on the blade
All sense of worth has been washed away
How could you be hollow?
Now your life is doomed to sorrow

Lost soul in the unmarked grave
We have given a name (black flame)
In death we are all the same
Remain, black flame

Lost soul in the unmarked grave
We have given a name (black flame)
In death we are all the same
Remain, black flame

We are all the same (black flame)
We have given a name

Lost soul in the unmarked grave
We have given a name (black flame)
In death we are all the same
Remain, black flame

Lost soul in the unmarked grave
We have given a name (black flame)
In death we are all the same
Remain, black flame
