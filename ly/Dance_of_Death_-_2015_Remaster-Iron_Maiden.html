		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me tell you a story to chill the bones 
About a thing that I saw 
One night wandering in the everglades 
I'd one drink but no more 

I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight 
Gazing up at the stars 
Not aware of a presence so near to me 
Watching my every move 

Feeling scared and I fell to my knees 
As something rushed me from the trees 
Took me to an unholy place 
And that is where I fell from grace 

Then they summoned me over to join in with them 
To the dance of the dead 
Into the circle of fire, I followed them 
Into the middle, I was led 

As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear 
But still, I wanted to go 
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me 
As I walked onto the coals 

And I felt I was in a trance 
And my spirit was lifted from me 
And if only someone had the chance 
To witness what happened to me 

And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them 
All had death in their eyes 
Lifeless figures they were undead all of them 
They had ascended from hell 

As I danced with the dead 
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me 
Below my undead body
Just danced the circle of dead 

Until the time came to reunite us both 
My spirit came back down to me 
I didn't know if I was alive or dead 
As the others, all joined in with me 

By luck then a skirmish started 
And took the attention away from me 
When they took their gaze from me 
Was the moment that I fled 

I ran like hell faster than the wind 
But behind I did not glance 
One thing that I did not dare 
Was to look just straight ahead 

When you know that your time has come around 
You know you'll be prepared for it 
Say your last goodbyes to everyone 
And drink and say a prayer for it 

When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed 
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead 
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed 
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead 

To this day I guess I'll never know 
Just why they let me go 
But I'll never go dancing no more 
'Til I dance with the dead
