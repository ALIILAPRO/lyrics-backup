		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If i were a painter
Mixing my colors 
How could I ever find the blue of your eyes
The canvas could never capture the light of your smile
And girl if I were a sculpter
Working in my world 
I couldn't hope to appeal perfect face
The curve of your body
The feel of your skin
My hands could never ever trace

Chorus:
So I'll try and find a melody as beautiful as you
Find the words to say your eyes are bluer than blue
Fill my voice with the emotion I'm feeling for you
And now when the beat is so strong
I'll give my heart in a song

If I were an actor
I could be someone
Someone who always knows
The right things to say
But as soon as I see you 
I'd forget all my lines
And you'd never know what I feel inside

~Chorus~

There's no other way
That I know to say
Baby how much I love you
And if you'll only give me a chance
Oh girl
I will try and find a melody as beautiful as you
Find the words to say your eyes are bluer than blue
Fill my voice with the emotion i'm feeling for you
And now when the beat is so strong
I'll give my heart in a song

~Chorus~

Rap:
Yeah know I
I do what I do
Why 'cause your eyes are bluer than blue
Yeah I said I do what I do
-Sing-
I'll give my heart in a song
You know I'm not afriad of actin crazy
Baby it don't matter
I'll give my heart in a song
Rap:
Yeah I said I do what I do
Why i said 'cause your eyes are bluer than blue
-Sing-
I'll give my heart in a song
I'll give you my heart in a song
