		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lay so still
I've not a fight in me
Two feet apart
No resolve to seek

I've seen you
I've seen you too
I've learned from you
Run from everything
Run from everything

Dead flowers
Pressed against my lips
Dead flowers
Just another fix
Dead flowers
Rough against my skin
Dead flowers
Hold the memories in

The faith is lost, too much energy
Against the odds
Nothing left of me

Dead flowers
Pressed against my lips
Dead flowers
Just another fix
Dead flowers
Rough against my skin
Dead flowers
Hold the memories in

I've seen you
I've seen you too
I've learned from you
Run from everything
Run from everything

I've seen you
I see you

Dead flowers
Pressed against my lips
Dead flowers
Just another fix
Dead flowers
Rough against my skin
Dead flowers
Hold the memories in
