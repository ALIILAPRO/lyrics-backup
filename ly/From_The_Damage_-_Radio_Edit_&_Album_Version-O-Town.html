		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This time, I'm done with always screwing up
I'm sick of one direction down
I'm a broken picture frame
My whole world twisted inside out

Screaming voices like a hurricane
Telling me to wake up, get out of bed
Put your feet on the floor
There's fresh air out the door

And I've been acting so pathetic
Knocking around like a ball on a string
It's taking time for me to get it
I'm ready and willing to do anything to make it up to you

My arms are hurting so bad from being so empty
My heart weighs like a ton 'cause it feels so heavy
I'm standing here all alone, wishing that I could've known
You just can't walk away from the damage

Last time, I'm playing with a broken string
It don't matter no one's listening
'Cause losing you has made me see
I've gotta change, gotta blame it all on me

And I've been acting so pathetic
Knocking around like a ball on a string
It's taking time for me to get it
I'm ready and willing to do anything to make it up to you

My arms are hurting so bad from being so empty
My heart weighs like a ton 'cause it feels so heavy
I'm standing here all alone, wishing that I could've known
You just can't walk away from the damage

My eyes may as well be blind if I just can't see you
My hands may as well be tied 'cause I just can't touch you

Before the smoke can really clear away
From fires I started yesterday
I know I've gotta find a way
Somehow I've gotta find a way to wake up from the damage

My arms are hurting so bad from being so empty
My heart weighs like a ton 'cause it feels so heavy

I'm standing here all alone, wishing that I could've known
You just can't walk away from the damage
My eyes may as well be blind if I just can't see you
My hands may as well be tied 'cause I just can't touch you

I'm standing here all alone, wishing that I could've known
You just can't walk away from the damage
I'm standing here all alone, wishing that I could've known
You just can't walk away from the damage
