		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl you know that I'll do anything
To know a little more than just your name
Only thing I know is you're too fine
And I would like to leave with you tonight (Nicky Jam)

Girl you know that I'll do anything
To know a little more than just your name
Only thing I know is you're too fine
And I would like to leave with you tonight

Kid Ink
Hold up, hold up my baby
You not the ordinary
Fire just hit my lighter
And I see the way you dance when a song 
That you like come on and you start performing
Can't right the wrongs, keep it real
I been tryna keep it nice and all but my mind in the gutter only
I might kiss just to stutter on it
You know how to ride like it's butter on it
While I toast the champagne
In the summer on the coast the side of P-C-H
But I'll be on the way when you call me

Girl you know that I'll do anything
To know a little more than just your name
Only thing I know is you're too fine
And I would like to leave with you tonight

Want more than just your name
From where you came
Looking at you through me Ray-ban frames
Them girl a dime but girl you not the same
It's not you it's your mother me bless
Me want tell you straight
Let me explain
Keep it a hundred, come ride on the wave
Come through your tunnel up in my train
Just 'cause me fly on an air plane

You gon' call me papi
I'll make your body happy
Every time that you call me
You know that I'll take care of you

You gon' call me papi
I'll make your body happy
Every time that you call me
You know I want you, baby

Girl you know that I'll do anything
To know a little more than just your name
Only thing I know is you're too fine
And I would like to leave with you tonight

Girl you know that I'll do anything
To know a little more than just your name
Only thing I know is you're too fine
And I would like to leave with you tonight (I wanna leave with you)

Girl you know that I'll do anything (baby)
To know a little more than just your name
Only thing I know is you're too fine
And I would like to leave with you tonight
