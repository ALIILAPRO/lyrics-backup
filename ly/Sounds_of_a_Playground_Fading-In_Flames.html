		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can find all you need
The message is in the silence
Whisper words to calm your mind
Reach inside another playing come-around
It answers

We are ghosts of the concrete world
Genetic codes of a dying breed
Will I be left behind
Sounds of a playground fading

Staring into bright lights
I am what I've done
It is useless to hide
An empty chamber
Guess I was part of a plan

We are ghosts of the concrete world
Genetic codes of a dying breed
Will I be left behind
Sounds of a playground fading

We're running out of time
Can't seem to recognize
What put us here in the first place
Counting down the days, beginning of the end

We are ghosts of the concrete world
Genetic codes of a dying breed
Will I be left behind
Sounds of a playground fading
