		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What if all you understand
Could fit into the center of our hand
Then you found it wasn't you
Who held the sum of everything you knew

We're insane but not alone
We hold on
And let go

Like the sun, we will live to rise
Like the sun, we will live and die
And then ignite again
Like the sun, we will live to rise (oh yeah)

What if the one thing that I missed
Was everything I need to pass the test
And if I fail, what happens then?
Can I still count on you as a friend?

We're insane but not alone
We hold on
And let go

Like the sun, we will live to rise
Like the sun, we will live and die
And then ignite again
Like the sun, we will live to rise
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)

Like the sun, we will live to rise
Like the sun, we will live and die
And then ignite again

Like the sun, we will live to rise
Like the sun, we will live and die
And then ignite again
Like the sun, we will live to rise
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
