		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Listenin' in on everybody else
Talkin' about somethin' meaningless
Wishin' that someone would film the way I'm lookin' at you right now
I wanna watch it back and then kill myself
And I know it's not very sexy
When somebody loves you this much and knows you this well
But it's the way it is
And I sense it's not the best time
To be tryin' to fuck with your head and diggin' up old ground
So I squash it down

Step on up
Pay them no mind
You're alone with this one
And they're angry
Well it won't do no good
Together, with your problems, doll
Live alone, willingly (yeah)

I've been thinkin' about my storyline
And how your past becomes your present if it's always on your mind
We played Dionne Warwick, "Walk On By"
And Freddy put his head between his legs and cried

Step on up
Pay them no mind
You're alone with this one
And they're angry
Well it won't do no good
Together, with your problems, doll
Live alone, willingly (yeah)

Listenin' in on everybody else
Talkin' about somethin' meaningless
Wishin' that someone would film the way I'm lookin' at you right now
I wanna watch it back and then kill myself

Step on up
Pay them no mind
You're alone with this one
And they're angry
Well it won't do no good
Together, with your problems, doll
Live alone, willingly (yeah)

Wishin' that someone would film the way I'm lookin' at you
Wishin' that someone would film the way I'm lookin' at you
Wishin' that someone would film the way I'm lookin' at you
Film the way I'm lookin' at you
