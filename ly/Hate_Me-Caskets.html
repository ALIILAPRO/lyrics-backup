		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say you wanted this to break me
But I just love it when you hate me

Let’s run it again
‘cause when we were golden
And the sparks would fire bright
We’d light up the night
And drift through the morning
Where I’d hold you tight

With beating hearts
They won’t stop

When a cold heart burns
There’s no way I’ll escape the fire
When a cold heart burns
There’s no way I’ll evade desire, my desire

Here we go all over again
Come on hit me with the best that you can
Are we insane?
‘cause no one’s really winning this war
But I’d give up everything and I’m sure
That you still feel the same

We are the consequences of our descent
But we pretend that we’re just better as friends
Throw away the ashes or make amends
'til the bitter end

When a cold heart burns
There’s no way I’ll escape the fire
When a cold heart burns
There’s no way I’ll evade desire, my desire

‘cause I just love it when you
Love it when you, hate on me
Love it when you, hate on me

With beating hearts that won’t stop
With beating hearts we’ll never replace
With beating hearts that won’t stop


We are the consequences of our loves end
We tried to mend, then made it happen again
We're the consequences of our loves end
We lost what we had so long ago,
To carry on it's so callous of us both if we stay
We’re just wasting away

So hate, hate on me
Just hate, hate on me
