		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Petal on the vine, too young to drink wine
Just five years a bleeder
Student and a teacher
Far from innocent, what the fuck's consent?
Numbers told you not to
But that didn't stop you

Finally twenty-nine
Funny, just like you were at the time
Thought it was a teenage dream
Just a fantasy
But was it yours or was it mine?
Seventeen, twenty-nine
Whoa, oh
Seventeen, twenty-nine

Had me in your grip, went beautifully with 
All my daddy issues and this shit continues
I see you're quite the collector
Yeah, you're twelve years her elder
Maybe now it doesn't matter
But I know fucking better
Now I know fucking better 'cause I'm

Finally twenty-nine
Funny, just like you were at the time
Thought it was a teenage dream
Just a fantasy
But was it yours or was it mine?
Seventeen, twenty-nine
Whoa, (whoa) oh
Seventeen, twenty-nine
Whoa, (oh) oh
Seventeen, twenty-nine

Finally twenty-nine
Seventeen would never cross my mind
Thought it was a teenage dream, a fantasy
But it was yours, it wasn't mine
Seventeen, twenty-nine
Whoa, oh
