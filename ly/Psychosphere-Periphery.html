		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Silence is bringing on the heart attack
Pushing and pulling, going on within my brain says
To lay low (To lay low)
Dead end, the darkness latches on now I am
A product of a mind that wasn't ever mine and now it says
Kill them slow (Kill them slow)
Weighed down, I'm drowning in this stale moment
Renown is yelling at me from above
This is a one-way road
Kill them slow
Long ago I was forced to drink
Now I long for a taste
Of what stains the murder in red
Straight back to the moment of a distant memory
Strip away all the empathetic
Feeling towards a world that's grown
Absent of all my love
Sadistic, sadistic horror (Sadistic horror) (Horror)
Dead end, the darkness latches on now I am
A product of a mind that wasn't ever mine and now it says
Kill them slow (Kill them slow)
Weighed down, I'm drowning in this stale moment
Renown is yelling at me from above
This is a one-way road
Kill them slow
Stop fucking pulling, will you release the grip and let go?!
I've got a life to live and a life to end
I'll hang 'em up, leave a bloody mess all around
Bow my head and calmly walk away 
Kill them slow
