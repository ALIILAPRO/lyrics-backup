		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been all through the country
From L.A. To Kentucky
Met a good girl in Houston, but she knows
That there are bad girls in Paris
No, they wanna get married
And some beautiful ones in Tokyo

Some go to college, some go to model
Some diggin' for that gold
Some flying solo, some gonna stay at home

Ooh, I want 'em all (these girls)
The ones that you bring home to momma (these girls)
And the ones who love all of the drama (these girls)
I swear there's way too many, tryna fall for one
But I can't help it, I just wanna love all 

(These girls) the independent ones with money 
(These girls) the crazy ones that love to party 
(These girls) I swear there's way too many, tryna fall for one
But I can't help it, I just wanna love all

Hollywood girl, tryna be like Rihanna
And I can't choose one I just gotta be honest
Oh, I don't know how to decide
Too many girls on my mind
Too many girls, all be fine

Ooh, I want 'em all (these girls)
The ones that you bring home to momma (these girls)
And the ones who love all of the drama (these girls)
I swear there's way too many, tryna fall for one
But I can't help it, I just wanna love all (these girls)

(These girls) the independent ones with money 
(These girls) the crazy ones that love to party 
(These girls) I swear there's way too many, tryna fall for one
But I can't help it, I just wanna love all

Hollywood girl, tryna be like Rihanna
And I can't choose one I just gotta be honest
Oh, I don't know how to decide
Too many girls on my mind
Too many girls, all be fine

Ooh, I want 'em all
The ones that you bring home to momma
And the ones who love all of the drama
I swear there's way too many, tryna fall for one
But I can't help it, I just wanna love

Ooh, (these girls)
The ones that you bring home to momma (these girls)
And the ones who love all of the drama (these girls)
I swear there's way too many, tryna fall for one
But I can't help it, I just wanna love all (these girls)
The independent ones with money (these girls)
The crazy ones that love to party (these girls)
I swear there's way too many, tryna fall for one
But I can't help it, I just wanna love all
