		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're not alone
Just say a prayer
You're fighting all the demons in your heart
Give me a call, we'll win the war
I got what you need
Baby listen to me speak yeah
You're not alone
Just say a prayer
You're fighting all the demons in your heart
Give me a call, we'll win the war
I got what you need
Baby listen to me speak yeah
I'm prayin', so faded
It's a shame how we can't change it
That feelin', heart bleedin'
Who decided that you'd be leaving
Nobodies there to guide you home
Keep fighting coz I know you're strong
Why do I feel like I'm on my own
Three hundred friends saved inside my phone, yeah
Minimizing all my stresses
Maximizing all my blessings
Take it like it's fucking taxes
Regular to feel depression
The scars they begin to show
Just know that you're not alone
I got what you need
Baby listen to me speak yeah
You're not alone
Just say a prayer
You're fighting all the demons in your heart
Give me a call, we'll win the war
I got what you need
Baby listen to me speak yeah
You're not alone
Just say a prayer
You're fighting all the demons in your heart
Give me a call, we'll win the war
I got what you need
Baby listen to me speak yeah
Problems weighing heavy see me nervous break
Bitches showing fake love when I prefer the hate
Call my angels, tell the demons and the skeletons
Darkness in my head
Deja Vu we meet again
Poseidon rogue wave insecurities
My self belief on trial double jeopardy
Six feet under lord I'm tryna breathe
Afraid to hurt
So much in this world can make you bleed
Dippin' away in the whip
Thinking today you should quit
Glimmer of light that you miss
A beautiful life to be lived
You don't wanna cry no more
You don't wanna die no more
I got what you need
Baby listen to me speak yeah
You're not alone
Just say a prayer
You're fighting all the demons in your heart
Give me a call, we'll win the war
I got what you need
Baby listen to me speak yeah
You're not alone
Just say a prayer
You're fighting all the demons in your heart
Give me a call, we'll win the war
I got what you need
Baby listen to me speak yeah
