		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have

Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine

If I made you feel second best
Girl, I'm sorry I was blind
'Cause you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me, give me one more chance to keep you satisfied, satisfied

Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time

But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
