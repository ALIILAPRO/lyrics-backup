		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Grraow, grraow, grraow
Grraow, grraow, grraow, grraow, grraow, grraow, grraow
Grraow, grraow, grraow, grraow
Grraow, grraow, grraow, grraow
Grraow, grraow, grraow, grraow
Grraow, grraow, grraow, grraow
Grraow, grraow, grraow, grraow
Grraow, grraow, grraow, grraow

This shit ain't no game (game)
Once you say it's up it ain't no pole holster (nah, no)
I'm walkin' with this Glock behind my drawers
I already told 'em, "Go" 
They comin' it's too late to call 'em off
These diamonds wetter than Niagara
Touch this water, you gon' fall

Grraow, grraow, grraow, grraow
Grraow, grraow, grraow

Gang shit, bust his brain quick, we is dangerous
"Nardo, why you tryna slide? Nigga, you is famous"
What that mean, this trigger finger still wet
Shot his ass a year ago, he say it still hurt
Somebody tell him tell me, "Thank you," he get free Percs
He got shot and he survived, it could've been worse
I don't got no mind, that's what they be tellin' me
We pull up with Ks, ARPs, bunch of letters like a spelling bee
I been hearin' these niggas cappin' through the speakers
We got turkey bags, ain't never really fuck with beefers
All black Trackhawk, I call this one the Jeepers Creepers
You mad I fucked her, blame yourself, you shouldn't've cuffed a eater
Switches gettin' comin', tryna make the AR automatic
Shoot when I sense evil, I don't think, it's just a habit
No matter what I'm clutchin', mine ain't never been the type to pass it

This shit ain't no game (game)
Once you say it's up it ain't no pole holster (nah, no)
I'm walkin' with this Glock behind my drawers
I already told 'em, "Go" 
They comin' it's too late to call 'em off
These diamonds wetter than Niagara
Touch this water, you gon' fall

Fuck with me, it ain't just me, you fuckin' with the killers
Slid on them and you got hit, stop fuckin' with them niggas
We have human conversations, we don't talk to pillows (grraow)
Somebody get that boy a wipe, he a lil' snotty nigga (grraow, grraow)
Rich nigga still be in the hood like a head (grraow, grraow, grraow, grraow)
Rich nigga still be tryna leave a nigga dead (grraow, grraow, grraow, grraow)
Trench nigga went a long time without a bed (grraow, grraow, grraow, grraow)
We drench niggas, call us The Water Park Kids (grraow, grraow, grraow, grraow)
(Call us The Water Park Kids)

Grraow, grraow, grraow
Grraow, grraow, grraow, grraow
Grraow, grraow, grraow, grraow
Grraow, grraow, grraow, grraow
Grraow, grraow, grraow, grraow
Grraow, grraow, grraow, grraow
Grraow, grraow, grraow, grraow
Grraow, grraow, grraow, grraow
Grraow, grraow, grraow, grraow

This shit ain't no game (game)
Once you say it's up it ain't no pole holster (nah, no)
I'm walkin' with this Glock behind my drawers
I already told 'em, "Go" 
They comin' it's too late to call 'em off
These diamonds wetter than Niagara
Touch this water, you gon' fall
