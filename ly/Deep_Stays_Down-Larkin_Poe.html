		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a bullet in the gun
The gun went missing
Suspicion blew up like a shotgun shell
Zipping your lips
Keep the truth in prison
Gonna throw away the key
Like you can't make bail

The cat's in the bag
The bag's in the river
And the river runs deep
And the deep stays down
Better dot your eyes
The lie's getting bigger
Don't lead em to the needle
In the haystack

The deep stays down
The deep stays down
The river runs deep
And the deep stays down

I, I thought I told you
I thought I told you that the deep stays down
I, I thought I told you
The river runs deep and the deep stays down

The trap got sprung
I read it in the paper
The paper got read all over this town
The jury's still hung
Gotta snake oil savior
Who's trying catch a fox in the henhouse now

The deep stays down
The deep stays down
The river runs deep
And the deep stays down

I, I thought I told you
I thought I told you that the deep stays down
I, I thought I told you
The river runs deep and the deep stays down

Pray for rain
It's a bone dry summer
Been sweating like a mother
And the sun just beats
Who they gonna blame
Who's a-gonna pay for every single secret
That the river don't keep
