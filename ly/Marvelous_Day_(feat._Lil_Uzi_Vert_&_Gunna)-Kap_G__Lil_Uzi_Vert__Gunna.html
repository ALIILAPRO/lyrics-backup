		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me the way, oh
Pull out that Wriath
Niggas gon' hate
Marvelous day
Gunna with me, aye, aye

Yeah, young nigga came a long way
Used to be broke every day
Watch when I pull out that Wraith
A lot of these niggas gon' hate
Best to stay out of the way
That put you down in the grave
My water ain't come out a lake
Young nigga fly as a plane
I had a marvelous day
Ain't no baby bottles today
Took a model out and went on a date
Put that dick all in her face
I'ma give me that piece of that cake
I'ma fly to Dubai on a plane
I'ma send my lil' bitch out to Spain
I'ma cover her body with Saint

You say you a shooter, you ain't
I ride around wit' that thing
John Wick with that aim
I'm drinkin' drank for that pain
I'm with Gunna and we rollin'
Uzi got on Rick Owens
All this gas like I grow this
She on a poll like we voted
I just see Cannon pull up in that panamera
Got sauce like marinara
Bitch, I'm Kap G, dinero
All that Gucci apparel
All that Louis apparel
Free J, no free Gerald
Yeah, they ain't never tell, though

Young nigga came in that way
Used to be broke every day
Watch when I pull out that Wraith
A lot of these niggas gon' hate
Best to stay out of the way
That put you down in the grave
My water ain't come out a lake
Young nigga fly as a plane
I had a marvelous day
Ain't no baby bottles today
Took a model out and went on a date
Put that dick all in her face
I'ma give me that piece of that cake
I'ma fly to Dubai on a plane
I'ma send my lil' bitch out to Spain
I'ma cover her body with Saint

Let her drip in Chanel on my main
Nike sign, I'm ahead of the game
My aunty like the smell of cocaine
I'ma pray, she get better with age
Any guy wanna walk on the stage
Had to walk out and wait for a chain
I'ma put some more ice on the ring
I'ma fuck her and love her with rage
I'ma love her and fuck her with rage
Hit it once and pull of in a Range
Hit me once, so I don't know your name
Ruby all in my chain like a stain
Crib got unlimited space
Backyard, it look like vacay
150 'round me dying today
Next she gon' do what I say
Lil' Uzi gon' make it rain
Gunna, he gon' make it rain
Kap, he pull up in a tank
Move in that bit' like Brinks
My new lil' bit', yeah, she Cuban
Give me that neck, we gon' link
YSL, that be the team
All the way 'til I'm grey

Young nigga came a long way
Used to be broke every day
Watch when I pull out that Wraith
A lot of these niggas gon' hate
Best to stay out of the way
That put you down in the grave
My water ain't come out a lake
Young nigga fly as a plane
I had a marvelous day
Ain't no baby bottles today
Took a model out and went on a date
Put that dick all in her face
I'ma give me that piece of that cake
I'ma fly to Dubai on a plane
I'ma send my lil' bitch out to Spain
I'ma cover her body with Saint

Gotta keep me a pint and stay sane
I'ma drip all the way to the bank
Thought I told you, that some of them lame
Yeah, that, Kap G, my nigga, my man
See, that turned up a whole 'nother lane
We gon' count us a check, ease the pain
I said, Kap, we can't play no more games
Chop down your block with the gang
I used to have to ride on a train
Spent twenty on a chain
Pussy boy, why you hang?
I ain't never been a lame
I used to listen to Wayne
You think I ain't peepin' your game
I know you peepin' my flav'
They wanna be in my place

Young nigga came a long way
Used to be broke every day
Watch when I pull out that Wraith
A lot of these niggas gon' hate
Best to stay out of the way
That put you down in the grave
My water ain't come out a lake
Young nigga fly as a plane
I had a marvelous day
Ain't no baby bottles today
Took a model out and went on a date
Put that dick all in her face
I'ma give me that piece of that cake
I'ma fly to Dubai on a plane
I'ma send my lil' bitch out to Spain
I'ma cover her body with Saint
