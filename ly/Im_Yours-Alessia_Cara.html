		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some nerve you have
To break up my lonely
And tell me you want me
How dare you march into my heart
Oh how rude of you
To ruin my miserable
And tell me I'm beautiful
'Cause I wasn't looking for love no
Nobody asked you to get me attached to you
In fact you tricked me
And I wasn't trying to fall in love
But boy you pushed me
So all that I'm asking
Is that you handle me with caution
'Cause I don't give myself often
But I guess I'll try today

'Cause I've had my heart
Broken before
And I promised I would never
Let me hurt anymore
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I'm yours

I'm mad at you
For being so cute
And changing my mood
And altering my rude
What's wrong with you
You make me sick
For being so perfect
What did I do
What can I do, oh
And I wasn't trying
To melt this heart of iron
But the way you hold me
Makes the old me pass away
And I would be lying
If I said I wasn't scared to fall again
But if you promise me you'll catch me
Then it's okay

'Cause I've had my heart
Broken before
And I promised I would never
Let me hurt anymore
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I'm yours

Oh I hate that I
Spend my days just wasting time
Day dreaming 'til I see you again
I'm not used to this
Oh I used to be so used to boys just using me
For you to be you to me
Feels new to me
'Cause I usually cheer for the bad side
Love under a bad sign
So it makes me mad I'm
Falling again
Falling again

But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby I'm yours
Oh baby I'm yours
