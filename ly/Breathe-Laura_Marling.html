		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You came here to tell me something
I already know
The dark before the dawn
Is the darkest I can go
The calm before the storm
Is what leaves me here to breathe
So breathe

Us of constant banging
Throwing fists against the wall
Screaming at the earth for what
It's done to one and all
I came here to tell you something
You already know
Just breathe
Breathe

How cruel I am to you
Cruel things I do
How cruel you were to me
How cruel time can be
I wrote you a book
But I left it out in the rain
Left it there to dry
But it got rained on once again
Us of constant banging
Throwing fists against the wall
Breathe
Breathe

How cruel you are to me
How cruel time can be
How cruel I was to you
How cruel the things I do

When you wake you'll know I'm gone
And where I'm going there's no one
So don't follow me
Whatever you may hear or see
Don't follow me
Whatever you may hear or see

When you wake you'll know I'm gone
And where I'm going there's no one
So don't follow me
Whatever you may hear or see
Don't follow me
Whatever you may hear or see
