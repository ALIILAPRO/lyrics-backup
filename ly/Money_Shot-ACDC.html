		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feel in the rock 'n' roll mood
Gonna make it feel good
Might be a little dangerous
I believe, I believe, you will see, it could be
Contagious

Doctor, what's the antidote?
Lady, try the money shot
Doctor, what's the antidote?
Lady, just try the money shot
Best taken when hot

I got a good prescription
For the state of your condition
You gotta take it three times a day
Or as much, as much as you need
That's my diagnosis

Doctor, what's the antidote?
Lady, try the money shot
Doctor, what's the antidote?
Lady, try the money shot

Try the money shot
Hey

Ooh

Now take this down
Gonna send you on your way
'Cause I believe I solved your case
I'll give you your relief

Doctor, what's the antidote?
Lady, try the money shot
Doctor, what's the antidote?
Lady, try the money shot

We got a good cure
For what ails you
It won't fail you
Try the money shot
Doctor, show me the antidote
I'll try the money shot
I'll try the money shot

Ooh
