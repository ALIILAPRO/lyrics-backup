		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's you again
What do you want from me ?
I am tired, I am so done
I have changed
Now I am different
Can't you see ?
I've blind myself for too long
You look so weak when I am strong
Keep your eyes peeled
Just keep your eyes peeled
Keep your eyes peeled
Just keep your eyes peeled
I have changed
Now I am different
Can't you see ?
I've blind myself for too long
You look so weak when I am strong
