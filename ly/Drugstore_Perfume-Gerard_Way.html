		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She waits at windows
Her dreams don't show in color and she sleeps for now
She just waits around wishing she-

Could leave, single mothers
In parking lots and wear another girl's evening out
This place let you down easy

She gets up to buy a drink
I'd notice why when she walks by
There's something caught in her eye, she says

That she can't change for love
And she explains how long she's waited for
She wanted more

Dead leaves, desperate summers
All-ages clubs and metal shutters to keep you out
While we hang around factories
'Till we meet each other
Two discount lives and heavy numbers to keep you down

If I wait around, maybe she
Might come back to say that I'm
Not sure you know my name, that's fine

But take me with you this time she says
That she can't change for love
And she explains how long she's waited for
She wanted more

Gone today
I might just see you around
It hurts, but I understand if you can't find another
reason not to stay
And while she's walking away she says

That she can't change for love
And she explains how long she's waited for
She wanted more
And as these days go by
Well they can't change how long we've waited for
A love that's more
A love that's more
