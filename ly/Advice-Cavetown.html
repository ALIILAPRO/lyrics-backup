		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I lost all my lunch, I threw it on the ground
I don't wanna talk, don't wanna be around
I know you're tryin' to help
I think that's really nice
But I know myself, I don't need your advice

I've got a hint for you, take it
Are you hungry?
I have my shorts for you to eat, leave me
Alone, I don't owe you
Anything, you're not my friend
You're not my mom

Alone on Sunday night i saw a ton of shit
It made me really mad
You told me not to quit
Said, "This is how it is
You're giving them your life"
But I don't wanna give, I want it for myself
As selfish as it is, I need it for my health
And I have stuff to do for me, nobody else
Nobody else

So please don't talk to me
You don't know anything
I am not your conversation
People will talk but that's not what I want
I can be myself without explanation
