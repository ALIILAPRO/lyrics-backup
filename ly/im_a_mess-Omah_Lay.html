		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It is what it is
(Ohh, oh-oh)
Oh, yeah (Niphkeys)
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah

Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm sad
I don't know what's over me
Sometimes I'm good, sometimes I'm wild
I don't know what's over me

I don't know what's over me
I'm overthinking everything
At time it feel like nobody
Can understand the way I feel
'Cause I'm fucked up totally
I don't know how to keep company
So I've been drinking cognac
I've been drinking too many shots of cognac

One for the belly, another for the broken heart
Three for addiction, four so I don't go back
Looking for somebody who fit watch my shoulders
So, I can never be sober

I can never be so, so, oh, oh
(I can never be so) 

Ohh, yes, I did it
How many million I make for a living
Wear my Louis Vuitton, post for the pic 
Let the camera light hit my teeth, you know
Nobody is better than me
Nobody is better than me
I do it differently
Everybody can see

I don't know what's over me
I'm overthinking everything
At time it feel like nobody
Can understand the way I feel
'Cause I'm fucked up totally
I don't know how to keep company
So I've been drinking cognac
I've been drinking too many shots of cognac

One for the belly, another for the broken heart
Three for addiction, four so I don't go back
Looking for somebody who fit watch my shoulders
So, I can never be sober

(I can never be sober) 
(Niphkeys)
