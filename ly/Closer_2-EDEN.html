		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lord knows we're wrong
Ceilings were floors
That we clipped our lives through
But I'm closer to hope
Now down's become up
I can see the light skew
Hope I can see

But it's alright, I won't be long
Drilla come through and try snatch my phone
Inside-out, Comme des Garçons
No bad blood, I don't hold a grudge
Girls still try but I let it go
Proud of my tears, proud to be alone
Proud of my highs, proud of my lows
And though some of these things
Just out of our control, I

I know you think about me sometimes
I hope he treats you like you always wanted
In times these rushes we feel won't fly by
How can I think ahead you're always on my mind?
How can I think ahead, you're always

Hate feeling like this
Thinking in crises
Feeling so cliché
Ooh
Tried to run from it
Said I'm not above it
I'm from it
Ooh

'Cause you were looking at me back like that
Rushing through the year tryna turn the clock back
I can't always be there
But you know I come back
I been racing
And been in last for so long

But it's alright, I won't be long
Drilla come through and try snatch my phone
Inside-out, Comme des Garçons
No bad blood, don't hold a grudge
Girls still try but I let it go
Proud of my tears, proud to be alone
Proud of my highs, proud of my lows
And though some of these things
Just out of our control, I

(Peace)
I know you think about me sometimes
(That we clipped our lives through)
I hope he treats you like you always wanted
(Closer)
In time these rushes we feel won't fly by
(Seeing the lights)
How can I think ahead you're always on my mind?
(Seeing the lights)
How can I think ahead you're always on my mind?
(If I can see the light)
Every sight
