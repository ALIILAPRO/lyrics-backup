		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You carry the weight much better than I do
Day after day, waitin' for good news
All of our needs, our hopes and our dreams
Are waitin' on an open door
I see a spark of light in the dark
We'll be stronger than before

We gotta love like we've never been hurt
We gotta rise like we've never been burned
And after all of the lessons we've learned
We're gonna make this a beautiful world
A beautiful world
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Gonna make this a beautiful world
Oh-oh, oh-oh
A beautiful world

I'll carry the weight, no mountain is too high
It's never too late, there's always a sunrise
All of our needs, our hope and our dreams
Are waiting on an open door
I see a spark of light in the dark
We'll be wiser than before

We gotta love like we've never been hurt
We gotta rise like we've never been burned
And after all of the lessons we've learned
We're gonna make this a beautiful world
A beautiful world 
Oh-oh, oh-oh
We're gonna make this a beautiful world
Oh-oh, oh-oh
A beautiful world

When we come together
Everything's gonna be much better
When we come together

We gotta love like we've never been hurt
Rise like we've never been burned
And after all of the lessons we've learned
We're gonna make this
Gonna make this a beautiful world
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Gonna make this a beautiful world
Oh-oh, oh-oh (oh) (oh-oh)
Make this a beautiful world
When we come together (when we come together) (oh-oh, oh-oh)
We're gonna make this a beautiful world
When we come together (oh-oh, oh-oh)
We're gonna make this a beautiful world
When we come together (oh-oh, oh-oh)
We're gonna make this a beautiful world
