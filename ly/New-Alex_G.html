		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bobby drives all alone to the park by the Creek
And he meets up with Jan
Passed the bill
Shakes her hand
Jan got home after ten woke her dad went to bed
Woke up cold
In the night
From a voice
In her head

Who are you
I guess it's what we do
To be new
What a scheme
I guess that's what she means
In your dreams

Bobby wakes up at noon locks himself in his room
Used a belt
On his back
Hit it hard
Made it crack
He got high later on picks up Jan drives her home
She don't talk
But she knows
Why the boy's
Fever grows

Who are you
I guess that's what we do
To be new
What a scheme
I guess that's what she means
In your dreams
