		  This is the story of a streetlife
Story of a streetlife 
Story of a streetlife 
Story of a streetlife 

If you not understand my ghetto, you should have never come around
It seems like every single day, there's something bringing me down
Now there's a war in the streets, the guns blaze all the time
If you're a real bad man, then you'll never back down

If you not understand my ghetto, you should have never come around
It seems like every single day, there's something bringing me down
Now there's a war in the streets, the guns blaze all the time
If you're a real bad man, then you'll never back down

If you not understand my ghetto, you should have never come around
