		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here we are
Just floating with the moon and stars
Just waiting for something, a little spark
I don't know what it is but when it comes
I'll know it when it comes, mmh
I'll know it when it comes

Some run wild
Trying to find a calling
Some give up too soon
For fear of falling
Others never try
And don't know what they're missing
In the end
We arrive at the beginning

Here we are
Just floating with the moon and stars
Waiting for something, a little spark
I don't know what it is but when it comes
I'll know it when it comes
And in the dark
Just floating with the moon and stars
Just waiting for something, a little spark
I don't know what it is but when it comes
I'll know it when it comes
I'll know it when it comes

Lost my head
In the heat of the summer
The sun burned red
In the Heavens above us
Turned to the sky
Looking for answers
And I saw no reply
Only celestial dancers

Spinning in orbit
We're spinning in orbit
We're spinning in orbit
Spinning in orbit
We're spinning in orbit
We're spinning in orbit
We're spinning in orbit
Spinning in orbit

Here we are
Just floating with the moon and stars
Waiting for something, a little spark
I don't know what it is but when it comes
I'll know it when it comes
And in the dark
Just floating with the moon and stars
Waiting for something, a little spark
I don't know what it is but when it comes
I'll know it when it comes
I'll know it when it comes

Spinning in orbit
Spinning in orbit
We're spinning in orbit
We're spinning in orbit
We're spinning in orbit
We're spinning in orbit
We're spinning in orbit
We're spinning in orbit
Spinning in orbit
