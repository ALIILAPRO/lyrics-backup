		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In gold party dresses and half baked confessions
Fleeting obsessions on anything new
Millions of questions about my existence
And if I'm even cool

By now I thought that I'd checked off some boxes
Keep kickin' my bucket list right down the street
They say I'm too young to think about love
But without it I feel incomplete

Another year full of static then June feels so tragic
I'll lie here, right here
Less melodramatic, more anticlimactic
I'm all out of tears
What a bittersweet sixteen

When I was younger
I used to wonder if I'd have a boyfriend
And we'd love each other
He'd tell me I'm pretty and make me feel nice
But I just feel shitty, surprise

My childhood's wasting and I'm scared to face it
I'm halfway to halfway to a mid-life crisis
And I can't even drive yet
Maybe I should get my license
Maybe I should get this life thing figured out

Another year full of static then June feels so tragic
I'll lie here, right here
Less melodramatic, more anticlimactic
I'm all out of tears
What a bittersweet six-

Time of my life, is it downhill from here?
I refuse to believe they're the best of my years
My mind makes up stories but they sure don't help
'Cause the me in my head is just worse than myself
Like a candle burning out

Another year full of static then June feels so tragic
I'll lie here, right here
Less melodramatic, more anticlimactic
I'm all out of tears
What a bittersweet sixteen
