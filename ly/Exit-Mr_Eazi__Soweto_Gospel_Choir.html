		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's Kel P Vibes, yeah yeah
I never had to count my blessings but these days I do
Originally I no dey find trouble but these days I do (yea)
'Cause it's a lonely road a lonely road
Never suffer lonely
I no dey find trouble but these days I do

Oh dem a pre me voodoo
But I thank Jehovah for the journey
Oh joy comes in the morning
I let bad mind close and they were storing
I got so many secrets that I pray don't come out
Paranoid cause I've seen things go bad
When my family turns to demons around me (yea yea)

I thank you Lord for everything
Everything you've done for me
And I give you praise oh Majesty
And I say thank you

I thank you Lord, for everything
Everything you've done for me
And I give you praise oh Majesty
And I say thank you

Thank you God for keeping things smoothly (hem ye ahee)
And the blessings wey you shoot daily (hem ye ahee)
I no go lie I am feeling differently (hem ye ahee)
Na why I still dey move undercover

Thank you God for keeping things smoothly (hem ye ahee)
And the blessings wey you shoot daily (hem ye ahee)
I no go lie I am feeling differently (hem ye ahee)
Na why I still dey move (o)

Dem a pre me voodoo (hem ye ahee)
But I thank Jehovah for the journey (hem ye ahee)
Oh joy comes in the morning (hem ye ahee)
I let bad mind close and they were storing (hem ye ahee)
I got so many secrets that I pray don't come out (hem ye ahee)
Paranoid cause I've seen things go bad (hem ye ahee)
When my family turns to demons around me (yea yea)

Ngiyabonga ngoba ungewele ukuphila (amen)
Ngiyabonga Uyinzwele zwele (amen)

Ngiyabonga ngoba ungewele ukuphila (amen)
Ngiyabonga Uyinzwele

I raise my hands unto you Lord (helele helele ahelele)
Oh joy comes in the morning (helele helele ahelele)
You alone Lord makes me smile

I raise my hands unto you Lord (helele helele ahelele)
Oh joy comes in the morning (helele helele ahelele)
You alone Lord makes me smile
