		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As a young boy chasing dragons
With your wooden sword so mighty
You're St. George or you're David and you always killed the beast
Times change very quickly and you had to grow up early
A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet

You'll die as you lived
In a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man and his honor

The smell of resined leather, the steely iron mask
As you cut and thrust and parried at the fencing master's call
He taught you all he ever knew, to fear no mortal man
And now you'll wreak your vengeance in the screams of evil man

You'll die as you lived
In a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man and his honor

You'll die as you lived
In a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man and his honor

You'll die as you lived
In a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man and his honor
