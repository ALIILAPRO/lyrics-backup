		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Brainstorm, take me away from the norm
I got to tell you something
This phenomenon, I had to put it in a song
And it goes like

Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
Whoa, shades of gold display naturally

You want to know what brings me here, oh
You glide through my head, blind to fear
And I know why

Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
Whoa, shades of gold display naturally

Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
Whoa, shades of gold display naturally

You live too far away
Your voice rings like a bell anyway
Don't give up your independence
Unless it feels so right
Nothing good comes easily
Sometimes you've got to fight

Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
Whoa, shades of gold display naturally

You launched a thousand ships in my heart, so easy
Still it's fine from afar
And you know that

Whoa
Brainstorm, take me away from the norm
Whoa
I got to tell you something
