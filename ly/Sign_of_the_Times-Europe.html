		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the word is out from the other side
She turns around
Cause day and night she's waited patiently
Now a different kind of world out there
Is to be found
It's over not for everyone to see
This is the way it's meant to be

It's the way that we make things right
It's the way that we hold on tight
I know, it's the sigh of the times
It's the way that we make things turn
It's the way that we live and learn
I know, it's the sigh of the times

It wakes him up, he turns around
And now he's gone
He's been waitin' for this moment desperately
Now the time is right, he's turnin' back
He's going home
Yeah it's over now for everyone to see
This is the way it's meant to be

It's the way that we make things right...

And every time it's on my mind
I feel so insecure
It worries me to end up here alone
But every time I realize I need her more and more
I'd never make it on my own

It's the way that we make things right...
