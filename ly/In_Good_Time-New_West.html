		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Losing your mine just trying to find yourself
You sit and wait wondering to yourself
Maybe this train could take me out of my own head
Would anybody hear you scream for help
But all you need is a hand to make the best of everything
Cause nine times out of ten you'll find life won't go as planned
Just hold on to love 
And all of the above will soon make sense
And you'll be fine
All in good time

You break your back and fake a laugh to make ends meet
You bite your tongue like nothing's wrong but I can see
This two star town has brought you down onto your knees
Made you believe that all your dreams were out of reach

But all you need is a hand to make the best of everything
Cause nine times out of ten you'll find life won't go as planned
Just hold on to love and all of the above will soon make sense
And you'll be fine
All in good time

You say you wanna car so baby lets get it
Imma hit the clutch with a full tank ready
And everywhere we go we'll be making love
Now I don't need much
Just tell me that you love me
I know right now that I ain't made of money
But everything I make Imma give to you

You say you wanna car so baby lets get it
Imma hit the clutch with a full tank ready
And everywhere we go we'll be making love
Now I don't need much
Just tell me that you love me
I know right now that I ain't made of money
But everything I make Imma give to you
 
And you'll be fine
All in good time
