		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I've been in denial
Lately it's been hard to breathe
People tell me that they love me
Nothing they say I believe
Maybe I've been burnt out
Maybe I should slow down
I tried to let go
It feels like I'm alone
I hold onto myself now
I could lay outside for hours
At least I'm getting sleep
I'm not where I wanna be but thank God I'm not where I used to be
I've been so close to dying
but I'm still in one piece
I'm not where I wanna be but thank God I'm not where I used to be
Feels like I move in slow motion
Some things look grey in my eyes
At least I feel some emotion
I only feel numb sometimes
Maybe I've been burnt out
I tried so hard to slow down
Can't fix it on my own
Man I feel so alone
I could really use a hug now
I could lay outside for hours
At least I'm getting sleep
I'm not where I wanna be but thank God I'm not where I used to be
I've been so close to dying
but I'm still in one piece
I'm not where I wanna be but thank God I'm not where I used to be
Time likes testing me
But I keep protesting
I'm just tryna get some space
Let it fly over my head
If I'm pulled under the sea
If I get struck by lightning
At least I can say that I know that I tried my best
I know I tried my best
I scroll online for hours
Some nights I hardly sleep
I'm not where I wanna be but thank God I'm not where I used to be
I'm not afraid of crying
I'm barely in one piece
I'm not where I wanna be but thank God I'm not where I used to be
