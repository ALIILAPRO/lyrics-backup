		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been through the desert and I've been across the sea
I've been walking through the mountains and wandered through the trees for her

I have been trying to find her want to give what I got
She lit a fire, but now she's in my every thought

Where, could that girl have gone
Where, I've wandered far
Where, could that girl have gone
She left no trail but I cannot fail
I will find her

She lit a fire, but now she's in my every thought
She lit a fire, but now she's in my every thought

Where, could that girl have gone
Where, I've wandered far
Where, could that girl have gone
She left no trace but I know her face
I will find her

When last I saw her she was dancing all alone
Perhaps my chance was then, I'll never know
I'll search the world until there's no place left to go
And if she leaves it, I will follow
Yes, I will follow

She lit a fire, but now she's in my every thought
She lit a fire, but now she's in my every thought

I've been through the desert and I've been across the sea
I've been walking through the mountains and wandered through the trees for her

I have been trying to find her want to give what I got
She lit a fire, but now she's in my every thought
