		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Still one thing puzzles me inside
Why can't I live a normal life?
No matter how hard I try to change myself
I know this much is true

How can I bring peace to my heart?
I think about it every day
I don't want to pretend to be good anymore
No longer

I've been through a lot my whole life
I feel like there's no second chance
Whenever I'm frustrated
I recall the day

They taught me how to live again
I'll never fall into despair
I just want to live a normal life
From now on 'til the end

I've been through a lot my whole life
I felt like there was no more chance
Whenever I'm frustrated
I recall the day

They taught me how to live again
I'll never fall into despair
I just want to live a normal life
From now on 'til the end, oh
From now on 'til the end
