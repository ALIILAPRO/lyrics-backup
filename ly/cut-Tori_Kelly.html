		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love in suspension
When you put up your guard
But I know I can make you believe
I'm the exception
Hit the drum on your heart
Baby, we caught a rhythm

And it go like, "Da dum, da dum, da"
Go like, "Da dum, da dum, da"
Make you feel some type of way
Make you feel some type of way (bounce, bounce)
It go like, "Da dum, da dum, da"
Go like, "Da dum, da dum, da"
You can get that yesterday
You can get that soon as yesterday

You don't want a cut if it's not with me
You ain't get this love from nobody else
I'm the only one you know who take control
I know you know
You don't want a cut if it's not with me
Not me
You ain't get this love from somebody else
I'm the only one you know who take control
I know you know

That I'm free fallin'
When you look in my eyes
And the goosebumps they letting me know
You got me callin'
Hit the drum, blow my mind
Baby, we caught a rhythm

And it go like, "Da dum, da dum, da"
Go like, "Da dum, da dum, da"
Make you feel some type of way
Make you feel some type of way
It go like, "Da dum, da dum, da"
Go like, "Da dum, da dum, da"
You can get that yesterday
You can get that soon as yesterday

You don't want a cut if it's not with me
Not with me
You ain't get this love from nobody else
I'm the only one you know who take control
I know you know
You don't want a cut if it's not with me
Not with me
You ain't get this love from somebody else
I'm the only one you know who take control
I know you know

It go like, "Da dum, da dum, da"
Go like, "Da dum, da dum, da"
Make you feel some type of way
Make you feel some type of way, yeah
It go like, "Da dum, da dum, da"
It go like, "Da dum, da dum, da"
Whoa, yeah, yeah

You don't want a cut if it's not with me
You ain't get this love from nobody else
I'm the only one you know who take control
Whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah

You don't want a cut if it's not with me
Not with me
You ain't get this love from nobody else
I'm the only one you know who take control
I know you know (ooh, I know you know)
You don't want a cut if it's not with me
Not with me
You ain't get this love from somebody else
I'm the only one you know who take control
I know you know

It go like, "Da dum, da dum, da"
Go like, "Da dum, da dum, da"
