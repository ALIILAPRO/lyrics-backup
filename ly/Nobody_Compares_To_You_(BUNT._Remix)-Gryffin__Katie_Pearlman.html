		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thought I saw you at a bar last night
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
Hid in the bathroom, I just couldn't stay high
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah

'Cause I took so much time to reset my life
But in just one look, I'm back
Forget that I could have any one I like
But now all I remember is what we had

Nobody, nobody, nobody compares to you
Somebody, somebody please help me get over you
'Cause it feels like I've been wasting my time
In all the wrong places, on all the wrong faces
Nobody compares to you
Nobody compares to you
Nobody compares to you

Nobody compares to you
Nobody compares to you

What should I do?
Maybe I'll move away
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
Start somewhere new, I'll let you have L.A
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah

'Cause I took so much time to reset my life
But in just one look, I'm back
Forget that I could have any one I like
But now all I remember is what we had

Nobody, nobody, nobody compares to you
Somebody, somebody please help me get over you
'Cause it feels like I've been wasting my time
In all the wrong places, on all the wrong faces
Nobody compares to you
Nobody compares to you
Nobody compares to you

Nobody compares to you
(Nobody, nobody, nobody) nobody compares to you
To you

You're once in a lifetime
Better than New Year's at midnight
Wanna grab on and hold tight
And I won't let go
I hope you can hear this
'Cause it's your face that I miss
Your lips I wanna kiss

Nobody, nobody, nobody compares to you
Somebody, somebody please help me get over you
'Cause it feels like I've been wasting my time
In all the wrong places, on all the wrong faces
Nobody compares to you

Nobody compares to you
(Nobody, nobody, nobody) nobody compares to you
