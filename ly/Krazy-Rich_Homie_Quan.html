		<p>
		  Haha
I been hearin' them chatter quick
You know I been hearin' the mumblin'
Tell them niggas speak up though
I bet them niggas can't do what I do
I bet them niggas can't, you know what I'm sayin'
Pop it how I pop it, ayy

Flip flops, I just hit a bitch no condom (woo)
I been servin' white boy, Adam, no jumper (ayy)
Circle full of bosses everybody gettin' money
And we gone get a whole lot more of that this summer (yeah)
Run it up 'til the money counter get done
Bank money got paper cuts on my thumb (swear)
Takin' my little boy to school with a gun (ayy)
Sad that I got to walk around with a gun (ayy)
Everybody ridin' 'round Atlanta with a gun (ayy)
Shawty been sittin' ten months without a bond (ayy)
If you want smoke, nigga, check on your lungs (ayy)
'Cause I ain't never ever gave a fuck about nothin' (fuck nah, nigga)
For shit to get krazy 
You don't want for this shit to get krazy (Rich Homie)
Shit'll get krazy 
Them young niggas ass gon' go krazy (hey)

All my niggas they pure, we don't even walk around sayin', "We real" (uh)
I'm sad that my dawg just died, 'cause somebody gave my boy a fake pill (aw, man)
My young niggas ain't got a job 
but I might hire them boys 'cause they kill ('cause they throw)
Percs don't make me crazy, if I take one Rich Homie on chill
I was in the AMG, doin' one-thirty (skrrt) 
I'on't need seven bullets on me, need thirty (thirty)
Alot of guns clean but a couple of 'em dirty (yeah)
All my young niggas about to start purgin' (yeah)
Shoulder strap on the choppa so it shoot sturdy (grrt)
Young nigga died another unsolved murder (damn)
Had to put a rubber on my dick 'cause she fertile
Cold, havin' chickens way before that nigga Kernel
Blue tip bullets gon' burn ya (grrah)
So stay out my business if the shit don't concern you
The nigga you call big bro used to be a runner (bitch)
Nigga talk slick bitch nigga get confronted (ha)
And I got some thick shit out of Dallas, Texas
Bitch redder than Hi-Tech (double cup)
Gettin' money, this shit a process (yeah)
Still doin' it for the projects (Quan, ayy)

Flip flops, I just hit a bitch no condom (woo)
I been servin' white boy, Adam, no jumper (ayy)
Circle full of bosses everybody gettin' money
And we gone get a whole lot more of that this summer (yeah)
Run it up 'til the money counter get done
Bank money got paper cuts on my thumb (swear)
Takin' my little boy to school with a gun (ayy)
Sad that I got to walk around with a gun (ayy)
Everybody ridin' 'round Atlanta with a gun (ayy)
Shawty been sittin' ten months without a bond (ayy)
If you want smoke, nigga, check on your lungs (ayy)
'Cause I ain't never ever gave a fuck about nothin' (fuck nah, nigga)
For shit to get krazy 
You don't want for this shit to get krazy (Rich Homie)
Shit'll get krazy 
Them young niggas ass gon' go krazy
