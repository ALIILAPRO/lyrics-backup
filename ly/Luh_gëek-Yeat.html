		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ayy, Geo got the bands, huh?)
Big boy Lamb', I'm in the big boy truck (skrr)
I don't know who the fuck you is, bitch, we don't give no fuck
Yeah, we got big boy cash on us, yeah, we got big boy bucks (big boy bucks, yeah)
Bitch gon' pull up on us, I just told her what's up (ha)
You don't make no money (yeah), you ain't go no bodies (let's go)
Made a hundred bands, I forgot about it
Bitch, I'm geekin' on these Percs, I been on auto-pilot
I don't even know nothin' on this earth, bitch, I'm geeked out my body
Yeah, walk inside the building, yeah, walk inside the stu'
Yeah, diamonds all over my teeth, bitch, I don't brush the tooth (yeah)
Went and spent a hundred bands on some fuckin' bracelets, yeah
I don't even know nobody, I'm just geeked up, it's amazing, 'kay
(It's icy, yeah, icy, yeah)

You don't get no fuckin' money (uh) 
You don't get no fuckin' fame (uh)
I don't give a fuck about it (ah) 
All this shit could really change (deep)
I ain't used to have nothin' (nothin') 
Now I pulled up in a plane (uh)
Now my diamonds really rain (they rain) 
Pulled up with a plain jane (yeah)
No, no, we don't do exchange (no, no) 
I don't give a fuck 'bout fame (uh)
I don't got no loose change (uh) 
Hundreds, fifties for the bank (uh)
We don't got time to play (uh)
I don't got time to stay (uh)
We done got to the point where we don't be makin' mistakes, yeah
We done got to the point (the point) 
Where all our pockets lift weights (uh)
All my pockets lift weights (they fat)
All my pockets in the gym everyday
All my pockets gettin' cake (cake)
I just hit 7-Eleven, got the double cup, baby, how it taste?
I'm in the Tonka, parked outside, sittin' outside in the rain (skrr)
All of my diamonds gon' talk to me, who else I got to blame? (Luh Crank)
All of my demons talk to me, who else could I explain? (Luh geek)
All of my demons talk to me, how else could I explain? (Luh geek)
All of my demons talk to me, how else could I explain it? (What's up?)
They told me what they were gon' do, yeah, and then it happened (yeah)
Livin' life on the edge, push it to the deadzone, what happened? (Huh?)
How the fuck my brothers switch up on me? Yeah, why you cappin'?
Boy, you fucked up 'cause I'm rich now, I don't give a fuck what happen (fuck 'em)
All of my brothers really rock with me, we all rich as fuck, we just rappin'
I don't wanna hear 'bout that shit you say 'cause all that shit just cap (you lie)
I'm too high, I don't care what happen (luh geek)

(Ayy, Geo got the bands, huh?)
Big boy Lamb', I'm in the big boy truck (skrr)
I don't know who the fuck you is, bitch, we don't give no fuck
Yeah, we got big boy cash on us, yeah, we got big boy bucks (big boy bucks, yeah)
Bitch gon' pull up on us, I just told her what's up (ha)
You don't make no money (yeah), you ain't go no bodies (let's go)
Made a hundred bands, I forgot about it
Bitch, I'm geekin' on these Percs, I been on auto-pilot
I don't even know nothin' on this earth, bitch, I'm geeked out my body
Yeah, walk inside the building, yeah, walk inside the stu'
Yeah, diamonds all over my teeth, bitch, I don't brush the tooth (yeah)
Went and spent a hundred bands on some fuckin' bracelets, yeah
I don't even know nobody, I'm just geeked up, it's amazing, 'kay
(It's icy, yeah, icy, yeah)
