		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  D to the M to the X, X, X, X, X

D to the M to the X, X, X, X, X

Fuckin' with a nigga like me

This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
Yo, where we at, baby? (Creepin' through the fog)
I know how to get down, know how to fight

D to the M to the X, X, X, X, X

This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
Yo, where we at, baby? (Creepin' through the fog)

Fuckin' with a nigga like me
Five CD's with mad rhymes
Fuckin' with a nigga like me
Five CD's with mad rhymes
Fuckin' with a nigga like me
Man, cats don't know what it's gonna be
Fuckin' with a nigga like me

D to the M to the X, X, X, X, X

D to the M to the X, X, X, X, X
D to the M to the X, X
D to the M to the X, X, X, X, X

D to the M to the X, X, X, X, X

D to the M to the X, X, X, X, X
X, X, X, X, X
X, X, X, to the M
X, X, X, X, X

This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
Yo, where we at, baby? (Creepin' through the fog)
