		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  From the frozen north they came
Fought for founding father’s claim
It was then, their tale, began

Trace their roots from 16 strong
By the king where they belong

En tid
Av Krig

Wherever he goes, near or far, they are close
For the King of Sweden they lay down their lives

For the Swedish crown they stand
By the king, at his command
500 years for the fatherland
Marching across the belt
Crushing blow at Narva dealt
Livgardet our Royal Guard

Sworn protectors of the throne
Royal doctrine set in stone
For the crown, you shall give your life

By traditions from the past
Swedish soldiers stand steadfast

I frid
Och i strid

And if one should fall, yet another, heeds the call
For king and for country they lay down their lives

För Sverige i tiden
Dit konungen går
De gör vad som synes omöjligt, vad än framtiden spår

Still for the crown they stand
By the king, at his command
500 years for the fatherland
Marching across the belt
Crushing blow at Narva dealt
Livgardet our Royal Guard
