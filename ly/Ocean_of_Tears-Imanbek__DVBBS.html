		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So many lovers ago
You're still my number one
People always tell me time will heal
But they don't know what we had was just like a dream
Little did we know it was true love

Wish I knew, wish I knew what I had from the start
Wish I knew, wish I knew

Sometimes I regret that I even met you
That would've saved me an ocean of tears
I keep on swimming right into the deep blue
Still kinda warm in this ocean of tears (DVBBS drop)

(Ocean of tears)
(Ocean of tears)

Too many others ago
You're still the one I want
I'm talking to myself or is it you?
Still following around
The whispers in the dark
But when I look around I see no one

Wish I knew, wish I knew what I had from the start
Wish I knew, wish I knew

Sometimes I regret that I even met you
That would've saved me an ocean of tears
I keep on swimming right into the deep blue
Still kinda warm in this ocean of tears

(Ocean of tears)
(Ocean of tears)
(Ocean of tears)
(Ocean of tears)

Sometimes I regret that I even met you
That would've saved me an ocean of tears
I keep on swimming right into the deep blue
Still kinda warm in this ocean of tears (DVBBS drop)

(Ocean of tears)
(Ocean of tears)
(Ocean of tears)
(Ocean of tears)
