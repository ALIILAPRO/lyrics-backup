		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sat down on a street corner
It rained down like you wouldn't believe
Then it hit me, the river
I wasn't swimming, it was carrying me

It's like you blow and I'm as light as a feather
How'd you know how to make it feel like we're in it together?

You don't remember me
I'm nowhere to be seen
Half in, half out again
Feels like I got it wrong
How long have I been gone?
Half in, half out again

All in fighting
We take sides like you wouldn't believe
Unrelated, fabricated
But I can't sing it 'cause you wrote it for me

It's like you blow and I'm as light as a feather
How'd you know how to make it feel like we're in it together?

You don't remember me
I'm nowhere to be seen
Half in, half out again
Feels like I got it wrong
How long have I been gone?
Half in, half out again
You don't remember me
I'm nowhere to be seen
Half in, half out again
Ah, yeah
Ah, ah, ah, ooh-ah, ooh-ah, ah
Hmm

You don't remember me
I'm nowhere to be seen
Half in, half out again
Feels like I got it wrong
How long have I been gone?
Half in, half out again

Half in, half out again
Half in, half out again
Half in, half out again
Half in, half out again
