		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You said you like that nasty love
So let me show you what it's like
This time I ain't passing up
Girl stop with the plotting
And lets get it popping
So are we doing it or not
I can slide by to your spot
Make it wet make it hot
Do you feel that tingle in your spine
That means your all mine
All mine all mine all mine
You know I just want you
Know you want me too
So what should we do
You should make a move
You said you like that nasty love
So let me show you what it's like
This time I ain't passing up
Girl stop with the plotting
And lets get it popping
I can feel the temperature rising
I can feel the heat, want it all on me
Staring deep into my eyes and
It's hard to be discrete, want it all for me
Oh I don't mind
Staying up late, reaching new heights
I might stay the night
Keep it quiet
Oh I don't mind
If you put it down, yeah just right
This something I ain't had
Never wanted it so bad
You said you like that nasty love
So let me show you what it's like
This time I ain't passing up
Girl stop with the plotting
And lets get it popping
