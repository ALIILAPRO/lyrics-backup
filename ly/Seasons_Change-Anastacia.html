		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cradle the weight of your life 
You can survive 
What lies before you 
It's only a matter of time 
Before the night 
Turns into day 
Oh, it should feel incredible, whoa
To know you're not alone, uh 
Just look in my eyes (just look in my eyes) 
Whoa, just look in my eyes 

I said
Happy turns to sad 
Sometimes life gets bad 
Things get rearranged 
Nothing stays the same 
It just never ends 
Here we go again 
One thing 
Still remains, uh 
Seasons seasons change 

C'mon yeah seasons change 
C'mon yeah seasons change 
C'mon yeah seasons change 

Are you scared of today? 
Running away 
I can see through you 
Whoa
It feels like an eternal haze 
But it's only a faze 
It's all in your mind 
Oh, when you feel invisible, uh 
Just know you're not alone 
(C'mon, c'mon) 
Just look in my eyes 
(Look in my eyes, huh, look in my eyes) 
Just look in my eyes 
Just look in my eyes 

I said
Happy turns to sad 
Sometimes life gets bad 
Things get rearranged 
Nothing stays the same 
It just never ends 
Here we go again 
One thing 
Still remains, uh 
Seasons seasons change 

You can feel the air start to change 
When you're walkin' out in the rain 
And the colors inside your brain start fading 
Til the winter is washed away 
And nothing really feels the same 
When sunlight's in your eyes 
You feel alive 

What I really want
What I really want
What I really want
What I really want
I said, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Yeah! 

I said
Happy turns to sad 
Sometimes life gets bad 
Things get rearranged 
Nothing stays the same 
It just never ends 
Here we go again 
One thing 
Still remains, uh 
Seasons seasons change 

I said
Happy turns to sad 
Sometimes life gets bad 
Things get rearranged 
Nothing stays the same 
It just never ends 
Here we go again 
One thing 
Still remains, uh 
Seasons seasons change 

C'mon, c'mon yeah seasons change 
C'mon, c'mon yeah seasons change 

I said
Happy turns to sad 
Sometimes life gets bad 
Things get rearranged 
Nothing stays the same 
It just never ends 
Here we go again 
One thing 
Still remains, uh 
Seasons seasons change 

(Yeah, c'mon) 
Woo
