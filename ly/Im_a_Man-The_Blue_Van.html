		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come on, baby, come on, darling
Feel my love come onto you boiling
Come on, baby, come on, lover
It's your kindness that makes me suffer

Understand I'm a man
I'm a man, I'm a man

Whoo, I'm a man so best rollover
Coming through, acting up like a young Jung Hov-a
Don't you know-a
Lady love, she's so fine since she's bound to skool you

Might even fool ya, I made ya lose-a
Beating young buck with the blues yeah
Sweet things can make you suffer
One thing though

I ain't no brother, just rough-a, I ought to bounce man
Caught a ride with the Blue Van
That's what up, now I got something to prove
'Cause a man got to do what he got to

Come on, baby, come on, darling
Feel my love come onto you boiling
Come on, baby, come on, lover
It's your kindness that makes me suffer

Understand I'm a man
I'm a man, I'm a man

Come on, baby, come on, darling
Feel my love come onto you boiling
Come on, baby, come on, lover
It's your kindness that makes me suffer

Understand I'm a man
I'm a man, I'm a man
