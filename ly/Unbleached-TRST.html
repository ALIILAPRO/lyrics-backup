		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Wretched boy
Wretched find
This is not the load
Let it sing
Let it stain
Something takes ahold
Later spark
Down below
Fills me up with war

He's still my hon
Spoon feeding my fun
You squirmed, I saw
Unbleached, unscarred

Let us come
Let us scream
Ready to get thin
Let us spark
Down below
Fills me up with war

And you come, you come

He's still my hon
Spoon feeding my fun
You squirmed, I saw
Unbleached, unscarred

He's still my hon
Spoon feeding my fun
You squirmed, I saw
Unbleached, unscarred

He's still my hon (why are you so lonely, hon?)
Spoon feeding my fun (why you still so lonely?)
You squirmed, I saw (never been so lonely)
Unbleached, unscarred

Unbleached, unscarred
Unbleached, unscarred
