		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's that city that I miss
I know that isn't it
It's you on midnight trains
Where I fell asleep again in your arms
I'm missing them
All your harm
I'm listening
What I'd do to get it back
I would lay down on those tracks

Central Park never felt so dark
All the lights went off when you left my heart
And the West Side never made me cry so heavy
All these streets feel empty knowing you can't see them
And Montauk is now just a montage of that beach we drove to and talked til our lungs hurt
And Long Island is just a long whirlwind of when we slept in your car til the morning

It's that city that I miss
I know that isn't it
It's you on midnight trains
Where I fell asleep again in your arms
I'm missing them
All your harm
I'm listening
What I'd do to get it back
I would lay down on those tracks

This grass has never felt more fake
That city's one mistake
I stay across the globe just to forget your face
I won't ever replace things you taught me
I'll stay loyal to what you said
Keep going when I'm dead

It's that city that I miss
I know that isn't it
It's you on midnight trains
Where I fell asleep again in your arms
I'm missing them
All your harm
I'm listening
What I'd do to get it back
I would lay down on those tracks

Central Park never felt so dark
All the lights went off when you left my heart
