		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been waiting for you
To come around and tell me the truth
'Bout everything that you're going through
My girl you've got nothing to lose

Cold nights and the Sunday mornings
On your way and out of the grey

I've got time, I've got love
Got confidence you'll rise above
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl

Crowded town or silent bed
Pick a place to rest your head
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl

I've been dreaming 'bout us
Working hard and saving it up
We'll go and see the man on the moon
My girl we've got nothing to lose

Cold nights and the Sunday mornings
On your way and out of the grey

I've got time, I've got love
Got confidence you'll rise above
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl

Crowded town or silent bed
Pick a place to rest your head and
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl

My girl, my girl
It takes one hot second to turn it around
It takes one hot second to turn it around

I've got time, I've got love
Got confidence you'll rise above
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl

Crowded town or silent bed
Pick a place to rest your head and
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl

I've got time, I've got love
Got confidence you'll rise above
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl

Crowded town or silent bed
Pick a place to rest your head and
Give me a minute to hold my girl
Give me a minute to hold my girl
