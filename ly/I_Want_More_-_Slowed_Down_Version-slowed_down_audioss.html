		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Home grounds
Feels like the weight has been lifted away
But if she leaves me there, I won't run
Please pass it on, carry me down

All you need to know is I want more, more
Looking for more
I want more, more
'Cause I want more

So light
Hold back the night, wait 'til it's right
But then you fold your hand into mine
Watch as the waves, fall back into place
So don't you leave me there wanting more

More, like before, more
I want more, more
'Cause I want more, ooh

Turn back, leave all you had
Forgive, I'll forget
'Cause what we need is what we once had
Time won't stand still
Just say you will
'Cause I need you there and now

If you leap, I'll come falling too
Running deep 'til that rivers through
I don't mind what you have to do
'Cause I won't think less, less of you

Yes, I want more, more
Looking for more
I want more, more
'Cause I want more

Old grounds
Feels like the weight has been lifted away
So don't you leave me there wanting more
