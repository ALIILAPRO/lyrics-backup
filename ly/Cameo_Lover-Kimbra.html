		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is nonstop baby
You've got me going crazy
You're heavier than I knew
But I don't want no other
You're my cameo love
Only here for a moment or two
You stay inside that bubble
With all of your trouble
In your black hole
You turn from the skies
You dance with your demise
I'll be here when you come home

We've all gotta break down
Let me come and break down, there with you

'Cause everyday's like talking in your sleep
Love is like a silhouette in dreams
Open up your heart, open up your heart
Open up your heart and let me pull you out
Everyday's like talking in your sleep
Love is like a silhouette in dreams
Open up your heart, open up your heart
Open up your heart and let me pull you out of here

I've got high hopes baby
But all you do is take me down to depths that I never knew
You've got two arms baby
They're all tangled in ladies of the black skies posing blue
Let go of your mother
And turn to your brother
Not a long gone lover's noose
Sometimes baby the hardest part of breaking
Is leaving pieces behind you

Oh we've all gotta get by
Let me come and hold you high, with you

'Cause everyday's like talking in your sleep
Love is like a silhouette in dreams
Open up your heart, open up your heart
Open up your heart and let me pull you out
Everyday's like talking in your sleep
Love is like a silhouette in dreams
Open up your heart, open up your heart
Open up your heart and let me pull you out of here

Open up your heart to me
The sun won't shine if you're not looking
Baby love is all that you need

When everyday's like talking in your sleep
Love is like a silhouette in dreams
Open up your heart, open, open, open

Everyday's like talking in your sleep
Love is like a silhouette in dreams
Open up your heart, open up your heart
Open up your heart and let me pull you out

Open up your heart, open up your heart
Open up your heart, open up your heart
Open up your heart, open up your heart
