		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put money in my hand 
And I will do the things you want me to

Vanity overriding wisdom
Usually common sense
Should I delete it? You said you'd read it
You promised you would never ruin it with sequels
I wait for you on and on

Beyond all ideas of right and wrong, there is a field
I will be meeting you there
Beyond all ideas of right and wrong, there is a field
I will be meeting you there
Beyond all ideas of right and wrong, there is a

The moon's a skull, I think it's grinnin'
The room is full of people now, I think it's spinnin'
Wanted you, didn't ask for nothing
Wait for you on and on
And I don't need your tie
I don't need to, tired of saying it
We don't need more talk
Don't empty out your canteen on the desert floor
Ah
It's all my fault

And I never wanna spell it out
I just wanna say that it is all my fault
I could never spit it out
I don't wanna fix your tie
Never wanna say we're sad
Thankful that we got some chance
I know you won't get back your time
I wish that you could take it back

Beyond all ideas of right and wrong, there is a field
I will be meeting you there
Beyond all ideas of right and wrong, there is a field
I will be meeting you there
Beyond all ideas of right and wrong, there is a field
I will be meeting you there

He wanted it more than me, I suppose
I was in a rush to wait in a line
Now I hear echoes of my old self
This is not the way to be
All at once
I lost my way

Is it not true, the things that we did?
Come here at once and look what they did
Come here, shut down and tune in tonight
Learn the words that they teach you without you realizing it
Come here, sit down and watch some TV

Mine, all mine, wait your turn
Cross my cross, slice your hand
Not your son, not your friend
Not your enemy
I rely on, on the little things
To get me by
Conscience says, "I'm okay"
You don't hear what they say
"He's not my son, search his home"
Off to war
It's time to go hide inside

Soft skin, weak chin
Just walk me through it, tell me what to do, I'll do it
Hurry, hurry, that's my baby
Oh, do what you can
All the time, he waits for me
And now we talk from time to time
Hits you on the head when nobody's there
Then he says, "Come here, could you fix my tie?"
I know it's not to be
To be is not the way to be
Show me where to go, don't get angry so quickly
Fuck depression

Beyond all ideas of right and wrong, there is a field
I will be meeting you there
Beyond all ideas of right and wrong, there is a field
I will be meeting you there
Beyond all ideas of right and wrong, there is a field
I will be meeting you there

Understanding is more important than love is
If not money will always trump justice
All is lost
I'll find my way
I say to be is not to be
To be is not the way to be
