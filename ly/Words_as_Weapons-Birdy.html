		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel your knife as it goes right in
Cut to my core but I'm not bleeding
All that you say trying to make me small
Well, the bigger you get the harder you fall

You use your words as a weapon dear
But your blades don't hurt when you have no fear

You think that you're deep under my skin
You're trying to keep me suffering

If you use your words as a weapon
Then as a weapon, I'll shed no tears

You have my heart but I lock it up
This burning flame has been burnt enough
My window's cracked they can be replaced
But your arm will tire throwing stones my way

You use your words as a weapon dear
But your blades don't hurt when you have no fear

You think that you're deep under my skin
You're trying to keep me suffering

If you use your words as a weapon
Then as a weapon, I'll shed no tears

I feel your knife as it goes right in

You use your words as a weapon dear
But your blades don't hurt when you have no fear

You think that you're deep under my skin
You're trying to keep me suffering

If you use your words as a weapon
Then as a weapon, I'll shed no tears

I'll shed no tears
I'll shed no tears
