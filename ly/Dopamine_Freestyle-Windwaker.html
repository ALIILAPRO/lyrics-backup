		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yah, I wake up gone with the wind.
I wake up, roll with a bitch with no clothes,
If she fakin', I'm gone with the wind. God damn. 
Are you fuckin' ready? 
Oh, eeny miny mo,
Tag this dude with a left hook blow.
Get it on crazy street.
Run up, run up, get up, set up.
I've been ready, getting setty,
Lost my soul to the Twitter app.
Yuh, I feel like I'm bad.
I feel like I'm out of control.
She sent me a message,
She said I'm her dad, I said that I already know. Finished the dinner, straight back to get in her, She's screaming  I rocked her.
2 weeks, I blocked her.
So crazy. I'm a motherfucker. 
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, getting fucked up.
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, I'mma fuck it up.
I walked in flexin' my new Yeezys, go that leg up.
She saw my shoes then came right through,
Babe, are you down to fuck?' Nah.
I'm not your babe. Nuh. You're not my vibe.
I smell that blood on you  a vampire in disguise, shit. You'll never get to me,
I'm stubborn by design.
I don't want no fun with you,
I see the devil in your eyes. 
Come and throw it back,
With a nymphomaniac.
No hate! You're great, just sayin', Getting tired of the same old plan. Yeah! Yeah!
I want it there, there!
Alright,
Come on over,
Call of Duty, I'm your soldier. Bring some Coke.
Fuck it.
HA! Aye. 
In it to win it,
Feel like a badass.
Roll die.
Kill or be killed,
I drop it down like I know I die.
Feed your soul,
Getting broke,
Getting cold, ahh.
Run up, run up, get up, set up.
I've been ready, getting setty,
Lost my soul to the Twitter app.
Ugh!
In it to win it,
Feel like a badass.
Roll die.
Kill or be killed,
I drop it down like I know I die.
Feed your soul,
Getting broke,
Getting cold, ahh.
Run up, run up, get up, set up.
I've been waiting for someone to hold! 
Take me away. 
War zone.
Ozone.
Pull it up!
Let's go!
Put a bitch up for some racks though, cash flow. Unplugged. 
Phone's dead.
Bed time?
Not yet.
So much left on the internet unread. IG handle. 
Build a castle.
I'm in my zone,
With a bitch on her iPhone. Dopamine shot,
More likes, I'm entitled.
Text, call.
Way more pixels on my desktop. Download. 
I love my life when I get the bands.
Gotta make it worth while, gotta pay my mans. This world's so cold, I'll take what I can. 
ALRIGHT, SHUT THE FUCK UP!
