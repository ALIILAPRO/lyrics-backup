		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm just a girl with the ability to drive a man crazy
Make him call me mama
Make him my new baby
New and improved, hey saying thank you very much
Living legend
You can look but don't touch, cause I'm

Cold as fire, baby, hot as ice
If you've ever been to heaven, this is twice as nice
I'm cold as fire, baby, hot as ice
If you've ever been to heaven, this is twice as nice
Break it down, break it down, break it down
Break it down, break it down, break it down

This ain't no foolishness or fuckery
I'm handling my business
Holler if you hear me
Can I get a witness?
Preacher, preacher
I'm the teacher, you can learn
Watch your fingers, boy, you might get burned
Cause I'm

Cold as fire, baby, hot as ice
If you've ever been to heaven, this is twice as nice
I'm cold as fire, baby, hot as ice
If you've ever been to heaven, this is twice as nice
Break it down, break it down, break it down
Break it down, break it down, break it down

As you can see
Fortunately, I'm cold as fire
(Yeah, I'm cold as fire)
Yeah, make you believe
Make you stop and breathe
I'll take you higher
I'm just too cool
Make it do what it do
I'm hot as ice now
(Yeah, I'm hot as ice now)
Make you feel like heaven twenty four seven
I'm hot as ice now, oh!

Cold as fire, baby, hot as ice
If you've ever been to heaven, this is twice as nice
I'm cold as fire, baby, hot as ice
If you've ever been to heaven, this is twice as nice
Break it down, break it down, break it down
Break it down, break it down, break it down
