		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get ready for thrash attack, there is no turning back
Bring the poser to the stage
He’ll be tortured and thrashed, and hung on a rack
Sense the violence in the air, each other’s blood is what you’ll share
Dripping sweat, thrash ‘til death
Sacrifice to the sound of your flesh we will tear

Cutting through and through
Sharp- like a knife that will take your life
Watch it end in a bloody mess

Hands of thrash are ripping flesh from the bone

Non believers stop and stare, come and join us if you dare
Feel the power, grip it tight
Leave the poser behind for what’s real, for what’s right

Cutting through and through
Sharp- like a knife that will take your life
Watch it end in a bloody mess

Hands of thrash are ripping flesh from the bone

Dive off the stage, add to the plague - no one can stop you
Rip through the crowd, the metal’s so loud
You burst at the seams, we thrive on the screams

Cutting through and through
Sharp- like a knife that will take your life
Watch it end in a bloody mess

Hands of thrash are ripping flesh from the bone
