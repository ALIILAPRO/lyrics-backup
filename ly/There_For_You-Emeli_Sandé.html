		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is this love?
Or just something that feels pretty close?
Are these feelings there shared by us both?
Or am I just wasting my time in vain? (Hmm)

Sure, it hurts
But does that mean that it isn't worth
Tryna fix things and try make it work?
Before we go throwing it all away (hmm)

I put my heart on my wrist, don't wanna bleed no more
Running down the stairs when you're at my door
You can put the blame on me, I swear
Even though it hurts, I'll still be there for you
For you, for you

It's a battlefield
With all these walls, you continue to build
If you mean it then, baby, I will
And just start walking the other way (oh yeah)

Oh, but don't it mean nothing to you?
All these years and all these memories
Can we just take a moment to breathe
Before we start throwing it all away? (Oh ooh)

I put my heart on my wrist, don't wanna bleed no more
Running down the stairs when you're at my door
You can put the blame on me, I swear
Even though it hurts, I'll still be there for you
For you, for you (I'll still be there for you)

I put my heart on my wrist, don't wanna bleed no more
Running down the stairs when you're at my door
You can put the blame on me, I swear
Even though it hurts, I'll still be there for you (even though it hurts)
For you, for you (even though it hurts)

I know that things have been rough
Don't know what happened to us
After it's all said and done (after it's all said and done)
You are still my chosen one

So I know that things have been rough
(I know that things, I know that things)
I don't know what happened to us
(After it's all said and done) but after it's all said and done 
You are still my chosen one
Oh baby, baby

I put my heart on my wrist, don't wanna bleed no more
Running down the stairs when you're at my door (I'm running down the stairs)
You can put the blame on me, I swear
Even though it hurts, I'll still be there for you (even though it hurts)
For you, for you (I'll still be there)

I put my heart on my wrist, don't wanna bleed no more
Running down the stairs when you're at my door (I'm running down the stairs)
You can put the blame on me, I swear
Even though it hurts, I'll still be there for you (even though it hurts)
For you, for you (even though it hurts)

(I'll be there, I'll be there)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Yes, I swear)
