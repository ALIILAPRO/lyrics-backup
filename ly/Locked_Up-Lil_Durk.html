		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't see your face, we talk through cellphone
I salute you a thousand times 'cause you ain't said nothin'
It hurt your heart, your kids keep telling you you a jailbird
You don't complain when you don't get visits 'cause you'll get mail first
You lost your guys, have your sentence and it still hurt
Please don't think about the streets, put your appeal first
Before I ever tell a lie, I give you the real first
Before I ever tell a lie, I give you the real Durk, yeah, turn up
When you was free, you had them AK
Whoever think that'd you be passing out a state tray?
And the squad was mad at Rio 'cause he ain't take 8
Twenty-three years, he surviving off of JPay
And you ain't gotta send 'em money 'cause they stay straight
Boona gotta do one more year, I know he can't wait
They steady throwing Law in the hole 'cause he got a gang case
And I be steady taking drugs to keep my pain away
I done did so much time for my gun case
Look in the mirror, all I see is my son's face
And my daughter's and my mom face
The state came with a plea, get out of my face
You my friend, not my family, it's a difference
I know a killer who turned the city up, he snitchin'
I know you did so why you tellin' me you didn't?
But I know another killer who turned up as a witness
Would say they name but I know that ain't none of my business
You ain't tell on the gang so you say that shit ain't snitchin'
Tryna throw up my gang, county scratch it out the picture
Gave the police some guns so they can lighten up they sentence, yeah
Y'all daddy love y'all, you gon' hear them talkin' shit about me
I'm from Chicago, if you died then we didn't forget about you
Fuck with the other side, not me, you can't forget about it
I witnessed a war inside my city, they kill anybody
I know a nigga who ain't did it, but he claimed a body
Niggas got robbed from out of town who just came to party
And why you decide to play with me? My shorties insane about me
Your name ain't shit out here, I can name some people who really about it
I know Coach Ball, he coached with Holland, tried to put him through college
I started rappin', I dropped out of school, I had my first deposit
I wasn't gon' finish anyway, being honest
And I can't do no minimum wage, being honest

Free all my dawgs who locked up
Free all my partners who locked up
Free all my niggas who locked up
Free all my brothers who locked up
Free all them killers who locked up
All them real niggas who locked up
Free them drug dealers who locked up
'Cause of Obama, they changed that one law, they gon' pop up
