		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just put your dukes up, John
Yeah, put your dukes up, John
You were preened and sanitized
Struck dumb by good advice
Your integrity was bruised
Your celebrity a ruse
They pulled the rug from under
Made way for new pretenders

(Change your tune and change your hair)
Put your dukes up, John
(Or you're not going anywhere)
Put your dukes up, John

And be a C-Y-N-I-C
Be a C-Y-N-I-C

The profit margin blinds them
They groomed and ostracized him
His calm makes my blood boil
His calm makes my blood boil

(Change your tune and change your hair)
Put your dukes up, John
Put your dukes up, John
Put your dukes up, John

And be a C-Y-N-I-C
Be a C-Y-N-I-C

(Change your tune and change your hair
Or you're not going anywhere
Change your tune and change your hair
Or you're not going anywhere)
Change your tune and change your hair
Or you're not going anywhere
Change your tune and change your hair
Or you're not going anywhere
(Change your tune and change your hair)

Put your dukes up, John
Put your dukes up, John
Put your dukes up, John
And be a C-Y-N-I-C
And be a C-Y-N-I-C
And be a C-Y-N-I-C
And be a C-Y-N-I-C
