		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I lie when I say that I'm getting emotional (emotional, yeah)
Let me try to express all the things that you want me to
(That you want me to) yeah

One, I feel nothing
Two, I got something
Three, I need you near
You're the only one that never fools around here so (yeah)

You won't ever break

Every time that you fuck with me I wanna let you go (let you go)
But I can't 'cause I don't really know how to let you know
(let you know) yeah

One, I feel nothing
Two, I got something
Three, I need you near
You're the only one that never fools around here so (yeah)

You won't ever break
You won't ever break

(I feel nothing, I feel nothing)
(I feel nothing, I feel nothing)
(I feel nothing, I feel nothing)
(I feel nothing, I feel nothing)

You won't ever break (I feel nothing, I feel nothing)
(I feel nothing, I feel nothing)
You won't ever break (I feel nothing, I feel nothing)
(I feel nothing, I feel nothing)

(I feel nothing, I feel nothing)
(I feel nothing, I feel nothing)
(I feel nothing, I feel nothing)
