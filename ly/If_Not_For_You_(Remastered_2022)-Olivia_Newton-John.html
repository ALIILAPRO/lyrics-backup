		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If not for you, babe I couldn't even find the door
I couldn't even see the floor
I'd be sad and blue, if not for you

If not for you, babe, the night would see me wide awake
The day would surely have to break
It would not be new, if not for you

If not for you, my sky would fall, rain would gather too
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all, I'd be lost, if not for you

If not for you, the winter would hold no spring
Couldn't hear a robin sing
I just wouldn't have a clue, if not for you

If not for you
My sky would fall
Rain would gather too
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all
I'd be lost if not for you

If not for you
The winter would hold no spring
You couldn't hear the robin sing
I just wouldn't have a clue
If not for you
If not for you
