		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been lost before and I'm lost again I guess
But I never lost this feeling or this pounding in my chest 
I have traveled many miles, I don't wanna walk no more
Every road and every highway led me right back to your door

Love me like you used to 
And I'll praise you like I should 
Love me if you choose to 
Though you say that I'm no good 
I dream most every night that I never left you 

Do you love me anymore?
Does my memory remain 
Lord I know I've made mistakes but I am different now, I've changed 
When I open up the door will you know me from the rest?
Will you let me lay beside you? 
Will you grant me my request? 

Love me like you used to 
And I'll praise you like I should 
Love me if you choose to 
Though you say that I'm no good 

I swear this time around I'm gonna stay
When I dream, I only dream of you 
I curse the goddamn day that I went and left you

Love me like you used to
And I'll praise you like I should 
Love me if you choose to 
Though you say that I'm no good

Love me like you used to 
And I'll praise you like I should 
I don't want to lose ya
I would change it if I could 
I can't erase the day that I went and left you
