		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody drink to this lonely night
You played with my heart and you lied
Cause you hate your life
Don't you try to wreck mine

And you don't ever call
Baby thats my life
He didn't ever show
Make a Gatsby cry
We could throw back
And we dance all night
Thought we'd get old
Guess you're not that type

And you got with your girls
Now they hate me why
Used to get it on
When you took my side
We could throw back
And we dance all night
Thought we'd get old
Guess you're not that type

Bad times when you look at it
Yeah on my life
Yeah I hate your type
When you look in my eyes
Yeah it kills my high
I had it coming
Oh
Ohh

Bad times when you look at it
On my life
Yeah I hate your type
When you look in my eyes
Yea it kills my high
I had it coming ohh

Yeah on my life
Wanna kill my high
Its so bright
When you look in my eyes

You don't ever call baby thats your life
Everybody dance to this dreadful night
Cause you hate your life
Don't you break up mine

And you don't ever call
Baby thats my life
She didn't ever show
Make a Gatsby cry
We could throw back
And we dance all night
Thought we'd get old
Guess you're not that type

And you got with your girls
Now they hate me why
Used to get it on
When you took my side
We could throw back
And we dance all night
Thought we'd get old
Guess you're not that type

And you don't ever call
Baby thats my life
She didn't ever show
Make a Gatsby cry
We could throw back
And we dance all night
Thought we'd get old
Guess you're not that type

And you don't ever call
Baby thats my life
