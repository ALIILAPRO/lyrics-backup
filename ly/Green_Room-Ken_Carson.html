		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (Wake up, F1LTHY)
Half of these niggas ain't never seen shit
And these bitches ain't seen shit neither
When she workout, she rockin' a track suit
It's Balenciaga Adidas

And this shit don't make no sense
How I went from broke to rich?
How the fuck you want me now, back then act' like you ain't notice me? (Notice me, notice me)
Yeah, now I got diamonds, now I got these jewels
Now these hoes comin' in two
Now my pockets filled with cash
Bitch, I walk around with them blues, yeah
Lil' bitch I walk around with them blues now
Yeah

You know how I rock, cut off stacks
Keep kush in my pocket, they treat my swag just like a dub the way these niggas knock it
Bitch, I'm in that mode like Naruto, I'm Nine-Tails fox
I won't want that ho if she ain't bringin' nothin' to the table but her box
I been gettin' tired of fuckin'
And I'm tired of being tired, shit, fuck it
Everyday I ball out, I make sure I get a bucket
How the fuck you don't know my middle name but you claim that you love me?
You don't love me (love me, love me)
I know you don't love me
If a bitch try me, it's gon' get real ugly
Yeah, she wanna leave, I'll let her leave if she already fucked me, huh
I'm such an asshole
Money over everything, these niggas gon' fold before my cash fold
Every time I post on Instagram, I make 'em mad, oh
Every time I pop out, you know I'm with a new bad ho, whoa
And you can't relate 'cause what I been doin' lately feel so unreal
And I get depressed, but I know there's nobody that feel how I feel (how I feel, how I feel, how I feel)
Yeah, I respect the lil' killa tryna catch a kill
I remember way-way back in the day, we couldn't even afford no meal
What I spent on purple drank, I coulda paid your bills all for a year
I was Uberin' everywhere now it's two-twenty on my dash when I steer

Half of these niggas ain't never seen shit
And these bitches ain't seen shit neither
When she workout, she rockin' a track suit
It's Balenciaga Adidas
And they say love can never ever be forever
So I'm takin' advantage of the moment
Bitch I'm at the top, ain't got no opps, ain't got no opponents
When you at the top, and nobody there, it get real real lonely
Everybody say this ho ain't goin' here, wait 'til I walk up on her
And this shit don't make no sense, I'm rich, I was dead broke on the corner

And this shit don't make no sense
How I went from broke to rich?
How the fuck you want me now, back then act' like you ain't notice me?
(Notice me, notice me, notice me, notice me)
Yeah, now I got diamonds, now I got these jewels
Now these hoes comin' in two
Now my pockets filled with cash
Bitch I walk around with them blues, yeah
Lil' bitch I walk around with them blues now
Yeah

You know how I rock, cut off stacks
Keep kush in my pocket
they treat my swag just like a dub the way these niggas knock it
Bitch, I'm in that mode like Naruto, I'm Nine-Tails fox
I won't want that ho if she ain't bringin' nothin' to the table but her box
