		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hurts to be around you
I can't stand to hear your lying
Whenever you're beside me
A part of me is dying

And every time I see you
I tell myself I'll never
Have this feeling with another
Oh, you're in my heart forever

What is it 
You think I need 
Everything
It's not true

Give it all up for you
Give it all up for you

Want to touch you
Show you how it feels
Whenever you're around
Take my time with you, my love

You're the one I'm thinking of
You're the one I'm thinking of
You're the one I really love

In my arms and fast asleep
In my arms and all my dreams
Where you are is where I want you
Where you are is where I want to
Where you are is where
I want to be
I want to be
I want to be
