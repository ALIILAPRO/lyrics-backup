		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every year around this time I start to think about you
We're really gonna have another Christmas Eve without you
I can't believe it's been so long
Every day finds a way to make me think about you
Like today when we were picking out the tree without you
I can't believe it's been so long
 
Oh, we miss you like hell, all the stories that you'd tell
About the boat that you built but never got to sail
I don't know whether I should cry or I should smile through my tears
But if you were here
 
We would sail that boat into the red horizon
Those years lost I'd tell you all about 'em
Gone don't always mean that you disappear
'Cause inside all of us you're still here
 
Another year has passed and now it's time for buying presents
I even got you one forgetting you're not gonna get it
I can't believe it's been so long
This time around we'll try to smile 'cause we're sick of tears 
Most days are easy now but it gets hard this time of year
I can't believe you're really gone
 
Oh, we miss you like hell, all the stories that you'd tell
About the boat that you built but never got to sail
I don't know whether I should cry or I should smile through my tears
But if you were here
 
We would sail that boat into the red horizon
Those years lost I'd tell you all about 'em
Gone don't always mean that you disappear
'Cause inside all of us you're still 
 Wild and free, I've got so many memories
Soon time too will take all of them from me
Gone don't always mean that you disappear
'Cause inside all of us you're still here
 
When it's dark and it's cold, everyone is comin' home
I just wish you could know that's when we're missing you the most
I don't know whether I should cry or I should smile through my tears
But if you were here
 
We would sail that boat into the red horizon
Those years lost I'd tell you all about 'em
Gone don't always mean that you disappear
'Cause inside all of us you're still 
Wild and free, I've got so many memories
Soon time too will take all of them from me
Gone don't always mean that you disappear
'Cause inside all of us you're still here
