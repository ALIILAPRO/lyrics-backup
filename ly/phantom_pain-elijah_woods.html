		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm biting my tongue
You're biting your nails
Uncomfortable silence
Down to a science
I wish I was numb
You make it look easy
Losing your person
Emotional surgeon
I thought we'd go it together
Two birds of a feather
Did we fly too close to the sun
Now when I turn off the lights, I feel your hands in my hair
All I see in my closet are the clothes you would wear
When I order takeout, I still order for two
When I look in the mirror all that I see is you
Cause losing your love is like I'm losing a leg
I see that your gone and all that's left, all that's left is phantom pain
Take all my love, a thief in the night
Habitually heartless, just me and the darkness
I wish I was numb like you
Then maybe this would be easy
Cause I would give you the air out my lungs
And the worst part is you don't deserve it, no
I thought we'd go it together
Two birds of a feather
Did we fly too close to the sun
Now when I turn off the lights, I feel your hands in my hair
All I see in my closet are the clothes you would wear
When I order takeout, I still order for two
When I look in the mirror all that I see is you
Cause losing your love is like I'm losing a leg
I see that your gone and all that's left
All that's left is phantom pain
Cause losing your love is like I'm losing a leg
I see that your gone and all that's left
All that's left is phantom pain
