		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You better make tracks fast on the double
The girl jazz you but she's nothing but trouble

Take her where she wants to go
And ev'ry day you let her know
She's the one who's always on your mind
But she just cops an attitude and leads you off and leaves you blue
Can't you see she's really just a waste of time?
One day she'll treat you nice
Then she'll turn as cold as ice
But you think your love will win her in the end, think again

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through, oo
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me I know
I know better than, better than, better than you

She gets you but then leaves you cold
And keeps you waitin' on the phone
'cause you know you'll alway give her on more try
I'm not the only boy in town
And she loves me into the ground
But tell me, do you really like standing in line?
Give her ev'rything you have and all it does is make you sad
What she really wants to do is tell her friends she did it again

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through, oo
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me I know
I know better than, better than, better than you

I'd like to say she used to be my girl
But that would be a lie
'Cause there's no one in this whole wide world
That could keep her satisfied
I know, 'cause I tried

One thing I hate is when a girl plays fake
And tries to make me late for another date
'Cause I tried to make you mine for the last time
So take this key as a kiss and a good-bye
She ain't worth it even though she's on a high tip
She better get a grip and get a grip quick
Fast in a hurry 'cause I won't buckle
The girl's jazzy but she's nothin' but trouble
Give her ev'rything you have all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do is tell her friends she did it again

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through, oo
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me I know
I know better than, better than, better than you

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through, oo
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me I know
I know better than, better than, better than you
