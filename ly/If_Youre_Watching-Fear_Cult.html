		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I've found what I'm looking for
Behind those eyes an open door
That vacant stare which I adore
I'm your slut, and you're my whore

Spare yourself the aching heart
And spare yourself the pain
Let us just make believe it's yesterday again
And mother, if you're watching, look away
And mother, if you're wondering, but don't know what to say
Mother, if you're watching, look away 
Just look away 

I think I found what I'm looking for
So hit the lights and shut the door
Listen carefully here's the score
I'm your slut, and you're my whore

Spare yourself the aching heart
And spare yourself the shame
Let us just make believe it's yesterday again
And mother, if you're watching, look away
And mother, if you're wondering, but don't know what to say
Mother, if you're watching, look away 
Just look away 

It sometimes make me sick inside
Ashamed of a life that I must hide
I know you'll never understand
I'm sorry there's no wedding band
But deep inside there's still that child
Innocent in a world gone wild
Obedient of your moral code
Scarred by a Christian overload
But still I live by truth and love
I still have hopes in the above
I still have interest in the cross
But mother if your listening shut if off

Mother, if you're watching look away
Just look away
Just look away
Just look away
