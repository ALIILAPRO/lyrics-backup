		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't tell me how to talk or how to live my life
(Fuck that shit, fuck that shit)
Every time I'm right a little part of you die
(Fuck that shit, fuck that shit)
Should I ever be punished for crossing the line
(Fuck that shit, fuck that shit)
It was made for those who can't think for themselves
(Fuck that shit, fuck that shit)

A little part of you DIE (16x)

You keep judging my ** ** what I fake
(Fuck that shit, fuck that shit)
I'm just a drowning maggot in your wallowed life
(Fuck that shit, fuck that shit)
You pretend to be god you tried to fuck me in the ass
(Fuck that shit, fuck that shit)
Consequence - I'll fucking shoot you in the head
(Fuck that shit, fuck that shit)


A little part of you DIE (16x)

Revolt
It's revolution
Bring out the guillotine

Revolt
It's the part of solution
Bring out the guillotine

Fuck that shit, fuck that shit (4x)

A little part of you DIE (16x)

Fuck That Shit

Revolt
It's revolution
Bring out the guillotine

Revolt
It's the part of solution
Bring out the guillotine

A little part of you DIE (8x)

Revolt
It's the part of solution
Bring out the guillotine

Revolt
Bring out the guillotine

Bring out the guillotine
