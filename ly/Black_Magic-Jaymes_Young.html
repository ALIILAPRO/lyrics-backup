		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I let you in my brain
I used to doubt, now I believe
I let you ease my pain
Using your black magic on me

I don't know how you do what you do
But you do it so good to me
My favorite pill when I'm feeling so blue
Your taste is all I need

Baby, you're my cocaine
I can't stop sniffing
You move so good, got Muhammad Ali tripping
The moment that I get you in my veins
I'm taking over the world

I let you in my brain
I used to doubt, now I believe
I let you ease my pain
Using your black magic on me (Oh, oh)
Using your black magic on me (Oh, oh)
Using your black magic on me

You make it feel so damn good to be bad
You're the best I ever had
You're cold-blooded and I love it
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Baby, you're my ocean
I can't stop swimming
The salt of your waves and
I can't stop sipping
The moment that I get you all alone (Alone)

I let you in my brain
I used to doubt, now I believe
I let you ease my pain
Using your black magic on me (Oh, oh)
Using your black magic on me (Oh, oh)
Using your black magic on me

When I was young (O oh) my father warned me
About girls like you (O oh)
About girls like you (Oh) , oh
When my heart is numb (Oh)
And I'm feeling lonely
I let you through (O oh)
And you fix my blues up

I let you in my brain
I used to doubt, now I believe
I let you ease my pain
Using your black magic on me (Oh, oh)
Using your black magic on me (Oh, oh)
Using your black magic on me

(Oh, Oh)
(Oh) i love it, baby (Oh)
