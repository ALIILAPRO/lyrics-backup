		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been out here waiting til night fall
It feels so right when the lights don't fade
Days like this don't last so we might stall
We've been living like kings and we hope it don't change

We stand by the notion that anything goes
I'm feeling this motion from morning to close
And even when night takes the day we don't care
That's how we build on these memories we share

Like mom's not home
Summer nights
Love 'em how they take so long

One, two, three

Jumpin' off the porch like mom's not home (not home)
Tell me why the best things feel so wrong (so wrong)
Summer nights, love 'em how they take so long (so long)
Run with the feeling of being alive while we're still young
Jumpin' off the porch like mom's not home (not home)
Just a couple kids livin' on our own (on our own)
Summer nights, love 'em how they take so long (so long)
Run with the feeling of being alive while we're still young

I'll leave, where is my hat, sun in my eyes
Summer breeze, lay on my skin, I come alive
Sweet waves, they crashin' in, water and wine
These days, that's all I need, some peace of mind

So I hop I out the window, I'll make this my own
Them good vibes, my symbol, now I'm free to roam
And even when night takes the day we don't care
That's how we build on these memories we share

That's how we build on these memories we share
That's how we build on these memories we share

Jumpin' off the porch like mom's not home (not home)
Tell me why the best things feel so wrong (so wrong)
Summer nights, love 'em how they take so long (so long)
Run with the feeling, of being alive while we're still young
Jumpin' off the porch like mom's not home (not home)
Just a couple kids living on our own (on our own)
Summer nights, love 'em how they take so long (so long)
Run with the feeling of being alive while we're still young
