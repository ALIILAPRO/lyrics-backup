		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We all lie
Tell you the truths
Sometimes we laugh and easily lie

Alright 
It's a, it's faker

Shout it out
What you want for the world
Money, honor, beauty, everything you want
Play with a mask to hide the truth
People cheat each other, right?

Is this really true?
Is this really true?
Is this really true?

Is this really true?
Is this really true?
Is this really true?

We all lie
Tell you the truths
Sometimes we laugh and easily lie

Alright 
It's a, it's faker

Shout it out
What you want for the world
Money, honor, beauty, everything you want
Play with a mask to hide the truth
People cheat each other, right?

Run away with me (is this really true?)
It'll be the way you want it (is this really true?)
(Is this really true?)
(Is this really true?)

Run away with me (is this really true?)
It'll be the way you want it (is this really true?)
(Is this really true?)
(Is this really true?)

(We all lie)
(Tell you the truths)

Shout it out
What you want for the world
Money, honor, beauty, everything you want
Play with a mask to hide the truth (is this really true?)
People cheat each other, right? (Is this really true?)

Hoo-ooh
People cheat each other, right?
Hoo-ooh
Hoo-ooh
