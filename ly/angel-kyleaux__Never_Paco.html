		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She gon' run away, took my heart into the grave
Shawty she don't play, she gon' do it right away
That's my type of bae, I'll take you somewhere far-away
She got my heart racin', oh she got me going crazy
She gon' run away, took my heart into the grave
Shawty she don't play, she gon' do it right away
That's my type of bae, I'll take you somewhere far-away
She got my heart racin', oh she got me going crazy
Time was moving fast, but I was living slow
I thought that she would be the one to hold me when I fall
I gave her everything I had, turns out she was cold
Now I can't even trust myself from all those lies you told
I just wanna run away from home now, but you're my hometown, I feel so alone now
All those memories haunting my brain, no
Things don't feel the same now
I'm stuck in my ways oh
She gon' run away, took my heart into the grave
Shawty she don't play, she gon' do it right away
That's my type of bae, I'll take you somewhere far-away
She got my heart racin', oh she got me going crazy
She gon' run away, took my heart into the grave
Shawty she don't play, she gon' do it right away
That's my type of bae, I'll take you somewhere far-away
She got my heart racin', oh she got me going crazy
Hold up, wait
We could've worked on our "something", I got em hoes, I mean what if?
I couldn't see where I'm going, ridin' with you with my foreign
Came in your life just to fuck it up, sum it up yeah
I got them bitches but you're the one who got it all yeah
Bet, I was moving fast, yet I was sippin' slow
I'm tryna get on with you baby but I guess we wouldn't gon' work in a row
Time was moving fast, I fell in love with you
Now that you're gone, I've been feeling so lonely don't know what I'm supposed to do
She gon' run away, took my heart into the grave
Shawty she don't play, she gon' do it right away
That's my type of bae, I'll take you somewhere far-away
She got my heart racin', oh she got me going crazy
She gon' run away, took my heart into the grave
Shawty she don't play, right away
That's my type like Jaye, I'll take you somewhere far-away
She got my heart racin', oh god I miss you everyday, oh
