		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh

Who's in the shadows?
Who's ready to play?
Are we the hunters?
Or are we the prey?
There's no surrender
And there's no escape
Are we the hunters?
Or are we the prey?

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

This is a wild game of survival

This is a wild game of survival

This is a wild game
This is a wild game, game of survival
This is a wild game
This is a wild game, game of survival

This is a wild game of survival
