		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lost in your halo 
Lost in your halo 
Lost in your halo 
Lost in your halo

There's trouble in paradise 
Morning comes but it's dark outside 
The damage is done 
The damage is done 
We've fallen apart 
And the ghosts of your past 
Came back haunting you down

I've been having the same dream 
Over & over 
I've been hearing the same scream 
Over & Over
I've been having the same dream 
Over & over 
I've been hearing the same scream 
Over & Over
I've been having the same dream 
Over & over 
I've been hearing the same scream 
Over & Over

Nkunda imana yangye 
Arabwira wewe 

Halo
Lost in your halo 
Yeah yeah yeah
 I'm lost in your halo
