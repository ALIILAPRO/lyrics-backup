		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He been trying to call but she not at home
City-wide tour. Yeah she's on the road
She just don't want to be alone
Moving through the streetlights
Fading in and out
When she needs a high
I'm the one that she calls
He don't satisfy
Make her feel alive
She ain't even mine
But she want to be with me in the city
(Be with me in the city)
She always gets her way in the city
(Gets her way in the city)
She just want to get away to the city
City girls love to have fun in the city
So it's never just one in the city (yeah)
Too turned up. If you only knew
She's got you thinking that it's only you (yeah)
Last time she made it to the altar, that's her past life
Runaway Bride, still addicted to the fast life
She says every time's the last time
(Every time's the last time)
She says every night's the last night
(Night)
Moving through the streetlights
Fading in and out (Fading)
When she needs a high
I'm the one that she calls
He don't satisfy (Don't satisfy)
Make her feel alive (Don't feel alive)
She ain't even mine
But she want to be with me in the city
(Be with me in the city)
She always gets her way in the city
(Gets her way in the city)
She just want to get away to the city
Since 20 she ain't seeing 20/20
Rearview mirrors got her looping with no ending
She gon' do it for that louis and the FENDI
It's only love for her money and the city
