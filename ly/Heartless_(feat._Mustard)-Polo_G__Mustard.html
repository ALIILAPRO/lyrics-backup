		  (Mustard on the beat, ho)

My youngin's heartless so they ain't playin' no games
We really want 'em dead, he got hit up close range
He fucked up in the head, he wanna see some mo' brains
On that corner I can't stay up out that dope game
My cousin got indicted dealing cocaine
She an Instagram addict, she want mo' fame
I used to starve, now I'm blowing up like propane
Told my inner-self, "I promise you I won't change"

We make it hot up on yo block, we let that heat blow
Catch an opp, we dump the clip, it's time to reload
Put a scope on the AR just like a peep-hole
Think he a bully, we got choppers for the Deebo
Seven figure nigga, tryna maximize them three o's
Before the bag, I was fucking all the freak ho's
Balling hard, young legend out the Chi' bitch, I'm like D. Rose
"Cap, how you make it out this shit?" I got the cheat code
Way more to life then just the hood, I'm trying to reach goals
Maxine, my heart, since you've been gone, I miss your sweet soul
Aye, never tell a statement, we won't leak those
Better not go talkin to them people, better keep closed

My youngin's heartless so they ain't playin' no games
We really want 'em dead, he got hit up close range
He fucked up in the head, he wanna see some mo' brains
On that corner I can't stay up out that dope game
My cousin got indicted dealing cocaine
She an Instagram addict, she want mo' fame
I used to starve, now I'm blowing up like propane
Told my inner-self, "I promise you I won't change"

We hold a grudge and we want blood, we can't look past the issue
Play with us then and you gon' die, nigga, it's kinda simple
Show no mercy, we gon' kill whoever riding with you
Catch you on the other side then we gon' have to get you
Condolences to yo family, they gon' have to miss you
Lil' Joe on go and he gon' spark, that's if I pass the signal
My right hand mans, he got his name 'cause he gon' blast the pistol
Earned our stripes, we gon' blow if a nigga play foul
You would think we had a whistle
Lil' Cap-a-lot, G-O-A-T, yeah that's that guy's initials
Happiness and depression, I'm stuck inside the middle
I fell in love with dollar signs, won't let my mind forget you
Fuck it off, we spend it all on fast cars, and shining crystals

My youngin's heartless so they ain't playin' no games
We really want 'em dead, he got hit up close range
He fucked up in the head, he wanna see some mo' brains
On that corner I can't stay up out that dope game
My cousin got indicted dealing cocaine
She an Instagram addict, she want mo' fame
I used to starve, now I'm blowing up like propane
Told my inner-self, "I promise you I won't change"
