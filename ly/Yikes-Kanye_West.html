		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself

Tweakin', tweakin' off that 2CB, huh?
Is he gon' make it? TBD, huh
Thought I was gon' run, DMC, huh?
I done died and lived again on DMT, huh
See this a type of high that won't come down
This the type of high that get you gunned down
Yeezy, Yeezy trollin' OD, huh?
Turn TMZ to Smack DVD, huh?
Russell Simmons wanna pray for me too
I'ma pray for him 'cause he got #MeToo'd
Thinkin' what if that happened to me too
Then I'm on E! News

Shit can get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
Shit can get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself

Ayy, hospital band a hundred bands, fuck a watch
Hundred grand'll make your best friends turn to opps
I hear y'all bringin' my name up a lot
Guess I just turned the clout game up a notch
See, y'all really shocked but I'm really not
You know how many girls I took to the titty shop?
If she get the ass with it that's a 50 pop
I still bring the bad bitches in the city out
Uh, just a different type of leader
We could be in North Korea, I could smoke with Wiz Khalifa
Uh, told my wife I've never seen her
After I hit it, bye Felicia, that's the way that I'ma leave it

Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
See this is why all the bitches fuck with Ye, fuck what they talk about
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
They take me on meds, off meds, ask yourself
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Ask your homegirl right now, look, you had a shot at Ye
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
You drop everything

Tweakin', tweakin' off that 2CB, haan?
This is why your bitches fuck with me, huh
Smash, she gon' end up on TV, huh?
Last thing that you ever wanna see, huh
I can feel the spirits all around me
I think Prince and Mike was tryna warn me
They know I got demons all on me
Devil been tryna make an army
They been strategizin' to harm me
They don't know they dealin' with a zombie
Niggas been tryna test my Gandhi
Just because I'm dressed like Abercrombie

You see? You see?
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
That's why I fuck with Ye
See that was my third person
That's my bipolar shit, nigga what?
That's my superpower, nigga ain't no disability
I'm a superhero! I'm a superhero!
Ahhh!
