		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mm, mm, mm, mm

You say hold me like you want me
Like there's still things to give up
And kiss me like you need me
And pretend like it's enough

You've been telling me all your secrets
Hoping I'd be the one who keep 'em
'Cause you thought that I'll always be around
I've been chasing on every feeling
Hoping I'd feel the way you're feeling
Thinking I would've found them all by now

I let you down, I let you down, I'm that mistake
Make you afraid to try someone
Sometimes I wish I could go back and
Make us never happen, save us from it all
If I could I would never let you down
Make us never happen
If I could I would never let you down
Sometimes I wish I could go back and
Make us never happen, save us from it all
If I could I would never let you down

You told me in a letter
You can love me better than before
Like you live for me
I would never let you lose yourself to prove me wrong

You've been telling me all your secrets
Hoping I'd be the one who keep 'em
'Cause you thought that I'll always be around
I've been chasing on every feeling
Hoping I'd feel the way you're feeling
Thinking I would've found them all by now

I let you down, I let you down, I'm that mistake
Make you afraid to try someone
Sometimes I wish I could go back and
Make us never happen, save us from it all
If I could I would never let you down
Make us never happen
If I could I would never let you down
Sometimes I wish I could go back and
Make us never happen, save us from it all
If I could I would never let you down

Mm, mm, mm
