		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In your room
Where time stands still
Or moves at your will

Will you let the morning come soon
Or will you leave me lying here?
In your favourite darkness
Your favourite half-light
Your favourite consciousness
Your favourite slave

In your room
Where souls disappear
Only you exist here

Will you lead me to your armchair
Or leave me lying here?
Your favourite innocence
Your favourite prize
Your favourite smile
Your favourite slave

I'm hanging on your words
Living on your breath
Feeling with your skin
Will I always be here?
I'm hanging on your words
Living on your breath
Feeling with your skin
Will I always be here?
I'm hanging on your words
Living on your breath
Feeling with your skin
Will I always be here?

In your room
Your burning eyes
Cause flames to arise
Will you let the fire die down soon?
Or will I always be here
Your favourite passion
Your favourite game
Your favourite mirror
Your favourite slave

I'm hanging on your words
Living on your breath
Feeling with your skin
Will I always be here?

I'm hanging on your words
Living on your breath
Feeling with your skin
Will I always be here?

I'm hanging on your words
Living on your breath
Feeling with your skin
Will I always be here?

I'm hanging on your words
Living on your breath
Feeling with your skin
Will I always be here?
