		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel destructive
But I've got myself to blame
Looking for balance
Tell me why you and I never feel the same
You know I mean it
and it's been so hard to say
But I think I've realised

That I want you
To break my heart again
So I can feel
Something that I'm used to
I, I wish I had of known
What we had
'Cause I don't know if I could

Lose you
I could
Lose you
Lose you
I could
Lose

Picking my battles
But I think I'm losing ground
Wish I could vanish
Just to see what it's like without you around
Why do we hold on, like we'll find a way somehow?
When I think I've realised

That I want you
To break my heart again
So I can feel
Something that I'm used to
I, I wish I had of known
What we had
'Cause I don't know if I could

Lose you
I could
Lose you
Lose you
I could
Lose

I don't want to wake up there
I shouldn't have to lose myself to stay with you
Let you know I've always cared
Cause I'm alone and I feel like I should
Tell me did I let you down (mm)
You say you want to clear the air, well I do too
Maybe we should just be friends
'Cause I'm afraid that I'll give up again

'Cause I, want you
To break my heart again
So I can feel
Something that I'm used to
I, I wish I had of known
What we had
'Cause I don't know if I want

You
To break my heart again
So I can feel
Something that I'm used to
I, I wish I had of known
What we had
'Cause I don't know if I could

Lose you
I could
Lose you
Lose you
I could
Lose
