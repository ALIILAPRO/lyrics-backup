		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All we ever wanted 
Was everything
All we ever got 
Was cold

Get up, eat jelly
Sandwich bars and barbed wire
And squash every week into a day

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

The sound of the drum 
Is calling
The sound of the drum 
Has called

Flash of youth shoot out of darkness
Factory town

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Oh to be the cream
Oh to be the cream
Oh to be the cream
Oh to be the cream

Oh to be the cream
Oh to be the cream
