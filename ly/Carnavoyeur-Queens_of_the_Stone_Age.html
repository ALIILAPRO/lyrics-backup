		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nothing, nothing
Nothing inside
And there's no reason to cry
Just fade away like love

Clutching, hanging
By a nail in this life
Desperate always, always looks that way

Free fall from the nest
Then glide to the left
A shine catch the eye
So flow on to the right
Flying high, realize
There are no more mountains to climb

And there's nothing l can do
Accept, enjoy the view
When there's nothing l can do
I smile

Minutes, seconds
So little time
Give your secrets away?
Well, whisper in my ear

Every living thing will die
From the King of the Jungle to butterfly
Only sin is waiting too long

When there's nothing I can do
I smile

I smile

Free fall from the nest
Then glide to the left
A shine catch the eye
So float to the right
Flying high, realize
There are no more mountains to climb

We live, we die
We fail, we rise
I'm a vulture so I hear goodbyes
There's no end to life
On and on, always life
On and on, always life
