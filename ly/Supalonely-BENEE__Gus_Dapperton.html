		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know I fucked up, I'm just a loser
Shouldn't be with ya, guess I'm a quitter
While you're out there drinkin', I'm just here thinkin'
'Bout where I should've been
I've been lonely, mm, ah, yeah

Water pouring down from the ceilin'
I knew this would happen, still hard to believe it
Maybe I'm dramatic, I don't wanna seem it
I don't wanna panic

I'm a sad girl, in this big world
It's a mad world
All of my friends know what's happened
You're a bad thing (ah!)

I know I fucked up, I'm just a loser
Shouldn't be with ya, guess I'm a quitter
While you're out there drinkin', I'm just here thinkin'
'Bout where I should've been
I've been lonely, mm, ah, yeah

La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Lonely (I'm a lonely bitch)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Lonely (super lonely)

Now I'm in the bathtub, cryin'
Think I'm slowly sinking, bubbles in my eyes
Now, maybe I'm just dreamin'
Now I'm in the sad club, just tryna get a backrub (lonely)

I'm a sad girl, in this big world
It's a mad world
All of my friends know what's happened
You're a bad thing

I know I fucked up (fucked up), I'm just a loser (loser)
Shouldn't be with ya (with ya), guess I'm a quitter (quitter)
While you're out there drinkin' (drinkin'), I'm just here thinkin'
'Bout where I should've been (where I should've been)
I've been lonely, mm, ah, yeah

La-la-la-la (woo), la-la-la-la
Lonely (I'm a lonely bitch)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Lonely (super lonely)

I loathe romancing in itself yea I'd be damned to try
I'm only dancing by myself so I don't slam my Irish buck
Compostable cups B-B-Benee I can't stress this enough
I would hate to mess things up
But my boogie still stays restless as fuck, yeah

I know I fucked up, I'm just a loser
Shouldn't be with ya, guess I'm a quitter
While you're out there drinkin', I'm just here thinkin'
'Bout where I should've been
I've been lonely, mm, ah, yeah

La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la (la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la)
Lonely (I'm a lonely bitch) (la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la (la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la)
Lonely (super lonely) (lonely)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la (I've been lonely, I've been lonely)
Lonely (I've been lonely, by the way)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la (la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la)
Lonely (I've been lonely)
