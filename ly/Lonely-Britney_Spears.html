		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To think I'm so naive
How dare you play with me?
I gave you heart and soul, yeah
Tell me baby, please
Why you screwing with my head?
I don't think you understand
I won't take your (huh) no more
Don't knock on my door

Not this time, because I recognize
I've heard it all before, and I-I-I

Think of all the time that I wasted
Think of all the times that I took you back
Ain't no way I'll be lonely
I don't want to let you back in
Let's just face it
Better off alone and I won't turn back
You thought that I would be lonely
I don't want to let you back in

Don't tell me how to feel
Or say that you're for real
My mind's made up, I'm cool without you
You got no more appeal
Now this girl don't need no man
Says what she can do what she can
Now I live for me
Boy, does that make you weep?

Not this time, because I realize
I've heard it all before, and I-I-I

Think of all the time that I wasted
Think of all the times that I took you back
Ain't no way I'll be lonely
I don't want to let you back in
Let's just face it
Better off alone and I won't turn back
You thought that I would be lonely
I don't want to let you back in

Think of times
You made me cry
You had me so confused
I'm tired of trying
Leave behind this
What's a girl to do?

I think of all the times you made me sick
I used to think I couldn't handle it
What you think, I'm just another chick?
Messed with Brit, boy, you must have tripped
What were you thinking when you lost my trust?
You had it all now you're left with nothing
Oh baby, now I know you want my touch
And now you're lonely and you still want me

Think of all the time that I wasted
Think of all the times that I took you back
Ain't no way I'll be lonely
I don't want to let you back in
Let's just face it
Better off alone and I won't turn back
You thought that I would be lonely
I don't want to let you back in
Think of all the time that I wasted
Think of all the times that I took you back
Ain't no way I'll be lonely
I don't want to let you back in
Let's just face it
Better off alone and I won't turn back
You thought that I would be lonely
I don't want to let you back in
