		  A few weeks ago
I saw you front row
And my heart stopped at the sight (Ooh, yeah)
Thought you were solo (Thought you were solo)
But you got a girl though (But you got a girl though)
And my life ain't been the same
Been feelin'

Mentally, physically weak
Boys blowin' up my phone
They just ain't you, oh, baby
I'm meant to be on my own
But just before I go
There's something you should know
And boy, I

I fantasize about it all the time
If you were mine
I'd give this pussy to you, nine-to-five, five-to-nine
Try to behave, but I'm feelin' some type of (Way) way
That just ain't me

A few months later
You're still together (Oh, babe)
And you just can't tell me why, why
So, boy, stop pretendin', yeah
'Cause I won't keep waitin'
I'm out the door, bye, bye, bye (Tell me you love me though)
Been feelin'

Mentally, physically weak (Weak)
Boys blowin' up my phone
They just ain't you, oh, baby (You)
I'm meant to be on my own (I'd rather be on my own)
But just before I go (I go)
There's something you should know (Should know)
And boy, I

I fantasize about it all the time
If you were mine (If you were mine, baby)
I'd give this pussy to you, nine-to-five, five-to-nine
Try to behave, but I'm feelin' some type of (Way) way
That just ain't me

Ooh-ooh (I could never do anything like that)
Ooh-ooh, oh (I mean, I would, but I'm just too nice, I'm too hot)

Mentally, physically weak
Boys blowin' up my phone
They just ain't you, ooh, baby

I fantasize about it all the time (Time)
If you were mine (If you were mine)
I'd give this pussy to you, nine-to-five, five-to-nine
Try to behave, but I'm feelin' some type of way (Some type of way)
That just ain't me

Ooh-ooh (Haha, ha)
That just ain't me, baby, aye
Ooh-ooh, oh
Tryna behave
Try to behave, but I'm feelin' some type of way (Some type of way)
That just ain't me
