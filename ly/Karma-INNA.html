		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm tired of heartbreak
I'm tired of feeling like this all over again
I make the same mistakes every time
And I know it's not good for my head

Baby you lost me when we broke down
You're further than faded
I'm glad I got out before we drowned 'cause

I don't need you in my life
I don't want you in my nights
I've already said goodbye
No, no, you ain't what I need
Every time you're gettin' high
Tell yourself another lie
Delete my number please
'Cause karma's a bitch
But she ain't got nothin' on me

Karma's a bitch but she ain't got nothin' on me
Karma's a bitch but she ain't got nothin' on me

I miss the passion
I miss the fire inside that we used to have
We were destructive
Bad in the worst way
I knew we were never gonna last

Baby you lost me when we broke down
You're further than faded
I'm glad I got out before we drowned 'cause

I don't need you in my life
I don't want you in my nights
I've already said goodbye
No, no, you ain't what I need
Every time you're gettin' high
Tell yourself another lie
Delete my number please
'Cause karma's a bitch
But she ain't got nothin' on me

Karma's a bitch but she ain't got nothin' on me
Karma's a bitch but she ain't

Don't call me up, don't call it love
'Cause that's not who we are
You left me broken, left me hurting with a shattered heart
Don't call me up, don't call it love
'Cause that's not what we are
You left me broken, you left me hurtin'

I don't need you in my life
I don't want you in my nights
I've already said goodbye
No, no, you ain't what I need
Every time you're gettin' high
Tell yourself another lie
Delete my number please
'Cause karma's a bitch
But she ain't got nothin' on me
