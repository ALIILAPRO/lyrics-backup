		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bathing in the silence of my bedroom again
Staring at the pictures of us
You were so beautiful
Why'd I have to kill you

Skin cold as ice
Girl dressed up in white
You're my corpse bride

The devil's knocking at my door
And I don't mind if he comes in
I'm giving up all my fears
And replaced them with my hatred

I've been getting bad sleep
Cause I can feel your gaze in the floor boards
Please let me be
Let me be

Skin cold as ice
Girl dressed up in white
You're my corpse bride

I've never seen her before
I've never seen her before
How could I do such a thing
How could I do such a thing

Why did I have to

Skin cold as ice
Girl dressed up in white
You're my corpse bride
You're my corpse bride
You're my corpse bride
