		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, where, oh, where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to Heaven so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road, straight ahead
A car was stalled, the engine was dead
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget the sound that night
The screamin' tires, the bustin' glass
The painful scream that I heard last

Oh, where, oh, where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to Heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

When I woke up, the rain was pourin' down
There were people standing all around
Something warm falling through my eyes
But somehow I found my baby that night
I lifted her head, she looked at me and said
"Hold me, darling, just a little while"
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love that I knew I'd miss
Well, now she's gone, even though I hold her tight
I lost my love, my life that night

Oh, where, oh, where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to Heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh (hey)
Ooh ooh

Oh ooh
Oh ooh
Oh ooh, yeah
Oh
