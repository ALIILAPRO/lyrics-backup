		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me

All of my "let's just be friends"
Are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong?
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends"
Are friends I don't have anymore
Guess it's what they say you need family for
'Cause I can't depend on you anymore

Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car
That looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet
And now we're meeting our end

And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

You're so predictable, I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through?
You can't even figure out what's going on with you 
You judge me 'fore you met me, yeah, it figures
I make all the players anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A., I don't know what's going on (yeah)
I don't know what's going on

And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing 'cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving 'em all like I work for minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya, that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling a way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that

All of my "let's just be friends"
Are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong?
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends"
Are friends I don't have anymore
Guess it's what they say you need your family for
'Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closer

Any time people wanna start problems
It's like "for real, are you dumb?"
You know who mans are?
I'm not afraid no gyal heart man
And I'm not afraid of no cyattie
And I'm not afraid of no waste yute neither
So anybody who want it can get it
Seh feh
