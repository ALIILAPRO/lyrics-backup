		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I found your picture looking through a book
It was the one I took
When we were driving on Sunset
Descendents playing on a mix CD
That you just made for me
You wrote "For when you miss me" on it

I can't stop myself when I listen
I always sing along
Reliving every minute
And I just can't take it
I wish that I could forget you even exist
And find a way to, be without you
'Cause I miss you and I hate feeling like this
It's making me sick
Feeling nostalgic

Every year when October comes around
And it gets colder out
I grab my favorite hoodie
There's still a hole from when you borrowed it
You used to sleep in it
'Cause it reminded you of me

Can't stop myself when I'm thinking
I only see your face
Reliving every minute
And I just can't take it
I wish that I could forget you even exist
And find a way to, be without you
'Cause I miss you and I hate feeling like this
It's making me sick
Feeling nostalgic

I wish that I could forget you even exist
And find a way to, be without you
'Cause I miss you and I hate feeling like this
It's making me sick
Feeling nostalgic

Maybe someday my heart will be over it
Maybe someday I'll be ok
But I miss you and I hate feeling like this
It's making me sick
Feeling nostalgic, feeling nostalgic
Feeling nostalgic, feeling nostalgic
