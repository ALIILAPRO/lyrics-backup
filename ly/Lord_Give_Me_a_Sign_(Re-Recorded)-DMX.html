		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, uh
In the name of Jesus, yes (spread the word)
No weapon formed against me shall prosper (preach)
And every tongue that rises against me at judgment, thou shalt condemn (preach)
Lord, give me a sign
For this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord (preach)
And their righteousness is of me, said the Lord (preach)
Amen, uh

Lord, give me a sign
I really need to talk to you, Lord
Since the last time we talked, the walk has been hard
Now I know you haven't left me
But I feel like I'm alone
I'm a big boy now, but I'm still not grown
And I'm still going through it (what)
Pain and the hurt (yeah)
Soaking up trouble like rain in the dirt (yeah)
And I know only I can stop the rain
With just the mention of my savior's name (uh, uh, uh)
In the name of Jesus
Devil, I rebuke you, for what I go through
And tryna make me do what I used to (what)
But all that stops right here (yeah)
As long as the Lords in my life, I will have no fear
I will know no pain from the light to the dark (uh, come on)
I will show no shame, spit it right from the heart (come on)
'Cause it's right from the start, you held me down
And ain't nothin' they can tell me now
Lord, give me a sign

Let me know what's on your mind
Let me know what I'm gon' find
It's all in time
Show me how to teach the mind
Show me how to reach the blind
Lord, give me a sign
Show me what I gots to do
To bring me closer to you
'Cause I'ma go through
Whatever you want me to
Just let me know what to do
Lord, give me a sign

Please show me somethin' (somethin')
I'm tired of talkin' to him knowin' he frontin' (frontin')
Cryin' 'bout life ain't nothin' (nothin')
But you either be the one mad 'cause you trapped, or the one huntin' (come on)
Trapped in your own mind waiting on the Lord (yeah)
Or hunting with the word that cuts like a sword
The spoken word is stronger than the strongest man (uh, uh, uh)
Carries the whole world like the strongest hand
Through the trials and tribulations, you never let us down
Jesus, I know you're here with us now
Jesus, I know you're still with us now
Keep it real with us now, I wanna feel, show me how (please)
Let me take your hand, guide me (what)
And walk slow but stay right beside me (please)
Devil's tryna find me (please)
Hide me, hold up, I take that back
Protect me and give me the strength to fight back
Lord, give me a sign

Let me know what's on your mind
Let me know what I'm gon' find
It's all in time
Show me how to teach the mind
Show me how to reach the blind
Lord, give me a sign
Show me what I gots to do
To bring me closer to you
'Cause I'ma go through
Whatever you want me to
Just let me know what to do
Lord, give me a sign

Life or death, live or die (uh)
I will never live a lie (uh)
I'm gon' get because I try (what)
I won't quit until I die (what)
I'm gon' make it wrong or right (yeah)
Make it through the darkest night (yeah)
When the morning comes you'll see
All I have is God in me (uh)
Lord, give me a sign (whoa)

No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Please 
Lord, give me a sign
For this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord
In the name of Jesus
Lord give me a sign

Let me know what's on your mind
Let me know what I'm gon' find
It's all in time
Show me how to teach the mind
Show me how to reach the blind
Lord, give me a sign
Show me what I gots to do
To bring me closer to you
'Cause I'ma go through
Whatever you want me to
Just let me know what to do
Lord, give me a sign
