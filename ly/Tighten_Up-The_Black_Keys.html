		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanted love, I needed love
Most of all, most of all
Someone said true love was dead
And I'm bound to fall, bound to fall
For you
Oh, what can I do?
Yeah

Take my badge but my heart remains
Lovin' you, baby child
Tighten up on your reins
You're runnin' wild, runnin' wild
It's true

Sick for days, so many ways
I'm achin' now, I'm achin' now
It's times like these I need relief
Please show me how, oh, show me how
To get right
Yes, out of sight

When I was young and moving fast
Nothin' slowed me down, oh, slowed me down
Now I let the others pass
I've come around, oh, come around
'Cause I've found

Livin' just to keep goin'
Goin' just to be sane
All the while not knowin'
Such a shame
I don't need to get steady
I know just how I feel
Tellin' you to be ready
My dear
