		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't get over you
I can't get over you
And before I die I'll pray that
I could be the one
That I could be the one
But I won't be no fun
If I can't have you, no one can

Highlights, in the limelight
Can you show me
To the nightlife?
Baby I like, all colors like
But I want you, and I don't know right (don't know right)

Tell me more, I got a box cutter with your name on it
Tell me more, I can't stay this long on the same topic
Don't know you, but would I fall in love with you?
I don't have no social cues
I'm all for you
Ayy

I can't get over you (yeah, ooh-ooh)
Can't get over you 
And before I die I'll pray (yup) 
That I could be the one
That I could be the one
But I won't be no fun
If I can't have you, no one can
