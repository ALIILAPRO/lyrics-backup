		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy
Elevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
So much on my plate I gotta delegate
Baka passed a drug test, we gotta celebrate
I'm in bed awake, thinkin' how'd I make
All this happen for myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be
(Yeah, yeah)

If you need me, you can't call me
I stay busy makin' money
You know what is on my mind
All I think about is hunnids
I stay busy (bzz!) workin' on me
I stay busy with my business, homie
I already hit her when you left her lonely
She is not the type that likes to take things slowly
Slowly, my mouth is goin' off, I don't know patience
I got a chance, then my niggas got it too like it's contagious
I see the future when I get wavy (Wavy God!)
But I couldn't picture bein' Champagne 
When I would buy that shit and save it for the right occasion
I couldn't picture changes when I was with Ms. Creighton
That lady hates me
Couldn't picture wifin' Braden 
When I was pumpin' gas on road trips to go from Cincinnati on to Dayton
I couldn't gauge it
I wanna thank God for workin' way harder than Satan
He's playin' favorites, it feels amazin' 

(Yeah) elevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
Me and all the guys found a better way
This a life bid, we can never separate
I'm in bed awake, thinkin' how'd I make
All this happen for myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be

Yeah, I can only tell you shit in pieces
As it happens to me I begin to write the thesis
Freddy got the Aria setup like it's a Freaknik
Vegas like Marine Land, that big whale treatment
Georgie got me up a hunnid thousand for the weekend
I gotta move the safe beside the bed when I be sleepin'
My mood is changin' this summer I'ma be tweakin'
