		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Peep and Makonnen, everybody know them
Came with your girlfriend, left with your boyfriend
(I'm a punk star) everybody know them
(Bitch, I feel like Fish Narc) came with your girlfriend
Left with your boyfriend

Pickin' up my phone and callin' up Makonnen
Like baby, is you rollin'? He said he only smokin'
He said he only smokin', yeah
Pickin' up my phone and callin' up Makonnen
Like baby, is you rollin'? He said he only smokin' (said he only smokin')
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa, whoa, yeah
Pickin' up my phone and callin' up Makonnen
Like baby, is you rollin'? He said he only smokin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Heart wide open, worlds get broken
Girls get soakin' when we walk up (when we walk up)
Everybody frozen when we walk up (when we walk up)
Hearts get broken when we walk up (when we walk up)
Left wrist golden when we walk up
Ex bitch choosing when we walk up (when we walk up)
Everybody frozen when we walk up (when we walk up)
When we walk up, yeah

I'll hold them back (yeah)
Smokin' so much daily, man, I blow a bag
Feeling kinda wavy like a sailor-man
Girls say I'm crazy 'cause I take their dad, yeah, ayy
I'm on vacation, I'm out here fuckin' stayin'
This permanent, do you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm sorta slayin', but flyin' like a dragon
I'm the only one to known to make it happen
The town, we do it every night
And every day, I really like to play
I take a flight across the USA
I ride away until the end of day
All alone, I don't ever think that I can find a clone
'Less I'm fuckin' growin' on a plant of weed
Everybody know that I keep the seeds, yeah
Like, tell what you need, baby, is you really smokin'?
'Cause I'd like to laugh, but right now I'm not jokin'
You see me riding big, but them rims ain't spoken
Yeah, 'cause

Heart wide open, worlds get broken
Girls get soakin' when we walk up (when we walk up)
Everybody frozen when we walk up (when we walk up)
Hearts get broken when we walk up (when we walk up)
Left wrist golden when we walk up
Ex bitch choosing when we walk up (when we walk up)
Everybody frozen when we walk up (when we walk up)
When we walk up, yeah

Peep and Makonnen, everybody know them
Came with your girlfriend, left with your boyfriend
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Peep and Makonnen, everybody know them
Came with your girlfriend, left with your boyfriend
Yeah

(Peep and Makonnen, everybody know them)
(Came with your girlfriend, left with your boyfriend)
(Yeah, yeah)
