		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't know how you met me
You don't know why
You can't turn around
And say goodbye

All you know is when I'm with you
I make you free
And swim through your veins
Like a fish in the sea

I'm singin' follow me
Everything is alright
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night
And if you want to leave I can guarantee
You won't find nobody else like me

I'm not worried
'Bout the ring you wear
'Cause as long as no one knows
Then nobody can care

You're feelin' guilty
And I'm well aware
But you don't look ashamed
And baby I'm not scared

I'm singin' follow me
Everything is alright
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night
And if you want to leave I can guarantee
You won't find nobody else like me

Won't give you money
I can't give you the sky
You're better off if you don't ask why

I'm not the reason that you go astray
We'll be alright
If you don't ask me to stay

Follow me
Everything is alright
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night
And if you want to leave I can guarantee
You won't find nobody else like me

You don't know how you met me
You don't know why
You can't turn around and
Say goodbye

All you know is when I'm with you
I make you free
And swim through your veins
Like a fish in the sea

I'm singin' follow me
Everything is alright
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night
And if you want to leave I can guarantee
You won't find nobody else like me

I'm singin' follow me
Everything is alright
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night
And if you want to leave I can guarantee
You won't find nobody else like me

I'm singin' follow me
Everything is alright
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night
And if you want to leave I can guarantee
You won't find nobody else like me
