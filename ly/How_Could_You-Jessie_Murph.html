		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You said you were sober
So I let you come over
Your words pulled me closer
But your words fuck me over
I kept on denyin'
So you kept on tryin'
You went too far for closure
Too far fucked me over

I could just lie here, say it's okay
When I wanna rip all the doors off this place
Set it on fire, and just walk away
So I can feel anything else but this weight
'Cause I let you in when I needed space
And you crossed a line when I pushed you away
How could you?
How could you?

Oh, I more than regret you
You've convinced yourself I let you
But a version of me never met you
Never let you in my bedroom
Oh, all those shitty lines and cookie blinds
And cheap red wine stains
Suicide to change my mind
And keep me afraid

You want me to lie here, you say it's okay
When I wanna rip all the doors off this place
You set it on fire, and just walk away
So I can feel anything else but this weight
'Cause I let you in when I needed space
And you crossed a line when I pushed you away
How could you?
How could you?

I once loved a liar
'Cause he knew my name
We rewrite the story
And make me to blame, how could you?
