		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Elected to the show and our freedom never knows
How is who and where to why we fail
Those who are in charge in controlling who we are
When there's nothing we can even fucking do, up rise stronghold

Fight for survival, fighting for your life
We're fighting for the reptiles
Freedom of speech, freedom of lies
They tell us what we want to hear, it happens all the time

Does it mater what the people say, hey
Does it matter to you, who
Does it mater what the people say, hey
What do the people want to do

Feeling no devotion, the final vote is in
People have elected, the incumbent to win
The time is for reprisal, time to incite
'Cause there's nothing we can even fucking do, up rise stronghold

Putting it together and forcing them to fight
Bringing home the reptiles who bled the world dry
Seeing through their speeches and reading through their lies
They show us what we want to see, it happens all the time

Does it mater what the people say, hey
Does it matter to you, who
Does it mater what the people say, hey
And there's nothing you can do

Up rise stronghold

What is the price you'll pay, no need to beg or borrow
Is there a better way will our children see tomorrow
Don't live in yesterday, so take the lead not follow
Forever holiday, we have the final say

Up rise stronghold

Feeling no devotion, the final vote is in
People have elected, the incumbent to win
The time is for reprisal, time to incite
'Cause there's nothing we can even fucking do, up rise stronghold

Fight for survival, fighting for your life
We're fighting for the reptiles
Freedom of speech, freedom of lies
They show us what we want to see, it happens all the time

Does it mater what the people say, hey
Does it matter to you, who
Does it mater what the people say, hey
What do the people want to do
