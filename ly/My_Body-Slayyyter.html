		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, turn the lights down
Tell me, are you here to stay?
Afterparty dancer
Do you even know my name?

I need your love
I need you closer
It's not enough, ah ah
Look in my eyes
Hope you're not leaving
No, not tonight

All that I can do is dance here with you
You know I can't be alone, no

Oh, I know you wanna go
But I need you here to move my body
Oh, I know you wanna go
But I need you here to move my body

Just dance here with me
Just dance here with me

Tell me that you want me
I came out tonight to play
Dance in my reflection
Silver like the kiss you gave, ooh

I need your love
I need you closer
It's not enough, ah ah
Look in my eyes
Hope you're not leaving
No, not tonight

Oh, I know you wanna go
But I need you here to move my body
Oh, I know you wanna go
But I need you here to move my body

Just dance here with me
Just dance here with me

(Dance here with me)
(Dance here with me)
(Dance here with me)
(Dance here with me)

Oh, I know you wanna go
But I need you here to move my body
Oh, I know you wanna go
But I need you here to move my body

Just dance here with me
Just dance here with me
