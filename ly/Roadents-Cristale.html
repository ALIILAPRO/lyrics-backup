Look
Don't matter to them 'bout where we're from (skee)
In the gutters where we belong (skee)
Ain't spend these nights in the game
Just to end up getting stained by a cat named Tom
Ain't forget 'em but they're gone
Both my boys, this shit long (long)
I'm weak every day of the week
But I still tell bro's, "Little bro, stay strong"
Crocodile teeth come Colgate bronze (bap, bap)
What are you on?
There's man that risk their life for the T
My G, don't risk your life for a thong
Fuck ya skunt, bing like bong
I'm on the top, king like Kong
(Get left) get left if you can't move right
That's right, we ain't never gonna move shit wrong

My boydem pickup the leng
Mum told me I better go pickup a pen
We're stuck in these streets, it's all we know
'Til we pick up a knife
Then when young bucks can't get off the road
We're roadents, sutten like mice of men
Shen, yeng, yeng, when, next gen
(Stop coming around) 'round here
'Round here that brotherhood shit
Don't mean nothin' more than ends
I've seen mandem snake their friends
For a dude with a couple of gyal in a Benz
Boy, if the ting you drew ain't a 10
Go back in the field and do it again
(That point) that point didn't count so double it
Trouble in paradise, Skilli go beng
Beng, shen, yeng, uh

The shank just bent (shit)
But the toaster ain't jam
My fam, set Fiyaz to a man like Brent
Told bro, "Watch out there's money on ya head"
Fling stones like Fred
Now the money got spent
I ain't content with the result
My people gonna rise up skengs
Protocol, we have hundred straps
All the boys wan' ride out
And if he's in hideout
Any minute now we gonn' find out, brudda, best mind out
Lef' him inside-out
Tik tok, time out
Ten man taking a 9 out
Don't get catch on a night out
Lights out, wet dat, total wipeout

My boydem pickup the leng
Mum told me I better go pickup a pen
We're stuck in these streets, it's all we know
'Til we pick up a knife
Then when young bucks can't get off the road
We're roadents, sutten like mice of men
Shen, yeng, yeng, when, next gen
'Round here that brotherhood shit
Don't mean nothin' more than ends
I've seen mandem snake their friends
For a dude with a couple of gyal in a Benz
Boy, if the ting you drew ain't a 10
Go back in the field and do it again
That point didn't count so double it
Trouble in paradise, Skilli go
