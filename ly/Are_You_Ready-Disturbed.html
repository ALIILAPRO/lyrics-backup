		<p>
		  Are you ready?
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up

Are you ready now?
For the revolution For too long your power
Has been taken away It's been taken away

Does your heart feel heavy now
Savor the solution
Take those mental shackles off
And throw them away
You've got to get them out of your mind
Don't you let their vision leave you blind

Moving steady now
It's a revelation for so long your
Focus has been taken away
Now you're breaking away

They think they know you but
Here's an education
No they can't control you
Once you've broken away
They're done patrolling your mind
When they're searching for you, they will find
A force they aren't ready for

Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to be strong
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to prove them wrong
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to be turned into someone
Who cannot be preyed upon

That's enough already now
You don't want to take it
All your reservations have been taken away
They've been taken away
So you think you're ready now
For the revolution
Yeah, they can't control you
Once you've broken away
You've got to get them out of your mind
When they stand before you they will find
A force they aren't ready for

Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to be strong
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to prove them wrong
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to be turned into someone
Who cannot be preyed upon

Are you ready?

You got to get them out of your mind
When they stand before you they will find
A force they aren't ready for

Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to be strong
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to prove them wrong
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to be turned into someone
Who cannot be preyed upon

Are you ready?
They aren't ready for us to be strong
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for us to prove them wrong
Are you ready?
Let me know you're ready for you to be turned into people
Who cannot be preyed upon

Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?

You cannot be preyed upon
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
