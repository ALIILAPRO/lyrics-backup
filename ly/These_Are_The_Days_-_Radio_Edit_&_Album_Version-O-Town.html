		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Motel, sitting in the dark, empty rooms like an empty heart
Lovers stop but they never stay,
Don't look back as they drive away 
Maybe I should fix this broken neon light 
Fill the cracks and paint it bright
Then maybe love will stop here tonight 

If she knocks on my door, I'll give her the key
Just one look in her eyes and I know I'll be
Everything she sees in me 
More than I ever thought that I could be 
These are the days 
When all I can do is dream
But I don't wanna spend forever 
Livin' in the in between
I'm stuck here in a place without love 
And I just can't let it play this way 
But for now I'm gonna have to face it
These are the days 

Gotta to use these lonely time 
Change the picture in my frame of mind
Outside the window there's a sunny day
I wanna feel it on my face 
You and I, we're out here looking for the same thing
And end to all the wondering
Waitin' for someone to share this feelin'

If she knocks on my door, I'll give her the key
Just one look in her eyes and I know I'll be
Everything she sees in me 
More than I ever thought that I could be 
These are the days 
When all I can do is dream
But I don't wanna spend forever 
Livin' in the in between
I'm stuck here in a place without love 
And I just can't let it play this way 
But for now I'm gonna have to face it
These are the days 
These are the days between the hopes and fears 
These are the moments that are still unclear
When it's still uncertain if she will appear 
I'm here, even I like it or not, this is what I got
