		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Raa
As I breath
I can feel a faint emotion in my lungs
And not mine
Empathy has screamed it's name
As I dream
All this energy has formed itself a face
It watches me
Colours came out from grey

Cautiously
We find the space
Where others run to hide
Peering through the walls we see
A curious mind
We need to accept the fact that is
We don't know everything
And the ones
Who have learned this
Tend to see
Answers
Deep within your skin
Where you can never gaze
I Am One

When I can feel
Strangers around me
Frozen still
From all of their pain
I feel helpless
I Feel them here
When They're motionless
But that won't change
The fact I can be
Someone who can save everybody still
Now that I know
I'm not helpless
When they're motionless

Countering the thoughts of this time bomb
Ticking down, close my eyes and
Breath
I can
Beat
This
Fucking thing
Heightened sense of empathy, a slight burden
But I'll perceive it as a gift to help the lost

We've become the ones
To help guide this world away from the grey
Use the gift they gave
A strange power
Light from empathy
We
Are
One

When I can feel
Strangers around me
Frozen still
From all of their pain
I feel helpless
I feel them here
When They're motionless
But that won't change
The fact I can be
Someone who can save everybody still
Now that I know
I'm not helpless
When they're motionless

It's not in our thoughts
It's not in our bones
It's in our hearts
And stems from the soul
Every life we touch
Benefits our own
Lead life with love
And you'll never be alone
It's not in our thoughts
It's not in our bones
It's in our hearts
And stems from the soul
Every life we touch
Benefits our own
Lead life with love
And you'll never be alone

It's not in our thoughts
It's not in our bones
It's in our hearts
And stems from the soul
Every life we touch
Benefits our own
Lead life with love
And you'll never be alone
