		<p>
		  Bong-bong-bong (we good, we good, we good?)
Bong-bong-bong-bong-bong (like a drum)
Bong-bong-bong-bong-bong-bong-bong (haha, this is fire)

Nigga, eat this ass like a plum (plum)
This pussy tight like a nun (nun)
Better chew it up like it's gum (gum)
Then wipe your mouth when you done (okay)
I'm hot like Nevada, pussy get popped, Piñata
Bitch, I look like money (like money)
You could print my face on a dollar
Beat it up
Beat it up
Beat it up
Beat it up
Okay

Five, four, three, two, one, lift off
Honey, I'm home, shoes gettin' kicked off (uh)
Every time I turn around, a bitch pissed off (ah-ha)
Little dusty ass hoes need a lint brush (woo)
You gon' settle down, you gon' live with him (what?)
I don't even wanna post a pic with him (no)
The bag he just bought me was a Goyard (Goyard)
That ain't yo' nigga, he is both ours

Pussy tight like a nun (nun)
Countin' hundreds up with my thumb (thumb)
I don't care where you from (from)
Better beat this shit like a drum (okurr)
Don't be talkin' shit like you know me (woo)
I ride dick like a pony
Girl, that nigga look like a brokey
(Real hot girl shit)
Go and fuck with his homie, he a- (ah)

This ass sit like a stallion, all these wannabes my lil' ponies
These hoes camped out in the comments, always talkin' like they know me (ayy)
Thick bitches in a black truck, packed in
Eat whoever in my way, Ms. Pacman
Hermes, made a real big purchase
Purse so big, had to treat it like a person
Bad bitch (bad bitch) in real life (in real life)
Show me real love, give a fuck about them likes ('bout them likes)
Bitch tryna say I ain't fine? Oh, alright
They know I'm thick like I'm eatin' beans with the rice
Like lean over ice, got the real meat pies
I be spillin' like my ass, out these jeans when they tight
And the way they watch me, need to be monetized (ah)
I'ma need a money bag if I sleep overnight
Wait, wait, wait (hold up)
Wait, wait (hold up)
Hoes pop pills, but I'm the one they can't take (yeah)
Hot girl shit, I'ma make somethin' shake
I know the stiff hoes can't relate (ah)

Shoot your shot like a free throw
Just know this pussy ain't free though
My BD is a Migo
Bitch, your BD is a zero
My back shots sound like bongos
I ain't scared to admit, I'm a freak ho
At least I'm gettin' my money
Y'all hoes broke, pussy took more turns than a keyhole

It did
Like a bum
I'ma throw it back like it's Thursday
I got cake, I'm lit, it's my birthday (ah)

Look
I don't ride on my knees, bitch, I ride on my toes
Big fat ass, it be eatin' up the thong
Gotta garage full of foreign cars that I never drove
A bitch couldn't school me with a student loan

I'm so sexy, I could Met Gala in a robe
I could body every look and I could body every pose (yes)
Neck full of diamonds, yeah, I'm forever froze
Will Cardi ever fall off? Bitch, we'll never know (whoa)

Beat it up
Wait

Bitch, I'm hot (hot), like Nevada ('vada)
Pussy get popped, Piñata (bap)
Lookin', like money (cold)
You could print my face on a dollar (okay)
This pussy, Dominicana
This pussy, Americana (ayy)
Si tu quiere que te toma toma
Bought a couple cribs on my own, I'm a owner

Beat it up
Real hot girl shit
La Cardi (ah)
