		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I calling you up 'cause I'm missing you
I don't even know what I'm gonna do
I say I don't care, that's not the truth
Yeah, I'm still in love with you

And I know all your friends, they hate me too
I wish that I was better at the things I do
I say I don't care, that's not the truth
Yeah, I'm still not over you

I been calling you up 'cause I'm missing you
I don't even know what I'm gonna do
I say I don't care, that's not the truth
Yeah, I'm still in love with you

And I know all your friends, they hate me too
I wish that I was better at the things I do
I say I don't care, that's not the truth
Yeah, I'm still not over you

It's been two years since I last saw you
Still wish that I run into you
'Cause I know that you're still in our hometown
And maybe you never wanna see me
And I understand if you don't want to
But I will never forget you (I will never forget you)

I been calling you up 'cause I'm missing you
I don't even know what I'm gonna do
I say I don't care, that's not the truth
Yeah, I'm still in love with you

And I know all your friends, they hate me too
I wish that I was better at the things I do
I say I don't care, that's not the truth
Yeah, I'm still not over you

I been calling you up 'cause I'm missing you
I don't even know what I'm gonna do
I say I don't care, that's not the truth
Yeah, I'm still in love with you (in love with you)
