		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a chance you will be there
I'd like to know the truth
I'll find it out somehow
The chances aren't too strong
A chance you will be there

Please be there alone
Help me speak of love
Chances aren't enough
Ones too good to miss
Chances aren't too strong
A Chance is all there is

There's a chance you will be there
Wondering what to do
How to play my role
I'll leave it up to you

If I disguise my smile
It gives too much away
What if we can't speak
What then shall I say

Don't you be too long
Something has gone wrong 
The chances are all gone
[Repeat]
