		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Life is just a bowl of cherry
Sometimes it is sweet or filled with worries
Don't be afraid
When things go wrong, just be strong

When things seems up in the air
And everything is so unfair
And you stumble and fall
Just pick yourself up and sing

If one day you lose your way
Just remember one thing, my friend
When you're under a cloud
Just visit music and sing

If one day you lose your way
Just remember that I'm here to stay
Don't you give up
Keep your chin up and be happy

Life is just a bowl of cherry
Sometimes it is sweet or filled with worries
Don't be afraid
When things go wrong, just be strong

When things seems up in the air
And everything is so unfair
And you stumble and fall
Just pick yourself up and sing

If one day you lose your way
Just remember one thing, my friend
When you're under a cloud
Just visit music and sing

If one day you lose your way
Just remember one thing, my friend
When you're under a cloud
Just visit music and dance

If one day you lose your way
Just remember that I'm here to stay
Don't you give up, keep your chin up
Don't you give up, keep your chin up
Keep your chin up and be happy
