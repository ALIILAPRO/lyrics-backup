		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Caricatures
Of your wrecking ball gown
In my mind
All the time
I wanna be in that
Damsel-patterned alley
Where you go
For a smoke
And sorrow slow dances
The phones are lightin' up 
Takin' no chances
Close but never close enough

Been watching cowboy films
On gloomy afternoons
Tinting the solitude
Put on your dancing shoes
And show me what to do
I know you've got the moves

All my own stunts
High noon has changed its tune 
Linkin' arms
Sinkin' hearts
And sorrow slow dances
Around the edges of her eyes
Takin' no chances
The last one out to win a prize

Been watching cowboy films
On gloomy afternoons
Tinting the solitude
Put on your dancing shoes
And show me what to do
I know you've got the moves

Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
