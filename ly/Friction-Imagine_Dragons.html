		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get down with the victim
We both know you need them
You're stuck in the middle
Of all irrelevance
And your heart is beating
'Cause you know that you gotta
Get out of the middle
And rise to the top now

When you've made it
Won't ya tell me what to do
'Cause I'm playin' it all wrong
When you made it, when you made it
Won't ya tell me what to do
'Cause I'm playin' it all wrong

You can't fight the friction
So ease it off
Can't take the pressure
So ease it off
Don't tell me to be strong
Ease it off
You can't fight the friction
So ease it off

And get into the system
We both know you need one
The tip of the needle
Is taking over you
And your heart is beating

'Cause you know that you gotta
Get out of the middle
And rise to the top now

When you've made it
Won't ya tell me what to do
'Cause I'm playin' it all wrong
When you made it, when you made it
Won't ya tell me what to do
'Cause I'm playin' it all wrong

You can't fight the friction
So ease it off
Can't take the pressure
So ease it off
Don't tell me to be strong
Ease it off
You can't fight the friction
So ease it off

Oh why can't you let go
Like a bird in the snow
This is no place to build your home

You can't fight the friction
So ease it off
Can't take the pressure
So ease it off
Don't tell me to be strong
Ease it off
You can't fight the friction
So yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
