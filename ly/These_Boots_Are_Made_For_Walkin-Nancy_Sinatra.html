		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, baby, sign my contract on love
Baby, baby, sign my contract on love
Baby, baby, sign my contract on love
Baby, baby
Sign it, sign it
Woo (sign it, sign it)

You say you love me
And I believe it's true
But before I let myself go
Here's what you've got to do

(Sign it, sign it)
(Sign it, sign it)
You've got to sign (you, you, you'd better sign it)
My contract on love (you, you, you'd better sign it)
Write it in your heart (you, you, you'd better sign it)
That you'll never do anything to ever make us part
(Sign it, sign it)
(Sign it, sign it) Yeah

I know it may seem strange to you
Yeah, but I've lost a love so many times before
Yeah, and now that I know the score
No one's gonna hurt me no more
And I'm takin' all my chances with romances

(Sign it, sign it) Yeah
(Sign it, sign it)

So just sign (you, you, you'd better sign it)
Right here on this dotted line (you, you, you'd better sign it)
Where it says you'll be mine, all mine (you, you, you'd better sign it)
Until the end of time
(Sign it, sign it)
(Sign it, sign it) So come on, come on, come on, and

Sign, yeah (baby, baby, sign my contract on love)
Sign, yeah (baby, baby, sign my contract on love)
Sign, right here on this line (baby, baby, sign my contract on love)

(Sign it, sign it) Yeah
(Sign it, sign it)

Sign, yeah (baby, baby, sign my contract on love)
Sign, yeah (baby, baby, sign my contract on love)
Sign (baby, baby, sign my contract on love)
