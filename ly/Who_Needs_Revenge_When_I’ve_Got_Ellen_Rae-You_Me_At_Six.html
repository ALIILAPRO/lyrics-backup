		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're my heaven, you're my cure
Not from this planet, never felt like this before
Who needs revenge when you're my girl?
Sure, it's sweet but it never helps

She's the broken one
But says that I need fixing
Tell me, who are you kidding?
The past had tried to follow me
What was it thinking?
Showing up like that and

Don't worry about me, I'm doing fine
You couldn't hurt my feelings if you tried
And I guess, I should've known better when
You said you could never pretend

You're so last summer, that's for sure
You're so vain, that's what you're known for
Who needs revenge, Ellen Rae's my girl
Seen better days, you did this to yourself

She's the broken one
But says that I need fixing
Tell me, who are you kidding?
The past had tried to follow me
What was it thinking?
Showing up like that and

Don't worry about me, I'm doing fine
You couldn't hurt my feelings if you tried
And I guess, I should've known better when
You said you could never pretend

Lighting a match just to watch things burn
It didn't catch fire, you'll never learn
What a mess, knowing what I know now
I'd hate to see you around

You're so last summer (I should've known better when)
So last summer (you said you could never pretend)
You're so last summer (I'd hate, I'd hate to see you around)

Don't worry about me, I'm doing fine
You couldn't hurt my feelings if you tried
And I guess, I should've known better when
You said you could never pretend

Lighting a match just to watch things burn
It didn't catch fire, you'll never learn
What a mess, knowing what I know now
I'd hate to see you around
