		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond

Find light in the beautiful sea
I choose to be happy you and I, you and I
We're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh, right away
At first sight, I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So shine bright, tonight, you and I
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond (Shine bright)
Shine bright like a diamond (Shine bright)
Shinin' bright like a diamond
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond (Shine bright)
Shine bright like a diamond (Shine bright)
Shinin' bright like a diamond
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky

Palms rise to the universe as
We moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth, we'll never die
We're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, yeah, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

At first sight, I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So shine bright, tonight, you and I
(You and I)
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive (Eye to eye)
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky

(Shine bright) Shine bright like
A diamond (Woah)
(Shine bright) Shine bright like
A diamond (Woah)
Shinin' bright like a diamond
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky
(diamonds in the sky)
Shine bright like a diamond (Woah)
Shine bright like a diamond (yeah, yeah)
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond (O oh)
Shine bright like a diamond, oh yeah

Tonight, you and I (yeah, yeah)
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive (So alive)
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky

(Shine bright) Shine bright like
A diamond (Shine bright)
(Shine bright) Shine bright like
A diamond (Shine bright)
Shine bright like a diamond
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond (Woah)
Shine bright like a diamond (Woah)
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky
