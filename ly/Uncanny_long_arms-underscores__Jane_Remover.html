		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I had this crazy dream that I got my head stuck at the top of the stairs
I swear I could've put myself to sleep had I not been calling for help
And in the morning I saw myself in the mirror 
And my hands were in a different place than where they started

I can touch my to-o-es (oh)
Without bending o-o-over (oh, what is happening to me)
What is happening to me?
What is happening to me?
(Woah-o-oh)
(Woah-o-oh)
(Woah-o-oh)

And I had this crazy feeling that nothing was out of reach anymore (anymore)
And I had a terrible feeling I could touch you from over here
And I thought it would be too fucked to be true
But I woke up and I felt my hands all on the carpet

I can touch my to-o-es (oh)
Without bending o-o-over
What is happening to me?
What is happening to me?
What is happening to me?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

And in just a couple seconds of breathing in and out
I was exiled from the heavens and flung toward the ground
I once had peace and quiet, now I can't turn the damn thing off
But I don't wanna die yet, I haven't finished what I'm working on
(Good luck)

Several hidden shots to the chest
How did you get everyone to think that you were depressed?
Tell me if it's not on purpose, why'd you do it again?
Just admit it, you don't have a world that you're up against
