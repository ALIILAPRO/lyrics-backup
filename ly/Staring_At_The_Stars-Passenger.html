		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tobacco stains our yellow teeth
And all our fingers and underneath
Our fingernails, that clasp on sheets
As we try desperately to sleep

Hearts are sad and eyes are tired
And all this Red Bull keeps us wired
Gives us wings
It gives us rings around our eyes

We put three sugars in our tea
Sit to watch too much day time TV
And laugh at mums
Who don't know who the father is

And all our girlfriends are long gone
We watch too much internet porn
Who needs love
When you've got silicone and strap ons

And beer bloats our spoiled guts
And shit jobs keep us in ruts
And keep us eying up
The what's and ifs and buts and maybes

And falling over in the street
Is just a part of every week
And we lie drunkenly
Just staring at the stars

Remember when they were in reach
And all the teachers used to teach
You can do anything
If you put your mind to it

We put our minds to it all
But disappointment crashed the ball
We could have done anything
But we just never quite knew it

So tie your scarf on tight
It's to be a cold night
Tie your scarf on tight
It's to be a cold night

And tie your scarf on tight
It's to be a cold night
And tie your scarf on tight
It's to be a cold night

Oh oh, so tie your scarf on tight
It's to be a cold night
And tie your scarf on tight
It's to be a cold night
