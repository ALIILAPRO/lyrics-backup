		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You took all the lonely days and you made them sing
You turned off the alarms so they don't ring
I don't know where we are in the grand scheme of things
But I just want to be counting stars with you

Life did throw everything that it could throw
Your face in the morning, it just glowed
Let's get in this car, let's face the sky and go
I just wanna be counting stars with you

Rap it up and let's go rolling down
There's no funnier duo in this town
Just want to say I'm better now and shout it loud
I just want to be hugging you tonight

Don't know if you know, but I just wanna tell you so
That you're the wisest funny one that I will ever, ever know
A hundred mini dreams and a healing scar
The secrets of the day are never far
I don't know where we're going but God it's a start
I just wanna be counting stars with you

I don't know if you know, but I just wanna tell you so
That you're the wisest funny one that I will ever, ever know
I don't know about you but, oh, I love us as a two
Find me a wild road and I will name it after you

You took all the lonely days and made them sing
You turned off the alarms so they don't ring
I don't know where we are in the grand scheme of things
But I just wanna be hugging you tonight
