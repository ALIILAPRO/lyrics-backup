		  What a waste of a pretty face
What a waste, that face, that face, what a waste
What a waste of a pretty face
That face, what a waste, that face, that face

What a waste of a pretty face
What a waste, that face, that face, what a waste
What a waste of a pretty face
That face, what a waste, that face, that face

Will you want me when I'm old and dead?

What a waste of a pretty face
What a waste, that face, that face, what a waste
What a waste of a pretty face
That face, what a waste, that face, that face

Living like this is not easy
Don't do what I should
I'm too cheap for you to own me
No one ever could

Will you want me when I'm old and dead?

What a waste of a pretty face
What a waste, that face, that face, what a waste
What a waste of a pretty face
That face, what a waste, that face, that face

All the clever ones are lonely
Funny ones are dead
Won't wear white and don't do dinner
Try a bitch instead

Will you want me when I'm old and dead?

What a waste of a pretty face
What a waste, that face, that face, what a waste
What a waste of a pretty face
That face, what a waste, that face, that face
(When I'm old and dead)

What a waste of a pretty face
What a waste, that face, that face, what a waste
What a waste of a pretty face
That face, what a waste, that face, that face
(When I'm old and dead)

(When I'm old and dead)
