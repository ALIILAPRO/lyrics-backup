		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, uh

Is it all about love
Is it all about trust
Is it all about the party
Is it all about drugs
Is it all about you, you, you
I love everything you do, do
Is it all about the view
Is it all about love
Is it all about trust
Is it all about the buzz
Every little thing you do, do, do
Feels like it's about you, you, you
Yeah (yeah)

My load is heavy, let's keep it light (let's keep it light)
I just been doing the shit I like (I like)
She said I sound new, it's a different Mike
Let's save that shit for a different night
My ex said I'm runnin', well, bitch, I might be (bitch, I might be)
Can't keep me in check like a fuckin' knight
But I did a deal for some fuckin' Nikes
Nothing I said is a fuckin' lie (not one, nah)
Check my whole catalog, you won't find one
Not one lie one time

It's love for my brothers, got none for these bitches
And all I've been saying is gang gang
I'm sick and tired of being 'round people
That don't even care 'bout the same things
I turned these dollars I got into millis
Now no one can tell me a damn thing
Came up on some change, but 'ain't nothing changed
Yeah, I'm runnin' 'round with the same gang

Is it all about love
Is it all about us
Is it all about the party
Is it all about drugs
Is it all about you, you, you
Feels like it's about you, you, you
Is it all about the crew
Or about the who's who
And it's quarter past two
Skinny dippin' in the pool
What the fuck did you do, do, do
Why's it all about you, you, you

My phone been jumpin' like every night
If I would drop it, I'd better fly
I don't feel nothing, I'm better off
They throwing stones, I just let it rock
There's only one I like I'm Fetty Wap
I will not stop 'til confetti drop
With a heavy heart, ready or not
Ready or not, ayy

It's love for my brothers, got none for these bitches
And all I've been saying is gang gang
I'm sick and tired of being 'round people
That don't even care 'bout the same things
I turned these dollars I got into millis
Now no one can tell me a damn thing
Came up on some change, but 'ain't nothing changed
Yeah, I'm runnin' 'round with the same gang (gang)
