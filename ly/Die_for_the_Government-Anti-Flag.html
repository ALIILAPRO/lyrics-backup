		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've gotta die, gotta die
Gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit
You've gotta die, gotta die
Gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit
There's a gulf war vet, dying a slow
Cold death and the government says
"We don't know the source of his sickness"
But don't believe what they say
Because your government is lying
They've done it before and don't you
Know they'll do it again
A secret test, government built virus
Subject test group gulf battle field troops
You've gotta die, gotta die
Gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit
You've gotta die, gotta die
Gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit
First world war veterans slaughtered
By General Eisenhower
You give them your life
They give you a stab in the back
Radiation, agent orange, tested on us souls
Guinea pigs for western corporations
I never have, I never will
Pledge allegiance to their flag
You're getting used, you'll end up dead
You've gotta die, gotta die
Gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit
You've gotta die, gotta die
Gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit
I don't need you to tell me what to do
And I don't need you to tell me what to be
Fuck you
I don't need you to tell me what to say
And I don't need you to tell me
What to think! What to think
What to think, what to think
What to think, think, think, think
You've gotta die, gotta die
Gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit
