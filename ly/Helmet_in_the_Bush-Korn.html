		  Hello? ¿Está Caco?
¿Eres Caco?
Pues, you know, you fuckin' call me tha Caco, okay?

I keep asking, "What's your lie?"
It is disturbing, this eases my mind (why)
Days keep passing, one notch at a time (me)
I don't feel right, please, God, let me sleep tonight

Every day confronted, so called friends giving in
I just wanna know why

Want to give it up, no, I can't escape
Want to give it up, no, I can't escape
Want to give it up, no, I can't escape
Want to give it up, no, I can't escape

I keep asking you again, "Please try"
It is haunting, this takes my mind (why)
Days keep passing, line after line (me)
I don't feel right, please, God, don't let me die tonight
Die tonight
Die tonight
Die tonight

Every day confronted, so-called friends giving in
I just wanna know why

Want to give it up, no, I can't escape
Want to give it up, no, I can't escape
Want to give it up, no, I can't escape
Want to give it up, no, I can't escape

Please, God
Please, God
Please, God, help me
Please, God, free me
Please, God, help me 
From my painful situation

Please, God, help me
Please, God, free me
Please, God, save me 
From my painful situation

Please, God, help me (want to give it up, no, I can't escape)
Please, God, free me (want to give it up, no, I can't escape)
Please, God, save me (want to give it up, no, I can't escape)
From my painful situation (want to give it up, no, I can't escape)

Please, God, don't let me give in tonight, please God, oh
Please, God, don't let me give in tonight, please God, oh
Please, God, don't let me give in tonight, don't let me die
Please, God, don't let me give in tonight, don't let me die
