		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She moves like she don't care
Smooth as silk, cool as air
Ooh, it makes you wanna cry

She doesn't know your name and your heart beats like a subway train
Ooh, it makes you wanna die

Ooh, don't you wanna take her?
Wanna make her all your own?

Maria
You've gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Latina
Ave maria
A million and one candle lights

I've seen this thing before
In my best friend and the boy next door
Fool for love and fool of fire

Won't come in from the rain
She's oceans running down the drain
Blue as ice and desire

Don't you wanna make her?
Ooh, don't you wanna take her home?

Maria
You've gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Regina
Ave maria
A million and one candle lights

Ooh, don't you wanna break her?
Ooh, don't you wanna take her home?

She walks like she don't care
Walking on imported air
Ooh, it makes you wanna die

Maria
You've gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Regina
Ave maria
A million and one candle lights

Maria
You've gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Regina
Ave maria
A million and one candle lights

Maria
You've gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Regina
Ave maria
A million and one candle lights
