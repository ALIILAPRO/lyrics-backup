		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  take heed
it's getting warm
pay heed
to the alarm
take heed
you'll be disarmed
pay heed
time has come

hey mate, this ain't going away
death before surrender
wipe your slate clean

take heed
it's getting warm
pay heed
to the alarm
take heed
you'll be disarmed
pay heed
time has come

hey mate, this ain't going away
listen to the wise old men
listen to what they've said
from the beginning
over and over again

dont act as if you were 
unaware of what lies ahead
squeeze the last drop, lick it up
grow a better crop, use it up
weve had time to develop the plot
and to plan our new home
a new colony
prepare for departure

cities of sand
under glass 
this is our new civilisation
and the sun always shines
bright
