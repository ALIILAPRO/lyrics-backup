		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Chicken wing, chicken wing, hot dog and bologna 
Chicken and macaroni, chillin' with my homies (It's Great John beats baby)
Chicken-chicken wing, chicken wing, hot dog and bologna (Great John on the beat by the way)
I'm doing shit you imagine, ayy (chicken and macaroni, chillin' with my homies)
I used to trap, flip, we doin' shit you imagine, ayy

I used to trap, flip, we doin' shit you imagine, ayy
Ran up at Saks Fifth, I spent a brick on the fashion
My body different, that's all she could say when we kick it
I just seen the opps, had them dodgin' and dippin'
Popped a Perc' and that shit had me trippin', ayy
Run up (run up), ayy, I get you done up
I ain't trustin' a soul, that's a set up
Told lil' bro let off shots, never let up
If they slip then we slide, get wet up
You ain't really outside, then shut up
No, you can't sit with the gang, gotta get up
Pull up with gang, we got fifty or better, ayy
Fuck around make it hot in December
I know my heart cold, I was born in the winter
And this ice on my neck make 'em shiver
Told lil' mama come fuck with a winner
Had my shooters pull up in the sprinter
Boy, you food and we lookin' for dinner
They can't see in this whip 'cause it's tinted 
I'm smokin' on dope, this is not for beginners, ayy

We gettin' chicken, chicken
That's the reason why she's splittin', lickin', ayy
You know they don't love you, ayy
They just tryna get the riches, ayy
Get it (huh), flip it, if he talkin' down I'ma lift it
Niggas participatin' in snitchin' 
You can't take the heat better get out the kitchen

Ain't no contemplatin', get to clickin'
You know I'm picky, don't know who I'm pickin'
(Sleepy why you outside of this club?)
'Cause they said we can't get the grip in
No feelin', John gon' cook up the beat, I'ma kill it
I can't fuck with the fake, I'm the realest
Big E-B-K, shoot your shot, then we dippin'
Ayy, boy we steppin'
If he move incorrect, I correct him
He get popped like a cork when we test him
Rap with the opps, we throw shots at the session
Ayy, that suppresser
Rubber band on the clip, I'ma stretch him
Rubber band on the brick when I check in
Drop me the addy, I bet I address him
Ayy, never stressin'
Just make sure that I get all my credit
We shoot bullets like butter, we spread it
All over blocks at the opps 'til we bloody
Ayy, never said it
Choppa burn him like Usher, I let it
If he beef with the gang, ain't no dead it
It ain't no peace with the gang, that's a lesson, ayy, ayy

We getting chicken, chicken
That's the reason why she's splittin', lickin', ayy
You know they don't love you, ayy
They just tryna get the riches, ayy
Get it (huh), flip it, if he talkin' down I'ma lift it
Niggas participatin' in snitchin'
You can't take the heat better get out the kitchen

Chicken wing, chicken wing, hot dog and bologna 
Chicken and macaroni, chillin' with my homies 
Chicken-chicken wing, chicken wing, hot dog and bologna 
Chicken and macaroni, chillin' with my homies
Chicken-
