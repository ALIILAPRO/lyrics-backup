		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oouu
Oouu that drink raw
Pass me a lighter man
Aye I'm in the booth right now right
And I look around and I finally realize
That I done turned myself to a motherfucking self made millionaire you digg
Everybody love me except for one group of bitch ass niggas
Aye don't play with me, play with your bitch
Let's go

Don't play with me, play with your bitch
Young nigga on some multi million dollar shit
Fur coat, half a million worth of ice on
I'm lit up like a nigga cut the Christmas lights on
Why the fuck do you be so fresh Dolph?
Why you keep your foot on these niggas neck Dolph?
'Cause we at the top, but we really from the bottom
Tell that pussy fuck 'em and that's how I feel about 'em
Heard your intro your last two mixtapes
I hear you slick dissin' but that shit lame
All that make believe rappin' about cocaine
Don't play with me Ho Gotti you a hoe mane
You went from my biggest fan, to my biggest hater
Begging me to sign with you, but I had too much paper
Still that same nigga that used to front your big brother
Found that he a bitch too now I call him your big sister (Bitch)
You still that same nigga that was beefin' with a dyke (But you a gangsta tho?)
I cannot take you serious (Aight)
They said them pussy niggas on your team iron your draws
They say you make them pussy ass niggas call you "Boss"
But they can't call you King (Why?)
Because that's Dolph
I can't drink all that two liter, because that's raw
The streets ours
That new 488 came with a lot of power
My lil niggas begging me to let them send some scattered showers
Don't play with me, play with your bitch
Matter fact when I fucked her she told me you a bitch
And tell that old nigga from my hood with you that he a bitch
You make the city look bad, that's the truth
Fuck nigga I be in North Memphis more than you
I shot my first twenty videos in my hood
You a pussy I heard they never see you in your hood
Nigga quit playin'
Ten M's up, what the fuck, I'm just sayin'
Oh you must be mad 'cause they call Memphis Dolphland
I'm at the Super Bowl my money on the Falcons
Aye you big head motherfucker
Why you hatin' so much?
Oh I forgot you came up rappin' dissin' Three 6 Mafia
Stop slick dissin' and dodgin' me nigga let's get it poppin'
Ole pussy ass nigga
Ole pussy ass nigga
Was talking 'bout me in your song "Pride To The Side"
Found my number in her phone and it hurt your pride (I'm sorry bro)
You found my number in her phone and it hurt your pride
When they hear this shit, they gon' play it five times
Got a lot of foreign cars, that I get too high to drive
Don't play with me, play with your bitch
Don't play with me, play with your bitch

So, so I told myself a long time ago right
I said "I ain't gonna expose this pussy ass nigga man, 'cause we from the same city"
You know, and your whole pussy ass team know nigga
I've been sparing your bitch ass for the past 5 years nigga
You know that shit man, come on man
CM who?
CMF
The Cocaine Musik Faggots
I know, you know, the whole motherfuckin' city know
You's a bitch
Don't play with me man, play with your bitch
This ain what you want
I'm the same lil nigga bro, that was helping your big pussy ass brother put food on his table when you wasn't fucking with him bro
Put it like this, aye yo
You was ridin' in the city beefin' with a dyke my nigga
I don't know no gangsters that beef with motherfuckin' dykes, my nigga
That motherfucking song that touched down, "Reload It"
All that shit, whatever the fuck it was nigga
Nigga you was talkin' 'bout a dyke nigga
Nigga you was beefin' with a dyke out there in North Memphis where you from nigga
Nigga you a bitch nigga
Ho Gotti I'm disappointed in you man
Stay in your place homie, you know what's up with me
Tell your fat ass big brother man I said he a bitch too
Matter fact your big sister
Tell your fat ass big sister that I said he a bitch too
Ya'mean?
Aye you's a bitch nigga
The whole city know that, streets know that
Stay out my way fuck nigga
Aye, young nigga, self made, rich shit, fast cars, fast bitches, yeah
