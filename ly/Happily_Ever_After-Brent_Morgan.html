		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ready to begin, let the wonder take hold
Feel it draw you in, watch the moment unfold
Spark a dream that we're meant to follow

Setting out for a new tomorrow
Every step we take, brings a new hope, a new day
Every choice we make helps us find our own way
Every wish finally put into motion
Diving in with our hearts wide open

The story comes alive, when we look inside
c new adventure there in your eyes
There in your eyes
It's just beginning
Feel your heart beat faster
Reach out and find your happily ever after
Find your happily ever after

Now we're on our way
Leave our fears behind us
Not so far away from the dreams that live inside us
Moving down this road we've chosen
There's no limit to where we're going

The story comes alive, when we look inside
c new adventure there in your eyes
There in your eyes
It's just beginning
Feel your heart beat faster
Reach out and find your happily ever after
Find your happily ever after

The battles, the stories, the losses and all the glories
We're changed by the way we live every day
Just look up and reach to the sky
We all have the courage to fly

The story comes alive, when we look inside
c new adventure there in your eyes
There in your eyes
It's just beginning
Feel your heart beat faster
Reach out and find your happily ever after
Find your happily ever after
