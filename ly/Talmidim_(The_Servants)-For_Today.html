		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lord of glory, make us worthy to possess your name 
Lord of glory, make us worthy to possess your name 
And give us a new name 
And call us your people, God 
And give us a new name

I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you
I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh 
And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees
And be careful to keep my laws 
You will live in the land I gave to your forefathers
you will be my people and I will be your God

Lord of glory, make us worthy to possess your name 
Lord of glory, make us worthy to possess your name 
And give us a new name 
And call us your people, God 
And give us a new name

Lord of glory, make us worthy to possess your name 
Lord of glory, make us worthy to possess your name
Lord of glory, make us worthy to possess your name 
Lord of glory, make us worthy to possess your name 
Lord of glory, make us worthy to possess your name 
Lord of glory, make us worthy to possess your name
