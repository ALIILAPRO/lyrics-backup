		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuck you! Fuck them and fuck the world too
Do I look like some bitch to you! 
I'll bet a blackened eye that you'll remember my name
Well shorty step right back and get out of my face and my way! 
You turn my hard heart cold, stealing what we earned and call it "Rock and Roll"
I'll bet our 2 cents an hour and all the hurt in the world that you all will burn! 

Hey! 
This is the Fight Song
Don't point your finger at me! 
Pray for that God forgives I Don't
Hey! 
This is the Fight Song, no matter where you're from
Pray for that God forgives I Don't! 

Listen! You make this bad blood rise
Hand me some rope 'cause I'll be hanging around hearing blacktounge bitchin
For hours on end
Come on gimme a break and drop fucking! 
Now! Let's keep it honest in here
I don't know you so you sure don't know me
So keep my name out of your mouth and we can 
keep it the same just like the doctor said

Hey! 
This is the Fight Song
Don't point your finger at me! 
Pray for that God forgives I Don't
Hey! 
This is the Fight Song, no matter where you're from
Pray for that God forgives I Don't! 

Hey! 
This is the Fight Song
Don't point your finger at me! 
Pray for that God forgives I Don't
Hey! 
This is the Fight Song, no matter where you're from
Pray for that God forgives I Don't! 
No matter where you're from
Don't point at me, you hear?
God forgives I Don't! 
(This is the Fight Song!)
(This is the Fight Song!)
(This is the Fight Song!)
