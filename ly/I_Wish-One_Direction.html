		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Na na na na na)
(Na na na na na)

He takes your hand, I die a little
I watch your eyes and I'm in riddles
Why can't you look at me like that?

(Na na na na na)

When you walk by, I try to say it
But then I freeze, and never do it
My tongue gets tied, the words get trapped (Trapped)
I hear the beat of my heart getting louder, whenever I'm near you

But I see you
With him slow dancing
Tearing me apart 'cause you don't see
Whenever you
Kiss him, I'm breaking,
Oh how I wish that was me

(Na na na na na)
(Na na na na na)

He looks at you, the way that I would
Does all the things, I know that I could
If only time, could just turn back
'Cause I got three little words that I've always been dying to tell you

But I see you
With him slow dancing
Tearing me apart 'cause you don't see
Whenever you
Kiss him, I'm breaking,
Oh how I wish that was me

With my hands on your waist, while we dance in the moonlight
I wish it was me, that you'll call later on 'cause you wanna say good night

'Cause I see you
With him slow dancing
Tearing me apart 'cause you don't see

But I see you
With him slow dancing
Tearing me apart 'cause you don't see
Whenever you
Kiss him, I'm breaking,
Oh how I wish
Oh how I wish
Oh how I wish, that was me

Oh how I wish, that was me
