		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tired of being rescued 'cause it's just a gilded cage
I must make amends for all the mess my elders made
I was born to lead you all away from your crusade
Nations held in anguish had me boiling with a rage

Ordinary life alluded me
For my duty, you are losing me
You are one of my few weaknesses
But this girl has deep allegiances
In the meantime, the shields are down
I'm in a spacial place
Survivor

Can you see my frozen dream?
My frozen dream can never be
It is a paradox, you see such a frozen dream
Such a frozen dream can never be, never be

Waited for a century, it's only gotten worse
People want to stop me when I try to lift the curse
We are isolated and in close proximity
Sisters and our brothers living in this galaxy

Ordinary life alluded me
Was it worth it just for saving me?
You are one of my few weaknesses
But this girl has deep allegiances
In the meantime, the shields are down
I'm in a spacial place
Survivor

Can you see my frozen dream?
My frozen dream can never be
It is a paradox, you see such a frozen dream
Such a frozen dream can never pass
This event horizon
We've such a golden dream
Such a golden dream can never last
My burden lifted
I am free, such a foolish dream
Such a foolish dream can never be
Breaks my mind just tryin' to see

Is there hope anywhere?
Is there love here anywhere?

Can you hear my rusted heart?
For you, it just might fall apart
My hope is broken
Can you see such a golden dream?
Such a frozen dream can never pass
This event horizon
We've such a golden dream
Such a golden dream can never last
My burden lifted
I am free, such a foolish dream
Such a foolish dream can never be
Breaks my mind just tryin' to see

Is there hope anywhere?
Is there love here anywhere?
Is there faith anywhere?
Just a crumb here anywhere?
