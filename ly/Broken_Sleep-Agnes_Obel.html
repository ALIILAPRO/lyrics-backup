		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Broken sleep, all too human
A malady, it's gazing through when I would

Dream me a dream (soft as a pillow)
Dream me a dream (dream me a dream)
Dream me a dream (deep in the night 'til the morning will follow)
Dream me a dream (dream me a dream)

Shapes of smoke, all too human
They grow, like titans

I would like to fall, silence every call
(Will you level me with a dream?)
If I could fall (fall), fall (fall)

I would like to fall (fall asleep), silence every call
(Will you level me with a dream?)
If I could fall (fall), I would like to fall (fall)

Twisted rope, defies all I know
It holds, my reason

Dream me a dream (soft as a pillow)
Dream me a dream (dream me a dream)
Dream me a dream (deep in the night 'til the morning will follow)
Dream me a dream (dream me a dream)

Sea of trees, calling humans
To hang like leaves from the willow

I would like to fall, silence every call
(Will you level me with a dream?)
If I could fall (fall), fall (fall)

I would like to fall (fall asleep), silence every call
(Will you level me with a dream?)
If I could fall (fall), I would like to fall (fall)

Take my word for it, for it
In the dark, in the dark
In the dark words can follow
