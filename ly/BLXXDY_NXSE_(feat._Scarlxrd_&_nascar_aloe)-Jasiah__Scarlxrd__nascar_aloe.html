		  (Got the beat by Powers and we just made a banger)
Yuh (ayy), yuh, what? (Ayy)
Yuh, yuh, what? (Ooh)
Yuh, yuh, yuh (bitch)
Yuh, yuh, fuck (ayy)

Chain around my neck when I give niggas bloody nose (woo)
I don't need a map, bitch, I'ma find out where to go (woo, whoa)
Bitches on my sack, I know I said that shit before (woo, whoa)
But I can't take you back, I couldn't ever love these hoes (woo, whoa)

Bitch, keep it a hunnid, but I ain't talkin' 'bout Gecs (yeah)
I am not a thief, but I'll take your soul out your chest (yeah)
She love the way I scream, and got it tatted on her neck (yeah)
She love the way I think, and wanna gimme all the sex (ayy)
I can't be a dummy, bitch, I see straight right through your disguise (disguise)
With him in the pit, bitch, I'ma always wanna fist-fight
I aim for your liver (yes)
Yeah, I got these chains on, but I am not your nigga (what, what?)
She got long neck, bonehead, go 'head (yeah)
She gon' suck my dick thinkin' that she gone get a bonus
I wanna beat your fuckin' brain until sound like macaroni (yeah, bitch)
I just popped a E, I'm feeling low on serotonin (what? What? What? What?)

Chain around my neck when I give niggas bloody nose (woo)
I don't need a map, bitch, I'ma find out where to go (woo, whoa)
Bitches on my sack, I know I said that shit before (woo, whoa)
But I can't take you back, I couldn't ever love these hoes (woo, whoa)

I ain't ever worried 'bout the shots these niggas throw
I just say the word and point your face out to my bro
We gon' get to fuckin' cheffin', nigga, definitely won't be a truce
But I ain't ever trippin' 'cause I'm intimate, I get it fuckin' done
I ain't ever do war with a bitch, only straight facts
I haven't fumbled fuckin' competition, nigga, run me, we'll see what it's like
Pussy boys wanna talk shit, but don't ever spit upon tracks
I felt pressure one time, now look at my name, ain't it big?
Niggas relivin' my past
All these bitches I'm killin', I'm bad
Muscles tense, they can't take what I have
Optimistic, I double the glass
Don't want the sympathy, no, I can't fuck with the energy
Might throw it all in my grave
Movin' this shit got me hustlin'
Come on then, test me, nigga, I'll pick anyone's flesh

Chain around my neck when I give niggas bloody nose
I don't need a map, bitch, I'ma find out where to go
Bitches on my sack, I know I said that shit before
But I can't take you back, I couldn't ever love these hoes
Chain around my neck when I give niggas bloody nose (woo)
I don't need a map, bitch, I'ma find out where to go (woo, whoa)
Bitches on my sack, I know I said that shit before (woo, whoa)
But I can't take you back, I couldn't ever love these hoes (woo, whoa)

What's that in your ear? Lil' bitch, it's audible destruction
Jump inside the pit and make you reap what you sow
My girl's gang is chickens, all they want is some suction
To dirty politicians, we ain't property you, ho
The fuck up?
IS these walls closing in or am I just fucked up?
I like my HP on my 808s like dump truck
They're loud as fuck
Am I detained, why am I cuffed up?
Ready to go to war
Play me non of your shit, boy, I heard it all before
They don't like my joke because it always ends up gory
I just wanna even out the score
You won't ever be like me, lil' bitch, I see that, end of story

Fuck
Ayy
