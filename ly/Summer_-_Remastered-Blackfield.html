		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love me as the summer gone
When eyes are closed and days are long' so long
I burned a torch for you but all the while
Somewhere in the haze you lost your smile

Love me as the winter comes
Don't cast your shadow on my soul, please don't
Don't let me sink don't let the darkness in
Let your perfect fingers touch my skin

Heart needs a home
It's a dark and empty road
When you're alone
Heart needs a home
It's a dark and empty road
When you're alone

Love me as the springtime comes
Let your song drift down the stairs to me
Waiting here along the way to blue
Remembering the days I spent with you

Heart needs a home
It's a dark and empty road
When you're alone
