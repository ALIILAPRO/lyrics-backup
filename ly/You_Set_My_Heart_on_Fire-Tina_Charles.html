		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once my life was just a lonely room
With no one to take away my gloom
Waiting for someone to come and
Fill my life with love
Oh sweet love
 
And set my heart on fire, fire
Fire in the flame of love
Higher, higher
Than the stars above
I need someone to dive me in water, water
That will make me strong
Oh I need somebody to burn me in the flame of love, yeah
 
Every cloud must have a silver lining
You came alone my knight in armor shining
All my life I've been knocking on doors
Now I'm so glad that door that opened was yours
 
You set my heart on fire, fire
Fire with the flame of love
Oh you take me higher, higher
Than the stars above
You got, you got to dive me in water, water
That will make me strong

Oh pretty baby I'm burning at your flame of love, yeah
Oh pretty baby I'm burning, burning at your love
Oh pretty baby I'm burning, burning at your flame of love
Oh pretty baby I'm burning, burning at your love
