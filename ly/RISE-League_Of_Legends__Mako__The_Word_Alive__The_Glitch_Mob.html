		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Welcome to the wild, no heroes and villains
Welcome to the war, we've only begun, so
Pick up your weapon and face it
There's blood on the crown, go and take it
You get one shot to make it out alive, so

Higher and higher you chase it
It's deep in your bones, go and take it
This is your moment, now is your time, so

Prove yourself and
Rise, rise
Make 'em remember you
Rise
Push through hell and
Rise, rise
They will remember you
Rise

Welcome to the climb up, reach for the summit
Visions pray that one false step lead the end, so

Higher and higher you chase it
It's deep in your blood, go and take it
This is your moment, take to the skies

Go and prove yourself and
Rise, rise
Make 'em remember you
Rise
Push through hell and
Rise, rise
They will remember you
Rise

So get along, so get along, go
Get along-long get a move on up
So get along, so get along, go
Get along-long get a move on up

And if you fight among the dead beneath the dirt
Well, do you know yet?
Well, do you want it?
And when the giants call to ask you what you're worth
Do you know if?
Win or die, you'll

Prove yourself and
Rise, rise
Make 'em remember you
Rise
Push through hell and
Rise, rise
They will remember you
Rise
Prove yourself and
Rise, rise
Pick up your weapon and face it
Rise
It's deep in your blood, go and take it (it's deep in your blood, go and take it)
Rise, rise
(Higher and higher you chase it) higher and higher you chase it
Rise

Rise, rise (so get along, so get along, go)
