		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You wouldn't leave
For another better world
You wouldn't leave
For the best of reasons
(repeat)

I wanna tell you that I do care
But I can't promise
Cause I don't know who I am
At the moment I am doing
What I never thought I'd do
I see everything around me
Through your eyes
You may love me as an angel
Can you love me as a fool
Make it better together

You wouldn't leave
For another better world
You wouldn't leave
For the best of reasons

I wanna give you more than flowers
To give you something
Like a bridge up over time
So that we could be together
In a sunny better world
Take a short way to the kingdom of passion
It's like a promise of a new life
You will have me once again
When the night is all over

You wouldn't leave
For another better world
You wouldn't leave
For the best of reasons

I'm shaping up my life now
It turned me upside down
And it is odd to me you didn't
Leave me with the speed og light
I guess I'm looking like an angel
In your eyes

I wanna tell you that I love you

You wouldn't leave
For another better world
You wouldn't leave
For the best of reasons
