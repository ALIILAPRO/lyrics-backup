		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm still dreaming
You destined me to fail
I'll fight 'til I prevail
You said It's too late to salvage me
Your voice it haunted my once pleasant dreams
No longer a prisoner of the opinions you scream

Just ask yourself
Is this a dream or reality?

Is this a dream or reality?
I don't care, it's making me feel
So alive
Life's too short to care
I like the way it feels so good
But I don't care oh yeah, 'cause I'm still dreaming

What's not enough for you
Might be enough for me
Erased all my self doubt and finally broke free
Why can't you let me be happy
Why can't you let me be
I never met your standards
'Cause I am only me

Is this a dream or reality?
I don't care, it's making me feel
So alive
Life's too short to care
I like the way it feels so good
But I don't care oh yeah, 'cause I'm still dreaming

There's no greater treasure than time
I've got one shot to make it mine
Just like a ghost you've been haunting me
My time has come so let me be

I'm still dreaming, I'm still dreaming
Woah oh oh
We're still dreaming, we're still dreaming
Woah woah
I'm still dreaming, I'm still dreaming
Woah oh oh
We're still dreaming, we're still dreaming
Woah woah

Is this a dream or reality?
I don't care, it's making me feel
So alive
Life's too short to care
I like the way it feels so good
But I don't care, oh yeah
'Cause baby I'm still dreaming
And I'm feeling
Alive
'Cause I'm still dreaming

I'm still dreaming
I'm still dreaming
I'm still dreaming
'Cause I'm still dreaming
