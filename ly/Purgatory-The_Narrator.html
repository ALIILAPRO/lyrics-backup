		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ignite
The torch in front of their fortress
Deny
The words they‘ve spread through their voices
Full send
Are you ready for the conquest?
Misspend
Your time awaiting the bomb test
Let’s go

Blood runs cold all that reigns is our violent spread
We‘re not told anymore to stay silent
And before all their guns are reloaded
We‘re yet here and we

The spark in the silence seems to ignite
All of the tyrants eye for an eye
Tonight we’re alive
There is no better place we could go
To hang their bodies just for show
'Cause tonight we can’t die

Watch all the tyrants get defeated by their enemies
How they recognize the downfall of their dynasties
Where the tombstone is set and there is no light to see
Where there’s no room to breathe when you lie six feet deep

And before all their guns are reloaded
We‘re yet here and we crack your skulls open

The consent is to bleed
Defeat the enemy

The spark in the silence seems to ignite
All of the tyrants eye for an eye
Tonight we’re alive
There is no better place we could go
To hang their bodies just for show
'Cause tonight we can’t die

And we sing to the sirens
All alone in the silence
'Cause we long for fucking violence

Consciousness to bleed
Into purgatory
Burn in hell with me
Defeat the enemy
