		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been a little while but I'm still battling
Moving fast while you just prattling
No time for me, no tangling
Hit you in the spot with no angle and

I'm not a princess
(A lot of anger in it) not a cutie girlfriend, oh, no
Don't you know? (Hoo)

Flashy rhymes coated with spangles
Add some sounds in it times wangles
Three dots connect to rectangles
Just like music sounds connect to rambles

You cannot run away (hell nah, no man can run away)
From me I stay in your head as one big threat!

It's demolition
Wiping all out (wipe out)
I won't go (yeah, yeah)
Until it's over (once again)
It's coalition
Pieces of wreckage
Come to me
And let it be one
