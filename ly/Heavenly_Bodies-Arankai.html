		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see the breath leave your throat like the holy ghost
Only heavenly bodies glow
The way that you do
The way that you do
I want a taste of divinity
At whatever altar you made for me
Take me church, I'll worship on my knees

You make Paradise seem so close
As we dance in the dark
I've taken a break from the misery
The heaven in you meets the hell in me
Yeah
As we're dancing in the dark
You make Paradise seem so close
As we dance in the dark
I've taken a break from the misery
The heaven in you meets the hell in me
Yeah
As we're dancing in the dark

Behind your lips, are dangerous things
Swallow my world, you can take all of me
Roses and thorns, you're worth bleeding for
But I want more

I want a taste of divinity
At whatever altar you made for me
Take me to church, darling I'll worship
Give me a purpose
Frozen in time, I won't forget
The silver outline of your silhouette
Wrapped in the smoke of my cigarette
Patience is punishment

You make Paradise seem so close
As we dance in the dark
I've taken a break from the misery
The heaven in you meets the hell in me
Yeah
As we're dancing in the dark
You make Paradise seem so close
As we dance in the dark
I've taken a break from the misery
The heaven in you meets the hell in me
Yeah
As we're dancing in the dark
