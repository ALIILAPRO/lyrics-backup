(Ay, Moon, turn my shit up)

Honey make the wood burn slow, you know?
We're havin' escargot, you know?
I'm not afraid to spark pole, you know?
Touchable, just went gold, you know?
Those Percocets are gonna wear off, you know?
They only get along because they share opps, you know?
We like stealin' off on marks, you know?
I miss catchin' fades at SIMS park, you know?

Do I have to raise my voice for you to hear me?
If I didn't extend my hand, could you feel me?
Another innocent man just plead guilty
You can believe it or not, who am I, Ripley's? (It's Remble)
Carry the smoke name like a chimney
Dolce and gold chains like Nipsey
Codependent and rope chain, are you kidding me?
Had me thinkin' like, "Was he faded off the Hennessy?"
I've got the bag all my life
Nickels act tough, but they be droppin' dimes, like
Before brodie blasted, he sparked a wood and got his mind right
We'll see 3K if fire camping get his time sliced
Newborn, I really miss you, brodie, stay strong
My pops been in the hole so he can't call
You on the court, but you never played ball
Heard my grind is hit every dorm and really break jaws

Honey make the wood burn slow, you know?
We're havin' escargot, you know?
I'm not afraid to spark pole, you know?
Touchable, just went gold, you know?
Those Percocets are gonna wear off, you know?
They only get along because they share opps, you know?
We like stealin' off on marks, you know?
I miss catchin' fades at SIMS park, you know?

When you think people solid, they fold
I don't wanna hear any excuses, you told
We caught cutty with his pants down, he frozed
Make a three, look at the stands now, D. Rose (swish)
Ay, crodie, you see that car comin'?
Remember when we would hit peck and get the park jumpin'?
Spot suckers then bounce out and leave the car runnin'?
Before we started commercial licks I would car pass
When Crash hopped out, I did a 40 yard dash
A sunny day on Second, damn, I near had a hot flash
Got chopper, but I just really need a compact
I don't want an extendo, where's the stock at?

It's just me and you, there's no room for back up
Heavy in the field, make sure your boots are strapped up
Fell behind, there's nothin' to do but catch up
Maybe change your mindset and get a new perspective, but

Honey make the wood burn slow, you know?
We're havin' escargot, you know?
I'm not afraid to spark pole, you know?
Touchable, just went gold, you know?
Those Percocets are gonna wear off, you know?
They only get along because they share opps, you know?
We like stealin' off on marks, you know?
I miss catchin' fades at SIMS park, you know?

Honey make the wood burn slow, you know?
We're havin' escargot, you know?
I'm not afraid to spark pole, you know?
Touchable, just went gold, you know?
Those Percocets are gonna wear off, you know?
They only get along because they share opps, you know?
We like stealin' off on marks, you know?
I miss catchin' fades at SIMS park, you know?
