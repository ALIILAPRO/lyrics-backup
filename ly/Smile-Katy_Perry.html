		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile (smile)
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile (smile)

Every day, Groundhog Day
Goin' through motions felt so fake
Not myself, not my best
Felt like I failed the test

But every tear has been a lesson
Rejection can be God's protection
Long hard road to get that redemption
But no shortcuts to a blessin'

Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile (smile)
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile (smile)

I'm 2.0, remodeled
Used to be dull, now I sparkle
Had a piece of humble pie
That ego check saved my life

Now I got a smile like Lionel Richie
Big and bright, need shades just to see me
Tryna stay alive just like I'm the Bee Gees
A Mona Lisa masterpiece

Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful (so thankful)
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile (smile)

(I'm so thankful)
('Cause I finally, 'cause I finally)
(I'm so grateful)
('Cause I finally, 'cause I finally)

Ooh I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile (smile)
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful 
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile (smile)

I'm so grateful
'Cause I finally, 'cause I finally, ohh
I'm so grateful
'Cause I finally, 'cause I finally, ohh
