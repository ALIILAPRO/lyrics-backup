		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm wearin' a robe
The same ones we left on the hotel floor
Just one year ago
"Do not disturb" hangin' on the door

How the hell we end up, where we did?
Don't you think it's messed up? It all went to shit
It's kind of depressing, bein' here alone
I miss you, so pick up the phone

And I order room service for one
Champagne mini bar bottles are done
I've got a balcony room with a view
Velvet curtains are closed
I'm singin' sad songs in a hotel room
Where I once held you
I'm singin' sad songs in a hotel room

The neighbors are knockin', they just wanna sleep
It's three AM while my guitar gently weeps
I flip through these old magazines
Dream destinations we promised we'd see, ooh

How the hell we end up, where we did?
Then one year, it all went to shit

So I order room service for one
Champagne mini bar bottles are done
I've got a balcony room with a view
Velvet curtains are closed
I'm singin' sad songs in a hotel room
Where I once held you
I'm singin' sad songs in a hotel room

We checked in together, I never checked out
Guess it's heartbreak hotel 'cause just look at us now

Oh, I order room service for one
Champagne mini bar bottles are done
I've got a balcony room with a view
Velvet curtains are closed
I'm singin' sad songs in a hotel room
Where I once held you
I'm singin' sad songs in a hotel room
