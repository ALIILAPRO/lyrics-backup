		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Down
To get the pain out my chest
I feel it numbing me now
And I'll be up pretty late
I thought about
Playing with myself for a while
I wanna feel what it's taken
And i'll be up pretty late
And I don't wanna wake up high
'Cause I'm stuck in the bends
And even as the days go by
It still comes 'round again
Now
I thought that was part of it
Been cycling through the same
I've been putting my weight
On the things that don't help me
I wanna turn it away
But I know I'm not ready
And I don't wanna wake up high
'Cause I'm stuck in the bends
And even as the days go by
It still comes 'round again
And I don't wanna wake up high
'Cause I'm stuck in the bends
And even as the days go by
It still comes 'round again
