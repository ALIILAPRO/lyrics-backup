		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mystery, the moon 
A hole in the sky 
A supernatural nightlight 
So full, but often right 
A pair of eyes a closin' one 
A chosen child of golden sun 
A marble dog that chases cars 
To farthest reaches of the beach and far beyond into the swimming sea of stars 

The cosmic fish they love to kiss 
They're giving birth to constellations
No riffs and oh, no reservation 
If they should fall, you'd get a wish or dedication 
May I suggest you get the best 
For nothing less than you and I?
Let's take a chance as this romance is rising over, before we lose the lighting

Oh bella, bella, please 
Bella, you beautiful Luna 
Oh bella, do what you do 

You are an illuminating anchor 
Of leads to infinite number 
Or crashing waves and breaking thunder 
Tiding the even flows of hunger 
You're dancing naked there for me 
You expose all memory 
You make the most of boundary 
You're the ghost of royalty imposing love 
You are the queen and king combining everything 
Intertwining like a ring around the finger of a girl 
I'm just a singer, you're the world 
All I can bring you
Is the language of a lover 
Bella Luna, my beautiful, beautiful moon 
How you swoon me like no other, oh-oh

May I suggest you get the best 
Of your wish, may I insist
That no contest for little you or smaller I?
A larger chance had, but all them, they lie 
On the rise, on the brink of our lives

Bella, please 
Bella, you beautiful Luna 
Oh bella, do what you do
Bella Luna, my beautiful, beautiful moon 
How you swoon me like no other, oh oh oh
