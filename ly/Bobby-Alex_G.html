		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bobby's just a friend of mine
He's on his back
I'm on his mind
He wakes me when he goes to work
His hands are cold
His breath is smoke

I'd leave him for you
If you want me to
I'd leave him for you
If you want me to
I'd leave him for you
If you want me to
I'd leave him for you
If you want me to

Do you forget when we first met?
You grabbed my hand
I tore your dress
I felt things I cannot express
But I lost my way
I made my mess

I'd clean it for you
If you want me to
I'd clean it for you
If you want me to
I'd clean it for you
If you want me to
I'd clean it for you
If you want me to

But I know what you're doing
I know what you're doing
I know you
I know you
I do, I do, I tell you what

I paint pictures of my heart
The colors blue and purple start
To bleed into an endless dark
It's only you, it's only you

I'd burn them for you
If you want me to
I'd burn them for you
If you want me to
I'd burn them for you
If you want me to
I'd burn them for you
If you want me to

But I know what you're doing
I know what you're doing
I know you
I know you
I do, I do, I tell you what
