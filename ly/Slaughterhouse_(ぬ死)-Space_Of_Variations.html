		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Save me from your senseless words
I don't need them anymore
I just wanna know the truth

Don't you wanna come to play
Your favourite game?
Pay the price and let's pick a victim
Are u feeling tired
With the tons of the lies
Don't wipe the sleep from your eyes
Don't you wanna come to play
Your favourite game?
Obey me cause I'm predictor
R u feeling tired
With the tons of my lies
Don't wipe the sleep from your eyes

Save me from your senseless words
I don't need them anymore
I just wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know the truth

Are you sure you can handle it ?
Cause it hits like a hammer
We a have truth for every taste
Choose your version

I will shoot your truth like ratatatata
And lead you to a slaughterhouse

ぬ死

Step one
Integration of the concept
Step two
The program will find you
Step three
Ignore what you feel, Ignore what you see
I need this
inside you

Save me from your senseless words
I don't need them anymore
I just wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know the truth

Are you sure you can handle it ?
Cause it hits like a hammer
We a have truth for every taste
Choose your version
