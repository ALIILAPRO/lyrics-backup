		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alright, let's go
There's gonna be one less lonely girl(one less lonely girl)
One less lonely girl(one less lonely girl)
There's gonna be one less lonely girl(one less lonely girl)
One less lonely girl

How many I told you's and start overs
And shoulders have you cried on before?
How many promises be honest girl?
How many tears you let hit the floor?

How many bags you packed
Just to take 'em back tell me that
How many either or's (but no more)
If you let me inside of your world
There'd be the one less lonely girl

Saw so many pretty faces (before I saw you you)
Now all I see is you
No no
Don't need these other pretty faces like I need you
And when you're mine in the world

There's gonna be one less lonely girl(I'm coming for you)
One less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
One less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
One less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
There's gonna be one less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
I'm gonna put you first (I'm coming for you)
I'll show you what you're worth (that's what I'm gonna do)
If you let me inside your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

Christmas wasn't merry 14th of February not one of them spent with you
How many dinner dates set dinner plates and
He didn't even touch his food
How many torn photographs are you taping back
Tell me that couldn't see an open door
But no more
If you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl

Saw so many pretty faces
(Before I saw you you)
Now all I see is you
I'm coming for you I'm coming for you
No no
Don't need these other pretty faces like I need you
And when your mine in this world

There's gonna be one less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
One less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
One less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
I'm gonna put you first (I'm coming for you)
I'll show you what you're worth (that's what I'm gonna do)
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be on less lonely girl

I can fix up your broken heart (heart)
I can give you a brand new start (start)
I can make you believe (yeah)
I just wanna set one girl free to fall,
Free to fall (she's free to fall)
Fall in love
With me

Her hearts locked and nowhere to get the key
I'll take her and leave the world with one less lonely girl

There's gonna be one less lonely girl (one less lonely girl)
One less lonely girl (one less lonely girl)
There's gonna be one less lonely girl (one less lonely girl)
One less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
One less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
One less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)

I'm gonna put you first (I'm coming for you)
I'll show you what you're worth (that's what I'm gonna do)
If you let me inside your world
There's gonna be on less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
One less lonely girl (one less lonely girl)
One less lonely girl (one less lonely girl)

I'm gonna put you first (I'm coming for you)
I'll show you what you're worth (that's what I'm gonna do)
If you let me inside your world
There's gonna be on less lonely girl

You shawty
