		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Had she lost another one
She would've end just like her son
Bitter man now turned insane
Day his dog took on the train

Had she lost another one
She would've end just like her mom
Dyed the hair to look as young
Inhaled fumes and spoiled a lung

By grace, she was spared
A few toes, a few
To care

Had she lost another one
Insurance lawyers would have won
Settle quick, the course was cheap
Didn't bother to go deep

I saw the home she's from (ooh)
No pearl for one to hum (ooh)
That pride so deer to some (ooh)
She learned to overcome (ooh)
Fate unearned

By grace, she was spared (ooh)
A few toes, a few (ooh)
To care (ooh)

By grace, she was spared (ooh)
A few toes, enough (ooh)
To care
