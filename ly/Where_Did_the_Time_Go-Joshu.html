		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hello stranger, I'm a child
I can show you how you used to smile
And be the things you can't express
That's when truth is at its best
I remember well
The way you used to tell
Of how we found the sea
By mama’s mango tree
We all live in between
The silent silver screen
And someone’s fading dream
Mmm, where did the time go?
Mmm, where did the time go?
Is this the way to Half Moon Bay?
Are these the words that you could never say?
Is this the place I learned to laugh
Before the silence in the photographs?
I remember well
The way you used to tell
Of how we found the sea
By mama’s mango tree
We all live in between
The silent silver screen
And someone’s fading dream
Mmm, where did the time go?
Mmm, where did the time go?
Mmm, where did the time go?
Mmm, where did the time go?
Mmm, where did the time go?
Mmm, where did the time go?
