		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me, "You're the best thing"
I tell you, "That's what you need"
Rolling on those good looks
Maybe it's just enough
I know you dream of snowfields
Floating high above the trees
Living for the new thing
Sometimes the new won't do

Kisses
Born desert sun
Kisses
Born desert sun
Kisses
Born desert sun

Maybe there's a car there
Driving away from here
Taking all the ghosts, the hurt
Well, everything starts anew
Tell me what you need, what's right
Whatever is just enough
Is living with the truth, a start
Maybe it's just enough

Kisses
Born desert sun
Kisses
Born desert sun
Kisses
Born desert sun

Kisses
Born desert sun
Kisses
Born desert sun
Kisses
Born desert sun
Kisses
Born desert sun
