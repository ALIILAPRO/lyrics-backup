		  Lately
What I wanna say could hurt you now
I'm here in the middle of the night, I'm callin' out
Was safe with you, I'll be gone before you let me down, yeah
And you know it's true, oh
Lately
What I wanna say could hurt you now
I'm here in the middle of the night, I'm callin' out
Was safe with you, I'll be gone before you let me down, yeah
And you know it's true, oh

Oh Lord, Lord knows we fight
But when things come forth, we pay the price
Mm
What is this for me? What is this for you?
What is this life? It was ours, I'm so grateful to know
Mm
I'm not searchin' or stoppin'
You're not waitin' for your faith in love to grow
No chasin' or wonderin', always had you as a friend
It feels hard to say now, oh
I'm not sayin' that I'm perfect
But we had more than somethin'
Doesn't always work out

Lately
What I wanna say could hurt you now
I'm here in the middle of the night, I'm callin' out
Was safe with you, I'll be gone before you let me down, yeah
And you know it's true, oh
Lately (Lately)
What I wanna say could hurt you now
I'm here (I'm here) in the middle of the night, I'm callin' out 
Was safe with you, I'll be gone before you let me down (down)
And you know it's true, oh

Not all things last
But I got this pack
One night but I won't take you back
Won't lie, I just knew you wouldn't get it
I lie 'cause I regret it
They say you won't regret something that you never did
