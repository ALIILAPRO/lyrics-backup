		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been a long day, living with this
It's been a long time since I felt so sick
I took a long walk straight back home
I could of walked back to San Francisco

I used to long for time alone
I used to long for a place of my own
And I'm losing faith in everything
I'm lost so lost, I'm lost at sea, you see

I used to long for broken bones
I used to long for a casket to call my own
I never had a problem facing fear
But I'm done, over and out, my dear

And oh, mercy me
God bless catastrophe
There's no way in hell
You'll ever live to see through this so

Drive yourself insane tonight
Its not that far away
And I just filled up your tank earlier today
Yeah

It's been a long day, living with this
It's been a long time since I felt so sick
I took a long walk straight back home
I could of walked back to Chicago

I used to long for time alone
I used to long for a place of my own
And I'm losing faith in everything
I'm lost, so lost, I'm fucked without you

Oh, mercy me
God bless catastrophe
There's no way in hell
We'll ever live to see through this so

Drive yourself insane tonight
It's not that far away
And I just filled up your tank earlier today
Yeah

So drive yourself insane tonight
It's not that far away
And I just filled up your tank earlier today
Yeah
Yeah
