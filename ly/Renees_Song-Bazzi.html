		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a song I like to sing
It says your name, I love the ring
So come here, so come here
I may be broken by my past
But I know my worst days, they won't last

If you come here 
(Just come here, come here, come here)
So, come here
Oh, will you come here?

Oh, isn't it beautiful
Watchin' the cards unfold?
Oh, I want you to come here (I want you to come here)
Oh, I want you to come here 
Touchin' you, lovin' you
Touchin' you, lovin' you
I've been touchin' you, lovin' you
Touchin' you, lovin' you
I've been-

There's a wind up in the North
It tells us love's our only source

So, come here 
(Just come here, come here, come here)
So, come here (oh, will you come here?)
Oh, will you come here? 
(Just come here, come here, come here)
Just come here
Oh, will you come here?

Oh, isn't it beautiful
Watchin' the cards unfold?
Oh, I want you to come here (I want you to come here)
Oh, I want you to come here

Watchin' you dance tonight
So free and full of life
Oh, I want you to come here (I want you to come here)
Oh, I want you to come here
