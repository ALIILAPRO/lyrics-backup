		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For the first time, I would like my name
Just because of the way you say it
And I would memorize every line and hair
To remember when you aren't there
We would walk along a tree-lined street
With a breeze dancing at our feet
And we would sing a song in harmony
If only you hadn't left me
So I'll think of you once in a moon
When I hear your favorite tune
And someday after a year or two
Maybe then, I won't be loving you
I'll think of you once in a moon
When I see someone who looks like you
And someday after a year or two
Maybe then, I'll still be loving you
We would say goodbye just to say hello again
And we would get in fights just to get over them
We would be alright even if things don't stay the same
If only you had stayed
So I'll think of you once in a moon
When I hear your favorite tune
And someday after a year or two
Maybe then, I won't be loving you
I'll think of you once in a moon
When I see someone who looks like you
And someday after a year or two
Maybe then, I'll still be loving you
What if I had bit my tongue
What if what we had was enough
I guess all my calculations were off
When I thought I would get over you
It doesn't make sense
But I'd do it all again
I'll think of you once in a moon
When I hear your favorite tune
And someday after a year or two
Maybe then, I won't be loving you
I'll think of you once in a moon
When I see someone who looks like you
And someday after a year or two
Maybe then, I'll still be loving you
