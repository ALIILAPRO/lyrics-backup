		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walking the crossroads of hell on earth
A devil's deal for a new rebirth
I've given my all and day by day
My soul still breaks
I can remember crossing the line
When ushered into a darker time
Though we were in agony
You left me in your wake

When I curse your name
Can you see my face?
And do you taste my pain
In this bloodstained place?
Forever on the attack
I'm fighting into the black
Without you
Without you
Will my scars reveal
All the sins you chose?
And how betrayed I feel
In my fractured bones?
For us there's no turning back
I'm fighting into the black
Without you
Without you

Still hanging on for the white hawk's fall
When vengeance comes and I heed the call
With every time I plunge the steel
I'm seeing you
You once had used my desire to kill
Granted me hope with a quiet thrill
I watched as you changed the world around me
Cut in two

When I curse your name
Can you see my face?
And do you taste my pain
In this bloodstained place?
Forever on the attack
I'm fighting into the black
Without you
Without you
Will my scars reveal
All the sins you chose?
And how betrayed I feel
In my fractured bones?
For us there's no turning back
I'm fighting into the black
Without you
Without you

I guess I gambled and lost when fate shuffled our decks
Now that I suffer the wrath of your mad God complex
As I follow the path where the darkness collects
So much death, what for, what for, what for?
Though I'm losing control I can't give up the chase
No time for mourning the loss of what hatred replaced
There lies barely a soul behind my changing face
I will break no more, no more, no more

When I curse your name
Can you see my face?
And do you taste my pain
In this bloodstained place?
Forever on the attack
I'm fighting into the black
Without you
Without you
Will my scars reveal
All the sins you chose?
And how betrayed I feel
In my fractured bones?
For us there's no turning back
I'm fighting into the black
Without you
Without you

Without you

When I curse your name
Can you see my face?
And do you taste my pain
In this bloodstained place?
Forever on the attack
I'm fighting into the black
Without you
Without you
Will my scars reveal
All the sins you chose?
And how betrayed I feel
In my fractured bones?
For us there's no turning back
I'm fighting into the black
Without you
Without you
