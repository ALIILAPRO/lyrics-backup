		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby please don't go 
Baby please don't go 
Baby please don't go down to New Orleans 
You know I love you so 
Baby please don't go 

When the man done gone 
When the man done gone 
When the man done gone down the county farm 
He got the shackles on 
Baby please don't go 
Don't leave me 

I'll be a dog 
I'll be a dog 
I'll be a dog kiss your way down here 
When you walk along 
Baby please don't go 

Why must you leave me 
Lying on my back 
Going across the other side of the track 
Found yourself a new man I know 
So baby please don't go 
Baby please don't go 

Oh please, please don't leave me 
I don't want to be left alone baby 
Oh don't go, don't go, don't go
