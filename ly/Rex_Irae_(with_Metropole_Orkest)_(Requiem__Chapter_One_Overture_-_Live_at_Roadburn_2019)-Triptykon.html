		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  you have joined your father's feast those who saw essence or fall floods of dramatic silence and words from whom we don't know . 

let me dream a pallid death flee from false mirage into dark I have tasted the weight of lust the horizons echo your glance my hands on the skein of heigh following a detracting sleep 

I am the wrath beneath the heavens the downfall's monologue fallen into the vision of effect quiet as gods can be 

orgies of fear all mortal is love inbreeding and death remembrance has won . I have walked Carthage's sands breathing glorified innocence I've touched those buried walls quiescence has died therefore 

I am the wrath beneath the heavens the downfall's monologue fallen into the vision of effect quiet as gods can be  we stood before the portals of Babylon and saw it's petrified fall  we tasted the wine of Persepolis as mute as our era's breath 

this last region lakes of fire orgasmic cries tears and words wrath and strength oh gods for you before the throne death 

fright and praise art of might a faded light you remaining king intimate rests my book take your predecessor's hand unwritten what seems true you son of my jade gift 

I am the wrath beneath the heavens the downfall's monologue fallen into the vision of effect quiet as gods can be
