		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know there's something that your dying to tell me
I hope its not about your future male

Make sure no-one finds out
Tell me all about it
Don't keep it to yourself
Because I have bear the thought
I know you'll leave me crying
I know you'll find me
It doesn't matter because I'll make you crawl

I know that you're ashamed
So ashamed that is kills you
Don't you know that you're ashamed
So much that it kills you

There's always something that makes you guilty
This is something that your dying to tell me

Make sure no-one finds out
Tell me all about it
Don't keep it to yourself
Because I can't bear the thought
I know you'll leave me crying
I know you'll find me
It doesn't matter 'cause I need you so

I know that you're ashamed
So much that it kills you
Don't you know that you're ashamed
So much that it thrills you
