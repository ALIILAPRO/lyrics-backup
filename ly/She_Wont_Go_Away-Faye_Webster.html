		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Verse 1]
I think I have lost
So much time, over the course
Calling you mine, you say it's fine
But she won't go away

[Verse 2]
So, maybe next year
Things will go just as I planned
Maybe, who knows, she could be down
But she won't go away

[Chorus]
It's you, hiding in limelight
It's you, no one really likes
It's you, happy all the time
It's you

[Verse 3]
How do I forget
That she's around? Is there a trick?
Middle grounds, be okay with it
'Cause she won't go away

[Chorus]
It's you, hiding in limelight
It's you, no one really likes
It's you, happy all the time
It's you


[Chorus]
It's you, hiding in limelight
It's you, no one really likes
It's you, happy all the time
It's you
