		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Final fantasy (fi, fi), that's what I'm on
Yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, ridin' through all that shit, blue, whatever
Fuckin' bozo, whatever

Final fantasy, got the strategy
Final fantasy, she can't stand me (fi, fi)
Final fantasy, she can't stand up
Final fantasy, she can't last with me (fi, fi)
Final fantasy, this a new life
Final fantasy, this a trilogy (fi, fi)
Final fantasy, this not moonrock
Probably smokin' on my latest enemy (fi, fi, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Final fantasy, got the strategy (yeah)
Final fantasy, she can't stand me (fi, fi, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Final fantasy, she can't stand up
Final fantasy, she can't last with me (fi, fi, whoa)
Final fantasy, this a new life (yeah)
Final fantasy, this a trilogy (fi, fi, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)

Final fantasy, this not moonrock (no)
Probably smokin' on my latest enemy (fi, fi, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)

Final fantasy, this a new life (yeah)
Final fantasy, this some new ice (fi, fi)
Final fantasy
Changed my religion, just so I can have two eyes (fi, fi)
Final fantasy, that's a X pill (whoa)
Final fantasy, that's a sex pill (fi, fi, whoa)
Got a Xan' in me, you not family
I still be out here catchin' wrecks still (fi, fi, oh-oh)
I cannot let you, we gotta go, boy
Gotta fold, I can really just know you, boy (fi, fi)
Gotta watch out for demons in kingdom hearts (fi, fi)

Hearts (fi, fi)
Oh-oh, oh-oh (yeah, fi, fi)
Oh-oh, oh-oh (I can't take it, fi, fi)
Oh-oh, oh-oh (I can't do this shit, fi, fi)
Oh-oh, oh-oh (yeah, fi, fi)

Final fantasy, got the strategy
Final fantasy, she can't stand me (fi, fi, ooh)
Final fantasy, she can't stand up
Final fantasy, she can't last with me (fi, fi, whoa)
Final fantasy, this a new life
Final fantasy, this a trilogy (fi, fi, yeah)
Final fantasy, this not moonrock
Probably smokin' on my latest enemy (fi, fi, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Final fantasy, got the strategy (yeah)
Final fantasy, she can't stand me (fi, fi, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Final fantasy, she can't stand up
Final fantasy, she can't last with me (fi, fi, whoa)
Final fantasy, this a new life (yeah)
Final fantasy, this a trilogy (fi, fi, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Final fantasy, this not moonrock
Probably smokin' on my latest enemy (fi, fi, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)

Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah (fi, fi)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah (fi, fi)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah (fi, fi)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah (fi, fi)

Final fantasy, at the mercy
Foreign girl, yeah, she say, "Merci" (merci, fi, fi)
I'm a space cadet, final fantasy
She said, "Uzi, can you fuckin' land in me?" (Fi, fi)
Pussy pink, I pull up in some salmon seats
What I do? Tell me why they mad at me (fi, fi)
I can never hear what they be talkin' 'bout
'Cause I'm probably on my final fantasy (fi, fi)

Final fantasy, got the strategy
Final fantasy, she can't stand me (fi, fi, ooh)
Final fantasy, she can't stand up
Final fantasy, she can't last with me (fi, fi, whoa)
Final fantasy, this a new life
Final fantasy, this a trilogy (fi, fi, yeah)
Final fantasy, this not moonrock

Probably smokin' on my latest enemy (fi, fi, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Final fantasy, got the strategy (yeah)
Final fantasy, she can't stand me (fi, fi, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Final fantasy, she can't stand up
Final fantasy, she can't last with me (fi, fi, whoa)
Final fantasy, this a new life (yeah)
Final fantasy, this a trilogy (fi, fi, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Final fantasy, this not moonrock
Probably smokin' on my latest enemy (fi, fi)
