		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're the lump in my throat
You're the reason I choke
On the words that I wish I had said
You're the feeling of home
Smell of smoke on my coat
Miss you over, and over again

Everybody says I'll survive, I'll be fine
But they don't know what it's like

If it doesn't wake you up
In a violent sweat and steal your breath
If it doesn't make a cut
That just won't close, it wasn't love
So let me go

Did you learn how to drive?
Are you somewhere tonight
With someone trying to paint over me?
Oh, it hurts but it should
It hurts but it's good
'Cause the best kind of love scars' deep

If it doesn't wake you up
In a violent sweat and steal your breath
If it doesn't make a cut
That just won't close, it wasn't love
So let me go

Ooh oh oh, ooh oh oh
So let me go
Ooh oh oh, ooh oh oh
So let me go

I'll survive, I'll be fine
But they don't know what it's like

If it doesn't wake you up
In a violent sweat, steal your breath
If it doesn't make a cut
That just won't close, it wasn't love
So let me go

Ooh oh oh, ooh oh oh
So let me go
Ooh oh oh, ooh oh oh
So let me go
