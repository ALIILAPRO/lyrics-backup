		  Belfast
Belfast
Belfast
Got to have a believin'
Got to have a believin'
Got to have a believin'
All the people
'Cause the people are leavin'
When the people believin'
When the people believin'
When the people believin'
All the children cause the children
Are leavin'

Belfast
Belfast
When the country rings the leaving bell you're lost
Belfast
Belfast

When the hate you have
For one another's past
You can try (You can try)
You can try (You can try)
You can try
To tell the world the reason why
Belfast
Belfast
Belfast
It's the country that's changin'
Oh, it's the country that's changin'
It's the country that's changin'
All the people
'Cause the people are leavin'
It's the world that's deceivin'
It's the world that's deceivin'
It's the world that's deceivin'
All the people
'Cause the people believin'

Belfast
Belfast
When the country rings the leaving bell you're lost
Belfast
Belfast

When the hate you have
For one another's past
You can try (You can try)
You can try (You can try)
You can try
To tell the world the reason why
Belfast
Belfast
Belfast

When the children believin'
When the children believin'
When the children believin'
All the people
'Cause the people are leavin'
When the people are leavin' (you)
When the people are leavin'
When the people are leavin'
All the children
'Cause the children believin'

Belfast
Belfast
When the country rings the leaving bell you're lost
Belfast
Belfast

When the hate you have
For one another's past
You can try (You can try)
You can try (You can try)
You can try
To tell the world the reason why
Belfast
Belfast
Belfast
Belfast
Belfast
