		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They saw you yesterday as you were leaving
Now they run to hunt you down
Dogs lead the chase as you are bleeding
They run to hunt you down

Your narrow escape has wiped the smile right from your face
Starved dogs howling, run to hunt you down
I said run to hunt you down

You smile as you look in the mirror
Tears have left your eyes
Your face has a different exterior
Permanent disguise

Your narrow escape has wiped the smile right from your face
Starved dogs howling, run to hunt you down
I said run to hunt you down

Right now ooh
Right now ooh
Right now 
Right now 
Right now ah, ah, ah, ah
