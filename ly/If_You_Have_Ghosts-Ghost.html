		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you have ghosts you have everything
If you have ghosts you have everything
You can say anything you want
And you can do anything you want to do
If you have ghosts you have everything

One never does that one never does that
You can call it surprise, there it is
And a part of it is me one never does that

In the night, I am real
In the night, I am real
The moon to the left is a part of my thoughts
And a part of me is me, forever is the wind
In the night, I am real

I don't want my fangs too long
I don't want my fangs too long
The moon to the left is a part of my thoughts
And a part of me is me, forever is the wind
I don't want my fangs too long

If you have ghosts you have everything
If you have ghosts you have everything
If you have ghosts you have everything
If you have ghosts you have everything
