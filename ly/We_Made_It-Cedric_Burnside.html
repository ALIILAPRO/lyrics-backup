		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I came from nothin'
I done been, I done been lower than low
I keep my head straight
No matter, no matter how low I go
Grew up a po' boy
Settin' traps in the corner to catch mice
I remember the days yawl 
All we had, all we had to eat was rice

But we made it
But we made it 
But we made it 
Yes we did
Didn't have a toilet 
Didn't have, didn't have a bath tub 
Walked three miles every day
To have water in the house for another day

But we made it
But we made it 
But we made it 
Yes we did
