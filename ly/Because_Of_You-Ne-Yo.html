		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh

Ooh, want to, but I can't help it
I love the way it feels
It's got me stuck between my fantasy and what is real
I need it when I want it, I want it when I don't
Tell myself I'll stop everyday, knowing that I won't

I got a problem, and I (ooh, don't know what to do about it)
Even if I did, I don't know if I would quit but I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it

And I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it

Said and it's all because of you (all because of you)
Said and it's all because of you, mmm (all because of you)
And it's all because of you (all because of you)
Said and it's all because
Never get enough
She's the sweetest drug (ooh-ooh-ooh)

Think of it every second, I can't get nothin' done
Only concern is the next time I'm gon' get me some
Know I should stay away from, 'cause it's no good for me
I try and try, but my obsession won't let me leave

I got a problem and I (ooh, don't know what to do about it)
Ooh, even if I did, I don't know if I would quit but I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it, ayy (ooh-ooh-ooh)

And I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you (strung out on you)
I can barely move, (ooh), but I like it (and I like it)

Said and it's all because of you (oh, all because of you)
Said and it's all because of you, mmm (all because of you)
And it's all because of you (all because of you)
Said and it's all because
Never get enough (never get enough)
She's the sweetest drug (ooh-ooh)

Ain't no doubt (no doubt, ayy)
So strung out (strung out, oh)
Ain't no doubt (this ain't no grain of doubt, oh)
So strung out (hey)
Over you, over you, (you), over you (you)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Because of you
And it's all because of you
Mmm, never get enough
She's the sweetest drug

And I know this much is true
Baby, you (baby, you, you, you)
Have become my addiction (my addiction)
I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it (but I like it, yeah)

Said and it's all because of you (oh, all because of you)
Said and it's all because of you, mmm (all because of you)
And it's all because of you (all because of you)
Said and it's all because
Never get enough (oh, never get enough)
She's the sweetest drug

She's the sweetest drug
