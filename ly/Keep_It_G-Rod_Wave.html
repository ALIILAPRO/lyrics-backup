		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A couple hours, then I'll feel numb
And I buy myself pretty things (pipe that shit up, TnT)
Whenever I feel lonely
(Trill got that juice, nigga)
Speaking of the past
I'm running out of
And I slept with someone else
Touch me better than you
In fact I saw him for a day or two, I'm
Running out of

Youngin told me that he really wanna go legit
Thought about it, then he went ahead, bought him a brick
Say you ain't ballin' 'til you got you a Benz
So I went and got me a Benz
I wonder where all my friends had went 'fore I was major
They was happy for me 'til a nigga made it, that shit be crazy
You get money, then you become a target
This part the hardest, it seems I solved it
The top so lonely, the jackers is hungry
The bitches is heartbreakin', the family is phony
These niggas so slimy when that paper involved
I hope they know I got enough money to kill 'em all
I'm locked in with the YGs and I'll send 'em all
Them young niggas ready to bend your block and break it off
I make one call, and I love 'em for that
Know I gotta love 'em for that
But 'fore I make 'em crash, I'll show 'em how that money could stack

The rap game like the dope game
I can hear your cries, I can feel your pain
Young nigga beat the pot 'til you ain't got to beat the pot no more, no more
I got a word from the trenches, we don't care
We got down here, you just get up there
Do your thing, we got your back
No matter what you do or where you at
Keep it gangster (yeah, Nuni)
Keep it gangster (they gon' find us, nigga)
Keep it gangster
Keep it gangster, keep it gangster

He could bring out every single emotion
(He hits all categories) Like, for real 
Some folks don't even understand how dark and how lonely the world can get
Like some days
You can't compare Rod Wave to everybody else
I just be going through it, and
Man, you really makin' me think about shit, like
I put, I put his shit on and I know
I know, like, oh, you were feelin' like this
(Keep it gangster)
Nigga, the streets love and the hoes adore
It's
(Got to keep it gangster)
Nigga bring every emotion out your body
(Got to keep it gangster)
It, it helps
It helps me get through it

Sittin' in my spot, I overheard a story
This old nigga was tellin' me how it went down
How the jackers around and how them niggas runnin' wild
If you ask my opinion, them niggas is clowns
Ran in a nigga house and laid it all down
Threw his kids in the tub and duct taped 'em by the mouth
They even beat up his bitch, they beat up his lady
It's crazy what these niggas'll do for this paper
Let that would've been my lady, my red baby
Two-fifty on a nigga head, he could fuck around and die tonight
Spin his funeral and spin his candlelight, you fuckin' right, nigga
Fuckin' right

The rap game like the dope game
I can hear your cries, I can feel your pain
Young nigga beat the pot 'til you ain't got to beat the pot no more, no more
A word to the trenches, I don't care
I got up here, you just get down there
Do your thing, I got your back
No matter what you do or where you at
I'ma keep it gangster
