		<p>
		  Hey God
Okay
I forgot that I don't want to know anyway

Do you
Ever pray
Can I live by the words that you want me to say? 

You've got to do that thing you do I'm getting lost
You've got to be the one I've always wanted to trust

I know you want me to fall for you
But do you want me to stay? 

So hey God
Just wait
I'm not clear on the way it'll fall into place

I'm not
Insane 
I just wake through the night and I sleep through the day

You've got to do that thing you do I'm getting lost
You've got to be the one I've always wanted to trust

I know you want me to fall for you
But do you want me to stay? 
When I remember to call for you
What do you want me to say? 

So hey God
Okay
I forgot that I don't want to know anyway
