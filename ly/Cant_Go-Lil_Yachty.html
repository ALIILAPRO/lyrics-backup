		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go
Big bank, stash that
New car matte black
Quarter mill' in backpack (skrrt)
Glock 9, left hip
No, a nigga can't go (brrt, brrt, brrt)

All the Bloods yellin' "Slatt, slatt"
Bad bitch, bring her home
Bend her over, break her back (uh)
Send her on her way with cash (uh-uh)
These days these niggas act similar to hoes (on God, nigga)

Don't make me pull my 9 (9, yeah)
Get back, boy, you's a lil' cat
Let these niggas hang around, should've told they ass scat (go)
Get the dough, get up off your ass and get at it (yeah)
Please don't try it (nah), this shit Chopper City (grrt)
Left hand lookin' like a motherfuckin' blizzard (ice)
Bitch, I am a wizard (a wizard), used to sip the sizzurp (sip)
Had to let it go, but I miss it dearly (on God)
Roll, smoke a pure leaf (yeah), big B's, diamond teeth

Go
Big bank, stash that
New car matte black
Quarter mill' in backpack (uh-huh)
Glock 9, left hip
No, a nigga can't go (facts, facts)

All the Bloods yellin' "Slatt, slatt"
Bad bitch, bring her home
Bend her over, break her back (uh)
Send her on her way with cash (uh-uh)
These days these niggas act similar to hoes (this a fuckin' fact, nigga)

That's a motherfuckin' fact, nigga
