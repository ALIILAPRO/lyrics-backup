		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hands are getting cold, I feel it  
Paracetamol will heal it   
Hope it takes me down
Down the rabbit hole, to freedom
Oh, it's in my head 
I'm mad and twisted
A misfit , and I won't miss it 
I'm never coming back

I was right to think my mind is kinda sick
Need a psychiatrist now
Thoughts in my head all are gone way too fast
So instead I'll be writing em down
Mayday mayday, going fucking crazy
Someone's gotta save me or I'm out
I may wake under a blossom tree
But who knows? 

Take me to wonderland
Play me my song again
I can't be like one of them
So take me to wonderland

The way that I'm thinking
As scary it possibly gets
I'll drink it and maybe I'm shrinking
But I'll probably just end up dead
Led by strife and discord like eris
And a broadened mind like alice
Now, all that shit has brought me here
Like it's gotta be the white rabbit 
Have it tatted right on my neck 
To remind me why I'm like that
I bottled whole the double dose
So I won't be right back
I keep it all on the low
Sorry mama, gotta go 
Next time leaving I guess you're seeing me
Never coming back home

I was right to think my mind is kinda sick
Need a psychiatrist now
Thoughts in my head all are gone way too fast
So instead I'll be writing em down
Mayday mayday, going fucking crazy
Someone's gotta save me or I'm out
I may wake under a blossom tree
But who knows? 

Take me to wonderland
Play me my song again
I can't be like one of them
So take me to wonderland
