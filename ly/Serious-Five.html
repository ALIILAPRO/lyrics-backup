		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Boogie down, boogie down 
You gotta get serious 
What, what come on 

Perplexing as I racks the decks so check the flex poetical sex I
Bring the 
Funk to your necks check it 
Second time around better than the first, I quench your thirst,
My rhymes 
Fill ya till ya burst 

Get serious 
Cause we're gonna do for you, you know it's true we got a second
Album 
Coming through 
Too many people thought we couldn't go on 
But yo, we're still number one see we shine like the sun 

Hands up in the air
Wave 'em like you care 
Feel the funky beat 
Everybody on your feet 

Get serious 
We got it going on tonight 
Get serious 
Everything will be alright 
All I know is true that I want to be with you 
You gotta get serious, serious, serious 

Could I be the one that twists tighter than a curl 
Coming through from the mist 
Check my definition, rhyme composition 
On the double o-5ive mission 
With the aim to please any beef with the rod gone fishing 
Check if you're down tonight 
Put your hands in the air if you feel alright 
Got enough for what you need 
So get serious Baby please 

Hands up in the air
Wave 'em like you care 
Feel the funky beat 
Everybody on your feet 

Get serious 
We got it going on tonight 
Get serious 
Everything will be alright 
All I know is true that I want to be with you 
You gotta get serious, serious, serious 

Now we've been waiting for so long 
Give me a chance to get it through 
You are the flavur to my song 
That's why I want to be, want to be with you 

Stop, clear the stage so we can get busy 
Open up your mind while I hit you with the nitty gritty 
We came to rhyme, we came to get down 
Wo when we rock the mike we bring the funk into your town 
So I drop a rhyme onto the mike while it's mine then you gotta
Pass it on 
While I rock you with a line 
As we hip we hop we're getting others in the run 
Flicking switches on the bottom of the mike cause we're done 

Get serious 
We got it going on tonight 
Get serious 
Everything will be alright 
All I know is true that I want to be with you 
You gotta get serious, serious, serious 

Get serious 
We got it going on tonight 
Get serious 
Everything will be alright 
All I know is true that I want to be with you 
You gotta get serious, serious, serious
