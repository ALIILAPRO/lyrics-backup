		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was thoroughly convinced
By every guy I kissed
That we could wait and it's no problem
To let them know when I won't stop them

But here's a thought
I'm just gay

I was thoroughly revoked
By half the guys I chose
I know that isn't that uncommon
What's wrong with me
I won't try to solve it

They knew before me
I'm just gay

Everyday I get more gay
And I find out
That it's okay

Every night
It's alright
It all makes sense
I'm just a dyke
