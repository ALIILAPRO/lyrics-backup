		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Must you dance every dance 
With the same fortunate man?
You have danced with him since the music began
Won't you change partners and dance with me?

Must you dance quite so close 
With your lips touching his face?
Can't you see
I'm longing to be in his place?
Won't you change partners and dance with me?

Ask him to sit this one out and while you're alone
I'll tell the waiter to tell him he's wanted on the telephone
You've been locked in his arms ever since heaven-knows-when
Won't you change partners and then
You may never want to change partners again
Won't you change partners and then
You may never want to change partners again
