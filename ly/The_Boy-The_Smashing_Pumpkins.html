		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't stop, I can't breathe, I can't think
I'm in love again
I don't need, I don't eat, I don't sleep
I'm in love again
Ooh, and every time I heard you breathe
I sighed 
Ooh, and every time I saw you bleed
I cried
Love is like a song
And if you sing
If you ever need me
I'll be there, and I-
I can't stop, can't breathe, can't think
I'm in love again
I don't need, I don't eat, I don't sleep
I'm in love again
Ooh, and every time that I'm with you
I'm alive
Ooh, and every time I think of you
There's a light
And I felt it, too
And my heart is a spring
Is a well, if you need
If you drink it for you
Then I'm leavin'
Every little part of me is a part of you
I can't stop, I can't breathe, I can't think
I'm in love again
I don't need, I don't eat, I don't sleep
I'm in love again
I can't stop, I can't breathe, I can't think
I'm in love again
I don't need, I don't eat, I don't sleep
I'm in love again
The boy, the boy's in love
The boy, the boy's in love
The boy, the boy's in love
The boy, the boy's in love
