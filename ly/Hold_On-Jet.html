		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You tried so hard to be someone
Did you forget who you are
You tried to fill some emptiness
'Til all you had spilled over

Now everything's so far away
That you don't know where you are
You are

All that you wanted
And that you have done
Says so much
For you to hold on to
For you to hold on to
You belong too

When it's to be yourself,
It's not to be someone else
Still, everything's so far away
That you forgot where you are
You are

Well, all that you wanted
And that you have done
Says so much
For you to hold on to
For you to hold on to

Hold on, hold on,
Hold on, hold on,
Hold on, hold on,
Hold on, hold on,
And all that you wanted
And that you have done
Says so much
For you to hold on to
For you to hold on to
For you to hold on to
For you you belong to
