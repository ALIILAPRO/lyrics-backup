		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put on the headset, get on
The stage
Out on a midnight escapade
Didn't want to steal your
Thunder
Wouldn't want to play your
Game
Makin' all the headlines
Gettin' on the front page
Didn't even know her number
Didn't even know her name

Stand up, stand up and take
It
Stand up, stand up and make
It
Stand up, stand up and face
It
Stand up

Get on the red dress, slip
On the lace
Up for a high heel and a
Pretty face
Woman want to get you under
Woman want to get you tame
Lovin' on a hot night
Stokin' up the flame
Didn't want to know her number
Didn't want to know her name

(You can make it)
