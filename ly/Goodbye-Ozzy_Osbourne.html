		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (One, two, three, four)
Do you have any memories? Hahahaha

Dark memories, dark memories
They keep me up all night
You left me, half empty
Why are you always right?
Can't change me, can't change me
No matter how you try
You break me, forsake me
Right now, I wanna die

So it's goodbye (bye, bye)
So it's goodbye (bye, bye)

No future, no no no future
Replace me, now I'm gone
Black dresses, black roses
The world keeps turning on
Cry for me, cry for me
It's what I really want
I'm leaving believing
My work down here is done

So it's goodbye (bye, bye)
So it's goodbye (bye, bye)

Did you hear it, purgatory
Not afraid to burn in hell
All my friends are waiting for me
I can hear them crying out for help
Crying out for help

No reward for suicide
No pain in blood can still be felt
Mother Mary, Jesus Christ
I wish you heard me cryin' out for help
Cryin' out for help

The crowd is still waitin'
I took my final bow
It's over, so over
Too late to turn back now
I'm sorry, so sorry
I give my life a try
Forgive me, forgive me
I didn't say goodbye

So it's goodbye (bye, bye)
So it's goodbye (bye, bye)

Did you hear it, purgatory
Not afraid to burn in hell
All my friends are waiting for me
I can hear them crying out for help
Cryin' out for help
Cryin' out for help

"Is it tea time yet?
Do they sell tea in Heaven?"
