		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Not sleeping, a vampire
Bed of lies, I burn at the stake
And I'd do it twice
Hard as it is to stay alive
Don't know if I'm ready for the night

Dark circles bruise purple
My grip is tight
I'm inking my goosebumps
My pulse is spiked
Hard as it to stay alive
You give and you take all of my time

Leaning my face on the sink, I don't know want to think
I could drink, I could smoke, I don't know where to go
When the going is tough and I'm all alone
Choosing to live in a blurrier world, I got comfortable living with hurt
Didn't think it'd get worse but it did and it made my head go

Welcome to my revolution
Got my eyes wide open and my heart's half broken
Welcome to my revolution
Got the storm clouds coming, you won't see me running
No, I won't let the bastards get me down
Won't let the bastards get me down

My pain is my armor, I'm bulletproof
So come take a shot, yeah, I dare you to
Hard as it is to stay to alive
Blood in my veins runs cold as ice

Leaning my face on the sink, I don't know want to think
I could drink, I could smoke, I don't know where to go
When the going is tough and I'm all alone
Choosing to live in a blurrier world, I got comfortable living with hurt
Didn't think it'd get worse but it did and it made my head go

Welcome to my revolution
Got my eyes wide open and my heart's half broken
Welcome to my revolution
Got the storm clouds coming, you won't see me running
No, I won't let the bastards get me down
Won't let the bastards get me down

Revolution, revolution (ooh)
Revolution, revo- (welcome to my)

Welcome to my revolution
Got my eyes wide open and my heart's half broken
Welcome to my revolution
Got the storm clouds coming, you won't see me running
No, I won't let the bastards get me down (ooh)
Won't let the bastards get me down

No, I won't, no, I won't
I won't let the bastards get me down
