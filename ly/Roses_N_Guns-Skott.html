		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Catch me
Catch me in my prime
I'm a snowdrop
Melting down your spine

And if love is
Love is all you need
Then why would you
Spend it all on me?  There's no limit to my thirst
Hungry hearts don't miss dessert
What are tears in pouring rain? I could swear it's like I'm
Tasting sweet and bitter, savoury
When I say your name

I will be your secret
Every other weekend
80 million pieces
Roses N guns for no reason

Do you hear the birds sing? Trying to tell us something? Not that I'll be listening
Roses N Guns when we're kissing

Take me
Pick the parts you like
I'm your snowdrop
More or less white

I know that my love is
What you really need
Sugar won't you Spend it all on me?

There's no limit to my thirst
Hungry hearts don't miss dessert
What are tears in pouring rain? I could swear it's like I'm
Tasting sweet and bitter, savoury
When I say your name

I will be your secret
Every other weekend
80 million pieces
Roses N guns for no reason

Do you hear the birds sing? Trying to tell us something? Not that I'll be listening
Roses N Guns when we're kissing

I will be your secret
Every other weekend
80 million pieces
Roses N guns for no reason

Do you hear the birds sing? Trying to tell us something? Not that I'll be listening
Roses N Guns when we're kissing

Roses N Guns when we're kissing
Roses N Guns when we're kissing
