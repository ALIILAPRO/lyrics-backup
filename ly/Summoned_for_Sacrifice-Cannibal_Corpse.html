		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thirteen chosen by the elders to kill
One chosen by the elders to die
Summoned for sacrifice

Taken to a dungeon
Where others have perished before him
Enveloped in fear and silence

Arms and legs are shackled
Awaiting in the darkened cold
The time has now arrived
Dissected then exterminated

Torches lit, the room starts to glow
Twenty six eyes gazing at the prey
One by one they will mutilate him

With knives in hand they'll take their turn
Removing pieces of his body
He'll be made to suffer til' he breathes no more

The first one cuts off a foot above the ankle
As the blood begins to spray
The second one hacks off a hand at the wrist
The third one does the same
The fourth one slices off the other foot
The fifth one, his whole leg
The sixth one chops off one of his arms
Not much of him remains

Close to death, red liquid flows
In a few minutes it will be over
One by one they will mutilate him

With knives in hand they'll take their turn
Removing pieces of his body
He'll be made to suffer 'til he breathes no more
Until he breathes no fucking more
Summoned for sacrifice

Thirteen chosen by the elders to kill
One chosen by the elders to die
Summoned for sacrifice

Why this must happen, no one knows
Mindless sheep doing what they're told
One by one they will mutilate him

With knives in hand they'll take their turn
Removing pieces of his body
He'll be made to suffer 'til he breathes no more

The seventh one severs the other leg
Without thinking he licks the blade
The eighth one takes care of the remaining arm
The ninth one extracts the tongue
The tenth one carves off the face of this human stump
The deed is almost done
The eleventh one extracts both of the eyes
The twelfth one plunges steel into the heart

Close to death, red liquid flows
In a few minutes it will be over
The thirteenth one will decapitate him

With knives in hand they took their turn
Removing pieces of his body
He was made to suffer until he breathed no more
