		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, nigga what's up with all that motherfuckin' shit you was talkin', nigga? 
(Nigga, why you trippin'? Hey Dre, why you trippin', why you trippin'?) 
Huh? Fuck that, nigga, what's up with all that shit you was talkin', nigga? 
(I ain't say nothin', why you trippin'?)
You're a motherfuckin' liar, nigga, that was you 
(Nah, that, that wasn't me)
That was you, nigga (that wasn't me)
Ayy, ayy, check this out, motherfucker
What's wrong, nigga? You can't talk with a gun in your mouth? 
(It wasn't, it wasn't me Dre)
You can't talk with a gun in your mouth? (It wasn't me)
Listen up, nigga, you know Lucifer? (Nah)
Well, you're about to meet him, motherfucker

(Who's the man with the master plan?)
A nigga wit' a motherfuckin' gun

Forty-four reasons come to mind
Why a motherfuckin' brother is hard to find
He been walkin' on the streets and fuckin' with mine
Stupid punk can't fuck with a mastermind
See, I never take a step on a Compton block
Or L.A. without the AK ready to pop
'Cause them punk motherfuckers in black and white
Ain't the only motherfuckers I gots to fight
I think it's better to be tellin' the facts than cuffed up
And jacked and fucked up
What you niggas lookin' at?
You goin', "Goddamn," 'cause it's the city
And for you to survive, a nigga gotta be a gangsta
And I'm a nigga you can't remove
Took out a lot of motherfuckers for tryin' to prove
To they homies that they can hang by dealin' with me
But once again in the end they D-E-A-D
I never did time on a murder yet
'Cause I relax, sit back, do a job and jet
Yo, I know you understand my flow
So here we go, and Death Row
Come let a motherfucker know

(Who's the man with the master plan?)
A nigga wit' a motherfuckin' gun
(Who's the man with the master plan?)
A nigga wit' a motherfuckin' gun

D-R-E, a motherfucker who's known for carryin' gats
And kick raps that make snaps, adapts to
Any environment that I'm located at
If you see me on the solo move, believe that I'm strapped
Four-four, tray-eight or AK-47
'Cause slowly but surely send you on a stairway to heaven
Just put my finger on the trigger and pull back
And lay a punk motherfucker flat
As he wonder what popped before he got popped
I told you I was Dre and you know it don't stop
Now I know you understand my flow
So here we go, and Death Row
Come let a motherfucker know

(Who's the man with the master plan?)
A nigga wit' a motherfuckin' gun
(Who's the man with the master plan?)
A nigga wit' a motherfuckin' gun
(Who's the man with the master plan?)
A nigga wit' a motherfuckin' gun
(Who's the man with the master plan?)
A nigga wit' a motherfuckin' gun

I breaks 'em off, I breaks 'em off, yeah
I breaks 'em off, I breaks 'em off, yeah

I breaks 'em off, but I ain't speakin' about between the thighs
I'm talkin' about cockin' a gauge in between your eyes
It'll make you drop to your knees 'cause you realize
That a gat'll make any nigga civilized
Old busta-ass nigga talkin' bullshit
Don't know that I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
Get lit or hit up by the Dr.
A nigga that breaks 'em off properly
Real G, so don't doubt it
I'm the one who's doin' it while these other niggas talk about it
And if motherfuckers come at me wrong
I straight put my forty-four Desert Eagle to his motherfuckin' dome
And show him why they call me the notorious one
The name is Dre Eastwood when I'm packin' a gun
You don't believe me, well step up and give it a try
And if you die, you's a busta, 'cause real niggas don't die
But some still don't hear me, though
You're too near me not to hear me, nigga, yo
So now you know

(Who's the man with the master plan?)
A nigga wit' a motherfuckin' gun
(Who's the man with the master plan?)
A nigga wit' a motherfuckin' gun
(Who's the man with the master plan?)
A nigga wit' a motherfuckin' gun
(Who's the man with the master plan?)
A nigga wit' a motherfuckin' gun
