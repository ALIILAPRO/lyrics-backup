		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Daddy, are you out there?
Daddy, won't you come and play?

Daddy, do you not care?
Is there nothing that you want to say

I know
You're hurting too
But I need, you I do

Daddy if you're out there
Daddy all I want to say

You're so far away
You're so far away

That's OK
That's OK
OK

Daddy, are you out there?
Daddy, why'd you run away?
Daddy, are you OK?

Look dad we got the same hair
And Daddy it's my birthday
But all I want to say

Is you're so far away
Oh, you're so far away

That's OK
That's OK
That's OK

You're so far away
Won't you come and won't you stay?
Please stay
Please stay

Won't you come and won't you stay?
One day
Just one day
