		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I could choose anything
I would be good and bad one day
I would fall into love and stay
Would fall into love

And it's not fair
I keep on writing a sequel to stories
I know that are not there
I don't wanna die but I don't wanna live like this

I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
Something really real so that I can really
Feel like a person again
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
Something really real so that I can really
Feel like a person again

If I am telling the truth
Watching my friends break their hearts into two
Makes me jealous, I know that it's cruel
But what can you do?

And it's not fair
I keep on writing a sequel to stories
I know that are not there
I don't wanna die but I don't wanna live like this

I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
Something really real so that I can really
Feel like a person again
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
Something really real so that I can really
Feel like a person again

Can you tell me a secret
Can you tell me what's wrong with me
I know I should be angry
But I can barely feel a fucking thing
Can you tell me a secret
Can you tell me what's wrong with me
Can you tell me what's wrong with me

I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
Something really real so that I can really
Feel like a person again
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
Something really real so that I can really
Feel like a person again

Can you tell me a secret
Can you tell me what's wrong with me
I know I should be angry
But I can barely feel a fucking thing
Can you tell me a secret
Can you tell me what's wrong with me
Can you tell me what's wrong with me
