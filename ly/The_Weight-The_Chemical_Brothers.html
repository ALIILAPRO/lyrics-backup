		  Who's gonna take the weight?
Who's gonna take the weight?

Who's gonna take the weight?
Who's gonna take the blame? (Watch it now)
Who's gonna take the weight?
Who's gonna take the blame? (Watch it now)

Who's gonna take the weight?
Who's gonna take the blame? (Watch it now)
Who's gonna take the weight?
Who's gonna take the blame? (Watch it now)
Down, out on the streets, yeah

Who's gonna take the weight?
Who's gonna take the blame? (Watch it now)
Who's gonna take the weight?
Who's gonna take the blame? (Watch it now)

Who's gonna take the weight?
Who's gonna take the blame? (Watch it now)
Who's gonna take the weight?
Who's gonna take the blame? (Watch it now)

Who's gonna take the weight?
Who's gonna take the blame?
Who's gonna take the weight?
Who's gonna take the blame?
