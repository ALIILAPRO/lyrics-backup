		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sex jibe husband murders wife
Bomb blast victim fights for life
Girl, thirteen, attacked with knife
Princess Di is wearing a new dress

Jet airliner shot from sky
Famine horror, millions die
Earthquake terror figures rise
Princess Di is wearing a new dress

You can't change the world
But you can change the facts
And when you change the facts
You change points of view
If you change points of view
You may change a vote
And when you change a vote
You may change the world

In black townships fires blaze
Prospects better premier says
Within sight are golden days
Princess Di is wearing a new dress

You can't change the world
But you can change the facts
And when you change the facts
You change points of view
If you change points of view
You may change a vote
And when you change a vote
You may change the world

Princess Di is wearing a new dress
Princess Di is wearing a new dress
Princess Di is wearing a new dress
Princess Di is wearing a new dress
