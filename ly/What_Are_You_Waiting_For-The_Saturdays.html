		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tonight we're on a massive attack
Yeah baby I'm a party freak
And there's no going back
But can you handle that?
Watch me work it out on the floor
Yeah I'm addicted to the beat
Boy what are you waiting for?

What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Tell me what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Tell me what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

'Cause the party ain't over 'til we party through
Saturday morning, Sunday afternoon
And baby when you think that you've had enough
We'll take things a whole level up
I want to lose control, let it go
Lose control, let it go
Lose control
I want to lose control, let it go
Lose control, let it go
Lose control
Love control

Tonight's initiative to the max
I'll take away your sanity and you won't get it back
But can you handle that?
Get your body out on the floor
'Cause if you're partying with me
Then you gotta give more

What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Tell me what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Tell me what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Tell me what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Tell me what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

'Cause the party ain't over 'til we party through,
Saturday morning, Sunday afternoon
And baby when you think that you've had enough
We'll take things a whole level up

Tonight we're gonna party party party
Wanna see everybody move your body body body body
'Cause it's the only way that we party party party
Yeah everybody grab somebody, make it naughty naughty

What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Tell me what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Tell me what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

'Cause the party ain't over till we party through...
Saturday morning, Sunday afternoon
And baby when you think that you've had enough
We'll take things a whole level up

I want to lose control, let it go
Lose control, let it go
Lose control
I want to lose control, let it go
Lose control, let it go
Lose control
Lose control

Tonight we'll run a massive attack
