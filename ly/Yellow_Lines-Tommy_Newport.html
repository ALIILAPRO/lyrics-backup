		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I bet your lover’s got your heart up on a shelf 
You ain't got time for no one else 
But you wanted more (wanted more)
I bet this ticking clock is always on your mind 
Ain't no one coming round this time 
And that's for sure (that’s for sure)

All you want is a state of mind 
That keeps you hovering 
Across this yellow line. 
All you need 
Is a little love 
To keep you moving on
And you'll be fine. 

I got this subtle shock 
That's always on my mind 
My eyes are open but I’m blind 
And yeah it hurts (yeah it hurts)
This sun is shining bright 
But baby it is far from bright 
These clouds are rolling over on the world (on the world)

All you want is a state of mind 
that keeps you hovering 
across this yellow line.
All you need 
Is a little love 
To keep you moving on
And you'll be fine
