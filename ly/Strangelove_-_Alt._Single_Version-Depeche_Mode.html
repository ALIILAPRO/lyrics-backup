		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Strangelove
Strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove
That's how my love goes
Strangelove
Will you give it to me?

Will you take the pain
I will give to you?
Again and again
And will you return it?

There'll be times
When my crimes
Will seem almost unforgivable
I give in to sin
Because you have to make this life livable

But when you think I've had enough
From your sea of love
I'll take more than another river full
Yes, and I'll make it all worthwhile
I'll make your heart smile

Strangelove
Strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove
That's how my love goes
Strangelove
Will you give it to me?

Will you take the pain
I will give to you?
Again and again
And will you return it?

There'll be days
When I stray
I may appear to be constantly out of reach
I give in to sin
Because I like to practice what I preach

I'm not trying to say
I'll have it all my way
I'm always willing to learn
When you've got something to teach
Oh and I'll make it all worthwhile
I'll make your heart smile

Pain, will you return it?
I'll say it again, pain
Pain, will you return it?
I'll say it again, pain

Pain, will you return it?
I'll say it again, pain
Pain, will you return it?
(I won't say it again)

Strangelove
Strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove
That's how my love goes
Strangelove
Will you give it to me?

Strangelove
Strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove
That's how my love goes
Strangelove
Will you give it to me?

Strangelove
Strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove
That's how my love goes
Strangelove
Will you give it to me?

Strangelove
Strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove
That's how my love goes
Strangelove
Will you give it to me?
