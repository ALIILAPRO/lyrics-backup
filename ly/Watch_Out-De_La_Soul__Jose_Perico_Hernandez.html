		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Y de nada sirvió ser grande y famoso
Si todo lo que (?) poco de bomboso
Watch out
Hoy (?) punto de partida
Y con miedo de rodillas enfrente de la vida
Watch out
Si Dios te dio la oportunidad
Para escalar la montaña y te engrandeció
Pero apareció la gran tentación
Ella te sedujo y te destruyó
Eres malo, monte eres para tu (get up, get up, get up, get up)

Get up and do the biz, our style is the wild
Hit you with a spell whether Jew or gentile
When you enterin' the realm, you find me at the helm
Still standin' like abandoned buildings
In the southern part of BX, can old school it like a T-Rex
Your well advanced connect dance with thoughts
Deep like Barry White's throat box
The fix you done copped was mixed
Patrol high tower, my power grants me the chicks
The blows, the cars and enemies that wanna spar
You want to see it no matter who you are
Yeah, I'm bound to ground you like that
Put they ass on a mound and introduce em' to the baseball
Face tall, brag about it like teenage sex
Textbook characters gettin' etched out to rough draft
Rush Limbaugh autograph her left titty
New York, New York, man, we bigger than the buildings (yeah)
Do it for the love of the art and the children's
And throw papier-mâché up inside of ya models
See we all throttles, we zip by in this drive
Allergic to ya sperm, broke hives
Concerned about ya life when you down eight lives
Top of the night I'm up in queens like, "Ah, yeah"

Se te olvidó mirar desde el nivel más alto
Y tu semejante quiere dar un paso
Watch out
Para alcanzar la fama que a ti te subió
Pero mira bien lo que sucedió
Pero apareció la gran tentación
Ella te sedujo y te destruyó (introduce', introduce', introduce')
En el palo monte, para adulto (introducin' to you, Dave)

Batter on deck, carded every time I set foot in the joint
Gamma ray artist, I'll two piece your Tracy
If she want to get bent, we bring her to the tent
Touch her 'til her back indents
Wrap it extra strength
Run a lap on her, calculatin' the length
Holdin' mics tighter than hymens
Old school it like Holly-Hobby, Head-to-Head, Easy Bake Oven
Strong Jerome lovin', man, I hit the pack
Yo, we, Panther power, keep it all relative to the sixties
Bill Bixby green, ATM money
Got my pockets lookin' like I'm rockin' Popeye jeans
Classic like Reuben and Rah
One nigga under the groove, we shootin' for that Parliament high
Plus bigger than the fourth of July (hey, yo)
Take the back seat drive out (hey, yo, hey, yo, hey, yo)

Hey, yo, ain't nothin' street about me, more like a light post
Shinin' above all, who are y'all to boast?
Stayed calm and all came to me to host
My vocab grabs many, long to cultivate raps
It's Kim Field's mom jacked Penny
It used to be unknown around the way
Now my biz became a bouquet
Every nose in it, fillin' up seats like a session in a Senate
Been a minute since you heard the Souls
So the soul gon' cost ya three
All you people want to front like the Soul don't hold control
But it don't mean shit to me
Plain to see that a song like this been what ya all missed (come on)
Genuine adrenaline from off the wrists
We run the interference throughout the game clout
Can't be denied the 'bout for the title
Throw up the belt and hold the pose like an idol
Bring it back to the draw
Ghosts of grand wiz Theodore
Played dirty with it ever since playin' on the floor
Stop verbal assaults just in case a war break glass
Steel vaults bigger than giraffes
But they still tell a lie to me
I heard em' say a lot of niggas rep the underground
They'd die for the underground 
But ain't makin' no money, stupid
