		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mmm
Mmm, yeah

Everybody's got a thing
But some don't know how to handle it
Always reaching out in vain
Just taking the things not worth having but

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
'Cause I'll be standing on the side
When you check it out, oh

They say your style of life's a drag
And that you must go other places
Just don't you feel too bad
When you get fooled by smiling faces

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, baby
'Cause I'll be standing on the side
When you're checking out
When you get off your trip
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing

Come on
Everybody needs a change
A chance to check out the new, yeah
You're the only one who sees
The changes you take yourself through
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Don't you worry 'bout a thing, thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, thing
Pa-pa-p, pa-pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa-p, pa-pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
'Cause I'll be standing on the side
When you're checking out
When you get off your trip
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
'Cause I'll be standing on the side
When you're checking out
Oh, don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
'Cause I'll be standing, I'll be standing by you

Oh 
Oh, oh, don't you worry 'bout a thing
