		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put some voodoo on me
Had me thinking up was down
Took my sense of balance baby I’m still spinning round
And I’m still trynna get rid of the poison
It’s the sweetest one that I’ve ever found
Really went and did a number on me honey yeah I hope you’re proud
Baby it’s so confusing
To be missing your illusion
Gave you every part of me worth losing
Don’t know what I’m doing
It’s all so
Confusing
Try to make myself feel better say you’ll never change
But the visions of your pleasure got me stuck in pain
And I’m starting to believe that I’m crazy
Cuz I hear the heavens calling your name
Know I gotta get away but Im not sure that you’ll let me escape
Baby it’s so confusing
To be missing your illusion
Gave you every part of me worth losing
Don’t know what I’m doing
It’s all so

Confusing
