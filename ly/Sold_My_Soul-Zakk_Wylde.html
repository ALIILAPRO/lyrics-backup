		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Without you woman by my side,
I'm contemplatin' suicide.
Torn from all my pride.
Man tells me: "Son, that ain't the way,
Gonna make a deal with you child,
Gonna live another day.
Just sign right here, son, everything'll be alright."

(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)
Ain't nuthin' I wouldn't do,
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)
All and everything for you,
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)
Your love's all I know and ever knew,
Therefore, I have sold my soul for you,

I was told by this man it'd be worth my while,
He'd return me to my woman.
Return me to my smile.
It's all I ask for in this life.
Whatever's wrong son, he told me he'd make right.
"Just sign right here, child, everything'll be alright."

(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)
Ain't nuthin' I wouldn't do,
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)
All and everything for you,
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)
Your love's all I know and ever knew,
Therefore, I have sold my soul for you.

All for you

"Sign right here, son, everything'll be alright."

(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)
Ain't nuthin' I wouldn't do,
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)
All and everything for you,
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)
Your love's all I know and ever knew,
Therefore, I have sold my soul for you.
