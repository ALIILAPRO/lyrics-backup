		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ain't never been a half-ass lover
Rather lay out on the train tracks for ya
Hit the pavement for ya
Make a statement
And you ain't never had to ask for that
It's included in the packagin'

And I was made like that
I came like that
I paid for that
You ain't never have to pay me back
Can't make me feel bad for nothin'
Don't make me feel bad for lovin'

At my big ol' age
I can't be fazed
By what you mistake as goin' insane
Like I'm just movin' all wild
Fuckin' all wild, runnin' my mouth
Like I'm throwin' it back
Givin' it up when I'm in town

I hear every word they talk
Tried not to care at all
I know it's frontin'
Don't know me from nothin'
Still learnin' to shake it off
I know I can take it all
I know they frontin'
You know they frontin', bae, yeah, uh

So if you hear that rah-rah-rah about me
Talkin' all out the side of they mouth about me
I beg you, don't listen
I beg you, just hear me
Believe me
Trust you can see through it all
Believe through it all
Breathe through it all (all)
Our backs against the wall
We rise and we fall, oh

At my big ol' age
I can't be fazed
By what you mistake as goin' insane
Like I'm just movin' all wild
Fuckin' all wild, runnin' my mouth
Like I'm throwin' it back
Givin' it up when I'm in town

I hear every word they talk
Tried not to care at all
I know it's frontin'
Don't know me from nothin'
Still learnin' to shake it off
I know I can take it all
I know it's frontin'
You know they frontin', bae, yeah
