		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Misguided satellite
I circle by habit
Can't find my orbit to save my life
I want to fall
I want to burn
Like an ignorant crater less meteorite
Long ago I was derailed
Long ago the mission failed
But in the distance there appears a light

Disgruntled architect
Building a palace
Can't make it perfect to save my life
Victimless crime ride the wrecking ball in
Evacuate now while I breathe dynamite
Efforts all to no avail
I'm perfection's countervail
Torn in pieces, I am made contrite

And in my darkest hour
The brightest light draws near to me
A torch to end all torches
This is the light that sets me free
All shadows burn away now
But by his grace I am sustained
Though all was lost
Now all is found and more is gained

Lift me up and make me whole
Instill in me a new hope
Breathe new life into my soul
