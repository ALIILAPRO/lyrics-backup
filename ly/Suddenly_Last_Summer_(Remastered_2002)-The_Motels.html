		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It happened one summer, it happened one time
It happened forever, for a short time
A place for a moment, an end to dream
Forever I loved you, forever it seemed

[Chorus: x2] 
One summer never ends, one summer never began
It keeps me standing still, it takes all my will
And then suddenly last summer
Sometimes I never leave, but sometimes I would
Sometimes I stay too long, sometimes I would
Sometimes it frightens me, sometimes it would
Sometimes I'm all alone and wish that I could

And then suddenly last summer

[Chorus]

And then suddenly last summer

Until suddenly last summer
And then suddenly last summer
Until suddenly last summer
