		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want to be free
Remember how we used to be?
Sit at home and dream
Stare at each other like TV
Teenage headache dreams
Come back to me at night
And try as though I might to live for now
I don't know how
I just feel down
Teenage headache dreams
Seems like the good time's over
But nothing's really over anymore
Just take control

I want to be free
Romanticize reality
Reminds me what it means
To be me
Teenage headache dreams
I'll give up on the fight
To try as though I'd like to leave the moment
I don't know how
Teenage headache dreams
Up all night
To taste life twice
When I think back again
Oh, back again

She rests her head on my shoulder
Blue
Just like always
Teen movies, older too
She softly spoke the words
Is it gonna be okay?
What the hell am I gonna do today?
I'm like a runaway train and I
Try to explain
It has to be
Just try and see tomorrow
You'll look back fondly, I promise

Teenage headache dreams
Teenage headache dreams
Teenage headache dreams
Up all night
To taste life twice

Teenage headache dreams
Teenage headache dreams
And try as though I might to live for now
