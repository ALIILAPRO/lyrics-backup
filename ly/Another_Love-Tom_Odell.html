		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me outside, sit in a green garden,
Nobody out there, but it's okay now
Bathe in the sunlight, the money frame falls,
Take me outside, sit in a green garden

And I'll fly on the wings of a butterfly
High as a tree tall and down again
With my back down, taking my shoes off,
Walk on a carpet, of green velvet

Dance in my garden like we used to,
Dance in my garden like we used to

Take me outside, sit in a green garden,
Nobody out there, but it's okay now
Bathe in the sunlight, the money frame falls,
Take me outside, sit in a green garden

I'll go wherever you go,
Wherever you take me, I'll go
I'll go wherever you go,
Wherever you take me, I'll go

Take me outside, sit in a green garden
Take me outside, sit in a green garden

And I'll fly on the wings of a butterfly
High as a tree tall and down again.
Put my back down, taking my shoes off,
Walking a carpet of green velvet

Dance in my garden like we used to,
Dance in my garden like we used to

Take me outside, take me outside,
Take me outside, sit in a green garden

I'll go wherever you go,
Wherever you take me, I'll go
I'll go wherever you go,
Wherever you take me, I'll go

I'll go wherever you go,
Wherever you take me, I'll go
I'll go wherever you go,
Wherever you take me, I'll go

I'll go wherever you go,
Wherever you take me, I'll go
I'll go wherever you go,
Wherever you take me, I'll go

I'll go wherever you go,
Wherever you take me, I'll go
I'll go wherever you go,
Wherever you take me, I'll go
