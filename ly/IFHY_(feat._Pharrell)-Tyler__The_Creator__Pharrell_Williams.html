		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never would've thought that
Feelings could get thrown in the air
'Cause I accidentally caught that
I need some new boxing gloves, shit got hectic whenever I fought back
For example, ten minutes can't go past without you brushing my thoughts
That's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty four times
I think about you or something like that
Lost match, the fucking thought of you with somebody else
I don't like that cellular convos getting left in the wrong
'Cause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back
This isn't a song I just happen to rhyme when I get emo
And find time to write facts (fuck)
I love you

(Can we add some more color, um, like, some more, yellow?
Yeah, that's good)

I fucking hate you
But I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled
Yeah

I fucking hate you
But I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled
Yeah

Girl you fucking with my emotions
The fuck is all this noise about?
I even considered picking up smoking
You turned to a bitch, who let the dogs out?
But in my dog house
My bitch is the raddest
Crazy who makes me the happiest
Can make me the saddest
Look, Alice
Let's get lost in your wonder-er-land, fuck an atlas
You're perfectly perfect for me
What the fuck is this, practice?
Actually, if you even consider leaving
I'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathing
And you'll see the meaning of stalking
When I pop out the dark to find you
And that new dude that you're seeing with an attitude
Then proceed to fuck up your evening
Make sure you never meet again like goddamn vegans
'Cause when I hear your name, I cannot stop cheesing
I love you so much that my heart stops beating when you're leaving
And I'm grieving and my heart starts bleeding
Life without you has no goddamn meaning
Sorry I'm passive aggressive for no goddamn reason
It's that my mood change like these goddamn seasons
I'll fall for you, but I love you

I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled
Yeah

The sky is falling, girl, let's try to catch it
The sky is falling, girl, let's try to catch it
The sky is falling, girl, let's try to catch it tonight
The sky is falling, girl, let's try to catch it
The sky is falling, girl, let's try to catch it
The sky is falling, bitch, let's try to catch it tonight, come on

Come on baby
Even though I hate you
I still love you
I love you
And Salem I know
I'm passive aggressive (I'm sorry, fuck)
(Come here)
I like when we hold hands
(You're the best around)
See I get jealous (fuck)
And if I see that nigga (if I see him)
I just might kill him (look)
(Look, I wanna strangle you, till you stop breathing)
Love, love, love
(Spend the rest of my life, looking for air)
(So you can breathe, or we can die together, you and me)
(Fuck, look)
I'm in love (love)
I'm in love (love)

I fucking hate you
But I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled
Yeah

Yo, so why is Samuel such a fucking dick?
He isn't such a badass actually
He's only here because he ran away
Because some shit happened back, home he's actually a dweeb
Yo, what happened?
