		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Paralyzed by my envy of the night
I am lost without you here
And outside it looks like rain
For the last time, I bleed myself dry tonight

And nothing I could ever write would help you understand this life
There's so much beauty when your eyes lay lost in all the city lights

The wax will drip as so as blood
Romance is dead and all is lust
You are the water in my lungs
We've lost it all
