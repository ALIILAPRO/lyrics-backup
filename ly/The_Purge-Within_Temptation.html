		  (I can't see)
(I can't see) no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
(I can't see) no, no, no
No, no, no

Got no scars cut on my skin
Only my truth is wearing thin
And it hollows me (it hollows me)
It hollows me

I hate the darkness of my past
The cold rebelling, it drives me mad
And it follows me (follows me)
It's carving the heart out of me

I've got to bleed it out
All my thoughts intoxicated
'Cause the weight of me
It buries me alive

It pulls me down right into the darkness
It pulls me down and I can't resist

Let me feel it 'cause I don't know, I can't see
All I feel is I'm breaking up
Oh, can't you see it's taking over, over me
Can't you see?

Yeah, you want me to fight it and you want me to let go
Yeah, you tell me to fight it and you damn me if I don't
So, let me bleed it out and purge me
I can't see
No, I can't see
No, I can't see

'Cause I feel I'm breaking
(I can't see) no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
(I can't see) no, no, no
No, no, no (I can't see)

My defiance made me strong
But now I'm doubting what I have done
And it's killing me
It's killing me

I hate to see what I've become
I find no peace, no justice done
This gravity (this gravity)
It's carving the heart out of me

I've got to bleed it out
All my thoughts intoxicated
'Cause the weight of me
It buries me alive

It pulls me down right into the darkness
It pulls me down and I can't resist

Let me feel it 'cause I don't know, I can't see
All I feel is I'm breaking up
Oh, can't you see it's taking over, over me
Can't you see?

Yeah, you want me to fight it and you want me to let go
Yeah, you tell me to fight it and you damn me if I don't
So, let me bleed it out and purge me
I can't see (I can't see)
No, I can't see
No, I can't see

'Cause I can't see
'Cause I can't see

Let me feel it 'cause I don't know
I can't see
No, I can't see
No, I can't see
