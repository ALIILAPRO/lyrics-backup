		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Up in the graveyard, there's a party
Everyone's welcome, everybody
Come meet the werewolves, meet the zombies
It's a good time when you're frightening
Yeah

So come one, come all, what you waiting for?
The goblins are already on the floor
The skeleton choir starts to sing their song
So sing along

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Come dance with me at my Halloween party
Ooh, ooh, ooh
It's a spooky scene at my Halloween party
What a supernatural night
Howling at the moonlight
All the ghosts feel alright
'Til the sun stars coming up, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Comе dance with me at my Halloween party

Come meet thе witches, try a potion
All of the ghouls say, "How's it going?"
No tricks, just treats
Jack-o lanterns and chilling screams
Up in the graveyard, at the party, yeah

So come one, come all, what you waiting for?
The vampires are here, knocking at the door
Meet my friend, the mummy, don't be afraid
He said, "I'm feeling great
Now that I am out of my grave"

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Come dance with me at my Halloween party
Ooh, ooh, ooh
It's a spooky scene at my Halloween party
What a supernatural night
Howling at the moonlight
All the ghosts feel alright
'Til the sun stars coming up, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Comе dance with me at my Halloween party

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Come dance with me at my Halloween party
Ooh, ooh, ooh
It's a spooky scene at my Halloween party
What a supernatural night
Howling at the moonlight
All the ghosts feel alright
'Til the sun stars coming up, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Come dance with me at my Halloween party

So come one, come all, what you waiting for?
'Cause everyone's here
Couldn't ask for more
It's one night a year
So let's all run wild with painted smiles

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Come dance with me at my Halloween party
Ooh, ooh, ooh
It's a spooky scene at my Halloween party
What a supernatural night
Howling at the moonlight
All the ghosts feel alright
'Til the sun stars coming up, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Comе dance with me at my Halloween party

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Come dance with me at my Halloween party
Ooh, ooh, ooh
It's a spooky scene at my Halloween party
What a supernatural night
Howling at the moonlight
All the ghosts feel alright
'Til the sun stars coming up, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Come dance with me at my Halloween party
