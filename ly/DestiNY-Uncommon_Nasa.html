		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Critically, a turnstile spiritually
You can feel it b
There’s something in the air, what my feelings be?
A liquidity
Like frozen, un-frozen, expansion
Divide the side walk you standing on upon
Frigidly 
Electricity
Not the Franklin, but what’s inside of me
Heartbeats, but not biologically
You don’t need to buy a lot to see
Just sit still long enough, leave it to destiny
It’s never money, that’s behind the best of what life can bring
Organically
Organs breathe in, wrapped in the veins of a city
Peep the flow
It goes unknown
But still happily
It’s happening
Bringing energy to everything
From every person aged three to every tree
Don’t wait til, the end to see
Fantasies, become reality
Without much, dramatically
Fantastically, emphatically
It’s not up to you, it’s not up to me

((((((DestiNY)))))))

Sonically
Screeching from the train, byproducts seen
Drowning decibels that get you from A to B
But it’s the place to be
The place to go, peep the flow, patterns clean
Organized with colored lettering
Where you can build a life centering
Live through works, endlessly
Brain waves cut through crowds travelling
In close quarters where standing be
The standard seen
Lowers gradually
Not held by what’s on TV, but everything you see
Bombardment, billboards, everything is selling
I question, relevancy
Inspired by hope, I better be
Cyclic energy, it gets to me
Even in New York City where I’m blessed to be
You can find an express path, maybe 2 or 3
But still got to be the one to sit quietly
On the Molinari waves break gently
Smash my thoughts, passionately 
Fascinated by what’s never been seen
And what awaits me
Call it DestiNY
