		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hope you know if I go there
That I'm going there for you
And if I go there
I won't be coming home real soon

We could laugh, we could shout
Sing a song to get it all out
Or we could whisper
We could dance, run about
But you keep starring at each other's mouths
Boy, go on kiss her

It's all the things she do
It's all the things she does
It's all the things she do
It's everything she does

I think there might be snow there, this time of year
You'll bring your snowshoes and I'll bring the beer

We could laugh, we could shout
Sing a song to get it all out
Or we could whisper (whisper)
We could dance, run about
But you keep starring at each other's mouths
Boy, go on kiss her (kiss her)

It's all the things she do
It's everything she does
It's all that we've been through
The things that make us, us

Go on, get it now
