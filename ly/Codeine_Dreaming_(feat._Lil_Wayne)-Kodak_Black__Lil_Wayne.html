		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah
I take that one all the way up
I'm about to take off on these niggas
And I'm codeine dreaming
(And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming)
(And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming)

I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinkie
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Loubotin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinkie
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Loubotin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling

I'm in Uranus right now, I think I've seen a demon
I thought I left you back there in the cell or am I dreamin'?
Say I ain't dealing with your dawg, I'm going a different way
I broke up with my redbone, I went the milky way
I'm ridin' in a Wraith feeling like I'm outer space
Stars on my sunroof, Planet of the Apes
I couldn't wait 'til they released me, right back on the turf
I took off on you bustas, left you right on planet Earth
I feel like Jimmy Neutron, how I blast off on a verse
I know my son gon' like this song so I ain't finna curse
Know he gon' wanna explore the world so I'm a show him first
Say we just distinguished beings, baby, me and you diverse

I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinkie
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Loubotin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinkie
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Loubotin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
(And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming)
(And I'm codeine dreaming)

'Bout to take off on you peons and go back to Mars
'Bout to leave these peons be on like the Jackson 4
Tried to moonwalk on the Moon and had to wax the floors
Tried to put me in a box and then I crashed the Porsche
'Bout to wake up in your biatch and go back and forth
Got her trapping out the the Fiat, she be back and forth
'Bout to put myself together, take it back apart
Got the codeine, all my brothers smell like caviar
Codeine dreaming, they come true too
That's my space ship brp brp!
My milky way got pregnant
She said it's for you hoo
FaceTime Kodak with my new new
I left you 'cause he knew you
I'm wet dreaming 'bout Actavis, two new cups feel like new boobs
Tunechi!

I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinkie
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Loubotin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinkie
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Loubotin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling

'Bout to go to Saturn, heard they got the baddest species
You can hit me on my Galaxy, you tryna reach me
I went to Mars to get some Xanax bars to go to sleep
I'm in my orange space shuttle flyin' two seats
I left Future in Pluto 'cause that boy was too geeked
End up playing Sudoku all the way in Mercury
I took too much of shrooms feel like I'm on Neptune
I'm with an alien, she show me what that neck do
And I'm on metamorphosis, you just a regular dude
You need a space suit to get up on this latitude
If she ain't foreign, then she boring I need a Zorcon
You takin' morphine, homie you a moron

I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinkie
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Loubotin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinkie
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Loubotin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
(And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming)
(And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming)
