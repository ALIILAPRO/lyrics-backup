		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The same hoping
We're hoping for a dark cold winter sun
My body is bitter cold
My mind is overthrown
 
Since the world is full of roles that we play
And as long as we do there's no time to regret
All the ways how you and I had come together
 
Bright lies shine on
Illusions past ages ago
From a distance
See my self existing
Pretend to feel your undertow
 
You see bright lies shine on
Illusions past ages ago
From a distance
See my self existing
Pretend to feel your undertow
 
Ophelia, I leave my broken bones in the desert
Ophelia, I leave my broken bones in the desert
 
The same hoping
We're hoping for a dark cold winter sun
My body is bitter cold
My mind is overthrown
 
Ophelia, I leave my broken bones in the desert
Ophelia, I leave my broken bones in the desert
 
Bright lies shine on
Illusions past ages ago
From a distance
See my self existing
Pretend to feel your undertow
 
You see bright lies, they shine on
Illusions past ages ago
From a distance
See my self existing
Pretend to feel your undertow
 
Ophelia, I leave my broken bones in the desert
Ophelia, I leave my broken bones in the desert
 
You wouldn't tell if you go there
You wouldn't tell if you go there
You wouldn't tell if you go there
You wouldn't tell if you go there
You wouldn't tell if you go there
You wouldn't tell if you go there
You wouldn't tell if you go there
You wouldn't tell if you go there
 
Still the world is full of roles we play
Or maybe love is enough
 
Still the world is full of roles we play
Or maybe love is enough
