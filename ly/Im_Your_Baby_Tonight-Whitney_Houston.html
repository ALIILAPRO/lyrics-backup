		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  From the moment I saw you, I went outta my mind
I never believed in love at first sight
But you got a magic, boy, that I just can't explain
Well, you got a, you got a way that you make me feel
I can do, I can do anything for you, baby

I'll be down for you, baby
Lay all my cards out tonight
Just call on me, baby
I'll be there in a hurry
It's your move, so baby, baby decide

Whatever you want from me
I'm givin' you everything
I'm your baby tonight
You've given me ecstasy
You are my fantasy
I'm your baby tonight

From the second you touched me
I was ready to die
I've never been fatal, you're my first time

I feel like an angel who just started to fly
Well, you got a, you got a way that you make a me
Feel I can, feel I can, do anything for you baby
I will fly for you baby
Hold on and enjoy the ride
I'm not in no hurry
We can fly all night, baby
It's your move, now baby, baby let's fly

Whatever you want from me
I'm givin' you everything
I'm your baby tonight
You've given me ecstasy
You are my fantasy
I'm your baby tonight

Whatever you want from me
I'm givin' you everything
I'm your baby tonight
You've given me ecstasy
You are my fantasy
I'm your baby tonight

Whatever I do, boy 
It's all about you, baby
And ain't the truth, boy
I'm helplessly in love with you
What else can I do, boy
But be there for you, baby
You got a, you got a way that you make a me
Feel I can, feel I can do any, do anything

Whatever you want from me
I'm givin' you everything
I'm your baby tonight
You've given me ecstasy
You are my fantasy
I'm your baby tonight

Whatever you want from me
I'm givin' you everything
I'm your baby tonight
You've given me ecstasy
You are my fantasy
I'm your baby tonight

Looks like I'm fatal, it's all on the table
And baby you hold the cards
You got the magic and I've got to have it
I don't want the pieces, I want every single part
I'll be your angel, I'm ready and able whatever you want is fine
Whenever you're ready, just call on your lady and I'll be your baby tonight

I'm your baby tonight, I'm your baby tonight

Whatever you want from me
I'm givin' you everything
I'm your baby tonight
You've given me ecstasy
You are my fantasy
I'm your baby tonight

Whatever you want from me
I'm givin' you everything
I'm your baby tonight
You've given me ecstasy
You are my fantasy
I'm your baby tonight

Whatever you want from me
I'm givin' you everything
I'm your baby tonight
You've given me ecstasy
You are my fantasy
I'm your baby tonight
