		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Miya hee, miya hoo, miya ha-ha
Stupid heart never learns
It's sad but it's true
My stupid heart only beats for you

I, I always spiral, baby
And I don't have a clue
Why I'd go back to a guy
That makes me fifty shades of blue

I want to just walk away from you
In three weeks it's a habit I'm sure
For now, I'm somehow in and out
Emotionally, I'm still torn

Miya hee, miya hoo, miya ha-ha
Stupid heart never learns
It's sad but it's true
My stupid heart only beats for you

No way to talk me out of loving you, baby
I'm covering my ears and blaming
Miya hee, miya hoo, miya ha-ha
My stupid heart

Lock it up with steel now, baby
Or I'll go break the rules
When I'm all alone I can't be trusted
I got too much to lose, oh oh

I want to just walk away from you
In three weeks it's a habit I'm sure
For now, I'm somehow in and out
Emotionally, I'm still torn

Miya hee, miya hoo, miya ha-ha
Stupid heart never learns
It's sad but it's true
My stupid heart only beats for you

No way to talk me out of loving you, baby
I'm covering my ears and blaming
Miya hee, miya hoo, miya ha-ha
My stupid ha-heart

Vrei să pleci dar nu mă, nu mă iei
Nu mă, nu mă iei, nu mă, nu mă, nu mă iei
Chipul tău și dragostea din tei
Mi-amintesc de ochii tăi
Miya hee, miya hoo, miya ha-ha
My stupid heart
