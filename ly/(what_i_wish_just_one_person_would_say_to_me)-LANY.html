		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We were young, we fell in love
And our hearts were set aflame
I don't know what life is like
If I'm not next to your name
Everything I've ever wanted
Everything I need
But the space inside your heart
Is gonna need more than me

I'm here to stay, I'll find a way
I know it hurts
There's no one else, I'll go through hell
To make it work

Look at you go
The world is yours, I'll hold it down at home
Even though I hate to be alone
I know this is what you gotta do
I'm happy, I'm happy for you

Now and then I find myself
Gettin' lost without you here
Been gone for a couple days
Tell me why it feels like years
Everything I've ever wanted
Everything I need
I'm gonna be strong for you
But I wish you'd never leave

I'm here to stay, I'll find a way
I know it hurts
There's no one else, I'll go through hell
To make it work

Look at you go
The world is yours, I'll hold it down at home
Even though I hate to be alone
I know this is what you gotta do
I'm happy, I'm happy for you

Look at you go
The world is yours, I'll hold it down at home
Even though I hate to be alone
I know this is what you gotta do
I'm happy, I'm happy for you
So, hurry back and let me hold you tight
Even if it's only for the night
There is nothin' that I wouldn't do
I'm happy, I'm happy for you
