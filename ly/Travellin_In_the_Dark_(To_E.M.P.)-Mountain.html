		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Travellin' in the dark
Can't see a thing
Travellin' in the dark

Travellin' in the dark
Can't see a thing
Travellin' in the dark

What you gonna do when you can't seem to understand?
How you gonna feel when your woman's with another man?

Travellin' in the dark
Can't see a thing
Travellin' in the dark

Travellin' in the dark
Can't see a thing
Travellin' in the dark

What makes you think that you're gonna ever understand?
What's goin' on in the mind of another man?

Travellin' in the dark
Can't see a thing
Travellin' in the dark

Travellin' in the dark
Can't see a thing
Travellin' in the dark

What you gonna do when you can't seem to understand?
How you gonna feel when your woman's with another man?
