		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And you can dance
For inspiration
Come on
I'm waiting

Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet, yeah
Step to the beat
Boy, what will it be?

Music can be such a revelation
Dancing around, you feel the sweet sensation
We might be lovers if the rhythm's right
I hope this feeling never ends tonight

Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free
At night, I lock the doors, where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancing here all by myself
Tonight, I wanna dance with someone else

Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet, yeah
Step to the beat
Boy, what will it be?

Gonna get to know you in a special way
This doesn't happen to me every day
Don't try to hide it, love wears no disguise
I see the fire burning in your eyes

Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free
At night, I lock the doors, where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancing here all by myself
Tonight, I wanna dance with someone else

Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet, yeah
Step to the beat
Boy, what will it be?
Yeah

Live out your fantasy here with me
Just let the music set you free
Touch my body, and move in time
Now I know you're mine (you've got to)

Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet, yeah
Step to the beat
Boy, what will it be?

Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free
At night, I lock the doors, where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancing here all by myself
Tonight, I wanna dance with someone else

Live out your fantasy here with me
Just let the music set you free
Touch my body, and move in time
Now I know you're mine

Now I know you're mine
Now I know you're mine
Now I know you're mine
Now I know you're mine
You've got to

Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet, yeah
Step to the beat
Boy, what will it be? (Yeah)
Got to
Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove
Your love to me
Get up on your feet, yeah
Step to the beat
Boy, what will it be?
You've got to
Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet, yeah
Step to the beat
Boy, what will it be?
You've got to
Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove
Your love to me
Get up on your feet, yeah
Step to the beat
Boy, what will it be?
