		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You tell me that you're leaving
And I'm trying to understand
I had myself believing
I could take it like a man
But if you gotta go, then you gotta know
That it's killing me
And all the things I never seem to show
I gotta make you see

Girl it's been so long, now tell me
Tell me how could it be
The one of us knows the two of us don't belong
In each others company

It hurts so much inside, your telling me goodbye
You want to be free
And knowin' that you're gone and leavin' me behind
I gotta make you see, gotta make you see
I gotta make you see

That I still love you, I love you
I really, I really love you, I still love you

Now people tell me
I should win at any cost
But now I see as the smoke clears away
The battle has been lost, lost

I see it in your eyes, you never have to lie
I'm out of your life
Tonight I'll dream away and you could still be mine
But I'm dreamin' a lie, dreamin' a lie
Makes me want to die

Cause I still love you, I love you
Baby, baby, I love you, I still love you

And when I think of all the things you'll never know
There's so much left to say
Cause girl, I see the price of losing you
Will be my hell to pay
My hell to pay, each and every day
Hear what I say

I still, I still love, I still love you, I love you
Baby, baby, baby, baby, I love, I love you, I love you
I really love you
