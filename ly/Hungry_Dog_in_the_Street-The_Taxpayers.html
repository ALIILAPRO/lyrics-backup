		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A-one, two, three

My brain, my fingers
Bought bottles in a package place
Got caught up, on a park bench
Everybody tried to get a taste

When the sun goes down I swear to God
They'll try to run you out of this town
And they will beat you down

They will beat you down, if you stay around
You're gonna get shot down
They will beat you down
They will beat you down and
You'll feel like a
Hungry dog in the street on
A very short leash

My heart, is a cancer
Radiation wouldn't help a thing
My God, doesn't answer
I pray nightly every single week

When the liquor runs low
My friends run low got nowhere to go

Nowhere to go
No religion could ever save my soul
Nowhere to go
Nowhere to go, and I feel like a
Hungry dog in the street on
A very short leash
