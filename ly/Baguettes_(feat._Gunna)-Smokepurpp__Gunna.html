		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A Lau on the beat!
Lil Purpp bless yo trap
Young Gunna bless yo drip
Oh, yeah

Amiri jeans hold the TEC, that's how I be stylin'
That lil' bitch gimme that neck, take her on an island
A-A-AP with the baguettes, my wrist waterslidin'
Run up that check with the mob, you know that we wylin'
Run up that check with the mob, you know that we wylin'
AP with the baguettes, my wrist waterslidin'
Run up that check with the mob, you know that we wylin'
A-A-AP with the baguettes, my wrist waterslidin'

Please don't tell me these yours, these new Christian Dior
We rich and used to be poor, pay me, that lean I pour it
Left wrist lookin' like Floyd, yeah I know you saw it
Heart prints over my heart, Comme des Gar√ßons
Got in my bag like chips, slap that dick on her lips
Lil Purpp bless yo trap, Young Gunna bless your drip
Me and Drizzy got weed in my lab, it may fill three zips
Chanel belt around my waist, holding up extended clip

Amiri jeans hold the TEC, that's how I be stylin'
That lil' bitch gimme that neck, take her on an island
A-A-AP with the baguettes, my wrist waterslidin'
Run up that check with the mob, you know that we wylin'
Run up that check with the mob, you know that we wylin'
AP with the baguettes, my wrist waterslidin'
Run up that check with the mob, you know that we wylin'
A-A-AP with the baguettes, my wrist waterslidin'

Ran up that check at the mall, we just bought three cars
I can't shop at no mall, I hit Neiman Mar'
Got a big Draco my lap, but I only need two shots
Bitch suck my dick three times, and I ain't even talk
Big smoke, riding 'round town with my wrist froze
Brought that bitch from the strip home
Turn that bitch into a rich hoe (Lil Purpp!)
And I'm still serving them Xannies
Lil' bitch came in with no panties
Boy want beef with my gang though
We gon' hit you and your family

Amiri jeans hold the TEC, that's how I be stylin'
That lil' bitch gimme that neck, take her on an island
A-A-AP with the baguettes, my wrist waterslidin'
Run up that check with the mob, you know that we wylin'
Run up that check with the mob, you know that we wylin'
AP with the baguettes, my wrist waterslidin'
Run up that check with the mob, you know that we wylin'
A-A-AP with the baguettes, my wrist waterslidin'
