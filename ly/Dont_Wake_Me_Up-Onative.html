		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't wake me up when you leave 
I don't feel lonely when I am asleep 
When I'm okay 

I was not around when you were all around, I made you feel cheap 
Now I'm craving what I had but I can never get what I need 
If you only knew how fucked I feel, you'd probably hate to be me 
I've been holding on for long but I'm still not prepared to release 

Don't make feel like you're gone 
Don't make me feel like I'm wrong 
You'll still be here when I'm on 
Don't wake me up when you're gone 

Don't wake, don't wake, don't wake me up
Don't wake, don't wake, don't wake me up
Don't wake, don't wake, don't wake me up
Don't wake, don't wake, don't wake me up

Do we even need to know where we were 2 years ago? 
Keep on knocking on the doors when we know the gates are closed
If this is what you chose 
Won't hold you anymore 
Just don't wake me don't wake me up when you go

Don't make feel like you're gone 
Don't make me feel like I'm wrong 
You'll still be here when I'm on 
Don't wake me up when you're gone 

Don't wake, don't wake, don't wake me up
Don't wake, don't wake, don't wake me up
Don't wake, don't wake, don't wake me up
Don't wake, don't wake, don't wake me up
