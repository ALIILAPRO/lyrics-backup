		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl, the only thing that matters in my life
Is that I'm down for you and treat you right
You've got no call to treat me cold as ice
Oh oh, girl
As long as I've been givin' my love to you
You should be givin' me your love, too
But you just keep on actin' just like a fool
You know it ain't cool

Uh don't be cruel
'Cause I would never be that cruel to you
Uh no, oh oh, no
Uh don't be cruel
Uh girl, you need to change your attitude
Uh no, oh
Uh don't be cruel

Hey yo' Kimmy what's up with this attitude
I thought I was bein' real good to you
I treat you sweet, take you out at night
But you never say thanks girl that ain't right
I bought you diamonds even gave you pearls
I took you for a cruise all around the world
I treat you high post but you play me close
If I want to drink up you won't even toast

Girl, I work so hard for you from 9 to 5
So you could have the finer things in life
Since you're the kind that's never satisfied
Oh oh, girl
As long as I've been givin' my heart to you
You should be givin' me your heart, too
But you just keep on actin' just like a fool
You know it ain't cool

Uh don't be cruel
'Cause I would never be that cruel to you
Uh no, oh oh, no
Uh don't be cruel
Uh girl, you need to change your attitude
Uh no, oh
Uh don't be cruel

From fancy cars to diamond rings
I've just about given you everything
There's really not much I won't do for you
I bought you 12 yellow roses and candy, too
I like be up front and never play the back
But the way you treat me girl is like a heart attack
I'm real troop trooper and with all the times
That you were by my side diggin' dollars outta crock

Oh oh, girl
As long as I've been givin' my love to you
You should be givin' me your love, too
But you just keep on actin' just like a fool
You know it ain't cool
It just ain't cool!

Ow! Don't be cruel

Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh

We used to hang out tough just kickin' around
We discovered a love that had never been found
You gave me your heart I gave you my mind
But a true love affair we could never find
Although I want you bad I could let you go
'Cause there's a lot of girls out there that won't say no
But due to fact that I want you, Jackie
I want you more than human eyes can see
But you had to start givin', tryin' to make a killin'
Thought about the dollars I make and you were willin'
To be with me Bobby B., but with a bad attitude I can't compete
Now you know my name, now I know your game
You want to be with me you got to be the same way
That another girl would be and if you want to be with me

Uh don't be cruel
'Cause I would never be that cruel to you
Uh no, oh oh, no
Uh don't be cruel
Uh girl, you need to change your attitude
Uh no, oh
Uh don't be cruel

'Cause I would never be that cruel to you
Uh no, oh oh, no
Uh don't be cruel
Uh girl, you need to change your attitude
Uh no, oh
