		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is a public service announcement
Sponsored by Just Blaze and the good folks at Roc-A-Fella Records

"Fellow Americans, it is with the utmost pride and sincerity
That I present this recording, as a living testament and recollection
Of history in the making during our generation"

Allow me to reintroduce myself
My name is Hov (oh), H to the O-V
I used to move snowflakes by the O-Z
I guess even back then you can call me
CEO of the R-O-C, Hov
Fresh out the frying pan into the fire
I be the music biz number one supplier
Flier than a piece of paper bearing my name
Got the hottest chick in the game wearing my chain, that's right
Hov (oh), not DOC
But similar to them letters, "No One Can Do it Better"
I check cheddar like a food inspector
My homey Strict told me, "Dude, finish your breakfast"
So that's what I'ma do, take you back to the dude
With the Lexus, fast-forward the jewels and the necklace
Let me tell you dudes what I do to protect this
Shoot at you actors like movie directors
This ain't a movie, dog (oh, shit)

"Now before I finish, let me just say
I did not come here to show out, did not come here to impress you
Because to tell you the truth, when I leave here, I'm gone
And I don't care what you think about me, but just remember
When it hits the fan, brother, whether it's next year, ten years
Twenty years from now, you'll never be able to say
That these brothers lied to you Jack

Ving ain't lie
I done came through the block in everything that's fly
I'm like Che Guevara with bling on, I'm complex
I never claimed to have wings on
Nigga, I get my "by any means" on whenever there's a drought
Get your umbrellas out because that's when I brainstorm
You can blame Shawn, but I ain't invent the game
I just rolled the dice, trying to get some change
And I do it twice, ain't no sense in me
Lying as if I am a different man
And I could blame my environment but
There ain't no reason why I be buying expensive chains
Hope you don't think users are the only abusers
Niggas getting high within the game
If you do then, how would you explain?
I'm ten years removed, still the vibe is in my veins
I got a hustler spirit, nigga, period
Check out my hat, yo, peep the way I wear it
Check out my swag, yo, I walk like a ballplayer
No matter where you go, you are what you are, player
And you can try to change but that's just the top layer
Man, you was who you was 'fore you got here
Only God can judge me, so I'm gone
Either love me or leave me alone

Now, back to our regularly scheduled program
