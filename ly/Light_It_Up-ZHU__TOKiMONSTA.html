		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Always, stop
Always, stop

(Always)
Light it up, don't stop
You got to keep it at my tempo
(Always)
Ride it up, don't stop
You know your body is a temple
(Always)
Light it up (light it up), don't stop
You got to keep it at my tempo
(Always)
Ride it up (ride it up), don't stop
You know your body is a temple

Crush it, roll it, light it, smoke it
Pass it, puff it, hit it, hold it, smoke it
Break it down for me
Come and smoke a pound with me
Crush it, roll it, light it, smoke it
Pass it, puff it, hit it, hold it, smoke it
Break it down for me
Come and smoke a pound with me

Allways, allways
Allways, stop
Al-always, al-always
Al-always, al--, stop

And the people come and go
[?]

Crush it, roll it, light it, smoke it
Pass it, puff it, hit it, hold it, smoke it
Break it down for me
Come and smoke a pound with me
Crush it, roll it, light it, smoke it
Pass it, puff it, hit it, hold it, smoke it
Break it down for me
Come and smoke a pound with me

Al-always, al-always
Al-always, al--, stop
Al-always, al-always
Al-always, al--, sto
