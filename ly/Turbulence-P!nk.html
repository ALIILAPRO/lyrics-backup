		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You and I
Happy ending and a tragedy combined
But we both can't live without it and we tried
We should take our own advice

(Mmm) don't give up
There's a mountain in the middle of the road
It'll take a little longer to get home
Baby, all we've got is time

You can't help when your stomach sinks
See your life happen in a flash (in a flash)
In your head it could be so real
That you almost feel the crash (feel the crash)
The panic is temporary
But I'll be permanent (permanent)
So when it hits, don't forget
As scary as it gets
It's just turbulence

Close your eyes
Pretend you're driving on an bumpy road at night
You can meet me in the corners of your mind (of your mind)
We can build a new cloud nine (cloud nine)

Hey, if you're alive
Then it means that you're committed to survive (survive)
That's enough to drain the life from you sometimes
But I hold on tight

You can't help when your stomach sinks
See your life happen in a flash
In your head it could be so real
That you almost feel the crash (feel the crash, ohh-oh-ohh)
The panic is temporary
But I'll be permanent (permanent)
So when it hits, don't forget
As scary as it gets
It's just turbulence

Hold my hand, hold your breath
And I'll find a place to land
Where you're safe, never break
Where the morning never ends
When you say that you can't
I will watch you dance through this turbulence
It's turbulence

Ohh, you can't help when your stomach sinks
See your life happen in a flash
In your head it could be so real (it could be so real)
That you almost feel the crash
The panic is temporary
But I'll be permanent
So when it hits, don't forget
As scary as it gets
It's just turbulence
It's turbulence
It's just turbulence
