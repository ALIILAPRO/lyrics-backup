		  Uh-huh
Yeah
Check me out, look

(I run this bitch) and I'ma keep runnin
I'ma keep runnin', but I'm never runnin' out of money
I'm a dog, I'ma stunt, if I don't do nothin (yeah, to the ceiling with it, nigga)
And my car so pretty, all these hoes wanna fuck it (high with it, talkin' money, nigga)
I got pussy wet paint (paint), big boy shoes (shoes) (candy with it, five star with it)
Soft-ass seats and my trunk go boom (to the ceiling with it)
Got a black-ass gun and a bad yellow bitch (in the wall with it, nigga)
And it looks like I'ma die like this (let's go, homie)

'Cause we be stuntin' on these bitches, get money on these bitches
Two-fifty on the wrist, nigga, we be the illest
We be the realest, CMB niggas
Uptown soldier with the money to the ceiling
Shinin' like a diamond from a eagle to a pigeon
Birds on the wire, hundred deep and we chillin
Finger on the trigger, that's that uptown livin'
High to the sky, no divin' for fishes
Hustlin', doin' donuts in the Lamb'
Candy on the slab, fifty on the ave
Hundred at the crib, get it how you live
Stuntin' on these bitches, red diamonds how I feel

(I run this bitch) and I'ma keep runnin
I'ma keep runnin', but I'm never runnin' out of money
I'm a dog, I'ma stunt, if I don't do nothin
And my car so pretty, all these hoes wanna fuck it
I got pussy wet paint (paint), big boy shoes (shoes)
Soft-ass seats and my trunk go boom
Got a black-ass gun and a bad yellow bitch (burn one, nigga)
And it looks like I'ma die like this

I'm a uptown soldier, known high roller
Money go getter, M.O.B. all over
Hustlin' with the birds, known to take it off your shoulder
Grindin' with the homies, got the game out the 'Nola
Hundred G's wrapped, hood with a strap
Blowin' on the doja, nigga, stuntin' in a 'Llac
Chicken in the oven, wall safe for the stacks
Bought a brand new Range, and a brand new 'Bach
Old school Caddy, fifth wheel, slab back
A brand new truck, a brand new bike
A brand new house, a brand new psych
A brand new bitch live a hood rich life

(I run this bitch) and I'ma keep runnin
I'ma keep runnin, but I'm never runnin' out of money
I'm a dog, I'ma stunt, if I don't do nothin
And my car so pretty, all these hoes wanna fuck it
I got pussy wet paint (paint), big boy shoes (shoes)
Soft-ass seats and my trunk go boom
Got a black-ass gun and a bad yellow bitch
And it looks like I'ma die like this

I run this shit and I'ma keep runnin
I'ma keep runnin, but I'm never runnin' out of money
I'm a dog, I'ma stunt, if I don't do nothin'
All these hoes wanna fuck it
I got pussy wet paint (paint), big boy shoes (shoes)
Soft-ass seats and my trunk go boom
Got a black-ass gun and a bad yellow bitch
And it looks like I'ma die like this

Another Cash Money classic, ya heard me?
Birdman, Lil Wayne, ya heard?
Them niggas know they gangstas from the hood, ya heard me?
I'm a nigga out the Magnolia, I can claim this, ya heard me?
Them niggas been street, man
We all was raised together, man
Niggas Birdman and Lil Wayne, gangsters for life, nigga
