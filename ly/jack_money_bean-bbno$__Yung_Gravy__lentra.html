		<p>
		  Hey, man, the
(Uh, bbno$)
the fuck you mean, you ain't heard of no fuckin' Lentra the God?

Now my money long, I'm Jack Money Bean (stalk)
Reflect sunshine 'cause my wrist clean (yeah)
I'm a money hoarder, ferment cheese (cheese)
Crossin' every border, can't catch me (woo)
Cashed in ten plus twenty, two shows out in Europe (Europe)
I'm a good fellow 'cause I'm after dinero (Robert)
Married to the money, fingers wrapped in some zeros (zeros)
Married to the money, yeah, wrapped in some zeros

I ain't growin' up
Only fuck with MILFs, I ain't growin' up
And my boy baby glowin' up
Got ya main bitch tryna ho with us
How you know it's us?

Hold up, hold up, let me go in real quick

She want my seed, got the fertilizer, what the fuck you mean?
I need some bread for the appetizer, diamonds lookin' clean
I took the lead, quite the exerciser, runnin' up my fees
I never read, just an analyzer, I'm a special breed
I'm an amethyst analysist, I double up my money like a catalyst
Your silly thottie's booty is a little bit inadequate
I keep my twenty points, I do not think I need no management
I'm better than like half these rappers and I'm still a graduate
I'm eatin' on that bougie fish, I'm only eatin' halibut
Your thottie on that fufu shit, she lookin' like a mannequin
She really use that beak, she toppin' me just like a pelican
Ow, ow, this baby delicate

Now my money long, I'm Jack Money Bean (stalk)
Reflect sunshine 'cause my wrist clean (yeah)
I'm a money hoarder, ferment cheese (cheese)
Crossin' every border, can't catch me (woo)
Cashed in ten plus twenty, two shows out in Europe (Europe)
I'm a good fellow 'cause I'm after dinero (Robert)
Married to the money, fingers wrapped in some zeros (zeros)
Married to the money, yeah, wrapped in some zeros

Got the Ruby Tuesdays goin' up
Baby, got the champagne pourin' up
Gravy put the lime in the coconut
If you got a pinky, throw with us, that's how you know it's us
I divide by zero, hero, never be a ho (whoa)
Got Akira flow, splash like I'm Gyarados
Gravy still nuttin' in your honey like some Cheerios
Sick like venereal, raw, my material
Why you never near a ho? You must have a fear of hoes
I got the pure opposite of femina-phobia
Wrist Patek-agonia, bitch, it was nice knowin' ya
Y todos de los días Gravy chupa con tu novia
Y tengo mucho frío como la neumonía

Now my money long, I'm Jack Money Bean (stalk)
Reflect sunshine 'cause my wrist clean (yeah)
I'm a money hoarder, ferment cheese (cheese)
Crossin' every border, can't catch me (woo)
Cashed in ten plus twenty, two shows out in Europe (Europe)
I'm a good fellow 'cause I'm after dinero (Robert)
Married to the money, fingers wrapped in some zeros (zeros)
Married to the money, yeah, wrapped in some zeros
