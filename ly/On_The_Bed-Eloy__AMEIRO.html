		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What you say now?
Babe I got you feeling down yeah
There was nothing left before you found me
Didn't know what this was coming to
Didn't know where we was running to
Ey
Oh my baby would you dare?
Oh my baby would you care?
And oh my baby on the bed
But she don't know

Baby I don't know if we can make it
But baby I would lie now
If it was some other time
We would definitely try now
Baby did we fucked up?
It ain't easy all this though love
No it ain't easy
It's sitting deeply
It's sitting deeply
But baby we could figure this out

Feeling that you falling
Got the feeling that you love it
Seeing that you want this
Then what you call this?

What you say now?
Babe I got you feeling down, yeah
There was nothing left before you found me
Didn't know what this was coming to
Didn't know what we was running to
Ey
Oh my baby would you dare?
Oh my baby would you care?
And oh my baby on the bed
But she don't know, yeah

She don't know
Na na na na
Oh oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
My baby would you be there
Would you dare?
