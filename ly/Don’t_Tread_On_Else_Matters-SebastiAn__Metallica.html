		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
Settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore

Don't tread on me
Said, don't tread on me

Love it or leave it, she with the deadly bite
Quick is the blue tongue, forked as the lightning strike
Shining with brightness, always on surveillance
The eyes, they never close, emblem of vigilance

Don't tread on me
Said, don't tread on me

Don't tread on me
Said, don't tread on me

Don't tread on me
Said, don't tread on me

So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they say
Never cared for the games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know
