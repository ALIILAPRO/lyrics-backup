		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Only take pictures to remember shit
Heavy duty pills, boy I don't remember shit
Give a fuck if it's cliché, I love Actavis
I told that bitch I'm Mayweather
With this rappin' shit

Only take pictures to remember shit
Heavy duty pills, boy I don't remember shit
Give a fuck if it's cliché, I love Actavis
I told that bitch I'm Mayweather
With this rappin' shit
And shout out all the good girls
Who know I ain't shit
But still be on my dick
With piercings on their clit
Rose gold rope chain look like some licorice
But you can't lick on this
Hell nah girl you can't lick on this
I got a chill cuban mami
And she is straight from Vogue
I pop the veins on her neck and
She pop me like she rode
And she gon' do them pretty toes
While I sit back and toast
Finesse a pearl blunt on the California coast
These niggas test my sins
But they old testaments
Came back from Texas smelling like
Some Fendi breath mints
Called up some sexy hoes
Drugs and refreshments and nah
I ain't drinking shit but meet
Me at the Westin
I'ma pull up right after this studio session
I'm late as fuck, she asking 21 questions
Now we havin' sex
It started out from wrestling
She give me brain I blow her brain
No Smith & Wesson
Beamer to an Audi, a Lexus off a pill again
Our dope must be gone as
Fuck because the ceiling missin'
Play Baywatch with these hoes
And these niggas just my children
Grandaddy frustrated with me
He think I don't listen
But it's my life and I took
That risk cause it's my decision
Ayy, look fuck my fucking feelings aim
It at you with precision
I say I'm chillin' with these hoes
But I ain't really chillin'
And my e mail inbox is worth
At least like 10 million

Ayy, snap that polaroid cause
I wanna remember this ayy, flip that phone
Flip that flick I wanna remember this
Ayy, Miami
Record this shit bro I wanna remember this
And rich boy flare got me lookin'
Vintage I wanna remember this
Sextapes on my phone
Shawty you remember this?
Ayy, you remember this? Ayy
Do you remember that?
You remember this? Ayy do you remember that?
Ayy, you remember this? Do you remember that?
Ayy do you remember that?
Do you remember that?
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, you remember that?
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy do you remember?

Ayy I know she a freak
Cause she a free spirit
She dream to go long as her
Fucking friends don't hear it
And there's some niggas who are fed
They want me fucking dead
Finesse me out my bread
Boy that shit's so dead
I ain't replyin' to your text but
You just know it's read
And I know a couple blue niggas
Who might leave you red
Uh, yeah, remember that, remember that
Remember that
Ayy, ayy, ayy, I'm off an Addy ayy, ayy
Two shots I down it
Ayy, ayy, ayy, three shots I down it
Boy I'm my fucking plug
And I'll go kill the plug off a fucking drug
I'm off these fucking drugs
But I feel good as fuck
Got True Religion love
You cannot fuck with us
You just can't fuck with us
