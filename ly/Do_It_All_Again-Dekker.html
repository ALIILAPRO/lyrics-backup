		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Standing on the other side
What do you see?
What do you see in me?

Pretending that it's all alright
How do we know
Real or fantasy

Patience
All that we can muster
Bring it to the surface
From the underground

Wasted
Oh, so many chances
All I had, I squandered
I didn't understand
I didn't understand

Floating on a moon-led tide
Where we'll go
Is where we need to be

It's difficult to recognize
What it is
That holds you here with me

Patience
All that we can muster
Bring it to the surface
From the underground

Wasted
Oh, so many chances
All I had, I squandered
I didn't understand

Patience
All that we can muster
Bring it to the surface
From the underground

Wasted
Oh, so many chances
All I had, I squandered
I didn't understand
I didn't understand
I didn't understand
I'd do it all again
I'd do it all again
