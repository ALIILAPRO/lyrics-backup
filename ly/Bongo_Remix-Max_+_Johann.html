		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mama was queen of the mambo
Papa was king of the Congo
Deep down in a jungle
I started banging my first bongo

Every monkey like to be
In my place instead of me
'Cause I'm the king of Bongo, baby
I'm the king of Bongo Bong

I went to the big town
Where there is a lot of sound
From the jungle to the city
Looking for a bigger crown

So I play my Boogie
For the people of big city
But they don't go crazy
When I'm banging all my boogie
I'm the

(King of the Bongo)
(King of the Bongo bong)
Hear me when I come, baby
(King of the Bongo)
(King of the Bongo Bong)
(Hear me when I come)

Nobody likes to be
In my place instead of me
'Cause nobody go crazy
When I'm banging on my boogie

I'm a king without a crown
Hanging loose in a big town
But I'm the king of Bongo, baby
I'm the king of Bongo Bong

(King of the Bongo)
(King of the Bongo bong)
Hear me when I come, baby
(King of the Bongo)
(King of the Bongo Bong)
Hear me when I come

They said that I'm a clown
Making too much dirty sound
They said there is no place
For little monkey in this town

Nobody liked to be
In my place instead of me
'Cause nobody go crazy
When I'm banging on my boogie
I'm the

(King of the Bongo)
(King of the Bongo bong)
Hear me when I come, baby
(King of the Bongo)
(King of the Bongo Bong)
Hear me when I come

Banging on my bongo
All that swing belongs to me
I'm so happy there's nobody
In my place instead of me

I'm a king without a crown
Hanging loose in a big town
I'm the king of Bongo, baby
I'm the king of Bongo Bong

(King of the Bongo)
King of the Bongo bong)
Hear me when I come, baby
(King of the Bongo)
(King of the Bongo Bong)
Hear me when I come

Mama was queen of the mambo
Papa was king of the Congo
Deep down in a jungle
I started banging my first bongo

Every monkey like to be
In my place instead of me
'Cause I'm the king of Bongo, baby
I'm the king of Bongo Bong

Hear me when I come
(King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong)
Hear me when I come, baby
(King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong)
Hear me when I come
