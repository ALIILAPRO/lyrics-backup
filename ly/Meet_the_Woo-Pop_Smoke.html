		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (This is a Melo beat)

Baby girl, come and meet the woo
She know we keep a tool
Big knockin' on my body
Watch who you speaking to
(Girl, watch who you speaking to)
Baby girl, come and meet the woo
Big knockin' on my body
The beat went off?

I call Ace Makaveli, got treesh in the deli
Shawty wan' fuck off a glass of some Henny
Don't call my phone, got the feds on my celly
Flight to Miami, put dick in her belly
Wanna make bread, tell her open up Welly
TD, OA, Tander, Citi, Chevy
Pull up in Rovers, catch him it's over, spinin' like Julius Sover
Shoot down Hawthorne, shooting like Korver, put that boy head on his shoulders
Swervin', give em' two shots if he twerlin', uh
Burn him, I promise it's gon' be a murder
If I catch him I hurt him, slide him I murk him, look at that boy lookin' nervous
I got one thing for sure, I got two things for certain, wrap that boy up in a curtain, uh
Touchy, I dropped 38 on this touchy
I made a flip off this uppy
I turned that boy to a duppy, uh
Balmain, true blue, ocean, mystery, potion, back out
Toast him, Pop Smoke, run him, over, over, over (err)

Baby girl, come and meet the woo
She know we keep a tool
Big knockin' on my body 
Watch who you speakin' to
(Girl, watch who you speaking to)
Baby girl, come and meet the woo
Big knockin' on my body
Watch who you speakin' to
