		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't believe it
White girl got some ass
I wanna see it
Black girl got a ass
It ain't a secret
Baby turn around
I wanna see it, tryin' to see it, gotta see it
I wanna see that babu iam bam, baram bam baram
Babu iam bam, baram bam baram

Uh, I think I found one 'cause I got that fever of Britney
Gotta self around one, ass like Serena, that's okay
'Cause I love my stereotypes, my girls in tools
That maximum exposure Rose know what I wanna do,
Telling all the girls, all around the world,my last name must be Robin
'cause I'm basking in these asses, all thirty flavours keep calling,
My my my my vanilla Cinderella love it when I tell her drop it,
My butter pick but I love my chocolate

I can't believe it
White girl got some ass
I wanna see it
Black girl got a ass
It ain't a secret
Baby turn around
I wanna see it, tryin' to see it, gotta see it
I wanna see that babu iam bam, baram bam baram
Babu iam bam, baram bam baram
Babu iam bam, baram bam baram
Babu iam bam, baram bam baram

She got that butt donk-donkie-donkie
They so fat, they so chunky,
Call me Michael Jackson, hi hi
'Cause I love to play with monkies,
This the Miami thing, that's right
We down for anything that's right,
Youtube everything, that's right
Flow right to Pitbull anything,
I'm off the chain and lane lane, lane lane

Ustedes saben quien es quien
Mira esa gringa con toda esa nalga
Como tu sabes estoy loco.
Pero que bueno que era poco,
Mami mueve los coco,
I don't care where you're from
As long as you got that babu bam

I can't believe it
White girl got some ass
I wanna see it
Black girl got a ass
It ain't a secret
Baby turn around
I wanna see it, tryin' to see it, gotta see it
I wanna see that babu iam bam, baram bam baram
Babu iam bam, baram bam baram
Babu iam bam, baram bam baram
Babu iam bam, baram bam baram

Now turn left, turn right
Turn around you could tell what I like
She love good, she so bad
She kick it up, drop it down, look back.

Babu iam bam, baram bam baram
Babu iam bam, baram bam baram
Babu iam bam, baram bam baram
Babu iam bam, baram bam baram

I can't believe it
White girl got some ass
I wanna see it, baram bam baram.
I can't believe it
White girl got some ass
I wanna see it, baram bam baram.

I can't believe it
White girl got some ass
I wanna see it, baram bam baram.
I can't believe it
White girl got some ass
I wanna see it, baram bam baram.
