		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a place I used to go
There's a world I used to know
There was a light and it was you
Every word I say is true
I say - 

every day I will wait - till you?re mine again
I will die every day - till you?re mine again
There?s no words to explain - no beginning and no end
I will dream, I will pray - you?ll be mine again

I can see you dressed in red
All the secret things you said
Lying barefoot in the grass
Now my heart is in your hands
Your hands - 

every day I will wait - till you?re mine again
I will die every day - till you?re mine again
There?s no words to explain - no beginning and no end
I will dream, I will pray - you?ll be mine again

it's just time that runs between us
It's the ocean underneath us
It's the picture that won't fade away

every day I will wait - you?ll be mine again
Brings me close to the day - you?ll be mine again
There?s no words to explain - no beginning and no end
I will dream, I will pray - you?ll be mine again
