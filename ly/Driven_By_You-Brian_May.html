		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woh everything I do I do for you 
Ow
Oh yeah

We touch and you're afraid of me 
And we burn and now I'm at your feet 
High speed, but you know you're in safe hands 
Oh, in the dark we make a brighter light 
From one spark to the horizon wide 
We trust, and together we tame the land, yeah 

Oh you'd be forgiven if you think you're dreaming 
But we're working night and day to make a dream come true, yeah 
Everything I do is driven by you 
Oh, come on babe 

Oh well it's tough to make a journey through 
The right stuff is dead ahead of you and me 
And you know we still got time
Whoo, hold on tight to the driving wheel 
This ride is really out of line 
Raw deal, but there's no other that's worth a dime

You know I love you but you drive me crazy 
'Cause you're saying all the things I want to say to you
(You say) everything I do is driven by you 
Everything we do, oh yeah, everything we do 
Everything we do, everything we do 
Everything we do is driven by you

Inner children lost their way 
Now they know the price you pay 
I'm holding on to life with you 
'Cause life without you just won't do 

Driven by you 

Ah, you know we're never gonna know who's dreaming 
But we're working night and day to make the dream come true yeah
Everything I do is driven by you 
Everything we do, everything we do, everything we do
Yeah everything we do, everything we do, yeah everything we do 
Everything we do, everything we do, everything we do
Is driven by, driven by, driven by you 

Yeah
Oh everything I do, I do for you
