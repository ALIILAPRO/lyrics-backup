		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Had a little trip with my best friends
Had a little trouble on the West end
Went to see my girl from the North side
Told me that it's mine but there's no ties
Had a little trip with my best friends
Had a little trouble on the West end
Went to see my girl from the North side
Told me that it's mine but there's no ties

No ties
Weed and Hennessey make your waist whine
Girl you know your hips tell me no lies
Tell me that it's mine but there's no ties
No Ties
Weed and Hennessey make your waist whine
Girl you know your hips tell me no lies
Tell me that it's mine but it's no ties

Letsha o balabala, re dhowe
Ntshware ka letsogo re dhowe
Okhebe okhe nagana ka maadha
O dhoba wa ota ka maadha
Hennessey, Ciroc
Hennessey, Ciroc
Tsewe di letshe le nna
Akere the bill is on me

On me
I won't even lie yeah it's on me
Who gon' bring the vibe? Yeah it's on me
Make ya come alive, yeah, it's all me
This gon' make her dance like a zombie
This gon' make her dance with it on me
See that in my pants it's a army
But I ain't got the .9 milli' on me
That's on me
On me
It's one of those times
Feeling this fresh should be a crime
West side this, let's not waste time
Come here little thing, make your waist whine
Let's get take but with no ties
Sit shotgun, just let me drive
You know I swipe every time
That's on me
Yeah that's on me

Had a little trip with my best friends
Had a little trouble on the West end
Went to see my girl from the North side
Told me that it's mine but there's no ties
Had a little trip with my best friends
Had a little trouble on the West end
Went to see my girl from the North side
Told me that it's mine but there's no ties

No ties
Weed and Hennessey make your waist whine
Girl you know your hips tell me no lies
Tell me that it's mine but there's no ties
No Ties
Weed and Hennessey make your waist whine
Girl you know your hips tell me no lies
Tell me that it's mine but it's no ties

Letsha o balabala, re dhowe
Ntshware ka letsogo re dhowe
Okhebe okhe nagana ka maadha
O dhoba wa ota ka maadha
Hennessey, Ciroc
Hennessey, Ciroc
Tsewe di letshe le nna
Akere the bill is on me

Danc'a, danc'a
Danc'a, danc'a
Bathori nyakela kgole
Rona revibela kgole
That's why kere Hennessey, Ciroc
Hennessey, Ciroc
Tjewe di let≈°he le nna 
Akeri the bill is on me

No-no-no ties
Weed and Hennessey make your waist whine
Girl you know your hips tell me no lies
Tell me that it's mine but there's no ties
No Ties
Weed and Hennessey make your waist whine
Girl you know your hips tell me no lies
Tell me that it's mine but it's no ties

Letsha o balabala, re dhowe
Ntshware ka letsogo re dhowe
Okhebe okhe nagana ka maadha
O dhoba wa ota ka maadha
Hennessey, Ciroc
Hennessey, Ciroc
Tsewe di letshe le nna
Akere the bill is on me
