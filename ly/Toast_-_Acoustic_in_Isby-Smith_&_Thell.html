		<p>
		  Oh mama mama
I've been sad most of my life
Since you left me
There is not much left to love
But I've been thinking
I think it's time to cheer things up

Oh lover lover
You taught me loads about this heart
Like why our ribs they, look a lot like prison bars
But I've been thinking
I think it's time to cheer things up in here

So let's toast for all the bad times
Toast for all the hard nights
Toast for all the douchebags that's been breaking our hearts
Toast for too much feelings
Toast for all our demons
Cause honey bunny one day we'll be gone
So we better TOAST


Oh papa papa
You know I can't just shake things of
But I see the lows now
As a trampoline straight up
Cause I've been thinking
I think it's time to live for once

So let's toast for all the bad times
Toast for all the hard nights
Toast for all the douchebags that's been breaking our hearts
Let's toast for too much feelings
Toast for all our demons
Cause honey bunny one day we'll be gone
So we better TOAST
