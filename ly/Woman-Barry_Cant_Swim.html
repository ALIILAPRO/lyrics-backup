		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We had blind faith
But we've got new ways
Let the power ricochet
Let the truth stay

When the people got the power
When the people got the power
When the people got the power (when the people got the power)
You see a human
I see a God

When the people got the power (when the people got the power)
You see a human
I see a God

When the people got the power (when the people got the power)
You see a human
I see a God

When the people got the power (when the people got the power)
You see a human
I see a God

You see a human (when the people got the power)
I see a God
You see a human
I see a God
You see a human (when the people got the power)
I see a God
You see a human
I see a God

When the people got the power (when the people got the power)
You see a human
I see a God
When the people got the power (when the people got the power)
You see a human
I see a God
When the people got the power (when the people got the power)
When the people got the power (when the people got the power)
