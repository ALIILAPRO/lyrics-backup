		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Under bad signs we were born
Into families that had sworn up and down
They would keep us safe
Yeah, okay
And I'm classically sad and I'm inclined to get mad
And I dwell upon mistakes that I've made
It keeps me awake at night
The realization that I might be a drag
That no one wants to inhale

Don't leave me here, where my fears
Consume my thoughts, of what was
And what could have been, it's a sin

That I threw it all away
When I hurt myself again
Yeah, I hurt myself again
When I hurt myself again
I'll pretend it was just an accident
Until I hurt myself again
Yeah, I hurt myself again
When I hurt myself again
I'll admit I got problems
Yeah, show me someone who don't

Most of the time
I'm convinced I survived
And that's fine
But it's far from ideal, but I'll deal
I wish that I had all the things that they have
So I could feed this void in my chest
'Cause kids are so unkind
To kids of different kinds
And I promise that I'm not okay
(Oh, wait, that's the other guy)

Don't leave me here, where my fears
Consume my thoughts, of what was
And what could have been, it's a sin

That I threw it all away
Just to hurt myself again
Yeah, I hurt myself again
When I hurt myself again
And l pretend it was just an accident
'Til I hurt myself again
Yeah, I hurt myself again
When I hurt myself again
I'll admit I got problems

Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa

Please don't leave my sight
Give me all the love you have
I need it more than the air in my lungs
