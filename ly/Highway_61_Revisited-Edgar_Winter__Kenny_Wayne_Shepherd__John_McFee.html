		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son" 
Abe said, "Man, you must be puttin' me on" 
God said, "No"--Abe say, "What?" 
God say, "You can do what you want, Abe, but 
The next time you see me comin', you better run" 
Well, Abe said, "Where d'you want this killin' done?" 
God said, "Out on Highway 61" 

Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose 
Welfare department, they wouldn't give him no clothes 
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?" 
Howard said, "There's only one place I know" 
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man, I got to run" 
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun 
And said, "That way, down Highway 61" 

Well, Mack the Finger said to Louie the King 
"I got 40 red-white-and-blue shoestrings 
And a thousand telephones that don't ring 
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?" 
And Louie the King said, "Let me think for a moment, son" 
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done 
Just take everything down to Highway 61" 

Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night 
Told the first father that things weren't right 
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white" 
He said, "Come here and step into the light" 
He said, "Hmm, you're right, let me tell the second mother this has been done" 
But the second mother was with the seventh son 
And they were both out on Highway 61 

Now, the roving gambler he was very bored 
Trying to create a next world war 
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor 
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before 
But yes, I think it can be very easily done 
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun 
And have it on Highway 61"
