		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Past lives couldn't ever come between us
Sometimes the dreamer finally wake up
Don't wake me up, I'm not dreamin'
Don't wake me up, I'm not dreamin'
Yeah
Welcome back to my life
Say hello to all these fake emotions
Hiding under a broken disguise
If you see me smiling just ignore that
'Cause I know that I'm dying inside
I'm broken again and this time
Love, friends and pills won't take away all this pain
All I've been trying to do is survive this wave
A wave full heart attacks and emotions
Loving this girl was a fucking mistake
My life was already a mess
Thanks to her for throwing everything away
Wasted the energy I had with her
Beautiful times that I'll never regret
All the flirts and goodnight messages
Are stuck in my heart and my head
But it just hurts me to see her go away
Shit, it kills me to see her so happy with all of her friends
When I can barely enjoy 5 minutes without think of her
I'm always at home trying to overcome all these demons inside of my head
That's something she'll never understand
I'm broken and depressed
And I know she happy without me
Man, I swear to god If I just could rewind time
And fix all the mistakes I made
I Promise my life would be straight
But never again, never again on trusting a girl with my heart
This shit fucking killed me mentally and emotionally broke me apart
So never again, never again on trusting a girl with my heart
Why does it always have to be
The nicest people that get hurt the most
Why? just why?
