		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I said goodbye to you today
Then had a cigarette sat and saw your plane
Make a circle 'round my head
I watched reality dance above the cherry
Of the Parliament I said
That I would quit but I can’t
When you’re gone I can’t
Depend on anyone else
I tried not to be afraid
You said it’s bad for my (Health)
It’s bad for my health

We’re all waiting to die
And I’m just dying to wait
For you to fly back
I left my heart at the gate
We’re all waiting to die
I hope it’s not too late
If you don’t ever come back
I’ve got a rope just in case

It's an inevitability that
The technology that we create will eventually
Turn on u- turn on us
An army that's similar to that
Of us creating firmed humans
Inside, protecting the metalworks
Speaking of alternate reality
From which they return
Sho- Should we be honest from the inside out?
There is no escape, no one is safe
