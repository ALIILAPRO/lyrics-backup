		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Big shot, so what? Do you wanna pretend?
You took the money, but the money couldn't buy a friend

Now I want you to leave me alone
They say the devil that you know 
Is better than the devil that you don't
Oh, you're a big shot here but nobody else knows
Now I want you to leave me alone

Blind spot, take your best shot, lucky me
Go fly a kite until you're tangled in the hanging tree

Now I want you to leave me alone
They say the devil that you know 
Is better than the devil that you don't
Oh, you're a big shot here but nobody else knows
Now I want you to leave me alone

Four in the morning but we're having such a lovely time
Mad as a hatter with a dagger and a dollar sign
Aristocrat, tip your hat and break your mother's heart
And when the sun comes up you'll find a brand new God
(Hey, come on)
(A brand new God)
(Oh, oh)

Now I want you to leave me alone
They say the devil that you know 
Is better than the devil that you don't
Oh, you're a big shot here, but nobody else knows
Now I want you to leave me alone
