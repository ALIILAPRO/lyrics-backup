		  What, say one word and you die
And I'll make you see

You, you never see the death

So, you better step back
Cause I ain't gonna tell
To why you ? pain
What, and all I say is strong
To you and your whore
I tell you I gonna kick you died

And now I'll broke down
Feel in together world
I'll take it to me
Asshole are shove me down

(Hey), do you never let it go ? my toward pain
If I tell, knuckleduster beat you six feed under
(So), so I kill you as fucking insane and I swear you see it again
Did you know, knuckleduster beat you six feed under

And now I'll broke down
Feel in together world

If I tell, knuckleduster beat you six feed under
