		  One more time
Walk with me and put your hand
Into mine
It's 12am we're underneath the midnight sky
Yea I got you right here with me it feels so right
Yea we been walking under the stars For so long
Yea we been talking bout everything we long for
Yea it's just you and I
Yea I'd love it if you'd be mine
(Only you)
I can't get you out of my mind
I love you more than all the stars in the sky
Deep conversations always happen at night
I think the only thing we can do it try
Your name echos inside of my mind
I just can't let go
I'm holding you tight
I'm not good at saying goodbyes
So just stay with me one more night
One last time
Lay with me right here I'll tell you it's alright
It's 4am and we're having the time of our lives
We're dancing in the pouring rain it feels so nice
Yea we've been walking under the stars for so long
Yea we've been talking bout everything we long for
Yea it's you in my arms
Yea girl you can have my heart
(Only you)
I can't get you out of my mind
I love you more than all the stars in the sky
Deep conversations always happen at night
I think the only thing we can do it try
(Only you)
I can't get you out of my mind
I love you more than all the stars in the sky
Deep conversations always happen at night
I love you more than all the stars in the sky
