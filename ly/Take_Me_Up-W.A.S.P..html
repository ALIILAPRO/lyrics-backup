		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Close your eyes, make me last forever
Hold inside, immortal mine
Close my eyes, lay me down in heaven
Embrace my lie, your sole in time

Won't you take me up inside you
Am I more than you can take
I'll be your father's heart of darkness
When you wake
Black blood is pounding drive your
Heart through my stake
Slide up inside you 'til your
Heart starts to break

Won't you take me up inside you
Am I more than you can take
Hide me deep inside and let me
Be the one forsaken
Won't you take me up inside you
'Couse ther's no more I can wait
Hold me in your eyes until there's
No more of you that I can take

Is it taste of bloody kisses
Is it more than you can fake
Feel me deep inside you
Is it your faith that I shake
Forgive me father for your
Sins that I break
My hand to the promised land
Your soul that I pray

Won't you take me up inside you
Am I more than you can take
Hide me deep inside and let me
Be the one forsaken
Won't you take me up inside you
'Couse ther's no more I can wait
Hold me in your eyes until there's
No more of you that I can take

Won't you take me up inside you
Am I more than you can take
Hide me deep inside and let me
Be the one forsaken
Won't you take me up inside you
'Couse ther's no more I can wait
Hold me in your eyes until there's
No more of you that I can take
Take
Take
No more of you that I can take
