		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just wanna have it
Want you for myself
For the good time stories

Before I thought I'd die
I was feeling strong
Now I'm getting out of time
Out of
Out of time, out of time
Out of time, out of time

(Out of time, out of time)
Out of time, out of time

I get drunk all the time
Everyday on rewind
I feel good, I feel fine
It's just me, me and I

(Out of time, out of time)
Out of time, out of time

Before I thought I'd die
I was feeling strong
Now I'm getting out of time
Out of
Out of time, out of time
Out of time, out of time

(Out of time, out of time)
Out of time, out of time

I get drunk all the time
Everyday on rewind
I feel good, I feel fine
It's just me, me and I

(Out of time, out of time)
