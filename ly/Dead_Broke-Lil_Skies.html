		<p>
		  I think you know
What I want for you
Just do what's for you
I'll be proud of you
I think you know
What I want for you
Just do what's for you
I'll be proud of you
Ayy, uh, uh-uh
Uh, uh-uh, uh, uh-uh
Uh, uh-uh, uh, uh-uh
Uh, uh-uh
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

Ridin' with my brother to the end, that's for sure
If you got a problem, nigga, please let me know
Shawty wasn't with me when I was dead broke
That's the reason why I had to let her go
Ridin' with my brother to the end, that's for sure
If you got a problem, nigga, please let me know
Shawty wasn't with me when I was dead broke
That's the reason why I had to let her go

Stress on my mind, had to pour me up a four
I be gettin' high just to balance out the lows
Coppers on my ass so I had to get low
I would never change, I be posted by the store
Me and Stan juggin', used to sell a lotta dope
Say he want the good, want the white, want the snow
Packs comin' in, had to get 'em off the boat
Stack a lot of bread, gotta keep it by the loaf

Ridin' with my brother to the end, that's for sure
If you got a problem, nigga, please let me know
Shawty wasn't with me when I was dead broke
That's the reason why I had to let her go
Ridin' with my brother to the end, that's for sure
If you got a problem, nigga, please let me know
Shawty wasn't with me when I was dead broke
That's the reason why I had to let her 

I spend too much
Too much time on you
Girl, what you gon' do?
Ride for me, ride for you
I think you know
What I want for you
Just do what's for you
I'll be proud of you

Ridin' with my brother to the end, that's for sure
If you got a problem, nigga, please let me know
Shawty wasn't with me when I was dead broke
That's the reason why I had to let her go
Ridin' with my brother to the end, that's for sure
If you got a problem, nigga, please let me know
Shawty wasn't with me when I was dead broke
That's the reason why I had to let her go

Too much
