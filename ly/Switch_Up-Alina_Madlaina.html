		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Used to be
Easy to love
Everything you told me I trust
You used to be all about ‘us’
If you had a change in your heart
I hope you know

That wasn’t very “I’d never switch up on you” of you
That wasn’t very “I’d never hurt you baby it’s true
You’re confusing
Way too many versions of you
So confusing


Tell me if ya tryna let me go,
You never were somebody I could own
So I’m gonna let you grow
Tell me if ya tryna let me go
You never were somebody I could own
So I’m gonna let you grow

Wreckless, wreckless
Way too busy in your exes mentions
It’s about to get offensive, you’ll regret this?
Cuz I won’t fight for ya attention
Showing ya colours and they ain’t cute

What happened to
“I’d never switch it up on you boo”
That wasn’t very “I’d never hurt you baby it’s true
You’re confusing
Way too many versions of you
You’re so confusing

Tell me if ya tryna let me go,
You never were somebody I could own
So I’m gonna let you grow
Tell me if ya tryna let me go
You never were somebody I could own
So I’m gonna let you grow
