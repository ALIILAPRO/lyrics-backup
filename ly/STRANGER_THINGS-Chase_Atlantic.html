		<p>
		  Yeah
Probably shouldn't call, it's the worst time
I been up for days and my brain's fried, yeah
Don't mistake me for a wise guy (wise guy)
But if I brought the drugs, then they're all mine
I can't believe what they've done to me, yeah
She's onto me, shit, I'm kinda freaked out
It's three degrees, I can barely breathe, yeah
It's getting weirder

But stranger things have happened in the nighttime (nighttime, woo)
The way that things are going, shit I might die (yeah)
These chemicals you brought me got me sky high
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
But stranger things have happened in the nighttime (woo)

(Yeah, yeah, yeah oh yeah)
Lying on the floor with a nosebleed
Girl, just take it easy, maybe don't breathe
I been fuckin' wild, yeah, I'm so deep
Everyone around me getting no sleep, but
I take it all, yeah, I take it all
It's Adderall, bouncing wall to wall, yeah
It's not my fault that she's this involved
It's getting weird now

But stranger things have happened in the nighttime (nighttime, woo)
The way that things are going, shit I might die (yeah)
These chemicals you brought me got me sky high
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
But stranger things have happened in the nighttime (woo)

But stranger things have happened in the nighttime
The way that things are going, shit I might die (woo, woo, yeah, woo)
These chemicals you brought me got me sky high
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah (woo)
But stranger things have happened in the nighttime (woo)
