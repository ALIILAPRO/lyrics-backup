		  Come on, feet, start moving
Got to get me there
Hey, hey
Uh-huh, huh, huh, huh, oh
Uh-huh, huh, huh, huh, yeah
Oh

Twenty-five miles from home, girl
My feet are hurting mighty bad
Now, I've been walking for three days and two lonely nights
You know that I'm mighty mad, huh

But I got a woman waiting for me
That's gonna make this trip worthwhile
You see she's got the kind of loving and a kissing
A-make a man go stone wild

So I got to keep on walking, mm-hmm, huh
I got to walk on, oh, ho, ho
(I-i, I-I, I, I, I) I'm so tired
(I-i, I-I, I, I, I) but I just can't lose my stride

I got fifteen miles to go now
And I can hear my baby calling my name
It's as if as though I'm standing at her front door
I can hear her, that's doggone plain

Now I'll be so glad to see my baby
And hold her in my arms one more time, huh
Now when I kiss her lips, I turn a back over flip
And I forget about these feet of mine

I got to keep on walking, hey, ooh
I got to walk on, let me tell, y'all
(I-i, I-I, I, I, I) I'm so tired, huh
(I-i, step on, keep on steepin') but I just can't lose my stride

Come on, feet, don't fail me now (come on, feet, don't stop)
I got ten more miles to go (ten more miles)
I got nine (step on, step on)
Eight (step on, step on)
Seven (step on, step on)
Six, six, six (step on, step on)

I got five more miles to go, now
Over the hill, just around the bend, huh
Although my feet are tired, I can't lose my stride
I got to get to my baby again

I got to keep on walking, mm-hmm, hey
I got to walk on, please let me ya, y'all
(I-i, I-I, I, I, I) I'm so tired, huh
(I-i, step on, keep on steepin') but I just can't lose my stride

(Walking) yeah, huh
I got to walk on, let me ya, y'all
(I-i, I-I, I, I, I) I see, my baby just across the bend
(I-i, step on, keep on steepin')

(Walking) hey, hey now
I got to walk on, let me tell ya, y'all, gotta say
(I-i, I-I, I, I, I) I been steppin' since the sun came up
