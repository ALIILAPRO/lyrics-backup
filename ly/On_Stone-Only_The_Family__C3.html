		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (BasedKash drippin' sauce)

On stone, on, stone, on stone
On stone, on, stone, on stone (gang, gang)
On stone, on, stone, on stone
On stone, on, stone, on stone (gang bang)
On stone, on, stone, on stone
On stone, on, stone, on stone (gang, gang)
On stone, on, stone, on stone
On stone, on, stone, on stone (gang bang)

This some gang gang shit
This some gang bang shit
You can't come up on my block
If you don't gang bang bitch

And I mean what I say when I say gang in this bitch
Like a hunnid it ain't shit to get you changed in this bitch

On stone I'll shoot this bitch up
Nigga try it, nigga try it
Then you dying, I ain't lying
That's on five
Four, three, two, one
Better have your gun
I Got a switch and a drum
Pussy better run

Free murder out that jam I hope his case drop
Bitch I am what I am I'm from every block
I dare a pussy try to slide try to shake something
Have Lil Mo in the cut he tryna something

On stone, on, stone, on stone
On stone, on, stone, on stone (gang, gang)
On stone, on, stone, on stone
On stone, on, stone, on stone (gang bang)
On stone, on, stone, on stone
On stone, on, stone, on stone (gang, gang)
On stone, on, stone, on stone
On stone, on, stone, on stone (gang bang)
