		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just like an ocean has it waves
I've done things I just can't change
And just like clouds are full of rain
I carry with me all this extra weight I've got to let it drain

If you have nothing to die for
What are you even alive for?
Yeah, there's birds in the trees
And they're singing for me
When the night falls
That the sunrise won't be nothing like yesterday

And you can call me fool
But I hope this song's for you
If it's not quite enough
I'll find another line or two
If I just had someone
To sing it to

If it's not quite enough
I'll find another line or two
If I just had someone
To sing it to

I keep a voice inside my head
I keep a voice inside my head
I keep a voice inside my head
