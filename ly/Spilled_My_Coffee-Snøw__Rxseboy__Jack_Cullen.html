		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Spilled my coffee on my T-Shirt
I caught the wrong train (And it's slow)
Spilled my coffee on my T-Shirt
I caught the wrong train
(And it's slow, slow, slow)

Spilled my coffee on my t-shirt
I was on my way to meet
You now I gotta return
Anyways I forgot the bud that
We said we'd burn
So don't be mad, baby I'll be fast
Fuck a train, I'ma drive to where you at
Baby, you're so beautiful I love
It when you laugh
And that's exactly what you did when
I pulled up in my whip
Told me to look down and I felt so ridiculous

Spilled my coffee on my T-Shirt
I caught the wrong train (And it's slow)
Spilled my coffee on my T-Shirt
I caught the wrong train
(And it's slow, slow, slow)

Yeah, bottle your feelings and
You pour your tea
You know me, I'ma wear my heart on my sleeve
Like stains from the coffee beans
When we were seventeen having
Premonitions of money trees
Cold like an arctic breeze and
If your heart should freeze
I wouldn't blame you but we'll
Find a way through
Which god you pray to? What demons you slay?
Like Bruce Wayne
When your friends become two-faced
Crosstown with the roof down
Won't burn out, i'm too ablazed
Like butane with a blue flame from
My lighter need a new brain
And I won't go outside for a few days
With a suitcase full of malice
You're the crouton in my salad come on

Spilled my coffee on my T-Shirt
I caught the wrong train (And it's slow)
Spilled my coffee on my T-Shirt
I caught the wrong train
(And it's slow, slow, slow)
