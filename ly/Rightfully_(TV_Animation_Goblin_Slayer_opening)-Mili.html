		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Chained onto me
My adolescent dreams
Pulling, dragged me deep
All my body exposed
Marked up by your shadows

Tighten up, numb your senses, no fairness is needed for pigs
Laughters above, playful smiles, die gets rolled

Bathe in sorrow
My tomorrow is built upon your flesh
Slay the last of your kind to reclaim what's rightfully mine

Each time we'll enter, first time to make this, final dungeon munen na mirai no
I have a reason, don't part the rivers, surround them, off with their heads
Christen my motive, first time to notice, final dungeon murete mayou
I hide among you, facing my fire at night I'm dreaming, ah

I still dream of you
Will you be disappointed that I'm not who I used to be
Will you hold me tightly

Chained onto me
My adolescent dreams
Pulling, dragged me deep
All my body exposed
Marked up by your shadows

Piece by piece the tables turn and turn again
In this eternal game
Biscuits with clotted cream and milk tea
Time to roll your D20
Gods nor demons ready to admit defeat

Eat up, grind your teeth, they're not that much smarter than us
Laughters above, playful smiles, die gets rolled

Swallow your fate
Lubricate our blades with blood and tears
And your piercing screams are music to celebrate
Infiltrate penetrate, soon we'll have you destroyed
Back to the old days, slay the last of your kind to reclaim what's rightfully mine

Each time we'll enter, first time to make this, final dungeon munen na mirai no
I have a reason, don't part the rivers, surround them, off with their heads
Christen my motive, first time to notice, final dungeon murete mayou
I hide among you, facing my fire at night I'm dreaming nagai yume no kotoha
