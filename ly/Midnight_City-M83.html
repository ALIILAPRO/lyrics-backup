		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Waiting in the car
Waiting for the ride in the dark
At night the city grows
Look at the horizon glow

Waiting in the car
Waiting for the ride in the dark

Drinking in the lounge
Following the neon signs

Waiting for a word
Looking at the milky skyline
The city is my church
It wraps me in its blinding twilight

Waiting in the car
Waiting for the ride in the dark
Waiting in the car
Waiting for the ride in the dark
Waiting in the car
Waiting for the ride in the dark
Waiting in the car
Waiting for the ride in the dark
Waiting in the car
Waiting for the ride in the dark
