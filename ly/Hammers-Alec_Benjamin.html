		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's wholly subjective
The thing that you see
So what's your objective?
What will it be?
With those nails and those wrenches
The tools in your hand
I just have one question

If hammers can build, if hammers can take
If hammers can make things, if hammers can
Break the ground that you walk upon
Break the ground that you're standin' on, standin' on
If hammers can crush, if hammers can bend
Then how do you plan to use your hammer, my friend?
Wield your hammer like weapons drawn, or
Wield your hammer to right what's wrong, right what's wrong, hm

Only time will show
Only time will show
Only time will show
Only time will show

We're not passin' judgment
'Cause that would be cruel
Use your words to bludgeon you
As if they were some tool
But with those nails and those wrenches
The tools in your hand
I just have one question

If hammers can build, if hammers can take
If hammers can make things, if hammers can
Break the ground that you walk upon
Break the ground that you're standin' on, standin' on
If hammers can crush, if hammers can bend
Then how do you plan to use your hammer, my friend?
Wield your hammer like weapons drawn, or
Wield your hammer to right what's wrong, right what's wrong, hm

Only time will show
Only time will show
Only time will show
Only time will show

If hammers can build, if hammers can take
If hammers can make things, if hammers can
Break the ground that you walk upon
Break the ground that you're standin' on, standin' on
If hammers can crush, if hammers can bend
Then how do you plan to use your hammer, my friend?
Wield your hammer like weapons drawn, or
Wield your hammer to right what's wrong, right what's wrong, hm

Only time will show
Only time will show
Only time will show
Only time will show, mm
