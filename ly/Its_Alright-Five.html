		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alright 
Oh baby 
Alright 
I need some time to get my head round the things you said to me 
Thoughts are whirling round my mind 
Al right 
I never knew that I could feel so strong like the way I feel for
you 
That seemed impossible to me 
Alright 

Said oh oh 
I wish that you could see 
Said oh oh 
It's the way it's meant to be - yeah 

You're the only one I want at night 
You keep me warm and make me feel alright 
You know that we can work it out 
'Cause it's alright 
I only want to share my life with you 
Cause I love all the things you do 
Cause I know that it's alright 

Come on 
You know that I'm a dreamer 
I can change reality 
You know it's good times when we're together - come on 
We could take our love around the world 
We could dance upon the sea 
A little bit of work won't be forever 
Come on 

Said oh 
I wish that you could see 
Said oh 
It's the way it's meant to be - yeah 

You're the only one I want at night 
You keep me warm and make me feel alright 
You know that we can work it out 
Cause it's alright 
I only want to share my life with you 
Cause I love all the things you do 
Cause I know that it's alright 

Now I've been sitting here reminiscing bout the way we used to
be 
And how I want those feelings back because they mean the world
to me 
So check it 
I've seen around the world climbed the highest heights 
To prove my love for you is real to keep you warm through winter

nights 
Now baby 
I want to let you know the way you got me feeling 
It's guaranteed to keep me here because we're reeling 
When there's a problem together we can solve 'em 
yo all we gots to do is keep that perfect world revolving 

Said oh 
I wish that you could see 
Said oh 
It's the way it's meant to be -Yeah 

You're the only one I want at night 
You keep me warm and make me feel alright 
You know that we can work it out 
Cause it's alright 
I only want to share my life with you 
Cause I love all the things you do 
Cause I know that it's alright 

Oh oh oh oh 
Ooh check it 
Ooh ooh ooh
