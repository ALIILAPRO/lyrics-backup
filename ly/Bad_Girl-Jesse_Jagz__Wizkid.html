		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  S T A R baby
Uhh yeah yeah yeah
Eyyy

Baby girl call me jailer
Cos I'm a prisoner of love
Baby girl call me tailor
Cos I will mend your broken heart
In the rain every weather
Oh say I will love you till the end
Baby only you only you
Wey go make my life complete

Hmmm baby only you my baby only you
Wey I dey see wey dey make me dey happy dey make me dey smile I dey lose my mind
Ehnn baby only you my baby only you
See I dey see you dey make me dey happy dey make me dey smile
You just dey blow my mind

Me like them meaner
Have you seen her
Seen the rude girl in a beemer
With Lisa
And her sister
She a classic
She eat up
To see her you wan need a visa
Oliver Kahn
She a keeper
She sweeter
Than me reefer
Got a good head
She a reader
And sometime me leave her alone
But shawdy know that she my Nina Simone
She go deep not a low
Every night Jagga go reap what he sow
And she tell me what she feel inside
She say it's something so deep and wide
Girl if you want this bad as I do
Satisfy me let me satisfy you

Baby girl call me jailer
Cos I'm a prisoner of love
Baby girl call me tailor
Cos I will mend your broken heart
In the rain every weather
Oh say I will love you till the end
Baby only you only you
Wey go make my life complete

Hmmm baby only you my baby only you
Wey I dey see wey dey make me dey happy dey make me dey smile I dey lose my mind
Ehnn baby only you my baby only you
See I dey see you dey make me dey happy dey make me dey smile
You just dey blow my mind

Me like them meaner
Have you seen her
Me seen the rude girl in a beemer
Bad girl whine for me
She go ahead and grind for me
Yeah she come to like she wanna
Too supersona
Say Jagga if you move get you like piranha
Diamond in the sky
All cool like Rihanna
Do what you wanna
True and
Girl looking truly cinematic
Way she bend low see the city made of magic
When she in the club yes the whole city panic
She got the greg sex looking tight in her spandex
She tell me what she feel inside
She say it's something so deep and wide
If you want this as bad as I do
Girl let me satisfy you

Hmmm baby only you my baby only you
Wey I dey see wey dey make me dey happy dey make me dey smile I dey lose my mind
Ehnn baby only you my baby only you
See I dey see you dey make me dey happy dey make me dey smile
Girl you blow my mind

Baby girl call me jailer
Cos I'm a prisoner of love
Baby girl call me tailor
Cos I will mend your broken heart
In the rain every weather
Oh say I will love you till the end
Baby only you only you
Wey go make my life complete

Say Jah Selassie
You make a bad girl that look so fly
Oh Jah Selassie
Me need a bad girl in me lifey
Fit me wifey
Shawty be a bad girl

You see sexy sexy's all I see
