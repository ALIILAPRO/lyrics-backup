		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ready?)
We had to stay down, stay down, yeah, for the come up
Your gang ain't on shit (what)
Walkin' around, we gettin' lit (what)
Homixide
Yeah, what

We had to stay down, stay down, yeah, for the come up (stay down, stay down, stay down)
Niggas ain't gave us shit (nah)
The Wraith presidential, we lit (Homixide, Homixide)
Never tatted my face
We lockin' these shows, better than the past
Yeah, it's fuckin' lit (fuckin' lit)
We touchin' the paper, get rich
And fuckin' these hoes, ain't a risk (yeah, Homixide)
Run it up, run around, yeah, get fast
Double up, flip
We tryna get the money, yeah, we tryna get the bag
We rockin' all the big shows, uh
And tell 'em lil' boys to step up their bag
And no we don't tip-toe, uh
We play with them choppas, we play with them mags (what)

I'll tell the lil' fuckboy, yeah, to chill
Hundred-round drum, like, what's the deal?
Fuck out the way when we tryna get mill's (Homixide, Homixide)
I remember the noodles and flakes
Now it's 5-star meals
I remember we ain't had shit, now we got shit for real (woo)

Yeah, Homixide
We came from nothin', yeah
Homixide, huh
Homixide, Homixide, Homixide, Homixide

We had to stay down, stay down, yeah, for the come up (stay down, stay down, stay down)
Niggas ain't gave us shit (nah)
The Wraith presidential, we lit (Homixide, Homixide)
Never tatted my face
We lockin' these shows, better than the past (woo)
Yeah, it's fuckin' lit (fuckin' lit)
We touchin' the paper, get rich (touchin' the motherfuckin' paper)
And fuckin' these hoes ain't a risk (yeah, Homixide)
Run it up, run around, yeah, get fat
Double up, flip
We tryna get the money, yeah, we tryna get the bag
We rockin' all the big shows, uh
And tell 'em lil' boys to step up their bag (shit)
And no we don't tip-toe, uh (shit)
We play with them choppas, we play with them mags (what, huh)

Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Run up on me, I keep one in the head
It should be Glocks, run up on 'em in my hood
I'm on the block with my niggas who ready
I sip Codeine hit, diamonds froze out the freezer
We don't care about the kitchen
And we rockin' this shit like The Beatles
Deuce in the drugs, you know I be tweakin'
Never stop, you cannot quit
Yeah, real rockstar, hold up, lil' bitch
Slidin' off in a cop car, slide with my team, ooh
Bust a move on they block, bet your shit get hit (uh, shit, Homixide, Homixide, Homixide)
I drop a four in a G

Homixide, uh
Homixide, Homixide, Homixide, Homixide

We had to stay down, stay down, yeah, for the come up (stay down, stay down, stay down)
Niggas ain't gave us shit (nah)
The Wraith presidential, we lit (Homixide, Homixide)
Never tatted my face
We lockin' these shows, better than the past (woo)
Yeah, it's fuckin' lit (fuckin' lit)
We touchin' the paper, get rich (touchin' the motherfuckin' paper)
And fuckin' these hoes ain't a risk (yeah, Homixide)
Run it up, run around, yeah, get fat
Double up, flip
We tryna get the money, yeah, we tryna get the bag
We rockin' all the big shows, uh
And tell 'em lil' boys to step up their bag (shit)
And no we don't tip-toe, uh (shit)
We play with them choppas, we play with them mags
