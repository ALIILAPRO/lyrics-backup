		  Ayyo Justin! This is serious maaaaaan

One, go 'head put your hands up
Two, go 'head put your hands up
Three, go 'head put your hands up
Whooohooo!

I bring that sexy back
Go 'head rub the puddy cat
Don't you like the way I make you be my little slave?
Whip you like a kid every time you misbehave
Ooooh, you such a freak
Freakin, freakin, freakin me
All you gotta do is just flip it, smack
Baby can you show me how to bring sexy back?

I'm bringing sexy back
Them other boys don't know how to act
I think you're special, what's behind your back?
So turn around and I'll pick up the slack

Take 'em to the bridge

Dirty babe
You see these shackles
Baby I'm your slave
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave
It's just that no one makes me feel this way

Take 'em to the chorus

Come here girl
Go ahead, be gone with it
Come to the back
Go ahead, be gone with it
VIP
Go ahead, be gone with it
Drinks on me
Go ahead, be gone with it
Let me see what you're twerking with
Go ahead, be gone with it
Look at those hips
Go ahead, be gone with it
You make me smile
Go ahead, be gone with it
Go ahead child
Go ahead, be gone with it
And get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it

Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it

Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it

Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it

Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it

Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it

Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it

Get your sexy on

I'm bringing sexy back
Them other boys don't know how to act
Girl let me make up for the things you lack
'Cause you're burning up I gotta get it fast

Take 'em to the bridge

Dirty babe
You see these shackles
Baby I'm your slave
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave
It's just that no one makes me feel this way

Take 'em to the chorus

Come here girl
Go ahead, be gone with it
Come to the back
Go ahead, be gone with it
VIP
Go ahead, be gone with it
Drinks on me
Go ahead, be gone with it
Let me see what you're twerking with
Go ahead, be gone with it
Look at those hips
Go ahead, be gone with it
You make me smile
Go ahead, be gone with it
Go ahead child
Go ahead, be gone with it
And get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it

Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it

Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it

Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it

Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it

Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it

Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it

Get your sexy on

Go ahead and be gone with it
Boy come come and get it
I don't give a damn what it think
I like shackles and chains and all the freak things
Plus (?) got money in the bank
I got a few nice whips and real thick hips to match my cute waistline
And imma bring sexy back and matter of fact, yeah, I think I'm super fine

You ready?
You ready?
You ready?

I'm bringing sexy back
Them other boys watch how I attack
If that's your girl you better watch your back
'Cause she'll burn it up for me and that's a fact

Take 'em to the chorus

Come here girl
Go ahead, be gone with it
Come to the back
Go ahead, be gone with it
VIP
Go ahead, be gone with it
Drinks on me
Go ahead, be gone with it
Let me see what you're twerking with
Go ahead, be gone with it
Look at those hips
Go ahead, be gone with it
You make me smile
Go ahead, be gone with it
Go ahead child
Go ahead, be gone with it
And get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it

Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it

Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it

Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it

Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it

Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it

Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it

Get your sexy on
