		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All I need is some sunshine
All I need
All I need is some sunshine
All I need

The siren called beyond the treeline
With another one for the caves
And in the tarn beyond those birches
Is a spirit that I crave

And from the island people watched you
You set that viking ship ablaze
We reached the moon falls icy cauldron
And found the spirit that I crave

All I need is some sunshine
All I need
All I need is some sunshine
All I need

You've fallen barefoot past the treeline
Peeping boned-eyed, birches sway
And a thousand whitefish floating belly up
In the spirit that I crave

And we threw ourselves right into it
Where lay the bodies had been claimed
We dove a third, a fourth, a fifth
Banned to the spirit that I crave

All I need is some sunshine
All I need
All I need is some sunshine
All I need

I found empathy from madness
Deliverance from malaise
My heart is filled with gladness
And you're the only spirit that I crave

All I need is some sunshine
All I need
All I need is some sunshine
All I need

Black Water (pull me down)
Black Water (pull me down)
Black Water (pull me down)
Black Water (pull me down)
Black Water (pull me down)
Black Water (pull me down)
Black Water (pull me down)
Black Water (pull me down)
Black Water (pull me down)
Black Water (pull me down)
Black Water (pull me down)
Black Water (pull me down)
Black Water (pull me down)
Black Water (pull me down)
Black Water (pull me down)
Black Water (pull me down)
Black Water (pull me down)
Black Water (pull me down)
