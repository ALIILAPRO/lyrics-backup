		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I call her Miami, she my getaway
I call her Miami, yeah
I call her Miami, yeah yeah, yeah
I call her Miami, she my getaway
Just where I wanna be for a couple days
I call her when I need her, yeah
I call her Miami, she's my
Getaway, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh oh, oh oh (I call her Miami) , oh oh

Even though she gorgeous
She looks badder in Florida
Walk in the room, it's an audience
Everybody stand in form
You don't need a man, I
Know, you got your own, i know
I want you in my zone, I want you in my zone

I call her Miami, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
Just where I wanna be
(Just where I wanna be) , yeah yeah
Just where I wanna be, yeah yeah
I call her Miami, she's my getaway
(I call her Miami, I call her Miami)

"Wait"? How are you gonna just tell me
"Wait"? I've been here waiting y eso-
Como te vas a decirme que vas
A venir y dejarme aqui
I can't just wait for you
Forever, I've been waiting
I've been waiting
Â¿Y que mas, vamos a seperar ahora
Vamos a quedar juntos?
Dime, what is actually going on?
Can you just tell me? I can't wait for you
You're too busy tryna rip people

Wait, wait wait, wait (Jay Trench)
Wait, wait (Skai) wait

I ain't got time to talk
See a lil' shine in my walk
I'm taking my time with the- (whew)
I'm taking my time with the Urus
I'm taking my time with the Rick
Put all of my baddies in order
I'm closing my eyes when I pick
Keep going, keep going
Yeah, keep going, keep going (chyeah)
Numbers on the boards, count the money
Alphabetical order
I can't put this shit on pause
Smashing a baddie, it's in my aura
Start up the tank on two, let's go
Start a new swag, I'm feeling the dope
Prada balaclava on my nose
I cope the scarf in the back of the boat
I'm rocking Berluti, but nobody knows
I wanna say ten on the jacket alone
Wait, wait (phew)
I know Satan wanna get in my zone
Hells Angels and I'm rocking the Chrome
I'm tryna pick up some tings I don't know
Undecided, so I'm taking them both
I'm make some money just off the show
Came with some water, they peel him off

Wait, wait wait, wait
I ain't got time to talk wait, wait
Wait, wait (let's go)
I ain't got time to talk chyeah, chyeah
Chyeah, chyeah (let's go) chyeah, chyeah
Chyeah, chyeah

They don't get this one
Let me test this one
Nearly broke that one, let me rest this one
When I sweep this one, finna chest this one
Exit one on a real red rum
Tryna spin this one, then they will get spun
Takin' a risk on a roulette, won
Too many patterns, I can't choose one
Got too many baddies, I can't choose one

Can't choose one
Baddies, I can't choose one
Too many baddies, I can't choose one
I ain't got time to talk
Woah, woah (take my chains off, yeah)
Woah, woah i ain't got time to talk
I ain't got time to talk
