		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Since you've gone, well it 
Seems like everything is wrong
And deep inside, I know that I've
Lost much more than pride
Well happiness is getting further away
Girl I miss more than words can say
I need a miracle now
So tell me

How can I change the world
'Cos I sure can't change your mind
Where's the miracle I need now
Got to get to you somehow
'Cos I can't change the world
I can't change the world
No I can't change the world

Losing you, well it's been the hardest
Thing to do
So I close my eyes and tell myself
That somehow I'll survive
Well you gave me heaven then you
Took it away
Girl I miss you more with each
Passing day
I need a miracle now
So tell me...

How can I change the world
'Cos I sure can't change your mind
Where's the miracle I need now
Got to get you somehow

And it's so sad you're leaving me
Just so you can find yourself
And it's so sad that you just can't see
I love you more than life itself 

No I can't change the world 

How can I change the world
'Cos I sure can't change your mind
Where's the miracle I need now
Got to get to you somehow
'Cos I can't change the world
Got to get you somehow
No I can't change the world
I can't change the world
No I can't change the world
