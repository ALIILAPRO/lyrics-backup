		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Finally what you came for
Finally what you hoped to find
Racing home from her house
Looking out for black and white

Dark days in the summer
A million ways to tow the line
Can't wait holy other
Might as well be the seventh sign

Ooh, it goes hand in hand 
With fear for the afterlife
Ooh, how can we fight it, fight it
If we don't even know why?

While the dollar is strong
While nobody else relies
When they turn the corner
When you know we're out of sight

Dark days in the summer
In the rain the water's fine
It was wild combination
Either that or right down the line

Ooh, it goes hand in hand 
With fear for the afterlife
Ooh, how can we fight it, fight it
If we don't even know why?

I've been on the way, I've been on the way
I've been on my way for so long
I've been on the way, I've been on the way
I've been on my way for so long
