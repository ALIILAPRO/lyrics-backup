		<p>
		  Yep, uh huh
And then it comes to me like an epiphany
It's over, over
Yeah, it's over, over

Second night in a row you didn't come home
I'm watching my phone, waiting for it to ring
Sitting in the house on a couch with the TV on
All night, all alone
Every time, same old thing

So I think I'm just about over being your girlfriend (girlfriend)
I'm leaving (leaving), I'm leaving
No more wondering what you've been doing
Where you've been sleeping (it's over)
I'm leaving, I'm leaving (it's over), yeah, yeah

So you walked in (you walked in)
The next morning (the next morning)
To find me smiling, like nothing ever happened
You'll give me some excuse (some excuse)
Like you always do (like you always do)
I just kiss your cheek
And this is what I tell you

So I think I'm just about over being your girlfriend (girlfriend)
I'm leaving (I'm leaving), I'm leaving
No more wondering what you've been doing
Where you've been sleeping (it's over)
I'm leaving, I'm leaving (it's over), yeah, yeah

How many times did I fall for your lies?
How many times did I sit home and cry?
Never questioning why?
And it just came to me like an epiphany
How about I just leave?

So I think I'm just about over being your girlfriend (girlfriend)
I'm leaving (leaving), I'm leaving
No more wondering what you've been doing
Where you've been sleeping (it's over)
I'm leaving, I'm leaving (it's over), yeah, yeah

So I think I'm just about over being your girlfriend
I'm leaving, I'm leaving
No more wondering what you've been doing
Where you've been sleeping (it's over)
I'm leaving, I'm leaving (it's over), yeah, yeah
