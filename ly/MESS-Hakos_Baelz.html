Woke up today, feelin' less than great
Got my work done late, oh (screw these deadlines!)
Missed the train, two hour wait
And I barely ate (just what is my life?)

Seems like everybody's got it all, figured out
No matter where the hell I go
I always end up getting lost somehow

The spark guiding my way is slowly fizzing out

Every night in my bed
I look up to the stars
'Cause I know what it's like to be so close and yet so far, oh
All these thoughts in my head
And I fight that mental war

'Cause I really need to know
I need to know!
I need you now! I need you!

I'ma need you to understand that

I can be a handful, hard to handle
Down in flames everything I touch
Is it a scandal if you try and screw it up sometimes?

I don't need your guidance or advice
I know I'm right where I want to be
(I'll find) my way
But all the people say

I'm a mess
I'm a mess
I'm a mess

I'm a mess
So what?! A mess
That's what I like about me best!

Ayy, why don't we throw the dice?
Let's see what kinda trouble we could get into tonight (ah huh)
I like a little chaos in my life, that's right (yeah)
What's with all this sugar
Let me add a little spice, yeah?

Seems like everybody's got it all figured out
Ain't that good for them? 'Cause so have I by now

It's my journey to take and I will find my route

When I go to bed
And I look up at the stars
I feel a sense of calm in knowing that there's something much greater than us
And don't you think the point of life is having fun?

'Cause I really need to know
I need to know! I need you now! I need you!

I'ma need you to understand that

I can be a handful, hard to handle
Down in flames everything I touch
Is it a scandal if you try?
No, no, no, no

I realized that all I needed has been right here by my side
All this time (come on, come on, come on)
All this time (come on, come on, come on)
All this time

Hey!

I can be a handful, hard to handle
Down in flames everything I touch
Is it a scandal if you try and screw it up sometimes?

I don't need your guidance or advice
I know I'm right where I want to be
My way

Too bad, you thought you got me chained
Now I'm flying, can't be tamed (now)
Let the wind carry away my thoughts and I know now I'm free

And you doubted that I would
Now I showed you that I could!

(Da-da-dada, da-da-dada)
(Da-da-dada, da-dadada-dada)
