		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, yeah 
(Mia JAY C)
Oh, yeah (Helluva made this beat, baby)
Oh, yeah

I was showin' love to niggas when they wasn't nobody (no one)
I was lookin' out for bitches when they ain't had nobody (no one)
They switched up, I ain't mad 'cause they still ain't nobody (at all)
I hate broadcastin' the shit I do, I know they gon' copy (oh, yeah)
Ain't nobody look out for me, ain't nobody got me (no one)
Now ain't nobody fuckin' with me, can't nobody stop me (no, no)
You see who I got with me, nigga, won't nobody try me
When He made me, He mad a beast, won't nobody out-grind me (let's see)
Lambo' doors open when I run in Hibachi
Started doin' that gamin' shit and built an empire like Ghazi
Postin' pictures from the coast, but not the East or West, the 'Malfi ('Malfi Coast)
He swear this shit be rubbin' off, might catch a blessin' standin' by me, nigga

Who in my way? (I don't see 'em) 
Nobody (at all)
Who can take my place? (Who can be me?) 
Nobody (at all)
Who got somethin' to say? (Who gon' say it?) 
Everybody
Who gon' say it to my face? (Who brave enough?) 
Nobody (I thought so)
Who gon' take this case for me? (Who?) 
Nobody
My bills late, who gon' pay 'em for me? (Who gon' look out?) 
Nobody (exactly)
If I'm down bad, stuck, who gon' be there for me? Nobody (exactly)
How I know? 'Cause I was down bad and ain't see nobody (exactly)

'Member times I wasn't lit, kept on grindin', stuck to this (stuck to it)
I hit my jeweler, blow a brick, the baddest hoes, I take my pick (whichever)
I can pop my shit without no worries, I'm gon' pop my blick (for sure)
I walk around with ice all on my watch, they think I popped my wrist (shit)
I be in the crib with it, I don't wanna deal with 'em
Outside it's too many suckers dressed up like real niggas
Tellin' me it's politics in this, gotta be friends with 'em (I, what?)
Watch us not be friends with them niggas and still get it (fuck 'em)
Rose gold on the Rolls-Royce, that's my nigga Lace (what up?)
You see Dot hangin' out with Drac', that's a nigga face (boom)
Come around, helped us built the table, you can get a plate (come eat, nigga)
Take your time, nigga, it's a marathon, not a race (oh yeah)

Who in my way? (I don't see 'em) 
Nobody (at all)
Who can take my place? (Who can be me?) 
Nobody (at all)
Who got somethin' to say? (Who gon' say it?) 
Everybody
Who gon' say it to my face? (Who brave enough?) 
Nobody (I thought so)
Who gon' take this case for me? (Who?) 
Nobody
My bills late, who gon' pay 'em for me? (Who gon' look out?) 
Nobody (exactly)
If I'm down bad, stuck, who gon' be there for me? Nobody (exactly)
How I know? 'Cause I was down bad and ain't see nobody (exactly)
