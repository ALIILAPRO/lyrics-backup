(Lekaa Beat)

Holy Ghost fire
Supernatural
Boost my confidence
My cocaina
My heart desire
Give me nothing else
I no dey tire
'Cause you give me ginger
For the die minute
You're my true lover
My mami water
Give me happiness

Oya, get up and dance
Get up and dance
Get up and dance
Get up and dance dance
Get up and dance
Get up and dance
Get up and dance
Get up and dance dance
Get up and dance
Get up and dance
Get up and dance
Get up and dance dance
Get up and dance
Get up and dance
Get up and dance

Holy Ghost fire (dance)

Symptoms don dey show for my knicker
I'll stop drinking, baby
Tequila don dey hit me for liver
It's either indicia or it is Sativa
Any time that I smoke, these girls be looking like wife materials
Is it this or that?
If I seek, I'll find
How I feel inside
I will let you know
I am super high
I can't feel my eyes
They say love is blind
But I can see you

Oya, get up and dance
Get up and dance
Get up and dance
Get up and dance dance
Get up and dance
Get up and dance
Get up and dance
Get up and dance dance
Get up and dance
Get up and dance
Get up and dance
Get up and dance dance
Get up and dance
Get up and dance
Get up and dance
Get up and dance dance
Get up and dance
Get up and-

Holy Ghost fire (dance, holy)
Supernatural (get up and dance, get up and dance, holy)
Boost my confidence (get up and dance dance, get up and dance)
(Get up and dance)
(Get up and dance, get up and dance dance, oh, holy o)
My cocaina (get up and dance, holy)
My heart desire (get up and dance, get up and dance, holy)
Give me nothing else (get up and dance dance, get up and dance)
(Get up and dance)
(Get up and dance, get up and dance dance)
I no dey tire (get up and dance)
'Cause you give me ginger (get up and dance, get up and dance)
For the die minute (get up and dance dance, get up and dance, holy, holy)
(Get up and dance) 
(Get up and dance, holy, holy, get up and dance dance)
You're my true lover (get up and dance)
My mami water (get up and dance, get up and dance)
Give me happiness (get up and dance dance)
