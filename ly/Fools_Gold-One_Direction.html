		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm like a crow on a wire
You're the shining distraction that makes me fly home
I'm like a boat on the water
You're the raise on the waves that calm my mind
Oh, every time

But I know in my heart, you're not a constant star

And yeah, I've let you use me from that day that we first met
But I'm not done yet
Falling for you
Fool's gold
And I knew that you turn it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret
Falling for you
Fool's gold

I'm the first to admit that I'm reckless
I get lost in your beauty and I can't see
Two feet in front of me

And I know in my heart, you're just a moving part

And yeah I've let you use me from that day that we first met
But I'm not done yet
Falling for you
Fool's gold
And I knew that you turn it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret
Falling for you
Fool's gold
Oh, oh-ooh

Yeah, I know your love's not real
That's not the way it feels
That's not the way you feel

And yes I've let you use me from that day that we first met
But I'm not done yet
Falling for you
Fool's gold
And I knew that you turn it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret
Falling for you
Fool's gold
Oh, oh-ooh
Oh, oh-ooh
