		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My eyes roll back to see and then fate
I breathe you in
Exalt your flames
Let's lose our minds, come here to me
We're wasting time
Darling, can you hear me?

Heroine, my sweetest sin
I can't seem to get enough
Pull me under, wake me up
Feel the rush
Morphine lover make me numb
Make it so I can't get up
Paper-thin till you sink in
Could you be my heroine?

Do you feel exposed?
Let your feelings show
Can I taste you? Can I replace you?
I need to know
Let's lose our minds
Please stay with me
We're wasting, yeah, we're wasting time
Why don't you believe me?

Heroine, my sweetest sin
I can't seem to get enough
Pull me under, wake me up
Feel the rush
Morphine lover make me numb
Make it so I can't get up
Paper-thin till you sink in
Could you be my heroine?

It starts with the spins
Yeah, you got me swimming
And I've fallen to pieces, now I won't be whole 
Until you let me in
Until you let me in
Until you let me in
Until you let me in, oh

Heroine, my sweetest sin
I can't seem to get enough
Pull me under, wake me up
Feel the rush
Morphine lover make me numb
Make it so I can't get up
Paper-thin till you sink in
Could you be my heroine?

My heroine, my heroine
Could you be my heroine?
