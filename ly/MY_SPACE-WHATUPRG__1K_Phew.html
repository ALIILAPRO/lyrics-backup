		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Took a lot for me to get
Back on the grind again (Yeah)
Lemme tell you 'bout the
Demons I've been battlin' (Uh, huh)
Couldn't go back to the struggle, man
I had to win (Huh)
Tell the Devil back, back, I need my space
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Took a lot for me to get
Back on the grind again (Woo)
Lemme tell you 'bout the
Demons I've been battlin' (Whew)
Couldn't go back to the struggle, man
I had to win
Tell the Devil back, back, I need my space
(Whew)

"Holy" tatted on my neck
It sit above the chain
Tried to label me a sinner
But I'm still a saint (Yeah)
I got family 'cross the
Border livin' day-to day (Uh, huh)
Ain't no sense in clockin' in
And out for pocket change (Pew, pew, pew)
So I put in work, tryna make the first
Put the family first, break the family curses
(Uh huh, phew)
Had to go through hell and back
To see heaven on earth (Uh, huh)
It was brick by brick, got it out the dirt
(Huh, yeah)
I don't wanna pose for the content
I've been duckin' all the
Trends and the nonsense
Locked in, dealin' with the past
Tryna process regardless, did it from the
Heart for the heartless

Took a lot for me to get
Back on the grind again (Yeah)
Lemme tell you 'bout the
Demons I've been battlin' (Uh, huh)
Couldn't go back to the struggle, man
I had to win (Huh)
Tell the Devil back, back, I need my space
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Took a lot for me to get
Back on the grind again (Woo)
Lemme tell you 'bout the
Demons I've been battlin' (Whew)
Couldn't go back to the struggle, man
I had to win
Tell the Devil back, back, I need my space
(Uh huh, uh huh)

Remember them days when I was broke
But it wasn't no crumblin'
(It wasn't no crumblin')
I tried to get cash to make it flip
But ended up tumblin' (Flip)
Thought I would be steppin' with that drink
But end up stumblin' (I was steppin')
Couldn't even talk every time I sip
I end up mumblin' (Yeah)
On pay-per-view, I'm fightin' demons

(Yeah, we outside, we outside)

Hey, hey it was hectic, early mornin'
Restless wake up on the edge, yeah
Dodgin' all my best friends
Label on the line
They wanna keep up with investments
Had to get back up and tell
Myself that I been destined
Holy presidential with the chosen
I'm elected angels all around me when
I'm walkin' unprotected
Slidin' through the city, it ain't litty
It's electric trendin' in Brazil, yeah
But I can't chill yet
'Til we at the top, top, top, top, top, top
Top top, top, top, top, top, top, top, top
Put the family on my shoulders
I can't let 'em down
I'd be damned if I let
Depression take me out
Look at what I'm on, it's elite
I put on for the team
If I got it, then we got it, yeah
We all 'boutta eat
Got a callin' on my life
I'm 'boutta walk what I preach
Put a demon in a hearse, lay him down, RIP

Took a lot for me to get
Back on the grind again
Lemme tell you 'bout the
Demons I've been battlin'
Couldn't go back to the struggle, man
I had to win
Tell the devil back, back, I need my space
