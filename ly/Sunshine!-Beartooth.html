		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm like actually losing my voice

Killing my time in the dark inside
It's a race to death for me
Try and unwind while I lose my mind
I got no place to be

The cold wind's blowing
The light's not showing
Excuses piling up
I can't keep running
The end is coming
I think I need some
I think I need some

Sunshine that would finally show
I might die if I stay in this cold
And I finally admit it
I gotta be committed
To let this story unfold

I hear angels calling my name and
I better listen before I implode
I don't care for a minute
If no one's gonna get it
Let's try selling our souls

Let's try selling our souls
Let's try selling our souls

Living in filth, can't look at myself
'Cause I know what I'm gonna see
The spirit I lost, the years it cost
The reasons I'm scared to sleep

The room is spinning
The clock keeps ticking
I've finally had enough
I can't keep running
The end is coming
I think I need some
I think I need some

Sunshine that would finally show
I might die if I stay in this cold
And I finally admit it
I gotta be committed
To let this story unfold

I hear angels calling my name and
I better listen before I implode
I don't care for a minute
If no one's gonna get it
Let's try selling our souls (souls, souls)

The end is coming
The end is coming
The end is coming
I can't keep running
The end is coming
The end is coming

I think I need some, I think I need some
Sunshine that would finally show
I might die if I stay in this cold
And I finally admit it
I gotta be committed
To let this story unfold

I hear angels calling my name and
I better listen before I implode
I don't care for a minute
If no one's gonna get it
Let's try selling our souls
