		  Visum commutamus
Nihil certum
Qui observat, visi
pars est

The quantum enigma
All your laws and the assumptions
Leave them all behind
There's no grounds for them right here where time can't go
If we can't move on and keep all leaning on the past
We will regret
We can't get what we wish for

New perspective keep us inspired

The quantum enigma
All shadows and illusions
We tend to believe 
Are creations of our own deceiving mind
If we can't let go and keep chasing satisfyin needs
We will not get
How to forget our sapience

New perceptions keep us inspired
Ingenuity is required

When we will look around and see
We will affect the energy
When we observe by any means
We will create reality

We will not find if we don't seek
We will not know if we don't peek
We cannot do if we don't be
Facing our deadlock now
This is our quantum enigma

We'll ignite the fire
That burns under the rain
All that we desire
Is to find our source again
The meaning of life

All dreamscapes and inventions
We tend to believe
Are creations of our own deceiving mind

If we can't let go and keep chasing satisfying needs
We will forget
How to retrieve true wisdom

New perceptions keep us inspired
Ingenuity is required

The quantum enigma
when will look around and see
We will affect the energy
When we observe by any means

We will create reality
We will not find if we don't seek
We will not know if we don't peek
We cannot do if we don't be
Facing our deadlock now
This is our quantum enigma
Without a voice the soul is invisible in time and space

Omne est vigor
Sentimus eum
Sicit concretum
Vigor concrescit
Observatione

Vita est mare
Infinitarum facultatum
Si quae emergant opperiens
Quod inspicimus
Adipiscemur

Each new discovery
That we acclaim
Brings us much closer
To reach our aim

So we will finally see
All of the universe
Exists by being observed
Expanding every day

As we reach further
Let's take this chance to carry on
We will unravel mysteries
And take the challenge as it comes

We will exceed our boundaries
Let's use this chance to end this strife
Obliterate anomalies
Reveal the myths surrounding life

We will decipher secrecies
New perceptions keep us inspired
Ingenuity is required

The quantum enigma
When we will look around and see
We will affect the energy
When we observe by any means

We will create reality
We will not find if we don't seek
We will not know if we don't peek
We cannot do if we don't be
Facing our deadlock now

This is our quantum enigma
We cannot find if we do not seek
With our confined capacity
Reveal all mysteries

Quantum enigma
