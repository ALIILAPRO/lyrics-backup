		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some girls play the game
They all walk and talk
And they dress the same
Nothin' new to say (new to say)
Don't they realize
That it's so easy to see
Right though there disguise
Makes me wonder why
When the whole world's turnin' left
It's when I'm goin' right
I need someone to let me be
Just who I am inside

'Cause a girl like me
Is just a little different from all the rest
And a girl like me
Never gonna settle for second best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything
If I asked him to
To take all my dreams
And then make 'em true
Show me all the reasons that you ought to be
With a girl like me (a girl like me)
Just like me

Possibility
Got me trippin'
Thinkin' of what could be
Between you and me
Still I need to know
Should I keep this feelin'
Or let it go
I can't wait no more
So now's the time
To speak your mind
And show me what you feel
So tell me if you
Wanna take a chance
On something real

'Cause a girl like me
Is just a little different from all the rest
And a girl like me
Never gonna settle for second best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything
If I asked him to
To take all my dreams
And then make 'em true
Show me all the reasons that you ought to be
With a girl like me (a girl like me)
Like me
Just like me

Mirror mirror on the wall
Catch me now before I fall
I wish I may, I wish I might
Find the answer here tonight
Mirror mirror on the wall
Catch me now before I fall
I wish I may, I wish I might
Find the answer here tonight

When the whole world's turnin' left
It's when I'm going right
I need someone to let me be
Just who I am inside

'Cause a girl like me
Is just a little different from all the rest
And a girl like me
Never gonna settle for second best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything
If I asked him to
To take all my dreams
And then make 'em true
Show me all the reasons that you ought to be
With a girl like me
Just like me (just like me)

Mirror mirror on the wall
Catch me now before I fall
I wish I may, I wish I might
Find the answer here tonight

'Cause a girl like me
Is just a little different from all the rest
And a girl like me
Never gonna settle for second best
