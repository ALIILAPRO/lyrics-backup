		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, when I'm lonely and when I come undone
Remember what you told me
Life's like a waterfall

You know sometimes I'm caught up in my head
I'm trying to make the best of the lows and the highs
But it's hard sometimes
When you're scared to take a step
You're fighting with the waves so afraid of the tide

Gotta let it go, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
That's the only way that I know how
Gotta lose control-ol-ol, ol-ol-ol
No, I won't ever let it get me down

Oh, when I'm lonely and when I come undone
Remember what you told me
Life's like a waterfall
I know the only way to get along
Is going with the flow
'Cause life's like a waterfall

I know the only way to get along
Is going with the flow
'Cause life's like a waterfall

I know sometimes
This life can break your heart
When some things fall apart
There's no good in goodbye
But the darkest night
Won't always be that dark
Tears are gonna fall
Tears are gonna dry

Gotta let it go, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
That's the only way that I know how
Gotta lose control-ol-ol, ol-ol-ol
No, I won't ever let it get me down

Oh, when I'm lonely and when I come undone
Remember what you told me
Life's like a waterfall
I know the only way to get along
Is going with the flow
'Cause life's like a waterfall

Like a waterfall
Oh, when I'm lonely and when I come undone
Remember what you told me
Life's like a waterfall
I know the only way to get along
Is going with the flow
'Cause life's like a waterfall
