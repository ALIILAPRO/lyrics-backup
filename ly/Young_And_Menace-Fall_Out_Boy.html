		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We've gone way too fast for way too long
And we were never supposed to make it half this far
And I lived so much life, lived so much life
I think that God is gonna have to kill me twice
Kill me twice like my name was Nikki Sixx
I woke up in my shoes again but somewhere you exist, singing

Oops I did it again, I
Forgot what I was losing my mind about
I only wrote this down to make you press rewind
And send a message, "I was young and a menace"

Young, young, young and a menace

Woke up on the wrong side of reality
And there's a madness that's just coursing right through me
And as far as the time, far as the time
Not sure I'm there yet but I'm certain I've arrived

Oops I, did it again, I
Forgot what I was losing my mind about
I only wrote this down to make you press rewind
And send a message, "I was young and a menace"

Young, young, young and a menace

I'm just here flying off the deep end
I'm just here to become the best yet
I'm just here for the psych assessment
I'm just here for the, for the

(For!) Young and a menace

We've gone way too fast for way too long
