		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel my life's been so tongue tied
I'm trapped outside inside my mind
If you feel like that you're tongue tied
Then we're tongue tied together

Every morning I ride on a carousel
To the sides in my mind that I cannot help
Had to die in heaven just to get to hell
Fell when the lights went out, now
My real friends act like they don't know me
This headache's giving me a nosebleed
My silence is killing me slowly
I can't keep drowning it out and

I've been suffering and making friends with all my sins
I need saving, I need saving, you won't save me ever again
I'm feeling counterfeit, been rolling silence 'round my lips
I need saving, I need saving, you won't save me ever again

'Cause I feel my life's been so tongue tied
I'm trapped outside inside my mind
If you feel like that you're tongue tied
Then we're tongue tied together
Can you even hear me now?

Tongue tied together
Tongue tied together
Tongue tied together

Yeah, yeah
Uh, uh
You done changed, you done changed
You done switched up, fo' sho'
You ain't lose me in the summer, you lost me at hello
Anytime you see me smiling it was probably for show
All the memories are blurry, so I let 'em burn slow
I ain't seen you in a minute, where did all the time go?
You was out of pocket when you told me, "Die slow"
I was going through the shits I kept it down low
Tongue tied, tongue tied, what we had was all lies
People change, people change, people switch up
It's okay, you can't save me ever again
People change, people change, people switch up
It's okay, you can't save me

'Cause I feel my life's been so tongue tied
I'm trapped outside inside my mind (inside my mind)
If you feel like (you feel like) that you're tongue tied (uh)
Then we're tongue tied together
So can you even hear me now?

Tongue tied together
Tongue tied together
So can you even hear me now?
Tongue tied together
Tongue tied together
