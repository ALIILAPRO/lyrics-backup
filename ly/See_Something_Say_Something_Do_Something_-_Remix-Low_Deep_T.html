		  “See something say something Do

Chorus : when you see something say something most of all do something
That will make a difference
When you see something say something
Most of all do something that will bring about a change

Verse 1: silence is not an option no
It only leads to nothing but complicity
Cause the world is full of hypocrites
They say do as I say not as I do
When you catch them lying
They’ll double down triple down quadruple down
All that is left for us to do
Is expose them all before it’s too late

Chorus : when you see something say something most of all do something
That will make a difference
When you see something say something
Most of all do something that will bring about a change to the world
That will bring about a change to the world
it’s about time ,

Talking : yeah Go on tell it like it is
You don’t have to sit on the fence not anymore
Not this time .


Verse 2 : Don’t be afraid to get into trouble
Good trouble necessary trouble
Speak up speak out
Like John Lewis used to say
Don’t let intimidation get the best of you
Remember the words of Edmund Burke
All it takes for evil to triumph is for good men
To do nothing don’t let this be you oh no

Starting today here’s what I want you to do

Repeat chorus ;

Out vocals:

Silence ha silence silence is no longer an option no
When you see it when you see it go on and do something about it corruption everywhere
Hypocrites everywhere.

Chorus : when you see something say something most of all do something
That will make a difference
When you see something say something
Most of all do something that will bring about a change to the world
That will bring about a change to the world
it’s about time ,
