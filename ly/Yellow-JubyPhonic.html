		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Basically I killed the cat, my curiosity caught me

Destroying what I love until I’m left with nothing

To have and eat a cake without a candle burning

I’m dancing with a puppet of you, but I’m learning


We sit in the closet, waiting

Another day of huddling, our bodies aching

We hope we’re sleeping, we hope we’re changing

Better thinking of it in that way


“I’m just a stupid kid, don’t leave me all alone again”

You’re mixing me up in your eyes and can’t see me for who I am

Tidy up the toys, we do it every single night

Staying naive like a dream comes to an ending, right?


Higher that high, love undying doesn’t rid as easily

Shedding the memories that you’re dearly holding onto

But you sigh “low-life” hating who you couldn’t be

Making a wish for a dream inside the summer glow


YELLOW (x16)


Basically it killed the man, the curiosity caught him

Examining the boundary, a devious attempt

But going on my own will never win me nothing

I’m singing with a smile, is it true or bluffing?


We sit in the closet, waiting

Another day of huddling alone and aching

I know it’s ending, I know it’s changing this way


For any value in me, look and look and look

The second hand came

Roll and roll and took

A deeper dug grave

The Earth became the sky, flipping it all awry

But how and why? And blurring deeper in my mind, I’m

Thinking back, I still recall the window and the world that I saw

And so, we’re learning it’s better to be rid of YELLOW


YELLOW (x16) 

You sew yourself a lie with that tongue

Saying the day will never come

Breaking and splitting, close your heart off if you want to

No hope for us and nowhere to run

We couldn’t reach out high enough

But keep recalling the heat...


Higher that high, love undying doesn’t rid as easily

Shedding the memories that you’re dearly holding onto

But you sigh “low-life” hating who you couldn’t be

Making a wish for a dream, inside the summer glow
