		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I started at the bottom, tried everything
Had to find the kind of strength you've never seen before
Time to write my story, make history
After all these battles, yeah, I'm ready for war
Yeah, now I'm ready for war

If I sink before I swim
I'll be alright, I will survive
If I lose before I win
I'll still ignite the fire inside
I will overcome
I will overcome
I will live before I die
There's no way to hide the fire inside
The fire inside

Take a trip, take a sip, slip off the rail
Had to open my eyes so I could see for myself
Tied down, locked up, but I prevailed
I was born for war

If I sink before I swim
I'll be alright, I will survive
If I lose before I win
I'll still ignite the fire inside
I will overcome
I will overcome
I will live before I die
There's no way to hide the fire inside
The fire inside

I will survive
The fire inside

If I sink before I swim
I'll be alright, I will survive
If I lose before I win
I'll still ignite the fire inside
I will overcome
I will overcome
I will live before I die
There's no way to hide the fire inside
The fire inside
There's no way to hide the fire inside
There's no way to hide the fire inside
