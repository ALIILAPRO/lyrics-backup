		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jump and run, trip and we fall
Neon lights up when we touch ground
We get up, now we want more
Never quit 'cause we don't know how
Even with blood on our faces
We're gonna try it again now
We know there must be a way
Somewhere just waiting to be found

We ain't wasting time
On those purple nights
We won't lose our minds

'Cause this is how we grow
We don't care about the shots we miss
We don't care how many
Times we're falling down
'Cause we know right now
This is how we grow
We don't have to be afraid to change
'Cause we know what goes
Around comes back around
Yeah we know right now this is how we

Grow oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh ah)
Grow oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
This is how we grow oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh (Oh ah) grow oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh this is how we grow

Shooting hearts into the sky
Spinning in circles and fall down
Waiting for one that can fly
Hold on to hope we got no doubt

We ain't wasting time
On those purple nights
We won't lose our minds

'Cause this is how we grow
We don't care about the shots we miss
We don't care how many
Times we're falling down
'Cause we know right now
This is how we grow
We don't have to be afraid to change
'Cause we know what goes
Around comes back around
Yeah we know right now this is how we

Grow oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh ah)
Grow oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
This is how we grow oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh (Oh ah) grow oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh this is how we grow

We don't care about the shots we miss
We don't care how many
Times we're falling down
'Cause we know right now
This is how we grow
