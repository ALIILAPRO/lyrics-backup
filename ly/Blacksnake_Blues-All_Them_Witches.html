		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He's a mean black snake 
Sucking my rider's tongue
He's a mean black snake been 
Oh, sucking on my rider's tongue

You know, if I go and catch him down 
Oh, I guarantee he won't be coming back no more

And he crawl to my window 
And he crawl up in my bed
And he crawl to my window 
Oh, he crawl up to my window crawl up in my baby's bed
Oh, he's a mean, mean, mean black snake
Oh, you gon' kill him dead

He worry me all through the day
He worry me all night long
He worry me all through the day
He worry me all day long
I bet you my bottom dollar
He won't be sucking my rightest tongue no more

Mean, mean, mean black snake
Sucking my rightest tongue
Whoa, there's a mean, mean black snake
Sucking my rightest tongue

Oh, if I catch him down
He won't be sucking my rightest tongue no more

Mix me up some toad frog hips
Hold down the conquer's done no good
Mix me up some toad frog hips
Hold down the conquer's done no good

Gonna put grave dirt on his doorstep
And I'd be rid of him for good
