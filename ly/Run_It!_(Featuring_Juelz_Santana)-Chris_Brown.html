		  Okay
Check it, check it, check it out
It's Santana again
Steppin', steppin', steppin' out (uh)
One of them brand new big boy toys
I do big boy things
I make big boy noise 'cause
I know what girls want (want)
I know what they like (like)
They wanna stay up (ayy) 
And party all night
So bring a friend

Let me talk to you, tell you how it is
I was thinkin' when I saw that body
Gotta get shawty, tell her what the young boy gon' do
Damn, them chicks with you gotta be your kin
Babe, pretty thick with the kick that's sick
That need to be hit, so tell me what y'all gon' do

I got friends and you got friends (word, oh)
They hop out, and you hop in (word, oh-oh)
I look fly and they jockin' (word)
The way you drop, drop makes me wanna pop
I got friends and you got friends (word, hey)
They hop out, and you hop in (word)
I look fly and they jockin' (word)
The way you drop, drop makes me wanna pop

Is ya man (man) 
On the floor? (Floor)
If he ain't (ain't)
Lemme know (know)
Let me see if you can run it, run it
Girl, indeed I can run it, run it
Is ya man (man) 
On the floor? (Floor)
If he ain't (ain't) 
Lemme know (lemme know)
Let me see if you can run it, run it
Girl, indeed I can run it, run it (come here)

You'll see, girl, I can set you off
Don't believe my age gonna slow us down
I can definitely show you things 
To have you sayin' I can't be sixteen
Once I get in you won't let go
(And I) I'll have the girls wishin' they were you 
(And I) I know you heard 'bout me 
But guess what's goin' down if we leave?

I got friends and you got friends (word, oh)
They hop out, and you hop in (word, oh)
I look fly and they jockin' (word)
The way you drop, drop makes me wanna pop
I got friends and you got friends (word)
They hop out, and you hop in (word, hey)
I look fly and they jockin' (word, ooh)
The way you drop, drop makes me wanna pop (ooh, ooh)

Is ya man (man) 
On the floor? (Floor)
If he ain't (ain't) 
Lemme know (know)
Let me see if you can run it, run it
Girl, indeed I can run it, run it
Is ya man (man) 
On the floor? (Floor)
If he ain't (ain't) 
Lemme know (lemme know)
Let me see if you can run it, run it (ayy)
Girl, indeed I can run it, run it (let's go)

Girl, you feel right (feel right)
Make me feel like (feel like)
I wanna do a little somethin' (do a little somethin' tonight)
Ain't no thing, let's do it for sure
Girl, the way that you're wearin' them jeans is turnin' me on
I'm the hottest thing that's in these streets (Dipset)
So, baby, won't you rock me? (Santana, ayy)

Make it drop honey (honey)
Make it pop honey (honey)
Whip-whop, tick-tock to the clock for me
Don't stop doin' that (don't)
And shawty know I mean what I say
So she won't stop doin' that
Plus I heard if you can dance, you can bump
Well dance time is up, let's go, let's go (yup)
We can get it in (yup), we can get some friends
Do it like the Ying Yang Twinz, start whisperin'
Wait 'til you see my, ayy 
Wait 'til you see my, ayy 
Let me fall back, you ain't ready for all that
Have you sleep late, real late, yeah, takin' a long nap (ayy)
You tell your friends, to get wit' my friends
We could be friends, switch and meet friends (switch)
We can do it all night long and 
'Til the clock hit mornin', ya dig? (Ayy)

Is ya man (man, ooh) 
On the floor? (Floor)
If he ain't (ain't) 
Lemme know (know, ooh, ooh, yeah)
Let me see if you can run it, run it
Girl, indeed I can run it, run it (oh, woah-oh)
Is ya man (man, oh, woah-oh) 
On the floor? (Floor)
If he ain't (ain't) 
Lemme know (lemme know, mmm)
Let me see if you can run it, run it (run it)
Girl, indeed I can run it, run it (yeah)

Oh-oh (uh)
Oh, oh (woo) (uh-huh)
Oh, woah (woo)
Oh-oh (woo, Chris Brown)
(Ayy) (woo)
(Woo) (ayy)
(Woo)
(Ayy, ayy)
