		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I walked around for days
In a familiar place
This time I finally let myself own every small feeling
There was the one who got away
There was a first for everything
Never a second guess if I was right where I should be
Do you know what I mean?

All night
Do you still feel part of something loud?
All night
Are you such a different person now?
A dream that never was
An idea you think you come from
All night
When you can't look at the day

I had it figured out
The way it really is
In growing up we've added just too much complexity
Friends at the show in '95
Miss every one of them
But there's a moment that you die or you move on to live
Every one of us did

All night
Do you still feel part of something loud?
All night
Are you such a different person now?
A dream that never was
An idea you think you come from
All night
When you can't look at the day

I had what I had
And god damn
I would change
Not a single thing
So smile, wave
Then let go

All night
Do you still feel part of something loud?
All night
Are you such a different person now?
A dream that never was
An idea you think you come from
All night
When you can't look at the day

(All night)
When you can't look at the day
(All night)
When you can't look at the day
