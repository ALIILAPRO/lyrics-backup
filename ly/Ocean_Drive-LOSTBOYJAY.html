		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Crusin' down ocean drive all night
Coke white whip, Miami Vice
Give her that life till she see the light
Rollin' up gas I need a light

416 Going MIA
Yeah she wanna ride, surf my wave
She said she wanna leave, where's your place
Go ahead girl lead the way

She got two phones what you need
I call the plug when I need the re-up
Red bottoms on her feet
Didn't know the devil was a diva

She got two phones what you need
I call the plug when I need the re-up
Red bottoms on her feet
Didn't know the devil was a diva

Please don't talk unless you got something worth saying
I been through it all girl I ain't playing
All of these fakes got me "How Sway"-ing
If you come to the spot then you know we spraying (Like)

I can come to your place or you can come to mine
Stuck in your thoughts girl all the time
Wet dreams got you going wild
I got you turning side to side

I got you turning side to side
Side to side, side to side
I got you turning side to side
Side to side, side to side

Crusin' down ocean drive all night
Coke white whip, Miami Vice
Give her that life till she see the light
Rollin' up gas I need a light

416 Going MIA
Yeah she wanna ride, surf my wave
She said she wanna leave, where's your place
Go ahead girl lead the way

Crusin' down ocean drive all night
Coke white whip, Miami Vice
Give her that life till she see the light
Rollin' up gas I need a light

416 Going MIA
Yeah she wanna ride, surf my wave
She said she wanna leave, where's your place
Go ahead girl lead the way

She got two phones what you need
I call the plug when I need the re-up
Red bottoms on her feet
Didn't know the devil was a diva

She got two phones what you need
I call the plug when I need the re-up
Red bottoms on her feet
Didn't know the devil was a diva
