		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That's my man (man)
Flood my wrist with all type of bands (bands)
I've been blossomin', all type of strands (ayy)
Can you get your neck and wrist on flood? Yes I can (blat, blat, ah)

Light it up, light it up, (woo) light it up, light it up (woo)
Light it up, light it up, (woo) light it up, light it up (woo)
Light it up, light it up, (woo) light it up, light it up (woo)
Light it up, light it up, (woo) light it up, light it up (woo)

I just spilled sauce in the Benz
Oh yes, I'ma do it again
I just now turnt up my bitch
And she just been shoppin' and shit
Damn, I can't do nothin' with Jeezy
And I plan on dyin' like this
I had to Balmain my tweezers
Now they just notice I'm lit
.357 for my mama and them
I was one of the ones with Obama 'dem
I play it safe with my commas now
Y'all niggas worse than your mamas now
Ain't had to go to the pulpit
I got to sit with the government
I got a team up at Popeye's
Even at the airport, we mob ties

The Cartier frames are flooded
I look at the Bentley Mulsanne with my mama
Lil' shawty, lil' shawty, she bustin'
Lil' shawty gon' fuck her a rich nigga, pants off
Where is the chicken? Go right back to Popeye's
Gotta give it to Pedro
Light-skinned bitch with a dark side
But I'll never go fuck up with bae, though

Turn it up, burn it up, (woo) burn it up, burn it up (woo)
Burn it up, burn it up, (woo) burn it up, burn it up (woo)
Burn it up, burn it up, (woo) burn it up, burn it up (woo)
Burn it up, burn it up, (woo) burn it up, burn it up (woo)

It's way too late, just do it for the sake
It's way too late, to try goin' on a date (ayy, ayy)
I took the pink one night, now I got the blue diamond in my face (ba-bing)
I done gave her the keys to the house, might as well gon' give her the code to the safe
Can't replace him 'cause that's my man (my, my man)
Shit, a hunnid thou', all hunnids in my hand (it's in my hand, yeah, yeah)
Half a million to the chain gang, yeah the can (to the can, shit)
'Nother half a million spread it on my hands (half a mil', yeah)
Yeah, that's great, but can you catch my slang? (Woo)
All I ever do is buy, I bought her beans
Fast cars get me through the traffic, Sandy Springs
Paul Walker, this your Porsche, got turbo and the wings (2019)
Aw baby, tell me what you wanted, what you seen when you was out (finesse)
Tell me what you're trippin', what you're trippin' about (yeah)
You got karats on your toes and your link and your spout (I got karats)
Rose gold mixed with white and you rock cinnamon now (rose)
I done made you take the diamonds off from Tiffany now (take them off)
I done told you watch this planet, ain't no sympathy now (no sympathy)
Gucci your neck, fuck boys, they been talkin' 'bout
Spend a Gafford on your ring, now I'm ready to bow now

Baby, let's go (light it up) whoa (light it up) whoa (light it up) whoa (light it up)
let's go (light it up) whoa (light it up) whoa (light it up) whoa (light it up)
Baby, let's go (light it up) whoa (light it up) whoa (light it up) whoa (light it up)
Go (light it up) (fantastic), whoa (light it up) whoa (light it up) (fantastic), whoa (light it up)
Let's go

I just spilled sauce in the Benz
Oh yes, I'ma do it again
I just now turnt up my bitch
And she just been shoppin' and shit
Damn, I can't do nothin' with Jeezy
And I plan on dyin' like this
I had to Balmain my tweezers
Now they just notice I'm lit
.357 for my mama and them
I was one of the ones with Obama 'dem
I play it safe with my commas now
Y'all niggas worse than your mamas now
Ain't had to go to the pulpit
I got to sit with the government
I got a team up at Popeye's
Even at the airport, we mob ties (yeah, baby, let's go)

Turn it up (whoa), burn it up (whoa), burn it up (whoa), burn it up (whoa)
Burn it up (whoa), burn it up (whoa), burn it up (whoa), burn it up (whoa)
(Baby let's go) burn it up (whoa), burn it up (whoa), burn it up (whoa), burn it up (whoa)
Burn it up (whoa), burn it up (whoa), burn it up (whoa), burn it up (whoa)
