		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I said they're drivin' that funky soul
In Georgia, drivin' that funky soul, drivin' that funky soul
And you cross your tongue in Baltimore
Philadelphia, ha!

Join Chicago, St. Louis, Houston
I said Dallas, wow!
Cape Cove, the next-door neighbor
They're drivin' that funky soul

Raise up, get yourself together
And drive your funky soul
Raise up, get yourself together
And drive that funky soul

And I believe, they're drivin' their self
With that funky soul in Houston, Texas
They're gettin' their self together with the funky soul
In Mobile, Alabama, they gettin' that funky soul

Raise up, get yourself together
And drive that funky soul

Los Angeles, raise up, get yourself together
And drive that funky soul
Birmingham, raise up get yourself together
And drive that funky soul

On the Island Mama
Get yourself together, drive that funky soul
Raise up, get yourself together
And drive that funky soul

I'm goin' to get it
I'm goin' to get it
Gotta' get some money
And drive that funky soul.

Gotta' get some money
Gotta' get some money
I need a lil' bit a money
Oh, yeah, I need a lil' bit a money

Fred, I need a one million
Two million, three million

Brotha!
(Yeah)
So what about it?
Will one million be enough?
(Better get two)
Well since my man got three
Well man you better get three
You understand, can I use the three?

Take 'em on home Fred
Take 'em!

Get up get yourself together
And drive that funky soul

Woo!
That is
That is

That is, what is that?
Get up, raise up, raise up, raise up
Woo!
Raise up, raise up, raise

Raise on up, get yourself together
Drive that funky soul
Raise up, get yourself together
And drive that funky soul

You don't miss nothin' you never had
But you miss so much you wish you could get, ha!
I guess you can out that together

It takes a man to find a woman
And takes a woman to find what a man used to be

Get up, get on up
Get yourself together
Drive that funky soul

Everybody knows somebody
Who can drive that funky soul?
Everybody knows somebody
Who can drive that funky soul?

Get up, get yourself together
And drive your funky soul

Raise up, get yourself together
And drive that funky soul
Raise up, get yourself together
And drive that funky soul

Raise up, since we had it groovin'
You know
