		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We skip past the talking, right to the bedroom
You looked to die for and that's why I let you
Come and spend the night like every time that you call
I've been falling hard, I guess that makes it my fault
When you look at me something is missing
I'm holding you close but you keep your distance
We get under covers and we get personal
But you don't really know me as a person at all

You only love me, only love me when the lights are low
You wouldn't want me if you knew all of the parts you don't
You see me different in the dark (In the dark, no)
You don't want more than what we are, what we are, oh
You only love me, only love the way I use my hands
I think you're falling for a fantasy of who I am
You see me different in the dark (In the dark, no)
But I want more than what we are, what we are, oh

It's nothing but surface, you act like it's pouring
When I try to know you better, then you rush out in the morning
I wish I didn't care so much, I know you'll never stay because

You only love me, only love me when the lights are low
You wouldn't want me if you knew all of the parts you don't
You see me different in the dark (In the dark, no)
You don't want more than what we are, what we are, oh
You only love me, only love the way I use my hands
I think you're falling for a fantasy of who I am
You see me different in the dark (In the dark, no)
But I want more than what we are, what we are, oh

But I want more than what we are, what we are, oh

You only love me, only love me when the lights are low
You wouldn't want me if you knew all of the parts you don't
You see me different in the dark (In the dark, no)
You don't want more than what we are, what we are, oh
