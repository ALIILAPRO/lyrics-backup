		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On your way out, turn the lights out
Take your supermodels and your broken beer bottles
I don't care, party anywhere
I'm broke man, possibly beyond repair

This is the best, this is the best,
My head is such a fucking mess
This is the best, crack house arrest,
My head's a mess

Well I woke up on a Monday
I've been feeling pretty wired
I've been wide awake since Wednesday
I was feeling so inspired
By the state of my own execution
Drop me 'cause I can't let go

On my way down, kill the lights now
Gimme Calcium and put me in the lost and found
I don't care, throw me anywhere
I'm cool man, possibly beyond repair

This is the best, this is the best,
My head is such a fucking mess
This is the best, crack house arrest,
My head's a mess

Well I woke up on a Monday
I've been feeling pretty wired
I've been wide awake since Wednesday
I was feeling so inspired
By the state of my own execution
Drop me 'cause I can't let go

On my way up, wish me good luck
Mission control I'm crushing like a monster truck
I should care, but I don't care
I fucking don't care, don't care

Well I woke up on a Monday
I've been feeling pretty wired
I've been wide awake since Wednesday
I was feeling so inspired
By the state of my own execution
Drop me 'cause I can't let go

This is the best, this is the best
Probably 'cause I can't let go
This is the best, this is the best
Stop me 'cause I can't say no
