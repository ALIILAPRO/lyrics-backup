		  Why
Why
Why

This is why I don't leave the house
You say the coast is clear but you won't catch me out
Oh, why? This is why
Why

If you have an opinion
Maybe you should shove it
Or maybe you could scream it
It might be best to keep it
To yourself, to yourself
Why

This is why I don't leave the house
You say the coast is clear but you won't catch me out
Oh, why? This is why
This is why I don't leave the house
You say the coast is clear but you won't catch me out
Oh, why? This is why, why

One step beyond your door
It might as well have been a free fall
One step beyond your door
Falling down an endless hall
One step beyond your door
Might as well have been a free fall
One step beyond your door
Floating like a cannonball

Better have conviction
We want crimes of passion
Survival of the fittest
You're either with us or, or you can keep it
To yourself, to yourself
To yourself, yourself, yourself
To yourself, why

This is why I don't leave the house
You say the coast is clear, but, oh no, you won't catch me out
This is why I don't leave the house
You say the coast is clear, but, oh no, you won't catch me out
This is why I don't leave the house
You say the coast is clear, but, oh no, you won't catch me out
This is why I don't leave the house
You say the coast is clear, but, oh no, you won't catch me out

This is why I don't leave the house
You say the coast is clear, but, oh no, you won't catch me out
This is why I don't leave the house
You say the coast is clear, but, oh no, you won't catch me out
This is why I don't leave the house
You say the coast is clear, but, oh no, you won't catch me out
This is why I don't leave the house
You say the coast is clear, but, oh no, you won't catch me out

Oh, why? This is why
Oh, why? This is why

One step beyond your door
One step beyond your door
One step beyond your door
