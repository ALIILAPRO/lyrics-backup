		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Haunted by forces that suck you in
That pull you under, mm, tight
And your words are engraved in me
So long as guilt resides here
Carved into the walls in writing
With our broken hearts imprinted beside it

I didn't want you to leave me
I didn't want to leave you
I didn't want you to leave me
I didn't want to leave you

Didn't want you to leave, want you, want
Didn't want you to leave, want you, want you
Didn't want you to leave, want you, want
Didn't want you to leave, want you, want you

I didn't want to leave you
I didn't want to leave you
I didn't want to leave you
I didn't want to leave you

I didn't want to leave you
I didn't want to leave you
I didn't want to leave you
I didn't want to leave you
