		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Blood and tears
Blood and tears
Since you've been gone
I hear you've been crying
Blood and tears

All alone
In your misery
So alone
Could you have
Been deceived
Since I've been gone
I hear you been crying

You cry a thousand tears
Darling don't despair
I know your heart still bleeds
Darling don't you care
There's blood in your tears

All alone
In your misery
So
All alone
You are lost
Endlessly
Since you've been gone
I hear you been crying
