		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I like no blueberries in my ice cream cake
No air to breathe with that masking tape
Stop please
I need a hostage free
I need a rocket ship
I need to run from

I like no blueberries in my ice cream cake
No air to breathe with that masking tape
Stop please
I need a hostage free
I need a rocket ship
I need to run from

From you
I'm just kind of lost
I fall from you
I've been looking down a lot
I fall from you
I'm falling way too soft
I fall from you
Now tell me when to stop

Oh no
Here we go again to this beat
Oh no
Tell me why you want to be so sweet
Tell me what's in your eyes baby
Red, green, or blue
Welcome to the other side
I keep losing my temper for you
I love it how you think I'm always this cool
Excusez-moi I think I'm just a fool
Afraid of what's in your eyes baby
Red, green, or blue
Welcome to the other side

I like no blueberries in my ice cream cake
No air to breathe with that masking tape
Stop please
I need a hostage free
I need a rocket ship
I need to run from

From you
I'm just kind of lost
I fall from you
I've been looking down a lot
I fall from you
I'm falling way too soft
I fall from you
Now tell me when to stop

Coming to you live
Yo mito, pass me the tape, tape
시끄러워 don't make me shoot
Scene full of rappers
전부다 맛없어
We need to go

Drop to the floor (floor)
움직여 we blow (blow)
어쩌겟어 너무 stylish 
The way we

I'm a vibey villain
Mi amor yeah oh she knows it

She's in love with me
And that's a drug in, dangerous doses

And I'm in love with your poses
Can't see straight, can't focus
Get chills when I see your O-face
You're the coldest (coldest) 
IITE COOL

I like no blueberries in my ice cream cake
No air to breathe with that masking tape
Stop please
I need a hostage free
I need a rocket ship
I need to run from

From you
I'm just kind of lost
I fall from you
I've been looking down a lot
I fall from you
I'm falling way too soft
I fall from you
Now tell me when to stop

So now you've blown all your covers
I got this blue to make you come up
So when you think it's almost over
I got this blue to make you come up 

So now you've blown all your covers (before I forget)
I got this blue to make you come up
So when you think it's almost over (before I lose it)
I got this blue to make you come up
