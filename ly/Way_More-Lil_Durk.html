		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh

You different (Different)
Got you some lil' money, actin' different (Actin' different)
Thought my mind was playin' tricks on me, I'm trippin' (Thought I was trippin')
And I always speak my mind, I'm so 'pecific (So 'pecific)
I see this brother shit we doin', this shit ain't workin' (Shit ain't workin', no)
God put me on this Earth for a purpose (For a purpose, yeah)
The toughest nigga in the room, they be workin' (They be workin')
Like they'll turn me to snake, but it ain't worth it, nuh (Worth it, no)

And I'll cut you off, ain't comin' right
Night time, hungry, hold my tummy tight
Can't repeat what I seen them summer nights
They don't wanna see us come alive

How the niggas who went Hollywood stay rappin' 'bout the trenches?
Had to cut niggas off who was all in their feelings
I told him cut his bitch off, seen her ridin' with them niggas
And I find that shit crazy, they hate with who begins 'em
Yeah, I'm so 10 toes, I'm who they fuckin' with
Them niggas talkin' bad about me, tell 'em suck a dick
I told my brothers that we blood, I don't know who my cousins
And if you is, you hang with them, you know what it is
I swear I'd go back to jail for all my brother kids
I swear I'd go back to jail to see my brothers live
Shoot you, then follow the ambulance, make sure you dead for real
Your parents rich, you silver spoon, my family ain't left a will
And we ain't doin' no sneaky talk, their ass had left for real
And why he talkin' out his chest like he is made of steel?
Them niggas ain't worried 'bout no shooters, them niggas made to kill
I put my heart inside my music, I got pain for real
Jackson lost his grandma, I got pain for him
Made me call my grandma way more
And since she changed my life, I gotta change yours
You say you like my niggas, but I hate yours

You different (Different)
Got you some lil' money, actin' different (Actin' different)
Thought my mind was playin' tricks on me, I'm trippin' (Thought I was trippin')
And I always speak my mind, I'm so 'pecific (So 'pecific)
I see this brother shit we doin', this shit ain't workin' (Shit ain't workin', no)
God put me on this Earth for a purpose (For a purpose, yeah)
The toughest nigga in the room, they be workin' (They be workin')
Like they'll turn me to snake, but it ain't worth it (Worth it, no)

And I'll cut you off, ain't comin' right
Night time, hungry, hold my tummy tight
Can't repeat what I seen them summer nights
They don't wanna see us come alive

I had talent, you ain't believe me
Then you tried to come around like this shit was easy
When you not around, that shit like Mario without Luigi
Put her in that St. Laurent, I took her out that Bebe
Told my mama that I'm famous, see me on the TV
And I gotta play for keeps, I know my vultures need me
That Perky got me E.T., I got her suckin' weewee
I know some niggas tear your face off, GP
I elevated
Had to go and take off, I never waited
On God, I love your ass to death, I never hated
And you ain't come from the bottom, you by the basement, uh
Me and you was splittin' chicken wings from Harold's Chicken
Me and you, goin' house to house for Thanksgiving
Me and you, said the drugs give a strange feelin'
Me and you, me and you, me and you
Uno, dos, tres and, one, two, thee blessings
Goin' to different cities, we don't ever check in
All my shooters different, they gon' give us leverage
You leave, you can't get back in
I swear it

(Oh-oh) You different (Different)
Got you some lil' money, actin' different (Actin' different)
Thought my mind was playin' tricks on me, I'm trippin' (Thought I was trippin')
And I always speak my mind, I'm so specific (So specific)
I see this brother shit we doin', this shit ain't workin' (Shit ain't workin', no)
God put me on this Earth for a purpose (For a purpose, yeah)
The toughest nigga in the room, they be workin' (They be workin')
Like they'll turn me to snake, but it ain't worth it (Worth it, no)

And I'll cut you off, ain't comin' right
Night time, hungry, hold my tummy tight
Can't repeat what I seen them summer nights
They don't wanna see us come alive
