		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I took a walk through the city one night
I saw some faces but I wanna be found
Her eyelids juxtaposed with her light shining so bright
And her crowd camouflaging never let me down
I took a drive through the country one night
Some little beds all dusty and dry
Oh, banks were parched and the heavens were dark
And the clouds, they began to cry
Here's what they say

A new day is coming
A new day is coming
A new day is coming up foremost
But don't be sad, leave your past in the past
Let that new day gloss all over us

I took a trip to the back of my mind
I saw men I recognize
I know I got so bad coming
I can't get hung up all day
Pull my chest in and I'll let it rise
Ain't that right?

A new day is coming
A new day is coming
A new day is coming up foremost
But make no mistake, you had some bad breaks
But that new day is bound to dawn for us
Yeah, I get by

A new day is coming
A new day is coming
A new day is coming up foremost
And a new day is coming
A new day is coming
A new day is coming up foremost
But don't be sad, leave your words in the past
Let that new day dawn over us
