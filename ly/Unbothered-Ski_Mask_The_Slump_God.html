		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yuh (dun, dun, da, dun, dun, dun)
Yuh, okay, yuh
Check my sleep, sauce I spit
Let me just talk my shit
Is it cold in here to you?
Wet
Woah, Kenny
Lil' bitch, yuh

Big drip like spit from a big rick
Fendi on my collar, I'm a real rich prick (wet!)
Just like some extra pee, shake em' off my dick (aye!)
Too much sauce, broke my hip (ay, ay)
Caution, you might need emergency kit (ay, ay)
Coffin, anything I fuck went real (Real, real)
Feeling like a tongue, cause I'm moving like a lick (aye!)
One thousand dollar shoes, same color Pickle Rick (feelin' like a)
Yohji Yamamoto
Diamonds like sudoku (sudoku)
Runnin' round the city in a toga eating noodles
(Runnin' round the city eatin')
Think I'm a star, chill in there Pluto (water)
Huh, yuh, you knew though (you knew though)
I'm on a roll, just like a lobster (look at it)
These niggas imposters, acting like the coppers (water)
My diamonds wetter than damn Davy Jones locker (yah, yah)
Sir Ski Slump, yup, bad motherfucker

They feel me like braille (they feel me like)
She wet like a whale (she wet like a)
I pull up, they bail (bail)
Well (deet, deet, bail, deet)
They wishing me well (well)
I don't fuck with 12 (12, I don't fuck with)
Cause that is a L (ooh)
L's (L, L, L, L, L, L), yeah

I'ma take your bitch out to Denny's
(I'ma take your bitch out to)
Trappin' like I'm trapping in Benny
(Trappin' like I'm trapping in the)
Beat? That bitch, came from woah, Kenny
(Beat? That bitch, came from woah, aye)
My bitch same color as Henny (Henny)
Order same color, it's pennies (ay, ay, ay, pennies)
Spank that bitch like I'm her nanny (ooh, nanny)
Pack up on a nigga like a fanny
I'm in a Phantom like my name is Danny, huh (Hey, Danny!)
VLONE (ay, ay, ay, ay), cost a nigga green like Ceelo (C, C, Ceelo)
I pop up with the pistol like a cheat code
(Phew, phew, phew)
And that bitch bust it like a freak hoe
(Phew, phew, phew, wet, wet, wet)
Ooh, mink coat (mink coat, mink coat, yup)
Cost me a cinco (cinco, cinco, huh?)
Jewelry it be wetter than a sink hoe (wetter than a)
They think that I'm Cuban cause the links hoe, uh
(Huh, huh, huh)

They feel me like braille (they feel me like)
She wet like a whale (she wet like a)
I pull up, they bail (bail)
Well (deet, deet, well, deet)
They wishing me well (well)
I don't fuck with 12 (12, I don't fuck with)
Cause that is a L (ooh)
L's (L, L, L, L, L, L), yeah
They feel me like braille (they feel me like)
She wet like a whale (she wet like a)
I pull up, they bail (bail)
Well (deet, deet, bail, deet)
They wishing me well (well)
I don't fuck with 12 (12, I don't fuck with)
Cause that is a L (ooh)
L's (L, L, L, L, L, L, L, L), yeah
