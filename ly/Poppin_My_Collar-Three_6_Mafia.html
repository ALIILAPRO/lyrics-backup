		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now ever since I can remember, I've been poppin' my collar
Poppin'-poppin' my collar, poppin'-poppin' my collar
Now ever since I can remember, I've been workin' these hoes
And they better put my money in my hand (in my hand)

Now ever since I can remember, I've been poppin' my collar
Poppin'-poppin' my collar, poppin'-poppin' my collar
Now ever since I can remember, I've been workin' these hoes
And they better put my money in my hand (in my hand)

I know you sicker than sick-ahh
When you see the rims flick-ahh
The paint drip off, ice in my Range glitt-ahh
I straight flipp-ahh
The cheese like pancake-ahh
Foldin' my cheese like the leaves in my hand rake-ahh
Project Pat-ter
Attracted to dime pieces
I'm dirty southern, French braids, gold teeth-ahh's
I'm out here makin' cents, plus, I'm out here makin' dollars
I keep a bad broad, though, and a popped collar

She's just another hoe that I met in the hood
I told her I was Crunchy Black and it was all good
She might as well go on head and suck on my wood
And let me whisper something in her ear if I could (if I could)

Now ever since I can remember, I've been poppin' my collar
Poppin'-poppin' my collar, poppin'-poppin' my collar
Now ever since I can remember, I've been workin' these hoes
And they better put my money in my hand (in my hand)

Now ever since I can remember, I've been poppin' my collar
Poppin'-poppin' my collar, poppin'-poppin' my collar
Now ever since I can remember, I've been workin' these hoes (yeah)
And they better put my money (yeah) in my hand (in my hand, in my hand)

Now when it comes to getting bread I got the keys to the bakery
A lot of dudes swear they play, man they some fake-ery
Let me catch a girl up out some work in my site
And believe I'm gon' be atcha in the daylight with a flashlight
I'm tryin' to get paid however money is made
A lot dudes like to pay ladies to get laid
But me, I ain't no pimp (pimp), I just love to borrow
Paper from a fat bitch, a ugly bitch, a model for real

Well you know me by the Juice man hangin' out with Big Triece
Standin' on the porch, drinkin' liquor, drunk, smokin' weed
Trying to get a paycheck, but work that ain't came yet
That's why I stay in a girl ear, to keep that pussy wet

Now ever since I can remember, I've been poppin' my collar
Poppin'-poppin' my collar, poppin'-poppin' my collar
Now ever since I can remember, I've been workin' these hoes
And they better put my money in my hand (in my hand)

Now ever since I can remember, I've been poppin' my collar
Poppin'-poppin' my collar, poppin'-poppin' my collar
Now ever since I can remember, I've been workin' these hoes
And they better put my money in my hand (in my hand)

In my hand (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Poppin' my collar (yeah, yeah, yeah), poppin' poppin' my collar
Poppin' my collar (yeah, yeah, yeah), poppin' poppin' my collar
Collar, collar, collar
