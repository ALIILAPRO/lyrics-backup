		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say I'm trippin', bullshit
You're the one to make me do shit
You're the one to make me feel it
The feeling of stupid
I was in your corner
When you were putting me through shit
Now you wanna leave
No, you leaving me was foolish

You left me this scar on my heart
And I left you a brand new car
How nice of you, the price of true love
True love is absolute

So what more can I say?
You make me this way
What more can I say?
You make me this way

Yeah, all of these excuses
Say I'm the one that made you ruthless
But you're the reason I'm crazy
And with you I feel useless
I let you have it
You took me for granted
Always wanna play the victim
When they don't know the truth is

You left me this scar on my heart
When I'd never take it that far (oh)
Why would you say that it was true love
If true love is absolute, what more can I say?

What more can I say?
You make me this way
(You make me this way)
What more can I say?
(What can I say?)
You make me this way

I tried to stay the night
You won't let me inside
Oh, you push me away
You'll never change
Just another fight
Between you and your pride
Oh, what more can I say?
What more can I?

What more can I say? (Say)
You make me this way
You make me this way
What more can I say?
What more?
You make me this way (way)
Whoa, can't lie
