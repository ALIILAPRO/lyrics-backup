		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As the embers rose through the Roman sky
Tell me were you calm when they took your life?

Just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow
Weightless evermore, as you walk beyond that door
Shine forever true

Shared with us the world well before your time
Though they took your voice words forever shine

Just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow
Weightless evermore, as you walk beyond that door
Shine forever true

As they spoke your fate a fearless man replied
"As you will sentence me, your fear is beyond mine"

Just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow
Weightless evermore, as you walk beyond that door
Shine forever true
