		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Down in the depths of my fiery home 
The summons bell will chime 
Tempting you and all the earth 
To join our sinful kind 
There is a job to be done and I'm the one 
You people make me do it 
Now it is time for your fate and I won't hesitate 
To pull you down into this pit 

So come on 
Jump in the fire 
So come on 
Jump in the fire 

With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins 
The end is closing in 
Feeding on the minds of man 
And from their souls within 
My disciples all shout to search out 
And they always shall obey 
Follow me now my child not the meek or the mild 
Do just as I say 

So come on 
Jump in the fire 
So come on 
Jump in the fire 

Jump by your will or be taken by force 
I'll get you either way 
Trying to keep the hell fire lit 
I am stalking you as prey 
Living your life as me I am you you see 
So reach down grab my hand walk with me through the land 
Come home where you belong 

So come on 
Jump in the fire 
So come on 
Jump in the fire

So come on 
Jump in the fire 
So come on 
Jump in the fire

Come on jump in, yeah!
