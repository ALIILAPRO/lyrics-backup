		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No one could find you
Out on your own
All things I loved
But do not know
On Hopewall road

These days of candy
Live in your mind
Those violet lines
White fenced in miles
Across my eyes

A world inside you
No photograph
My natural one
The rising sun
Live in your mind

Just like that, it's gone
Just like that, it's gone
Just like that

I know it comes too soon
The universe is riding off with you

Hi o, out there, I know
A little bit of you, I keep it close to me
I know it comes too soon
The universe is riding off with you

I know it comes too soon
I know it stays for nobody
I want to know you there
The universe is riding off with you
