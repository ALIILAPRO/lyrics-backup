		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think of you
As I think of myself
I look from where I stand
And see deep water below

Are you there
Or are you somewhere else
I've wondered where
Ever since then

[Chorus]
Won't you take me back there again
I dreamt of drowning
But it never was as good as when
You'd take me down and under

I could have told you
The same thing yesterday
But I could not find
The words I wanted to say
You never listened to me anyway
I've wondered why
Ever since then

[Chorus: x2]

Why can't we go back there now
You could take my hand
And we could go back like before
I'd like to go down there once more
