		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna show you a love so good
It can last forever
I will take you into a place
Where you and I remember

Take my hands pull me close
Take my hands love me
Take my hands pull me close

Baby don't let me go
No, no don't let me go
Baby don't let me go

You know I love the way you do what you do
Maybe we can go all night
There are no days, there are no nights
That I don't think about you

Say the words, don't close up
I wanna know
I wanna know
How much, how much you love me

Baby don't let me go
No, no don't let me go
Baby don't let me go
No, no don't let me go
No, no don't let me go
Baby don't let me go
Baby don't let me go

Take my hands pull me close
Wanna know
Wanna know
How much, how much you love me
I wanna know
Wanna know
How much, how much you love me

Baby don't let me go
No, no don't let me go
Baby don't let me go
No, no don't let me go
No, no don't let me go
Baby don't let me go
Baby don't let me go
