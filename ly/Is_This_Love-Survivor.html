		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've heard talk of blind devotion
Lovers through thick and thin
Lives touched with real emotion
Faithful 'til the bitter end

Now, I must admit that the story's attractive
I've lost in far too many affairs
I've seen all the pain that the morning can bring
I need to prove to myself
This is more than a crush
Can you convince me it's not just a physical rush

Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love that's been keepin' me up all night
Is this love that I'm feelin
Is this love

So many nights in blind confusion
I've walked the line of love
We reach out in disillusion
When one night isn't nearly enough
Now, I'd like to know that for once in my life
I'm sure of what tomorrow may bring
I've heard all your talk ,can I take it to heart
Now look me straight in the eye
'Cause tonight is the night
We've got to ask each other if the moment is right

Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love that's been keepin' me up all night
Is this love that I'm feelin
Is this love

I've tread those mean streets, blind alleys
Where the currency of love changes hands
All touch -- no feelin'
Just another one night stand
I need to know that there's someone who cares
Could you be the angel to answer my prayer?

Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love that's been keepin' me up all night
Is this love that I'm feelin
Is this love
