		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  22 and oh lord I'm seeing red
I bought a gun last night
Cause god I'm afraid of death

Oh and I never say no never stay home
Never wanna stop but I don't wanna go
Mmm mmm

Sorry if I'm shady, lately
You know I've been changing, crazy
Wasting away mmm
Baby, lately you found you can't change me
And you know you can't change the truth
But honey, I can change for you
Honey, I can change for you
Honey, I can change for you

Too late for me to come around
Oh and I'm so fucked up
And everybody's bringing me down
Oh is it all about me all the money
All about always wanting more
Mmm, I always want more, more

Sorry if I'm shady, lately
You know I've been changing, crazy
Wasting away oh
Baby, lately you found you can't change me
And you know you can't change the truth
But honey, I can change for you
Honey, I can change for you
Honey, I can change for you

Out of sorts and oh lord we're turning blue
But we found a strange way
Of saying the same thing
With nothing to lose

Oh and we never say no never stay home
Never wanna stop but we don't wanna go
Mmm

Sorry if I'm shady, lately
You know I've been changing, crazy
Wasting away oh
Baby, lately you found you can't change me
And you know you can change the truth
But honey, I can change for you
Honey, I can change for you
Honey, I can change for you
Honey, I can change for you
