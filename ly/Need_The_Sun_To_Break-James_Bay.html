		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm halfway gone, sleepless I'm battle-worn
You're all I want, so bring me the dawn

I need the sun to break, you've woken up my heart
I'm shaking, all my luck could change
Been in the dark for weeks and I've realized you're all I need 
And I hope that I'm not too late,
I hope I'm not too late

Back of the room, how come my friends already know you?
I feel like a kid, too shy to speak up so I keep it hid
Oh butterflies, you steal my sleep each night

I need the sun to break, you've woken up my heart
I'm shaking, all my luck could change
Been in the dark for weeks and I've realized you're all I need 
And I hope I'm not too late
And I hope I'm not too late

Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

Oh no

I need the sun to break, you've woken up my heart
I'm shaking, all my luck could change
Been in the dark for weeks and I've realized you're all I need
I hope that I'm not too late
And I hope I'm not too late
Oh now yes I hope I'm not too late

Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oo-oh-oh, oh, oh
