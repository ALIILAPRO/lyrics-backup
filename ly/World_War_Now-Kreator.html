		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Suddenly we are at war
Supremacists have forced us to align
With fear itself the poisoner
The final level with no front lines
Epochal evil spirits of depression
Breaking free
Dogmatists of horror
Start the fires randomly
Watch a massacre becoming cultural genocide
Lost rebel youth demonized

See the pain
Hear the cries
Seeds of hate
Sowed by lies
Darkest times
Hold your ground
As the tyrants
Scream it out

World war now

Suddenly we are at war
Vultures climb the rotting corpse of truth
Unbearable atrocities
Where paranoia's dictating the rules
Focused on destruction
Troops are blasting silhouettes
Vile aggressors slaughter
Intellectual defense
Literati terrorism conquer and divide
Freedom is the final sacrifice

See the pain, hear the cries
Seeds of hate, sowed by lies
Darkest times, hold your ground
As the tyrants, scream it out
See the pain, feel the fear
Plants of hate, sieged frontier
Darkest times, hold your ground
As the tyrants, scream it out

World war now

Can't you feel our earth is burning
World war now
World war now
One million hands turn into fists
Can't you feel the end is coming
World war now
World war now
Six billion souls at the abyss
This is world war now

See the pain, hear the cries
Seeds of hate, sowed by lies
Don't give in, tear them down
As the tyrants, scream it out
See the pain, feel the fear
Plants of hate, sieged frontier
Darkest times, hold your ground
As the tyrants, scream it out
Aaaaaargh
World war now
World war now
