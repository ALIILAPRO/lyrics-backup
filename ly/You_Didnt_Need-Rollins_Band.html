		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The last person you blame is yourself and you feel like a victim and it feels
great to be put upon by love

You turned me and you put me out
You put me in and you locked me out
The way you feel is gonna cross me back
You didn't see that I was bleedin'
You looked at me and I saw right through you
You looked away when I spoke right to you

You didn't need to do that to me
When I touched you, did you feel it?
Did you ever feel anything at all?
Do you ever lie awake at night? 
Do you ever think of me?
I've got my arms wrapped around myself
You've got your arms around someone else
I'll lie to myself
I'll tell myself I'm not there, down, down, down
I'm not down
Some people are left alone
Some people are left alone

I didn't want it but I get it anyway
I didn't want it but I couldn't get away
I can't deny it, I miss you
Even though it hurts inside
When I breathe I kiss you
I keep on lyin', lyin'

You didn't need to do that to me
I lock my brain tryin' to remember
Anything I did to you
I lock my brain tryin' to dismember
Every thought I taxed for you
I'm sorry I still feel this pain inside
You punctured my face like a scar
It's simple, I can't hide, I can't hide, I can't hide, no!

Some people have been left alone
Some people are let alone
It hurts so much when you've got nothing to say
It hurts so much to have to walk away
Walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away
Walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away
