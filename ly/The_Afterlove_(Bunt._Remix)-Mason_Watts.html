		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Driving you home in my car
I say I’ll see you tomorrow
We both know tomorrow’s too late for us
The afterlove

We’ve been like one from the start
But we've been growing apart
Ashes to ashes dust to dust
The afterlove

This is the end but it cant be the end for us
If there’s another life when our time is up

Oh I’ll be waiting, hoping, praying
You’ll come back as you darling I’ll come back as me
In the afterlove

For a new chance a new try and a new life
You’ll come back as you darling I’ll come back as me
In the afterlove

A different world different place
Your same old soul different face
We’ll meet again you mark my words
In the afterlove

Till then go find someone else
That makes you happy as hell
Just don’t forget who loved you first
The afterlove

This is the end but it cant be the end for us
If there’s another life when our time is up

Oh I’ll be waiting, hoping, praying
You’ll come back as you darling I’ll come back as me
In the afterlove

For a new chance a new try and a new life
You’ll come back as you darling I’ll come back as me
In the afterlove

Oh oh oh

As this life, passes by
Know that you’re on my mind
We’ll meet again on the other side

Oh I’ll be waiting hoping praying
You’ll come back as you darling I’ll come back as me
In the afterlove

For a new chance a new try and a new life
You’ll come back as you darling I’ll come back as me
In the afterlove
