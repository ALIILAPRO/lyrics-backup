		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have a knife in my heart I could never explain
Cloned from a killer, I crawled out the drain
Done from the start, there's a short in my brain
To some, it may hurt, but to me it's just pain

The critics never forget it
This ain't a game
I'm gonna talk it, I ain't ashamed
I'm gonna walk it, I'll never be tamed

Open windows, closing doors
God can't help us anymore
Souls forever come and go
Burn all the bridges and fire in the hole

Ugly I can be, what you know about me
I'm a pirate and a thief, that you'll never fucking see
There comes a point in time, put it all on the line
I'm gonna get mine, I come to take mine

The critics never forget it
This ain't a game
I'm gonna talk it, I ain't ashamed
I'm gonna walk it, I'll never be tamed

Open windows, closing doors
God can't help us anymore
Souls forever come and go
Burn all the bridges and fire in the hole
Burn all the bridges and fire in the hole

You live, die, past life
You live, die, past life

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Open windows, closing doors
God can't help us anymore
Souls forever come and go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Open windows, closing doors
God can't help us anymore
Souls forever come and go
Burn all the bridges and fire in the hole
Burn all the bridges and fire in the hole
