		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  J.R., Sean Kingston

You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You'll have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over

See it started at the park
Used to chill after dark
Oh when you took my heart
That's when we fell apart

'Cause we both thought
That love last forever (last forever)
They say we too young
To get ourselves sprung

Oh we didn't care
We made it very clear
And they also said
That we couldn't last together (last together)

See it's very defined
You're one of a kind
But you mash up my mind
You haffi get declined
Oh Lord
My baby is driving me crazy

You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You'll have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over

It was back in '99
Watching movies all the time
Oh when I went away
For doing my first crime

And I never thought
That we was gonna see each other (see each other)
And then I came out
Mommy moved me down South

Oh I'm with my girl
Who I thought was my world
It came out to be
That she wasn't the girl for me (girl for me)

See it's very defined
You're one of a kind
But you mash up my mind
You haffi get declined
Oh Lord
My baby is driving me crazy

You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You'll have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over

Now we're fussing
And now we're fighting
Please tell me why
I am feeling slighted
And I don't know
How to make it better (make it better)

You're dating other guys
You're telling me lies
Oh I can't believe
What I'm seeing with my eyes
I'm losing my mind
And I don't think it's clever (think it's clever)

You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You'll have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal, suicidal, suicidal
