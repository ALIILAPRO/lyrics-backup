		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fill your hands with grains of sand
In the rocks you'll see the clocks
Of times that pass
The good, the bad
Your life's a life you'll wish you had

Thought I could run
I could be brave
Nothing to save you, nothing to save
The good, the bad
The times you've had
All stops upon your lily pad
On your lily pad

Go over tides that pull you under
Hold on to daylight and to thunder
When you take on lows
Let the rain flow
You gotta take, you gotta take, you gotta take
On every wave

It hurts to think of what's to come
When I no longer know this place
And all I hear are fading drums
And I cannot recall your face
I'll meet you in the sleepless garden
Close your eyes and see
A future you, remembering how it felt
To kiss tonight's version of me
Of me

Go over tides that pull you under
Hold on to daylight and to thunder
When you take on lows
Let the rain flow
You gotta take, you gotta take, you gotta take
On every wave

I promise
I promise
It's not what you say
No favors
No secrets
None coming my way

Go over tides that pull you under
Hold on to daylight and to thunder
When you take on lows
Let the rain flow
You gotta take, you gotta take, you gotta take
On every wave
