		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nightingale, sing us a song
Of a love that once belonged
Nightingale, tell me your tale
Was your journey far too long?

Does it seem like I'm looking for an answer
To a question I can't ask
I don't know which way the feather falls
Or if I should blow it to the left

Nightingale, sing us a song
Of a love that once belonged
Nightingale, tell me your tale
Was your journey far too long?

All the voices that are spinnin' around me
Trying to tell me what to say
Can I fly right behind you
And you can take me away

All the voices that are spinnin' around me
Trying to tell me what to say
Can I fly right behind you
And you can take me away, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
You can take me away
