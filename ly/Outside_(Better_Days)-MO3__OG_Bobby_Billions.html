		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah

They scared to come outside
Tell them boys they better pray
Tell them boys stay out the way
Tell them ain't nobody safe, on my mama, on my gang
We gon' put it in they face
Yeah
(They're scared to come outside)

Niggas know we steppin' night and day
God know I'm steppin' now and later
Until it hurts, it ain't no mercy, that's just how we made it
You hear that church up in my verses 'cause that's how I'm raised
I told God he gotta forgive me, I'm insane, oh
Get down on my knees when I'm in pain, oh
Tired of the rain on my name
(I cleaned his blood off my Jesus piece)
Oh, Jesus please, can you feel my needs? Yeah
Tired of fuckin' up, I'm in the streets, yeah
Tryna take away this hurt inside of me
(They're scared to come outside)
God, I need a second chance
Knowin' that I love you, but sometimes I do the devil dance
Lost a couple of my partnas, so I'm slidin' out on whoever and
Drop one of them niggas when I kill 'em, call the reverend, yeah
'Cause no weapon formed against me shall prosper, yeah
God know I'm clutchin' on this chopper, yeah
Waitin' on 'em boys outside

(They're scared to come outside)
(Ooh-wee, yeah)
Niggas know we steppin' night and day
Niggas know we steppin' now and later
Until it hurts, it ain't no mercy, that's just how we made it
You hear that church up in my verses, that's just how we raised

Though I feel cursed, I pray for betta days
Seems like yesterday we was catchin' plays
And it's been harder on me lately, I can't catch a break
I'm losing niggas on a day to day, everyday I pray
Only God can take this hate away
Lord knows if I see him I'ma have to spray
You know that same spot I seen him is the spot he laid
(I clean his blood off my Jesus piece)
Jesus, please say there's a heaven for a real one
I had to smoke 'em, even Moses had to kill one
Do it for the bills, I swear this shit is getting ill

(They're scared to come outside)
(Ooh-wee, yeah)
Niggas know we steppin' night and day
(Know I'm steppin' night and day)
Niggas know we steppin' now or later (yeah, yeah)
Until it hurts, it ain't no mercy, that's just how we made
You hear that church up in my verses, that's just how we raised

Oh, you hear that church up in my verse 'cause that's just how I'm raised
Uh, Glock off in my britches that's just how I'm came
Keep a .30 on me, nigga, don't get out the way (why-y-y-y-y)
(Yeah)
Lord, I get my preacher on, yeah
Big ol' Desert Eagle, uh
Flyer than an eagle, big ol' shooter pull up in them Regals, uh
Drop-out, down on my people, this that gang-gang, I put them demons on ya
Pussy ass nigga not equal
We tote heaters, I got that ether, uh
They didn't believe I'm the people choice, uh
They didn't believe in us
Ran down on you in them Adidas, uh, yeah

(They're scared to come outside)
