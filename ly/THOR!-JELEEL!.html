JELEEL!, yeah

Oh-oh

Ain't none changed but my pockets and options
Oh (no)
Yeah (oh, no)
Same shit, gang shit, we solid, we locked in
Ain't none changed but my pockets and options

Pick it up, go
Stick it up, woah
Add it up, go
Stack it up, woah
Pick it up, go
Stick it up, woah
Add it up, go

I be goin' fast in a Range Rove'
And I'm throwin' cash, lot of bankroll
She be throwin' ass in my face, yeah
I'ma run it back like the radio

Oh (on the radio)
Yeah (I ain't worried none, you can hear me, though)
Same shit, gang shit, we solid, we locked in
Ain't none changed but my pockets and options
Oh (on the radio)
Yeah (yeah, it's 'bout time, 'bout time)
Same shit, gang shit, we solid, we locked in
Ain't none changed but my pockets and options

Pick it up, go
Stick it up, woah
Add it up, go
Stack it up, woah
Pick it up, go
Stick it up, woah
Add it up, go
Stack it up, woah
