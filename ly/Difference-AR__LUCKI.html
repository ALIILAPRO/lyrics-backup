		  Nash Effect aR, AR

I thought I told you not to call me, ayy
Out here with the fakers,  say you different
 ayy wock and red, my bitch can't stop
Askin' what's the difference, ayy
How to say it, I just liked
Us better before the feelings, ayy
How to play it, niggas watchin' my
Moves and I ain't trippin', ayy
Level up on you, you gon' feel it, ayy
Molly, baby, I'm booted to the ceiling, ayy
V12 like vroom, you could feel it, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy my way or the highway
Doze off in the driveway
I just left 'em back home 'cause
They tired of my way
She be really on my phone like
She part of my day
Not a gimmick, not a clone
That's just part of my day
All those niggas really hoes and
That's all I can say
Off this yerky, I'm LeBron
How I'm fallin' away
Went from hurtin' to all love and
That's all in a day woah, woah, ayy, ayy
My way or the highway
I'm getting to this magic
Doze off in a driveway happy I didn't crash
I didn't say it's true
Summer full of madness, yeah

I thought I told you not to call me
I thought I, yo, ayy, ayy
I thought I told you not to call me
