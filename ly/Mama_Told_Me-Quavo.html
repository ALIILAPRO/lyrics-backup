		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hot, hot, hot, hot

Mama (woo, woo, woo, woo)
Mama (woo, woo, woo, woo)
Mama (woo, woo, woo, woo)
Mama (woo, woo, woo, woo)

Mama told me "Keep the dollars at home"
Mama told me not to gamble that shit (mama)
Mama told me to do dirt on my own
'Cause when niggas tell, you can't handle that shit (nah)
Mom used to say "Boy, get off of that phone
When them streets light come on, bring your ass home"
My mama told me "Don't be slammin' the door" (door)
Mama caught me juggin' out at the store (mama)
Mama told me "Yeah", couldn't tell me "No" (nah)
Mama, she got all the answers you need (mom)
When I got a step-daddy
Me and Takeoff, shit, we was stealin' the weaves (shit)
Mama always had a plan (on God)
To get out the hood in advance (get out)
Mama taught me how to be a man (hey)
I told my mama she don't need a man (mama)
My mama don't gotta work again (work)
Mama told me she my biggest fan (woo)
Mama told me how to finesse them white folks
Me and Takeoff turned to businessmen (wow)
My mama took the whole Nawfside and everybody ate (on God)
My mama told me "Go cry inside nigga and not in they face" (fuck them niggas)
Mama told me how to treat a bitch (woo)
Mama told me not to beat a bitch (no)
My mama know I'd hit a lick
Me and Takeoff used to pay the rent (Take')
My mama, hell, yeah, that's my mama
When I got that check, yeah, I gave her a hundred (hundred)
Boy, better take care of your mama
'Cause nobody gon' leave you just like your mama

Mama (woo, woo, woo, woo)
Mama (woo, woo, woo, woo, mama)
Mama (woo, woo, woo, woo, mom)
Mama (woo, woo, woo, woo, mama)
Mama (woo, woo, woo, woo, mama)
Mama (woo, woo, woo, woo, mama)
Mama (woo, woo, woo, woo, mama)
Mama (woo, woo, woo, woo)
