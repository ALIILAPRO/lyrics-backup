		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I see you in the sun you're as pretty as a swastika

Take you down, down from the inside
Take you down, down from the inside

I want to smash into your face, like a plain
And drown in between your legs

Take you down, down from the inside
Take you down, down from the inside

I'd die for your sins
If you don't kill me while I'm trying, baby

Let me show you where it hurts
Let me show you where it hurts
Let me show you where it hurts
There's more than one way, to make you cry

When I see you in the sun you're as pretty as a swastika
When I see you in the sun you're as pretty as a swastika

Take you down, down from the inside
Take you down, down from the inside

One of us is a knife
One of us is ripe, baby

Let me show you where it hurts
Let me show you where it hurts
Let me show you where it hurts
There's more than one way, to make you cry

Let me show you where it hurts
Let me show you where it hurts
Let me show you where it hurts
There's more than one way, to make you cry
