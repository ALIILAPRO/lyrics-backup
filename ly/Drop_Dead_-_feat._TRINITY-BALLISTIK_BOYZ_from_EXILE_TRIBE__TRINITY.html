		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ballistik boyz

Turn up, we've got the new thing
Got to keep it movin' on up
When you in this game, yeah

Rise up, no one's gonna stop it
We aimin' for the big time
Tokyo to worldwide, we pull up

Drive the whip in the kodak (kodak)
This 'ballistik' you know that (hoo)
Top the feed 'cause we on that
You catching up 'cause we too fast, yeah
Catch stones they been castin'
We got the bank load and iced up they been askin'
Young blood we king-coded

We run three, two, one
Been a long ride from the ground built up
We're right where we belong
When they all drop dead, we're still young, yeah

We run three, two, one
Been a long time but my mind's made up
We're right where we belong
When they all drop dead, we're still young

Drop dead (wa)
Drop dead, drop

We clap to the sound
Day till the dawn, we got no boundaries
Prepared ourselves to go outer pace, there's no doubt
'Cause we are not the same (boom)
Pour your hatred on me so much that I can keep goin'
Reloading my passion with the gasoline that will go back pass the moon

Hate on it but we just play the game
Everybody tryna follow 'cause they want to do the same
Number one, dreamers gonna put you in your place
Ain't nothing could ever stop it, you just fuelin' up the flame

We run three, two, one
Been a long ride from the ground built up
We're right where we belong
When they all drop dead, we're still young, yeah

We run three, two, one
Been a long time but my mind's made up
We're right where we belong
When they all drop dead, we're still young

Drop dead (wa)
Drop dead, drop

แม้ว่าความจริงเป็นเช่นไร
แม้ว่าเราไม่เคยเข้าใจ
แต่หากว่าตอนนี้เราไม่หยุด
เท่ากับว่าไม่ใช่วันสุดท้าย

We don't stop at good enough (ooh)
We don't stop at good as gold
Didn't stop when we got a little bit
No, we won't stop even if we drop dead

Drop dead (wa, wa)
Drop dead (wa), drop (wa)
Drop dead (da dadadada dadada)
Da dadadada dadadada
Drop dead (da dadadada dadada)
Drop dead (da dadadada dadadada)
Drop dead
