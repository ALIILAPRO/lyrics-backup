		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I close my eyes
I can see the home you built
Inside my mind
And I let it
Did you write me off?
Did I care too much?
Can we call this love?
Are we too far gone?
Have we had enough?
You know it's not like you
To go and sugar coat the truth
I see it on your lips
Your midnight trips
What's going on?
So tell me now
Tell me how
I'm breaking down
And you're just fine
If I close my eyes
I can see the home you built
Inside my mind
And I let it
Come to life
Let it set down roots
Where there was once a spine
Shame on me
Behind your walls
Are you listening at all?
Cause if I can't get through
I'm stuck like you
I can't move on
I try and try but if I
Close my eyes
(My eyes)
I can see the home you built
Inside my mind
(Inside my mind I let it)
And I let it
Come to life
(To life)
Let it set down roots
Where there was once a spine
Shame on me
You run away
When you just can't face it
Hide in the dark
But you know you hate it
Made me believe
In a life you didn't want
Shame on me
(Shame on me)
So tell me now
Tell me how
I'm breaking down and you're just fine
If I close my eyes
(My eyes)
I can see the home you built
Inside my mind
(Inside my mind)
And I let it
Come to life
(Come to life)
Let it set down roots
Where there was once a spine
(Was once a spine)
Shame on me
