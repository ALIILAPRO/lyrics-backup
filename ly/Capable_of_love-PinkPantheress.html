		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So we have a date prepared
It's in your writing, don't forget
I know last time you had doubts, or you said
That you couldn't make it, let's do later instead 
Right now I think you're the cause of my grief
And I haven't slept well for a week
You are somebody that I want to keep
But you said it's not deep and to that answer, I weep

It's weird how people still think it's pretend
The bond between us doesn't end
But they don't know the long distance we went
The one that we'll put behind us
Now that we're more than friends
I always wondered if we passed on the street
And I'd still never asked you yet to meet
But there's no other place I'd want to be
Than sat here replyin' to someone on a screen

And I think I need a picture 'cause it's never enough
To see you smilin' in my mind when I lay still in the dark
It starts with you
Starts with you
I'm obsessed with the idea that one day it breaks up
'Cause after that, I know I'll never be as capable of love
After you
After you

Three little words, dedicate them to me
Please make them personal, then say them to me
My focus is everywhere, I'm not listenin'
I got a readin' on my palm just to see
Don't you read everything you're supposed to? (Three little words, dedicate them to me)
I'm wastin' away, I feel psycho (please make them personal then say them to me)
(I got a confession) I've never given up (my focus is everywhere, I'm not listenin')
I just need to know if you're capable of love (I got a readin' on my palm just to see)

And I think I need a picture 'cause it's never enough
To see you smilin' in my mind when I lay still in the dark
It starts with you
Starts with you
I'm obsessed with the idea that one day it breaks up
'Cause after that I know I'll never be as capable of love
After you
After you

Three little words, dedicate them to me
Please make them personal, then say them to me
My focus is everywhere, I'm not listenin'
I got a readin' on my palm just to see
Three little words, dedicate them to me
Please make them personal, then say them to me
My focus is everywhere, I'm not listenin'
I got a readin' on my palm just to see
Three little words, dedicate them to me
Please make them personal, then say them to me
My focus is everywhere, I'm not listenin'
I got a readin' on my palm just to see
Three little words, dedicate them to me
Please make them personal, then say them to me
