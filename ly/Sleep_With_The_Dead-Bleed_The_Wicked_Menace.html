		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They scared of the dark
Make em scared when I talk
Devil in my shadow when I walk
Feeling lost every soul gotta cost
Really think you safe with a cross
Put a bullet in his head
Then the gun gets tossed

I creep through the dark with a gat
Devil horns and a mask
Catch him at the light
And put his brains up on the dash
Blood drip from the Glock
Let it bang make em drop
Brains leak out his top
Let him bleed till it stop
Bitch I came from the flames
All I ever knew was pain
Black magic in the rain
While I talk with the demons in my head
Fucking with bleed you gon
Sleep with the dead
Dance with the devil you heard what said
Send shots out that metal
Get soaked in all red
Pentagram in blood that he bled
Skin rip from the blade
Better watch what u say
Kill a opp let his body rot decay
In the dirt make em pay make em hurt
Bullets holes in they shirt
I ain't blessed bitch I'm cursed
Hear the sin in my verse
Fucking with the menace
You gon end up in a hearse
All black when we lurk
Get popped like a perk
Put his body in the earth
Fuck put him in the ground
Make em lay back
Spit let the bass smack
Beat a mother fucker till his face crack
Tell these mother fuckers I don't play that
Bleed

They scared of the dark
Make em scared when I talk
Devil in my shadow when I walk
Feeling lost every soul gotta cost
Really think you safe with a cross
Put a bullet in his head
Then the gun gets tossed
