		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'M ON THE OCEAN TRAVELING
IN SEARCH FOR MYSELF
THE LAST THING I NEED IS OUR HUMANITY

THE VOICES OF MY DEMONS
THAT'S HAUNTING MY MIND,
THEY CANNOT BE SATISFIED OUT HERE AT SEA

I’M FLYING THROUGH THE WAVES
MY SORROW IS FAR AWAY

ON THE SEA, I AM FREE
THIS IS WHERE I WANT TO BE
WITHOUT ALL THE PAIN, WITHOUT ALL THE HATE
IT'S HERE I WANT TO STAY
ON THE SEA, I AM FREE
THIS IS WHERE I WANT TO BE
WITHOUT ALL THE PAIN, WITHOUT ALL THE HATE
IT'S HERE I WANT TO STAY

I’M ON THE OCEAN TRAVELING
BUT NOT ALL ALONE
THE WATER, THE SUNLIGHT ARE WITH ME INSIGHT

DENYING ALL THE TRAVESTY
THAT IS WHAT WE CALL LIFE
I'M RUNNING, I’M FLEEING AWAY TO THE SHORES
I’M FLYING THROUGH THE WAVES
MY SORROW IS FAR AWAY

ON THE SEA, I AM FREE
THIS IS WHERE I WANT TO BE
WITHOUT ALL THE PAIN, WITHOUT ALL THE HATE
IT'S HERE I WANT TO STAY
ON THE SEA, I AM FREE
THIS IS WHERE I WANT TO BE
WITHOUT ALL THE PAIN, WITHOUT ALL THE HATE
IT'S HERE I WANT TO STAY

ON THE SEA, I AM FREE
THIS IS WHERE I WANT TO BE
WITHOUT ALL THE PAIN, WITHOUT ALL THE HATE
IT'S HERE I WANT TO STAY
ON THE SEA, I AM FREE
THIS IS WHERE I WANT TO BE
WITHOUT ALL THE PAIN, WITHOUT ALL THE HATE
IT'S HERE I WANT TO STAY

ON THE SEA, I AM FREE
THIS IS WHERE I WANT TO BE
WITHOUT ALL THE PAIN, WITHOUT ALL THE HATE
IT'S HERE I WANT TO STAY
ON THE SEA, I AM FREE
THIS IS WHERE I WANT TO BE
WITHOUT ALL THE PAIN, WITHOUT ALL THE HATE
IT'S HERE I WANT TO STAY…
