		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart

The girl is mine (she mine, she mine, she mine)
The doggone girl is mine 
(She like the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock)
I know she's mine (She mine, she mine, she mine)
The doggone girl is mine 
(She like the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock)

I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours, not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
It's really just a waste of time

Because she's mine (she mine, she mine, she mine)
The doggone girl is mine 
(She like the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock)
Don't waste your time (your time, don't waste your time, don't your time, don't)
'Cause the doggone girl is mine 
(She like the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock)

I love you more than he (take you anywhere)
But I love you endlessly (loving we will share)
So come and go with me
Two on the town
But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other

Don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time
That she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind

The girl is mine (she mine, she mine, she mine)
The doggone girl is mine 
(She like the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock)
Don't waste your time (your time, don't waste your time, don't your time, don't)
'Cause the doggone girl is mine 
(She like the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock)

She love the way I love her low
The way I love her high
She love to say hello
And never say goodbye
I call her mommy
And she call me papa
I'm sorry Mike but
She love the way I rock her
And you know, you know, you know I really care
(You know, you know, you know I care, oh, girl)
And she know, she know the love is right here
And I know, I know the love is real true
And now they know, they know just how the Willie do

They like the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock
The way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock
The way I roll with it
The way I rock with it
The way I rock with the King of Pop, non- stop with it
The way I rock, the way, the way I rock
The way I rock, the way I rock, I rock, I rock
Will.i.am none stop, rollin' with the King of Pop
MJ, make it hot (ah!)
Yeah, you like the way I rock
The way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock
The way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock, the way I rock
