		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hold my anger in my stomach
And I'm starting to have side effects
From hating you this much
No explanation, just a quote in a magazine
Where you said you only dated me for fun
And I'm paraphrasing now
But the gist of it was how you never loved me
Only in it for the sex
And I really don't get how
You can say that and be proud of it
We both know you were in deeper than that

Nobody likes a secret
And I was always yours
It's almost been a year And 
even so
I still don't know what for
