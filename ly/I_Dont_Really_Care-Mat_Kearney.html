		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I probably shouldn't write this
Nobody looks like this
Tryna get right the brightness
Hope somebody likes this
Somebody gets the right fit
Somebody gets the night shift
Messin' 'round to have five kids
One of them will be the nicest

I'm so tired of this weather, feel it down in my bones
Even when we're together, we just stare at our phones
Can we just watch the sunset, and forget how we compare?
I wish that I could say that

I don't really care, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
I don't really care, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

Man, why you write a sonnet?
Just tryna get a comment
You ain't nobody's prophet
Just soundin' like a prophet
Don't worry 'bout the angles
Man, it could be angels
That clip could be dangerous
Where everybody's famous

I'm so tired of this weather, feel it down in my bones
Even when we're together, we just stare at our phones
Can we just watch the sunset, and forget how we compare?
I wish that I could say that

I don't really care, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
I don't really care, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah (yeah)
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

I could lie to myself and be honest with somebody else
I could try to be something but honestly I don't know what
I could lie to myself and be honest with somebody else
I could try to be something but honestly I don't know what

I don't really care, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
I don't really care, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
