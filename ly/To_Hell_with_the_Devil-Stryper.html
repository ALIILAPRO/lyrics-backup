		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We speak of the devil 
He's no friend of mine 
To turn from him is what we have in mind 

Just a liar and a thief 
The word tells us so 
We like to let him know 
Where he can go 

To hell with the devil 
To hell with the devil 

When things are going wrong 
You know who to blame 
He will always live 
Up to his name 

He's never been the answer 
There's a better way 
We are here to rock out 
And to say

To hell with the devil 
To hell with the devil 

To hell with the devil 
To hell with the devil 

To hell with the devil 
To hell with the devil 

To hell with the devil 
To hell with the devil
