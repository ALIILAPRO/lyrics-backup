		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can't see me, not right now
Go and be that light for someone, you know how
I'll try to be here for a while
But like a candle burns bright, it still burns out

Hey, I'm coming home
And for how long, I don't know

Will you sit with me for a while?
And do you hear me when I tell you that I've tried?
I've tried to be there your whole life
To provide for you and I'd die for you with pride

Hey, when I get back home
I'll never let you go

I'll be your sun
When life gets you cold
And your days are young
But man, I'm growing old

And hey, I'll be your sun
When life gets you cold
Your days are young
But man, I'm growing old

Hey, I'll be your sun
When life gets you cold
Your days are young
But man, I'm growing old

Hey, I'll be your sun
When life gets you cold
Your days are young
But man, I'm growing old
